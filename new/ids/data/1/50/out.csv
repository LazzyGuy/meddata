Clinical and radiographic data of patients who were treated between 01/01/2014 and 01/04/2018 were retrieved from the archieves. The clinical data of gender, age, implant length, implant diameter and locator height was recorded. The mesial and distal marginal bone levels of all implants and interimplant distances were determined at baseline and 6., 12, and 24. month recall sessions on panoramic radiographs in a computer program. Statistical analysis was used to evaluate the effect of implant length, implant diameter, gender, age, interimplant distance and locator height on marginal bone loss in 6., 12. and 24. month control evaluations. A total of 57 patients with a mean age of 59,2±9.8 and 114 implants were included in the study. Among the aferomentioned parameters, only the locator height had major effect on the distal and mesial marginal bone loss.(p<0.05) Locator with 4 mm height showed statistically significant distal and mesial marginal bone loss compared locators with 2 and 3 mm heights in all control periods.(p<0.05) The locator with 4 mm height generates more stress compared to locators with 2 and 3 mm heights leading to marginal bone loss. The absence of oral hygiene measurement was identified as a limitation of the study. Clinical parameters of gender, age, implant length, implant diameter interimplant distance do not seem to affect marginal bone loss in the study population of the current study.","""Gravity"" - a new simple negative pressure wound therapy self-build design for low income countries.",https://www.ncbi.nlm.nih.gov/pubmed/30875268,Journal of medical engineering & technology,2019 03 28,Negative Pressure Wound Therapy (NPWT) is prohibitively expensive at the moment and therefore not easily accessible in low-income countries. An additional problem is the requirement of consistent reliable electricity to power the devices. A new low-cost NPWT device was designed from low cost and simple materials and it can be built and operated following a simple set of instructions. The so-called Gravity device was made from parts costing just under £6 GBP (May 2016) and it creates a constant pressure of 125 mmHg. Gravity operated from 4 hours and 40 minutes up to 5 hours and 18 minutes before needing to be reset. This reset can be achieved without patient involvement. Gravity was taken to Kenya by a Doctor on 5 May 2016 to be evaluated. A NPWT device prototype was successfully made and positive feedback was received from Kenya.,Group-Based Relative Deprivation Explains Endorsement of Extremism Among Western-Born Muslims.,https://www.ncbi.nlm.nih.gov/pubmed/30875267,Psychological science,2019 04 16,"Although jihadist threats are regarded as foreign, most Islamist terror attacks in Europe and the United States have been orchestrated by Muslims born and raised in Western societies. In the present research, we explored a link between perceived deprivation of Western Muslims and endorsement of extremism. We suggest that Western-born Muslims are particularly vulnerable to the impact of perceived relative deprivation because comparisons with majority groups' peers are more salient for them than for individuals born elsewhere. Thus, we hypothesized that Western-born, compared with foreign-born, Muslims would score higher on four predictors of extremism (e.g., violent intentions), and group-based deprivation would explain these differences. Studies 1 to 6 ( Ns = 59, 232, 259, 243, 104, and 366, respectively) confirmed that Western-born Muslims scored higher on all examined predictors of extremism. Mediation and meta-analysis showed that group-based relative deprivation accounted for these differences. Study 7 ( N = 60) showed that these findings are not generalizable to non-Muslims.",A review on the advancements in the field of upper limb prosthesis.,https://www.ncbi.nlm.nih.gov/pubmed/30875266,Journal of medical engineering & technology,2019 03 28,"Amputation is one of the serious issue across the globe which is mainly caused by trauma, medical illness or congenital condition. Because of steep increase in amputation incidences, the need for progress in technicality of prosthesis is becoming imperative. In this article, the journey of advancements in upper arm prosthesis has been discussed step by step. Moreover, it has also been enunciated that how from a simple replacement for an arm it now has reached the mark of giving a patient a fully functional limb with the help of sensors and myoelectric transducers that are able to translate the remaining muscle signals into full movement of the prosthesis. However, researches are still going on to make the design of the prosthetic more impressive having better range of movement, to establish its interface with brain more efficiently and to make the control of prosthetic more user friendly. In this review, a special emphasis has also been given to myoelectric prosthesis as this prosthetic system possesses a decisive influence on rehabilitation results. Moreover, this prosthetic system is extremely elegant and cutting-edge in both design and technology and offers a great wearer comfort.",Nerve stimulator for regional anaesthesia procedures with automatic interactive closed-loop control.,https://www.ncbi.nlm.nih.gov/pubmed/30875265,Journal of medical engineering & technology,2019 03 28,"Peripheral nerve stimulators have widespread among anaesthesiologists and remain a popular technique. However, in commercial devices, the user has to manually adjust stimulus intensity. Thus, the aim of this study is to propose a method that allows automating the current intensity control. An earlier nerve stimulator prototype was modified to add an accelerometer and an sEMG module. The choice of these two sensors is aimed at the possibility of observing the mechanical and electrical responses of the muscle contraction evoked by the stimulation. The tests were performed in two steps. The first step was to observe how the sensors behave during stimulation and muscle contraction. The second step was to implement a control algorithm and to validate the automation technique. Comparing the two methods, no significant differences were found on procedure time (manual: 12.5 ± 2.3; automatic: 11.6 ± 1.9; ρ =0.380) and blockade latency time (manual: 11.6 ± 1.1; automatic: 11.9 ± 1.2; ρ =0.524). Comparing needle-nerve distance in manual or automatic mode, no significant differences were found for 1.0 mA, 0.8 mA, 0.5 mA and 0.3 mA. We conclude that the technique for automating the current intensity update, using accelerometer and/or electromyography, is satisfactory. Furthermore, we conclude that the use of the accelerometer alone is sufficient for detection of muscle contraction.",A three-dimensional finite element analysis of the human hip.,https://www.ncbi.nlm.nih.gov/pubmed/30875263,Journal of medical engineering & technology,2019 03 28,"A three-dimensional hip model was created from the MRI scans of one human subject based on constructing the entire pelvis and femur. The ball and socket joint was modelled between the hip's acetabulum and the femoral head to analyse the multiaxial loads applied in the hip joint. The three key ligaments that reinforce the external surface of the hip to help to stabilise the joint were also modelled which are the iliofemoral, the pubofemoral and ischiofemoral ligaments. Each of these ligaments wraps around the joint connection to form a seal over the synovial membrane, a line of attachment around the head of the femur. This model was tested for different loading and boundary conditions to analyse their sensitivities on the cortical and cancellous tissues of the human hip bones. The outcomes of a one-legged stance finite element analysis revealed that the maximum of 0.056 mm displacement occurred. The stress distribution varied across the model which the majority occurring in the cortical femur and dissipating through the cartilage. The maximum stress value occurring in the joint was 110.1 MPa, which appeared at the free end of the proximal femur. This developed finite element model was validated against the literature data to be used as an asset for further research in investigating new methods of total hip arthroplasty, to minimise the recurrence of dislocations and discomfort in the hip joint, as well as increasing the range of movement available to a patient after surgery.",Evaluation of time domain features using best feature subsets based on mutual information for detecting epilepsy.,https://www.ncbi.nlm.nih.gov/pubmed/30875262,Journal of medical engineering & technology,2019 03 28,"In this pattern recognition study of detecting epilepsy, the first time the authors have attempted to use time domain (TD) features such as waveform length (WL), number of zero-crossings (ZC) and number of slope sign changes (SSC) which are extracted from the discrete wavelet transform (DWT) for the detecting the epilepsy for University of Bonn datasets and real-time clinical data. The performance of these TD features is studied along with mean absolute value (MAV) which has been attempted by other researchers. The performance of the TD features derived from DWT is studied using naive Bayes (NB) and support vector machines (SVM) for five different datasets from University of Bonn with 14 different combinations datasets and 24 patients datasets from Christian Medical College and Hospital (CMCH), India database. Using feature selection and feature ranking based on the estimation of mutual information (MI), the significant features required for the classifier to get higher accuracy is obtained. Further, NB achieves 100% classification accuracy (CA) in distinguishing normal eyes open and epileptic dataset with top 4 ranked features and it gives 100% accuracy with top-ranked two features in using CMCH data.",Understanding sex differences in long-term blood pressure regulation: insights from experimental studies and computational modeling.,https://www.ncbi.nlm.nih.gov/pubmed/30875261,American journal of physiology. Heart and circulatory physiology,2019 05 03,"Sex differences in blood pressure and the prevalence of hypertension are found in humans and animal models. Moreover, there has been a recent explosion of data concerning sex differences in nitric oxide, the renin-angiotensin-aldosterone system, inflammation, and kidney function. These data have the potential to reveal the mechanisms underlying male-female differences in blood pressure control. To elucidate the interactions among the multitude of physiological processes involved, one may apply computational models. In this review, we describe published computational models that represent key players in blood pressure regulation, and highlight sex-specific models and their findings.",Conduction in the right and left ventricle is differentially regulated by protein kinases and phosphatases: implications for arrhythmogenesis.,https://www.ncbi.nlm.nih.gov/pubmed/30875259,American journal of physiology. Heart and circulatory physiology,2019 06 05,"The ""stress"" kinases cAMP-dependent protein kinase (PKA) and calcium/calmodulin-dependent protein kinase II (CaMKII), phosphorylate the Na+ channel Nav1.5 subunit to regulate its function. However, how the channel regulation translates to ventricular conduction is poorly understood. We hypothesized that the stress kinases positively and differentially regulate conduction in the right (RV) and the left (LV) ventricles. We applied the CaMKII blocker KN93 (2.75 μM), PKA blocker H89 (10 μM), and broad-acting phosphatase blocker calyculin (30 nM) in rabbit hearts paced at a cycle length (CL) of 150-8,000 ms. We used optical mapping to determine the distribution of local conduction delays (inverse of conduction velocity). Control hearts exhibited constant and uniform conduction at all tested CLs. Calyculin (15-min perfusion) accelerated conduction, with greater effect in the RV (by 15.3%) than in the LV (by 4.1%; P < 0.05). In contrast, both KN93 and H89 slowed down conduction in a chamber-, time-, and CL-dependent manner, with the strongest effect in the RV outflow tract (RVOT). Combined KN93 and H89 synergistically promoted conduction slowing in the RV (KN93: 24.7%; H89: 29.9%; and KN93 + H89: 114.2%; P = 0.0016) but not the LV. The progressive depression of RV conduction led to conduction block and reentrant arrhythmias. Protein expression levels of both the CaMKII-δ isoform and the PKA catalytic subunit were higher in the RVOT than in the apical LV (P < 0.05). Thus normal RV conduction requires a proper balance between kinase and phosphatase activity. Dysregulation of this balance due to pharmacological interventions or disease is potentially proarrhythmic. NEW & NOTEWORTHY We show that uniform ventricular conduction requires a precise physiological balance of the activities of calcium/calmodulin-dependent protein kinase II (CaMKII), PKA, and phosphatases, which involves region-specific expression of CaMKII and PKA. Inhibiting CaMKII and/or PKA activity elicits nonuniform conduction depression, with the right ventricle becoming vulnerable to the development of conduction disturbances and ventricular fibrillation/ventricular tachycardia."

In addition, compelling data strongly implicate OSA in the development of cardiovascular disease (CVD) including myocardial infarction and stroke. Yet in clinical trials, CPAP therapy alone did not reduce cardiovascular events in intention to treat analyses. Thus, opportunity arises for adjunctive therapy, independent of treating comorbid conditions, to target downstream adverse physiologic and biochemical consequences of incompletely treated OSA with the goal of CVD reduction. Although many pharmacologic agents could fit this purpose, for this review, we have focused on three specific drug classes (statins, antioxidants, and angiotensin receptor antagonists) that may be relevant based on animal and human studies.","Evolocumab, a proprotein convertase subtilisin/kexin type 9 inhibitor, promotes angiogenesis in vitro.",https://www.ncbi.nlm.nih.gov/pubmed/30875237,Canadian journal of physiology and pharmacology,2019 04 24,"The proprotein convertases family is involved in several physiological processes such as cell growth, migration, and angiogenesis, and also in different pathological conditions. Evolocumab, an inhibitor of proprotein convertase subtilisin/kexin type 9 (PCSK9), has recently been approved for treatment of hypercholesterolemia. This study aimed to investigate the effect of evolocumab on angiogenesis in human umbilical vein endothelial cells (HUVECs). Cell proliferation and migration were evaluated using 3-(4,5-dimethylthiazol-2-yl)-2,5-diphenyltetrazolium bromide and Transwell methods. In vitro angiogenesis was assessed by tube formation assay. Vascular endothelial growth factor (VEGF) secretion by HUVECs was also determined using an enzyme-linked immunosorbent assay kit. Evolocumab significantly increased HUVECs viability at 100 μg/mL. Significant enhancement in cell migration, and mean tubules length and size was observed at the concentrations of 10 and 100 μg/mL and also in mean number of junctions at the concentration of 100 μg/mL. Administration of evolocumab at the concentration of 10 μg/mL increased VEGF release into supernatants of HUVECs. Findings of this investigation provided in vitro evidence for pro-angiogenic activity of evolocumab through promoting cell proliferation, migration, tubulogenesis, and VEGF secretion in HUVECs.",Genome-wide miRNA methylome analysis in oral cancer: possible biomarkers associated with patient survival.,https://www.ncbi.nlm.nih.gov/pubmed/30875235,Epigenomics,2019 03 29,The methylome associated with miRNA loci was investigated in oral cancer to explore tobacco specific methylation and potential biomarkers for patient survival.,DNA methylation signatures in mendelian developmental disorders as a diagnostic bridge between genotype and phenotype.,https://www.ncbi.nlm.nih.gov/pubmed/30875234,Epigenomics,2019 03 29,"Epigenetic and genetic mechanisms regulate the establishment and maintenance of gene expression in its proper context. Recent genome-wide mapping approaches have identified DNA methylation (DNAm) signatures in patients clinically diagnosed with syndromes manifesting as developmental disabilities with intellectual impairments. Here, we review recent studies in which these DNA methylation signatures have enabled highly sensitive and specific screening of such individuals and have clarified ambiguous cases where subjects present with genetic sequence variants of unknown clinical significance (VUS). We propose that these episignatures be considered as echoes and/or legacies of the initiating mutational events within proteins of the so-called epigenetic machinery. As well, we discuss approaches to directly confirm the functional consequences and the implications of these episignatures to patient management and treatment.",Site-Specific Immuno-PET Tracer to Image PD-L1.,https://www.ncbi.nlm.nih.gov/pubmed/30875232,Molecular pharmaceutics,2019 05 17,"The rapid ascension of immune checkpoint blockade treatments has placed an emphasis on the need for viable, robust, and noninvasive imaging methods for immune checkpoint proteins, which could be of diagnostic value. Immunoconjugate-based positron emission tomography (immuno-PET) allows for sensitive and quantitative imaging of target levels and has promising potential for the noninvasive evaluation of immune checkpoint proteins. However, the advancement of immuno-PET is currently limited by available imaging tools, which heavily rely on full-length IgGs with Fc-mediated effects and are heterogeneous mixtures upon random conjugation with chelators for imaging. Herein, we have developed a site-specific αPD-L1 Fab conjugate with the chelator 1,4,7-triazacyclononane- N, N', N″-triacetic acid (NOTA), enabling radiolabeling for PET imaging, using the amber suppression-mediated genetic incorporation of unnatural amino acid (UAA), p-azidophenylalanine. This Fab conjugate is homogeneous and demonstrated tight binding toward the PD-L1 antigen in vitro. The radiolabeled version, 64Cu-NOTA-αPD-L1, has been employed in PET imaging to allow for effective visualization and mapping of the biodistribution of PD-L1 in two normal mouse models, including the capturing of different PD-L1 expression levels in the spleens of the different mouse types. Follow-up in vivo blocking studies and ex vivo fluorescent staining further validated specific tissue uptakes of the imaging agent. This approach illustrates the utility of UAA-based site-specific Fab conjugation as a general strategy for making sensitive PET imaging probes, which could facilitate the elucidation of the roles of a wide variety of immune checkpoint proteins in immunotherapy.",Synthesis of a Porphyrin(2.1.2.1) Nanobelt and Its Ability To Bind Fullerene.,https://www.ncbi.nlm.nih.gov/pubmed/30875231,Organic letters,2019 06 05,"This Letter details a simple and effective method to synthesize a porphyrin(2.1.2.1)-based nanobelt NBNi3 via condensation reactions of 1,2,4,5-tetra(pyrrol-2-yl)benzene and benzaldehydes.

The concave-shaped cavity of NBNi3 behaves as a C60 receptor by capturing two C60 cooperatively. Additionally, NBNi3 exhibits reversible oxidation and reduction peaks with five electrons in each peak, indicating that the shape of the nanobelt can stabilize multicationic and anionic states.",One-Step SH2 Superbinder-Based Approach for Sensitive Analysis of Tyrosine Phosphoproteome.,https://www.ncbi.nlm.nih.gov/pubmed/30875230,Journal of proteome research,2019 04 05,"Tyrosine phosphorylation plays a major role in regulating cell signaling pathways governing diverse biological functions such as proliferation and differentiation. Systemically mapping phosphotyrosine (pTyr) sites is the key to understanding molecular mechanisms underlining pTyr-dependent signaling. Although mass spectrometry-based technologies have been widely used for pTyr site profiling and quantification, their applications are often hindered by the poor efficiency in current multistep enrichment procedures for inherently low abundance pTyr peptides, especially under physiological conditions. Taking advantage of the sequence-independent high affinity of SH2 superbinder toward pTyr residues, we have developed a simplified one-step pTyr peptide enrichment method that uses immobilized SH2 superbinder for unbiased and robust enrichment of endogenous pTyr peptides from biological samples. By eliminating the prerequisite global phosphopeptide enrichment step in our previously developed two-step method, we minimized sample loss and improved peptide capture efficiency. Applying this method to Jurkat cells at resting state, where the tyrosine phosphorylation level is low, both the number of identified pTyr peptides and sites are increased by three folds compared to the two-step method. Specifically, we were able to identify 511 nonredundant pTyr peptides, corresponding to 403 high confidence pTyr sites, from Jurkat cells with high level technical reproducibility (Pearson's correlation coefficient as high as 0.94). Further applying this method to two human breast cancer cell lines, BT474 and HCC1954, before and after EGF stimulation, we demonstrated that this approach could be a powerful tool for illustrating pTyr-dependent signaling network controlling cellular behaviors such as drug resistance.",Lipase/Oxovanadium Co-Catalyzed Dynamic Kinetic Resolution of Propargyl Alcohols: Competition between Racemization and Rearrangement.,https://www.ncbi.nlm.nih.gov/pubmed/30875229,Organic letters,2019 06 13,"Quantitative conversion of racemic propargyl alcohols into optically active propargyl esters with up to 99% ee has been achieved by lipase/oxovanadium co-catalyzed dynamic kinetic resolution, which combines the lipase-catalyzed enantioselective esterification of the racemic substrates and the in situ racemization of the remaining enantiomers. The success is owed to our discovery of a magic solvent, (trifluoromethyl)benzene, that accelerated the racemization while sufficiently suppressing the common oxovanadium-catalyzed rearrangement of propargyl alcohols to irreversibly produce enals."

Initial SAR around these hits allowed for the iterative and directed assembly of a focused set of 30 analogues of their hybrid structure. Compounds 10, 17, 20, and 22 were identified as the most potent compounds, inhibiting the development of the fourth larval (L4) stage of H. contortus at sub-nanomolar potencies while displaying strong selectivity toward the parasite when tested in vitro against the human MCF10A cell line.

Local order parameters, such as Steinhardt parameters, are widely used for this identification task; however, the parameters are often tailored to specific local structural geometries and generalize poorly to new structures and distorted or undercoordinated bonding environments. Motivated by the desire to simplify the process and improve the accuracy, we introduce DeepIce, a novel deep neural network designed to identify ice and water molecules, which can be generalized to new structures where multiple bonding environments are present. DeepIce demonstrates that the characteristics of a crystalline or liquid molecule can be classified using as input simply the Cartesian coordinates of the nearest neighbors without compromising the accuracy. The network is flexible and capable of inferring rotational invariance and produces a high predictive accuracy compared to the Steinhardt approach, the tetrahedral order parameter and polyhedral template matching in the detection of the phase of molecules in premelted ice surfaces.","Designing Allele-Specific Inhibitors of Spastin, a Microtubule-Severing AAA Protein.",https://www.ncbi.nlm.nih.gov/pubmed/30875216,Journal of the American Chemical Society,2019 04 10,"The bump-hole approach is a powerful chemical biology strategy to specifically probe the functions of closely related proteins. However, for many protein families, such as the ATPases associated with diverse cellular activities (AAA), we lack structural data for inhibitor-protein complexes to design allele-specific chemical probes. Here we report the X-ray structure of a pyrazolylaminoquinazoline-based inhibitor bound to spastin, a microtubule-severing AAA protein, and characterize the residues involved in inhibitor binding. We show that an inhibitor analogue with a single-atom hydrogen-to-fluorine modification can selectively target a spastin allele with an engineered cysteine mutation in its active site. We also report an X-ray structure of the fluoro analogue bound to the spastin mutant. Furthermore, analyses of other mutant alleles suggest how the stereoelectronics of the fluorine-cysteine interaction, rather than sterics alone, contribute to the inhibitor-allele selectivity. This approach could be used to design allele-specific probes for studying cellular functions of spastin isoforms. Our data also suggest how tuning stereoelectronics can lead to specific inhibitor-allele pairs for the AAA superfamily.",Tunable Direct Band Gap of β-CuGaO2 and β-LiGaO2 Solid Solutions in the Full Visible Range.,https://www.ncbi.nlm.nih.gov/pubmed/30875215,Inorganic chemistry,2019 04 01,"We synthesized solid solutions of β-CuGaO2 and β-LiGaO2 (i.e., β-(Cu1- xLi x)GaO2) by partial ion exchange of Cu+ in β-CuGaO2 with Li+ from LiCl in the composition range of 0 ≤ x ≤ 0.89.

The structural distortions of the solid solutions with respect to the ideal binary wurtzite-type structure were relatively small because of the similar ionic radii of Li+, Cu+, and Ga3+. Based on a recently proposed hypothesis relating structural distortion to the nature of the band gap (i.e., direct or indirect), it is expected that the solid solution has a direct band gap. We anticipate that this solid solution system will contribute to the realization of oxide-based optoelectronic devices.",Molecular Dynamics Simulations of PAMAM and PPI Dendrimers Using the GROMOS-Compatible 2016H66 Force Field.,https://www.ncbi.nlm.nih.gov/pubmed/30875214,Journal of chemical information and modeling,2019 04 22,"A systematic evaluation of the accuracy of the GROMOS-compatible 2016H66 force field in the simulation of dendrimers is performed. More specifically, the poly(amido amine) (PAMAM) and the poly(propyleneimine) (PPI) are considered because of the availability of experimental data and simulation results in the literature. A total of 36 molecular systems are simulated and the radius of gyration, asphericity, density profiles, and the self-diffusion coefficient are monitored in terms of the generation number and pH (low, medium, and high) condition. Overall, the results support the recommendation of the 2016H66 force field for the simulation of dendrimer systems. The natural building-block based strategy adopted in the definition of 2016H66, together with a careful parametrization of the chemical functional groups to reproduce thermodynamic properties in environments of different polarity, and also the ability to accurately reproduce the expected structural and dynamic features of dendrimers, as shown in the present work, make this force field an attractive option for the simulation of such systems.",Polarizable QM/MM Approach with Fluctuating Charges and Fluctuating Dipoles: The QM/FQFμ Model.,https://www.ncbi.nlm.nih.gov/pubmed/30875213,Journal of chemical theory and computation,2019 04 10,"The novel polarizable FQFμ force field is proposed and coupled to a quantum mechanical (QM) SCF Hamiltonian. The peculiarity of the resulting QM/FQFμ approach stands in the fact the polarization effects are modeled in terms of both fluctuating charges and dipoles, which vary as a response to the external electric field/potential. Remarkably, QM/FQFμ is defined in terms of three parameters: electronegativity and chemical hardness, which are well-defined in density functional theory, and polarizability, which is physically observable. Such parameters are numerically adjusted to reproduce full QM reference electrostatic energy values. The model is challenged against test molecular systems in aqueous solution, showing remarkable accuracy and thus highlighting its potentialities for future extensive applications.",Ab Initio Calculation of Total X-ray Scattering from Molecules.,https://www.ncbi.nlm.nih.gov/pubmed/30875212,Journal of chemical theory and computation,2019 05 15,"We present a method to calculate total X-ray scattering cross sections directly from ab initio electronic wave functions in atoms and molecules. The approach can be used in conjunction with multiconfigurational wave functions and exploits analytical integrals of Gaussian-type functions over the scattering operator, which leads to accurate and efficient calculations. The results are validated by comparison to experimental results and previous theory for the molecules H2 and CO2. Importantly, we find that the inelastic component of the total scattering varies strongly with molecular geometry. The method is appropriate for use in conjunction with quantum molecular dynamics simulations for the analysis of new ultrafast X-ray scattering experiments and to interpret accurate gas-phase scattering experiments.",Epigallocatechin Gallate Inhibits Hepatic Glucose Production in Primary Hepatocytes via Downregulating PKA Signaling Pathways and Transcriptional Factor FoxO1.,https://www.ncbi.nlm.nih.gov/pubmed/30875211,Journal of agricultural and food chemistry,2019 04 15,"Forkhead/winged helix transcription factor O-class member 1 (FoxO1) is a key mediator of insulin and glucagon signaling in control of glucose homeostasis. Although epigallocatechin gallate (EGCG) has attracted interest owing to its potential to combat hyperglycemic diabetes, molecular mechanisms underlying its antihyperglycemic effect, in particular the effect on FoxO1, is poorly understand. This study aims to assess the impact of EGCG on the glucagon signaling pathway in regulating glucose metabolism. Primary hepatocytes from wild-type (WT), liver-specific FoxO1 knock out (FKO), and FoxO1-S273D knock-in (KI) mice were isolated, cultured, and treated with EGCG and/or glucagon. Our data showed the treatment of 10 μM EGCG for 6 h decreased hepatic glucose production by 20 and 23% in WT and FKO primary hepatocytes, respectively. EGCG repressed both gluconeogenesis and glycogenolysis in primary hepatocytes, coupled with activating AMPK. In addition, EGCG decreased mitochondrial oxygen consumption. We further investigated the effects of EGCG on glucagon-stimulated cAMP/PKA signaling pathway. EGCG reduced p-PKA-T197/T-PKA and p-CREB-S133/T-CREB levels by 39 and 20%, blocked p-FoxO1-S273, and suppressed nuclear FoxO1 translocation, suggesting that FoxO1 and CREB were possible downstream targets. A novel mechanism of EGCG in restraining hepatic glucose production (HGP) is through antagonizing glucagon signaling and suppressing FoxO1 via Ser273. EGCG may serve as a promising compound for regulating glucose homeostasis.",Evaluating Unexpectedly Short Non-covalent Distances in X-ray Crystal Structures of Proteins with Electronic Structure Analysis.,https://www.ncbi.nlm.nih.gov/pubmed/30875210,Journal of chemical information and modeling,2019 05 28,"We investigate unexpectedly short non-covalent distances (<85% of the sum of van der Waals radii) in X-ray crystal structures of proteins. We curate over 11 000 high-quality protein crystal structures and an ultra-high-resolution (1.2 Å or better) subset containing >900 structures. Although our non-covalent distance criterion excludes standard hydrogen bonds known to be essential in protein stability, we observe over 75 000 close contacts (CCs) in the curated protein structures. Analysis of the frequency of amino acids participating in these interactions demonstrates some expected trends (i.e., enrichment of charged Lys, Arg, Asp, and Glu) but also reveals unexpected enhancement of Tyr in such interactions. Nearly all amino acids are observed to form at least one CC with all other amino acids, and most interactions are preserved in the much smaller ultra-high-resolution subset. We quantum-mechanically characterize the interaction energetics of a subset of >5000 CCs with symmetry-adapted perturbation theory to enable decomposition of interactions. We observe the majority of CCs to be favorable. The shortest favorable non-covalent distances are under 2.2 Å and are very repulsive when characterized with classical force fields. This analysis reveals stabilization by a combination of electrostatic and charge-transfer effects between hydrophobic (i.e., Val, Ile, Leu) amino acids and charged Asp or Glu. We also observe a unique hydrogen-bonding configuration between Tyr and Asn/Gln involving both residues acting simultaneously as hydrogen bond donors and acceptors. This work confirms the importance of first-principles simulation in explaining unexpected geometries in protein crystal structures.",Atomic Scale Stability of Tungsten-Cobalt Intermetallic Nanocrystals in Reactive Environment at High Temperature.,https://www.ncbi.nlm.nih.gov/pubmed/30875209,Journal of the American Chemical Society,2019 04 10,"Catalyst design plays vital roles in structurally relevant reactions. Revealing the catalyst structure and chemistry in the reactive environment at the atomic scale is imperative for the rational design of catalysts as well as the investigation of reaction mechanisms, while in situ characterization at the atomic scale at high temperature is still a great challenge. Here, tracking intermetallic Co7W6 nanocrystals with a defined structure and a high melting point by environmental aberration-corrected transmission electron microscopy in combination with in situ synchrotron X-ray absorption spectroscopy, we directly present the structural and chemical stability of the Co7W6 nanocrystals in methane, carbon monoxide, and hydrogen at temperatures of 700-1100 °C. The evidence is in situ and in real time with both atomic scaled resolution and collective information. The results are helpful in revealing the mechanism of structural-specified synthesis of single-walled carbon nanotubes. This research offers an example of systematic investigation at the atomic scale on catalysts under reactive conditions. Such catalysts presenting high structural stability may also find applications in other structure-specific synthesis."

However, the impeded amount of light absorption imposed by the ultrathin nature of the monolayers impairs their viability in photonic applications. Using a layered heterostructure of a monolayer TMD stacked on top of strongly absorbing, nonluminescent, multilayer SnSe2, we show that both single-photon and two-photon luminescence from the TMD monolayer can be enhanced by a factor of 14 and 7.5, respectively. This is enabled through interlayer dipole-dipole coupling induced nonradiative Förster resonance energy transfer (FRET) from SnSe2 underneath, which acts as a scavenger of the light unabsorbed by the monolayer TMD. The design strategy exploits the near-resonance between the direct energy gap of SnSe2 and the excitonic gap of monolayer TMD, the smallest possible separation between donor and acceptor facilitated by van der Waals heterojunction, and the in-plane orientation of dipoles in these layered materials. The FRET-driven uniform single- and two-photon luminescence enhancement over the entire junction area is advantageous over the local enhancement in quantum dot or plasmonic structure integrated 2D layers and is promising for improving quantum efficiency in imaging, optoelectronic, and photonic applications.",How Defects Control the Out-of-Equilibrium Dissipative Evolution of a Supramolecular Tubule.,https://www.ncbi.nlm.nih.gov/pubmed/30875196,ACS nano,2019 04 24,"Supramolecular architectures that work out-of-equilibrium or that can change in specific ways when absorbing external energy are ubiquitous in nature. Gaining the ability to create via self-assembly artificial materials possessing such fascinating behaviors would have a major impact in many fields. However, the rational design of similar dynamic structures requires to understand and, even more challenging, to learn how to master the molecular mechanisms governing how the assembled systems evolve far from the equilibrium. Typically, this represents a daunting challenge due to the limited molecular insight that can be obtained by the experiments or by classical modeling approaches. Here we combine coarse-grained molecular models and advanced simulation approaches to study at submolecular (<5 Å) resolution a supramolecular tubule, which breaks and disassembles upon absorption of light energy triggering isomerization of its azobenzene-containing monomers. Our approach allows us to investigate the molecular mechanism of monomer transition in the assembly and to elucidate the kinetic process for the accumulation of the transitions in the system. Despite the stochastic nature of the excitation process, we demonstrate how these tubules preferentially dissipate the absorbed energy locally via the amplification of defects in their supramolecular structure. We find that this constitutes the best kinetic pathway for accumulating monomer transitions in the system, which determines the dynamic evolution out-of-equilibrium and the brittle behavior of the assembly under perturbed conditions. Thanks to the flexibility of our models, we finally come out with a general principle, where defects explain and control the brittle/soft behavior of such light-responsive assemblies.",Adding Solvent into Ionic Liquid-Gated Transistor: The Anatomy of Enhanced Gating Performance.,https://www.ncbi.nlm.nih.gov/pubmed/30875194,ACS applied materials & interfaces,2019 04 15,"Most studies of ionic liquid (IL)-gated field effect transistors (FETs) focus on the extremely large electric field and capacitance induced in liquid/solid interfaces and correspondingly the significantly enhanced carrier density in semiconductors, which can appreciably improve the gating performance. However, how to boost the switching speed, another key property of gating performance of FETs, has been rarely explored. In this work, the gating performance of molybdenum disulfide (MoS2) FETs, gated by the mixtures of IL/organic solvent (1-butyl-3-methylimidazolium tetrafluoroborate/acetonitrile, [Bmim][BF4]/ACN) at different ion concentrations, is investigated for both dynamic and static properties by a combination of molecular dynamics simulation and resistance network analysis. Results reveal that organic solvent can speed up the IL response time by a factor of about 40 times at the optimal ion concentration of 1.94 M, which is mainly attributed to the increased ionic conductivity of IL via the addition of organic solvent. Meanwhile, the surface charge distribution of MoS2 becomes more homogenous after the addition of organic solvent, which increases the conductivity of MoS2 by up to 2.4 times. Surprisingly, the optimal ion concentration for increased switching speed is nearly the same as that for achieving the highest MoS2 conductivity. Thus, our findings provide a strategy to simultaneously improve the dynamic and static gating performance of IL-gated FETs as well as a modeling technique to screen out the ideal ion concentration.",Engineering NaV1.7 Inhibitory JzTx-V Peptides with a Potency and Basicity Profile Suitable for Antibody Conjugation To Enhance Pharmacokinetics.,https://www.ncbi.nlm.nih.gov/pubmed/30875193,ACS chemical biology,2019 04 19,"Drug discovery research on new pain targets with human genetic validation, including the voltage-gated sodium channel NaV1.7, is being pursued to address the unmet medical need with respect to chronic pain and the rising opioid epidemic. As part of early research efforts on this front, we have previously developed NaV1.7 inhibitory peptide-antibody conjugates with tarantula venom-derived GpTx-1 toxin peptides with an extended half-life (80 h) in rodents but only moderate in vitro activity (hNaV1.7 IC50 = 250 nM) and without in vivo activity. We identified the more potent peptide JzTx-V from our natural peptide collection and improved its selectivity against other sodium channel isoforms through positional analogueing. Here we report utilization of the JzTx-V scaffold in a peptide-antibody conjugate and architectural variations in the linker, peptide loading, and antibody attachment site. We found conjugates with 100-fold improved in vitro potency relative to those of complementary GpTx-1 analogues, but pharmacokinetic and bioimaging analyses of these JzTx-V conjugates revealed a shorter than expected plasma half-life in vivo with accumulation in the liver. In an attempt to increase circulatory serum levels, we sought the reduction of the net +6 charge of the JzTx-V scaffold while retaining a desirable NaV in vitro activity profile. The conjugate of a JzTx-V peptide analogue with a +2 formal charge maintained NaV1.7 potency with 18-fold improved plasma exposure in rodents. Balancing the loss of peptide and conjugate potency associated with the reduction of net charge necessary for improved target exposure resulted in a compound with moderate activity in a NaV1.7-dependent pharmacodynamic model but requires further optimization to identify a conjugate that can fully engage NaV1.7 in vivo.",Lotus Seedpod-Derived Hard Carbon with Hierarchical Porous Structure as Stable Anode for Sodium-Ion Batteries.,https://www.ncbi.nlm.nih.gov/pubmed/30875192,ACS applied materials & interfaces,2019 04 05,"Hard carbon material is one of the candidates with great promise as anode-active material for sodium-ion batteries (SIBs). Here, new types of biomass-derived hard carbons were obtained via one-step carbonization of lotus seedpods at 1000-1400 °C, respectively. The control of carbonization temperature proved to be significant in controlling the lattice characterization of lotus seedpod-derived hard carbon. Higher temperature generally promoted the lattice graphitization and thus generated a more narrowed d-interlayer space with limited pore volume. The hard carbon pyrolyzed at 1200 °C achieved an optimized reversible capacity of 328.8 mAh g-1 and exhibited a remarkable capacity retention of 90% after 200 cycles. In addition, such a biomass-derived hard carbon presented improved cyclic stability and rate performance, revealing capacity of 330.6, 288.9, 216.9, 116.5, and 78.3 mAh g-1 at 50, 100, 200, 500, and 1000 mA g-1, respectively. Intrinsically, high pyrolysis temperature (1400 °C) gave rise to more narrowed carbon lattice and reduced pore volume and, thus, failed to accommodate sodium ions either from the intercalation into lattice or the ion adsorption onto the pore surface. Such combined advantages of lotus seedpod-derived hard carbon, including the abundance, sufficiently adequate reversible capacity, and prominent cycling and rate property allowed for its large-scale application as promising anode material for SIBs.",Self-Powered Direct Muscle Stimulation Using a Triboelectric Nanogenerator (TENG) Integrated with a Flexible Multiple-Channel Intramuscular Electrode.,https://www.ncbi.nlm.nih.gov/pubmed/30875191,ACS nano,2019 03 27,"Muscle function loss can result from multiple nervous system diseases including spinal cord injury (SCI), stroke, and multiple sclerosis (MS). Electrical muscle stimulation is clinically employed for rehabilitative and therapeutic purpose and typically requires mA-level stimulation current. Here, we report electrical muscle stimulation, which is directly powered by a stacked-layer triboelectric nanogenerator (TENG) through a flexible multiple-channel intramuscular electrode. This multiple-channel intramuscular electrode allows mapping of motoneurons that is sparsely distributed in the muscle tissue and thus enables high efficiency TENG muscle stimulation, although the short-circuit current of the TENG is only 35 μA. With a stimulation efficiency matrix, we find the electrical muscle stimulation efficiency is affected by two factors, namely, the electrode-motoneuron position, and the stimulation waveform polarity. To test whether it is a universal phenomenon for electrical stimulation, we then further investigate with the conventional square wave current stimulation and confirm that the stimulation efficiency is also affected by these two factors. Thus, we develop a self-powered direct muscle stimulation system with a TENG as power source and waveform generator, and a multiple-channel intramuscular electrode to allow motoneuron mapping for stimulation efficiency optimization. We believe such self-powered system could be potentially used for rehabilitative and therapeutic purpose to treat muscle function loss.",Optical Nanoprinting of Colloidal Particles and Functional Structures.,https://www.ncbi.nlm.nih.gov/pubmed/30875190,ACS nano,2019 04 26,"Recent advances in chemical sciences have enabled the tailorable synthesis of colloidal particles with variable composition, size, shape, and properties.

In this review, we summarize recent progress in optical nanoprinting of colloidal particles and its related applications. Diverse techniques based on different physical mechanisms, including optical forces, light-controlled electric fields, optothermal effects, laser-directed thermocapillary flows, and photochemical reactions, are discussed in detail.

However, further improving the PCEs of PSCs is challenged by material properties, device stability, and packaging technologies. Here, we report a new approach to increase the PCEs of flexible PSCs via introducing the piezo-phototronic effect in the PSCs by growing an array of ZnO nanowires on flexible plastic substrates, which act as the electron-transport layer for PSCs. From the piezo-phototronic effect, the absolute PCE was improved from 9.3 to 12.8% for flexible perovskite solar cells under a static mechanical strain of 1.88%, with a ∼40% enhancement but no change in the components of materials and device structure. A corresponding working model was proposed to elucidate the strategy to boost the performance of the PSCs. These findings present a general approach to improve PCEs of flexible PSCs without changing their fundamental materials.",Remarkable Output Power Density Enhancement of Triboelectric Nanogenerators via Polarized Ferroelectric Polymers and Bulk MoS2 Composites.,https://www.ncbi.nlm.nih.gov/pubmed/30875188,ACS nano,2019 04 24,"Performance enhancement of triboelectric nanogenerators (TENGs) has been largely limited by the relatively low output current density. Thus, extensive research efforts have been made to increase the output current density. In this respect, this work presents a method to effectively increase output current density of TENGs by adopting polarized ferroelectric polymers and MoS2 composite. Specifically, by compositing bulk MoS2 flakes with both Nylon-11 and PVDF-TrFE, respectively, charge density of each triboelectric charging surface was significantly increased. In addition, proper polarization of both ferroelectric composite layers has also led to an additional increase in the charge density. A combination of them synergistically increases the surface charge density, generating huge output current and the power output density. By optimizing the fabrication process, the output voltage and current density up to ∼145 V and ∼350 μA/cm2 are achieved, respectively. Consequently, the TENG exhibits a recordable output power density of ∼50 mW/cm2, which is one of the highest output power densities reported to date. The method introduced in this work can greatly increase the output current density of TENGs, facilitating the development of high-performance triboelectric energy harvesting devices.","Assisted Reproductive Techniques in Latin America: The Latin American Registry, 2015.",https://www.ncbi.nlm.nih.gov/pubmed/30875187,JBRA assisted reproduction,2019 05 21,"What was the utilization, effectiveness and safety of assisted reproductive technologies (ART) performed in Latin American countries during 2015, and what were the regional trends?"

While multiple studies have assessed test-retest reproducibility of automated white matter parcellations using cortical-parcellation-based strategies, there are no existing studies of test-retest reproducibility of fiber clustering parcellation. In this work, we perform what we believe is the first study of fiber clustering white matter parcellation test-retest reproducibility. The assessment is performed on three test-retest diffusion MRI datasets including a total of 255 subjects across genders, a broad age range (5-82 years), health conditions (autism, Parkinson's disease and healthy subjects), and imaging acquisition protocols (three different sites). A comprehensive evaluation is conducted for a fiber clustering method that leverages an anatomically curated fiber clustering white matter atlas, with comparison to a popular cortical-parcellation-based method. The two methods are compared for the two main white matter parcellation applications of dividing the entire white matter into parcels (i.e., whole brain white matter parcellation) and identifying particular anatomical fiber tracts (i.e., anatomical fiber tract parcellation). Test-retest reproducibility is measured using both geometric and diffusion features, including volumetric overlap (wDice) and relative difference of fractional anisotropy. Our experimental results in general indicate that the fiber clustering method produced more reproducible white matter parcellations than the cortical-parcellation-based method."

In Type I CRISPR-Cas systems, protospacer recognition can lead to «primed adaptation» - acquisition of new spacers from in cis located sequences. Type I CRISPR-Cas systems require the presence of a trinucleotide protospacer adjacent motif (PAM) for efficient interference. Here, we investigated the ability of each of 64 possible trinucleotides located at the PAM position to induce CRISPR interference and primed adaptation by the Escherichia coli Type I-E CRISPR-Cas system. We observed clear separation of PAM variants into three groups: those unable to cause interference, those that support rapid interference and those that lead to reduced interference that occurs over extended periods of time. PAM variants unable to support interference also did not support primed adaptation; those that supported rapid interference led to no or low levels of adaptation, while those that caused attenuated levels of interference consistently led to highest levels of adaptation. The results suggest that primed adaptation is fueled by the products of CRISPR interference. Extended over time interference with targets containing «attenuated» PAM variants provides a continuous source of new spacers leading to high overall level of spacer acquisition.",A Highly Active Bidentate Magnesium Catalyst for Amine-Borane Dehydrocoupling: Kinetic and Mechanistic Studies.,https://www.ncbi.nlm.nih.gov/pubmed/30875128,"Chemistry (Weinheim an der Bergstrasse, Germany)",2019 05 13,"A magnesium complex (1) featuring a bidentate aminopyridinato ligand is a remarkably selective catalyst for the dehydrocoupling of amine-boranes. This reaction proceeds to completion with low catalyst loadings (1 mol %) under mild conditions (60 °C), exceeding previously reported s-block systems in terms of selectivity, rate, and turnover number (TON). Mechanistic studies by in situ NMR analysis reveals the reaction to be first order in both catalyst and substrate. A reaction mechanism is proposed to account for these findings, with the high TON of the catalyst attributed to the bidentate nature of the ligand, which allows for reversible deprotonation of the substrate and regeneration of 1 as a stable resting state.",A New Understanding of the Role of IL-1 in Age-Related Intervertebral Disc Degeneration in a Murine Model.,https://www.ncbi.nlm.nih.gov/pubmed/30875127,Journal of bone and mineral research : the official journal of the American Society for Bone and Mineral Research,2019 05 29,"Increased cytokine expression, in particular interleukin-1β (IL-1β), is considered a hallmark of intervertebral disc degeneration. However, the causative relationship between IL-1 and age-dependent degeneration has not been established. To investigate the role of IL-1 in driving age-related disc degeneration, we studied the spine phenotype of global IL-1α/β double knockout (IL-1KO) mice at 12 and 20 months. Multiplex ELISA analysis of blood revealed significant reductions in the concentrations of IFN-γ, IL-5, IL-15, TNF-α, IP-10, and a trend of reduced concentrations of IL-10, macrophage inflammatory protein 1α (MIP-1α), keratinocyte chemoattractant/human growth-regulated oncogene (KC/GRO), and IL-6. However, the circulating level of MIP-2, a neutrophil chemoattractant, was increased in the IL-1KO. The alterations in systemic cytokine levels coincided with altered bone morphology-IL-1KO mice exhibited significantly thicker caudal cortical bone at 12 and 20 months. Despite these systemic inflammatory and bony changes, IL-1 deletion only minimally affected disc health. Both wild-type (WT) and IL-1KO mice showed age-dependent disc degeneration. Unexpectedly, rather than protecting the animals from degeneration, the aging phenotype was more pronounced in IL-1KO animals: knockout mice evidenced significantly more degenerative changes in the annulus fibrosis (AF) together with alterations in collagen type and maturity. At 20 months, there were no changes in nucleus pulposus (NP) extracellular matrix composition or cellular marker expression; however, the IL-1KO NP cells occupied a smaller proportion of the NP compartment that those of WT controls. Taken together, these results show that IL-1 deletion altered the systemic inflammatory environment and vertebral bone morphology. However, instead of protecting discs from age-related disc degeneration, global IL-1 deletion amplified the degenerative phenotype.",Concise Review: Targeting Cancer Stem Cells and Their Supporting Niche Using Oncolytic Viruses.,https://www.ncbi.nlm.nih.gov/pubmed/30875126,"Stem cells (Dayton, Ohio)",2019 05 30,"Cancer stem cells (CSCs) have the capacity to self-renew and differentiate to give rise to heterogenous cancer cell lineages in solid tumors.

We explore the ability of OVs to deliver combinations of immune-modulating therapeutic transgenes, such as immune checkpoint inhibitor antibodies. In particular, we highlight the advantages of virally encoded bi-specific T cell engagers (BiTEs) to not only target cell-surface markers on CSCs, but also tumor-associated antigens on contributing components of the surrounding TME and other cancer cells.

The appropriate molar ratios of TPABr/SiO2 and Si/Al as well as suitable crystallization temperature are the key factors for the formation of HZZ. The formation of the HZZ can be attributed to the existence of intrinsic density variation inside the initial amorphous aggregates and the Al zoning in the outer surface of the ZSM-5 particles. Amorphous silica with low crystallinity formed at early stages and low Al concentration, which has been subsequently dissolved and recrystallized on the ZSM-5 particle surface through Ostwald ripening, leading to the formation of HZZ. This approach, which uses a high concentration of SDA, will provide new possibilities and insight into the prospective fabrication of hollow zeolites.",The immunocytochemical expression of VE-1 (BRAF V600E-related) antibody identifies the aggressive variants of papillary thyroid carcinoma on liquid-based cytology.,https://www.ncbi.nlm.nih.gov/pubmed/30875124,Cytopathology : official journal of the British Society for Clinical Cytology,2019 04 23,"The recently introduced monoclonal V600E antibody (clone VE1) is likely to be an alternative strategy for detecting this mutation in thyroid lesions.

Currently, lecturers are implementing competency-based learning objectives in medical curricula around the world. Advancing teaching modalities need to be integrated into pharmacology courses in a reasonable way. At Ludwig-Maximilians-Universität (LMU) Munich Medical Faculty, a systematic evidence-based approach was used to modernize pharmacology classes. The needs assessment was conducted by final-year students. It included focus groups and a large-scale online survey, which was distributed among all medical students at LMU, with 1018 students participating (response rate 20%). Survey results showed that most of the students (92%) aimed to become pharmacology-adept doctors. Also, a majority (88%) stated that their goal was to understand the material most critical to application of pharmacology concepts as well as prescribing practice. Only 38% of the students reported satisfaction with the current curriculum, and 93% supported modernization. Thus far, pharmacology teaching at LMU Munich had mainly consisted of lectures attended by 200 students. Now, students advocated for a stronger integration of clinical pharmacology teaching into clinical subjects in the last 2 years of medical school. Specifically, they called for classes with smaller groups of students including problem-based learning as well as video podcasts. These results provided the foundation for change in curriculum at the LMU medical school. In conclusion, a structured approach for curriculum development that considers students' views is feasible and can reveal their actual goals and demands.

Although numerous studies have been performed to investigate the factors related to PONV, the effect of perioperative intravenous oxycodone on the incidence of PONV has not been well investigated. In this study, gynecological patients (grade I-II, aged 18-65 years, scheduled to undergo elective gynecological laparoscopic surgery under general anesthesia) were randomized to the oxycodone group or the sufentanil group. In the oxycodone group, patients received intravenous oxycodone for the induction and maintenance of anesthesia, as well as postoperative analgesia, while sufentanil was used in the sufentanil group. The primary outcome variable was the incidence of PONV. As secondary outcomes, time to first PONV, the rating of the most severe PONV, postoperative pain scores at different time points, hemodynamics, and side effects were evaluated. We found that, compared with sufentanil, oxycodone decreased the incidence of PONV by 13.5% (P = .041). The time to first vomiting was longer in the oxycodone group than in the sufentanil group. Postoperative pain scores at different time points and hemodynamics were comparable between the oxycodone and sufentanil groups. We concluded that the incidence of PONV in gynecological patients who underwent laparoscopic surgery was lower when using intravenous oxycodone for anesthesia induction, anesthesia maintenance, and postoperative analgesia than when using intravenous sufentanil.

Seventeen patients with T2DM underwent a meal tolerance test to examine the changes in vascular endothelial function and in glucose metabolism, both without exenatide and after a single subcutaneous injection of 10 μg exenatide. Vascular endothelial function was evaluated using reactive hyperemia index (RHI) measured by peripheral arterial tonometry before and 120 min after the meal loading test. The primary endpoint was the difference in changes in postprandial vascular endothelial function between the baseline and exenatide test. The results were analyzed in relation to the presence of absence of hypoglycemia. The natural logarithmically scaled RHI (L_RHI) was significantly lower after the baseline meal test but not in the exenatide test. Administration of exenatide caused symptomatic hypoglycemia in two patients during the meal tolerance test. The difference in the change in L_RHI was 0.125 ± 0.085 in the non-hypoglycemic group, whereas it was lower, - 0.487 ± 0.061, in the hypoglycemic group.

Recently, an unexpected formation of symmetric 3-substituted 2,1-benzisoxazoles through reduction of 5-(2-nitrobenzylidene)barbiturates has been described. This reductive intramolecular heterocyclization probably involves a nitroso intermediary. To improve the previous reaction conditions, the nature of the reducing agent and additives, reaction time and solvents were evaluated. By applying the optimized conditions, several symmetric and unsymmetric barbiturates C5-coupled with 2,1-benzisoxazoles were prepared with an yield of 52-87%. From this set, seven compounds were novel and the unsymmetric nature of the (thio)barbituric acid moiety was explored. For that, the total synthesis, starting from the respective urea or thiourea, was successfully performed, and 11 thiobarbiturates, benzylidene barbiturate and thiobarbiturate precursors are described.","Liver segmentation from low-radiation-dose pediatric computed tomography using patient-specific, statistical modeling.",https://www.ncbi.nlm.nih.gov/pubmed/30875059,International journal of computer assisted radiology and surgery,2019 03 15,"The pediatric computed tomography (CT) volume is acquired at a low dose because radiation is harmful to young children.

The bacterial taxonomic diversity and carbohydrate-active enzyme profile were estimated for samples taken from the small intestine, the large intestine, and the rectum of each animal. The bacterial diversity and abundance in the small intestine were lower than in the rectal and large intestinal samples. Analysis of the carbohydrate-active enzyme profiles at each site revealed a comparatively low abundance of enzymes targeting xylan and cellulose in all animals examined, similar to what has been reported earlier for sheep and therefore suggesting that plant cell wall digestion probably takes place elsewhere, such as in the rumen."

A characteristic feature of each cycle of the IN eye movement waveform is a period in which the eyes are moving at minimal velocity. This so-called ""foveation"" period has long been considered the basis for the best vision in individuals with IN. In recent years, the technology for measuring eye movements has improved considerably, but there remains the challenge of calibrating the direction of gaze in tracking systems when the eyes are continuously moving. Identifying portions of the nystagmus waveform suitable for calibration typically involves time-consuming manual selection of the foveation periods from the eye trace. Without an accurate calibration, the exact parameters of the waveform cannot be determined. In this study, we present an automated method for segmenting IN waveforms with the purpose of determining the foveation positions to be used for calibration of an eye tracker. On average, the ""point of regard"" was found to be within 0.21° of that determined by hand-marking by an expert observer. This method enables rapid clinical quantification of waveforms and the possibility of gaze-contingent research paradigms being performed with this patient group.","Immune-inflammatory, oxidative stress and biochemical biomarkers predict short-term acute ischemic stroke death.",https://www.ncbi.nlm.nih.gov/pubmed/30875023,Metabolic brain disease,2019 05 20,"The aim of the study was to define new immune-inflammatory, oxidative stress and biochemical biomarkers, which predict mortality within a period of 3 months after acute ischemic stroke (AIS). We recruited 176 healthy volunteers and 145 AIS patients, categorized as AIS survivors and non-survivors, and measured interleukin (IL)-6, high sensitivity C-reactive protein (hsCRP), ferritin, iron, total serum protein (TSP), erythrocyte sedimentation rate (ESR), white blood cells (WBC), 25 hydroxyvitamin D [25(OH)D], lipid hydroperoxides (CL-LOOH), insulin, glucose and high-density lipoprotein (HDL)-cholesterol. In patients, these biomarkers were measured within 24 h after AIS onset. We also computed two composite scores reflecting inflammatory indices, namely INFLAM index1 (sum of z scores of hsCRP+IL-6 + ferritin+ESR + WBC) and INFLAM index2 (z INFLAM index1 - z 25(OH)D - z iron + z TSP). Three months after AIS, non-survivors (n = 54) showed higher baseline levels of IL-6, hsCRP, ferritin and glucose and lower levels of HDL-cholesterol and 25(OH)D than survivors (n = 91). Non-survivors showed higher baseline ESR and lowered TSP than controls, while survivors occupied an intermediate position. Death after AIS was best predicted by increased IL-6, glucose, ferritin and CL-LOOH and lowered 25(OH)D levels. The area under the receiver operating curves computed on the INFLAM index1 and 2 scores were 0.851 and 0.870, respectively. In conclusion, activation of peripheral immune-inflammatory, oxidative and biochemical pathways is critically associated with mortality after AIS. Our results may contribute to identify new biomarker sets, which may predict post-stroke death, as well as suggest that IL-6 trans-signaling coupled with redox imbalances may be possible new targets in the prevention of short-term outcome AIS death.",Economic Evaluation of the 2016 Chinese Guideline and Alternative Risk Thresholds of Initiating Statin Therapy for the Management of Atherosclerotic Cardiovascular Disease.,https://www.ncbi.nlm.nih.gov/pubmed/30875022,PharmacoEconomics,2019 06 13,The 2016 Chinese guidelines for the management of dyslipidemia recommended mixed rules that centered around a 10% 10-year risk threshold to initiate statins for the primary prevention of atherosclerotic cardiovascular disease (ASCVD).

Migalastat (Galafold™), a pharmacological chaperone, stabilizes and facilitates trafficking of amenable mutant forms of α-galactosidase A enzyme from the endoplasmic reticulum to lysosomes and increases its lysosomal activity. Oral migalastat is the first pharmacological chaperone approved for treating patients [aged ≥ 18 years (USA and Canada) or ≥ 16 years in other countries] with Fabry disease who have a migalastat-amenable GLA mutation. In the FACETS trial in enzyme replacement therapy (ERT)-naive patients with GLA mutations amenable or non-amenable to migalastat, there was no significant difference between the migalastat and placebo groups for the proportion of patients achieving a ≥ 50% reduction in the number of globotriaosylceramide (GL-3) inclusions/kidney interstitial capillary (KIC) at 6 months [primary endpoint; intent-to-treat (ITT) population].

Alterations of spine density and morphology are associated with many neurological diseases. Understanding the molecular mechanisms underlying spine formation is important for understanding these diseases. Kalirin7 (Kal-7) is localized to the postsynaptic side of excitatory synapses in the neurons. Overexpression of Kal-7 causes an increase in spine density whereas knockdown expression of endogenous Kal-7 results in a decrease in spine density in primary cultured cortical neurons. However, the mechanisms underlying Kal-7-mediated spine formation are not entirely clear. Cyclin-dependent kinase 5 (Cdk5) plays a vital role in the formation of spines and synaptic plasticity. Kal-7 is phosphorylated by CDK5 at Thr1590, the unique Cdk5 phosphorylation site in the Kal-7 protein. This study was to explore the role of CDK5-mediated phosphorylation of Kal-7 in spine formation and the underlying mechanisms. Our results showed expression of Kal-7T/D (mimicked phosphorylation), Kal-7T/A mutants (blocked phosphorylation) or wild-type (Wt) Kal-7 caused in a similar increase in spine density, while spine size of Wt Kal-7-expressing cortical neurons was bigger than that in Kal-7 T\A-expressing neurons, but smaller than that in Kal-7T/D-expressing neurons. The fluorescence intensity of NMDA receptor subunit NR2B (GluN2B) staining was stronger along the MAP2 positive dendrites of Kal-7T/D-expressing neurons than that in Kal-7T/A- or Wt Kal-7-expressing neurons. The fluorescence intensity of AMPA receptor subunit GluR1 (GluA1) staining showed the same trend as GluN2B staining. These findings suggest that Cdk5 affects the function of Kal-7 on spine morphology and function via GluN2B and GluA1 receptors during dendritic spine formation.",Quantitative analysis of retinal microcirculation in optical coherence tomography angiography in cases with Behçet's disease without ocular involvement.,https://www.ncbi.nlm.nih.gov/pubmed/30875015,International ophthalmology,2019 03 15,To evaluate the retinal vascular plexus and choriocapillaris structures in patients with non-ocular Behçet's disease (BD) using optical coherence tomography angiography (OCTA).,Coincidental Detection of Gastrointestinal Stromal Tumors During Laparoscopic Bariatric Procedures-Data and Treatment Strategy of a German Reference Center.,https://www.ncbi.nlm.nih.gov/pubmed/30875013,Obesity surgery,2019 06 10,Intraoperative pathologic findings during bariatric surgery are relatively rare.

Lipoprotein apheresis is currently the only efficient way to lower lipoprotein(a) levels. Lipoprotein(a) apheresis has been shown to reduce major coronary events in patients with CAD. There is increasing evidence that lipoprotein(a) apheresis also reduces the rate of major adverse limb events such as peripheral revascularizations and amputations in PAD patients, and improves symptoms of PAD such as pain on exertion.

We investigated a range of predictors categorised into four groups as claimant, injury, and employment characteristics and claim management. The RTW and sustaining at work are outcomes of interest. To evaluate the predictors, we use Chi-squared test and logistic regression modelling. Also, we prioritized the predictors using Akaike Information Criterion (AIC) measure and Cross-validation error. Four predictive models are developed using significant predictors for OES and NES users to predict RTW and sustainability. We examined the multicollinearity of the developed models using Variance Inflation Factor (VIF). Results About 75% and 60% of OES users achieved RTW and have been sustained at work respectively, whilst just approximately 30% of NES users have been placed at a new employer and 25% of them have been sustained at work. The predictors which have the most association with OES and NES outcomes are the use of psychiatric services and age groups respectively. We found that having mental conditions is as an important indicator to allocate injured workers into OES or NES initiatives. Our study shows that injured workers with mental issues do not always have lower RTW rate. They just need special consideration. Conclusion Understanding the predictors of RTW and sustainability helps to develop interventions to ensure sustained RTW. This study will assist decision makers to improve design and implementation of OR services and tailor services according to clients' needs.",Small vessel disease and clinical outcomes after endovascular treatment in acute ischemic stroke.,https://www.ncbi.nlm.nih.gov/pubmed/30874998,Neurological sciences : official journal of the Italian Neurological Society and of the Italian Society of Clinical Neurophysiology,2019 06 10,"Pre-existing small vessel disease (SVD) has been associated with poor functional outcomes in patients with acute ischemic stroke treated with intravenous thrombolysis; however, there are scarce data in patients treated with endovascular therapy.

We sought to evaluate if plasma concentrations of the antipsychotic risperidone can be used as a predictor of treatment adherence and to identify the optimal plasma concentration threshold to reliably distinguish between adherent and non-adherent patients. A population pharmacokinetic model was used to simulate plasma risperidone steady-state trough concentrations in 1000 virtual patients, where 60% of the patients were 100% adherent to their medication, while 40% of the patients were non-adherent to their medication. The probability of adherence was assessed by receiver operating characteristic (ROC) analysis on Ctrough. The area under the ROC curve (AUCROC) was used to identify the optimal Ctrough threshold. Single vs multiple Ctrough at steady state was also evaluated. After a single risperidone Ctrough measurement, the AUCROC (95% CI) was estimated to be 0.71 (0.69-0.72) and the optimal Ctrough threshold accounting for the lowest number of adherent and non-adherent misclassifications was estimated to be 11.9 ng/mL. After multiple Ctrough measurements, the AUCROC (95% CI) increased up to 0.85 (0.84-0.87) for three Ctrough measurements. The optimal probability threshold to reliably discriminate between adherent and non-adherent patients was estimated to be 0.51. Using this model which is reflective of typical adherence to antipsychotic medication, we found that three consecutive steady-state Ctrough measurements are needed for an accurate and precise diagnostic test to discriminate between patients who are adherent or non-adherent to treatment.",Release Adjustment of Two Drugs with Different Solubility Combined in a Matrix Tablet.,https://www.ncbi.nlm.nih.gov/pubmed/30874996,AAPS PharmSciTech,2019 04 29,"The objective of this study was to modify the release of two drugs having different solubility in a combined matrix tablet as a fixed-dose combination for extended release. Propranolol HCl (freely soluble) and carbamazepine (very slightly soluble) were used as model drugs, water-soluble hydroxypropyl methylcellulose (HPMC) and water-insoluble ethylcellulose (EC) were used as matrix-forming polymers. Tablets were prepared by direct compression of powder blends, or propranolol HCl was first granulated with one of the matrix-forming polymers (1:1) followed by compression with carbamazepine and matrix former. Propranolol HCl release from directly compressed tablets was faster than carbamazepine because of its higher solubility. The release of both drugs was fast when HPMC-propranolol HCl granules were compressed with carbamazepine into EC matrix tablet. Conversely, the release of both drugs was decreased when HPMC-propranolol HCl granules and carbamazepine were compressed into HPMC matrices. The desired release of both drugs was approached when EC-propranolol HCl granules were compressed with carbamazepine into HPMC matrix. Erosion of the HPMC matrix and, therefore, drug release were adjusted by varying the molecular weight of HPMC. A burst release of propranolol HCl decreased when it was granulated with EC in a fluidized bed coater followed by compression with carbamazepine into HPMC matrix.",Racial and Ethnic Disparities in HIV Pre-exposure Prophylaxis Awareness Among Men Who have Sex with Men.,https://www.ncbi.nlm.nih.gov/pubmed/30874995,AIDS and behavior,2019 06 10,"Racial and ethnic disparities exist in HIV pre-exposure prophylaxis (PrEP) awareness and care.

Hence honey bees are often exposed to these pesticides. But until now, the effects of theses combinations at field-realistic doses on honey bee health have been poorly investigated. In this study, we explore the synergistic mortality and some physiological effects in surviving honey bees after chronic oral exposure to acetamiprid and/or propiconazole in the laboratory. The results indicated that chronic combined exposure to acetamiprid and propiconazole produced a significant synergistic effect on mortality both for newly emerged bees (50% mortality in 7.2 days) and forager bees (50% mortality in 4.8 days). Honey bee weight of newly emerged bees was decreased after feeding food with a field concentration of acetamiprid and propiconazole, alone or combined for 10 days. Combination of acetamiprid and propiconazole also modulated the activities of P450s, GST and CAT in newly emerged bees and forager bees than either alone, but neither pesticide affected the activity of AChE. These results show that chronic combined exposure to pesticides of relatively low toxicity may caused severely physiological disruptions that could be potentially damaging for the honey bees."

We compared neuroprotective properties of several agents using an in vitro model of terminally differentiated human cells NT2-N derived from cell line NT2/D1. Sodium azide and an active metabolite of amifostine (WR1065) increase cell viability in simultaneous treatment with cisplatin. In addition, WR1065 protects the non-dividing neurons by decreasing cisplatin caused oxidative stress and apoptosis. Accumulation of Pt in cisplatin-treated cells was heterogeneous, but the frequency and concentration of Pt in cells were lowered in the presence of WR1065 as shown by X-ray fluorescence microscopy (XFM). Transition metals accumulation accompanied Pt increase in cells; this effect was equally diminished in the presence of WR1065. To analyze possible chemical modulation of Pt-DNA bonds, we examined the platinum LIII near edge spectrum by X-ray absorption spectroscopy. The spectrum found in cisplatin-DNA samples is altered differently by the addition of either WR1065 or sodium azide. Importantly, a similar change in Pt edge spectra was noted in cells treated with cisplatin and WR1065. Therefore, amifostine should be reconsidered as a candidate for treatments that reduce or prevent CIPN.",Early vessel healing after implantation of biodegradable-polymer and durable-polymer drug-eluting stent: 3-month angioscopic evaluation of the RESTORE registry.,https://www.ncbi.nlm.nih.gov/pubmed/30874980,The international journal of cardiovascular imaging,2019 06 13,"The purpose of this study was to evaluate the vessel healing status 3 months after stent implantation of bioresorbable-polymer drug-eluting stents (BP-DESs) in comparison with durable-polymer DESs (DP-DESs) by angioscopy. Study design was a single-center all-comer prospective cohort study: the RESTORE registry (UMIN000033009). All patients who received successful angioscopic examination at planned 3-month follow-up after the DES implantation in the native coronary artery were enrolled. We evaluated main, maximum, minimum strut coverage grades and coverage heterogeneity score defined as a difference between maximum and minimum coverage grades. All lesions were divided into three segments: proximal, mid, and distal segments. A total of 108 patients (66.6 ± 10 years) with 124 lesions were analyzed (BP-DES 57 patients 61 lesions 226 segments vs. DP-DES 57 patients 63 lesions 203 segments; six patients had both BP-DES and DP-DES). Patient and lesion demographics, procedural characteristics were well balanced. Main coverage grade (mean ± standard error; 1.08 ± 0.02 vs. 1.05 ± 0.03, p = 0.354) and minimum coverage grade (1.00 ± 0.00 vs. 1.00 ± 0.00, p > 0.999) were not significantly different between BP-DES and DP-DES groups. Maximum coverage grade was significantly higher in the BP-DES than in the DP-DES (1.45 ± 0.04 vs. 1.35 ± 0.04, p = 0.049). Coverage heterogeneity score did not differ between BP-DES and DP-DES groups (1.05 ± 0.07 vs. 0.90 ± 0.07, p = 0.162). At 3-month follow-up, the current BP-DES had higher maximum stent coverage than the contemporary DP-DES, while main and minimum coverage grades and heterogeneity of the neointimal coverage were comparable.

CT calcium scoring (CTCS) allows detection and quantification of coronary artery calcification (CAC). The NPV of combined SE and CTCS for CAD is not well defined. Consecutive patients from the executive screening program who underwent exercise SE and concomitant CTCA were retrospectively identified between January 2010 and December 2014. Patients with normal SE and CAC score of zero were determined, and the presence or absence of any CAD (obstructive or non-obstructive plaques) on CTCA was confirmed. The NPV of combined SE and CTCS was then re-tested using a validation cohort of subsequent consecutive patients enrolled between January 2015 and July 2018. The initial cohort consisted of 173 patients (19% age > 65 years, 19% diabetic); 40% had normal CTCA, 48% with non-obstructive CTCA (77 with CAC score > 0), and 12% with obstructive CTCA (all with CAC score > 0). There were 16 (9.2%) patients with inducible ischemia on SE. A normal SE had a 93% NPV to exclude obstructive CAD but only 42% NPV to exclude any CAD. A combined normal SE and CTCS had a 100% NPV for obstructive CAD, and 92% for any CAD. In a validation cohort of 111 patients, a normal SE and CAC score of zero had NPV of 100% for obstructive CAD and 92% for any CAD. The combined cohort consisted of predominately low Framingham risk patients; more than 40% (70/181) had CAC score > 0 and 5/70 had obstructive CAD, with the remaining non-obstructive. A concomitant normal SE and CAC score of zero excluded obstructive CAD (NPV 100%) and any CAD in 92% of the testing and validation cohorts.

This study examined generational differences and similarities in narrative accounts of PrEP among a diverse sample of 89 gay and bisexual men in the U.S. Over 50% of men in the older (52-59 years) and younger (18-25 years) generations endorsed positive views, compared with 32% of men in the middle (34-41 years) generation. Men in the middle cohort expressed the most negative (21%) and ambivalent (47%) views of PrEP. Thematic analysis of men's narratives revealed three central stories about the perceived impact of PrEP: (1) PrEP has a positive impact on public health by preventing HIV transmission (endorsed more frequently by men in the older and younger cohorts); (2) PrEP has a positive effect on gay and bisexual men's sexual culture by decreasing anxiety and making sex more enjoyable (endorsed more frequently by men in the middle and younger cohorts); and (3) PrEP has a negative impact on public health and sexual culture by increasing condomless, multi-partner sex (endorsed more frequently by men in the middle and younger cohorts). Results are discussed in terms of the significance of generation cohort in meanings of sexual health and culture and implications for public health approaches to PrEP promotion among gay and bisexual men.",Sexual Behaviors and Health Practices Among Student Service Members and Veterans.,https://www.ncbi.nlm.nih.gov/pubmed/30874977,Archives of sexual behavior,2019 04 09,"The purpose of the study was to determine whether veteran students and non-veteran students differed in their sexual behaviors and health practices and, furthermore, whether or not those differences were gender specific. Demographic characteristics of the study sample were explored by calculating frequencies and percentages by military service status. Research questions were explored with maximum likelihood multiple logistic regression. Results showed that student veterans were more likely than non-veteran students to have sex with multiple partners, with males and transgender students more likely than females to report multiple sexual partners. Student veterans were more likely than non-veterans to perform a self-examination for either breast cancer or testicular cancer, with transgender students more likely than females to report having engaged in a self-examination. Student veterans were also more likely than non-veterans to have been vaccinated against HPV or Hepatitis B, with male students more likely than females to have been vaccinated. Furthermore, transgender student veterans were less likely than female veterans to have been vaccinated. Finally, male student veterans were more likely than female veterans to report an STI-related doctor visit, with transgender student veterans more likely than female veterans to report an STI-related doctor visit. College campuses are increasingly implementing student veteran-specific programs and services; however, little if any research specifically has explored ways in which safety and health can be promoted within university settings.

The literature on casual sex encounters among college students is growing, though most studies are cross-sectional and individual studies focus on few outcomes at a time, leaving piecemeal and mixed results. The current longitudinal study clarifies prior work by analyzing how post-event process (PEP), an understudied construct within the hookup literature, and emotional (i.e., positive or negative) hookup reactions interact to predict a breadth of outcomes, representing holistic student well-being. The inclusion of PEP reframes the current literature to consider PEP as a predictor variable of hookup outcomes, as moderated by emotional hookup reactions. This is consistent with literature indicating emotional experiences affect PEP across a variety of incidents. Participants (N = 377, 87.6% female) completed self-report measures at 2-month intervals. We tested relationships between the main and interaction effects of PEP and emotional hookup reactions as a moderation regression analyses on anxiety, academic engagement, religious coping, and psychological flourishing. The main effect of PEP predicted more anxiety and less negative religious coping, negative hookup reactions predicted more anxiety, and positive hookup reactions predicted more flourishing. Regarding interaction effects, high levels of positive hookup reactions and PEP were associated with less anxiety, less academic engagement, more negative religious coping, and less psychological flourishing; high levels of negative hookup reactions and PEP were associated with less anxiety and more negative religious coping and were unrelated to academic engagement or flourishing over two months.",Carrier Redistribution Between Two Kinds of Localized States in the InGaN/GaN Quantum Wells Studied by Photoluminescence.,https://www.ncbi.nlm.nih.gov/pubmed/30874975,Nanoscale research letters,2019 04 07,"The InGaN/GaN multi-quantum wells (MQWs) are prepared at the same condition by metal-organic chemical vapor deposition (MOCVD) except the thickness of cap layers additionally grown on each InGaN well layer. The photoluminescence (PL) intensity of the thin cap layer sample is much stronger than that of thicker cap layer sample. Interestingly, the thick cap layer sample has two photoluminescence peaks under high excitation power, and the PL peak energy-temperature curves show an anomalous transition from reversed V-shaped to regular S-shaped with increasing excitation power. Meanwhile, it exhibits a poorer thermal stability of thick cap layer sample under higher excitation power than that under lower excitation power. Such an untypical phenomenon is attributed to carrier redistribution between the two kinds of localized states which is induced by the inhomogeneous distribution of indium composition in thick cap layer sample. Furthermore, the luminescence of deep localized states has a better thermal stability, and the luminescence of shallow localized states has a poor thermal stability. In fact, such a severer inhomogeneous indium distribution may be caused by the degradation of subsequent epitaxial growth of InGaN/GaN MQWs region due to longer low-temperature GaN cap layer growth time.",Bradykinin receptor deficiency or antagonism do not impact the host response during gram-negative pneumonia-derived sepsis.,https://www.ncbi.nlm.nih.gov/pubmed/30874974,Intensive care medicine experimental,2019 04 07,"Kinins are short peptides with a wide range of proinflammatory properties that are generated from kininogens in the so-called kallikrein-kinin system.

Vascular endothelial growth factor receptor (VEGFR)-targeted therapeutics-loaded mesoporous silica nanoparticles represent a major advance for angiogenesis imaging and inhibition in lethal cancers. In the present study, we aimed to assess whether 131I-labeled anti-VEGFR2 targeted mesoporous silica nanoparticles would have antitumor efficacy in an ATC tumor-bearing nude mouse model. Using in vitro and in vivo studies, we investigated the increased targeting ability and retention time in the anti-VEGFR2 targeted group using confocal microscopy and a γ counter. The tumor tissue radioactivity of the anti-VEGFR2 targeted group at 24 and 72 h after intratumoral injection was significantly higher than that of the non-targeted groups (all P < 0.05). Moreover, we found that radioactive accumulation was obvious even at 3 week post-injection in the anti-VEGFR2 targeted group via single-photon emission computed tomography/computed tomography, which was not seen at 3 day post-injection in the Na131I group. Meanwhile, compared with the non-targeted group, tumor growth in the targeted group was significantly inhibited, without causing apparent systemic toxic effects. Additionally, the median survival time in the targeted group (41 days) was significantly prolonged compared with that in the non-targeted (34 days) or Na131I (25 days) groups (both P < 0.01). Our data support the view that the as-developed 131I-labeled anti-VEGFR2 targeted mesoporous silica nanoparticles showed promising results in ATC tumor-bearing mouse model and such an approach might represent a novel therapeutic option for ATC.",Cellular and Molecular Differences Between Area CA1 and the Dentate Gyrus of the Hippocampus.,https://www.ncbi.nlm.nih.gov/pubmed/30874972,Molecular neurobiology,2019 03 15,"A distinct feature of the hippocampus of the brain is its unidirectional tri-synaptic pathway originating from the entorhinal cortex and projecting to the dentate gyrus (DG) then to area CA3 and subsequently, area CA1 of the Ammon's horn.

In head and neck cancer, only a minority of patients respond to PD-1 therapy, but these small outcomes have fueled the enthusiasm for the next generation of immunotherapy-adoptive cell therapy-which employs recent advances in genetic engineering and cell culturing methods to generate T cells with enhanced anti-tumor efficacy for infusion back into the patient. Head and neck cancer is comprised of biologically distinct cancers, HPV-positive and HPV-negative, and the clinical responses to PD-1 inhibitors in both HPV-positive and HPV-negative head and neck patients have showcased better than any other cancer type that there are distinct pathways to immunogenicity that may lend themselves to different therapeutic approaches. Thus, head and neck cancer is uniquely poised to benefit from the personalized approach of adoptive cell therapy as well as provide a valuable platform to explore contrasting T cell modalities.

There are patients with markedly advanced local or regional disease who unfortunately will have a low probability of cure. We counsel these patients on induction chemotherapy, emphasizing that this is unlikely to result in a smaller volume of surgical resection. In these patients, a good response to induction chemotherapy is more frequently followed by concurrent chemoradiotherapy. We have not been in the practice of commonly recommending definitive chemoradiotherapy for locally advanced oral cancer when upfront surgery is an option. However, as reviewed below, there is a significant rationale for definitive chemoradiotherapy in patients who are surgical candidates, with the hope of good oncologic outcomes, and potential functional organ preservation.

A total of 602 South Asians living in NYC completed a community health needs and resource assessment and answered questions about the use of SLT. Multivariable logistic regression models were run to examine predictors of SLT use (ever and current use). A total of 28.2% South Asian individuals reported ever use of SLT (35.9% among men and 21.5% among women) and a total of 12.9% reported current use of SLT (16.5% among men and 9.7% among women). Logistic regression models were stratified by sex. Among men, factors associated with ever or current use included: Bangladeshi and Himalayan ethnic subgroup, speaking English very well, attending a religious service a few times a year (ever use only), and current or former cigarette smoking. Among women, factors associated with ever use included: Bangladeshi ethnic subgroup, self-reporting condition of mouth and teeth as fair/poor, and at risk for depression. No factors were significant among women for current use. Overall, prevalence of current and ever use of SLT is high, and important differences exist by sex. Future studies are needed to better understand SLT use patterns in South Asian communities in the US and to inform culturally relevant interventions aiming to decrease overall tobacco use.",READY: relative efficacy of loop diuretics in patients with chronic systolic heart failure-a systematic review and network meta-analysis of randomised trials.,https://www.ncbi.nlm.nih.gov/pubmed/30874955,Heart failure reviews,2019 06 13,"The majority of patients with chronic heart failure (HF) receive long-term treatment with loop diuretics.

NMA demonstrated no significant differences between loop diuretics with respect to all-cause mortality, cardiovascular mortality or hypokalaemia. In contrast, torasemide ranked best in terms of HF hospitalisation, and there was a trend towards benefits with torasemide with regard to occurrence of acute renal failure. Sensitivity analyses excluding trials with a follow-up < 6 months, trials with a cross-over design and those including < 25 patients confirmed the main results. We found no significant superiority of either loop diuretic with respect to mortality and safety endpoints. However, clinicians may prefer torasemide, as it was associated with fewer HF-related hospitalisations.","Natural history, clinical course and predictors of interval time from initial diagnosis to development of subsequent NSCLC brain metastases.",https://www.ncbi.nlm.nih.gov/pubmed/30874953,Journal of neuro-oncology,2019 04 29,"Non-small cell lung cancer (NSCLC) brain metastases are associated with substantial morbidity and mortality. During recent years, accompanying dramatic improvements in systemic disease control, NSCLC brain metastases have emerged as an increasingly relevant clinical problem.

Although less than 5% of cSCC patients develop metastases or local recurrence after complete excision, advanced cSCC is difficult to treat. These conditions tend to develop in elderly patients, although, at times, metastases are noted in middle-aged patients. Once metastasis occurs in cSCC, the 10-year survival rates fall to less than 20% for patients with regional lymph node involvement and less than 10% for patients with distant metastases, indicating that cSCC can be difficult to treat effectively when it is advanced. Traditionally, platinum-based therapy has been considered as a conventional option for advanced cSCC. It is efficacious to some degree, but the toxic effects of the combination treatments often prohibit their use in elderly patients. It has been a decade since the development of epidermal growth factor receptor (EGFR) inhibitors as agents that are less toxic. However, evidence regarding systemic therapy for advanced cSCC is limited because of a lack of high-quality prospective studies. Remarkably, the US Food and Drug Administration (FDA) approved an anti-PD-1 antibody treatment (cemiplimab) for the treatment of patients who are not candidates for curative surgery or curative radiation. It will be a promising treatment option for these types of rare conditions.","De novo structure determination of 3-((3-aminopropyl)amino)-4-hydroxybenzoic acid, a novel and abundant metabolite in Acinetobacter baylyi ADP1.",https://www.ncbi.nlm.nih.gov/pubmed/30874951,Metabolomics : Official journal of the Metabolomic Society,2019 04 24,"Metabolite identification remains a major bottleneck in the understanding of metabolism.

In this study, H. sativum was planted outdoors in one of the most fertile soils-Haplic Chernozem spiked with high concentration of Cu and examined between the boot and head emergence phase of growth. Copper toxicity was observed to cause slow ontogenetic development of plants, changing their morphometric parameters (shape, size, colour). To the best of our knowledge, the ultrastructural changes in roots, stems and leaves of H. sativum induced by excess Cu were fully characterized for the first time using transmission electron microscopy. The plant roots were the most effected, showing degradation of the epidermis, reduced number of parenchyma cells, as well as a significant decrease in the diameter of the stele and a disruption and modification to its cell structure. The comparative analysis of the ultrastructure of control plants and plants exposed to the toxic effects of Cu has made it possible to reveal significant disruption of the integrity of the cell wall and cytoplasmic membranes in the root with deposition of electron-dense material. The changes in the ultrastructure of the main cytoplasmic organelles-endoplasmic reticulum, mitochondria, chloroplasts and peroxisomes-in the stem and leaves were found. The cellular Cu deposition, anatomical and ultrastructural modifications could mainly account for the primary impact points of metal toxicity.

In this work, three pigmented bacteria from the Antarctic continent, named Arthrobacter agilis 50cyt, Zobellia laminarie 465, and Arthrobacter psychrochitiniphilus 366, were able to withstand UV-B and UV-C radiation. The pigments were extracted and tested for UV absorption, antioxidant capacity, photostability, and phototoxicity profile in murine fibroblasts (3T3 NRU PT-OECD TG 432) to evaluate their further potential use as UV filters. Furthermore, the pigments were identified by ultra-high-performance liquid chromatography-photodiode array detector-mass spectrometry (UPLC-PDA-MS/MS). The results showed that all pigments presented a very high antioxidant activity and good stability under exposure to UV light. However, except for a fraction of the A. agilis 50cyt pigment, they were shown to be phototoxic. A total of 18 different carotenoids were identified from 23 that were separated on a C18 column. The C50 carotenes bacterioruberin and decaprenoxanthin (including its variations) were confirmed for A. agilis 50cyt and A. psychrochitiniphilus 366, respectively. All-trans-bacterioruberin was identified as the pigment that did not express phototoxic activity in the 3T3 NRU PT assay (MPE < 0.1).

There are various histological variants of DFSP tumors and it often mimics benign lesions such as dermatofibroma and scar, which make accurate diagnosis difficult and delayed, and some cases progress to the stage where the tumor is unresectable. Recent advancements in cancer genetics and molecular biology methods have elucidated the COL1A1-PDGFB fusion gene, some novel fusion gene variants and pathways related to DFSP pathogenesis that have resulted in the evolution of cutaneous sarcoma diagnosis and treatment.

Stomach cancer is an increasing incidence of cancer both in the World as well as in Turkey. The most common method used worldwide for gastric cancer diagnosis is endoscopy. However, definitive diagnosis is made with endoscopic biopsy results. Diagnosis with endoscopy is a very specific and sensitive method. With high-resolution endoscopy it is possible to detect mild discolorations, bulges and structural changes of the surface of the mucosa. However, because the procedures are performed with the eye of a doctor, it is possible that the cancerous areas may be missed and / or incompletely detected. Because of the fact that the cancerous area cannot be completely detected may cause the problem of cancer recurrence after a certain period of surgical intervention. In order to overcome this problem, a computerized decision support system (CDS) has been implemented with the help of specialist physicians and image processing techniques. The performed CDS system works as an assistant to doctors of gastroenterology, helping to identify the cancerous area in the endoscopic images of the scaffold, to take biopsies from these areas and to make a better diagnosis. We believe that gastric cancer will be helpful in determining the area and biopsy samples taken from the patient will be useful in determining the area.

However, the differences in the influence of serum HDL-C levels on CKD progression in different subcohorts have rarely been examined in detail in previous studies. The aim of this study was to investigate the significance of low serum HDL-C levels as a predictor of disease progression in CKD patients according to sub-analyses using a cross-classified subcohort. We reviewed data obtained from 120 CKD patients. Prognostic factors for renal outcome were identified by the multivariate Cox proportional hazards method. Kaplan-Meier analysis was performed to assess disease progression, which was defined as a > 30% decline in the glomerular filtration rate (GFR), or end-stage renal disease. The mean age of the included participants was 58.3 ± 13.6 years. The subjects were divided into two groups (low HDL-C vs. high HDL-C). The median follow-up period was 112.8 months. The kidney survival rate in the low HDL-C group was significantly lower than that in the high HDL-C group (P < 0.0001). However, the age-stratified analysis showed no difference between the two groups in the cohort of patients ≥ 70 years old. Multivariate Cox regression analyses showed a significant association between low HDL-C [hazard ratio (HR) 4.80, P = 0.009] and a ≥ 30% eGFR decline or ESRD. This association was more evident in the cohort of patients < 70 years old (HR 4.96, P = 0.0165), especially the female subcohort (HR 13.86, P = 0.0033). Multivariate analysis showed a significant correlation between visceral fat area and serum HDL-C levels among both male (P = 0.0017) and female (P = 0.0449) patients. In a propensity score-matched cohort (patients < 70 years old), the kidney survival rate of CKD patients was significantly lower in the low HDL-C group than in the high HDL-C group (P = 0.0364). A low serum HDL-C level is a significant predictor of CKD progression, especially in female patients with CKD under 70 years of age.

Compared with the sham group, tachypacing alone also significantly increased the atrial fibrotic area (2.9 ± 0.1% vs. 7.8 ± 0.4%, p < 0.01), PAR2 expression (1.0 ± 0.1 vs. 1.8 ± 0.3, p < 0.05), and atrial fibronectin expression (1.0 ± 0.2 vs. 2.0 ± 0.2, p < 0.01). These responses were suppressed by edoxaban treatment (area 5.9 ± 0.4%, p < 0.01; PAR2 1.1 ± 0.1, p < 0.05; fibronectin 1.2 ± 0.2, p < 0.05 vs. placebo). Edoxaban showed suppressive effects on atrial remodeling, AF progression, and excessive expressions of PAR2 and fibronectin in a canine CHF model. The suppression of the Xa/PAR2 pathway might be a potential pharmacological target of edoxaban.",Cancer incidence in an Austrian alpine valley 1983-2012 : A descriptive study.,https://www.ncbi.nlm.nih.gov/pubmed/30874891,Wiener klinische Wochenschrift,2019 06 10,"After one of Austria's largest environmental scandals in 2014, which involved the release of hexachlorobenzene (HCB) in the Carinthian valley Görtschitztal, concerns about increased cancer rates have arísen in the affected local population. A descriptive study was conducted to examine the cancer incidence rates between 1983 and 2012. Data from the affected area (Görtschitztal, district St. Veit) were compared to data from the neighboring area within the same district and Carinthia excluding St. Veit, considering incidence rates of liver, lung, kidney, thyroid cancer and mesothelioma. Prostate cancer and carcinoma in situ were both included and excluded from overall cancer incidents in order to prevent potential bias due to screening programs. Considering the observed variability at an overall level, no conspicuous differences in cancer incidences could be found (Carinthia: 495, St. Veit West: 408, St. Veit East: 572 cases per 100,000 person-years in 2012). For some cancer types, e. g. liver, thyroid cancer and mesothelioma, the affected region showed a higher increase in rates than the neighboring area or Carinthia overall; however, these increased rates date back to a time prior to the HCB exposure, suggesting other carcinogenic influences, such as asbestos exposure from antecedent years.",Establishment of adaptability to the northern-limit of rice production.,https://www.ncbi.nlm.nih.gov/pubmed/30874890,Molecular genetics and genomics : MGG,2019 06 10,"The domestication of cultivated crops from their wild relatives narrowed down their genetic diversity in a bottleneck effect. Subsequently, the cultivation areas of crops have expanded all over the world into various environmental conditions from the original area along with human migration after domestication. Here, we demonstrated the genetic changes in the adaptation of rice to Hokkaido (41°2-45°3N latitude), Japan, from the tropics of their origin in Asian cultivated rice, Oryza sativa L. Although cultivated rice originated from the tropics, Hokkaido is one of the northern-limits of rice cultivation worldwide. Population genomics focusing on the local populations showed the varieties had genetically distinct classes with limited genetic diversity. In addition, some varieties in the class carried unique genotypes for flowering time, exhibiting extremely early flowering time. Certain mutations in unique genotypes can split off the varieties that are able to grow in Hokkaido. Furthermore, the changes in the genotype for flowering time during rice cultivation in Hokkaido demonstrated novel combinations of genes for flowering time owing to the intensive artificial selection on natural variation and rice breeding programs to achieve stable rice production in Hokkaido.",Prognostic relevance of programmed cell death-ligand 1 expression and CD8+ TILs in rectal cancer patients before and after neoadjuvant chemoradiotherapy.,https://www.ncbi.nlm.nih.gov/pubmed/30874889,Journal of cancer research and clinical oncology,2019 04 15,"Radiotherapy has been recently reported to boost the therapeutic response of immune checkpoint blockade (ICB); however, few studies have focused on programmed cell death-ligand 1 (PD-L1) expression in locally advanced rectal cancer (LARC) patients who receive preoperative neoadjuvant chemoradiotherapy (neoCRT).

Application of these strategies showed that different feeding profiles result in different dynamic behaviour, influencing both, yield and biopolymer properties. As offline-based feeding strategies do not consider information of the culture status, they cannot deal with uncertainties. Therefore, a closed loop control strategy was implemented, which uses biomass and substrate information predicted online by soft-sensors. Results demonstrated the technical feasibility to produce biopolymer using a 75/25%vol. vinasses-molasses mixture. Successful implementation of the soft-sensor-based control strategy was evidenced at pilot plant scale, where sugar concentration was kept almost constant for 14 h, while obtaining the desired copolymer.

Among TLRs, TLR2 is functional in all vertebrates and has high ability in detecting bacterial and viral pathogen ligands. The mammals' phylogenetic tree of TLR2 showed longer branches for the Lagomorpha clade, raising the hypothesis that lagomorphs experienced an acceleration of the mutation rate. This hypothesis was confirmed by (i) Tajima's test of neutrality that revealed different evolutionary rates between lagomorphs and the remaining mammals with lagomorphs presenting higher nucleotide diversity; (ii) genetic distances were similar among lagomorphs and between lagomorphs and other mammals; and (iii) branch models reinforced the existence of an acceleration of the mutation rate in lagomorphs.

Allocentric images (third-person perspective; 3PP) take longer to identify than egocentric images (first-person perspective; 1PP), supporting that implicit motor imagery (IMI)-mentally manoeuvring one's body to match the shown posture-is used. While numerous cognitive processes are involved during LRJs, it remains unclear whether features of the individual (e.g., visual exposure, experience, task-dependent use) influence the type of recognition strategy used during LRJs (IMI versus non-IMI). To investigate whether an individual's routine visual exposure to hands/feet in 3PP disrupts the typical perspective-reaction time (RT) relationship in LRJs, hand therapists, podiatrists, and healthy controls completed online LRJ tasks of hand and feet images. A group-specific reduction in RT for only allocentric images would represent a switch to non-IMI strategies. The results show that routine visual exposure to feet in 3PP (podiatrists) results in quicker RTs only for allocentric images of feet, suggesting a switch from IMI to non-IMI (e.g., visual object-based recognition) strategies. In contrast, routine visual exposure to hands in 3PP (hand therapists) does not alter RT for allocentric images, suggesting maintenance of IMI. However, hand therapists have quicker RTs (vs other groups) for egocentric hand images, supporting enhanced sensorimotor processing for the hand, consistent with task-dependent use (precise hand use). Higher accuracy in health professionals (vs control) on both tasks supports enhanced body schema. Combined, this suggests that 3PP visual exposure to body parts and task-dependent use contribute to LRJ performance/recognition strategy.",New information on the effects of transcranial direct current stimulation on n-back task performance.,https://www.ncbi.nlm.nih.gov/pubmed/30874858,Experimental brain research,2019 06 12,"The n-back task is prototypical tool widely used to evaluate working memory (WM) abilities in healthy and clinical populations. Previous studies finding beneficial effects of transcranial direct current stimulation (tDCS) over the dorsal lateral prefrontal cortex (DLPFC) on n-back task performance were limited by the number of n-back ""memory loads"" utilized and the assessment of performance only immediately following stimulation. Our aims were to investigate both the immediate and lasting effects of six sessions of bilateral tDCS over the DLPFC on n-back performance. We used a 1-, 2-, 3-, and 4-back shaped WM task at three time points: pre-stimulation (T1), immediately following a final (6th) stimulation (T2), and 1 month following the final stimulation (T3). Twenty-five right-handed participants were randomly assigned to active or sham stimulation. Performance was evaluated by percentage hits, false alarms, and reaction times (RTs) for correct responses. Results showed lack of improvement in all outcome measures for both groups at T2. Except for general faster RT in the active group, no lasting effect on percentage hits and false alarms was found for all memory loads among both groups at T3. However, lenient analysis indicated improvement in RT for the 1-back memory load among the active group from T1 to T3. These results question the previously found effectiveness of tDCS over the DLPFC in improving short-term n-back performance and cast doubt on its long-term effectiveness.",[Recent developments in head and neck immunology : A basis for novel therapeutic strategies?],https://www.ncbi.nlm.nih.gov/pubmed/30874856,HNO,2019 04 08,"Immunological processes play a key role in the pathogenesis of head and neck pathologies.

Despite recent proposal on medicalization of loneliness, so far no effort has been made to establish a model capable of predicting loneliness at the individual level. Here, we applied a machine-learning approach to decode loneliness from whole-brain resting-state functional connectivity (RSFC). The relationship between whole-brain RSFC and loneliness was examined in a linear predictive model. The results revealed that individual loneliness could be predicted by within- and between-network connectivity of prefrontal, limbic and temporal systems, which are involved in cognitive control, emotional processing and social perceptions and communications, respectively. Key nodes that contributed to the prediction model comprised regions previously implicated in loneliness, including the dorsolateral prefrontal cortex, lateral orbital frontal cortex, ventromedial prefrontal cortex, caudate, amygdala and temporal regions. Our findings also demonstrated that both loneliness and associated neural substrates are modulated by levels of neuroticism and extraversion.

We here aim to study if advanced parental age at conception affects mitochondria DNA content, a cross species biomarker of general health, in adult human twin offspring and in a model organism. We find no deteriorated mitochondria DNA content at advanced parental age at conception, but human mitochondria DNA content was higher in females than males, and the difference was two fold higher at advanced maternal age at conception. Similar parental age effects and sex-specific differences in mitochondria DNA content were found in Drosophila melanogaster. In addition, parental longevity in humans associates with both mitochondria DNA content and parental age at conception thus we carefully propose that a poorer disease risk profile from advanced parental age at conception might be surpassed by superior effects of parental successful late-life reproduction that associate with parental longevity."

Both are secreted cytokine hormones, with activin the primary inducer of downstream signaling cascades and inhibin acting as a rheostat that exquisitely governs activin function. Adding to the complexity of activin signaling, follistatin, a highly glycosylated monomeric protein, binds activin with high affinity and restrains downstream pathway activation but through a mechanism distinct from that of inhibin. These three proteins were first identified as key ovarian hormones in the pituitary-gonadal axis that direct the synthesis and secretion of FSH from the pituitary, hence controlling folliculogenesis. Research during the past 30 years has expanded the roles of these proteins, first by discovering the ubiquitous expression of the trio and then by implicating them in a wide array of biological functions. In concert, these three hormones govern tissue development, homeostasis, and disease in multiple organ systems through diverse autocrine and paracrine mechanisms.

Although key factors such as electrical activity and stimulation by kisspeptin have been extensively studied, the underlying mechanisms that regulate GnRH release are still not fully understood. Previously developed mathematical models studied hormonal release and electrical properties of GnRH neurons separately, but they never integrated both components. Herein, we present a more complete biophysical model to investigate how electrical activity and hormonal release interact. The model consists of two components: an electrical submodel comprised of a modified Izhikevich formalism incorporating several key ionic currents to reproduce GnRH neuronal bursting behavior, and a hormonal submodel that incorporates pulsatile kisspeptin stimulation and a GnRH autocrine feedback mechanism. Using the model, we examine the electrical activity of GnRH neurons and how kisspeptin affects GnRH pulsatility. The model reproduces the noise-driven bursting behavior of GnRH neurons as well as the experimentally observed electrophysiological effects induced by GnRH and kisspeptin. Specifically, the model reveals that external application of GnRH causes a transient hyperpolarization followed by an increase in firing frequency, whereas administration of kisspeptin leads to long-lasting depolarization of the neuron. The model also shows that GnRH release follows a pulsatile profile similar to that observed experimentally and that kisspeptin and GnRH exhibit ∼7-1 locking in their pulsatility. These results suggest that external kisspeptin stimulation with a period of ∼8 minutes drives the autocrine mechanism beyond a threshold to generate pronounced GnRH pulses every hour.",Protein model quality assessment using 3D oriented convolutional neural networks.,https://www.ncbi.nlm.nih.gov/pubmed/30874723,"Bioinformatics (Oxford, England)",2019 03 15,"Protein model quality assessment (QA) is a crucial and yet open problem in structural bioinformatics.

Difference-in-differences zero-inflated negative-binomial models were used to evaluate the impact of strengthening gun control on firearm and non-firearm suicides. We subsequently stratified by sex and interacted the index by race/ethnicity and age. In the data, 25 states strengthened gun control by an average of 6 points. Such an increase may result in a 3.3% (IRR=0.967; 95% CI=0.938,0.996) decrease in firearm suicides. While no impact on non-firearm suicides was found overall, interacted models showed an increase in non-firearm suicides among black males, white and black females, and older individuals.

We previously showed that the compressive moduli of chondrocytes increase concomitantly with extracellular matrix (ECM) stiffness, suggesting cells were remodeling to adapt to the surrounding environment. Due to the difficulty in analyzing the mechanical response of cells in situ, we sought to create an in silico model that would enable us to investigate why cell and ECM stiffness increased in tandem. The goal of this study was to establish a methodology to segment, quantify and generate mechanical models of developing cartilage to explore how variations in geometry and material properties affect strain distributions. Multicellular geometries from embryonic day E16.5 and postnatal day P3 murine cartilage were imaged in 3D using confocal microscopy. Image stacks were processed using MATLAB to create geometries for finite element analysis using ANSYS. The geometries based on confocal images and isolated, single cell models were compressed 5% and the equivalent von Mises strain of cells and ECM were compared. Our simulations indicated that cells had similar strains at both time points, suggesting that the stiffness and organization of cartilage changes during development to maintain a constant strain profile within cells. In contrast, the ECM at P3 took on more strain than at E16.5. The isolated, single cell geometries underestimated both cell and ECM strain and were not able to capture the similarity in cell strain at both time points.

Many state-of-the-art tissue engineered heart valves rely on recellularization. Current in vitro testing is insufficient in characterizing a soon to be living valve. It is imperative to understand the performance of an in situ valve, but due to the complex in vivo environment this is difficult to accomplish. Finite element analysis has become a standard tool for modeling mechanical behavior of heart valves; yet, research to date has mostly focused on commercial valves. The purpose of this study has been to develop finite element models of a decellularized and recellularized tissue engineered heart valve. Mechanical properties from porcine aortic valves were utilized to develop finite element models, which were run through a full physiological cardiac cycle. Maximum principal stresses and strains from the leaflets and commissures were analyzed. The results of this study demonstrate that the explanted tissues had reduced mechanical strength compared to the implants but were similar to the native tissues. For the finite element models the explanted recellularized leaflets showed lower stress but increased compliance in the leaflet belly compared to native tissues and higher compliance than implant tissues. Histology demonstrated recellularization and remodeling although remodeled collagen had no clear directionality. In conclusion, we observed successful recellularization and remodeling of the tissue, however, the mechanical response indicates the further remodeling is required following implantation in the aortic/pulmonary position.",Effect of Catheter Ablation vs Medical Therapy on Quality of Life Among Patients With Atrial Fibrillation: The CABANA Randomized Clinical Trial.,https://www.ncbi.nlm.nih.gov/pubmed/30874716,JAMA,2019 04 26,"Catheter ablation is more effective than drug therapy in restoring sinus rhythm in patients with atrial fibrillation (AF), but its incremental effect on long-term quality of life (QOL) is uncertain.","Relationships Between Cadmium, Lead and Mercury Levels and Albuminuria: Results From the National Health and Nutrition Examination Survey Database 2009-2012.",https://www.ncbi.nlm.nih.gov/pubmed/30874715,American journal of epidemiology,2019 03 15,"This cross-sectional study evaluated associations between cadmium (Cd), lead (Pb), and mercury (Hg) and the presence of albuminuria in US adults who participated in the National Health and Nutrition Examination Survey 2009-2012.

However, its application potential has been severely hindered by the tendency of exfoliated TiS2 to rapidly oxidize under ambient conditions. Herein, we confirm that, although layered TiS2 powder can be exfoliated by sonication in aqueous surfactant solutions, the resultant nanosheets oxidise almost completely within hours. However, we find that upon performing the exfoliation in the solvent cyclohexyl-pyrrolidone (CHP), the oxidation is almost completely suppressed. TiS2 nanosheets dispersed in CHP and stored at 4 °C in an open atmosphere for 90 days remained up to 95% intact. In addition, CHP-exfoliated nanosheets did not show any evidence of oxidation for at least 30 days after being transformed into dry films even when stored under ambient conditions. This stability, probably a result of a residual CHP coating, allows TiS2 nanosheets to be deployed in applications.

An analysis of Pearson correlation functions allows us to spatially locate the area over the fiber laser length in which correlations are more likely to occur. This, in turn, leads us to the conclusion about the main mechanism of spectral correlations-the relative intensity noise transfer from the pump wave.",Visible to near-infrared octave spanning supercontinuum generation in tantalum pentoxide (Ta2O5) air-cladding waveguide.,https://www.ncbi.nlm.nih.gov/pubmed/30874689,Optics letters,2019 03 19,"In this work, for the first time, to the best of our knowledge, an anomalous dispersion CMOS-compatible Ta2O5 waveguide was realized, and broadband on-chip supercontinuum generation (SCG) was accordingly demonstrated.

Chalcogenide phase change materials (PCMs) are promising candidates for tuning in the near infrared: at the nanoscale, thin layers can provide enough contrast to control the optical response of a nanostructure. Moreover, all-dielectric metamaterials allow for resonant behavior without having ohmic losses in the telecom range. Here, a novel hybridization of a SOI-based metamaterial with PCM GeTe is experimentally investigated. A metamaterial based on Si nanorods, covered by a thin layer of GeTe, is designed and fabricated. Switching GeTe from amorphous to crystalline leads to a rather high resonance-governed reflection contrast at 1.55 μm. Additional confocal Raman imaging is done to differentiate the crystallized zones of the metamaterials' unit cell. The findings are in good agreement with numerical analysis and show good perspectives of all-dielectric tunable near-infrared nanophotonics."

The intensity of the WW x-ray transported in a 400-Pa N2 atmosphere from the laser-produced plasma increased by 3.8 times over that in vacuum. Considering a strong x-ray absorption, the x-ray yield emitted directly from the Au plasma in the N2 gas was evaluated to be 13 times higher than that in vacuum.

The autocorrelation of each imaging target is separated blindly from the autocorrelation of the recorded dual-target speckle via Fourier spectrum guessing and iterative energy constrained compensation.

We interpret the double-peaked spectrum as a signature of collective Rabi splitting, and discuss the difference between the splitting of the spectrum and the existence of two eigenmodes. We show that an LED will never exhibit a split spectrum, even though it can have distinct eigenmodes. For systems where the splitting is possible, we show that the two peaks merge into a single one when the pump rate is increased. Finally, we compute the linewidth of the systems, and discuss the influence of inter-emitter correlations on the lineshape."

A hallmark of MS and its animal model, experimental autoimmune encephalomyelitis (EAE), is autoimmunity against proteins of the myelin sheath. Most studies in this field have focused on the roles of CD4+ T lymphocytes, which form part of the adaptive immune system as both mediators and regulators in disease pathogenesis. Consequently, the treatments for MS often target the inflammatory CD4+ T-cell responses. However, many other lymphocyte subsets contribute to the pathophysiology of MS and EAE, and these subsets include CD8+ T cells and B cells of the adaptive immune system, lymphocytes of the innate immune system such as natural killer cells, and subsets of innate-like T and B lymphocytes such as γδ T cells, natural killer T cells, and mucosal-associated invariant T cells. Several of these lymphocyte subsets can act as mediators of CNS inflammation, whereas others exhibit immunoregulatory functions in disease. Importantly, the efficacy of some MS treatments might be mediated in part by effects on lymphocytes other than CD4+ T cells.

The consequences of excessive and uncontrolled neuroinflammation are injury and death to neural elements, which manifest as a heterogeneous set of neurological symptoms. However, it is now readily acknowledged, due to instructive studies from the peripheral nervous system and a large body of CNS literature, that aspects of the neuroinflammatory response can be beneficial for CNS outcomes. The recognized benefits of inflammation to the CNS include the preservation of CNS constituents (neuroprotection), the proliferation and maturation of various neural precursor populations, axonal regeneration, and the reformation of myelin on denuded axons. Herein, we highlight the benefits of neuroinflammation in fostering CNS recovery after neural injury using examples from multiple sclerosis, traumatic spinal cord injury, stroke, and Alzheimer's disease.

The scope and scale of understanding avian use of these wetlands in conjunction with changes in climate are daunting yet critical to address lest we lose continent-wide migratory pathways. Here, we assess changes in waterbird use of North America's Pacific Flyway in the Great Basin by examining water availability and climate trends over the past 100 years. We found recent (1980-2015) climate warming has significantly reduced the amount and shifted seasonality of water flowing into wetlands. Further, we found remarkable changes in waterbird species composition over time. We propose that a reduced hydroperiod and lower water quality from reduction in water level and flow limits sites used by waterbirds. These factors reduce chick survivorship as they cannot metabolize saline water, which makes suitable freshwater conditions a limiting resource. Collectively, climate-induced changes in Great Basin wetlands suggest a major shift in freshwater ecosystems, resulting in degradation of a continental migratory route. This work illustrates the importance of examining multi-scale changes in critical regional resources to understand their impact across a hemispheric flyway and provides a model to examine other flyways.",Methylmercury induces the expression of chemokine CCL4 via SRF activation in C17.2 mouse neural stem cells.,https://www.ncbi.nlm.nih.gov/pubmed/30874621,Scientific reports,2019 03 29,"Methylmercury is an environmental pollutant that causes specific and serious damage to the central nervous system. We have previously shown that C-C motif chemokine ligand 4 (CCL4) protects cultured neural cells from methylmercury toxicity and expression of CCL4 is specifically induced in mouse brain by methylmercury. In this study, we examined the transcriptional regulatory mechanism that induces CCL4 expression by methylmercury using C17.2 mouse neural stem cells. The promoter region of the CCL4 gene was analyzed by a reporter assay, revealing that the region up to 50 bp upstream from the transcription start site was necessary for inducing expression of CCL4 by methylmercury. Nine transcription factors that might bind to this upstream region and be involved in the induction of CCL4 expression by methylmercury were selected, and the induction of CCL4 expression by methylmercury was suppressed by the knockdown of serum response factor (SRF). In addition, the nuclear level of SRF was elevated by methylmercury, and an increase in the amount bound to the CCL4 gene promoter was also observed. Furthermore, we examined the upstream signaling pathway involved in the induction of CCL4 expression by SRF, and confirmed that activation of p38 and ERK, which are part of the MAPK pathway, are involved. These results suggest that methylmercury induces the expression of CCL4 by activating SRF via the p38 and ERK signaling pathway. Our findings are important for elucidating the mechanism involved in the brain-specific induction of CCL4 expression by methylmercury.",Scaling in vitro activity of CYP3A7 suggests human fetal livers do not clear retinoic acid entering from maternal circulation.,https://www.ncbi.nlm.nih.gov/pubmed/30874620,Scientific reports,2019 06 10,"All-trans-retinoic acid (atRA), the active metabolite of vitamin A, is a critical signaling molecule during embryonic and fetal development and is necessary for maternal health. Fetal exposure to endogenous atRA is tightly regulated during gestation in a tissue specific manner and maternal exposure to exogenous retinoids during pregnancy is teratogenic. The clearance of atRA is primarily mediated by the cytochrome P450 (CYP) 26 enzymes, which play an essential role in controlling retinoid gradients during organogenesis. We hypothesized that CYP26 enzymes in the human fetal liver also function as a protective barrier to prevent maternal atRA reaching fetal circulation. Using human fetal liver tissue, we found that the mRNA of CYP26A1 and CYP26B1 enzymes is expressed in the human fetal liver. However, based on inhibition studies, metabolite profiles and correlation of atRA metabolism with testosterone hydroxylation, clearance of atRA in the fetal livers was mediated by CYP3A7. Based on in vitro-to-in vivo scaling, atRA clearance in the fetal liver was quantitatively minimal, thus providing an insufficient maternal-fetal barrier for atRA exposure.",Metabolite profiling characterises chemotypes of Musa diploids and triploids at juvenile and pre-flowering growth stages.,https://www.ncbi.nlm.nih.gov/pubmed/30874619,Scientific reports,2019 03 29,"Bananas (Musa spp.) are consumed worldwide as dessert and cooking types.

The focus of this assessment was banana leaves at two growth stages (juvenile and pre-flowering), to see when during the plant growth metabolic differences can be established. The metabolic data corresponded to genomic trends reported in previous studies and demonstrated a link between metabolites/pathways and the genomes of M. acuminata and M. balbisiana. Furthermore, the vigour and resistance traits of M. balbisiana was connected to the phenolic composition and showed differences with the number of B genes in the hybrid accessions.

ORS and LVX and their combinations was determined by MIC/MBC (in neutral and acidic environments) and checkerboard tests. The anti-biofilm effect was determined by biomass quantification. In vivo Galleria mellonella model was used to confirm in vitro data. Pistacia vera L. ORS and LVX MICs ranged respectively from 780 to 3120 mg/l and from 0.12 to 2.00 mg/l, at pH 7.0 and 5.5. MBCs were similar to MICs. Pistacia vera L. ORS was able to synergize with LVX, restoring its effectiveness in LVX resistant strains. Pistacia vera L. ORS, LVX and their synergistic combinations displayed significant biofilm reduction. Pistacia vera L. ORS and LVX, showed protective effect against H. pylori infection on G. mellonella (62% and 63% of survival, respectively). Pistacia vera L. ORS can be considered a promising potentiator to restore the effectiveness of LVX tackling the H. pylori antibiotic resistance phenomenon."

Unlike almost every other insect species, males of some Anopheles species produce steroid hormones which are transferred to females during copulation to influence their reproduction. Steroids are consequently a potential target for malaria vector control. Here, we analysed the evolution of sexually-transferred steroids and their effects on female reproductive traits across Anopheles by using a set of 16 mosquito species (five Anopheles, eight Cellia, and three Nyssorhynchus), including malaria vector and non-vector species. We show that male steroid production and transfer are specific to the Cellia and therefore represent a synapomorphy of this subgenus. Furthermore, we show that mating-induced effects in females are variable across species and differences are not correlated with sexually-transferred steroids or with Anopheles ability to transmit human malaria. Overall, our findings highlight that Anopheles mosquitoes have evolved different reproductive strategies, independently of being a malaria vector or not.",Light quality determines primary production in nutrient-poor small lakes.,https://www.ncbi.nlm.nih.gov/pubmed/30874599,Scientific reports,2019 03 29,"The availability of nutrients for primary producers has long been thought to be the main limiting factor for primary productivity in nutrient-poor lake ecosystems. However, recent studies have indicated that the availability of light energy is also important. On the other hand, the amount of phototroph was reported to decrease in summer in Antarctic lakes, furthermore, the light environment underwater was shown containing high amount of ultraviolet energy in small Antarctic lakes. Here, we hypothesized that primary productivity is limited by not only nutrients and simple light quantity but also light quality in nutrient-poor lakes. Then, we investigate factors influencing primary production by benthic phototrophic communities in shallow nutrient-poor lakes. We examine the relationships between primary production in 17 Antarctic freshwater lakes and nutrient concentrations in lake and benthic water, temperature and light energy. Primary production is decreased by ultraviolet energy reaching the lake bed, showing that production is determined by light quality. We also correlate ultraviolet energy in lake water with the catchment area of each lake. Our results show that the underwater light environment has an important influence on primary production as a key limitation factor and is sensitive to materials in runoff from the surrounding environment for pristine lakes.",PDGFR-induced autocrine SDF-1 signaling in cancer cells promotes metastasis in advanced skin carcinoma.,https://www.ncbi.nlm.nih.gov/pubmed/30874597,Oncogene,2019 03 15,"Advanced and undifferentiated skin squamous cell carcinomas (SCCs) exhibit aggressive growth and enhanced metastasis capability, which is associated in mice with an expansion of the cancer stem-like cell (CSC) population and with changes in the regulatory mechanisms that control the proliferation and invasion of these cells. Indeed, autocrine activation of PDGFRα induces CSC invasion and promotes distant metastasis in advanced SCCs. However, the mechanisms involved in this process were unclear. Here, we show that CSCs of mouse advanced SCCs (L-CSCs) express CXCR4 and CXCR7, both receptors of SDF-1. PDGFRα signaling induces SDF-1 expression and secretion, and the autocrine activation of this pathway in L-CSCs. Autocrine SDF-1/CXCR4 signaling induces L-CSC proliferation and survival, and mediates PDGFRα-induced invasion, promoting in vivo lung metastasis. Validation of these findings in patient samples of skin SCCs shows a strong correlation between the expression of SDF1, PDGFRA, and PDGFRB, which is upregulated, along CXCR4 in tumor cells of advanced SCCs. Furthermore, PDGFR regulates SDF-1 expression and inhibition of SDF-1/CXCR4 and PDGFR pathways blocks distant metastasis of human PD/S-SCCs. Our results indicate that functional crosstalk between PDGFR/SDF-1 signaling regulates tumor cell invasion and metastasis in human and mouse advanced SCCs, and suggest that CXCR4 and/or PDGFR inhibitors could be used to block metastasis of these aggressive tumors.",Regulatory cytokine function in the respiratory tract.,https://www.ncbi.nlm.nih.gov/pubmed/30874596,Mucosal immunology,2019 04 17,"The respiratory tract is an important site of immune regulation; required to allow protective immunity against pathogens, while minimizing tissue damage and avoiding aberrant inflammatory responses to inhaled allergens. Several cell types work in concert to control pulmonary immune responses and maintain tolerance in the respiratory tract, including regulatory and effector T cells, airway and interstitial macrophages, dendritic cells and the airway epithelium. The cytokines transforming growth factor β, interleukin (IL-) 10, IL-27, and IL-35 are key coordinators of immune regulation in tissues such as the lung. Here, we discuss the role of these cytokines during respiratory infection and allergic airway disease, highlighting the critical importance of cellular source and immunological context for the effects of these cytokines in vivo.",Estrogen deficiency impairs integrin αvβ3-mediated mechanosensation by osteocytes and alters osteoclastogenic paracrine signalling.,https://www.ncbi.nlm.nih.gov/pubmed/30874595,Scientific reports,2019 03 29,"The integrin αvβ3 has been shown to play an important role in osteocyte mechanotransduction. It has been reported that there are fewer β3 integrin-containing cells in osteoporotic bone cells. Osteocytes cultured in vitro under estrogen deficient conditions demonstrate altered mechanotransduction. However, it is unknown whether the altered mechanotransduction in estrogen deficient osteocytes is directly associated with defective αvβ3 expression or signalling. The objective of this study is to investigate the role of estrogen deficiency for regulating MLO-Y4 cell morphology, αvβ3 expression, focal adhesion formation and mechanotransduction by osteocytes. Here, we report that estrogen withdrawal leads to a smaller focal adhesion area and reduced αvβ3 localisation at focal adhesion sites, resulting in an increased Rankl/Opg ratio and defective Cox-2 responses to oscillatory fluid flow. Interestingly, αvβ3 antagonism had a similar effect on focal adhesion assembly, Rankl/Opg ratio, and Cox-2 responses to oscillatory fluid flow. Taken together, our results provide the first evidence for a relationship between estrogen withdrawal and defective αvβ3-mediated signalling. Specifically, this study implicates estrogen withdrawal as a putative mechanism responsible for altered αvβ3 expression and resultant changes in downstream signalling in osteocytes during post-menopausal osteoporosis, which might provide an important, but previously unidentified, contribution to the bone loss cascade.",SnoopLigase peptide-peptide conjugation enables modular vaccine assembly.,https://www.ncbi.nlm.nih.gov/pubmed/30874593,Scientific reports,2019 03 29,"For many infectious diseases there is still no vaccine, even though potential protective antigens have been identified. Suitable platforms and conjugation routes are urgently needed to convert the promise of such antigens into broadly protective and scalable vaccines. Here we apply a newly established peptide-peptide ligation approach, SnoopLigase, for specific and irreversible coupling of antigens onto an oligomerization platform. SnoopLigase was engineered from a Streptococcus pneumoniae adhesin and enables isopeptide bond formation between two peptide tags: DogTag and SnoopTagJr. We expressed in bacteria DogTag linked to the self-assembling coiled-coil nanoparticle IMX313. This platform was stable over months at 37 °C when lyophilized, remaining reactive even after boiling. IMX-DogTag was efficiently coupled to two blood-stage malarial proteins (from PfEMP1 or CyRPA), with SnoopTagJr fused at the N- or C-terminus. We also showed SnoopLigase-mediated coupling of a telomerase peptide relevant to cancer immunotherapy. SnoopLigase-mediated nanoassembly enhanced the antibody response to both malaria antigens in a prime-boost model. Including or depleting SnoopLigase from the conjugate had little effect on the antibody response to the malarial antigens. SnoopLigase decoration represents a promising and accessible strategy for modular plug-and-display vaccine assembly, as well as providing opportunities for robust nanoconstruction in synthetic biology.","High intensity endurance training is associated with better quality of life, but not with improved cognitive functions in elderly marathon runners.",https://www.ncbi.nlm.nih.gov/pubmed/30874592,Scientific reports,2019 03 29,"Impairment of cognitive functions in advanced age leads to a reduced quality of life and impaired ability to perform everyday tasks. The positive impact of physical exercise on the quality of life and well-being, also at a later age, is well established. However, the effect of endurance exercises, including long distance running and cycling, on cognitive function and mental health within the elderly population has still to be elucidated. To this end, elderly active marathoners (N = 50) aged over 60 years and non-athlete controls (N = 49) were followed for four years. Cognitive function was assessed using the CERAD test battery. In addition, the Short Form Health Survey (SF-36) was applied to assess self-reported physical, mental, and emotional health. Except for age, sex and education-corrected z-values of the test ""Word list recall"", with marathon runners showing a decline compared to an improvement in controls (p < 0.05), there was no statistically significant difference in time trend between groups. In contrast, concerning self-reported health, scores in all eight domains of the SF-36 remained stable over time and, in nearly all of them, marathon runners showed higher self-reported health than controls. The results indicated that extensive endurance exercise is associated with improved subjective health but does not lead to better scores in cognitive performance tests in elderly persons.",PAmiRDB: A web resource for plant miRNAs targeting viruses.,https://www.ncbi.nlm.nih.gov/pubmed/30874591,Scientific reports,2019 03 29,"MicroRNAs (miRNAs) have emerged to be essential constituents of host antiviral-defense mechanisms. The miRNA mediated antiviral mechanism was first experimentally established in animals, which proved that host miRNAs regulate viral gene expression by targeting the animal virus mRNAs. There are comparatively fewer reports about such interactions in plants, however, artificial miRNA studies prove that miRNAs play similar antiviral role in plants too. To explore the extent of this phenomenon in plant genomes, and in the absence of any publicly available resource for prediction of plant miRNAs targeting viruses, we were motivated to predict such interactions of plant miRNAs and viral genes. The intriguing results of the predictions are compiled as a database, which we have named as PAmiRDB. The current version of PAmiRDB includes more than 2600 plant miRNAs and their specific interactions with corresponding targets in approximately 500 viral species (predominantly from the major plant-infecting virus families of geminiviruses and potyviruses). PAmiRDB is a database of known plant miRNAs and their predicted targets in virus genomes. The innovative database query-interface enables global and comprehensive investigation of such predicted interactions between host miRNAs and viral genes. The database integrated-tools also helps researchers to design experiments to confirm such interactions.

Agonist efficacy is a relative term that is dependent on the system in which it is measured, especially being dependent on receptor expression level. The operational model (OM) of functional receptor agonism is a useful means for the determination of agonist functional efficacy using the maximal response to agonist and ratio of agonist functional potency to its equilibrium dissociation constant (KA) at the active state of the receptor. However, the functional efficacy parameter τ is inter-dependent on two other parameters of OM; agonist's KA and the highest response that could be evoked in the system by any stimulus (EMAX). Thus, fitting of OM to functional response data is a tricky process. In this work we analyse pitfalls of fitting OM to experimental data and propose a rigorous fitting procedure where KA and EMAX are derived from half-efficient concentration of agonist and apparent maximal responses obtained from a series of functional response curves. Subsequently, OM with fixed KA and EMAX is fitted to functional response data to obtain τ. The procedure was verified at M2 and M4 muscarinic receptors fused with the G15 G-protein α-subunit. The procedure, however, is applicable to any receptor-effector system.",Utilization of the high spatial-frequency component in adaptive beam shaping by using a virtual diagonal phase grating.,https://www.ncbi.nlm.nih.gov/pubmed/30874588,Scientific reports,2019 03 29,"A square flattop beam is a fundamental shape that is in high demand in various applications, such as ultra-high-power lasers, uniform surface processing and medical engineering. In this experiment, a new and simple scheme of the adaptive beam shaping system to generate a square flattop shape with high uniformity and edge steepness using virtual diagonal phase grating encoded on a spatial-light modulator and a 4f system is proposed. The grating vector kg is non-parallel to the normal vectors kx and ky of the objective beam profile to be extracted; thus, the residual and extracted components hit separately on the Fourier plane of the 4f system. Consequently, using a spatial-frequency filter passing components parallel to kx and ky, the residual components are blocked by the filter without loss of the high spatial-frequency domain of the extracted component. When the width of the filter was 1.0 mm, the edge of the shaped beam increased in height within 20 μm, which is less than 20% of that obtained with conventional vertical phase grating."

However, the magnitude of atmospheric N deposition in the Tibetan region of China is not well known. In this study, multi-year (between 2005 and 2016) measurements of dry and wet N deposition were carried out in Nyingchi (NC) city, southeastern Tibet. Bulk deposition was collected by the rain gauge method; dry deposition was calculated by the inferential method, namely, multiplying ambient N concentrations by dry deposition velocity (Vd) of the N species. During the entire period, annual bulk and dry N deposition fluxes averaged 2.19 and 1.85 kg N ha-1 yr-1, respectively. Total N deposition fluxes (the sum of reduced and oxidized N species in dry and bulk deposition) showed an obvious increasing trend, especially for oxidized N species. Both bulk and dry N deposition showed a consistent seasonal pattern, with the highest fluxes in summer and the lowest in winter. Our findings suggest that N deposition to the urban environment in southeast Tibet has recently shifted from ammonium-dominated to nitrate-dominated conditions.","Colloidal analogues of polymer chains, ribbons and 2D crystals employing orientations and interactions of nano-rods dispersed in a nematic liquid crystal.",https://www.ncbi.nlm.nih.gov/pubmed/30874576,Scientific reports,2019 03 29,"Robust control over the position, orientation and self-assembly of nonspherical colloids facilitate the creation of new materials with complex architecture that are important from technological and fundamental perspectives. We study orientation, elastic interaction and co-assembly of surface functionalized silica nano-rods in thin films of nematic liquid crystal. With homeotropic boundary condition, the nano-rods are predominantly oriented perpendicular to the nematic director which is different than the mostly parallel orientation of the micro-rods. The percentage of perpendicular nano-rods are significantly larger than the parallel nano-rods. The perpendicular nano-rods create very weak elastic deformation and exhibit unusual, out-of-plane, attractive interaction. On the other hand, the nano-rods oriented parallel to the director create strong elastic deformation and shows anisotropic, in-plane, dipolar interaction. In both orientations, the induced defects reside in the nano-rods. With the help of a dynamic laser tweezers and using nano-rods as building blocks we demonstrate colloidal analogues of linear polymer chains, ribbons and two-dimensional binary crystals.",Phase-pure VO2 nanoporous structure for binder-free supercapacitor performances.,https://www.ncbi.nlm.nih.gov/pubmed/30874575,Scientific reports,2019 03 29,"Vanadium oxides are anticipated as a high-performance energy storage electrode due to their coupled double layer and pseudo-capacitative charge storage mechanism. In the present work, we investigated the influence of different structural phases of as-grown VO2 nanoporous structure and corresponding oxidation states on the supercapacitor performance. This nanoporous structure facilitates fast ion diffusion and transport. It is shown that stoichiometric monoclinic VO2, with V oxidation state of +4, provides superior charge storage capacity with a capacitance value of 33 mF/cm2, capacitance retention of 93.7% and Coulombic efficiency of 98.2%, to those for VO2 structures with mixed oxidation states of V5+ and V4+. A comparable high energy density is also recorded for the sample with all V4+. Scanning Kelvin probe microscopy results clarify further the formation of space charge region between VO2 and carbon paper. These key findings indicate the potentiality of binder-free single phase monoclinic VO2 porous structure towards the next-generation micro-supercapacitor application.",Tunable Superconducting Cavity using Superconducting Quantum Interference Device Metamaterials.,https://www.ncbi.nlm.nih.gov/pubmed/30874574,Scientific reports,2019 03 29,"Here we consider a tunable superconducting cavity that can be used either as a tunable coupler to a qubit inside the cavity or as a tunable low noise, low temperature, RF filter. Our design consists of an array of radio-frequency superconducting quantum interference devices (rf SQUIDs) inside a superconducting cavity. This forms a tunable metamaterial structure which couples to the cavity through its magnetic plasma frequency. By tuning the resonant frequency of the metamaterial through an applied magnetic flux, one can tune the cavity mode profile. This allows us to detune the cavity initially centered at 5.593 GHz by over 200 MHz. The maximum quality factor approaches that of the empty cavity, which is 4.5 × 106. The metamaterial electromagnetic response is controlled via a low-frequency or dc magnetic flux bias, and we present a control line architecture that is capable of applying sufficient magnetic flux bias with minimal parasitic coupling. Together this design allows for an in-situ tunable cavity which enables low-temperature quantum control applications.",Memantine prodrug as a new agent for Alzheimer's Disease.,https://www.ncbi.nlm.nih.gov/pubmed/30874573,Scientific reports,2019 03 29,"Hydrogen sulphide has recently drawn much attention due to its potent anti-inflammatory and neuroprotective roles in brain functions. The purpose of the current study was to exploit these beneficial properties of H2S to design a new agent for the treatment of Alzheimer's disease (AD). To pursue our aims, we replaced the free amine group of memantine with an isothiocyanate functionality as a putative H2S-donor moiety. The new chemical entity, named memit, was then tested in vitro to determine whether it retains the pharmacological profile of the ""native drug"", while also providing a source of H2S in the CNS. Indeed, Memit showed the ability to release H2S through a cysteine-mediated mechanism, thus generating memantine. Moreover, the new hybrid molecule exerts protective effects against neuronal inflammation and induces a drastic fall in ROS production. In addition, memit was also able to reduce the Aβ(1-42) self-induced aggregation and exerted cytoprotective effect against Aβ oligomers-induced damage in both human neurons and rat microglia cells. Finally, similarly to memantine, the new compound promotes autophagy, a complex process required for cellular homeostasis in cell survival that results to be altered in neurodegenerative diseases. In conclusion, our study revealed that memit is a prodrug of memantine. Further in vivo studies will be necessary to fully investigate the synergic or cumulative effects due to the H2S-releasing moiety and the native drug.",Subtle white matter alterations in schizophrenia identified with a new measure of fiber density.,https://www.ncbi.nlm.nih.gov/pubmed/30874571,Scientific reports,2019 03 29,"Altered cerebral connectivity is one of the core pathophysiological mechanism underlying the development and progression of information-processing deficits in schizophrenia. To date, most diffusion tensor imaging (DTI) studies used fractional anisotropy (FA) to investigate disrupted white matter connections. However, a quantitative interpretation of FA changes is often impeded by the inherent limitations of the underlying tensor model. A more fine-grained measure of white matter alterations could be achieved by measuring fiber density (FD) - a novel non-tensor-derived diffusion marker. This study investigates, for the first time, FD alterations in schizophrenia patients. FD and FA maps were derived from diffusion data of 25 healthy controls (HC) and 21 patients with schizophrenia (SZ). Using tract-based spatial statistics (TBSS), group differences in FD and FA were investigated across the entire white matter. Furthermore, we performed a region of interest (ROI) analysis of frontal fasciculi to detect potential correlations between FD and positive symptoms. As a result, whole brain TBSS analysis revealed reduced FD in SZ patients compared to HC in several white matter tracts including the left and right thalamic radiation (TR), superior longitudinal fasciculus (SLF), corpus callosum (CC), and corticospinal tract (CST). In contrast, there were no significant FA differences between groups. Further, FD values in the TR were negatively correlated with the severity of positive symptoms and medication dose in SZ patients. In summary, a novel diffusion-weighted data analysis approach enabled us to identify widespread FD changes in SZ patients with most prominent white matter alterations in the frontal and subcortical regions. Our findings suggest that the new FD measure may be more sensitive to subtle changes in the white matter microstructure compared to FA, particularly in the given population. Therefore, investigating FD may be a promising approach to detect subtle changes in the white matter microstructure of altered connectivity in schizophrenia.",Microscale Temperature Shaping Using Spatial Light Modulation on Gold Nanoparticles.,https://www.ncbi.nlm.nih.gov/pubmed/30874570,Scientific reports,2019 03 29,"Heating on the microscale using focused lasers gave rise to recent applications, e.g., in biomedicine, biology and microfluidics, especially using gold nanoparticles as efficient nanoabsorbers of light. However, such an approach naturally leads to nonuniform, Gaussian-like temperature distributions due to the diffusive nature of heat. Here, we report on an experimental means to generate arbitrary distributions of temperature profiles on the micrometric scale (e.g. uniform, linear, parabolic, etc) consisting in illuminating a uniform gold nanoparticle distribution on a planar substrate using spatially contrasted laser beams, shaped using a spatial light modulator (SLM). We explain how to compute the light pattern and the SLM interferogram to achieve the desired temperature distribution, and demonstrate the approach by carrying out temperature measurements using quantitative wavefront sensing.",Refractive index of human red blood cells between 290 nm and 1100 nm determined by optical extinction measurements.,https://www.ncbi.nlm.nih.gov/pubmed/30874567,Scientific reports,2019 03 29,"The knowledge of optical properties of biological cells is essential to interpret their interaction with light and to derive morphological information and parameters associated with cell function like the oxygen transport capacity of human red blood cells (RBCs). We present a method to determine the dependence between the refractive index (RI) of human RBCs and their intracellular hemoglobin (Hb) concentration from spectral extinction measurements of a cell suspension. The procedure is based on the analysis of the corresponding ensemble averaged extinction cross section [Formula: see text]. Thus far two complementary approaches have been taken to derive RIs of RBCs. The first one uses homogeneous macroscopic samples prepared by hemolysis for the destruction of the RBCs' membranes and subsequent centrifugation. A second approach is the determination of RIs of single intact cells by microscopic investigation. These techniques are limited to a few discrete wavelengths or a rather narrow wavelength range. In addition most of these techniques require additional information about the concentration dependence. In contrast, our approach yields the RI increment with Hb concentration of intact, reversibly isovolumetrically sphered, oxygenated RBCs over a wide wavelength range from 290 nm to 1100 nm from macroscopic measurements.","The Impact of Shift Work on Sleep, Alertness and Performance in Healthcare Workers.",https://www.ncbi.nlm.nih.gov/pubmed/30874565,Scientific reports,2019 03 29,"Shift work is associated with impaired alertness and performance due to sleep loss and circadian misalignment. This study examined sleep between shift types (day, evening, night), and alertness and performance during day and night shifts in 52 intensive care workers. Sleep and wake duration between shifts were evaluated using wrist actigraphs and diaries. Subjective sleepiness (Karolinska Sleepiness Scale, KSS) and Psychomotor Vigilance Test (PVT) performance were examined during day shift, and on the first and subsequent night shifts (3rd, 4th or 5th). Circadian phase was assessed using urinary 6-sulphatoxymelatonin rhythms. Sleep was most restricted between consecutive night shifts (5.74 ± 1.30 h), consecutive day shifts (5.83 ± 0.92 h) and between evening and day shifts (5.20 ± 0.90 h). KSS and PVT mean reaction times were higher at the end of the first and subsequent night shift compared to day shift, with KSS highest at the end of the first night. On nights, working during the circadian acrophase of the urinary melatonin rhythm led to poorer outcomes on the KSS and PVT. In rotating shift workers, early day shifts can be associated with similar sleep restriction to night shifts, particularly when scheduled immediately following an evening shift. Alertness and performance remain most impaired during night shifts given the lack of circadian adaptation to night work. Although healthcare workers perceive themselves to be less alert on the first night shift compared to subsequent night shifts, objective performance is equally impaired on subsequent nights.",Absence of the proteoglycan decorin reduces glucose tolerance in overfed male mice.,https://www.ncbi.nlm.nih.gov/pubmed/30874564,Scientific reports,2019 03 29,"Studies have implicated the extracellular matrix (ECM) of adipose tissue in insulin resistance. The proteoglycan decorin, a component of ECM, has been associated with glucose tolerance, but possible causal effects on metabolism remain to be explored. We here sought to determine metabolic consequences of loss of decorin in mice (DcnKO). DcnKO mice were fed a low-fat (LF) or high-fat (HF) diet for 10 weeks and body weight and food intake was recorded. An intraperitoneal glucose tolerance test was performed after eight weeks. Blood samples and adipose, liver and muscle tissues were collected at sacrifice. Global gene expression was measured in adipose tissue, and expression of decorin was also analyzed in human adipose samples. DcnKO mice showed increased feed efficiency during overfeeding and impaired glucose tolerance. Adipose leptin mRNA and circulating leptin levels were elevated in DcnKO mice, along with a downregulation of genes involved in ECM organization and triglyceride biosynthesis, and an upregulation of adipose genes involved in complement and coagulation cascades. Consistent with a protective metabolic role for decorin, in obese patients we found increased adipose decorin expression after profound fat loss, particularly in the stromal vascular fraction. Loss of decorin in mice caused impaired glucose tolerance in association with increased feed efficiency and altered gene expression in adipose tissue. Our data provide evidence that decorin is an important factor for maintaining glucose tolerance."

The resulting mutation patterns serve as a genetic barcode, which is induced by targeted mutagenesis with single-guide RNA (sgRNA), leveraging substitution events, and subsequent read out by a single primer pair. By analyzing interspersed mutation signatures, we show the accurate reconstruction of cell lineage using both bulk cell and single-cell data. We envision that our genetic barcode system will enable fine-resolution mapping of organismal development in healthy and diseased mammalian states.",Photoregulated fluxional fluorophores for live-cell super-resolution microscopy with no apparent photobleaching.,https://www.ncbi.nlm.nih.gov/pubmed/30874551,Nature communications,2019 04 09,"Photoswitchable molecules have multiple applications in the physical and life sciences because their properties can be modulated with light. Fluxional molecules, which undergo rapid degenerate rearrangements in the electronic ground state, also exhibit switching behavior. The stochastic nature of fluxional switching, however, has hampered its application in the development of functional molecules and materials. Here we combine photoswitching and fluxionality to develop a fluorophore that enables very long (>30 min) time-lapse single-molecule localization microscopy in living cells with minimal phototoxicity and no apparent photobleaching. These long time-lapse experiments allow us to track intracellular organelles with unprecedented spatiotemporal resolution, revealing new information of the three-dimensional compartmentalization of synaptic vesicle trafficking in live human neurons.",Lnc SMAD5-AS1 as ceRNA inhibit proliferation of diffuse large B cell lymphoma via Wnt/β-catenin pathway by sponging miR-135b-5p to elevate expression of APC.,https://www.ncbi.nlm.nih.gov/pubmed/30874550,Cell death & disease,2019 03 29,"Diffuse large B cell lymphoma (DLBCL) is a common and fatal hematological malignancy. Long noncoding RNAs (lncRNAs) have emerged as crucial biomarkers and regulators in many cancers. Novel lncRNA biomarker in DLBCL needs to be investigated badly, as well as its function and molecular mechanism. To further explore, microarray analysis was performed to identify the differentially expressed lncRNAs in DLBCL tissues. To investigate the biological functions of SMAD5-AS1, we performed gain- and loss-of-function experiments in vitro and in vivo. Furthermore, bioinformatics analysis, dual-luciferase reporter assays, Argonaute 2-RNA immunoprecipitation (AGO2-RIP), RNA pull-down assay, quantitative PCR arrays, western blot assay, TOPFlash/FOPFlash reporter assay, and rescue experiments were conducted to explore the underlying mechanisms of competitive endogenous RNAs (ceRNAs). We found that SMAD5-AS1 was down-regulated in DLBCL tissues and cell lines. Functionally, SMAD5-AS1 downregulation promoted cell proliferation in vitro and in vivo, whereas SMAD5-AS1 overexpression could lead to the opposite effects in vitro and in vivo. Bioinformatics analysis and luciferase assays revealed that miR-135b-5p was a direct target of SMAD5-AS1, which was validated by dual-luciferase reporter assays, AGO2-RIP, RNA pull-down assay, and rescue experiments. Also, dual-luciferase reporter assays and rescue experiments demonstrated that miR-135b-5p targeted the adenomatous polyposis coli (APC) gene directly. SMAD5-AS1/miR-135b-5p inhibits the cell proliferation via inactivating the classic Wnt/β-catenin pathway in the form of APC dependency. Our results indicated that SMAD5-AS1 inhibits DLBCL proliferation by sponging miR-135b-5p to up-regulate APC expression and inactivate classic Wnt/β-catenin pathway, suggesting that SMAD5-AS1 may act as a potential biomarker and therapeutic target for DLBCL.",A series of magnon crystals appearing under ultrahigh magnetic fields in a kagomé antiferromagnet.,https://www.ncbi.nlm.nih.gov/pubmed/30874548,Nature communications,2019 03 29,"Geometrical frustration and a high magnetic field are two key factors for realizing unconventional quantum states in magnetic materials. Specifically, conventional magnetic order can potentially be destroyed by competing interactions and may be replaced by an exotic state that is characterized in terms of quasiparticles called magnons, the density and chemical potential of which are controlled by the magnetic field. Here we show that a synthetic copper mineral, Cd-kapellasite, which comprises a kagomé lattice consisting of corner-sharing triangles of spin-1/2 Cu2+ ions, exhibits an unprecedented series of fractional magnetization plateaus in ultrahigh magnetic fields of up to 160 T. We propose that these quantum states can be interpreted as crystallizations of emergent magnons localized on the hexagon of the kagomé lattice.",Restoration of high-sensitivity and adapting vision with a cone opsin.,https://www.ncbi.nlm.nih.gov/pubmed/30874546,Nature communications,2019 04 09,"Inherited and age-related retinal degenerative diseases cause progressive loss of rod and cone photoreceptors, leading to blindness, but spare downstream retinal neurons, which can be targeted for optogenetic therapy. However, optogenetic approaches have been limited by either low light sensitivity or slow kinetics, and lack adaptation to changes in ambient light, and not been shown to restore object vision. We find that the vertebrate medium wavelength cone opsin (MW-opsin) overcomes these limitations and supports vision in dim light. MW-opsin enables an otherwise blind retinitis pigmenotosa mouse to discriminate temporal and spatial light patterns displayed on a standard LCD computer tablet, displays adaption to changes in ambient light, and restores open-field novel object exploration under incidental room light. By contrast, rhodopsin, which is similar in sensitivity but slower in light response and has greater rundown, fails these tests. Thus, MW-opsin provides the speed, sensitivity and adaptation needed to restore patterned vision.",Sulforaphane metabolites inhibit migration and invasion via microtubule-mediated Claudins dysfunction or inhibition of autolysosome formation in human non-small cell lung cancer cells.,https://www.ncbi.nlm.nih.gov/pubmed/30874545,Cell death & disease,2019 03 29,"Both sulforaphane-cysteine (SFN-Cys) and sulforaphane-N-acetyl-L-cysteine (SFN-NAC) inhibited cancer migration and invasion, but the underlying mechanisms were not clear. Here we uncovered via tissue microarray assay that high expression of invasion-associated Claudin-5 was correlated to malignant grades in human non-small cell lung cancer (NSCLC) cells. Further, SFN-Cys (10 µM) induced the accumulated phosphorylation of ERK1/2, leading to downregulation of Claudin-5 and upregulation of Claudin-7, and the decrease of Claudin-1 in SK-1 cells and increase of Claudin-1 in A549 cells; knockdown of Claudin-5 significantly reduced invasion, whereas knockdown of Claudin-7 increased invasion; knockdown of Claudin-1 reduced invasion in SK-1 cells, whereas it increased invasion in A549 cells, indicating that SFN-Cys regulated Claudins and inhibited invasion depending on Claudin isotypes and cell types. Furthermore, immunofluorescence staining showed that SFN-Cys triggered microtubule disruption and knockdown of α-tubulin downregulated Claudin-1, 5, and 7, and inhibited migration and invasion, indicating that microtubule disruption contributed to invasive inhibition. Co-immunoprecipitation and confocal microscopy observation showed that SFN-Cys lowered the interaction between α-tubulin and Claudin-1 or 5, or 7. Meanwhile, Western blotting and immunofluorescence staining showed that SFN-NAC (15 µM) downregulated α-tubulin resulting in microtubule disruption; knockdown of α-tubulin increased SFN-NAC-induced LC3 II accumulation in SK-1 cells. Combined with the inhibitor of autolysosome formation, Bafilomycin A1 (100 nM), SFN-NAC inhibited invasion via accumulating LC3 II and blocking formation of autolysosome. Further, SFN-NAC upregulated microtubule-stabilizing protein Tau; knockdown of Tau reduced LC3 II/LC3 I inhibiting migration and invasion. These results indicated that SFN-Cys inhibited invasion via microtubule-mediated Claudins dysfunction, but SFN-NAC inhibited invasion via microtubule-mediated inhibition of autolysosome formation in human NSCLC cells.",ATG5-mediated autophagy suppresses NF-κB signaling to limit epithelial inflammatory response to kidney injury.,https://www.ncbi.nlm.nih.gov/pubmed/30874544,Cell death & disease,2019 03 29,"G2/M-arrested proximal tubular epithelial cells (TECs) after renal injury are linked to increased cytokines production. ATG5-mediated autophagy in proximal TECs has recently been shown to protect against G2/M cell cycle arrest and renal fibrosis. However, the impacts of autophagy in regulating inflammatorily response mounted by injured TECs remains largely unknown. In the present study, we investigated whether ATG5 acts as an innate immune suppressor in proximal TECs during kidney injury. Using the unilateral ureteric obstruction model in proximal tubule-specific autophagy-deficient mice, we demonstrated that ablation of epithelial ATG5 genes markedly impaired autophagy, resulting in enhanced nuclear factor κB (NF-κB) activation, macrophage and lymphocyte infiltration, and proinflammatory cytokines production in obstructed kidneys, as compared with wild-type mice. Following stimulation with angiotensin II (Ang II), siRNA silencing of ATG5 in cultured HK-2 cells or ATG5-deficient primary proximal TECs produced more cytokines, including IL-1β, IL-6, and TNF-α than did their control cells. Overexpressed ATG5, but not the autophagy-incompetent ATG5 mutant K130R in HK-2 cells, rendered resistant to Ang II-induced inflammatory response. Immunofluorescence assay indicated that ATG5 and p65 colocalized in the nucleus and cytoplasm, and their interaction was verified in immunoprecipitation assay from HEK-293T cell extracts. Genetic downregulation of endogenous ATG5 increased Ang II-induced phosphorylation and nuclear translocation of p65 and transcriptional activity of NF-κB, whereas the overexpressed ATG5, rather than ATG5 mutant K130R, hampered activation of NF-κB signaling, suggest an autophagy-dependent anti-inflammatory effect of ATG5. Further, pharmacological manipulation of autophagy yielded similar results both in vivo and in vitro. Additionally, JSH-23, a specific inhibitor of NF-κB nuclear translocation, rescued Ang II-driven IL-1β production in ATG5 siRNA-treated cells and decreased the proportion of cells in G2/M phase. In conclusion, ATG5-mediated autophagy in tubules targets NF-κB signaling to protect against renal inflammation.",Autophagy suppresses the pathogenic immune response to dietary antigens in cystic fibrosis.,https://www.ncbi.nlm.nih.gov/pubmed/30874543,Cell death & disease,2019 03 29,"Under physiological conditions, a finely tuned system of cellular adaptation allows the intestinal mucosa to maintain the gut barrier function while avoiding excessive immune responses to non-self-antigens from dietary origin or from commensal microbes. This homeostatic function is compromised in cystic fibrosis (CF) due to loss-of-function mutations in the CF transmembrane conductance regulator (CFTR). Recently, we reported that mice bearing defective CFTR are abnormally susceptible to a celiac disease-like enteropathy, in thus far that oral challenge with the gluten derivative gliadin elicits an inflammatory response. However, the mechanisms through which CFTR malfunction drives such an exaggerated response to dietary protein remains elusive. Here we demonstrate that the proteostasis regulator/transglutaminase 2 (TGM2) inhibitor cysteamine restores reduced Beclin 1 (BECN1) protein levels in mice bearing cysteamine-rescuable F508del-CFTR mutant, either in homozygosis or in compound heterozygosis with a null allele, but not in knock-out CFTR mice. When cysteamine restored BECN1 expression, autophagy was increased and gliadin-induced inflammation was reduced. The beneficial effects of cysteamine on F508del-CFTR mice were lost when these mice were backcrossed into a Becn1 haploinsufficient/autophagy-deficient background. Conversely, the transfection-enforced expression of BECN1 in human intestinal epithelial Caco-2 cells mitigated the pro-inflammatory cellular stress response elicited by the gliadin-derived P31-43 peptide. In conclusion, our data provide the proof-of-concept that autophagy stimulation may mitigate the intestinal malfunction of CF patients.",RBCK1 promotes p53 degradation via ubiquitination in renal cell carcinoma.,https://www.ncbi.nlm.nih.gov/pubmed/30874541,Cell death & disease,2019 03 29,"Renal cell carcinoma (RCC) accounts for approximately 3% of adult malignancies, and the incidence of RCC continues to rise worldwide. Although RCC can be treated with surgery at an early stages, the five-year survival rates have been observed to decline dramatically in patients with advanced disease. Most patients with RCC treated with cytotoxic or targeted drugs will develop resistance at some point during therapy. Thus, it is necessary to identify novel therapeutic targets for RCC. Here, we found that RANBP2-type and C3HC4-type zinc finger-containing 1 (RBCK1) expression was upregulated in human RCC samples. Analysis of multiple public databases revealed the correlation between RBCK1 expression and poor prognosis in RCC patients. Subsequently, we performed RBCK1 depletion experiments in RCC cells that severely affected the in vivo and in vitro proliferation of renal cancer cells. The effects of RBCK1 on cell proliferation could be rescued with p53 expression knockdown in two cell lines expressing wild-type p53. Further experiments demonstrated that RBCK1 could facilitate p53 poly-ubiquitination and degradation by direct interaction with p53. Together, our results show that RBCK1 may serve as a promising target for RCC therapy by restoring p53 functions."

PANI nanofibers were synthesized by the conventional interfacial polymerization method using ammonium persulphate as an oxidant in an acidic medium. The average diameter of the synthesized PANI nanofibers was found to be 60 ± 5 nm as detected by high resolution transmission electron microscope and scanning electron microscope techniques. The synthesized PANI nanofibers were characterized by fourier transform infrared spectroscopy, X-ray diffraction, UV-VIS spectroscopy, Brunauer-Emmett-Teller surface area analyzer (BET), zero energy thermonuclear apparatus and four-probe conductivity techniques and were further used for the adsorption of the MO dye from its aqueous solution using batch mode experiments. Due to their positively charged backbone, PANI nanofibers are found to be suitable for the adsorption of anionic dyes such as MO. The BET surface area of the synthesized polyaniline nanofibers was found to be 48.83 m2 g-1 (higher than conventionally synthesized polyaniline). The influence of important adsorption parameters, i.e. initial dye concentration, pH and duration of contact was also studied, and the equilibrium values of these parameters are noted to be 7 mg L-1, pH ∼7 and 80 min, respectively.

Although existing soft robotic hands can assist with finger flexion, few have addressed finger extension, which is a challenging task for stroke patients due to poststroke spasticity. In this article, we describe the design of a composite actuator, the soft-elastic composite actuator (SECA), to facilitate both finger flexion and extension. A double-segmented SECA comprising two serially connected fiber-reinforced actuators with two bottom torque-compensating layers was fabricated. The SECA bends and extends by pneumatic actuation, and the torque-compensating layers offer an assistive bending moment to configure the bending moment inside the SECA. The principles associated with selection of the torque-compensating layer are described. Analytical models were established to quantify the input pressure and the bending angle of SECA with free bending and when placed on a model compromised hand. The analytical models were validated experimentally and by the finite element method. Moreover, a stroke survivor was recruited to test the new robotic glove integrated with the multiple double-segmented SECA.

Fifty sub-acute stroke survivors (Age M = 70.30 SD = 15.80, 56% female) and their occupational therapist independently completed three measures assessing activity limitations (cognitive, physical, instrumental) and participation restrictions. Assessments were made of current functioning and predicted functioning at three months' post-discharge. Compared to physical functioning, appraisal discrepancies were more pronounced for cognitive functioning, instrumental activity limitation, and participation restriction. Discrepancies were more pronounced for current, as opposed to predicted, cognitive functioning (Z = -4.21, p < .001) and instrumental activity limitation (Z = -4.00, p < .001). Conversely, discrepancies in participation restriction were greatest for predicted functioning (Z = -4.03, p < .001). Follow-up (n = 39) showed that, compared to survivors' predictions, clinicians' predictions were more closely aligned with actual stroke survivor functioning at three months' post-discharge (as rated by a close other). These findings suggest appraisal discrepancy varies across disability domains and time reference points, with cognitive and complex functional activities being particularly discrepant between stroke survivors and clinicians.

In this study, we tested the hypothesis that laminin α4 (LAMA4) is implicated in glaucoma development by controlling apoptosis of retinal ganglion cells (RGCs) through the mitogen-activated protein kinase (MAPK) signaling pathway. Expression profiles and genes associated with glaucoma were searched to determine the objective gene. Intraocular pressure (IOP) rats model were established and IOP was measured. The mRNA and protein expression of LAMA4, JNK, p38 MAPK, ERK, Bcl-2, Bax, Caspase-9, and p53 was determined in concert with the treatment of H2O2, si-NC, or si-LAMA4 in cultured RGCs. Viability of RGCs, reactive oxygen species (ROS) and cell apoptosis was also measured. LAMA4 was selected as the study object because of its significant difference in two expression profiles. IOP of rats with glaucoma increased significantly after model establishment, and the LAMA4 protein expression in retinal tissue of rats with glaucoma was elevated. Down-regulation of LAMA4 could inhibit the mRNA and protein expression of LAMA4, JNK, p38 MAPK, ERK, Bax, Caspase-9, and p53, as well as restrain the apoptosis and ROS of RGCs, but improve Bcl-2 expression and viability of RGCs. Collectively, the obtained data supported that downregulated LAMA4 might reduce the oxidative stress-induced apoptosis of glaucoma RGCs by inhibiting the activation of the MAPK signaling pathway.","Asenapine maleate-loaded nanostructured lipid carriers: optimization and in vitro, ex vivo and in vivo evaluations.",https://www.ncbi.nlm.nih.gov/pubmed/30874464,"Nanomedicine (London, England)",2019 04 17,To prepare nanostructured lipid carriers (NLCs) loaded with asenapine maleate (ASPM) to increase its oral bioavailability by intestinal lymphatic uptake.,"Impressionist portraits of mitotic exit: APC/C, K11-linked ubiquitin chains and Cezanne.",https://www.ncbi.nlm.nih.gov/pubmed/30874463,"Cell cycle (Georgetown, Tex.)",2019 04 26,"The Anaphase-Promoting Complex/Cyclosome (APC/C) is an E3 ubiquitin ligase and a key regulator of cell cycle progression. By triggering the degradation of mitotic cyclins, APC/C controls cell cycle-dependent oscillations in cyclin-dependent kinase (CDK) activity. Thus, the dynamic activities of both APC/C and CDK sit at the core of the cell cycle oscillator. The APC/C controls a large number of substrates and is regulated through multiple mechanisms, including cofactor-dependent activation. These cofactors, Cdc20 and Cdh1, recognize substrates, while the specific E2 enzymes UBE2C/UbcH10 and UBE2S cooperate with APC/C to build K11-linked ubiquitin chains on substrates to target them for proteasomal degradation. However, whether deubiquitinating enzymes (DUBs) can antagonize APC/C substrate ubiquitination during mitosis has remained largely unknown. We recently demonstrated that Cezanne/OTUD7B is a cell cycle-regulated DUB that opposes the ubiquitination of APC/C substrates. Cezanne binds APC/C substrates, reverses their ubiquitination and protects them from degradation. Accordingly, Cezanne depletion accelerates APC/C substrate degradation, leading to errors in mitotic progression and formation of micronuclei. Moreover, Cezanne is significantly amplified and overexpressed in breast cancers. This suggests a potential role for APC/C antagonism in the pathogenesis of disease. APC/C contributes to chromosome segregation fidelity in mitosis raising the possibility that copy-number and expression changes in Cezanne observed in cancer contribute to the etiology of disease. Collectively, these observations identify a new player in cell cycle progression, define mechanisms of tempered APC/C substrate destruction and highlight the importance of this regulation in maintaining chromosome stability.",Ribosomal protein RPL22/eL22 regulates the cell cycle by acting as an inhibitor of the CDK4-cyclin D complex.,https://www.ncbi.nlm.nih.gov/pubmed/30874462,"Cell cycle (Georgetown, Tex.)",2019 04 26,"Senescence is a tumor suppressor program characterized by a stable growth arrest while maintaining cell viability. Senescence-associated ribogenesis defects (SARD) have been shown to regulate senescence through the ability of the ribosomal protein S14 (RPS14 or uS11) to bind and inhibit the cyclin-dependent kinase 4 (CDK4). Here we report another ribosomal protein that binds and inhibits CDK4 in senescent cells: L22 (RPL22 or eL22). Enforcing the expression of RPL22/eL22 is sufficient to induce an RB and p53-dependent cellular senescent phenotype in human fibroblasts. Mechanistically, RPL22/eL22 can interact with and inhibit CDK4-Cyclin D1 to decrease RB phosphorylation both in vitro and in cells. Briefly, we show that ribosome-free RPL22/eL22 causes a cell cycle arrest which could be relevant during situations of nucleolar stress such as cellular senescence or the response to cancer chemotherapy.",Piceatannol Mediated Modulation of Oxidative Stress and Regeneration in the Liver of Endotoxemic Mice.,https://www.ncbi.nlm.nih.gov/pubmed/30874461,Journal of medicinal food,2019 06 11,"Liver plays a pivotal role in host defense mechanisms related to endotoxemia. However, liver dysfunction often occurs in early sepsis. This study investigated the hepatoprotective potential of natural stilbenoid piceatannol (PIC) in lipopolysaccharide (LPS)-induced endotoxemic mice. Swiss Albino mice were divided into four groups: Control (C), LPS administrated (LPS), PIC administrated (PIC), and LPS administrated/PIC preadministrated (LPS+PIC) animals. PIC was administrated intraperitoneally (i.p.) at the dose of 4 mg/kg/day during 7 days. Endotoxemia was induced with a single i.p. administration of LPS at the dose of 4 mg/kg. Superoxide dismutase (SOD), catalase (CAT) and lipid peroxidation (LP) levels, light microscopic pathology, and genotoxicity were investigated. Proliferating cell nuclear antigen and SQSTM1/p62 immunofluorescence were measured. PIC preadministration restored SOD activity, reduced LP and genotoxicity. However, moderate level of oxidative stress (OS) had been progressed in PIC preadministrated animals depending upon prolonged autophagic response and selective degradation of CAT. Positive OS stimulated liver regeneration by upregulating oval cells' and downregulating hepatocytes' proliferation and resulted in the maintanence of hepatic tissue integrity in PIC preadministrated animals. These results suggested that PIC may be a useful hepatoprotective agent in LPS-induced endotoxemia as a modulator of OS and genotoxicity, as an inducer of autophagy, and as a promoter of liver regeneration.",Efficacy of Coupled Plasma Filtration Adsorption in Treating Patients with Severe Intra-Abdominal Infection: A Retrospective Study.,https://www.ncbi.nlm.nih.gov/pubmed/30874460,Journal of laparoendoscopic & advanced surgical techniques.

Our objective was to measure TL in leukocytes (LTL) and in skeletal muscle (MTL), which served as a proxy of TL at birth. The delta (MTL-LTL) represented life-long telomere attrition. Blood draws and skeletal muscle biopsies were performed on 35 Lebanese individuals undergoing surgery. Following DNA extraction, LTL and MTL were measured by Southern blot. In every individual aged between 30 and 85 years, MTL was longer than LTL. With age, MTL and LTL decreased, but the delta (MTL-LTL) increased by 14 bp/year.

There are many possible causes of myoclonus and both the etiology and characteristics of the myoclonus are important in securing the diagnosis and treatment. Myoclonus may be challenging to treat, as it frequently requires multiple medications for acceptable results. Few randomized controlled trials investigating the optimal treatment for myoclonus are available, and expert experience and case series guide treatment. Areas Covered: In this article, the authors review the basics of myoclonus and its classification. The authors discuss the current management of myoclonus and then focus on recent updates in the literature, including both pharmacologic and surgical options. Expert opinion: Myoclonus remains a challenge to manage, and there is a paucity of rigorous clinical trials guiding treatment paradigms. Furthermore, due to the etiological heterogeneity of myoclonus, defining the appropriate scope for high-quality clinical trials is challenging. In order to advance the field, the myoclonus study group needs to be revived in the US and abroad so that interested investigators can collaborate on multicenter clinical trials for myoclonus treatments.",Omics and the Search for Blood Biomarkers in COPD: Insights from COPDGene.,https://www.ncbi.nlm.nih.gov/pubmed/30874442,American journal of respiratory cell and molecular biology,2019 06 10,"There is an unmet need for blood biomarkers in diagnosis and prognosis of chronic obstructive pulmonary disease (COPD). The search for these biomarkers has been revolutionized by high throughput sequencing techniques and multiplex platforms which can measure thousands of gene transcripts, proteins, or metabolites. We review COPDGene publications which include DNA methylation, transcriptomics, proteomics, and metabolomic blood biomarkers and discuss their impact on COPD. Key contributions from COPDGene include: identification of DNA methylation effects from smoking and genetic variation; new transcriptomic signatures in the blood; identification of protein biomarkers associated with severity and progression (e.g. sRAGE (soluble receptor for advanced glycosylation end products), inflammatory cytokines IL-6 and IL-8); and identification of small molecules (ceramides and sphingomyelin) which may be pathogenic. COPDGene studies have revealed that some of the COPD GWAS polymorphisms are strongly associated with blood biomarkers (e.g. rs2070600 in AGER is a pQTL for sRAGE) underscoring the importance of combining omics results. Investigators have developed molecular networks identifying lower CD4+ resting memory cells associated with COPD. Genes, proteins, and metabolite networks are particularly important because the explanatory value of any single molecule is small (1-10% ) compared to panels of multiple markers. COPDGene has been a useful resource in the identification and validation of multiple biomarkers for COPD. These biomarkers, either combined in multiple biomarker panels or integrated with other omics data types, will hopefully one day lead to novel diagnostic and prognostic tests for COPD phenotypes and may be relevant for assessing novel therapies.",Convectively Assembled Monolayers of Colloidal Cubes: Evidence of Optimal Packings.,https://www.ncbi.nlm.nih.gov/pubmed/30874440,Langmuir : the ACS journal of surfaces and colloids,2019 04 09,"We employ a system of cubic colloids with rounded corners to study the close-packed monolayers that form via convective assembly.

We further show that shape details of the cube corners are important for the final packing symmetry, where the frequency of the Λ1-lattice increases with decreasing roundness of the corners, whereas the frequency of the Λ0-lattice is unaffected. The formation of both optimal packings is found to be a consequence of the out-of-equilibrium formation process, which leads to small shifts in rows of cubes, thereby transforming the Λ1-lattice into the Λ0-lattice.",Site-Selective Functionalization of Linear Diterpenoids through U-Shaped Folding in a Confined Artificial Cavity.,https://www.ncbi.nlm.nih.gov/pubmed/30874439,Journal of the American Chemical Society,2019 04 03,"Even flexible linear substrates are conformationally fixed within the hydrophobic confined cavities of enzymes.

The PEG NS assembly displayed a smaller red shift of the PL and a slight decrease of the energy difference between the A and B absorption peaks of WS2. However, increasing the dielectric function on the surface of WS2 has a small influence on their optical properties. The PEG NP assembly on WS2 exhibited a significant red shift of the PL spectrum and a large decrease of the energy difference between A and B absorption peaks.

Because free 3-sulfanylpentan-1-ol (21) has also been detected in hop, the present work aimed to identify its potential precursors. The compounds S-3-(1-hydroxylpentyl)cysteine (Cys-21) and S-3-(1-hydroxylpentyl)glutathione (G-21) were first synthesized and characterized by nuclear magnetic resonance and high-resolution mass spectrometry. High-performance liquid chromatography-positive electrospray ionization-tandem mass spectrometry evidenced both for the first time in hop. Both S conjugates were further quantitated in six hop samples: the well-known Saaz, Amarillo, Citra, Hallertau Blanc, Nelson Sauvin, and Polaris. Similar to G-23, G-21 appeared ubiquitous to all varieties. Of all of the samples investigated here, Citra (harvest 2017) emerged as the richest in G-21, with 18 mg/kg of dry matter. Cys-21 was found in all samples at a much lower concentration (up to 0.2 mg/kg of dry matter in Polaris, harvest 2017).

Patients with symptoms of PAD but a normal resting ABI can be further evaluated with exercise ABI testing. Routine ABI screening for those not at increased risk of PAD is not recommended. Treatment of PAD includes lifestyle modifications-including smoking cessation and supervised exercise therapy-plus secondary prevention medications, including antiplatelet therapy, angiotensin-converting enzyme inhibitors or angiotensin receptor blockers, and statins. Surgical revascularization should be considered for patients with lifestyle-limiting claudication who have an inadequate response to the aforementioned therapies. Patients with acute or limb-threatening limb ischemia should be referred immediately to a vascular surgeon.",Primary Care of Breast Cancer Survivors.,https://www.ncbi.nlm.nih.gov/pubmed/30874405,American family physician,2019 03 15,"With declining mortality rates, the number of breast cancer survivors is increasing. Ongoing care after breast cancer treatment is often provided by primary care physicians. This care includes surveillance for cancer recurrence with a history and physical examination every three to six months for the first three years after treatment, every six to 12 months for two more years, and annually thereafter. Mammography is performed annually. Magnetic resonance imaging of the breast is not indicated unless patients are at high risk of recurrence, such as having a hereditary cancer syndrome. Many breast cancer survivors experience long-term sequelae from the disease or treatment. Premature menopause with hot flashes can occur and is managed with pharmacologic and nonpharmacologic treatments. Vaginal dryness is treated with vaginal lubricants and gels. Because cardiotoxicity from chemotherapy is possible, clinicians should be alert for this complication and perform echocardiography if appropriate. Impaired cognition after chemotherapy is also common; treatment includes cognitive rehabilitation therapy. Patients with treatment-induced menopause develop decreased bone density and should receive dual energy x-ray absorptiometry and pharmacologic and nonpharmacologic therapies. Others experience lymphedema, often best managed with weight loss and complex decongestive therapy.

This H5N6 virus is a reassortant of HPAI H5N8 clade 2.3.4.4 group B viruses detected in Eurasia in 2016. H5N6 viruses were also detected in several dead wild birds during the winter. However, wild bird mortality was limited compared to the caused by the H5N8 group B virus in 2016-2017. H5N6 virus was not detected in wild birds after March, but in late summer infected wild birds were found again. In this study, the complete genome sequences of poultry and wild bird viruses were determined to study their genetic relationship. Genetic analysis showed that the outbreaks in poultry were not the result of farm-to-farm transmissions, but rather resulted from separate introductions from wild birds. Wild birds infected with viruses related to the first outbreak in poultry were found at short distances from the farm, within a short time frame. However, no wild bird viruses related to outbreaks 2 and 3 were detected. The H5N6 virus isolated in summer shares a common ancestor with the virus detected in outbreak 1. This suggests long-term circulation of H5N6 virus in the local wild bird population. In addition, the pathogenicity of H5N6 virus in ducks was determined, and compared to that of H5N8 viruses detected in 2014 and 2016. A similar high pathogenicity was measured for H5N6 and H5N8 group B viruses, suggesting that biological or ecological factors in the wild bird population may have affected the mortality rates during the H5N6 epidemic.

Part A,2019 04 29,"Cornelia de Lange Syndrome (CdLS), due to mutations in genes of the cohesin protein complex, is described as a disorder of transcriptional regulation. Phenotypes in this expanding field include short stature, microcephaly, intellectual disability, variable facial features and organ involvement, resulting in overlapping presentations, including established syndromes and newly described conditions. Individuals with all forms of CdLS have multifaceted complications, including neurodevelopmental, feeding, craniofacial, and communication. Coping mechanisms and management of challenging behaviors in CdLS, disruption of normal behaviors, and how behavior molds the life of the individual within the family is now better understood. Some psychotropic medications are known to be effective for behavior. Other medications, for example, Indomethacin, are being investigated for effects on gene expression, fetal brain tissue, brain morphology and function in Drosophila, mice, and human fibroblasts containing CdLS-related mutations. Developmental studies have clarified the origin of cardiac defects and role of placenta in CdLS. Chromosome architecture and cohesin complex structure are elucidated, leading to a better understanding of regulatory aspects and controls. As examples, when mutations are present, the formation of loop domains by cohesin, facilitating enhancer-promotor interactions, can be eliminated, and embryologically, the nuclear structure of zygotes is disrupted. Several important genes are now known to interact with cohesin, including Brca2.

Previous studies show that DLL3 is highly expressed in small cell lung cancer (SCLC) but not in normal lung tissue, suggesting that DLL3 might be associated with neuroendocrine tumorigenesis. However, its role in SCLC remains unclear. To investigate the role of DLL3 in tumorigenesis in SCLC, we performed loss-of-function and gain-of-function assays using SCLC cell lines. In vitro analysis of cell migration and invasion by transwell assay showed that DLL3 knockdown reduced migration and invasion of SCLC cells, whereas DLL3 overexpression increased these activities. In addition, DLL3 positively regulated SNAI1 expression and knockdown of SNAI1 attenuated the migration and invasion ability of SCLC cells. Moreover, upregulated DLL3 expression induced subcutaneous tumor growth in mouse models. These results indicate that DLL3 promoted tumor growth, migration and invasion in an SCLC model by modulating SNAI1/Snail.",TFH cells in bystander and cognate interactions with B cells.,https://www.ncbi.nlm.nih.gov/pubmed/30874359,Immunological reviews,2019 03 15,"Follicular T-helper (TFH ) cells play a crucial role in three aspects of the germinal center (GC) response. They promote GC formation, arbitrate competition among GC B cells to determine the outcome of affinity maturation, and regulate GC output of memory and plasma cells to shape the long-lived humoral immune memory. Of fundamental importance are dynamic physical interactions between TFH and B cells, which are the main platform for TFH cells to deliver ""help"" factors to B cells and also for reciprocal signaling from B cells to maintain the helper state of TFH cells. Recent work has significantly expanded our understanding of how T-B interactions are spatiotemporally regulated and molecularly orchestrated to fulfill those TFH functions. In this review, we elaborate two modes of T-B interactions, the antigen-specific or cognate mode in which TFH cells engage individual antigen-presenting B cells and the antigen nonspecific bystander mode in which TFH cells are engaged with the ensemble of follicular B cells. We discuss findings that indicate how short-lived cognate T-B contacts coupled with an intercellular positive feedback drive affinity-based selection and how bystander interactions between T and B cells regulate follicular T-cell recruitment and maintenance of an appropriate helper state. We argue that this combination of bystander and cognate interactions with B cells constantly shapes the internal state of TFH cells and provides the platform to execute their helper functions.","T-bet+ memory B cells: Generation, function, and fate.",https://www.ncbi.nlm.nih.gov/pubmed/30874358,Immunological reviews,2019 03 15,"B cells expressing the transcription factor T-bet have emerged as participants in a number of protective and pathogenic immune responses. T-bet+ B cells characteristically differentiate in response to combined Toll-like receptor and cytokine signaling, contribute to protective immunity against intracellular pathogens via IgG2a/c production and antibody-independent mechanisms, and are prone to produce autoantibodies. Despite recent advances, a number of questions remain regarding the basic biology of T-bet+ B cells and their functional niche within the immune system. Herein, we review the discovery and defining characteristics of the T-bet+ B cell subset in both mice and humans. We further discuss their origins, the basis for their persistence, and their potential fate in vivo. Evidence indicates that T-bet+ B cells represent a distinct, germinal center-derived memory population that may serve as an important therapeutic target for the improvement of humoral immunity and prevention of autoimmunity.",The continuing story of T-cell independent antibodies.,https://www.ncbi.nlm.nih.gov/pubmed/30874357,Immunological reviews,2019 03 15,"The purpose of this article is to review the role of extrafollicular and T-cell independent antibody responses in humoral immunity. We consider two interrelated questions: (a) do T-cell independent antibody responses dominated by IgM and/or IgA play unique functions in immunity and homeostasis; and (b) is it typical for these responses to result in lifelong protection? In addressing these questions, we consider the established advantages of T-cell driven responses including the unique role played by germinal center reactions in these responses, and contrast the processes and outcomes of germinal center-centric responses with germinal center- and T-cell independent antibodies. We suggest that T-independent and other extrafollicular responses contribute substantially to highly stable antibody repertoires in both the serum and the intestine, providing relatively constitutive humoral barriers with the collective dual function of protecting against invading pathogens and regulating the composition of non-pathogenic microbial communities.",Plasma cells: You are what you eat.,https://www.ncbi.nlm.nih.gov/pubmed/30874356,Immunological reviews,2019 03 29,"Plasma cells are terminally differentiated B lymphocytes that constitutively secrete antibodies. These antibodies can provide protection against pathogens, and their quantity and quality are the best clinical correlates of vaccine efficacy. As such, plasma cell lifespan is the primary determinant of the duration of humoral immunity. Yet dysregulation of plasma cell function can cause autoimmunity or multiple myeloma. The longevity of plasma cells is primarily dictated by nutrient uptake and non-transcriptionally regulated metabolic pathways. We have previously shown a positive effect of glucose uptake and catabolism on plasma cell longevity and function. In this review, we discuss these findings with an emphasis on nutrient uptake and its effects on respiratory capacity, lifespan, endoplasmic reticulum stress, and antibody secretion in plasma cells. We further discuss how some of these pathways may be dysregulated in multiple myeloma, potentially providing new therapeutic targets. Finally, we speculate on the connection between plasma cell intrinsic metabolism and systemic changes in nutrient availability and metabolic diseases.","T cell interactions with B cells during germinal center formation, a three-step model.",https://www.ncbi.nlm.nih.gov/pubmed/30874355,Immunological reviews,2019 03 15,"Establishment of effective immunity against invading microbes depends on continuous generation of antibodies that facilitate pathogen clearance. Long-lived plasma cells with the capacity to produce high affinity antibodies evolve in germinal centers (GCs), where B cells undergo somatic hypermutation and are subjected to affinity-based selection. Here, we focus on the cellular interactions that take place early in the antibody immune response during GC colonization. Clones bearing B-cell receptors with different affinities and specificities compete for entry to the GC, at the boundary between the B-cell and T-cell zones in lymphoid organs. During this process, B cells compete for interactions with T follicular helper cells, which provide selection signals required for differentiation into GC cells and antibody secreting cells. These cellular engagements are long-lasting and depend on activation of adhesion molecules that support persistent interactions and promote transmission of signals between the cells. Here, we discuss how interactions between cognate T and B cells are primarily maintained by three types of molecular interactions: homophilic signaling lymphocytic activation molecule (SLAM) interactions, T-cell receptor: peptide-loaded major histocompatibility class II (pMHCII), and LFA-1:ICAMs. These essential components support a three-step process that controls clonal selection for entry into the antibody affinity maturation response in the GC, and establishment of long-lasting antibody-mediated immunity."

Optimal activity, with the highest yield (2.441 g/L) and surface tension-reducing activity (24.38 mN/m), was observed when the cells were grown on olive oil as their sole source of carbon at pH 8.0. The rhamnolipid biosurfactant showed environmental stability at a variety of NaCl concentrations (2-20%) and pH values (2-12) even under acidic conditions. Of the initial anthracene, 66% was solubilized by 100% crude biosurfactant. Furthermore, 100% crude biosurfactant desorbed 81% of the anthracene in sediment into the aqueous phase. These results suggest that the rhamnolipid biosurfactant produced from R. fascians SDRB-G7 is a promising candidate for polycyclic aromatic hydrocarbon (PAH) removal from the sediment and can be an effective agent for processes that bioremediate PAHs such as surfactant-enhanced remediation.

Therefore, species differences should be taken into consideration when assessing the risk of rodent hepatocarcinogens metabolically activated by SULT1A in humans. Although some renal carcinogens require SULT1A-mediated activation, it is unclear how SULT1A activity in the liver affects renal carcinogens. To explore the effects of SULT1A activity in the liver on genotoxicity induced by SULT1A-activated renal carcinogens, B6C3F1 mice or gpt delta mice of the same strain background were given lucidin-3-O-primeveroside (LuP), a hepatic and renal carcinogen of rodents, for 4 or 13 weeks, respectively, and pentachlorophenol (PCP) as a liver-specific SULT inhibitor, was given from 1 week before LuP treatment to the end of the experiment. A 4 week exposure of LuP induced lucidin-specific DNA adduct formation. The suppression of Sult1a expression was observed only in the liver but not in the kidneys of PCP-treated mice, but co-administration of PCP suppressed LuP-induced DNA adduct formation in both organs. Thirteen-week exposure of LuP increased mutation frequencies and cotreatment with PCP suppressed these increases in both organs. Given that intact levels of SULT activity in the liver were much higher than in the kidneys of rodents, SULT1A may predominantly activate LuP in the liver, consequently leading to genotoxicity not only in the liver but also in the kidney. Thus, species differences should be considered in human risk assessment of renal carcinogens activated by SULT1A as in the case of the corresponding liver carcinogens.",Magnitude-intrinsic water-fat ambiguity can be resolved with multipeak fat modeling and a multipoint search method.,https://www.ncbi.nlm.nih.gov/pubmed/30874334,Magnetic resonance in medicine,2019 04 30,"To develop a postprocessing algorithm for multiecho chemical-shift encoded water-fat separation that estimates proton density fat fraction (PDFF) maps over the full dynamic range (0-100%) using multipeak fat modeling and multipoint search optimization.

This paper applies notions of surveillance to public reporting of cardiac surgery, involving the online publication of mortality rates of named surgeons. It draws on qualitative data from a case-study of cardiac surgeons in one hospital, incorporating interviews with health care managers and national policymakers in England. We examine how managerial logics are mediated by professional autonomy, generating patterns of enrolment, resistance and reactivity to public reporting. The managerial 'gaze' of public reporting is becoming widespread but the surgical specialty is accommodating it, leading to a re-assertion of knowledge, based on professional definitions. The paper assesses whether this form of surveillance is challenging to or being assimilated by the medical profession, thereby recasting the profession itself.",Navigating the university transition among women who self-report an eating disorder: A qualitative study.,https://www.ncbi.nlm.nih.gov/pubmed/30874327,The International journal of eating disorders,2019 03 15,"Although developmental milestones have been observed to alter eating disorder (ED) symptom burden, it remains unknown how the transition to university affects symptomatology.

The problem with this binary, however, is that it cannot account for the full spectrum of responsibilities and social norms that parents enact in vaccine decisions. In this paper, and in the context of low HPV vaccination rates, I confront this binary and encourage a fuller view of adolescent health and sexual health. Using data from qualitative semi-structured interviews with 28 Canadian mothers tasked with consenting to the HPV vaccine, I examine the complexity of this responsibility. I find HPV vaccine-consenting mothers have normative conceptualisations of responsibility aligned with dominant interpretations of public health. Rather than expressing irresponsibility, some non-HPV vaccine-consenting mothers articulated alternate responsibilities, aligned with broad efforts to manage their teens' sexual health and sexuality. They extend responsibility beyond cancer protection vis-à-vis vaccines to a general responsibility for daughters' sexual health and self-esteem. In conclusion, I recommend the need for a broader public health approach to HPV, which includes, and goes beyond vaccination. Moreover, I suggest that some of these alternate responsibilities be viewed as complementary to vaccination."

To this end, we used in-game attributes to parametrically manipulate 2- and 3-point shooting in a commercially available basketball video game. The behavior of 6 of 9 participants conformed to the generalized matching equation.

This pattern among extant species suggests that ancestral shifts between forest and open habitats may have coincided with changes in leaf shape or size. We tested relationships between habitat, climate, photosynthetic pathway, and leaf shape and size in a phylogenetic framework to evaluate drivers of leaf shape and size variation over the evolutionary history of the family. We also estimated the ancestral habitat of Poaceae and tested whether forest margins served as transitional zones for shifts between forests and grasslands. We found that grass leaf shape is converging toward different shape optima in the forest understory, forest margins, and open habitats. Leaf size also varies with habitat. Grasses have smaller leaves in open and drier areas, and in areas with high solar irradiance. Direct transitions between linear and ovate leaves are rare as are direct shifts between forest and open habitats. The most likely ancestral habitat of the family was the forest understory and forest margins along with an intermediate leaf shape served as important transitional habitat and morphology, respectively, for subsequent shifts across forest-grassland biome boundaries.",Selection on structural allelic variation biases plasticity estimates.,https://www.ncbi.nlm.nih.gov/pubmed/30874299,Evolution; international journal of organic evolution,2019 05 07,"Wang and Althoff (2019) explored the capacity of Drosophila melanogaster to exhibit adaptive plasticity in a novel environment. In a full-sib, half-sib design, they scored the activity of the enzyme alcohol dehydrogenase (ADH) and plastic responses, measured as changes in ADH activity across ethanol concentrations in the range of 0-10% (natural variation) and 16% (the novel environment). ADH activity increased with alcohol concentration, and there was a positive association between larval viability and ADH activity in the novel environment. They also reported that families exhibiting greater plasticity had higher larval survival in the novel environment, concluding that ADH plasticity is adaptive. However, the four authors now concur that, since the study estimated plasticity from phenotypic differences across environments using full-sib families, it is not possible to disentangle the contributions of allele frequency changes at the Adh locus from regulatory control at loci known to influence ADH activity. Selective changes in allele frequencies may thus conflate estimates of plasticity; any type of ""plasticity"" (adaptive, neutral, or maladaptive) could be inferred depending on allele frequencies. The problem of scoring sib-groups after selection should be considered in any plasticity study that cannot use replicated genotypes. Researchers should monitor changes in allele frequencies as one mechanism to deal with this issue.",β3 -Adrenoceptor as a potential immuno-suppressor agent in melanoma.,https://www.ncbi.nlm.nih.gov/pubmed/30874296,British journal of pharmacology,2019 05 10,"Stress-related catecholamines have a role in cancer and β-adrenoceptors; specifically, β2 -adrenoceptors have been identified as new targets in treating melanoma.

However, because >90% of human cancers arise via carcinogen-induced somatic mutations, we investigated, herein, the role that different types and levels of CHO, protein and lipid play in lung cancer induced by the tobacco-specific carcinogen, nicotine-derived nitrosamine ketone (NNK) in A/J mice. We found lowering CHO levels significantly reduced lung nodules and blood glucose levels. We also found that soy protein was superior to casein and that coconut oil was ineffective at reducing lung nodules. Diets containing amylose or inulin (at 15% of total calories), soy protein (at 35%) and fat (at 50%, 30% being fish oil) were the most effective at reducing lung nodules. These fish oil-containing diets increased plasma levels of the ketone body, β-hydroxybutyrate, while reducing both insulin and 8-isoprostane in plasma and bronchoalveolar interleukin-12 and lung PGE2 levels. After only 2 weeks on this diet, the levels of γ-H2AX were significantly reduced, 24 hours after NNK treatment. Housing these mice in two-tiered rat cages with exercise wheels led to similar mouse weights on the different diets, whereas keeping mice in standard mouse cages led to both significant weight differences between the low-CHO, soy protein, fish oil diet and Western diet and substantially more lung nodules than in the two-tiered cages.

Therefore, a triple conjugated system was developed with carbon dots (C-dots), which have an average particle size of 1.5-1.7 nm. C-dots were conjugated with transferrin (the targeted ligand) and two anti-cancer drugs, epirubicin and temozolomide, to build the triple conjugated system in which the average particle size was increased only up to 3.5 nm. In vitro studies were performed with glioblastoma brain tumor cell lines SJGBM2, CHLA266, CHLA200 (pediatric) and U87 (adult). The efficacy of the triple conjugated system (dual drug conjugation along with transferrin) was compared to those of dual conjugated systems (single drug conjugation along with transferrin), non-transferrin C-dots-drugs, and free drug combinations. Transferrin conjugated samples displayed the lowest cell viability even at a lower concentration. Among the transferrin conjugated samples, the triple conjugated system (C-dots-trans-temo-epi (C-DT)) was more strongly cytotoxic to brain tumor cell lines than dual conjugated systems (C-dots-trans-temo (C-TT) and C-dots-trans-epi (C-ET)). C-DT increased the cytotoxicity to 86% in SJGBM2 at 0.01 μM while C-ET and C-TT reduced it only to 33 and 8%, respectively. Not only did triple conjugated C-DT increase the cytotoxicity, but also the two-drug combination in C-DT displayed a synergistic effect.","A visible-light-induced cascade reaction of etherification/C-C cyclization: efficient synthesis of dibenzo[b,d]oxepin-7(6H)-ones.",https://www.ncbi.nlm.nih.gov/pubmed/30874283,Organic & biomolecular chemistry,2019 03 28,"A visible-light-induced palladium-catalyzed cascade reaction was developed by etherification/C-C coupling cyclization of α-bromoacetophenones with phenols.

In biological environments, the Chl chromophores occur in two distinct diastereotopic configurations, where the α and β configurations have a magnesium-ligating histidine residue and a 17-propionic acid moiety on the opposite side or on the same side of the Chl ring, respectively. Although β-ligated Chl dimers occupy conserved positions around the reaction center of photosystem I (PSI), the functional relevance of the α/β configuration of the ligation is poorly understood. We employ here correlated ab initio calculations using the algebraic-diagrammatic construction through second order (ADC(2)) and the approximate second-order coupled cluster (CC2) methods in combination with the reduced virtual space (RVS) approach in studies of the intrinsic excited-state properties of α-ligated and β-ligated Chl dimers of PSI. Our ab initio calculations suggest that the absorption of the α-ligated reaction-center Chl dimer of PSI is redshifted by 0.13-0.14 eV in comparison to the β-ligated dimers due to combined excitonic coupling and strain effects. We also show that time-dependent density functional theory (TDDFT) calculations using range-separated density functionals underestimate the absorption shift between the α- and β-ligated dimers.

It was reported that when Si atoms are deposited on the HOPG surface at room temperature, they arrange into two configurations: silicene nanosheets and three-dimensional clusters. In this work we demonstrate, by using scanning tunneling microscopy (STM) and Raman spectroscopy, that a third configuration stabilizes in the form of Si 2D nanosheets intercalated below the first top layer of carbon atoms. The Raman spectra reveal a structure located at 538 cm-1 which we ascribe to the presence of sp2 Si hybridization. Moreover, the silicon deposition induces several modifications in the graphite D and G Raman modes, which we interpret as experimental evidence of the intercalation of the silicene nanosheets. The Si atom intercalation at room temperature takes place at the HOPG step edges and it detaches only the outermost graphite layer inducing a strong tensile strain mainly concentrated on the edges of the silicene nanosheets. Theoretical calculations of the structure and energetic viability of the silicene nanosheets and of the strain distribution on the outermost graphite layer and its influence on the Raman resonances support the STM and Raman observations.",Slow relaxation of magnetization in a {Fe6Dy} complex deriving from a family of highly symmetric metallacryptands.,https://www.ncbi.nlm.nih.gov/pubmed/30874279,"Dalton transactions (Cambridge, England : 2003)",2019 04 15,"The synthesis and characterization of a new family of isostructural {Fe6Ln} complexes, (pipH)3{Fe6Ln(shiH)3(shi)6}·1.5 pip·xH2O (Ln = Gd (1), Dy (2), Tb (3) and Y (4), pip = piperidine, and shi3- = salicylhydroxamic acid) is reported.

By applying a topological (leap-frog) dual operation followed by boron capping, we demonstrated that such a quasi-planar structure actually comes from the smallest elongated B102-, and its high thermodynamic stability is due to its inherent disk aromaticity arising from its 32 valent π electrons that fully occupy a disk configuration of [(1σ)2(1π)4(1δ)4(2σ)2(1φ)4(2π)4(1γ)4(2δ)4(1η)4].

The current study explored the effects of vitexin on high fat diet (HFD)-induced obesity/adipogenesis in male C57BL/6J mice and 3T3-L1 adipocytes, as well as the underlying mechanisms thereof. Vitexin significantly mitigated HFD-induced body weight gain and adiposity. Vitexin also partially normalized serum, hepatic lipid contents, and decreased adipocyte size induced by the HFD. Consistently, there were significant effects of vitexin on important regulators of lipid metabolism, including AMP-activated protein kinase-α (AMPKα), CAATT element binding protein-α (C/EBPα), and fatty acid synthase (FAS) in white adipose tissue. Moreover, vitexin significantly inhibited fat accumulation in 3T3-L1 adipocytes, and this was totally abolished by compound C (an AMPKα inhibitor). These results suggest that vitexin may prevent HFD-induced obesity/adipogenesis via the AMPKα mediated pathway.","Conjugated, rigidified bibenzimidazole ancillary ligands for enhanced photoluminescence quantum yields of orange/red-emitting iridium(iii) complexes.",https://www.ncbi.nlm.nih.gov/pubmed/30874276,"Dalton transactions (Cambridge, England : 2003)",2019 03 15,"A series of six novel [Ir(C^N)2(N^N)](PF6) complexes (C^N is one of two cyclometalating ligands: 2-phenyl-4-(2,4,6-trimethylphenyl)pyridine, MesppyH, or 2-(napthalen-1-yl)-4-(2,4,6-trimethylphenyl)pyridine, MesnpyH; N^N denotes one of four neutral diamine ligands: 4,4'-di-tert-butyl-2,2'-bipyridine, dtbubpy, 1H,1'H-2,2'-bibenzimiazole, H2bibenz, 1,1'-(α,α'-o-xylylene)-2,2'-bibenzimidazole, o-xylbibenz or 2,2'-biquinoline, biq) were synthesised and their structural, electrochemical and photophysical properties comprehensively characterised.

The H2bibenz and o-xylbibenz ligands are shown to be electronically indistinct to dtbubpy but give complexes with higher quantum yields than analogous complexes bearing dtbubpy. In particular, the rigidity of the o-xylbibenz ligand, combined with the steric bulk of the MesnpyH C^N ligands, gives a red-emitting complex 4 (λPL = 586, 623 nm) with a very high photoluminescence quantum yield (ΦPL = 44%) for an emitter in that region of the visible spectrum. These results suggest that employing these ligands is a viable strategy for designing more efficient orange-red emitters for use in a variety of photophysical applications."

However, morphology control of the Zn negative electrode during charge/discharge (Zn-deposition/stripping) is essential for practical application. Considering the manufacturing process, a simple strategy is preferable. Herein, we employed surfactants as an inhibitor of the formation of mossy and dendrite Zn structures, and studied electrochemical Zn growth from the perspective of the electric charge of the surfactant. Even by using an additive free electrolyte of 0.25 M ZnO + 4 M KOH and with 1 mM sodium dodecyl sulfate (SDS: anionic surfactant) or polyacrylic acid (PAA: non-ionic surfactant), mossy and dendrite formations were unavoidable irrespective of the current density. On the other hand, a cationic surfactant, trimethyloctadecylammonium chloride (STAC), suppressed the shape change and resulted in a smooth and dense morphology. Zeta potential measurements, kinetic current densities observed from Tafel plots, and constant potential electrolysis indicate that quaternary ammonium cations (STAC) with bulky size adsorb onto protrusions which are the cause of shape change and suppress Zn deposition in the region to promote lateral growth. Although the adsorption of STAC increased the average overvoltage for Zn-deposition/stripping in a symmetric Zn|Zn cell under a current density of 10 mA cm-2, significantly stable behavior continued for 200 h. In contrast, the overvoltage of the additive free system suddenly increased after 156 h, associated with the accumulation of insulating ZnO and Zn(OH)2 formed on the Zn surface. In charge-discharge tests using an asymmetric Cu|Zn cell, the coulombic efficiency in the additive free electrolyte was less than 95%, whereas the addition of STAC at 1 mM achieved superior cycling performance without any capacity loss originating from the generation of dead Zn (electrical isolation). These results demonstrate that the addition of STAC is a promising method of controlling the Zn morphology.",A far-red fluorescent probe for sensing laccase in fungi and its application in developing an effective biocatalyst for the biosynthesis of antituberculous dicoumarin.,https://www.ncbi.nlm.nih.gov/pubmed/30874262,"Chemical communications (Cambridge, England)",2019 04 08,A far-red fluorescent probe has been developed for sensing fungal laccase.

Specifically, the proposed approach exploits the spatial information of an RGB image by grouping pixels with similar characteristics into superpixels and fuses such features with the spectral information of an HS image.

First, the generated fringes can be approximated by a pure sinusoidal pattern; thereby, computational methods developed for sinusoidal SI can be used without the need for additional processing. Second, the SI pattern's period can be continuously varied up to the cutoff frequency of the native widefield system.

A non-accelerated aging test with 10 LED lamps is conducted for 20,000 h (from March 2016 to now) under room temperature, which is long enough for this kind of lamp reaching the real lifetime with the normalized luminous flux dropping to 70% naturally. At different aging periods, the correspondent lifetime of each sample is predicted by the lumen degradation, and the median lifetime τ0.5 of 10 samples is obtained by applying the Weibull distribution. Result shows that the τ0.5 of the real lifetime is 16,867 h in this work, and the aging time should be at least 9000 h to make the error in predicting the lifetime less than 3%. On the other hand, the Du'v' values of 0.006, 0.007, and 0.008 are taken as the three thresholds for predicting the lifetime by color shift.

To reduce these errors, a CAR is redesigned by introducing a reference glass with a known refractive index so that an exact calibration curve can always be determined, even though intense mechanical vibrations exist. To verify the insensitivity to these vibrations, the refractive index is monitored while the peak acceleration of the vibration is approximately 14  m/s2. The SRCAR is also used to measure a sample under different temperatures to verify the insensitivity to temperature fluctuations.

Mode splitting can be enhanced due to the interference between localized and axial modes as the effect of near-end surface coupling, validated by the coupled-mode model. Besides, we also demonstrate that the coupling angle between the fiber taper and cylindrical microcavity can efficiently affect the mode suppression in the transmission spectrum. Such a device has a simple structure, simple fabrication process, and simple mechanism to tailor the mode splitting and suppression for applications in cavity quantum electrodynamics, sensitive sensing, and other topics of photonics.","Self-beating resonant optical gyroscope with a ""reflector"": the possibility of high sensitivities at reduced costs.",https://www.ncbi.nlm.nih.gov/pubmed/30874211,Applied optics,2019 03 18,"Using simulations and theoretical analysis, we present an innovative readout technique that uses the change in a beat frequency signal for sensing rotation in the resonant fiber gyroscope with a ""reflector.""

The configuration includes two cascaded delay loops, and the parallel-coupled microresonators (PCMRs) in one of two loops result in a frequency-dependent group delay. The largest Lyapunov exponent (LLE), Lempel-Ziv complexity (LZC) and permutation entropy (PE) are used to distinguish the chaotic behavior and the degree of complexity in a time series, and the autocorrelation function (ACF) and the delayed mutual information (DMI) are plotted to extract the TD. The corresponding diagrams show that in the electro-optic system phase chaos with high complexity can occur within a certain range of feedback strength. The diagrams also show that, at a fixed feedback strength, the effect of the TD concealment becomes quite good with an increase in the number of PCMRs. The numerical simulation also reveals that the delayed chaotic dynamics can be identically synchronized, and the synchronization solution is robust. Moreover, based on the coherence of Mach-Zehnder interferometers, we convert the phase variations of the transmitter outputs and the receiver into the corresponding intensity variations, so the synchronization error of the two-phase chaotic series can be monitored. At last, we can successfully decipher the message introduced on the transmitting end of a link. In this scheme, the feedback TD has been concealed, which prevents eavesdroppers from listening and makes the proposed chaotic communication system secure.",Dual-wavelength terahertz sensing based on anisotropic Fano resonance metamaterials.,https://www.ncbi.nlm.nih.gov/pubmed/30874203,Applied optics,2019 03 18,"Higher order Fano resonance metamaterials provide a desirable platform for biosensing applications. In this work we exhibit higher order Fano modes by designing an elliptical metallic ring. The simulation results show that for Fano resonant metamaterials, the higher order modes lead to improved sensitivity to refractive index change and larger frequency shifts. Numerically, the sensitivity of dip A (quadrupole mode) is 112 GHz/RIU, whereas the sensitivity of dip B (octupole mode) is 234 GHz/RIU, over 2 times that of dip A. According to our experimental results, the Fano resonant frequencies of dip A and dip B exhibit redshift as the concentration of the anti-cancer drug methotrexate decreases from 120 to 90 μM, with the cell analyte concentration of A549 cells at 5×105  cell/ml. For dip A (quadrupole mode), there is a frequency shift of 0.84 GHz for drug concentration of 120 μM and a frequency shift of 22 GHz for a 90 μM drug-treated sample.

Furthermore, the frequency shift of dip A is always smaller than that of dip B for both 90 μM and 120 μM drug concentrations. Such phenomena indicate that dip B is much more sensitive than dip A.

The coded apertures in these systems, whose main function is the modulation of the data cube, are often implemented through photomasks attached to piezoelectric devices. A remarkable improvement on this configuration has been recently proposed, the replacement of the block-unblock coded apertures by patterned optical filter arrays, referred to as ""colored"" coded apertures, which allow spatial and spectral modulation. When using these colored coded apertures, its real implementation in terms of cost and complexity directly depends on the number of filters to be used, as well as the number of shots to be captured. A shifting colored coded aperture optimization featuring these observations is proposed, with the aim to improve the imaging quality reconstruction and to generate an achievable optical implementation with a limited number of filters requiring only one mask to acquire any number of shots. The mathematical model of the computational imaging strategy to overcome the practical limitations of actual CSI systems is presented along with a testbed implementation.

A, Optics, image science, and vision",2019 03 15,"During the past few years, several instruments for color measurement have become commercially available at unprecedented low prices. Although these instruments are no spectrophotometers, their price-performance ratio may be attractive for applications that do not require the high accuracy of traditional instruments. We investigated the performance of this class of instruments. These instruments typically do not provide spectral reflectance data, and some do not even produce colorimetric data such as CIELab coordinates. Therefore, in this investigation we express performance of the devices as the percentage of correctly identified color chips in color documentations (fan decks) such as those from RAL and Dulux CP5. Based on statistical physics, we develop a mathematical model that predicts the performance of a low-cost color instrument. This performance is shown to depend mainly on (i) the measurement precision of the instrument, and on (ii) the density of chip color coordinates in the color documentation. The new model makes it possible to compare test results from different instruments, even if they were obtained with different color documentations.

When the two points of observation coincide, these correlations reduce to ""Stokes scintillations."" Our work reveals a new layer of complexity in random beams by showing that the HBT effect and the scintillation coefficient are just two of many correlations that are present.

As a consequence, the sampling approach, which has been recently introduced for computing the eigenwavefronts of some band-limited linear space-invariant imaging systems, cannot be used as such. To overcome this drawback, it is shown that the kernel function can be recast as a varying band-limited function. This allows exploiting the pseudo-sampling series theory from which a sampling approximation of the kernel function is derived and eventually used to set the discrete eigenvalue problem. In particular, unlike the classical sampling approach, the sampling points turn out to be non-uniformly distributed. Some numerical examples are used to check the theory.

A, Optics, image science, and vision",2019 03 15,"An experimental and theoretical investigation of the preparation and exposure of multilayer photosensitive materials is presented. It is shown how the recorded change in the refractive index in each layer depends on the dye (photosensitizer) concentrations in each layer. It is also shown how the photosensitive material properties in each layer can be controlled to optimize some recording characteristics for particular applications. To do so, a set of equations, predicting the amplitude of higher harmonics refractive index amplitudes induced in the material layers with depth during exposure, is derived. This results in a technique for varying the dye concentration in each layer of a multilayer, so as to optimize volume diffraction grating performance. In part I of this paper, the 3D nonlocal photopolymerization-driven diffusion (NPDD) model is applied to calculate the resulting combined multilayer absorption and polymerization processes. The NPDD describes the time-varying behaviors taking place during exposure in such photopolymer materials. Simulations are performed for an acrylamide/polyvinyl alcohol-based photopolymer containing erythrosine-B dye. It is predicted that, in general, non-uniform gratings are formed, with the resulting refractive index being distorted both from the ideal sinusoidal cross-sectional spatial distribution and also with depth. This agrees with previous results indicating that increasing the thickness of a single photopolymer layer does not in practice lead to ever-increasing angular selectivity.

It is shown that the spectral behavior of the far-zone scattered field is influenced by the structural function width of the dielectric susceptibility of the scattering medium. In particular, the structural function width of the dielectric susceptibility of the scattering medium plays an important role in the direction at which the spectral switch occurs. These results may have potential applications in areas such as the inverse scattering problem.",Defocus optical transfer function: fast evaluation and lightweight storage based on cubic spline interpolation.,https://www.ncbi.nlm.nih.gov/pubmed/30874180,"Journal of the Optical Society of America. A, Optics, image science, and vision",2019 03 15,"Certain problems of image processing and 3D optical sectioning require the knowledge of defocus optical transfer function (OTF) with high resolution but its computation is not trivial: the OTF is an oscillatory integral. To efficiently compute the defocus OTF of a linear isoplanatic imaging system in incoherent illumination with a given accuracy on a fine grid, we suggest using cubic spline interpolation. The approximation error analysis of the splines shows that our method requires fewer OTF point evaluations than the direct evaluation at each grid point. The cubic spline also is a compact representation of the OTF and can be used to resolve data transfer bottlenecks and the lack of storage difficulties."

To solve the problems of complex parameter settings and low filtering accuracy in complicated urban environments, an automatic morphological filter was proposed. In this paper, the optimal maximum filtering window can be determined automatically by applying a series of morphological top-hat operations. Meanwhile, the thresholds for filtering were calculated adaptively according to the gradient changes. Seven publicly available data sets provided by the International Society for Photogrammetry and Remote Sensing were used to evaluate the performance. Experimental results show that the proposed method achieved an average total error of 4.07% and an average kappa coefficient of 90.90%, which are the best performances when compared to some other filtering methods.",External right-angle measurement using a two-autocollimator system.,https://www.ncbi.nlm.nih.gov/pubmed/30874167,Applied optics,2019 03 18,"We report on a non-contact method for external right-angle measurement using two autocollimators.

The values measured with our method are very coincident compared with the results measured by a ZYGO interferometer. The measuring accuracy is superior to 0.1 arcsec for the right-angle errors within 3.0 arcsec and becomes 0.4 arcsec for the extended right-angle errors within 8.0 arcsec.

In this paper, the optical absorption property of randomly rotated elliptical nanohole arrays consisting of 1×1, 2×2, and 4×4 cells has been investigated. It is found that the average ultimate efficiency of the arrays increases with the increase of the size of the supercell. The 4×4 array has the highest ultimate efficiency, and the efficiency of the 4×4 array is less sensitive to the parameters of the random rotation angle than that of the 1×1 and 2×2 arrays. The comparison of absorption spectra of the three arrays shows that the number of absorption peaks of the 1×1 array is the least, but the peak is the highest and narrowest, and that of the 4×4 array is the most, but the peak is the lowest and broadest. The spatial Fourier spectroscopy analysis of the array shows that the 4×4 arrays have the most Fourier spectrum components and the largest absorption mode density. The enhancement of optical absorption of the 4×4 array is attributed to the folding of energy bands, the increase of the energy density of states caused by large supercells, and the overcoupling between incident light and Bloch resonant modes in the structure. The improved stability of the ultimate efficiency of the 4×4 arrays is because the distribution of the energy density of states of the 4×4 arrays with different random parameters tends to be the same, which leads to almost the same absorption efficiency of the different 4×4 arrays.",Low-voltage-driven smart glass based on micro-patterned liquid crystal Fresnel lenses.,https://www.ncbi.nlm.nih.gov/pubmed/30874165,Applied optics,2019 03 18,"We disclose a method of fabricating a low-voltage-driven smart glass based on micro-patterned liquid crystal (LC) Fresnel lenses and implement three proof-of-concept prototypes. Distinct from the conventional LC-based smart windows with the scattering state, the prominence of our proposed LC smart glass in blurry state under both normal and oblique observations stems from the image distortion caused by LC Fresnel lenses. In addition, the high transmittance (>90%) in clear state is obtained by applying a low voltage of 2 V to each prototype.

The advantage of designing NL-PSAs based on their FTF is that one can reject many distorting harmonics of the fringes. We can also estimate the signal-to-noise ratio for interferograms corrupted by additive white Gaussian noise. Finally, for non-distorted noiseless fringes, the proposed NL-PSA retrieves the modulating phase error free, just as standard/linear PSAs do.",Simulation and observation for volume emission rates emitted from O2(0-1) and O(1S) nightglow in northwest China.,https://www.ncbi.nlm.nih.gov/pubmed/30874163,Applied optics,2019 03 18,"Being susceptible to the change of atmospheric conditions, the volume emission rate (VER) is very suitable to be used as a light source by passive remote sensing for measuring atmospheric wind and temperature.

Based on the Naval Research Laboratory Mass Spectrometer Incoherent Scatter (NRLMSISE-00) model data and the ground-based airglow imaging interferometer (GBAII) instrument observation for a local time and place, simulated VER profiles represented by four layers are obtained for the nightglow of O2(0-1) and O(S1).

Indium atoms were seeded into a modified Perkin-Elmer-burner and two tunable single-mode diode lasers with their wavelengths tuned to 410.17 and 451.12 nm were used to excite the seeded atoms. The fluorescence signal was collected using both a line-scan detector and a two-dimensional intensified CCD camera. One-dimensional flame temperature profiles were measured at different heights above a porous-plug burner, located at a distance of 1.5 m from the lidar system. The technique was also used to demonstrate two-dimensional temperature measurements in the same flame. The accuracy of the measured temperature was found to be limited mainly by uncertainty in the spectral overlap between the laser emission and the indium atom absorption spectrum as well as uncertainty in laser power measurements. With the constraint that indium can be introduced into the measurement volume, it is anticipated that the developed measurement concept could constitute a valuable tool, allowing in situ spatially resolved thermometry in intractable industrial applications, sufferings from limited optical access, thus requiring remote single-optical-port sensing.",Rapid quantitative protein detection by light transmission spectroscopy.,https://www.ncbi.nlm.nih.gov/pubmed/30874161,Applied optics,2019 03 18,"Rapid, sensitive, and quantitative protein detection is critical for many applications in medicine, environmental monitoring, and the food industry.

All spectroscopy measurements were performed in the absence and presence of transverse magnetic field of strength 0.9 tesla. When laser irradiance is increased by keeping the pressure (10 torr) and time delay constant (1.25 μs), both excitation temperature (Te) and number density (ne) increase up to certain values. The same trend is observed for Te and ne when the ambient gas pressure of Ar and Ne is increased by keeping the irradiance (1.7  GWcm-2) and time delay constant. At higher irradiances and pressures, saturation is observed, which is attributed to the self-regulating regime of plasma. In the case of time delay, both electron temperature and number density decay exponentially, which is according to the adiabatic expansion model. It is revealed that emission intensity and electron temperature are higher in the presence of magnetic field as compared to the field-free case, which is attributed to magnetic confinement, as well as the joule heating effect. Plasma plume confinement is confirmed by analytical evaluation factor β. β is an analytical factor that is the ratio of plasma pressure to magnetic pressure, i.e., β=Plasma pressureMagnetic pressure. It confirms the validity of magnetic field confinement if β is less than 1. As the evaluated values of β are less than 1 for all cases, they confirm the validity of magnetic confinement.",Time-varying tool influence function model of bonnet polishing for aspheric surfaces.,https://www.ncbi.nlm.nih.gov/pubmed/30874159,Applied optics,2019 03 18,"For bonnet polishing of an aspheric surface, the tool influence function (TIF) is inevitably time varying, induced by the different surface curvatures on the aspheric surface.

The time-varying TIF was modeled based on the finite element analysis and kinematics analysis methods, and validated by experiments. The experimental results exhibited good agreement with the theoretical results. The proposed method can forecast the TIF for different polishing positions on aspheric surfaces, and provide the theoretical foundation for dynamic compensation of aspheric surface polishing."

Specifically, a generic approach that can be easily applied to different laser systems is highly desired. In contrast to physical modeling approaches, we aim to predict beam-pointing drift using a well-established probabilistic learning approach, i.e., the Gaussian mixture model. By exploiting sampled datapoints (collected from the laser system) comprising time and corresponding shifting errors, the joint distribution of time and shifting error can be estimated. Subsequently, Gaussian mixture regression is employed to predict the shifting error at any query time.

LIBS tests were also carried out under argon (Ar) ambient gas in order to correlate with the same tests under air atmosphere. Experimental results indicate that line intensities of Pd were lower for all of the spent catalyst samples under the same conditions. The C2 swan bands are also greater in spent catalyst because of deactivation, which provides a lower amount of Pd in active sites of carbon. Furthermore, the intensity of Hα in spent catalyst is lower than fresh catalyst because of conversion of Pd(OH)2/C to Pd/C during deactivation.","High-efficiency, broadband, and wide-angle all-dielectric quarter wave plate based on anisotropic electric and magnetic dipole resonances.",https://www.ncbi.nlm.nih.gov/pubmed/30874121,Applied optics,2019 03 18,"Metadevices based on dielectric nanostructure with excitation of electric and magnetic resonances have shown high efficiency for polarization control compared with conventional manipulation methods, as well as plasmonic structure metadevices.

The intensity values and 3D geometry data from the fringe projection system are used to estimate material-specific reflection parameters for each 3D point and detect different material areas based on a global threshold.",Small footprint cholesteric liquid crystal laser.,https://www.ncbi.nlm.nih.gov/pubmed/30874119,Applied optics,2019 03 18,"We demonstrate a small optical bench footprint laser assembly based on the small pulsed Nd:YAG laser head SSY-1 for pumping cholesteric liquid crystal (CLC) lasers and illustrate its performance using low molecular weight CLC samples doped with the fluorescent dye PM597. A low lasing threshold, narrow laser line, and far-field interference patterns of the CLC laser were observed using the SSY-1-based laser assembly as the pump. The emission characteristics of the CLC laser are similar to those observed with comparable CLC materials pumped by an order of magnitude physically larger and many orders of magnitude more expensive commercial Nd:YAG laser systems.

It plays an important role in the manufacturing process of large flat mirrors. For calibrating the PPS's uncertainty, this paper describes a multi-mode scanning method to implement the measurement of low-order aberrations and introduces the concept of an autocorrelation coefficient to evaluate the data processing progress. These improvements were applied to the measurement of a large flat mirror (1630 mm in diameter), which demonstrates that the measuring uncertainty of PPS can be about 20 nm rms. Furthermore, in regard to the special requirements of M3MP, the prototype mirror of M3M (the tertiary mirror) in the Thirty Meter Telescope project with a non-circular aperture, we analyzed the slope distribution of low-order aberrations, power, and astigmatism. The sample route lines of PPS are then reorganized and a new data process algorithm is implemented. This work was performed in order to improve the PPS's performance in measuring low-order aberrations of large flat mirrors."

The interaction of surface plasmon resonance with a Fabry-Perot cavity resonance results in perfect absorption. The absorption efficiency is greater than 99.9% at wavelengths of 660 and 919 nm (visible and near-infrared), respectively, under normal incidence. In the ultraviolet region from 240 to 500 nm, absorption efficiency of over 90% can be achieved.

For both the separable and nonseparable cases, the spatial spectra or far-field impulses are 2D orthogonal lattices. We prove that for a 2D orthogonal separable structure, in addition to the DC impulse, there are other impulses on the coordinate axes. As a result, if all the spectrum impulses of a structure on the coordinate axes, except for the DC impulse, vanish, we conclude that the structure is nonseparable. In the second part of this work, using a unified formulation, the near-field diffraction of the 2D orthogonal separable and nonseparable periodic structures is investigated. In general, the Talbot distance equals the least common multiple of the individual Talbot distances in the orthogonal directions, say, z

Halfway between two adjacent RT distances, the formation of negative self-images with a complementary amplitude of the self-images is predicted. Halfway between two adjacent self-image and negative-elf-image, subimages are formed. As another interesting result, we show that the intensity patterns of the subimages are 2D multiplicatively separable with halved periods in both directions. Finally, we show that 2D almost periodic structures with impulses on zone-plate-like concentric circles have self-images under plane wave illumination.",Impact of sensor apodization on the tangential resolution in photoacoustic tomography.,https://www.ncbi.nlm.nih.gov/pubmed/30874102,"Journal of the Optical Society of America.

A Gaussian function was used to model axisymmetric apodization of sensors, and its full width at half-maximum (FWHM) was varied to investigate the role of apodization on the PAT image reconstruction. The well-known conventional delay-and-sum (CDAS) algorithm and recently developed modified delay-and-sum (MDAS) algorithm were implemented to generate reconstructed images. The performances of these algorithms were examined by comparing simulated images formed by these methods and that of ideal point detectors. Simulations in two dimensions were conducted using the k-Wave toolbox for three different phantoms. The results produced by the CDAS method are very close to that of ideal point detectors when the FWHM of the Gaussian function is small. The MDAS algorithm for flat sensors provides excellent results (comparable to that of point detectors) when the FWHM of the Gaussian profile is large.

Although polarization is now commonly used in linear imaging procedures (when unknowns are linked by a linear relationship to the measured signal), the influence of polarization choice is generally ignored in nonlinear imaging problems. In this paper, we propose a formulation to obtain the 3D permittivity map, by a nonlinear imaging procedure, from the scattering matrix. This allows one to select, from the same data set, the desired polarization case as input data for the imaging algorithm. We present a study of the influence of the input data polarization choice on the reconstructed permittivity map.

A, Optics, image science, and vision",2019 03 15,"When determining the parameters of a parametric planar shape based on a single low-resolution image, common estimation paradigms lead to inaccurate parameter estimates. The reason behind poor estimation results is that standard estimation frameworks fail to model the image formation process at a sufficiently detailed level of analysis. We propose a new method for estimating the parameters of a planar elliptic shape based on a single photon-limited, low-resolution image. Our technique incorporates the effects of several elements-point-spread function, discretization step, quantization step, and photon noise-into a single cohesive and manageable statistical model. While we concentrate on the particular task of estimating the parameters of elliptic shapes, our ideas and methods have a much broader scope and can be used to address the problem of estimating the parameters of an arbitrary parametrically representable planar shape. Comprehensive experimental results on simulated and real imagery demonstrate that our approach yields parameter estimates with unprecedented accuracy. Furthermore, our method supplies a parameter covariance matrix as a measure of uncertainty for the estimated parameters, as well as a planar confidence region as a means for visualizing parameter uncertainty.

It is observed that when initiated with a constant or a uniformly random phase map, the complexity of the Fienup solution containing stagnation artifacts stabilizes at a numerical value that is higher than ζ. We propose a modified Fienup algorithm that uses a controlled sparsity-enhancing step such that in every iteration the complexity of the resulting guess solution is explicitly made close to ζ. This approach, which we refer to as complexity-guided phase retrieval, is seen to provide an artifact-free phase retrieval solution within a few hundred iterations. Numerical illustrations are provided for both amplitude as well as phase objects with and without Poisson noise introduced in the Fourier intensity data. The complexity-guidance concept may potentially be combined with a variety of phase retrieval algorithms and can enable several practical applications.",Modeling the occlusion problem in thermal imaging to allow seeing through mist and foliage.,https://www.ncbi.nlm.nih.gov/pubmed/30874097,"Journal of the Optical Society of America.

Through setting the bias angle of the DEMZM at π/4 or 5π/4 and quadrature combining of the two channels of the IF signal, the combined IF signal down-converted from the target RF signal gets enhanced due to the in-phase sum of two channels, while the combined IF signal down-converted from the image frequency can be rejected due to out-of-phase sum of two channels.

The spatial resolution of the STED system has been discussed by analyzing the full width at half-maximum size of the fluorescence spots. It is found that, while probing in stratified media with discontinuous refractive indices, the spatial resolution of a STED microscope can be very sensitive to the existence of aberrations, e.g., coma and astigmatism, at different probing depths, as a result of mismatched axial positions of the excitation and depletion patterns. The spatial resolution of STED can be degraded up to 1.87- and 1.95-fold compared to that without aberrations. Therefore, a careful evaluation of the influence of aberration and discontinuous refractive indices should be taken into account when applying a STED microscope to realize super-resolution images."

We propose a random repeated and displaced phase, which reduces the speckle noise in the reconstructed image and spreads out the object information in a limited area. The phase is independent of the object, and it could be calculated by sections reducing the hologram computing time. We present simulated and experimental results that prove the improvement in quality of the reconstructed image and the whole object reconstruction, using only a small part of the hologram.",Pose error correction in offline three-dimensional profile measurement system for large-diameter aspheric mirror.,https://www.ncbi.nlm.nih.gov/pubmed/30874055,Applied optics,2019 03 15,"This paper proposes an offline measurement method for a large aspheric mirror during its grinding stage. A measurement method and mathematical model to realize a three-dimensional (3D) profile measurement for large-diameter aspheric mirrors are proposed, based on a cylindrical coordinate system. The measurement error induced by the alignment error is examined based on the error analysis of the measurement and workpiece coordinate systems. The corresponding pose error obtained through the nonlinear least squares method is eliminated to improve the measurement accuracy. To evaluate the entire surface profile error, a 3D profile model is established. The total uncertainties of the proposed measurement system are also estimated.

Digital holographic volume reconstruction conventionally uses multiple diffraction calculations to obtain sectional reconstructed images from an in-line hologram, followed by detection of the lateral and axial positions, and the sizes of particles by using focus metrics. However, the axial resolution is limited by the numerical aperture of the optical system, and the processes are time consuming. The method proposed here can simultaneously detect the lateral and axial positions, and the particle sizes via a DNN. We numerically investigated the performance of the DNN in terms of the errors in the detected positions and sizes. The calculation time is faster than conventional diffracted-based approaches."

The sideband spectrum reflecting the motion of the oscillator is observed in the power spectrum of the modulated wave. The time dependence of the intensity of the sideband spectrum is explained by Newton's second law assuming that the oscillator has a mechanical resonance frequency and undergoes simple vibration under the driving force, which depends on the deformation velocity of the piezoelectric element.

However, tomographic velocimetry usually suffers from high experimental costs, especially due to the formidable expenses of multiple high-speed cameras and the excitation laser source. To overcome this limitation, a cost-effective technique called endoscopic tomographic velocimetry has been developed in this work. As a single-camera system, nine projections of the target 3D luminous field at consecutive time instants can be registered from different orientations with one camera and customized fiber bundles, while this is possible only with the same number of cameras in a classical tomographic velocimetry system. Extensive numerical simulations were conducted with three inversion algorithms and two velocity calculation methods. According to RMS error analysis, it was found that the algebraic reconstruction technique outperformed the other two inversion algorithms, and the 3D optical flow method exhibited a better performance than cross correlation in terms of both accuracy and noise immunity. Proof-of-concept experiments were also performed to validate our developed system. The results suggested that an average reconstruction error of the artificially generated 3D velocity field was less than 6%, indicating good performance of the velocimetry system. Although this technique was demonstrated by reconstructing continuous luminous fields, it can be easily extended to discrete ones, which are typically adopted in particle image velocimetry.

In the proposed scheme, we first adopt the sparse camera array strategy to capture the sparse viewpoint images and use these images to synthesize the low-resolution elemental image array, then the convolution neural network super-resolution scheme is used to restore the high-resolution elemental image array from the low-resolution elemental image array for super-multiview integral image display.

In particular, we develop closed-form expressions for the field-estimated Strehl ratio and signal-to-noise ratio for three separate phase-shifting strategies-the four-, three-, and two-step methods. These closed-form expressions compare favorably with our detailed wave-optics simulations, which propagate a point-source beacon through deep-turbulence conditions, model digital holography with noise, and calculate the Monte Carlo averages associated with increasing turbulence strengths and decreasing focal-plane array sampling. Overall, the results show the four-step method is the most efficient phase-shifting strategy and deep-turbulence conditions only degrade performance with respect to insufficient focal-plane array sampling and low signal-to-noise ratios. The results also show the strong reference beam from the local oscillator provided by digital holography greatly improves performance by tens of decibels when compared with the self-referencing interferometer.",Single-shot 3D shape measurement of discontinuous objects based on a coaxial fringe projection system.,https://www.ncbi.nlm.nih.gov/pubmed/30873975,Applied optics,2019 03 18,"Fringe projection profilometry has been widely used in high-speed three-dimensional (3D) shape measurement. To improve the speed without loss of accuracy, we present a novel single-shot 3D shape measuring system that utilizes a coaxial fringe projection system and a 2CCD camera. The coaxial fringe projection system, comprising a visible light (red, green, and blue) projector and an infrared (IR) light projector, can simultaneously project red, green, blue, and IR fringe patterns. The 2CCD camera, as the name suggests, has two CCD chips that can acquire visible and IR fringe patterns at the same time. Combining the two-step phase-shifting algorithm, Fourier transform profilometry, and the optimum three-frequency selection method, 3D shape measurement of complex surfaces such as large slopes or discontinuous objects can be obtained from single-shot acquisition. A virtual fringe projection measurement system has been established to generate pre-deformed fringe patterns to correct positional deviations of the coaxial fringe projection system.

The norm approximation condition is satisfied, and the complex field of the object wave can be estimated by the normalization approach when the hologram satisfies the phase randomness condition.

Therefore, to avoid the risk of recurrence, accurate detection of the cancer margin by the clinician or surgeons needs some assistance. In this paper, an automated volumetric analysis of normal and breast cancer tissue is done by a machine learning algorithm to separate them into two classes. The proposed method is based on a support-vector-machine-based classifier by dissociating 10 features extracted from the A-line, texture, and phase map by the swept-source optical coherence tomographic intensity and phase images. A set of 88 freshly excised breast tissue [44 normal and 44 cancers (invasive ductal carcinoma tissues)] samples from 22 patients was used in our study. The algorithm successfully classifies the cancerous tissue with sensitivity, specificity, and accuracy of 91.56%, 93.86%, and 92.71% respectively. The present computational technique is fast, simple, and sensitive, and extracts features from the whole volume of the tissue, which does not require any special tissue preparation nor an expert to analyze the breast cancer as required in histopathology. Diagnosis of breast cancer by extracting quantitative features from optical coherence tomographic images could be a potentially powerful method for cancer detection and would be a valuable tool for a fine-needle-guided biopsy.",Characteristic and improvement on the reconstructed quality of effective perspective images' segmentation and mosaicking-based holographic stereogram.,https://www.ncbi.nlm.nih.gov/pubmed/30873969,Applied optics,2019 03 18,"Based on the effective perspective images' segmentation and mosaicking (EPISM) printing method, the influence of the holographic element (hogel) size on the reconstructed quality is analyzed to improve the reconstructed quality of holographic stereogram.

In this paper, the dynamic responses of metallic honeycomb-cored sandwich structures with bonded and debonded inserts are studied using time-averaged digital holography and illustrated. At high frequencies, the face sheet regions at perfectly bonded inserts act as hard points, and regions across a debonded insert locally resonate in the sensitivity range of interferometry. Since the discontinuities created by such inserts are very complex to simulate numerically, we simulate potted-insert sandwich structures through plates with multiple holes and with multiple fully and partially bonded local stiffeners to validate this fast inspection procedure. The simulated dynamic response of the plates is compared with the time-averaged digital holography results. The operational deflection shapes near stiffeners are similar to those of fully potted inserts in a sandwich panel. Thus, the extent of debond can be evaluated at high frequencies as simulated through partially bonded stiffeners.",Friend or Foe: A Cancer Suppressor MicroRNA-34 Potentially Plays an Adverse Role in Vascular Diseases by Regulating Cell Apoptosis and Extracellular Matrix Degradation.,https://www.ncbi.nlm.nih.gov/pubmed/30873956,Medical science monitor : international medical journal of experimental and clinical research,2019 04 12,"BACKGROUND MicroRNAs (miRNAs) have emerged as central regulators of many processes. MiRNA-34 (miR-34) functions as a well-known tumor suppressor. The aim of this study was to investigate the mechanisms underlying how miR-34 participates in vascular disorders. MATERIAL AND METHODS Three miR-34 family members (miR-34a, miR-34b, and miR-34c) were overexpressed or silenced in human vascular smooth muscle cells (VSMCs) and umbilical vein endothelial cells (UVECs), respectively, before the proliferation and apoptosis of cells were detected by using Cell Counting Kit-8 assay and Annexin V- fluorescein isothiocyanate/propidium iodide flow cytometry. The protein expression of apoptosis biomarkers was detected by western blot. Dual-luciferase reporter assay was performed to determine the candidate target of miR-34, and enzyme-linked immune sorbent assay was used to evaluate the effect of miR-34 on the expression of the target gene. RESULTS Overexpression of miR-34 family members repressed proliferation and promoted apoptosis of VSMCs and UVECs, whereas miR-34 knockdown led to the opposite results. In addition, miR-34a inhibited the expression of alpha-1 antitrypsin (AAT), a serine protease inhibitor that suppresses the degradation of extracellular matrix, through a miR-34-binding site within the 3'-UTR of AAT. CONCLUSIONS MiR-34 promoted apoptosis of VSMC and UVEC cells by inhibiting AAT expression. This finding provides an update on the understanding of the clinical value of miR-34, which might assist to uncover novel and effective therapeutic strategies for the treatment of vascular diseases.",Au-catalyzed desorption of GaAs oxides.,https://www.ncbi.nlm.nih.gov/pubmed/30873954,Nanotechnology,2019 03 21,"Thermal desorption of native oxides on GaAs(100), (110) and (111)B surfaces around Au particles are studied in vacuum using in situ microspectroscopy. Two temperature-dependent desorption regimes, common to all surfaces, are identified. The low-temperature desorption regime spatially limited to the vicinity of some Au nanoparticles (NPs) is catalytically enhanced, resulting in oxide pinholes which expand laterally into macro holes many times the size of the catalyzing NPs and with shapes dictated by the underlying crystallography. The high-temperature desorption regime causes homogeneous oxides thinning and, ultimately, complete oxide desorption. The temperature difference between the two regimes is ∼25 °C-60 °C. After oxide desorption and depending on Au size and GaAs surface orientation, Au particles may dissolve the fresh GaAs surface and form mobile AuGa2/Ga core/shell units, or form stationary AuGa2 crystallites, or the catalyzing Au particles may run with minimal reaction with the GaAs surface. These results will add to the fundamental understanding of many Au-based nanofabrication processes, particularly the epitaxial growth of vertical and lateral nanowires.",Tenofovir and emtricitabine resistance among antiretroviral-naive patients in the Canadian Observational Cohort Collaboration: implications for PrEP.,https://www.ncbi.nlm.nih.gov/pubmed/30873953,Antiviral therapy,2019 06 13,"The real-world effectiveness of pre-exposure prophylaxis (PrEP) may be influenced by circulating HIV strains resistant to either tenofovir or emtricitabine.

Nitric oxide (NO) has been implicated in the pathogenesis of autoimmune diseases. A deficiency in basal NO production by the constitutive endothelial isoform of nitric oxide synthase may promote vasoconstriction and vascular wall thickening. In January 2017, we searched the PubMed/Medline, Cochrane Library and Enbase/Medline databases for studies analysing physio-pathological correlations with lung fractional exhaled NO (FeNO) production. This review describes the rationale underlying possible applications of FeNO measurements in the management of SSc. Measuring NO levels at multiple expiratory flow rates makes it possible to distinguish airway NO production and distal airway/alveolar NO concentration (ANOC), and there is increasing evidence indicating that it may be useful in many non-respiratory conditions. FeNO levels are increased in SSc patients with fibrosing lung disease, whereas those with pulmonary hypertension have relatively low FeNO levels, thus suggesting that NO plays an important role in regulating pulmonary vascular resistance in SSc. However, a number of studies have shown increased ANOC in SSc patients without increased FeNO levels. The relationship between lung diffusing capacity for carbon monoxide and ANOC may be related to increased alveolar membrane thickness impeding NO diffusion or alveolar inflammation in SSc lung disease. The findings concerning the usefulness of FeNO measurements in SSc patients are discordant, but the available papers suggest that ANOC is a more accurate indicator of progressive lung dysfunction and an increase in ANOC could assess the extent of interstitial lung disease non-invasively.",Investigation of candidate gene copy number identifies FCGR3B as a potential biomarker for rheumatoid arthritis.,https://www.ncbi.nlm.nih.gov/pubmed/30873943,Clinical and experimental rheumatology,2019 03 15,"Copy number variants (CNVs) could explain a part of the missing heritability in rheumatoid arthritis (RA).

Part A, Toxic/hazardous substances & environmental engineering",2019 06 04,"Urban-waste bio-organic substances (UW-BOS) have been shown to be capable of extending the photo-Fenton reaction to mildly acidic conditions. In this study, the effects of pH (3-7), UW-BOS, H2O2 and iron concentrations on the photo-Fenton process were systematically assessed using a Doehlert experimental design and response surface methodology for two UW-BOS (CVT230 and FORSUD). Solutions of the model antibiotic sulfadiazine (SDZ) were irradiated in a solar simulator equipped with a 550 W Xenon lamp. The results showed that for UW-BOS contents below 30 mg L-1, SDZ removal proceeds at pH 5 with similar rates for both CVT230 and FORSUD, regardless of Fe(III) concentration. For 50 mg L-1 of UW-BOS or higher, CVT230 performs better than FORSUD, even for low Fe(III) content (1-3 mg L-1). In contrast, half-life times of 35-40 min can only be achieved under mildly acidic conditions with FORSUD for iron concentrations higher than 10 mg L-1. The better performance of CVT230 can be associated with its high hydrophilic/hydrophobic ratio, low E2:E3, higher iron content and possibly higher yields of triplet reactive species generation upon solar irradiation. The most appropriate conditions for each UW-BOS studied are discussed for the first time, which are advantageous for possible engineered applications.",Who Understands Consent? A Latent Profile Analysis of College Students' Attitudes Toward Consent.,https://www.ncbi.nlm.nih.gov/pubmed/30873896,Journal of interpersonal violence,2019 03 15,"Sexual assault occurs at high rates on college campuses today. This problem persists despite the many educational programs that seek to educate college students about sexual assault and consent. The current study used latent profile analysis on a survey of 717 college students at a Midwestern university to determine if different people have varying behavioral intentions about consent during four different sexual situations. Results show that there are four distinct profiles of intentions related to consent: the respecting explicit, affirmative, and ongoing consent profile (76.55% of the sample); only respecting explicit consent profile (9.89%); unsure about nonexplicit consent profile (9.04%); and the does-not-ask for verbal consent in relationships profile (4.55%). Regression analysis also revealed that males were more likely to be classified in the only respecting explicit consent profile compared with the three other profiles, but there were no significant differences among the other profiles.",Changes in Childhood Body-Mass Index and Risk of Venous Thromboembolism in Adulthood.,https://www.ncbi.nlm.nih.gov/pubmed/30873894,Journal of the American Heart Association,2019 04 26,"Background Childhood weight trajectories may influence cardiometabolic traits and thereby the risk of venous thromboembolism ( VTE ) later in life. We examined whether overweight and changes in weight status during childhood were associated with risk of VTE in adulthood. Methods and Results We used Danish medical registries to conduct a population-based cohort study of Danish schoolchildren aged 7 to 13 years and born during 1930-1989. We calculated body-mass index ( BMI ) z-scores based on weight and height measurements. We estimated hazard ratios using Cox regressions to examine associations between changes in BMI z-scores from 7 to 13 years of age and the subsequent risk of VTE . Among 313 998 children, 5007 girls and 5397 boys were diagnosed with VTE as adults. Compared with children with a normal BMI (25th to 75th percentile category) at both ages, children with a BMI persistently above the 75th percentile had a 1.30- to 1.50-fold increased risk of VTE in adulthood. Children who experienced a BMI increase from the 25th to 75th or >75th to 90th percentile to a higher percentile category had a 1.35- to 1.70-fold increased risk of adulthood VTE . Children whose BMI percentile category decreased between 7 and 13 years of age had a VTE risk similar to that of children with a persistently normal BMI . Conclusions Risk of VTE in adulthood was higher in children with a persistently above-average BMI . Whereas weight gain from 7 to 13 years of age additionally increased VTE risk, remission from overweight by 13 years of age completely reverted the risk.",Reliability of antioxidant potential and in vivo compatibility with extremophilic actinobacterial-mediated magnesium oxide nanoparticle synthesis.,https://www.ncbi.nlm.nih.gov/pubmed/30873893,"Artificial cells, nanomedicine, and biotechnology",2019 03 15,"Owing to the hazards of chemical and physical syntheses of magnesium oxide nanoparticles (MgO NPs), an eco-friendly, high-yield, and promising biological method is highly desirable for biomedical applications. Hence, in this study, an extremophilic actinobacterial population (SA8 and SA10) from Salem magnesite mining soil was used as precursors for MgO NP synthesis. The prepared nanoparticles were subjected to X-ray diffraction study and showed face-centred cubic structure with an average particle size of 18-24 nm. Among all, high yield was obtained in SA10 actinobacteria-mediated synthesis of MgO NPs (480 mg/100 mL). In addition, the prepared MgO NPs (10 mg/well) showed 15-17 mm zone of inhibition against bacterial pathogens, especially bigger zones around SA10. The 64.5% antioxidant activity and nonsignificant toxicity of actinobacteria-synthesized MgO NPs in MG-63 cell lines at 100 µg/mL and nonsignificant in vivo toxicity in zebrafish at 0.1 mg/mL were remarkable. In addition, this is the first study to focus on MgO NP synthesis using extremophilic actinobacteria collected from Salem magnesite mining soil for high yield (115 mg/100 mL), reliable with potential antioxidant, and in vitro and in vivo compatibility. These results provided useful information for advanced research and mass production of NP for biomedical applications.","Enhancing Older Adults' Sense of Belonging and Subjective Well-Being Through Sport Game Attendance, Team Identification, and Emotional Support.",https://www.ncbi.nlm.nih.gov/pubmed/30873892,Journal of aging and health,2019 03 15,"We investigate how (a) attendance at sport games and (b) identification with a sport team as fans (i.e., team identification) influence older adults' perceptions of emotional support, belonging, and subjective well-being (SWB).",The toxicology of chrysotile-containing brake debris: implications for mesothelioma.,https://www.ncbi.nlm.nih.gov/pubmed/30873891,Critical reviews in toxicology,2019 03 15,"The global use of ""asbestos"" in various commercial products has led to a wide range and pervasive legacy of disease. One such use of chrysotile asbestos was brake pads and was utilized commonly in automobiles and heavy vehicles. The result of incorporation of chrysotile into brake pads is associated with the exposure of mechanics fitting and servicing vehicles to liberated chrysotile fibers. Despite the proven exposure, the relative risk of malignant mesothelioma (MM) in this occupational population is broadly seen as low. The toxicity of particulates, including fibers such as chrysotile, is driven by a combination of dose and physicochemical properties. As such, it is plausible that chrysotile released from brake pads may have undergone modification, thereby altering the pathogenicity profile. The impact of high sheer stress causing shortening of long fibers, heat modification, binding of resin matrix to the fiber surface on the relative toxicity of brake debris with regards to MM is considered. It is apparent that released chrysotile can undergo significant modification, reducing the long fiber dose although not all modifications may lead to reduced toxicity.",Prediction of treatment outcome and relapse in inflammatory bowel disease.,https://www.ncbi.nlm.nih.gov/pubmed/30873890,Expert review of clinical immunology,2019 05 08,"Prediction of treatment outcome and clinical relapse in patients with inflammatory bowel disease (IBD), either ulcerative colitis (UC) or Crohn's disease (CD), is particularly important because therapeutics for IBD are not always effective and patients in remission could frequently relapse. Because undergoing endoscopy for the purpose is sometimes invasive and burdensome to patients, the performance of surrogate biomarkers has been investigated. Areas covered: We particularly featured the performance of patient symptoms, blood markers including C-reactive protein (CRP), fecal markers including fecal calprotectin (Fcal) and fecal immunochemical test (FIT) for prediction of endoscopic mucosal healing (MH) and prediction of relapse. Studies of other modalities and therapeutic drug monitoring (TDM) have also been explored. Expert opinion: Meticulous evaluation of patient symptoms could be predictive for MH in UC. CRP and Fcal may be accurate in prediction of MH of CD when MH is evaluated throughout the entire intestine including the small bowel. Repeated measurements of fecal markers including Fcal and FIT in patients with clinical remission would raise predictability of relapse. Prediction of treatment outcome by monitoring with blood markers including CRP, fecal markers including Fcal, and TDM has frequently been performed in recent clinical trials and shown to be effective.",Aquaporin-4 Expression Patterns in Glioblastoma Pre-Chemoradiation and at Time of Suspected Progression.,https://www.ncbi.nlm.nih.gov/pubmed/30873889,Cancer investigation,2019 03 29,"There has been controversy about the presence and potential role of aquaporin-4 (AQP4) in glioblastoma (GBM). We analyzed tissue from 22 patients with newly-diagnosed GBM as well as matching tissue from 17 of these cases who underwent repeat resection for suspected recurrence and performed immunohistochemical analysis for AQP-4 expression. While some degree of AQP4 expression was detected in all 22 cases (39 samples), there was no clear relationship between staining pattern and disease status (active versus inactive GBM) between baseline and time of repeat biopsy. In addition, there was no clear relationship between AQP4 expression and degree of edema."

In addition, little is known about the degree to which the EPAs are or are not aligned with physician assessors' performance schemas of the clerkship student. Investigating the degree to which physician assessors' performance schemas are already aligned with the activities described by the EPAs is critical for effective workplace assessment design. Approach: We sampled 1,032 areas of strength (strength) and areas for improvement (improvement) written evaluation comments by 423 physician assessors for clerkship students' performance in academic years 2014-15 and 2015-16 at the University of Utah School of Medicine. Two researchers independently categorized each comment by EPA and/or coded by non-EPA topic. The proportion of comment types was compared between strength comments and improvement comments with the Wilcoxon Signed-Rank Test. Findings: The most frequently mentioned EPAs in comments were about history gathering/physical exam, differential diagnosis, documentation, presentation, and interprofessional collaboration; few mentioned diagnostic tests, patient handovers, recognition of urgent patient care, and patient safety, and none mentioned orders/prescriptions and informed consent. The most frequent non-EPA topics were about medical knowledge, need to read more, learning attitude, work ethic, professionalism/maturity, and receptiveness to feedback. The proportion of comments aligned with an EPA only, a non-EPA topic only, or both an EPA and non-EPA topic was significantly different for clerkship students' strength compared to improvement. Insights: Physician assessors' performance schemas for clerkship students were aligned with EPAs to varying degrees depending on the specific EPA and whether describing strength or improvement. Of interest, the frequently mentioned non-EPA comments represented some of the competencies that contribute to effectively performing particular EPAs and are Accreditation Council for Graduate Medical Education (ACGME) core competencies (e.g., medical knowledge, professionalism), used in residency programs. Because physician assessors for undergraduate medical education often also participate in graduate medical education, the frequency of non-EPA topics aligned to ACGME competencies may suggest influence of graduate medical education evaluative frameworks on performance schemas for clerkship students; this could be important when considering implementation of EPAs in undergraduate medical education.",Nano-erythrocyte membrane-chaperoned 5-fluorouracil liposomes as biomimetic delivery platforms to target hepatocellular carcinoma cell lines.,https://www.ncbi.nlm.nih.gov/pubmed/30873877,"Artificial cells, nanomedicine, and biotechnology",2019 03 15,"Nano-erythrocyte coating has been developed as an interesting biomimetic platform to provide hybrid nano-carriers with innate functions to target liver cancer. This goal was achieved by coating nano-erythrocyte membranes (NEMs) onto 5-fluorouracil (5-FU)-loaded liposomes (LPs) to produce NEM-5-FU-LPs. This framework is used to promote the escape of 5-FU-LPs from degradation during systemic circulation. NEMs were obtained by hypotonic lysis of erythrocytes to produce ghost erythrocytes (GEs) followed by extrusion through polycarbonate membranes. Chimeric NEM-5-FU-LPs were fabricated via the fusion of NEMs and artificial LPs. The resultant chaperoned LPs were characterized based on particle size, morphology, entrapment efficiency (EE %), stability, protein content and phosphatidylserine exposure and their in vitro release profiles and cytotoxic efficacy were also determined. The present results revealed that 5-FU-LPs, NEM-5-FU and NEM-5-FU-LPs exhibited nanosize, spherical shapes and unimodal size distributions <0.3. In addition, the vesicles presented a zeta potential with EE% of 24.6-30.7% and an appropriate stability for 3 weeks. NEM-5-FU-LPs retained the erythrocyte membrane proteins as confirmed by PAGE and displayed a sustained release profile up to 48 h when compared to NEM-5-FU and the 5-FU solution. Moreover, hybrid NEM-5-FU-LPs induced a late cytotoxic effect after 48 h compared to the other formulations. Thus, mantling of 5-FU-LPs by NEMs could enhance vesicle controllability and their targetability to liver cancer cells.","A systematic review examining the association between female body image and the intention, initiation and duration of post-partum infant feeding methods (breastfeeding vs bottle-feeding).",https://www.ncbi.nlm.nih.gov/pubmed/30873876,Journal of health psychology,2019 03 15,"A systematic review was conducted to examine female body image in relation to the intention, initiation and duration of post-partum infant feeding methods. A search of 10 databases was conducted to identify studies. A total of nine studies were included in the systematic review. All studies were of a non-randomised control design with a total of 13,046 participants. Findings suggest that exclusive breastfeeding is more likely in pregnant women with a higher body image, while those with body concerns had less intention to breastfeed or initiate, with those who start having a shorter duration.",Development and characterization of a novel conductive polyaniline-g-polystyrene/Fe3O4 nanocomposite for the treatment of cancer.,https://www.ncbi.nlm.nih.gov/pubmed/30873875,"Artificial cells, nanomedicine, and biotechnology",2019 03 15,"The goal of this study is to synthesize, characterize and investigate some physicochemical properties of conductive polyaniline-g-polystyrene/Fe3O4 (Fe3O4/PSt-g-PANi) nanocomposites. For this purpose, initially, Fe3O4 nanoparticles were synthesized by a co-precipitation method. Then, the desired nanocomposite was synthesized in two steps. First, the atom transfer radical polymerization (ATRP) of styrene was performed using an ATRP initiator attached to the surface of Fe3O4 nanoparticles, followed by functionalization of the Fe3O4-PSt with amine groups (-NH2). Second, surface oxidative graft copolymerization of aniline was accomplished using the -NH2 moieties on the Fe3O4/PSt-NH2 as the anchoring sites. The prepared materials were characterized by various instruments, including TEM, SEM, TGA, EDX, FT-IR, XRD and conductivity measurements. The results indicated that the synthesized conductive polymer/Fe3O4 nanocomposites had higher electrical conductivity and thermal resistance than those of the corresponding homopolymers.","Fluorescence, turn-on detection of melamine based on its dual functions as fluorescence enhancer of DNA-AgNCs and Hg(II)-scavenger.",https://www.ncbi.nlm.nih.gov/pubmed/30873874,"Artificial cells, nanomedicine, and biotechnology",2019 03 15,"A new method has been developed for the simple, fluorescence, turn-on detection of melamine, which utilizes DNA-templated silver nanoclusters (DNA-AgNCs) as a key component. In the sensor, melamine exhibits the dual functions: one is to enhance the fluorescence signal of DNA-AgNCs by its specific interaction with thymine residues in DNA template, and the other is to prevent Hg(II)-induced fluorescence quenching of DNA-AgNCs via its strong coordination with Hg(II). These consequently enable the sensitive and selective detection of melamine. By exploiting such novel features of melamine, we significantly increased the fluorescence response up to 360%, compared to the previous counterpart that relies on DNA-AgNCs only, and successfully determined melamine down to ca. 49 nM, a value that is 400 times lower than the safety level of 20 μM set by the US Food and Drug Administration. In addition, it was confirmed that the proposed approach works fine even in the real milk samples without any additional pre-treatment steps.",Dietary Intake of Nutrients Involved in One-Carbon Metabolism and Risk of Gastric Cancer: A Prospective Study.,https://www.ncbi.nlm.nih.gov/pubmed/30873873,Nutrition and cancer,2019 04 25,"Dietary intakes of B vitamins and other components involved in one-carbon metabolism, which is necessary for DNA replication, DNA repair, and regulation of gene expression, may be associated with carcinogenesis. We investigated associations between intakes of 11 nutrients (thiamine, riboflavin, niacin, pantothenic acid, vitamin B6, biotin, folate, vitamin B12, methionine, choline, and betaine) and gastric cancer risk. A total of 159 incident gastric cancer cases were identified from the Melbourne Collaborative Cohort Study (N = 41,513) and matched with 159 controls on year of birth, sex, and country of birth using incidence density sampling. Dietary intakes of nutrients were estimated at baseline (1990-1994) using a 121-item food frequency questionnaire. Odds ratios (ORs) and 95% confidence intervals were estimated using conditional logistic regression models adjusting for Helicobacter pylori infection, and other potential confounders. We observed a positive association between intake of niacin and overall gastric cancer risk (OR = 1.33, 95%CI: 1.01-1.75 per SD increment). For thiamine, heterogeneity by subtype (cardia and non-cardia) was found (Phet = 0.05), with weak evidence of an inverse association with cardia cancer risk. Our results do not support increasing intakes of B vitamins or other nutrients involved in one-carbon metabolism to reduce gastric cancer risk in a well-nourished population.",Chitosan nanoparticles induced the antitumor effect in hepatocellular carcinoma cells by regulating ROS-mediated mitochondrial damage and endoplasmic reticulum stress.,https://www.ncbi.nlm.nih.gov/pubmed/30873872,"Artificial cells, nanomedicine, and biotechnology",2019 03 15,"In recent years, numerous studies have confirmed the role of chitosan nanoparticles (CS NPs) as a promising drug delivery carrier for improving the efficiency of anticancer drug in the treatment of cancer. However, the possible biological effects of CS NPs on tumour cells and underlying mechanisms are still unclear. Recently, reactive oxygen species (ROS)-mediated cell apoptosis has been implicated in the regulation of cell death. In this study, we found that CS NPs induced the massive generation of ROS and resulted in apoptosis of hepatocellular carcinoma cells (SMMC-7721) through activating the mitochondrial pathway and endoplasmic reticulum stress. These results suggest an important role of ROS in CS NPs-induced cancer cell death.",Shikonin induces apoptosis and prosurvival autophagy in human melanoma A375 cells via ROS-mediated ER stress and p38 pathways.,https://www.ncbi.nlm.nih.gov/pubmed/30873870,"Artificial cells, nanomedicine, and biotechnology",2019 03 15,"Shikonin, a botanical drug extracted from Lithospermum erythrorhizon, exhibits anti-cancer effects in various cancer cell lines. However, the mechanisms underlying these effects have not been completely elucidated yet. Here, we showed that Shikonin induces apoptosis and autophagy in A375 cells and inhibits their proliferation. Shikonin caused G2/M phase arrest through upregulation of p21 and downregulation of cyclin B1. Shikonin significantly triggered ER stress-mediated apoptosis by upregulating the expression of p-eIF2α, CHOP, and cleaved caspase-3. It also induced protective autophagy by activating the p38 pathway, followed by an increase in the levels of p-p38, LC3B-II, and Beclin 1. Upon suppression of autophagy by 3-methyladenine, Shikonin-induced apoptosis was enhanced in A375 cells. Moreover, after pretreatment with N-acetyl-cysteine, Shikonin increased the production of reactive oxygen species that are involved in regulating ER stress-mediated apoptosis and p38-activated autophagy, as evidenced by the reversion of cell viability and apoptosis and a decrease in p-eIF2α, CHOP, p-p38, LC3B-II, and Beclin 1 levels. Thus, we demonstrated that Shikonin induced apoptosis and autophagy in A375 cells via the activation of ROS-mediated ER stress and p38 pathways, indicating that Shikonin can serve as a potential agent for human melanoma therapy.","A novel circular RNA, hsa_circ_0043278, acts as a potential biomarker and promotes non-small cell lung cancer cell proliferation and migration by regulating miR-520f.",https://www.ncbi.nlm.nih.gov/pubmed/30873868,"Artificial cells, nanomedicine, and biotechnology",2019 03 15,"More and more circular RNAs (circRNAs) revealed to play a critical role in the initiation and progression of cancer, however, the effects of circRNAs on non-small cell lung cancer (NSCLC) remain largely undetermined.
