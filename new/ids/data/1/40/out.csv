Among others, dietary effects like (a lack of) essential amino acids (AA) as lipotrophic factors (e.g., methionine) have been considered as potentially predispositing for HL. Several studies have reported abnormal AA profiles in hepatic diseases of humans and other livestock. The ratio of branched-chain amino acids (BCAA) to aromatic amino acids (AAA) in plasma is used to predict hepatic cirrhosis. In this study, the state of supply of AA was investigated by comparing non-affected (NA) animals and those affected by HL. The AA pattern in the liver and blood can provide potential indications of pathogenesis of HL. In cooperation with German poultry veterinarians, 3 cases of HL on 3 different fattening turkey farms were visited (13/14 wk old, ""B.U.T. Big 6"" and ""TP7""). Overall, 73 birds were examined, of which 42 birds suffered from HL and 31 were not affected. Feeding samples of the respective actual feed were taken and analyzed. The selection of animals was carried out (NA randomly) by clinical signs such as apathy and dyspnea and the diagnosis was made at necropsy, which could be confirmed by crude fat content in liver tissue (HL: 309, NA: 155). In liver tissue, the CP and AA contents were lower among animals with HL than among NA (P < 0.05). In blood samples, the sum of AA, ammonia, and urea was more than 3 times higher among animals with HL (431 mg/dL serum) than among NA (114 mg/dL serum; P < 0.01). The ratio of BCAA to AAA was also significantly different between the groups (HL: 0.85, NA: 1.42; P < 0.05). In the case of HL, entire herds were not affected and the ""non-affected"" ones were comparable with healthy slaughtered animals. There seems to be a clear change in protein and AA metabolism of HL animals, which could lead to an optimization in feeding practice in repeated cases of HL.",miR-145 improves metabolic inflammatory disease through multiple pathways.,https://www.ncbi.nlm.nih.gov/pubmed/30941422,Journal of molecular cell biology,2019 04 03,"Chronic inflammation plays a pivotal role in insulin resistance and type 2 diabetes, yet the mechanisms are not completely understood. Here, we demonstrated that serum LPS levels were significantly higher in newly diagnosed diabetic patients than in normal control. miR-145 level in peripheral blood mononuclear cells decreased in type 2 diabetics. LPS repressed the transcription of miR-143/145 cluster and decreased miR-145 levels. Attenuation of miR-145 activity by anti-miR-145 triggered liver inflammation and increased serum chemokines in C57BL/6 J mice. Conversely, lentivirus-mediated miR-145 overexpression inhibited macrophage infiltration, reduced body weight, and improved glucose metabolism in db/db mice. And miR-145 overexpression markedly reduced plaque size in the aorta in ApoE-/- mice. Both OPG and KLF5 were targets of miR-145. miR-145 repressed cell proliferation and induced apoptosis partially by targeting OPG and KLF5. miR-145 also suppressed NF-kB activation by targeting OPG and KLF5. Our findings provide an association of the environment with the progress of metabolic disorders. Increasing miR-145 may be a new potential therapeutic strategy in preventing and treating metabolic diseases such as type 2 diabetes and atherosclerosis.",Suitability of layer-type male chicks for capon production.,https://www.ncbi.nlm.nih.gov/pubmed/30941421,Poultry science,2019 04 03,"The aim of this study was to determine the effect of age and caponization on the growth performance and carcass quality characteristics of Leghorn cockerels. The experiment was conducted on 224 Leghorn cockerels. At 8 wk of age, 112 birds were surgically castrated by a qualified veterinarian in accordance with Commission Regulation (EC) No. 543/2008. The birds were divided into 2 sex categories (with 8 replications per group and 14 birds per replication). The birds were raised to 28 wk of age, and were fed commercial diets ad libitum. From 12 wk of age, at 4-wk intervals, 8 intact cockerels and 8 capons (1 bird per replication) were selected randomly and slaughtered. Caponization had a beneficial influence on the feed conversion ratio (FCR). FCR (kg/kg) based on body weight (BW) gain, carcass weight gain, and edible weight gain was lower in capons from 24 wk of age (P < 0.05), and FCR based on lean weight gain was lower in capons from 21 wk of age (P < 0.05). The content of edible components expressed as a percentage of the total BW of cockerels and capons was similar in the corresponding age groups. Caponization had no effect on the total lean meat content of the carcass (P = 0.744), but differences were found between the weights of breast muscles and leg muscles. In week 24 and 28, the weight of breast muscles was higher in capons than in cockerels (P < 0.05). Cockerels had higher leg muscle weight than capons, and significant differences were noted in week 16 and in 28 (P < 0.05).","Effect of vitamin E sources and inclusion levels in diets on growth performance, meat quality, alpha-tocopherol retention, and intestinal inflammatory cytokine expression in broiler chickens.",https://www.ncbi.nlm.nih.gov/pubmed/30941420,Poultry science,2019 04 03,"Water-miscible vitamin E (WVE) has been known to be more bioavailable than conventional lipid-soluble vitamin E (LVE) in human foods because of its greater solubility in the gastrointestinal tract. However, no data regarding the comparison of the efficacy of WVE to LVE were available in poultry diets. The objective of the current experiment was to investigate the effect of vitamin E (VE) sources and inclusion levels in diets on growth performance, meat quality, alpha-tocopherol retention, and intestinal inflammatory cytokine expression in broiler chickens. A total of 420 6-d-old broiler chicks were allotted to 1 of 7 dietary treatments with 6 replicates in a completely randomized design. The corn-soybean meal-based basal diet was formulated without inclusion of supplemental VE. Additional 6 diets were prepared by supplementing the basal diet with either WVE or LVE at the inclusion levels of 33, 65, or 100 IU/kg in diets. Diets were fed to birds for 26 d. Results indicated that different VE sources and inclusion levels from 33 to 100 IU/kg in diets had no effects on growth performance in broilers. The VE sources did not affect lipid oxidation in both breast and thigh meat. However, increasing inclusion levels of VE decreased (linear and quadratic, P < 0.05) lipid oxidation in breast meat. Regardless of VE sources, increasing inclusion levels of VE increased (linear, P < 0.01) alpha-tocopherol concentrations in breast meat. Dietary WVE showed a greater reduction in the expression of both pro- and anti-inflammatory cytokine genes in the jejunum than dietary LVE. Increasing inclusion levels of both VE sources decreased (linear and quadratic, P < 0.05) the expression of both pro- and anti-inflammatory cytokine genes in the jejunum. The efficacy of dietary WVE for growth performance, meat quality, lipid oxidation, and alpha-tocopherol retention in broilers chickens is similar to that of dietary LVE. However, it is likely that dietary WVE is more effective in decreasing intestinal inflammatory responses than dietary LVE in broilers.",Antagonism between BRCA2 and FIGL1 regulates homologous recombination.,https://www.ncbi.nlm.nih.gov/pubmed/30941419,Nucleic acids research,2019 06 14,"Homologous recombination (HR) maintains genome stability by promoting accurate DNA repair. Two recombinases, RAD51 and DMC1, are central to HR repair and form dynamic nucleoprotein filaments in vivo under tight regulation. However, the interplay between positive and negative regulators to control the dynamic assembly/disassembly of RAD51/DMC1 filaments in multicellular eukaryotes remains poorly characterized. Here, we report an antagonism between BRCA2, a well-studied positive mediator of RAD51/DMC1, and FIDGETIN-LIKE-1 (FIGL1), which we previously proposed as a negative regulator of RAD51/DMC1. Through forward genetic screen, we identified a mutation in one of the two Arabidopsis BRCA2 paralogs that suppresses the meiotic phenotypes of figl1. Consistent with the antagonistic roles of BRCA2 and FIGL1, the figl1 mutation in the brca2 background restores RAD51/DMC1 focus formation and homologous chromosome interaction at meiosis, and RAD51 focus formation in somatic cells. This study shows that BRCA2 and FIGL1 have antagonistic effects on the dynamics of RAD51/DMC1-dependent DNA transactions to promote accurate HR repair.",Comparison of whole embryonic development in the duck (Anas platyrhynchos) and goose (Anser cygnoides) with the chicken (Gallus gallus).,https://www.ncbi.nlm.nih.gov/pubmed/30941418,Poultry science,2019 04 03,"Embryos from aquatic birds are the primary models for the study of flipper development. While some staging of early embryogenesis in duck have been studied, characterization of the stages of the entire embryonic development period in water birds has not been described. This study aimed to establish a comparison of complete morphological development staging for ducks (Anas platyrhynchos) and geese (Anser cygnoides) with the embryonic staging system by Hamburger and Hamilton (HH) for the chicken (Gallus gallus). Our results show that morphological development in the chicken, duck, and goose are similar in the early stages. The major differences occurred after stage 27 of embryonic development, where the beak shape in ducks and geese was wider and longer than in chickens. In addition, the second and third interdigital webs of the hind limb of the chicken were found to be degraded from stage 31, and eventually vanished at stage 35; however, they were retained in ducks and geese. Rapid physical development occurred in the mid-to-late stages in ducks and geese. To our best knowledge, this is the first description of complete embryonic development for the duck and goose. Establishment of an embryonic staging system for duck and goose provides new models for the study of waterfowl development.",miR-122 and Ago interactions with the HCV genome alter the structure of the viral 5' terminus.,https://www.ncbi.nlm.nih.gov/pubmed/30941417,Nucleic acids research,2019 06 14,"Hepatitis C virus (HCV) is a positive-sense RNA virus that interacts with the liver-specific microRNA, miR-122. miR-122 binds to two sites in the 5' untranslated region (UTR) and this interaction promotes HCV RNA accumulation, although the precise role of miR-122 in the HCV life cycle remains unclear. Using biophysical analyses and Selective 2' Hydroxyl Acylation analyzed by Primer Extension (SHAPE) we investigated miR-122 interactions with the 5' UTR. Our data suggests that miR-122 binding results in alteration of nucleotides 1-117 to suppress an alternative secondary structure and promote functional internal ribosomal entry site (IRES) formation. Furthermore, we demonstrate that two hAgo2:miR-122 complexes are able to bind to the HCV 5' terminus simultaneously and SHAPE analyses revealed further alterations to the structure of the 5' UTR to accommodate these complexes. Finally, we present a computational model of the hAgo2:miR-122:HCV RNA complex at the 5' terminus of the viral genome as well as hAgo2:miR-122 interactions with the IRES-40S complex that suggest hAgo2 is likely to form additional interactions with SLII which may further stabilize the HCV IRES. Taken together, our results support a model whereby hAgo2:miR-122 complexes alter the structure of the viral 5' terminus and promote formation of the HCV IRES.",Quality and oxidative stability of eggs laid by hens fed marigold extract supplemented diet.,https://www.ncbi.nlm.nih.gov/pubmed/30941416,Poultry science,2019 04 03,"The research objective was to determine the influence of marigold extract and storage duration on the indicators of egg quality and on the oxidative stability of eggs. The 5-wk long research was carried out on 300 laying hens. Laying hens were divided into control group (C-without marigold extract supplementation) and 2 experimental groups (E1-supplemented 1 g/kg of marigold extract and E2-supplemented 2 g/kg of marigold extract to diet). The eggs were analyzed on 2 occasions, as fresh eggs (1 D after collecting in the facility) and after 28 D of storage in a refrigerator on +4°C. On both occasions, there were 30 eggs analyzed per each group. Statistical analysis of the research results proved influence of marigold extract supplementation and storage duration on the weight of eggs (P < 0.05) and on the eggshell thickness (P < 0.001), but they did not have any influence on other indicators of external egg quality. Storage duration affected (P < 0.001) all indicators of internal egg quality, whereas supplementation of marigold extract influenced (P < 0.001) only the pH value of yolk. Supplementation of marigold extract influenced (P < 0.001) the yolk color intensity. There was a significant increase in the value of yolk color, starting with 9.63 in the C group and raising to 12.77 (E1) and 13.50 (E2) in fresh eggs. Yolk color of stored eggs was more intensive than the yolk color of fresh eggs in all 3 groups (P < 0.001). Supplemented marigold extract did not influence the obtained results of lipid oxidation in yolks, whereas storage duration had influence (P < 0.05) on oxidation intensity. The most favorable value of oxidation in fresh eggs was determined in the E2 group (0.545 μg MDA/g), and in stored eggs in the E1 group (0.615 μg MDA/g). Based on the research results, it was concluded that the supplementation of marigold extract had favorable influence on the yolk color intensity and on the oxidative stability of eggs without having negative influence on other egg quality indicators.",The Prevalence of Faculty Physician Burnout in Military Graduate Medical Education Training Programs: A Cross-Sectional Study of Academic Physicians in the United States Department of Defense.,https://www.ncbi.nlm.nih.gov/pubmed/30941415,Military medicine,2019 04 03,"In military populations, physician burnout has potential to adversely affect medical readiness to deploy in support of joint operations.

Series A, Biological sciences and medical sciences",2019 04 03,"The effect of flavonoid-rich food, such as blueberries, on cognitive function has been subject to a growing amount of research interest in recent years. Epidemiological, prospective, pre-clinical and clinical trials have revealed positive cognitive benefits from flavonoid interventions, particularly in relation to the amelioration of cognitive decline in older adults. This review will specifically consider the existing clinical research from both acute and chronic blueberry interventions on cognition in human subjects. The results of 11 studies are reported with four studies considering blueberry intervention with 7 - 10 yr old children, four considering aging 60+ yr old adults, and three considering adults suffering from mild cognitive impairment (MCI). Findings from these studies indicate that cognitive benefits may be found for delayed memory and executive function in children and for delayed memory, executive function, and psychomotor function in older healthy and MCI adults. There is less evidence to suggest positive benefits of blueberry intervention on working memory. Recommendations for future research including dose used, cognitive tasks, and age groups considered, are proposed.",The Attentional Blink is Related to the Microsaccade Rate Signature.,https://www.ncbi.nlm.nih.gov/pubmed/30941400,"Cerebral cortex (New York, N.Y. : 1991)",2019 04 03,"The reduced detectability of a target T2 following discrimination of a preceding target T1 in the attentional blink (AB) paradigm is classically interpreted as a consequence of reduced attention to T2 due to attentional allocation to T1. Here, we investigated whether AB was related to changes in microsaccade rate (MSR). We found a pronounced MSR signature following T1 onset, characterized by MSR suppression from 200 to 328 ms and enhancement from 380 to 568 ms. Across participants, the magnitude of the MSR suppression correlated with the AB effect such that low T2 detectability corresponded to reduced MSR. However, in the same task, T1 error trials coincided with the presence of microsaccades. We discuss this apparent paradox in terms of known neurophysiological correlates of MS whereby cortical excitability is suppressed both during the microsaccade and MSR suppression, in accordance to poor T1 performance with microsaccade occurrence and poor T2 performance with microsaccade absence. Our data suggest a novel low-level mechanism contributing to AB characterized by reduced MSR, thought to cause suppressed visual cortex excitability. This opens the question of whether attention mediates T2 performance suppression independently from MSR, and if not, how attention interacts with MSR to produce the T2 performance suppression.",Weighing the options for delivery care in rural Malawi: community perceptions of a policy promoting exclusive skilled birth attendance and banning traditional birth attendants.,https://www.ncbi.nlm.nih.gov/pubmed/30941399,Health policy and planning,2019 05 21,"To address its persistently high maternal mortality, the Malawi government has prioritized strategies promoting skilled birth attendance and institutional delivery. However, in a country where 80% of the population resides in rural areas, the barriers to institutional deliveries are considerable. As a response, Malawi issued Community Guidelines in 2007 that both promoted skilled birth attendance and banned the utilization of traditional birth attendants for routine deliveries. This grounded theory study used interviews and focus groups to explore community actors' perceptions regarding the implementation of this policy and the related affects that arose from its implementation. The results revealed the complexity of decision-making and delivery care-seeking behaviours in rural areas of Malawi in the context of this policy. Although women and other actors seemed to agree that institutional deliveries were safer when complications occurred, this did not necessarily ensure their compliance. Furthermore, implementation of the 2007 Community Policy aggravated some of the barriers women already faced. This innovative bottom-up analysis of policy implementation showed that the policy had further ruptured linkages between community and health facilities, which were ultimately detrimental to the continuum of care. This study helps fill an important gap in research concerning maternal health policy implementation in Low and middle income countries (LMICs), by focusing on the perceptions of those at the receiving end of policy change. It highlights the need for globally promoted policies and strategies to take better account of local realities.",Determinants of transmission risk during the late stage of the West African Ebola epidemic.,https://www.ncbi.nlm.nih.gov/pubmed/30941398,American journal of epidemiology,2019 04 03,"Understanding risk factors for Ebola transmission is key for effective prediction and design of interventions. We used data on 860 cases in 129 chains of transmission from the latter half of the 2013-16 Ebola outbreak in Guinea. Using negative binomial regression, we determined characteristics associated with the number of secondary cases resulting from each infected individual. We found that attending an Ebola Treatment Unit was associated with a 38% decrease in secondary cases (Incident rate ratio (IRR) 0.62, 95%CI: 0.38, 0.99) in individuals that did not survive. Unsafe burial was associated with a higher number of secondary cases (IRR 1.82, 95%CI: 1.10, 3.02). The average number of secondary cases was higher for the first generation of a transmission chain (mean = 1.77), compared with subsequent generations (mean = 0.70). Children were least likely to transmit (IRR 0.35 (95%CI: 0.21, 0.57) compared with adults, whereas older adults were associated with higher numbers of secondary cases. Men were less likely to transmit than women (IRR 0.71 (95%CI: 0.55, 0.93)). This detailed surveillance dataset provided an invaluable insight into transmission routes and risks. Our analysis highlights the key role that age, receiving treatment, and safe burial played in the spread of EVD.",Female obesity is negatively associated with live birth rate following IVF: a systematic review and meta-analysis.,https://www.ncbi.nlm.nih.gov/pubmed/30941397,Human reproduction update,2019 04 03,"A worldwide increase in the prevalence of obesity has been observed in the past three decades, particularly in women of reproductive age. Female obesity has been clearly associated with impaired spontaneous fertility, as well as adverse pregnancy outcomes. Increasing evidence in the literature shows that obesity also contributes to adverse clinical outcomes following in vitro fertilization (IVF) procedures. However, the heterogeneity of the available studies in terms of populations, group definition and outcomes prevents drawing firm conclusions. A previous meta-analysis published in 2011 identified a marginal but significant negative effect of increased female body mass index (BMI) on IVF results, but numerous studies have been published since then, including large cohort studies from national registries, highlighting the need for an updated review and meta-analysis.","A New HPLC-DAD Method for the Concurrent Determination of Hydroquinone, Hydrocortisone Acetate and Tretinoin in Different Pharmaceuticals for Melasma Treatment.",https://www.ncbi.nlm.nih.gov/pubmed/30941396,Journal of chromatographic science,2019 04 03,"A new simple and robust HPLC-DAD method was developed for the concurrent analysis of hydroquinone (HQ), hydrocortisone acetate (HCA) and tretinoin (TRN) triple combination for the first time using an Inertsil ODS 3-C18 column (150 mm × 4.6 mm, 5 μm particle size) column with 0.05 M phosphate buffer (pH 5.0) and acetonitrile at a ratio of (10:90, v/v) as a mobile phase, eluted by an isocratic elution mode at a flow rate of 1.0 mL/min and detected at 265 nm.

Aldehydes are effective disinfectants commonly used in sericulture. However, the precise mechanism of their action on Nb spores remains unclear. Here, we used laser tweezers Raman spectroscopy to investigate the effects of glutaraldehyde and formaldehyde on individual Nb spores, as well as phase contrast microscopy imaging to monitor the germination dynamics of individual treated spores, to acquire a deeper understanding of the mechanism of action of aldehydes and to provide a theoretical reference for establishing an effective strategy for disease control in sericulture. The positions of the Raman peaks remained constant during treatment. The Raman intensity was enhanced and the germination rate of the spores significantly decreased with treatment time. Tlag, the time when individual spores begin to germinate, and Tgerm, the time for complete germination, increased with enhanced treatment. The germination time (ΔTgerm) showed no significant difference from that for untreated spores. Heterogeneity was shown, which is relevant to the resistance of Nb spores to aldehydes. The results indicate that glutaraldehyde and formaldehyde do not destroy the spore wall and plasma membrane, do not cause the leakage of intracellular components, and might not damage the extrusion apparatus. The effects of aldehydes on Nb spores are mainly on the spore coat. They may block the external factors that stimulate spore germination. Single-cell analysis based on novel optical techniques reveals the action of chemical sporicides on microsporidia spores in real time and explains the heterogeneity of cell stress resistance. These applications of new techniques offer new insight into traditional disinfectants.",Multi-layer-stacked Co9S8 micro/nanostructure directly anchoring on carbon cloth as a flexible electrode in supercapacitors.,https://www.ncbi.nlm.nih.gov/pubmed/30941382,Nanoscale,2019 04 11,"Rational design and synthesis of electrode materials containing uniformly stacked lamella structures with high surface areas are attractive for efficient storage of electrochemical energy. In this work, Co9S8 clusters with a uniformly stacked lamella structure was directly anchored onto carbon cloth (CC) by an easy-to-implement chemical solution processing method, which involves the homogeneous growth of the CoCO3 precursor, promoting the formation of nanosheets during the subsequent sulfurization process. Due to the conductive substrate (CC) and special multi-layer micro/nanostructure (Co9S8), the flexible Co9S8/CC electrode, which can be tailored, bent and twisted arbitrarily without affecting its electrochemical properties, also exhibits excellent electrochemical properties with a high specific capacitance (1475.4 F g-1 at 1 A g-1), a good rate capacity (80.2% retention at 20 A g-1) and excellent cycling stability (92.9% retention over 5000 cycles). In addition, the assembled solid-state asymmetric supercapacitor device containing the fabricated Co9S8 as the positive electrode and activated carbon as the negative electrode, also exhibits a high energy density of 20.3 W h kg-1 at a power density of 22 796.1 W kg-1 and a high energy density of 33.2 W h kg-1 at a power density of 817.9 W kg-1. Because of its good electrochemical properties and flexibility, the flexible Co9S8/CC electrode material is very promising to be used in flexible supercapacitors and wearable electronic technology.",Mild and regioselective azol-halogenation of alkenes.,https://www.ncbi.nlm.nih.gov/pubmed/30941381,Organic & biomolecular chemistry,2019 04 26,"An economical and practical azol-halogenation protocol of alkenes, which provides a general approach to construct a series of structurally diverse β-halogenated amine derivatives, is reported. The wide substrate scope, good functional group tolerance, ease of large-scale preparation and potential for product derivatization make this reaction attractive. Mechanistic studies suggest that the azol-halogenation process might involve a radical halogenation followed by nucleophilic azolyation.",Hydrophobicity may enhance membrane affinity and anti-cancer effects of Schiff base vanadium(v) catecholate complexes.,https://www.ncbi.nlm.nih.gov/pubmed/30941380,"Dalton transactions (Cambridge, England : 2003)",2019 05 17,"Anti-cancer activities of vanadium compounds have generated recent interest because of a combination of desirable properties for chemotherapy, i.e., strong cytotoxicities, anti-metastatic activities and relatively low systemic toxicities. Certain hydrophobic vanadium(v) Schiff base/catecholate compounds, which as shown herein, have increased stability in aqueous media and affinity for membrane interfaces. Depending on their hydrophobicity, they may be able to enter cells intact. In this manuscript, two hydrophobic V(v) catecholate substituted analogues, [VO(Hshed)(cat)] and [VO(Hshed)(dtb)], (Hshed = N-(salicylideneaminato)-N'-(2-hydroxyethyl)-1,2-ethanediamine, cat = pyrocatechol, and dtb = 3,5-di(tert-butyl)catechol and the vanadium(v) precursor [V(O)2(Hshed)]) were synthesized for their ability to interact with membranes and their anti-cancer effects. Using 51V and 1H NMR spectroscopy, the presence and location of the free ligand, H2shed, and the three V(v) complexes were examined in a model membrane microemulsion system. The stability of the three complexes was measured in aqueous solution, cell media and an inhomogeneous microemulsion system. Our results demonstrated that free ligand H2shed and the intact V(v) complexes associated with the interface but that the V-complexes hydrolyzed to some extent because oxovanadates were observed by 51V NMR spectroscopy and decreasing complex by absorption spectroscopy in cell media. When determining the effects of V(v) catecholate complexes on bone cancer cells, the strongest effects were observed with the more stable hydrophobic complex [VO(Hshed)(dtb)] that was able to best associate and penetrate the model membrane system intact. These studies are consistent with the membrane permeability studies being a good predictor for in vitro cytotoxicity assays because [VO(Hshed)(dtb)] can pass through the cellular membrane intact, which may enhance its anti-cancer activities.",Cooperative Mn(i)-complex catalyzed transfer hydrogenation of ketones and imines.,https://www.ncbi.nlm.nih.gov/pubmed/30941379,"Dalton transactions (Cambridge, England : 2003)",2019 05 28,"The synthesis and reactivity of Mn(i) complexes bearing bifunctional ligands comprising both the amine N-H and benzimidazole fragments are reported. Among the various ligands, the N-((1H-benzimidazol-2-yl)methyl)aniline ligand containing Mn(i) complex presented higher reactivity in the transfer hydrogenation (TH) of ketones in 2-propanol. Experimentally, it was established that both the benzimidazole and amine N-H proton played a vital role in the enhancement of the catalytic activity. Utilizing this system a wide range of aldehydes and ketones were reduced efficiently. Notably, the TH of several imines, as well as chemoselective reduction of unsaturated ketones, was achieved in the presence of this catalyst. DFT calculations were carried out to understand the plausible reaction mechanism which disclosed that the transfer hydrogenation reaction followed a concerted outer-sphere mechanism.",A Mn(iv)-peroxo complex in the reactions with proton donors.,https://www.ncbi.nlm.nih.gov/pubmed/30941378,"Dalton transactions (Cambridge, England : 2003)",2019 04 19,"Protons play an important role in promoting O-O or M-O bond cleavage of metal-peroxo complexes.

Isotope labelling experiments demonstrate that the oxygen atom in the phosphine oxide product derives from the peroxo ligand of 1. Reactions of 1 with weak proton donors, such as phenylthiol, phenol, substituted phenol and methanol, are also investigated to explore the reactivity of the MnIV-peroxo complex, leading to the isolation of a series of five-coordinate [MnIII(L)(TMSPS3)]- complexes (L = phenylthiolate, phenolate or methoxide).

In contrast, a host-guest complex obtained through homogeneous encapsulation conditions by using soluble ruthenium(ii) polypyridyl complex salts showed broadened emission spectra which strongly depended on the amount of the host owing to the encapsulation equilibrium. These results demonstrate that a simple modulation of the encapsulation technique is indeed promising and a facile approach to control the photophysical properties of supramolecular complexes.",Tuberculosis Caused by Mycobacterium bovis in a Sheep Flock Colocated with a Tuberculous Dairy Cattle Herd in Central Ethiopia.,https://www.ncbi.nlm.nih.gov/pubmed/30941376,Journal of veterinary medicine,2019 04 06,"Mycobacterium bovis (M. bovis) has an exceptionally wide host range including sheep. Information on tuberculosis (TB) in sheep is scarce, and there appears to be conflicting opinions about the relative susceptibility of sheep to infection. In Ethiopia, there was no single previous report on tuberculosis in sheep, though mixed farming of cattle and sheep is a common practice. In this study, following the observation of TB-like lesions on sheep died from sheep flock kept in contact with cattle herd, further investigation was conducted on the flock to assess the magnitude of the infection and identify and characterize the causative M. bovis strain. An outbreak investigation was carried out on 26 eligible sheep out of 33 sheep found on the farm. Comparative intradermal tuberculin (CIDT) test, postmortem examination, Mycobacterium culturing, and spoligotyping were the techniques used in the study. The prevalence of TB in the tested sheep was 15% (4/26). All the sheep that were positive to CIDT had gross lesions suggestive of TB. Three of the positive sheep had extensive and multiple lesions. M. bovis was isolated from all four sheep and the strain was identified as spoligotype SBO134. The in-contact dairy cows were screened for TB and 98% (45/46) of the cows tested positive to CIDT. Furthermore, the same strain, SB0134, was also isolated from the two in-contact cows. The isolation of a matching genotype (SB0134) of M. bovis from both species sharing a known epidemiologic link strongly suggests that the sheep flock might have acquired the pathogen from the dairy cows. This warrants strict physical separation of the sheep flock from the cattle herd to prevent such interspecies transmission of M. bovis.",Clinical Characteristics of 1378 Inpatients with Spinal Tuberculosis in General Hospitals in South-Central China.,https://www.ncbi.nlm.nih.gov/pubmed/30941375,BioMed research international,2019 04 06,"In this retrospective study, charts of inpatients with spinal tuberculosis (STB) treated in large-scale general hospitals in Changsha, Hunan, China, between 2007 and 2016 were reviewed to investigate their clinical characteristics. Demographic, epidemiological and clinical features, imaging findings, treatment methods, and prognosis were summarized and analyzed. There were 1378 patients, 805 males and 573 females, with a mean age of 43.7 years. The mean interval between symptom onset and diagnosis was 16.0 months (range 15 days-240 months). The incidence of back pain, radicular pain and symptoms of systemic toxicity was 92.5%, 40.1%, and 32.1%, respectively. The rate of neurological impairment was 49.9 %. STB was present in two or more vertebrae in 91.1% of patients, with two adjacent vertebrae being involved in 67.9% of them. The lumbar segment (38.2%) was the most frequently affected, followed by the thoracic spine (35.7%). The sacrococcygeal area was the least frequently involved (0.8%). Abscesses were detected in 65.5% of patients. One thousand patients (72.6%) were managed with surgery and 378 (27.4%) with anti-TB drugs only. Cure was achieved in 1215 patients (88.2%), whereas 49 (3.5 %) had relapses. Concomitant pulmonary TB (PTB) was diagnosed in 366 patients (26.6%) and 63 (4.6%) had concomitant diabetes. Compared with the previous five years, the number of older patients, urban patients, and medical staff with STB had increased by 6.1%, 5.2%, and 1.3%, respectively in the five years studied. STB remains a severe public health problem that cannot be ignored. Most of the patients ignored early symptoms and therefore received untimely treatment. Thus, surveillance for and treatment of STB in South-central China requires strengthening. In addition to the current China-wide database of patients with PTB, a China-wide database of patients with STB should also be set up."

In the present work, we evaluated gene expression alterations in four flax genotypes with diverse tolerance to aluminum exposure. Using RNA-Seq approach, we revealed genes that are differentially expressed under aluminum stress in resistant (Hermes, TMP1919) and sensitive (Lira, Orshanskiy) cultivars and selectively confirmed the identified alterations using qPCR. To search for differences in response to aluminum between resistant and sensitive genotypes, we developed the scoring that allowed us to suggest the involvement of MADS-box and NAC transcription factors regulating plant growth and development and enzymes participating in cell wall modifications in aluminum tolerance in flax. Using Gene Ontology (GO) enrichment analysis, we revealed that glutathione metabolism, oxidoreductase, and transmembrane transporter activities are the most affected by the studied stress in flax. Thus, we identified genes that are involved in aluminum response in resistant and sensitive genotypes and suggested genes that contribute to flax tolerance to the aluminum stress.",Long-Term Effects of Myoinositol on Behavioural Seizures and Biochemical Changes Evoked by Kainic Acid Induced Epileptogenesis.,https://www.ncbi.nlm.nih.gov/pubmed/30941363,BioMed research international,2019 04 06,"Epilepsy is one of the most devastating neurological diseases and despite significant efforts there is no cure available. Occurrence of spontaneous seizures in epilepsy is preceded by numerous functional and structural pathophysiological reorganizations in the brain-a process called epileptogenesis. Treatment strategies targeting this process may be efficient for preventing spontaneous recurrent seizures (SRS) in epilepsy, or for modification of disease progression. We have previously shown that (i) myoinositol (MI) pretreatment significantly decreases severity of acute seizures (status epilepticus: SE) induced by kainic acid (KA) in experimental animals and (ii) that daily post-SE administration of MI for 4 weeks prevents certain biochemical changes triggered by SE. However it was not established whether such MI treatment also exerts long-term effects on the frequency of SRS. In the present study we have shown that, in KA-induced post-SE epilepsy model in rats, MI treatment for 28 days reduces frequency and duration of behavioural SRS not only during the treatment, but also after its termination for the following 4 weeks. Moreover, MI has significant effects on molecular changes in the hippocampus, including mi-RNA expression spectrum, as well as mRNA levels of sodium-MI transporter and LRRC8A subunit of the volume regulated anionic channel. Taken together, these data suggest that molecular changes induced by MI treatment may counteract epileptogenesis. Thus, here we provide data indicating antiepileptogenic properties of MI, which further supports the idea of developing new antiepileptogenic and disease modifying drug that targets MI system.",Surgical Treatment for Posterior Dislocation of Hip Combined with Acetabular Fractures Using Preoperative Virtual Simulation and Three-Dimensional Printing Model-Assisted Precontoured Plate Fixation Techniques.,https://www.ncbi.nlm.nih.gov/pubmed/30941362,BioMed research international,2019 04 06,"Hip dislocation combined with acetabular fracture remains a challenging condition for orthopedic surgeons.

The relationship between sedative and hypnotic effects of ginseng glycoproteins and brain metabolism was discussed. Referring to pentobarbital sodium subthreshold test, we randomly divided 20 mice into two groups: control and ginseng glycoproteins group. The mice from the control group were treated with normal saline by i.p and GPr group were treated with 60 mg/kg of GPr by i.p. The results indicated that GPr could significantly improve the sleep quality of mice. Through multivariate statistical analysis, we found that there were 23 differential metabolites in whole brain tissues between the control group and the GPr group. The pathway analysis exhibited that GPr may be involved in the regulation of the pathway including purine metabolism, nicotinate and nicotinamide metabolism, glycine, serine and threonine metabolism, arginine and proline metabolism, alanine, aspartate and glutamate metabolism, and steroid hormone biosynthesis. This work is helpful to understand the biochemical mechanism of GPr on promoting sleep and lay a foundation for further development of drugs for insomnia.",Can Inflammatory and Nutritional Serum Markers Predict Chemotherapy Outcomes and Survival in Advanced Stage Nonsmall Cell Lung Cancer Patients?,https://www.ncbi.nlm.nih.gov/pubmed/30941358,BioMed research international,2019 04 06,"Purpose. To determine the values of prognostic nutritional and inflammatory markers in chemotherapy outcomes and survival in the patients with advanced nonsmall cell lung cancer (NSCLC) and also in the secondary malnutrition and cachexia. Methods. Twenty-five patients with diagnosis of aNSCLC were registered for the prospective study. Malnutrition was determined by the Subjective Global Assessment (SGA) and performance status by criteria of the Eastern Cooperative Oncology Group (ECOG). Before treatment, serum levels of albumin, prealbumin, vitamin D, zinc (Zn), C-reactive protein (CRP), IL-6, IL-1 β, TNF-α, lipoprotein lipase (LPL), and the Glasgow Prognostic Score (GPS) were recorded. Patients were followed prospectively for treatment outcomes and survival. Results. Due to the deaths of 18 patients during the 4-month follow-up period, no adequate measurements of inflammatory and nutritional markers could be performed. However, seven patients completed the treatment period and evaluations of these markers could be performed during the three periods. Eighty-four percent of patients were male with a mean age of 63.3 ± 8.7 years. Evaluation of the malnutrition by SGA showed that 5 (20%) patients were well nourished (A), 12(48%) were moderately malnourished (B), and 8(32%) were severely malnourished (C). Low levels of serum albumin (<3.5g/dl), prealbumin (<20 mg/ml), 25-hydroxycholecalciferol (<30 ng/ml), and Zn (<70mg/ml) were detected in 15(60%), 17(68%), 24 (96%), and 22 (88%) patients, respectively. Elevated levels of CRP (≥10 mg/L), IL6 (≥18pg/ml), TNF-α (≥24pg/ml), IL-1β (≥10pg/ml), and LPL (<12pg/ml) were found in 24 (96%), 11(44%), 9(36), 13(52%), and 11(44%) patients, respectively. Moderate and severe malnutrition, acute phase response, and reduced survival were determined in patients with NCSLC. In 7 patients that completed the treatment period, there was an association between elevated serum levels of IL-6, IL-1β, TNF-α, CRP, and LPL and also the reduced serum levels of albumin, prealbumin, Zn, vitamin D, and GPS, respectively. Similarly, Friedman analysis indicated that prealbumin significantly increased (p=0.007) in the follow-up period. But the serum levels of CRP (mean 37.3±22.3; Wilcoxon test P=0.368) in the seven patients were lower than those of the 18 patients that expired (mean 75.82±56.2). Conclusion. Malnutrition and cachexia negatively influence oncological outcomes in patients with NSCLC. These nutritional/inflammatory markers may be useful for selection of high risk and reduced survival in patients with aNSCLC undergoing adjuvant chemotherapy.","Nutritional, Physicochemical, and Sensorial Evaluation of Flat Bread Supplemented with Quinoa Flour.",https://www.ncbi.nlm.nih.gov/pubmed/30941357,International journal of food science,2019 04 06,"The purpose of the present research was to develop novel flat bread supplemented with quinoa flour to raise its nutritional quality and functional properties. Furthermore, evaluation of the quality of developed bread was realized with blends at 5, 10, 15, 20, 25, and 30% of quinoa flour. Chemical composition of supplemented flat bread was determined. Several properties on dough (water absorption, dough development time, stability time, elasticity, and extensibility) and their corresponding characteristics (loaf specific volume, baking loss, roundness, height, baking time, hardness, cohesiveness, springiness, resilience, gumminess, and chewiness) were then evaluated. The protein content in bread-based quinoa blends was significantly increased gradually with increasing the percentage of quinoa flour from 12.12±0.63% in control to 15.85±0.065% in 30% quinoa flour. Also, the amino acids content was increased with increasing the percentage of quinoa flour. Mineral contents in 30% quinoa flour blend such as sodium, potassium, magnesium, calcium, iron, copper, manganese, and zinc were higher than other ratios and control bread (100% wheat flour). Rheological properties of supplemented bread such as specific volume, appearance, crust and crumb texture, aroma-odor, and colour were evaluated and found to be excellent. Physicosensory characteristics of the bread fortified with quinoa flour were evaluated and the most of panelists accepted and preferred the bread supplemented with quinoa flour more than control. The obtained unique nutritional, physicochemical, and organoleptic characteristics of quinoa flour-based flat bread open a new promising prospect for utilization of quinoa flour in an industrial scale for treatment and/or prevention of malnutrition in developing counties.",The Potential of Hormonal Contraception to Influence Female Sexuality.,https://www.ncbi.nlm.nih.gov/pubmed/30941356,International journal of reproductive medicine,2019 04 06,The association between female sexual function and hormonal contraception is controversial.

Two zones are free from FMD with vaccination and three without vaccination. Quantitative risk assessment was used here to estimate the risk of introduction of FMD virus (FMDV) into the Argentine FMD-free without vaccination zone via legal or illegal trade of bone-in beef and non-vaccinated live animals from the FMD-free zone with vaccination of the country. Because trade of those commodities between those two zones is currently banned in Argentina, the analysis here will help evaluating the impact of relaxing such prohibition in the national regulation and the impact of illegal trade. Results suggest that if the volume of incoming bone-in beef is equal to the volume of deboned beef that enters the non-vaccinating zone, the annual risk of an FMDV introduction to the zone without vaccination will be low (0.0017). Indeed, the risk of introduction per kg trade volume via illegal trade is 6.9 times higher compared to legal trade. Similarly, the annual risk was also low for movement of live sheep and goat (0.0059) and swine (0.007) when the FMDV was assumed to be adapted to bovine and when a serological test was performed prior to movement. The implementation of a serological test to sheep and goat reduces 19 times the risk for FMDV introduction. In conclusion, the risk of introduction of FMDV into the FMD-free zone without vaccination through bone-in beef, sheep, goat, and swine with certain requirements, such as serological testing, is nil. If legal trade was allowed, the incoming risk may even be lower, compared to the current scenario of prohibiting the introduction. Results are likely due to the controls associated to legal trade, and the subsequent reduction of illegal trade. Consequently, results suggest that a policy of incentive and facilitation of good practices may be more effective in preventing FMDV introduction into a free zone than prohibition of trade."

A Systematic Review of Reviews Across Settings.,https://www.ncbi.nlm.nih.gov/pubmed/30941342,Frontiers in public health,2019 04 06,"Introduction: A vast majority of children and adolescents are physically inactive. As a result, high obesity rates and related diseases have made physical activity promotion a politically relevant topic. In order to form the basis for political decision making, evidence is required regarding the efficacy and effectiveness of interventions for physical activity promotion. In contrast to previous research, this systematic review of reviews targets three key settings (family and home, childcare, school), and is among the largest to have been conducted. Methods: A systematic review of reviews was conducted as part of a large-scale project to develop national recommendations for physical activity promotion in Germany. Six electronic databases were searched and inclusion criteria were defined. Two independent reviewers screened the titles and abstracts of potentially relevant literature. 213 reviews were identified and categorised by target group. A total of 74 reviews were identified dealing with children and adolescents. Each review underwent a quality assessment. Results: 39 reviews with the highest quality and relevance were analysed. Three reviews focused on the family and home setting, 4 on the childcare setting, 28 on the school setting and 4 on other settings. Evidence revealed the key role played by parents in promoting physical activity in children within each setting. Furthermore, evidence pointed toward the efficacy of multi-component interventions in the childcare and school setting. Several evidence-based intervention strategies were identified for childcare facilities and schools. Discussion: The review of reviews identified a number of promising strategies for PA promotion among children and adolescents. Among reviews, multi-component interventions in childcare facilities and schools stand out prominently. At the same time, the review of reviews indicated that there is still a lack of studies on the efficacy of interventions that go beyond the individual level. We recommend that future research should also target community and policy level interventions and interventions other than the school setting. In order to make more specific recommendations regarding the scale-up of promising intervention strategies, further knowledge about the effectiveness, health equity and cost effectiveness of interventions is needed.",Evaluation of a Health Communication Campaign to Improve Mosquito Awareness and Prevention Practices in Western Australia.,https://www.ncbi.nlm.nih.gov/pubmed/30941341,Frontiers in public health,2019 04 06,"Fight the Bite represents the Department of Health's first attempt to actively raise awareness and improve prevention practices related to mosquitoes in Western Australia (WA). The multi-faceted campaign model involved a range of stakeholders and delivery methods over a 2 year period, achieving a recall rate of 8.2% among 2,500 survey participants. Significant regional differences were noted in campaign exposure, reflecting the variation in mosquito management issues throughout the State, and subsequent engagement by local government. Of those individuals with campaign recall, 43.8% reported an increase in awareness and 27.4% reported a change in behavior, which equated to a 1.7 and 1.2% change across the total survey population, respectively. The results of this study demonstrate that Fight the Bite has significantly improved awareness and prevention practices among those individuals who were exposed to the campaign. This was particularly promising, given the modest budget, resources, and time period over which the campaign was run prior to evaluation. This outcome means that Fight the Bite can be confidently adopted as a proven and standardized but regionally adaptable campaign approach to raising awareness about mosquito avoidance and mosquito-borne diseases by the Department of Health and its stakeholders. Future campaign aims include increasing reach through heightened and sustained promotion of Fight the Bite by both the Department and local government, as well as expanded collaboration with a range of stakeholders within the community.",Even a Previous Light-Active Physical Activity at Work Still Reduces Late Myocardial Infarction and Stroke in Retired Adults Aged>65 Years by 32%: The PROOF Cohort Study.,https://www.ncbi.nlm.nih.gov/pubmed/30941340,Frontiers in public health,2019 04 06,"Background: Work may contribute significantly to daily physical activity (PA) and sedentary behavior (SB). Physical inactivity and SB at work might be two major risk factors for premature morbidity. Therefore, the aim of this research was to describe self-reported past PA and SB at work and during leisure time within the PROOF cohort subjects, and to determine consequences of PA and SB on late health of these now retired workers. Material and Methods: The PROOF cohort study was used to prospectively allow assessment of the predictive value of PA and SB at work and during leisure time among a healthy retired French population, with regard to cardiovascular and cerebrovascular events. PA (MET-h/week) and SB (h/d) were assessed using the Population Physical Activity Questionnaire (POPAQ) and the modified Global Physical Activity Questionnaire (GPAQ). Odds ratios (ORs with 95% CIs) for cardiovascular and cerebrovascular events were associated with each level of PA at work: light (<3 METs), moderate (3-5.9 METs), vigorous (≥6 METs) and were compared to SB at work. Results: Out of the 1011 65-year-old subjects initially included, the 15-year follow-up has been currently completed for 688 (68%) subjects; 89 deaths (all-cause mortality, 9%) and 91 fatal and non-fatal cardiovascular and cerebrovascular events (9%), were reported. An active work (light, moderate, or vigorous intensity) was associated with a 21% reduced risk of cardiovascular (myocardial infarction) and cerebrovascular events (stroke) (OR = 0.79, 95% CI: 0.32-0.91, p < 0.02) compared to sedentary work. This relationship was already significant for light intensity work (32%; i.e., OR = 0.68, 95% CI: 0.31-0.87, p < 0.02). Conclusion: There is strong causal evidence linking PA and SB at work with late cardiovascular and cerebrovascular disease. All in all, the risk for onset of myocardial infarction and stroke was lower among those who had a previous active work compared to those with previous sedentary work. Even previous light active work produced substantial health benefits.

Assessment of the efficacy of laparoscopic vascular-hitch procedure in UPJO caused by lower pole crossing vessels (CV). Materials and Methods: Between 2008 and 2017, 47 laparoscopic procedures were performed with the CV discovered intraoperatively. CV were translocated cephalad, and the UPJ was carefully inspected. The Chapman's vascular hitch procedure was accomplished in the case of decreasing sizes of the pelvis and clear, visible peristalsis of the UPJ (31 patients). In the other cases, Anderson-Hynes (A-H) pyeloplasty with posterior translocation of the CV was performed (16 patients). Results: The median age at operation was 6 years (range 1-16) in VH and 6 years (range 2-17) in A-H (p = 0.4635). Prenatal dilatation of kidney was diagnosed in 18.7% of VH and 10% of A-H cases (p = 0.5474). Success was achieved in 16 (100%) patients in the A-H and in 29 (93.54%) in the VH groups. Two patients (6.5%) in VH required repeated surgery because of a misdiagnosed intrinsic obstruction. Median operation time in VH was 80 min (range 40-105) and was 105 (range 70-225) in A-H (p < 0.05). Conclusions: The intraoperative selection based on intraoperative pelvis and UPJ appearance after vessel transposition is sufficient in majority of cases. Laparoscopic vascular hitch seems to be effective and safe procedure, but can only be performed on carefully selected patients. In case of misdiagnosis, reoperation is possible with the same laparoscopic access.",Neutrophil-to-Lymphocyte Ratio Predicts Intravenous Immunoglobulin-Resistance in Infants Under 12-Months Old With Kawasaki Disease.,https://www.ncbi.nlm.nih.gov/pubmed/30941338,Frontiers in pediatrics,2019 04 06,"Objective: We evaluated the ability of peripheral blood neutrophil-to-lymphocyte ratio (NLR) to predict the intravenous immunoglobulin (IVIG) resistance in Kawasaki disease (KD) patients under 1-year of age. Methods: A total of 92 KD patients under the age of 1-year and who were hospitalized in Peking University First Hospital from June 2007 to August 2016 were recruited in this study. The clinical and laboratory data were analyzed to see if peripheral blood NLR was useful for predicting the IVIG-resistance in KD. Results: Totally 81 out of 92 patients were IVIG responders while 11 resistant to IVIG, with no significant difference in age, gender, ratio of the number of the incomplete to the number of complete KD, and the number of patients with coronary artery lesion between two groups (p > 0.05). Peripheral blood NLR was increased significantly in IVIG-resistant children compared to the IVIG responders [2.6 (interquartile range: 1.4, 3.8) vs. 1.7 (interquartile range: 0.9, 2.3), p = 0.039]. A cut-off value of NLR of 2.51 in KD patients younger than 1-year old yielded a sensitivity of 0.545 and specificity of 0.840, respectively, in the prediction of IVIG resistance. An area under the curve of 0.692 (95% confidence interval 0.526-0.859, p = 0.039) was determined. Conclusions: The peripheral blood NLR ≥ 2.51 is useful to predict the IVIG resistance in KD patients younger than 1-year old.",Perinatal Outcomes of Small for Gestational Age Neonates Born With an Isolated Single Umbilical Artery.,https://www.ncbi.nlm.nih.gov/pubmed/30941337,Frontiers in pediatrics,2019 04 06,"Objective: To investigate pregnancy outcomes of small for gestational age (SGA) neonates born with isolated single umbilical artery (iSUA) compared to SGA neonates without iSUA. Study Design: This was a population-based retrospective cohort analysis. The study group was defined as a singleton SGA neonate born with iSUA, while an SGA neonate without iSUA comprised the comparison group. We evaluated adverse perinatal outcomes in all SGA neonates born at the Soroka University Medical Center between the years 1998-2013. Multiple gestations, fetuses with known congenital malformations or chromosomal abnormalities and patients with lack of prenatal care were excluded from the study. Multivariate logistic regression models were constructed to identify independent factors associated with adverse perinatal outcomes. Results: Of 12,915 SGA deliveries, 1.2% (162) were complicated with iSUA. Women in the study group were older with a significantly lower gestational age at delivery compared with the comparison group. Rates of women who conceived after infertility treatments were higher in the study group. Additionally, patients in the study group had significantly higher rates of preterm deliveries, placental abruption, cord prolapse, non-reassuring fetal heart rates and cesarean delivery were noted in the study group. These neonates had a significantly lower birth weight (1988.0 ± 697 vs. 2388.3 ± 481 p < 0.001) and higher rates of low APGAR scores at the first and fifth minutes after birth compared with controls. Perinatal mortality was also found to be significantly higher among SGA neonates complicated with iSUA. Preterm delivery as well as perinatal mortality were found independently associated with iSUA among SGA neonates (aOR 4.01, 95% CI 2.88-5.59, aOR 2.24, 95% CI 1.25-4.01, respectively).

The conventional view of eosinophilic asthma is that airway inflammation is the fundamental underlying abnormality, and airway inflammation and hyper-responsiveness are secondary; in fact, these three are parallel processes. Very early structural changes, independent of inflammation and infection, are associated with early airway hyper-responsiveness and later adverse respiratory outcomes. There is a bidirectional relationship between structural airway wall changes and airway inflammation, with airway contraction per se leading to the release of growth factors, and inflammatory pathways promoting airway remodeling. Early viral infection (and increasingly being appreciated, bacterial infection) is important in wheeze outcomes. There is evidence of abnormal immune function including cytokine release before the onset of viral infections. However, viral infections may also have prolonged effects on the host immune system, and the evidence for beneficial and adverse effects of viral infection is conflicting. In older children and adults, asthmatic epithelial cells show impaired interferon responses to viral infection, but only in the presence of uncontrolled type 2 inflammation, implying these are secondary phenomena. There are also compelling data relating the innate immune system to later asthma and atopy, and animal studies suggest that the effects of a high endotoxin, microbiologically diverse environment may be modulated via the epithelial alarmin IL-33. Whereas, previously only viral infection was thought to be important, early bacterial colonization of the upper airway is coming to the fore, associated with a mixed pattern of TH1/TH2/TH17 cytokine secretion, and adverse long term outcomes. Bacterial colonization is probably a marker of a subtle immune deficiency, rather than directly causal. The airway and gut microbiome critically impacts the development of Type 2 inflammatory responses. However, Type 2 inflammatory cytokines, which are critical both to progression from pre-school wheeze to eosinophilic asthma, and sustaining the eosinophilic asthmatic state, are not implicated in the very early development of the disease. Taken together, the evidence is that the earliest cytokine and chemokine signals will come from the study of bronchial epithelial cell function and their interactions with viruses and the microbiome.",Pathophysiological Mechanisms of Asthma.,https://www.ncbi.nlm.nih.gov/pubmed/30941334,Frontiers in pediatrics,2019 04 06,"The recent Lancet commission has highlighted that ""asthma"" should be used to describe a clinical syndrome of wheeze, breathlessness, chest tightness, and sometimes cough. The next step is to deconstruct the airway into components of fixed and variable airflow obstruction, inflammation, infection and altered cough reflex, setting the airway disease in the context of extra-pulmonary co-morbidities and social and environmental factors. The emphasis is always on delineating treatable traits, including variable airflow obstruction caused by airway smooth muscle constriction (treated with short- and long-acting β-2 agonists), eosinophilic airway inflammation (treated with inhaled corticosteroids) and chronic bacterial infection (treated with antibiotics with benefit if it is driving the disease). It is also important not to over-treat the untreatable, such as fixed airflow obstruction. These can all be determined using simple, non-invasive tests such as spirometry before and after acute administration of a bronchodilator (reversible airflow obstruction); peripheral blood eosinophil count, induced sputum, exhaled nitric oxide (airway eosinophilia); and sputum or cough swab culture (bacterial infection). Additionally, the pathophysiology of risk domains must be considered: these are risk of an asthma attack, risk of poor airway growth, and in pre-school children, risk of progression to eosinophilic school age asthma. Phenotyping the airway will allow more precise diagnosis and targeted treatment, but it is important to move to endotypes, especially in the era of increasing numbers of biologicals. Advances in -omics technology allow delineation of pathways, which will be particularly important in TH2 low eosinophilic asthma, and also pauci-inflammatory disease. It is very important to appreciate the difficulties of cluster analysis; a patient may have eosinophilic airway disease because of a steroid resistant endotype, because of non-adherence to basic treatment, and a surge in environmental allergen burden. Sophisticated -omics approaches will be reviewed in this manuscript, but currently they are not being used in clinical practice. However, even while they are being evaluated, management of the asthmas can and should be improved by considering the pathophysiologies of the different airway diseases lumped under that umbrella term, using simple, non-invasive tests which are readily available, and treating accordingly.",Copper Mediates Anti-Inflammatory and Antifibrotic Activity of Gleevec in Hepatocellular Carcinoma-Induced Male Rats.,https://www.ncbi.nlm.nih.gov/pubmed/30941331,Canadian journal of gastroenterology & hepatology,2019 04 17,"The elevated level of copper is one of the hallmark features of cancer cells in most of the types of cancer. In the present study, this feature has been targeted to investigate if coadministration of exogenous copper (Cu+) and its chelating agent like disulfiram (DSF+) influence the antineoplastic activity of the anticancer drug, Gleevec (GLV+), in hepatocellular carcinoma (HCC)-induced rats via immunomodulation. After the treatment, the level of proinflammatory interleukins (IL-1, 2, 6, and 7), anti-inflammatory interleukin (IL-10) concomitant with transcription factors (NF-kB and TNF-a), and the apoptotic marker (cleaved PARP) was estimated. The cancer-induced group without treatment (CN+) demonstrated abnormally elevated level of all proinflammatory cytokines and transcription factors concomitant with a compromised level of cleaved PARP as compared to the control normal (CN-). The detailed histological analysis also supported the results exhibiting extensive inflammation and tissue fibrosis confirming the second stage of HCC. Cu+, DSF+, and GLV+ displayed mild improvement in most of the parameters, but the combination group GLV + Cu+ demonstrated remarkable recovery in histology and most of the parameters tended towards the CN- followed by GLV + DSF+. Therefore, the management of copper level is critical in realizing the antineoplastic activity of GLV up to its full potential in cancer treatment.

Under certain circumstances, virulent strains can breach the mucosal barrier and enter the bloodstream, causing severe Glässer's disease. Many virulence factors are found to be related to the pathogenicity of H. parasuis strain, but the pathogenic mechanism remains unclear. LuxS/AI-2, as a kind of very important quorum sensing system, affects the growth characteristics, biofilm formation, antibiotic production, virulence, and metabolism of different strains. In order to investigate the effect of luxS/AI-2 quorum sensing system on the virulence of H. parasuis, a deletion mutant strain (ΔluxS) and complemented strain (C-luxS) were constructed and characterized. The results showed that the luxS gene participated in regulating and controlling stress resistance, biofilm formation and virulence. Compared with wild-type strain, ΔluxS strain decreased the production of AI-2 molecules and the tolerance toward oxidative stress and heat shock, and it reduced the abilities of autoagglutination, hemagglutination, and adherence, whereas it increased the abilities to form biofilm in vitro. In vivo experiments showed that ΔluxS strain attenuated its virulence about 10-folds and significantly decreased its tissue burden of bacteria in mice, compared with the wild-type strain. Taken together, the luxS/AI-2 quorum sensing system in H. parasuis not only plays an important role in growth and biofilm formation, but also affects the pathogenicity of H. parasuis.",Next Generation Sequencing and Genetic Alterations in Squamous Cell Lung Carcinoma: Where Are We Today?,https://www.ncbi.nlm.nih.gov/pubmed/30941314,Frontiers in oncology,2019 04 06,"Lung cancer is the leading cause of cancer-related mortality and will affect ~6% of the population. It is divided into two broad categories, small cell lung cancer and non-small cell lung cancer (NSCLC), the latter representing 85% of all lung cancers. It mainly comprises adenocarcinoma (65%) and squamous cell carcinoma (30%) histologies. In recent years, there have been two major therapeutic advances in NSCLC. The first, immunotherapy, has greatly improved the prognosis of adenocarcinomas and squamous cell carcinomas. The second, the treatment of targetable driver mutations, has so far only benefited adenocarcinomas. Squamous cell carcinoma carries a high rate of mutations and is found mostly among smokers. This raises two important problems: identifying driver mutations and finding those of clinical relevance. Large-scale genomic analyses such as The Cancer Genome Atlas have allowed for the identification of frequent gene alterations, although their role and potential for targeted therapy remain unknown. The emergence of next generation sequencing has changed the landscape of precision medicine, in particular in lung cancer. In this review, we discuss the landscape of genetic alterations found in squamous cell lung cancer, the results of current targeted therapy trials, the difficulties in identifying and treating these alterations and how to integrate modern tools in clinical practice.",Nuclear Receptor Coactivator 2 Promotes Human Breast Cancer Cell Growth by Positively Regulating the MAPK/ERK Pathway.,https://www.ncbi.nlm.nih.gov/pubmed/30941313,Frontiers in oncology,2019 04 06,"As a member of the p160 steroid receptor coactivator (SRC) family, nuclear receptor coactivator 2 (NCOA2) is known to play essential roles in many physiological and pathological processes, including development, endocrine regulation, and tumorigenesis. However, the biological function of NCOA2 in breast cancer is not fully understood. We found that the copy number of the NCOA2 gene was frequently amplified in four breast cancers datasets, varying from 6 to 10%, and the mRNA levels of NCOA2 were also upregulated in 11% of the sequenced cases/patients (TCGA provisional dataset). Next, we confirmed that NCOA2 silencing significantly suppressed cell proliferation in different breast cancer cell lines, by inducing cell cycle arrest and apoptosis. Mechanistically, whole-transcriptome sequencing (RNA-Seq) analysis showed that NCOA2 depletion leads to downregulation of the MAPK/ERK signaling cascade, possibly via downregulating NCOA2's downstream target RASEF. In conclusion, our results suggest NCOA2 as a potential target of therapeutics against breast cancer.","Turning ""Cold"" Into ""Hot"" Tumors-Opportunities and Challenges for Radio-Immunotherapy Against Primary and Metastatic Brain Cancers.",https://www.ncbi.nlm.nih.gov/pubmed/30941312,Frontiers in oncology,2019 04 06,"The development of immunotherapies has revolutionized intervention strategies for a variety of primary cancers. Despite this promising progress, treatment options for primary brain cancer and brain metastasis remain limited and still largely depend on surgical resection, radio- and/or chemotherapy. The paucity in the successful development of immunotherapies for brain cancers can in part be attributed to the traditional view of the brain as an immunologically privileged site. The presence of the blood-brain barrier and the absence of lymphatic drainage were believed to restrict the entry of blood-borne immune and inflammatory cells into the central nervous system (CNS), leading to an exclusion of the brain from systemic immune surveillance. However, recent insight from pre-clinical and clinical studies on the immune landscape of brain cancers challenged this dogma. Recruitment of blood-borne immune cells into the CNS provides unprecedented opportunities for the development of tumor microenvironment (TME)-targeted or immunotherapies against primary and metastatic cancers. Moreover, it is increasingly recognized that in addition to genotoxic effects, ionizing radiation represents a critical modulator of tumor-associated inflammation and synergizes with immunotherapies in adjuvant settings. This review summarizes current knowledge on the cellular and molecular identity of tumor-associated immune cells in primary and metastatic brain cancers and discusses underlying mechanisms by which ionizing radiation modulates the immune response. Detailed mechanistic insight into the effects of radiation on the unique immune landscape of brain cancers is essential for the development of multimodality intervention strategies in which immune-modulatory effects of radiotherapy are exploited to sensitize brain cancers to immunotherapies by converting immunologically ""cold"" into ""hot"" environments.",Investigating the Connection Between Endogenous Heme Accumulation and COX2 Activity in Cancer Cells.,https://www.ncbi.nlm.nih.gov/pubmed/30941311,Frontiers in oncology,2019 04 06,"Heme, an iron-containing porphyrin, is fundamental for a variety of functions in cell homeostasis. Nevertheless, recent data indicate that dysregulation of heme metabolism might promote tumorigenesis. The intracellular heme pool is finely regulated through the control of heme synthesis, degradation, incorporation into hemoproteins and trafficking across membranes. All these processes might be potentially targeted to alter endogenous heme content in order to counteract cancer growth. Nevertheless, these putative therapeutic interventions have to take into account the possibility of undesired side effects, such as the over-activation of heme-dependent enzymes involved in cancer. Among them, cyclooxygenase-2 is a prostaglandin-producing hemoprotein, induced during inflammation and in different types of tumor, particularly in colorectal cancer. The aim of this study was to evaluate whether modulation of endogenous heme may affect cyclooxygenase-2 expression and activity, taking advantage of two different approaches able to alter heme levels: the silencing of the heme exporter Feline Leukemia Virus subgroup C receptor 1 and the induction of heme synthesis by 5-aminolevulinic acid administration. Our data demonstrate that the down-regulation of the heme exporter in colorectal cancer cells does not affect cyclooxygenase-2 expression and activity. Conversely, 5-aminolevulinic acid administration results in decreased cyclooxygenase-2 expression. However, the overall cyclooxygenase-2 enzymatic activity is maintained. The present work sheds light on the complex modulation of cyclooxygenase-2 by endogenous heme and support the idea that targeting heme metabolism could be a valuable therapeutic option against cancer.",Therapeutic Targeting of Cancer Stem Cells: Integrating and Exploiting the Acidic Niche.,https://www.ncbi.nlm.nih.gov/pubmed/30941310,Frontiers in oncology,2019 04 06,"Cancer stem cells (CSC) or tumor-initiating cells represent a small subpopulation of cells within the tumor bulk that share features with somatic stem cells, such as self-renewal and pluripotency. From a clinical point of view, CSC are thought to be the main drivers of tumor relapse in patients by supporting treatment resistance and dissemination to distant organs. Both genome instability and microenvironment-driven selection support tumor heterogeneity and enable the emergence of resistant cells with stem-like properties, when therapy is applied. Besides hypoxia and nutrient deprivation, acidosis is another selection barrier in the tumor microenvironment (TME) which provides a permissive niche to shape more aggressive and fitter cancer cell phenotypes. This review describes our current knowledge about the influence of the ""acidic niche"" on the stem-like phenotypic features of cancer cells. In addition, we briefly survey new therapeutic options that may help eradicate CSC by integrating and/or exploiting the acidic niche, and thereby contribute to prevent the occurrence of therapy resistance as well as metastatic dissemination.",Novel Approaches to Improve the Efficacy of Immuno-Radiotherapy.,https://www.ncbi.nlm.nih.gov/pubmed/30941308,Frontiers in oncology,2019 04 06,"Radiotherapy (RT) has been applied for decades as a treatment modality in the management of various types of cancer. Ionizing radiation induces tumor cell death, which in turn can either elicit protective anti-tumor immune responses or immunosuppression in the tumor micromilieu that contributes to local tumor recurrence. Immunosuppression is frequently accompanied by the attraction of immunosuppressive cells such as myeloid-derived suppressor cells (MDSCs), M2 tumor-associated macrophages (TAMs), T regulatory cells (Tregs), N2 neutrophils, and by the release of immunosuppressive cytokines (TGF-β, IL-10) and chemokines. Immune checkpoint pathways, particularly of the PD-1/PD-L1 axis, have been determined as key regulators of cancer immune escape. While IFN-dependent upregulation of PD-L1 has been extensively investigated, up-to-date studies indicated the importance of DNA damage signaling in the regulation of PD-L1 expression following RT. DNA damage dependent PD-L1 expression is upregulated by ATM/ATR/Chk1 kinase activities and cGAS/STING-dependent pathway, proving the role of DNA damage signaling in PD-L1 induced expression. Checkpoint blockade immunotherapies (i.e., application of anti-PD-1 and anti-PD-L1 antibodies) combined with RT were shown to significantly improve the objective response rates in therapy of various primary and metastatic malignancies. Further improvements in the therapeutic potential of RT are based on combinations of RT with other immunotherapeutic approaches including vaccines, cytokines and cytokine inducers, and an adoptive immune cell transfer (DCs, NK cells, T cells). In the current review we provide immunological rationale for a combination of RT with various immunotherapies as well as analysis of the emerging preclinical evidences for these therapies.",Phase 1 Study Evaluating the Association of the Cyclin-Dependent Kinase 4/6 Inhibitor Ribociclib and Cetuximab in Recurrent/Metastatic p16-Negative Squamous Cell Carcinoma of the Head and Neck.,https://www.ncbi.nlm.nih.gov/pubmed/30941307,Frontiers in oncology,2019 04 06,"Background: The majority of human papillomavirus (HPV)-negative squamous cell carcinoma of the head and neck (SCCHN) present upregulation of the epidermal growth factor receptor (EGFR) and frequent alterations in the cyclin D1-cyclin dependent kinase (CDK) 4/6 (CDK 4/6)-retinoblastoma protein (pRb) pathway, resulting in cell cycle progression and tumor proliferation. This study investigated the combination of ribociclib, an orally highly selective inhibitor of CDK 4/6, and cetuximab in recurrent and/or metastatic (R/M) SCCHN. Methods: A phase I trial using a 3 + 3 design was performed to determine the dose limiting toxicity (DLT) and maximum tolerated dose (MTD) of ribociclib with standard dose of weekly cetuximab in HPV-negative patients with R/M SCCHN. Ribociclib was administered orally (3 weeks on/1 week off) at dose level 1 of 400 mg daily and dose level 2 of 600 mg daily. The MTD of ribocilib was then further evaluated in an expansion cohort. Results: 10 patients were enrolled in the escalation trial. No DLTs were observed at dose level 1 (n = 3); at dose level 2, one patient was replaced due to rapid disease progression, and one patient out of six evaluable patients experienced a DLT (grade 4 thrombocytopenia >7 days). Ribociclib 600 mg daily was thus determined to be the MTD. Eleven additional patients were enrolled in the expansion cohort. Diarrhea (52%), rash (52%), fatigue (43%), nausea (33%), and mucositis (28%) were the most frequent grade 1-2 adverse events (AE). Neutropenia was the most frequent grade 3-4 AE (20%). Median progression-free survival (PFS) was 3.5 months (range 0.4-17.3 months) and median overall survival (OS) was 8.3 months (range 0.4-24.1 months). Among the 19 radiologically evaluable patients, two (10.5%) achieved a partial response and 11 (58%) had stable disease. Conclusions: The MTD of ribociclib is 600 mg daily when administered in combination with standard dose cetuximab for 3 weeks on and 1 week off. This combination was safe and showed efficacy. Further clinical trials should be conducted to evaluate the antitumor effects of this combination.

Both the Forkhead box (FOX) M1 transcription factor and the Epidermal Growth Factor (EGF) receptor Pathway Substrate 8 (EPS8) are known to be activated by mitogenic signaling and their levels upregulated in cancer. Well-known to regulate Rac-mediated actin remodeling at the cell cortex, EPS8 carries a nuclear localization signal but its possible nuclear role remains unclear. Here, we demonstrated interaction of FOXM1 with EPS8 in yeast two-hybrid and immunoprecipitation assays. Immunostaining revealed co-localization of the two proteins during G2/M phase of the cell cycle. EPS8 became nuclear localized when CRM1/Exportin 1-dependent nuclear export was inhibited by Leptomycin B, and a functional nuclear export signal could be identified within EPS8 using EGFP-tagging and site-directed mutagenesis. Downregulation of EPS8 using shRNAs suppressed expression of FOXM1 and the FOXM1-target CCNB1, and slowed down G2/M transition in cervical cancer cells. Chromatin immunoprecipitation analysis indicated recruitment of EPS8 to the CCNB1 and CDC25B promoters. Taken together, our findings support a novel partnering role of EPS8 with FOXM1 in the regulation of cancer cell proliferation and provides interesting insight into future design of therapeutic strategy to inhibit cancer cell proliferation.",Assessing Radiosensitivity of Bladder Cancer in vitro: A 2D vs. 3D Approach.,https://www.ncbi.nlm.nih.gov/pubmed/30941305,Frontiers in oncology,2019 04 06,"Background: Bladder cancer is the fourth most commonly diagnosed cancer among males worldwide. Current treatment strategies established for bladder cancer mainly consist of cystectomy yet advances in radiation therapy have pointed to the value of organ-preserving strategies in preserving patients' quality of life. Aim: To study and compare the radiosensitivity in two-dimension (2D) and physiologically-relevant three-dimension (3D) in vitro culture of three human bladder cancer cell lines, RT4, T24, and UM-UC-3. Materials and Methods: Clonogenic assay was performed to assess cells' radiosensitivity in 2D. Employing the 3D Matrigel™-based cultures to enrich for cancer stem cells (CSCs) allowed us to assess the survival of this subpopulation of cells via evaluating the number, i.e., sphere forming unit (SFU), and the sizes of cultured spheres, formed from cells exposed to different radiation doses compared to non-irradiated cells. Results: Irradiating cells with increasing radiation doses revealed highest survival rates with RT4 cells in 2D, followed by T24 and UM-UC-3. In 3D, however, UM-UC-3 cells were shown to be the most radio-resistant as evidenced by the number of spheres formed, yet they displayed the least efficient volume reduction/regression (VR), whilst the volume decreased significantly for both RT4 and T24 cells. Sphere VR and sphere ratio (SR) values were then plotted against each other demonstrating a linear correlation between volume and number with RT4 and UM-UC-3 cell lines, but not T24. Lastly, multiple regression model was employed to evaluate the possibility of obtaining a function combining both 3D parameters, SR and VR, with the surviving fraction (SF) in 2D, and showed a linear regression for T24 cells only, with a correlation coefficient of 0.97 for the combined parameters. Conclusion: We were able to radiobiologically characterize 3 human bladder cancer cell lines showing differential effects of radiation between 2D and 3D culture systems, paving the way for achieving better assessment of radiosensitivity of bladder cancer in vitro."

The secondary aim was to assess the concordance of hand surgeons on definitions of the terms ""subluxated"" and ""dislocated"" for classification of ulnar nerve instability. Methods  A questionnaire, including demographic practice variables, cubital tunnel practice patterns, preoperative imaging and electrodiagnostic evaluation, and a series of standardized intraoperative photographs of ulnar nerve instability at the elbow were developed and distributed to the current American Society for Surgery of the Hand (ASSH) membership. Results  A total of 690 (26.8%) members completed the survey; 84.2% of respondents indicated that they evaluate for ulnar nerve instability preoperatively with clinical examination, whereas only 6.1% indicated they routinely obtained dynamic ultrasound. Respondents indicated that the factors most strongly influencing their decision to proceed with anterior transposition of the ulnar nerve were subluxation on physical examination (89.6%), history consistent with ulnar nerve subluxation (85.8%), and muscle atrophy (43.2%). On review of clinical photographs, respondents demonstrated varying degrees of agreement on the terms ""subluxated"" or ""dislocated"" and recommendations for ulnar nerve transposition at intermediate degrees of ulnar nerve instability. Conclusion  ASSH members routinely evaluate for ulnar nerve instability with history and clinical examination without uniform use of preoperative ultrasound, and nearly half of the time the decision to transpose the ulnar nerve is made intraoperatively. Definitions for the degree of ulnar nerve instability at the elbow are not uniformly agreed upon, and further development of a classification system may be warranted to standardize treatment.",Four-Dimensional Computed Tomography Scanning for Dynamic Wrist Disorders: Prospective Analysis and Recommendations for Clinical Utility.,https://www.ncbi.nlm.nih.gov/pubmed/30941259,Journal of wrist surgery,2019 04 06,"Background  Four-dimensional computed tomography (4D CT) is a rapidly developing diagnostic tool in the assessment of dynamic upper limb disorders. Functional wrist anatomy is incompletely understood, and traditional imaging methods are often insufficient in the diagnosis of dynamic disorders. Technique  This study has developed a protocol for 4D CT of the wrist, with the aim of reviewing the clinical utility of this technology in surgical assessment. A Toshiba Aquilion One Vision scanner was used in the protocol, in which two- and three-dimensional ""static"" images, as well as 4D ""dynamic"" images were produced and assessed in the clinical context of each patient. These consisted of a series of multiple 7-second movement clips exploring the nature and range of joint motion. Patients and Methods  Nineteen patients with symptoms of dynamic instability were included in the study. Patients were assessed clinically by two orthopaedic surgeons, and qualitative data were obtained from radiological interpretation. Results  The study demonstrated varied abnormalities of joint movement attributed to a range of wrist pathology, including degenerative arthritis, ligamentous injuries, Kienbock's disease, and pain following previous surgical reconstructive procedures. Interpretation of the 4D CT scan changed the clinical diagnosis in 13 cases (68.4%), including the primary (15.8%) or secondary diagnosis (52.6%). In all cases, the assessment of the dynamic wrist motion assisted in understanding the clinical problem and led to a change in management in 11 cases (57.9%). The mean effective radiation dose for the scan was calculated at 0.26 mSv. Conclusion  We have found that the clinical utility of 4D CT lies in its ability to provide detailed information about dynamic joint pathology not seen in traditional imaging, targeting surgical treatment. Limitations to the use of 4D CT scan include lack of availability of the technology, potential radiation dose, and radiographer training requirements, as well as limited understanding of the nature of normal motion.",Combination Therapy Involving Ear Cartilage Transfer and Suture-Button Suspension Arthroplasty for Symptomatic Thumb Carpometacarpal Joint Arthritis.,https://www.ncbi.nlm.nih.gov/pubmed/30941258,Journal of wrist surgery,2019 04 06,"We describe the short-term outcomes of combination therapy involving ear cartilage transfer and suture-button suspension arthroplasty for the treatment of symptomatic thumb carpometacarpal joint arthritis. The concept is to reduce joint arthritis by separate independent approaches, which are renewing the damaged joint surface of the trapezium and first metacarpal bone suspension. Autologous ear cartilage is a desirable material for joint resurfacing arthroplasty without postoperative synovitis or infection, and it is expected to prevent bone impingement or recurrent joint arthritis when postoperative suture-button slack or failure unfortunately occurs.",Comparative Study of Early Health Care Use after Forearm Corrective Osteotomy.,https://www.ncbi.nlm.nih.gov/pubmed/30941254,Journal of wrist surgery,2019 04 06,"Background  Bone reconstruction is frequently required for corrective osteotomy of the forearm long bones. Studies have evaluated long term outcomes but not the impact of these procedures on early postoperative complications and health care utilization. Questions/Purposes  This study evaluated the early postoperative health care utilization following corrective osteotomy of the radius and/or ulna. Patients and Methods  The American College of Surgeons' National Surgical Quality Improvement Program (NSQIP) was the primary data source to perform a comparative statistical analysis of the bone autograft and nonautograft (allograft, graft substitute, or no graft) procedures. We performed a review of the NSQIP database (2005-2013) to evaluate patients who underwent a corrective osteotomy of the radius and/or ulna. Results  There were 362 cases; autograft ( n  = 117) and nonautograft ( n  = 245). There were no significant differences with demographics or comorbidities. The majority of cases were outpatient surgeries and there were no significant differences in anesthesia time, operative time, or hospital length of stay. Overall, the average length of stay was 0.6 days, readmission rate was 2%, and the total complication rate was 1% and there was no statistically significant difference between reconstruction groups. Harvesting of autograft was not associated with the overall 30-day complications and specific markers of health care utilization. Conclusions  Our results are derived from the heterogeneous hospital setting of NSQIP contributing centers. The health care utilization and 30-day complications are low following corrective osteotomy of forearm long bones and autograft harvest did not influence the health care utilization. Level of Evidence  Therapeutic Level II.",Carpal Kinematics following Sequential Scapholunate Ligament Sectioning.,https://www.ncbi.nlm.nih.gov/pubmed/30941252,Journal of wrist surgery,2019 04 06,"Background  The scapholunate ligament (SLL) is the most commonly injured intercarpal ligament of the wrist. It is the primary stabilizer of the scapholunate (SL) joint, but the scaphotrapeziotrapezoid (STT) and radioscaphocapitate (RSC) ligaments may also contribute to SL stability. The contributions of SL joint stabilizers have been reported previously; however, this study aims to examine their contributions to SL stability using a different methodology than previous studies. Purpose  The purpose of this in vitro biomechanical study was to quantify changes in SL kinematics during wrist flexion and extension following a previously untested sequential sectioning series of the SL ligament and secondary stabilizers. Methods  Eight cadaveric upper extremities underwent active wrist flexion and extension in a custom motion wrist simulator. SL kinematics were captured with respect to the distal radius. A five-stage sequential sectioning protocol was performed, with data analyzed from 45-degree wrist flexion to 45-degree wrist extension. Results  Wrist flexion and extension caused the lunate to adopt a more extended posture following sectioning of the SLL and secondary stabilizers compared with the intact state ( p  < 0.009). The isolated disruption to the dorsal portion of the SLL did not result in significant change in lunate kinematics compared with the intact state ( p  > 0.05). Scaphoid kinematics were altered in wrist flexion following sequential sectioning ( p  = 0.013). Additionally, disruption of the primary and secondary stabilizers caused significant change to SL motion in both wrist flexion and wrist extension ( p  < 0.03). Conclusions  The SLL is the primary stabilizer of the SL articulation, with the STT and RSC ligaments playing secondary stabilization roles. Clinical Relevance  Understanding the role primary and secondary SL joint stabilizers may assist in the development of more effective treatment strategies and patient outcomes following SLL injuries."

However, its highly specific role in tumorigenesis in the breast tissue-carriers of BRCA1 mutations are predisposed to life-time risks of up to 80%-relative to many other tissues that remain unaffected, has not yet been fully enlightened. In this article, we have applied a universal model of tissue-specificity of cancer genes to BRCA1 and present a systematic review of proposed concepts classified into 4 categories. Firstly, tissue-specific differences in levels of BRCA1 expression and secondly differences in expression of proteins with redundant functions are outlined. Thirdly, cell-type specific interactions of BRCA1 are presented: its regulation of aromatase, its interaction with Progesterone- and receptor activator of nuclear factor-κB ligand-signaling that controls proliferation of luminal progenitor cells, and its influence on cell differentiation via modulation of the key regulators jagged 1-NOTCH and snail family transcriptional repressor 2. Fourthly, factors specific to the cell-type as well as the environment of the breast tissue are elucidated: distinct frequency of losses of heterozygosity, interaction with X inactivation specific transcript RNA, estrogen-dependent induction of genotoxic metabolites and nuclear factor (erythroid-derived 2)-like 2, and regulation of sirtuin 1. In conclusion, the impact of these concepts on the formation of hormone-sensitive and -insensitive breast tumors is outlined.",Multislice Computed Tomography Assessment of Airway Patency Changes Associated with Mandibular Advancement Appliance Therapy in Supine Patients with Obstructive Sleep Apnea.,https://www.ncbi.nlm.nih.gov/pubmed/30941225,Sleep disorders,2019 04 06,"The purpose of the present study was to measure the regional effects of the mandibular advancement appliance (MAA) on the upper airway of supine subjects with obstructive sleep apnea (OSA) using multislice computed tomography (MSCT). The subjects included 8 males and 5 females who were diagnosed with mild to moderate OSA and were referred to the Orthodontic Clinic of Hiroshima University Hospital, where they underwent MAA therapy. Using a CT scanner, baseline MSCT images were obtained from the subjects without the MAA for morphological analysis, and then the experimental images were obtained while wearing the MAA. To measure the anteroposterior diameter, width, and cross-sectional area of the oropharynx region of interest (ROI), five distance variables were first defined on each multiplanar reconstruction (MPR) image using OsiriX. Additionally, the volumes of the upper airway, bony hard tissue, and soft tissue (soft palate and tongue) in the oro-hypopharyngeal region were measured. In most of the assessed airway size variables, significant increases in the anteroposterior diameter and width were observed after MAA therapy. Regarding the upper airway cross-sectional area, all the upper airway size variables exhibited significant increases. In the volumetric analysis, a significant increase was observed in airway volume, whereas the soft tissue volume in the oro-hypopharyngeal region did not show the significant decrease after MMA therapy. However, from a different point of view, the volumes of the upper airway and soft tissue significantly increased and decreased, respectively, as demonstrated by the calculated ratio for the oro-hypopharyngeal region. We demonstrated that the proportional size of the soft tissue volume, i.e., the soft palate and tongue in the oro-hypopharyngeal region, significantly decreased during use of an MAA. This forward displacement of the soft tissue thereby increases the retroglossal airway space (except the nasopharynx) three-dimensionally.","Seroprevalence of Hepatitis B Virus and Associated Factors among Health Professionals in University of Gondar Hospital, Northwest Ethiopia.",https://www.ncbi.nlm.nih.gov/pubmed/30941224,Advances in preventive medicine,2019 04 06,Hepatitis B virus infection is one of the commonest occupational risks in healthcare workers.

Clinical practice in the clinical placement sites should allow students to apply their theoretical knowledge in a real environment, develop nursing skills and clinical reasoning, and observe and adapt the professional role. This study aimed at identifying the factors influencing performance in clinical practice among preservice diploma nursing students in Northern Tanzania. This study relied on a cross-sectional analysis of data collected from nursing schools in Northern Tanzania in which 208 (123 nursing students and 85 nurse tutors) participants were recruited in the study. Data was gathered using a self-administered questionnaire which collected information on sociodemographic characteristics and factors influencing clinical practice categorized in students' factors, hospital based factors, social-economic factors, and nurse tutors opinions assessed. Descriptive analyses and chi-square test were employed to understand the background information of the sample and association between variables. Majority of the nursing students (84.4%) agreed that clinical placement offers students adequate opportunity for clinical practical learning. Barriers to effective clinical learning was reported by 70.1% of the participants and the barriers include student factors such as lack of self-confidence and absenteeism, school factors such as improper supervision, and poor preparation of clinical instructors or clinical facility factors. We found a significant association between type of barrier and gender (chi-square 0.786, p=0.020). More male nursing students (62.1%) significantly reported unsupportive environment as a barrier and anxiety was more common in female nursing students (48.9%) (p=0.020). Reporting of barriers to effective clinical learning by students from different schools of nursing was not significant (P=0.696). In addition, age of participants did not have significant association with effective clinical practice (p=0.606). Student's factors and placement based factors played an important role to influence clinical learning experiences.

Thus, this study was aimed at examining the characteristics of eplerenone-prescribed hypertensive patients in Japan, describing the combination patterns of antihypertensive medications, and comparing eplerenone's mean doses with respect to concomitant diseases. Data of 160,992 hypertensive patients who used the same drugs for six months or more were collected from an insurance database from January 1, 2009, to December 31, 2013. The number of MRA-receiving patients among the extracted population was 3,274 (2%). Compared to patients on eplerenone or spironolactone, patients on neither drug had fewer comorbidities. Eplerenone was administered in combination with calcium channel blockers and angiotensin II receptor blockers in 23.1% and as monotherapy in 6.6% of cases. The most frequent initial daily dose of eplerenone was 50 mg/day followed by 25 mg/day irrespective of the presence of a comorbidity. MRA use was as low as 2%, but its use was more frequent in patients with comorbidities compared to that of other antihypertensives. Despite studies showing eplerenone's efficacy and safety in high-risk hypertensive patients with albuminuria, the drug is not widely used.",Inactivation of XPF Sensitizes Cancer Cells to Gemcitabine.,https://www.ncbi.nlm.nih.gov/pubmed/30941207,Journal of nucleic acids,2019 04 06,"Gemcitabine (2', 2'-difluorodeoxycytidine; dFdC) is a deoxycytidine analog and is used primarily against pancreatic cancer. The cytotoxicity of gemcitabine is due to the inhibition of DNA replication. However, a mechanism of removal of the incorporated dFdC is largely unknown. In this report, we discovered that nucleotide excision repair protein XPF-ERCC1 participates in the repair of gemcitabine-induced DNA damage and inactivation of XPF sensitizes cells to gemcitabine. Further analysis identified that XPF-ERCC1 functions together with apurinic/apyrimidinic endonuclease (APE) in the repair of gemcitabine-induced DNA damage. Our results demonstrate the importance of the evaluation of DNA repair activities in gemcitabine treatment.",In Vitro Analyses Reveal the Effect of Synthetic Cytokinin Forchlorfenuron (FCF) on a Septin-Like Protein of Taeniid Cysticerci.,https://www.ncbi.nlm.nih.gov/pubmed/30941206,Journal of parasitology research,2019 04 06,"Cytokinin forchlorfenuron (FCF), a synthetic cytokinin, has been used specifically for the characterization of septins. In spite of genomic evidence of their existence, nothing is known about septin filaments in taeniid cestodes. The aim of this work was to determine the presence of a septin-like protein in cysticerci of Taenia crassiceps and Taenia solium using the deduced amino acid sequence of T. solium septin 4 (SEPT4_Tsm), to design and synthesize a derived immunogenic peptide (residues 88 to 103), to prepare a specific rabbit polyclonal antibody, and to examine the effects of FCF at different concentrations and exposure times on an in vitro culture of T. crassiceps cysticerci. In vitro, FCF altered the morphology and motility of T. crassiceps cysticerci, and its effects were reversible under specific concentrations. In addition, we observed by ultrastructural observation that FCF alters the cellular subunit of the protonephridial system of cestodes, where disruption of the axoneme pattern of flame cells was observed. The rabbit polyclonal antibody prepared against the synthetic peptide recognized a major band of 41 kDa in both parasites. Our results establish the importance of SEPT4_Tsm in the dynamics and survival of taeniid cysticerci, as well as their susceptibility to FCF. This is also the first report that a septin is present in the cytoskeleton of taeniids.","Annual Variability of Wing Morphology in Culex sitiens Wiedemann (Diptera, Culicidae) Mosquito Vectors from the Coastal Area of Samut Songkhram Province, Thailand.",https://www.ncbi.nlm.nih.gov/pubmed/30941205,Journal of parasitology research,2019 04 06,"Culex sitiens Wiedemann (Diptera, Culicidae) is a mosquito vector that is found in coastal areas. Effective control of mosquitoes requires knowledge of the biology, ecology, and behavior of the vector as well as of various other aspects, including its morphology. Currently, variations in the wing size and shape of coastal Cx. sitiens have not been described. Here, morphological changes were studied in the wings of Cx. sitiens from a coastal area of Samut Songkhram Province, Thailand. Samples were collected at night (6:00 pm-6:00 am) during single weeks of September in the years 2015-2017 using Center for Disease Control light traps with dry ice as bait. Eighteen landmarks of each individual were selected and digitized for landmark-based geometric morphometric analyses. Wing size variability was estimated using the isometric estimator of centroid size. Wing-shape variables were computed as Procrustes superimposition with residual coordinates of the 18 landmarks following a Generalized Procrustes Analysis and the principal components of residual coordinates. Degrees of wing-shape dissimilarity among individuals were analyzed using discriminant analysis or canonical variate analysis, which was illustrated in a discriminant space of canonical variables. Differences in wing size and shape among populations were calculated using nonparametric permutations based on 1000 runs with Bonferroni correction tests at a p-value of <0.05. The wing sizes and shapes of the mosquitoes differed significantly between observation years in all population groups, as indicated by nonparametric tests (1000 runs) with the Bonferroni correction. Differing rainfall between observation years was related to morphological changes in mosquito populations, presumably reflecting environmental adaptation. Differences in the wing morphology of Cx. sitiens between annual populations reflect adaptation to environmental variables such as rainfall and may affect the potential to act as insect vectors of human disease. These observations may facilitate the development of tools for managing mosquito-borne disease.",The Application of Omics Technologies to Study Axon Regeneration and CNS Repair.,https://www.ncbi.nlm.nih.gov/pubmed/30941204,F1000Research,2019 04 06,"Traumatic brain and spinal cord injuries cause permanent disability.

Already, these technical advances, when combined, are revealing an unprecedented number of novel cellular and molecular targets that could be manipulated alone or in combination to repair the injured central nervous system with precision. In this review, we highlight recent advances in applying these new technologies to the study of axon regeneration and rebuilding of injured neural circuitry. We then discuss the challenges ahead to translate results produced by these technologies into clinical application to help improve the lives of individuals who have a brain or spinal cord injury."

Extract Fermented with a Novel Lactobacillus casei HD-010.,https://www.ncbi.nlm.nih.gov/pubmed/30941192,Evidence-based complementary and alternative medicine : eCAM,2019 04 06,"The purpose of this study was to investigate antihyperlipidemic and antioxidative potentials of onion (Allium cepa L.) extract fermented with a novel Lactobacillus casei HD-010. In general, fermented onion extract is used for its antioxidative activity (ORAC), inhibitory effect on adipocytes differentiation, quercetin contents, and antihyperlipidemic activities. However, the effect of fermented onion extract on hyperlipidemia after oral administration using ApoE-deficient mice has not been reported yet. To understand the effect of fermented onion extract on hyperlipidemia, we used benzafibrate (10 mg/kg, bw/day) as a positive control in the present study. Serum was collected every week to analyze levels of low density lipoprotein (LDL), high density lipoprotein (HDL), triglyceride (TG), and cholesterol, 3-hydroxy-3-methylgutaryi-CoA (HMG-CoA) reductase activity, and cholesterol ester transport protein (CETP) activity. In the fermented onion-treated group, HDL level was significantly increased while levels of TG and LDL were significantly decreased compared to those in the control group. In addition, the inhibition activity of HMG-CoA reductase was increased 20% in the fermented onion-treated group at 100 mg/kg. CETP activity has been observed to be significantly inhibited in the fermented onion-treated groups compared to that in the control group. These results suggest that fermented onion has a preventive/therapeutic effect on hyperlipidemic disease. It might have potential to be developed as a functional food.",Effectiveness of Perioperative Auricular Therapy on Postoperative Pain after Total Hip Arthroplasty: A Systematic Review and Meta-Analysis of Randomised Controlled Trials.,https://www.ncbi.nlm.nih.gov/pubmed/30941191,Evidence-based complementary and alternative medicine : eCAM,2019 04 06,"Auricular therapy (AT) is a conventional therapy in traditional Chinese medicine. However, the effectiveness of perioperative AT in pain treatment after total hip arthroplasty (THA) is still controversial. Nine randomised controlled trials (RCTs) involving 605 patients who have undergone THA with or without AT from inception to March 2018 were collected and included in this study by searching more than 12 databases (e.g., PubMed, Excerpta Medica Database, and Cochrane Library). A random-effects model that pooled seven articles showed that the visual analogue scale (VAS) in the AT group was lower than that of the control group at each postoperative time point in patients after THA, except at the time points of 6 and 36 h. The intraoperative body mass-adjusted fentanyl amount in the AT group was also lower than that of the control group in two trials. The other outcomes (time to first analgesic request and incidence of postoperative nausea and vomiting, perioperative bradycardia, and transitory hypotension) showed insignificant difference. Then, subgroup analysis showed similar results to those of the total articles with the term ""VAS"". Regression analysis found that the prolonged time after the operation decreased the difference in VAS between the two groups. Although all the outcomes were assessed as very low to low in the GRADE system, evidence on the effectiveness of perioperative AT in pain treatment after total hip replacement was positive.",Jian-Pi-Yi-Shen Decoction Relieves Renal Anemia in 5/6 Nephrectomized Rats: Production of Erythropoietin via Hypoxia Inducible Factor Signaling.,https://www.ncbi.nlm.nih.gov/pubmed/30941190,Evidence-based complementary and alternative medicine : eCAM,2019 04 21,"Jian-Pi-Yi-Shen (JPYS) is one of the herbal medicines for treatment of anemic patients with chronic kidney disease (CKD). However, less of scientific evidence to support JPYS involved in treating anemia has been revealed. Here, an animal study was performed to investigate its hematopoietic activities and the underlying mechanism. The 5/6 nephrectomized inductions of CKD anemic rats were randomly divided into two groups: CKD group and JPYS group. Sham-operated rats served as sham group. JPYS (1.36 g/kg/d) was administered orally to CKD rats daily for six consecutive weeks. Results showed that JPYS treatment notably improved renal function and pathological injury in CKD rats. JPYS also restored the hematological parameters, including red blood cells, hemoglobin, and hematocrit. In parallel, the reduction level of EPO was reversed by JPYS. Furthermore, JPYS induced the accumulation of hypoxia inducible factor (HIF)-α protein expression. Collectively, these results provide convincing evidence for JPYS decoction in ameliorating CKD-associated anemia, and its mechanism might be related to regulate EPO production via HIF signaling pathway.",Protective Effects of Evodiamine against LPS-Induced Acute Kidney Injury through Regulation of ROS-NF-κB-Mediated Inflammation.,https://www.ncbi.nlm.nih.gov/pubmed/30941189,Evidence-based complementary and alternative medicine : eCAM,2019 04 06,"Acute kidney injury (AKI) is a critical care syndrome, which is usually associated with sepsis-related endotoxemia. Evodiamine (EVO) is an active ingredient of many traditional medicinal formulations that possess a battery of biological activities. In the study, we aimed to evaluate the potential protective effect of EVO against lipopolysaccharide- (LPS-) induced AKI and cytotoxicity. LPS-resulted pathological injuries were significantly ameliorated by the administration of EVO. EVO reduced the levels of blood urea nitrogen (BUN) and creatinine in LPS-treated rats. EVO also inhibited LPS-induced reduction of cell viability in NRK-52E cells. LPS-resulting increase of TNFα and IL-1β in both serum and kidney of rats and NRK-52E cells was inhibited by EVO. LPS-induced increase of P65 NF-κB expression was markedly inhibited by EVO. EVO-induced reduction of TNFα and IL-1β expression in LPS-treated cells was blocked by overexpression of P65 NF-κB. Moreover, the increase of cell viability in LPS-treated cells induced by EVO was remarkably suppressed by overexpression of P65 NF-κB. LPS-resulting increase of reactive oxygen species (ROS) production was suppressed by EVO. H2O2 suppressed EVO-induced decrease of P65 NF-κB expression and increase of cell viability in LPS-treated NRK-52E cells. Moreover, the antioxidant NAC significantly promoted EVO-induced decrease of P65 NF-κB expression and increase of cell viability in LPS-treated NRK-52E cells. In conclusion, EVO had crucial protective effects against LPS-induced AKI and cytotoxicity through the antioxidant activities and thus the inhibition of inflammation. Our data highlight EVO as a potential candidate for the development of new strategies for the treatment of AKI.","Pharmacological Studies Pertaining to Smooth Muscle Relaxant, Platelet Aggregation Inhibitory and Hypotensive Effects of Ailanthus altissima.",https://www.ncbi.nlm.nih.gov/pubmed/30941187,Evidence-based complementary and alternative medicine : eCAM,2019 04 06,"This in vitro and in vivo study was conducted to rationalize some of traditional medicinal uses of Ailanthus altissima in gastrointestinal, respiratory, and cardiovascular systems.",Chemical Compositions of Metals in Bhasmas and Tibetan Zuotai Are a Major Determinant of Their Therapeutic Effects and Toxicity.,https://www.ncbi.nlm.nih.gov/pubmed/30941186,Evidence-based complementary and alternative medicine : eCAM,2019 04 06,"Minerals are alchemically processed as Bhasmas in Ayurvedic medicines or as Zuotai in Tibetan medicines. Ayurveda is a knowledge system of longevity and considers the mineral elixir made from ""nature"" capable of giving humans perpetual life. Herbo-metallic preparations have a long history in the treatment of various diseases in India, China, and around the world. Their disposition, pharmacology, efficacy, and safety require scientific evaluation. This review discusses the Bhasmas in Ayurvedic medicines and Zuotai in Tibetan medicines for their occurrence, bioaccessibility, therapeutic use, pharmacology, toxicity, and research perspectives. A literature search on Mineral, Bhasma, Ayurvedic medicine, Zuotai, Tibetan medicine, and Metals/metalloids from PubMed, Google and other sources was carried out, and the relevant papers on their traditional use, pharmacology, and toxicity were selected and analyzed. Minerals are processed to form Bhasma or Zuotai to alter their physiochemical properties distinguishing them from environmental metals. The metals found in Ayurveda are mainly from the intentional addition in the form of Bhasma or Zuotai. Bhasma and Zuotai are often used in combination with other herbals and/or animal-based products as mixtures. The advanced technologies are now utilized to characterize herbo-metallic preparations as Quality Assurance/Quality Control. The bioaccessibility, absorption, distribution, metabolism, and elimination of herbo-metallic preparations are different from environmental metals. The pharmacological basis of Bhasma in Ayurveda and Zuotai in Tibetan medicines and their interactions with drugs require scientific research. Although the toxic potentials of Bhasma and Zuotai differ from environmental metals, the metal poisoning case reports, especially lead (Pb), mercury (Hg), and arsenic (As) from inappropriate use of traditional medicines, are increasing, and pharmacovigilance is desired. In risk assessment, chemical forms of metals in Bhasma and Zuotai should be considered for their disposition, efficacy, and toxicity.",Acmella oleracea (L) R. K.

However, currently, there are no studies performed evaluating its effect on embryonic development. Hence, this research aimed to evaluate the effects of the hydroethanolic extract of A. oleracea (EHFAo) on the reproductive performance (parental) and embryonic development (F1 generation) of zebrafish, at concentrations of 50, 100, and 200 μg/L. Histopathology of parental gonads after 21 days of exposure to EHFAo reveals few alterations in the ovaries and testes, not impairing the reproduction; an increase of eggs deposition was observed in animals treated with EHFAo at the highest concentrations. Nevertheless, concerning the embryonic development of F1, teratogenic effects were observed including tail deformation, cardiac and yolk edema, scoliosis, and growth retardation; these alterations were more prominent in the groups born from progenitors exposed to the highest concentrations (100 and 200 μg/L.); but only the occurrence of yolk and cardiac edema had a statistically significant difference when compared to the control group. The chromatographic analysis shows that spilanthol (affinin) was the primary compound found in the EHFAo. Hence, in silico assessment was performed to evaluate the pharmacokinetic and toxicological properties of this molecule and 37 metabolites derived from it. Overall, our data show that the treatment caused no detrimental changes in progenitors regarding their gonads or fertility but caused some potentially teratogenic activity in embryos, which may be due to the action of spilanthol's metabolites M3, M6, M7, M8, M16, M28, and M31.",The Lipodystrophy Syndrome in HIV-Infected Children under Antiretroviral Therapy: A First Report from the Central Africa.,https://www.ncbi.nlm.nih.gov/pubmed/30941184,International journal of pediatrics,2019 04 06,"Despite the high prevalence of the HIV/AIDS, few studies focused on the prevalence of lipodystrophy in pediatric HIV patients on antiretroviral therapy (ARV) in sub-Saharan African countries.

Moreover, in many bacterial species, strong biofilm producer exhibits multidrug resistance. Hence, this study is done to know the antimicrobial susceptibility pattern of Enterococcus spp. and to correlate the drug resistance with biofilm production and esp gene. Enterococcal isolates were collected from various clinical specimens. Antibiotic susceptibility testing was done by disc diffusion, and biofilm production was performed by microtiter plate method. PCR was performed for detection of esp gene. Two E. faecium strains resistant to vancomycin and high-level aminoglycoside (HLAR) were non-biofilm-producers and did not harbor esp gene. However, other biofilm-producing E. faecium harbored esp gene, and this association was found to be statistically significant (p=0.024). It was observed that there was no significant association between biofilm formation and presence of esp gene in E. faecalis. Moreover, a significant correlation was not found between drug resistance and biofilm production in both Enterococcus species. Thus, biofilm formation is not always associated with the presence or absence of esp gene and or drug resistance in Enterococcus spp.",Barriers for Cataract Treatment among Elderly in Sri Lanka.,https://www.ncbi.nlm.nih.gov/pubmed/30941168,Current gerontology and geriatrics research,2019 04 06,"Cataract is still the leading cause of blindness.

However, it is still a challenging task due to the irregular form and confusing boundaries of tumors. Tumor cells thermally represent a heat source; their temperature is high compared to normal brain cells. The main aim of the present paper is to demonstrate that thermal information of brain tumors can be used to reduce false positive and false negative results of segmentation performed in MRI images. Pennes bioheat equation was solved numerically using the finite difference method to simulate the temperature distribution in the brain; Gaussian noises of ±2% were added to the simulated temperatures. Canny edge detector was used to detect tumor contours from the calculated thermal map, as the calculated temperature showed a large gradient in tumor contours. The proposed method is compared to Chan-Vese based level set segmentation method applied to T1 contrast-enhanced and Flair MRI images of brains containing tumors with ground truth. The method is tested in four different phantom patients by considering different tumor volumes and locations and 50 synthetic patients taken from BRATS 2012 and BRATS 2013. The obtained results in all patients showed significant improvement using the proposed method compared to segmentation by level set method with an average of 0.8% of the tumor area and 2.48% of healthy tissue was differentiated using thermal images only. We conclude that tumor contours delineation based on tumor temperature changes can be exploited to reinforce and enhance segmentation algorithms in MRI diagnostic.",Genome-Wide DNA Methylation Analysis of Hypothalamus During the Onset of Puberty in Gilts.,https://www.ncbi.nlm.nih.gov/pubmed/30941164,Frontiers in genetics,2019 04 06,"Although selection of the early age at puberty in gilts will make for a favorable effect on the reproductivity of sow, a large proportion of phenotypic variation in age at puberty of gilts cannot be explained by genetics. Previous studies have implicated hypothalamic DNA methylation in the onset of puberty in mammals. However, the underlying molecular mechanism regarding the regulation of the onset of puberty has remained largely unexplored in gilts. Herein, the genome-scale DNA methylation of hypothalamus was acquired, using the reduced representation bisulfite sequencing, to compare and describe the changes of DNA methylation across Pre-, In- and Post-pubertal gilts. In this study, the average methylation levels of CpGs and CpHs (where H = C, T, or A) in CpG islands- and gene-related regions were gradually decreased in hypothalamic methylomes during the pubertal transition. Comparisons of Pre- vs. In-, In- vs. Post-, and Pre- vs. Post-pubertal stage revealed that there were 85726, 92914, and 100421 differentially methylated CpGs and 5940, 14804, and 16893 differentially methylated CpHs (where H = C, T, or A) in the hypothalamic methylomes. The methylation changes of CpHs were more dynamic than that of CpGs, and methylation changes of CpGs and CpHs were likely to be, respectively, involved in the developmental processes of reproduction and the molecular processes of cellular communications in the hypothalamus. Moreover, methylation changes of CpHs were observed to overrepresent in the quantitative trait loci of age at puberty, and the biological function of these CpH methylation changes was enriched in the pancreas development in gilts. Furthermore, the mRNA levels of several differentially CpG or CpH methylated genes related to the transcription of RNA II polymerase, GnRH signaling pathway, Estrogen signaling pathway, PI3K-AKt signaling pathway, and Insulin signaling pathway, including MAX, MMP2, FGF11, IGF1R, FGF21, and GSK3B, were significantly changed across these pubertal stages in the hypothalamus. These results will help our understanding of how DNA methylation contributes to phenotypic variation of age at puberty.","Analysis of the Epigenome in Multiplex Pre-eclampsia Families Identifies SORD, DGKI, and ICA1 as Novel Candidate Risk Genes.",https://www.ncbi.nlm.nih.gov/pubmed/30941163,Frontiers in genetics,2019 04 06,"Pre-eclampsia is a serious heritable disorder that affects 5-8% of pregnancies worldwide. While classical genetic studies have identified several susceptibility genes they do not fully explain the heritability of pre-eclampsia. An additional contribution to risk can be quantified by examining the epigenome, in particular the methylome, which is a representation of interactions between environmental and genetic influences on the phenotype. Current array-based epigenetic studies only examine 2-5% of the methylome. Here, we used whole-genome bisulfite sequencing (WGBS) to determine the entire methylome of 13 individuals from two multiplex pre-eclampsia families, comprising one woman with eclampsia, six women with pre-eclampsia, four women with uncomplicated normotensive pregnancies and two male relatives. The analysis of WGBS profiles using two bioinformatics platforms, BSmooth and Bismark, revealed 18,909 differentially methylated CpGs and 4157 differentially methylated regions (DMRs) concordant in females. The methylation patterns support the involvement of previously reported candidate genes, including COL4A1, SLC2A4, PER3, FLT1, GPI, LCT, DDAH1, TGFB3, DLX5, and LRP1B. Statistical analysis of DMRs revealed three novel genes significantly correlated with pre-eclampsia: sorbitol dehydrogenase (SORD, p = 9.98 × 10-6), diacylglycerol kinase iota (DGKI, p = 2.52 × 10-5), and islet cell autoantigen 1 (ICA1, 7.54 × 10-3), demonstrating the potential of WGBS in families for elucidating the role of epigenome in pre-eclampsia and other complex diseases.",Polymorphism in Cytochrome P450 3A4 Is Ethnicity Related.,https://www.ncbi.nlm.nih.gov/pubmed/30941162,Frontiers in genetics,2019 04 06,"Can mutations in Cytochrome P450 3A4 (CYP3A4), the major food- and drug-metabolizing enzyme, serve as biomarkers for personalized precise medicine? Classical genetic studies provide only limited data regarding the frequencies of CYP3A4 mutations and their role in food-drug interactions. Here, in an analysis of one large database of 141,456 individuals, we found 856 SNPs (single nucleotide polymorphism), of which 312 are missense mutations, far more than the previously reported dozens. Analyzing the data further, it is demonstrated that the frequency of mutations differs among ethnic groups. Hierarchical clustering divided the mutations to seven groups, each corresponding to a specific ethnicity. To the best of our knowledge this is the first comprehensive analysis of CYP3A4 allele frequencies in distinct ethnic groups. We suggest ethnicity based classification of CYP3A4 SNPs as the first step toward precise diet and medicine. Understanding which and when polymorphism might have clinical significance is a tremendously complex task. Using modeling approach, we could predict changes in the binding poses of ligands in the active site of single variants. These changes might imply clinical effects of the overlooked protein-altering CYP3A4 mutations, by modifying drug metabolism and FDI. It may be concluded that dietary habits, and hence FDI, are matters of ethnicity. Consequently, ethnic-related polymorphism in CYP3A4 and diet may be one underlying mechanism of response to medical regimes. The approaches presented here have the power to highlight mutations of clinical relevance in any gene of interest, thus to complement the arsenal of classic genetic screening tools.",Transcriptome Profile Analysis on Ovarian Tissues of Autotetraploid Fish and Diploid Red Crucian Carp.,https://www.ncbi.nlm.nih.gov/pubmed/30941161,Frontiers in genetics,2019 04 06,"Polyploidization can significantly alter the size of animal gametes. Autotetraploid fish (RRRR, 4nRR = 200) (4nRR) possessing four sets of chromosomes were derived from whole-genome duplication in red crucian carp (RR, 2n = 100) (RCC). The diploid eggs of the 4nRR fish were significantly larger than the eggs of RCC. To explore the differences between the ovaries of these two ploidies of fishes at the molecular level, we compared the ovary transcriptome profiles of 4nRR fish and RCC and identified differentially expressed genes (DEGs). A total of 19,015 unigenes were differentially expressed between 4nRR fish and RCC, including 12,591 upregulated and 6,424 downregulated unigenes in 4nRR fish. Functional analyses revealed that eight genes (CDKL1, AHCY, ARHGEF3, TGFβ, WNT11, CYP27A, GDF7, and CKB) were involved in the regulation of cell proliferation, cell division, gene transcription, ovary development and energy metabolism, suggesting that these eight genes were related to egg size in 4nRR fish and RCC. We validated the expression levels of these eight DEGs in 4nRR fish and RCC using quantitative PCR. The study results provided insights into the regulatory mechanisms underlying the differences in crucian carp egg sizes.",MicroRNAs and Androgen Receptor: Emerging Players in Breast Cancer.,https://www.ncbi.nlm.nih.gov/pubmed/30941159,Frontiers in genetics,2019 04 06,"Breast cancer (BC) is the most common cause of cancer among women, with a high incidence rate occurrence every year worldwide despite advances in its management. BC is characterized by a spectrum of subtypes which respond differently to treatments due to their biological features, representing the main issue in the control of this type of malignancy. Androgen receptor (AR) is emerging as a target to investigate among hormone receptors, since it seems to play a role at various stages of development of specific BC subsets. For this reason, in recent years AR has become very important in the clinical practice, although its role remains controversial. A number of studies have proposed a correlation between microRNAs (miRNAs), a class of gene expression modulators, and AR in prostate cancer (PC), but there are still few evidences about the relationship between miRNAs and AR in BC. The purpose of this review is to present a state of the art scenario with consideration to the most recent discoveries about miRNAs involved in the AR associated pathogenesis of BC, in order to provide new insights into the role of miRNAs as key drivers in the modulation of AR, and possible actors in the development and progression of BC. Moreover, we consider findings about involvement of AR signaling in all stages of BC, highlighting its association with different subsets of breast carcinomas and with pre- and postmenopausal state of patients."

Inhibition of PRMT5, the major Type II arginine methyltransferase, suppresses pathogenic T cell responses and EAE. PRMT5 is transiently induced in proliferating memory inflammatory Th1 cells and during EAE. However, the mechanisms driving PRMT5 protein induction and repression as T cells expand and return to resting is currently unknown. Here, we used naive mouse and memory mouse and human Th1/Th2 cells as models to identify mechanisms controlling PRMT5 protein expression in initial and recall T cell activation. Initial activation of naive mouse T cells resulted in NF-κB-dependent transient Prmt5 transcription and NF-κB, mTOR and MYC-dependent PRMT5 protein induction. In murine memory Th cells, transcription and miRNA loss supported PRMT5 induction to a lesser extent than in naive T cells. In contrast, NF-κB/MYC/mTOR-dependent non-transcriptional PRMT5 induction played a major role. These results highlight the importance of the NF-κB/mTOR/MYC axis in PRMT5-driven pathogenic T cell expansion and may guide targeted therapeutic strategies for MS.",Foxp3+ Regulatory and Conventional CD4+ T Cells Display Similarly High Frequencies of Alloantigen-Reactive Cells.,https://www.ncbi.nlm.nih.gov/pubmed/30941146,Frontiers in immunology,2019 04 06,"Foxp3+ regulatory T cells (Tregs) play a major role in acquired immune tolerance to allogenic transplants. Their suppressive activity is thought to require T cell receptor (TCR)-driven antigen recognition; little, however, is known about the fraction of Tregs able to recognize alloantigens within this T cell subset primarily educated against self-antigens. Performing transfer experiments of Tregs or conventional T cells (Tconv) into both lymphoreplete and lymphopenic mice, we observed a similarly high proportion of cells signaling through their TCR and proliferating in allogenic hosts. Furthermore, using an in vivo proliferation assay with limited T cell numbers infused into lymphopenic mice, we found that the overall frequency of alloreactive Tregs was similar if not higher to that of alloreactive Tconv. Overall our study highlights a noticeably high level of alloreactive Foxp3+ regulatory T cells accounting for their predominant role in transplantation tolerance.",Bioinformatics Analyses Determined the Distinct CNS and Peripheral Surrogate Biomarker Candidates Between Two Mouse Models for Progressive Multiple Sclerosis.,https://www.ncbi.nlm.nih.gov/pubmed/30941144,Frontiers in immunology,2019 04 06,"Previously, we have established two distinct progressive multiple sclerosis (MS) models by induction of experimental autoimmune encephalomyelitis (EAE) with myelin oligodendrocyte glycoprotein (MOG) in two mouse strains. A.SW mice develop ataxia with antibody deposition, but no T cell infiltration, in the central nervous system (CNS), while SJL/J mice develop paralysis with CNS T cell infiltration. In this study, we determined biomarkers contributing to the homogeneity and heterogeneity of two models. Using the CNS and spleen microarray transcriptome and cytokine data, we conducted computational analyses. We identified up-regulation of immune-related genes, including immunoglobulins, in the CNS of both models. Pro-inflammatory cytokines, interferon (IFN)-γ and interleukin (IL)-17, were associated with the disease progression in SJL/J mice, while the expression of both cytokines was detected only at the EAE onset in A.SW mice. Principal component analysis (PCA) of CNS transcriptome data demonstrated that down-regulation of prolactin may reflect disease progression. Pattern matching analysis of spleen transcriptome with CNS PCA identified 333 splenic surrogate markers, including Stfa2l1, which reflected the changes in the CNS. Among them, we found that two genes (PER1/MIR6883 and FKBP5) and one gene (SLC16A1/MCT1) were also significantly up-regulated and down-regulated, respectively, in human MS peripheral blood, using data mining.",The MRZ-Reaction and Specific Autoantibody Detection for Differentiation of ANA-Positive Multiple Sclerosis From Rheumatic Diseases With Cerebral Involvement.,https://www.ncbi.nlm.nih.gov/pubmed/30941143,Frontiers in immunology,2019 04 06,"Objective: Rheumatic diseases with involvement of the central nervous system (RDwCNS) may mimic multiple sclerosis (MS). Inversely, up to 60% of MS-patients have antinuclear autoantibodies (ANAs) and may be misdiagnosed as RDwCNS. The detection of antibodies against extractable nuclear antigens (ENA) and oligoclonal bands (OCB) are established valuable diagnostic tools in the differential diagnosis of RDwCNS and MS. The MRZ-reaction (MRZR) is defined by three antibody indices (AIs) against neurotropic viruses and is frequently positive in MS. To investigate the added value of MRZR combined with testing for antibodies against ENAs and OCB detection to distinguish RDwCNS from ANA positive MS. Methods: MRZR was evaluated in RDwCNS (n = 40) and 68 ANA positive MS-patients. Two stringency levels, MRZR-1 and MRZR-2 (at least one respectively two of three AIs positive) were applied. Autoantibody testing included ANA plus ENA and anti-dsDNA antibodies, antiphospholipid antibodies, and anti-neutrophil cytoplasmic antibodies. Results: Most of the RDwCNS patients (n = 32; 80%) suffered from systemic lupus erythematosus. Within the RDwCNS group 20% had a positive MRZR-1 and 8.5% a positive MRZR-2 compared to 80.9 and 60%, respectively within the MS-group (p < 0.0001 for both comparisons). Oligoclonal bands were found in 28.6% of the RDwCNS patients and 94.3% of the MS-patients (p < 0.0001). Conversely, autoantibodies to specific nuclear antigens or phospholipids were found more frequently in RDwCNS. A positive MRZR in conjunction with the absence of ENA autoantibodies distinguished MS from RDwCNS with high specificity (97.5%). Conclusions: We suggest combining MRZR, OCBs, and specific autoantibody diagnostics to differentiate RDwCNS from MS.",The Role of T Cells in Herpes Stromal Keratitis.,https://www.ncbi.nlm.nih.gov/pubmed/30941142,Frontiers in immunology,2019 04 06,"The blinding inflammatory lesion stromal keratitis (SK), which occurs in some patients in response to ocular herpes simplex virus (HSV) infection, represents mainly an immune cell mediated inflammatory response to the virus infection. The principal orchestrators of the immunopathological lesions are T cells although additional events participate that include the extent of recruitment of non-lymphoid cells, the extent of neoangiogenesis, and the extent of damage to nerve function. This review focuses on evidence that the balance of the functional subsets of T cells has a major impact on lesion severity and duration. Accordingly, if proinflammatory Th1 and Th17 CD4 T cells, and perhaps in some cases CD8 T cells, predominate lesions occur earlier and are more severe. Lesions are diminished when cells with regulatory function predominate. Moreover, when regulatory cells acquire the property to produce Amphiregulin this may facilitate lesion resolution. An objective to controlling lesions is to learn how to manipulate the balance of T cells to favor the representation and function of regulatory T cells and their products over proinflammatory cells. In this review we emphasize how exploiting the differential metabolic requirements of immune cells could be a valuable approach to control SK.",A Pathogenic Role for Splenic B1 Cells in SIV Disease Progression in Rhesus Macaques.,https://www.ncbi.nlm.nih.gov/pubmed/30941141,Frontiers in immunology,2019 04 06,"B1 cells spontaneously produce protective natural antibodies which provide the first line of defense against a variety of pathogens. Although these natural antibodies share similar autoreactive features with several HIV-1 broadly neutralizing antibodies, the role of B1 cells in HIV/SIV disease progression is unknown. We report the presence of human-like B1 cells in rhesus macaques. During chronic SIV infection, we found that the frequency of splenic CD11b+ B1 cells positively correlated with plasma SIV viral load and exhausted T cells. Mechanistically, we discovered that splenic CD11b+ B1 cells express PD-L2 and IL-10, and were able to induce PD-1 upregulation on CD4+ T cells in vitro. These findings suggest that splenic CD11b+ B1 cells may contribute to the regulation of SIV plasma viral load by enhancing T cell exhaustion. Therefore, understanding the mechanisms that govern their function in rhesus macaques may lead to novel therapeutic strategies for impeding HIV/SIV disease progression.",Identification of a Consolidation Phase in Immunological Memory.,https://www.ncbi.nlm.nih.gov/pubmed/30941140,Frontiers in immunology,2019 04 06,"Long lasting antibody responses and immunological memory are the desired outcomes of vaccination. In general, multiple vaccine doses result in enhanced immune responses, a notable exception being booster-induced hyporesponsiveness, which has been observed with polysaccharide and glycoconjugate vaccines. In this study, we analyzed the effect of early booster doses of multimeric protein vaccine (1-11)E2 on recall memory to B epitope 1-11 of β-amyloid. Mice immunized with a single dose of (1-11)E2 stochastically display, when immunized with a recall dose 9 months later, either memory, i.e., an enhanced response to epitope 1-11, or hyporesponsiveness, i.e., a reduced response. Memory is the most common outcome, achieved by 80% of mice. We observed that a booster dose of vaccine (1-11)E2 at day 15 significantly reduced the ratio between the magnitude of the secondary and primary response, causing an increase of hyporesponsive mice. This booster-dependent disruption of recall memory only occurred in a limited time window: a booster dose at day 21 had no significant effect on the ratio between the secondary and primary response magnitude. Thus, this study identifies a consolidation phase in immunological memory, that is a time window during which the formation of memory is vulnerable, and a disrupting stimulus reduces the probability that memory is achieved.",Ectonucleotidases in Intestinal and Hepatic Inflammation.,https://www.ncbi.nlm.nih.gov/pubmed/30941139,Frontiers in immunology,2019 04 06,"Purinergic signaling modulates systemic and local inflammatory responses. Extracellular nucleotides, including eATP, promote inflammation, at least in part via the inflammasome upon engagement of P2 purinergic receptors. In contrast, adenosine generated during eATP phosphohydrolysis by ectonucleotidases, triggers immunosuppressive/anti-inflammatory pathways. Mounting evidence supports the role of ectonucleotidases, especially ENTPD1/CD39 and CD73, in the control of several inflammatory conditions, ranging from infectious disease, organ fibrosis to oncogenesis. Our experimental data generated over the years have indicated both CD39 and CD73 serve as pivotal regulators of intestinal and hepatic inflammation. In this context, immune cell responses are regulated by the balance between eATP and adenosine, potentially impacting disease outcomes as in gastrointestinal infection, inflammatory bowel disease, ischemia reperfusion injury of the bowel and liver, autoimmune or viral hepatitis and other inflammatory conditions, such as cancer. In this review, we report the most recent discoveries on the role of ENTPD1/CD39, CD73, and other ectonucleotidases in the regulation of intestinal and hepatic inflammation. We discuss the present knowledge, highlight the most intriguing and promising experimental data and comment on important aspects that still need to be addressed to develop purinergic-based therapies for these important illnesses.",What Are the Peripheral Blood Determinants for Increased Osteoclast Formation in the Various Inflammatory Diseases Associated With Bone Loss?,https://www.ncbi.nlm.nih.gov/pubmed/30941138,Frontiers in immunology,2019 04 06,"Local priming of osteoclast precursors (OCp) has long been considered the main and obvious pathway that takes place in the human body, where local bone lining cells and RANKL-expressing osteocytes may facilitate the differentiation of OCp. However, priming of OCp away from bone, such as in inflammatory tissues, as revealed in peripheral blood, may represent a second pathway, particularly relevant in individuals who suffer from systemic bone loss such as prevalent in inflammatory diseases. In this review, we used a systematic approach to review the literature on osteoclast formation in peripheral blood in patients with inflammatory diseases associated with bone loss. Only studies that compared inflammatory (bone) disease with healthy controls in the same study were included. Using this core collection, it becomes clear that experimental osteoclastogenesis using peripheral blood from patients with bone loss diseases in prevalent diseases such as rheumatoid arthritis, osteoporosis, periodontitis, and cancer-related osteopenia unequivocally point toward an intrinsically increased osteoclast formation and activation. In particular, such increased osteoclastogenesis already takes place without the addition of the classical osteoclastogenesis cytokines M-CSF and RANKL in vitro. We show that T-cells and monocytes as OCp are the minimal demands for such unstimulated osteoclast formation. In search for common and disease-specific denominators of the diseases with inflammation-driven bone loss, we demonstrate that altered T-cell activity and a different composition-such as the CD14+CD16+ vs. CD14+CD16- monocytes-and priming of OCp with increased M-CSF, RANKL, and TNF- α levels in peripheral blood play a role in increased osteoclast formation and activity. Future research will likely uncover the barcodes of the OCp in the various inflammatory diseases associated with bone loss.",The Emerging Role of Complement Proteins as a Target for Therapy of IgA Nephropathy.,https://www.ncbi.nlm.nih.gov/pubmed/30941137,Frontiers in immunology,2019 04 06,"IgA nephropathy (IgAN) is the most common form of primary glomerulonephritis worldwide and a common cause of end-stage renal disease. Evaluation of a kidney biopsy is necessary for diagnosis, with routine immunofluorescence microscopy revealing dominant or co-dominant IgA immunodeposits usually with complement C3 and sometimes IgG and/or IgM. IgA nephropathy reduces life expectancy by more than 10 years and leads to kidney failure in 20-40% of patients within 20 years of diagnosis. There is accumulating clinical, genetic, and biochemical evidence that complement plays an important role in the pathogenesis of IgA nephropathy. The presence of C3 differentiates the diagnosis of IgA nephropathy from the subclinical deposition of glomerular IgA. Markers for the activation of the alternative and mannan-binding lectin (MBL) pathways in renal-biopsy specimens are associated with disease activity and portend a worse renal outcome. Complement proteins in the circulation have also been evaluated in IgA nephropathy and found to be of prognostic value. Recently, genetic studies have identified IgA nephropathy-associated loci. Within these loci are genes encoding products involved in complement regulation and interaction with immune complexes. Put together, these data identify the complement cascade as a rational treatment target for this chronic kidney disease. Recent case reports on the successful use of humanized anti-C5 monoclonal antibody eculizumab are consistent with this hypothesis, but a better understanding of the role of complement in IgA nephropathy is needed to guide future therapeutic interventions."

Tumor cells can hijack these protective mechanisms to enable immune escape, cancer survival and proliferation. Blocking antibodies, designed to interfere with checkpoint molecules CTLA-4 and PD-1/PD-L1 and counteract these immune suppressive mechanisms, have shown significant success in promoting immune responses against cancer and can result in tumor regression in many patients. While inhibitors to CTLA-4 and the PD-1/PD-L1 axis are well-established for the clinical management of melanoma, many patients do not respond or develop resistance to these interventions. Concerted efforts have focused on combinations of approved therapies aiming to further augment positive outcomes and survival. While CTLA-4 and PD-1 are the most-extensively researched targets, results from pre-clinical studies and clinical trials indicate that novel agents, specific for checkpoints such as A2AR, LAG-3, IDO and others, may further contribute to the improvement of patient outcomes, most likely in combinations with anti-CTLA-4 or anti-PD-1 blockade. This review discusses the rationale for, and results to date of, the development of inhibitory immune checkpoint blockade combination therapies in melanoma.

The study was publicly registered at Chinese Clinical Trial Registry, www.chictr.org.cn(ChiCTR-ICR-15005775). Method: Autologous peripheral blood mononuclear cells were co-cultured with HLA-A02 restricted HIV antigen epitopes peptides to produce cell product for this therapy. The trial was divided into five time-points with the same interval period for infusion of the cell products or monitoring parameters. Symptoms, vital signs, and blood samples were collected to analyze the safety and efficacy of this therapy. Results: Two cases of adverse effects happened during this trial in test group, which recovered without medical intervention. There was no severe adverse effect that occurred. Both symptoms and laboratory tests have no statistical significant difference between test and control group. Flowcytometry analysis showed the expression of the PD-1 and CD95 molecule on the cell surface were downregulated post-treatment in the test group. Conclusions: This autologous HIV-antigen specific effector CD8+ T cellular therapy was safe.

It has been suggested that P. salmonis is able to survive in host macrophages, localized within a vacuole like-compartment which prevents lysosomal degradation. However, the relevant aspects of the pathogenesis of P. salmonis as the host modulation that allow its intracellular survival have been poorly characterized. In this study, we evaluated the role of lysosomes in the response to P. salmonis infection in macrophage-enriched cell cultures established from Atlantic salmon head kidneys. Bacterial infection was confirmed using confocal microscopy. A gentamicin protection assay was performed to recover intracellular bacteria and the 16S rDNA copy number was quantified through quantitative polymerase chain reaction in order to determine the replication of P. salmonis within macrophages. Lysosomal activity in Atlantic salmon macrophage-enriched cell cultures infected with P. salmonis was evaluated by analyzing the lysosomal pH and proteolytic ability through confocal microscopy. The results showed that P. salmonis can survive ≥120 h in Atlantic salmon macrophage-enriched cell cultures, accompanied by an increase in the detection of the 16S rDNA copy number/cell. The latter finding suggests that P. salmonis also replicates in Atlantic salmon macrophage-enriched cell cultures. Moreover, this bacterial survival and replication appears to be favored by a perturbation of the lysosomal degradation system. We observed a modulation in the total number of lysosomes and lysosomal acidification following infection with P. salmonis. Collectively, the results of this study showed that infection of Atlantic salmon macrophages with P. salmonis induced limited lysosomal response which may be associated with host immune evasion mechanisms of P. salmonis that have not been previously reported.","Differential Targeting of c-Maf, Bach-1, and Elmo-1 by microRNA-143 and microRNA-365 Promotes the Intracellular Growth of Mycobacterium tuberculosis in Alternatively IL-4/IL-13 Activated Macrophages.",https://www.ncbi.nlm.nih.gov/pubmed/30941122,Frontiers in immunology,2019 04 06,"Mycobacterium tuberculosis (Mtb) can subvert the host defense by skewing macrophage activation toward a less microbicidal alternative activated state to avoid classical effector killing functions. Investigating the molecular basis of this evasion mechanism could uncover potential candidates for host directed therapy against tuberculosis (TB). A limited number of miRNAs have recently been shown to regulate host-mycobacterial interactions. Here, we performed time course kinetics experiments on bone marrow-derived macrophages (BMDMs) and human monocyte-derived macrophages (MDMs) alternatively activated with IL-4, IL-13, or a combination of IL-4/IL-13, followed by infection with Mtb clinical Beijing strain HN878. MiR-143 and miR-365 were highly induced in Mtb-infected M(IL-4/IL-13) BMDMs and MDMs. Knockdown of miR-143 and miR-365 using antagomiRs decreased the intracellular growth of Mtb HN878, reduced the production of IL-6 and CCL5 and promoted the apoptotic death of Mtb HN878-infected M(IL-4/IL-13) BMDMs. Computational target prediction identified c-Maf, Bach-1 and Elmo-1 as potential targets for both miR-143 and miR-365. Functional validation using luciferase assay, RNA-pulldown assay and Western blotting revealed that c-Maf and Bach-1 are directly targeted by miR-143 while c-Maf, Bach-1, and Elmo-1 are direct targets of miR-365. Knockdown of c-Maf using GapmeRs promoted intracellular Mtb growth when compared to control treated M(IL-4/IL-13) macrophages. Meanwhile, the blocking of Bach-1 had no effect and blocking Elmo-1 resulted in decreased Mtb growth. Combination treatment of M(IL-4/IL-13) macrophages with miR-143 mimics or miR-365 mimics and c-Maf, Bach-1, or Elmo-1 gene-specific GapmeRs restored Mtb growth in miR-143 mimic-treated groups and enhanced Mtb growth in miR-365 mimics-treated groups, thus suggesting the Mtb growth-promoting activities of miR-143 and miR-365 are mediated at least partially through interaction with c-Maf, Bach-1, and Elmo-1. We further show that knockdown of miR-143 and miR-365 in M(IL-4/IL-13) BMDMs decreased the expression of HO-1 and IL-10 which are known targets of Bach-1 and c-Maf, respectively, with Mtb growth-promoting activities in macrophages. Altogether, our work reports a host detrimental role of miR-143 and miR-365 during Mtb infection and highlights for the first time the role and miRNA-mediated regulation of c-Maf, Bach-1, and Elmo-1 in Mtb-infected M(IL-4/IL-13) macrophages.","Adipose Tissue in Persons With HIV Is Enriched for CD4+ T Effector Memory and T Effector Memory RA+ Cells, Which Show Higher CD69 Expression and CD57, CX3CR1, GPR56 Co-expression With Increasing Glucose Intolerance.",https://www.ncbi.nlm.nih.gov/pubmed/30941121,Frontiers in immunology,2019 04 06,"Chronic T cell activation and accelerated immune senescence are hallmarks of HIV infection, which may contribute to the increased risk of cardiometabolic diseases in people living with HIV (PLWH).

SAT was collected by liposuction and T cells were extracted by collagenase digestion. The proportion of naïve (TNai) CD45RO-CCR7+, effector memory (TEM) CD45RO+CCR7-, central memory (TCM) CD45RO+CCR7+, and effector memory revertant RA+(TEMRA) CD45RO-CCR7- CD4+ and CD8+ T cells were measured by flow cytometry. CD4+ and CD8+ TEM and TEMRA were significantly enriched in SAT of PLWH compared to blood. The proportions of SAT CD4+ and CD8+ memory subsets were similar across metabolic status categories in the PLWH, but CD4+ T cell expression of the CD69 early-activation and tissue residence marker, particularly on TEM cells, increased with progressive glucose intolerance. Use of t-distributed Stochastic Neighbor Embedding (t-SNE) identified a separate group of predominantly CD69lo TEM and TEMRA cells co-expressing CD57, CX3CR1, and GPR56, which were significantly greater in diabetics compared to non-diabetics. Expression of the CX3CR1 and GPR56 markers indicate these TEM and TEMRA cells may have anti-viral specificity. Compared to HIV-negative controls, SAT from PLWH had an increased CD8:CD4 ratio, but the distribution of CD4+ and CD8+ memory subsets was similar irrespective of HIV status. Finally, whole adipose tissue from PLWH had significantly higher expression of TLR2, TLR8, and multiple chemokines potentially relevant to immune cell homing compared to HIV-negative controls with similar glucose tolerance.",Abrogation of Endogenous Glycolipid Antigen Presentation on Myelin-Laden Macrophages by D-Sphingosine Ameliorates the Pathogenesis of Experimental Autoimmune Encephalomyelitis.,https://www.ncbi.nlm.nih.gov/pubmed/30941120,Frontiers in immunology,2019 04 06,"Background: Although myelin is composed of mostly lipids, the pathological role of myelin lipids in demyelinating diseases remains elusive. The principal lipid of the myelin sheath is β-galactosylceramide (β-Galcer). Its α-anomer (α-Galcer) has been demonstrated to be antigenically presented by macrophages via CD1d, a MHC class I-like molecule. Myelin, which is mostly composed of β-Galcer, has been long considered as an immunologically-inert neuron insulator, because the antigen-binding cleft of CD1d is highly α-form-restricted. Results: Here, we report that CD1d-mediated antigenic presentation of myelin-derived galactosylceramide (Mye-GalCer) by macrophages contributed significantly to the progression of experimental autoimmune encephalomyelitis (EAE). Surprisingly, this presentation was recognizable by α-Galcer:CD1d-specific antibody (clone L363), but incapable of triggering expansion of iNKT cells and production of iNKT signature cytokines (IFNγ and IL-4). Likewise, a synthesized analog of Mye-Galcer, fluorinated α-C-GalCer (AA2), while being efficiently presented via CD1d on macrophages, failed to stimulate production of IFNγ and IL-4. However, AA2 significantly exacerbated EAE progression. Further analyses revealed that the antigenic presentations of both Mye-GalCer and its analog (AA2) in α-form via CD1d promoted IL-17 production from T cells, leading to elevated levels of IL-17 in EAE spinal cords and sera. The IL-17 neutralizing antibody significantly reduced the severity of EAE symptoms in AA2-treated mice. Furthermore, D-sphingosine, a lipid possessing the same hydrophobic base as ceramide but without a carbohydrate residue, efficiently blocked this glycolipid antigen presentation both in vitro and in spinal cords of EAE mice, and significantly decreased IL-17 and ameliorated the pathological symptoms. Conclusion: Our findings reveal a novel pathway from the presentation of Mye-GalCer to IL-17 production, and highlight the promising therapeutic potential of D-sphingosine for the human disorder of multiple sclerosis.","Anti-TNF Therapy in Spondyloarthritis and Related Diseases, Impact on the Immune System and Prediction of Treatment Responses.",https://www.ncbi.nlm.nih.gov/pubmed/30941119,Frontiers in immunology,2019 04 06,"Immune-mediated inflammatory diseases (IMIDs), such as spondyloarthritis (SpA), psoriasis, Crohn's disease (CD), and rheumatoid arthritis (RA) remain challenging illnesses. They often strike at a young age and cause lifelong morbidity, representing a considerable burden for the affected individuals and society. Pioneering studies have revealed the presence of a TNF-dependent proinflammatory cytokine cascade in several IMIDs, and the introduction of anti-TNF therapy 20 years ago has proven effective to reduce inflammation and clinical symptoms in RA, SpA, and other IMID, providing unprecedented clinical benefits and a valid alternative in case of failure or intolerable adverse effects of conventional disease-modifying antirheumatic drugs (DMARDs, for RA) or non-steroidal anti-inflammatory drugs (NSAIDs, for SpA). However, our understanding of how TNF inhibitors (TNFi) affect the immune system in patients is limited. This question is relevant because anti-TNF therapy has been associated with infectious complications. Furthermore, clinical efficacy of TNFi is limited by a high rate of non-responsiveness (30-40%) in RA, SpA, and other IMID, exposing a substantial fraction of patients to side-effects without clinical benefit. Despite the extensive use of TNFi, it is still not possible to determine which patients will respond to TNFi before treatment initiation. The recent introduction of antibodies blocking IL-17 has expanded the therapeutic options for SpA, as well as psoriasis and psoriatic arthritis. It is therefore essential to develop tools to guide treatment decisions for patients affected by SpA and other IMID, both to optimize clinical care and contain health care costs. After a brief overview of the biology of TNF, its receptors and currently used TNFi in the clinics, we summarize the progress that has been made to increase our understanding of the action of TNFi on the immune system in patients. We then summarize efforts dedicated to identify biomarkers that can predict treatment responses to TNFi and we conclude with a section dedicated to the recently introduced inhibitors of IL-17A and IL-23 in SpA and related diseases. The focus of this review is on SpA, however, we also refer to RA on topics for which only limited information is available on SpA in the literature.",Clinical and Immunological Phenotype of Patients With Primary Immunodeficiency Due to Damaging Mutations in NFKB2.,https://www.ncbi.nlm.nih.gov/pubmed/30941118,Frontiers in immunology,2019 04 06,"Non-canonical NF-κB-pathway signaling is integral in immunoregulation. Heterozygous mutations in NFKB2 have recently been established as a molecular cause of common variable immunodeficiency (CVID) and DAVID-syndrome, a rare condition combining deficiency of anterior pituitary hormone with CVID. Here, we investigate 15 previously unreported patients with primary immunodeficiency (PID) from eleven unrelated families with heterozygous NFKB2-mutations including eight patients with the common p.Arg853* nonsense mutation and five patients harboring unique novel C-terminal truncating mutations. In addition, we describe the clinical phenotype of two patients with proximal truncating mutations. Cohort analysis extended to all 35 previously published NFKB2-cases revealed occurrence of early-onset PID in 46/50 patients (mean age of onset 5.9 years, median 4.0 years). ACTH-deficiency occurred in 44%. Three mutation carriers have deceased, four developed malignancies. Only two mutation carriers were clinically asymptomatic. In contrast to typical CVID, most patients suffered from early-onset and severe disease manifestations, including clinical signs of T cell dysfunction e.g., chronic-viral or opportunistic infections. In addition, 80% of patients suffered from (predominately T cell mediated) autoimmune (AI) phenomena (alopecia > various lymphocytic organ-infiltration > diarrhea > arthritis > AI-cytopenia). Unlike in other forms of CVID, auto-antibodies or lymphoproliferation were not common hallmarks of disease. Immunophenotyping showed largely normal or even increased quantities of naïve and memory CD4+ or CD8+ T-cells and normal T-cell proliferation. NK-cell number and function were also normal. In contrast, impaired B-cell differentiation and hypogammaglobinemia were consistent features of NFKB2-associated disease. In addition, an array of lymphocyte subpopulations, such as regulatory T cell, Th17-, cTFH-, NKT-, and MAIT-cell numbers were decreased. We conclude that heterozygous damaging mutations in NFKB2 represent a distinct PID entity exceeding the usual clinical spectrum of CVID. Impairment of the non-canonical NF-κB pathways affects function and differentiation of numerous lymphocyte-subpopulations and thus causes a heterogeneous, more severe form of PID phenotype with early-onset. Further characteristic features are multifaceted, primarily T cell-mediated autoimmunity, such as alopecia, lymphocytic organ infiltration, and in addition frequently ACTH-deficiency.",Oxidant-Sensing Pathways in the Responses of Fungal Pathogens to Chemical Stress Signals.,https://www.ncbi.nlm.nih.gov/pubmed/30941117,Frontiers in microbiology,2019 04 06,"Host defenses expose fungal pathogens to oxidants and antimicrobial chemicals. The fungal cell employs conserved eukaryotic signaling pathways and dedicated transcription factors to program its response to these stresses. The oxidant-sensitive transcription factor of yeast, YAP1, and its orthologs in filamentous fungi, are central to tolerance to oxidative stress. The C-terminal domain of YAP1 contains cysteine residues that, under oxidizing conditions, form an intramolecular disulfide bridge locking the molecule in a conformation where the nuclear export sequence is masked. YAP1 accumulates in the nucleus, promoting transcription of genes that provide the cell with the ability to counteract oxidative stress. Chemicals including xenobiotics and plant signals can also promote YAP1 nuclearization in yeast and filamentous fungi. This could happen via direct or indirect oxidative stress, or by a different biochemical pathway. Plant phenolics are known antioxidants, yet they have been shown to elicit cellular responses that would usually be triggered to counter oxidant stress. Here we will discuss the evidence that YAP1 and MAPK pathways respond to phenolic compounds. Following this and other examples, we explore here how oxidative-stress sensing networks of fungi might have evolved to detect chemical stressors. Furthermore, we draw functional parallels between fungal YAP1 and mammalian Keap1-Nrf2 signaling systems."

Several of them are frequent commensals of the human microbiota but are also able to cause a variety of opportunistic infections, especially when the human host becomes immunocompromised. By far, most of the research to understand the molecular underpinnings of the pathogenesis of these species has focused on Candida albicans, the most virulent member of the genus. However, epidemiological data indicates that related Candida species are also clinically important. Here, we describe the generation of a set of strains and plasmids to genetically modify C. dubliniensis and C. tropicalis, the two pathogenic species most closely related to C. albicans. C. dubliniensis is an ideal model to understand C. albicans pathogenesis since it is the closest species to C. albicans but considerably less virulent. On the other hand, C. tropicalis is ranked among the four most common causes of infections by Candida species. Given that C. dubliniensis and C. tropicalis are obligate diploids with no known conventional sexual cycle, we generated strains that are auxotrophic for at least two amino acids which allows the tandem deletion of both alleles of a gene by complementing the two auxotrophies. The strains were generated in two different genetic backgrounds for each species - one for which the genomic sequence is available and a second clinically important one. In addition, we have adapted plasmids developed to delete genes and epitope/fluorophore tag proteins in C. albicans so that they can be employed in C. tropicalis. The tools generated here allow for efficient genetic modification of C. dubliniensis and C. tropicalis, and thus facilitate the study of the molecular basis of pathogenesis in these medically relevant fungi.","Past, Present, and Future Strategies for Enhanced Assessment of Embryo's Genome and Reproductive Competence in Women of Advanced Reproductive Age.",https://www.ncbi.nlm.nih.gov/pubmed/30941103,Frontiers in endocrinology,2019 04 06,"Recent advancements in genomic analysis allow testing of an increasing number of genetic features in human preimplantation embryos.

However, little is known about how these storage carbohydrates are utilized. To address this question, the effects of bombyxin-II injection into Bombyx larvae on the tissue lipid level, respiration rate, and glycolytic activity of tissues were investigated. Bombyxin-II did not affect lipid accumulation in the hemolymph and fat body, while it increased the rate of oxygen consumption and increased the content of fructose 2, 6-bisphosphate, a potent activator of glycolysis, in the gonads, imaginal discs, and midgut. These results suggest that bombyxin facilitates cellular energy production thereby supporting the tissue growth of insects.",Should We Assess Pituitary Function in Children After a Mild Traumatic Brain Injury? A Prospective Study.,https://www.ncbi.nlm.nih.gov/pubmed/30941101,Frontiers in endocrinology,2019 04 06,"Objective: The aim of this study was to evaluate the frequency of hypopituitarism following TBI in a cohort of children who had been hospitalized for mild TBI and to identify the predictive factors for this deficiency. Design: A prospective study was conducted on children between 2 and 16 years of age who had been hospitalized for mild TBI according to the Glasgow Coma Scale between September 2009 and June 2013. Clinical parameters, basal pituitary hormone assessment at 0, 6, and 12 months, as well as a dynamic testing (insulin tolerance test) 12 months after TBI were performed. Results: The study included 109 children, the median age was 8.5 years. Patients were examined 6 months (n = 99) and 12 months (n = 96) after TBI. Somatotropic deficiency (defined by a GH peak <20 mUI/l in two tests, an IGF-1 <-1SDS and a delta height <0SDS) were confirmed in 2 cases. One case of gonadotrophic deficiency occurred 1 year after TBI among 13 pubertal children. No cases of precocious puberty, 5 cases of low prolactin level, no cases of corticotropic insufficiency (cortisol peak <500 nmol/l) and no cases diabetes insipidus were recorded. Conclusion: Pituitary insufficiency was present 1year after mild TBI in about 7% of children. Based on our results, we suggest testing children after mild TBI in case of clinical abnormalities. i.e., for GH axis, IGF-1, which should be assessed in children with a delta height <0 SDS, 6 to 12 months after TBI, and a dynamic GH testing (preferentially by an ITT) should be performed in case of IGF-1 <-1SDS, with a GH threshold at 20 mUI/L. However, if a systematic pituitary assessment is not required for mild TBI, physicians should monitor children 1 year after mild TBI with particular attention to growth and weight gain.",Phosphodiesterases and cAMP Pathway in Pituitary Diseases.,https://www.ncbi.nlm.nih.gov/pubmed/30941100,Frontiers in endocrinology,2019 04 06,"Human phosphodiesterases (PDEs) comprise a complex superfamily of enzymes derived from 24 genes separated into 11 PDE gene families (PDEs 1-11), expressed in different tissues and cells, including heart and brain. The isoforms PDE4, PDE7, and PDE8 are specific for the second messenger cAMP, which is responsible for mediating diverse physiological actions involving different hormones and neurotransmitters. The cAMP pathway plays an important role in the development and function of endocrine tissues while phosphodiesterases are responsible for ensuring the appropriate intensity of the actions of this pathway by hydrolyzing cAMP to its inactive form 5'-AMP. PDE1, PDE2, PDE4, and PDE11A are highly expressed in the pituitary, and overexpression of some PDE4 isoforms have been demonstrated in different pituitary adenoma subtypes. This observed over-expression in pituitary adenomas, although of unknown etiology, has been considered a compensatory response to tumorigenesis. PDE4A4/5 has a unique interaction with the co-chaperone aryl hydrocarbon receptor-interacting protein (AIP), a protein implicated in somatotroph tumorigenesis via germline loss-of-function mutations. Based on the association of low PDE4A4 expression with germline AIP-mutation-positive samples, the available data suggest that lack of AIP hinders the upregulation of PDE4A4 protein seen in sporadic somatotrophinomas. This unique disturbance of the cAMP-PDE pathway observed in the majority of AIP-mutation positive adenomas could contribute to their well-described poor response to somatostatin analogs and may support a role in tumorigenesis.","Role of Epileptic Activity in Older Adults With Delirium, a Prospective Continuous EEG Study.",https://www.ncbi.nlm.nih.gov/pubmed/30941098,Frontiers in neurology,2019 04 06,"Background/Objectives: Delirium occurs in up to 50 % of hospitalized old patients and is associated with increased morbidity and mortality. Acute medical conditions favor delirium, but the pathophysiology is unclear. Preliminary evidence from retrospective and prospective studies suggests that a substantial minority of old patients with unexplained delirium have non-convulsive seizures or status epilepticus (NCSE). Yet, seeking epileptic activity only in unexplained cases of delirium might result in misinterpretation of its actual prevalence. We aimed to systematically investigate the role of epileptic activity in all older patients with delirium regardless of the underlying etiology. Design, Setting: Prospective observational study in a tertiary medical center. Adults >65 years with delirium underwent at least 24 h of continuous electro-encephalographic monitoring (cEEG). Background patterns and ictal and interictal epileptic discharges were identified, as well as clinical and biological characteristics. Participants: Fifty patients were included in the study. Results: NCSE was found in 6 (12%) patients and interictal discharges in 15 (30%). There was no difference in the prevalence of epileptic activity rates between delirium associated with an acute medical condition and delirium of unknown etiology. Conclusion: Epileptic activity may play a substantial role in the pathophysiology of delirium by altering brain functioning and neuronal metabolism. No clinical or biological marker was found to distinguish delirious patients with or without epileptic activity, underlining the importance of cEEG in this context.",The Electrophysiology of Presynaptic Congenital Myasthenic Syndromes With and Without Facilitation: From Electrodiagnostic Findings to Molecular Mechanisms.,https://www.ncbi.nlm.nih.gov/pubmed/30941097,Frontiers in neurology,2019 04 06,"Congenital myasthenic syndromes (CMS) are a group of inherited disorders of neuromuscular transmission most commonly presenting with early onset fatigable weakness, ptosis, and ophthalmoparesis. CMS are classified according to the localization of the causative molecular defect. CMS with presynaptic dysfunction can be caused by mutations in several different genes, including those involved in acetylcholine synthesis, its packaging into synaptic vesicles, vesicle docking, and release from the presynaptic nerve terminal and neuromuscular junction development and maintenance. Electrodiagnostic testing is key in distinguishing CMS from other neuromuscular disorders with similar clinical features as well as for revealing features pointing to a specific molecular diagnosis. A decremental response on low-frequency repetitive nerve stimulation (RNS) is present in most presynaptic CMS. In CMS with deficits in acetylcholine resynthesis however, a decrement may only appear after conditioning with exercise or high-frequency RNS and characteristically displays a slow recovery. Facilitation occurs in CMS caused by mutations in VAMP1, UNC13A, SYT2, AGRN, LAMA5. By contrast, facilitation is absent in the other presynaptic CMS described to date. An understanding of the underlying molecular mechanisms therefore assists the interpretation of electrodiagnostic findings in patients with suspected CMS.",There Is Selective Increase in Pro-thrombotic Circulating Extracellular Vesicles in Acute Ischemic Stroke and Transient Ischemic Attack: A Study of Patients From the Middle East and Southeast Asia.,https://www.ncbi.nlm.nih.gov/pubmed/30941096,Frontiers in neurology,2019 04 06,"Stroke attacks were found to be present at a younger age in patients from Southeast Asia (SE) and the Middle East (ME) resident in the state of Qatar. Extracellular vesicles (EVs), which are small membrane vesicles with pro-thrombotic properties, may contribute to the high risk of stroke in this population. Thus, total and cell-specific medium size EVs were counted by flow cytometry in platelet-free plasma from healthy volunteers and patients with transient ischemic attacks (TIA) and acute ischemic stroke (AIS) from SE and ME. Acutely, within 48 h of attacks, there was an increase in total endothelial EVs in TIA (6.73 ± 1.77; P = 0.0156; n = 21) and AIS (11.23 ± 1.95; P = 0.0007; n = 66) patients compared to controls (2.04 ± 0.78; n = 24). Similar increases were also evident in EVs originating from platelets, erythrocytes, granulocytes, and leukocytes. Compared to controls, there was also an increase in EVs derived from activated endothelial cells, platelets, granulocytes, leukocytes, and pro-coagulant EVs (Annexin V+) at 5 and 30-days following the acute events, while a decrease was observed in erythrocyte-derived EVs. This is the first study characterizing EVs in TIA and AIS patients from ME and SE showing an increase in EVs associated with endothelial and platelet cell activation, which may contribute to the elevated risk of stroke at a younger age in this population.",Platelet-Rich Plasma Intramuscular Injections - Antinociceptive Therapy in Myofascial Pain Within Masseter Muscles in Temporomandibular Disorders Patients: A Pilot Study.,https://www.ncbi.nlm.nih.gov/pubmed/30941095,Frontiers in neurology,2019 04 06,"Background and Objective: The objective of this study was to explore the nociceptive effect of platelet-rich plasma (PRP) intramuscular injections in myofascial pain of masseter muscles in patients with TMD. Methods: Patients diagnosed with myofascial pain were assessed for eligibility for the study. Masticatory muscle disorder was diagnosed based on the Research Diagnostic Criteria for Temporomandibular Disorders (Ia and Ib). A total of 80 patients were enrolled in the study; 58 of them (21 male and 37 female, 29.4 ± 6.53 years old) met the inclusion criteria and were randomized to one of the two groups: Group I (n = 29) and Group II (n = 29). The first group received injections with PRP and the second group received injections with isotonic saline as the control group (0.9% NaCl). The Visual Analog Scale (VAS) was used to determine the pain intensity changes during follow-up visits in each group. Results: A significant improvement in pain intensity in VAS scale was observed, with 58% reduction in the experimental group and 10.38% in the control placebo group, 5 days after the injections (Day 5). The pain intensity reduction (VAS) 14 days after the injections (Day 14) in experimental group was 47.16 and 4.62% in control group, according to the baseline values (Day 0). Conclusions: Intramuscular injection of PRP was a successful method for reducing myofascial pain within masseter muscles in temporomandibular disorders patients. However, the use of PRP for the treatment of myofascial pain within masticatory muscles requires further, clinical trials evaluation.

Such studies were able to confirm the association between chronic alcohol use and volumetric reductions in subcortical structures using FSL (FMRIB software library). However, each study that utilized FSL had different sets of subcortical structures that showed significant volumetric reduction. First, we aimed to investigate the reproducibility of using FSL to assess volumetric differences of subcortical structures between alcohol-dependent patients and control subjects. Second, we aimed to use Vertex analysis, a less utilized program, to visually inspect 3D meshes of subcortical structures and observe significant shape abnormalities that occurred in each subcortical structure. Vertex analysis results from the hippocampus and thalamus were overlaid on top of their respective subregional atlases to further pinpoint the subregional locations where shape abnormalities occurred. We analyzed the volumes of 14 subcortical structures (bilateral thalamus, caudate, putamen, globus pallidus, hippocampus, amygdala, nucleus accumbens) in 21 alcohol-dependent subjects and 21 healthy controls using images acquired with 3T MRI. The images were run through various programs found in FSL, such as SIENAX, FIRST, and Vertex analysis. We found that in alcohol-dependent patients, the bilateral thalamus (left: p < 0.01, right: p = 0.01), bilateral putamen (left: p = 0.02, right: p < 0.01), right globus pallidus (p < 0.01), bilateral hippocampus (left: p = 0.05, right: p = 0.03) and bilateral nucleus accumbens (left: p = 0.05, right: p = 0.03) were significantly reduced compared to the corresponding subcortical structures of healthy controls. With vertex analysis, we observed surface reductions of the following hippocampal subfields: Presubiculum, hippocampal tail, hippocampal molecular layer, hippocampal fissure, fimbria, and CA3. We reproduced the assessment made in previous studies that reductions in subcortical volume were negatively associated with alcohol dependence by using the FMRIB Software Library. In addition, we identified the subfields of the thalamus and hippocampus that showed volumetric reduction."

We examined the relationship between resilience, impulsivity, emotional intelligence and self-esteem, and restrained and compulsive eating. It was assumed that resilience and impulsivity can directly explain unhealthy eating attitudes (restrained and compulsive: both emotional eating and external eating). The study group comprised 211 individuals (105 men and 106 women) aged 20-29, all of whom were living in southern Poland. Measures included the Resilience Measurement Scale (SPP-25), the Eysenck's Impulsivity Inventory (IVE), the Multidimensional Self-Esteem Inventory (MSEI), the Emotional Intelligence Questionnaire (INTE), and the Polish adaptation of the Dutch Eating Behavior Questionnaire (DEBQ). The statistical analysis showed significant and positive correlations between emotional eating and general self-esteem, impulsivity, and weaker (but still significant) correlations with physical attractiveness. External eating was positively and significantly correlated with impulsivity and self-esteem (including physical attractiveness). Restrained eating was also positively and significantly correlated with general self-esteem. Both types of compulsive eating attitudes (emotional and external eating) were significantly and negatively correlated with resilience. Women showed a significantly higher positive correlation between impulsivity and external eating compared to men. The level of intensity of other measures proved similar across the entire study group regardless of sex. Impulsivity had the strongest and most direct significant influence on both emotional eating and external eating, and a negative effect on emotional intelligence. Resilience proved to have a significant impact on all three examined types of eating attitude (a direct negative effect on emotional eating and external eating, and positive direct effect on restrained eating), self-esteem, and emotional intelligence. An important psychological intervening variable in generating unhealthy eating attitudes proved to be self-esteem among both men and women. Emotional intelligence, which remains correlated with resilience, proved independent, with no effect on unhealthy eating attitudes. These results suggest that preventive treatment and educational programs implemented particularly among adolescents and young adults may support development of their psychological resources.",Trajectories of Self-Rated Health of Chinese Elders: A Piecewise Growth Model Analysis.,https://www.ncbi.nlm.nih.gov/pubmed/30941078,Frontiers in psychology,2019 04 06,"This study used piecewise growth modeling to describe the developmental trajectories of self-rated health (SRH) in the elderly and longitudinal associations with activities of daily living (ADL), educational level, economic status, age, and gender.

However, several reports have shown that left-hemisphere activity associated with pragmatic domains (e.g., prosody, indirect speech, figurative language) is comparable to or even greater than that observed in the RH, challenging the proposed putative role of the latter for relevant domains. Against this background, we report on an adult bilingual patient showing preservation of pragmatic verbal skills in both languages (L1: Spanish, L2: English) despite bilateral damage mainly focused on the RH. After two strokes, the patient sustained lesions in several regions previously implicated in pragmatic functions (vast portions of the right fronto-insulo-temporal cortices, the bilateral amygdalae and insular cortices, and the left putamen). Yet, comparison of linguistic and pragmatic skills with matched controls revealed spared performance on multiple relevant tasks in both her L1 and L2. Despite mild difficulties in some aspects of L2 prosody, she showed no deficits in comprehending metaphors and idioms, or understanding indirect speech acts in either language. Basic verbal skills were also preserved in both languages, including verbal auditory discrimination, repetition of words and pseudo-words, cognate processing, grammaticality judgments, equivalent recognition, and word and sentence translation. Taken together, the evidence shows that multiple functions of verbal communication can be widely spared despite extensive damage to the RH, and that claims for a putative relation between pragmatics and the RH may have been overemphasized in the monolingual and bilingual literature. We further discuss the case in light of previous reports of pragmatic and linguistic deficits following brain lesions and address its relation to cognitive compensation in bilingual patients.",Robust Temporal Averaging of Time Intervals Between Action and Sensation.,https://www.ncbi.nlm.nih.gov/pubmed/30941074,Frontiers in psychology,2019 04 06,"Perception of the time interval between one's own action (a finger tapping) and the associated sensory feedback (a visual flash or an auditory beep) is critical for precise and flexible control of action and behavioral decision. Previous studies have examined temporal averaging for multiple time intervals and its role for perceptual organization and crossmodal integration. In the present study, we extended the temporal averaging from sensory stimuli to the coupling of action and its sensory feedback. We investigated whether and how temporal averaging could be achieved with respect to the multiple intervals in a sequence of action-sensory feedback events, and hence affect the subsequent timing behavior. In unimodal task, participants voluntarily tapped their index finger at a constant pace while receiving auditory feedback (beeps) with varied intervals as well as variances throughout the sequence. In crossmodal task, for a given sequence, each tap was accompanied randomly with either visual flash or auditory beep as sensory feedback. When the sequence was over, observers produced a subsequent tap with either auditory or visual stimulus, which enclose a probe interval. In both tasks, participants were required to make a two alternative forced choice (2AFC), to indicate whether the target interval is shorter or longer than the mean interval between taps and their associated sensory events in the preceding sequence. In both scenarios, participants' judgments of the probe interval suggested that they had internalized the mean interval associated with specific bindings of action and sensation, showing a robust temporal averaging process for the interval between action and sensation.",Dynamic Facial Expression of Emotion and Observer Inference.,https://www.ncbi.nlm.nih.gov/pubmed/30941073,Frontiers in psychology,2019 04 06,"Research on facial emotion expression has mostly focused on emotion recognition, assuming that a small number of discrete emotions is elicited and expressed via prototypical facial muscle configurations as captured in still photographs. These are expected to be recognized by observers, presumably via template matching. In contrast, appraisal theories of emotion propose a more dynamic approach, suggesting that specific elements of facial expressions are directly produced by the result of certain appraisals and predicting the facial patterns to be expected for certain appraisal configurations. This approach has recently been extended to emotion perception, claiming that observers first infer individual appraisals and only then make categorical emotion judgments based on the estimated appraisal patterns, using inference rules. Here, we report two related studies to empirically investigate the facial action unit configurations that are used by actors to convey specific emotions in short affect bursts and to examine to what extent observers can infer a person's emotions from the predicted facial expression configurations. The results show that (1) professional actors use many of the predicted facial action unit patterns to enact systematically specified appraisal outcomes in a realistic scenario setting, and (2) naïve observers infer the respective emotions based on highly similar facial movement configurations with a degree of accuracy comparable to earlier research findings. Based on estimates of underlying appraisal criteria for the different emotions we conclude that the patterns of facial action units identified in this research correspond largely to prior predictions and encourage further research on appraisal-driven expression and inference.",Fostering Flexibility in the New World of Work: A Model of Time-Spatial Job Crafting.,https://www.ncbi.nlm.nih.gov/pubmed/30941072,Frontiers in psychology,2019 04 06,"In today's ""new world of work,"" knowledge workers are often given considerable flexibility regarding where and when to work (i.e., time-spatial flexibility) and this has become a popular approach to redesigning work. Whilst the adoption of such practices is mainly considered a top-down approach to work design, we argue that successful utilization of time-spatial flexibility requires proactivity on the part of the employee in the form of time-spatial job crafting. Previous research has demonstrated that time-spatial flexibility can have both positive and negative effects on well-being, performance, and work-life balance; yet remains mute about the underlying reasons for this and how employees can handle the given flexibility. Drawing on research from work design, we posit that in order for employees to stay well and productive in this context, they need to engage in time-spatial job crafting (i.e., a context-specific form of job crafting that entails reflection on time and place), which can be considered a future work skill. We propose a theoretical model of time-spatial job crafting in which we discuss its components, shed light on its antecedents, and explain how time-spatial job crafting is related to positive work outcomes through a time/spatial-demands fit.",Effects of Blue Light on Dynamic Vision.,https://www.ncbi.nlm.nih.gov/pubmed/30941071,Frontiers in psychology,2019 04 06,"Dynamic vision is crucial to not only animals' hunting behaviors but also human activities, and yet little is known about how to enhance it, except for extensive trainings like athletics do. Exposure to blue light has been shown to enhance human alertness (Chellappa et al., 2011), perhaps through intrinsically photosensitive retinal ganglion cells (ipRGCs), which are sensitive to motion perception as revealed by animal studies. However, it remains unknown whether blue light can enhance human dynamic vision, a motion-related ability. We conducted five experiments under blue or orange light to test three important components of dynamic vision: eye pursuit accuracy (EPA, Experiment 1), kinetic visual acuity (KVA, Experiment 1 and 2), and dynamic visual acuity (DVA, Experiment 3-5). EPA was measured by the distance between the position of the fixation and the position of the target when participants tracked a target dot. In the KVA task, participants reported three central target numbers (randomly chosen from 0 to 9) moving toward participants in the depth plane, with speed threshold calculated by a staircase procedure. In the DVA task, three numbers were presented along the meridian line on the same depth plane, with motion direction (Experiment 3) and difficulty level (Experiment 4) manipulated, and a blue light filter lens was used to test the ipRGCs contribution (Experiment 5). Results showed that blue light enhanced EPA and DVA, but reduced KVA. Further, DVA enhancement was modulated by difficulty level: blue light enhancement effect was found only with hard task in the downward motion in Experiment 3 and with the low contrast target in Experiment 4. However, this blue light enhancement effect was not caused by mechanism of the ipRGCs, at least not in the range we tested. In this first study demonstrating the relationship between different components of dynamic vision and blue light, our findings that DVA can be enhanced under blue light with hard but not easy task indicate that blue light can enhance dynamic visual discrimination when needed.","Innovation in Psychotherapy, Challenges, and Opportunities: An Opinion Paper.",https://www.ncbi.nlm.nih.gov/pubmed/30941070,Frontiers in psychology,2019 04 06,"Psychotherapy as a field tends toward conservativism, and the rate of innovation and development of new evidence-based effective treatments has been slow.

We compared knowledge of case marking in Hindi-English bilinguals with different dominance patterns: 23 balanced bilinguals and two groups of bilinguals with Hindi as their weaker language: 24 L2 learners of Hindi with age of acquisition (AoA) of Hindi in adulthood and 26 Hindi heritage speakers with AoA of Hindi since birth in oral production and acceptability judgments. The balanced bilinguals outperformed the English-dominant bilinguals; the L2 learners and the heritage speakers, who showed similar lower command of the Hindi case marking system, with the exception of -ko marking as a function of specificity with direct objects.

However, a significant gap in the literature is the understanding of how the life stage of couples may influence their dyadic coping and the accompanying quality of life. Although younger couples have been identified at higher risk for poor coping because of less collaborative behaviors and higher vulnerability to stress, only a limited number of studies have addressed younger women's coping with breast cancer in the context of close relationships. The present study addressed the differential impact of the illness on the quality of life and dyadic coping behaviors of younger and middle-aged dyads and the influence of relational mutuality on couples' coping in the two groups. A sample of 86 couples participated in a cross-sectional study; 35 younger couples were compared to 51 middle-aged dyads. Patients and partners completed measures of quality of life, dyadic coping, and mutuality. Independent-samples t-tests were used to examine differences in the two groups, while the Actor-Partner Interdependence Model (APIM) identified actor and partner effects of relational mutuality on dyadic coping. Younger women and their partners reported statistically significant worse quality of life and dyadic coping scores than the middle-age group. For younger couples, positive and negative coping styles were the result of both actor and partner effects of mutuality. The study highlighted the more negative impact of breast cancer on the quality of life of younger patients and partners. It also revealed a stronger influence of each partner's relational mutuality compared to the middle-age group in predicting both adaptive and maladaptive coping behavior. Future studies should continue to examine the developmental trajectory of dyadic coping across the lifespan in order to develop psychosocial interventions to promote younger dyads' coping efforts."

Automated high-throughput, drug target identification is one of the primary goals of this in silico network biology. Targets identified in this way are then used to mine a library of drug chemical compounds in order to identify appropriate therapies. While identification of drug targets is exhaustively feasible on small networks, it remains computationally difficult on moderate and larger models. Moreover, there are several important constraints such as off-target effects, efficacy and safety that should be integrated into the identification of targets if the intention is translation to the clinical space. Here we introduce numerical constraints whereby efficacy is represented by efficiency in response and robustness of outcome. This paper introduces an algorithm that relies on a Constraint Satisfaction (CS) technique to efficiently compute the Minimal Intervention Sets (MIS) within a set of often complex clinical safety constraints with the aim of identifying the smallest least invasive set of targets pharmacologically accessible for therapy that most efficiently and reliably achieve the desired outcome.",Beyond RPE: The Perception of Exercise Under Normal and Ketotic Conditions.,https://www.ncbi.nlm.nih.gov/pubmed/30941052,Frontiers in physiology,2019 04 06,"Subjective perceptions of exercising exertion are integral to maintaining homeostasis.

We utilized the intervention of ketoacidosis (via consumption of an exogenous ketone ester drink) to independently perturb exercise-related metabolites and humoral signals, thus allowing us to additionally identify the possible contributing physiological signals to each of these perceptions.",The Effect of Melatonin on Locomotor Behavior and Muscle Physiology in the Sea Cucumber Apostichopus japonicus.,https://www.ncbi.nlm.nih.gov/pubmed/30941049,Frontiers in physiology,2019 04 06,"Melatonin is a highly conserved hormone in evolutionary history. It occurs in numerous organisms and plays a role in the endocrine and immune systems. Locomotor behavior is a basic behavior in animals and is an important indicator of circadian rhythms, which are coordinated by the nervous and endocrine systems. To date, the effect of melatonin on locomotor behavior has been studied in vertebrates, including syrian hamsters, sparrows, rats, zebrafish, goldfish, and flatworms. However, there have been few studies of the effects of melatonin on locomotor behavior in marine invertebrates. The goals of present study were to show the existence of melatonin in the sea cucumber Apostichopus japonicus and to evaluate its effect on locomotor activity. In addition, muscle tissues from control and melatonin-treated sea cucumbers were tested using ultra performance liquid chromatography and quadrupole time-of-flight mass spectrometry (UPLC-Q-TOF-MS) to determine the changes of metabolic activity in muscle. Melatonin was present in the coelomic fluid of A. japonicus at a concentration of ∼135.0 ng/L. The total distance traveled and number steps taken over 9 h after melatonin administration decreased with increasing concentration of the melatonin dose. Mean and maximum velocity of movement and stride length and stride frequency also decreased, but their differences were not statistically significant. Overall, these results suggest that melatonin administration had a sedative effect on A. japonicus. The levels of 22 different metabolites were altered in the muscle tissues of melatonin-treated sea cucumbers. Serotonin, 9-cis retinoic acid, all-trans retinoic acid, flavin mononucleotide in muscles were downregulated after melatonin administration. Moreover, a high free fatty acid (FFA) concentration and a decrease in the adenosine 5'-triphosphate (ATP) concentration in the muscle tissues of the melatonin-treated group were detected as well. These results suggest that the sedative effect of melatonin involves some other metabolic pathways, and the reduced locomotor modulator-serotonin, inhibited fatty acid oxidation and disturbed oxidative phosphorylation are potential physiological mechanisms that result in the inhibitory effect of melatonin on locomotion in sea cucumbers.",Discovery Stories of RET Fusions in Lung Cancer: A Mini-Review.,https://www.ncbi.nlm.nih.gov/pubmed/30941048,Frontiers in physiology,2019 04 06,"In 2004, a chemical inhibitor of the kinase activity of EGFR was reported to be effective in a subset of lung cancer patients with activating somatic mutations of EGFR.

However, it is challenging to efficiently deliver nanocarriers into tumor cells to elevate intracellular drug concentration. Herein, we developed an effective pH-responsive and dual drug co-delivery platform for combined chemo/photothermal therapy. An anticancer drug doxorubicin (DOX) was first loaded onto the surface of black phosphorus (BP). With poly(2-ethyl-2-oxazoline) (PEOz) ligand conjugated onto the polydopamine (PDA) coated BP nanosheets, targeted long circulation and cellular uptake in vivo was significantly improved. With another anticancer drug bortezomib (BTZ) loaded onto the surface of the nanocapsule, the platform can co-deliver two different drugs. The surface charge of the nanocapsule was reversed from negative to positive at the tumor extracellular pH (∼6.8), ionizing the tertiary amide groups along the PEOz chain, thus facilitating the cell internalization of the nanocarrier. The cytotoxicity therapeutic effect of this nanoplatform was further augmented under near-infrared laser irradiation. As such, our DOX-loaded BP@PDA-PEOz-BTZ platform is very promising to synergistic cancer therapy.",A Combined Phytochemistry and Network Pharmacology Approach to Reveal the Potential Antitumor Effective Substances and Mechanism of Phellinus igniarius.,https://www.ncbi.nlm.nih.gov/pubmed/30941044,Frontiers in pharmacology,2019 04 06,"Phellinus igniarius (P. igniarius) is a medicinal fungus that is widely used in East Asia for the adjuvant treatment of cancer. To elucidate the antitumor effective substances and mechanism of P. igniarius, we designed an approach incorporating cytotoxicity screening, phytochemical analysis, network pharmacology construction, and cellular and molecular experiments. The dichloromethane extract of P. igniarius (DCMPI) was identified as the active portion in HT-29 cells. Nineteen constituents were identified, and 5 were quantified by UPLC-ESI-Q/TOF-MS. Eight ingredients were obtained in the network pharmacology study. In total, 473 putative targets associated with DCMPI and 350 putative targets related to colon cancer were derived from online databases and target prediction tools. Protein-protein interaction networks of drug and disease putative targets were constructed, and 84 candidate targets were identified based on topological features. Pathway enrichment analysis showed that the candidate targets were mostly related to reactive oxygen species (ROS) metabolic processes and intrinsic apoptotic pathways. Then, a cellular experiment was used to validate the drug-target mechanisms predicted by the system pharmacology analysis. Experimental results showed that DCMPI increased intracellular ROS levels and induced HT-29 cell apoptosis. Molecular biology experiments indicated that DCMPI not only increased Bax and Bad protein expression and promoted PARP and caspase-3/9 cleavage but also down-regulated Bcl-2 and Bcl-xl protein levels to induce apoptosis in HT-29 cells. In conclusion, our study provides knowledge on the chemical composition and antitumor mechanism of P. igniarius, which may be exploited as a promising therapeutic option for colon cancer.",Paeonol Ameliorates Glucose and Lipid Metabolism in Experimental Diabetes by Activating Akt.,https://www.ncbi.nlm.nih.gov/pubmed/30941042,Frontiers in pharmacology,2019 04 06,"Our previous study proved that paeonol (Pae) could lower blood glucose levels of diabetic mice. There are also a few reports of its potential use for diabetes treatment. However, the role of Pae in regulating glucose and lipid metabolism in diabetes remains largely unknown. Considering the critical role of serine/threonine kinase B (Akt) in glucose and lipid metabolism, we explored whether Pae could improve glucose and lipid metabolism disorders via Akt. Here, we found that Pae attenuated fasting blood glucose, glycosylated serum protein, serum cholesterol and triglyceride (TG), hepatic glycogen, cholesterol and TG in diabetic mice. Moreover, Pae enhanced glucokinase (GCK) and low-density lipoprotein receptor (LDLR) protein expressions, and increased the phosphorylation of Akt. In insulin-resistant HepG2 cells, Pae increased glucose uptake and decreased lipid accumulation. What's more, Pae elevated LDLR and GCK expressions as well as Akt phosphorylation, which was consistent with the in vivo results. Knockdown and inhibition experiments of Akt revealed that Pae regulated LDLR and GCK expressions through activation of Akt. Finally, molecular docking assay indicated the steady hydrogen bond was formed between Pae and Akt2. Experiments above suggested that Pae ameliorated glucose and lipid metabolism disorders and the underlying mechanism was closely related to the activation of Akt.","Jia-Wei-Kai-Xin-San, an Herbal Medicine Formula, Ameliorates Cognitive Deficits via Modulating Metabolism of Beta Amyloid Protein and Neurotrophic Factors in Hippocampus of Aβ1-42 Induced Cognitive Deficit Mice.",https://www.ncbi.nlm.nih.gov/pubmed/30941041,Frontiers in pharmacology,2019 04 06,"Jia-Wei-Kai-Xin-San (JWKXS) is a Chinese medicine formula applied for treating morbid forgetfulness in ancient China. Today, this formula is frequently applied for Alzheimer's disease and vascular dementia (VD) in clinic. Here, we developed it as granules and aimed to evaluate its anti-AD effect on β amyloid protein 1-42 (Aβ1-42) induced cognitive deficit mice and reveal the possible molecular mechanisms. Firstly, daily intra-gastric administration of chemically standardized of JWKXS granules for 7 days significantly ameliorated the cognitive deficit symptoms and inhibited cell apoptosis in hippocampus on Aβ1-42 injection mice. JWKXS granules significantly decreased Aβ level, increased superoxide dismutase activity and decreased malondialdehyde level in hippocampus of model mice. It also restored acetylcholine amounts, inhibited acetylcholinesterase activities and increased choline acetyltransferase activities. In addition, JWKXS granules enabled the transformation of precursors of NGF and BDNF into mature forms. Furthermore, JWKXS granules could regulate gene expressions related to Aβ production, transportation, degradation and neurotrophic factor transformation, which led to down-regulation of Aβ and up-regulation of NGF and BDNF. These findings suggested that JWKXS granules ameliorated cognitive deficit via decreasing Aβ levels, protecting neuron from oxidation damages and nourishing neuron, which could serve as alternative medicine for patients suffering from AD.","Metabolomics Reveals Effect of Zishen Jiangtang Pill, a Chinese Herbal Product on High-Fat Diet-Induced Type 2 Diabetes Mellitus in Mice.",https://www.ncbi.nlm.nih.gov/pubmed/30941040,Frontiers in pharmacology,2019 04 06,"A Chinese herbal decoction, Zishen Jiangtang Pill (ZJP), has been clinically prescribed to diabetic patients to prevent excessive blood sugar levels for decades. However, the potential mechanisms of this action have not been well investigated. The purpose of this study was to explore the metabolic variations in response to ZJP treatment for an animal model of obese type 2 diabetes. An UHPLC-Orbitrap/MS-based metabolomics tool was conducted to reveal the potential mechanisms of ZJP on diabetic mice. The treatment with ZJP significantly restored the increased levels of insulin, glucose and total cholesterol in high-fat diet mice. A total of 26 potential biomarkers were found and identified in serum samples, amongst which 24 metabolites were robustly affected and driven back to the control-like levels after ZJP treatment. By analyzing the metabolic pathways, glutathione metabolism, steroid hormone biosynthesis and glycerophospholipid metabolism were suggested to be closely involved in diabetes disease. From the above outcomes, it can be concluded that ZJP exhibits a promising anti-diabetic activity, largely due to the regulation of phospholipid metabolism, including phosphatidylcholines, lysophosphatidylcholines, and phosphatidylinositol.",Sub-Acute Oral Toxicity of a Novel Derivative of Agomelatine in Rats in a Sex-Dependent Manner.,https://www.ncbi.nlm.nih.gov/pubmed/30941037,Frontiers in pharmacology,2019 04 06,"Agomelatine (AGO) is a new type of antidepressant with demonstrated antidepressant effects and a unique modulating circadian rhythm action. However, AGO has hepatotoxicity, which limits its clinical application. In order to develop new drugs that cause less liver injury than AGO, a series of derivatives were synthesized; compound GW117 was screened from derivatives due to its high receptor affinity. This study will investigate its sub-acute oral toxicity profile in rats in a sex-dependent manner. GW117 and AGO was administrated by gavage (200, 400, or 800 mg/kg/day) for 28 days. Hematological, biochemical tests, organ weights, histopathological examinations were carried out, the results showed that AGO and GW117 had adverse effects on platelet, liver and kidney, and had sex-differences in some indicators. Hematological tests showed that AGO and GW117 reduced the platelet count in male animals but had no effect in females. AGO increased plasma alanine aminotransferase (ALT) and total bilirubin in male animals, and GW117 had no effect on these two indicators. For females, AGO moderately elevated ALT, alkaline phosphatase (ALP), and total bilirubin, while GW117 only elevated ALP slightly. Two drugs could increase liver weight and coefficient, and cause liver pathological injury, including hepatic sinusoidal dilatation, hepatocyte fatty deposition and dotted cell necrosis in two genders. AGO caused mild to moderate hepatocyte and hepatobiliary injury in both genders, while only a mild hepatobiliary injury was caused by GW117 in females. Renal function tests showed that both drugs can increase blood urea nitrogen levels in males, while AGO, but not GW117, can slightly increase blood creatinine and urea nitrogen in females. The kidney weight and coefficient could be significantly increased by two drugs in males, and by AGO medium and GW117 high and low doses in females. The kidney pathological damage was mainly characterized by tubule dilatation, a thinning of the renal cortex. Kidney damage caused by GW117 was less than that of AGO, and there was no sex-difference. In summary, GW117 can cause mild liver and kidney damage in both genders, as well as mild platelets reduction in males, while degree of damage is less severe than AGO. Therefore, as an excellent derivative, GW117 deserves further development as an antidepressant."

In some species, selective preferences for specific peers provide a foundation for consistent group composition. These preferences may be shaped by affiliation toward familiar individuals, and/or by aversion to unfamiliar individuals. We compared peer interactions in two vole species that form selective preferences for familiar same-sex individuals but differ in mating system. Prairie voles (Microtus ochrogaster) form pair bonds with mates and may reside in family groups. Meadow voles (Microtus pennsylvanicus) are promiscuous breeders that form communal winter groups in the wild, and exhibit greater social behavior in short day (SD) lengths in the laboratory. We characterized affiliative, anxiety-like, and aggressive interactions with familiar and novel same-sex conspecifics in meadow and prairie voles housed in summer- or winter-like photoperiods. Species differences in affective behaviors were pronounced, with prairie voles exhibiting more aggressive behavior and less anxiety-like behavior relative to meadow voles. Meadow voles housed in short (vs. long) day lengths were more affiliative and more interactive with strangers; prosocial behavior was also facilitated by a history of social housing. Prairie voles exhibited partner preferences regardless of sex or day length, indicating that selective peer preferences are the norm in prairie voles. Prairie vole females formed preferences for new same-sex social partners following re-pairing; males were often aggressive upon re-pairing. These data suggest that preferences for familiar peers in prairie voles are maintained in part by aggression toward unfamiliar individuals, as in mate partnerships. In contrast, social tolerance is an important feature of meadow vole peer affiliation, demonstrated by low aggression toward unfamiliar conspecifics, and consistent with field data on winter tolerance.","Hippocampus, Amygdala, and Thalamus Volumes in Very Preterm Children at 8 Years: Neonatal Pain and Genetic Variation.",https://www.ncbi.nlm.nih.gov/pubmed/30941021,Frontiers in behavioral neuroscience,2019 04 06,"Altered hippocampal morphology and reduced volumes have been found in children born preterm compared to full-term. Stress inhibits neurogenesis in the hippocampus, and neonatal stress/noxious stimulation in rodent pups are associated with long-term alterations in hippocampal volumes. We have previously shown reduced cortical thickness and cerebellar volumes in relation to more exposure to pain-related stress of neonatal invasive procedures in children born very preterm. We have reported targeted gene-by-pain environment interactions that contribute to long-term brain development and outcomes in this population. We now aim to determine whether exposure to pain-related stress (adjusted for clinical factors and genotype) differentially impacts regional structures within the limbic system and thalamus, and investigate relationships with outcomes in very preterm children. Our study included 57 children born very preterm (<32 weeks GA) followed longitudinally from birth who underwent 3-D T1 MRI neuroimaging at ∼8 years. Hippocampal subfields and white matter tracts, thalamus and amygdala were automatically segmented using the MAGeT Brain algorithm. The relationship between those subcortical brain volumes (adjusted for total brain volume) and neonatal invasive procedures, gestational age (GA), illness severity, postnatal infection, days of mechanical ventilation, number of surgeries, morphine exposure, and genotype (COMT, SLC6A4, and BDNF) was examined using constrained principal component analysis. We found that neonatal clinical factors and genotypes accounted for 46% of the overall variance in volumes of hippocampal subregions, tracts, basal ganglia, thalamus and amygdala. After controlling for clinical risk factors and total brain volume, greater neonatal invasive procedures was associated with lower volumes in the amygdala and thalamus (p = 0.0001) and an interaction with COMT genotype predicted smaller hippocampal subregional volume (p = 0.0001). More surgeries, days of ventilation, and lower GA were also related to smaller volumes in various subcortical regions (p < 0.002). These reduced volumes were in turn differentially related to poorer cognitive, visual-motor and behavioral outcomes. Our findings highlight the complexity that interplays when examining how exposure to early-life stress may impact brain development both at the structural and functional level, and provide new insight on possible novel avenues of research to discover brain-protective treatments to improve the care of children born preterm.",Antiphospholipid Antibodies Overlapping in Isolated Neurological Syndrome and Multiple Sclerosis: Neurobiological Insights and Diagnostic Challenges.,https://www.ncbi.nlm.nih.gov/pubmed/30941020,Frontiers in cellular neuroscience,2019 04 06,"Antiphospholipid syndrome (APS) is characterized by arterial and venous thrombosis, pregnancy morbidity and fetal loss caused by pathogenic autoantibodies directed against phospholipids (PL) and PL-cofactors. Isolated neurological APS may represent a significant diagnostic challenge, as epidemiological, clinical and neuroimaging features may overlap with those of multiple sclerosis (MS). In an open view, MS could be considered as an organ-specific anti-lipid (phospholipid and glycosphingolipid associated proteins) disease, in which autoreactive B cells and CD8+ T cells play a dominant role in its pathophysiology. In MS, diverse autoantibodies against the lipid-protein cofactors of the myelin sheath have been described, whose pathophysiologic role has not been fully elucidated. We carried out a review to select clinical studies addressing the prevalence of antiphospholipid (aPL) autoantibodies in the so-called MS-like syndrome. The reported prevalence ranged between 2% and 88%, particularly aCL and aβ2GPI, with predominant IgM isotype and suggesting worse MS prognosis. Secondarily, an updated summary of current knowledge on the pathophysiological mechanisms and events responsible for these conditions is presented. We draw attention to the clinical relevance of diagnosing isolated neurological APS. Prompt and accurate diagnosis and antiaggregant and anticoagulant treatment of APS could be vital to prevent or at least reduce APS-related morbidity and mortality.",Wheel Running Improves Motor Function and Spinal Cord Plasticity in Mice With Genetic Absence of the Corticospinal Tract.,https://www.ncbi.nlm.nih.gov/pubmed/30941019,Frontiers in cellular neuroscience,2019 04 06,"Our previous studies showed that mutant mice with congenital absence of the corticospinal tract (CST) undergo spontaneous remodeling of motor networks to partially compensate for absent CST function. Here, we asked whether voluntary wheel running could further improve locomotor plasticity in CST-deficient mice. Adult mutant mice were randomly allocated to a ""runners"" group with free access to a wheel, or a ""non-runners"" group with no access to a wheel. In comparison with non-runners, there was a significant motor improvement including fine movement, grip strength, decreased footslip errors in runners after 8-week training, which was supported by the elevated amplitude of electromyography recording and increased neuromuscular junctions in the biceps. In runners, terminal ramifications of monoaminergic and rubrospinal descending axons were significantly increased in spinal segments after 12 weeks of exercise compared to non-runners. 5-ethynyl-2'-deoxyuridine (EDU) labeling showed that proliferating cells, 90% of which were Olig2-positive oligodendrocyte progenitors, were 4.8-fold more abundant in runners than in non-runners. In 8-week runners, RNAseq analysis of spinal samples identified 404 genes up-regulated and 398 genes down-regulated, and 69 differently expressed genes involved in signal transduction, among which the NF-κB, PI3K-Akt and cyclic AMP (cAMP) signaling were three top pathways. Twelve-week training induced a significant elevation of postsynaptic density protein 95 (PSD95), synaptophysin 38 and myelin basic protein (MBP), but not of brain derived neurotrophic factor (BDNF), glial cell line-derived neurotrophic factor (GDNF) and insulin like growth factor-1 (IGF-1). Thus, locomotor training activates multiple signaling pathways, contributes to neural plasticity and functional improvement, and might palliate locomotor deficits in patients.",Proteomics Study of Peripheral Blood Mononuclear Cells (PBMCs) in Autistic Children.,https://www.ncbi.nlm.nih.gov/pubmed/30941018,Frontiers in cellular neuroscience,2019 04 06,"Autism is one of the most common neurological developmental disorder associated with social isolation and restricted interests in children. The etiology of this disorder is still unknown. There is neither any confirmed laboratory test nor any effective therapeutic strategy to diagnose or cure it. To search for biomarkers for early detection and exploration of the disease mechanisms, here, we investigated the protein expression signatures of peripheral blood mononuclear cells (PBMCs) in autistic children compared with healthy controls by using isobaric tags for relative and absolute quantitation (iTRAQ) proteomics approach. The results showed a total of 41 proteins as differentially expressed in autistic group as compared to control. These proteins are found associated with metabolic pathways, endoplasmic reticulum (ER) stress and protein folding, endocytosis, immune and inflammatory response, plasma lipoprotein particle organization, and cell adhesion. Among these, 17 proteins (13 up-regulated and four down-regulated) are found to be linked with mitochondria. Eight proteins including three already reported proteins in our previous studies were selected to be verified. Five already reported autism associated pro-inflammatory cytokines [interferon-γ (IFN-γ), interleukin-1β (IL-1β), IL-6, IL-12, and tumor necrosis factor-α (TNF-α)] were detected in plasma by enzyme-linked immunosorbent assay (ELISA) analysis. The results were consistent with proteomic results and reports from previous literature. These results proposed that PBMCs from autistic children might be activated, and ER stress, unfolded protein response (UPR), acute-phase response (APR), inflammatory response, and endocytosis may be involved in autism occurrence. These reported proteins may serve as potential biomarkers for early diagnosis of autism. More specifically, simultaneous detection of three proteins [complement C3 (C3), calreticulin (CALR), and SERPINA1] in the plasma and PBMCs could increase the authenticity of detection.","Mitochondrial Dysfunction in Huntington's Disease; Interplay Between HSF1, p53 and PGC-1α Transcription Factors.",https://www.ncbi.nlm.nih.gov/pubmed/30941017,Frontiers in cellular neuroscience,2019 04 06,"Huntington's disease (HD) is a neurodegenerative disease caused by an expanded CAG repeat in the huntingtin (HTT) gene, causing the protein to misfold and aggregate. HD progression is characterized by motor impairment and cognitive decline associated with the preferential loss of striatal medium spiny neurons (MSNs). The mechanisms that determine increased susceptibility of MSNs to mutant HTT (mHTT) are not fully understood, although there is abundant evidence demonstrating the importance of mHTT mediated mitochondrial dysfunction in MSNs death. Two main transcription factors, p53 and peroxisome proliferator co-activator PGC-1α, have been widely studied in HD for their roles in regulating mitochondrial function and apoptosis. The action of these two proteins seems to be interconnected. However, it is still open to discussion whether p53 and PGC-1α dependent responses directly influence each other or if they are connected via a third mechanism. Recently, the stress responsive transcription factor HSF1, known for its role in protein homeostasis, has been implicated in mitochondrial function and in the regulation of PGC-1α and p53 levels in different contexts. Based on previous reports and our own research, we discuss in this review the potential role of HSF1 in mediating mitochondrial dysfunction in HD and propose a unifying mechanism that integrates the responses mediated by p53 and PGC-1α in HD via HSF1.",Systemic Cellular Activation Mapping of an Extinction-Impaired Animal Model.,https://www.ncbi.nlm.nih.gov/pubmed/30941016,Frontiers in cellular neuroscience,2019 04 06,"Fear extinction diminishes conditioned fear responses and impaired fear extinction has been reported to be related to anxiety disorders such as post-traumatic stress disorder (PTSD). We and others have reported that 129S1/SvImJ (129S1) strain of mice showed selective impairments in fear extinction following successful auditory or contextual fear conditioning. To investigate brain regions involved in the impaired fear extinction of 129S1 mice, we systemically analyzed c-Fos expression patterns before and after contextual fear conditioning and extinction. After fear conditioning, 129S1 mice showed significantly increased c-Fos expression in the medial division of the central amygdala (CEm), prelimbic (PL) cortex of the medial prefrontal cortex (mPFC), and dorsal CA3 of the hippocampus, compared to that of control C57BL/6 mice. Following fear extinction, 129S1 mice exhibited significantly more c-Fos-positive cells in the CEm, PL, and paraventricular nucleus of the thalamus (PVT) than did C57BL/6 mice. These results reveal the dynamic circuitry involved in different steps of fear memory formation and extinction, thus providing candidate brain regions to study the etiology and pathophysiology underlying impaired fear extinction.",TF-ChIP Method for Tissue-Specific Gene Targets.,https://www.ncbi.nlm.nih.gov/pubmed/30941015,Frontiers in cellular neuroscience,2019 04 06,"Chromatin immunoprecipitation (ChIP) is an assay developed in order to define the dynamic nature of transcription processes. This method has been widely employed to identify methylated and acetylated DNA sequences in a variety of organs both in animals and humans. Nevertheless, this technique is significantly less employed to study transcriptional targets of specific nuclear signaling factors (TFs) and the data published so far have mainly used cell culture material and have been hardly reproduced in ex-vivo tissue. As nuclear signaling underlies important adaptive and maladaptive responses in chronic conditions such as cancer and neurodegeneration, there is a need for streamlining the upfront workflow of TF-ChIP for subsequent target sequencing. Based on the typical low concentration of the signaling transcriptional complex and the complexity/length of the ChIP Seq protocol, the field of cellular signaling has been confronted with a major roadblock in identifying clinically relevant targets of pathological and physiological signaling pathways. The present protocol offers a standardized procedure for detecting signaling targets in any whole tissue or specific dissected regions. The advantages of the protocol compared to the existing published methods are: (1) the small amount of starting material; appropriate for tissue subregions; (2) the optimization of DNA fragmentation from whole tissue; (3) suitability for sparsely populated tissues (i.e., brain); (4) the specificity of the TF-targeting readout; and (5) high DNA quality for sequencing or hybridization. The present protocol is highly detailed and can be reproduced using both fresh and fresh-frozen tissue. This is particularly relevant in the clinical setting, where specimen integrity is often the limiting step and where transcriptional target profiling is therapeutically relevant. The method is centered on Notch signaling but can be applied to a variety of nuclear signaling pathways as long as specific antibodies are available for pull down. Taken the superior yield/readout of this procedure, ChIP may finally provide relevant information about dynamic downstream gene changes in vivo for use in both basic research and clinical applications.",Impaired Redox Signaling in Huntington's Disease: Therapeutic Implications.,https://www.ncbi.nlm.nih.gov/pubmed/30941013,Frontiers in molecular neuroscience,2019 04 06,"Huntington's disease (HD) is a neurodegenerative disease triggered by expansion of polyglutamine repeats in the protein huntingtin. Mutant huntingtin (mHtt) aggregates and elicits toxicity by multiple mechanisms which range from dysregulated transcription to disturbances in several metabolic pathways in both the brain and peripheral tissues. Hallmarks of HD include elevated oxidative stress and imbalanced redox signaling. Disruption of antioxidant defense mechanisms, involving antioxidant molecules and enzymes involved in scavenging or reversing oxidative damage, have been linked to the pathophysiology of HD. In addition, mitochondrial function is compromised in HD leading to impaired bioenergetics and elevated production of free radicals in cells. However, the exact mechanisms linking redox imbalance to neurodegeneration are still elusive. This review will focus on the current understanding of aberrant redox homeostasis in HD and potential therapeutic interventions.",Intradural Spinal Cord Stimulation: Performance Modeling of a New Modality.,https://www.ncbi.nlm.nih.gov/pubmed/30941012,Frontiers in neuroscience,2019 04 06,"Introduction: Intradural spinal cord stimulation (SCS) may offer significant therapeutic benefits for those with intractable axial and extremity pain, visceral pain, spasticity, autonomic dysfunction and related disorders. A novel intradural electrical stimulation device, limited by the boundaries of the thecal sac, CSF and spinal cord was developed to test this hypothesis. In order to optimize device function, we have explored finite element modeling (FEM). Methods: COMSOL®Multiphysics Electrical Currents was used to solve for fields and currents over a geometric model of a spinal cord segment. Cathodic and anodic currents are applied to the center and tips of the T-cross component of the electrode array to shape the stimulation field and constrain charge-balanced cathodic pulses to the target area. Results: Currents from the electrode sites can move the effective stimulation zone horizontally across the cord by a linear step method, which can be diversified considerably to gain greater depth of penetration relative to standard epidural SCS. It is also possible to prevent spread of the target area with no off-target action potential. Conclusion: Finite element modeling of a T-shaped intradural spinal cord stimulator predicts significant gains in field depth and current shaping that are beyond the reach of epidural stimulators. Future studies with in vivo models will investigate how this approach should first be tested in humans."

Despite being a rich source of potential biomarkers and targets for therapeutic advance, the dynamic changes occurring within the extracellular environment that are specific to GBM motility have yet to be fully resolved. The gap junction protein connexin43 (Cx43) increases glioma migration and invasion in a variety of in vitro and in vivo models. In this study, the upregulation of Cx43 in C6 glioma cells induced morphological changes and the secretion of proteins associated with cell motility. Demonstrating the selective engagement of ECM remodeling networks, secretome analysis revealed the near-binary increase of osteopontin and matrix metalloproteinase-3 (MMP3), with gelatinase and NFF-3 assays confirming the proteolytic activities. Informatic analysis of interactome and secretome downstream of Cx43 identifies networks of glioma motility that appear to be synergistically engaged.

The striking similarities in the processes of cancer and gastrulation have prompted speculation regarding the developmental pathways involved in their regulation. One of the fundamental requirements for the developmental pathways in gastrulation and cancer is the ability to respond to environmental stimuli, and it has been proposed that the Kaiso and noncanonical Wnt pathways participate in the mechanisms regulating these developmental pathways. In particular, these pathways might also explain the notable differences in invasive capacity between cancers of endodermal and mesodermal origins and cancers of ectodermal origin.

Neurology,2019 05 01,"Personalized treatment is ideal for multiple sclerosis (MS) owing to the heterogeneity of clinical features, but current knowledge gaps, including validation of biomarkers and treatment algorithms, limit practical implementation. The contemporary approach to personalized MS therapy depends on evidence-based prognostication, an initial treatment choice and evaluation of early treatment responses to identify the need to switch therapy. Prognostication is directed by baseline clinical, environmental and demographic factors, MRI measures and biomarkers that correlate with long-term disability measures. The initial treatment choice should be a shared decision between the patient and physician. In addition to prognosis, this choice must account for patient-related factors, including comorbidities, pregnancy planning, preferences of the patients and their comfort with risk, and drug-related factors, including safety, cost and implications for treatment sequencing. Treatment response has traditionally been assessed on the basis of relapse rate, MRI lesions and disability progression. Larger longitudinal data sets have enabled development of composite outcome measures and more stringent standards for disease control.

In particular, oxidation induced by cold atmospheric plasma (CAP) has demonstrated promising results in eliminating these toxic aggregates. In this paper, we investigate the effect of oxidation on the stability of an Aβ pentamer. By means of molecular dynamics simulations and umbrella sampling, we elucidate the conformational changes of Aβ pentamer in the presence of oxidized residues, and we estimate the dissociation free energy of the terminal peptide out of the pentamer form. The calculated dissociation free energy of the terminal peptide is also found to decrease with increasing oxidation. This indicates that Aβ pentamer aggregation becomes less favorable upon oxidation. Our study contributes to a better insight in one of the potential mechanisms for inhibition of toxic Aβ peptide aggregation, which is considered to be the main culprit to Alzheimer's disease.",Lytic and genomic properties of spontaneous host-range Kayvirus mutants prove their suitability for upgrading phage therapeutics against staphylococci.,https://www.ncbi.nlm.nih.gov/pubmed/30940900,Scientific reports,2019 04 07,"Lytic bacteriophages are valuable therapeutic agents against bacterial infections. There is continual effort to obtain new phages to increase the effectivity of phage preparations against emerging phage-resistant strains. Here we described the genomic diversity of spontaneous host-range mutants of kayvirus 812. Five mutant phages were isolated as rare plaques on phage-resistant Staphylococcus aureus strains. The host range of phage 812-derived mutants was 42% higher than the wild type, determined on a set of 186 methicillin-resistant S. aureus strains representing the globally circulating human and livestock-associated clones. Comparative genomics revealed that single-nucleotide polymorphisms from the parental phage 812 population were fixed in next-step mutants, mostly in genes for tail and baseplate components, and the acquired point mutations led to diverse receptor binding proteins in the phage mutants. Numerous genome changes associated with rearrangements between direct repeat motifs or intron loss were found. Alterations occurred in host-takeover and terminal genomic regions or the endolysin gene of mutants that exhibited the highest lytic activity, which implied various mechanisms of overcoming bacterial resistance. The genomic data revealed that Kayvirus spontaneous mutants are free from undesirable genes and their lytic properties proved their suitability for rapidly updating phage therapeutics.",Molecular characterization and epidemiology of Streptococcus pneumoniae serotype 24F in Denmark.,https://www.ncbi.nlm.nih.gov/pubmed/30940899,Scientific reports,2019 04 09,"Since 2012, have we in Denmark observed an increase of invasive pneumococcal infections (IPD) due to Streptococcus pneumoniae serotype 24F. We here present epidemiological data on 24F IPD cases, and characterization of 48 24F clinical isolates based on clonal relationship, antimicrobial resistance (AMR) determinants and virulence factors. IPD surveillance data from (1999-2016) were used to calculate the incidence and age-distribution of serotype 24F IPD and the effect of pneumococcal conjugated vaccines (PCV). Characterization of forty-eight 24F isolates (14.7% of all 24F isolates from the period) was based on whole-genome sequencing analysis (WGS). The IPD cases of serotype 24F showed a significant increase (p < 0.05) for all age groups after the PCV-13 introduction in 2010. The majority of tested 24F isolates consisted of two MLST types, i.e. the ST72 and the ST162. Serotype 24F IPD increased in Denmark after the PCV-13 introduction in parallel with an increase of the ST162 clone. The genotypic penicillin binding protein (PBP) profile agreed with the phenotypical penicillin susceptibility. The virulence genes lytA, ply, piaA, piaB, piaC, rspB and the cpsA/wzg were detected in all 24F isolates, while the pspA and zmpC genes were absent.","Low genetic diversity and shallow population structure in the endangered vulture, Gyps coprotheres.",https://www.ncbi.nlm.nih.gov/pubmed/30940898,Scientific reports,2019 04 07,"Globally, vulture species are experiencing major population declines. The southern African Cape vulture (Gyps coprotheres) has undergone severe population collapse which has led to a listing of Endangered by the IUCN. Here, a comprehensive genetic survey of G. coprotheres is conducted using microsatellite markers. Analyses revealed an overall reduction in heterozygosity compared to other vulture species that occur in South Africa (Gypaetus barbatus, Necrosyrtes monachus, and Gyps africanus). Bayesian clustering analysis and principal coordinate analysis identified shallow, subtle population structuring across South Africa. This provides some support for regional natal philopatry in this species. Despite recent reductions in population size, a genetic bottleneck was not detected by the genetic data. The G. coprotheres, however, did show a significant deficiency of overall heterozygosity. This, coupled with the elevated levels of inbreeding and reduced effective population size, suggests that G. coprotheres is genetically depauperate. Given that genetic variation is considered a prerequisite for adaptation and population health, the low genetic diversity within G. coprotheres populations is of concern and has implications for the future management and conservation of this species.",The use of spatially explicit genetic variation data from four deep-sea sponges to inform the protection of Vulnerable Marine Ecosystems.,https://www.ncbi.nlm.nih.gov/pubmed/30940897,Scientific reports,2019 04 07,"The United Nations General Assembly has called for greater protection of the world's deep-sea species and of features such as Vulnerable Marine Ecosystems (VMEs). Sponges are important components of VMEs and information about their spatially explicit genetic diversity can inform management decisions concerning the placement of protected areas. We employed a spatially explicit hierarchical testing framework to examine genetic variation amongst archived samples of four deep-sea sponges in the New Zealand region. For Poecillastra laminaris Sollas 1886, significant mitochondrial (COI, Cytb) and nuclear DNA (microsatellite) genetic differences were observed between provinces, amongst north-central-south regions and amongst geomorphic features. For Penares sp. no significant structure was detected (COI, 12S) across the same areas. For both Neoaulaxinia persicum Kelly, 2007 (COI, 12S) and Pleroma menoui Lévi & Lévi 1983 (COI) there was no evidence of genetic differentiation within their northern only regional distributions. Of 10 separate species-by-marker tests for isolation-by-distance and isolation-by-depth, only the isolation-by-depth test for N. persicum for COI was significant. The use of archived samples highlights how historical material may be used to support national and international management decisions. The results are discussed in the broader context of existing marine protected areas, and possible future design of spatial management measures for protecting VMEs in the New Zealand region.",Assessing yield gap in high productive countries by designing wheat ideotypes.,https://www.ncbi.nlm.nih.gov/pubmed/30940895,Scientific reports,2019 04 07,"Designing crop ideotypes in silico is a powerful tool to explore the crop yield potential and yield gap. We defined yield gap as the difference between yield potential of a crop ideotype optimized under local environment and yield of an existing cultivar under optimal management. Wheat ideotypes were designed for the current climate using the Sirius model for both water-limited and irrigated conditions in two high wheat-productive countries viz. the United Kingdom (UK) and New Zealand (NZ) with the objective of estimating yield gap. The mean ideotype yields of 15.0-19.0 t ha-1 were achieved in water-limited conditions in the UK and NZ, whereas 15.6-19.5 t ha-1 under irrigated conditions. Substantial yield gaps were found in both water-limited, 28-31% (4-6 t ha-1), and irrigated conditions, 30-32% (5-6 t ha-1) in the UK and NZ. Both yield potential (25-27%) and yield gap (32-38%) were greater in NZ than the UK. Ideotype design is generic and could apply globally for estimating yield gap. Despite wheat breeding efforts, the considerable yield gap still potentially exists in high productive countries such as the UK and NZ. To accelerate breeding, wheat ideotypes can provide the key traits for wheat improvement and closing the yield gap.",Publisher Correction: Memristive crossbar arrays for brain-inspired computing.,https://www.ncbi.nlm.nih.gov/pubmed/30940894,Nature materials,2019 04 25,An amendment to this paper has been published and can be accessed via a link at the top of the paper.,An innovation for microstructural modification and mechanical improvement of TiAl alloy via electric current application.,https://www.ncbi.nlm.nih.gov/pubmed/30940893,Scientific reports,2019 04 07,"In this article, microstructural evolution during the solidification of Ti-48Al-2Cr-2Nb with current density, as well as the formation mechanisms, are discussed, along with the impacts on microhardness and hot compression properties. The applied electric current promotes the solidification from the α primary phase to a largely β solidification in Ti-48Al-2Cr-2Nb. With an increase in supercooling, the solidification process have a tendency to change from an α-led primary phase to (α + β)-led primary phase. The primary dendrites, grain size, and lamellar spacing show a tendency to decrease first before increasing with increasing current density. Microhardness and high-temperature yield strength increase with a decrease in primary dendrite spacing, grain size, and lamellar spacing. Correlations between primary dendrite spacing, lamellar spacing, microhardness, yield strength, and current density are described by a fitting formula. An increase of α2 phase, due to the application of electric current, results in improved microhardness. The yield strength of Ti-48Al-2Cr-2Nb alloy increases linearly with microhardness. Yield stress increases with a decrease in microstructure parameters, in accordance with the Hall-Petch equation. The predominant modification mechanism with electric current application for TiAl solidification is the variation of supercooling and temperature gradients ahead of the mush zone due to Joule heating.",Group size effects and critical mass in public goods games.,https://www.ncbi.nlm.nih.gov/pubmed/30940892,Scientific reports,2019 04 07,"Understanding whether the size of the interacting group has an effect on cooperative behavior has been a major topic of debate since the seminal works on cooperation in the 1960s. Half a century later, scholars have yet to reach a consensus, with some arguing that cooperation is harder in larger groups, while others that cooperation is easier in larger groups, and yet others that cooperation attains its maximum in intermediate size groups. Here we add to this field of work by reporting a two-treatment empirical study where subjects play a Public Goods Game with a Critical Mass, such that the return for full cooperation increases linearly for early contributions and then stabilizes after a critical mass is reached (the two treatments differ only on the critical mass). We choose this game for two reasons: it has been argued that it approximates real-life social dilemmas; previous work suggests that, in this case, group size might have an inverted-U effect on cooperation, where the pick of cooperation is reached around the critical mass. Our main innovation with respect to previous experiments is that we implement a within-subject design, such that the same subject plays in groups of different size (from 5 to 40 subjects). Groups are formed at random at every round and there is no feedback. This allows us to explore if and how subjects change their choice as a function of the size of the group. We report three main results, which partially contrast what has been suggested by previous work: in our setting (i) the critical mass has no effect on cooperation; (ii) group size has a positive effect on cooperation; (iii) the most chosen option (played by about 50% of the subjects) is All Defection, followed by All Cooperation (about 10% of the subjects), whereas the rest have a slight trend to switch preferentially from defection to cooperation as the group size increases."

Mitochondria are important for intracellular calcium handling and signaling. Mitochondrial calcium uniporter (mtCU) is a multiprotein complex of the mitochondrial inner membrane responsible for the transport of calcium to the mitochondrial matrix. In the present study, we analyzed the expression level of mtCU components in two parts of the feto-maternal system - placenta and myometrium at full-term delivery and at preterm birth (PTB) on different stages: 22-27, 28-32, 33-36 weeks of gestation (n = 50). A gradual increase of mRNA expression and changes in protein content of MCU and MICU1 subunits were revealed in the placenta during gestation. We also observed slower depolarization rate of isolated placental mitochondria induced by Ca2+ titration at PTB. In myometrium at PTB relative gene expression level of MCU, MCUb and SMDT1 increased as compared to full-term pregnancy, but the tendency to gradual increase of MCU protein simultaneous with MCUb increase and MICU1 decline was shown in gestational dynamics. Changes observed in the present study might be considered both natural dynamics as well as possible pathological mechanisms underlying preterm birth.",Inhibition of microRNA-495 suppresses chondrocyte apoptosis through activation of the NF-κB signaling pathway by regulating CCL4 in osteoarthritis.,https://www.ncbi.nlm.nih.gov/pubmed/30940879,Gene therapy,2019 04 03,"As a common form of arthritis, osteoarthritis (OA) represents a degenerative disease, characterized by articular cartilage damage and synovium inflammation. Recently, the role of various microRNAs (miRs) and their specific expression in OA has been highlighted. Therefore, the aim of the current study was to elucidate the role by which miR-495 and chemokine ligand 4 (CCL4) influence the development and progression of OA. OA mice models were established, after which the CCL4 and collagen levels as well as cell apoptosis were determined in cartilage tissue of OA mice. The chondrocytes of the OA mice models were subsequently treated with a series of miR-495 mimic, inhibitor, and siRNA against CCL4. Afterwards, miR-495 expressions as well as the levels of CCL4, p50, p65, and IkBa and the extent of IkBa phosphorylation in addition to the luciferase activity of NF-kB were measured accordingly. Finally, cell apoptosis and cell cycle distribution were detected. miR-495 was highly expressed while NF-κB, CCL4, and collagen II were poorly expressed. Cell apoptosis was elevated in the cartilage tissue of the OA mice. CCL4 was a potential target gene of miR-495. Downregulation of miR-495 led to accelerated chondrocyte proliferation accompanied by diminished cell apoptosis among the OA mice. Taken together, the results of the current study demonstrated that inhibition of miR-495 suppressed chondrocyte apoptosis and promoted its proliferation through activation of the NF-κB signaling pathway by up-regulation of CCL4 in OA.",Antibacterial Activity of combinatorial treatments composed of transition-metal/antibiotics against Mycobacterium tuberculosis.,https://www.ncbi.nlm.nih.gov/pubmed/30940878,Scientific reports,2019 04 07,"Notwithstanding evidence that tuberculosis (TB) is declining, one of the greatest concerns to public health is the emergence and spread of multi-drug resistant strains of Mycobacterium tuberculosis (MDR-TB). MDR-TB are defined as strains which are resistant to at least isoniazid (INH) and rifampicin, the two most potent TB drugs, and their increasing incidence is a serious concern. Recently, notable efforts have been spent on research to pursue novel treatments against MDR-TB, especially on synergistic drug combinations as they have the potential to improve TB treatment. Our research group has previously reported promising synergistic antimicrobial effects between transition-metal compounds and antibiotics in Gram-negative and Gram-positive bacteria. In this work, we evaluated antimycobacterial activity of transition-metals/antibiotics combinatorial treatments against first-line drug resistant strains of Mycobacterium tuberculosis. Our data showed that INH/AgNO3 combinatorial treatment had an additive effect (bactericidal activity) in an isoniazid-resistant clinical strain of Mycobacterium tuberculosis. Moreover, in vitro evaluation of cytotoxicity induced by both, the individual tratments of AgNO3 and INH and the combinatorial treatment of INH/AgNO3 in murine RAW 264.7 macrophages and human A549 lung cells; showed no toxic effects. Together, this data suggests that the INH/AgNO3 combinatorial treatment could be used in the development of new strategies to treat resistant strains of Mycobacterium tuberculosis.",Synergic effect of adsorbed gas and charging on surface flashover.,https://www.ncbi.nlm.nih.gov/pubmed/30940877,Scientific reports,2019 04 07,"Flashover is a crucial issue in both high-voltage engineering and surface physics. It not only challenges the existing theories about its dynamic evolution, but also inhibits the clean energy revolution by limiting the accessible voltage rating of power equipment. It is of significance to elucidate the microscopic process along the interface to improve the flashover performance. In the present study, the synergic effect of adsorbed gas and surface charging is investigated, which reveals a long ignored factor for determining the flashover voltage. Depending on the relative amount of adsorbed gas, the flashover voltage varies, which exhibit different behavior from the bulk breakdown of the same gas. The amount of N2 gas adsorbed on epoxy resin (EP) surface is much larger than that on Al2O3 ceramic surface, corresponding to the observed higher flashover voltage on EP. It is proposed that the adsorbed gas molecules not only modify the local surface charging state via their interaction with the trapped charges, but also capture free electrons due to the distortion of their electronic distribution. Both effects suppress the free path length of electrons in the gas-solid interface. This work explores another possibility to improve the surface flashover performance.",LKB1 expressed in dendritic cells governs the development and expansion of thymus-derived regulatory T cells.,https://www.ncbi.nlm.nih.gov/pubmed/30940876,Cell research,2019 04 30,"Liver Kinase B1 (LKB1) plays a key role in cellular metabolism by controlling AMPK activation. However, its function in dendritic cell (DC) biology has not been addressed. Here, we find that LKB1 functions as a critical brake on DC immunogenicity, and when lost, leads to reduced mitochondrial fitness and increased maturation, migration, and T cell priming of peripheral DCs. Concurrently, loss of LKB1 in DCs enhances their capacity to promote output of regulatory T cells (Tregs) from the thymus, which dominates the outcome of peripheral immune responses, as suggested by increased resistance to asthma and higher susceptibility to cancer in CD11cΔLKB1 mice. Mechanistically, we find that loss of LKB1 specifically primes thymic CD11b+ DCs to facilitate thymic Treg development and expansion, which is independent from AMPK signalling, but dependent on mTOR and enhanced phospholipase C β1-driven CD86 expression. Together, our results identify LKB1 as a critical regulator of DC-driven effector T cell and Treg responses both in the periphery and the thymus.",Body odors (even when masked) make you more emotional: behavioral and neural insights.,https://www.ncbi.nlm.nih.gov/pubmed/30940875,Scientific reports,2019 04 07,"Morality evolved within specific social contexts that are argued to shape moral choices. In turn, moral choices are hypothesized to be affected by body odors as they powerfully convey socially-relevant information. We thus investigated the neural underpinnings of the possible body odors effect on the participants' decisions. In an fMRI study we presented to healthy individuals 64 moral dilemmas divided in incongruent (real) and congruent (fake) moral dilemmas, using different types of harm (intentional: instrumental dilemmas, or inadvertent: accidental dilemmas). Participants were required to choose deontological or utilitarian actions under the exposure to a neutral fragrance (masker) or body odors concealed by the same masker (masked body odor). Smelling the masked body odor while processing incongruent (not congruent) dilemmas activates the supramarginal gyrus, consistent with an increase in prosocial attitude. When processing accidental (not instrumental) dilemmas, smelling the masked body odor activates the angular gyrus, an area associated with the processing of people's presence, supporting the hypothesis that body odors enhance the saliency of the social context in moral scenarios. These results suggest that masked body odors can influence moral choices by increasing the emotional experience during the decision process, and further explain how sensory unconscious biases affect human behavior.","Yersinia pestis and plague: an updated view on evolution, virulence determinants, immune subversion, vaccination, and diagnostics.",https://www.ncbi.nlm.nih.gov/pubmed/30940874,Genes and immunity,2019 05 11,"Plague is a vector-borne disease caused by Yersinia pestis. Transmitted by fleas from rodent reservoirs, Y. pestis emerged <6000 years ago from an enteric bacterial ancestor through events of gene gain and genome reduction. It is a highly remarkable model for the understanding of pathogenic bacteria evolution, and a major concern for public health as highlighted by recent human outbreaks. A complex set of virulence determinants, including the Yersinia outer-membrane proteins (Yops), the broad-range protease Pla, pathogen-associated molecular patterns (PAMPs), and iron capture systems play critical roles in the molecular strategies that Y. pestis employs to subvert the human immune system, allowing unrestricted bacterial replication in lymph nodes (bubonic plague) and in lungs (pneumonic plague). Some of these immunogenic proteins as well as the capsular antigen F1 are exploited for diagnostic purposes, which are critical in the context of the rapid onset of death in the absence of antibiotic treatment (less than a week for bubonic plague and <48 h for pneumonic plague). Here, we review recent research advances on Y. pestis evolution, virulence factor function, bacterial strategies to subvert mammalian innate immune responses, vaccination, and problems associated with pneumonic plague diagnosis.",Eutectic modification by ternary compound cluster formation in Al-Si alloys.,https://www.ncbi.nlm.nih.gov/pubmed/30940873,Scientific reports,2019 04 07,"Al-alloys with Si as the main alloying element constitute the vast majority of Al castings used commercially today. The eutectic Si microstructure in these alloys can be modified from plate-like to coral-like by the addition of a small amount of a third element to improve ductility and toughness. In this investigation the effects of Eu and Yb are studied and their influence on the microstructure is compared to further understand this modification. The two elements impact the alloy differently, where Eu modifies Si into a coral-like structure while Yb does not. Atom probe tomography shows that Eu is present within the Si phase in the form of ternary compound Al2Si2Eu clusters, while Yb is absent in the Si phase. This indicates that the presence of ternary compound clusters within Si is a necessary condition for the formation of a coral-like structure. A crystallographic orientation relationship between Si and the Al2Si2Eu phase was found, where the following plane normals are parallel: 011Si//0001Al2Si2Eu, 111Si//6[Formula: see text]10Al2Si2Eu and 011Si//6[Formula: see text]10Al2Si2Eu. No crystallographic relationship was found between Si and Al2Si2Yb. The heterogeneous formation of coherent Al2Si2Eu clusters inside the Si-phase is suggested to trigger the modification of the microstructure.",Halve the dose while maintaining image quality in paediatric Cone Beam CT.,https://www.ncbi.nlm.nih.gov/pubmed/30940872,Scientific reports,2019 04 07,"Cone beam CT (CBCT) for dentomaxillofacial paediatric assessment has been widely used despite the uncertainties of the risks of the low-dose radiation exposures. The aim of this work was to investigate the clinical performance of different CBCT acquisition protocols towards the optimization of paediatric exposures. Custom-made anthropomorphic phantoms were scanned using a CBCT unit in six protocols. CT slices were blinded, randomized and presented to three observers, who scored the image quality using a 4-point scale along with their level of confidence. Sharpness level was also measured using a test object containing an air/PMMA e,dge. The effective dose was calculated by means of a customized Monte Carlo (MC) framework using previously validated paediatric voxels models. The results have shown that the protocols set with smaller voxel size (180 µm), even when decreasing exposure parameters (kVp and mAs), showed high image quality scores and increased sharpness. The MC analysis showed a gradual decrease in effective dose when exposures parameters were reduced, with an emphasis on an average reduction of 45% for the protocol that combined 70 kVp, 16 mAs and 180 µm voxel size. In contrast, both ""ultra-low dose"" protocols that combined a larger voxel size (400 µm) with lower mAs (7.4 mAs) demonstrated the lowest scores with high levels of confidence unsuitable for an anatomical approach. In conclusion, a significant decrease in the effective dose can be achieved while maintaining the image quality required for paediatric CBCT.","Potassium doping increases biochar carbon sequestration potential by 45%, facilitating decoupling of carbon sequestration from soil improvement.",https://www.ncbi.nlm.nih.gov/pubmed/30940871,Scientific reports,2019 04 09,"Negative emissions technologies offer an important tool to limit the global warming to <2 °C. Biochar is one of only a few such technologies, and the one at highest technology readiness level. Here we show that potassium as a low-concentration additive in biochar production can increase biochar's carbon sequestration potential; by up to 45% in this study. This translates to an increase in the estimated global biochar carbon sequestration potential to over 2.6 Gt CO2-C(eq) yr-1, thus boosting the efficiency of utilisation of limited biomass and land resources, and considerably improving the economics of biochar production and atmospheric carbon sequestration. In addition, potassium doping also increases plant nutrient content of resulting biochar, making it better suited for agricultural applications. Yet, more importantly, due to its much higher carbon sequestration potential, AM-enriched biochar facilitates viable biochar deployment for carbon sequestration purposes with reduced need to rely on biochar's abilities to improve soil properties and crop yields, hence opening new potential areas and scenarios for biochar applications."

Here, we investigated the effects of corrupted, and hence unreliable, feedback on perceptual inference. Within the framework of Bayesian inference, we hypothesised that corrupting feedback in a demanding perceptual task would compromise sensory information processing and bias inference towards prior information if available. These hypotheses were examined by a simulation and in two behavioural experiments with visual detection (experiment 1) and discrimination (experiment 2) tasks. Both experiments consisted of two sessions comprising intervention runs with either corrupted or uncorrupted (correct) feedback, and pre- and post-intervention tests to assess the effects of feedback. In the tests alone, additional prior beliefs were induced through predictive auditory cues to assess sustained effects of feedback on the balance between sensory evidence and prior beliefs. Both experiments and the simulation showed the hypothesised decrease in performance and increased reliance on prior beliefs after corrupted but not uncorrupted feedback. Exploratory analyses indicated reduced confidence regarding perceptual decisions during delivery of corrupted feedback. Our results suggest that corrupted feedback on perceptual decisions leads to sustained changes in perceptual inference, characterised by a shift from sensory likelihood to prior beliefs when those are accessible.",Concurrent climate extremes in the key wheat producing regions of the world.,https://www.ncbi.nlm.nih.gov/pubmed/30940858,Scientific reports,2019 04 07,"Climate extremes have profound impacts on key socio-economic sectors such as agriculture. In a changing climate context, characterised by an intensification of these extremes and where the population is expected to grow, exposure and vulnerability must be accurately assessed. However, most risk assessments analyse extremes independently, thus potentially being overconfident in the resilience of the socio-economic sectors. Here, we propose a novel approach to defining and characterising concurrent climate extremes (i.e. extremes occurring within a specific temporal lag), which is able to identify spatio-temporal dependences without making any strict assumptions. The method is applied to large-scale heat stress and drought events in the key wheat producing regions of the world, as these extremes can cause serious yield losses and thus trigger market shocks. Wheat regions likely to have concurrent extremes (heat stress and drought events) are identified, as well as regions independent of each other or inhibiting each other in terms of these extreme events. This tool may be integrated in all risk assessments but could also be used to explore global climate teleconnections.",Somatosensory-guided tool use modifies arm representation for action.,https://www.ncbi.nlm.nih.gov/pubmed/30940857,Scientific reports,2019 04 07,"Tool-use changes both peripersonal space and body representations, with several effects being nowadays termed tool embodiment. Since somatosensation was typically accompanied by vision in most previous tool use studies, whether somatosensation alone is sufficient for tool embodiment remains unknown. Here we address this question via a task assessing arm length representation at an implicit level. Namely, we compared movement's kinematics in blindfolded healthy participants when grasping an object before and after tool-use. Results showed longer latencies and smaller peaks in the arm transport component after tool-use, consistent with an increased length of arm representation. No changes were found in the hand grip component and correlations revealed similar kinematic signatures in naturally long-armed participants. Kinematics changes did not interact with target object position, further corroborating the finding that somatosensory-guided tool use may increase the represented size of the participants' arm. Control experiments ruled out alternative interpretations based upon altered hand position sense. In addition, our findings indicate that tool-use effects are specific for the implicit level of arm representation, as no effect was observed on the explicit estimate of the forearm length. These findings demonstrate for the first time that somatosensation is sufficient for incorporating a tool that has never been seen, nor used before.",A generalized model for combining dependent SNP-level summary statistics and its extensions to statistics of other levels.,https://www.ncbi.nlm.nih.gov/pubmed/30940856,Scientific reports,2019 04 07,"Here I propose a fundamentally new flexible model to reveal the association between a trait and a set of genetic variants in a genomic region/gene. This model was developed for the situation when original individual-level phenotype and genotype data are not available, but the researcher possesses the results of statistical analyses conducted on these data (namely, SNP-level summary Z score statistics and SNP-by-SNP correlations). The new model was analytically derived from the classical multiple linear regression model applied for the region-based association analysis of individual-level phenotype and genotype data by using the linear compression of data, where the SNP-by-SNP correlations are among the explanatory variables, and the summary Z score statistics are categorized as the response variables. I analytically show that the regional association analysis methods developed within the framework of the classical multiple linear regression model with additive effects of genetic variants can be reformulated in terms of the new model without the loss of information. The results obtained from the regional association analysis utilizing the classical model and those derived using the proposed model are identical when SNP-by-SNP correlations and SNP-level statistics are estimated from the same genetic data.",Molecular and Structural Characterization of MHC Class II β Genes Reveals High Diversity in the Cold-Adapted Icefish Chionodraco hamatus.,https://www.ncbi.nlm.nih.gov/pubmed/30940855,Scientific reports,2019 04 07,"This study reports the presence of two distinct MHC class II β genes in the Antarctic icefish Chionodraco hamatus, belonging to the classical (ChhaDAB) and nonclassical (ChhaDBB) evolutionary lineages. By the application of targeted sequencing approach, a remarkable molecular diversity in the exon 2 sequence of the highly expressed gene ChhaDAB has been observed, resulting in an estimate of 92 different variants translated in 87 different peptides from 54 analysed icefish individuals. A highly conservative estimate, based on a 95% sequence identity threshold clustering, translate this variability in 41 different peptide clusters belonging to four different clades and showing the signature of different kinds of selection. In stark contrast, the poorly expressed ChhaDBB gene displayed a very low level of molecular diversity within exon 2, in agreement with expectations for a nonclassical MHC class II β gene.",Novel avian paramyxovirus-based vaccine vectors expressing the Ebola virus glycoprotein elicit mucosal and humoral immune responses in guinea pigs.,https://www.ncbi.nlm.nih.gov/pubmed/30940854,Scientific reports,2019 04 07,"Paramyxovirus vaccine vectors based on human parainfluenza virus type 3 (HPIV-3) and Newcastle disease virus (NDV) have been previously evaluated against Ebola virus (EBOV) challenge. Although both the viral vectored vaccines efficiently induce protective immunity, some concerns remain to be solved. Since HPIV-3 is a common human pathogen, the human population has pre-existing immunity to HPIV-3, which may restrict the replication of the vaccine vector. For NDV, mesogenic (intermediate virulent) strain used in previous studies is currently classified as a Select Agent in the United States, thus making it unsuitable to be used as a vaccine vector. To overcome these concerns, we have developed a modified NDV vector based on a mesogenic NDV strain, in which the ectodomains of envelope glycoproteins were replaced with the corresponding ectodomains from avian paramyxovirus serotype 3 (APMV-3). The modified NDV vector was highly attenuated in chickens and was able to express the EBOV glycoprotein (GP) gene at high level. In addition, the recombinant APMV-3 was also evaluated as a vaccine vector to express the EBOV GP gene. Guinea pigs immunized with these two vector vaccines developed high levels of neutralizing GP-specific IgG and IgA antibodies.",Mitochondrial DNA mutations and respiratory chain dysfunction in idiopathic and connective tissue disease-related lung fibrosis.,https://www.ncbi.nlm.nih.gov/pubmed/30940853,Scientific reports,2019 04 07,"Reactive oxygen species (ROS) are implicated in the aetiology of interstitial lung disease (ILD). We investigated the role of large-scale somatically acquired mutations in mitochondrial DNA (mtDNA) and consecutive respiratory chain dysfunction as a trigger of ROS-formation and lung fibrosis. Mitochondria were analysed in lung biopsies from 30 patients with idiopathic or connective tissue disease (CTD)-related ILD and 13 controls. In 17 patients we had paired biopsies from upper and lower lobes. Control samples were taken from lung cancer resections without interstitial fibrosis. Malondialdehyde, a marker of ROS-formation, was elevated in ILD-biopsies (p = 0.044). The activity of the mitochondrial respiratory chain (cytochrome c-oxidase/succinate dehydrogenase [COX/SDH]-ratio) was depressed in ILD (median = 0.10,) compared with controls (0.12, p < 0.001), as was the expression of mtDNA-encoded COX-subunit-2 protein normalized for the nucleus-encoded COX-subunit-4 (COX2/COX4-ratio; ILD-median = 0.6; controls = 2.2; p < 0.001). Wild-type mtDNA copies were slightly elevated in ILD (p = 0.088). The common mtDNA deletion was only present at low levels in controls (median = 0%) and at high levels in ILD (median = 17%; p < 0.001). In ILD-lungs with paired biopsies, lower lobes contained more malondialdehyde and mtDNA deletions than upper lobes and had lower COX2/COX4-ratios and COX/SDH-ratios (all p < 0.001). Acquired mtDNA-mutations and consecutive respiratory chain dysfunction may both trigger and perpetuate ROS-formation in ILD.",On the influence of relative humidity on the oxidation and hydrolysis of fresh and aged oil paints.,https://www.ncbi.nlm.nih.gov/pubmed/30940852,Scientific reports,2019 04 07,"Modern oil paintings are affected by conservation issues related to the oil paint formulations and to the fact that they are often unvarnished, and in direct contact with the environment. Understanding the evolution of the molecular composition of modern oil paint during ageing, under the influence of environmental factors, is fundamental for a better knowledge of degradation phenomena and risk factors affecting modern art. We investigated for the first time the influence of relative humidity on the chemical composition of modern oil paints during curing and artificial ageing. For this purpose, modern oil paint layers naturally aged for 10 years were further artificially aged in low and high relative humidity conditions. Moreover, the influence of RH% on the curing of fresh paint layers was studied. The paints used in the experiments are from three suppliers (Old Holland, Winsor&Newton, and Talens), and contain cadmium or cadmium zinc sulfide as main pigment. The changes in the composition of extracts of paint samples were investigated by direct electrospray mass spectrometry with a quadrupole-time of flight mass analyser (ESI-Q-ToF). The obtained mass spectral data were interpreted by means of principal component analysis (PCA) operated on a data set containing the relative abundance of ions associated to significant molecules present in the extracts, and also by calculating the ratios between the signals relative to fatty acids, dicarboxylic acids and acylglycerols, related to hydrolysis and oxidation phenomena. The same paint samples were also analysed, in bulk, by pyrolysis gas chromatography mass spectrometry (Py-GC/MS), achieving chemical information on the total lipid fraction. High performance liquid chromatography (HPLC) ESI-Q-ToF was carried out for the characterisation of the profile of free fatty acids (FFA) and acylglycerols, defining the nature of the oils used in the paint formulations, and for the determination of the degree of hydrolysis. This study demonstrated that relative humidity conditions significantly influence the chemical composition of the paints. Ageing under high RH% conditions produced an increase of the formation of dicarboxylic acids compared to ageing under low RH%, for all paints, in addition to a higher degree of hydrolysis, followed by evaporation of free fatty acids.",Association of body composition with predicted hip bone strength among Chinese postmenopausal women: a longitudinal study.,https://www.ncbi.nlm.nih.gov/pubmed/30940851,Scientific reports,2019 04 07,"Body composition and bone strength are closely associated. How lean mass (LM) and fat mass (FM) contribute to bone strength remains ambiguous. We investigated the associations of total body LM and FM with changes in predicted hip bone strength over a period of 3 years in 1,743 postmenopausal Chinese women from the communities of Guangzhou, China. The body compositions of the women were obtained with dual-energy X-ray absorptiometry. We used the hip structure analysis program to obtain the bone parameters at the femoral neck region, including the bone mineral density (BMD), cross-sectional area (CSA), cortical thickness (CT), section modulus (SM) and buckling ratio (BR). We found the FM and LM were positive predictors for hip bone strength (β > 0, P < 0.05). The LM had a larger contribution to the BMD, CSA, CT, SM and/or their annual percent changes (βLM > βFM), while the contribution of FM to the BR and its annual percent change was higher than LM (|βFM| > |βLM|). Further analysis found that the associations of FM and LM with bone parameters were stronger in the underweight and normal weight participants (|βBMI1| > |βBMI2|). Overall, FM and LM had positive but differential effects on predicted hip bone strength, with a higher impact in the thinner participants.",Humans best judge how much to cooperate when facing hard problems in large groups.,https://www.ncbi.nlm.nih.gov/pubmed/30940850,Scientific reports,2019 04 07,"We report the results of a game-theoretic experiment with human players who solve problems of increasing complexity by cooperating in groups of increasing size. Our experimental environment is set up to make it complicated for players to use rational calculation for making the cooperative decisions. This environment is directly translated into a computer simulation, from which we extract the collaboration strategy that leads to the maximal attainable score. Based on this, we measure the error that players make when estimating the benefits of collaboration, and find that humans massively underestimate these benefits when facing easy problems or working alone or in small groups. In contrast, when confronting hard problems or collaborating in large groups, humans accurately judge the best level of collaboration and easily achieve the maximal score. Our findings are independent on groups' composition and players' personal traits. We interpret them as varying degrees of usefulness of social heuristics, which seems to depend on the size of the involved group and the complexity of the situation."

In this study, we investigated the thermoregulation of B. seminalis TC3.4.2R3 at 28 °C (environmental stimulus) and 37 °C (host-associated stimulus) at the transcriptional and phenotypic levels. The production of biofilms and exopolysaccharides such as capsular polysaccharides and the biocontrol of phytopathogenic fungi were enhanced at 28 °C. At 37 °C, several metabolic pathways were activated, particularly those implicated in energy production, stress responses and the biosynthesis of transporters. Motility, growth and virulence in the Galleria mellonella larvae infection model were more significant at 37 °C. Our data suggest that the regulation of capsule expression could be important in virulence against G. mellonella larvae at 37 °C. In contrast, B. seminalis TC3.4.2R3 failed to cause death in infected BALB/c mice, even at an infective dose of 107 CFU.mL-1. We conclude that temperature drives the regulation of gene expression in B. seminalis during its interactions with the environment.",MOMSense: Metal-Oxide-Metal Elementary Glucose Sensor.,https://www.ncbi.nlm.nih.gov/pubmed/30940837,Scientific reports,2019 04 07,"In this paper, we present a novel Pt/CuO/Pt metal-oxide-metal (MOM) glucose sensor. The devices are fabricated using a simple, low-cost standard photolithography process. The unique planar structure of the device provides a large electrochemically active surface area, which acts as a nonenzymatic reservoir for glucose oxidation. The sensor has a linear sensing range between 2.2 mM and 10 mM of glucose concentration, which covers the blood glucose levels for an adult human. The distinguishing property of this sensor is its ability to measure glucose at neutral pH conditions (i.e. pH = 7). Furthermore, the dilution step commonly needed for CuO-based nonenzymatic electrochemical sensors to achieve an alkaline medium, which is essential to perform redox reactions in the absence of glucose oxidase, is eliminated, resulting in a lower-cost and more compact device.",Functional detection of botulinum neurotoxin serotypes A to F by monoclonal neoepitope-specific antibodies and suspension array technology.,https://www.ncbi.nlm.nih.gov/pubmed/30940836,Scientific reports,2019 04 07,"Botulinum neurotoxins (BoNTs) are the most potent toxins known and cause the life threatening disease botulism. Sensitive and broad detection is extremely challenging due to the toxins' high potency and molecular heterogeneity with several serotypes and more than 40 subtypes. The toxicity of BoNT is mediated by enzymatic cleavage of different synaptic proteins involved in neurotransmitter release at serotype-specific cleavage sites. Hence, active BoNTs can be monitored and distinguished in vitro by detecting their substrate cleavage products. In this work, we developed a comprehensive panel of monoclonal neoepitope antibodies (Neo-mAbs) highly specific for the newly generated N- and/or C-termini of the substrate cleavage products of BoNT serotypes A to F. The Neo-mAbs were implemented in a set of three enzymatic assays for the simultaneous detection of two BoNT serotypes each by monitoring substrate cleavage on colour-coded magnetic Luminex-beads. For the first time, all relevant serotypes could be detected in parallel by a routine in vitro activity assay in spiked serum and food samples yielding excellent detection limits in the range of the mouse bioassay or better (0.3-80 pg/mL). Therefore, this work represents a major step towards the replacement of the mouse bioassay for botulism diagnostics.",Synthetic standard aided quantification and structural characterization of amyloid-beta glycopeptides enriched from cerebrospinal fluid of Alzheimer's disease patients.,https://www.ncbi.nlm.nih.gov/pubmed/30940835,Scientific reports,2019 04 07,"An early pathological hallmark of Alzheimer's disease (AD) is amyloid-β (Aβ) deposits in the brain, which largely consist of up to 43 amino acids long Aβ peptides derived from the amyloid precursor protein (APP). We previously identified a series of sialylated Tyr-10 O-glycosylated Aβ peptides, 15-20 residues long, from human cerebrospinal fluid (CSF) and observed a relative increase of those in AD vs non-AD patients. We report here on the synthesis and use of an isotopically double-labeled Aβ1-15 glycopeptide, carrying the core 1 Galβ3GalNAcα1-O-Tyr-10 structure, to (1) identify by HCD LC-MS/MS the definite glycan core 1 structure of immunopurified and desialylated Aβ glycopeptides in human CSF and to (2) establish a LC-MS/MS quantification method for desialylated Aβ1-15 (and Aβ1-17) glycopeptides and to (3) compare the concentrations of these Aβ glycopeptides in CSF from 20 AD patients and 20 healthy controls. Although we unambiguously identified the core 1 structures and Tyr-10 attachment sites of the glycopeptides, we did not observe any quantitative differences, determined through both peptide and oxonium ion fragments, of the desialylated Aβ1-15 or Aβ1-17 glycopeptides between the AD and non-AD group. The new quantitative glycoproteomic approach described, using double-labeled glycopeptide standards, will undoubtedly facilitate future studies of glycopeptides as clinical biomarkers but should also embrace sialylated Aβ standards to reveal specific sialylation patterns of individual Aβ glycopeptides in AD patients and controls.",Life-long reduction in myomiR expression does not adversely affect skeletal muscle morphology.,https://www.ncbi.nlm.nih.gov/pubmed/30940834,Scientific reports,2019 04 07,"We generated an inducible, skeletal muscle-specific Dicer knockout mouse to deplete microRNAs in adult skeletal muscle. Following tamoxifen treatment, Dicer mRNA expression was significantly decreased by 87%. Wild-type (WT) and Dicer knockout (KO) mice were subjected to either synergist ablation or hind limb suspension for two weeks. There was no difference in muscle weight with hypertrophy or atrophy between WT and KO groups; however, even with the significant loss of Dicer expression, myomiR (miR-1, -133a and -206) expression was only reduced by 38% on average. We next aged WT and KO mice for ~22 months following Dicer inactivation to determine if myomiR expression would be further reduced over a prolonged timeframe and assess the effects of myomiR depletion on skeletal muscle phenotype. Skeletal muscle Dicer mRNA expression remained significantly decreased by 80% in old KO mice and sequencing of cloned Dicer mRNA revealed the complete absence of the floxed exons in KO skeletal muscle. Despite a further reduction of myomiR expression to ~50% of WT, no change was observed in muscle morphology between WT and KO groups. These results indicate the life-long reduction in myomiR levels did not adversely affect skeletal muscle phenotype and suggest the possibility that microRNA expression is uniquely regulated in skeletal muscle.","A prospective randomized, double-blind, placebo-controlled, dose-response relationship study to investigate efficacy of fructo-oligosaccharides (FOS) on human gut microflora.",https://www.ncbi.nlm.nih.gov/pubmed/30940833,Scientific reports,2019 04 07,"Fructo-oligosaccharides (FOS), a prebiotic supplement, is known for its Bifidogenic capabilities. However, aspects such as effect of variable quantities of FOS intake on gut microbiota, and temporal dynamics of gut microbiota (transitioning through basal, dosage, and follow-up phases) has not been studied in detail. This study investigated these aspects through a randomized, double-blind, placebo-controlled, dose-response relationship study. The study involved 80 participants being administered FOS at three dose levels (2.5, 5, and 10 g/day) or placebo (Maltodextrin 10 g/day) during dosage phase. Microbial DNA extracted from fecal samples collected at 9 intervening time-points was sequenced and analysed. Results indicate that FOS consumption increased the relative abundance of OTUs belonging to Bifidobacterium and Lactobacillus. Interestingly, higher FOS dosage appears to promote, in contrast to Maltodextrin, the selective proliferation of OTUs belonging to Lactobacillus. While consumption of prebiotics increased bacterial diversity, withdrawal led to its reduction. Apart from probiotic bacteria, a significant change was also observed in certain butyrate-producing microbes like Faecalibacterium, Ruminococcus and Oscillospira. The positive impact of FOS on butyrate-producing bacteria and FOS-mediated increased bacterial diversity reinforces the role of prebiotics in conferring beneficial functions to the host.",Meta-path Based Prioritization of Functional Drug Actions with Multi-Level Biological Networks.,https://www.ncbi.nlm.nih.gov/pubmed/30940832,Scientific reports,2019 04 07,"Functional drug actions refer to drug-affected GO terms. They aid in the investigation of drug effects that are therapeutic or adverse. Previous studies have utilized the linkage information between drugs and functions in molecular level biological networks. Since the current knowledge of molecular level mechanisms of biological functions is still limited, such previous studies were incomplete. We expected that the multi-level biological networks would allow us to more completely investigate the functional drug actions. We constructed multi-level biological networks with genes, GO terms, and diseases. Meta-paths were utilized to extract the features of each GO term. We trained 39 SVM models to prioritize the functional drug actions of the various 39 drugs. Through the multi-level networks, more functional drug actions were utilized for the 39 models and inferred by the models. Multi-level based features improved the performance of the models, and the average AUROC value in the cross-validation was 0.86. Moreover, 60% of the candidates were true.",Comparative Evaluation of Hydrothermal Carbonization and Low Temperature Pyrolysis of Eucommia ulmoides Oliver for the Production of Solid Biofuel.,https://www.ncbi.nlm.nih.gov/pubmed/30940831,Scientific reports,2019 04 09,"This study evaluates the feasibility of two thermal pretreatments including hydrothermal carbonization (HTC) and low temperature pyrolysis (LTP) on the production of Eucommia ulmoides biochar. The waste wood of Eucommia ulmoides Oliver was pretreated and characterized for fuel applications. The results confirm that both LTP and HTC are promising processes for improving fuel properties. However, for the same char yield, the required temperature for HTC is lower than LTP, as the char yields of H200 and L300 were quite close (66.50% vs. 66.74%). The surface morphology is significantly different between the pyrolytic carbon and the hydrochar. In addition, it was found that the H/C and O/C ratios of H300 were 0.82 and 0.21, respectively, and the H/C and O/C ratios of L340 were 0.77 and 0.22, respectively. They were similar to that of sub-bituminous. Moreover, under the same reaction temperature, hydrochar showed better grindability, hydrophobicity, and reduction in inorganic content. Comparing the integrated combustion characteristic index (S), LTP process had the better performance within the lower temperature under 220 °C while HTC process performed better at temperature higher than 300 °C. The results reveal that HTC has the potential to produce solid carbonized products with better fuel quality.",Extracellular small non-coding RNA contaminants in fetal bovine serum and serum-free media.,https://www.ncbi.nlm.nih.gov/pubmed/30940830,Scientific reports,2019 04 09,"In the research field of extracellular vesicles (EVs), the use of fetal bovine serum (FBS) depleted of EVs for in vitro studies is advocated to eliminate the confounding effects of media derived EVs. EV-depleted FBS may either be prepared by ultracentrifugation or purchased commercially. Nevertheless, these preparations do not guarantee an RNA-free FBS for in vitro use. In this study we address the RNA contamination issue, of small non-coding (nc)RNA in vesicular or non-vesicular fractions of FBS, ultracentrifugation EV-depleted FBS, commercial EV-depleted FBS, and in our recently developed filtration based EV-depleted FBS. Commercially available serum- and xeno-free defined media were also screened for small ncRNA contamination. Our small ncRNA sequencing data showed that all EV-depleted media and commercially available defined media contained small ncRNA contaminants. Out of the different FBS preparations studied, our ultrafiltration-based method for EV depletion performed the best in depleting miRNAs. Certain miRNAs such miR-122 and miR-203a proved difficult to remove completely and were found in all media. Compared to miRNAs, other small ncRNA (snRNA, Y RNA, snoRNA, and piRNA) were difficult to eliminate from all the studied media. Additionally, our tested defined media contained miRNAs and other small ncRNAs, albeit at a much lower level than in serum preparations. Our study showed that no media is free of small ncRNA contaminants. Therefore, in order to screen for baseline RNA contamination in culturing media, RNA sequencing data should be carefully controlled by adding a media sample as a control. This should be a mandatory step before performing cell culture experiments in order to eliminate the confounding effects of media.",Arctic warming interrupts the Transpolar Drift and affects long-range transport of sea ice and ice-rafted matter.,https://www.ncbi.nlm.nih.gov/pubmed/30940829,Scientific reports,2019 04 07,"Sea ice is an important transport vehicle for gaseous, dissolved and particulate matter in the Arctic Ocean. Due to the recently observed acceleration in sea ice drift, it has been assumed that more matter is advected by the Transpolar Drift from shallow shelf waters to the central Arctic Ocean and beyond. However, this study provides first evidence that intensified melt in the marginal zones of the Arctic Ocean interrupts the transarctic conveyor belt and has led to a reduction of the survival rates of sea ice exported from the shallow Siberian shelves (-15% per decade). As a consequence, less and less ice formed in shallow water areas (<30 m) has reached Fram Strait (-17% per decade), and more ice and ice-rafted material is released in the northern Laptev Sea and central Arctic Ocean. Decreasing survival rates of first-year ice are visible all along the Russian shelves, but significant only in the Kara Sea, East Siberian Sea and western Laptev Sea. Identified changes affect biogeochemical fluxes and ecological processes in the central Arctic: A reduced long-range transport of sea ice alters transport and redistribution of climate relevant gases, and increases accumulation of sediments and contaminates in the central Arctic Ocean, with consequences for primary production, and the biodiversity of the Arctic Ocean."

Here, we show that altered intestinal microbiota contributes to anti-tumor immunity, limiting tumor expansion. Mice lacking the ubiquitin ligase RNF5 exhibit attenuated activation of the unfolded protein response (UPR) components, which coincides with increased expression of inflammasome components, recruitment and activation of dendritic cells and reduced expression of antimicrobial peptides in intestinal epithelial cells. Reduced UPR expression is also seen in murine and human melanoma tumor specimens that responded to immune checkpoint therapy. Co-housing of Rnf5-/- and WT mice abolishes the anti-tumor immunity and tumor inhibition phenotype, whereas transfer of 11 bacterial strains, including B. rodentium, enriched in Rnf5-/- mice, establishes anti-tumor immunity and restricts melanoma growth in germ-free WT mice. Altered UPR signaling, exemplified in Rnf5-/- mice, coincides with altered gut microbiota composition and anti-tumor immunity to control melanoma growth.",Structural and biochemical evidence supporting poly ADP-ribosylation in the bacterium Deinococcus radiodurans.,https://www.ncbi.nlm.nih.gov/pubmed/30940816,Nature communications,2019 04 24,"Poly-ADP-ribosylation, a post-translational modification involved in various cellular processes, is well characterized in eukaryotes but thought to be devoid in bacteria. Here, we solve crystal structures of ADP-ribose-bound poly(ADP-ribose)glycohydrolase from the radioresistant bacterium Deinococcus radiodurans (DrPARG), revealing a solvent-accessible 2'-hydroxy group of ADP-ribose, which suggests that DrPARG may possess endo-glycohydrolase activity toward poly-ADP-ribose (PAR). We confirm the existence of PAR in D. radiodurans and show that disruption of DrPARG expression causes accumulation of endogenous PAR and compromises recovery from UV radiation damage. Moreover, endogenous PAR levels in D. radiodurans are elevated after UV irradiation, indicating that PARylation may be involved in resistance to genotoxic stresses. These findings provide structural insights into a bacterial-type PARG and suggest the existence of a prokaryotic PARylation machinery that may be involved in stress responses.",The computational and neural substrates of moral strategies in social decision-making.,https://www.ncbi.nlm.nih.gov/pubmed/30940815,Nature communications,2019 04 24,"Individuals employ different moral principles to guide their social decision-making, thus expressing a specific 'moral strategy'. Which computations characterize different moral strategies, and how might they be instantiated in the brain? Here, we tackle these questions in the context of decisions about reciprocity using a modified Trust Game. We show that different participants spontaneously and consistently employ different moral strategies. By mapping an integrative computational model of reciprocity decisions onto brain activity using inter-subject representational similarity analysis of fMRI data, we find markedly different neural substrates for the strategies of 'guilt aversion' and 'inequity aversion', even under conditions where the two strategies produce the same choices. We also identify a new strategy, 'moral opportunism', in which participants adaptively switch between guilt and inequity aversion, with a corresponding switch observed in their neural activation patterns.

Here, a plant-inspired adhesive hydrogel has been developed based on Ag-Lignin nanoparticles (NPs)triggered dynamic redox catechol chemistry. Ag-Lignin NPs construct the dynamic catechol redox system, which creates long-lasting reductive-oxidative environment inner hydrogel networks. This redox system, generating catechol groups continuously, endows the hydrogel with long-term and repeatable adhesiveness. Furthermore, Ag-Lignin NPs generate free radicals and trigger self-gelation of the hydrogel under ambient environment. This hydrogel presents high toughness for the existence of covalent and non-covalent interaction in the hydrogel networks. The hydrogel also possesses good cell affinity and high antibacterial activity due to the catechol groups and bactericidal ability of Ag-Lignin NPs. This study proposes a strategy to design tough and adhesive hydrogels based on dynamic plant catechol chemistry.","Genome-wide association study of alcohol consumption and use disorder in 274,424 individuals from multiple populations.",https://www.ncbi.nlm.nih.gov/pubmed/30940813,Nature communications,2019 05 17,"Alcohol consumption level and alcohol use disorder (AUD) diagnosis are moderately heritable traits. We conduct genome-wide association studies of these traits using longitudinal Alcohol Use Disorder Identification Test-Consumption (AUDIT-C) scores and AUD diagnoses in a multi-ancestry Million Veteran Program sample (N = 274,424). We identify 18 genome-wide significant loci: 5 associated with both traits, 8 associated with AUDIT-C only, and 5 associated with AUD diagnosis only. Polygenic Risk Scores (PRS) for both traits are associated with alcohol-related disorders in two independent samples. Although a significant genetic correlation reflects the overlap between the traits, genetic correlations for 188 non-alcohol-related traits differ significantly for the two traits, as do the phenotypes associated with the traits' PRS. Cell type group partitioning heritability enrichment analyses also differentiate the two traits. We conclude that, although heavy drinking is a key risk factor for AUD, it is not a sufficient cause of the disorder.",Nitrogen-fixing trees could exacerbate climate change under elevated nitrogen deposition.,https://www.ncbi.nlm.nih.gov/pubmed/30940812,Nature communications,2019 04 08,"Biological nitrogen fixation can fuel CO2 sequestration by forests but can also stimulate soil emissions of nitrous oxide (N2O), a potent greenhouse gas. Here we use a theoretical model to suggest that symbiotic nitrogen-fixing trees could either mitigate (CO2 sequestration outweighs soil N2O emissions) or exacerbate (vice versa) climate change relative to non-fixing trees, depending on their nitrogen fixation strategy (the degree to which they regulate nitrogen fixation to balance nitrogen supply and demand) and on nitrogen deposition. The model posits that nitrogen-fixing trees could exacerbate climate change globally relative to non-fixing trees by the radiative equivalent of 0.77 Pg C yr-1 under nitrogen deposition rates projected for 2030. This value is highly uncertain, but its magnitude suggests that this subject requires further study and that improving the representation of biological nitrogen fixation in climate models could substantially decrease estimates of the extent to which forests will mitigate climate change.",Trans-provincial health impacts of atmospheric mercury emissions in China.,https://www.ncbi.nlm.nih.gov/pubmed/30940811,Nature communications,2019 04 24,"Mercury (Hg) exposure poses substantial risks to human health. Investigating a longer chain from economic activities to human health can reveal the sources and critical processes of Hg-related health risks. Thus, we develop a more comprehensive assessment method which is applied to mainland China-the largest global Hg emitter. We present a map of Hg-related health risks in China and estimate that 0.14 points of per-foetus intelligence quotient (IQ) decrements and 7,360 deaths from fatal heart attacks are related to the intake of methylmercury in 2010. This study, for the first time, reveals the significant impacts of interprovincial trade on Hg-related health risks across the whole country. For instance, interprovincial trade induced by final consumption prevents 0.39 × 10-2 points for per-foetus IQ decrements and 194 deaths from fatal heart attacks. These findings highlight the importance of policy decisions in different stages of economic supply chains to reduce Hg-related health risks.",Synthetic ligands for PreQ1 riboswitches provide structural and mechanistic insights into targeting RNA tertiary structure.,https://www.ncbi.nlm.nih.gov/pubmed/30940810,Nature communications,2019 04 24,"Riboswitches are naturally occurring RNA aptamers that regulate gene expression by binding to specific small molecules. Riboswitches control the expression of essential bacterial genes and are important models for RNA-small molecule recognition. Here, we report the discovery of a class of synthetic small molecules that bind to PreQ1 riboswitch aptamers. These molecules bind specifically and reversibly to the aptamers with high affinity and induce a conformational change. Furthermore, the ligands modulate riboswitch activity through transcriptional termination despite no obvious chemical similarity to the cognate ligand. X-ray crystallographic studies reveal that the ligands share a binding site with the cognate ligand but make different contacts. Finally, alteration of the chemical structure of the ligand causes changes in the mode of RNA binding and affects regulatory function. Thus, target- and structure-based approaches can be used to identify and understand the mechanism of synthetic ligands that bind to and regulate complex, folded RNAs.",Cortex-wide neural interfacing via transparent polymer skulls.,https://www.ncbi.nlm.nih.gov/pubmed/30940809,Nature communications,2019 04 24,"Neural computations occurring simultaneously in multiple cerebral cortical regions are critical for mediating behaviors. Progress has been made in understanding how neural activity in specific cortical regions contributes to behavior. However, there is a lack of tools that allow simultaneous monitoring and perturbing neural activity from multiple cortical regions. We engineered 'See-Shells'-digitally designed, morphologically realistic, transparent polymer skulls that allow long-term (>300 days) optical access to 45 mm2 of the dorsal cerebral cortex in the mouse. We demonstrate the ability to perform mesoscopic imaging, as well as cellular and subcellular resolution two-photon imaging of neural structures up to 600 µm deep. See-Shells allow calcium imaging from multiple, non-contiguous regions across the cortex. Perforated See-Shells enable introducing penetrating neural probes to perturb or record neural activity simultaneously with whole cortex imaging. See-Shells are constructed using common desktop fabrication tools, providing a powerful tool for investigating brain structure and function.",Successive modification of polydentate complexes gives access to planar carbon- and nitrogen-based ligands.,https://www.ncbi.nlm.nih.gov/pubmed/30940808,Nature communications,2019 04 08,"Polydentate complexes containing combinations of nitrogen and carbon (N and C) ligating atoms are among the most fundamental and ubiquitous molecules in coordination chemistry, yet the formation of such complexes with planar high-coordinate N/C sites remains challenging. Herein, we demonstrate an efficient route to access related complexes with tetradentate CCCN and pentadentate CCCCN and NCCCN cores by successive modification of the coordinating atoms in complexes with a CCCC core. Combined experimental and computational studies reveal that the rich reactivity of metal-carbon bonds and the inherent aromaticity of the metallacyclic skeletons play key roles in these transformations. This strategy addresses the paucity of synthetic approaches to mixed N/C planar pentadentate chelating species and provides valuable insights into the synthesis of carbon-based high-coordinate complexes. Furthermore, the resulting complexes are the examples of organometallic species with combined photoacoustic, photothermal, and sonodynamic properties, which makes them promising for application in related areas."

Epithelioid angiosarcoma is even more unusual with only a handful of cases reported in literature. Differentiating this from other breast malignancy is a challenge. There have been conflicting reports regarding factors that affect prognosis. We present a case of primary epithelioid angiosarcoma of the breast, and also discuss the prognostic and differential diagnostic issues. CASE REPORT A 70-year old female presented with slowly enlarging fungating mass in the right breast with a necrotic center and serosanguineous discharge. Initial biopsy done at an outside institution reported the lesion as carcinosarcoma. Histologic sections showed cellular, infiltrative neoplasm with extensive necrosis and ectatic vascular proliferations lined by plump endothelial cells. Infiltrative cells were spindle-shaped with vacuolated cytoplasm and marked anisonucleosis in myxoid background. Mitotic activity was brisk. CAM5.2, AE1/AE3, and CD31 were positive. Proliferation index was high. Estrogen receptors (ER), progesterone receptors (PR), human epidermal growth factor receptor 2 (HER2)/neu were negative. CONCLUSIONS Primary epithelioid angiosarcoma of the breast can present as a diagnostic dilemma in needle biopsies. This malignancy may mimic carcinoma or benign endothelial lesions. This entity is important to be recognized because it carries poor prognostic risk and requires distinct treatment modalities different from the usual epithelial breast neoplasms.",Single Nucleotide Polymorphisms (SNPs) Genotyping Reveals that Mfn2 Polymorphisms are Associated with Thoracic Aortic Dissection in Han Chinese Population.,https://www.ncbi.nlm.nih.gov/pubmed/30940795,Medical science monitor : international medical journal of experimental and clinical research,2019 04 24,"BACKGROUND Many studies have shown that hypertension may contribute to thoracic aortic dissection (TAD). Among the factors that modulate hypertension are endoplasmic reticulum stress and vascular smooth muscle cell proliferation which are in turn modulated by mitofusion-2 (Mfn2). Specifically, we determined, in the Han Chinese population, whether single nucleotide polymorphisms (SNPs) of Mfn2 influenced the occurrence of TAD. MATERIAL AND METHODS Six tagging SNPs of Mfn2 (rs2236057, rs3766741, rs2236058, rs17037564, rs2295281, and rs2336384) were genotyped using a TaqMan assay in 200 TAD patients and 451 health individuals from the Han Chinese population. RESULTS Logistic regression analysis indicated CC genotype of rs2295281 was highly linked to an increased risk of TAD (TT+CT versus CC, OR=0.540, 95% CI [0.320-0.911], P=0.021), implying that TT genotype and CT genotype of rs2295281 have a lower risk for TAD. Logistic regression analysis also indicated that rs2236058 was highly linked to the risk of TAD based on recessive genetic model, which indicated that the GG genotype was a protective factor against TAD (GG versus (CG+CC), OR=0.545, 95% CI [0.351-0.845], P=0.007). CG genotype and CC genotype of rs2236058 had a higher risk for TAD. In addition, rs2236058 was linked to the risk of TAD in the recessive genetic and homozygous models in the normotensive subgroup (GG versus (CG+CC), OR=0.298, 95% CI [0.112-0.792], P=0.015; GG versus CC, OR=0.528, 95% CI [0.302-0.925], P=0.026) but not in the hypertension subgroup. CONCLUSIONS Our findings showed that the occurrence of TAD in a Han Chinese population was influenced by Mfn2 polymorphisms.",Spare parts neoumbilicoplasty.,https://www.ncbi.nlm.nih.gov/pubmed/30940794,Archives of plastic surgery,2019 04 03,"Umbilical preservation can be challenging, particularly in complex cases involving simultaneous ventral hernia repair and abdominoplasty. Although the umbilicus serves no functional purpose, removal of the umbilicus can draw unwanted attention to the abdominal area and can cause emotional distress to patients. There are several well documented options for umbilical reconstruction. We present a new umbilical reconstruction technique relevant for such cases. This neoumbilicoplasty allows for preservation of the original umbilicus with relocation and reconstruction using local flaps. The technique is relatively simple and the time needed is minimal. The result is a natural, well positioned umbilicus using the principles of spare part surgery.",Stress among medical students during clinical courses: a longitudinal study using contextual activity sampling system.,https://www.ncbi.nlm.nih.gov/pubmed/30940791,International journal of medical education,2019 04 03,"To investigate medical students' experiences of stress and other emotions related to their professional roles, as defined by the CanMEDS framework, by using the Contextual Activity Sampling System (CASS).",[A Trial of Unified Management of Language Tasks Using a Tablet Device for Language Area Mapping].,https://www.ncbi.nlm.nih.gov/pubmed/30940789,No shinkei geka. Neurological surgery,2019 04 03,"Language tasks must be based on perioperative neuropsychological evaluation during intraoperative language area mapping for the resection of brain tumor near the language cortex under awake craniotomy. However, flexibility is needed during surgery, because actions during surgery must change based on neurological symptoms and the presence or absence of aphasia. Here, we developed software to assess patients' ability to complete language tasks during surgery by using a tablet device; these language tasks serve as indicators of changes in patient status. We examined its effectiveness through the use of the software. In this case, the patient was a 68-year-old female. Before the surgery, the patient exhibited transcortical sensory aphasia. However, 1 day before the surgery, she exhibited worsening of language symptoms. We prepared a language task on the tablet device based on the patient's ability to complete the task before the surgery. The patient's wakefulness baseline was different from that predicted before the surgery. However, we were able to modify the surgical plan by using the results of the language task on the tablet device. In addition, we were able to finish mapping in approximately 90 minutes.",[Posterior Quadrantectomy for Infant with Refractory Epilepsy:A Case Report].,https://www.ncbi.nlm.nih.gov/pubmed/30940788,No shinkei geka. Neurological surgery,2019 04 03,"We present the case of an 11-month-old girl with linear nevus sebaceous syndrome who underwent posterior quadrantectomy(PQ)for intractable epilepsy due to cortical dysplasia extending from the temporal, parietal, and occipital lobes in the right hemisphere. Epileptic spasms started at 4 months after birth, and the frequency of her seizures gradually increased to 10 episodes per day. Electroencephalograms in the interictal periods showed hypsarrhythmia. Magnetic resonance imaging(MRI)suggested cortical dysplasia in the right temporal, parietal, and occipital lobes. Ictal single-photon emission computed tomography revealed increased cerebral blood flow in similar areas as the cortical dysplasia suggested on MRI. Several antiepileptic drugs were administered to control the epileptic spasms, without success. In addition, her developmental delay gradually became evident. Because the epileptic foci extended into the posterior region of the right hemisphere, we did not execute a focused resection, but performed a PQ. The epileptic spasms completely disappeared after surgery and her developmental delay gradually improved. Early surgical intervention via PQ is useful in patients with drug-resistant epilepsy in whom the epileptic foci have extended into the temporal, parietal, and occipital lobes. This intervention not only controls intractable seizures but also helps to facilitate normal development.",[A Case of Contralateral Oculomotor Nerve Palsy due to Internal Carotid Artery-Anterior Choroidal Artery Ruptured Aneurysm].,https://www.ncbi.nlm.nih.gov/pubmed/30940787,No shinkei geka.

We encountered a case of contralateral oculomotor nerve palsy due to internal carotid artery-anterior choroidal artery ruptured aneurysm. A 63-year-old woman presented with severe headache and sudden right oculomotor palsy. Computed tomography(CT)showed subarachnoid hemorrhage, and three-dimensional CT showed a left internal carotid artery-anterior choroidal artery aneurysm. We performed neck clipping via a left pterional approach. After the surgery, right oculomotor palsy was not observed. We think the causes of oculomotor nerve palsy in this case were hematoma and elevated intracranial pressure. Once these factors were removed, we think that oculomotor nerve palsy was not observed.",[Preoperative Diagnosis of Spinal Immature Teratoma Associated with Cerebrospinal Fluid Leakage from the Congenital Dermal Sinus Tract in a 0-Day-Old Infant:A Case Report].,https://www.ncbi.nlm.nih.gov/pubmed/30940786,No shinkei geka. Neurological surgery,2019 04 03,We report the case of a patient with spinal immature teratoma and cerebrospinal fluid leakage from the congenital dermal sinus tract. A 0-day-old female infant presented with a subcutaneous soft mass with a dimple in the lumbosacral region at birth. Magnetic resonance imaging revealed a mixed low-intensity mass located in the extraspinal and intraspinal canal with a sinus tract. The reconstructed three-dimensional spinal computed tomography image showed spina bifida and ectopic ossification at the dorsal aspect of the sacrum. Urgent removal of the tumor and dermal sinus tract was then performed under evoked electromyography monitoring. The resected tumor was histopathologically diagnosed as immature teratoma.,[A Case of Meningeal Solitary Fibrous Tumour/Haemangiopericytoma WHO Grade III Metastasized to the Spleen Shortly After Tumor Resection].,https://www.ncbi.nlm.nih.gov/pubmed/30940785,No shinkei geka. Neurological surgery,2019 04 03,"Revision of WHO guidelines in 2016 led to the classification of solitary fibrous tumours(SFTs)and haemangiopericytomas(HPCs)as a single tumor entity characterized by <i>NAB2-STAT6</i> fusion. Standard-of-care treatment involves surgery, but local recurrence and distant metastasis sometimes occur. The average latency to metastasis after surgery is 99 months. A 38-year-old female patient presented with a complaint of headache. An 8×5×2cm lesion showing Gd-T1 enhancement was detected near the superior sagittal sinus. Pathological assessment following resection revealed proliferating, polymorphic, atypical tumor cells with distinct nucleoli in a ""patternless pattern."" Cellularity was moderate to high, and mitotic figures were observed in 15/10 high power fields. Immunohistochemically, tumor cells tested positive for STAT6, and RT-PCR revealed a <i>NAB2-STAT6</i> fusion gene(exons 6 and 17, respectively), supporting a diagnosis of SFT/HPC WHO grade III. Despite postoperative radiotherapy, multiple metastases to the spleen were detected 8 months after surgery, and distal pancreatectomy with splenectomy was performed. The pathology of the splenic tumor was similar to that of the intracranial tumor. Recurrent disease in a lymph node was detected 1 month later, and local radiation therapy was administered. The patient died of cancerous peritonitis 5 months later. In this case, exceedingly rapid metastasis to the spleen occurred, despite the administration of vigorous treatment. Here, we review SFT/HPC incidence, treatment, and outcomes to better understand this rare malignancy.",[Effectiveness of Color-Coded Doppler Ultrasonography for Detecting the Trajectory in the Surgical Management of Distal ACA Aneurysms].,https://www.ncbi.nlm.nih.gov/pubmed/30940784,No shinkei geka. Neurological surgery,2019 04 03,"Distal anterior cerebral artery(DACA)aneurysms are relatively rare. The detection of the surgical trajectory of DACA aneurysmal clipping is difficult because DACA aneurysms are located at various sites in the ACA. The purpose of this study was to evaluate the effectiveness of intraoperative use of color Doppler ultrasonography for the surgery of DACA aneurysms. DACA aneurysms of ten patients(three men, seven women;64.5 years old on median)were examined using intraoperative color Doppler imaging(CDI), which was performed before microscopic procedures, to detect the location of the aneurysms. Among them, six patients had ruptured aneurysms with diameters ranging from 2.5 to 10.8mm, and four of them had intracerebral hematomas. All the aneurysms and surrounding arteries were clearly detected using CDI. Moreover, in larger aneurysms, blood flow dynamics inside the aneurysm were also observed using CDI. As a result, we concluded that the intraoperative use of color Doppler ultrasonography was effective of detecting the trajectory for the DACA aneurysms without causing any damage to the brain by redundant dissections."

The article describes the formation of the Single Nucleotide Polymorphisms Consortium, which was established as a collaboration between a number of major pharmaceutical companies and several academic research institutions, with support from the Wellcome Trust Foundation. Reading the article today, one will find that several of the important arguments for an individualized therapy are described in a similar way as we have known it from the past 20 years of discussion. The article mentioned the poor efficacy of the current pharmacotherapy, disease heterogeneity, and genetic variability, a showdown with the ""one-size-fits-all"" approach, and the use of predictive safety and efficacy biomarkers. Today, personal medicine is in competition with other terms such as ""precision medicine"" and ""stratified medicine"" and is no longer the preferred term for describing the individualized health care approach. Even though personalized medicine arose from the idea of improving and individualizing pharmacotherapy, the concept has influenced most other areas of our health care system.

Histones are subject to a myriad of modifications: acetylation, methylation, phosphorylation, ubiquitination etc. This review focuses on histone acylations, a diverse group of modifications which occur on the ε-amino group of Lysine residues and includes the well-characterised Lysine acetylation. Over the last 50 years, histone acetylation has been extensively characterised, with the discovery of histone acetyltransferases (HATs) and histone deacetylases (HDACs), and global mapping experiments, revealing an association of hyperacetylated histones with accessible, transcriptionally active chromatin. More recently, there has been an explosion in the number of unique short chain 'acylations' identified by MS, including: propionylation, butyrylation, crotonylation, succinylation, malonylation and 2-hydroxyisobutyrylation. These novel modifications add a range of chemical environments to histones, and similar to acetylation, appear to accumulate at transcriptional start sites and correlate with gene activity.",CTCF: a Swiss-army knife for genome organization and transcription regulation.,https://www.ncbi.nlm.nih.gov/pubmed/30940740,Essays in biochemistry,2019 05 13,"Orchestrating vertebrate genomes require a complex interplay between the linear composition of the genome and its 3D organization inside the nucleus. This requires the function of specialized proteins, able to tune various aspects of genome organization and gene regulation. The CCCTC-binding factor (CTCF) is a DNA binding factor capable of regulating not only the 3D genome organization, but also key aspects of gene expression, including transcription activation and repression, RNA splicing, and enhancer/promoter insulation. A growing body of evidence proposes that CTCF, together with cohesin contributes to DNA loop formation and 3D genome organization. CTCF binding sites are mutation hotspots in cancer, while mutations in CTCF itself lead to intellectual disabilities, emphasizing its importance in disease etiology. In this review we cover various aspects of CTCF function, revealing the polyvalence of this factor as a highly diversified tool for vertebrate genome organization and transcription regulation.",ROS amplification drives mouse spermatogonial stem cell self-renewal.,https://www.ncbi.nlm.nih.gov/pubmed/30940732,Life science alliance,2019 04 11,"Reactive oxygen species (ROS) play critical roles in self-renewal division for various stem cell types. However, it remains unclear how ROS signals are integrated with self-renewal machinery. Here, we report that the MAPK14/MAPK7/BCL6B pathway creates a positive feedback loop to drive spermatogonial stem cell (SSC) self-renewal via ROS amplification. The activation of MAPK14 induced MAPK7 phosphorylation in cultured SSCs, and targeted deletion of Mapk14 or Mapk7 resulted in significant SSC deficiency after spermatogonial transplantation. The activation of this signaling pathway not only induced Nox1 but also increased ROS levels. Chemical screening of MAPK7 targets revealed many ROS-dependent spermatogonial transcription factors, of which BCL6B was found to initiate ROS production by increasing Nox1 expression via ETV5-induced nuclear translocation. Because hydrogen peroxide or Nox1 transfection also induced BCL6B nuclear translocation, our results suggest that BCL6B initiates and amplifies ROS signals to activate ROS-dependent spermatogonial transcription factors by forming a positive feedback loop.",Assessing the quality of health care in the management of bronchiolitis in Australian children: a population-based sample survey.,https://www.ncbi.nlm.nih.gov/pubmed/30940731,BMJ quality & safety,2019 04 03,"Bronchiolitis is the most common cause of respiratory hospitalisation in children aged <2 years.

Drugs from both classes achieve microtubule inhibition by binding different sites on tubulin and inhibiting or promoting polymerization with no concomitant effects on the protein levels of tubulin heterodimers. Here, we have identified a series of small molecules with diverse structures potentially representing a third class of novel tubulin inhibitors that promote degradation by covalent binding to Cys-239 of β-tubulin. The small molecules highlighted in this study include T0070907 (a peroxisome proliferator-activated receptor γ inhibitor), T007-1 (a T0070907 derivative), T138067, N,N'-ethylene-bis(iodoacetamide) (EBI), and allyl isothiocyanate (AITC). Label-free quantitative proteomic analysis revealed that T007-1 promotes tubulin degradation with high selectivity. Mass spectrometry findings showed covalent binding of both T0070907 and T007-01 to Cys-239 of β-tubulin. Furthermore, T007-1 exerted a degradative effect on tubulin isoforms possessing Cys-239 (β2, β4, and β5(β)) but not those containing Ser-239 (β3, β6) or mutant β-tubulin with a C239S substitution. Three small molecules (T138067, EBI, and AITC) also reported to bind covalently to Cys-239 of β-tubulin similarly induced tubulin degradation. Our results strongly suggest that covalent modification of Cys-239 of β-tubulin by small molecules could serve as a novel strategy to promote tubulin heterodimer degradation. We propose that these small molecules represent a third novel class of tubulin inhibitor agents that exert their effects through degradation activity.",Non-canonical ubiquitination of the cholesterol-regulated degron of squalene monooxygenase.,https://www.ncbi.nlm.nih.gov/pubmed/30940729,The Journal of biological chemistry,2019 05 22,"Squalene monooxygenase (SM) is a rate-limiting enzyme in cholesterol synthesis. The region comprising the first 100 amino acids, termed SM N100, represents the shortest cholesterol-responsive degron and enables SM to sense excess cholesterol in the endoplasmic reticulum (ER) membrane. Cholesterol accelerates the ubiquitination of SM by membrane-associated ring-CH type finger 6 (MARCH6), a key E3 ubiquitin ligase involved in ER-associated degradation. However, the ubiquitination site required for cholesterol regulation of SM N100 is unknown. Here, we used SM N100 fused to GFP as a model degron to recapitulate cholesterol-mediated SM degradation and show that neither SM lysine residues nor the N terminus impart instability. Instead, we discovered four serines (Ser-59, Ser-61, Ser-83, and Ser-87) that are critical for cholesterol-accelerated degradation, with MS analysis confirming Ser-83 as a ubiquitination site. Notably, these two clusters of closely spaced serine residues are located in disordered domains flanking a 12-amino acid-long amphipathic helix (residues Gln-62-Leu-73) that together confer cholesterol responsiveness. In summary, our findings reveal the degron architecture of SM N100, introducing the role of non-canonical ubiquitination sites and deepening our molecular understanding of how SM is degraded in response to cholesterol.",Common motifs in ETAA1 and TOPBP1 required for ATR kinase activation.,https://www.ncbi.nlm.nih.gov/pubmed/30940728,The Journal of biological chemistry,2019 06 10,"DNA damage response Ser/Thr kinases, including ataxia telangiectasia-mutated (ATM) and Rad3-related (ATR), control cell cycle progression, DNA repair, and apoptosis. ATR is activated by ETAA1 activator of ATR kinase (ETAA1) or DNA topoisomerase II binding protein 1 (TOPBP1). Both ETAA1 and TOPBP1 contain experimentally defined ATR activation domains (AADs) that are mostly unstructured and have minimal sequence similarity. A tryptophan residue in both AADs is required for ATR activation, but the other features of these domains and the mechanism by which they activate ATR are unknown. In this study, using bioinformatic analyses, kinase assays, co-immunoprecipitation, and immunofluorescence measures of signaling, we more specifically defined the TOPBP1 and ETAA1 AADs and identified additional features of the AADs needed for ATR activation. We found that both ETAA1 and TOPBP1 contain a predicted coiled-coil motif that is required for ATR activation in vitro and in cells. Mutation of the predicted coiled coils does not alter AAD oligomerization but does impair binding of the AADs to ATR. These results suggest that TOPBP1 and ETAA1 activate ATR using similar motifs and mechanisms."

Theta oscillations (∼8 Hz) underlie a key physiological mechanism for mediating these coordinated interactions, and theta oscillatory coherence and phase-locked spiking in the two regions have been shown to be important for spatial memory. Hippocampal place-cell activity associated with theta oscillations encodes spatial position during behavior, and theta phase-associated spiking is known to further mediate a temporal code for space within CA1 place fields. Although prefrontal neurons are prominently phase-locked to hippocampal theta oscillations in spatial memory tasks, whether and how theta oscillations mediate processing of spatial information across these networks remains unclear. Here, we addressed these questions using simultaneous recordings of dorsal CA1-PFC ensembles and population decoding analyses in male rats performing a continuous spatial working memory task known to require hippocampal-prefrontal interactions. We found that in addition to CA1, population activity in PFC can also encode the animal's current spatial position on a theta-cycle timescale during memory-guided behavior. Coding of spatial position was coherent for CA1 and PFC ensembles, exhibiting correlated position representations within theta cycles. In addition, incorporating theta-phase information during decoding to account for theta-phase associated spiking resulted in a significant improvement in the accuracy of prefrontal spatial representations, similar to concurrent CA1 representations. These findings indicate a theta-oscillation-mediated mechanism of temporal coordination for shared processing and communication of spatial information across the two networks during spatial memory-guided behavior.SIGNIFICANCE STATEMENT Theta oscillation- (∼8 Hz) mediated interactions between the hippocampus and prefrontal cortex are known to be important for spatial memory. Hippocampal place-cell activity associated with theta oscillations underlies a rate and temporal code for spatial position, but it is not known whether these oscillations mediate simultaneous coding of spatial information in hippocampal-prefrontal networks. Here, we found that population activity in prefrontal cortex encodes animals' current position coherently with hippocampal populations on a theta-cycle timescale. Further we found that theta phase-associated spiking significantly improves prefrontal coding of spatial position, in parallel with hippocampal coding. Our findings establish that theta oscillations mediate a temporal coordination mechanism for coherent coding of spatial position in hippocampal-prefrontal networks during memory-guided behavior.",TrkB Activation during a Critical Period Mimics the Protective Effects of Early Visual Experience on Perception and the Stability of Receptive Fields in Adult Superior Colliculus.,https://www.ncbi.nlm.nih.gov/pubmed/30940716,The Journal of neuroscience : the official journal of the Society for Neuroscience,2019 06 14,"During a critical period in development, spontaneous and evoked retinal activity shape visual pathways in an adaptive fashion. Interestingly, spontaneous activity is sufficient for spatial refinement of visual receptive fields (RFs) in superior colliculus (SC) and visual cortex (V1), but early visual experience is necessary to maintain inhibitory synapses and stabilize RFs in adulthood (Carrasco et al., 2005, 2011; Carrasco and Pallas, 2006; Balmer and Pallas, 2015a). In V1, BDNF and its high-affinity receptor TrkB are important for development of visual acuity, inhibition, and regulation of the critical period for ocular dominance plasticity (Hanover et al., 1999; Huang et al., 1999; Gianfranceschi et al., 2003). To examine the generality of this signaling pathway for visual system plasticity, the present study examined the role of TrkB signaling during the critical period for RF refinement in SC. Activating TrkB receptors during the critical period (P33-P40) in dark reared subjects produced normally refined RFs, and blocking TrkB receptors in light-exposed animals resulted in enlarged adult RFs like those in dark reared animals. We also report here that deprivation- or TrkB blockade-induced RF enlargement in adulthood impaired fear responses to looming overhead stimuli and negatively impacted visual acuity. Thus, early TrkB activation is both necessary and sufficient to maintain visual RF refinement, robust looming responses, and visual acuity in adulthood. These findings suggest a common signaling pathway exists for the maturation of inhibition between V1 and SC.SIGNIFICANCE STATEMENT Receptive field refinement in superior colliculus differs from more commonly studied examples of critical period plasticity in visual pathways in that it does not require visual experience to occur; rather, spontaneous activity is sufficient. Maintenance of refinement beyond puberty requires a brief, early exposure to light to stabilize the lateral inhibition that shapes receptive fields. We find that TrkB activation during a critical period can substitute for visual experience in maintaining receptive field refinement into adulthood, and that this maintenance is beneficial to visual survival behaviors. Thus, as in some other types of plasticity, TrkB signaling plays a crucial role in receptive field refinement.",Ageing population has changed the nature of major thoracic injury.,https://www.ncbi.nlm.nih.gov/pubmed/30940714,Emergency medicine journal : EMJ,2019 06 11,"An increasing proportion of the major trauma population are older persons. The pattern of injury is different in this age group and serious chest injuries represent a significant subgroup, with implications for trauma system design.

We have shown that levels of Candida tropicalis, along with those of Escherichia coli and Serratia marcescens, are significantly elevated in Crohn's disease (CD) patients. Here, we evaluated the ability of a novel probiotic to prevent and treat polymicrobial biofilms (PMB) formed by C. tropicalis with E. coli and S. marcescens Since Candida albicans has been reported to be elevated in CD patients, we investigated the interactions of C. albicans with these bacterial species in biofilm formation. We determined whether the interaction between Candida spp. and bacteria is specific by using Trichosporon inkin and Saccharomyces fibuligera as comparators. Additionally, the effects of probiotics on C. albicans germination and biofilm formation were determined. To determine the ability of the probiotic to prevent or treat mature biofilms, probiotic filtrate was added to the PMB at early (prevention) and mature (treatment) phases. Biofilm thickness and architecture were assessed by confocal scanning laser microscopy. The effects of the probiotic on germination were evaluated in the presence of serum. Exposure of C. tropicalis PMB to probiotic filtrate reduced biofilm matrix, decreased thickness, and inhibited hyphal formation. We showed that C. albicans or C. tropicalis formed significantly thicker PMB than control biofilms, indicating that this interaction is Candida specific. Treatment with probiotic filtrate inhibited C. albicans germination and prevented/treated C. albicans PMB. The designed probiotic may have utility in the management of biofilm-associated gastrointestinal diseases such as Crohn's and colorectal cancer.IMPORTANCE The effects of diversity of the gut microbiome on inflammation have centered mainly on bacterial flora. Recent research has implicated fungal species and their interactions with other organisms in the inflammatory process. New ways to restore microbial balance in the gut are being explored. Our goal was to identify beneficial probiotic strains that would antagonize these fungal and bacterial pathogens that are elevated in the inflamed gut, and which also have antibiofilm activity. Fungus-bacterium correlation analysis allowed us to identify candidate probiotic species that can antagonize microbial pathogens, which we subsequently incorporated into a novel probiotic formulation. Amylase, which is known to have some antibiofilm activity, was also added to the probiotic mixture. This novel probiotic may have utility for the management of inflammatory bowel diseases by disrupting polymicrobial biofilm formation.",Cryptococcus neoformans Glucuronoxylomannan and Sterylglucoside Are Required for Host Protection in an Animal Vaccination Model.,https://www.ncbi.nlm.nih.gov/pubmed/30940711,mBio,2019 05 20,"Cryptococcus neoformans is an encapsulated fungal pathogen that causes meningoencephalitis. There are no prophylactic tools for cryptococcosis. Previously, our group showed that a C. neoformans mutant lacking the gene encoding sterylglucosidase (Δsgl1) induced protection in both immunocompetent and immunocompromised murine models of cryptococcosis. Since sterylglucosidase catalyzes degradation of sterylglucosides (SGs), accumulation of this glycolipid could be responsible for protective immunity. In this study, we analyzed whether the activity of SGs is sufficient for the protective effect induced by the Δsgl1 strain. We observed that the accumulation of SGs impacted several properties of the main polysaccharide that composes the fungal capsule, glucuronoxylomannan (GXM). We therefore used genetic manipulation to delete the SGL1 gene in the acapsular mutant Δcap59 to generate a double mutant (strain Δcap59/Δsgl1) that was shown to be nonpathogenic and cleared from the lung of mice within 7 days post-intranasal infection. The inflammatory immune response triggered by the Δcap59/Δsgl1 mutant in the lung differed from the response seen with the other strains. The double mutant did not induce protection in a vaccination model, suggesting that SG-related protection requires the main capsular polysaccharide. Finally, GXM-containing extracellular vesicles (EVs) enriched in SGs delayed the acute lethality of Galleria mellonella against C. neoformans infection. These studies highlighted a key role for GXM and SGs in inducing protection against a secondary cryptococcal infection, and, since EVs notoriously contain GXM, these results suggest the potential use of Δsgl1 EVs as a vaccination strategy for cryptococcosis.IMPORTANCE The number of deaths from cryptococcal meningitis is around 180,000 per year. The disease is the second leading cause of mortality among individuals with AIDS. Antifungal treatment is costly and associated with adverse effects and resistance, evidencing the urgency of development of both therapeutic and prophylactic tools. Here we demonstrate the key roles of polysaccharide- and glycolipid-containing structures in a vaccination model to prevent cryptococcosis.",Antibodies Elicited by an NS1-Based Vaccine Protect Mice against Zika Virus.,https://www.ncbi.nlm.nih.gov/pubmed/30940710,mBio,2019 05 20,"Zika virus is a mosquito-borne flavivirus which can cause severe disease in humans, including microcephaly and other congenital malformations in newborns and Guillain-Barré syndrome in adults. There are currently no approved prophylactics or therapeutics for Zika virus; the development of a safe and effective vaccine is an urgent priority. Preclinical studies suggest that the envelope glycoprotein can elicit potently neutralizing antibodies. However, such antibodies are implicated in the phenomenon of antibody-dependent enhancement of disease. We have previously shown that monoclonal antibodies targeting the Zika virus nonstructural NS1 protein are protective without inducing antibody-dependent enhancement of disease. Here, we investigated whether the NS1 protein itself is a viable vaccine target. Wild-type mice were vaccinated with an NS1-expressing DNA plasmid followed by two adjuvanted protein boosters, which elicited high antibody titers. Passive transfer of the immune sera was able to significantly protect STAT2 knockout mice against lethal challenge by Zika virus. In addition, long-lasting NS1-specific IgG responses were detected in serum samples from patients in either the acute or the convalescent phase of Zika virus infection. These NS1-specific antibodies were able to functionally engage Fcγ receptors. In contrast, envelope-specific antibodies did not activate Fc-mediated effector functions on infected cells. Our data suggest that the Zika virus NS1 protein, which is expressed on infected cells, is critical for Fc-dependent cell-mediated immunity. The present study demonstrates that the Zika virus NS1 protein is highly immunogenic and can elicit protective antibodies, underscoring its potential for an effective Zika virus vaccine.IMPORTANCE Zika virus is a global public health threat that causes microcephaly and congenital malformations in newborns and Guillain-Barré syndrome in adults. Currently, no vaccines or treatments are available. While antibodies targeting the envelope glycoprotein can neutralize virus, they carry the risk of antibody-dependent enhancement of disease (ADE). In contrast, antibodies generated against the NS1 protein can be protective without eliciting ADE. The present study demonstrates the effectiveness of an NS1-based vaccine in eliciting high titers of protective antibodies against Zika virus disease in a mouse model. Sera generated by this vaccine can elicit Fc-mediated effector functions against Zika virus-infected cells. Lastly, we provide human data suggesting that the antibody response against the Zika virus NS1 protein is long-lasting and functionally active. Overall, our work will inform the development of a safe and effective Zika virus vaccine.",Respiratory Heterogeneity Shapes Biofilm Formation and Host Colonization in Uropathogenic Escherichia coli.,https://www.ncbi.nlm.nih.gov/pubmed/30940709,mBio,2019 05 20,"Biofilms are multicellular bacterial communities encased in a self-secreted extracellular matrix comprised of polysaccharides, proteinaceous fibers, and DNA. Organization of these components lends spatial organization to the biofilm community such that biofilm residents can benefit from the production of common goods while being protected from exogenous insults. Spatial organization is driven by the presence of chemical gradients, such as oxygen. Here we show that two quinol oxidases found in Escherichia coli and other bacteria organize along the biofilm oxygen gradient and that this spatially coordinated expression controls architectural integrity. Cytochrome bd, a high-affinity quinol oxidase required for aerobic respiration under hypoxic conditions, is the most abundantly expressed respiratory complex in the biofilm community. Depletion of the cytochrome bd-expressing subpopulation compromises biofilm complexity by reducing the abundance of secreted extracellular matrix as well as increasing cellular sensitivity to exogenous stresses. Interrogation of the distribution of quinol oxidases in the planktonic state revealed that ∼15% of the population expresses cytochrome bd at atmospheric oxygen concentration, and this population dominates during acute urinary tract infection. These data point toward a bet-hedging mechanism in which heterogeneous expression of respiratory complexes ensures respiratory plasticity of E. coli across diverse host niches.IMPORTANCE Biofilms are multicellular bacterial communities encased in a self-secreted extracellular matrix comprised of polysaccharides, proteinaceous fibers, and DNA. Organization of these components lends spatial organization in the biofilm community. Here we demonstrate that oxygen gradients in uropathogenic Escherichia coli (UPEC) biofilms lead to spatially distinct expression programs for quinol oxidases-components of the terminal electron transport chain. Our studies reveal that the cytochrome bd-expressing subpopulation is critical for biofilm development and matrix production. In addition, we show that quinol oxidases are heterogeneously expressed in planktonic populations and that this respiratory heterogeneity provides a fitness advantage during infection. These studies define the contributions of quinol oxidases to biofilm physiology and suggest the presence of respiratory bet-hedging behavior in UPEC.","Mutations in hmg1, Challenging the Paradigm of Clinical Triazole Resistance in Aspergillus fumigatus.",https://www.ncbi.nlm.nih.gov/pubmed/30940706,mBio,2019 05 20,"Aspergillus fumigatus is the predominant pathogen of invasive aspergillosis, a disease state credited with over 200,000 life-threatening infections each year. The triazole class of antifungals are clinically essential to the treatment of invasive aspergillosis, both as frontline and as salvage therapy. Unfortunately, resistance to the triazoles among A. fumigatus isolates is now increasingly reported worldwide, and a large proportion of this resistance remains unexplained. In this work, we characterize the contributions of previously identified mechanisms of triazole resistance, including mutations in the sterol-demethylase-encoding gene cyp51A, overexpression of sterol-demethylase genes, and overexpression of the efflux pump-encoding gene abcC, among a large collection of highly triazole-resistant clinical A. fumigatus isolates. Upon revealing that these mechanisms alone cannot substantiate the majority of triazole resistance exhibited by this collection, we subsequently describe the identification and characterization of a novel genetic determinant of triazole resistance. Mutations in the 3-hydroxy-3-methyl-glutaryl-coenzyme A (HMG-CoA) reductase-encoding gene, hmg1, were identified in a majority of triazole-resistant clinical isolates in our collection. Introduction of three different hmg1 mutations, predicted to encode residue alterations in the conserved sterol sensing domain of Hmg1, resulted in significantly increased resistance to the triazole class of agents. Additionally, correction of a hmg1 mutation in a pan-triazole-resistant clinical isolate of A. fumigatus with a novel Cas9-ribonucleoprotein-mediated system was shown to restore clinical susceptibility to all triazole agents. Mutations in hmg1 were also shown to lead to the accumulation of ergosterol precursors, such as eburicol, by sterol profiling, while not altering the expression of sterol-demethylase genes.IMPORTANCEAspergillus fumigatus is the predominant pathogen of invasive aspergillosis, a disease state credited with over 200,000 life-threatening infections annually. The triazole class of antifungals are clinically essential to the treatment of invasive aspergillosis. Unfortunately, resistance to the triazoles among A. fumigatus isolates is now increasingly reported worldwide. In this work, we challenge the current paradigm of clinical triazole resistance in A. fumigatus, by first demonstrating that previously characterized mechanisms of resistance have nominal impact on triazole susceptibility and subsequently identifying a novel mechanism of resistance with a profound impact on clinical triazole susceptibility. We demonstrate that mutations in the HMG-CoA reductase gene, hmg1, are common among resistant clinical isolates and that hmg1 mutations confer resistance to all clinically available triazole antifungals.",Human Influenza A Virus Hemagglutinin Glycan Evolution Follows a Temporal Pattern to a Glycan Limit.,https://www.ncbi.nlm.nih.gov/pubmed/30940704,mBio,2019 06 10,"Human antibody-based immunity to influenza A virus is limited by antigenic drift resulting from amino acid substitutions in the hemagglutinin (HA) head domain. Glycan addition can cause large antigenic changes but is limited by fitness costs to viral replication. Here, we report that glycans are added to H1 and H3 HAs at discrete 5-to-7-year intervals, until they reach a functional glycan limit, after which glycans are swapped at approximately 2-fold-longer intervals. Consistent with this pattern, 2009 pandemic H1N1 added a glycan at residue N162 over the 2015-2016 season, an addition that required two epistatic HA head mutations for complete glycosylation. These strains rapidly replaced H1N1 strains globally, by 2017 dominating H3N2 and influenza B virus strains for the season. The pattern of glycan modulation that we outline should aid efforts for tracing the epidemic potential of evolving human IAV strains.IMPORTANCE Frequent mutation of its major antibody target, the glycoprotein hemagglutinin, ensures that the influenza virus is perennially both a rapidly emerging virus and a major threat to public health. One type of mutation escapes immunity by adding a glycan onto an area of hemagglutinin that many antibodies recognize. This study revealed that these glycan changes follow a simple temporal pattern. Every 5 to 7 years, hemagglutinin adds a new glycan, up to a limit. After this limit is reached, no net additions of glycans occur. Instead, glycans are swapped or lost at longer intervals. Eventually, a pandemic replaces the terminally glycosylated hemagglutinin with a minimally glycosylated one from the animal reservoir, restarting the cycle. This pattern suggests the following: (i) some hemagglutinins are evolved for this decades-long process, which is both defined by and limited by successive glycan addition; and (ii) hemagglutinin's antibody dominance and its capacity for mutations are highly adapted features that allow influenza to outpace our antibody-based immunity.",Superoxide Dismutase and Pseudocatalase Increase Tolerance to Hg(II) in Thermus thermophilus HB27 by Maintaining the Reduced Bacillithiol Pool.,https://www.ncbi.nlm.nih.gov/pubmed/30940703,mBio,2019 05 20,"Mercury (Hg) is a widely distributed, toxic heavy metal with no known cellular role. Mercury toxicity has been linked to the production of reactive oxygen species (ROS), but Hg does not directly perform redox chemistry with oxygen. How exposure to the ionic form, Hg(II), generates ROS is unknown. Exposure of Thermus thermophilus to Hg(II) triggered ROS accumulation and increased transcription and activity of superoxide dismutase (Sod) and pseudocatalase (Pcat); however, Hg(II) inactivated Sod and Pcat. Strains lacking Sod or Pcat had increased oxidized bacillithiol (BSH) levels and were more sensitive to Hg(II) than the wild type. The ΔbshA Δsod and ΔbshA Δpcat double mutant strains were as sensitive to Hg(II) as the ΔbshA strain that lacks bacillithiol, suggesting that the increased sensitivity to Hg(II) in the Δsod and Δpcat mutant strains is due to a decrease of reduced BSH. Treatment of T. thermophilus with Hg(II) decreased aconitase activity and increased the intracellular concentration of free Fe, and these phenotypes were exacerbated in Δsod and Δpcat mutant strains. Treatment with Hg(II) also increased DNA damage. We conclude that sequestration of the redox buffering thiol BSH by Hg(II), in conjunction with direct inactivation of ROS-scavenging enzymes, impairs the ability of T. thermophilus to effectively metabolize ROS generated as a normal consequence of growth in aerobic environments.IMPORTANCEThermus thermophilus is a deep-branching thermophilic aerobe. It is a member of the Deinococcus-Thermus phylum that, together with the Aquificae, constitute the earliest branching aerobic bacterial lineages; therefore, this organism serves as a model for early diverged bacteria (R. K. Hartmann, J. Wolters, B. Kröger, S. Schultze, et al., Syst Appl Microbiol 11:243-249, 1989, https://doi.org/10.1016/S0723-2020(89)80020-7) whose natural heated habitat may contain mercury of geological origins (G. G. Geesey, T.

T. thermophilus likely arose shortly after the oxidation of the biosphere 2.4 billion years ago. Studying T. thermophilus physiology provides clues about the origin and evolution of mechanisms for mercury and oxidative stress responses, the latter being critical for the survival and function of all extant aerobes."

We investigated the efficacy of the polyplex formulated using our synthesized polymer, (P(SiDAAr)5PEG3)-- a polyethylene glycol (PEG)-modified L-arginine oligo (-alkylaminosiloxane) that is grafted with poly (ethyleneimine, PEI) for siRNA delivery. We hypothesized that the polyplex formulated using the polymer with a balanced composition of PEI for siRNA condensation and its protection, PEG for polyplex stability and to minimize the PEI-associated toxicity, and with arginine facilitating cellular uptake would overcome the above issues with siRNA delivery. We tested our hypothesis using anti-luciferase siRNA in luciferase-expressing metastatic breast cancer cells (MDA-MB-231-Luc-D3H2LN) and anti-ABCB1 siRNA against an efflux membrane protein, ABCB1, in doxorubicin (DOX) resistant breast cancer cells (MCF-7/Adr). The results demonstrated that the polyplex at an optimal nucleotide/polymer (N/P) ratio is stable in the presence of excess polyanions, has no cellular toxicity, and protects siRNA from RNase degradation. Transfection of MDA-MB-231-Luc-D3H2LN cells with anti-luciferase siRNA polyplex showed almost complete knockdown of luciferase expression. In MCF-7/Adr cells, transfection with anti-ABCB1 siRNA effectively down-regulated its target efflux protein, ABCB1, increased cellular uptake of DOX and enhanced its cytotoxic effect. However, the co-treatment did not completely overcome drug resistance, suggesting that further optimization is needed and/or mechanism(s) other than the efflux protein, ABCB1 may be involved in drug resistance. In conclusion, our polyplex is effective for siRNA delivery and can be explored for different therapeutic applications.","Efficient and unique cobarcoding of second-generation sequencing reads from long DNA molecules enabling cost-effective and accurate sequencing, haplotyping, and de novo assembly.",https://www.ncbi.nlm.nih.gov/pubmed/30940689,Genome research,2019 05 19,"Here, we describe single-tube long fragment read (stLFR), a technology that enables sequencing of data from long DNA molecules using economical second-generation sequencing technology. It is based on adding the same barcode sequence to subfragments of the original long DNA molecule (DNA cobarcoding). To achieve this efficiently, stLFR uses the surface of microbeads to create millions of miniaturized barcoding reactions in a single tube. Using a combinatorial process, up to 3.6 billion unique barcode sequences were generated on beads, enabling practically nonredundant cobarcoding with 50 million barcodes per sample. Using stLFR, we demonstrate efficient unique cobarcoding of more than 8 million 20- to 300-kb genomic DNA fragments. Analysis of the human genome NA12878 with stLFR demonstrated high-quality variant calling and phase block lengths up to N50 34 Mb. We also demonstrate detection of complex structural variants and complete diploid de novo assembly of NA12878. These analyses were all performed using single stLFR libraries, and their construction did not significantly add to the time or cost of whole-genome sequencing (WGS) library preparation. stLFR represents an easily automatable solution that enables high-quality sequencing, phasing, SV detection, scaffolding, cost-effective diploid de novo genome assembly, and other long DNA sequencing applications.",A new approach for rare variation collapsing on functional protein domains implicates specific genic regions in ALS.,https://www.ncbi.nlm.nih.gov/pubmed/30940688,Genome research,2019 05 19,"Large-scale sequencing efforts in amyotrophic lateral sclerosis (ALS) have implicated novel genes using gene-based collapsing methods. However, pathogenic mutations may be concentrated in specific genic regions. To address this, we developed two collapsing strategies: One focuses rare variation collapsing on homology-based protein domains as the unit for collapsing, and the other is a gene-level approach that, unlike standard methods, leverages existing evidence of purifying selection against missense variation on said domains. The application of these two collapsing methods to 3093 ALS cases and 8186 controls of European ancestry, and also 3239 cases and 11,808 controls of diversified populations, pinpoints risk regions of ALS genes, including SOD1, NEK1, TARDBP, and FUS While not clearly implicating novel ALS genes, the new analyses not only pinpoint risk regions in known genes but also highlight candidate genes as well.",The N-end rule pathway and Ubr1 enforce protein compartmentalization via P2-encoded cellular location signals.,https://www.ncbi.nlm.nih.gov/pubmed/30940687,Journal of cell science,2019 05 08,"The Arg/N-end rule pathway and Ubr1, a ubiquitin E3 ligase conserved from yeast to humans, is involved in the degradation of misfolded proteins in the cytosol. However, the root physiological purpose of this activity is not completely understood. Through a systematic examination of single-residue P2-position mutants of misfolded proteins, and global and targeted bioinformatic analyses of the Saccharomyces cerevisiae proteome, it was determined that Ubr1 preferentially targets mistranslocated secretory and mitochondrial proteins in the cytosol. Degradation by Ubr1 is dependent on the recognition of cellular location signals that are naturally embedded into the second amino acid residue of most proteins. This P2-encoded location signaling mechanism may shed light on how Ubr1 and the N-end rule pathway are involved in neurodegenerative diseases such as Alzheimer's and Parkinson's diseases. A corollary to this discovery is that the N-end rule pathway enforces the compartmentalization of secretory and mitochondrial proteins by degrading those that fail to reach their intended subcellular locations. The N-end rule pathway is therefore likely to have been critical to the evolution of endosymbiotic relationships that paved the way for advanced eukaryotic cellular life.

Here, we investigated the role of Arabidopsis (Arabidopsis thaliana) BRASSINOSTEROID-SIGNALING KINASE5 (BSK5), a member of the receptor-like cytoplasmic kinase subfamily XII, in PRR-initiated immunity. BSK5 localized to the plant cell periphery, interacted in yeast and in planta with multiple receptor-like kinases, including the ELONGATION FACTOR-TU RECEPTOR (EFR) and PEP1 RECEPTOR1 (PEPR1) PRRs, and was phosphorylated in vitro by PEPR1 and EFR in the kinase activation loop. Consistent with a role in PTI, bsk5 mutant plants displayed enhanced susceptibility to the bacterial pathogen Pseudomonas syringae and to the fungus Botrytis cinerea Furthermore, bsk5 mutant plants were impaired in several immune responses induced by the elf18, pep1, and flg22 PAMP/DAMPs, including resistance to P. syringae and B. cinerea, production of reactive oxygen species, callose deposition at the cell wall, and enhanced PATHOGENESIS-RELATED1 gene expression. However, bsk5 plants were not affected in PAMP/DAMP activation of mitogen-activated protein kinases and expression of the FLG22-INDUCED RECEPTOR-LIKE KINASE1 or the WRKY domain-containing gene WRKY29 BSK5 variants mutated in the BSK5 myristoylation site, ATP-binding site, and kinase activation loop failed to complement defective PTI phenotypes of bsk5 mutant plants, suggesting that localization to the cell periphery, kinase activity, and phosphorylation by PRRs are critical for the function of BSK5 in PTI. These findings demonstrate that BSK5 plays a role in PTI by interacting with multiple immune receptors.","OsSPL3, an SBP-Domain Protein, Regulates Crown Root Development in Rice.",https://www.ncbi.nlm.nih.gov/pubmed/30940685,The Plant cell,2019 06 13,"The major root system of cereals consists of crown roots (or adventitious roots), which are important for anchoring plants in the soil and for water and nutrient uptake. However, the molecular basis of crown root formation is largely unknown. Here, we isolated a rice (Oryza sativa) mutant with fewer crown roots, named lower crown root number1 (lcrn1). Map-based cloning revealed that lcrn1 is caused by a mutation of a putative transcription factor-coding gene, O. sativa SQUAMOSA PROMOTER BINDING PROTEIN-LIKE3 (OsSPL3). We demonstrate that the point mutation in lcrn1 perturbs theO. sativa microRNA156 (OsmiR156)-directed cleavage of OsSPL3 transcripts, resulting in the mutant phenotype. Chromatin immunoprecipitation sequencing assays of OsSPL3 binding sites and RNA sequencing of differentially expressed transcripts in lcrn1 further identified potential direct targets of OsSPL3 in basal nodes, including a MADS-box transcription factor, OsMADS50. OsMADS50-overexpressing plants produced fewer crown roots, phenocopying lcrn1, while knocking out OsMADS50 in the lcrn1 background reversed this phenotype. We also show that OsSPL12, another OsmiR156 target gene, regulates OsMADS50 and crown root development. Taken together, our findings suggest a novel regulatory pathway in which the OsmiR156-OsSPL3/OsSPL12 module directly activates OsMADS50 in the node to regulate crown root development in rice.",BET 2: Pain management in patients who show awareness during CPR.,https://www.ncbi.nlm.nih.gov/pubmed/30940684,Emergency medicine journal : EMJ,2019 05 28,"A shortcut review was carried out to establish whether pin management or sedation is indicated to improve outcome in patients who show signs of awareness during cardiopulmonary resuscitation (CPR).

While transcriptional dysregulation is known to play a critical role in the pathogenesis of SBMA, the underlying molecular pathomechanisms remain unclear. DNA methylation is a fundamental epigenetic modification that silences the transcription of various genes that have a CpG-rich promoter. Here, we showed that DNA methyltransferase 1 (Dnmt1) is highly expressed in the spinal motor neurons of an SBMA mouse model and in patients with SBMA. Both genetic Dnmt1 depletion and treatment with RG108, a DNA methylation inhibitor, ameliorated the viability of SBMA model cells. Furthermore, a continuous intracerebroventricular injection of RG108 mitigated the phenotype of SBMA mice. DNA methylation array analysis identified hairy and enhancer of split 5 (Hes5) as having a CpG island with hyper-methylation in the promoter region, and the Hes5 expression was strongly silenced in SBMA. Moreover, Hes5 over-expression rescued the SBMA cells possibly by inducing Smad2 phosphorylation. Our findings suggest DNA hyper-methylation underlies the neurodegeneration in SBMA."

However, the mechanism of GSC induction or maintenance is largely unknown. We previously demonstrated that the calcium-responsive transcription factor nuclear factor of activated T cells-1 (NFAT1) is activated in glioblastomas and regulates the invasion of tumor cells. In this study, we further explored the role of NFAT1 in GSC. We found that NFAT1 expression was associated with an aggressive phenotype and predicted poor survival in gliomas. Compared with normal glioma cells, NFAT1 was upregulated in GSC. NFAT1 knockdown reduced GSC viability, invasion, and self-renewal in vitro and inhibited tumorigenesis in vivo, whereas NFAT1 overexpression enhanced the growth and invasion of GSCs. RNA sequencing showed that NFAT1 depletion was associated with reduced neurodevelopment protein 1-like 1 (NDEL1, a potential downstream target of NFAT1) expression, whereas NFAT1 overexpression induced NDEL1 expression. In addition, NFAT1 regulated the promoter activities of NDEL1, whereas rescue of NDEL1 in NFAT1-silenced GSC partially restored tumor growth and invasion. Upregulation of NFAT1-NDEL1 signaling elevated Erk activation, increased protein levels of stemness markers in GSC, and resulted in de-differentiation of normal neuronal cells and astrocytes. Our results indicate that NFAT1 controls the growth and invasion of GSC partially through regulation of NDEL1. Targeting the NFAT1-NDEL1 axis therefore might be of potential benefit in the treatment of patients with glioma. SIGNIFICANCE: NFAT1 controls the growth and invasion of GSCs, partially by regulating NDEL1. Targeting the NFAT1-NDEL1 axis might provide opportunities in treating patients with glioma.",Antagonism between HTRA3 and TGFβ1 Contributes to Metastasis in Non-Small Cell Lung Cancer.,https://www.ncbi.nlm.nih.gov/pubmed/30940659,Cancer research,2019 06 04,"High temperature requirement A3 (HTRA3, long and short isoforms) is a member of the HtrA family and has been implicated as a tumor suppressor in cancer progression in multiple cancer types, yet its molecular functions in non-small cell lung cancer (NSCLC) are not well understood. Here, we report that decreased levels of HTRA3 negatively correlate with elevated TGFβ1 in lung tumor tissue with metastasis. Furthermore, high expression of HTRA3 indicated better prognosis independent of TGFβ1 expression. In NSCLC cell lines, exogenous TGFβ1 significantly downregulated the level of HTRA3, especially the long isoform, during induction of epithelial-mesenchymal transition (EMT). Mechanistically, c-Jun, which is elevated by TGFβ1, directly bound the promoter of HTRA3-L and inhibited its transcription. As a negative feedback loop, overexpression of HTRA3-L attenuated TGFβ1-mediated invasion-metastasis cascades via activation of SMAD2/3 and sensitized cells to anti-PD-L1 treatment. Taken together, our findings suggest that in the early stages of cancer, overexpressed HTRA3 acts as a brake on the oncogenic effects of TGFβ1 and inhibits tumor metastasis. In later stages, the role of HTRA3 is weakened and TGFβ1 efficiently promotes EMT in the absence of the HTRA3 brake. SIGNIFICANCE: This study provides new mechanistic insight of the interaction between HTRA3 and TGFβ in lung cancer by illustrating that HTRA3 is a novel mediator acting as a suppressor of TGFβ1-related oncogenic effects.",Temozolomide Treatment Induces lncRNA MALAT1 in an NF-κB and p53 Codependent Manner in Glioblastoma.,https://www.ncbi.nlm.nih.gov/pubmed/30940658,Cancer research,2019 05 18,"Alkylating chemotherapy is a central component of the management of glioblastoma (GBM). Among the factors that regulate the response to alkylation damage, NF-κB acts to both promote and block cytotoxicity. In this study, we used genome-wide expression analysis in U87 GBM to identify NF-κB-dependent factors altered in response to temozolomide and found the long noncoding RNA (lncRNA) MALAT1 as one of the most significantly upregulated. In addition, we demonstrated that MALAT1 expression was coregulated by p50 (p105) and p53 via novel κB- and p53-binding sites in the proximal MALAT1 coding region. Temozolomide treatment inhibited p50 recruitment to its cognate element as a function of Ser329 phosphorylation while concomitantly increasing p53 recruitment. Moreover, luciferase reporter studies demonstrated that both κB and p53 cis-elements were required for efficient transactivation in response to temozolomide. Depletion of MALAT1 sensitized patient-derived GBM cells to temozolomide cytotoxicity, and in vivo delivery of nanoparticle-encapsulated anti-MALAT1 siRNA increased the efficacy of temozolomide in mice bearing intracranial GBM xenografts. Despite these observations, in situ hybridization of GBM specimens and analysis of publicly available datasets revealed that MALAT1 expression within GBM tissue was not prognostic of overall survival. Together, these findings support MALAT1 as a target for chemosensitization of GBM and identify p50 and p52 as primary regulators of this ncRNA. SIGNIFICANCE: These findings identify NF-κB and p53 as regulators of the lncRNA MALAT1 and suggest MALAT1 as a potential target for the chemosensitization of GBM.",Mobilization of CD8+ T Cells via CXCR4 Blockade Facilitates PD-1 Checkpoint Therapy in Human Pancreatic Cancer.,https://www.ncbi.nlm.nih.gov/pubmed/30940657,Clinical cancer research : an official journal of the American Association for Cancer Research,2019 05 07,"Purpose: Pancreatic ductal adenocarcinoma (PDA) is rarely cured, and single-agent immune checkpoint inhibition has not demonstrated clinical benefit despite the presence of large numbers of CD8+ T cells. We hypothesized that tumor-infiltrating CD8+ T cells harbor latent antitumor activity that can be reactivated using combination immunotherapy.Experimental Design: Preserved human PDA specimens were analyzed using multiplex IHC (mIHC) and T-cell receptor (TCR) sequencing. Fresh tumor was treated in organotypic slice culture to test the effects of combination PD-1 and CXCR4 blockade. Slices were analyzed using IHC, flow cytometry, and live fluorescent microscopy to assess tumor kill, in addition to T-cell expansion and mobilization.Results: mIHC demonstrated fewer CD8+ T cells in juxtatumoral stroma containing carcinoma cells than in stroma devoid of them. Using TCR sequencing, we found clonal expansion in each tumor; high-frequency clones had multiple DNA rearrangements coding for the same amino acid binding sequence, which suggests response to common tumor antigens. Treatment of fresh human PDA slices with combination PD-1 and CXCR4 blockade led to increased tumor cell death concomitant with lymphocyte expansion. Live microscopy after combination therapy demonstrated CD8+ T-cell migration into the juxtatumoral compartment and rapid increase in tumor cell apoptosis.Conclusions: Endogenous tumor-reactive T cells are present within the human PDA tumor microenvironment and can be reactivated by combined blockade of PD-1 and CXCR4. This provides a new basis for the rational selection of combination immunotherapy for PDA.",Auranofin Protects Intestine against Radiation Injury by Modulating p53/p21 Pathway and Radiosensitizes Human Colon Tumor.,https://www.ncbi.nlm.nih.gov/pubmed/30940656,Clinical cancer research : an official journal of the American Association for Cancer Research,2019 06 15,"Purpose: The radiosensitivity of the normal intestinal epithelium is the major limiting factor for definitive radiotherapy against abdominal malignancies. Radiosensitizers, which can be used without augmenting radiation toxicity to normal tissue, are still an unmet need. Inhibition of proteosomal degradation is being developed as a major therapeutic strategy for anticancer therapy as cancer cells are more susceptible to proteasomal inhibition-induced cytotoxicity compared with normal cells. Auranofin, a gold-containing antirheumatoid drug, blocks proteosomal degradation by inhibiting deubiquitinase inhibitors. In this study, we have examined whether auranofin selectively radiosensitizes colon tumors without promoting radiation toxicity in normal intestine.Experimental Design: The effect of auranofin (10 mg/kg i.p.) on the radiation response of subcutaneous CT26 colon tumors and the normal gastrointestinal epithelium was determined using a mouse model of abdominal radiation. The effect of auranofin was also examined in a paired human colonic organoid system using malignant and nonmalignant tissues from the same patient.Results: Both in the mouse model of intestinal injury and in the human nonmalignant colon organoid culture, auranofin pretreatment prevented radiation toxicity and improved survival with the activation of p53/p21-mediated reversible cell-cycle arrest. However, in a mouse model of abdominal tumor and in human malignant colonic organoids, auranofin inhibited malignant tissue growth with inhibition of proteosomal degradation, induction of endoplasmic reticulum stress/unfolded protein response, and apoptosis.Conclusions: Our data suggest that auranofin is a potential candidate to be considered as a combination therapy with radiation to improve therapeutic efficacy against abdominal malignancies.",Regorafenib Promotes Antitumor Immunity via Inhibiting PD-L1 and IDO1 Expression in Melanoma.,https://www.ncbi.nlm.nih.gov/pubmed/30940655,Clinical cancer research : an official journal of the American Association for Cancer Research,2019 05 22,"Purpose: Immune checkpoint blockade (ICB) therapy induces durable tumor regressions in a minority of patients with cancer. In this study, we aimed to identify kinase inhibitors that were capable of increasing the antimelanoma immunity.Experimental Design: Flow cytometry-based screening was performed to identify kinase inhibitors that can block the IFNγ-induced PD-L1 expression in melanoma cells. The pharmacologic activities of regorafenib alone or in combination with immunotherapy in vitro and in vivo were determined. The mechanisms of regorafenib were explored and analyzed in melanoma patients treated with or without anti-PD-1 using The Gene Expression Omnibus (GEO) and The Cancer Genome Atlas (TCGA) datasets.Result: Through screening of a kinase inhibitor library, we found approximately 20 agents that caused more than half reduction of cell surface PD-L1 level, and regorafenib was one of the most potent agents. Furthermore, our results showed that regorafenib, in vitro and in vivo, strongly promoted the antitumor efficacy when combined with IFNγ or ICB. By targeting the RET-Src axis, regorafenib potently inhibited JAK1/2-STAT1 and MAPK signaling and subsequently attenuated the IFNγ-induced PD-L1 and IDO1 expression without affecting MHC-I expression much. Moreover, RET and Src co-high expression was an independent unfavorable prognosis factor in melanoma patients with or without ICB through inhibiting the antitumor immune response.Conclusions: Our data unveiled a new mechanism of alleviating IFNγ-induced PD-L1 and IDO1 expression and provided a rationale to explore a novel combination of ICB with regorafenib clinically, especially in melanoma with RET/Src axis activation.",Combination of Trastuzumab Emtansine and Stereotactic Radiosurgery Results in High Rates of Clinically Significant Radionecrosis and Dysregulation of Aquaporin-4.,https://www.ncbi.nlm.nih.gov/pubmed/30940654,Clinical cancer research : an official journal of the American Association for Cancer Research,2019 05 15,"Purpose: Patients with human EGFR2-positive (HER2+) breast cancer have a high incidence of brain metastases, and trastuzumab emtansine (T-DM1) is often employed. Stereotactic radiosurgery (SRS) is frequently utilized, and case series report increased toxicity with combination SRS and T-DM1. We provide an update of our experience of T-DM1 and SRS evaluating risk of clinically significant radionecrosis (CSRN) and propose a mechanism for this toxicity.Experimental Design: Patients with breast cancer who were ≤45 years regardless of HER2 status or had HER2+ disease regardless of age and underwent SRS for brain metastases were included. Rates of CSRN, SRS data, and details of T-DM1 administration were recorded. Proliferation and astrocytic swelling studies were performed to elucidate mechanisms of toxicity.Results: A total of 45 patients were identified; 66.7% were HER2+, and 60.0% were ≤ 45 years old. Of the entire cohort, 10 patients (22.2%) developed CSRN, 9 of whom received T-DM1. CSRN was observed in 39.1% of patients who received T-DM1 versus 4.5% of patients who did not. Receipt of T-DM1 was associated with a 13.5-fold (P = 0.02) increase in CSRN. Mechanistically, T-DM1 targeted reactive astrocytes and increased radiation-induced cytotoxicity and astrocytic swelling via upregulation of Aquaporin-4 (Aqp4).Conclusions: The strong correlation between development of CSRN after SRS and T-DM1 warrants prospective studies controlling for variations in timing of T-DM1 and radiation dosing to further stratify risk of CSRN and mitigate toxicity.

AML is poorly responsive to conventional chemotherapy and a diagnosis of AML is usually fatal. More effective and less toxic forms of therapy are desperately needed. AML cells are known to be highly dependent on the amino acid glutamine for their survival. These studies were directed at determining the effects of glutaminase inhibition on metabolism in AML and identifying general weaknesses that can be exploited therapeutically.Experimental design: AML cancer cell lines, primary AML cells, and mouse models of AML and acute lymphoblastic leukemia (ALL) were utilized.Results: We show that blocking glutamine metabolism through the use of a glutaminase inhibitor (CB-839) significantly impairs antioxidant glutathione production in multiple types of AML, resulting in accretion of mitochondrial reactive oxygen species (mitoROS) and apoptotic cell death. Moreover, glutaminase inhibition makes AML cells susceptible to adjuvant drugs that further perturb mitochondrial redox state, such as arsenic trioxide (ATO) and homoharringtonine (HHT). Indeed, the combination of ATO or HHT with CB-839 exacerbates mitoROS and apoptosis, and leads to more complete cell death in AML cell lines, primary AML patient samples, and in vivo using mouse models of AML. In addition, these redox-targeted combination therapies are effective in eradicating ALL cells in vitro and in vivoConclusions: Targeting glutamine metabolism in combination with drugs that perturb mitochondrial redox state represents an effective and potentially widely applicable therapeutic strategy for treating multiple types of leukemia.",Targeting CD38 Enhances the Antileukemic Activity of Ibrutinib in Chronic Lymphocytic Leukemia.,https://www.ncbi.nlm.nih.gov/pubmed/30940652,Clinical cancer research : an official journal of the American Association for Cancer Research,2019 05 15,"Purpose: CD38 has emerged as a high-impact therapeutic target in multiple myeloma, with the approval of daratumumab (anti-CD38 mAb).

Besides its known immune-effector mechanisms (antibody-dependent cell-mediated cytotoxicity, complement-dependent death, and antibody-dependent cellular phagocytosis), we also measured direct apoptotic effects of daratumumab alone or in combination with ibrutinib. In vivo antileukemic activity was assessed in a partially humanized xenograft model. The influence of CD38 on B-cell receptor (BCR) signaling was measured via immunoblotting of Lyn, Syk, BTK, PLCγ2, ERK1/2, and AKT.Results: In addition to immune-effector mechanisms; daratumumab also induced direct apoptosis of primary CLL cells, which was partially dependent on FcγR cross-linking. For the first time, we demonstrated the influence of CD38 on BCR signaling where interference of CD38 downregulated Syk, BTK, PLCγ2, ERK1/2, and AKT; effects that were further enhanced by addition of ibrutinib. In comparison to single-agent treatment, the combination of ibrutinib and daratumumab resulted in significantly enhanced anti-CLL activity in vitro and significantly decreased tumor growth and prolonged survival in the in vivo CLL xenograft model.Conclusions: Overall, our data demonstrate the antitumor mechanisms of daratumumab in CLL; furthermore, we show how cotargeting BTK and CD38 lead to a robust anti-CLL effect, which has clinical implications.",Indoxyl Sulfate and p-Cresyl Sulfate Promote Vascular Calcification and Associate with Glucose Intolerance.,https://www.ncbi.nlm.nih.gov/pubmed/30940651,Journal of the American Society of Nephrology : JASN,2019 05 07,"Protein-bound uremic toxins indoxyl sulfate (IS) and p-cresyl sulfate (PCS) have been associated with cardiovascular morbidity and mortality in patients with CKD.

In this study, we evaluated a novel 3D in vitro culture system that uses components of the BM hematopoietic niche to expand umbilical cord blood (UCB) CD34+ cells. We developed this model using decellularized Wharton jelly matrix (DWJM) as an extracellular matrix (ECM) scaffold and human BM mesenchymal stromal cells (MSCs) as supporting niche cells. To assess the efficacy of this model in expanding CD34+ cells, we analyzed UCB CD34+ cells, following culture in DWJM, for proliferation, viability, self-renewal, multilineage differentiation, and transmigration capability. We found that DWJM significantly expanded UCB HSPC subset. It promoted UCB CD34+ cell quiescence, while maintaining their viability, differentiation potential with megakaryocytic differentiation bias, and clonogenic capacity. DWJM induced an increase in the frequency of c-kit+ cells, a population with enhanced self-renewal ability, and in CXCR4 expression in CD34+ cells, which enhanced their transmigration capability. The presence of BM MSCs in DWJM, however, impaired UCB CD34+ cell transmigration and suppressed CXCR4 expression. Transcriptome analysis indicated that DWJM upregulates a set of genes that are specifically involved in megakaryocytic differentiation, cell mobility, and BM homing. Collectively, our results indicate that the DWJM-based 3D culture system is a novel in vitro model that supports the proliferation of UCB CD34+ cells with enhanced transmigration potential, while maintaining their differentiation potential.

In a mouse model of chronic GVHD, infiltration of HSP47+ fibroblasts and massive fibrosis surrounding the lacrimal ducts were observed after allogeneic SCT, leading to impaired tear secretion. After ocular instillation, VA-lip HSP47 was distributed to the lacrimal glands, knocked down HSP47 expression in fibroblasts, reduced collagen deposition, and restored tear secretion after allogeneic SCT. Ocular instillation of VA-lip HSP47 also ameliorated established lacrimal gland fibrosis and dry eye syndrome. VA-lip HSP47 eye drops are a promising prophylactic and therapeutic option against dry eye syndrome in chronic GVHD.",Citron Rho-interacting kinase silencing causes cytokinesis failure and reduces tumor growth in multiple myeloma.,https://www.ncbi.nlm.nih.gov/pubmed/30940634,Blood advances,2019 06 10,"Citron Rho-interacting serine/threonine kinase (CIT) is a serine/threonine kinase that acts as a key component of the midbody and is essential for cytokinesis. CIT has been reported to be highly expressed in some tumor tissues and to play a role in cancer proliferation; however, the significance of CIT has not been investigated in multiple myeloma (MM). Here, we identified, by protein microarray and immunohistochemistry, that CIT is 1 of the upregulated proteins in the plasma cells of MM patients compared with healthy controls. Analysis of a gene expression profile data set showed that MM patients with high CIT gene expression had significantly worse overall survival compared with MM patients with low CIT gene expression. CIT silencing in MM cell lines induced cytokinesis failure and resulted in decreased MM cell proliferation in vitro and in vivo. TP53 expression was found to be an independent predictor of CIT dependency, with low-TP53 cell lines exhibiting a strong dependency on CIT. This study provides the rationale for CIT being a potential therapeutic target in MM in future trials.",Transient activity of the florigen complex during the floral transition in Arabidopsis thaliana.,https://www.ncbi.nlm.nih.gov/pubmed/30940631,"Development (Cambridge, England)",2019 04 03,"FLOWERING LOCUS T (FT) is an essential component of florigen in Arabidopsis thaliana Transcription of FT is induced in leaves, and the resulting FT protein is transported to the shoot apex, in which it initiates floral development. Previous analyses suggest that, together with the b-ZIP transcription factor FD, FT regulates the transcription of downstream targets such as APETALA1 (AP1) in floral anlagen. However, conclusive in vivo evidence that FT is transported to the shoot apex to form an FT-FD complex is lacking. Here, using an innovative in vivo imaging technique, we show that the FT-FD complex and AP1 colocalise in floral anlagen. In addition, the FT-FD complex disappears soon after the floral transition owing to a reduction in FD transcripts in the shoot apex. We further show that misinduction of FD activity after the transition leads to defective reproductive development. Taken together, our results indicate that the FT-FD complex functions as a transient stimulus and imply that a regulatory mechanism exists during the floral transition that reduces FT-FD complex levels via modulation of FD expression.",Chemoprevention of Azoxymethane-induced Colon Carcinogenesis by Delta-Tocotrienol.,https://www.ncbi.nlm.nih.gov/pubmed/30940630,"Cancer prevention research (Philadelphia, Pa.)",2019 06 04,"This study evaluated the preclinical activity of δ-tocotrienol (DT3), a bioactive form of vitamin E, in the inhibition of colorectal cancer growth and development in vitro and in vivo DT3 is the most bioactive isomer of vitamin E in inhibiting growth of colorectal cancer cells. However, it had little effect on the proliferation of normal colon mucosal cells NCM460. In HCT-116 and SW-620 colorectal cancer cells, DT3 (50 μmol/L) significantly inhibited malignant transformation (P < 0.02, P < 0.001), cell migration (P < 0.02, P < 0.05), and invasion (P < 0.05, P < 0.01) compared with vehicle. DT3 inhibited markers for epithelial (E-cadherin) to mesenchymal (vimentin) transition, metastasis (matrix metalloproteinase 9), angiogenesis VEGF, inflammation (NF-κB), and Wnt signaling (β-catenin) compared with vehicle in colorectal cancer cells. DT3 induced apoptosis selectively in colorectal cancer cells (SW-620 cells, HCT-116 cells, and HT-29) without affecting the normal colon cells. In the azoxymethane-induced colorectal carcinogenesis model in rats, DT3 (200 mg/kg orally twice a day) for 20 weeks significantly inhibited colorectal polyps by 70% and colorectal cancer by almost 99% compared with the vehicle treatment group (P < 0.02, P < 0.001), and the cancer inhibition effect was more potent than sulindac (50%). Taken together, these data demonstrate that DT3 is a potential chemopreventive agent in colorectal cancer, warranting further investigation into its clinical use in the prevention and treatment of colorectal cancer.",Prediction of Human Nonlinear Pharmacokinetics of a New Bcl-2 Inhibitor Using PBPK Modeling and Interspecies Extrapolation Strategy.,https://www.ncbi.nlm.nih.gov/pubmed/30940629,Drug metabolism and disposition: the biological fate of chemicals,2019 05 17,"S 55746 ((S)-N-(4-hydroxyphenyl)-3-(6-(3-(morpholinomethyl)-1,2,3,4-tetrahydroisoquinoline-2-carbonyl)benzo[d][1,3]dioxol-5-yl)-N-phenyl-5,6,7,8-tetrahydroindolizine-1-carboxamide) is a new selective Bcl-2 (B-cell lymphoma 2) inhibitor developed by Servier Laboratories and used to restore apoptosis functions in cancer patients. The aim of this work was to develop a translational approach using physiologically based (PB) pharmacokinetic (PK) modeling for interspecies extrapolation to anticipate the nonlinear PK behavior of this new compound in patients. A PBPK mouse model was first built using a hybrid approach, defining scaling factors (determined from in vitro data) to correct in vitro clearance parameters and predicted Kp (partition coefficient) values. The qualification of the hybrid model using these empirically determined scaling factors was satisfactorily completed with rat and dog data, allowing extrapolation of the PBPK model to humans. Human PBPK simulations were then compared with clinical trial data from a phase 1 trial in which the drug was given orally and daily to cancer patients. Human PBPK predictions were within the 95% prediction interval for the eight dose levels, taking into account both the nonlinear dose and time dependencies occurring in S 55746 kinetics. Thus, the proposed PK interspecies extrapolation strategy, based on preclinical and in vitro information and physiologic assumptions, could be a useful tool for predicting human plasma concentrations at the early stage of drug development.",Genetic aspects of idiopathic paediatric uveitis and juvenile idiopathic arthritis associated uveitis in Chinese Han.,https://www.ncbi.nlm.nih.gov/pubmed/30940621,The British journal of ophthalmology,2019 04 03,Idiopathic paediatric uveitis (IPU) and juvenile idiopathic arthritis associated uveitis (JIA-U) are the two most common entities in paediatric uveitis.

In most cases, the underlying cause is unknown. We sought to identify genetic defects in pediatric ES (pES), based on a hypothesis of strong genetic determinism. In a national, prospective cohort of 203 patients with early-onset ES (median (range) age at last follow-up: 16.3 years (1.2-41.0)) initiated in 2004, 80 non-selected consecutive individuals underwent genetic testing. The clinical data were analyzed as a function of the genetic findings. Fifty-two patients (65%) received a genetic diagnosis (the M+ group): 49 carried germline mutations, and 3 carried somatic variants. Thirty-two (40%) had pathogenic mutations in one of 9 genes known to be involved in primary immunodeficiencies (TNFRSF6, CTLA4, STAT3, PIK3CD, CBL, ADAR1, LRBA, RAG1, and KRAS), whereas 20 patients (25%) carried probable pathogenic variants in 16 genes that had not previously been reported in the context of autoimmune disease. Lastly, no genetic abnormalities were found in the remaining 28 patients (35%, the M- group). The M+ group displayed more severe disease than the M- group, with a greater frequency of additional immunopathologic manifestations and a greater median number of lines of treatment. Six patients (all from the M+ group) died during the study. In conclusion, pES was potentially genetically determined in at least 65% of cases. Systematic, wide-ranging genetic screening should be offered in pES; the genetic findings have prognostic significance and may guide the choice of a targeted treatment."

We included every patient with TOS who was treated surgically by the same surgeon at a single hospital between 1999 and 2014 with a minimum follow-up of 4 years. The primary outcome was the overall evaluation of the function by the QuickDASH Score. Secondary outcomes included functional, subjective outcomes, pain levels, and neuropathic features. The clinical outcome of 70 cases was evaluated with a mean follow-up of 8.5 years. The improvement in the QuickDASH Score was significant with an average change of 38 points. Mean pain intensity was reduced postoperatively by 1.6 points from 5.1/10 to 3.5/10. Persistent pain rate at 4/10 or more remained in 56% of cases. These cases were mostly neuropathic. The surgical procedure significantly reduced the number of patients suffering from paresthesia, numbing or weakness. The possibility of sequelae and the persistence of neuropathic pain means the surgical indication should be limited to patients with significant functional disability despite well-conducted rehabilitation. The long-term functional outcomes in patients undergoing TOS was mostly good but could be improved by addressing residual neuropathic pain symptoms.",Social network analysis for better understanding of influenza.,https://www.ncbi.nlm.nih.gov/pubmed/30940598,Journal of biomedical informatics,2019 05 08,"The objective of this study is to improve the understanding of spatial spreading of complicated cases of influenza that required hospitalizations, by creating heatmaps and social networks.

Increasing numbers of laboratories utilize a broad spectrum of well-established and recently developed methods for the determination of cholesterol and non-cholesterol sterols (NCS). In order to evaluate the quality of these measurements and to identify possible sources of analytical errors our group initiated the first international survey for cholesterol and NCS. The cholesterol and NCS survey was structured as a two-part survey which took place in the years 2013 and 2014. The first survey part was designed as descriptive, providing information about the variation of reported results from different laboratories. A set of two lyophilized pooled sera (A and B) was sent to twenty laboratories specialized in chromatographic lipid analysis. The different sterols were quantified either by gas chromatography-flame ionization detection, gas chromatography- or liquid chromatography-mass selective detection. The participants were requested to determine cholesterol and NCS concentrations in the provided samples as part of their normal laboratory routine. The second part was designed as interventional survey. Twenty-two laboratories agreed to participate and received again two different lyophilized pooled sera (C and D). In contrast to the first international survey, each participant received standard stock solutions with defined concentrations of cholesterol and NCS. The participants were requested to use diluted calibration solutions from the provided standard stock solutions for quantification of cholesterol and NCS. In both surveys, each laboratory used its own internal standard (5α-cholestane, epicoprostanol or deuterium labelled sterols). Main outcome of the survey was, that unacceptably high interlaboratory variations for cholesterol and NCS concentrations are reported, even when the individual laboratories used the same calibration material. We discuss different sources of errors and recommend all laboratories analysing cholesterol and NCS to participate in regular quality control programs.",Antioxidant effects of sulforaphane in human HepG2 cells and immortalised hepatocytes.,https://www.ncbi.nlm.nih.gov/pubmed/30940595,Food and chemical toxicology : an international journal published for the British Industrial Biological Research Association,2019 05 07,"Sulforaphane (SFN) has shown anti-cancer effects in cellular and animal studies but its effectiveness has been limited in human studies. Here, the effects of SFN were measured in both human hepatocytes (HHL5) and hepatoma (HepG2) cells. Results showed that SFN inhibited cell viability and induced DNA strand breaks at high doses (≥20 μM). It also activated the nuclear factor (erythroid-derived 2)-like 2 (Nrf2), and increased intracellular glutathione (GSH) levels at 24 h. Pre-treatment with a low dose SFN (≤5 μM) protected against hydrogen peroxide (H2O2)-induced cell damage. High doses of SFN were more toxic towards HHL5 compared to HepG2 cells; the difference is likely due to the disparity in the responses of Nrf2-driven enzymes and -GSH levels between the two cell lines. In addition, HepG2 cells hijacked the cytoprotective effect of SFN over a wider dose range (1.25-20 μM) compared to HHL5. Manipulation of levels of GSH and Nrf2 in HepG2 cells confirmed that both molecules mediate the protective effects of SFN against H2O2. The non-specific nature of SFN in the regulation of cell death and survival could present undesirable risks, i.e. be more toxic to normal cells, and cause chemo-resistance in tumor cells. These issues should be addressed in the context for cancer prevention and treatment before large scale clinical trials are undertaken.",Short-term effects of Garcinia cambogia extract on the pharmacokinetics of lamotrigine given as a single-dose in Wistar rats.,https://www.ncbi.nlm.nih.gov/pubmed/30940594,Food and chemical toxicology : an international journal published for the British Industrial Biological Research Association,2019 05 07,"Garcinia cambogia supplements are widely used for weight loss.

In the first study (co-administration study), rats were orally co-administered with a single-dose of G. cambogia extract (821 mg/kg) and LTG (10 mg/kg). In the second study (pre-treatment study), rats were orally pre-treated for 14 days with G. cambogia extract (821 mg/kg/day), being LTG administered (10 mg/kg) on the 15th day. Rats of the control groups received water instead of the extract. Following LTG administration, blood samples were collected until 96 h post-dose, and plasma LTG concentrations were determined and submitted to a non-compartmental analysis. Globally, no statistically significant effects were identified in the co-administration study of G. cambogia extract and LTG. In the 14-day pre-treatment study, a statistically significant decrease in the rate of systemic exposure to LTG and an increase of apparent volume of distribution were found. Even so, a minor or no clinical impact is expected from the administration of G. cambogia dietary supplements and LTG.","Evaluation of physical, mechanical and biological properties of poly 3-hydroxybutyrate-chitosan-multiwalled carbon nanotube/silk nano-micro composite scaffold for cartilage tissue engineering applications.",https://www.ncbi.nlm.nih.gov/pubmed/30940593,International journal of biological macromolecules,2019 05 21,"Nano-micro scaffolds are developed for long-term healing tissue engineering like cartilage. The poly 3-hydroxybutyrate (P3HB)-chitosan/silk and P3HB-chitosan-1 wt% multi-walled carbon nanotubes functionalized by COOH (MWNTs)/silk nano-micro scaffolds are fabricated through electrospinning the solution on a knitted silk which is saturated (S) or unsaturated (U) with P3HB as a mediator to enhance the interaction at nano/microinterface. Consuming MWNTs lead to a decrease in fiber diameter, while an increase in specific surface area, tensile strength and bioactivity properties. The saturation condition as well as MWNTs leads to intensification in the hydrophilicity properties. The nanolayer in all scaffolds lead to an increase in tensile strength in comparison with the pure knitted silk. The scaffold containing MWNTs showed slower degradation rate. MWNTs beside the chitosan and silk provide an appropriate environment for attachment and growth of chondrocytes.

At screening test, NST/CS had the highest tetracycline degradation efficiency of 91% for duration of 20 min under visible light. The blending of chitosan with NST increases the rate of photocatalytic degradation of tetracycline about 2 times. A detail characterization including HRTEM, SEM, EDS and DRS were conducted for NST/CS, the most active photocatalyst in this study. Photocatalytic activity test was conducted by varying tetracycline concentration, irradiation time, catalyst's concentration and pH using response surface methodology to find out the optimum condition for photocatalytic activity. The reusability of as-synthesized NST/CS was assessed which due to its high recoverability can be applied as an effective catalyst for degradation of organic substances in water and wastewater especially for degradation of emerging pollutants such pharmaceutical pollutants.

The chemical compositions, relative average molecular weights, monosaccharide compositions, FT-IR spectra, and rheological properties of the two proteoglycans were determined. The results exhibited that the two proteoglycans had pseudoplastic fluids properties and displayed shear-thinning behavior. The apparent viscosity of the two proteoglycans both increased with increasing concentrations. The temperature had different effects on the viscosity of the two proteoglycans. As temperature increased from 25 to 85 °C, the viscosity of LPP descended while the HPP's viscosity rose first and then dropped slightly. The effects of CaCl2 addition on the two samples were like that of the temperature. The viscosities of HPP and LPP had different tolerances to acidity and alkalinity. HPP solution was more sensitive to pH changes due to its high protein content. The addition of sucrose increased the viscosities of samples. The modulus G' and G″ of HPP and LPP were increased with the increase of oscillation frequency, while the crossover points of G' and G″ values decreased with the increasing concentrations of HPP and LPP. The above data presented that the two proteoglycans could be promising candidates for food industries and pharmacological applications."

The miRNAs involved in regulating immune responses were analyzed by high-throughput sequencing. A total of 164 mature miRNAs were identified, of which 17 miRNAs were differentially expressed (DE miRNAs) after E. tarda infection, indicating that they were immune-related miRNAs. To further examine the relationship between the miRNAs and their predicted target mRNAs, a total of 22 predicted target mRNAs, mainly related to endocytic signaling pathway, NF-κB signaling pathway, and p53 signaling pathway, were detected with miRNA mimics in HEK-293T cells by dual-luciferase reporter experiments. Finally, we confirmed that insulin receptor substrate-2 (IRS2a and IRS2b) were regulated by miR-7a. And the target sites of the 3' untranslated region (UTR) of IRS2a and IRS2b were verified by dual-luciferase reporter experiments. Furthermore, we found that the E. tarda and LPS significantly increased host miR-7a expression. In vivo and in vitro studies revealed that IRS2-mediated PI3K/AKT/GSK3β signaling pathway was suppressed. Taken together, these results implied that miR-7a might be a key regulator of PI3K/AKT/GSK3β signaling pathway via suppressing the IRS2a and IRS2b genes.","Interferon-regulatory factors, IRF3 and IRF7 in Asian seabass, Lates calcarifer: Characterization, ontogeny and transcriptional modulation upon challenge with nervous necrosis virus.",https://www.ncbi.nlm.nih.gov/pubmed/30940578,Fish & shellfish immunology,2019 05 07,"Interferon regulatory factor (IRF) 3 and IRF7 are key regulators of type I interferon (IFN) gene expression for the antiviral immune response. In the present study, interferon regulatory factor 3 and 7 from Asian seabass, namely AsIRF3 and AsIRF7 were cloned and characterized. The full-length cDNA sequence of IRF3 and IRF7 consisted of 2965 and 2343 bp respectively. AsIRF3 and AsIRF7 were true orthologes of vertebrate IRF3/7 and showed similar domain organization, with an N-terminal DBD which consisted five tryptophan residues in IRF3 and four in IRF7, a C-terminal IRF3 domain and a serine rich region. Both IRF3 and 7 constitutively expressed during the ontogenesis and in all tissues of healthy fish. The expression of both genes was up-regulated following NNV challenge with obvious transcript abundance in brain heart and kidney. Ectopic expression of AsIRF3 and AsIRF7 displayed activation of ISRE/NF-κB promoters and modulation of interferon, ISGs and pro-inflammatory cytokine gene expression. These observations indicated that IRF3 and IRF7 play an important role in Asian seabass's antiviral defense and the RIG-IRF-IFN axis is conserved in the species.","De novo assembly, characterization of tissue-specific transcriptomes and identification of immune related genes from the scallop Argopecten purpuratus.",https://www.ncbi.nlm.nih.gov/pubmed/30940577,Fish & shellfish immunology,2019 05 07,"The scallop Argopecten purpuratus is one of the most economically important cultured mollusks on the coasts from Chile and Peru but its production has declined, in part, due to the emergence of mass mortality events of unknown origin. Driven by this scenario, increasing progress has been made in recent years in the comprehension of immune response mechanisms in this species. However, it is still not entirely understood how different mucosal interfaces participate and cooperate with the immune competent cells, the hemocytes, in the immune defense. Thus, in this work we aimed to characterize the transcriptome of three tissues with immune relevance from A. purpuratus by next-generation sequencing and de novo transcriptome assembly. For this, 18 cDNA libraries were constructed from digestive gland, gills and hemocytes tissues of scallops from different immune conditions and sequenced by the Illumina HiSeq4000 platform. A total of 967.964.884 raw reads were obtained and 967.432.652 clean reads were generated. The clean reads were de novo assembled into 46.601 high quality contigs and 32.299 (69.31%) contigs were subsequently annotated. In addition, three de novo specific assemblies were performed from clean reads obtained from each tissue cDNA libraries for their comparison. Gene ontology (GO) and KEGG analyses revealed that annotated sequences from digestive gland, gills and hemocytes could be classified into both general and specific subcategory terms and known biological pathways, respectively, according to the tissue nature. Finally, several immune related candidate genes were identified, and the differential expression of tissue-specific genes was established, suggesting they could display specific roles in the host defense. The data presented in this study provide the first insight into the tissue specific transcriptome profiles of A. purpuratus, which should be considered for further research on the interplay between the hemocytes and mucosal immune responses.",Influence of phototherapy on bond strength and failure modes of enamel bonded to ceramic and metallic brackets with different surface treatment regimes.,https://www.ncbi.nlm.nih.gov/pubmed/30940576,Photodiagnosis and photodynamic therapy,2019 04 03,"The aim of the current study was to assess efficacy of phototherapy on mode of failure and shear bond strength among different brackets in combination with dissimilar conditioning regimens on enamel surface MATERIAL AND METHODS: Ninety maxillary premolars were arbitrarily assigned into six groups (n = 15 each) based on surface conditioning of enamel.

All samples from each group were positioned in a in a universal testing machine for shear bond strength testing. Ten samples from each group were used to discover the sites of bond failure using ARI with stereomicroscope.

Indeed, the liver possesses an extraordinary regenerative capacity orchestrated by a highly coordinated response of all the different cell types in order to recover the tissue lost, while maintaining homeostasis and all the hepatic functions. To achieve this impressive physiological accomplishment, the liver experiences a transient but precisely controlled transcriptional reprogramming that allows the simultaneous activation and silencing of multiple genes at different stages of the regeneration process. Epigenetic events play a fundamental role in the organization of chromatin architecture and hence in the tight control of gene transcription. In this review, we will summarize the most relevant epigenetic modifications associated with the critical changes in gene expression and cellular behavior occurring during liver regeneration. We will discuss the relevance of DNA methylation, histone modifications, and chromatin remodelers, and the interplay between these epigenetic events, during the regeneration process, mainly after partial hepatectomy or after chemical injury.","Perceived and objective characteristics of the neighborhood environment are associated with accelerometer-measured sedentary time and physical activity, the CARDIA Study.",https://www.ncbi.nlm.nih.gov/pubmed/30940573,Preventive medicine,2019 05 24,"We investigated cross-sectional and longitudinal associations of neighborhood environment characteristics with accelerometer-measured sedentary time (SED), light-intensity physical activity (LPA), and moderate-to-vigorous intensity physical activity (MVPA). Participants were 2120 men and women in the year 20 (2005-2006) and year 30 CARDIA exams (2015-2016). Year 20 neighborhood characteristics included neighborhood cohesion, resources for physical activity, poverty, and racial residential segregation. Physical activity was measured by accelerometer at years 20 and 30. Multivariable linear regression models examined associations of standardized neighborhood measures at year 20 with SED, LPA, and MVPA assessed that year, and with 10-year changes in SED, LPA, and MVPA. Cross-sectionally, a one standard deviation (SD) increase in cohesion was associated with 4.06 less SED min/day (95% CI: -7.98, -0.15), and 4.46 more LPA min/day (95% CI: 0.88, 8.03). Each one SD increase in resources was associated with 1.19 more MVPA min/day (95% CI: 0.06, 2.31). A one SD increase in poverty was associated with 11.18 less SED min/day (95% CI: -21.16, -1.18) and 10.60 more LPA min/day (95% CI: 1.79, 19.41) among black men. No neighborhood characteristic was associated with 10-year changes in physical activity in the full sample; however, a one SD increase in cohesion was associated with a 10-year decrease of 25.44 SED min/day (95% CI: -46.73, -4.14) and an increase of 19.0 LPA min/day (95% CI, 1.89, 36.10) in black men. Characteristics of the neighborhood environment are associated with accelerometer-measured physical activity. Differences were observed by race and sex, with more robust findings observed in black men.",Exposure to household tobacco smoke and risk of cancer morbidity and mortality: Analysis of data from the Afghanistan Demographic and Health Survey 2015.,https://www.ncbi.nlm.nih.gov/pubmed/30940572,Preventive medicine,2019 05 24,"Active and secondhand tobacco exposures are major causes of cancer. Cancer prevention efforts are particularly relevant in resource-constrained settings in which significant barriers to early detection and cancer treatments contribute to poor outcomes. We assess the associations between exposure to household tobacco smoke and cancer morbidity and mortality. We used household data from Afghanistan Demographic and Health Survey, which was a national cross-sectional survey that applied a two-stage stratified random sampling technique in 2015 and 2016. We performed regression analysis to estimate associations between exposure to household tobacco smoke and cancer morbidity and mortality at the household level. Exposure to household tobacco smoke was significantly associated with household reports of a history of any cancer (Adjusted Odds Ratio (AOR): 1.90; 95% Confidence Interval (CI): 1.44, 2.51), breast cancer (1.59; 1.00, 2.55), lung cancer (2.88; 1.58, 5.27), and liver cancer (2.56; 1.10, 5.96), compared to households with no tobacco smoke exposure. These associations persisted after controlling for household location, wealth index, type of cooking fuel used in house, and location of food preparation. Households in a rural location experienced significantly higher mortality of any cancer (4.40; 95% CI: 1.57, 12.38), breast cancer (2.91; 1.02, 8.25), and liver cancer (3.91; 1.29, 11.89) vs. those in an urban location. Exposure to household tobacco smoke is a risk factor for cancer morbidity in Afghanistan. Strategies to implement comprehensive smoking cessation and smoke free housing policies are urgently needed as primary cancer prevention strategy in Afghanistan and comparable resource-constrained settings.",Impact of legislation on youth indoor tanning behaviour: A systematic review.,https://www.ncbi.nlm.nih.gov/pubmed/30940571,Preventive medicine,2019 05 24,"Jurisdictions around the world have implemented indoor tanning legislations, which aim to protect all individuals, especially youth, from dangers of artificial ultraviolet radiation exposure. The objective of this study was to conduct a systematic review to synthesize the available peer-reviewed literature to determine whether indoor tanning legislation has impacted the prevalence of youth indoor tanning. Following PRISMA guidelines, six databases were searched in 2016. Reference lists from relevant articles were also searched. An updated literature search was conducted in 2018. Each article was critically appraised using a merged checklist created from two previously validated checklists. All articles meeting the inclusion criteria were retained after appraisal. Seven studies, all conducted in the U.S., met the inclusion criteria. All studies used an observational, cross-sectional design. There were small absolute decreases in youth indoor tanning prevalence after legislation vs before (n = 3, mean = 3% decrease, range = 1%-6% decrease). Prevalence of youth indoor tanning was significantly lower in states with indoor tanning legislation vs states without legislation (n = 4, mean = 5% lower, range = 1%-18% lower). Prevalence of youth indoor tanning was lower in states with longer standing indoor tanning legislation vs states with more recently implemented legislation (n = 2, mean = 9% lower, range = 2%-20% lower). Indoor tanning legislation is generally associated with lower indoor tanning prevalence among youth. The small percent differences equate to millions of youth at the population level. Longer time lapses from legislation implementation to evaluation, coupled with greater enforcement, compliance, legislative stringency, and public education may result in even more pronounced declines in youth indoor tanning prevalence.",X-ray driven reduction of Cpd I of Catalase-3 from N. crassa reveals differential sensitivity of active sites and formation of ferrous state.,https://www.ncbi.nlm.nih.gov/pubmed/30940570,Archives of biochemistry and biophysics,2019 05 21,"Catalases are biotechnologically relevant enzymes because of their applications in food technology, bioremediation, and biomedicine. The dismutation of hydrogen peroxide occurs in two steps; in the first one, the enzyme forms an oxidized compound I (Cpd I) and in the second one, the enzyme is reduced to the ferric state. In this research work, we analyzed the reduction of Cpd I by X-ray radiation damage during diffraction experiments in crystals of CAT-3, a Large-Size Subunit Catalase (LSC) from Neurospora crassa. A Multi-Crystal Data collection Strategy was applied in order to obtain the Cpd I structure at a resolution of 2.2 Å; this intermediate was highly sensitive to X-ray and was easily reduced at very low deposited radiation dose, causing breakage of the Fe=O bond. The comparison of the structures showed reduced intermediates and also evidenced the differential sensitivity per monomer. The resting ferric state was reduced to the ferrous state, an intermediate without a previous report in LSC. The chemically obtained Cpd I and the X-ray reduced intermediates were identified by UV-visible microspectrometry coupled to data collection. The differential sensitivity and the formation of a ferrous state are discussed, emphasizing the importance of the correct interpretation in the oxidation state of the iron heme.",Mutations of Cys and Ser residues in the α5-subunit of the 20S proteasome from Saccharomyces cerevisiae affects gating and chronological lifespan.,https://www.ncbi.nlm.nih.gov/pubmed/30940569,Archives of biochemistry and biophysics,2019 05 21,"In addition to autophagy, proteasomes are critical for regulating intracellular protein levels and removing misfolded proteins. The 20S proteasome (20SPT), the central catalytic unit, is sometimes flanked by regulatory units at one or both ends. Additionally, proteosomal activation has been associated with increased lifespan in many organisms. Our group previously reported that the gating (open/closed) of the free 20S proteasome is redox controlled, and that S-glutathionylation of two Cys residues (Cys76 and Cys221) in the α5 subunit promotes gate opening. The present study constructed site-directed mutants of these Cys residues, and evaluated the effects these mutations have on proteosome gate opening and yeast cell survival. Notably, the double mutation of both Cys residues (Cys76 and Cys221) rendered the cells nonviable, whereas the lifespan of the yeast carrying the single mutations (α5-C76S or α5-C221S) was attenuated when compared to the wild type counterpart. Furthermore, it was found that α5-C76S or α5-C221S 20SPT were more likely to be found with the gate in a closed conformation. In contrast, a random α5-subunit double mutation (S35P/C221S) promoted gate opening, increased chronological lifespan and provided resistance to oxidative stress. The 20SPT core particle purified from the long-lived strain degraded model proteins (e.g., α-synuclein) more efficiently than preparations obtained from the wild-type counterpart, and also displayed an increased chymotrypsin-like activity. Mass spectrometric analyses of the C76S, C221S, S35P/C221S, S35P and S35P/C76S mutants provided evidence that the highly conserved Cys76 residue of the α5-subunit is the key determinant for gate opening and cellular survival. The present study reveals a sophisticated regulatory mechanism that controls gate opening, which appears to be based on the interactions among multiple residues within the α5-subunit, and consequently impacts the lifespan of yeast."

Toxicology & pharmacology : CBP,2019 06 05,"Toxicity of AgNPs has been widely studied in waterborne exposed aquatic organisms. However, toxic effects caused by AgNPs ingested through the diet and depending on the season are still unexplored. The first cell response after exposure to xenobiotics occurs at gene transcription level. Thus, the aim of this study was to assess transcription level effects in the digestive gland of female mussels after dietary exposure to AgNPs both in autumn and in spring. Mussels were fed daily for 21 days with Isochrysis galbana microalgae previously exposed for 24 h to a dose close to environmentally relevant concentrations of 1 μg Ag/L PVP/PEI coated 5 nm AgNPs (in spring) and to a higher dose of 10 μg Ag/L of the same AgNPs both in autumn and in spring. After 1 and 21 days, mussels RNA was hybridized in a custom microarray containing 7806 annotated genes. Mussels were more responsive to the high dose compared to the low dose of AgNPs and a higher number of probes were altered in autumn than in spring. In both seasons, significantly regulated genes were involved in the cytoskeleton and lipid transport and metabolism COG categories, among others, while genes involved in carbohydrate transport and metabolism were specifically altered in autumn. Overall, transcription patterns were differently altered depending on the exposure time and season, indicating that season should be considered in ecotoxicological studies of metal nanoparticles in mussels.",Bioavailability of microplastic-bound pollutants in vitro: The role of adsorbate lipophilicity and surfactants.,https://www.ncbi.nlm.nih.gov/pubmed/30940555,Comparative biochemistry and physiology. Toxicology & pharmacology : CBP,2019 05 11,"The potential role of microplastic particles (MPs) as vectors for lipophilic organic pollutants enhancing their uptake by organisms has repeatedly been discussed in the scientific community. Likewise, several studies indicate an important role of surfactants in pollutant-transfer from MP to organisms. Employing polyethylene particles, the bioavailability of three MP-bound inducers of 7-ethoxyresorufin-O-deethylase (EROD) with variable lipophilicity was quantitatively compared via EROD activity in RTL-W1 cells. In addition, non-cytotoxic surfactant concentrations of Pluronic F-127, rhamnolipids, sodium deoxycholate and sodium dodecyl sulfate (SDS) supplemented to the medium were tested for their effects on pollutant desorption from MPs as well as on cellular EROD induction. Bioavailability of MP-bound pollutants was negatively correlated with lipophilicity, and all surfactants were found to modulate the cellular response towards inducers by unidentified mechanisms. After experimental correction for effects on the cellular response, all surfactants except SDS moderately increased desorption of inducer from MPs. Results on the impact of lipophilicity agree with previously published thermodynamic models, indicating that appreciable pollutant desorption from MPs may only occur for substances with comparatively low lipophilicity, the accumulation of which on MPs is negligible in the environment. However, the role of surfactants should be considered further with respect to potential effects on sorption of pollutants to and from MPs.",Identification of regulatory elements recapitulating early expression of L-plastin in the zebrafish enveloping layer and embryonic periderm.,https://www.ncbi.nlm.nih.gov/pubmed/30940554,Gene expression patterns : GEP,2019 05 15,"We have cloned and characterized an intronic fragment of zebrafish lymphocyte cytosolic protein 1 (lcp1, also called L-plastin) that drives expression to the zebrafish enveloping layer (EVL). L-plastin is a calcium-dependent actin-bundling protein belonging to the plastin/fimbrin family of proteins, and is necessary for the proper migration and attachment of several adult cell types, including leukocytes and osteoclasts. However, in zebrafish lcp1 is abundantly expressed much earlier, during differentiation of the EVL. The cells of this epithelial layer migrate collectively, spreading vegetally over the yolk. L-plastin expression persists into the larval periderm, a transient epithelial tissue that forms the first larval skin. This finding establishes that L-plastin is activated in two different embryonic waves, with a distinct regulatory switch between the early EVL and the later leukocyte. To better study L-plastin expressing cells we attempted CRISPR/Cas9 homology-driven recombination (HDR) to insert a self-cleaving peptide (Cre-P2A-EGFP-CAAX) downstream of the native lcp1 promoter. This produced a stable zebrafish line expressing Cre recombinase in EVL nuclei and green fluorescence in EVL cell membranes. In vivo tracking of these labeled cells provided enhanced views of EVL migration behavior, membrane extensions, and mitotic events. Finally, we experimentally dissected key elements of the targeted lcp1 locus, discovering a ∼300 bp intronic sequence sufficient to drive EVL expression. The lcp1: Cre-P2A-EGFP-CAAX zebrafish should be useful for studying enveloping layer specification, gastrulation movements and periderm development in this widely used vertebrate model. In addition, the conserved regulatory sequences we have isolated predict that L-plastin orthologs may have a similar early expression pattern in other vertebrate embryos.",Smaller-Diameter Covered Transjugular Intrahepatic Portosystemic Shunt Stents Are Associated With Increased Survival.,https://www.ncbi.nlm.nih.gov/pubmed/30940552,Clinical gastroenterology and hepatology : the official clinical practice journal of the American Gastroenterological Association,2019 05 11,"We studied the effects of diameter of covered, self-expandable, nitinol stents on survival times of patients with a transjugular intrahepatic portosystemic shunt (TIPS).",Exposure to diisononyl phthalate induced an increase in blood pressure through activation of the ACE/ AT1R axis and inhibition of NO production.,https://www.ncbi.nlm.nih.gov/pubmed/30940551,Toxicology letters,2019 05 06,"Recent epidemiological studies have found that diisononyl phthalate (DINP) is associated with an increase in blood pressure. However, this correlation had not been clarified, nor has the underlying mechanism been characterized. In this study, C57/BL6 mice were exposed to DINP doses of 0.15 mg/kg/day, 1.5 mg/kg/day or 15 mg/kg/day for 6 weeks. Dexamethasone (DEXA) was used to build the hypertension model. After DINP exposure and 1 mg/kg/day DEXA treatment, the levels of systolic blood pressure (SBP), diastolic blood pressure (DBP), mean blood pressure (MBP) and heart rate (HR) were determined, and any histopathological changes in hypertension targeted organs of the mice were investigated. The results suggest that DINP exposure and DEXA treatment induced marked increases in SBP, DBP, and MBP, and that 15 mg/kg/day DINP exposure could also increase the HR level. Along with the blood pressure increase, DINP exposure induced pathological changes to the heart, aorta, and kidney. To explore the underlying mechanism, we measured the expression of angiotensin converting enzyme (ACE), angiotensin-II type 1 receptor (AT1R) and endothelial nitric oxide synthase (eNOS) in the aorta, as well as the nitric oxide (NO) concentration in serum. The data suggest that DINP exposure and DEXA treatment enhance the expression of ACE and AT1R, and inhibit eNOS expression and NO production. Interestingly, treatment with 5 mg/kg/day ACE inhibitor (ACEI) alleviated the increase in blood pressure induced by DINP exposure and DEXA treatment. These findings expand our understanding of how DINP exposure impacts the development of hypertension, and elucidates the underlying mechanisms.",Mouse model of human poisonings with tetramethylenedisulfotetramine: Characterization of the effect of exposure route on syndrome outcomes.,https://www.ncbi.nlm.nih.gov/pubmed/30940550,Toxicology letters,2019 04 25,"Tetramethylenedisulfotetramine (TMDT) is a synthetic neurotoxic rodenticide and potential chemical threat agent. Signs of TMDT poisoning include convulsions which can progress into status epilepticus and death. Although clinical reports clearly show that poisoning via food and drink is the main route of exposure, experimental studies have primarily utilized parenteral routes. Here we used two different modes of oral administration of TMDT and compared the toxic outcomes with two different parenteral routes. Adult male mice were given various doses of TMDT either perorally in peanut butter or cereal pellets, or injected intraperitoneally (i.p.) or subcutaneously (s.c.). All routes produced the complete TMDT syndrome including twitches, clonic and tonic-clonic seizures and death. However potencies varied with the following rank order: i.p. > s.c. > oral (cereal)>oral (peanut butter). Our data clearly show that ingestion of TMDT with peanut butter markedly reduces the overall syndrome severity relative to oral exposure via cereals. No significant differences were observed by substituting peanut oil for water as a vehicle for i.p. administered TMDT. In conclusion, high vs low fat food can differentially affect TMDT onset of action, probably due to differences in availability from the gastrointestinal tract. These results should be considered when searching for effective treatments for TMDT poisoning.",Implication of environmental estrogens on breast cancer treatment and progression.,https://www.ncbi.nlm.nih.gov/pubmed/30940549,Toxicology,2019 06 14,"Breast cancer is the most diagnosed malignancy among women in the United States. Approximately 70% of breast tumors express estrogen receptor alpha and are deemed ER-positive. ER-positive breast tumors depend upon endogenous estrogens to promote ER-mediated cellular proliferation. Decades of research have led to a fundamental understanding of the role ER signaling in this disease and this knowledge has led to significant advancements in the clinical use of antiestrogens for breast cancer treatment. However, adjuvant breast cancer recurrence and metastatic disease progression due to endocrine therapy resistance are prominent and unresolved issues. The established role that estrogens play in breast cancer pathogenesis explains why some patients initially respond to endocrine therapy but also why a significant number of patients become refractory to antiestrogen treatment. It is been hypothesized that exposure to environmental steroid hormone mimics and/or acquired mechanisms of resistance may explain why endocrine therapy fails in a subset of breast cancer patients. This review will highlight: 1) the relationship between ER signaling and breast cancer pathogenesis, 2) the implication of environmental exposures on steroid hormone regulated processes including breast cancer, and 3) the unresolved issue of endocrine therapy resistance.",Effects of in utero and lactational exposure to phthalates on reproductive development and glycemic homeostasis in rats.,https://www.ncbi.nlm.nih.gov/pubmed/30940548,Toxicology,2019 05 24,"Prenatal exposure to phthalates is associated with reproductive and metabolic systems alterations. We investigated the effects of in utero and lactational exposure to Di-(2-ethyl-hexyl) phthalate (DEHP) and Di-n-butyl phthalate (DBP) on the reproductive system and glycemic homeostasis in male and female offspring of rats. Pregnant rats were exposed to equimolar doses (0.018, 0.18 and 1.8 mmol/kg/day) of DEHP or DBP corresponding to 7, 70, and 700 mg/kg/day for DEHP and 5, 50, and 500 mg/kg/day for DBP, respectively, by oral gavage from gestation day 13 to postnatal day 21, and using canola oil as vehicle control. Male and female offspring were examined for body weight development, external markers of prenatal androgenization and puberty onset, plasma concentrations of glucose and insulin, insulin tolerance (ITT), glucose-stimulated insulin secretion (GSIS), and the expression of peroxisome proliferator-activated receptor gamma (PPARγ) and pancreatic and duodenal homeobox 1 protein (PDX-1). Male and female rats exposed to the highest doses of DEHP and DBP exhibited increased fasting glucose levels. In rats exposed to DEHP 700 mg/kg/day we also observed a reduced glucose decay rate (Kitt) following insulin administration and decreased insulin secretion in the GSIS assay. Male offspring exposed to DEHP 700 mg/kg/day had reduced anogenital distance (AGD) on PDN 4 and delayed preputial separation at puberty, while female offspring exposed to DEHP 70 and 700 mg/kg/day and to the highest DBP dose had delayed vaginal opening. Our results suggest that maternal treatment with DEHP and DBP can induce a wide range of metabolic and reproductive alterations in offspring rats, with more pronounced effects following DEHP exposure.",Comparison of Aristolochic acid I derived DNA adduct levels in human renal toxicity models.,https://www.ncbi.nlm.nih.gov/pubmed/30940547,Toxicology,2019 05 07,"Aristolochic acid (AA) dependent human nephropathy results either from environmental exposure to Aristolochiaceae plant subspecies or their use in traditional phytotherapy. The toxic components are structurally related nitrophenanthrene carboxylic acids, i.e. Aristolochic acid I (AAI) and II (AAII). AAI is considered to be the major cause of Aristolochic acid nephropathy, characterized by severe renal fibrosis and upper urothelial cancer. Following enzymatic activation in kidney and/or liver, AAI metabolites react with genomic DNA to form persistent DNA adducts with purines. To determine whether AAI can be activated in human renal cells to form DNA adducts, we exposed telomerase immortalized renal proximal tubular epithelial cells (RPTEC/TERT1), the human embryonic kidney (HEK293) cell line, as well as primary human kidney cells (pHKC) to AAI in vitro. We modified an isotope dilution ultra-performance liquid chromatography/tandem mass spectrometry (ID-UPLC-MS/MS) based method for the quantification of dA-AAI adducts in genomic DNA. In addition, time dependent accumulation of adducts in renal cortex and bladder tissue from AAI/II treated Eker rats were used to validate the detection method. AAI-induced toxicity in human renal cells was determined by dA-AAI adduct quantification, the impact on cell viability, and NQO1 expression and activity. Our findings demonstrated adduct formation in all cell lines, although only pHKC and RPTEC/TERT1 expressed NQO1. The highest adduct formation was detected in pHKC despite low NQO1 expression, while we observed much lower adduct levels in NQO1-negative HEK293 cells. Adduct formation and decreased cell viability correlated only weakly. Therefore, our data suggested that i.) enzymes other than NQO1 could be at least equally important for AA bioactivation in human renal proximal tubule cells, and ii.) the suggested correlation between adduct levels and viability appears to be questionable.",BmK NT1-induced neurotoxicity is mediated by PKC/CaMKⅡ-dependent ERK1/2 and p38 activation in primary cultured cerebellar granule cells.,https://www.ncbi.nlm.nih.gov/pubmed/30940546,Toxicology,2019 05 24,"Voltage-gated sodium channels (VGSCs) represent molecular targets for a number of potent neurotoxins that affect the ion permeation or gating kinetics. BmK NT1, an α-scorpion toxin purified from Buthus martensii Karch (BMK), induces excitatory neurotoxicity by activation of VGSCs with subsequent overloading of intracellular Ca2+ in cerebellar granule cells (CGCs). In the current study, we further investigated signaling pathways responsible for BmK NT1-induced neurotoxicity in CGCs. BmK NT1 exposure induced neuronal death in different development stages of CGCs with similar potencies ranging from 0.21-0.48 μM. The maximal neuronal death induced by BmK NT1 gradually increased from 25.6% at 7 days in vitro (DIVs) to 42.1%, 47.8%, and 67.2% at 10, 13, and 16 DIVs, respectively, suggesting that mature CGCs are more vulnerable to BmK NT1 exposure. Application of Ca2+/calmodulin-dependent protein kinase Ⅱ (CaMKⅡ) inhibitors, KN-62 or KN-93, but not Ca2+/calmodulin-dependent protein kinase kinase (CaMKK) inhibitor, STO-609, completely abolished BmK NT1-induced neuronal death. Moreover, BmK NT1 exposure stimulated CaMKⅡ phosphorylation. BmK NT1 also stimulated extracellular regulated protein kinases 1/2 (ERK1/2) and p38 phosphorylation which was abolished by tetrodotoxin demonstrating the role of VGSCs on BmK NT1-induced ERK1/2 and p38 phosphorylation. However, BmK NT1 didn't affect c-Jun N-terminal kinase (JNK) phosphorylation. In addition, both ERK1/2 inhibitor, U0126 and p38 inhibitor, SB203580 attenuated BmK NT1-induced neuronal death. Both PKC inhibitor, Gö 6983 and CaMKⅡ inhibitor, KN-62 abolished BmK NT1-induced ERK1/2 and p38 phosphorylation.

A meta-analysis with implications for understanding antipsychotic occupancy.,https://www.ncbi.nlm.nih.gov/pubmed/30940535,Neuropharmacology,2019 04 08,"Using molecular imaging techniques - positron emission tomography (PET) and single-photon emission computed tomography (SPECT) - in conjunction with an acute dopamine depletion challenge (alpha-methyl-para-tyrosine) it is possible to estimate endogenous dopamine levels occupying striatal dopamine D2 receptors (D2R) in humans in vivo. However, it is unclear what proportion of striatal D2R are occupied by endogenous dopamine under normal conditions. This is important since it has been suggested that in schizophrenia there may be a substantial proportion of striatal D2R which are occupied by endogenous dopamine and not accessible by therapeutic doses of antipsychotics. In order to clarify these issues, we conducted a meta-analysis of dopamine depletion studies using substituted benzamide radiotracers in healthy persons. This meta-analysis suggests that anywhere from 8 to 21% (weighted average 11%) of striatal D2R may be occupied by endogenous dopamine at baseline. Using these estimates, we propose an updated occupancy model and tentatively suggest that antipsychotics inhibit a smaller proportion of the total pool of striatal D2R in vivo than previously acknowledged.","Development of a multiplex-PCR to simultaneously detect acquired linezolid resistance genes cfr, optrA and poxtA in enterococci of clinical origin.",https://www.ncbi.nlm.nih.gov/pubmed/30940534,Journal of microbiological methods,2019 04 26,"Linezolid-resistant enterococcus spp. are increasingly recognized by diagnostic laboratories.

In practice,2019 04 28,"Chronic cough is a common, debilitating condition that can persist for years with little relief from medical treatment. Speech pathology treatment is an effective treatment option for patients with chronic cough. This review outlines current speech pathology assessment and treatment for chronic cough and describes the evidence supporting the intervention. The rationale for speech pathology intervention is described with reference to speech pathology training and expertise that are relevant for this condition. Despite the efficacy and advantages of speech pathology intervention, there is limited guidance in the literature on when patients should be referred for treatment. Patients suitable for speech pathology intervention are those whose cough has persisted despite medical management. Speech pathology intervention may be particularly beneficial for patients with coexisting laryngeal disorders such as muscle tension dysphonia or inducible laryngeal obstruction. Limited information is available regarding current speech pathology training, practice, and service delivery for chronic cough internationally.

Theoretical considerations designed to mimick primordial RNAs designed 25 theoretical, minimal 22-nucleotide long circular RNAs (RNA rings) forming stem-loop hairpins, including one codon per amino acid, a start and a stop codon. These RNA rings resemble consensus tRNAs, whose predicted anticodons assign to each RNA ring a potential cognate amino acid. Assuming dual translator and messenger roles, three consecutive translation rounds produce 21-residue-long peptides, seven codons at each round. In these conditions, steric hindrances between tRNA(-like) translators competing for partially overlapping nucleotide triplets can be reduced if none of the seven codons produces by circular permutation (position 1 → 3, or position 3 → 1) any of the six others. This non-permutability of codon sets is one of the conditions that define potential circular codes regulating translational frame. A near-universal maximal self-complementary circular code exists in reading frames of natural genes, and permutations of this circular code define maximal circular codes in each +1, +2 gene frames. Chronologically scaling RNA rings according to the genetic code inclusion order of their cognate amino acid, codon numbers belonging to the natural frame +1 circular code X1 decrease with cognate amino acid inclusion order, those belonging to the natural frame 0 circular code X0 increase. RNA rings with early cognates apparently reflect pre-(tRNA-like)-adaptor translation by direct codon-amino acid affinity with partially overlapping consecutive codons where X1 regulated translation. Translation of non-overlapping consecutive codons evolved in parallel with RNA rings' cognate inclusion in the genetic code and with X0. Hence the complex ""multi-frame"" natural circular codes potentially evolved spontaneously from small coding circular RNAs mimicked by theoretical minimal RNA rings. Modern reading frames evolved from earlier reading frames corresponding to modern +1 frames.",Novel in vivo system to monitor tRNA expression based on the recovery of GFP fluorescence and its application for the determination of plant tRNA expression.,https://www.ncbi.nlm.nih.gov/pubmed/30940526,Gene,2019 05 17,"We developed a novel assay system to quantitatively detect amber codon suppression by tRNAs expressed in plant cells. The assay was based on recovery of the expression of the green fluorescent protein (GFP) as a reporter, in which a fourth Lys codon (AAG) was changed to a premature amber codon TAG, designated as GFP/amber. Plasmids carrying GFP/amber, suppressor tRNA, and red fluorescent protein (RFF) as an internal control, respectively, were introduced into onion epidermal cells to monitor cell numbers with GFP and RFP fluorescence. First, an amber suppressor tRNASer from tobacco (NtS2) to suppress a TAG codon in GFP mRNA was examined, leading to the recovery of GFP fluorescence. Second, we used two different tRNAs (i.e., AtY3II-am and AtY3II-amiG7), both of which are intron-containing amber suppressor tRNAsTyr, the former impaired precursor-tRNA splicing but the latter did not, as confirmed previously using two different approaches (Szeykowska-Kulinska and Beier, 1991; Akama and Beier, 2003). As expected, coexpression of GFP/amber with AtY3II-am gave no green fluorescence, but significant fluorescence was observed with AtY3II-amiG7. Then, we applied this system for the analysis of 5'-regulatory sequences of the tRNAGln gene family from Arabidopsis. A 5'-flanking sequence of each of the 17 tRNAGln genes was fused to a coding region of an amber suppressor tRNASer gene (NtS2/amber) and its 3'-flanking sequence. Chimeric tRNASer gene, GFP/amber, and RFP were coexpressed, and the GFP or RFP fluorescence intensity was determined in cells using laser-scanning microscopy. In parallel, 17 kinds of original Arabidopsis tRNAGln genes and their chimeric genes with NtS2/amber were all analyzed in cell-free nuclear extract (Yukawa et al., 1997). Comparison of in vitro and in vivo expression of these chimeric tRNA genes displayed generally similar results, accompanied by a wide range of variance in the expression of each gene. Nevertheless, the expression patterns of several genes were clearly the opposite of each other comparing between the two different system, demonstrating the importance of in vivo systems in the study on tRNA expression in plants."

Therefore, kainate or 6-hydroxydopamine (6-OHDA) lesions were performed in the vmPFC by iontophoretic method. In the first experiment, taste preference was tested to 250 mM and 500 mM glucose solutions over water in two-bottle choice test. In the second experiment, taste reactivity was examined to 4 concentrations of glucose solutions (250 mM, 500 mM, 750 mM and 1000 mM) and 4 concentrations of quinine solutions (0.125 mM, 0.25 mM, 1.25 mM and 2.5 mM). Our results showed, that kainate microlesion of vmPFC did not modify the preference of 250 mM and 500 mM glucose solutions in two-bottle choice test. In contrast, 6-OHDA microlesion of vmPFC resulted in increased preference to the higher concentration of glucose (500 mM) solution over water.

Due to the complexity of cell metabolism, feedback genetic circuits have emerged as basic tools to combat metabolic heterogeneity, enhance microbial cooperation as well as boost cell's productivity. This is generally achieved by applying social reward-punishment rules to eliminate cheaters and reward winners in a mixed cell population. With metabolite-responsive transcriptional factors to rewire gene expression, metabolic engineers are well-positioned to integrate feedback genetic circuits with growth fitness and achieve dynamic population control. Towards this goal, we argue that feedback genetic circuits and microbial interactions will be a golden mine for future metabolic engineering. We will summarize the design principles of engineering burden-driven feedback control to combat metabolic stress, implementing population quality control to eliminate cheater cell, applying product addiction to reward productive cell, as well as layering dual dynamic regulation to decouple cell growth from product formation. Collectively, these strategies will be useful to improve community-level cellular performance. Encoding such decision-marking functions and reprogramming cellular logics at population level will enable metabolic engineers to deliver robust cell factories and pave the way for intelligent bioproduction. We envision that various cellular regulation mechanisms and genetic/metabolic circuits could be exploited to achieve self-adaptive or autonomous metabolic function for diverse biotechnological and medical applications.

The two pancreatic tumor cell lines showed different reactions against the combined therapy according to their intrinsic sensitivity against Gemcitabine (cell death, ROS production, ability to activate ERK 1/2 and JNK). Finally, tumors (e.g. 3 mL) could be effectively treated by using almost 4.2 × 105 times lower Gemcitabine doses compared to conventional therapies.

The fate of epithelia is determined by factors secreted from the mesenchyme. Retinoic acid (RA) and its receptors are present in the mesenchyme of cranial Müllerian duct. RA induces Müllerian duct to uterine epithelial differentiation whereas inhibition of RA receptors induces vaginal epithelial differentiation. Thus, RA signaling in the Müllerian duct is required to promote differentiation of the mesenchyme into the future uterus. Perinatal estrogen exposure induces various abnormalities in Müllerian duct-derived organs. These include a cranial shift of the border among oviduct, uterus and vagina as well as precancerous lesions suppressed by co-treatment with RA and estrogen. Since RA synthesis enzymes and receptors are expressed both in the epithelium and stroma after birth, RA signaling may act in the epithelia to maintain adult epithelial homeostasis and to prevent irreversible lesions induced by perinatal estrogen exposure.",Dispersibility of phospholipids and their optimization for the efficient production of liposomes using supercritical fluid technology.,https://www.ncbi.nlm.nih.gov/pubmed/30940503,International journal of pharmaceutics,2019 05 01,"Liposomes are promising delivery vehicles and offer the added drawcard of being able to be made functional to target tissues such as cardiac muscle and cancerous cells.

HPV-16 and HPV-18 avidity was lower among HIV+ compared to HIV- men at Month 7 (HPV-16: 1.95 M versus 2.12 M, p = 0.027; HPV-18: 1.50 M versus 1.72 M, p < 0.001). Although differences in peak antibody levels were observed between HIV+ and HIV- men following 3 doses of vaccine, plateau antibody levels were overall comparable, and avidity was relatively high for both groups. These data indicate that the vaccine induced antibody affinity maturation in both HIV+ and HIV- men and will likely result in long-term protective immune responses.",Assessing vaccine hesitancy in the UK population using a generalized vaccine hesitancy survey instrument.,https://www.ncbi.nlm.nih.gov/pubmed/30940484,Vaccine,2019 04 10,"In many regions of the world, vaccine hesitancy has become an important concern to public health.

The aim of the present study was to identify behavioral and biological markers to predict the vulnerability to developing compulsive-like drinking in SIP. Adult male Wistar rats were first trained in a spatial-discrimination serial reversal-learning task and in a reinforcer devaluation task to measure behavioral flexibility and habit formation, respectively. Subsequently, the rats were tested using the SIP protocol and identified as HD or LD based on their drinking rates. The performance of HD and LD rats in the two previous tasks was then analyzed. Before and after SIP exposure, blood glucose and plasma corticosterone (CORT) levels were measured. Additionally, serum electrolyte levels, including sodium, potassium, and chloride, were analyzed after SIP. HD rats showed higher behavioral inflexibility by exhibiting increased perseverative responses in the reversal-learning task and insensitivity to reinforcer devaluation during extinction under selective satiation. After SIP exposure, HD rats exhibited increased basal plasma CORT levels, indicating that this vulnerable group might have a dysregulation of the HPA axis. Although HD and LD rats had blood glucose levels within normal range, the HD group showed lower levels. The HD group did not exhibit hyponatremia (i.e., reduced serum sodium levels) when compared to LD rats after 20 daily SIP sessions. The results of the present study demonstrated that HD rats exhibit behavioral inflexibility and greater habitual-like behavior before SIP. Moreover, these results highlight the importance of measuring different behavioral and biological markers for predicting the vulnerability to developing compulsivity, and for enhancing the understanding of the pathophysiology of compulsive spectrum disorders.",Ketamine ameliorates severe traumatic event-induced antidepressant-resistant depression in a rat model through ERK activation.,https://www.ncbi.nlm.nih.gov/pubmed/30940482,Progress in neuro-psychopharmacology & biological psychiatry,2019 05 28,"Treatment-resistant depression (TRD) is a major public health issue, as it is common for patients with depression to fail to respond to adequate trials of antidepressants. However, a well-established animal model of TRD is still warranted. The present study focused on selective serotonin reuptake inhibitor (SSRI) resistance, and aimed to investigate whether higher levels of traumatic stress caused by greater numbers of foot-shocks may lead to severe depression and to examine the feasibility of this as an animal model of SSRI-resistant depression. To reveal the correlation between traumatic stress and severe depression, rats received 3, 6 and 10 tone (conditioned stimulus, CS)-shock (unconditioned stimulus, US) pairings to mimic mild, moderate, and severe traumatic events, and subsequent depressive-like behaviors and protein immunocontents were analyzed. The antidepressant efficacy was assessed for ketamine and SSRI (i.e., fluoxetine) treatment. We found that only the severe stress group presented depressive-like behaviors. Phosphorylation of extracellular signal-regulated kinases (ERKs) was decreased in the amygdala and prefrontal cortex (PFC). The immunocontents of GluA1 and PSD 95 were increased in the amygdala and decreased in the PFC. Moreover, the glutamate-related abnormalities in the amygdala and PFC were normalized by single-dose (10 mg/kg, i.p.) ketamine treatment. In contrast, the depressive-like behaviors were not reversed by 28 days of fluoxetine treatment (10 mg/kg, i.p.) in the severe stress group. Our data demonstrated that high levels of traumatic stress could lead to SSRI-resistant depressive symptoms through impacts on the glutamatergic system, and that this rat model has the potential to be a feasible animal model of SSRI-resistant depression.",Universal gestational screening for Streptococcus agalactiae colonization and neonatal infection - A systematic review and meta-analysis.,https://www.ncbi.nlm.nih.gov/pubmed/30940481,Journal of infection and public health,2019 04 03,"The review aimed to analyze the evidence of the correlation between universal screening for Streptococcus agalactiae colonization in pregnant women and early onset Group B neonatal infection.

A total of 200 articles were found, of which 198 were excluded. The present review presented some limiting factors, including the low number of studies selected, the difference of patients included, the risk profile of the populations and the results of the isolated studies, expressed in a significant difference between them. The statistical calculations were performed using secondary data. The meta-analysis revealed a Risk Ratio of 0.37 with a 95% of Confidence Interval, indicating a positive factor for the questioning of this review. However, should be understood as a trend, since a small amount of studies were found. More structured clinical studies are recommended to assess the impact of gestational screening for GBS and neonatal infection to better inform public health measures in gestational and neonatal health."

Despite such drawbacks, phenytoin is still essential as a second-line therapy for status epilepticus when patients are resistant to benzodiazepines. This study aimed to develop a population pharmacokinetic model of phenytoin and to propose the optimal dose regimen of phenytoin in Korean epilepsy patients. Concentrations collected from electronic medical records for 117 patients, with 1 or 2 measurements per patient, were analyzed using NONMEM 7.3.0. One-compartment model with first-order elimination where allometry scaling was considered best described the data, yielding the estimates of V and CL of 68.19 (L) and 0.63 (L/h), respectively, for patients with a body weight of 60 kg. Covariate analyses showed that, after birth, clearance increases with age, reaching adult level at 4 years, and after 20 years, it decreases with age. Simulation results showed that the dosing interval should be reduced to achieve optimal dosing in neonates and infants, and the optimal dose required increases with weight.

Although some data suggest a potential connection between biological sex differences and gut microbiota, the connection between sex steroid hormones and gut microbes remained unexplored. The current study investigates the relationship between gut microbes and serum levels of testosterone in men and estradiol in women. Fecal microbiota from a total of 57 men (n = 31) and women (n = 26) were assessed using 16s rRNA gene sequencing. Based on the levels of serum testosterone and estradiol in men and women, respectively, participants were stratified into three groups of Low, Medium, and High. Microbiome communities were analyzed as a function of the steroid hormone within sex. Men and women in the High group harbored more diverse gut microbial communities than others. In men, the abundance of Acinetobacter, Dorea, Ruminococcus, and Megamonas correlated significantly with testosterone levels. Women in the High group have more Bacteroidetes and less Firmicutes phyla than those in the Low group. Genera Slackia and Butyricimonas were significantly correlated with estradiol levels. These results demonstrate that sex steroid hormone levels are correlated with diversity and gut microbial composition, and provide fundamental information helpful for developing communication networks between human and microbial communities.",Immobilization of a β-glucosidase and an endoglucanase in ferromagnetic nanoparticles: A study of synergistic effects.,https://www.ncbi.nlm.nih.gov/pubmed/30940468,Protein expression and purification,2019 05 18,"Nanoparticles can act as support materials for enzymatic immobilization, introducing a balance of characteristics that modulate the efficiency of biocatalysts, such as specific surface area, resistance to mass transfer and effective enzymatic loading. Magnetic nanoparticles can be easily separated using an external magnetic field, and in this work two recombinant enzymes, the β-glucosidase from Humicola insolens (Bglhi) and the endoglucanase from Scytalidium thermophilum (Egst) were immobilized on synthetized Fe3O4 nanoparticles derivatized with chitosan/glutaraldehyde/N-(5-amino-1-carboxy-pentyl) iminodiacetic acid and functionalized with NiCl2. The immobilization yields were about 20% for Bglhi and Egst with efficiencies of 132% and 115%, respectively. The two enzymes were also co-immobilized with yield was about 49%.

We utilized eigenvector centrality (EC) to measure the network information that accumulates as an engram during learning. To discriminate engrams formed by emphasis on speed or accuracy, we conducted functional MRI on 58 normal volunteers as they performed a sequential finger-tapping task with the non-dominant left hand. Participants alternated between performing a tapping sequence as quickly as possible (maximum mode) or at a constant speed of 2 Hz, paced by a sequence-specifying visual cue (constant mode). We depicted the formation of the motor engram by characterizing the dormant state as the increase in EC of the resting epoch throughout the training course, and the ecphory, or activated state, as the increment in EC during the task epoch relative to the alternated resting epoch. We found that a network covering the left anterior intraparietal sulcus and inferior parietal lobule represented the engram for the speed of execution, whereas bilateral premotor cortex and right primary motor cortex represented the sequential order of movements.

We first introduce the major findings in neuroscience and psychology reporting that memory engrams are sometimes diffuse and unstable, indicating that they are dynamically modified processes of consolidation and reconsolidation. Second, we introduce and discuss the concepts of cell assembly and engram cell, the former has been investigated by psychological experiments and behavioral electrophysiology and the latter is defined by recent combination of activity-dependent cell labelling with optogenetics to show causal relationships between cell population activity and behavioral changes. Third, we discuss the similarities and differences between the cell assembly and engram cell concepts to reveal the dynamics of memory engrams. We also discuss the advantages and problems of live-cell imaging, which has recently been developed to visualize multineuronal activities. The last section suggests the experimental strategy and background assumptions for future research of memory engrams. The former encourages recording of cell assemblies from different brain regions during memory consolidation-reconsolidation processes, while the latter emphasizes the multipotentiality of neurons and regions that contribute to dynamics of memory engrams in the working brain."

Here we have analyzed the neuroprotective effect of topical bromfenac treatment, a nonsteroidal anti-inflammatory drug (NSAID) used in clinic to ameliorate post-operative inflammation, on axotomized rat RGCs. The left optic nerve of adult rats was subjected to optic nerve crush (ONC). Half of the rats were treated with a topical instillation of saline. On the other half, immediately after the surgery, 2 drops of bromfenac (0.09% Yellox; Bausch & Lomb) were instilled, and then every 12 h until analysis. Retinas in both groups were dissected 3, 5, 7, 9 and 14 days after ONC (n = 4-8/time point/group). Toxicity of bromfenac was assessed in intact retinas treated during 14 days (n = 6). Intact untreated retinas were used as control of the RGC population. RGCs were identified by Brn3a immunodetection and automatically quantified. Our results show that bromfenac does not cause RGC loss in intact retinas. In the injured groups, the number of RGCs at 7, 9 and 14 days after the lesion was significantly higher in treated vs. untreated retinas.

Hyperpolarization-activated cyclic nucleotide-gated (HCN, Ih) channels play a major role in pain via hyperexcitability and facilitation of ectopic firing in neurons. Neuronal hyperexcitability contributes to pain maintenance and anxiety/depression. GABA-mediated inhibitory postsynaptic neurotransmission in the brain is impaired in the pathophysiology of chronic neuropathic pain with comorbidity mood disorders. Currently, interaction of HCN channels and GABAergic synaptic transmission inhibition in neuropathic pain and the associated comorbidity anxiety/depression mechanism remains relatively unknown. To address this, the HCN channel inhibitor, ZD7288, was administrated to Wistar Kyoto (WKY) rats after spared nerve injury (SNI). Our findings show that intracerebroventricular injection of ZD7288 concurrently attenuates co-existing nociceptive and depression-like behaviors, and increases glutamicacid decarboxylase (GAD67/65) expression and GABA levels in the hippocampus and thalamus with High-performance liquid chromatography technique. It suggests that inhibition of HCN channels is likely to decrease the hyperexcitability of neurons in rat SNI and improve the level of GABA.

Fifty-four male and 54 female volunteers were recruited. Each subject was imaged using a passive markerless 3D motion capture system (DI4D). Eighteen landmarks were tracked through the 3D capture sequence. A facial asymmetry score was calculated based on either a clinically derived midline or Procrustes alignment; scores were based on the Euclidean distance between landmark pairs. Facial asymmetry scores were determined at three time points: rest, median, and maximum frame. Based on the clinically derived midline and on Procrustes alignment, the differences between male and female volunteers, as well as those at the three different time points, were not clinically significant. However, throughout a smile, facial and lip asymmetry scores increased over the duration of the smile. Fluctuating facial asymmetry exists within individuals, as well as between individuals. Procrustes superimposition and the clinically derived midline produced similar asymmetry scores and both are valid for symmetrical faces. However, with facial asymmetry, Procrustes superimposition may not be a valid measure, and the use of the clinically derived midline may be more appropriate, although this requires further investigation.",A survey of core replacements in indole-based HIV-1 attachment inhibitors.,https://www.ncbi.nlm.nih.gov/pubmed/30940396,Bioorganic & medicinal chemistry letters,2019 04 28,"Indole- and azaindole-based glyoxylyl amide derivatives have been described as HIV-1 attachment inhibitors (AIs) that act by blocking the interaction between the viral gp120 coat protein and the human host cell CD4 receptor. As part of an effort to more deeply understand the role of the indole/azaindole heterocycle in the expression of antiviral activity, a survey of potential replacements was conducted using parallel synthesis methodology. The design and optimization was guided by a simple 2-dimensional overlay based on an overall planar topography between the indole/azaindole and C-7 substituents that had been deduced from structure-activity studies leading to the discovery of temsavir (3). 2-Substituted naphthalene- and quinoline-derived chemotypes emerged as the most interesting prototypes, with C-5 and C-6 substituents enhancing antiviral potency. Despite the fact that neither of these chemotypes incorporated a H-bond donor that has been shown to engage the side chain carboxylate of Asp113 in gp120, the antiviral potency of several analogues met or exceeded that of 3, demonstrating that engaging Asp113 is not a prerequisite for potent antiviral activity.",Chondrolaryngoplasty-Thyroid Cartilage Reduction.,https://www.ncbi.nlm.nih.gov/pubmed/30940393,Facial plastic surgery clinics of North America,2019 04 03,"Chondrolaryngoplasty, also known as tracheal shave, is a surgical procedure performed for a prominent Adam's apple, usually in transfeminine patients with gender dysphoria to this marker of male sex.

Among 2145 patients in this study, 192 developed TA-TMA with a cumulative incidence of 7.6% by 100days post-transplant. Independent pretransplant risk factors included the receipt of a second (or third) allogeneic HCT, HLA-mismatched donor, and myeloablative conditioning with or without total body irradiation; post-transplant risk factors included the antecedent development of acute graft-versus-host disease, diffuse alveolar hemorrhage, bacteremia, invasive aspergillosis, BK viremia, and higher sirolimus trough level. Among TA-TMA patients 27% achieved hematologic resolution and 57% remained alive as of 90days after diagnosis. Antecedent risk factors stratified patients into different survival groups, and immunosuppressant withdrawal alone did not improve patient outcomes. In conclusion, TA-TMA is a heterogenous disease that occurs after allogeneic transplantation. Management with immunosuppressant withdrawal does not impact patient outcomes. Until further evidence becomes available, the management of TA-TMA should focus on the treatment of underlying diseases."

We examined how colipids, with negative intrinsic curvature and which may induce curvature stress in the bilayers, affected the segregation of palmitoyl ceramide (PCer). Such colipids include 1-palmitoyl-2-oleoyl-sn-glycero-3-phosphoethanolamine (POPE), 1,2-dioleoyl-sn-glycero-3-phosphoethanolamine (DOPE), and tetra-linoleoyl cardiolipin (CL). In 1,2-dioleoyl-sn-glycero-3-phosphocholine (DOPC) bilayers, PCer formed ordered, gel-like domains at concentrations above 10 mol% at 23°C, as evidenced by the change in the average lifetime of the trans-parinaric acid emission. When POPE or DOPE were included in the DOPC bilayer (at 20:80 or 40:60 POPE or DOPE to DOPC, by mol), the lateral segregation of PCer was facilitated in a concentration-dependent manner, and less PCer was required for the formation of the ordered ceramide-rich domains. Inclusion of CL in the DOPE bilayer (at 10:90 or 20:80 CL to PC, by mol) also caused a similar facilitation of the lateral segregation of PCer. The PCer-rich domains formed in the presence of POPE, DOPE, or CL in DOPC bilayers were slightly more thermostable (by 2-10°C) when compared to PCer-rich domains in DOPC-only bilayers. Nonlamellar phases were not present in bilayers in which the effects of POPE or DOPE on PCer segregation were the largest, as verified by 31P NMR. When palmitoyl sphingomyelin was added to the different bilayer compositions at 5 mol%, relative to the phospholipids, PCer segregated into gel domains at lower concentrations (2-3 mol% PCer), and the effect of POPE on PCer segregation was eliminated. We suggest that the effects of POPE, DOPE, and CL on PCer segregation was in part influenced by their effects on membrane curvature stress and in part because of unfavorable interactions with PCer due to their unsaturated acyl chains. These lipids are abundant in mitochondrial membranes and are likely to affect functional properties of saturated ceramides in them.",Surgical interventions for the treatment of sacrococcygeal pilonidal sinus disease in children: A systematic review and meta-analysis.,https://www.ncbi.nlm.nih.gov/pubmed/30940347,Journal of pediatric surgery,2019 04 03,Pilonidal sinus disease (PNS) is not uncommon in children.

Uncertainty surrounds the mechanisms behind the unusual pattern of daytime stem swelling, presented by species like the mangrove Avicennia marina (Forssk.) Vierh., and which is thought to originate in the osmotic adjustment of storage tissues. We performed on-xylem radius change (XRC) and whole-stem radius change (SRC) measurements with point dendrometers to ascertain if the swelling of the stem is due to an increase in the thickness of the phloem and inner-bark (BRC). We measured leaf water potential (ψleaf), sap flow, leaf turgor and microclimate to understand the coupling between BRC and transpiration-driven changes in XRC. Our results present direct evidence of the type of mechanism responsible for daytime stem swelling. Inner-bark thickness increase concurrent with XRC decrease, sap-flow increase and leaf turgor loss, reveals a phloem-generated turgor signal behind daytime stem swelling of tree stems. On-xylem measurements were highly heterogeneous due to the variability in the three dimensional fish-net wood structure of the stem of A. marina. As daytime decreases in XRC were compensated by BRC and correlated with conditions of high water demand, we suggest a potential role of daytime stem swelling in the hydraulic safety of A. marina.",Ameliorating effects of exogenous Ca2+ on foxtail millet seedlings under salt stress.,https://www.ncbi.nlm.nih.gov/pubmed/30940338,Functional plant biology : FPB,2019 04 03,"In the present study, we investigated whether Ca2+ application alleviates salinity-induced damage in foxtail millet (Setaria italica L.). We evaluated the stress-related ion balance, physiological activity and gene expression involved in plant defences against salinity exposure. Twenty-one-day-old foxtail millet was maintained in sand culture for 7 days and subjected to one of seven treatments: half-strength modified Hoagland solution (the control), 1.0% NaCl, 1.0% NaCl+2.5mM Ca2+, 1.0% NaCl+5.0mM Ca2+, 1.0% NaCl+7.5mM Ca2+, 1.0% NaCl+10.0mM Ca2+, 1.0% NaCl+12.5mM Ca2+. The addition of Ca2+ significantly increased shoot and root height and weight relative to calcium absent treatment and corrected the ion imbalance by increasing Ca2+, Mg2+ and K+, and decreasing Na+ in the leaves and roots. It increased chlorophyll content and root activity and decreased the relative electrolyte leakage in the roots and leaves. Calcium application significantly upregulated superoxide dismutase and catalase, increased total protein, and decreased malondialdehyde and H2O2. Finally, the addition of Ca2+ upregulated the expression of APX, SOD and CAT. It was found that 10.0mM Ca2+ was the optimal concentration for alleviating salt stress injury in foxtail millet.",In silico characterisation and functional validation of chilling tolerant divergence 1 (COLD1) gene in monocots during abiotic stress.,https://www.ncbi.nlm.nih.gov/pubmed/30940337,Functional plant biology : FPB,2019 04 03,"The G protein-coupled receptor is one of the major transmembrane proteins in plants. It consists of an α subunit, a β subunit and three γ subunits. Chilling tolerant divergence 1 (COLD1) includes a Golgi pH receptor (GPHR) domain, which maintains cell membrane organisation and dynamics, along with abscisic acid linked G protein-coupled receptor (ABA_GPCR) that regulates the signalling pathways during cold stress. In the present study, we performed characterisation of a homologous COLD1 from the economically important monocot species Oryza sativa L., Zea mays L., Sorghum bicolor (L.)Moench and Erianthus arundinaceus (L.) Beauv. IK 76-81, a wild relative of Saccharum. COLD1 was isolated from E. arundinaceus IK 76-81, analysed for its evolution, domain, membrane topology, followed by prediction of secondary, tertiary structures and functionally validated in all four different monocots. Gene expression studies of COLD1 revealed differential expression under heat, drought, salinity and cold stresses in selected monocots.

New genes conferring cold tolerance needs to be identified and characterised for sustainable crop production in low-temperature stress affected areas. Here we report functional characterisation of OsRBGD3, classified previously as a class D glycine-rich RNA recognition motif (RRM) containing proteins from a drought-tolerant Indica rice cultivar N22. The gene was isolated by screening yeast one-hybrid library using the minimal promoter region of the OsMYB38 that is necessary for cold stress-responsive expression. OsRBGD3 exhibited cold, drought and salt stress inductive expression in a drought tolerant N22 rice cultivar as compared with susceptible variety IR64. OsRBGD3 was found to be localised to both nuclear and cytoplasmic subcellular destinations. Constitutive overexpression of the OsRBGD3 in transgenic Arabidopsis conferred tolerance to cold stress. ABA sensitivity was also observed in transgenic lines suggesting the regulatory role of this gene in the ABA signalling pathway. OsRBGD3 overexpression also attributed to significant root development and early flowering in transgenics. Hence, OsRBGD3 could be an important target for developing cold tolerant early flowering rice and other crops' genotypes for increasing production in low temperature affected areas.",Confirmation of mesophyll signals controlling stomatal responses by a newly devised transplanting method.,https://www.ncbi.nlm.nih.gov/pubmed/30940335,Functional plant biology : FPB,2019 04 03,"There are opposing views on whether the responses of stomata to environmental stimuli are all autonomous reactions of stomatal guard cells or whether mesophyll is involved in these responses. Transplanting isolated epidermis onto mesophyll is a potent methodology for examining the roles of mesophyll-derived signals in stomatal responses. Here we report on development of a new transplanting method. Leaf segments of Commelina communis L. were pretreated in the light or dark at 10, 39 or 70Pa ambient CO2 for 1h. Then the abaxial epidermises were removed and the epidermal strips prepared from the other leaves kept in the dark at 39Pa CO2, were transplanted onto the mesophyll. After illumination of the transplants for 1h at 39Pa CO2, stomatal apertures were measured. We also examined the molecular sizes of the mesophyll signals by inserting the dialysis membrane permeable to molecules smaller than 100-500Da or 500-1000Da between the epidermis and mesophyll. Mesophyll pretreatments in the light at low CO2 partial pressures accelerated stomatal opening in the transplanted epidermal strips, whereas pretreatments at 70Pa CO2 suppressed stomatal opening. Insertion of these dialysis membranes did not suppress stomatal opening significantly at 10Pa CO2 in the light, whereas insertion of the 100-500Da membrane decelerated stomatal closure at high CO2. It is probable that the mesophyll signals inducing stomatal opening at low CO2 in the light would permeate both membranes, and that those inducing stomatal closure at high CO2 would not permeate the 100-500Da membrane. Possible signal compounds are discussed.",Acquired tolerance of the photosynthetic apparatus to photoinhibition as a result of growing Solanum lycopersicum at moderately higher temperature and light intensity.,https://www.ncbi.nlm.nih.gov/pubmed/30940333,Functional plant biology : FPB,2019 04 03,"The kinetics of photoinhibition in detached leaves from tomato plants (Solanium lycopersicum L. cv. M82) grown for 6 days under different combinations of optimal and moderately high temperature and optimal and high light intensity were studied. The inhibition of PSII was evaluated by changes in maximal quantum yield, the coefficient of photochemical quenching and the quantum yield of PSII. The changes of PSI activity was estimated by the redox state of P700. The involvement of different possible protective processes was checked by determination of nonphotochemical quenching and cyclic electron flow around PSI. To evaluate to what extent the photosynthetic apparatus and its response to high light treatment was affected by growth conditions, the kinetics of photoinhibition in isolated thylakoid membranes were also studied. The photochemical activities of both photosystems and changes in the energy distribution and interactions between them were evaluated by means of a Clark electrode and 77 K fluorescence analysis. The data showed an increased tolerance to photoinhibition in plants grown under a combination of moderately high temperature and light intensity, which was related to the stimulation of cyclic electron flow, PSI activity and rearrangements of pigment-protein complexes, leading to a decrease in the excitation energy delivered to PSII."

A secondary goal was to evaluate the performance of the algorithm (nosocomial infection index (Nii)) used.MethodsWe analysed the data of 77 hospital-wide PPS, performed over a 2-year period (2013 and 2014) and including 25,056 patients.ResultsSix trends with statistical significance were detected. The probability to detect such trends rapidly decreased when PPS are performed at a lower frequency. The Nii and its dynamics strongly correlated with the presence of HAI.ConclusionPerforming computer-assisted, high frequency hospital-wide PPS, is a feasible method that will detect even subtle changes in HAI prevalence over time.",MicroRNA-2861 targets STAT3 and MMP2 to regulate the proliferation and apoptosis of ectopic endometrial cells in endometriosis.,https://www.ncbi.nlm.nih.gov/pubmed/30940310,Die Pharmazie,2019 06 14,"This study aimed to elucidate the roles and regulatory mechanism of miR-2861 in the development of endometriosis. The expression of miR-2861 in endometriotic tissues and eutopic endometrial tissues was determined. Ectopic endometrial cells were transfected with miR-2861 mimic, miR-2861 inhibitor and their corresponding controls. The effects of miR-2861 overexpression and inhibition on cell proliferation and apoptosis were then investigated. In addition, regulatory relationship between miR-2681 and signal transducer and activator of transcription 3 (STAT3) or matrix metalloproteinase 2 (MMP2) was explored, as well as between STAT3 and MMP2. Compared with eutopic endometrial tissues, miR-2861 was significantly downregulated in endometriotic tissues. Overexpression of miR-2861 markedly inhibited ectopic endometrial cell proliferation and induced apoptosis. Additionally, STAT3 and MMP2 were confirmed as the targets of miR-2861, and the effects of knockdown of STAT3 or MMP2on regulating cell proliferation and apoptosis were opposite with inhibition of miR-2861. Besides, STAT3 could enhance the expression of MMP2 in ectopic endometrial cells. Our study reveals that miR-2861 was lowly expressed in endometriotic tissues, and downregulation of miR-2861 may promote proliferation and inhibit apoptosis of ectopic endometrial cells in endometriosis via upregulation of STAT3 and MMP2. miR-2861 may be a potential biomarker or therapeutic target for endometriosis.",The dipeptidyl peptidase-4 inhibitor sitagliptin ameliorates renal injury in type 1 diabetic mice via inhibiting the TGF-β/Smad signal pathway.,https://www.ncbi.nlm.nih.gov/pubmed/30940309,Die Pharmazie,2019 06 14,"Diabetic nephropathy (DN) is a common cause of end-stage kidney disease (ESKD) all over the world. Sitagliptin, an inhibitor of DPP-IV plays a beneficial role in type 2 diabetic nephropathy. The purpose of this study was to explore the effect and mechanism of sitagliptin on renal injury in type 1 diabetic mice. Streptozotocin (STZ) induced type 1 diabetic mice were treated with oral administration of sitagliptin (15 mg/kg/ day) for 4 weeks. The results showed that sitagliptin treatment did not change the levels of blood glucose in STZ induced type 1 diabetic mice. Sitagliptin attenuates diabetic nephropathy by significantly inhibiting 24 h proteinuria, renal injury and fibrosis. Sitagliptin can inhibit the expression level of TGF-β1 and the other related fibrosis factors in renal tissue of type 1 diabetic mice while delaying the progression of type 1 diabetic nephropathy. These results indicated that sitagliptin treatment is potentially a new strategy for treating type 1 diabetic nephropathy.",MiR-758-3p regulates papillary thyroid cancer cell proliferation and migration by targeting TAB1.,https://www.ncbi.nlm.nih.gov/pubmed/30940308,Die Pharmazie,2019 06 14,"Previous studied revealed that miR-758-3p was abnormally expressed in cancer patients. However, its role and underlying mechanism in papillary thyroid cancer (PTC) remains unclear. Expression of miR-758-3p in PTC cell lines was analyzed using quantitative real-time PCR. It was observed that miR-758-3p expression was significantly downregulated in PTC cell lines. Overexpression of miR-758-3p inhibited PTC cell proliferation, invasion but promoted cell apoptosis in vitro. Further study demonstrated that TGF-β activated kinase 1 binding protein 1 (TAB1) was a direct target of miR-758-3p and TAB1 expression was suppressed by miR-758-3p overexpression. Moreover, TAB1 was shown to be a mediator for the roles of miR-758-3p in PTC. Therefore, our study established a tumor-suppressive role for miR-758-3p in the inhibition of PTC progression, which may be employed as a novel prognostic marker and as an effective therapeutic target for PTC.",Neuregulin-1 protects cardiac electrical conduction through downregulating matrix metalloproteinase-9 and upregulating connexin 43 in a rat myocardial infarction model.,https://www.ncbi.nlm.nih.gov/pubmed/30940307,Die Pharmazie,2019 06 14,"Aims: Neuregulin-1 (NRG-1) is a member of the epidermal growth factor family, and has an important role in cardiomyocyte development and myocardial regeneration. The aim of this study was to determine the protective effect of NRG-1 on cardiac electrical conduction in a rat myocardial infarction (MI) model. Methods: Thirty-three adult male SPF SD rats were randomized into three groups: sham-operated (n=9), acute myocardial infarction (AMI, n=12), and the NRG-1-treated (NRG-1, n=12) groups. All rats were sacrificed on day 8 after inducing MI. The 6-lead electrocardiograms (ECG) were recorded pre-operatively and eight days after operation, and analyzed. The expression levels of matrix metalloproteinase (MMP)-9 and gap junction protein connexin 43 (Cx43) in the infarcted myocardium were measured by Western blotting, and its in-situ distribution was evaluated using immunohistochemistry. Results: The PR, QRS and QT intervals were significantly prolonged in the AMI group compared to the sham operated animals (P<0.05, P<0.01 and P<0.01 respectively), and the PR and QRS intervals were partially restored in the NRG-1-treated rats (P<0.01 and P<0.01 compared to AMI group). Similarly, the increased levels of MMP-9 in the AMI group was restored upon NRG-1 treatment. The myocardial expression of Cx43 was decreased significantly in the AMI group, and was upregulated by NRG-1 treatment. Conclusions: NRG-1 attenuates MI-induced dysfunctional cardiac electrical conduction by downregulating MMP-9 and upregulating Cx43.",Disintegration time of orally dissolving films: various methodologies and in-vitro/in-vivo correlation.,https://www.ncbi.nlm.nih.gov/pubmed/30940306,Die Pharmazie,2019 06 14,"Orodispersible films (ODF) have gained a remarkable success in the market, especially in pediatric and geriatric populations. The time required for an ODF to disintegrate is an essential quality and safety feature, thus an appropriate methodology is crucial. The USP disintegration apparatus is not appropriate for ODFs, as the determination of the end point is challenging and may not predict in-vivo disintegration time. The aim of the present study was to design and evaluate new disintegration protocols as an attempt to select the best approach that would reflect the in-vivo disintegration time in comparison to formerly reported procedures. Novel methods were designed, namely; the frame, the cell, and the agar plate methods, and compared to the previously reported methods; clamp and modified USP disintegration methods. Different ODFs were formulated using various viscosity grades of hydroxypropylmethyl cellulose. The mechanical characteristics of the prepared films were studied using texture analyzer and film folding endurance test. The resultant disintegration time of the films measured by the aforementioned methods were compared and correlated with its in-vivo time. Interestingly, the results obtained through the use of the cell method for the low viscosity polymers did not vary significantly from that of their in-vivo results (p>0.05). Moreover, the disintegration time of all polymeric films determined by the cell method revealed independently on their viscosity the highest correlation with in-vivo disintegration time (R² = 0.999). Such findings indicated the suitability of the cell method in predicting in-vivo disintegration time of low viscosity polymeric films.",Development and chemical characterization of biodegradable polymeric implants containing sirolimus for the treatment of malignant solid tumors.,https://www.ncbi.nlm.nih.gov/pubmed/30940305,Die Pharmazie,2019 06 14,"The use of sirolimus and its analogs has been evaluated in studies aimed at combating several types of cancer; however, because of the limited bioavailability of the drug, the search for new forms of administration is required. Biodegradable polymeric implants containing sirolimus were developed and assessed as an alternative method of drug administration. Implants containing 25 % (w/w) sirolimus were prepared employing the polymer matrices chitosan, polycaprolactone and poly(lactic-co-glycolic acid) (PLGA) in two proportions: PLGA 50:50 and PLGA 75:25. Thermal analysis techniques such as thermogravimetry and differential scanning calorimetry, combined with x-ray diffraction were used to characterize and evaluate the compatibility of the constituents of the formulation. No incompatibilities were found between the components, but drug amorphization was observed in all samples. Implants made from the polymers chitosan and PCL may accelerate the degradation of SRL when these polymers are dissolved in methanol at 50 °C. HPLC analysis showed that the implant prepared with PLGA 75:25 did not present degradation products and maintained its appropriate drug content, even when dissolved in methanol and heated to 50 °C. Therefore, it represents the most suitable biodegradable polymer for use in implants developed for the treatment of malignant solid tumors. However, it is still necessary to further study the drug effects after amorphization of the crystal and also to perform stability and solubility analysis.",Intra-articular leflunomide-loaded poly(ε-caprolactone) implants to treat synovitis in rheumatoid arthritis.,https://www.ncbi.nlm.nih.gov/pubmed/30940304,Die Pharmazie,2019 06 14,"Rheumatoid arthritis is an autoimmune pathology that manifests as chronic inflammatory arthropathy and synovitis. Treatment of rheumatoid arthritis is based on the administration of different types of drugs, including leflunomide, an antirheumatic drug. However, the long-term systemic use of leflunomide may be associated with adverse effects. Local therapy could be an efficient strategy to treat synovitis triggered by rheumatoid arthritis without inducing adverse effects. In this study, leflunomide-loaded poly(ε-caprolactone) implants (leflunomide PCL implants) were evaluated as local drug delivery systems capable of attenuating inflammation and angiogenesis, which represent events of synovitis. Leflunomide PCL implants were designed by hot molding technique; and they were characterized by FTIR and DSC. These analytical techniques demonstrated the chemical integrity and dispersion of drug into the polymeric chains. Then, a spectrophometric method was developed and validated to quantify the leflunomide incorporated into the PCL implants and released from them. Linearity was obtained by ordinary least squares regression method to estimate the linear regression equation. Residues were evaluated considering normality, independence and homoscedasticity. Precision was lower than 5 %, and accuracy ranged from 98 to 104.5 %. Quantitation limit was 2.0 μg mL-1. PCL implants provided controlled and sustained release of leflunomide for 30 consecutive days after inserting these systems in the subcutaneous tissue of mice. The main mechanisms of drug delivery were solubilization and diffusion from polymer. Then, a non-biocompatible sponge was inserted into the subcutaneous tissue of mice to function as a frame to develop the inflammatory and angiogenic processes. Leflunomide PCL implants were inserted in direct contact with the sponge. At 4, 7 and 10 days after-sponge implantation, the key components of inflammatory angiogenesis were measured to verify the regression of these events induced by drug. Leflunomide controlled released from polymeric implants downregulated the neutrophil and monocyte/macrophage infiltration due to the reduced expression of myeloperoxidase (MPO) and N-acetyl-β-d-glucosaminidase (NAG), respectively. As the influx of these pro-inflammatory cells was modulated by leflunomide, the production of nitric oxide (NO), a pro-inflammatory substance, reached low concentrations in the sponge. As a consequence of the modulation of inflammation at the pathological site, the angiogenic process was downregulated, since the hemoglobin levels in the sponge were drastically reduced. The accumulation of leflunomide in the pathological site did not induce nephrotoxicity or hepatototoxicity, as confirmed by histological analyses. Finally, intra-articular leflunomide PCL implants represent a potential therapeutic alternative to treat locally the synovitis triggered by rheumatoid arthritis without inducing systemic adverse effects.",Effect of desflurane-remifentanil or sevoflurane-remifentanil on early recovery in elderly patients: a meta-analysis of randomized controlled trials.,https://www.ncbi.nlm.nih.gov/pubmed/30940302,Die Pharmazie,2019 06 14,"Objective: We conducted a meta-analysis to evaluate different indexes of the postoperative resuscitation period in elderly patients who received desflurane-remifentanil or sevoflurane-remifentanil.

CVD includes varicose veins with a prevalence of approx. 25 %, overlapping with Chronic Venous Insufficiency (CVI) with a prevalence of approx. 17% in the adult population. CVI is characterized by venous pathology and objective signs like edema, skin changes or venous leg ulcers. Objective: To review and evaluate non-clinical and clinical data on a standardised herbal product containing flavonoids (AS195; Antistax®) and to put them into a perspective with the pathophysiology of CVD. Methods: Literature available on non-clinical pharmacology and clinical studies with AS195 in CVI of the lower extremities was reviewed and described. Conclusion: Antistax® is a well-described herbal product with standardised starting materials and manufacturing process. Its active ingredients accumulate in the venous intima, preserve the endothelial barrier function, and inhibit the inflammatory and prothrombotic cascade behind the progression of CVD. Its efficacy was analysed in adequately planned and executed clinical trials in patients with mild to moderately severe CVD (CEAP C1s to C4). AS195 showed a statistically significant and clinically relevant efficacy over placebo: in objective endpoints like volumetry of lower leg edema, but also in outcomes directly relevant for patients like tension and heaviness of the legs, tingling, and pain. Supportive studies confirmed and validated these results also for the broader population treated in daily practice. AS195 was well tolerated in studies and in everyday therapy. There are no known interactions with other medications. In the later stages, it can be used in combination with compression, complementing the beneficial haemodynamic effects of compression at a cellular level. AS195 is an addition to compression and closes a therapeutic gap especially in patients, who cannot use compression stockings, but still require CVD therapy."

Several TMEM proteins, such as TMEM 45A, TMEM 97, and TMEM 140, are implicated in human brain gliomas. However, the roles of TMEM168 in human GBM remained extremely poor. Herein, we found that mRNA levels of TMEM168 were overexpressed in GBM patients (n = 85) when compared with healthy people (n = 10), which was also supported by data from The Cancer Genome Atlas (TCGA). KaplanMeier analysis of Gene Expression Omnibus dataset GSE16011 suggested that enhanced TMEM168 expression was associated with shorter survival time. To investigate whether and how TMEM168 functioned in the tumorigenesis of human GBM cells, two human GBM cell lines (U87 and U 373) were used for study. Lithium chloride (LiCl), an activator for Wnt/β-catenin pathway, was used for the treatment. Our data suggested that siRNA-TMEM168 (siTMEM168) prevented viability of U87 and U 373 cells, induced cell cycle arrest (G0-G1 phase) and promoted apoptosis, and the mechanisms involved in blocking Wnt/β-catenin pathway, as evidenced by reducing expression of β-catenin, Cmyc, Cyclin D1 and Survivin. Furthermore, the inhibited effect of siTMEM168 on human GBM cell growth was significantly alleviated with additional LiCl treatment, substantiating the involvement of Wnt/β-catenin pathway in this process. In summary, our data demonstrated that TMEM168 may represent a therapeutic target for the treatment of human GBM.",Anticancer effects of Gleditsia sinensis extract in rats transplanted with hepatocellular carcinoma cells.,https://www.ncbi.nlm.nih.gov/pubmed/30940289,Oncology research,2019 04 03,"The thorns of Gleditsia sinensis have been historically used in Chinese medicine, and considered one of the fundamental therapeutic herbs.

By using a rat HCC model implanted with cancerous Walker-256 cells, the therapeutic effects of Gleditsia sinensis extract (GSE) were assessed, as well as its regulatory effects on miRNAs. GSE significantly restored liver morphology and dramatically induced cell apoptosis in HCC rats. In addition, miR-21/181b/183 was upregulated in the HCC liver, and the elevation of these miRNAs could be alleviated by both GSE and sorafenib. PTEN/TIMP3/PDCD4 down-regulation was consistent with the targets of miR36 21/181b/183 in the HCC liver, and the alteration of these target genes was restored by both GSE and sorafenib. TIMP3 effects on MMP-2/9 expression were also determined. Our present findings indicate the potential of GSE in HCC treatment, and expand the understanding of miRNA-related mechanisms in the anticancer effects of GSE.","Advances in LC-MS/MS Methods for Allergen Testing, Meat Speciation, and Gelatin Speciation.",https://www.ncbi.nlm.nih.gov/pubmed/30940288,Journal of AOAC International,2019 04 03,"Background: Food authenticity is demanded by the consumer at all times. The consumer places trust in the manufacturer that the food product is genuine in terms of what is recorded on the packaging label. Objective: Recent advancements in LC-tandem MS methodology in the detection of allergens, meat, and gelatin speciation in raw food products and processed foods are detailed in this paper. Method: For each of the three methods, initial proteome analysis and the screening leading to the determination of unique tryptic peptides were conducted using a high-resolution, accurate tandem mass spectrometer. Having identified the unique markers, the method was transferred to a tandem quadrupole mass spectrometer for a higher-sensitivity quantitative study, multiple reaction monitoring transition analysis. Results: For the allergens method a detection limit of at least 10 ppm was attained across the 12 allergen peptides in this workflow. In the gluten workflow the resulting chromatograms show good detection down to 5 ppm, with no interference from the food matrices. The meat speciation method details that signature peptides could be readily identified at 1% w/w with no matrix interference. Conclusions: These single-injection workflows with cycle-time optimization enable wide coverage of analytes to identify multiple species within challenging matrix samples.",Simultaneous Detection of 13 Allergens in Thermally Processed Food Using Targeted LC-MS/MS Approach.,https://www.ncbi.nlm.nih.gov/pubmed/30940287,Journal of AOAC International,2019 04 03,"Food allergy is a major concern for public health and food industries. Because of the large numbers of food ingredients to be tested, MS is considered an alternative to existing techniques in terms of high selectivity, sensitivity, and capability to analyze multiple allergens simultaneously. In this study, we developed the method for monitoring significant peptides derived from 13 food allergens (milk, eggs, cod, shrimp, lobster, almonds, brazil nuts, cashew nuts, hazelnuts, walnuts, peanuts, wheat, and soybeans) and evaluated it in thermally processed foods (bread, cookie, fried fish, and frozen pasta). To select significant peptides to monitor, we used a bioinformatics-based approach and experimental confirmatory analysis. It was demonstrated that the developed method could detect target food ingredients from thermally processed foods successfully.",Quantitation of Mycotoxins in Four Food Matrices Comparing Stable Isotope Dilution Assay (SIDA) with Matrix-Matched Calibration Methods by LC-MS/MS.,https://www.ncbi.nlm.nih.gov/pubmed/30940286,Journal of AOAC International,2019 04 03,"Background: Mycotoxins are big concerns in food safety. Analytical methods are important for the evaluation of mycotoxins in different food commodities. Objective: In this study, stable isotope dilution assay (SIDA) was compared with a matrix-matched calibration method for the quantification of mycotoxins in four different commercially available commodities and two reference materials. Methods: All samples were extracted with water-acetonitrile (50+50, v/v), followed by filtration and LC-tandem MS analysis. Results: SIDA calibration accuracies ranged from 78.6 to 112% with relative SDs (RSDs) ≤16% across all four matrices. The majority of the recoveries across all matrices ranged from 70 to 120% with RSDs <11%. Of the four mycotoxins in the reference materials analyzed, only three had 13C-internal standard (IS), whereas the fourth was quantified using a closely eluting 13C-IS for a different mycotoxin. Mycotoxins paired with their corresponding 13C-IS had accuracies >90%, whereas accuracies for the mismatched mycotoxin/13C-IS were <14%. Conclusions: When 13C-IS are not available, matrix-matched calibration was also evaluated as an alternative to quantitating target mycotoxins. The use of 13C-IS is the best way to dynamically account for prevalent matrix effects, but matrix matching provides a viable alternative. Highlights: The study compared SIDA and matrix-matched calibration methods in terms of recovery, efficiency, advantages, and limitations for LC-MS based mycotoxin analysis.",Development and In-House Validation of an LC-MS and LC-MS/MS Assay for the Determination of Food Fraud for Different Fish Species.,https://www.ncbi.nlm.nih.gov/pubmed/30940285,Journal of AOAC International,2019 04 03,"Background: Fish and fish products are one of the most important food sources of high commercial interest. The global food trade and the associated risks are constantly presenting new challenges to consumer protection and public authorities, which, among other things, demand state-of-the-art analytical methods to ensure food authenticity. Objective: The establishment of MS-based strategies plays a decisive role alongside the (further) development of ELISA- or DNA-oriented methods. Methods: In the present work, therefore, the development and in-house validation of an LC-MS and LC-MS/MS-based assay for authenticity testing of certain fish species is described. Results: Based on the execution of a validated bottom-up LC-electrospray-MS and MS/MS assay and multivariate analysis, the commercially available species Lutjanus malabaricus (red snapper) and Sebastes spp. (redfish) are distinguished from each other, whereas an additional 68 samples [nine additional marine species such as pangasius (Pangasianodon hypophthalmus), salmon (Salmo salar), turbot (Scophthalmus maximus), plaice (Pleuronectes platessa), sole (Solea solea), lemon sole (Glyptocephalus cynoglossus), halibut (Reinhardtius hypoglossoides), red salmon (Oncorhynchus nerka), and great scallop (Pecten jacobaeus)] served as blinded negative controls to ensure the specificity of the assay. Conclusions and Highlights: A promising LC-MS and LC-MSMS based assay has been developed that could enable the detection of fish fraud at the protein level in the future.",Mass Spectrometry-Based Untargeted Proteomics for the Assessment of Food Authenticity: The Case of Farmed Versus Wild-Type Salmon.,https://www.ncbi.nlm.nih.gov/pubmed/30940284,Journal of AOAC International,2019 04 03,"Background: Omics technologies have been widely applied in different fields, among which, proteomics is gaining increasing interest for its application to the authenticity of food products. MS, typically coupled with LC, represents a key technique for proteomics-related studies dedicated to fish and other seafood products by using a bottom-up approach. Objective and Methods: In this paper, the optimization of an untargeted proteomics-based method using LC separation and MS detection relying on a quadrupole time-of-flight mass spectrometer is described and applied to the analysis of Canadian farmed and wild-type salmon, followed by statistical analysis based on principal component (PC) analysis. Results and Conclusions: This untargeted approach, using a data-independent acquisition MS scheme, demonstrated the ability to effectively discriminate salmon belonging to the two classes. Furthermore, selected peptides showing high loadings on PC1 could represent potential candidate peptide markers able to discriminate farmed from wild-type salmon samples in the future.",Guidelines for Validation of Qualitative Real-Time PCR Methods for Molecular Diagnostic Identification of Probiotics.,https://www.ncbi.nlm.nih.gov/pubmed/30940283,Journal of AOAC International,2019 04 03,"Backgroud: Probiotics have been shown to benefit human health through several mechanisms, including their role in improving the health of our gastrointestinal tracts. The health benefits of probiotics are strain specific, and therefore it is critical to include the correct strains in probiotic products when claiming specific health benefits. Several studies have reported issues concerning the accuracy of labeling of commercial probiotic products, including inaccurate taxonomy, missing species, or undeclared species. Consequently, there is a growing need to develop and validate assays to reliably verify strain identity in commercial probiotic products. PCR-based methods are the most commonly used methods for food species ingredient diagnostics because they are simple, fast, sensitive, and can be validated. Objective: The aim of this paper is to set the guidelines for validating targeted qualitative real-time PCR assays to verify the presence of specific strains in a probiotic supplement. Methods and Results: Qualitative real-time PCR assays are validated to evaluate the assay performance in terms of specificity, sensitivity, repeatability, and reproducibility in detecting target strains. Conclusions and Highlights: Setting these guidelines will facilitate and streamline the validation process for qualitative real-time PCR-based assays for probiotic identity authentication in support of quality assurance systems.",Detection and Quantification of Allergens in Foods and Minimum Eliciting Doses in Food-Allergic Individuals (ThRAll).,https://www.ncbi.nlm.nih.gov/pubmed/30940282,Journal of AOAC International,2019 04 03,"Risk-based approaches to managing allergens in foods are being developed by the food industry and regulatory authorities to support food-allergic consumers to avoid ingestion of their problem food, especially in relation to the traces of unintended allergens. The application of such approaches requires access to good quality data from clinical studies to support identification of levels of allergens in foods that are generally safe for most food-allergic consumers as well as analytical tools that are able to quantify allergenic food protein. The ThRAll project aims to support the application of risk-based approaches to food-allergen management in two ways. First, a harmonized quantitative MS-based prototype reference method will be developed for the detection of multiple food allergens in standardized incurred food matrices. This will be undertaken for cow's milk, hen's egg, peanut, soybean, hazelnut, and almond incurred into two highly processed food matrices, chocolate and broth powder. This activity is complemented by a second objective to support the development and curation of data on oral food challenges, which are used to define thresholds and minimum eliciting doses. This will be achieved through the development of common protocols for collection and curation of data that will be applied to allergenic foods for which there are currently data gaps.","Random isn't real: How the patchy distribution of ecological rewards may generate ""incentive hope"".",https://www.ncbi.nlm.nih.gov/pubmed/30940281,The Behavioral and brain sciences,2019 04 08,"Anselme &amp; Güntürkün generate exciting new insights by integrating two disparate fields to explain why uncertain rewards produce strong motivational effects.

The experiment was conducted to investigate the effects of dietary Na+ and Cl- level on growth performance, excreta moisture, blood biochemical parameters, intestinal Na+-glucose transporter 1 (SGLT1) messenger RNA (mRNA), and Na+-H+ exchanger 2 (NHE2) mRNA, and to estimate the optimal dietary sodium and chlorine level for yellow-feathered chickens from 22 to 42days. A total of 900 22-day-old Lingnan yellow-feathered male chickens were randomly allotted to five treatments, each of which included six replicates of 30 chickens per floor pen. The basal control diet was based on corn and soybean meal (without added NaCl and NaHCO3). Treatments 2 to 5 consisted of the basal diet supplemented with equal weights of Na+ and Cl-, constituting 0.1%, 0.2%, 0.3% and 0.4% of the diets.

The purpose of this study was to evaluate the effect of a dietary supplement containing mainly plant extracts on PAF actions and metabolism in healthy volunteers. A double-blind, placebo-controlled, 8 weeks' duration study was performed. Healthy volunteers were randomly allocated into the supplement or the placebo group and fifty-eight of them completed the study. The supplement contained plant extracts (Aloe gel, grape juice, Polygonum cuspidatum) and vitamins. The activities of PAF metabolic enzymes: the two isoforms of acetyl-CoA:lyso-PAF acetyltransferase, cytidine 5'-diphospho-choline:1-alkyl-2-acetyl-sn-glycerol cholinephosphotransferase (PAF-cholinephosphotransferase) and platelet-activating factor-acetylhydrolase (PAF-AH) in leucocytes and lipoprotein associated phospholipase-A2 in plasma were measured along with several markers of endothelial function. Platelet aggregation against PAF, ADP and thrombin receptor activating peptide was measured in human platelet-rich plasma by light transmission aggregometry. No difference was observed on soluble vascular cell adhesion molecule-1, sP-selectin and IL-6 levels at the beginning or during the study period between the two groups. Concerning PAF metabolism enzymes' activity, no difference was observed at baseline between the groups. PAF-AH activity was only increased in the supplement group at 4 and 8 weeks compared with baseline levels. In addition, supplement consumption led to lower platelet sensitivity against PAF and ADP compared with baseline levels. However, a trial effect was only observed when platelets were stimulated by PAF. In conclusion, supplementation with plant extracts and vitamins ameliorates platelet aggregation primarily against PAF and secondarily against ADP and affects PAF catabolism by enhancing PAF-acetylhydrolase activity in healthy subjects.",Coherence and reliability of a wearable inertial measurement unit for measuring postural sway.,https://www.ncbi.nlm.nih.gov/pubmed/30940216,BMC research notes,2019 04 16,"The aim of this study was to test the coherence of a wearable device, an inertial measurement unit (IMU) against the gold standard; also, to test the intra-trial reliability.

With regard to an exact model of the whole arterial system, a high-dimensional model is computationally impracticable since the complex geometry, viscosity or elastic properties and complex vectorial output need to be provided. For low-dimensional models, the structure, centerline and viscosity or elastic properties only need to be provided. Therefore, low-dimensional modeling with lower computational costs might be a more applicable approach to represent hemodynamic properties of the entire arterial system and these three types of low-dimensional models have been extensively used in the study of cardiovascular dynamics. In recent decades, application of physics-based models to estimate central aortic pressure has attracted increasing interest. However, to our best knowledge, there has been few review paper about reconstruction of central aortic pressure using these physics-based models. In this paper, three types of low-dimensional physical models (0D, 1D and tube-load models) of systemic arteries are reviewed, the application of three types of models on estimation of central aortic pressure is taken as an example to discuss their advantages and disadvantages, and the proper choice of models for specific researches and applications are advised.",Genetic overlap of chronic obstructive pulmonary disease and cardiovascular disease-related traits: a large-scale genome-wide cross-trait analysis.,https://www.ncbi.nlm.nih.gov/pubmed/30940143,Respiratory research,2019 05 08,"A growing number of studies clearly demonstrate a substantial association between chronic obstructive pulmonary disease (COPD) and cardiovascular diseases (CVD), although little is known about the shared genetics that contribute to this association.","Effects of anthropogenic landscape changes on the abundance and acrodendrophily of Anopheles (Kerteszia) cruzii, the main vector of malaria parasites in the Atlantic Forest in Brazil.",https://www.ncbi.nlm.nih.gov/pubmed/30940142,Malaria journal,2019 04 29,"The mosquito Anopheles (Kerteszia) cruzii is the main vector of human and simian malaria in the Atlantic Forest.

In this study, it was hypothesized that factors associated with anthropogenic landscape changes may be responsible for the variation in abundance and acrodendrophily observed in An. cruzii."

Biological sciences,2019 05 16,"Cooperation is key to the survival of all biological systems. The spatial structure of a system constrains who interacts with whom (interaction partner) and who acquires new traits from whom (role model). Understanding when and to what degree a spatial structure affects the evolution of cooperation is an important and challenging topic. Here, we provide an analytical formula to predict when natural selection favours cooperation where the effects of a spatial structure are described by a single parameter. We find that a spatial structure promotes cooperation (spatial reciprocity) when interaction partners overlap role models. When they do not, spatial structure inhibits cooperation even without cooperation dilemmas. Furthermore, a spatial structure in which individuals interact with their role models more often shows stronger reciprocity. Thus, imitating individuals with frequent interactions facilitates cooperation. Our findings are applicable to both pairwise and group interactions and show that strong social ties might hinder, while asymmetric spatial structures for interaction and trait dispersal could promote cooperation.","Genomics overrules mitochondrial DNA, siding with morphology on a controversial case of species delimitation.",https://www.ncbi.nlm.nih.gov/pubmed/30940064,Proceedings. Biological sciences,2019 05 16,"Species delimitation is a major quest in biology and is essential for adequate management of the organismal diversity. A challenging example comprises the fish species of red snappers in the Western Atlantic. Red snappers have been traditionally recognized as two separate species based on morphology: Lutjanus campechanus (northern red snapper) and L. purpureus (southern red snapper). Recent genetic studies using mitochondrial markers, however, failed to delineate these nominal species, leading to the current lumping of the northern and southern populations into a single species ( L. campechanus). This decision carries broad implications for conservation and management as red snappers have been commercially over-exploited across the Western Atlantic and are currently listed as vulnerable. To address this conflict, we examine genome-wide data collected throughout the range of the two species. Population genomics, phylogenetic and coalescent analyses favour the existence of two independent evolutionary lineages, a result that confirms the morphology-based delimitation scenario in agreement with conventional taxonomy. Despite finding evidence of introgression in geographically neighbouring populations in northern South America, our genomic analyses strongly support isolation and differentiation of these species, suggesting that the northern and southern red snappers should be treated as distinct taxonomic entities.",Slower senescence in a wild insect population in years with a more female-biased sex ratio.,https://www.ncbi.nlm.nih.gov/pubmed/30940063,Proceedings. Biological sciences,2019 05 16,"Life-history theories of senescence are based on the existence of a trade-off in resource allocation between body maintenance and reproduction. This putative trade-off means that environmental and demographic factors affecting the costs of reproduction should be associated with changes in patterns of senescence. In many species, competition among males is a major component of male reproductive investment, and hence variation in the sex ratio is expected to affect rates of senescence. We test this prediction using nine years of demographic and behavioural data from a wild population of the annual field cricket Gryllus campestris. Over these generations, the sex ratio at adulthood varied substantially, from years with an equal number of each sex to years with twice as many females as males. Consistent with the predictions of theory, we found that in years with a greater proportion of females, both sexes experienced a slower increase in mortality rate with age. Additionally, phenotypic senescence in males was slower in years when there were more females. Sex ratio did not affect the baseline mortality rate in males, but females suffered higher age-independent mortality rates when males were in short supply.",Stochastic processes drive rapid genomic divergence during experimental range expansions.,https://www.ncbi.nlm.nih.gov/pubmed/30940062,Proceedings. Biological sciences,2019 05 16,"Range expansions are crucibles for rapid evolution, acting via both selective and neutral mechanisms. While selection on traits such as dispersal and fecundity may increase expansion speed, neutral mechanisms arising from repeated bottlenecks and genetic drift in edge populations (i.e. gene surfing) could slow spread or make it less predictable. Thus, it is necessary to disentangle the effects of selection from neutral mechanisms to robustly predict expansion dynamics. This is difficult to do with expansions in nature, as replicated expansions are required to distinguish selective and neutral processes in the genome. Using replicated microcosms of the red flour beetle ( Tribolium castaneum), we identify a robust signature of stochastic, neutral mechanisms in genomic changes arising over only eight generations of expansion and assess the role of standing variation and de novo mutations in driving these changes. Average genetic diversity was reduced within edge populations, but with substantial among-replicate variability in the changes at specific genomic windows. Such variability in genomic changes is consistent with a large role for stochastic, neutral processes. This increased genomic divergence among populations was mirrored by heightened variation in population size and expansion speed, suggesting that stochastic variation in the genome could increase unpredictability of range expansions.",Processing bias: extending sensory drive to include efficacy and efficiency in information processing.,https://www.ncbi.nlm.nih.gov/pubmed/30940061,Proceedings.

In parallel, the field of empirical aesthetics aims to understand why people like some designs more than others. The model of processing bias discussed here is rooted in empirical aesthetics, which posits that preferences are influenced by the emotional system as it monitors the dynamics of information processing and that attractive signals have effective designs that maximize information transmission, efficient designs that allow information processing at low metabolic cost, or both. We refer to the causal link between preference and the emotionally rewarding experience of effective and efficient information processing as the processing bias, and we apply it to the evolutionary model of sensory drive. A sensory drive model that incorporates processing bias hypothesizes a causal chain of relationships between the environment, perception, pleasure, preference and ultimately the evolution of signal design, both simple and complex.",Winners have higher pre-copulatory mating success but losers have better post-copulatory outcomes.,https://www.ncbi.nlm.nih.gov/pubmed/30940060,Proceedings. Biological sciences,2019 05 16,"In many animals, the outcomes of competitive interactions can have lasting effects that influence an individual's reproductive success and have important consequences for the strength and direction of evolution via sexual selection. In the fruit fly, Drosophila melanogaster, males that have won previous contests are more likely to win in subsequent conflicts and losers are more likely to lose (winner-loser effects), but the direct fitness consequences and genetic underpinnings of this plasticity are poorly understood. Here, we tested how male genotype and the outcomes of previous male-male conflicts influence male pre- and post-copulatory success. We quantified pre-copulatory success in a choice and no-choice context, and post-copulatory success by quantifying ejaculate offensive and defensive ability. We found that winners have higher reproductive success compared to losers in both pre-copulatory scenarios. However, losers consistently mated for a longer duration, boosted female fecundity and had an increased paternity share when they were the first males to mate, suggesting increased investment into post-copulatory mechanisms. Finally, by using clonal hybrids from the Drosophila Genetic Reference Panel, we documented that genetic variation explained a sizeable proportion of the observed differences between lines, and of the interaction between line and winner and loser effects. Our results place the behavioural data on winner-loser effects in an evolutionary context by documenting the potential fitness gain to males from altering their reproductive strategy based on fighting experience. Our data may also explain the presence and maintenance of trade-offs between different male reproductive strategies.",The population density of an urban raptor is inextricably tied to human cultural practices.,https://www.ncbi.nlm.nih.gov/pubmed/30940059,Proceedings. Biological sciences,2019 05 16,"Human socio-cultural factors are recognized as fundamental drivers of urban ecological processes, but their effect on wildlife is still poorly known. In particular, human cultural aspects may differ substantially between the extensively studied urban settings of temperate regions and the poorly studied cities of the tropics, which may offer profoundly different niches for urban wildlife. Here, we report how the population levels of a scavenging raptor which breeds in the megacity of Delhi, the black kite Milvus migrans, depend on spatial variation in human subsidies, mainly in the form of philanthropic offerings of meat given for religious purposes. This tight connection with human culture, which generated the largest raptor concentration in the world, was modulated further by breeding-site availability. The latter constrained the level of resource-tracking by the kites and their potential ecosystem service, and could be used as a density-management tool. Similar ties between animal population densities, key anthropogenic resources and human beliefs may occur in thousands of cities all over the globe and may fit poorly with our current understanding of urban ecosystem functioning. For many urban animals, key resources are inextricably linked with human culture, an aspect that has been largely overlooked.",Human-induced reductions in fish predator boldness decrease their predation rates in kelp forests.,https://www.ncbi.nlm.nih.gov/pubmed/30940058,Proceedings. Biological sciences,2019 05 16,"Humans have restructured food webs and ecosystems by depleting biomass, reducing size structure and altering traits of consumers. However, few studies have examined the ecological impacts of human-induced trait changes across large spatial and temporal scales and species assemblages. We compared behavioural traits and predation rates by predatory fishes on standard squid prey in protected areas of different protection levels and ages, and found that predation rates were 6.5 times greater at old, no-take (greater than 40 years) relative to new, predominantly partial-take areas (approx. 8 years), even accounting for differences in predatory fish abundance, body size and composition across sites. Individual fishes in old protected areas consumed prey at nearly twice the rate of fishes of the same species and size at new protected areas. Predatory fish exhibited on average 50% longer flight initiation distance and lower willingness to forage at new protected areas, which partially explains lower foraging rates at new relative to old protected areas. Our experiments demonstrate that humans can effect changes in functionally important behavioural traits of predator guilds at large (30 km) spatial scales within managed areas, which require protection for multiple generations of predators to recover bold phenotypes and predation rates, even as abundance rebounds.",Why is Amazonia a 'source' of biodiversity? Climate-mediated dispersal and synchronous speciation across the Andes in an avian group (Tityrinae).,https://www.ncbi.nlm.nih.gov/pubmed/30940057,Proceedings. Biological sciences,2019 05 16,"Amazonia is a 'source' of biodiversity for other Neotropical ecosystems, but which conditions trigger in situ speciation and emigration is contentious. Three hypotheses for how communities have assembled include (1) a stochastic model wherein chance dispersal events lead to gradual emigration and species accumulation, (2) diversity-dependence wherein successful dispersal events decline through time due to ecological limits, and (3) barrier displacement wherein environmental change facilitates dispersal to other biomes via transient habitat corridors. We sequenced thousands of molecular markers for the Neotropical Tityrinae (Aves) and applied a novel filtering protocol to identify loci with high utility for dated phylogenomics. We used these loci to estimate divergence times and model Tityrinae's evolutionary history. We detected a prominent role for speciation driven by barriers including synchronous speciation across the Andes and found that dispersal increased toward the present. Because diversification was continuous but dispersal was non-random over time, we show that barrier displacement better explains Tityrinae's history than stochasticity or diversity-dependence. We propose that Amazonia is a source of biodiversity because (1) it is a relic of a biome that was once more extensive, (2) environmentally mediated corridors facilitated emigration and (3) constant diversification is attributed to a spatially heterogeneous landscape that is perpetually dynamic through time.",Common Caribbean corals exhibit highly variable responses to future acidification and warming.,https://www.ncbi.nlm.nih.gov/pubmed/30940056,Proceedings. Biological sciences,2019 05 16,"We conducted a 93-day experiment investigating the independent and combined effects of acidification (280-3300 µatm pCO2) and warming (28°C and 31°C) on calcification and linear extension rates of four key Caribbean coral species ( Siderastrea siderea, Pseudodiploria strigosa, Porites astreoides, Undaria tenuifolia) from inshore and offshore reefs on the Belize Mesoamerican Barrier Reef System. All species exhibited nonlinear declines in calcification rate with increasing pCO2. Warming only reduced calcification in Ps. strigosa. Of the species tested, only S. siderea maintained positive calcification in the aragonite-undersaturated treatment . Temperature and pCO2 had no effect on the linear extension of S. siderea and Po. astreoides, and natal reef environment did not impact any parameter examined. Results suggest that S. siderea is the most resilient of these corals to warming and acidification owing to its ability to maintain positive calcification in all treatments, Ps. strigosa and U. tenuifolia are the least resilient, and Po. astreoides falls in the middle. These results highlight the diversity of calcification responses of Caribbean corals to projected global change."

Dental erosions are caused by the recurring contact of solutions which are unsaturated in tooth minerals,ith hard tooth substances. This initially leads to softening and later to an irreversible loss of hard tooth substance. Erosion is observed particularly with excessive consumption of acidic foods (e.g. soft drinks or citrus fruits) but also in connection with gastrointestinal (gastroesophageal reflux disease) or psychosomatic diseases (anorexia nervosa or bulimia nervosa). The aim of this article is to define dental erosions, their causes, prevalence and consequences as well as possible preventive measures.

Norovirus is the leading cause of acute viral gastroenteritis. Norovirus is highly contagious, thus outbreaks of norovirus in hospitals and long-term care facilities are feared. Usually, stool samples of patients with a potentially viral gastroenteritis are first checked for the presence of norovirus. In recent years, sapovirus and astrovirus were increasingly reported as cause of acute gastroenteritis. Outbreaks of acute viral gastroenteritis caused by sapovirus or astrovirus are hardly distinguishable from those caused by norovirus because of a similar clinical presentation. Molecular analyses of stool specimen are needed for accurate diagnosis of the viral cause of acute gastroenteritis. It is worth to further investigate stool samples of patients suspected of acute viral gastroenteritis not only for norovirus, but also for sapovirus and astrovirus.","[Blocked Nose, Nosebleeds, Ringing in the Ear: ENT Diseases During Pregnancy].",https://www.ncbi.nlm.nih.gov/pubmed/30940040,Praxis,2019 04 03,"Blocked Nose, Nosebleeds, Ringing in the Ear: ENT Diseases During Pregnancy Abstract.

The nephrotic syndrome is defined by renal protein loss with hypalbuminaemia and edema. Hyperlipoproteinemia and thrombophilia are not diagnostic criteria, but are frequently associated conditions. Patients with nephrotic syndrome are at higher risk for infections. Primary causes of a nephrotic syndrome are differentiated from secondary glomerulopathies due to systemic diseases. To confirm the diagnosis and for prognostic reasons, a kidney biopsy is performed in most cases. Steroids and other immunosuppressive agents are frontline therapies in primary forms. Secondary forms are treated by addressing the underlying disease. Therapeutic cornerstones include an adequate RAAS blockade with ACE inhibitors or AT-II receptor blockers. Loop diuretics are used to control edemas.

The Swiss population follows the trend of other industrialized countries and shows an increased life expectancy compared to previous generations. Old age is reached increasingly with one's own teeth. Older restorations of teeth must be replaced and produced anew. Previous reconstructions often have the disadvantage that they are invasive and reinterventions or new fabrications are only possible to a limited extent. Advances in material technology allow new minimally invasive therapies. Adhesive bridges have become possible due to material developments in material science and allow aesthetic, non-invasive, long-term stable solutions. The specialist dentist SSO for Reconstructive Dentistry is the expert for the rehabilitation of teeth after tooth loss. He takes care of the careful restoration of the teeth according to functional and aesthetic criteria and draws on a sound knowledge of therapy options, techniques and materials acquired in many years of additional training.",Evaluation of the accuracy and availability of cancer-related physical activity and sedentary behaviour information on English-language websites.,https://www.ncbi.nlm.nih.gov/pubmed/30940031,Journal of psychosocial oncology,2019 04 03,To assess the quality and accuracy of cancer-related physical activity (PA) and sedentary behaviour (SB) information provided on major cancer websites from English-speaking countries.,Incorporating intraspecific variation into dental microwear texture analysis.,https://www.ncbi.nlm.nih.gov/pubmed/30940029,"Journal of the Royal Society, Interface",2019 05 22,"Dental microwear texture analysis (DMTA) quantifies microscopic scar or wear patterns left on teeth by different foods or extraneous ingested items such as grit. It can be a powerful tool for deducing the diets of extinct mammals. Here we investigate how intraspecific variation in the dental microwear of macropodids (kangaroos and their close relatives) can be used to maximize the dietary signal inferable from an inherently limited fossil record. We demonstrate significant intraspecific variation for every factor considered here for both scale-sensitive fractal analysis and International Organization for Standardization surface texture analysis variables. Intraspecific factors were then incorporated into interspecific (dietary) analyses through the use of Linear Mixed Effects modelling, incorporating Akaike's Information Criterion to compare models, and testing models through independent cross-validation. This revealed that for each DMTA variable only a small number of intraspecific factors need to be included to improve differentiation between species. Including specimen as a random factor accounted for stochastic inter-individual variation, and facet, incorporated effects of sampling location. Intraspecific effects of ecoregion, microscope, tooth position and wear were often but not universally important. We conclude that models of microwear data that include intraspecific variation can improve the resolution of dietary reconstructions."

Logistic regression with positive odds ratio (POR) was used to analyse associations between positive self-reported health and school experiences. There was an association between positive self-reported health and school experiences among students. Positive mental health was the strongest predictor for positive school experiences. To frequently participate in Physical Education, have a positive body image and satisfactory sleep nearly doubled the students' odds for positive school experiences. The results also revealed gender differences; boys more often reported positive experiences of school and positive health than girls. Positive self-reported health is associated with positive experiences of school, particularly mental health. Moreover, these findings have significant implications for how students experience school and demonstrate the importance of including health-promoting interventions in systemic school improvement, meeting both girls' and boys' needs.","Therapeutic Role of Transcranial Direct Current Stimulation in Alzheimer Disease Patients: Double-Blind, Placebo-Controlled Clinical Trial.",https://www.ncbi.nlm.nih.gov/pubmed/30940012,Neurorehabilitation and neural repair,2019 05 23,"To explore the neuropsychological effects and levels of tau protein (TAU), amyloid β 1-42 (Aβ 1-42), and lipid peroxidase after 10 sessions of anodal transcranial direct current stimulation (tDCS) in patients with mild to moderate Alzheimer disease (AD).",The Role of Mental Health and Substance Use in Homeless Adults' Tobacco Use and Cessation Attempts.,https://www.ncbi.nlm.nih.gov/pubmed/30940011,Journal of dual diagnosis,2019 05 29,"Objective: Although tobacco use is prevalent among adults experiencing homelessness, research deficits exist regarding the mental health, substance use, and demographic correlates of tobacco use behaviors in this population. This study examined whether correlates of tobacco use among housed adults identified by the Center for Disease Control (CDC) were significant correlates of tobacco use and cessation attempts among a sample of homeless adults. Methods: Participants (N = 421) were adults experiencing homelessness entering permanent supportive housing programs in Los Angeles. Multivariate logistic regression determined associations of lifetime mental health diagnoses, recent substance use, demographic characteristics, and lifetime literal homelessness with daily tobacco use and cessation attempts. Results: Lifetime diagnoses of schizophrenia, posttraumatic stress disorder, depression, bipolar disorder, and illicit substance use were associated with increased odds of daily tobacco use. A lifetime diagnosis of depression was associated with an increased likelihood of a past 3-month tobacco cessation attempt, while illicit substance use was associated with a lower likelihood of a cessation attempt. Conclusions: Findings suggest that demographic and clinical characteristics associated with tobacco use differ among this sample of homeless adults and those identified by the CDC among housed adults. Mental health conditions and substance use appear to be the primary correlates of tobacco use among adults experiencing homelessness and may be critical in efforts aimed at improving cessation.",Conflating Temporal Advancement and Epistemic Advancement: The Progression Bias in Judgment and Decision Making.,https://www.ncbi.nlm.nih.gov/pubmed/30940010,Personality & social psychology bulletin,2019 04 03,"When seeking out the truth about a certain aspect of the world, people frequently conduct several inquiries successively over a time span.

Then the CNFs/PEGDA mixture was used to fabricate 3D cytocompatibility CNFs/PEGDA hydrogel scaffold by stereolithograph（SLA）process. The CNFs/PEGDA hydrogels were shaped by SLA, and then the aerogel scaffolds were prepared by the freeze-drying of hydrogels. The results showed that the CNFs/PEGDA mixtures with different CNFs contents are all transparent, homogeneous and with obvious shear-thinning property. The SLA fabricated CNFs/PEGDA aerogel scaffolds possess high and tunable compressive modulus and high porosity of approximately 90%. It is found that CNFs in the composite scaffolds played a significant role in structural shape integrity, porous structure and mechanical strength. In addition, the NIH 3T3 cells tightly adhere on the CNFs/PEGDA materials and spread on the scaffolds with good differentiation and viability. These results have revealed a superior method to prepare tissue engineering scaffolds which possesses suitable mechanical strength and biocompatibility for 3D cell cultivation.",Effects of exposure to ethanolic extract from Achyrocline satureioides (Lam.)

Male and female rats received by gavage 0, 250, 500 or 750 mg/kg of extract. The animals were treated from pre-mating until 13 days post-partum. Phytochemical analysis revealed the presence of important flavonoids (quercetin, luteolin, caffeic acid, rutin, and ferulic acid). In females, biochemical, hematological or gestational parameters were not markedly altered by the extract. However, an increase in calcium and thyroid stimulating hormone (TSH) levels was found in treated-dams. Although TSH and T4 levels were not significantly altered in pups, there was a rise in body weight of pups whose mothers were treated with the extract. All males treated were able to successfully copulate with treated-females. However, rats exposed to 500 and 750 mg/kg of extract exhibited a significant decrease in daily testicular sperm production and delay in sperm transit time in the epididymis. The ethanolic extract of A. satureioides flowers produced adverse effects in the male reproductive system as evidenced by diminished sperm production and transport. In addition, the extract elevated TSH levels of exposed mothers which may consequently affect the development of pups but this requires further evaluation."

This study investigated whether a Web-Based Autonomy-Supportive Intervention Program (WB-ASIP) for physical education (PE) teachers would alter their students' perceptions of (a) the teachers' multidimensional autonomy-supportive and controlling behaviors, (b) their own psychological need satisfaction and frustration, and (c) perceived intrinsic motivation. We found that WB-ASIP significantly increased students' perceptions of all autonomy-supportive teacher behaviors and students' need satisfaction. At follow-up, we found that WB-ASIP led to a significant decrease in students' perception of teacher intimidation behaviors and students' autonomy frustration. These results suggest that a web-based intervention program to enhance PE teachers' autonomy-supportive behavior and minimize their controlling behavior was partially effective in positively changing their students' perceptions.",Preparation of beta-tricalcium phosphate microsphere-hyaluronic acid-based powder gel composite as a carrier for rhBMP-2 injection and evaluation using long bone segmental defect model.,https://www.ncbi.nlm.nih.gov/pubmed/30939993,Journal of biomaterials science. Polymer edition,2019 04 30,"The specific objective of this study was to evaluate whether rhBMP-2-loaded bio-scaffolds can be used as effective rhBMP-2 carriers in the implantation of bone defect sites or poor bone quality in host bone. The rhBMP-2 release pattern test showed slow results in both groups, and a 1:9 ratio composition with a high water-absorption rate was selected for in vivo study. All animals euthanized after 9 weeks. The new bone formation and bone quantity and quality of fibular samples were examined. The results showed that the rhBMP-2 powder gel composite improved the new bone formation in the cortical bone and the marrow space. The length of new bone formation ratio of the rhBMP-2 loaded composite group was significantly higher than the powder gel group. The composite of powder gel seems to be a nice carrier, and slow release of rhBMP-2 can promote new bone formation in a segmental cortical bone defect after implantation.","Illusions With Hands, but Not With Balloons - Comparing Ownership and Referral of Touch for a Corporal and Noncorporal Object After Visuotactile Stimulation.",https://www.ncbi.nlm.nih.gov/pubmed/30939992,Perception,2019 05 08,"The rubber hand illusion is a perceptual illusion of perceiving an object like a model hand as part of the own body. The question whether the illusion can be induced with noncorporal objects that do not look like a human body part is not perfectly resolved yet. In this study, we directly assessed the subjective experience of two different components within the illusion (i.e., ownership and referral of touch) when a model hand and a balloon are stimulated. We observed significantly stronger illusion ratings for the hand as compared with the balloon, and only the hand ratings showed a clear affirmation of the illusion. We further conclude that (a) a significant difference between synchronous and asynchronous conditions may not be sufficient to argue for the successful induction of the illusion and (b) the subcomponents show a different pattern in the different conditions, which may lead to alternative interpretations. These observations call for a more fine-grained interpretation of questionnaire data in rubber hand illusion studies.",What Is a Face? Critical Features for Face Detection.,https://www.ncbi.nlm.nih.gov/pubmed/30939991,Perception,2019 05 08,"Faces convey very rich information that is critical for intact social interaction. To extract this information efficiently, faces should be easily detected from a complex visual scene. Here, we asked which features are critical for face detection. To answer this question, we presented non-face objects that generate a strong percept of a face (i.e., Pareidolia). One group of participants rated the faceness of this set of inanimate images. A second group rated the presence of a set of 12 local and global facial features. Regression analysis revealed that only the eyes or mouth significantly contributed to faceness scores. We further showed that removing eyes or mouth, but not teeth or ears, significantly reduced faceness scores. These findings show that face detection depends on specific facial features, the eyes and the mouth. This minimal information leads to over-generalization that generates false face percepts but assures that real faces are not missed.",The Relation of Inflammaging With Skeletal Muscle Properties in Elderly Men.,https://www.ncbi.nlm.nih.gov/pubmed/30939990,American journal of men's health,2019 04 14,"Aging is associated with a progressive decline of muscle mass and/or the qualitative impairment of the muscle tissue. There is growing evidence of the prominent role of low-grade chronic inflammation in age-related changes in the neuromuscular system. The purpose of the study was to identify the inflammatory mediators responsible for deficit in functional fitness and to explain whether inflammation is related to changes in body composition and the decline of muscle strength in older men. Thirty-three old-aged males (73.5 ± 6.3 years) and twenty young-aged males (21.2 ± 1.3 years) participated in the study. The body composition (bioelectrical impedance analysis), functional capacity (6-min walking test) and knee extension strength (isokinetic test) were estimated. In serum, circulating inflammatory markers H2O2, IL-1β, TNFα, and hsCRP as well as growth factors IGF-I and PDGFBB concentrations were determined (immunoenzymatic methods). The concentrations of H2O2, IL-1β, TNFα, and hsCRP were significantly higher in older than young men. The growth factors IGF-I and PDGFBB were twofold lower and related to high levels of IL-1β and TNFα in the elderly. The changes in cytokines and growth factors levels were correlated with age and peak torque (TQ at 60°/s and 180°/s) in the knee extension. The result of the 6-min walking test was inversely correlated with fat mass index (FMI, r = -.983; p < .001). The generation of inflammatory mediators in older men was related to changes in body composition, maximum strength muscle, and age-related changes in skeletal muscle properties responsible for deficit in functional fitness.","Menstrual cycle alters training strain, monotony, and technical training length in young.",https://www.ncbi.nlm.nih.gov/pubmed/30939987,Journal of sports sciences,2019 04 03,"The menstrual cycle (MC) phases carry to several psychophysiological alterations; however, no study has investigated the impact of MC phases on training load or technical training. In the present study, we investigated the effect of the follicular phase (FP), ovulatory phase (OP), and luteal phase (LP) on training load and technical training in young athletes. Twelve female athletes performed regular daily training sessions with the rating of perceived exertion (RPE) and duration being registered every session. Training impulse (TRIMP), monotony and strain were calculated. MC symptoms, RPE, and duration were also measured during technical training, which was carried out on a specific day during each phase. The TRIMP was not affected by MC phases during regular training (p > .05), but training monotony and strain were higher in FP compared to OP (p < .05). During the technical training, MC phases did not affect RPE (p > .05), but the session was longer in both FP and LP, compared to OP (p < .05). MC symptoms were exacerbated in FP compared to both OP and LP (p < .05). These findings suggest that MC disorders were elevated during FP, which indicate that monitoring MC phases might provide important feedbacks for programming training and expected results during competitions.",The DePuy Proxima™ short stem for total hip arthroplasty - Excellent outcome at a minimum of 7 years.,https://www.ncbi.nlm.nih.gov/pubmed/30939986,Journal of orthopaedic surgery (Hong Kong),2019 04 03,"Metaphyseal, proximally anchored uncemented stems for total hip arthroplasty provide bone preservation and decrease the incidence of proximal stress shielding and thigh pain.

Part. B, Pesticides, food contaminants, and agricultural wastes",2019 05 30,"Fipronil is a broad-spectrum insecticide that has a good control effect on pests of commercial poultry. Although many studies have reported the environmental fate of fipronil, the influence of residual fipronil in poultry waste on biogas production has not been further explored yet. In this article, an experimental comparative study on anaerobic digestion (AD) of chicken manure (CM) and corn straw (CS) with different fipronil concentrations (FCs) was carried at 8% of total solid (TS) and mid-temperature (35 ± 1)°C. The results showed that fipronil had a significant effect on biogas production during AD of CM and CS. When the FC is at a low level (≤10 mg·kg-1), the biogas production rate is increased and the digestion period was shortened, while higher FC (≥ 20 mg·kg-1) showed an inhibitory effect. During the monitoring of enzyme activity, low FC showed no significant effect on cellulase and saccharase, but the urease activity increased in the early stage. High FC showed inhibition of activity of cellulase and urease, but the saccharase activity was significantly inhibited until FC reached 40 mg·kg-1. This study also confirms that the environment in anaerobic digester is favorable for the degradation of fipronil, and its half-life is about 15.83 days.","Analysis of the behavior for operation parameters in the anaerobic digestion process with thermal pretreatment, using fuzzy logic.",https://www.ncbi.nlm.nih.gov/pubmed/30939984,"Journal of environmental science and health. Part A, Toxic/hazardous substances & environmental engineering",2019 05 13,"This article presents a study that identifies the variables with greatest impact on the biogas and methane production over a process with thermal pretreatment, to accelerate anaerobic digestion process in sewage sludge in a water treatment plant, for a poultry processing factory, by using fuzzy logic. The designed fuzzy logic model includes 688 inference rules, with a correlation of 99.3% between prediction data against experimental data, for the biogas variable; and 97% for the methane variable. The predictions of the fuzzy logic model were analyzed with response surface models, and it is concluded that the temperature and operating time variables are mutually determining in the biogas and methane production. Likewise, this research provides a methodology for the design of an expert decision support system that allows to evaluate and optimize a mesophilic anaerobic digestion process through a previous thermal treatment in order to improve the yields of biogas and methane in the treatment of effluent sludge from agroindustry. These results propose to diffuse logic as a reliable tool to make comparisons, and predictions for operation variables management on the treatment of residual sludge with thermal pretreatment on anaerobic digestion."

Earlier studies on biological clocks speculated that the timing of behavior and its accuracy are determined by the intrinsic period (τ) of the circadian clock under constant conditions, its stability, the period of the external cycle (T), and resetting of the clock by environmental time cues. However, most of these previous studies suffered from certain limitations, the major ones being a narrow range of examined τ values and a non-uniformity in the genetic background across the individuals tested. We present data that rigorously test the following hypotheses by employing Drosophila melanogaster fruit flies with τ ranging from 17 to 30 h in a uniform genetic background. We tested whether 1) precision (day-to-day stability of τ) is greater for clocks with τ close to 24 h; 2) accuracy (i.e., day-to-day stability of the phase relationship (ψ), where ψ is the duration between a phase of the rhythm and a phase of the external cycle) is greater for clocks with τ close to 24 h; 3) Ψ is delayed with an increase in τ; and 4) Ψ becomes more advanced with an increase in length of zeitgeber cycle (T). We show that precision is not always maximum for ~24-h clocks, but that accuracy is greatest when τ approximates T. Further, flies exhibit a delayed phase relationship with increasing τ and an advanced phase relationship under long T-cycles as compared with shorter T-cycles. We also describe relationships between activity and rest durations and how our observations fit predictions from models of circadian entrainment. Overall, we confirm that accuracy and phase of entrained rhythm are governed by both intrinsic clock period and the length of the external cycle; however, we find that the relationship between intrinsic period and precision does not fit previous predictions.",Factors Affecting the Choice of National and Public Hospitals Among Outpatient Service Users in South Korea.,https://www.ncbi.nlm.nih.gov/pubmed/30939970,"Inquiry : a journal of medical care organization, provision and financing",2019 04 14,"The present study analyzed factors underlying outpatient service users' choice of national and public (rather than private) hospitals. Based on Andersen's Behavioral Model, we developed a framework that covered needs, enabling, and personal factors. Data of outpatient service usage were obtained from the Korean medical panel survey during 2008 to 2013. Logistic regression analyses were conducted, and results revealed that the rate of national and public hospital use was very low (5.57%), and our model adequately explained variance in service use. Specifically, several demographic factors-older age, low income, national merit and medical care, being chronically ill, and having a disability-were predictive of whether an individual is likely to choose national and public hospitals. We discuss the need to strengthen national and public hospitals' medical services in order to better manage care for low-income vulnerable groups.","The ""Arm-to-Chest Tunneling"" technique: A modified technique for arm placement of implantable ports or central catheters.",https://www.ncbi.nlm.nih.gov/pubmed/30939969,The journal of vascular access,2019 04 03,"Central venous catheters or ""venous access devices"" include totally implantable venous access devices or ""ports,"" peripherally inserted central catheters, and tunneled lines.

Various studies have shown that Spin proteins are localized in lysosomes and participate in the late stages of the autophagic process. Vertebrates have three spinster orthologs, Spns1, Spns2, and Spns3. A defect in Spns1 caused a short lifespan with aberrant lysosomal function in zebrafish. Spns2 was originally isolated as the gene responsible for abnormal heart development and was identified as a sphingosine 1-phosphate transporter in zebrafish. An endothelial cell-specific defect in Spns2 resulted in impaired egress of lymphocytes and the prevention of tumor metastasis in mice.

This study was a test of the cultural spillover theory as it applies to intimate partner violence (IPV). Based on data from the International Dating Violence Study (IDVS) in 32 countries, we tested the proposition that agreement with socially approved forms of violence ""spills over"" into violence against an intimate partner. Two versions of an index to measure legitimate violence were constructed: (a) An individual-level legitimate violence index based on the beliefs and behavior of 14,252 university students in 32 nations in the IDVS and (b) a nation-level legitimate violence index consisting of the mean of the student scores on the legitimate violence index for each of the 32 nations in the IDVS. We used the revised Conflict Tactics Scales to obtain the data on physical violence and injuries inflicted by the students in the IDVS. Analysis of covariance (ANCOVA) was used to test the hypothesized relation of the individual student legitimate violence index to IPV. Socioeconomic status, limited disclosure scale, respondent's age, and length of the relationships were included as covariates. Multiple regression analyses were conducted to further investigate the associations between legitimate violence index obtained from the aggregated student data and the nation-level IPV, controlling for the gross domestic product (GDP) index and limited disclosure scale. Both individual- and nation-level analyses consistently supported cultural spillover theory's explanation of IPV. The association between legitimate violence and IPV at both levels of analysis was stronger for women than men, which is consistent with some previous studies. The results suggest that reducing legitimate violence can make an important contribution to reducing IPV.",Oncology Nurse Managers' Perceptions of Palliative Care and End-of-Life Communication.,https://www.ncbi.nlm.nih.gov/pubmed/30939966,Journal of pediatric oncology nursing : official journal of the Association of Pediatric Oncology Nurses,2019 04 12,"The purpose of this study was to describe pediatric oncology nurse managers' (NMs) perspectives of palliative care/end-of-life (PC/EOL) communication. The study, guided by group-as-a-whole theory and empirical phenomenology, was part of a larger, multisite study aimed at understanding pediatric oncology nurses' experiences of PC/EOL communication. Nurses were assigned to focus groups based on length or type of experience (i.e., nurses with <1, 2-5, or >5 years' work experience and NMs). Eleven NMs from three Midwestern pediatric hospitals with large oncology programs participated in one focus group. The participants' mean years of experience was 15.8 in nursing and 12 in pediatric oncology; 90% had a BSN or higher degree; all had supervisory responsibilities.

TBK1 phosphorylates the cargo receptors OPTN and SQSTM1 regulating a critical step in macroautophagy/autophagy. Disruption of the autophagic flux leads to accumulation of cytosolic protein aggregates, which are a hallmark of ALS. hiPSC-derived TBK1-mutant motoneurons (MNs) showed reduced TBK1 levels and accumulation of cytosolic SQSTM1-positive aggresomes. By screening a library of nuclear-receptor-agonists for modifiers of the SQSTM1 aggregates, we identified 4-hydroxy(phenyl)retinamide (4HPR) as a potent modifier exerting detrimental effects on mutant-TBK1 motoneurons fitness exacerbating the autophagy overload. We have shown by TEM that TBK1-mutant motoneurons accumulate immature phagophores due a failure in the elongation phase, and 4HPR further worsens the burden of dysfunctional phagophores. 4HPR-increased toxicity was associated with the upregulation of SQSTM1 in a context of strongly reduced ATG10, while rescue of ATG10 levels abolished 4HPR toxicity. Finally, we showed that 4HPR leads to a downregulation of ATG10 and to an accumulation of SQSTM1+ aggresomes also in hiPSC-derived C9orf72-mutant motoneurons. Our data show that cultured human motoneurons harboring mutations in TBK1 gene display typical ALS features, like decreased viability and accumulation of cytosolic SQSTM1-positive aggresomes. The retinoid 4HPR appears a strong negative modifier of the fitness of TBK1 and C9orf72-mutant MNs, through a pathway converging on the mismatch of initiated autophagy and ATG10 levels. Thus, autophagy induction appears not to be a therapeutic strategy for ALS unless the specific underlying pathway alterations are properly addressed.

Yet a systematic analysis of the feasibility and reproducibility of these tools is lacking. Here we focused on InSITE GAL4 drivers that specifically label different subpopulations of olfactory neurons, particularly local interneurons (LNs), and genetically swapped the GAL4 domain for LexA, GAL80 or QF at the same locus. We found that the major utility-limiting factor for these genetic swaps is that many do not fully reproduce the original GAL4 expression patterns. Different donors exhibit distinct efficacies for reproducing original GAL4 expression patterns. The successfully swapped lines reported here will serve as valuable reagents and expand the genetic toolkits of Drosophila olfactory circuit research."

We addressed the possibility that deficits in lysyl oxidase (LOX) contribute to the extracellular matrix (ECM) phenotype of TSP-deficient bone. We examined detergent insoluble (mature cross-linked) and soluble (newly secreted) ECM fractions prepared from diaphyseal cortical bone. Detergent-insoluble hydroxyproline content, an indicator of cross-linked collagen content and LOX function, was reduced in female TSP-deficient bones. In male diaphyses, only TSP2 deficiency affected insoluble hydroxyproline content. Western blot suggested that removal of the LOX-pro-peptide (LOPP), an indication of LOX activation, was not affected by TSP status. Instead, the distribution of pro-LOX and mature LOX between immature and mature ECM was altered by TSP-status. LOX was also examined in primary marrow-derived mesenchymal stem cells (MSC) treated with ascorbate. Relative LOPP levels were elevated compared to WT in MSC conditioned medium from female TSP-deficient mice. When cells were serum starved to limit LOX pro-peptide removal, pro-LOX levels were elevated in TSP2-/- cells compared to wild-type. This phenotype was associated with a transient increase in BMP1 levels in TSP2-/- conditioned medium. TSP2 was detected in bone tissue and osteoblast cell culture. TSP1 was only detected in insoluble ECM prepared from WT diaphyseal bone samples.

Glucosinolate and myrosinase are spatially present in different cells that upon tissue disruption come together and result in the formation of a variety of hydrolysis products with diverse physicochemical and biological properties. The myrosinase-catalyzed reaction starts with cleavage of the thioglucosidic linkage resulting in release of a D-glucose and an unstable thiohydroximate-O-sulfate. The outcome of this thiohydroximate-O-sulfate has been shown to depend on the structure of the glucosinolate side chain, the presence of supplementary proteins known as specifier proteins and/or on the physiochemical condition. Myrosinase was first reported in mustard seed during 1939 as a protein responsible for release of essential oil. Until this date, myrosinases have been characterized from more than 20 species of Brassica, cabbage aphid, and many bacteria residing in the human intestine. All the plant myrosinases are reported to be activated by ascorbic acid while aphid and bacterial myrosinases are found to be either neutral or inhibited. Myrosinase catalyzes hydrolysis of the S-glycosyl bond, O-β glycosyl bond, and O-glycosyl bond. This review summarizes information on myrosinase, an essential component of this binary system, including its structural and molecular properties, mechanism of action, and its regulation and will be beneficial for the research going on the understanding and betterment of the glucosinolate-myrosinase system from an ecological and nutraceutical perspective.",Montreal Cognitive Assessment in a Greek sample of patients with multiple sclerosis: A validation study.,https://www.ncbi.nlm.nih.gov/pubmed/30939943,Applied neuropsychology. Adult,2019 04 03,"The Montreal Cognitive Assessment (MoCA) is a brief cognitive instrument for the measurement of dementia. The aim of the present study was to measure the sensitivity of this test in a group of Greek speaking participants diagnosed with multiple sclerosis. 40 MS participants complaining for cognitive dysfunction were matched in age and education to 490 healthy participants. The MoCA test and a neuropsychological test battery were administered to both groups. The MoCA test was found to differentiate the MS from the controls (U = 3761.00, p < .001) and it was correlated with all neuropsychological tests (digit span: r = 0.454, p < .0001; phonemic verbal fluency: r = 0.390, p < .0001; semantic verbal fluency: r = 0.319, p < .0001; Color Trails Test 1 (CTT1): r = -.256, p < .0001; Color Trails Test 2 (CTT2): r = -.321, p < .0001). Multiple regression analysis showed that 10.3% of the variation in the MoCA score was accounted for by the Expanded Disability Status Scale (EDSS) total score. Also, the test showed high discriminant validity (optimal screening cut off point 25, sensitivity 0.68, specificity 0.89). MoCA is a sensitive test to differentiate cognitive impairment in Greek speaking MS participants from healthy controls.

Either for wine or juice production, grape processing generates a large amount of residues that must be treated, disposed of or reused properly to reduce their pollution load before being applied to the soil. In this review, a special focus is given to the treatment and valorization of the winemaking by-product like grape marc via anaerobic digestion, composting and vermicomposting at laboratory, pilot, and industrial scales. The impact of the final products (digestates, composts, and vermicomposts) on soil properties is briefly addressed. Moreover, the role of grape marc and seeds as a valuable source of natural phytochemicals that include polyphenols and other bioactive compounds of interest for pharmaceutical, cosmetic, and food industries is also discussed. This is of paramount importance given the fact that sustainability requires the use of management and valorization strategies that allow the recovery of valuable compounds (e.g. antioxidants) with minimum disposal of waste streams."

Hearing thresholds at 2 and 4 kHz were also analyzed. Glasgow Benefit Inventory (GBI) was used in 21 patients to assess life quality changes. Hearing thresholds improved in 80% of ears (mean improvement, 26.3 dB), were unchanged in 11.4%, and worsened in 8.6%. Mean GBI score was +20.7. Hearing aid use decreased in 23.8% and ceased in 28.6%. One patient subsequently underwent CI. For patients with profound otosclerosis, stapes surgery provides a quantitative improvement in hearing thresholds and improvement in quality of life, with reduced reliance on hearing aids. This avoids CI, auditory rehabilitation, and a change in quality and tonality of sound."

This work aims at describing the continuum of care among recently HIV-infected people who inject drugs (PWID) and participated in an intervention in the context of an HIV outbreak in Athens, Greece. The Transmission Reduction Intervention Project (TRIP) conducted risk network-based contact tracing and screened people for recent HIV infection. A comprehensive approach with a case management component that aimed to remove barriers to accessing care was adopted. Follow-up data on antiretroviral treatment (ART) and HIV-RNA levels were obtained from HIV clinics. TRIP enrolled 45 recently HIV-infected PWID (80% male) with a median viral load at recruitment of 5.43 log10 copies/mL. Of the recently infected persons in TRIP, 87% were linked to care; of these, 77% started ART; and of those on ART, 89% achieved viral load <200 copies/mL. TRIP and its public health allies managed to get most of the recently HIV-infected PWID who were identified by the program into care and many of them onto ART. This resulted in very low HIV-RNA levels.

The effects of hypo- and hyper-thyroidism in mitigating or exacerbating the negative changes of chronic heat stress (HS) in broilers were investigated. 2. Three-week-old broilers were distributed into six groups (n = 13 per group). Three groups were housed at ambient room temperature: control group (CN), propylthiouracil-treated group (AN) and thyroxine-treated group (TN). The other three groups were exposed to HS at 33 ± 1°C for 2 weeks: control heat stress (CH), propylthiouracil + heat stress (AH) and thyroxine + HS (TH). 3. Induced hypothyroidy significantly decreased cloacal temperature and body weight gain in the birds in both the normal and HS groups (AN, AH). Conversely, hyperthyroidy resulted in a significant elevation in cloacal temperature in the TN and TH groups and a significant decline in weight gain in the TH group. Hyperthyroidy exacerbated the HS-induced degenerative changes in jejunal mucosa and caused noticeable vascular changes. A significant increase in the expression levels of jejunal nutrient transporter genes was observed in the AH and TH groups. The hyperthyroidic state significantly upregulated the HSP70 expression level in the TH group and the reverse occurred with propylthiouracil (PTU) treatment in the AH group. 4. PTU supplementation to chicks reared under HS significantly decreased the triiodothyronine level, antibody (Ab) titre, and increased the heterophil-lymphocyte ratio. Furthermore, it induced higher hepatic glutathione peroxidase (GSH-Px) activity in the AN and AH groups and decreased the malondialdehyde content (MDA) in the AN group. Hyperthyroidy significantly increased triiodothyronine concentration, H/L ratio and decreased Hb concentration and Ab titres in the TH group. Additionally, this status increased the MDA content and decreased the GSH-Px activities. 5. In conclusion, manipulation of thyroid status is not a remedy to overcome the undesirable effects of HS in broilers.",Hearing Outcomes Following Type 3 Tympanoplasty With Stapes Columella Grafting in Canal Wall Down Mastoidectomy.,https://www.ncbi.nlm.nih.gov/pubmed/30939895,"The Annals of otology, rhinology, and laryngology",2019 04 03,To analyze hearing outcomes following Type 3 tympanoplasty with stapes columella grafting after canal wall down mastoidectomy and determine disease recurrence rates in patients undergoing this procedure.,The AASPIRE practice-based guidelines for the inclusion of autistic adults in research as co-researchers and study participants.,https://www.ncbi.nlm.nih.gov/pubmed/30939892,Autism : the international journal of research and practice,2019 04 03,"As interest in autism in adulthood grows, so does the need for methods to promote the inclusion of autistic adults in research.

Liver disease is more severe in patients with psoriasis than in controls without psoriasis and is associated with the severity. Similarly, patients with fatty liver disease have more severe psoriasis. This harmful synergy has a common pathogenic origin, resulting from the frequent association between both diseases, insulin resistance and the metabolic syndrome. The disease manifests with a greater intensity when both conditions co-occur than when each manifests separately. Furthermore, psoriasis and fatty liver also have a common cytokine-mediated inflammatory background, which involves an imbalance between pro-inflammatory and anti-inflammatory cytokines. In fact, each disease plays a role in the course of the other. The dermatologist should usually detect liver disease after a specific assessment of patients who present with the metabolic syndrome. The hepatologist should be aware of the more severe condition of these patients. Various medications, such as acitretin, cyclosporine and methotrexate may prove harmful for patients with liver disease. Biologics have proven to be safe in patients with chronic liver disease. Hepatologists and dermatologists should work together to ensure the careful evaluation of the optimal therapy for each patient depending on the severity of both diseases, taking care to avoid, where possible, hepatotoxic drugs and select options that may even have a shared benefit for both diseases.",Immunohistochemical diagnostics of Hirschprungs disease using calretinin.,https://www.ncbi.nlm.nih.gov/pubmed/30939888,Ceskoslovenska patologie,2019 04 03,"Histochemical diagnosis of Hirschsprung´s disease at our institution was introduced in the 1970s, calretinin imunohistochemistry on formalin fixed tissue was newly added in 2015.

Calretinin seems highly reliable and easy to evaluate, it is not influenced by patient´s age, associated genetic features or the length of agangliosis. The number of inadequate samples was very low (3.8%). Histochemistry is useful as an adjunct tool to correct equivocal findings of calretinin staining and to facilitate diagnosis of short and ultra-short Hirschsprung´s disease. Serial biopsies from distal rectum and adjacent large bowel were obtained to assess the length of agangliosis preoperatively. The results of calretinin imunohistochemistry correlated very well with the findings in the colectomy specimens. In contrast, the length of affected bowel detected by histochemistry was often underestimated because acetylcholinesterase activity always diminishes orally irrespective of the length of aganglionic portion."

The effects of obesity on the metabolic profiles of tissues (liver, kidney, pancreas), urine, and the systemic circulation were investigated in the Zucker rat model using 1H NMR spectroscopy coupled to multivariate statistical analysis. The metabolic profiles of the obese ( fa/ fa) animals were clearly differentiated from the two phenotypically lean phenotypes, ((+/+) and ( fa/+)) within each biological compartment studied, and across all matrices combined. No significant differences were observed between the metabolic profiles of the genotypically distinct lean strains. Obese Zucker rats were characterized by higher relative concentrations of blood lipid species, cross-compartmental amino acids (particularly BCAAs), urinary and liver metabolites relating to the TCA cycle and glucose metabolism; and lower amounts of urinary gut microbial-host cometabolites, and intermatrix metabolites associated with creatine metabolism. Further to this, the obese Zucker rat metabotype was defined by significant metabolic alterations relating to disruptions in the metabolism of choline across all compartments analyzed. The cage environment was found to have a significant effect on urinary metabolites related to gut-microbial metabolism, with additional cage-microenvironment trends also observed in liver, kidney, and pancreas. This study emphasizes the value in metabotyping multiple biological matrices simultaneously to gain a better understanding of systemic perturbations in metabolism, and also underscores the need for control or evaluation of cage environment when designing and interpreting data from metabonomic studies in animal models.",Hot Electron Transport on Three-Dimensional Pt/Mesoporous TiO2 Schottky Nanodiodes.,https://www.ncbi.nlm.nih.gov/pubmed/30939872,ACS applied materials & interfaces,2019 04 29,"We present the design of a three-dimensional Pt/mesoporous TiO2 Schottky nanodiode that can capture hot electrons more effectively, compared with a typical two-dimensional Schottky diode. Both chemically induced and photon-induced hot electrons were measured on the three-dimensional Pt/mesoporous TiO2 Schottky nanodiode. An increase in the number of interfacial sites between the platinum and support oxide affects the collection of hot electrons generated by both the catalytic reaction and light injection. We show that hot electrons flowing 2.5 times higher are detected as the current in the mesoporous system, compared with typical two-dimensional nanodiode systems that have a planar Schottky junction. Identical trends for the chemicurrent and photocurrent in the mesoporous system demonstrate that the enhanced hot electrons are attributed to the larger interface area between the metal and the mesoporous TiO2 support fabricated by the anodization process. This three-dimensional Schottky nanodiode can provide insights into hot electron generation on a practical catalytic device.","""Teamwork Makes the Dream Work"": Tribal Competition Evolutionary Search as a Surrogate for Free-Energy-Based Structural Predictions.",https://www.ncbi.nlm.nih.gov/pubmed/30939871,The journal of physical chemistry. A,2019 05 03,"Crystal structure prediction has been a grand challenge in material science owing to the large configurational space that one must explore. Evolutionary (genetic) algorithms coupled with first principles calculations are commonly used in crystal structure prediction to sample the ground and metastable states of materials based on configurational energies. However, crystal structure predictions at finite temperature ( T), pressure ( P), and composition ( X) require a free-energy-based search that is often computationally expensive and tedious. Here, we introduce a new machine-learning workflow for structure prediction that is based on a concept inspired by the evolution of human tribes in primitive society. Our tribal genetic algorithm (GA) combines configurational sampling with evolutionary optimization to accurately predict entropically stabilized phases at finite ( T, P, X), at a computational cost that is an order of magnitude smaller than that required for a free-energy-based search. In a departure from standard GA techniques, the populations of individuals are divided into multiple tribes based on a bond-order fingerprint, and genetic operations are modified to ensure that cluster configurations are sampled adequately to capture entropic contributions. Team competition introduced into the evolutionary process allows winning teams (representing a better set of individuals) to expand their sizes; this translates into a more expanded search of the phase space allowing us to explore solutions near possible global minimum. Each team explores a specific section of the structural phase space and avoids bias on solutions arising from the use of individual populations in a purely energy-based search. We demonstrate the efficacy of our approach by performing the structural prediction of a representative two-dimensional two-body system as well as Lennard-Jones clusters over a range of temperatures up to its melting point. Our approach outperforms the standard GA approaches and enables structural search under ""real nonambient conditions"" on both bulk systems and finite-sized clusters.",Conductive Hydrogen Sulfide-Releasing Hydrogel Encapsulating ADSCs for Myocardial Infarction Treatment.,https://www.ncbi.nlm.nih.gov/pubmed/30939870,ACS applied materials & interfaces,2019 04 24,"Hydrogen sulfide (H2S) exhibits extensive protective actions in cardiovascular systems, such as anti-inflammatory and stimulating angiogenesis, but its therapeutic potential is severely discounted by the short half-life and the poorly controlled releasing behavior. Herein, we developed a macromolecular H2S prodrug by grafting 2-aminopyridine-5-thiocarboxamide (a small-molecule H2S donor) on partially oxidized alginate (ALG-CHO) to mimic the slow and continuous release of endogenous H2S. In addition, tetraaniline (a conductive oligomer) and adipose-derived stem cells (ADSCs) were introduced to form a stem cell-loaded conductive H2S-releasing hydrogel through the Schiff base reaction between ALG-CHO and gelatin. The hydrogel exhibited adhesive property to ensure a stable anchoring to the wet and beating hearts. After myocardial injection, longer ADSCs retention period and elevated sulfide concentration in rat myocardium were demonstrated, accompanied by upregulation of cardiac-related mRNA (Cx43, α-SMA, and cTnT) and angiogenic factors (VEGFA and Ang-1) and downregulation of inflammatory factors (tumor necrosis factor-α). Echocardiography and histological analysis strongly demonstrated an increase in the ejection fraction value and smaller infarction size, suggesting a remarkable improvement of the cardiac functions of Sprague-Dawley rats. The ADSC-loaded conductive hydrogen sulfide-releasing hydrogel dramatically promoted the therapeutic effects, offering a promising therapeutic strategy for treating myocardial infarction.",Synergy between Synthetic Antimicrobial Polymer and Antibiotics: A Promising Platform To Combat Multidrug-Resistant Bacteria.,https://www.ncbi.nlm.nih.gov/pubmed/30939869,ACS infectious diseases,2019 04 11,"The failure of many antibiotics in the treatment of chronic infections caused by multidrug-resistant (MDR) bacteria necessitates the development of effective strategies to combat this global healthcare issue. Here, we report an antimicrobial platform based on the synergistic action between commercially available antibiotics and a potent synthetic antimicrobial polymer that consists of three key functionalities: low-fouling oligoethylene glycol, hydrophobic ethylhexyl, and cationic primary amine groups. Checkerboard assays with Pseudomonas aeruginosa ( P. aeruginosa) and Escherichia coli demonstrated synergy between our synthetic antimicrobial polymer and two antibiotics, doxycycline and colistin. Coadministration of these compounds significantly improved the bacteriostatic efficacy especially against MDR P. aeruginosa strains PA32 and PA37, where the minimal inhibitory concentrations (MICs) of polymer and antibiotics were reduced by at least 4-fold. A synergistic killing activity was observed when the antimicrobial polymer was used in combination with doxycycline, killing >99.999% of planktonic and biofilm P. aeruginosa PAO1 upon a 20 min treatment at a polymer concentration of 128 μg mL-1 (4.6 μM) and doxycycline concentration of 64 μg mL-1 (133.1 μM). In addition, this synergistic combination reduced the rate of resistance development in P. aeruginosa compared to individual compounds and was also capable of reviving susceptibility to treatment in the resistant strains.",Collagen I Promotes Adipocytogenesis in Adipose-Derived Stem Cells In Vitro.,https://www.ncbi.nlm.nih.gov/pubmed/30939867,Cells,2019 06 10,"A hallmark of ageing is the redistribution of body fat. Particularly, subcutaneous fat decreases paralleled by a decrease of skin collagen I are typical for age-related skin atrophy. In this paper, we hypothesize that collagen I may be a relevant molecule stimulating the differentiation of adipose-derived stem cells (ASCs) into adipocytes augmenting subcutaneous fat. In this context lipogenesis, adiponectin, and collagen I receptor expression were determined. Freshly isolated ASCs were characterized by stemness-associated surface markers by FACS analysis and then transdifferentiated into adipocytes by specific medium supplements. Lipogenesis was evaluated using Nile Red staining and documented by fluorescence microscopy or quantitatively measured by using a multiwell spectrofluorometer. Expression of adiponectin was measured by real-time RT-PCR and in cell-free supernatants by ELISA, and expression of collagen I receptors was observed by western blot analysis. It was found that supports coated with collagen I promote cell adhesion and lipogenesis of ASCs. Interestingly, a reverse correlation to adiponectin expression was observed. Moreover, we found upregulation of the collagen receptor, discoidin domain-containing receptor 2; receptors of the integrin family were absent or downregulated. These findings indicate that collagen I is able to modulate lipogenesis and adiponectin expression and therefore may contribute to metabolic dysfunctions associated with ageing.",Determination of Hg in Farmed and Wild Atlantic Bluefin Tuna (Thunnus thynnus L.) Muscle.,https://www.ncbi.nlm.nih.gov/pubmed/30939866,"Molecules (Basel, Switzerland)",2019 05 01,"Mercury (Hg) is a well-known toxic element, diffused in the environment, especially in the Mediterranean Sea which is rich in cinnabar deposits. Mercury bioaccumulation in fish is of great concern, especially for top-level aquatic predators (e.g., shark, tuna, swordfish) and above all for species of large human consumption and high nutritional value. This work aimed to determine Hg concentrations in farmed and wild Atlantic Bluefin tuna (Thunnus thynnus) caught in the Mediterranean area in order to evaluate the level of Hg bioaccumulation. selenium (Se) content was also determined, since this element is an antagonist of mercury toxicity. Mercury and Se were analysed by atomic absorption spectrometry after microwave digestion of the samples. Hg content in farmed tuna was below the legal limit (1 mg/kg, wet weight, w.w.) for all specimens (0.6 ± 0.2 mg/kg), whereas the wild ones had a content over the limit (1.7 ± 0.6 mg/kg); Se concentration was higher in farmed specimens (1.1 ± 0.9 mg/kg) compared to wild ones (0.6 ± 0.3 mg/kg). A safe seafood could show a Se/Hg ratio >1 and a health benefit value (HBVSe) > 0: farmed tuna had higher values than the wild specimens (Se/Hg 5.48 vs. 1.32; HBVSe 11.16 vs. 0.29). These results demonstrate that for Hg, there is a better risk/benefit ratio in farmed T. thynnus. making it safer than wild tuna."

While the PCK rat has long been used as a model of fibropolycystic kidney disease, hepatobiliary biophysics in this animal model is incompletely characterized. Compared to age-matched, wild-type controls, the PCK rat demonstrated severe hepatomegaly and large saccular dilated intrahepatic ducts. Nevertheless, hepatic density was greater in the PCK rat, likely due to severe duct wall sclerosis accompanied by scarring across the hepatic parenchyma. Extracellular matrix accumulation appeared proportional to duct cross-sectional area and liver volume and appeared compensatory in nature. The PCK rat livers exhibited both cholangiocarcinoma and hepatocellular carcinoma coincident with areas of increased extracellular matrix deposition. Together, these data suggest that the PCK rat model mimics at least in part the spectrum of hepatobiliary pathology observed in Caroli syndrome and highlights the attendant risk associated with this disease.","Fridamycin A, a Microbial Natural Product, Stimulates Glucose Uptake without Inducing Adipogenesis.",https://www.ncbi.nlm.nih.gov/pubmed/30939853,Nutrients,2019 06 10,"Type 2 diabetes is a complex, heterogeneous, and polygenic disease. Currently, available drugs for treating type 2 diabetes predominantly include sulfonylureas, α-glucosidase inhibitors, and biguanides. However, long-term treatment with these therapeutic drugs is often accompanied by undesirable side effects, which have driven interest in the development of more effective and safer antidiabetic agents. To address the urgent need for new chemical solutions, we focused on the analysis of structurally novel and/or biologically new metabolites produced by insect-associated microbes as they have recently been recognized as a rich source of natural products. Comparative LC/MS-based analysis of Actinomadura sp. RB99, isolated from a fungus-growing termite, led to the identification of the type II polyketide synthase-derived fridamycin A. The structure of fridamycin A was confirmed by ¹H NMR data and LC/MS analysis. The natural microbial product, fridamycin A, was examined for its antidiabetic properties in 3T3-L1 adipocytes, which demonstrated that fridamycin A induced glucose uptake in 3T3-L1 cells by activating the AMP-activated protein kinase (AMPK) signaling pathway but did not affect adipocyte differentiation, suggesting that the glucose uptake took place through activation of the AMPK signaling pathway without inducing adipogenesis. Our results suggest that fridamycin A has potential to induce fewer side effects such as weight gain compared to rosiglitazone, a commonly used antidiabetic drug, and that fridamycin A could be a novel potential therapeutic candidate for the management of type 2 diabetes.",Blackcurrant Extract with Phytoestrogen Activity Alleviates Hair Loss in Ovariectomized Rats.,https://www.ncbi.nlm.nih.gov/pubmed/30939852,"Molecules (Basel, Switzerland)",2019 05 01,"Ancocyanin-rich blackcurrant extract (BCE) has phytoestrogen activity; however, its effect on hair follicles is unknown. Additionally, hair loss is known to occur during menopause in women owing to decreased estrogen secretion. This study examined whether BCE alleviated female pattern hair loss using a rat model. RNA was extracted and analyzed using a microarray and ingenuity pathway analysis. A quantitative polymerase chain reaction revealed that 1 μg/mL BCE altered many genes downstream of beta-estradiol in human hair dermal papilla cells. Additionally, the expression of the hair follicle stem cell marker keratin 19 was greatly enhanced. In a menopause model, ovariectomized rats were fed a diet containing 3% BCE for three months. An analysis of the number of hair shafts revealed that BCE increased the number of hairs by 0.5 hairs/follicular unit. Moreover, immunostaining revealed that the expression of Ki67 also increased by 19%. Furthermore, fluorescent immunostaining showed that the expression of other stem cell markers, including keratin 15, CD34, and keratin 19, was induced in rat hair follicular cells. In conclusion, these findings suggest that BCE has phytoestrogen activity in hair follicles and contributes to the alleviation of hair loss in a menopausal model in rats.",Intravenous Paracetamol in Adjunct to Intravenous Ketoprofen for Postoperative Pain in Children Undergoing General Surgery: A Double-Blinded Randomized Study.,https://www.ncbi.nlm.nih.gov/pubmed/30939851,"Medicina (Kaunas, Lithuania)",2019 06 10,"Background and objectives: The combination of non-steroidal anti-inflammatory drugs and paracetamol is widely used for pediatric postoperative pain management, although the evidence of superiority of a combination over either drug alone is insufficient. We aimed to find out if intravenous (i.v.) paracetamol in a dose of 60 mg kg-1 24 h-¹, given in addition to i.v. ketoprofen (4.5 mg kg-1 24 h-¹), improves analgesia, physical recovery, and satisfaction with postoperative well-being in children and adolescents following moderate and major general surgery. Materials and Methods: Fifty-four patients were randomized to receive either i.v. paracetamol or normal saline as a placebo in adjunct to i.v. ketoprofen. For rescue analgesia in patients after moderate surgery, i.v. tramadol (2 mg kg-¹ up two doses in 24 h), and for children after major surgery, i.v. morphine-patient-controlled analgesia (PCA) were available. The main outcome measure was the amount of opioid consumed during the first 24 h after surgery. Pain level at 1 and over 24 h, time until the resumption of normal oral fluid intake, spontaneous urination after surgery, and satisfaction with postoperative well-being were also assessed. Results: Fifty-one patients (26 in the placebo group and 25 in the paracetamol group) were studied. There was no difference in required rescue tramadol doses (n = 11 in each group) or 24-h morphine consumption (mean difference (95% CI): 0.06 (⁻0.17; 0.29) or pain scores between placebo and paracetamol groups. In patients given morphine-PCA, time to normal fluid intake was faster in the paracetamol than the placebo subgroup: median difference (95% CI): 7.5 (1.3; 13.7) h, p = 0.02. Parental satisfaction score was higher in the paracetamol than the placebo group (mean difference: ⁻1.3 (⁻2.5; ⁻0.06), p = 0.04). Conclusions: There were no obvious benefits to opioid requirement or analgesia of adding regular intravenous paracetamol to intravenous ketoprofen in used doses. However, intravenous paracetamol may contribute to faster recovery of normal functions and higher satisfaction with postoperative well-being.",Influence of Boron Additions and Heat Treatments on the Fatigue Resistance of CoCrMo Alloys.,https://www.ncbi.nlm.nih.gov/pubmed/30939850,"Materials (Basel, Switzerland)",2019 04 30,"Cobalt-based alloys are widely used in the manufacture of joint prostheses. In this study, the effect of boron additions and heat treatment on the ASTM F75 was evaluated by rotating bending fatigue. The boron ranged from 0.06⁻1 wt %. The alloys were tested in as-cast and heat-treated conditions. In the as-cast condition, the infinite life was observed at 380 MPa, improving to 433⁻615 MPa according to the amount of boron added. In the heat treatment condition, the fatigue resistance was improved only in the base alloy. The addition of 0.06 wt % boron and heat treatment led to the same resistance as in the as-cast condition. Adding large amounts of boron combined with heat treatment diminished the fatigue limit. The fracture analysis revealed primarily brittle behaviour with some ductile features even on the same sample; only the heat-treated alloy with 0.06 wt % boron was clearly ductile. This alloy also exhibited notably better toughness to crack propagation.",Bending Properties of Zigzag-Shaped 3D Woven Spacer Composites: Experiment and FEM Simulation.,https://www.ncbi.nlm.nih.gov/pubmed/30939849,"Materials (Basel, Switzerland)",2019 04 30,"Conventionally laminated spacer composites are extensively applied in many fields owing to their light weight. However, their impact resistance, interlaminar strength, and integrity are poor. In order to overcome these flaws, the zigzag-shaped 3D woven spacer composites were rationally designed. The zigzag-shaped 3D woven spacer fabrics with the basalt fiber filaments tows 400 tex (metric count of yarn) used as warp and weft yarns were fabricated on a common loom with low-cost processing. The zigzag-shaped 3D woven spacer composites were obtained using the VARTM (vacuum-assisted resin transfer molding) process. The three-point bending deformation and effects of damage in zigzag-shaped 3D woven spacer composites were studied both in experiment and using the finite element method (FEM). The bending properties of zigzag-shaped 3D woven spacer composites with different direction, different numbers of weaving cycle, and different heights were tested in experiments. In FEM simulation, the geometrical model was established to analyze the deformation and damage based on the 3D woven composite structure. Compared with data obtained from the experiments and FEM simulation, the results show good agreement and also prove the validity of the model. Based on the FEM results, the deformation, damage, and propagation of stress obtained from the model are very helpful in analyzing the failure mechanism of zigzag-shaped 3D woven composites. Furthermore, the results can significantly guide the fabrication process of real composite materials.",Citizens' Juries: When Older Adults Deliberate on the Benefits and Risks of Smart Health and Smart Homes.,https://www.ncbi.nlm.nih.gov/pubmed/30939848,"Healthcare (Basel, Switzerland)",2019 04 03,":Background: Technology-enabled healthcare or smart health has provided a wealth of products and services to enable older people to monitor and manage their own health conditions at home, thereby maintaining independence, whilst also reducing healthcare costs. However, despite the growing ubiquity of smart health, innovations are often technically driven, and the older user does not often have input into design. The purpose of the current study was to facilitate a debate about the positive and negative perceptions and attitudes towards digital health technologies. Methods: We conducted citizens' juries to enable a deliberative inquiry into the benefits and risks of smart health technologies and systems. Transcriptions of group discussions were interpreted from a perspective of life-worlds versus systems-worlds. Results: Twenty-three participants of diverse demographics contributed to the debate. Views of older people were felt to be frequently ignored by organisations implementing systems and technologies. Participants demonstrated diverse levels of digital literacy and a range of concerns about misuse of technology. Conclusion: Our interpretation contrasted the life-world of experiences, hopes, and fears with the systems-world of surveillance, efficiencies, and risks. This interpretation offers new perspectives on involving older people in co-design and governance of smart health and smart homes.",Pharmacogenetics in the Treatment of Cardiovascular Diseases and Its Current Progress Regarding Implementation in the Clinical Routine.,https://www.ncbi.nlm.nih.gov/pubmed/30939847,Genes,2019 06 10,"There is a special interest in the implementation of pharmacogenetics in clinical practice, although there are some barriers that are preventing this integration.

Despite the existence of drugs which efficiently suppress viral replication, treatment is usually life-long and finite therapies that cure HBV infection are urgently required. However, even if such therapies were available today, it is unlikely they would reach all of those who need it most, due to chronic hepatitis B (CHB) being largely undiagnosed across the globe and to the dire need for health systems promoting access to therapy. Considerable challenges to developing and implementing an effective HBV cure remain. Nonetheless, important advances towards a cure are being made, both in the development of a multitude of new therapeutic agents currently undergoing clinical trials, and through the establishment of a new global initiative dedicated to an HBV cure, ICE-HBV, that is working together with existing organisations to fast-track an HBV cure available to all."

We have developed a therapeutic drug, akebia saponin D (ASD), and determined its anti-hyperlipidemia activity and the potential mechanism(s) of action by analyzing the metabolome and intestinal microbiota. Male Sprague-Dawley rats were fed a high fat diet to induce hyperlipidemia, and then given ASD orally for 8 weeks. Lipid levels in serum were determined biochemically. Metabolites in serum, urine and feces were analyzed by UPLC-Q/TOF-MS, and the structure of the intestinal microbiota was determined by 16S rRNA sequencing. The ASD treatment significantly decreased the levels of TC, TG and LDL-c and increased the serum level of HDL-c. Metabolomics analysis indicated that the ASD treatment mainly impacted seven differential metabolites in the serum, sixteen differential metabolites in the urine and four differential metabolites in feces compared to the model group. The ASD treatment significantly changed eight bacteria at the genus level compared to the model group. In conclusion, ASD treatment can significantly alleviate HFD-induced hyperlipidemia and the hypolipidemic effect of ASD treatment is certainly associated with a systematic change in the metabolism, as well as dynamic changes in the structure of the intestinal microbiota.",Do Protected Areas Contribute to Health and Well-Being?

Studies that survey individuals on the perceived capacity of PAs to provide health benefits are very limited. However, the importance of PAs for societal health could emphasize the necessity to preserve them. In addition, studies of cross-country comparisons of nature-based activities show strong cultural differences with regard to the importance of wild nature and landscape preferences. Cross-country comparisons of the perception of PAs as a resource for personal well-being and health are lacking. An extensive survey with face-to-face questionnaires was conducted in PAs in Poland, Austria, and Italy with an overall sample size of 1390 people. It examined both emotional and physical personal well-being in the context of a stay in a PA. In general, the results showed that between the three countries, different perceptions of the capacity of PAs to contribute to personal health and well-being exist.

In this study, we reported two virulent P. aeruginosa phages, vB_PaeM_SCUT-S1 (S1) and vB_PaeM_SCUT-S2 (S2), which were characterized at morphological, genomic, and proteomic levels. Phages S1 and S2 were assigned to the Myoviridae family. The genome sequencing showed that the genome size of Phage S1 was 66,046 bp and that of Phage S2 was 94,434 bp. The phylogenetic tree indicated that the two phages were distantly related to each other and were classified in the genera Pbunavirus and Pakpunavirus respectively. Thirty-one proteins were identified for each phage by mass spectrometry and were used to substantiate the function of the predicted coding genes. The two phages inhibited the growth of P. aeruginosa strain PAO1 at low multiplicity of infection levels and had good performance both on preventing biofilm formation and eradicating preformed biofilms.

The effects of the silica-particle layer formed on the top surface of the silica support and the physical properties of the silica particles themselves on the membrane-formation process were investigated. The silica particles coated served as the additional silica source for growing the silicalite-1 seed crystal layer into the silicalite-1 membrane. As a result, it was possible to form a dense and continuous membrane even under gel-free conditions. Furthermore, it was found that the properties of the silica particles, such as their primary particle diameter, had a determining effect on their solubility during the steam treatment, that is, on the supply rate of the silica source. The silicalite-1 membrane obtained using the spherical-silica-particle-coated support had an approximately 9-μm-thick separation layer and showed very high pervaporation performance, exhibiting a separation factor of 105 and a flux of 3.72 kg m-2 h-1 for a 10 wt % ethanol/water mixture at 323 K. Thus, the gel-free SAC method can be used with a silica support coated with silica particles to readily prepare high-performance membranes without producing any chemical waste.",The Importance of Inhaler Adherence to Prevent COPD Exacerbations.,https://www.ncbi.nlm.nih.gov/pubmed/30939829,"Medical sciences (Basel, Switzerland)",2019 06 10,"It has been shown that the better outcomes of chronic obstructive pulmonary disease (COPD) are closely associated with adherence to drug therapy, independent of the treatment administered. The clinical trial Towards a Revolution in COPD Health (TORCH) study clearly showed in a three year follow up that patients with good adherence to their inhaler treatment presented a longer time before the first exacerbation, a lower susceptibility to exacerbation and lower all-cause mortality. The Latin American Study of 24-hour Symptoms in Chronic Obstructive Pulmonary Disease (LASSYC), a real-life study, evaluated the self-reported inhaler adherence in COPD patients in seven countries in a cross-sectional non-interventional study and found that approximately 50% of the patients had good adherence, 30% moderate adherence and 20% poor adherence. Adherence to inhaler may be evaluated by the specific inhaler adherence questionnaire, the Test of Adherence to Inhalers (TAI). Several factors may predict the incorrect use of inhalers or adherence in COPD outpatient, including the number of devices and the daily dosing frequency. Ideally, patient education, simplicity of the device operation, the use of just one device for multiple medications and the best adaptation of the patient to the inhaler should guide the physician in prescribing the device.",Comparative Transcriptome Analysis of Ampelopsis megalophylla for Identifying Genes Involved in Flavonoid Biosynthesis and Accumulation during Different Seasons.,https://www.ncbi.nlm.nih.gov/pubmed/30939828,"Molecules (Basel, Switzerland)",2019 05 01,"Ampelopsis megalophylla is an important species used in Chinese folk medicine. Flavonoids, the most important active components of plants, greatly determine the quality of A. megalophylla. However, biosynthesis of flavonoids at the molecular and genetic levels in A. megalophylla is not well understood. In this study, we performed chemical analysis and transcriptome analysis of A. megalophylla in different seasons (i.e., May, August, and October). Accumulation of flavonoids was higher in May than in the other two months. Genes involved in the flavonoid biosynthesis pathway, such as chalcone synthase, anthocyanidin synthase, flavanone 3-hydroxylase, flavonoid-3',5'-hydroxylase, caffeoyl-CoA O-methyltransferase, dihydroflavonol 4-reductase, 4-coumarate-CoA ligase, phenylalanine ammonia-lyase, cinnamate 4-hydroxylase, flavonoid 3'-monooxygenase, shikimate O-hydroxycinnamoyltransferase, and leucoanthocyanidin reductase, were identified based on transcriptome data. Fifty ATP binding cassette (ABC) transporter, nine SNARE, forty-nine GST, and eighty-four glycosyltransferases unigenes related to flavonoid transport and biomodification were also found. Moreover, seventy-eight cytochrome P450s and multiple transcription factors (five MYB, two bHLH, and three WD40 family genes) may be associated with the regulation of the flavonoid biosynthesis process. These results provide insights into the molecular processes of flavonoid biosynthesis in A. megalophylla and offer a significant resource for the application of genetic engineering in developing varieties with improved quality.",Detection and classification of Root and Butt-Rot (RBR) in Stumps of Norway Spruce Using RGB Images and Machine Learning.,https://www.ncbi.nlm.nih.gov/pubmed/30939827,"Sensors (Basel, Switzerland)",2019 04 30,"Root and butt-rot (RBR) has a significant impact on both the material and economic outcome of timber harvesting, and therewith on the individual forest owner and collectively on the forest and wood processing industries. An accurate recording of the presence of RBR during timber harvesting would enable a mapping of the location and extent of the problem, providing a basis for evaluating spread in a climate anticipated to enhance pathogenic growth in the future. Therefore, a system to automatically identify and detect the presence of RBR would constitute an important contribution to addressing the problem without increasing workload complexity for the machine operator. In this study, we developed and evaluated an approach based on RGB images to automatically detect tree stumps and classify them as to the absence or presence of rot. Furthermore, since knowledge of the extent of RBR is valuable in categorizing logs, we also classify stumps into three classes of infestation; rot = 0%, 0% < rot < 50% and rot ≥ 50%. In this work we used deep-learning approaches and conventional machine-learning algorithms for detection and classification tasks. The results showed that tree stumps were detected with precision rate of 95% and recall of 80%. Using only the correct output (TP) of the stump detector, stumps without and with RBR were correctly classified with accuracy of 83.5% and 77.5%, respectively. Classifying rot into three classes resulted in 79.4%, 72.4%, and 74.1% accuracy for stumps with rot = 0%, 0% < rot < 50%, and rot ≥ 50%, respectively. With some modifications, the developed algorithm could be used either during the harvesting operation to detect RBR regions on the tree stumps or as an RBR detector for post-harvest assessment of tree stumps and logs.",The Effect of Elevated Curing Temperatures on High Ye'elimite Calcium Sulfoaluminate Cement Mortars.,https://www.ncbi.nlm.nih.gov/pubmed/30939826,"Materials (Basel, Switzerland)",2019 04 30,"This study investigated the material properties and hydration characteristics of calcium sulfoaluminate cement (CSA) based mortars cured under 3 different initial curing temperatures. Two CSA cements with different M-values were selected. Obtained experimental results of mechanical properties, dimensional stability, and heat release were explained by hydration characteristics from X-ray diffraction, thermal gravimetric analysis, porosimetry, and thermodynamic modeling. Decomposition of ettringite decreased compressive strength but re-formation of ettringite after additional curing at 30 °C helped to recover the strength in CSA cement with a high amount of calcium sulfate. CSA cement with a low amount of calcium sulfate which was designed to predominantly have monosulfate as the main hydration product, showed increased 1-day strength after higher temperature curing but this occurred was at the expense of decreased 28-day strength.",Regional Disparities in the Association between Cereal Consumption and Metabolic Syndrome: Results from the China Health and Nutrition Survey.,https://www.ncbi.nlm.nih.gov/pubmed/30939825,Nutrients,2019 06 10,"This study examines regional disparities in the association between cereal consumption and metabolic syndrome (MetS) among Chinese adults. We used data from the longitudinal China Health and Nutrition Survey (CHNS) for 2892 healthy adults aged 18⁻75 years (1088 in northern China, 1804 in southern China) who had no non-communicable chronic diseases or MetS at the initial visit in 2009 and the follow-up in 2015. We used a 74-item food frequency questionnaire (FFQ) to assess the dietary intake. We defined MetS according to the International Diabetes Federation (IDF) criteria. Multiple logistic regressions stratified by region were performed to estimate the association between cereal consumption and the risk of MetS, and the quantile regression analyzed the relationship between cereal consumption and individual components of MetS in 2015. The rice consumption in southern China (9.00 kg/month) was more than twice that in northern China (3.60 kg/month). Consumption of wheat and wheat products in northern China (4.20 kg/month) was more than twice that in southern China (1.50 kg/month). After we adjusted for potential confounders, rice consumption was inversely associated with a risk of MetS 0.709 (95% CI: 0.458⁻1.003), the intake of wheat and wheat products was positively associated with a risk of MetS 1.925 (95% CI: 1.292⁻2.867) in southern China. We found no association between the intake of cereal and the prevalence of MetS in northern China. The quantile regression showed that various cereals were differentially associated with the components of MetS. The association between cereal consumption and the risk of MetS, and the components of MetS varied across these two regions of China."

However, the heterotypic interactions of neurovascular units, composed of neurons, pericytes (i.e., the tissue resident mesenchymal stromal cells), astrocytes, and brain microvascular endothelial cells, in brain-like tissues are less investigated. In addition, most cortical organoids lack a microglia component, the resident immune cells in the brain. Impairment of the blood-brain barrier caused by improper crosstalk between neural cells and vascular cells is associated with many neurodegenerative disorders. Mesenchymal stem cells (MSCs), with a phenotype overlapping with pericytes, have promotion effects on neurogenesis and angiogenesis, which are mainly attributed to secreted growth factors and extracellular matrices. As the innate macrophages of the central nervous system, microglia regulate neuronal activities and promote neuronal differentiation by secreting neurotrophic factors and pro-/anti-inflammatory molecules. Neuronal-microglia interactions mediated by chemokines signaling can be modulated in vitro for recapitulating microglial activities during neurodegenerative disease progression. In this review, we discussed the cellular interactions and the physiological roles of neural cells with other cell types including endothelial cells and microglia based on iPSC models. The therapeutic roles of MSCs in treating neural degeneration and pathological roles of microglia in neurodegenerative disease progression were also discussed.",A Grey Wolf Optimization-based Track-Before-Detect Method for Maneuvering Extended Target Detection and Tracking.,https://www.ncbi.nlm.nih.gov/pubmed/30939813,"Sensors (Basel, Switzerland)",2019 04 30,"A grey wolf optimization-based track-before-detect (GWO-TBD) method is developed for extended target detection and tracking. The aim of the GWO-TBD is tracking weak and maneuvering extended targets in a cluttered environment using the measurement points of an air surveillance radar. The optimal solution is the trajectory constituted by the points of an extended target. At the beginning of the GWO-TBD, the measurements of each scan are clustered into alternative sets. Secondly, closely sets are associated for tracklets. Each tracklet equals a candidate solution. Thirdly, the tracklets are further associated iteratively to find a better solution. An improved GWO algorithm is developed in the iteration for removal of unappreciated solution and acceleration of convergence. After the iteration of several generations, the optimal solution can be achieved, i.e. trajectory of an extended target. Both the real data and synthetic data are performed with the GWO-TBD and several existing algorithms in this work. Result infers that the GWO-TBD is superior to the others in detecting and tracking maneuvering targets. Meanwhile, much less prior information is necessary in the GWO-TBD. It makes the approach is engineering friendly.","Reduction of Preneoplastic Lesions Induced by 1,2-Dimethylhydrazine in Rat Colon by Maslinic Acid, a Pentacyclic Triterpene from Olea europaea L.",https://www.ncbi.nlm.nih.gov/pubmed/30939812,"Molecules (Basel, Switzerland)",2019 05 01,"Maslinic acid triggers compelling antiproliferative and pro-apoptotic effects in different human cancer cell lines. Hence, the chemopreventive activity was investigated on early stages of carcinogenesis induced by 1,2-dimethylhydrazine (DMH) which is a model that mimics human sporadic colorectal cancer. Male Sprague-Dawley rats were orally administered either maslinic acid at 5, 10 or 25 mg/kg dissolved in (2-hydroxypropyl)-β-cyclodextrin 20% (w/v) or the solvent for 49 days. After one week of treatment, animals received three weekly intraperitoneal injections of DMH at the dose of 20 mg/kg. Maslinic acid reduced the preneoplastic biomarkers, aberrant crypt foci (ACF) and mucin-depleted foci (MDF), already at 5 mg/kg in a 15% and 27%, respectively. The decline was significant at 25 mg/kg with decreases of 33% and 51%, respectively. Correlation analysis showed a significant association between the concentrations of maslinic acid found in the colon and the reduction of ACF (r = 0.999, P = 0.019) and MDF (r = 0.997, P = 0.049). The present findings demonstrate that maslinic acid induced an inhibition of the initiation stages of carcinogenesis. The assessment of this pentacyclic triterpene at the colon sheds light for designing diets with foods rich in maslinic acid to exert a chemopreventive activity in colorectal cancer.",New Insights into Leaf Physiological Responses to Ozone for Use in Crop Modelling.,https://www.ncbi.nlm.nih.gov/pubmed/30939811,"Plants (Basel, Switzerland)",2019 06 10,"Estimating food production under future air pollution and climate conditions in scenario analysis depends on accurately modelling ozone (O₃) effects on yield. This study tests several assumptions that form part of published approaches for modelling O₃ effects on photosynthesis and leaf duration against experimental data. In 2015 and 2016, two wheat cultivars were exposed in eight hemispherical glasshouses to O₃ ranging from 22 to 57 ppb (24 h mean), with profiles ranging from raised background to high peak treatments. The stomatal O₃ flux (Phytotoxic Ozone Dose, POD) to leaves was simulated using a multiplicative stomatal conductance model. Leaf senescence occurred earlier as average POD increased according to a linear relationship, and the two cultivars showed very different senescence responses. Negative effects of O₃ on photosynthesis were only observed alongside O₃-induced leaf senescence, suggesting that O₃ does not impair photosynthesis in un-senesced flag leaves at the realistic O₃ concentrations applied here. Accelerated senescence is therefore likely to be the dominant O₃ effect influencing yield in most agricultural environments. POD was better than 24 h mean concentration and AOT40 (accumulated O₃ exceeding 40 ppb, daylight hours) at predicting physiological response to O₃, and flux also accounted for the difference in exposure resulting from peak and high background treatments.",Structural Variations in LysM Domains of LysM-RLK PsK1 May Result in a Different Effect on Pea⁻Rhizobial Symbiosis Development.,https://www.ncbi.nlm.nih.gov/pubmed/30939810,International journal of molecular sciences,2019 04 30,"Lysin-motif receptor-like kinase PsK1 is involved in symbiosis initiation and the maintenance of infection thread (IT) growth and bacterial release in pea. We verified PsK1 specificity in relation to the Nod factor structure using k1 and rhizobial mutants. Inoculation with nodO and nodE nodO mutants significantly reduced root hair deformations, curling, and the number of ITs in k1-1 and k1-2 mutants. These results indicated that PsK1 function may depend on Nod factor structures. PsK1 with replacement in kinase domain and PsSYM10 co-production in Nicotiana benthamiana leaves did not induce a hypersensitive response (HR) because of the impossibility of signal transduction into the cell. Replacement of P169S in LysM3 domain of PsK1 disturbed the extracellular domain (ECD) interaction with PsSYM10's ECD in Y2H system and reduced HR during the co-production of full-length PsK1 and PsSYM0 in N. benthamiana. Lastly, we explored the role of PsK1 in symbiosis with arbuscular mycorrhizal (AM) fungi; no significant differences between wild-type plants and k1 mutants were found, suggesting a specific role of PsK1 in legume⁻rhizobial symbiosis. However, increased sensitivity to a highly aggressive Fusarium culmorum strain was found in k1 mutants compared with the wild type, which requires the further study of the role of PsK1 in immune response regulation.",Pregnant Inuit Women's Exposure to Metals and Association with Fetal Growth Outcomes: ACCEPT 2010⁻2015.,https://www.ncbi.nlm.nih.gov/pubmed/30939809,International journal of environmental research and public health,2019 05 29,"Environmental contaminants such as heavy metals are transported to the Arctic regions via atmospheric and ocean currents and enter the Arctic food web. Exposure is an important risk factor for health and can lead to increased risk of a variety of diseases. This study investigated the association between pregnant women's levels of heavy and essential metals and the birth outcomes of the newborn child. This cross-sectional study is part of the ACCEPT birth cohort (Adaption to Climate Change, Environmental Pollution, and dietary Transition) and included 509 pregnant Inuit women ≥18 years of age. Data were collected in five Greenlandic regions during 2010⁻2015. Population characteristics and birth outcomes were obtained from medical records and midwives, respectively, and blood samples were analyzed for 13 metals. Statistical analysis included one-way ANOVA, Spearman's rho, and multiple linear and logistic regression analyses. The proportion of current smokers was 35.8%. The levels of cadmium, chromium, and nickel were higher compared to reported normal ranges. Significant regional differences were observed for several metals, smoking, and parity. Cadmium and copper were significantly inversely related to birth outcomes. Heavy metals in maternal blood can adversely influence fetal development and growth in a dose⁻response relationship. Diet and lifestyle factors are important sources of toxic heavy metals and deviant levels of essential metals. The high frequency of smokers in early pregnancy is of concern, and prenatal exposure to heavy metals and other environmental contaminants in the Greenlandic Inuit needs further research.",Infectious Virions of Bombyx Mori Latent Virus Are Incorporated into Bombyx Mori Nucleopolyhedrovirus Occlusion Bodies.,https://www.ncbi.nlm.nih.gov/pubmed/30939808,Viruses,2019 06 10,"The Bombyx mori latent virus (BmLV) belongs to the unassigned plant virus family Tymoviridae and contains a positive-sense, single-stranded RNA genome.

Here, we examined the interaction between BmLV and the insect DNA virus Bombyx mori nucleopolyhedrovirus (BmNPV). Persistent infection with BmLV caused a slight delay in BmNPV propagation, and BmLV propagation was enhanced in B. mori larvae via co-infection with BmNPV.

Although there are numerous hippocampal modeling approaches, only a few span the wide functionalities ranging from processing raw sensory signals to planning and action generation. This paper presents a vision-based navigation system that involves generating place and HD cells through learning from visual images, building topological maps based on learned cell representations and performing navigation using hierarchical reinforcement learning. First, place and HD cells are trained from sequences of visual stimuli in an unsupervised learning fashion. A modified Slow Feature Analysis (SFA) algorithm is proposed to learn different cell types in an intentional way by restricting their learning to separate phases of the spatial exploration. Then, to extract the encoded metric information from these unsupervised learning representations, a self-organized learning algorithm is adopted to learn over the emerged cell activities and to generate topological maps that reveal the topology of the environment and information about a robot's head direction, respectively. This enables the robot to perform self-localization and orientation detection based on the generated maps. Finally, goal-directed navigation is performed using reinforcement learning in continuous state spaces which are represented by the population activities of place cells. In particular, considering that the topological map provides a natural hierarchical representation of the environment, hierarchical reinforcement learning (HRL) is used to exploit this hierarchy to accelerate learning. The HRL works on different spatial scales, where a high-level policy learns to select subgoals and a low-level policy learns over primitive actions to specialize on the selected subgoals. Experimental results demonstrate that our system is able to navigate a robot to the desired position effectively, and the HRL shows a much better learning performance than the standard RL in solving our navigation tasks.",Kidney Lipidomics by Mass Spectrometry Imaging: A Focus on the Glomerulus.,https://www.ncbi.nlm.nih.gov/pubmed/30939806,International journal of molecular sciences,2019 04 30,"Lipid disorders have been associated with glomerulopathies, a distinct type of renal pathologies, such as nephrotic syndrome.

Scanning electron microscopy was used to characterize the electrospun nanofibers, and controlled release studies were performed at pH 6.5 and 7.4 in saline buffer, suggesting that the release of polyphenols from xanthan nanofibers follows a non-Fickian mechanism. Furthermore, the X-GA and X-EGCG nanofibers were incubated with Caco-2 cells, and the cell viability, transepithelial transport, and permeability properties across cell monolayers were investigated. An increase of GA and EGCG permeability was observed when the polyphenols were loaded into xanthan nanofibers, compared to the free compounds. The observed in vitro permeability enhancement of GA and EGCG was induced by the presence of the polysaccharide nanofibers, which successfully inhibited efflux transporters, as well as by tight junctions opening."
