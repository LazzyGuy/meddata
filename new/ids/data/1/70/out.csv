Thirty-six male Sprague-Dawley rats were divided into 6 groups of six; 3 groups received a Vitamin D deficient diet whereas the other 3 received a Vitamin D adequate diet. Serum total 25-hydroxyvitamin D (25OHD), calcium, phosphorus, creatinine, Alkaline phosphatase (ALP), albumin, Parathyroid hormone (PTH), Osteocalcin and C terminal telopeptide (CTx) were measured following exposure to varying levels of fluoride in drinking water (< 1.0, 15 and 50 ppm). Full body Dual-energy X-ray Absorptiometry (DXA) scans were used to examine changes in bone morphology pre and post exposure to fluoride. Renal tubular function was assessed using serum creatinine and urine Cystatin C. Histopathological examination of sections of bone and kidney tissues were also performed. Prior to fluoride exposure, DXA scans revealed a significant decrease in Bone Mineral Density (BMD) and Bone Mineral content (BMC) (p < 0.05) but a significant increase in fat mass (p < 0.05) and fat percentage (p < 0.01) among Vitamin D deficient rats, with no significant change in biochemical parameters.

Serum creatinine calcium and phosphate and urinary cystatin C levels showed no significant changes. Light microscopy examination revealed mild thickening and increased osteoid in 80% of the Vitamin D deficient rats exposed to high levels of fluoride but renal tubular changes were found only in one experimental and one control animal. Fluoride deposited in rat bone affects both osteoblastic and osteoclastic activity. Also, these effects are accentuated in the presence of Vitamin D deficiency.",The Differential Influence of Immunological Process of Autoimmune Disease on Lipid Metabolism: A Study on RA and SLE.,https://www.ncbi.nlm.nih.gov/pubmed/30728673,Indian journal of clinical biochemistry : IJCB,2019 02 10,"Metabolic parameters like uric acid, lipids and homocysteine are influenced by immunopathological mechanisms underlying the autoimmune disease processes. The current study examined the differences in these parameters and the correlation between inflammatory and metabolic variables in rheumatoid arthritis (RA) and systemic lupus erythematosus (SLE) patients. The cross-sectional prospective study included 24 treatment-naïve patients with moderate to severe diseases-15 subjects had RA and 9 had SLE. Atherogenic index of plasma (AIP) was used to assess the cardiovascular risk of the patients. Spearman's correlation was performed to verify the relationship between inflammatory and metabolic parameters. A two-tailed P < 0.05 was considered statistically significant for all the analysis. SLE patients had higher uric acid levels, very low density lipoprotein-cholesterol, total cholesterol/high density lipoprotein-cholesterol ratio (TC/HDL-C) and logarithmic ratio of triglycerides to HDL-cholesterol (log[TG/HDL-C]) than RA. Whereas, reduced total lymphocyte count, lipoprotein(a), and low density lipoprotein cholesterol were noted in the former than latter group. Majority of the SLE patients had increased risk of cardiovascular diseases (> 0.24 AIP score) and RA patients in comparison had lower risk. Correlation among serum uric acid, lipid profile constituents and AIP was noted. The immunological process of SLE has greater impact on the metabolic parameters. Higher uric acid levels are suggestive of dysfunctional lipid profile. Understanding the implications of risk factors and its inflammatory role in autoimmune processes may assist in disease management.","Anomalies in MiRNAs Machinery Gene, GEMIN-4 Variants Suggest Renal Cell Carcinoma Risk: A Small Experimental Study from North India.",https://www.ncbi.nlm.nih.gov/pubmed/30728672,Indian journal of clinical biochemistry : IJCB,2019 02 10,"GEMIN4 is a member of the GEMIN gene family which is involved in multiple pathologies including cancer. It is located on Chr17p13.3, the most notorious chromosome and a hotspot for various carcinomas. We therefore intend to find genetic variants of GEMIN4 gene associated with renal cell carcinoma risk (RCC). This study comprised 100 patients and 225 controls.

This study aimed to determine the best method for making single cell suspension for isolation of RNA and flow cytometer analysis from cancer tissue. We compared two methods of tissue disruption used during RNA isolation and flow cytometer analysis. Mechanical tissue disruption method and enzymatic tissue digestion method are commonly used for making single cell suspension before RNA isolation and flow cytometer analysis. 20 resected tissue samples were dissociated into single cells by mechanical and enzymatic methods. Quality and quantity of isolated miRNA was graded by the ratio of 260/280 nm and by running gels. The results revealed that mechanical hand held tissue homogenizer showed better yield than enzymatic (719.12 ± 513.67 vs. 524.87 ± 388.18 ng/µl) and the quality 260/280 nm ratio was significantly better [2.15 ± 0.21 vs. 1.57 ± 0.23; 95% CI (0.402-0.730); p < 0.001] in mechanical method than enzymatic.

The mechanical method is very suitable for isolating miRNA than enzymatic while enzymatic digestion is most favorable for flow-cytometer analysis as it reduces debris in comparison of mechanical process of shearing.",Interrelation of the Circulating and Tissue MicroRNA-21 with Tissue PDCD4 Expression and the Invasiveness of Iraqi Female Breast Tumors.,https://www.ncbi.nlm.nih.gov/pubmed/30728670,Indian journal of clinical biochemistry : IJCB,2019 02 10,"The changes in the translational repression and variation in mRNA degradation induced by micro RNA are important aspects of tumorigenesis. The association of microRNA-21 with clinicopathologic features and expression of programed cell death 4 (PDCD4) in Iraqi female's with breast tumors has not been studied. MicroRNAs were extracted from a set of 60 breast tumor tissues and blood samples of females with breast cancer and benign breast lesions obtained after breast-reductive surgery, and only blood samples from 30 normal volunteers. These extracts were evaluated for miR-21 expression by quantitative RT-PCR. Analysis of PDCD4 protein expression was carried out as miR-21 target gene by immunohistochemical tests and correlating the results with patients' clinicopathological features. Significant overexpression of miRNA-21 was found in breast cancer group. The fold increase in the miR-21 gene expression was significantly higher in circulating exosomes and breast tissues of breast cancer patients as compared to other groups (P < 0.001). Overexpression of miR-21 was also significantly associated with the advanced tumor stage and histological grade. In breast cancer patients, PDCD4 protein expression was decreased to about 70% of the level in the control group. The delta Ct of exosomal and breast tissue miRNA-21 was negatively associated with PDCD4 expression. In conclusion, the translational repression of the PDCD4 induced by the high expression of miR-21 promotes breast cell transformation and development of breast tumor, and circulating miR-21 level could be applied to the screening panels for early detection of women breast cancer.",Gene Editing in Clinical Practice: Where are We?,https://www.ncbi.nlm.nih.gov/pubmed/30728669,Indian journal of clinical biochemistry : IJCB,2019 02 10,"Multitude of gene-altering capabilities in combination with ease of design and low cost have all led to the adoption of the sophisticated and yet simple gene editing system that are clustered regularly interspaced short palindromic repeats (CRISPR)-associated protein 9 (CRISPR). The CRISPR/Cas9 system holds promise for the correction of deleterious mutations by taking advantage of the homology directed repair pathway and by supplying a correction template to the affected patient's cells. CRISPR is a tool that allows researchers to edit genes very precisely, easily and quickly. It does this by harnessing a mechanism that already existed in bacteria. Basically, there's a protein that acts like a scissors and cuts the DNA, and there's an RNA molecule that directs the scissors to any point on the genome one wants which results basically a word processor for genes. An entire gene can be taken out, put one in, or even edit just a single letter within a gene. Several platforms for molecular scissors that enable targeted genome engineering have been developed, including zinc-finger nucleases, transcription activator-like effector nucleases and, most recently, CRISPR/CRISPR-associated-9 (Cas9). The CRISPR/Cas9 system's simplicity, facile engineering and amenability to multiplexing make it the system of choice for many applications. CRISPR/Cas9 has been used to generate disease models to study genetic diseases. Improvements are urgently needed for various aspects of the CRISPR/Cas9 system, including the system's precision, delivery and control over the outcome of the repair process. However, there are still some glitches to be mended like how to regulate gene drives and its safeguards. The creation of gene knockouts is one of the first and most widely used applications of the CRISPR-Cas9 system. Nuclease-active Cas9 creates a double-strand break at the single guide RNA-targeted locus. These breaks can be repaired by homologous recombination, which can be used to introduce new mutations. When the double-strand break is repaired by the error-prone nonhomologous end joining process, indels are introduced which can produce frame shifts and stop codons, leading to functional knockout of the gene. Precedence modification have to be done on mechanism of CRISPR/Cas9, including its biochemical and structural implications incorporating the latest improvements in the CRISPR/Cas9 system, especially Cas9 protein modifications for customization. Current applications, where the versatile CRISPR/Cas9 system is to be used to edit the genome, epigenome, or RNA of various organisms is debated. Although CRISPR/Cas9 allows convenient genome editing accompanied by many benefits, one should not ignore the significant ethical and biosafety concerns that it raises. Conclusively lot of prospective applications and challenges of several promising techniques adapted from CRISPR/Cas9. Is discussed. Although many mechanistic questions remain to be answered and several challenges to be addressed yet, the use of CRISPR-Cas9-based genome technologies will increase our knowledge of disease process and their treatment in near future. Undoubtedly this field is revolutionizing in current era and may open new vistas in the treatment of fatal genetic disease.",Single Cell Omics of Breast Cancer: An Update on Characterization and Diagnosis.,https://www.ncbi.nlm.nih.gov/pubmed/30728668,Indian journal of clinical biochemistry : IJCB,2019 02 10,"Breast cancer is recognized for its different clinical behaviors and patient outcomes, regardless of common histopathological features at diagnosis. The heterogeneity and dynamics of breast cancer undergoing clonal evolution produces cells with distinct degrees of drug resistance and metastatic potential. Presently, single cell analysis have made outstanding advancements, overshadowing the hurdles of heterogeneity linked with vast populations. The speedy progression in sequencing analysis now allow unbiased, high-output and high-resolution elucidation of the heterogeneity from individual cell within a population. Classical therapeutics strategies for individual patients are governed by the presence and absence of expression pattern of the estrogen and progesterone receptors and human epidermal growth factor receptor 2. However, such tactics for clinical classification have fruitfulness in selection of targeted therapies, short-term patient responses but unable to predict the long-term survival. In any phenotypic alterations, like breast cancer disease, molecular signature have proven its implication, as we aware that individual cell's state is regulated at diverse levels, such as DNA, RNA and protein, by multifaceted interplay of intrinsic biomolecules pathways existing in the organism and extrinsic stimuli such as ambient environment. Thus for complete understanding, complete profiling of single cell requires a synchronous investigations from different levels (multi-omics) to avoid incomplete information produced from single cell. In this article, initially we briefed on novel updates of various methods available to explore omics and then we finally pinpointed on various omics (i.e. genomics, transcriptomics, epigenomics, proteomics and metabolomics) data and few special aspects of circulating tumor cells, disseminated tumor cells and cancer stem cells, so far available from various studies that can be used for better management of breast cancer patients.",Long Chronic Total Occlusions: Revascularization Strategies.,https://www.ncbi.nlm.nih.gov/pubmed/30728663,Seminars in interventional radiology,2019 02 10,The treatment of chronic total occlusions (CTO) in patients with peripheral arterial disease (PAD) is a complex topic with multiple treatment techniques and treatment strategies.

In this review, we introduce audiologists to the Chronic Care Model, an organizational framework that describes best-practice clinical care for chronic conditions, and suggest that it may be a viable model for hearing health care to adopt. We further introduce the concept of chronic condition self-management, a key component of chronic care that refers to the knowledge and skills patients use to manage the effects of a chronic condition on all aspects of daily life. Drawing on the chronic condition evidence base, we demonstrate a link between the provision of effective self-management support and improved clinical outcomes and discuss validated methods with which clinicians can support the acquisition and application of self-management skills in their patients.

Furthermore, the MIC values of old-fashioned antibiotics such as erythromycin and oxytertacycline drastically reduced in combination with chitosan-phytochemical conjugates against the fish pathogenic bacteria. The combination of conjugates with erythromycin and oxytetracycline gave median ∑FIC results ranging from 0.281 to 0.625 and 0.312 to 0.625, respectively. This result indicates the synergistic antibacterial effects and an increased susceptibility against the antibiotics.",Evaluation of Probiotic Characteristics of Lactic Acid Bacteria Isolated from Two Commercial Preparations Available in Indian Market.,https://www.ncbi.nlm.nih.gov/pubmed/30728640,Indian journal of microbiology,2019 02 10,"The enormous health benefits associated with probiotics has resulted in an increased consumption of probiotic supplements. Several factors like regular sub-culturing, storage, unfavourable conditions etc. might compromise the efficacy and/or safety of lactic acid bacteria which are the major components of many probiotic preparations available in the market. The present study evaluated the probiotic characteristics and safety of probiotic bacteria isolated from two preparations available commercially in India. The products did not specify the genera, species or strains of the bacteria used. These were cultured using standard microbiological methods for cultivation of lactic acid bacteria. Bacteria were identified by PCR amplification and sequence analysis of 16S rRNA gene. Microbiological and molecular analyses revealed that both preparations contained homogenous population of Enterococcus faecium and Pediococcus acidilactici respectively. Assessment for several essential and desirable probiotic properties revealed that both the probiotic strains were safe and resistant to salt, lysozyme, bile salt and common antibiotics. The probiotic preparation containing P. acidilactici was better than that containing E. faecium as it survived in low pH and showed bile salt hydrolase activity. The probiotic preparation containing P. acidilactici also exhibited cholesterol-lowering activity.",Genome Engineering Approaches to Improve Nosokomycin A Production by Streptomyces ghanaensis B38.3.,https://www.ncbi.nlm.nih.gov/pubmed/30728639,Indian journal of microbiology,2019 02 10,"Here we describe our efforts to improve the levels of phosphoglycolipid antibiotic nosokomycin A production by Streptomyces ghanaensis ATCC14672 via genome engineering approaches.

Increased pollution in water bodies leads to eutrophication. However, algae growing in lakes undergoing eutrophication could be utilized towards the generation of added-value bio-electricity using microbial fuel cells (MFCs). In the present study, two methods of electricity generation using raw algae (RA) and RA + acetate (AC) as co-substrate were analyzed in single chamber air cathode MFCs. MFCs supplemented with RA and RA + AC clearly showed higher power density, greater current generation, and improved COD (chemical oxygen demand) removal, which demonstrated the feasibility of using AC as substrate for MFC. The MFC-RA + AC (0.48 mA) generated 28% higher current relative to that generated by MFC with RA alone. Notably, the maximum power densities generated by MFC-RA and MFC-RA + AC were 230 and 410 mW/m2, respectively. MFC-RA and MFC-RA + AC exhibited TCOD (total chemical oxygen reduction) removal values of 77% and 86.6%, respectively. Despite the high influent TCOD (758 mg/l) concentration, the MFC-RA + AC exhibited an 8.5% higher COD removal relative to that of MFC-RA (525 mg/l).

Skeels (Myretacae family) is a native plant of the Indian subcontinent which has wide socio-economical importance and is well known for its ant diabetic activity. The present study aimed to investigate the antibiofilm activity of purified fraction (EA) from S. cumini leaf extract against P. aeruginosa and S. aureus. The EA did not show any effect on growth of P. aeruginosa and S. aureus at the concentration of 900 µg/ml. At this concentration EA showed biofilm inhibition up to 86 ± 1.19% (***P < 0.0001) and 86.40 ± 1.19% (***P < 0.0001) in P. aeruginosa and S. aureus respectively. SEM examination also confirmed the reduction in biofilm formation. Further EA also disrupted some virulence phenotypes in P. aeruginosa and S. aureus. Bioactive compounds detected by GC-MS showed their possible molecular interaction with RhlG/NADP active-site complex (PDB ID: 2B4Q), LasR-TP4 complex (PDB ID: 3JPU) and Pseudaminidase (PDB ID: 2W38) from P. aeruginosa.

Several microbial diseases are associated with biofilms that pose challenges in treatment with antibiotics targeting individual cells. Bacteria in biofilms secrete exopolymeric substances that contribute to architectural stability and provide a secure niche to inhabiting cells. Quorum sensing (QS) plays essential roles in biofilm development. Pathogenic bacteria in biofilms utilize QS mechanisms to activate virulence and develop antibiotic resistance. This review is a brief overview of biofilm research and provides updates on recent understandings on biofilm development, antibiotic resistance and transmission, and importance of QS mechanisms. Strategies to combat biofilm associated diseases including anti-biofilm substances, quorum quenching molecules, bio-surfactants and competitive inhibitors are briefly discussed. The review concludes with updates on recent approaches utilized for biofilm inhibition and provides perspectives for further research in the field.","Development of a sweetened beverage tax, Philippines.",https://www.ncbi.nlm.nih.gov/pubmed/30728621,Bulletin of the World Health Organization,2019 06 14,Both sugar-sweetened beverage consumption and the incidence of obesity have increased in the Philippines in recent years.,"Integrating noncommunicable disease services into primary health care, Botswana.",https://www.ncbi.nlm.nih.gov/pubmed/30728620,Bulletin of the World Health Organization,2019 06 14,"Despite the rising burden of noncommunicable diseases, access to quality decentralized noncommunicable disease services remain limited in many low- and middle-income countries. Here we describe the strategies we employed to drive the process from adaptation to national endorsement and implementation of the 2016 Botswana primary healthcare guidelines for adults. The strategies included detailed multilevel assessment with broad stakeholder inputs and in-depth analysis of local data; leveraging academic partnerships; facilitating development of supporting policy instruments; and embedding noncommunicable disease guidelines within broader primary health-care guidelines in keeping with the health ministry strategic direction. At facility level, strategies included developing a multimethod training programme for health-care providers, leveraging on the experience of provision of human immunodeficiency virus care and engaging health-care implementers early in the process. Through the strategies employed, the country's first national primary health-care guidelines were endorsed in 2016 and a phased three-year implementation started in August 2017. In addition, provision of primary health-care delivery of noncommunicable disease services was included in the country's 11th national development plan (2017-2023). During the guideline development process, we learnt that strong interdisciplinary skills in communication, organization, coalition building and systems thinking, and technical grasp of best-practices in low- and middle-income countries were important. Furthermore, misaligned agendas of stakeholders, exaggerated by a siloed approach to guideline development, underestimation of the importance of having policy instruments in place and coordination of the processes initially being led outside the health ministry caused delays. Our experience is relevant to other countries interested in developing and implementing guidelines for evidence-based noncommunicable disease services.","Implementation of national action plans on noncommunicable diseases, Bhutan, Cambodia, Indonesia, Philippines, Sri Lanka, Thailand and Viet Nam.",https://www.ncbi.nlm.nih.gov/pubmed/30728619,Bulletin of the World Health Organization,2019 06 14,"By 2016, Member States of the World Health Organization (WHO) had developed and implemented national action plans on noncommunicable diseases in line with the Global action plan for the prevention and control of noncommunicable diseases (2013-2020). In 2018, we assessed the implementation status of the recommended best-buy noncommunicable diseases interventions in seven Asian countries: Bhutan, Cambodia, Indonesia, Philippines, Sri Lanka, Thailand and Viet Nam. We gathered data from a range of published reports and directly from health ministries. We included interventions that addressed the use of tobacco and alcohol, inadequate physical activity and high salt intake, as well as health-systems responses, and we identified gaps and proposed solutions. In 2018, progress was uneven across countries. Implementation gaps were largely due to inadequate funding; limited institutional capacity (despite designated noncommunicable diseases units); inadequate action across different sectors within and outside the health system; and a lack of standardized monitoring and evaluation mechanisms to inform policies. To address implementation gaps, governments need to invest more in effective interventions such as the WHO-recommended best-buy interventions, improve action across different sectors, and enhance capacity in monitoring and evaluation and in research. Learning from the Framework Convention on Tobacco Control, the WHO and international partners should develop a standardized, comprehensive monitoring tool on alcohol, salt and unhealthy food consumption, physical activity and health-systems response.",The palm oil industry and noncommunicable diseases.,https://www.ncbi.nlm.nih.gov/pubmed/30728618,Bulletin of the World Health Organization,2019 06 14,"Large-scale industries do not operate in isolation, but have tangible impacts on human and planetary health.

We applied the commercial determinants of health framework to analyse the palm oil industry. We highlight the industry's mutually profitable relationship with the processed food industry and its impact on human and planetary health, including detrimental cultivation practices that are linked to respiratory illnesses, deforestation, loss of biodiversity and pollution. This analysis illustrates many parallels to the contested nature of practices adopted by the alcohol and tobacco industries.

This paper identifies key areas of intersection between law and noncommunicable diseases, beginning with the role of law as a tool for implementing policies for prevention and control of leading risk factors. We identify actions that the World Health Organization and its partners could take to mobilize the legal workforce, strengthen legal capacity and support effective use of law at the national level. Legal and regulatory actions must move to the centre of national noncommunicable disease action plans.

PCA plots revealed important relationships between chemical composition and botanical origin for reference and commercial samples. Strong evidence of commercial Brazil nut oil adulteration was confirmed using a spiking procedure. Our findings show that NMR and chemometrics are successful tools for correlating fatty acid profile with botanical origin, which can be suitable for detecting sample adulteration.",Acceleration of Swiss cheese ripening by microbial lipase without affecting its quality characteristics.,https://www.ncbi.nlm.nih.gov/pubmed/30728594,Journal of food science and technology,2019 02 10,"The effect of exogenous microbial lipase enzyme on the ripening of Swiss cheese (0, 200, and 800U lipase in 30 L milk) was investigated for the physico-chemical, textural and sensory properties, along with its microstructure. The aim of this study was to investigate the application of microbial lipase to accelerate the ripening without affecting its original desirable quality characteristics. The effect of the microbial lipase was studied at different time periods (2, 30, 45, and 60 days) of the Swiss cheese ripening stages. Statistical analysis of the results showed that the physico-chemical parameters of cheese slightly increased during the ripening. Also, at all stages of the ripening hardness of Swiss cheese increased while the brittleness decreased. The number and size of the fat globules were also affected by the addition of the lipases. This study also showed that increase in the lipase amount had no significant change in quality and sensory parameters. Therefore, 200U of lipase was found to be sufficient to reduce the ripening time from 90 to 60 days by maintaining its genuine quality. Thus, this study suggested that the addition of microbial lipase may significantly reduce the cost of the cheese production by lowering the ripening period by 1 month and maintaining the quality of the final product.","Effect of drying procedures on nutritional composition, bioactive compounds and antioxidant activity of wheatgrass (Triticum aestivum L).",https://www.ncbi.nlm.nih.gov/pubmed/30728593,Journal of food science and technology,2019 02 10,"Fresh wheatgrass was dried using shade, oven and freeze drying methods.

In this study, kinetic behavior of lipid oxidation and depletion of the phenolic antioxidants in the black carrot juice supplemented almond pastes stored at the temperature range of 4-60 °C were studied. Kinetic models were employed to quantify the observations. Lipid oxidation was modeled with the logistic equation. Addition of black carrot juice delayed lipid oxidation, and decreased the maximum peroxide value attained. Being different than the results of the previous studies performed with the similar pastes, the rate constants of peroxide formation reactions in the black carrot juice supplemented pastes decreased with increasing temperature (from 0.60 to 0.27 d-1); possibly due to capturing of the lipid oxidation intermediaries by the antioxidants at higher rates at higher temperatures. Depletion of phenolics agreed with a unimolecular first order apparent kinetic model. At the end of the storage period, phenolic losses in the pastes were 5.4, 31.8, 36.9 and 38.2% at 4, 20, 30 and 60 °C, respectively. The results showed that incorporation of the black carrot juice might have an effect on the mechanism of the lipid oxidation and its temperature dependency, and improve the shelf life of the almond pastes.",Physicochemical and functional properties of ash gourd/bottle gourd beverages blended with jamun.,https://www.ncbi.nlm.nih.gov/pubmed/30728591,Journal of food science and technology,2019 02 10,"This paper reports the formulation and storage stability of Ash gourd (Benincasa hispida) and Bottle gourd (Lagenaria siceraria) juice blended with the Jamun (Syzygium cumini).

A systemic understanding of their effectiveness in controlling water loss and ensuring accuracy of rheological measurements is necessary. In this work, three kinds of coating oils (vaseline, dimethyl silicone oil and low viscosity silicone oil) were selected to minimize water evaporation from dough of 37%, 42% and 47% water content subjected to time sweep tests under oscillatory mode. Evolution patterns of the storage modulus, loss modulus and loss factor with time were followed, and the mechanisms responsible for the response patterns were decoupled. Disparate dynamic viscoelastic responses were found for the same dough coated with different oils. Spontaneous de-structuring of dough combined with thixotropic effect contributed to the decrease of dynamic modulus and increase of the loss factor with time. Dynamic vapor sorption tests showed that water evaporation did occur for the dough even coated with non-volatile oils including vaseline. Water evaporation led to an accelerated increase in dynamic modulus with time, while had a very limited impact on loss factor. Oil invasion only played a minor role in the decrease in dynamic modulus. The measured modulus was actually a sum of the positive and negative contributions. Vaseline was observed as an effective coating oil for rheological measurements of dough, especially with high water content.",Effects of replacing fat by betaglucans from Ganoderma lucidum on batter and cake properties.,https://www.ncbi.nlm.nih.gov/pubmed/30728589,Journal of food science and technology,2019 02 10,"The aim of this study was to investigate the effects of replacing vegetable fat at different concentrations (20, 30, 40 and 50%) by betaglucans from Ganoderma lucidum (βGGL), on the physical properties of cake batters, and on the quality of the resultant cakes. The addition of βGGL significantly affected the specific gravity, the flow properties and the color of the batter formulations. The fat-replacing led to a slight reduction in the volume of cakes, because fewer air bubbles were incorporated into the batter samples as the concentration of βGGL increased. The hardness of the cakes significantly increased during storage as the amount of βGGL increased. The fat-reduced cakes displayed similar color, moisture content, and water activity than the control cake samples. However, the crumb microstructure was affected by the addition of βGGL, as revealed by the scanning electron micrographs. The fat-reduced cakes containing 40% βGGL showed a general sensorial acceptance of 97%, as indicated by untrained panelists. These results suggest that βGGL could be used as fat replacers for improving the nutritional value of batter cakes.",Effect of monoglyceride content on emulsion stability and rheology of mayonnaise.,https://www.ncbi.nlm.nih.gov/pubmed/30728588,Journal of food science and technology,2019 02 10,"The aim of the study was to determine the effects of monoglyceride content on emulsion stability and rheology of mayonnaise. For this purpose, mono (MG) and diglycerides (DG) were produced by transesterification of refined olive oil with elevating glycerol contents from 25 to 100 g and reaction times from 25 to 40 min. Maximum MG-DG yield was obtained when the reaction was performed for 40 min using 75 or 100 g of glycerol. Under these conditions, 90% of triglycerides (TG) were converted to 40% MG and 50% DG. Using a molecular distillation unit, MG was separated from the transesterification reaction mixture and purified up to 98%. Emulsifiers were then prepared by introducing distilled MG into the transesterification reaction mixture in order to increase the MG concentration from 40 to 98%, for enabling the utilization of them in mayonnaise production. The mayonnaise incorporated with 98% MG showed the highest stability and reduction in the MG concentration in the emulsifier mixture decreased the emulsion stability. Rheological measurements indicated that the control sample without emulsifier had the highest viscosity and shear stress values. The increment of the MG concentration in the emulsifier mixtures resulted in only small differences on the rheological properties of mayonnaise."

Hicaznar were investigated. Pomegranates were harvested at commercial harvest stage and transported immediately to postharvest physiology laboratory. Fruit were divided into four groups. 1 Control: Dipped into distilled water + 0.01% Tween-20 solution for 10 min. 2 Oxalic acid (OA): Dipped into 6 mM OA + Tween-20 solution for 10 min. 3 Salicylic acid (SA): Dipped into 2 mM SA + Tween-20 solution for 10 min. 4 Putrescine (PUT): Dipped into 2 mM PUT + Tween-20 solution for 10 min. After treatments, pomegranates were stored at 6 °C and 90 ± 5% relative humidity for 6 months in controlled atmosphere (5% O2 + 15% CO2). Weight loss, color, total soluble solids content, titretable acidity (TA), total phenolic content, vitamin C, antioxidant activity and sugar content (glucose and fructose) were determined at 0th, 2th, 4th and 6th month of cold storage. Generally, weight losses were minimized by treatments, especially PUT, compared to control. The level of ascorbic acid significantly tended to decrease throughout the storage in all treatments. Treated pomegranate exhibited higher titratable acidity, total phenolic contents and antioxidant activity compared to control samples. However, PUT was the best among all treatments. The results suggest that SA, OA and PUT have the potential to extend the storage life of pomegranate by delaying quality loss and maintaining some bioactive compound and antioxidant activity.",Effects of different molecular weight water-extractable arabinoxylans on the physicochemical properties and structure of wheat gluten.,https://www.ncbi.nlm.nih.gov/pubmed/30728576,Journal of food science and technology,2019 02 10,"The effects of water-extractable arabinoxylans (WEAXs) with different molecular weights on the physicochemical properties and structure of wheat gluten were studied, a transition between β-turns in β-leaves in the structure of gluten has been demonstrated by Fourier transform infrared spectroscopy when WEAX samples were added. The ratio of weakly hydrogen-bonded β-sheets to strongly hydrogen-bonded β-sheets tended to decrease with increasing WEAX content. FT-Raman analysis demonstrated other changes in the structure of gluten concerning β-structures, the conformation of the disulfide bridges, and aromatic amino acid environments; these changes were dependent on the molecular weight of the WEAX. Native WEAXs of different molecular weights that are present as discrete fragments of the cell wall have had a negative effect on the properties of gluten. However, low molecular weight WEAX has helped gluten maintain the left-left conformation of its disulfide bonds. In addition, the gluten elasticity was reduced by the native WEAX to make it softer, but the WEAX low molecular weight impeded this process and improved the gluten network.",Effect of cultivar and season on the robustness of PLS models for soluble solid content prediction in apricots using FT-NIRS.,https://www.ncbi.nlm.nih.gov/pubmed/30728575,Journal of food science and technology,2019 02 10,"FT-NIR models were developed for the non-destructive prediction of soluble solid content (SSC), titratable acidity (TA), firmness and weight of two commercially important apricot cultivars, ""Hacıhaliloğlu"" and ""Kabaaşı"" from Turkey. The models constructed for SSC prediction gave good results. We could also establish a model which can be used for rough estimation of the apricot weight. However, it could not be possible to predict accurately TA and firmness of the apricots with FT-NIR spectroscopy. The study was further extended over 3 years for the SSC prediction. Validation of the both mono and multi-cultivar models showed that model performances may exhibit important variations across different harvest seasons. The robustness of the models was improved when the data of two or three seasons were used. It was concluded that in order to developed reliable SSC prediction models for apricots the spectral data should be collected over several harvest seasons.",Rheological and thermal study of structured oils: avocado (Persea americana) and sacha inchi (Plukenetia volubilis L.) systems.,https://www.ncbi.nlm.nih.gov/pubmed/30728574,Journal of food science and technology,2019 02 10,"Rheological and thermal characterization was performed in emulsions formulated from avocado oil and sacha inchi oil structured with soy lecithin, glyceryl monostearate and shortening (palm oil). For oleogel formulations, a completely randomized factorial design was considered to study the effect of the type of emulsifier and the proportions of avocado and sacha inchi oils. The rheological results indicated pseudoplastic behavior with semisolid characteristics. Additionally, the phase change studies showed two endothermic events corresponding to melting points from - 20.15 to - 18.94 °C and from 40.25 to 61.04 °C. The formulation with a ratio of avocado oil to sacha inchi oil of 80/20 and prepared using glyceryl monostearate as an emulsifier was evaluated as the best treatment and had an increased consistency coefficient and an increased loss tangent (δ < 0.5).","Effects of two sweet cherry cultivars (Prunus avium L., cvv. 'Ferrovia' and 'Lapins') on the shelf life of an innovative bakery product.",https://www.ncbi.nlm.nih.gov/pubmed/30728573,Journal of food science and technology,2019 02 10,"Sweet cherries are important fruits for human health, but their consumption is quite limited because of their seasonality and short shelf life. Consequently, these fruits are often subjected to technological treatments, but as a result, their consumption may involve significant intake of sugar and calories that tend to enhance many metabolic diseases. Agricultural science has characterized the different cultivars of fresh sweet cherries, but less literature is available about the suitability of different cultivars for industrial applications. The aim of this research was to design a model system to create an innovative bakery product with minimally processed fruits. Moreover, an evaluation of the suitability of two sweet cherry cultivars was performed to determine how to use these cultivars in an innovative bakery product and the effects on their shelf life. The results showed that the 'Ferrovia' cultivar is more suitable for use as a bakery product filling than 'Lapins' sweet cherries. During 75 days of storage at room temperature, 'Lapins' sweet cherries had aw and moisture values lower than those of 'Ferrovia'. Moreover, samples filled with 'Lapins' sweet cherries were harder than samples filled with 'Ferrovia' cherries. The technological processing of the sweet cherries caused a loss in antioxidant capacity that was more pronounced for 'Lapins' than 'Ferrovia' cherries (from 13.63 to 0.67 TEAC µmol g-1 DW and 11.37-2.70 TEAC µmol g-1 DW, respectively). This research highlights the importance of the cultivar for fresh consumption and processing of sweet cherry fruits, and the results show that if both cultivars are equally ripe, the cherry cultivar that retains a higher flesh firmness is more preferable for use.",Development and evaluation of retort pouch processed chhenapoda (cheese based baked sweet).,https://www.ncbi.nlm.nih.gov/pubmed/30728572,Journal of food science and technology,2019 02 10,"A study has been undertaken to optimize ingredient proportions for preparation of chhenapoda and the effect of retort processing on its quality and storability. Chhenapoda was prepared from cottage cheese with standard practices followed by confectioners using different levels of semolina (0, 50, 100, 150, 200 g) and sugar (0, 100, 200, 300, 400 g) per kg cheese and ingredient proportion was optimized based on sensory scores. Prepared chhenapoda sample of 200 g were packed in pre-fabricated 3 side seal multilayer laminated retortable pouches, hermetically sealed and retort processed at different temperatures (100, 110 and 120 °C) and time intervals (15, 30 and 45 min). It was found from Response Surface Methodology (RSM) technique that addition of 18.5% sugar and 7.5% semolina with cottage cheese was optimum for chhenapoda preparation. Microbiological analysis showed that total plate count and yeast and mould count (YMC) decreased from 110 × 107 to 4 × 104 and YMC from 3 × 103 to 0 respectively during retort processing (30 min thermal processing in laminated pouch at 120 °C). From the storage study, it can be concluded that retort processing of chhenapoda in laminated pouch at 120 °C for 30 min resulted in microbiological safe and sensory acceptable product which could be stored up to 30 days under refrigerated condition.",Impact of potatoes deep-frying on common monounsaturated-rich vegetable oils: a comparative study.,https://www.ncbi.nlm.nih.gov/pubmed/30728571,Journal of food science and technology,2019 02 10,"Aiming to distinguish the nutritional and safety impacts on consumer's health of prolonged frying with vegetable oils rich in monounsaturated fatty acids (MUFA), namely peanut oil (PO), canola oil (CO) and extra virgin olive oil (EVOO), a domestic deep-frying assay using fresh potatoes was implemented (175 °C, 8 h per day, up to 28 h). Based on a total polar compounds (TPC) degradation limit of 25%, PO and CO enabled 18-20 h of frying, while EVOO allowed significantly higher frying hours (> 28 h). Despite the non-significant variations in oxidized triglycerides contents observed through time, and loss of all major antioxidants during the first 8 to 12 h of frying, PO showed statistically higher amounts of conjugated dienes (27 at 20 h; against 19 in CO and 17 in EVOO) and CO of anisidine value (252 at 20 h; against 209 in PO and 100 in EVOO), indicative of different oxidation patters. This was corroborated with the analysis of major volatiles, with PO and CO being statistically richer in alkenals and alkadienals, respectively. Therefore, despite the MUFA predominance, differences in their unsaturation profile impact on the type and amount of degradations products formed under prolonged frying and consequently on consumer's health. As to EVOO use for prolonged frying, despite its increased resistance to oxidation and lower risk of formation of unhealthy volatiles, it loses its pool of natural bioactive compounds in the first hours of frying.","The impact of four processing methods on trypsin-, chymotrypsin- and alpha-amylase inhibitors present in underutilised legumes.",https://www.ncbi.nlm.nih.gov/pubmed/30728570,Journal of food science and technology,2019 02 10,"The global trend in increasing plant-based protein diets due to health and ideological reasons, has created an increased demand for food legumes that exceeds current production. To meet this demand, it is timely to reduce relying solely on soybean, and explore the potential of the underutilised legumes that are cultivated regionally. Underutilised legumes are rich in protein, carbohydrates and other nutrients that are essential for consumer. However, relatively little is known about their anti-nutritional properties and processing methods. Anti-nutritional factors (ANFs) such as enzyme inhibitors are prevalent in legumes and may interfere with digestibility and nutrient absorption. Nevertheless, an optimised food processing method will overcome this challenge and warrant a safe inclusion of legume in plant-based protein diets. Hence current study aimed to optimise the food processing methods (soaking, wet heating, autoclaving and freezing) and evaluate their efficiency in eliminating the enzyme inhibitors [trypsin, chymotrypsin (CIA) and α-amylase (AIA) inhibitors] present in seven underutilised legumes. Current study showed that autoclaving at 121 °C for 15 min reduced the AIA in all underutilised legumes tested. The AIA and CIA of bambara groundnut were successfully inactivated by wet heating at 50 °C for 60 min, and by autoclaving at 121 °C for 15 min. While the CIA of chickpea was successfully inactivated by freezing at - 80 °C for 24 h.",Milling and thermal treatment induced changes on phenolic components and antioxidant activities of pigmented rice flours.,https://www.ncbi.nlm.nih.gov/pubmed/30728569,Journal of food science and technology,2019 02 10,"Processing methods involved in value addition to pigmented broken rice, a milling by-product may affect the nutraceutical qualities. Hence the effect of pulverisation and toasting on nutraceutical content in brown rice flours of red and black rice varieties were studied. Plate milling reduced soluble, bound and total polyphenols in red, but increased in black; increased insoluble polyphenols and oryzanol, and reduced anthocyanin in both varieties; antioxidant activity is reduced in red, but increased in black. Toasting caused reduction of soluble, insoluble and total polyphenol, anthocyanin and antioxidant activity in both varieties with an increase in bound polyphenols, and retention of flavonoids and oryzanol. HPLC characterization of phenolics showed changes on processing in content of catechin, caffeic, vanillic, protocatechuic and ferulic acid. It can be concluded that processing impacts the phenolic components of pigmented broken brown rice flour and this information is useful for functional food industry.",Disinfectant of pummelo (Citrus Grandis L.

Osbeck) fruit juice components. Unfiltered and filtered pummelo fruit juices were treated with gaseous ozone for up to 50 min with ozone concentration fixed at 600 mg/h. A microbiological and physicochemical properties analysis were conducted on the ozone-treated fruit juices samples. It was found that the survival rate of aerobic bacteria, yeast and mold in unfiltered pummelo fruit juice were higher compared to filtered juice, as the juice components acted as protective barriers to the microorganisms. The microorganisms' inactivation in pummelo fruit juices was also observed to have increased as the ozone treatment time increased. Significant effects on total colour difference, ascorbic acid content, and total phenolic content were also observed over increased ozone-treatment time. However, ozone was shown to be ineffective in activating PME activity in both types of juice. The experimental results of this study indicated that pummelo fruit juice components had significant effects on the effectiveness of gaseous ozone, however, the degree of the effects depends on the different fruit components (total soluble solids, total phenolic content). As a conclusion, filtered juice showed better quality characteristics in comparison to unfiltered juice post-ozone treatment."

Here, study aimed to optimize the carbon source to enhance the yield of EPS production, partial characterization and antioxidant activity of α-d-glucan EPS. Among different disaccharides (sucrose, maltose, lactose) and monosaccharides (glucose, galactose and fructose), combination of sucrose and glucose at 2% showed highest EPS production of 4.55 g/L in MRS medium. The molecular weight was identified as ~ 4.428 × 103 kDa with MALDI-TOF mass spectroscopy. 1D and 2D NMR results exhibited the presence of α-1-6 and α-1-3 linked glucose revealed EPS as a glucan. Antioxidant properties of glucan (500 µg/mL) revealed the significant oxidation alleviation potential such as DPPH (74%) and Hydroxyl radical activity (97.8%), whereas metal chelating activity (70%) was lower as compare to control standard.

Antimicrobial activities of various phenolic compounds against bacteria and fungi are well established; however, their effects on yeasts have not been examined. Aim of this study was to investigate the antimicrobial effects induced by olive phenolic compounds, including tyrosol, hydroxytyrosol, oleuropein, luteolin and apigenin against two yeast species, Aureobasidium pullulans and Saccharomyces cerevisiae. For this purpose, yeasts were treated with various concentrations (12.5-1000 ppm) of phenolic compounds and reduction in yeast population was followed with optical density measurements with microplate reader, yeast colony forming units and mid-infrared spectroscopy. All phenolic compounds were effective on both yeasts, especially 200 ppm and higher concentrations have significant antimicrobial activity; however, effects of lower levels depend on the type of phenolic compound. According to mid-infrared spectral data, significant changes were observed in 1200-900 cm-1 range corresponding to carbohydrates of yeast structure as a result of exposure to all phenolic compounds except tyrosol. Spectra of tyrosol and luteolin treated yeasts also showed changes in 1750-1500 cm-1 related to amide section and 3600-3000 cm-1 fatty acid region. Since phenolic compounds from olives were effective against yeasts, they could be used in food applications where yeast growth showed problem. In addition, FTIR spectroscopy could be successfully used to monitor and characterize antimicrobial activity of phenolic compounds on yeasts as complementary to conventional microbiological methods.","Development of rapid dipstick assay for food pathogens, Salmonella, by optimized parameters.",https://www.ncbi.nlm.nih.gov/pubmed/30728555,Journal of food science and technology,2019 02 10,"Salmonella is among the very important pathogens threating the human and animal health. Rapid and easy detection of these pathogens is crucial. In this context, antibody (Ab) based lateral flow assays (LFAs) which are simple immunochromatographic point of care test kits were developed by gold nanoparticles (GNPs) as labelling agent for Salmonella detection. For that purpose some critical parameters such as reagent concentrations on the capture zones, conjugate concentrations and ideal membrane type needed for LFAs for whole cell detection were tested for naked eye analysis. Therefore, prepared LFAs were applied to the live and heat inactivated cells when they were used alone or included in different bacterial mixtures. Among the test platforms, membrane 180 (M180) was found as an ideal membrane and 36 nm GNPs showed highly good labelling in the developed LFAs. Diluted conjugates and low concentrations of reagents affected the test signal negatively. Salmonella was detected in different bacterial mixtures, selectively in 4-5 min. The best recognized species by used Ab were S. enteritidis and S. infantis. 5 × 105S. typhimurium cells were also determined as a limit of detection of this study with mentioned parameters.",Antioxidant and physicochemical characteristics of unfermented and fermented pomegranate (Punica granatum L.) beverages.,https://www.ncbi.nlm.nih.gov/pubmed/30728554,Journal of food science and technology,2019 02 10,"The aim of this study was to evaluate the physicochemical, antioxidant (antioxidant activity, total phenolic compounds, flavonoids, anthocyanins), and sensory characteristics of fresh (FRJ) and fermented (FEB) pomegranate beverages. Three fermentation conditions were tested based on the total soluble solids (TSS: °Bx) content in pomegranate juice: (a) natural TSS (13.9 °Bx) in fresh juice (FEB1), (b) adjusted to 17.5 °Bx (FEB2) and (c) adjusted to 25 °Bx (FEB3).

Three lots of dry-cured hams were tested during processing (0, 9, 48, 74, 112, 142, 166 and 211 days). Lot 1 had no added starter culture. Lot 2 contained a starter culture of Penicillium chrysogenum, Penicillium digitatum, Penicillium nalgiovense, Debaryomyces hansenii, Lactobacillus plantarum, Lactobacillus acidophilus, Pediococcus pentosaceus and Micrococcus varians was and lot 3 had L. plantarum, L. acidophilus, P. pentosaceus and M. varians. The use of a selected starter culture based on a combination of lactic acid bacteria (LAB) and fungal strains with a demonstrated proteolytic activity such as P. chrysogenum and D. hansenii (lot 2) did not affect the main characteristics of dry-cured ham processing, even enhancing some desirable aspects, like its non-protein nitrogen contents. LAB strains were not significantly affected by combining them with fungal starter, and better counts were found with respect to control. A higher thiobarbituric acid reactive substances content was described in lot inoculated only with LAB (lot 3). Potentially pathogenic microorganisms were not detected in any of the lots studied.

S. baltica can't produce the signal molecule of acyl-homoserine-lactones (AHLs), so the aim of this study was to investigate how wild type S. baltica SA03 (WT SA03) eavesdrop exogenous AHLs to enhance its spoilage ability through LuxR receptor. The results indicated that Aeromonas spp. (Aer), Acinetobacter spp. (Aci) and Serratia spp. (Ser) isolated from refrigerated shrimp can produce different AHLs. WT SA03 can eavesdrop the AHLs of Aer (C4-HSL), Aci (O-C6-HSL) and Ser (C6-HSL, O-C6-HSL) to enhance its growth, especially Ser. Exogenous C4-HSL and C6-HSL enhanced biofilm formation of WT SA03, and C6-HSL and O-C6-HSL enhanced thioredoxin reductase trxB mRNA expression. However, the luxR mutant of WT SA03 (ΔluxR SA03) lost or weakened the role of using environmental AHLs. In vivo experiments, the lag time of WT SA03 was shortened by 6.4 h, 6.2 h and 14.4 h by co-inoculated with Aer, Aci and Ser, respectively. The total volatile basic nitrogen (TVB-N) were significantly enhanced in the samples co-inoculated with WT SA03 and Aer (or Aci, Ser) than those of ΔluxR SA03 and Aer (or Aci, Ser) (p < 0.05). The results showed that S. baltica SA03 can utilize AHLs produced by other bacteria to enhance its growth and spoilage ability through LuxR receptor system.

L. casei was incorporated to fresh murta by vacuum impregnation at alternative conditions (pressure 50, 150 and 300 mbar; time 5, 10 and 15 min; temperature 20 ± 0.2 °C) and impregnated murta samples were dehydrated by two drying methods at 40 °C, vacuum and convective drying. Both drying processes were modeled by three mathematical models (Weibull, Page and modified Page). According to the statistical tests applied, the Weilbull model obtained the best-fit quality on experimental data. Effective moisture diffusivity varied between 1.23-1.75 × 10-10 m2/s and 1.16-1.44 × 10-10 m2/s for vacuum and convective drying, respectively. After impregnation, murta berries contained approximately 107 CFU/g L. casei although maximum counts were found at 150 mbar for 15 min. Drying decreased L. casei viability in 1.5-1.9 log and 0.5-1.2 log for vacuum and convective drying, respectively. Thus, impregnation at 150 mbar for 15 min followed by convective drying at 40 °C appears as the method of choice to produce probiotic enriched murta berries that can be commercialized as probiotic dried snacks.",Effect of pepsin and SO2 treatments on yield and properties of starch from Tabat and Wad-baco sorghum cultivars.,https://www.ncbi.nlm.nih.gov/pubmed/30728550,Journal of food science and technology,2019 02 10,"This study aims to evaluate the effect of pepsin and SO2 treatments on the yield and physicochemical-, functional-, and color properties of starches isolated from Tabat and Wad-baco sorghum cultivars.

The combination of pepsin and SO2 treatment (BES) produced an increased starch yield of 78.90% and 85.56% from Tabat and Wad-baco, respectively. Micrographs showed hydrolysis of the protein matrix attached to the starch by pepsin, which created holes on the surface of starch granule. Gelatinization temperature decreased in the treated starches from both cultivars compared to control. Water- and fat- absorption capacities were higher in the starch from all treatments compared to control. Generally, enzyme treatment improved the yield and functional properties of starches from both cultivars.",Effects of pectin and emulsifiers on the physical and nutritional qualities and consumer acceptability of wheat composite dough and bread.,https://www.ncbi.nlm.nih.gov/pubmed/30728549,Journal of food science and technology,2019 02 10,"Rheological behaviour and certain quality attributes of the dough and bread prepared from the wheat-millet-Bambara flour (WMB) containing mixtures of emulsifiers and/or apple pectin were investigated. WMB was prepared by substituting wheat flour (WF) with 25% millet flour and 25% Bambara flour. Pectin (1.0-2.0 g) and emulsifiers namely sodium stearoyl lactylate (0.25-0.40 g), polysorbate 80 (0.50-0.80 g), and diacetyl tartaric acid ester of monoglycerides (0.10-0.25 g) mixed in different proportions were added to produce dough and bread. Mixolab was utilised to measure the rheological behaviour of dough and bread made from all mixes were analysed for physical characteristics, nutritional composition, and organoleptic properties. A significant increase in dough development time (emulsifier: 65% and pectin: 57.9%) and dough stability (emulsifier: 18.2% and pectin: 35.2%) were observed. Loaf volume, specific volume and proximate composition of the composite bread increased significantly relative to control. Protein content (33%), protein digestibility (85%) and certain essential amino acids (lysine: 54.6%; threonine: 36.4%) increased significantly in the WMB bread compared to the WF bread. Sensory evaluation revealed an above average acceptability for the composite bread samples. Emulsifiers and pectin used in the present study resulted in significant improvement in the dough rheology, as well as in the physical characteristics, the nutritional and sensory attributes of the WMB composite bread.

The optimized model predicted, solvent concentration of 60% with extraction time of 15 min and extracting temperature of 65 °C with bioactive-rich antioxidants having highest total phenolic activity. The efficacy of obtained bioactive-rich papaya leaves extracts (PLE) were subjected for in-vivo evaluation in chevon emulsion added with the level of T-1 (0.10%); T-2 (0.25%); T-3 (0.50%) and control (without extract) stored under refrigeration (4 ± 1 °C) for 9 days by evaluating various physicochemical, microbiological, sensory quality characteristics. The pH was significantly higher for control than all treatments and water activity (aw) showed decreasing trend throughout storage period. Oxidation efficiency values showed an increasing drift during storage period, irrespective of added level of PLE, showing lowest oxidation in samples treated with 0.5% PLE. Sensory panellists awarded comparatively higher scores to all PLE treatments than control. Microbiological quality of emulsion incorporated with different levels of papaya leaves extract successfully improved and was lower in 0.5% PLE treated samples. It was concluded that extraction of bioactive antioxidants from Carica papaya L. leaves improved by optimising extraction parameters using RSM. Carica papaya L. leaves extracts have proven prospects as natural anti-oxidants in chevon emulsion as a meat emulsion system."

The highest predictions are driven by the controversial marine ice-cliff instability (MICI) hypothesis, which assumes that coastal ice cliffs can rapidly collapse after ice shelves disintegrate, as a result of surface and sub-shelf melting caused by global warming. But MICI has not been observed in the modern era and it remains unclear whether it is required to reproduce sea-level variations in the geological past. Here we quantify ice-sheet modelling uncertainties for the original MICI study and show that the probability distributions are skewed towards lower values (under very high greenhouse gas concentrations, the most likely value is 45 centimetres). However, MICI is not required to reproduce sea-level changes due to Antarctic ice loss in the mid-Pliocene epoch, the last interglacial period or 1992-2017; without it we find that the projections agree with previous studies (all 95th percentiles are less than 43 centimetres). We conclude that previous interpretations of these MICI projections over-estimate sea-level rise this century; because the MICI hypothesis is not well constrained, confidence in projections with MICI would require a greater range of observationally constrained models of ice-shelf vulnerability and ice-cliff collapse.",L1 drives IFN in senescent cells and promotes age-associated inflammation.,https://www.ncbi.nlm.nih.gov/pubmed/30728521,Nature,2019 05 18,"Retrotransposable elements are deleterious at many levels, and the failure of host surveillance systems for these elements can thus have negative consequences. However, the contribution of retrotransposon activity to ageing and age-associated diseases is not known. Here we show that during cellular senescence, L1 (also known as LINE-1) retrotransposable elements become transcriptionally derepressed and activate a type-I interferon (IFN-I) response. The IFN-I response is a phenotype of late senescence and contributes to the maintenance of the senescence-associated secretory phenotype. The IFN-I response is triggered by cytoplasmic L1 cDNA, and is antagonized by inhibitors of the L1 reverse transcriptase. Treatment of aged mice with the nucleoside reverse transcriptase inhibitor lamivudine downregulated IFN-I activation and age-associated inflammation (inflammaging) in several tissues. We propose that the activation of retrotransposons is an important component of sterile inflammation that is a hallmark of ageing, and that L1 reverse transcriptase is a relevant target for the treatment of age-associated disorders.",Global environmental consequences of twenty-first-century ice-sheet melt.,https://www.ncbi.nlm.nih.gov/pubmed/30728520,Nature,2019 04 18,"Government policies currently commit us to surface warming of three to four degrees Celsius above pre-industrial levels by 2100, which will lead to enhanced ice-sheet melt. Ice-sheet discharge was not explicitly included in Coupled Model Intercomparison Project phase 5, so effects on climate from this melt are not currently captured in the simulations most commonly used to inform governmental policy. Here we show, using simulations of the Greenland and Antarctic ice sheets constrained by satellite-based measurements of recent changes in ice mass, that increasing meltwater from Greenland will lead to substantial slowing of the Atlantic overturning circulation, and that meltwater from Antarctica will trap warm water below the sea surface, creating a positive feedback that increases Antarctic ice loss. In our simulations, future ice-sheet melt enhances global temperature variability and contributes up to 25 centimetres to sea level by 2100. However, uncertainties in the way in which future changes in ice dynamics are modelled remain, underlining the need for continued observations and comprehensive multi-model assessments.",An N-nitrosating metalloenzyme constructs the pharmacophore of streptozotocin.,https://www.ncbi.nlm.nih.gov/pubmed/30728519,Nature,2019 03 25,"Small molecules containing the N-nitroso group, such as the bacterial natural product streptozotocin, are prominent carcinogens1,2 and important cancer chemotherapeutics3,4. Despite the considerable importance of this functional group to human health, enzymes dedicated to the assembly of the N-nitroso unit have not been identified. Here we show that SznF, a metalloenzyme from the biosynthesis of streptozotocin, catalyses an oxidative rearrangement of the guanidine group of Nω-methyl-L-arginine to generate an N-nitrosourea product. Structural characterization and mutagenesis of SznF reveal two separate active sites that promote distinct steps in this transformation using different iron-containing metallocofactors. This biosynthetic reaction, which has little precedent in enzymology or organic synthesis, expands the catalytic capabilities of non-haem-iron-dependent enzymes to include N-N bond formation. We find that biosynthetic gene clusters that encode SznF homologues are widely distributed among bacteria-including environmental organisms, plant symbionts and human pathogens-which suggests an unexpectedly diverse and uncharacterized microbial reservoir of bioactive N-nitroso metabolites.",Anti-tumour immunity controlled through mRNA m6A methylation and YTHDF1 in dendritic cells.,https://www.ncbi.nlm.nih.gov/pubmed/30728504,Nature,2019 05 19,"There is growing evidence that tumour neoantigens have important roles in generating spontaneous antitumour immune responses and predicting clinical responses to immunotherapies1,2. Despite the presence of numerous neoantigens in patients, complete tumour elimination is rare, owing to failures in mounting a sufficient and lasting antitumour immune response3,4. Here we show that durable neoantigen-specific immunity is regulated by mRNA N6-methyadenosine (m6A) methylation through the m6A-binding protein YTHDF15. In contrast to wild-type mice, Ythdf1-deficient mice show an elevated antigen-specific CD8+ T cell antitumour response. Loss of YTHDF1 in classical dendritic cells enhanced the cross-presentation of tumour antigens and the cross-priming of CD8+ T cells in vivo. Mechanistically, transcripts encoding lysosomal proteases are marked by m6A and recognized by YTHDF1. Binding of YTHDF1 to these transcripts increases the translation of lysosomal cathepsins in dendritic cells, and inhibition of cathepsins markedly enhances cross-presentation of wild-type dendritic cells. Furthermore, the therapeutic efficacy of PD-L1 checkpoint blockade is enhanced in Ythdf1-/- mice, implicating YTHDF1 as a potential therapeutic target in anticancer immunotherapy.",Discrete attractor dynamics underlies persistent activity in the frontal cortex.,https://www.ncbi.nlm.nih.gov/pubmed/30728503,Nature,2019 05 17,"Short-term memories link events separated in time, such as past sensation and future actions. Short-term memories are correlated with slow neural dynamics, including selective persistent activity, which can be maintained over seconds. In a delayed response task that requires short-term memory, neurons in the mouse anterior lateral motor cortex (ALM) show persistent activity that instructs future actions. To determine the principles that underlie this persistent activity, here we combined intracellular and extracellular electrophysiology with optogenetic perturbations and network modelling. We show that during the delay epoch, the activity of ALM neurons moved towards discrete end points that correspond to specific movement directions. These end points were robust to transient shifts in ALM activity caused by optogenetic perturbations. Perturbations occasionally switched the population dynamics to the other end point, followed by incorrect actions. Our results show that discrete attractor dynamics underlie short-term memory related to motor planning.",Ultra-large library docking for discovering new chemotypes.,https://www.ncbi.nlm.nih.gov/pubmed/30728502,Nature,2019 05 19,"Despite intense interest in expanding chemical space, libraries containing hundreds-of-millions to billions of diverse molecules have remained inaccessible. Here we investigate structure-based docking of 170 million make-on-demand compounds from 130 well-characterized reactions. The resulting library is diverse, representing over 10.7 million scaffolds that are otherwise unavailable. For each compound in the library, docking against AmpC β-lactamase (AmpC) and the D4 dopamine receptor were simulated. From the top-ranking molecules, 44 and 549 compounds were synthesized and tested for interactions with AmpC and the D4 dopamine receptor, respectively. We found a phenolate inhibitor of AmpC, which revealed a group of inhibitors without known precedent. This molecule was optimized to 77 nM, which places it among the most potent non-covalent AmpC inhibitors known. Crystal structures of this and other AmpC inhibitors confirmed the docking predictions. Against the D4 dopamine receptor, hit rates fell almost monotonically with docking score, and a hit-rate versus score curve predicted that the library contained 453,000 ligands for the D4 dopamine receptor. Of 81 new chemotypes discovered, 30 showed submicromolar activity, including a 180-pM subtype-selective agonist of the D4 dopamine receptor.",Interacting multi-channel topological boundary modes in a quantum Hall valley system.,https://www.ncbi.nlm.nih.gov/pubmed/30728501,Nature,2019 05 28,"Symmetry and topology are central to understanding quantum Hall ferromagnets (QHFMs), two-dimensional electronic phases with spontaneously broken spin or pseudospin symmetry whose wavefunctions also have topological properties1,2. Domain walls between distinct broken-symmetry QHFM phases are predicted to host gapless one-dimensional modes-that is, quantum channels that emerge because of a topological change in the underlying electronic wavefunctions at such interfaces. Although various QHFMs have been identified in different materials3-8, interacting electronic modes at these domain walls have not been probed. Here we use a scanning tunnelling microscope to directly visualize the spontaneous formation of boundary modes at domain walls between QHFM phases with different valley polarization (that is, the occupation of equal-energy but quantum mechanically distinct valleys in the electronic structure) on the surface of bismuth. Spectroscopy shows that these modes occur within a topological energy gap, which closes and reopens as the valley polarization switches across the domain wall. By changing the valley flavour and the number of modes at the domain wall, we can realize different regimes in which the valley-polarized channels are either metallic or develop a spectroscopic gap. This behaviour is a consequence of Coulomb interactions constrained by the valley flavour, which determines whether electrons in the topological modes can backscatter, making these channels a unique class of interacting one-dimensional quantum wires. QHFM domain walls can be realized in different classes of two-dimensional materials, providing the opportunity to explore a rich phase space of interactions in these quantum wires.",The CH25H-CYP7B1-RORα axis of cholesterol metabolism regulates osteoarthritis.,https://www.ncbi.nlm.nih.gov/pubmed/30728500,Nature,2019 05 19,"Osteoarthritis-the most common form of age-related degenerative whole-joint disease1-is primarily characterized by cartilage destruction, as well as by synovial inflammation, osteophyte formation and subchondral bone remodelling2,3. However, the molecular mechanisms that underlie the pathogenesis of osteoarthritis are largely unknown. Although osteoarthritis is currently considered to be associated with metabolic disorders, direct evidence for this is lacking, and the role of cholesterol metabolism in the pathogenesis of osteoarthritis has not been fully investigated4-6. Various types of cholesterol hydroxylases contribute to cholesterol metabolism in extrahepatic tissues by converting cellular cholesterol to circulating oxysterols, which regulate diverse biological processes7,8. Here we show that the CH25H-CYP7B1-RORα axis of cholesterol metabolism in chondrocytes is a crucial catabolic regulator of the pathogenesis of osteoarthritis. Osteoarthritic chondrocytes had increased levels of cholesterol because of enhanced uptake, upregulation of cholesterol hydroxylases (CH25H and CYP7B1) and increased production of oxysterol metabolites. Adenoviral overexpression of CH25H or CYP7B1 in mouse joint tissues caused experimental osteoarthritis, whereas knockout or knockdown of these hydroxylases abrogated the pathogenesis of osteoarthritis. Moreover, retinoic acid-related orphan receptor alpha (RORα) was found to mediate the induction of osteoarthritis by alterations in cholesterol metabolism. These results indicate that osteoarthritis is a disease associated with metabolic disorders and suggest that targeting the CH25H-CYP7B1-RORα axis of cholesterol metabolism may provide a therapeutic avenue for treating osteoarthritis.",Evidence for an alternative fatty acid desaturation pathway increasing cancer plasticity.,https://www.ncbi.nlm.nih.gov/pubmed/30728499,Nature,2019 05 28,"Most tumours have an aberrantly activated lipid metabolism1,2 that enables them to synthesize, elongate and desaturate fatty acids to support proliferation. However, only particular subsets of cancer cells are sensitive to approaches that target fatty acid metabolism and, in particular, fatty acid desaturation3. This suggests that many cancer cells contain an unexplored plasticity in their fatty acid metabolism. Here we show that some cancer cells can exploit an alternative fatty acid desaturation pathway. We identify various cancer cell lines, mouse hepatocellular carcinomas, and primary human liver and lung carcinomas that desaturate palmitate to the unusual fatty acid sapienate to support membrane biosynthesis during proliferation. Accordingly, we found that sapienate biosynthesis enables cancer cells to bypass the known fatty acid desaturation pathway that is dependent on stearoyl-CoA desaturase. Thus, only by targeting both desaturation pathways is the in vitro and in vivo proliferation of cancer cells that synthesize sapienate impaired. Our discovery explains metabolic plasticity in fatty acid desaturation and constitutes an unexplored metabolic rewiring in cancers."

Communities were skeptical of governmental risk assessments because they did not take into account the higher consumption of seafood along coastal areas. The objective of this study was to perform a probabilistic risk assessment based on the consumption rates of high-end consumers of Gulf seafood. We utilized seafood consumption data from five communities across the northeastern Gulf of Mexico. This study collected finfish, shrimp, blue crab, and oysters from these communities and analyzed their tissues for polynuclear aromatic hydrocarbons (PAHs). A probabilistic risk assessment was performed using population-specific seafood consumption rates and body weights for commercial fishers, recreational fishers, and a Filipino-American community. For non-cancer effects, 95th percentile hazard quotients for these targeted populations ranged between 1.84E-04 to 5.39E-03 for individual seafood types. The 95th percentile hazard indices for total seafood consumption ranged from 3.45E-03 to 8.41E-03. Based on total seafood consumption, highest hazard indices were modeled for the Filipino-American community followed by commercial and recreational fishers. Despite higher consumption rates, hazard indices for the high-end consumers targeted in this study were two to three orders of magnitude below the regulatory limit of 1.",Within-individual and interlaboratory variability analyses of urinary metabolites measurements of organophosphorus insecticides.,https://www.ncbi.nlm.nih.gov/pubmed/30728480,Journal of exposure science & environmental epidemiology,2019 02 07,"Single-spot urine is often used to estimate organophosphorus insecticide (OP) exposure. However, variations of urinary metabolite concentrations during the day are considerable as OP half-lives are short and as diet is their main exposure source. In addition, quality control is indispensable for institutions that analyze these metabolites. This study aimed to clarify (1) adequate frequencies of urine collection for estimating OP exposure and (2) interlaboratory variation in measured concentrations of OP metabolites, dialkylphosphates (DAPs). To quantify intra-individual variations, urine was collected eight times during a period that spanned 5 consecutive days from nine children aged 5-6 years. For interlaboratory variations, 41 spot samples from 14 pregnant women and 13 three-year-old children were used. Intraclass correlation coefficients for the DAPs were moderate but misclassification occurred in > 50% of the surrogate category analyses using single measurements. The misclassification frequency decreased to satisfactory levels when three temporal measurements were conducted. Values of four DAPs measured in the two laboratories correlated well except in the cases of urine samples obtained from two pregnant women. In conclusion, urinary DAPs should be measured from spot urine samples obtained during 3 different days. Sharing matrix-contained standards and quality control samples should minimize interlaboratory variations.",Multiplexed profiling of RNA and protein expression signatures in individual cells using flow or mass cytometry.,https://www.ncbi.nlm.nih.gov/pubmed/30728478,Nature protocols,2019 04 22,"Advances in single-cell analysis technologies are providing novel insights into phenotypic and functional heterogeneity within seemingly identical cell populations. RNA within single cells can be analyzed using unbiased sequencing protocols or through more targeted approaches using in situ hybridization (ISH). The proximity ligation assay for RNA (PLAYR) approach is a sensitive and high-throughput technique that relies on in situ and proximal ligation to measure at least 27 specific RNAs by flow or mass cytometry. We provide detailed instructions for combining this technique with antibody-based detection of surface/internal protein, allowing simultaneous highly multiplexed profiling of RNA and protein expression at single-cell resolution. PLAYR overcomes limitations on multiplexing seen in previous branching DNA-based RNA detection techniques by integration of a transcript-specific oligonucleotide sequence within a rolling-circle amplification (RCA). This unique transcript-associated sequence can then be detected by heavy metal (for mass cytometry)- or fluorophore (for flow cytometry)-conjugated complementary detection oligonucleotides. Included in this protocol is methodology to label oligonucleotides with lanthanide metals for use in mass cytometry. When analyzed by mass cytometry, up to 40 variables (with scope for future expansion) can be measured simultaneously. We used the described protocol to demonstrate intraclonal heterogeneity within primary cells from chronic lymphocytic leukemia patients, but it can be adapted to other primary cells or cell lines in suspension. This robust, reliable and reproducible protocol can be completed in 2-3 d and can be paused at several stages for convenience.","Understanding, justifying, and optimizing radiation exposure for CT imaging in nephrourology.",https://www.ncbi.nlm.nih.gov/pubmed/30728476,Nature reviews. Urology,2019 04 06,"An estimated 4-5 million CT scans are performed in the USA every year to investigate nephrourological diseases such as urinary stones and renal masses. Despite the clinical benefits of CT imaging, concerns remain regarding the potential risks associated with exposure to ionizing radiation. To assess the potential risk of harmful biological effects from exposure to ionizing radiation, understanding the mechanisms by which radiation damage and repair occur is essential. Although radiation level and cancer risk follow a linear association at high doses, no strong relationship is apparent below 100 mSv, the doses used in diagnostic imaging. Furthermore, the small theoretical increase in risk of cancer incidence must be considered in the context of the clinical benefit derived from a medically indicated CT and the likelihood of cancer occurrence in the general population. Elimination of unnecessary imaging is the most important method to reduce imaging-related radiation; however, technical aspects of medically justified imaging should also be optimized, such that the required diagnostic information is retained while minimizing the dose of radiation. Despite intensive study, evidence to prove an increased cancer risk associated with radiation doses below ~100 mSv is lacking; however, concerns about ionizing radiation in medical imaging remain and can affect patient care. Overall, the principles of justification and optimization must remain the basis of clinical decision-making regarding the use of ionizing radiation in medicine.",Antibodies and venom peptides: new modalities for ion channels.,https://www.ncbi.nlm.nih.gov/pubmed/30728472,Nature reviews. Drug discovery,2019 05 07,"Ion channels play fundamental roles in both excitable and non-excitable tissues and therefore constitute attractive drug targets for myriad neurological, cardiovascular and metabolic diseases as well as for cancer and immunomodulation. However, achieving selectivity for specific ion channel subtypes with small-molecule drugs has been challenging, and there currently is a growing trend to target ion channels with biologics. One approach is to improve the pharmacokinetics of existing or novel venom-derived peptides. In parallel, after initial studies with polyclonal antibodies demonstrated the technical feasibility of inhibiting channel function with antibodies, multiple preclinical programmes are now using the full spectrum of available technologies to generate conventional monoclonal and engineered antibodies or nanobodies against extracellular loops of ion channels. After a summary of the current state of ion channel drug discovery, this Review discusses recent developments using the purinergic receptor channel P2X purinoceptor 7 (P2X7), the voltage-gated potassium channel KV1.3 and the voltage-gated sodium channel NaV1.7 as examples of targeting ion channels with biologics.",The gut microbiota is largely independent of host genetics in regulating fat deposition in chickens.,https://www.ncbi.nlm.nih.gov/pubmed/30728470,The ISME journal,2019 06 10,"The gut microbiota has an important role in animal health and performance, but its contribution is difficult to determine, in particular given the effects of host genetic factors. Here, whole-genome sequencing of the hosts and 16S rRNA gene sequencing of the microbiota were performed to separate the effects between host genetics and the microbiota in the duodenum, jejunum, ileum, caecum and faeces on fat deposition in 206 yellow broilers reared under identical conditions. Despite the notable spatial variation in the diversity, composition and potential function of the gut microbiota, host genetics exerted limited effects on the gut microbial community. The duodenal and caecal microbiota made greater contributions to fat deposition and could separately account for 24% and 21% of the variance in the abdominal fat mass after correcting for host genetic effects. We further identified two caecal microbial taxa, Methanobrevibacter and Mucispirillum schaedleri, which were significantly correlated with fat deposition. Chickens with a lower Methanobrevibacter abundance had significantly lower abdominal fat content than those with a higher abundance of Methanobrevibacter (35.51 vs. 55.59 g), and the body weights of these chickens did not notably differ. Chickens with a higher M. schaedleri abundance exhibited lower abdominal fat accumulation (39.88 vs. 55.06 g) and body weight (2.23 vs. 2.41 kg) than those with a lower abundance of this species. These findings may aid the development of strategies for altering the gut microbiota to control fat deposition during broiler production.",Genomic insights from Monoglobus pectinilyticus: a pectin-degrading specialist bacterium in the human colon.,https://www.ncbi.nlm.nih.gov/pubmed/30728469,The ISME journal,2019 06 10,"Pectin is abundant in modern day diets, as it comprises the middle lamellae and one-third of the dry carbohydrate weight of fruit and vegetable cell walls. Currently there is no specialized model organism for studying pectin fermentation in the human colon, as our collective understanding is informed by versatile glycan-degrading bacteria rather than by specialist pectin degraders. Here we show that the genome of Monoglobus pectinilyticus possesses a highly specialized glycobiome for pectin degradation, unique amongst Firmicutes known to be in the human gut. Its genome encodes a simple set of metabolic pathways relevant to pectin sugar utilization, and its predicted glycobiome comprises an unusual distribution of carbohydrate-active enzymes (CAZymes) with numerous extracellular methyl/acetyl esterases and pectate lyases. We predict the M. pectinilyticus degradative process is facilitated by cell-surface S-layer homology (SLH) domain-containing proteins, which proteomics analysis shows are differentially expressed in response to pectin. Some of these abundant cell surface proteins of M. pectinilyticus share unique modular organizations rarely observed in human gut bacteria, featuring pectin-specific CAZyme domains and the cell wall-anchoring SLH motifs. We observed M. pectinilyticus degrades various pectins, RG-I, and galactan to produce polysaccharide degradation products (PDPs) which are presumably shared with other inhabitants of the human gut microbiome (HGM). This strain occupies a new ecological niche for a primary degrader specialized in foraging a habitually consumed plant glycan, thereby enriching our understanding of the diverse community profile of the HGM.",Carboxydotrophy potential of uncultivated Hydrothermarchaeota from the subseafloor crustal biosphere.,https://www.ncbi.nlm.nih.gov/pubmed/30728468,The ISME journal,2019 06 10,"The exploration of Earth's terrestrial subsurface biosphere has led to the discovery of several new archaeal lineages of evolutionary significance. Similarly, the deep subseafloor crustal biosphere also harbors many unique, uncultured archaeal taxa, including those belonging to Candidatus Hydrothermarchaeota, formerly known as Marine Benthic Group-E. Recently, Hydrothermarchaeota was identified as an abundant lineage of Juan de Fuca Ridge flank crustal fluids, suggesting its adaptation to this extreme environment. Through the investigation of single-cell and metagenome-assembled genomes, we provide insight into the lineage's evolutionary history and metabolic potential. Phylogenomic analysis reveals the Hydrothermarchaeota to be an early-branching archaeal phylum, branching between the superphylum DPANN, Euryarchaeota, and Asgard lineages. Hydrothermarchaeota genomes suggest a potential for dissimilative and assimilative carbon monoxide oxidation (carboxydotrophy), as well as sulfate and nitrate reduction. There is also a prevalence of chemotaxis and motility genes, indicating adaptive strategies for this nutrient-limited fluid-rock environment. These findings provide the first genomic interpretations of the Hydrothermarchaeota phylum and highlight the anoxic, hot, deep marine crustal biosphere as an important habitat for understanding the evolution of early life.",Simvastatin improves olanzapine-induced dyslipidemia in rats through inhibiting hepatic mTOR signaling pathway.,https://www.ncbi.nlm.nih.gov/pubmed/30728467,Acta pharmacologica Sinica,2019 02 07,"Second-generation antipsychotic drug (SGA)-induced metabolic abnormalities, such as dyslipidemia, are a major clinical problem for antipsychotic therapy. Accumulated evidences have shown the efficacy of statins in reducing SGA-induced dyslipidemia, but the underlying mechanisms are unclear. In this study, we explored whether mTOR signaling was involved in olanzapine (OLZ)-induced dyslipidemia as well as the lipid-lowering effects of cotreatment of simvastatin (Sim) in rats. Model rats received OLZ (1.0 mg/kg, t.i.d.) for 7 weeks; from the third week a group of model rats were cotreatment of Sim (3.0 mg/kg, t.i.d.) for 5 weeks. We found that OLZ treatment significantly increased the plasma triglyceride (TG) and total cholesterol (TC) levels, and promoted lipid accumulation in the liver, whereas cotreatment of Sim reversed OLZ-induced dyslipidemia. Hepatic mTORC1 and p-mTORC1 expression was accelerated in the OLZ treatment group, with upregulation of mRNA expression of sterol regulatory element-binding protein 1c (SREBP1c) and its target genes, whereas these alterations were ameliorated by Sim cotreatment. In HepG2 cells, rapamycin (a mTOR inhibitor) significantly reduced the OLZ-stimulated hepatocellular lipid contents and weakened the ability of Sim to lower lipids via a mechanism associated with the upregulation of SREBP1c-mediated de novo lipogenesis. Our data suggest that OLZ induces lipid accumulation in both plasma and liver, and Sim ameliorates OLZ-induced lipid metabolic dysfunction through its effects on mTOR signaling via reducing SREBP1c activation and the downregulation of gene expression involved in lipogenesis.

Nephrology,2019 04 23,"Uraemic syndrome (also known as uremic syndrome) in patients with advanced chronic kidney disease involves the accumulation in plasma of small-molecule uraemic solutes and uraemic toxins (also known as uremic toxins), dysfunction of multiple organs and dysbiosis of the gut microbiota. As such, uraemic syndrome can be viewed as a disease of perturbed inter-organ and inter-organism (host-microbiota) communication. Multiple biological pathways are affected, including those controlled by solute carrier (SLC) and ATP-binding cassette (ABC) transporters and drug-metabolizing enzymes, many of which are also involved in drug absorption, distribution, metabolism and elimination (ADME). The remote sensing and signalling hypothesis identifies SLC and ABC transporter-mediated communication between organs and/or between the host and gut microbiota as key to the homeostasis of metabolites, antioxidants, signalling molecules, microbiota-derived products and dietary components in body tissues and fluid compartments. Thus, this hypothesis provides a useful perspective on the pathobiology of uraemic syndrome. Pathways considered central to drug ADME might be particularly important for the body's attempts to restore homeostasis, including the correction of disturbances due to kidney injury and the accumulation of uraemic solutes and toxins. This Review discusses how the remote sensing and signalling hypothesis helps to provide a systems-level understanding of aspects of uraemia that could lead to novel approaches to its treatment.",Structures of the human spliceosomes before and after release of the ligated exon.,https://www.ncbi.nlm.nih.gov/pubmed/30728453,Cell research,2019 04 01,"Pre-mRNA splicing is executed by the spliceosome, which has eight major functional states each with distinct composition. Five of these eight human spliceosomal complexes, all preceding exon ligation, have been structurally characterized. In this study, we report the cryo-electron microscopy structures of the human post-catalytic spliceosome (P complex) and intron lariat spliceosome (ILS) at average resolutions of 3.0 and 2.9 Å, respectively. In the P complex, the ligated exon remains anchored to loop I of U5 small nuclear RNA, and the 3'-splice site is recognized by the junction between the 5'-splice site and the branch point sequence. The ATPase/helicase Prp22, along with the ligated exon and eight other proteins, are dissociated in the P-to-ILS transition. Intriguingly, the ILS complex exists in two distinct conformations, one with the ATPase/helicase Prp43 and one without. Comparison of these three late-stage human spliceosomes reveals mechanistic insights into exon release and spliceosome disassembly.","PARylation regulates stress granule dynamics, phase separation, and neurotoxicity of disease-related RNA-binding proteins.",https://www.ncbi.nlm.nih.gov/pubmed/30728452,Cell research,2019 02 27,"Mutations in RNA-binding proteins (RBPs) localized in ribonucleoprotein (RNP) granules, such as hnRNP A1 and TDP-43, promote aberrant protein aggregation, which is a pathological hallmark of various neurodegenerative diseases, such as amyotrophic lateral sclerosis (ALS) and frontotemporal dementia (FTD). Protein posttranslational modifications (PTMs) are known to regulate RNP granules. In this study, we investigate the function of poly(ADP-ribosyl)ation (PARylation), an important PTM involved in DNA damage repair and cell death, in RNP granule-related neurodegeneration. We reveal that PARylation levels are a major regulator of the assembly-disassembly dynamics of RNP granules containing disease-related RBPs, hnRNP A1 and TDP-43. We find that hnRNP A1 can both be PARylated and bind to PARylated proteins or poly(ADP-ribose) (PAR). We further uncover that PARylation of hnRNP A1 at K298 controls its nucleocytoplasmic transport, whereas PAR-binding via the PAR-binding motif (PBM) of hnRNP A1 regulates its association with stress granules. Moreover, we reveal that PAR not only dramatically enhances the liquid-liquid phase separation of hnRNP A1, but also promotes the co-phase separation of hnRNP A1 and TDP-43 in vitro and their interaction in vivo. Finally, both genetic and pharmacological inhibition of PARP mitigates hnRNP A1- and TDP-43-mediated neurotoxicity in cell and Drosophila models of ALS. Together, our findings suggest a novel and crucial role for PARylation in regulating the dynamics of RNP granules, and that dysregulation in PARylation and PAR levels may contribute to ALS disease pathogenesis by promoting protein aggregation.",Human marrow stromal cells secrete microRNA-375-containing exosomes to regulate glioma progression.,https://www.ncbi.nlm.nih.gov/pubmed/30728448,Cancer gene therapy,2019 02 07,"It is well established that human marrow stromal cells (hMSCs) can directly migrate towards tumor microenvironments associated with tumor formation and intracellular communication. Gene regulatory networks in tumors may be targeted by microRNAs (miRNAs), especially those derived in exosomes from hMSCs. However, the potential functional roles of hMSCs in glioma cell growth still remain controversial. Therefore, this study aimed at exploring the regulatory mechanisms of hMSC exosomal microRNA-375 (miR-375) in glioma. Microarray analysis was used to initially screen out glioma-related genes. The interaction between miR-375 and solute carrier family 31 member 1 (SLC31A1) was confirmed by dual-luciferase reporter gene assay. miR-375 and SLC31A1 expression in glioma cells were determined. Glioma cells were initially exposed to exosomes derived from hMSCs treated with miR-375. Subsequently, the rates of proliferation, migration, invasion and apoptosis were determined in glioma cells using in vitro assays. The effects of exosomal miR-375 from hMSCs on tumor growth in vivo were also measured using xenograft tumor in nude mice. We found that miR-375 and SLC31A1 showed significantly lower and higher expression of glioma cells respectively. Additionally, restored miR-375 expression resulted in suppressed cell proliferation, migration and invasion, and increased apoptosis by targeting SLC31A1. Next, in vitro experiments demonstrated that hMSC-derived exosomes overexpressing miR-375 promoted apoptosis while suppressing proliferation, migration and invasion. Furthermore, in vivo experiments confirmed the negative regulatory effects of hMSC-derived exosomes with overexpressed miR-375. We conclude that exosomal miR-375 from hMSCs inhibits glioma cell progression through SLC31A1 suppression, and ultimately serves as a potential target in the treatment of gliomas.",Cues play a critical role in estrous cycle-dependent enhancement of cocaine reinforcement.,https://www.ncbi.nlm.nih.gov/pubmed/30728447,Neuropsychopharmacology : official publication of the American College of Neuropsychopharmacology,2019 05 22,"While preclinical work has aimed to outline the neural mechanisms of drug addiction, it has overwhelmingly focused on male subjects. There has been a push in recent years to incorporate females into existing addiction models; however, males and females often have different behavioral strategies, making it important to not only include females, but to develop models that assess the factors that comprise female drug addiction. Traditional self-administration models often include light or tone cues that serve as discriminative stimuli and/or consequent stimuli, making it nearly impossible to disentangle the effects of cue learning, the cues themselves, and acute effects of psychostimulant drugs. To disentangle the interaction between drug-associated cues and the consummatory and appetitive responding driven by cocaine, we have developed a new behavioral procedure that combines Pavlovian-instrumental transfer with behavioral economic analysis. This task can be completed within a single session, allowing for studies looking at estrous cycle stage-dependent effects in intact cycling females, something that has been difficult in the past. In this study, we found no differences in self-administration across the estrous cycle in the absence of cues; however, when cues were introduced, the cues that acquired value during estrus-but not during diestrus or in males-increased motivation. Cues paired during estrus also increased c-fos expression to a greater extent in striatal regions, an effect that may underlie the observed increases in seeking induced by these cues, even weeks later. Together, these data suggest that fundamental differences in the motivational properties of psychostimulant drugs between males and females are complex and are driven primarily by the interaction between drug-associated stimuli and drug effects.",Learning curves and teaching when acquiring nut-cracking in humans and chimpanzees.,https://www.ncbi.nlm.nih.gov/pubmed/30728446,Scientific reports,2019 02 10,"Humans are considered superior to other species in their tool using skills. However, most of our knowledge about animals comes from observations in artificial conditions with individuals removed from their natural environment. We present a first comparison of humans and chimpanzees spontaneously acquiring the same technique as they forage in their natural environment. We compared the acquisition of the Panda nut-cracking technique between Mbendjele foragers from the Republic of Congo and the Taï chimpanzees from Côte d'Ivoire. Both species initially acquire the technique slowly with similar kinds of mistakes, with years of practice required for the apprentice to become expert. Chimpanzees more rapidly acquired the technique when an apprentice, and reached adult efficiency earlier than humans. Adult efficiencies in both species did not differ significantly. Expert-apprentice interactions showed many similar instances of teaching in both species, with more variability in humans due, in part to their more complex technique. While in humans, teaching occurred both vertically and obliquely, only the former existed in chimpanzees. This comparison of the acquisition of a natural technique clarifies how the two species differed in their technical intelligence. Furthermore, our observations support the idea of teaching in both species being more frequent for difficult skills.",Baroreceptor activity and sensitivity: normal values in children and young adults using the head up tilt test.,https://www.ncbi.nlm.nih.gov/pubmed/30728445,Pediatric research,2019 05 01,"Baroreceptor function in children and adolescents has not been well studied in the current literature, with a lack of agreed upon normal values.

Reported rates range from 0.97 to 10.6 per 100,000 live births. Women murdered in the perinatal period constituted a highly vulnerable group: they were younger, more likely to be from minority ethnic groups, and unmarried. Domestic violence was a significant risk factor for attempted and completed homicide. Compared to other countries, pregnancy-associated homicide rates were highest in the US. It is unclear how much of the difference to attribute to better case identification or to actual risk. Our review demonstrates pregnancy-associated homicide is an important contributor to maternal mortality, with rates comparable to suicide. Central to any prevention strategy will be identification of those at risk. The predictions are very weak because definitions, data collection, and analysis are so variable from study to study. Our findings reinforce the importance of screening for current and previous domestic violence.",Evidence of higher intramyocellular fat among normal and overweight Indians with prediabetes.,https://www.ncbi.nlm.nih.gov/pubmed/30728443,European journal of clinical nutrition,2019 03 29,"The rise in prevalence rates of Type 2 Diabetes among Indians is well recognized.

In the present investigation we identified a specific plant extract and its constituents as a potential alternative natural solution for preventing and reducing both brain ""plaques and tangles"". PTI-00703 cat's claw (Uncaria tomentosa from a specific Peruvian source), a specific and natural plant extract from the Amazon rain forest, was identified as a potent inhibitor and reducer of both beta-amyloid fibrils (the main component of ""plaques"") and tau protein paired helical filaments/fibrils (the main component of ""tangles""). PTI-00703 cat's claw demonstrated both the ability to prevent formation/aggregation and disaggregate preformed Aβ fibrils (1-42 and 1-40) and tau protein tangles/filaments. The disaggregation/dissolution of Aβ fibrils occurred nearly instantly when PTI-00703 cat's claw and Aβ fibrils were mixed together as shown by a variety of methods including Thioflavin T fluorometry, Congo red staining, Thioflavin S fluorescence and electron microscopy. Sophisticated structural elucidation studies identified the major fractions and specific constituents within PTI-00703 cat's claw responsible for both the observed ""plaque"" and ""tangle"" inhibitory and reducing activity. Specific proanthocyanidins (i.e. epicatechin dimers and variants thereof) are newly identified polyphenolic components within Uncaria tomentosa that possess both ""plaque and tangle"" reducing and inhibitory activity. One major identified specific polyphenol within PTI-00703 cat's claw was epicatechin-4β-8-epicatechin (i.e. an epicatechin dimer known as proanthocyanidin B2) that markedly reduced brain plaque load and improved short-term memory in younger and older APP ""plaque-producing"" (TASD-41) transgenic mice (bearing London and Swedish mutations). Proanthocyanidin B2 was also a potent inhibitor of brain inflammation as shown by reduction in astrocytosis and gliosis in TASD-41 transgenic mice. Blood-brain-barrier studies in Sprague-Dawley rats and CD-1 mice indicated that the major components of PTI-00703 cat's claw crossed the blood-brain-barrier and entered the brain parenchyma within 2 minutes of being in the blood. The discovery of a natural plant extract from the Amazon rain forest plant (i.e. Uncaria tomentosa or cat's claw) as both a potent ""plaque and tangle"" inhibitor and disaggregator is postulated to represent a potential breakthrough for the natural treatment of both normal brain aging and Alzheimer's disease."

Particle detectors made of GaN are beneficial as devices simultaneously generating of the optical and electrical signals. Photon-electron coupling cross-section is a parameter which relates radiation absorption and emission characteristics. On the other hand, photon-electron coupling cross-section together with photo-ionization energy are fingerprints of deep centres in material. In this work, the wafer fragments of the GaN grown by ammonothermal (AT) technology are studied to reveal the dominant defects introduced by growth procedures and reactor neutron irradiations in a wide range, 1012-1016 cm-2, of fluences.

While the adult North American bullfrog (Rana [Lithobates] catesbeiana) is a prolific source of high-potency AMPs, the aquatic tadpole represents a relatively untapped source for new AMP discovery. The recent publication of the bullfrog genome and transcriptomic resources provides an opportune bridge between known AMPs and bioinformatics-based AMP discovery. The objective of the present study was to identify novel AMPs with therapeutic potential using a combined bioinformatics and wet lab-based approach. In the present study, we identified seven novel AMP precursor-encoding transcripts expressed in the tadpole. Comparison of their amino acid sequences with known AMPs revealed evidence of mature peptide sequence conservation with variation in the prepro sequence. Two mature peptide sequences were unique and demonstrated bacteriostatic and bactericidal activity against Mycobacteria but not Gram-negative or Gram-positive bacteria. Nine known and seven novel AMP-encoding transcripts were detected in premetamorphic tadpole back skin, olfactory epithelium, liver, and/or tail fin. Treatment of tadpoles with 10 nM 3,5,3'-triiodothyronine for 48 h did not affect transcript abundance in the back skin, and had limited impact on these transcripts in the other three tissues. Gene mapping revealed considerable diversity in size (1.6-15 kbp) and exon number (one to four) of AMP-encoding genes with clear evidence of alternative splicing leading to both prepro and mature amino acid sequence diversity. These findings verify the accuracy and utility of the bullfrog genome assembly, and set a firm foundation for bioinformatics-based AMP discovery.","Increased adiposity, inflammation, metabolic disruption and dyslipidemia in adult male offspring of DOSS treated C57BL/6 dams.",https://www.ncbi.nlm.nih.gov/pubmed/30728429,Scientific reports,2019 02 12,"Evidence indicates that obesity can be promoted by chemical 'obesogens' that drive adiposity, hunger, inflammation and suppress metabolism. Dioctyl sodium sulfosuccinate (DOSS), a lipid emulsifier and candidate obesogen in vitro, is widely used in processed foods, cosmetics and as stool softener medicines commonly used during pregnancy. In vivo testing of DOSS was performed in a developmental origins of adult obesity model. Pregnant mice were orally administered vehicle control or DOSS at times and doses comparable to stool softener use during human pregnancy. All weaned offspring consumed only standard diet. Adult male but not female offspring of DOSS-treated dams showed significantly increased body mass, overall and visceral fat masses, and decreased bone area. They exhibited significant decreases in plasma adiponectin and increases in leptin, glucose intolerance and hyperinsulinemia. Inflammatory IL-6 was elevated, as was adipose Cox2 and Nox4 gene expressions, which may be associated with promoter DNA methylation changes. Multiple significant phospholipid/sterol lipid increases paralleled profiles from long-term high-fat diet induced obesity in males. Collectively, developmental DOSS exposure leads to increased adult adiposity, inflammation, metabolic disorder and dyslipidemia in offspring fed a standard diet, suggesting that pharmaceutical and other sources of DOSS taken during human pregnancy might contribute to long-term obesity-related health concerns in offspring.",The cytochrome P450 CYP6DE1 catalyzes the conversion of α-pinene into the mountain pine beetle aggregation pheromone trans-verbenol.,https://www.ncbi.nlm.nih.gov/pubmed/30728428,Scientific reports,2019 02 10,"The recent outbreak of the mountain pine beetle (Dendroctonus ponderosae; MPB) has affected over 20 M hectares of pine forests in western North America. During the colonization of host trees, female MPB release the aggregation pheromone (-)-trans-verbenol. (-)-trans-Verbenol is thought to be produced from the pine defense compound (-)-α-pinene by cytochrome P450 (P450) dependent hydroxylation. MPB may also use P450s for the detoxification of other monoterpenes of the pine defense system. Here we describe the functional characterization of MPB CYP6DE1. CYP6DE1, but not the closely related CYP6DE2, used the bicyclic monoterpenes (-)-α-pinene, (+)-α-pinene, (-)-β-pinene, (+)-β-pinene and (+)-3-carene as substrates. CYP6DE1 was not active with other monoterpenes or diterpene resin acids that were tested as substrates. trans-Verbenol is the major product of CYP6DE1 activity with (-)-α-pinene or (+)-α-pinene as substrates. When tested with blends of different ratios of (-)-α-pinene and (+)-α-pinene, CYP6DE1 produced trans-verbenol with an enantiomeric profile that was similar to that produced by female MPB exposed to the α-pinene enantiomers.",Characterization of a family mutation in the 5' untranslated region of the endoglin gene causative of hereditary hemorrhagic telangiectasia.,https://www.ncbi.nlm.nih.gov/pubmed/30728427,Journal of human genetics,2019 03 14,"Hereditary hemorrhagic telangiectasia (HHT) is a vascular disease characterized by nose and gastrointestinal bleeding, telangiectases in skin and mucosa, and arteriovenous malformations in major internal organs. Most patients carry a mutation in the coding region of the endoglin (ENG) or activin A receptor type II-1 (ACVRL1) gene. Nonetheless, in around 15% of patients, sequencing analysis and duplication/deletion tests fail to pinpoint mutations in the coding regions of these genes. In these cases, it has been shown that sequencing of the 5'-untranslated region (5'UTR) of ENG may be useful to identify novel mutations in the ENG non-coding region. Here we report the genetic characterization and functional analysis of the heterozygous mutation c.-142A>T in the 5'UTR region of ENG found in a family with several members affected by HHT. This variant gives rise to a new initiation codon of the protein that involves the change in its open reading frame. Transfection studies in monkey cells using endoglin expression vectors demonstrated that c-142A>T mutation results in a clear reduction in the levels of the endoglin protein. These results support the inclusion of the 5'UTR of ENG in the standard genetic testing for HHT to increase its sensitivity.",Analysis and Predictability of Drought In Northwest Africa Using Optical and Microwave Satellite Remote Sensing Products.,https://www.ncbi.nlm.nih.gov/pubmed/30728426,Scientific reports,2019 02 10,"In a context of high stress on water resources and agricultural production at the global level, together with climate change marked by an increase in the frequency of these events, drought is considered to be a strong threat both socially and economically. The Mediterranean region is a hot spot of climate change; it is also characterized by a scarcity of water resources that places intense pressure on agricultural productivity. This article analyzes the potential for using multiple remote sensing tools in the quantification and predictability of drought in Northwest Africa. Three satellite products are considered: the Normalized Difference Vegetation Index (NDVI), Soil Moisture Index (SWI), and Land Surface Temperature (LST). A discussion of the variability of these products and their inter-correlation is presented, illustrating a generally high consistency between them. Statistical anomaly indices are then computed and a drought severity mapping is presented. The results illustrate in particular a high percentage of dry conditions in the region studied during the last ten years (2007-2017). Finally, we propose the use of the analog statistical approach to identify similar evolutions of the three variables in the past.

Several computational methods associated with mature miRNA identification suffer various limitations involving canonical biological features extraction, class imbalance, and classifier performance. The proposed classifier, miRFinder, is an accurate alternative for the identification of mature miRNAs. The structured-sequence features were proposed to precisely extract miRNA biological features, and three algorithms were selected to obtain the canonical features based on the classifier performance. Moreover, the center of mass near distance training based on K-means was provided to improve the class imbalance problem. In particular, the AdaBoost-SVM algorithm was used to construct the classifier. The classifier training process focuses on incorrectly classified samples, and the integrated results use the common decision strategies of the weak classifier with different weights. In addition, the all mature miRNA sites were predicted by different classifiers based on the features of different sites.

Sequenced reads were analyzed using QIIME and R. The eight methods yielded significantly different quantities of DNA (p < 0.001), with the phenol-chloroform extraction method producing the highest total yield. There were no significant differences in observed bacterial or fungal Shannon diversity (p = 0.64, p = 0.93 respectively) by extraction method. Bray-Curtis beta-diversity did not demonstrate statistically significant differences between the eight extraction methods based on bacterial (R2 = 0.086, p = 1.00) and fungal (R2 = 0.039, p = 1.00) assays. No differences were seen between methods with or without bead-beating.

CD97 has been shown previously to stimulate angiogenesis by interacting with integrins on endothelial cells via an Arginine-Glycine-Aspartic acid (RGD) motif. In this report, the role of the RGD motif in tumor cell adhesion and apoptosis was investigated using a previously-established HT1080 cell-based system. We found that the RGD motif is critical in CD97-promoted cell adhesion, in part due to the up-regulation of αvβ5 and α2β1 integrins, and that CD97 mediates its anti-apoptotic effect in extrinsic apoptosis via RGD-dependent cell adhesion. In contrast, CD97-modulated anti-apoptotic effect in intrinsic apoptosis is mediated by RGD-independent, N-cadherin-induced homotypic cell aggregation. Hence, CD97 promotes tumorigenesis via RGD-dependent and -independent mechanisms.",Arabidopsis HUA ENHANCER 4 delays flowering by upregulating the MADS-box repressor genes FLC and MAF4.,https://www.ncbi.nlm.nih.gov/pubmed/30728422,Scientific reports,2019 02 10,"The adaptive success of flowering plants is largely due to their ability to align floral production with optimal conditions. In Arabidopsis thaliana, MADS-box repressors of the FLC/MAF-clade prevent flowering under non-inductive conditions, although the role of some members is not yet clearly defined. Using a genetic strategy, we identified the KH-domain gene HEN4, previously shown to be involved in MADS-box floral homeotic gene regulation, as a modulator of flowering time. Loss-of-function hen4 mutants are early-flowering, and their response to low growth-temperature (16 °C) and day-length is altered. Interestingly, hen4 plants showed dramatic reduction of FLC and MAF4 transcripts, whereas other flowering repressors of the same clade (FLM, MAF2, MAF3, MAF5) remained unaltered. We also determined that hen4, partly due to loss of FLC, accelerates the vegetative phase-change. This report provides insight into flowering time control and highlights the potential of versatile regulators such as HEN4 to coordinate the juvenile-to-adult transition and floral timing."

Subjects homozygous for the minor allele of rs1801260 were less frequently overweight (p = 0.046), had higher fasting glucose levels (p = 0.037), better scores at the Clock Drawing Test (CDT) (p = 0.047) and worse scores at the Geriatric Depression Scale (p = 0.032). Subjects homozygous for the minor allele of rs11932595 showed higher fasting glucose levels (p = 0.044) and better scores at CDT (p = 0.030). Conversely, subjects homozygous for the minor allele of rs4580704 showed higher triglyceride (p = 0.012), and LDL-cholesterol levels (p = 0.44), and a greater adherence to the Mediterranean diet (MD) (p = 0.044). In addition, AAC, AAG, GGC and AGC (rs1801260-rs11932595-rs4580704) haplotypes were analyzed: AAG was associated with higher risk of overweight (p = 0.008), hypertriglyceridemia (p = 0.040) and hypercholesterolemia (p = 0.036); GGC with lower risk of hyperglycemia (p = 0.022), better sleep pattern (p = 0.001) and with better score at mini-mental state examination (p = 0.010); AGC with lower risk of depression (p = 0.026) and AAC with lower adherence to the MD (p = 0.028). Therefore, CLOCK gene polymorphisms let us hypothesize an involvement in the quality of aging in a cohort of nonagenarians.","Interplay between lipid lateral diffusion, dye concentration and membrane permeability unveiled by a combined spectroscopic and computational study of a model lipid bilayer.",https://www.ncbi.nlm.nih.gov/pubmed/30728410,Scientific reports,2019 02 10,"Lipid lateral diffusion in membrane bilayers is a fundamental process exploited by cells to enable complex protein structural and dynamic reorganizations. For its importance, lipid mobility in both cellular and model bilayers has been extensively investigated in recent years, especially through the application of time-resolved, fluorescence-based, optical microscopy techniques. However, one caveat of fluorescence techniques is the need to use dye-labeled variants of the lipid of interest, thus potentially perturbing the structural and dynamic properties of the native species. Generally, the effect of the dye/tracer molecule is implicitly assumed to be negligible. Nevertheless, in view of the widespread use of optically modified lipids for studying lipid bilayer dynamics, it is highly desirable to well assess this point. Here, fluorescence correlation spectroscopy (FCS) and molecular dynamics (MD) simulations have been combined together to uncover subtle structural and dynamic effects in DOPC planar membranes enriched with a standard Rhodamine-labeled lipid. Our findings support a non-neutral role of the dye-labeled lipids in diffusion experiments, quantitatively estimating a decrease in lipid mobility of up to 20% with respect to the unlabeled species. Moreover, results highlight the existing interplay between dye concentration, lipid lateral diffusion and membrane permeability, thus suggesting possible implications for future optical microscopy studies of biophysical processes occurring at the membrane level.",Diversity of spotted fever group rickettsiae and their association with host ticks in Japan.,https://www.ncbi.nlm.nih.gov/pubmed/30728409,Scientific reports,2019 02 10,"Spotted fever group (SFG) rickettsiae are obligate intracellular Gram-negative bacteria mainly associated with ticks. In Japan, several hundred cases of Japanese spotted fever, caused by Rickettsia japonica, are reported annually. Other Rickettsia species are also known to exist in ixodid ticks; however, their phylogenetic position and pathogenic potential are poorly understood. We conducted a nationwide cross-sectional survey on questing ticks to understand the overall diversity of SFG rickettsiae in Japan. Out of 2,189 individuals (19 tick species in 4 genera), 373 (17.0%) samples were positive for Rickettsia spp. as ascertained by real-time PCR amplification of the citrate synthase gene (gltA). Conventional PCR and sequencing analyses of gltA indicated the presence of 15 different genotypes of SFG rickettsiae. Based on the analysis of five additional genes, we characterised five Rickettsia species; R. asiatica, R. helvetica, R. monacensis (formerly reported as Rickettsia sp. In56 in Japan), R. tamurae, and Candidatus R. tarasevichiae and several unclassified SFG rickettsiae. We also found a strong association between rickettsial genotypes and their host tick species, while there was little association between rickettsial genotypes and their geographical origins. These observations suggested that most of the SFG rickettsiae have a limited host range and are maintained in certain tick species in the natural environment.",Genome-wide profiling of human papillomavirus DNA integration in liquid-based cytology specimens from a Gabonese female population using HPV capture technology.,https://www.ncbi.nlm.nih.gov/pubmed/30728408,Scientific reports,2019 02 10,"Human papillomavirus (HPV) is recognised as the cause of precancerous and cancerous cervical lesions. Furthermore, in high-grade lesions, HPV is frequently integrated in the host cell genome and associated with the partial or complete loss of the E1 and E2 genes, which regulate the activity of viral oncoproteins E6 and E7. In this study, using a double-capture system followed by high-throughput sequencing, we determined the HPV integration status present in liquid-based cervical smears in an urban Gabonese population. The main inclusion criteria were based on cytological grade and the detection of the HPV16 genotype using molecular assays. The rate of HPV integration in the host genome varied with cytological grade: 85.7% (6/7), 71.4% (5/7), 66.7% (2/3) 60% (3/5) and 30.8% (4/13) for carcinomas, HSIL, ASCH, LSIL and ASCUS, respectively. For high cytological grades (carcinomas and HSIL), genotypes HPV16 and 18 represented 92.9% of the samples (13/14). The integrated form of HPV16 genotype was mainly found in high-grade lesions in 71.4% of samples regardless of cytological grade. Minority genotypes (HPV33, 51, 58 and 59) were found in LSIL samples, except HPV59, which was identified in one HSIL sample. Among all the HPV genotypes identified after double capture, 10 genotypes (HPV30, 35, 39, 44, 45, 53, 56, 59, 74 and 82) were detected only in episomal form. Our study revealed that the degree of HPV integration varies with cervical cytological grade. The integration event might be a potential clinical prognostic biomarker for the prediction of the progression of neoplastic lesions.",Paternal leakage and mtDNA heteroplasmy in Rhipicephalus spp. ticks.,https://www.ncbi.nlm.nih.gov/pubmed/30728407,Scientific reports,2019 02 10,"Paternal leakage of mitochondrial DNA (mtDNA) and heteroplasmy have been recently described in several animal species. In arthropods, by searching in the Scopus database, we found only 23 documented cases of paternal leakage. Therefore, although arthropods represent a large fraction of animal biodiversity, this phenomenon has been investigated only in a paucity of species in this phylum, thus preventing a reliable estimate of its frequency. Here, we investigated the occurrence of paternal leakage and mtDNA heteroplasmy in ticks belonging to one of the most significant tick species complexes, the so-called Rhipicephalus sanguineus sensu lato. By developing a multiplex allele-specific PCR assay targeting a fragment of the 12S rRNA ribosomal region of the mtDNA, we showed the occurrence of paternal leakage and mtDNA heteroplasmy in R. sanguineus s.l. ticks originated from experimental crosses, as well as in individuals collected from the field. Our results add a new evidence of paternal leakage in arthropods and document for the first time this phenomenon in ticks. Furthermore, they suggest the importance of using allele-specific assays when searching for paternal leakage and/or heteroplasmy, as standard sequencing methods may fail to detect the rare mtDNA molecules.","Plasmodium falciparum specific helicase 2 is a dual, bipolar helicase and is crucial for parasite growth.",https://www.ncbi.nlm.nih.gov/pubmed/30728406,Scientific reports,2019 02 10,Human malaria infection is a major challenge across the globe and is responsible for millions of deaths annually. Rapidly emerging drug resistant strains against the new class of anti-malarial drugs are major threat to control the disease burden worldwide. Helicases are present in every organism and have important role in various nucleic acid metabolic processes. Previously we have reported the presence of three parasite specific helicases (PSH) in Plasmodium falciparum 3D7 strain. Here we present the detailed biochemical characterization of PfPSH2. PfPSH2 is DNA and RNA stimulated ATPase and is able to unwind partially duplex DNA and RNA substrates. It can translocate in both 3' to 5' and 5' to 3' directions. PfPSH2 is expressed in all the stages of intraerythrocytic development and it is localized in cytoplasm in P. falciparum 3D7 strain. The dsRNA mediated inhibition study suggests that PfPSH2 is important for the growth and survival of the parasite. This study presents the detailed characterization of PfPSH2 and lays the foundation for future development of PfPSH2 as drug target.,Differential expression of CXCR3 and CCR6 on CD4+ T-lymphocytes with distinct memory phenotypes characterizes tuberculosis-associated immune reconstitution inflammatory syndrome.,https://www.ncbi.nlm.nih.gov/pubmed/30728405,Scientific reports,2019 06 10,"Immune reconstitution inflammatory syndrome (IRIS) occurs in up to 40% of individuals co-infected with pulmonary tuberculosis (PTB) and HIV, primarily upon antiretroviral therapy (ART) initiation. Phenotypic changes in T-cells during TB-IRIS and their relationship with systemic inflammation are not fully understood. In this prospective cohort study, we followed 48 HIV-positive patients with PTB from South India before and after ART initiation, examining T-lymphocyte subsets and inflammatory biomarkers in peripheral blood. Quantification of naïve (CD27+CD45RO-) as well as effector memory CD4+ T cells (CD27-CD45RO+) at weeks 2-6 after ART initiation could distinguish TB-IRIS from non-IRIS individuals. Additional analyses revealed that ART reconstituted different quantities of CD4+ T lymphocyte subsets with preferential expansion of CXCR3+ CCR6- cells in TB-IRIS patients. Moreover, there was an expansion and functional restoration of central memory (CD27+CD45RO+) CXCR3+CCR6- CD4+ lymphocytes and corresponding cytokines, with reduction in CXCR3-CCR6+ cells after ART initiation only in those who developed TB-IRIS. Together, these observations trace a detailed picture of CD4+ T cell subsets tightly associated with IRIS, which may serve as targets for prophylactic and/or therapeutic interventions in the future.",Genome reorganization of the GmSHMT gene family in soybean showed a lack of functional redundancy in resistance to soybean cyst nematode.,https://www.ncbi.nlm.nih.gov/pubmed/30728404,Scientific reports,2019 02 10,"In soybeans, eighteen members constitute the serine hydroxymethyltransferase (GmSHMT) gene family, of which the cytosolic-targeted GmSHMT08c member has been reported to mediate resistance to soybean cyst nematode (SCN). This work presents a comprehensive study of the SHMT gene family members, including synteny, phylogeny, subcellular localizations, haplotypes, protein homology modeling, mutational, and expression analyses. Phylogenetic analysis showed that SHMT genes are divided into four classes reflecting their subcellular distribution (cytosol, nucleus, mitochondrion, and chloroplast). Subcellular localization of selected GmSHMT members supports their in-silico predictions and phylogenetic distribution. Expression and functional analyses showed that GmSHMT genes display many overlapping, but some divergent responses during SCN infection. Furthermore, mutational analysis reveals that all isolated EMS mutants that lose their resistance to SCN carry missense and nonsense mutations at the GmSHMT08c, but none of the Gmshmt08c mutants carried mutations in the other GmSHMT genes. Haplotype clustering analysis using the whole genome resequencing data from a collection of 106 diverse soybean germplams (15X) was performed to identify allelic variants and haplotypes within the GmSHMT gene family. Interestingly, only the cytosolic-localized GmSHMT08c presented SNP clusters that were associated with SCN resistance, supporting our mutational analysis. Although eight GmSHMT members respond to the nematode infestation, functional and mutational analysis has shown the absence of functional redundancy in resistance to SCN. Structural analysis and protein homology modeling showed the presence of spontaneous mutations at important residues within the GmSHMT proteins, suggesting the presence of altered enzyme activities based on substrate affinities. Due to the accumulation of mutations during the evolution of the soybean genome, the other GmSHMT members have undergone neofunctionalization and subfunctionalization events.",Learning the Dynamic Treatment Regimes from Medical Registry Data through Deep Q-network.,https://www.ncbi.nlm.nih.gov/pubmed/30728403,Scientific reports,2019 02 10,"This paper presents the deep reinforcement learning (DRL) framework to estimate the optimal Dynamic Treatment Regimes from observational medical data. This framework is more flexible and adaptive for high dimensional action and state spaces than existing reinforcement learning methods to model real-life complexity in heterogeneous disease progression and treatment choices, with the goal of providing doctors and patients the data-driven personalized decision recommendations. The proposed DRL framework comprises (i) a supervised learning step to predict expert actions, and (ii) a deep reinforcement learning step to estimate the long-term value function of Dynamic Treatment Regimes. Both steps depend on deep neural networks. As a key motivational example, we have implemented the proposed framework on a data set from the Center for International Bone Marrow Transplant Research (CIBMTR) registry database, focusing on the sequence of prevention and treatments for acute and chronic graft versus host disease after transplantation. In the experimental results, we have demonstrated promising accuracy in predicting human experts' decisions, as well as the high expected reward function in the DRL-based dynamic treatment regimes.",FOXM1 modulates 5-FU resistance in colorectal cancer through regulating TYMS expression.,https://www.ncbi.nlm.nih.gov/pubmed/30728402,Scientific reports,2019 05 15,"Resistance to 5-Fluoruracil (5-FU) has been linked to elevated expression of the main target, thymidylate synthase (TYMS), which catalyses the de novo pathway for production of deoxythymidine monophosphate. The potent oncogenic forkhead box transcription factor, FOXM1 is is regulated by E2F1 which also controls TYMS. This study reveals a significant role of FOXM1 in 5-FU resistance. Overexpression and knock-down studies of FOXM1 in colon cancer cells suggest the importance of FOXM1 in TYMS regulation. ChIP and global ChIP-seq data also confirms that FOXM1 can also potentially regulate other 5-FU targets, such as TYMS, thymidine kinase 1 (TK-1) and thymidine phosphorylase (TYMP). In human colorectal cancer tissue specimens, a strong correlation of FOXM1 and TYMS staining was observed. Elevated FOXM1 and TYMS expression was also observed in acquired 5-FU resistant colon cancer cells (HCT116 5-FU Res). A synergistic effect was observed following treatment of CRC cells with an inhibitor of FOXM1, thiostrepton, in combination with 5-FU. The combination treatment decreased colony formation and migration, and induced cell cycle arrest, DNA damage, and apoptosis in CRC cell lines. In summary, this research demonstrated that FOXM1 plays a pivotal role in 5-FU resistance at least partially through the regulation of TYMS."

However, reports on the mode of action and detail mechanism of eupatorin in vitro in breast cancer disease are limited. Hence, eupatorin's effect on the human breast carcinoma cell line MCF-7 and MDA-MB-231 was investigated. MTT assay showed that eupatorin had cytotoxic effects on MCF-7 and MDA-MB-231 cells but was non-toxic to the normal cells of MCF-10a in a time-dose dependent manner. At 24 h, the eupatorin showed mild cytotoxicity on both MCF-7 and MDA-MB-231 cells with IC50 values higher than 20 μg/mL. After 48 h, eupatorin at 5 μg/mL inhibited the proliferation of MCF-7 and MDA-MB-231 cells by 50% while the IC50 of MCF-10a was significantly (p < 0.05) high with 30 μg/mL. The concentration of eupatorin at 5 μg/mL induced apoptosis mainly through intrinsic pathway by facilitating higher fold of caspase 9 compared to caspase 8 at 48 h. The cell cycle profile also showed that eupatorin (5 μg/mL) exerted anti-proliferation activity with the cell cycle arrest of MCF-7 and MDA-MB-231 cells at sub Gθ/G1 in a time-dependent manner. In addition, wound healing assay showed an incomplete wound closure of scratched MDA-MB-231 cells, and more than 60% of the MDA-MB-231 cells were prevented to migrate and invade the membrane in the Boyden chamber after 24 h. Eupatorin also inhibited angiogenic sprouting of new blood vessels in ex vivo mouse aorta ring assay. In gene expression assay, eupatorin up-regulated pro-apoptotic genes such as Bak1, HIF1A, Bax, Bad, cytochrome c and SMAC/Diablo and blocked the Phospho-Akt pathway. In conclusion, eupatorin is a potent candidate to induce apoptosis and concurrently inhibit the invasion, migration and angiogenesis of MDA-MB-231 and MCF-7 cells through inhibition of Phospho-Akt pathway and cell cycle blockade.",Accelerating small-angle scattering experiments on anisotropic samples using kernel density estimation.,https://www.ncbi.nlm.nih.gov/pubmed/30728390,Scientific reports,2019 02 10,"We propose a method to accelerate small-angle scattering experiments by exploiting spatial correlation in two-dimensional data. We applied kernel density estimation to the average of a hundred short scans and evaluated noise reduction effects of kernel density estimation (smoothing). Although there is no advantage of using smoothing for isotropic data due to the powerful noise reduction effect of radial averaging, smoothing with a statistically and physically appropriate kernel can shorten measurement time by less than half to obtain sector averages with comparable statistical quality to that of sector averages without smoothing. This benefit will encourage researchers not to use full radial average on anisotropic data sacrificing anisotropy for statistical quality. We also confirmed that statistically reasonable estimation of measurement time is feasible on site by evaluating how intensity variances improve with accumulating counts. The noise reduction effect of smoothing will bring benefits to a wide range of applications from efficient use of beamtime at laboratories and large experimental facilities to stroboscopic measurements suffering low statistical quality.",Phage therapy against Pseudomonas aeruginosa infections in a cystic fibrosis zebrafish model.,https://www.ncbi.nlm.nih.gov/pubmed/30728389,Scientific reports,2019 02 10,"Cystic fibrosis (CF) is a hereditary disease due to mutations in the CFTR gene and causes mortality in humans mainly due to respiratory infections caused by Pseudomonas aeruginosa. In a previous work we used phage therapy, which is a treatment with a mix of phages, to actively counteract acute P. aeruginosa infections in mice and Galleria mellonella larvae. In this work we apply phage therapy to the treatment of P. aeruginosa PAO1 infections in a CF zebrafish model. The structure of the CFTR channel is evolutionary conserved between fish and mammals and cftr-loss-of-function zebrafish embryos show a phenotype that recapitulates the human disease, in particular with destruction of the pancreas. We show that phage therapy is able to decrease lethality, bacterial burden, and the pro-inflammatory response caused by PAO1 infection. In addition, phage administration relieves the constitutive inflammatory state of CF embryos. To our knowledge, this is the first time that phage therapy is used to cure P. aeruginosa infections in a CF animal model. We also find that the curative effect against PAO1 infections is improved by combining phages and antibiotic treatments, opening a useful therapeutic approach that could reduce antibiotic doses and time of administration.",Functional annotation of putative QTL associated with black tea quality and drought tolerance traits.,https://www.ncbi.nlm.nih.gov/pubmed/30728388,Scientific reports,2019 02 10,"The understanding of black tea quality and percent relative water content (%RWC) traits in tea (Camellia sinensis) by a quantitative trait loci (QTL) approach can be useful in elucidation and identification of candidate genes underlying the QTL which has remained to be difficult. The objective of the study was to identify putative QTL controlling black tea quality and percent relative water traits in two tea populations and their F1 progeny. A total of 1,421 DArTseq markers derived from the linkage map identified 53 DArTseq markers to be linked to black tea quality and %RWC. All 53 DArTseq markers with unique best hits were identified in the tea genome. A total of 5,592 unigenes were assigned gene ontology (GO) terms, 56% comprised biological processes, cellular component (29%) and molecular functions (15%), respectively. A total of 84 unigenes in 15 LGs were assigned to 25 different Kyoto Encyclopedia of Genes and Genomes (KEGG) database pathways based on categories of secondary metabolite biosynthesis. The three major enzymes identified were transferases (38.9%), hydrolases (29%) and oxidoreductases (18.3%). The putative candidate proteins identified were involved in flavonoid biosynthesis, alkaloid biosynthesis, ATPase family proteins related to abiotic/biotic stress response. The functional annotation of putative QTL identified in this current study will shed more light on the proteins associated with caffeine and catechins biosynthesis and % RWC. This study may help breeders in selection of parents with desirable DArTseq markers for development of new tea cultivars with desirable traits.","Lattice dynamics, mechanical stability and electronic structure of Fe-based Heusler semiconductors.",https://www.ncbi.nlm.nih.gov/pubmed/30728387,Scientific reports,2019 02 10,"The structural and mechanical stability of Fe2TaAl and Fe2TaGa alloys along with the electronic properties are explored with the help of density functional theory.

The maximum forbidden gaps observed by GGA + U method are Eg = 1.80 eV for Fe2TaAl and 1.30 eV for Fe2TaGa. The elastic parameters are simulated to determine the strength and ductile nature of these materials. The phonon calculations determine the dynamical stability of all these materials because of the absence of any negative frequencies. Basic understandings of structural, elastic, mechanical and phonon properties of these alloys are studied first time in this report.",Repeated human deciduous tooth-derived dental pulp cell reprogramming factor transfection yields multipotent intermediate cells with enhanced iPS cell formation capability.,https://www.ncbi.nlm.nih.gov/pubmed/30728386,Scientific reports,2019 02 10,"Human tissue-specific stem cells (hTSCs), found throughout the body, can differentiate into several lineages under appropriate conditions in vitro and in vivo. By transfecting terminally differentiated cells with reprogramming factors, we previously produced induced TSCs from the pancreas and hepatocytes that exhibit additional properties than iPSCs, as exemplified by very low tumour formation after xenogenic transplantation. We hypothesised that hTSCs, being partially reprogrammed in a state just prior to iPSC transition, could be isolated from any terminally differentiated cell type through transient reprogramming factor overexpression. Cytochemical staining of human deciduous tooth-derived dental pulp cells (HDDPCs) and human skin-derived fibroblasts following transfection with Yamanaka's factors demonstrated increased ALP activity, a stem cell marker, three weeks after transfection albeit in a small percentage of clones. Repeated transfections (≤3) led to more efficient iPSC generation, with HDDPCs exhibiting greater multipotentiality at two weeks post-transfection than the parental intact HDDPCs. These results indicated the utility of iPSC technology to isolate TSCs from HDDPCs and fibroblasts. Generally, a step-wise loss of pluripotential phenotypes in ESCs/iPSCs occurs during their differentiation process. Our present findings suggest that the reverse phenomenon can also occur upon repeated introduction of reprogramming factors into differentiated cells such as HDDPCs and fibroblasts.",Unusual oxidation-induced core-level shifts at the HfO2/InP interface.,https://www.ncbi.nlm.nih.gov/pubmed/30728385,Scientific reports,2019 02 10,"X-ray photoelectron spectroscopy (XPS) is one of the most used methods in a diverse field of materials science and engineering. The elemental core-level binding energies (BE) and core-level shifts (CLS) are determined and interpreted in the XPS. Oxidation is commonly considered to increase the BE of the core electrons of metal and semiconductor elements (i.e., positive BE shift due to O bonds), because valence electron charge density moves toward electronegative O atoms in the intuitive charge-transfer model. Here we demonstrate that this BE hypothesis is not generally valid by presenting XPS spectra and a consistent model of atomic processes occurring at HfO2/InP interface including negative In CLSs. It is shown theoretically for abrupt HfO2/InP model structures that there is no correlation between the In CLSs and the number of oxygen neighbors. However, the P CLSs can be estimated using the number of close O neighbors. First native oxide model interfaces for III-V semiconductors are introduced. The results obtained from ab initio calculations and synchrotron XPS measurements emphasize the importance of complementary analyses in various academic and industrial investigations where CLSs are at the heart of advancing knowledge.",Elevated carbon flux in deep waters of the South China Sea.,https://www.ncbi.nlm.nih.gov/pubmed/30728383,Scientific reports,2019 02 10,"We measured particulate organic carbon (POC) fluxes from the euphotic zone into the twilight zone and deep waters (>1000 m) that occurred between the shelf and the basin in the South China Sea (SCS) and at the SouthEast Asia Time Series Station (SEATS) using floating sediment trap arrays. Additionally, selected sinking particles were imaged by scanning electron microscope (SEM) to reveal particle morphology and composition. Results showed large variations in POC fluxes with elevated values (32-104 mg-C m-2 d-1) below the euphotic zone and a trend towards lower values in the deep SCS. Vertical POC fluxes measured in deep waters between the shelf and the SCS basin were much higher than those estimated by Martin's attenuation equation. These elevated POC fluxes in deep waters were attributed to lateral particle transport as opposed to enhanced settling out of the euphotic zone. SEM images of sinking particles at 150 m show abundant marine biogenic detritus, while those in deep waters contained a higher proportion of lithogenic material. A great deal of the spatial variability in POC fluxes across the twilight zone and deep waters of the SCS cannot be represented by current biogeochemical models.",The Effect of Micro- and Nanoscale Surface Topographies on Silk on Human Corneal Limbal Epithelial Cell Differentiation.,https://www.ncbi.nlm.nih.gov/pubmed/30728382,Scientific reports,2019 05 08,"We previously reported that micro- and nano-scale topographic pitch created on silk films mimic features of the corneal basement membrane by providing biophysical cues to direct corneal epithelial cell adherence and migration. However, the effect of these topographical features on corneal limbal epithelial cell differentiation has not been explored. We hypothesize in the current study that various topographical pitch created on silk may affect corneal epithelial stem cell differentiation and alter the expression of genes involved in cell differentiation and self-renewal. We patterned silk films with different topographic pitch via soft lithography and observed human corneal limbal epithelial cell behavior. Colony forming assay demonstrated increased colony forming efficiency on patterned silk films. Cells cultured on nanoscale patterned silk films also expressed lower levels of putative keratocyte differentiation markers and higher levels of putative limbal stem cell markers. RNA-Seq analysis further implicated the involvement of pathways related to stem cell differentiation and self-renewal, including Notch, ERK/MAPK and Wnt/β-catenin signaling. We conclude that patterned silk film substrates can be used as scaffolds and provide biophysical cues to corneal limbal stem cells that may maintain corneal epithelial stem cells at a less differentiated state.",Electrical Heating Performance of Electro-Conductive Para-aramid Knit Manufactured by Dip-Coating in a Graphene/Waterborne Polyurethane Composite.,https://www.ncbi.nlm.nih.gov/pubmed/30728381,Scientific reports,2019 02 10,"An electro-conductive para-aramid knit was manufactured by a dip-coating in a graphene/waterborne polyurethane(WPU) composite for confirming to use as a fabric heating element applicable to a protective clothing requiring durability. The para-aramid knit was dipped in 8 wt% graphene/WPU composite solution up to five-coat cycles. As a result of electro-conductive textile by number of dip-coating cycles, the electrical, and specifically electrical heating performances were increased number of cycles from one to five. The sample with the best electrical and electrical heating performance was the five-coat sample, and to improve those properties it was hot-pressed at 100 °C, 120 °C, 140 °C and 160 °C. After hot pressing, the entire surface of the sample was filled with graphene/WPU composite and indicated smoothly surface, thus the electrical and electrical heating performance was improved than the five-coat sample. The best performance of was indicated hot-pressed at 140 °C, with a surface resistivity and capacitance of 7.5 × 104 Ω/sq and 89.4 pF, respectively.

To further illustrate the molecular basis of the pro-tumoral role, Tumor-associated neutrophils (TANs) were isolated by fluorescence-activated cell sorting (FACS) and transcriptomic analyses were carried out by RNA-Seq. Differentially expressed gene profiles of TANs from larvae, male and female livers indicate great variations during liver tumorigenesis, but the common responsive canonical pathways included an immune pathway (Acute Phase Response Signaling), a liver metabolism-related pathway (LXR/RXR Activation) and Thrombin Signaling. Consistent with the pro-tumoral role of TANs, gene module analysis identified a consistent down-regulation of Cytotoxicity module, which may allow continued proliferation of malignant cells. Gene Set Enrichment Analysis indicated up-regulation of several genes promoting angiogenesis. Consistent with this, we found decreased density of blood vessels accompanied with decreased oncogenic liver sizes in neutrophil-depleted larvae. Collectively, our study has indicated some molecular mechanisms of the pro-tumoral roles of TANs in hepatocarcinogenesis, including weakened immune clearance against tumor cells and enhanced function in angiogenesis.",The Siberian wood frog survives for months underwater without oxygen.,https://www.ncbi.nlm.nih.gov/pubmed/30728368,Scientific reports,2019 02 10,"Few of the amphibian species that occur in the Subarctic and in mountains are adapted to low sub-zero temperatures; most of these species overwinter underwater. It is believed that the distribution of the species that overwinter underwater can be limited by the low oxygen levels in waterbodies covered with ice. We show that the colonisation of the coldest areas of Northern Asia (to 71°N) by the Siberian wood frog (Rana amurensis) was facilitated by a unique adaptation, the ability to survive extreme hypoxia - and probably anoxia - in waterbodies during overwintering. The oxygen content in the overwintering waterbodies that we have studied in different parts of the range of this species fell to 0.2-0.7 mg/L without causing any large-scale mortality among the frogs. In laboratory experiments the R. amurensis survived for up to 97 days in hermetically sealed containers with water that contained less than 0.2 mg/L oxygen at temperatures of 2-3 °C, retaining the ability to respond to external stimuli. An earlier study of a broad range of frog species has shown that very few of them can survive even brief (up to 5-7 days) exposure to oxygen-free water. The revealed adaptation to prolonged extreme hypoxia is the first known case of this kind among amphibians overwintering in water.",Aryl Azides as Phosphine-Activated Switches for Small Molecule Function.,https://www.ncbi.nlm.nih.gov/pubmed/30728367,Scientific reports,2019 02 10,"Engineered small molecule triggers are important tools for the control and investigation of biological processes, in particular protein function. Staudinger reductions of aryl azides to amines through the use of phosphines can trigger an elimination reaction, and thereby activation of a functional molecule, if an appropriately positioned leaving group is present. We conducted detailed investigations of the effect of aryl azide and phosphine structure on both the mechanism and kinetics of these reaction-induced eliminations and identified phosphine/azide pairs that enable complete activation within minutes under physiologically relevant conditions.",Critical roles for the phosphatidylinositide 3-kinase isoforms p110β and p110γ in thrombopoietin-mediated priming of platelet function.,https://www.ncbi.nlm.nih.gov/pubmed/30728366,Scientific reports,2019 03 29,"Thrombopoietin (TPO) enhances platelet activation through activation of the tyrosine kinase; JAK2 and the lipid kinase phosphatidylinositide 3-kinase (PI3K). The aim of our study was to identify the PI3K isoforms involved in mediating the effect of TPO on platelet function and elucidate the underlying mechanism. We found that p110β plays an essential role in TPO-mediated (i) priming of protease-activated receptor (PAR)-mediated integrin αIIbβ3 activation and α-granule secretion, (ii) synergistic enhancement of PAR-mediated activation of the small GTPase RAP1, a regulator of integrin activation and (iii) phosphorylation of the PI3K effector Akt. More importantly, the synergistic effect of TPO on phosphorylation of extracellular-regulated kinase (ERK1/2) and thromboxane (TxA2) synthesis was dependent on both p110β and p110γ. p110β inhibition/deletion, or inhibition of p110γ, resulted in a partial reduction, whereas inhibiting both p110β and p110γ completely prevented the synergistic effect of TPO on ERK1/2 phosphorylation and TxA2 synthesis. The latter was ablated by inhibition of MEK, but not p38, confirming a role for ERK1/2 in regulating TPO-mediated increases in TxA2 synthesis. In conclusion, the synergistic effect of TPO on RAP1 and integrin activation is largely mediated by p110β, whereas p110β and p110γ contribute to the effect of TPO on ERK1/2 phosphorylation and TxA2 formation.",miR-148a regulates expression of the transferrin receptor 1 in hepatocellular carcinoma.,https://www.ncbi.nlm.nih.gov/pubmed/30728365,Scientific reports,2019 02 10,"Transferrin receptor 1 (TFR1) is a transmembrane glycoprotein that allows for transferrin-bound iron uptake in mammalian cells. It is overexpressed in various cancers to satisfy the high iron demand of fast proliferating cells. Here we show that in hepatocellular carcinoma (HCC) TFR1 expression is regulated by miR-148a. Within the TFR1 3'UTR we identified and experimentally validated two evolutionarily conserved miRNA response elements (MREs) for miR-148/152 family members, including miR-148a. Interestingly, analyses of RNA sequencing data from patients with liver hepatocellular carcinoma (LIHC) revealed a significant inverse correlation of TFR1 mRNA levels and miR-148a. In addition, TFR1 mRNA levels were significantly increased in the tumor compared to matched normal healthy tissue, while miR-148a levels are decreased. Functional analysis demonstrated post-transcriptional regulation of TFR1 by miR-148a in HCC cells as well as decreased HCC cell proliferation upon either miR-148a overexpression or TFR1 knockdown. We hypothesize that decreased expression of miR-148a in HCC may elevate transferrin-bound iron uptake, increasing cellular iron levels and cell proliferation.",Increased Diagnostic Yield of Tuberculous Serositis by Using Serous Fluid Drainage Flocky Precipitate (SFDFP) as a Testing Sample.,https://www.ncbi.nlm.nih.gov/pubmed/30728364,Scientific reports,2019 02 10,"A definitive diagnosis of tuberculosis serositis (TS) is still challenging. Our preliminary practice found that Serous Fluid Drainage Flocky Precipitate (SFDFP) was a useful testing sample to diagnose TS. We designed this study to assess the diagnostic performance of SFDPF for TS compared with conventional bacteriology methods on serous fluid (SF). A cohort study was conducted from July 2014 to April 2016. Patients with suspected TS were consecutively screened. SF and SFDFP were collected and tested by Ziehl-Neelsen stain, MTB culture, and Xpert/RIF assay. We compared the diagnostic performance of SF and SFDFP in several test settings. Through this study, 85 patients were enrolled, of whom 70 (82.4%) were confirmed TS or highly probable TS, 13 (15.3%) were none-TS and 2 (2.4%) indeterminate results were ruled out. The overall sensitivity using both SFDFP and SF was significantly higher than each (60% vs. 48% and 41%, p < 0.05). SFDFP and SF samples had similar diagnostic performance (p < 0.05). No false positive was detected in this study. We concluded that SFDFP is a reliable testing sample for diagnosing tuberculous serositis. SFDFP may significantly improve the diagnostic yield as a supplement to conventional tests.","Transcranial Current Stimulation During Sleep Facilitates Insight into Temporal Rules, but does not Consolidate Memories of Individual Sequential Experiences.",https://www.ncbi.nlm.nih.gov/pubmed/30728363,Scientific reports,2019 02 10,"Slow-wave sleep (SWS) is known to contribute to memory consolidation, likely through the reactivation of previously encoded waking experiences. Contemporary studies demonstrate that when auditory or olfactory stimulation is administered during memory encoding and then reapplied during SWS, memory consolidation can be enhanced, an effect that is believed to rely on targeted memory reactivation (TMR) induced by the sensory stimulation. Here, we show that transcranial current stimulations (tCS) during sleep can also be used to induce TMR, resulting in the facilitation of high-level cognitive processes. Participants were exposed to repeating sequences in a realistic 3D immersive environment while being stimulated with particular tCS patterns. A subset of these tCS patterns was then reapplied during sleep stages N2 and SWS coupled to slow oscillations in a closed-loop manner. We found that in contrast to our initial hypothesis, performance for the sequences corresponding to the reapplied tCS patterns was no better than for other sequences that received stimulations only during wake or not at all. In contrast, we found that the more stimulations participants received overnight, the more likely they were to detect temporal regularities governing the learned sequences the following morning, with tCS-induced beta power modulations during sleep mediating this effect.",Dentate gyrus μ-opioid receptor-mediated neurogenic processes are associated with alterations in morphine self-administration.,https://www.ncbi.nlm.nih.gov/pubmed/30728362,Scientific reports,2019 02 10,"Adult hippocampal dentate gyrus (DG) neural stem cells (NSCs) continuously undergo proliferation and differentiation, producing new functional neurons that remodel existing synaptic circuits. Although proliferation of these adult DG NSCs has been implicated in opiate dependence, whether NSC neuronal differentiation and subsequent dendritogenesis are also involved in such addictive behavior remains unknown. Here, we ask whether opiate exposure alters differentiation and dendritogenesis of DG NSCs and investigate the possibility that these alterations contribute to opiate addiction. We show that rat morphine self-administration (MSA), a paradigm that effectively mimics human opiate addiction, increases NSC neuronal differentiation and promotes neuronal dendrite growth in the adult DG. Further, we demonstrate that the μ-opioid receptor (MOR) is expressed on DG NSCs and that MSA leads to a two-fold elevation of endogenous MOR levels in doublecortin expressing (DCX+) NSC progenies in the rat DG. MOR expression is also detected in the cultured rat NSCs and morphine treatment in vitro increases NSC neuronal differentiation and dendritogenesis, suggesting that MOR mediates the effect of morphine on NSC neuronal differentiation and maturation. Finally, we show that conditional overexpression of MOR in DG NSCs under a doxycycline inducible system leads to facilitation of the acquisition of MSA in rats, without affecting the extinction process. We advocate that targeting MOR selectively in the DG NSC population might offer a novel therapeutic intervention for morphine addiction.",Publisher Correction: Understanding dynamic friction through spontaneously evolving laboratory earthquakes.,https://www.ncbi.nlm.nih.gov/pubmed/30728361,Nature communications,2019 03 19,The HTML version of this Article incorrectly omits Supplementary Movie 1.

Here, we studied the combined and individual contributions of four lifestyle variables - alcohol consumption, smoking, physical activity, and social integration - to brain structure and functional connectivity in a population-based cohort of 549 older adults. A combined lifestyle risk score was associated with decreased gyrification in left premotor and right prefrontal cortex, and higher functional connectivity to sensorimotor and prefrontal cortex. While structural differences were driven by alcohol consumption, physical activity, and social integration, higher functional connectivity was driven by smoking. Results suggest that combining differentially contributing lifestyle variables may be more than the sum of its parts. Associations generally were neither altered by adjustment for genetic risk, nor by depressive symptomatology or education, underlining the relevance of daily habits for brain health."

Recent studies have shown that long non-coding RNAs (lncRNAs) are critical for brain development and synaptic plasticity. One such lncRNA is natural occurring brain-derived neurotrophic factor antisense (BDNF-AS) that has been shown to regulate BDNF expression. The role of BDNF-AS lncRNA in the molecular mechanisms of AUD is unknown. Here, we evaluated the expression and functional role of BDNF-AS in postmortem amygdala of either early onset or late onset alcoholics (individuals who began drinking before or after 21 years of age, respectively) and age-matched control subjects. BDNF-AS expression is increased in early onset but not in late onset AUD amygdala and appears to be regulated epitranscriptomically via decreased N6-methyladenosine on BDNF-AS. Upregulation of BDNF-AS is associated with a significant decrease in BDNF expression and increased recruitment of EZH2, which deposits repressive H3K27 trimethylation (H3K27me3) at regulatory regions in the BDNF gene in the early onset AUD group. Drinking during adolescence also contributed to significant decreases in activity-regulated cytoskeleton-associated protein (ARC) expression which also appeared to be mediated by increased EZH2 deposition of repressive H3K27me3 at the ARC synaptic activity response element. These results suggest an important role for BDNF-AS in the regulation of synaptic plasticity via epigenetic reprogramming in the amygdala of AUD subjects who began drinking during adolescence.",Intestinal electrical stimulation attenuates hyperglycemia and prevents loss of pancreatic β cells in type 2 diabetic Goto-Kakizaki rats.,https://www.ncbi.nlm.nih.gov/pubmed/30728346,Nutrition & diabetes,2019 02 19,"Recently, intestinal electrical stimulation (IES) has been reported to result in weight loss; however, it is unclear whether it has a therapeutic potential for diabetes.

We present a case of spontaneous rectus sheath hematoma (SRSH) without obvious risk factors and review the literature regarding diagnosis modalities and management. The aim of this case presentation is to highlight this rare clinical condition and emphasize the role of the physical exam in determining the appropriate treatment approach.   CASE REPORT A 50-year-old woman presented to the emergency room with right-sided pelvic pain for one day. Her medical history was specifically notable for recent coughing due to acute bronchitis, as well as the use of NSAIDs. Physical examination revealed marked tenderness in the hypogastric and right lower quadrant, with guarding and fullness in the same area. Laboratory investigation showed mild anemia and normal coagulation tests. Computed tomography demonstrated a right rectus muscle hematoma measuring 8.5×8.5 cm and extending into the lower abdomen and the extraperitoneal space, without active contrast extravasation. Close monitoring of vital signs and hemoglobin hematocrit levels along with supportive care with fluid resuscitation and pain control were initiated and the patient remained stable throughout her hospital stay. CONCLUSIONS Prompt recognition and management of SRSH are crucial. Physical examination is a key part of this process and imaging is the mainstay of diagnosis. Management remains for the most part supportive, although surgery or vascular embolization is required for uncontrolled hematomas with hemodynamic instability.",Probucol Protects Against Contrast-Induced Acute Kidney Injury via the Extracellular Signal-Regulated Kinases 1 and 2 (ERK1/2)/JNK-Caspase 3 Pathway in Diabetic Rats.,https://www.ncbi.nlm.nih.gov/pubmed/30728344,Medical science monitor : international medical journal of experimental and clinical research,2019 04 09,"BACKGROUND Contrast-induced acute kidney injury is an important clinical problem, yet its pathogenic mechanisms are incompletely understood. In this study we explored the potential beneficial effects of probucol as treatment of contrast-induced acute kidney injury in diabetic rats. MATERIAL AND METHODS Rats were divided into 3 groups: i) diabetic control, ii) diabetic with contrast, and iii) probucol treatment groups. Probucol was administered by gavage and the contrast diatrizoate (60%) was injected via femoral vein. After 24 h, the rats were sacrificed and samples were taken to measure biochemical indicators. Pathological damage of renal tubules was evaluated by HE staining. Expression of Bcl-2, Bax, p-ERKs, and p-JNK proteins in the kidneys was examined by Western blotting, whereas expression level of caspase-3 in kidneys was detected by immunohistochemistry. RESULTS Compared to the probucol treatment group, the diabetes with contrast group showed higher serum creatinine and lower creatinine clearance. The pathological changes of kidneys in the probucol treatment group were improved compared with the contrast group. Moreover, Western blot analyses revealed that use of contrast agent led to lower p-ERK1/2, higher p-JNK, lower Bcl-2, and higher Bax levels, which were reversed by probucol. Finally, immunohistochemical findings revealed higher caspase-3 after contrast use, which was partially reversed by probucol. CONCLUSIONS Probucol exerts protective effects on contrast-induced acute kidney injury in diabetic rats by inhibition of renal cell apoptosis. This is achieved by reducing mitochondrial caspase-3 expression through increasing and decreasing the expression of the upstream mediators p-ERK1/2 and p-JNK, respectively.",Chimney-Patch Arterial Graft in Kidney or Pancreas Transplantation for Recipients with Heavily Calcified Iliac Arteries.,https://www.ncbi.nlm.nih.gov/pubmed/30728343,Annals of transplantation,2019 06 04,"Iliac artery calcification is a common phenomenon complicating renal transplantation, particularly in those with diabetes.

It is important to treat appropriately cough-variant asthma because 30% to 40% of cough-variant asthma becomes a typical asthma. However, little is known about the treatment of cough-variant asthma except for inhaled corticosteroid (ICS). The aim of this study was to validate the additive efficacy of a leukotriene receptor antagonist (LTRA) on cough score and respiratory function in patients with cough-variant asthma being treated with ICS. A total 28 patients were randomly assigned to either an ICS + LTRA group or an ICS group. There were statistically significant improvements in cough scores in the ICS + LTRA group from 0 weeks (6.7 ± 4.4) to 2 weeks (2.9 ± 3.2) (P < 0.05), 4 weeks (0.7 ± 1.1) (P < 0.001), and 8 weeks (0.8 ± 1.2) (P < 0.001).

Here, we identified quetiapine as a potent and selective agonist for pregnane X receptor (PXR), a key nuclear receptor that regulates xenobiotic metabolism in the liver and intestine. Recent studies have indicated that PXR also plays an important role in lipid homeostasis. We generated potentially novel tissue-specific PXR-KO mice and demonstrated that quetiapine induced hyperlipidemia by activating intestinal PXR signaling. Quetiapine-mediated PXR activation stimulated the intestinal expression of cholesterol transporter Niemann-Pick C1-Like 1 (NPC1L1) and microsomal triglyceride transfer protein (MTP), leading to increased intestinal lipid absorption. While NPC1L1 is a known PXR target gene, we identified a DR-1-type PXR-response element in the MTP promoter and established MTP as a potentially novel transcriptional target of PXR. Quetiapine's effects on PXR-mediated gene expression and cholesterol uptake were also confirmed in cultured murine enteroids and human intestinal cells. Our findings suggest a potential role of PXR in mediating adverse effects of quetiapine in humans and provide mechanistic insights for certain atypical antipsychotic-associated dyslipidemia.",TIGIT signaling restores suppressor function of Th1 Tregs.,https://www.ncbi.nlm.nih.gov/pubmed/30728325,JCI insight,2019 04 07,"Th1 Tregs are characterized by the acquisition of proinflammatory cytokine secretion and reduced suppressor activity. Th1 Tregs are found at increased frequency in autoimmune diseases, including type 1 diabetes and multiple sclerosis (MS). We have previously reported that in vitro stimulation with IL-12 recapitulates the functional and molecular features of MS-associated Th1 Tregs, revealing a central role for hyperactivation of the Akt pathway in their induction. TIGIT is a newly identified coinhibitory receptor that marks Tregs that specifically control Th1 and Th17 responses. Here, we report that signaling through TIGIT counteracts the action of IL-12 in inducing the Th1 program. Specifically, TIGIT signaling represses production of IFN-γ and T-bet expression and restores suppressor function in Tregs treated with IL-12. FoxO1 functional inhibition abolishes the protective effect of TIGIT, indicating that TIGIT signaling promotes FoxO1 nuclear localization. Consistent with this observation, signaling through TIGIT leads to a rapid suppression of Akt function and FoxO1 phosphorylation. Finally, TIGIT stimulation reduces the production of IFN-γ and corrects the suppressor defect of Tregs from patients with MS. Our results indicate an important role for TIGIT in controlling the functional stability of Tregs through repression of Akt, suggesting that the TIGIT pathway could be targeted for immunomodulatory therapies in human autoimmune disorders.",Hypomorphic mutations of TRIP11 cause odontochondrodysplasia.,https://www.ncbi.nlm.nih.gov/pubmed/30728324,JCI insight,2019 06 10,"Odontochondrodysplasia (ODCD) is an unresolved genetic disorder of skeletal and dental development. Here, we show that ODCD is caused by hypomorphic TRIP11 mutations, and we identify ODCD as the nonlethal counterpart to achondrogenesis 1A (ACG1A), the known null phenotype in humans. TRIP11 encodes Golgi-associated microtubule-binding protein 210 (GMAP-210), an essential tether protein of the Golgi apparatus that physically interacts with intraflagellar transport 20 (IFT20), a component of the ciliary intraflagellar transport complex B. This association and extraskeletal disease manifestations in ODCD point to a cilium-dependent pathogenesis. However, our functional studies in patient-derived primary cells clearly support a Golgi-based disease mechanism. In spite of reduced abundance, residual GMAP variants maintain partial Golgi integrity, normal global protein secretion, and subcellular distribution of IFT20 in ODCD. These functions are lost when GMAP-210 is completely abrogated in ACG1A. However, a similar defect in chondrocyte maturation is observed in both disorders, which produces a cellular achondrogenesis phenotype of different severity, ensuing from aberrant glycan processing and impaired extracellular matrix proteoglycan secretion by the Golgi apparatus.",Therapeutic drug monitoring of darunavir/ritonavir in pregnancy.,https://www.ncbi.nlm.nih.gov/pubmed/30728322,Antiviral therapy,2019 03 27,"Physiological changes during pregnancy can have a significant impact on antiretroviral pharmacokinetics (PK), which may result in reduced drug efficacy.

However, the transplantation of ASCs may induce local fibrosis, which causes inferior outcome. Here, we aimed to use genetic modification approaches to reduce the fibrogenic properties of ASCs to improve their therapeutic effects on facial nerve regeneration. Since procollagen-lysine 1, 2-oxoglutarate 5-dioxygenase 1 (PLOD1) is essential for hydroxylation of lysine residues in collagen telopeptides and for collagen pyridinoline cross-link formation during fibrosis, and since we found that ASCs expressed high levels of PLOD1, we depleted PLOD1 in ASCs by expression of either a short-hair interfering RNA for PLOD1 (shPLOD1) or a microRNA-449 (miR-449), the latter of which targets PLOD1 mRNA to suppress protein translation. Transplantation of either ASCs-shPLOD1 or ASCs-miR-449 or ASCs-control to repair a 6mm-gap in rat facial nerve was compared. Either ASCs-shPLOD1 or ASCs-miR-449 exhibited a better facial nerve function.

A limitation of this approach is the requirement for detailed knowledge about the altered self-peptide ligands used in these vaccines. In the current study we considered allorecognition as an approach for activating CTL capable of recognizing weak or self-antigens in the context of self-MHC. Nonself antigen-presenting molecules typically contain polymorphisms that influence interactions with the bound peptide and TCR interface. Recognition of these nonself structures results in peptide-dependent alloimmunity. Alloreactive T cells target their inducing alloantigens as well as third-party alloantigens but generally fail to target self-antigens. Certain residues located on the alpha-1/2 domains of class I antigen-presenting molecules primarily interface with TCR. These residues are more conserved within and across species than are residues that determine peptide antigen binding properties. Class I variants designed with amino acid substitutions at key positions within the conserved helical structures are shown to provide strong activating signals to alloreactive CD8 T cells while avoiding changes in naturally bound peptide ligands. Importantly, CTL activated in this manner can break self-tolerance by reacting to self-peptides presented by native MHC. The ability to activate self-tolerant T cells capable of cross-reacting on self-peptide-MHC in vivo represents an approach for inducing autoimmunity, with possible application in cancer vaccines.",Musical reward prediction errors engage the nucleus accumbens and motivate learning.,https://www.ncbi.nlm.nih.gov/pubmed/30728301,Proceedings of the National Academy of Sciences of the United States of America,2019 05 01,"Enjoying music reliably ranks among life's greatest pleasures. Like many hedonic experiences, it engages several reward-related brain areas, with activity in the nucleus accumbens (NAc) most consistently reflecting the listener's subjective response. Converging evidence suggests that this activity arises from musical ""reward prediction errors"" (RPEs) that signal the difference between expected and perceived musical events, but this hypothesis has not been directly tested. In the present fMRI experiment, we assessed whether music could elicit formally modeled RPEs in the NAc by applying a well-established decision-making protocol designed and validated for studying RPEs. In the scanner, participants chose between arbitrary cues that probabilistically led to dissonant or consonant music, and learned to make choices associated with the consonance, which they preferred. We modeled regressors of trial-by-trial RPEs, finding that NAc activity tracked musically elicited RPEs, to an extent that explained variance in the individual learning rates. These results demonstrate that music can act as a reward, driving learning and eliciting RPEs in the NAc, a hub of reward- and music enjoyment-related activity.",Harmonic dynamics of the abelian sandpile.,https://www.ncbi.nlm.nih.gov/pubmed/30728300,Proceedings of the National Academy of Sciences of the United States of America,2019 05 02,"The abelian sandpile is a cellular automaton which serves as the archetypical model to study self-organized criticality, a phenomenon occurring in various biological, physical, and social processes. Its recurrent configurations form an abelian group, whose identity is a fractal composed of self-similar patches. Here, we analyze the evolution of the sandpile identity under harmonic fields of different orders. We show that this evolution corresponds to periodic cycles through the abelian group characterized by the smooth transformation and apparent conservation of the patches constituting the identity. The dynamics induced by second- and third-order harmonics resemble smooth stretchings and translations, respectively, while the ones induced by fourth-order harmonics resemble magnifications and rotations. Based on an extensive analysis of these sandpile dynamics on domains of different size, we conjecture the existence of several scaling limits for infinite domains. Furthermore, we show that the space of harmonic functions provides a set of universal coordinates identifying configurations between different domains, which directly implies that the sandpile group admits a natural renormalization. Finally, we show that the harmonic fields can be induced by simple Markov processes and that the corresponding stochastic dynamics show remarkable robustness. Our results suggest that harmonic fields might split the sandpile group into subsets showing different critical coefficients and that it might be possible to extend the fractal structure of the identity beyond the boundaries of its domain.",DNA helicase RecQ1 regulates mutually exclusive expression of virulence genes in Plasmodium falciparum via heterochromatin alteration.,https://www.ncbi.nlm.nih.gov/pubmed/30728298,Proceedings of the National Academy of Sciences of the United States of America,2019 05 01,"The Plasmodium falciparum var gene family encodes ∼60 surface antigens by which parasites escape the host immune responses via clonal expression of var genes. However, the mechanism controlling this mutual exclusivity, associated with alterations in chromatin assembly, is not understood. Here, we determined how expression of the var gene family is regulated by two RecQ DNA helicase family members, PfRecQ1 and PfWRN, in P. falciparum Through genetic manipulation, we found that the complete var repertoire was silenced on PfRecQ1 knockout, whereas their expression did not show noticeable changes when PfWRN was knocked out. More important, mutually exclusive expression of var genes could be rescued by complementation of PfRecQ1. In addition, knocking out either of these two helicase genes changed the perinuclear cluster distribution of subtelomeres and subtelomeric var genes. Whereas deletion of PfRecQ1 increased the heterochromatin mark trimethylated (H3K9me3) at the transcription start site (TSS) of the var gene upsC1, that deletion had no effect on the global distribution of H3K9me3 over gene bodies, including those for the var genes. ChIP-seq assay showed that PfRecQ1 was enriched globally at the TSSs of all genes, whereas PfWRN-enriched regions occurred at the gene bodies of the var gene family, but not of other genes or at TSSs of all genes. On PfRecQ1 deletion, the upsC1 var gene moved from the active perinuclear transcription region to a silenced region of the upsC type. These findings imply that PfRecQ1, but not PfWRN, is essential for maintaining the clonal expression of var genes.",Diverse GPCRs exhibit conserved water networks for stabilization and activation.,https://www.ncbi.nlm.nih.gov/pubmed/30728297,Proceedings of the National Academy of Sciences of the United States of America,2019 05 01,"G protein-coupled receptors (GPCRs) have evolved to recognize incredibly diverse extracellular ligands while sharing a common architecture and structurally conserved intracellular signaling partners. It remains unclear how binding of diverse ligands brings about GPCR activation, the common structural change that enables intracellular signaling. Here, we identify highly conserved networks of water-mediated interactions that play a central role in activation. Using atomic-level simulations of diverse GPCRs, we show that most of the water molecules in GPCR crystal structures are highly mobile. Several water molecules near the G protein-coupling interface, however, are stable. These water molecules form two kinds of polar networks that are conserved across diverse GPCRs: (i) a network that is maintained across the inactive and the active states and (ii) a network that rearranges upon activation. Comparative analysis of GPCR crystal structures independently confirms the striking conservation of water-mediated interaction networks. These conserved water-mediated interactions near the G protein-coupling region, along with diverse water-mediated interactions with extracellular ligands, have direct implications for structure-based drug design and GPCR engineering.","Structure-function characterization of an insecticidal protein GNIP1Aa, a member of an MACPF and β-tripod families.",https://www.ncbi.nlm.nih.gov/pubmed/30728296,Proceedings of the National Academy of Sciences of the United States of America,2019 05 02,"The crystal structure of the Gram-negative insecticidal protein, GNIP1Aa, has been solved at 2.5-Å resolution. The protein consists of two structurally distinct domains, a MACPF (membrane attack complex/PerForin) and a previously uncharacterized type of domain. GNIP1Aa is unique in being a prokaryotic MACPF member to have both its structure and function identified. It was isolated from a Chromobacterium piscinae strain and is specifically toxic to Diabrotica virgifera virgifera larvae upon feeding. In members of the MACPF family, the MACPF domain has been shown to be important for protein oligomerization and formation of transmembrane pores, while accompanying domains define the specificity of the target of the toxicity. In GNIP1Aa the accompanying C-terminal domain has a unique fold composed of three pseudosymmetric subdomains with shared sequence similarity, a feature not obvious from the initial sequence examination. Our analysis places this domain into a protein family, named here β-tripod.

In neonatal rodents, retinal waves initiate in starburst amacrine cells (SACs), propagating across retinal ganglion cells (RGCs), further through visual centers. Although these waves are shown temporally synchronized with transiently high PKA activity, the downstream PKA target important for regulating the transmission from SACs remains unidentified. A t-SNARE, synaptosome-associated protein of 25 kDa (SNAP-25/SN25), serves as a PKA substrate, implying a potential role of SN25 in regulating retinal development. Here, we examined whether SN25 in SACs could regulate wave properties and retinogeniculate projection during development. In developing SACs, overexpression of wild-type SN25b, but not the PKA-phosphodeficient mutant (SN25b-T138A), decreased the frequency and spatial correlation of wave-associated calcium transients. Overexpressing SN25b, but not SN25b-T138A, in SACs dampened spontaneous, wave-associated, postsynaptic currents in RGCs and decreased the SAC release upon augmenting the cAMP-PKA signaling. These results suggest that SN25b overexpression may inhibit the strength of transmission from SACs via PKA-mediated phosphorylation at T138. Moreover, knockdown of endogenous SN25b increased the frequency of wave-associated calcium transients, supporting the role of SN25 in restraining wave periodicity. Finally, the eye-specific segregation of retinogeniculate projection was impaired by in vivo overexpression of SN25b, but not SN25b-T138A, in SACs. These results suggest that SN25 in developing SACs dampens the spatiotemporal properties of retinal waves and limits visual circuit refinement by phosphorylation at T138. Therefore, SN25 in SACs plays a profound role in regulating visual circuit refinement.",Metabolic preference of nitrate over oxygen as an electron acceptor in foraminifera from the Peruvian oxygen minimum zone.,https://www.ncbi.nlm.nih.gov/pubmed/30728294,Proceedings of the National Academy of Sciences of the United States of America,2019 04 24,"Benthic foraminifera populate a diverse range of marine habitats. Their ability to use alternative electron acceptors-nitrate (NO3-) or oxygen (O2)-makes them important mediators of benthic nitrogen cycling. Nevertheless, the metabolic scaling of the two alternative respiration pathways and the environmental determinants of foraminiferal denitrification rates are yet unknown. We measured denitrification and O2 respiration rates for 10 benthic foraminifer species sampled in the Peruvian oxygen minimum zone (OMZ). Denitrification and O2 respiration rates significantly scale sublinearly with the cell volume. The scaling is lower for O2 respiration than for denitrification, indicating that NO3- metabolism during denitrification is more efficient than O2 metabolism during aerobic respiration in foraminifera from the Peruvian OMZ. The negative correlation of the O2 respiration rate with the surface/volume ratio is steeper than for the denitrification rate. This is likely explained by the presence of an intracellular NO3- storage in denitrifying foraminifera. Furthermore, we observe an increasing mean cell volume of the Peruvian foraminifera, under higher NO3- availability. This suggests that the cell size of denitrifying foraminifera is not limited by O2 but rather by NO3- availability. Based on our findings, we develop a mathematical formulation of foraminiferal cell volume as a predictor of respiration and denitrification rates, which can further constrain foraminiferal biogeochemical cycling in biogeochemical models. Our findings show that NO3- is the preferred electron acceptor in foraminifera from the OMZ, where the foraminiferal contribution to denitrification is governed by the ratio between NO3- and O2.","Experimental evolutionary studies on the genetic autonomy of the cytoplasmic genome ""plasmon"" in the Triticum (wheat)-Aegilops complex.",https://www.ncbi.nlm.nih.gov/pubmed/30728293,Proceedings of the National Academy of Sciences of the United States of America,2019 05 03,"The term ""plasmon"" is used to indicate the whole cytoplasmic genetic system, whereas ""genome"" refers to the whole nuclear genetic system.

Results indicated no change in the effect of Ae. caudata plasmon on Tve wheat during its stay in wheat for more than half a century, and no difference between the native and reconstructed caudata strains in their phenotype and simple sequence repeats in their organellar DNAs, thus demonstrating the prolonged genetic autonomy of the plasmon from the coexisting genomes of wheat and several other species that were used in the reconstruction of Ae. caudata The relationship between the proven genetic autonomy of the plasmon under changing nuclear conditions and its diversification during evolution of the Triticum-Aegilops complex is discussed.",ERK2 regulates epithelial-to-mesenchymal plasticity through DOCK10-dependent Rac1/FoxO1 activation.,https://www.ncbi.nlm.nih.gov/pubmed/30728292,Proceedings of the National Academy of Sciences of the United States of America,2019 05 02,"ERK is a key coordinator of the epithelial-to-mesenchymal transition (EMT) in that a variety of EMT-inducing factors activate signaling pathways that converge on ERK to regulate EMT transcription programs. However, the mechanisms by which ERK controls the EMT program are not well understood. Through an analysis of the global changes of gene expression mediated by ERK2, we identified the transcription factor FoxO1 as a potential mediator of ERK2-induced EMT, and thus we investigated the mechanism by which ERK2 regulates FoxO1. Additionally, our analysis revealed that ERK2 induced the expression of Dock10, a Rac1/Cdc42 GEF, during EMT. We demonstrate that the activation of the Rac1/JNK signaling axis downstream of Dock10 leads to an increase in FoxO1 expression and EMT. Taken together, our study uncovers mechanisms by which epithelial cells acquire less proliferative but more migratory mesenchymal properties and reveals potential therapeutic targets for cancers evolving into a metastatic disease state."

Here, we used genomics to reconstruct in detail the evolutionary trajectory and dynamics of M. ulcerans populations at a central African scale and at smaller geographical village scales. Whole-genome sequencing (WGS) data were analyzed from 179 M. ulcerans strains isolated from all Buruli ulcer foci in the Democratic Republic of the Congo, The Republic of Congo, and Angola that have ever yielded positive M. ulcerans cultures. We used both temporal associations and the study of the mycobacterial demographic history to estimate the contribution of humans as a reservoir in Buruli ulcer transmission. Our phylogeographic analysis revealed one almost exclusively predominant sublineage of M. ulcerans that arose in Central Africa and proliferated in its different regions of endemicity during the Age of Discovery. We observed how the best sampled endemic hot spot, the Songololo territory, became an area of endemicity while the region was being colonized by Belgium (1880s). We furthermore identified temporal parallels between the observed past population fluxes of M. ulcerans from the Songololo territory and the timing of health policy changes toward control of the Buruli ulcer epidemic in that region. These findings suggest that an intervention based on detecting and treating human cases in an area of endemicity might be sufficient to break disease transmission chains, irrespective of other reservoirs of the bacterium.IMPORTANCE Buruli ulcer is a destructive skin and soft tissue infection caused by Mycobacterium ulcerans The disease is characterized by progressive skin ulceration, which can lead to permanent disfigurement and long-term disability. Currently, the major hurdles facing disease control are incomplete understandings of both the mode of transmission and environmental reservoirs of M. ulcerans As decades of spasmodic environmental sampling surveys have not brought us much closer to overcoming these hurdles, the Buruli ulcer research community has recently switched to using comparative genomics. The significance of our research is in how we used both temporal associations and the study of the mycobacterial demographic history to estimate the contribution of humans as a reservoir in Buruli ulcer transmission. Our approach shows that it might be possible to use bacterial population genomics to assess the impact of health interventions, providing valuable feedback for managers of disease control programs in areas where health surveillance infrastructure is poor.",Gene Expansion and Positive Selection as Bacterial Adaptations to Oligotrophic Conditions.,https://www.ncbi.nlm.nih.gov/pubmed/30728279,mSphere,2019 04 08,"We examined the genomic adaptations of prevalent bacterial taxa in a highly nutrient- and ion-depleted freshwater environment located in the secondary cooling water system of a nuclear research reactor. Using genome-centric metagenomics, we found that none of the prevalent bacterial taxa were related to typical freshwater bacterial lineages. We also did not identify strong signatures of genome streamlining, which has been shown to be one of the ecoevolutionary forces shaping the genome characteristics of bacterial taxa in nutrient-depleted environments. Instead, focusing on the dominant taxon, a novel Ramlibacter sp. which we propose to name Ramlibacter aquaticus, we detected extensive positive selection on genes involved in phosphorus and carbon scavenging pathways. These genes were involved in the high-affinity phosphate uptake and storage into polyphosphate granules, metabolism of nitrogen-rich organic matter, and carbon/energy storage into polyhydroxyalkanoate. In parallel, comparative genomics revealed a high number of paralogs and an accessory genome significantly enriched in environmental sensing pathways (i.e., chemotaxis and motility), suggesting extensive gene expansions in R. aquaticus The type strain of R. aquaticus (LMG 30558T) displayed optimal growth kinetics and productivity at low nutrient concentrations, as well as substantial cell size plasticity. Our findings with R. aquaticus LMG 30558T demonstrate that positive selection and gene expansions may represent successful adaptive strategies to oligotrophic environments that preserve high growth rates and cellular productivity.IMPORTANCE By combining a genome-centric metagenomic approach with a culture-based approach, we investigated the genomic adaptations of prevalent populations in an engineered oligotrophic freshwater system. We found evidence for widespread positive selection on genes involved in phosphorus and carbon scavenging pathways and for gene expansions in motility and environmental sensing to be important genomic adaptations of the abundant taxon in this system. In addition, microscopic and flow cytometric analysis of the first freshwater representative of this population (Ramlibacter aquaticus LMG 30558T) demonstrated phenotypic plasticity, possibly due to the metabolic versatility granted by its larger genome, to be a strategy to cope with nutrient limitation. Our study clearly demonstrates the need for the use of a broad set of genomic tools combined with culture-based physiological characterization assays to investigate and validate genomic adaptations.",Feasibility Assessment of Using the Complete Patient-Reported Outcomes Version of the Common Terminology Criteria for Adverse Events (PRO-CTCAE) Item Library.,https://www.ncbi.nlm.nih.gov/pubmed/30728278,The oncologist,2019 04 12,"The patient-reported outcomes version of the Common Terminology Criteria for Adverse Events (PRO-CTCAE) complements capture of symptomatic adverse events (AEs) by clinicians.

Here, we report a preplanned analysis after enrolling the first 20 patients. All items were answered on 51 of 56 potential visits (adherence 91%). Three (5%) additional PRO-CTCAE assessments were partially completed, and two (4%) were missed because of conflicting appointments.

Previous analysis indicated that AFL1 may have functions related to endocytosis and regulation of actin filament organization, processes for which the effects of low water potential are little known. We found that low water potential led to a decrease in endocytosis, as measured by uptake of the membrane-impermeable dye FM4-64. Ectopic expression of AFL1 reversed the decrease in FM4-64 uptake seen in wild type, while reduced AFL1 expression led to further inhibition of FM4-64 uptake. Increased AFL1 also made FM4-64 uptake less sensitive to the actin filament disruptor Latrunculin B (LatB). LatB decreased AFL1-Clathrin Light Chain colocalization, further indicating that effects of AFL1 on endocytosis may be related to actin filament organization or stability. Consistent with this hypothesis, ectopic AFL1 expression made actin filaments less sensitive to disruption by LatB or Cytochalasin D and led to increased actin filament skewness and decreased occupancy, indicative of more bundled actin filaments. This latter effect could be partially mimicked by the actin filament stabilizer Jasplakinolide (JASP). However, AFL1 did not substantially inhibit actin filament dynamics, indicating that AFL1 acts via a different mechanism than JASP-induced stabilization. AFL1 partially colocalized with actin filaments but not with microtubules, further indicating actin-filament-related function of AFL1. These data provide insight into endocytosis and actin filament responses to low water potential stress and demonstrate an involvement of AFL1 in these key cellular processes.",Branched-Chain Amino Acid Catabolism Impacts Triacylglycerol Homeostasis in Chlamydomonas reinhardtii.,https://www.ncbi.nlm.nih.gov/pubmed/30728273,Plant physiology,2019 04 10,"Nitrogen (N) starvation-induced triacylglycerol (TAG) synthesis, and its complex relationship with starch metabolism in algal cells, has been intensively studied; however, few studies have examined the interaction between amino acid metabolism and TAG biosynthesis. Here, via a forward genetic screen for TAG homeostasis, we isolated a Chlamydomonas (Chlamydomonas reinhardtii) mutant (bkdE1α) that is deficient in the E1α subunit of the branched-chain ketoacid dehydrogenase (BCKDH) complex. Metabolomics analysis revealed a defect in the catabolism of branched-chain amino acids in bkdE1α Furthermore, this mutant accumulated 30% less TAG than the parental strain during N starvation and was compromised in TAG remobilization upon N resupply. Intriguingly, the rate of mitochondrial respiration was 20% to 35% lower in bkdE1α compared with the parental strains. Three additional knockout mutants of the other components of the BCKDH complex exhibited phenotypes similar to that of bkdE1α Transcriptional responses of BCKDH to different N status were consistent with its role in TAG homeostasis. Collectively, these results indicate that branched-chain amino acid catabolism contributes to TAG metabolism by providing carbon precursors and ATP, thus highlighting the complex interplay between distinct subcellular metabolisms for oil storage in green microalgae.",Differential Antibody-Based Immune Response against Isolated GP1 Receptor-Binding Domains from Lassa and Junín Viruses.,https://www.ncbi.nlm.nih.gov/pubmed/30728269,Journal of virology,2019 04 21,"There are two predominant subgroups in the Arenaviridae family of viruses, the Old World and the New World viruses, that use distinct cellular receptors for entry. While New World viruses typically elicit good neutralizing antibody responses, the Old World viruses generally evade such responses. Antibody-based immune responses are directed against the glycoprotein spike complexes that decorate the viruses. A thick coat of glycans reduces the accessibility of antibodies to the surface of spike complexes from Old World viruses, but other mechanisms may further hamper the development of efficient humoral responses. Specifically, it was suggested that the GP1 receptor-binding module of the Old World Lassa virus might help with evasion of the humoral response. Here we investigated the immunogenicity of the GP1 domain from Lassa virus and compared it to that of the GP1 domain from the New World Junín virus. We found striking differences in the ability of antibodies that were developed against these immunogens to target the same GP1 receptor-binding domains in the context of the native spike complexes. Whereas GP1 from Junín virus elicited productive neutralizing responses, GP1 from Lassa virus elicited only nonproductive responses. These differences can be rationalized by the conformational changes that GP1 from Lassa virus but not GP1 from Junín virus undergoes after dissociating from the trimeric spike complex. Hence, shedding of GP1 in the case of Lassa virus can indeed serve as a mechanism to subvert the humoral immune response. Moreover, the realization that a recombinant protein may be used to elicit a productive response against the New World Junín virus may suggest a novel and safe way to design future vaccines.IMPORTANCE Some viruses that belong to the Arenaviridae family, like Lassa and Junín viruses, are notorious human pathogens, which may lead to fatal outcomes when they infect people. It is thus important to develop means to combat these viruses. For developing effective vaccines, it is vital to understand the basic mechanisms that these viruses utilize in order to evade or overcome host immune responses. It was previously noted that the GP1 receptor-binding domain from Lassa virus is shed and accumulates in the serum of infected individuals. This raised the possibility that Lassa virus GP1 may function as an immunological decoy. Here we demonstrate that mice develop nonproductive immune responses against GP1 from Lassa virus, which is in contrast to the effective neutralizing responses that GP1 from Junín virus elicits. Thus, GP1 from Lassa virus is indeed an immunological decoy and GP1 from Junín virus may serve as a constituent of a future vaccine.",Baculovirus IE2 Interacts with Viral DNA through Daxx To Generate an Organized Nuclear Body Structure for Gene Activation in Vero Cells.,https://www.ncbi.nlm.nih.gov/pubmed/30728268,Journal of virology,2019 04 21,"Upon virus infection of a cell, the uncoated DNA is usually blocked by the host intrinsic immune system inside the nucleus. Although it is crucial for the virus to counteract the host intrinsic immune system and access its genome, little is known about how viruses can knock down host restriction and identify their blocked genomes for later viral gene activation and replication. We found that upon baculovirus transduction into Vero E6 cells, the invading viral DNA is trapped by the cellular death domain-associated protein (Daxx) and histone H3.3 in the nucleus, resulting in gene inactivation. IE2, a baculovirus transactivator, targets host Daxx through IE2 SUMO-interacting motifs (SIMs) to indirectly access viral DNA and forms unique nuclear body structures, which we term clathrate cage-like apparatus (CCLAs), at the early transduction stage. At the later transduction stage, CCLAs gradually enlarge, and IE2 continues to closely interact with viral DNA but no longer associates with Daxx. The association with Daxx is essential for IE2 CCLA formation, and the enlarged CCLAs are capable of transactivating viral but not chromosomal DNA of Vero E6 cells. Our study reveals that baculovirus IE2 counteracts the cellular intrinsic immune system by specifically targeting Daxx and H3.3 to associate with viral DNA indirectly and efficiently. IE2 then utilizes this association with viral DNA to establish a unique CCLA cellular nanomachinery, which is visible under light microscopy as an enclosed environment for proper viral gene expression.IMPORTANCE The major breakthrough of this work is that viral protein IE2 localizes and transactivates its own viral DNA through a most unlikely route, i.e., host proteins Daxx and H3.3, which are designed to efficiently restrict viral DNA from expression. By interacting with these host intrinsic immune factors, IE2 can thus target the viral DNA and then form a unique spherical nuclear body, which we name the CCLA, to enclose the viral DNA and necessary factors to assist in high-level transactivation. Our study represents one of the most complete investigations of nuclear body formation. In addition, so far only RNA or protein molecules have been reported as potential nucleators for initiating nuclear body formation; our study may represent the first example showing that DNA can be a nucleator for a new class of nuclear body formation.",Conserved Gammaherpesvirus Protein Kinase Selectively Promotes Irrelevant B Cell Responses.,https://www.ncbi.nlm.nih.gov/pubmed/30728267,Journal of virology,2019 04 21,"Gammaherpesviruses are ubiquitous pathogens that are associated with B cell lymphomas. In the early stages of chronic infection, these viruses infect naive B cells and subsequently usurp the B cell differentiation process through the germinal center response to ensure latent infection of long-lived memory B cells. A unique feature of early gammaherpesvirus chronic infection is a robust differentiation of irrelevant, virus-nonspecific B cells with reactivities against self-antigens and antigens of other species. In contrast, protective, virus-specific humoral responses do not reach peak levels until a much later time. While several host factors are known to either promote or selectively restrict gammaherpesvirus-driven germinal center response, viral mechanisms that contribute to the irrelevant B cell response have not been defined. In this report we show that the expression and the enzymatic activity of the gammaherpesvirus-encoded conserved protein kinase selectively facilitates the irrelevant, but not virus-specific, B cell responses. Further, we show that lack of interleukin-1 (IL-1) receptor attenuates gammaherpesvirus-driven B cell differentiation and viral reactivation. Because germinal center B cells are thought to be the target of malignant transformation during gammaherpesvirus-driven lymphomagenesis, identification of host and viral factors that promote germinal center responses during gammaherpesvirus infection may offer an insight into the mechanism of gammaherpesvirus pathogenesis.IMPORTANCE Gammaherpesviruses are ubiquitous cancer-associated pathogens that usurp the B cell differentiation process to establish life-long latent infection in memory B cells. A unique feature of early gammaherpesvirus infection is the robust increase in differentiation of B cells that are not specific for viral antigens and instead encode antibodies that react with self-antigens and antigens of other species. Viral mechanisms that are involved in driving such irrelevant B cell differentiation are not known. Here, we show that gammaherpesvirus-encoded conserved protein kinase and host IL-1 signaling promote irrelevant B cell responses and gammaherpesvirus-driven germinal center responses, with the latter thought to be the target of viral transformation."

HDV produces three processed RNAs that accumulate in infected cells: the circular genome; the circular antigenome, which serves as a replication intermediate; and lesser amounts of the mRNA, which encodes the sole viral protein, hepatitis delta antigen (HDAg). The HDV genome and antigenome RNAs form ribonucleoprotein complexes with HDAg. Although HDAg is required for HDV replication, it is not known how the relative amounts of HDAg and HDV RNA affect replication, or whether HDAg synthesis is regulated by the virus. Using a novel transfection system in which HDV replication is initiated using in vitro-synthesized circular HDV RNAs, HDV replication was found to depend strongly on the relative amounts of HDV RNA and HDAg. HDV controls these relative amounts via differential effects of HDAg on the production of HDV mRNA and antigenome RNA, both of which are synthesized from the genome RNA template. mRNA synthesis is favored at low HDAg levels but becomes saturated at high HDAg concentrations. Antigenome RNA accumulation increases linearly with HDAg and dominates at high HDAg levels. These results provide a conceptual model for how HDV antigenome RNA production and mRNA transcription are controlled from the earliest stage of infection onward and also demonstrate that, in this control, HDV behaves similarly to other negative-strand RNA viruses, even though there is no genetic similarity between them.IMPORTANCE Hepatitis delta virus (HDV) is a satellite of hepatitis B virus that increases the severity of liver disease; approximately 15 million people are chronically infected worldwide. There are no licensed therapies available. HDV is not related to any known virus, and few details regarding its replication cycle are known. One key question is whether and how HDV regulates the relative amounts of viral RNA and protein in infected cells. Such regulation might be important because the HDV RNA and protein form complexes that are essential for HDV replication, and the proper stoichiometry of these complexes could be critical for their function. Our results show that the relative amounts of HDV RNA and protein in cells are indeed important for HDV replication and that the virus does control them. These observations indicate that further study of these regulatory mechanisms is required to better understand replication of this serious human pathogen.",Punctuated Evolution of Myxoma Virus: Rapid and Disjunct Evolution of a Recent Viral Lineage in Australia.,https://www.ncbi.nlm.nih.gov/pubmed/30728252,Journal of virology,2019 04 21,"Myxoma virus (MYXV) has been evolving in a novel host species-European rabbits-in Australia since 1950. Previous studies of viruses sampled from 1950 to 1999 revealed a remarkably clock-like evolutionary process across all Australian lineages of MYXV. Through an analysis of 49 newly generated MYXV genome sequences isolated in Australia between 2008 and 2017, we show that MYXV evolution in Australia can be characterized by three lineages, one of which exhibited a greatly elevated rate of evolutionary change and a dramatic breakdown of temporal structure. Phylogenetic analysis revealed that this apparently punctuated evolutionary event occurred between 1996 and 2012. The branch leading to the rapidly evolving lineage contained a relatively high number of nonsynonymous substitutions, and viruses in this lineage reversed a mutation found in the progenitor standard laboratory strain (SLS) and all previous sequences that disrupts the reading frame of the M005L/R gene. Analysis of genes encoding proteins involved in DNA synthesis or RNA transcription did not reveal any mutations likely to cause rapid evolution. Although there was some evidence for recombination across the MYXV phylogeny, this was not associated with the increase in the evolutionary rate. The period from 1996 to 2012 saw significant declines in wild rabbit numbers, due to the introduction of rabbit hemorrhagic disease and prolonged drought in southeastern Australia, followed by the partial recovery of populations. It is therefore possible that a rapidly changing environment for virus transmission changed the selection pressures faced by MYXV, altering the course and pace of virus evolution.IMPORTANCE The coevolution of myxoma virus (MYXV) and European rabbits in Australia is one of the most important natural experiments in evolutionary biology, providing insights into virus adaptation to new hosts and the evolution of virulence. Previous studies of MYXV evolution have also shown that the virus evolves both relatively rapidly and in a strongly clock-like manner. Using newly acquired MYXV genome sequences from Australia, we show that the virus has experienced a dramatic change in evolutionary behavior over the last 20 years, with a breakdown in clock-like structure, the appearance of a rapidly evolving virus lineage, and the accumulation of multiple nonsynonymous and indel mutations. We suggest that this punctuated evolutionary event may reflect a change in selection pressures as rabbit numbers declined following the introduction of rabbit hemorrhagic disease virus and drought in the geographic regions inhabited by rabbits.",The Pseudoknot Region of the 5' Untranslated Region Is a Determinant of Viral Tropism and Virulence of Foot-and-Mouth Disease Virus.,https://www.ncbi.nlm.nih.gov/pubmed/30728251,Journal of virology,2019 04 21,"Foot-and-mouth disease virus (FMDV) is the causative agent of foot-and-mouth disease. It is characterized by genetic instability and different antigenic properties. The nonstructural protein 3A is a primary determinant of the tropism and virulence of Cathay topotype FMDVs. However, several other determinants are also speculated to be involved in viral tropism and virulence. Deletion of 43 nucleotides (nt) in the pseudoknot (PK) region of the 5' untranslated region (UTR) has been found to coexist with the identified 3A deletion in Cathay topotype FMDV genomes. In this study, we isolated an O/ME-SA/PanAsia lineage FMDV strain, O/GD/CHA/2015, that includes an 86-nt deletion in the PK region and shows a porcinophilic phenotype. To investigate the potential role of the PK region in viral pathogenicity, we generated a recombinant FMDV strain with an incomplete PK region and compared its virulence and pathogenesis to the intact FMDV strain in swine and bovines. Deletion of the 86 nt in the PKs had no major effects on the pathogenicity of the virus in swine but significantly attenuated its ability to infect bovine cells and cattle, indicating that the PK region is a newly discovered determinant of viral tropism and virulence. The role of the 43-nt deletion existing in the Cathay topotype FMDV was also investigated by evaluating the infection properties of genetically engineered viruses. Consistently, the 43-nt deletion in the PK region significantly decreased the pathogenicity of the virus in bovines. Overall, our findings suggest that the PK region deletion occurred naturally in the FMDV genome and that the PK region is highly associated with viral host range and functions as a novel determinant for FMDV pathogenesis.IMPORTANCE This study demonstrates that the deletion in the PK region occurred naturally in the FMDV genome. The isolated O/ME-SA/PanAsia lineage FMDV with an 86-nt deletion in the PK region showed a pig-adapted characteristic that could cause clinical signs in swine but not bovines. Compared to the wild-type FMDV strain, which possesses full infection capacity in both swine and bovines, the recombinant virus with the 86-nt deletion in the PK region is deficient in causing disease in bovines. Deletion of the previously reported 43 nt in the PK region also led to significantly decreased pathogenicity of FMDV in bovines. This study indicates that the PK region is a novel determinant of the tropism and virulence of FMDV.",Contractile Effects of Serotonin (5-HT) in the Rat Cauda Epididymis: Expression and Functional Characterization of 5-HT Receptors.,https://www.ncbi.nlm.nih.gov/pubmed/30728250,The Journal of pharmacology and experimental therapeutics,2019 03 14,"Serotonin [5-hydroxytryptamine (5-HT)] exerts multiple central and peripheral functions. High concentrations of 5-HT have been found in the epididymis, a ductal organ that plays pivotal roles in sperm transport and maturation. The contraction of the epididymal smooth muscle is essential for sperm transport and emission during ejaculation. The contributions of the epididymal 5-HT system to these events are poorly understood. Here, we assessed the contractile function of 5-HT in the rat cauda epididymis (CE), pharmacologically targeting the receptor(s) and the reuptake mechanism involved in this system. Segments of CE duct from adult Wistar rats were set up in an organ bath system for isometric tension recordings, and concentration-response curves to 5-HT and norepinephrine were obtained. 5-HT elicited concentration-dependent contractions of the CE duct (pEC50 = 6.5 ± 0.1) that were potentiated with high potency by the norepinephrine transporter (NET) inhibitor desipramine and with low potency by the highly selective serotonin transporter inhibitor paroxetine, indicating that the NET is the major mediator of 5-HT reuptake in vitro. CE contractions to 5-HT were antagonized by the α1-adrenoceptor (α1-AR) antagonist prazosin (pA2 ≅ 8.9), 5-HT2A/2C antagonists ketanserin (pA2 ≅ 9.4) and fluoxetine (pA2 ≅ 7.4), and 5-HT1A ligands WAY 100635 (pA2 ≅ 8.9) and buspirone (pA2 ≅ 7.3). Reverse transcriptase polymerase chain reaction analysis demonstrated that 5-HT1A and 5-HT2A transcripts are highly abundant in the cauda epididymis, whereas 5-HT2C transcript was not found. Altogether, our results reveal that contractions of the CE duct to 5-HT encompasses at least activation of α1-ARs and 5-HT1A and 5-HT2A receptors, providing new insights into the roles of 5-HT on the epididymal function.",Initial Characterization of Transgenic Mice Overexpressing Human Histamine H2 Receptors.,https://www.ncbi.nlm.nih.gov/pubmed/30728249,The Journal of pharmacology and experimental therapeutics,2019 03 19,"In an integrative approach, we studied the role of histamine H2 receptors in the mouse heart. We noted that histamine, added cumulatively to the organ bath, failed to affect the force of contraction in left atrial preparations and did not change spontaneous heart rate in right atrial preparations from wild-type mice. By contrast, in the same preparations from mice that overexpressed the human H2 receptor in a cardiac-specific way, histamine exerted concentration- and time-dependent positive inotropic and positive chronotropic effects. Messenger RNA of the human H2 receptor was only detected in transgenic mice. Likewise, immunohistology and autoradiography only gave signals in transgenic but not in wild-type cardiac preparations. Similarly, a positive inotropic and positive chronotropic effect was observed with histamine in echocardiography of living transgenic mice and isolated perfused hearts (Langendorff preparation). Phosphorylation of phospholamban was increased in atrial and ventricular preparations from transgenic mice, but not in wild-type animals. The effects of histamine were mimicked by dimaprit and amthamine and antagonized by cimetidine. In summary, we generated a new model to study the physiologic and pathophysiologic cardiac role of the human H2 receptor.",Long-term engraftment of human cardiomyocytes combined with biodegradable microparticles induces heart repair.,https://www.ncbi.nlm.nih.gov/pubmed/30728248,The Journal of pharmacology and experimental therapeutics,2019 02 07,"Cardiomyocytes derived from human induced pluripotent stem cells (hiPSC-CMs) are a promising cell source for cardiac repair after myocardial infarction (MI) as they offer several advantages, such as potential to remuscularize infarcted tissue, integration in the host myocardium and paracrine therapeutic effects. However, cell delivery issues have limited their potential application in clinical practice, showing poor survival and engraftment after transplantation. In this work, we hypothesized that the combination of hiPSC-CMs with microparticles (MPs) could enhance the long-term cell survival and retention in the heart and consequently improve cardiac repair. CMs were obtained by differentiation of hiPSC by small-molecule manipulation of the Wnt-pathway, and adhered to biomimetic poly(lactic-co-glycolic acid) MPs covered with collagen and poly-D-lysine. The potential of the system to support cell survival was analyzed in vitro, demonstrating a 1.70-fold and 1.99-fold increase in cell survival after 1 and 4 days, respectively. The efficacy of the system was tested in a mouse MI model. Interestingly, two months after administration, transplanted hiPSC-CMs could be detected in the peri-infarct area. These cells not only maintained the cardiac phenotype but also showed in vivo maturation and signs of electrical coupling. Importantly, cardiac function was significantly improved, which could be attributed to a paracrine effect of cells. These findings suggest that MPs represent an excellent platform for cell delivery in the field of cardiac repair, which could also be translated into an enhancement of the potential of cell-based therapies in other medical applications.",Functional genomics of epilepsy-associated mutations in the GABAA receptor subunits reveal that one mutation impairs function and two are catastrophic.,https://www.ncbi.nlm.nih.gov/pubmed/30728247,The Journal of biological chemistry,2019 04 17,"A number of epilepsy-causing mutations have recently been identified in the genes of the α1, β3, and γ2 subunits comprising the γ-aminobutyric acid type A (GABAA) receptor. These mutations are typically dominant, and in certain cases, such as the α1 and β3 subunits, they may lead to a mix of receptors at the cell surface that contain no mutant subunits, a single mutated subunit, or two mutated subunits. To determine the effects of mutations in a single subunit or in two subunits on receptor activation, we created a concatenated protein assembly that links all five subunits of the α1β3γ2 receptor and expresses them in the correct orientation. We created nine separate receptor variants with a single-mutant subunit and four receptors containing two subunits of the γ2R323Q, β3D120N, β3T157M, β3Y302C, and β3S254F epilepsy-causing mutations. We found that the singly mutated γ2R323Q subunit impairs GABA activation of the receptor by reducing GABA potency. A single β3D120N, β3T157M, or β3Y302C mutation also substantially impaired receptor activation, and two copies of these mutants within a receptor were catastrophic. Of note, an effect of the β3S254F mutation on GABA potency depended on the location of this mutant subunit within the receptor, possibly because of the membrane environment surrounding the transmembrane region of the receptor. Our results highlight that precise functional genomic analyses of GABAA receptor mutations using concatenated constructs can identify receptors with an intermediate phenotype that contribute to epileptic phenotypes and that are potential drug targets for precision medicine approaches.",A comprehensive in vitro fluorescence anisotropy assay system for screening ligands of the jasmonate COI1-JAZ co-receptor in plants.,https://www.ncbi.nlm.nih.gov/pubmed/30728246,The Journal of biological chemistry,2019 04 03,"The phytohormone (+)-7-iso-jasmonoyl-l-isoleucine regulates many developmental and stress responses in plants and induces protein-protein interactions between COI1, the F-box component of E3 ubiquitin ligase, and jasmonate ZIM domain (JAZ) repressors. These interactions cause JAZ degradation and activate jasmonate (JA), leading to plant defense responses, growth inhibition, and senescence. Thirteen JAZ subtypes are encoded in the Arabidopsis thaliana genome, but a detailed understanding of the physiological functions of these JAZ subtypes remains unclear, partially because of the genetic redundancy of JAZ genes. One strategy to elucidate the complex JA signaling pathways is to develop a reliable and comprehensive binding assay system of the ligands with all combinations of the co-receptors. Herein, we report the development of a fluorescence anisotropy-based in vitro binding assay system to screen for the ligands of the COI1-JAZ co-receptors. Our assay enabled the first quantitative analysis of the affinity values and JAZ-subtype selectivity of various endogenous JA derivatives, such as coronatine, jasmonic acid, and 12-hydroxyjasmonoyl-l-isoleucine. Because of its high signal-to-noise ratio and convenient mix-and-read assay system, our screening approach can be used in plate reader-based assays of both agonists and antagonists of COI1-JAZ co-receptors.",Stabilization of the V2 loop improves the presentation of V2 loop-associated broadly neutralizing antibody epitopes on HIV-1 envelope trimers.,https://www.ncbi.nlm.nih.gov/pubmed/30728245,The Journal of biological chemistry,2019 04 17,"A successful HIV-1 vaccine will likely need to elicit broadly neutralizing antibodies (bNAbs) that target the envelope glycoprotein (Env) spike on the virus. Native-like recombinant Env trimers of the SOSIP design now serve as a platform for achieving this challenging goal. However, SOSIP trimers usually do not bind efficiently to the inferred germline precursors of bNAbs (gl-bNAbs). We hypothesized that the inherent flexibilities of the V1 and V2 variable loops in the Env trimer contribute to the poor recognition of gl-bNAb epitopes at the trimer apex that extensively involve V2 residues. To reduce local V2 flexibility and improve the binding of V2-dependent bNAbs and gl-bNAbs, we designed BG505 SOSIP.664 trimer variants containing newly created disulfide bonds intended to stabilize the V2 loop in an optimally antigenic configuration. The first variant, I184C/E190C, contained a new disulfide bond within the V2 loop, whereas the second variant, E153C/R178C, had a new disulfide bond that cross-linked V2 and V1. The resulting engineered native-like trimer variants were both more reactive with and were neutralized by V2 bNAbs and gl-bNAbs, a finding that may be valuable in the design of germline targeting and boosting trimer immunogens to create an antigenic conformation optimal for HIV vaccine development.","Free, unlinked glycosylphosphatidylinositols on mammalian cell surfaces revisited.",https://www.ncbi.nlm.nih.gov/pubmed/30728244,The Journal of biological chemistry,2019 04 03,"Glycosylphosphatidylinositols (GPIs) are linked to many cell-surface proteins, anchor these proteins in the membrane, and are well characterized. However, GPIs that exist in the free form on the mammalian cell surface remain largely unexplored. To investigate free GPIs in cultured cell lines and mouse tissues, here we used the T5-4E10 mAb (T5 mAb), which recognizes unlinked GPIs having an N-acetylgalactosamine (GalNAc) side chain linked to the first mannose at the nonreducing terminus. We detected free GPIs bearing the GalNAc side chain on the surface of Neuro2a and CHO, but not of HEK293, K562, and C2C12 cells. Furthermore, free GPIs were present in mouse pons, medulla oblongata, spinal cord, testis, epididymis, and kidney. Using a panel of Chinese hamster ovary cells defective in both GPI-transamidase and GPI remodeling pathway, we demonstrate that free GPIs follow the same structural remodeling pathway during passage from the endoplasmic reticulum to the plasma membrane as do protein-linked GPI. Specifically, free GPIs underwent post-GPI attachment to protein 1 (PGAP1)-mediated inositol deacylation, PGAP5-mediated removal of the ethanolamine phosphate from the second mannose, and PGAP3- and PGAP2-mediated fatty acid remodeling. Moreover, T5 mAb recognized free GPIs even if the inositol-linked acyl chain or ethanolamine-phosphate side chain linked to the second mannose is not removed. In contrast, addition of a fourth mannose by phosphatidylinositol glycan anchor biosynthesis class Z (PIGZ) inhibited T5 mAb-mediated detection of free GPIs. Our results indicate that free GPIs are normal components of the plasma membrane in some tissues and further characterize free GPIs in mammalian cells."

The accepted hypothesis for this trait has been its role in respiration, to warm and humidify air as it is inspired. However, new studies testing the key assumptions of the conditioning hypothesis, such as the importance of turbulence to enhance heat and moisture exchange, have called this hypothesis into question. The human nose has two functions, however, respiration and olfaction. It is thus also possible that the external nose evolved in response to selection for olfaction. The genus Homo had many adaptations for long-distance locomotion, which allowed Homo erectus to greatly expand its species range, from Africa to Asia. Long-distance navigation in birds and other species is often accomplished by orientation to environmental odors. Such olfactory navigation, in turn, is enhanced by stereo olfaction, made possible by the separation of the olfactory sensors. By these principles, the human external nose could have evolved to separate olfactory inputs to enhance stereo olfaction. This could also explain why nose shape later became so variable: as humans became more sedentary in the Neolithic, a decreasing need for long-distance movements could have been replaced by selection for other olfactory functions, such as detecting disease, that would have been critical to survival in newly dense human settlements.",Navigation and the developing brain.,https://www.ncbi.nlm.nih.gov/pubmed/30728229,The Journal of experimental biology,2019 02 07,"As babies rapidly acquire motor skills that give them increasingly independent and wide-ranging access to the environment over the first two years of human life, they decrease their reliance on habit systems for spatial localization, switching to their emerging inertial navigation system and to allocentric frameworks. Initial place learning is evident towards the end of the period. From 3 to 10 years, children calibrate their ability to encode various sources of spatial information (inertial information, geometric cues, beacons, proximal landmarks and distal landmarks) and begin to combine cues, both within and across systems. Geometric cues are important, but do not constitute an innate and encapsulated module. In addition, from 3 to 10 years, children build the capacity to think about frames of reference different from their current one (i.e. to perform perspective taking). By around 12 years, we see adult-level performance and adult patterns of individual differences on cognitive mapping tasks requiring the integration of vista views of space into environmental space. These lines of development are continuous rather than stage-like. Spatial development builds on important beginnings in the neural systems of newborns, but changes in experience-expectant ways with motor development, action in the world and success-failure feedback. Human systems for integrating and manipulating spatial information also benefit from symbolic capacities and technological inventions.",Celestial navigation in Drosophila.,https://www.ncbi.nlm.nih.gov/pubmed/30728228,The Journal of experimental biology,2019 02 07,"Many casual observers typecast Drosophila melanogaster as a stationary pest that lurks around fruit and wine. However, the omnipresent fruit fly, which thrives even in desert habitats, likely established and maintained its cosmopolitan status via migration over large spatial scales. To perform long-distance dispersal, flies must actively maintain a straight compass heading through the use of external orientation cues, such as those derived from the sky. In this Review, we address how D. melanogaster accomplishes long-distance navigation using celestial cues. We focus on behavioral and physiological studies indicating that fruit flies can navigate both to a pattern of linearly polarized light and to the position of the sun - the same cues utilized by more heralded insect navigators such as monarch butterflies and desert ants. In both cases, fruit flies perform menotaxis, selecting seemingly arbitrary headings that they then maintain over time. We discuss how the fly's nervous system detects and processes this sensory information to direct the steering maneuvers that underlie navigation. In particular, we highlight recent findings that compass neurons in the central complex, a set of midline neuropils, are essential for navigation. Taken together, these results suggest that fruit flies share an ancient, latent capacity for celestial navigation with other insects. Furthermore, they illustrate the potential of D. melanogaster to help us to elucidate both the cellular basis of navigation and mechanisms of directed dispersal on a landscape scale.",Olfactory navigation in aquatic gastropods.,https://www.ncbi.nlm.nih.gov/pubmed/30728227,The Journal of experimental biology,2019 02 07,"Gastropod diversity is substantial in marine and freshwater habitats, and many aquatic slugs and snails use olfactory cues to guide their navigation behaviour. Examples include finding prey or avoiding predators based on kairomones, or finding potential mates using pheromones. Here, I review the diversity of navigational behaviours studied across the major aquatic taxa of gastropods. I then synthesize evidence for the different theoretical navigation strategies the animals may use. It is likely that gastropods regularly use either chemotaxis or odour-gated rheotaxis (or both) during olfactory-based navigation. Finally, I collate the patchwork of research conducted on relevant proximate mechanisms that could produce navigation behaviours. Although the tractability of several gastropod species for neurophysiological experimentation has generated some valuable insight into how turning behaviour is triggered by contact chemoreception, there remain many substantial gaps in our understanding for how navigation relative to more distant odour sources is controlled in gastropods. These gaps include little information on the chemoreceptors and mechanoreceptors (for detecting flow) found in the peripheral nervous system and the central (or peripheral) processing circuits that integrate that sensory input. In contrast, past studies do provide information on motor neurons that control the effectors that produce crawling (both forward locomotion and turning). Thus, there is plenty of scope for further research on olfactory-based navigation, exploiting the tractability of gastropods for neuroethology to better understand how the nervous system processes chemosensory input to generate movement towards or away from distant odour sources.",Using on-board sound recordings to infer behaviour of free-moving wild animals.,https://www.ncbi.nlm.nih.gov/pubmed/30728226,The Journal of experimental biology,2019 02 07,"Technological advances in the last 20 years have enabled researchers to develop increasingly sophisticated miniature devices (tags) that record an animal's behaviour not from an observational, external viewpoint, but directly on the animals themselves. So far, behavioural research with these tags has mostly been conducted using movement or acceleration data. But on-board audio recordings have become more and more common following pioneering work in marine mammal research. The first questions that come to mind when recording sound on-board animals concern their vocal behaviour. When are they calling? How do they adjust their behaviour? What acoustic parameters do they change and how? However, other topics like foraging behaviour, social interactions or environmental acoustics can now be addressed as well and offer detailed insight into the animals' daily life. In this Review, we discuss the possibilities, advantages and limitations of on-board acoustic recordings. We focus primarily on bats as their active-sensing, echolocating lifestyle allows many approaches to a multi-faceted acoustic assessment of their behaviour. The general ideas and concepts, however, are applicable to many animals and hopefully will demonstrate the versatility of on-board acoustic recordings and stimulate new research.",There and back again: natal homing by magnetic navigation in sea turtles and salmon.,https://www.ncbi.nlm.nih.gov/pubmed/30728225,The Journal of experimental biology,2019 02 07,"Diverse marine animals migrate across vast expanses of seemingly featureless ocean before returning as adults to reproduce in the area where they originated. How animals accomplish such feats of natal homing is an enduring mystery. Growing evidence suggests, however, that sea turtles and salmon imprint on the magnetic field of their home area when young and then use this information to return as adults. Both turtles and salmon have the sensory abilities needed to detect the unique 'magnetic signature' of a coastal area. Analyses have revealed that, for both groups of animals, subtle changes in the geomagnetic field of the home region are correlated with changes in natal homing behavior. In turtles, a relationship between population genetic structure and the magnetic fields that exist at nesting beaches has also been detected, consistent with the hypothesis that turtles recognize their natal areas on the basis of magnetic cues. Salmon likely use a biphasic navigational strategy in which magnetic cues guide fish through the open sea and into the proximity of the home river where chemical cues allow completion of the spawning migration. Similarly, turtles may also exploit local cues to help pinpoint nesting areas once they have arrived in the vicinity. Throughout most of the natal homing migration, however, magnetic navigation appears to be the primary mode of long-distance guidance in both sea turtles and salmon.",International Consensus on Risk Management of Diabetic Ketoacidosis in Patients With Type 1 Diabetes Treated With Sodium-Glucose Cotransporter (SGLT) Inhibitors.,https://www.ncbi.nlm.nih.gov/pubmed/30728224,Diabetes care,2019 05 21,"Sodium-glucose cotransporter (SGLT) inhibitors are new oral antidiabetes medications shown to effectively reduce glycated hemoglobin (A1C) and glycemic variability, blood pressure, and body weight without intrinsic properties to cause hypoglycemia in people with type 1 diabetes.

Some cases presented with near-normal blood glucose levels or mild hyperglycemia, complicating the recognition/diagnosis of DKA and potentially delaying treatment. Several SGLT inhibitors are currently under review by the U.S. Food and Drug Administration and European regulatory agencies as adjuncts to insulin therapy in people with type 1 diabetes.

High sequence diversity of HCV and inadequate drug exposure during unsuccessful treatment may lead to the accumulation of variants with reduced susceptibility to DAAs, including NS3/4A protease inhibitors such as voxilaprevir. The voxilaprevir susceptibility of clinical and laboratory strains of HCV was assessed. The NS3 protease regions of viruses belonging to 6 genotypes and 29 subtypes from 345 DAA-naive or -experienced (including protease inhibitor) patients and 344 genotype 1 to 6 replicons bearing engineered NS3 resistance-associated substitutions (RASs) were tested in transient-transfection assays. The median voxilaprevir 50% effective concentration against NS3 from protease inhibitor-naive patient samples ranged from 0.38 nM for genotype 1 to 5.8 nM for genotype 3. Voxilaprevir susceptibilities of HCV replicons with NS3 RASs were dependent on subtype background and the type and number of substitutions introduced. The majority of RASs known to confer resistance to other protease inhibitors had little to no impact on voxilaprevir susceptibility, except A156L, T, or V in genotype 1 to 4 which conferred >100-fold reductions but exhibited low replication capacity in most genotypes. These data support the use of voxilaprevir in combination with other DAAs in DAA-naive and DAA-experienced patients infected with any subtype of HCV.",Phylogenomic Pipeline Validation for Foodborne Pathogen Disease Surveillance.,https://www.ncbi.nlm.nih.gov/pubmed/30728194,Journal of clinical microbiology,2019 06 10,"Foodborne pathogen surveillance in the United States is transitioning from strain identification using restriction digest technology (pulsed-field gel electrophoresis [PFGE]) to shotgun sequencing of the entire genome (whole-genome sequencing [WGS]). WGS requires a new suite of analysis tools, some of which have long histories in academia but are new to the field of public health and regulatory decision making. Although the general workflow is fairly standard for collecting and analyzing WGS data for disease surveillance, there are a number of differences in how the data are collected and analyzed across public health agencies, both nationally and internationally. This impedes collaborative public health efforts, so national and international efforts are underway to enable direct comparison of these different analysis methods. Ultimately, the harmonization efforts will allow the (mutually trusted and understood) production and analysis of WGS data by labs and agencies worldwide, thus improving outbreak response capabilities globally. This review provides a historical perspective on the use of WGS for pathogen tracking and summarizes the efforts underway to ensure the major steps in phylogenomic pipelines used for pathogen disease surveillance can be readily validated. The tools for doing this will ensure that the results produced are sound, reproducible, and comparable across different analytic approaches.",Virulence-Related Genes and Coenteropathogens Associated with Clinical Outcomes of Enteropathogenic Escherichia coli Infections in Children from the Brazilian Semiarid Region: a Case-Control Study of Diarrhea.,https://www.ncbi.nlm.nih.gov/pubmed/30728193,Journal of clinical microbiology,2019 04 14,"Enteropathogenic Escherichia coli (EPEC) is a major cause of diarrhea in children from developing countries and presents high genetic variability. We aimed to characterize the EPEC virulence-related gene (VRG) distribution and copathogens associated with diarrhea and nutrition-related outcomes in children from the low-income Brazilian semiarid region. A cross-sectional case-control study of diarrhea was conducted in 1,191 children aged 2 to 36 months from the northeast region of Brazil. Stool samples were collected and clinical, epidemiological, and anthropometric data were identified from each child. A broad molecular evaluation of enteropathogens was performed, and EPEC-positive samples were further investigated for 18 VRGs using five multiplex PCRs. EPEC was detected in 28.2% of the study population, with similar proportions among cases and controls. Typical EPEC (tEPEC) infections were more often associated with diarrhea than atypical EPEC (aEPEC) infections, while aEPEC infections presented a higher prevalence. The VRG ler, a negative regulator of the locus of enterocyte effacement, was associated with the absence of diarrhea in aEPEC-positive children; espB, a major component of the type 3 secretion system, was associated with diarrhea in tEPEC-positive children; the presence of procolonization VRGs-the combination of cesT positivity, espP negativity, and the presence of the map gene-was associated with undernutrition; and Campylobacter spp., norovirus, and enteroaggregative E. coli (EAEC) coinfections were associated with increased clinical severity in EPEC-infected children. These data identified tEPEC strains associated with diarrhea and specific VRGs of EPEC (ler, espB, cesT, and map genes) and Campylobacter spp., norovirus, and EAEC to be major contributors to diarrhea and undernutrition in children from a low-income Brazilian region.",Epidemiological Typing of Serratia marcescens Isolates by Whole-Genome Multilocus Sequence Typing.,https://www.ncbi.nlm.nih.gov/pubmed/30728192,Journal of clinical microbiology,2019 04 14,"Serratia marcescens is an opportunistic bacterial pathogen. It is notorious for its increasing antimicrobial resistance and its potential to cause outbreaks of colonization and infections, predominantly in neonatal intensive care units (NICUs). There, its spread requires rapid infection control response. To understand its spread, detailed molecular typing is key. We present a whole-genome multilocus sequence typing (wgMLST) method for S. marcescens Using a set of 299 publicly available whole-genome sequences (WGS), we developed an initial wgMLST system consisting of 9,377 gene loci. This included 1,455 loci occurring in all reference genomes and 7,922 accessory loci. This closed system was validated using three geographically diverse collections of S. marcescens consisting of 111 clinical isolates implicated in nosocomial dissemination events in three hospitals. The validation procedure showed a full match between epidemiological data and the wgMLST analyses. We set the cutoff value for epidemiological (non)relatedness at 20 different alleles, though for the majority of outbreak-clustered isolates, this difference was limited to 4 alleles. This shows that the wgMLST system for S. marcescens provides prospects for successful future monitoring for the epidemiological containment of this opportunistic pathogen.",Heat Inactivation Renders Sputum Safe and Preserves Mycobacterium tuberculosis RNA for Downstream Molecular Tests.,https://www.ncbi.nlm.nih.gov/pubmed/30728191,Journal of clinical microbiology,2019 04 14,"The World Health Organization End Tuberculosis (TB) strategy has called for the development of-and increased access to-effective tools for diagnosis and treatment of TB disease. Mycobacterium tuberculosis , the causative agent of TB, is categorized as a highly infectious agent. Consequently, diagnostic tests that involve comprehensive manipulation of specimens from presumed tuberculosis cases must be performed in a category 3 laboratory. We have evaluated the use of heat inactivation to render TB samples safe to work with while preserving RNA for downstream molecular tests. Using Mycobacterium bovis bacillus Calmette-Guérin (BCG) cultures and TB-positive sputum samples, we show that boiling for 20 min at 80, 85, and 95°C inactivates all M. tuberculosis bacilli. The efficiency of inactivation was verified by culturing heat-treated and untreated (live) fractions of BCG and TB sputum samples for 42 days. No growth was observed in the cultures of heat-treated samples. In contrast, the optical density of untreated BCG in Middlebrook 7H9 broth rose from 0.04 to 0.85, and the untreated sputum samples flagged positive at 3 days of incubation in mycobacterial growth indicator tubes. Quantification of reference genes 16S rRNA, transfer-messenger RNA (tmRNA), pre-16S rRNA, and rpoB by reverse transcriptase quantitative PCR (RT-qPCR) showed minimal loss in estimated bacterial load. The loss was RNA species dependent, <1 log10, 1.1 log10, 1.3 log10, and 2.4 log10 estimated CFU/ml for 16S rRNA, tmRNA, pre-16S rRNA, and rpoB, respectively. The RNA loss was independent of inactivation temperature. These findings show that heat inactivation could obviate the need for category 3 laboratories to perform RNA-based testing of TB samples.","Candida auris Clinical Isolates from South Korea: Identification, Antifungal Susceptibility, and Genotyping.",https://www.ncbi.nlm.nih.gov/pubmed/30728190,Journal of clinical microbiology,2019 04 14,"Candida auris is an emerging worldwide fungal pathogen. Over the past 20 years, 61 patient isolates of C. auris (4 blood and 57 ear) have been obtained from 13 hospitals in Korea. Here, we reanalyzed those molecularly identified isolates using two matrix-assisted laser desorption ionization-time of flight mass spectrometry (MALDI-TOF MS) systems, including Biotyper and Vitek MS, followed by antifungal susceptibility testing, sequencing of the ERG11 gene, and genotyping. With a research-use-only (RUO) library, 83.6% and 93.4% of the isolates were correctly identified by Biotyper and Vitek MS, respectively. Using an in vitro diagnostic (IVD) library of Vitek MS, 96.7% of the isolates were correctly identified. Fluconazole-resistant isolates made up 62.3% of the isolates, while echinocandin- or multidrug-resistant isolates were not found. Excellent essential (within two dilutions, 96.7%) and categorical agreements (93.4%) between the Clinical and Laboratory Standards Institute (CLSI) and Vitek 2 (AST-YS07 card) methods were observed for fluconazole. Sequencing ERG11 for all 61 isolates revealed that only 3 fluconazole-resistant isolates showed the Erg11p amino acid substitution K143R. All 61 isolates showed identical multilocus sequence typing (MLST). Pulsed-field gel electrophoresis (PFGE) analyses revealed that both blood and ear isolates had the same or similar patterns. These results show that MALDI-TOF MS and Vitek 2 antifungal susceptibility systems can be reliable diagnostic tools for testing C. auris isolates from Korean hospitals. The Erg11p mutation was seldom found among Korean isolates of C. auris, and multidrug resistance was not found. Both MLST and PFGE analyses suggest that these isolates are genetically similar.",Canadian and UK/Ireland practice patterns in lumbar puncture performance in febrile neonates with bronchiolitis.,https://www.ncbi.nlm.nih.gov/pubmed/30728189,Emergency medicine journal : EMJ,2019 02 27,"Serious bacterial infections in young infants with bronchiolitis are rare.

It analyses challenges posed to the authority of diagnosis-both as medical label and mode of reading-within two memoirs about mental illness and celebrates the ensuing literary innovation in each text. As such, this article is situated as part of the continuing move within the critical medical humanities to develop more sophisticated readings of illness narratives and emphasises the importance of the role of literary studies to achieve this aim. Borrowing from and expanding Margaret Price's concept of the counterdiagnostic as a tool that challenges a reader's urge to explain, clarify and contain a narrator with mental disabilities, I will read Susanna Kaysen's Girl, Interrupted (1993) and Lauren Slater's Lying: A Metaphorical Memoir (2001) as two texts that challenge the organising structures of medical authority as they are manifested in diagnostic processes. In so doing I will reflect on the work of illness narratives and the force of the diagnostic moment, understood as a violent misreading of the expressions of mental illness in texts. My readings of these memoirs demonstrate how the material locations and political aesthetics of counterdiagnosis undermine the limited figuration of narrative offered by much work in narrative medicine, and deconstruct diagnosis, both in a medical and literary capacity. Counterdiagnosis is, then, posited as a crucial means of further opening up the analysis of illness narratives, specifically those of mental distress.",PLK1 plays dual roles in centralspindlin regulation during cytokinesis.,https://www.ncbi.nlm.nih.gov/pubmed/30728176,The Journal of cell biology,2019 06 13,"Cytokinesis begins upon anaphase onset. An early step involves local activation of the small GTPase RhoA, which triggers assembly of an actomyosin-based contractile ring at the equatorial cortex. Here, we delineated the contributions of PLK1 and Aurora B to RhoA activation and cytokinesis initiation in human cells. Knock-down of PRC1, which disrupts the spindle midzone, revealed the existence of two pathways that can initiate cleavage furrow ingression. One pathway depends on a well-organized spindle midzone and PLK1, while the other depends on Aurora B activity and centralspindlin at the equatorial cortex and can operate independently of PLK1. We further show that PLK1 inhibition sequesters centralspindlin onto the spindle midzone, making it unavailable for Aurora B at the equatorial cortex. We propose that PLK1 activity promotes the release of centralspindlin from the spindle midzone through inhibition of PRC1, allowing centralspindlin to function as a regulator of spindle midzone formation and as an activator of RhoA at the equatorial cortex.",Development of a prediction model for 1-year poor prognosis in patients with acute ischemic stroke.,https://www.ncbi.nlm.nih.gov/pubmed/30728175,Journal of investigative medicine : the official publication of the American Federation for Clinical Research,2019 02 07,"The goals of this study were to develop a new prediction model to predict 1-year poor prognosis (death or modified Rankin scale score of ≥3) in patients with acute ischemic stroke (AIS) and to compare the performance of the new prediction model with other prediction scales. Baseline data of 772 patients with AIS were collected, and univariate and multivariate logistic regression analyses were performed to identify independent risk factors for 1-year poor prognosis in patients with AIS. The area under the receiver operating characteristics curve (AUC) value of the new prediction model and the THRIVE, iScore and ASTRAL scores was compared. The Hosmer-Lemeshow test was used to assess the goodness of fit of the model. We identified 196 (25.4%) patients with poor prognosis at 1-year follow-up, and of these 68 (68/196, 34.7%) had died. Multivariate logistic regression and receiver operating characteristic curve analyses showed that age ≥70 years, consciousness (lethargy or coma), history of stroke or transient ischemic attack, cancer, abnormal fasting blood glucose levels ≥7.0 mmol/L, and National Institutes of Health Stroke Scale score were independent risk factors for 1-year poor prognosis in patients with AIS. Scores were assigned for each variable by rounding off β coefficient to the integer score, and a new prediction model with a maximum total score of 9 points was developed. The AUC value of the new prediction model was higher than the THRIVE score (p<0.05). The χ2 value for the Hosmer-Lemeshow test was 7.337 (p>0.05), suggesting that the prediction model had a good fit.

Delineating mechanisms of age specificity in leukemia could improve disease models and uncover new therapeutic approaches. Here, we used heterochronic transplantation of leukemia driven by MLL/KMT2A translocations to investigate the contribution of the age of the hematopoietic microenvironment to age-specific leukemia phenotypes. When driven by MLL-AF9, leukemia cells in the adult microenvironment sustained a myeloid phenotype, whereas the neonatal microenvironment supported genesis of mixed early B cell/myeloid leukemia. In MLL-ENL leukemia, the neonatal microenvironment potentiated B-lymphoid differentiation compared with the adult. Ccl5 elaborated from adult marrow stroma inhibited B-lymphoid differentiation of leukemia cells, illuminating a mechanism of age-specific lineage commitment. Our study illustrates the contribution of the developmental stage of the hematopoietic microenvironment in defining the age specificity of leukemia.",Genetic diagnosis of subfertility: the impact of meiosis and maternal effects.,https://www.ncbi.nlm.nih.gov/pubmed/30728173,Journal of medical genetics,2019 04 26,"During reproductive age, approximately one in seven couples are confronted with fertility problems. While the aetiology is diverse, including infections, metabolic diseases, hormonal imbalances and iatrogenic effects, it is becoming increasingly clear that genetic factors have a significant contribution. Due to the complex nature of infertility that often hints at a multifactorial cause, the search for potentially causal gene mutations in idiopathic infertile couples has remained difficult. Idiopathic infertility patients with a suspicion of an underlying genetic cause can be expected to have mutations in genes that do not readily affect general health but are only essential in certain processes connected to fertility. In this review, we specifically focus on genes involved in meiosis and maternal-effect processes, which are of critical importance for reproduction and initial embryonic development. We give an overview of genes that have already been linked to infertility in human, as well as good candidates which have been described in other organisms. Finally, we propose a phenotypic range in which we expect an optimal diagnostic yield of a meiotic/maternal-effect gene panel.",Penthrox: a breath of PHEC air for the military?,https://www.ncbi.nlm.nih.gov/pubmed/30728171,Journal of the Royal Army Medical Corps,2019 02 07,"Prehospital analgesia is vital to good clinical care and inhaled methoxyflurane (Penthrox) would be a valuable addition to the armed forces medical armoury.

E2 is known to be made in neurons in the brain, but its precise functions in the brain are unclear. Here, we used a forebrain-neuron-specific aromatase knock-out (FBN-ARO-KO) mouse model to deplete neuron-derived E2 in the forebrain of mice and thereby elucidate its functions. FBN-ARO-KO mice showed a 70-80% decrease in aromatase and forebrain E2 levels compared with FLOX controls. Male and female FBN-ARO-KO mice exhibited significant deficits in forebrain spine and synaptic density, as well as hippocampal-dependent spatial reference memory, recognition memory, and contextual fear memory, but had normal locomotor function and anxiety levels. Reinstating forebrain E2 levels via exogenous in vivo E2 administration was able to rescue both the molecular and behavioral defects in FBN-ARO-KO mice. Furthermore, in vitro studies using FBN-ARO-KO hippocampal slices revealed that, whereas induction of long-term potentiation (LTP) was normal, the amplitude was significantly decreased. Intriguingly, the LTP defect could be fully rescued by acute E2 treatment in vitro Mechanistic studies revealed that FBN-ARO-KO mice had compromised rapid kinase (AKT, ERK) and CREB-BDNF signaling in the hippocampus and cerebral cortex. In addition, acute E2 rescue of LTP in hippocampal FBN-ARO-KO slices could be blocked by administration of a MEK/ERK inhibitor, further suggesting a key role for rapid ERK signaling in neuronal E2 effects. In conclusion, the findings provide evidence of a critical role for neuron-derived E2 in regulating synaptic plasticity and cognitive function in the male and female brain.SIGNIFICANCE STATEMENT The steroid hormone 17β-estradiol (E2) is well known to be produced in the ovaries in females. Intriguingly, forebrain neurons also express aromatase, the E2 biosynthetic enzyme, but the precise functions of neuron-derived E2 is unclear. Using a novel forebrain-neuron-specific aromatase knock-out mouse model to deplete neuron-derived E2, the current study provides direct genetic evidence of a critical role for neuron-derived E2 in the regulation of rapid AKT-ERK and CREB-BDNF signaling in the mouse forebrain and demonstrates that neuron-derived E2 is essential for normal expression of LTP, synaptic plasticity, and cognitive function in both the male and female brain. These findings suggest that neuron-derived E2 functions as a novel neuromodulator in the forebrain to control synaptic plasticity and cognitive function.",A Conceptual Framework of Palliative Care across the Continuum of Advanced Kidney Disease.,https://www.ncbi.nlm.nih.gov/pubmed/30728167,Clinical journal of the American Society of Nephrology : CJASN,2019 04 26,"Kidney palliative care is a growing discipline within nephrology. Kidney palliative care specifically addresses the stress and burden of advanced kidney disease through the provision of expert symptom management, caregiver support, and advance care planning with the goal of optimizing quality of life for patients and families. The integration of palliative care principles is necessary to address the multidimensional impact of advanced kidney disease on patients. In particular, patients with advanced kidney disease have a high symptom burden and experience greater intensity of care at the end of life compared with other chronic serious illnesses. Currently, access to kidney palliative care is lacking, whether delivered by trained kidney care professionals or by palliative care clinicians. These barriers include a gap in training and workforce, policies limiting access to hospice and outpatient palliative care services for patients with ESKD, resistance to integrating palliative care within the nephrology community, and the misconception that palliative care is synonymous with end-of-life care. As such, addressing kidney palliative care needs on a population level will require not only access to specialized kidney palliative care initiatives, but also equipping kidney care professionals with the skills to address basic kidney palliative care needs. This article will address the role of kidney palliative care for patients with advanced kidney disease, describe models of care including primary and specialty kidney palliative care, and outline strategies to improve kidney palliative care on a provider and system level.",Outcomes of fertility-sparing surgery in ovarian juvenile granulosa cell tumor.,https://www.ncbi.nlm.nih.gov/pubmed/30728165,International journal of gynecological cancer : official journal of the International Gynecological Cancer Society,2019 05 08,"To analyze the clinical characteristics, diagnosis, and treatment of ovarian juvenile granulosa cell tumor.",Tumoral pulmonary hypertension.,https://www.ncbi.nlm.nih.gov/pubmed/30728162,European respiratory review : an official journal of the European Respiratory Society,2019 02 07,"Tumoral pulmonary hypertension (PH) comprises a variety of subtypes in patients with a current or previous malignancy. Tumoral PH principally includes the tumour-related pulmonary microvascular conditions pulmonary tumour microembolism and pulmonary tumour thrombotic microangiopathy. These inter-related conditions are frequently found in post mortem specimens but are notoriously difficult to diagnose ante mortem The outlook for patients remains extremely poor although there is some emerging evidence that pulmonary vasodilators and anti-inflammatory approaches may improve survival. Tumoral PH also includes pulmonary macroembolism and tumours that involve the proximal pulmonary vasculature, such as angiosarcoma; both may mimic pulmonary embolism and chronic thromboembolic PH. Finally, tumoral PH may develop in response to treatments of an underlying malignancy. There is increasing interest in pulmonary arterial hypertension induced by tyrosine kinase inhibitors, such as dasatanib. In addition, radiotherapy and chemotherapeutic agents such as mitomycin-C can cause pulmonary veno-occlusive disease.

At each stage, lineage differentiation potential is restricted, coupled with the loss of ability to self-renew. Recently, single-cell approaches have been used to test certain assumptions made by this model, in particular relating to megakaryocyte (Mk) and erythroid (E) development. An alternative model has emerged in which substantial heterogeneity and lineage-priming exists within the HSC compartment, including the existence of multipotent but megakaryocyte/platelet-biased HSCs. Hematopoietic differentiation follows a hierarchical continuum, passing through cellular nodes and branch points. Megakaryocytes are produced via a shared pathway with the erythroid lineage, also shared in its early stages with mast cells, eosinophils, and basophils, but separate from other myeloid and lymphoid lineages. In addition, distinct pathways for direct differentiation of Mk from HSCs may coexist and could be important in situations of increased physiological requirements or in malignancies. Further work at single-cell resolution using multiomic approaches and examining Mk-E biased subsets within their physiological context will undoubtedly improve our understanding of normal hematopoiesis and ability to manipulate this in pathology.",New insights into hematopoietic differentiation landscapes from single-cell RNA sequencing.,https://www.ncbi.nlm.nih.gov/pubmed/30728144,Blood,2019 04 28,"Single-cell transcriptomics has recently emerged as a powerful tool to analyze cellular heterogeneity, discover new cell types, and infer putative differentiation routes. The technique has been rapidly embraced by the hematopoiesis research community, and like other technologies before, single-cell molecular profiling is widely expected to make important contributions to our understanding of the hematopoietic hierarchy. Much of this new interpretation relies on inference of the transcriptomic landscape as a representation of existing cellular states and associated transitions among them. Here we review how this model allows, under certain assumptions, charting of time-resolved differentiation trajectories with unparalleled resolution and how the landscape of multipotent cells may be rather devoid of discrete structures, challenging our preconceptions about stem and progenitor cell types and their organization. Finally, we highlight how promising technological advances may convert static differentiation landscapes into a dynamic cell flux model and thus provide a more holistic understanding of normal hematopoiesis and blood disorders.",Clonal approaches to understanding the impact of mutations on hematologic disease development.,https://www.ncbi.nlm.nih.gov/pubmed/30728143,Blood,2019 03 29,"Interrogation of hematopoietic tissue at the clonal level has a rich history spanning over 50 years, and has provided critical insights into both normal and malignant hematopoiesis. Characterization of chromosomes identified some of the first genetic links to cancer with the discovery of chromosomal translocations in association with many hematological neoplasms. The unique accessibility of hematopoietic tissue and the ability to clonally expand hematopoietic progenitors in vitro has provided fundamental insights into the cellular hierarchy of normal hematopoiesis, as well as the functional impact of driver mutations in disease. Transplantation assays in murine models have enabled cellular assessment of the functional consequences of somatic mutations in vivo. Most recently, next-generation sequencing-based assays have shown great promise in allowing multi-""omic"" characterization of single cells.

Understanding these dynamic biological processes requires noninvasive continuous quantitative single-cell observations, instead of population-based average or single-cell snapshot analysis. Ideally, single-cell dynamics are measured long-term in vivo; however, despite progress in recent years, technical limitations still prevent such studies. On the other hand, in vitro studies have proven to be useful for answering long-standing questions. Although technically still demanding, long-term single-cell imaging and tracking in vitro have become valuable tools to elucidate dynamic molecular processes and mechanisms, especially in rare and heterogeneous populations. Here, we review how continuous quantitative single-cell imaging of hematopoietic cells has been used to solve decades-long controversies. Because aberrant cell fate decisions are at the heart of tissue degeneration and disease, we argue that studying their molecular dynamics using quantitative single-cell imaging will also improve our understanding of these processes and lead to new strategies for therapies.",Factors associated with durable EFS in adult B-cell ALL patients achieving MRD-negative CR after CD19 CAR T-cell therapy.,https://www.ncbi.nlm.nih.gov/pubmed/30728140,Blood,2019 05 11,"Autologous T cells engineered to express a CD19-specific chimeric antigen receptor (CAR) have produced impressive minimal residual disease-negative (MRD-negative) complete remission (CR) rates in patients with relapsed/refractory B-cell acute lymphoblastic leukemia (B-ALL). However, the factors associated with durable remissions after CAR T-cell therapy have not been fully elucidated. We studied patients with relapsed/refractory B-ALL enrolled in a phase 1/2 clinical trial evaluating lymphodepletion chemotherapy followed by CD19 CAR T-cell therapy at our institution. Forty-five (85%) of 53 patients who received CD19 CAR T-cell therapy and were evaluable for response achieved MRD-negative CR by high-resolution flow cytometry. With a median follow-up of 30.9 months, event-free survival (EFS) and overall survival (OS) were significantly better in the patients who achieved MRD-negative CR compared with those who did not (median EFS, 7.6 vs 0.8 months; P < .0001; median OS, 20.0 vs 5.0 months; P = .014). In patients who achieved MRD-negative CR by flow cytometry, absence of the index malignant clone by IGH deep sequencing was associated with better EFS (P = .034). Stepwise multivariable modeling in patients achieving MRD-negative CR showed that lower prelymphodepletion lactate dehydrogenase concentration (hazard ratio [HR], 1.38 per 100 U/L increment increase), higher prelymphodepletion platelet count (HR, 0.74 per 50 000/μL increment increase), incorporation of fludarabine into the lymphodepletion regimen (HR, 0.25), and allogeneic hematopoietic cell transplantation (HCT) after CAR T-cell therapy (HR, 0.39) were associated with better EFS. These data allow identification of patients at higher risk of relapse after CAR T-cell immunotherapy who might benefit from consolidation strategies such as allogeneic HCT.

A substantial population, however, has already terminated LTFU at HCT centers. To better characterize follow-up termination, we analyzed the Japanese transplant registry database. The study cohort included 17 980 survivors beyond 2 years who underwent their first allogeneic HCT between 1974 and 2013. The median patient age at HCT was 34 years (range, 0-76 years). Follow-up at their HCT center was terminated in 4987 patients. The cumulative incidence of follow-up termination was 28% (95% confidence interval [CI], 27%-29%) at 10 years, increasing to 67% (95% CI, 65%-69%) at 25 years after HCT. Pediatric patients showed the lowest probability of follow-up termination for up to 16 years after HCT, whereas adolescent and young adult (AYA) patients showed the highest probability of follow-up termination throughout the period. Follow-up termination was most often made by physicians based on the patient's good physical condition. Multivariate analysis identified 6 factors associated with follow-up termination: AYA patients, female patients, standard-risk malignancy or nonmalignant disease, unrelated bone marrow transplantation, HCT between 2000 and 2005, and absence of chronic graft-versus-host disease. These results suggest the need for education of both physicians and patients about the importance of LTFU, even in survivors with good physical condition. The decreased risk for follow-up termination after 2005 may suggest the increasing focus on LTFU in recent years.",Primary cervical screening with high risk human papillomavirus testing: observational study.,https://www.ncbi.nlm.nih.gov/pubmed/30728133,BMJ (Clinical research ed.),2019 04 12,"To provide the first report on the main outcomes from the prevalence and incidence rounds of a large pilot of routine primary high risk human papillomavirus (hrHPV) testing in England, compared with contemporaneous primary liquid based cytology screening.",Critical Care Nurse Work Environments 2018: Findings and Implications.,https://www.ncbi.nlm.nih.gov/pubmed/30728131,Critical care nurse,2019 04 02,The health of critical care nurse work environments affects patient and nurse outcomes.

It is a paradigmatic example of a chronic disease without an effective treatment in Latin America where the current therapies, based on Benznidazole and Nifurtimox, are characterised by limited efficacy, toxic side-effects and frequent failures in the treatment. We present a series of new long-chain squaramides, identified based on their 1H and 13C NMR spectra, and their trypanocidal activity and cytotoxicity were tested in vitro through the determination of IC50 values. Compounds 4 and 7 were more active and less toxic than the reference drug Benznidazole, and these results were the basis of promoting in vivo assays, where parasitaemia levels, assignment of cure, reactivation of parasitaemia and others parameters were determined in mice treated in both the acute and chronic phases. Finally, the mechanisms of action were elucidated at metabolic and mitochondrial levels and superoxide dismutase inhibition.

Here we investigated the synergetic effect of stress and environmental enrichment on the immune response of Long-Evans rats. Subjects (n = 46) were assigned to 5 treatment groups: acute compared with chronic stress with or without environmental enrichment, plus an unmanipulated control group. Animals also were classified as active, passive, and flexible copers according to back-test assessment. Rats were exposed to enrichment in an open-field containing objects in different areas for 30 min 3 times each week, thus modeling the effects of a temporary increase in environmental stimuli. Animals assigned to chronic stress groups were exposed to predator sound stressors for 30 min daily, whereas animals assigned to acute stress groups were exposed once each week. After 7 wk, a dermal punch biopsy was administered to activate the immune response, after which rats were challenged through a forced swim test. Biologic samples were collected to measure corticosterone, dehydroepiandrosterone (DHEA), oxytocin, testosterone, and the cytokines IL6 and IL10. Rats exposed to chronic stress had lower DHEA:corticosterone ratios, suggesting increased allostatic load. Enrichment exposure modulated these effects, lowering overall corticosterone and testosterone levels and increasing DHEA and oxytocin levels in animals exposed to the predator sound. The immune response was decreased in rats exposed to chronic stress, but the effect of environmental enrichment helped to mitigate the negative influence on cells producing IL6. Combining acute stress and exposure to an enriched environment returned a healthier profile in terms of both immune activation and stress regulation. By using a multidimensional scaling model, we found that a combination of 'good' stress and exposure to brief sessions of enriching stimuli can reliably predict health in Long-Evans rats.",Genetic Characterization of Fungi Isolated from Environmental Samples: A Molecular Surveillance Study of Public Health Importance.,https://www.ncbi.nlm.nih.gov/pubmed/30728093,Journal of AOAC International,2019 04 27,"Background: A multistate fungal meningitis outbreak began in September 2012 that affected 751 individuals who received contaminated spinal injections across 20 states in the United States, which led to 64 deaths.

Objective: In this follow-up study, a total of 198 environmental surveillance samples were collected and analyzed to detect pathogenic fungal species from other compounding company premises located in three regions of the United States. Methods: DNA sequencing was performed at the large subunit ribosomal RNA (LSU rRNA) and internal transcribed spacer (ITS) regions on the 25 positive fungal isolates. Results: Sequence analysis of the ITS1, the ITS2, and the LSU rRNA regions confirmed the presence of the following fungal species in the samples analyzed: (1) Pestalotiopsis cocculi from the region I; (2) Epicoccum nigrum and Trichaptum biforme from the region I; (3) Nigrospora sphaerica and Fusarium sp. from the region II; and (4) Curvularia sp., Fusarium sp., Penicillium sp., and Preussia sp. from the region III. Conclusions: Our results suggest that the LSU and ITS regions are good genetic markers to perform fungal typing. Highlights: DNA sequencing technology can be used in the implementation of effective environmental monitoring programs of public health importance."

In this study, we investigated the role of PD-1 as a prognostic marker for TNBC in an Asian cohort (n = 269). Samples from patients with TNBC were labeled with antibodies against PD-L1 and PD-1, and subjected to NanoString assays to measure the expression of immune-related genes. Associations between disease-free survival (DFS), overall survival (OS) and biomarker expression were investigated. Multivariate analysis showed that tumors with high PD-1+ immune infiltrates harbored significantly increased DFS, and this increase was significant even after controlling for clinicopathological parameters (HR 0.95; P = 0.030). In addition, the density of cells expressing both CD8 and PD-1, but not the density of CD8-PD-1+ immune infiltrates, was associated with improved DFS. Notably, this prognostic significance was independent of clinicopathological parameters and the densities of total CD8+ cell (HR 0.43, P = 0.011). At the transcriptional level, high expression of PDCD1 within the tumor was significantly associated with improved DFS (HR 0.38; P = 0.027). In line with these findings, high expression of IFNG (HR 0.38; P = 0.001) and IFN signaling genes (HR 0.46; p = 0.027) was also associated with favorable DFS. Inclusion of PD-1 immune infiltrates and PDCD1 gene expression added significant prognostic value for DFS (ΔLRχ2 = 6.35; P = 0.041) and OS (ΔLRχ2 = 9.53; P = 0.008), beyond that provided by classical clinicopathological variables.

The effects of exercise on these immune responses are crucially mediated by catecholamines and adrenoreceptors; and both mediations in stimulatory and anti-inflammatory responses have been attributed to them. In this context, the potential use of physical exercise as a therapeutic aid in pathologies with underlying altered inflammatory states, such as low-grade chronic inflammatory pathologies, has also been investigated. Currently, obesity and metabolic syndrome are included among them; particularly because patients have a dysregulation of the inflammatory and stress responses, which can lead to high levels of inflammatory cytokines that induce insulin resistance, contributing to the onset or exacerbation of type 2 diabetes. Macrophages play a crucial role in this obesity-induced inflammation. Although most of the anti-inflammatory effects of catecholamines are mediated by β adrenergic receptors (particularly β2), it is not known whether in altered homeostatic conditions, such as obesity and during exercise, innate/inflammatory responses of macrophages to β2 adrenergic stimulation are similar to those in cells of healthy organisms at baseline. Taking into account several recent studies, this article aims to emphasize that there could be possible different responses to β2 adrenergic stimulation in obesity, paying particular attention to its potential use as an anti-inflammatory strategy in obese individuals, both in the absence of physical exercise and in those who follow regular physical exercise programs.",New advances of ICG angiography in parathyroid identification.,https://www.ncbi.nlm.nih.gov/pubmed/30727933,"Endocrine, metabolic & immune disorders drug targets",2019 02 07,"For surgeons, locating the parathyroid in thyroidectomy and parathyroidectomy is critical since the parathyroid plays an important role in calcium balance.

Methods: This multicenter observational study was carried out on 1716 chronic hepatitis C virus- infected patients who received direct anti-viral drugs for 12 weeks. The primary end point was sustained virological response at 12 weeks after the end of treatment determined by quantitative PCR for HCV RNA. Serum AFP was quantitatively assessed at baseline then after 12week after stoppage of treatment (SVR12). Results: SVR12 rate was 97.8%. Elevated serum AFP was significantly higher in non -SVR group p value (<0.001). There was a marked significant decrease of AFP after treatment in comparison to pretreatment values. The multivariate logistic regression analysis on the resulting significant variable from the univariate analysis revealed that only AFP was significantly related to the response to direct antiviral therapy in patients with chronic hepatitis C with p <0.001, OR 1.10 (95% CI 1.07:1.12).

However, these genetic defects only explain a minority of AF patients. Genome-wide association studies identified single nucleotide polymorphisms (SNPs), close to PITX2 on 4q25 chromosome, that are highly associated to AF. Subsequent GWAS studies have identified several new loci, involving additional transcription and growth factors. Furthermore, these risk 4q25 SNPs serve as surrogate biomarkers to identify AF recurrence in distinct surgical and pharmacological interventions. Experimental studies have demonstrated an intricate signalling pathway supporting a key role of the homeobox transcription factor PITX2 as a transcriptional regulator. Furthermore, cardiovascular risk factors such hyperthyroidism, hypertension and redox homeostasis have been identified to modulate PITX2 driven gene regulatory networks.

The therapeutic performance of the native drug is partial due to the associated instability, reduced half-life and immunogenic complications. In this study, we report the modification of recombinant L-asparaginase with PEG and an integrated computational strategy to probe the PEGylation in the protein to understand the biological stability/activity imparted by PEG. PEGylation of L-asparaginase resulted in enhanced thermal and pH activities with extended serum half-life and resistance to proteases compared to the native enzyme. The molecular dynamics analysis revealed intricate interactions required in the coupling of PEG to L-asparaginase to bestow stronger binding affinity of L-asparagine moiety towards L-asparaginase. PEG-asparagine complex ensured stable conformation over both the native protein and asparagine-protein complex thus elucidating the PEG-induced stable conformation in the protein. PEG mechanistically stabilized L-asparaginase through inducing pocket modification at the receptor to adapt to the cavity. Thus, the study provides the rationale of PEGylation in imparting the stability towards L-asparaginase which would expand the potential application of L-asparaginase enzyme for the effective treatment of cancer.",Structure-activity relationship study on therapeutically relevant EGFR double mutant inhibitors.,https://www.ncbi.nlm.nih.gov/pubmed/30727906,Medicinal chemistry (Shariqah (United Arab Emirates)),2019 02 07,"EGFR is a clinically approved drug target in cancer.

The management of the infections caused by P. aeruginosa represents a huge challenge in the healthcare settings due to the increased emergence of resistant isolates, some of them resistant to all the currently available antimicrobials, which results in elevated morbimortality rates. Consequently, the development of new therapeutic strategies against multidrug-resistant P. aeruginosa is urgent and needful. P. aeruginosa is wellrecognized for its extreme genetic versatility and its ability to produce a lush variety of virulence factors. In this context, pseudolysin (or elastase B) outstands as a pivotal virulence attribute during the infectious process, playing multifunctional roles in different aspects of the pathogen-host interaction. This protein is a 33-kDa neutral zinc-dependent metallopeptidase that is the most abundant peptidase found in pseudomonal secretions, which contributes to the invasiveness of P. aeruginosa due to its ability to cleave several extracellular matrix proteins and to disrupt the basolateral intercellular junctions present in the host tissues. Moreover, pseudolysin makes P. aeruginosa able to overcome host defenses by the hydrolysis of many immunologically relevant molecules, including antibodies and complement components. The attenuation of this striking peptidase therefore emerges as an alternative and promising antivirulence strategy to combat antibiotic-refractory infections caused by P. aeruginosa. The anti-virulence approach aims to disarm the P. aeruginosa infective arsenal by inhibiting the expression/activity of bacterial virulence factors in order to reduce the invasiveness of P. aeruginosa, avoiding the emergence of resistance since the proliferation is not affected. This review summarizes the most relevant features of pseudolysin and highlights this enzyme as a promising target for the development of new anti-virulence compounds.","Glutathione, an antioxidant tripeptide: Dual roles in Carcinogenesis and Chemoprevention.",https://www.ncbi.nlm.nih.gov/pubmed/30727890,Current protein & peptide science,2019 02 07,"Glutathione (GSH or reduced glutathione) is a tripeptide of gamma-Glutamyl-cysteinyl-glycine and the predominant intracellular antioxidant in many organisms including humans. GSH and associated enzymes are controlled by a transcription factor-nuclear factor-2 related erythroid factor-2 (Nrf2). In cellular milieu, GSH protects the cells essentially against a wide variety of free radicals including reactive oxygen species, lipid hydroperoxides, xenobiotic toxicants, and heavy metals. It has two forms, the reduced form or reduced glutathione (GSH) and oxidized form (GSSG), where two GSH moieties combine by sulfhydryl bonds. Glutathione peroxidase (GPx) and glutathione-s-transferase (GST) essentially perform the detoxification reactions using GSH, converting it into GSSG. Glutathione reductase (GR) operates the salvage pathway by converting GSSG to GSH with the expense of NADPH and restores the cellular GSH pool. Hence, GSH and GSH-dependent enzymes are necessary for maintaining the normal redox balance in the body and help in cell survival under stress conditions. In addition, GST removes various carcinogenic compounds offering a chemopreventive property, whereas the GSH system plays a significant role in regulating the cellular survival by offering redox stability in a variety of cancers including prostate, lung, breast, and colon cancer. Studies have also indicated that GSH inhibitors, such as buthionine sulfoximine, improves the chemo-sensitivity in cancer cells. In addition, GSH and dependent enzymes provide survival advantage for cancer cells against chemotherapeutic drugs and radiotherapy.",Theoretical investigation of design space for multi layer drug eluting bioresorbable suture threads.,https://www.ncbi.nlm.nih.gov/pubmed/30727889,Current pharmaceutical biotechnology,2019 02 07,"The here presented work is focused on the development of a comprehensive model for the description of drug release from a double - layer bioresorbable suture thread and the therapeutic efficacy of the active compounds delivered in the surrounding tissue.

This system is of potential interest for the combined effects provided by the different active molecules, but the different release and polymer degradation dynamics, as well as their mutual influence, do not allow an intuitive a priori evualuation of device behavior, which can be rationalized through mathematical modeling. The model takes into account the main involved phenomena (polymer degradation and diffusion of the drugs within the device and the tissue, where they are metabolized) and their synergic effects on the overall system behavior. Model results are discussed in order to quantify the impact of the main design parameters on device performances, thanks to the use of phase diagrams (which show drug effect in time and space) whose insights are summarized in order to determine a design space according to the specific needs.",Regulation of Vaginal Microbiome by Nitric Oxide.,https://www.ncbi.nlm.nih.gov/pubmed/30727888,Current pharmaceutical biotechnology,2019 06 13,"In this review, the composition and regulation of vaginal microbiome that displays an apparent microbial diversity and interacts with other microbiota in the body are presented.

Due to its avascular and aneural nature, damaged cartilage cannot regenerate itself. Stem cell therapy and tissue engineering represent a promising route in OA therapy, in which cooperation of mesenchymal stem cells (MSCs) and three-dimensional (3D) scaffolds contribute to cartilage regeneration. However, this approach still presents some limits such as poor mechanical properties of the engineered cartilage. The natural dynamic environment of the tissue repair process involves a collaboration of several signals expressed in the biological system in response to injury. For this reason, tissue engineering involving exogenous ""influencers"" such as mechanostimulation and functional biomolecule delivery systems (BDS), represent a promising innovative approach to improve the regeneration process. BDS provide a controlled release of biomolecules able to interact between them and with the injured tissue. Nano-dimensional BDS is the future hope for the design of personalized scaffolds, able to overcome the delivery problems. MSC-derived extracellular vesicles (EVs) represent an attractive alternative to BDS, due to their innate targeting abilities, immunomodulatory potential and biocompatibility.

However, the bottleneck for the therapeutic application of many peptides and proteins is their short halflives in vivo, typically just a few minutes to hours. Half-life extension strategies have been extensively studied and many of them have been proven to be effective in the generation of long-acting therapeutics with improved pharmacokinetic and pharmacodynamic properties. In this review, we summarize the recent advances in half-life extension strategies, illustrate their potential applications and give some examples, highlighting the strategies that have been used in approved drugs and for drugs in clinical trials. Meanwhile, several novel strategies that are still in the process of discovery or at a preclinical stage are also introduced. In these strategies, the two most frequently used half-life extension methods are the reduction in the rate of renal clearance or the exploitation of the recycling mechanism of FcRn by binding to the albumin or IgG-Fc. Here, we discuss half-life extension strategies of recombinant therapeutic protein via genetic fusion, rather than chemical conjugation such as PEGylation. With the rapid development of genetic engineering and protein engineering, novel strategies for half-life extension have been emerged consistently. Some of these will be evaluated in clinical trials and may become viable alternatives to current strategies for making next-generation biodrugs.",Predictive Value of Methods Measuring Platelet Activation for Ischemic Events in Patients Receiving Clopidogrel: A Systematic Review and Meta-analysis.,https://www.ncbi.nlm.nih.gov/pubmed/30727868,Current pharmaceutical design,2019 04 11,"This study investigates the efficiency and predictive value of light-transmission aggregometry (LTA), vasodilator-stimulated phosphoprotein (VASP) and VerifyNow for ischemia in patients undergoing percutaneous coronary intervention (PCI).

Recent work, however, has shown that pluripotent stem cell-derived cardiomyocytes may self-align over long periods of time. To determine how the degree of biomaterial substrate anisotropy impacts differentiating cardiomyocyte structure and function, we differentiated mESCs to cardiomyocytes on non-aligned, semi-aligned, and aligned fibrous substrates and evaluated cell alignment, contractile displacement, and calcium transient synchronicity over time. Although cardiomyocyte gene expression was not affected by fiber alignment, we observed gradient- and threshold-based differences in cardiomyocyte alignment and function. Cardiomyocyte alignment increased with the degree of fiber alignment in a gradient-based manner at early time points and in a threshold-based manner at later time points. Calcium transient synchronization tightly followed cardiomyocyte alignment behavior, allowing highly anisotropic biomaterials to drive calcium transient synchronization within 8 days, while such synchronized cardiomyocyte behavior required 20 days of culture on non-aligned biomaterials. In contrast, cardiomyocyte contractile displacement had no directional preference on day 8 yet became anisotropic in the direction of fiber alignment on aligned fibers by day 20.

Gross pathology and histopathological assessments in preclinical studies play critical roles in determining the safety and efficacy of cardiac ablation systems used to treat tachyarrhythmias. The pathologist must assess ablation sites, adjacent structures and organs, and downstream organs to characterize the effects of the ablation treatment and determine whether adverse local reactions, collateral injury, or downstream thromboembolism are present. Histopathological assessment serves as an adjunct to electroanatomical data in determining efficacy in preclinical studies. Histopathology is the standard in definitively demonstrating transmurality of ablation lesions, which is necessary for complete conduction block, as well as showing the linear or circumferential distribution of a contiguous, transmural ablation lesion necessary for electroanatomical isolation of entire target structures such as pulmonary veins and the cavotricuspid isthmus, which are involved in propagating certain arrhythmias.

In the DEFUSE 3 trial (Endovascular Therapy Following Imaging Evaluation for Ischemic Stroke), we evaluated the accuracy of baseline ischemic core and hypoperfusion volumes for predicting infarct volume 24 hours after randomization to endovascular thrombectomy versus medical management. We also assessed if the union of baseline ischemic core and the volume of persistent hypoperfusion at 24 hours after randomization predicts infarct volume. Methods- Patients in DEFUSE 3 with computed tomography perfusion imaging or magnetic resonance diffusion weighted imaging/perfusion imaging acquired at baseline and at 24 hours after randomization were included. Ischemic core and Tmax >6s hypoperfusion volumes at baseline and follow-up were calculated using RAPID software and compared with the infarct volumes obtained 24 hours after randomization. Patients were stratified by reperfusion status for analyses. Results- Of 125 eligible patients, 59 patients with >90% reperfusion had a strong correlation between baseline ischemic core volume and infarct volume 24 hours postrandomization ( r=0.83; P<0.0001), and 14 patients with <10% reperfusion had a strong correlation between baseline Tmax >6s volume and infarct volume 24 hours postrandomization ( r=0.77; P<0.001). In the 52 patients with 10% to 90% reperfusion, as well as in all 125 patients, the union of the baseline ischemic core and the follow-up Tmax >6s perfusion volume was highly correlated with infarct volume 24 hours postrandomization (for N=125; r=0.83; P<0.0001), with a median absolute difference of 21.3 mL between observed and predicted infarct volumes. Conclusions- The union of the irreversibly injured ischemic core and persistently hypoperfused tissue volumes, as identified by computed tomography perfusion or magnetic resonance diffusion weighted imaging/perfusion, predicted infarct volume at 24 hours after randomization in DEFUSE 3 patients.

This study evaluates self-reported mental health outcomes following a psychoeducational memory skills program designed for veterans over 50 with subjective memory concerns in the context of PTSD. It was hypothesized that outcomes would improve following program participation and that baseline cognitive self-efficacy would moderate improvements in self-reported depression and life satisfaction. Methods: Veterans (n = 101, age ≥ 51) participated in an 8-week memory skills program and completed baseline and post-program assessment data as part of a quality improvement project. Results: Life satisfaction and cognitive self-efficacy demonstrated significant improvement following participation in the memory skills program. Cognitive self-efficacy was found to significantly modify change in depressive symptoms. Conclusions: We found improvement in mental health outcomes following participation in a psychoeducational memory skills program, with differential impact on depressive symptoms for those with low baseline cognitive self-efficacy. Clinical Implications: Participation in this intervention led to improved life satisfaction and cognitive self-efficacy. Cognitive self-efficacy, in turn, appeared to have implications for improving depressive symptomology and may be a useful target of memory skills education.",HIV fatalism and engagement in transactional sex among Ugandan fisherfolk living with HIV.,https://www.ncbi.nlm.nih.gov/pubmed/30727838,SAHARA J : journal of Social Aspects of HIV/AIDS Research Alliance,2019 04 23,"HIV fatalism, or the belief that HIV acquisition and mortality is out of one's control, is thought to contribute to HIV risk in fishing populations in East Africa. The objective of this cross-sectional study was to investigate the association between fatalism and sexual risk behaviours (unprotected sex, engagement in transactional sex), beyond the influence of other known HIV risk factors (e.g. food insecurity, mobility), and identify demographic, psychosocial, and structural correlates of HIV fatalism. Ninety-one men and women living in fishing villages on two islands in Lake Victoria, Uganda completed an interviewer-administered questionnaire after testing HIV-positive during home or community-based HIV testing between May and July 2015. Multivariate logistic regression was used to test the association between HIV fatalism and transactional sex and multivariate linear regression was used to identify demographic, psychosocial, and structural correlates of HIV fatalism. HIV fatalism was significantly associated with a greater likelihood of transactional sex (AOR = 3.07, 95% CI = 1.02-9.23, p = 0.04), and structural barriers to HIV care (e.g. distance to clinic) were significantly associated with HIV fatalism (β = 0.26, SE = 0.12, p = 0.04). Our findings highlight HIV fatalism as a contributor to transactional sex in Ugandan fishing communities, and as a product of broader social and contextual factors, suggesting the potential need for structural HIV interventions in this setting.",High-Risk Human Papillomavirus Infection and the Risk of Cardiovascular Disease in Korean Women.,https://www.ncbi.nlm.nih.gov/pubmed/30727837,Circulation research,2019 02 28,"Until now, no cohort studies have evaluated the relationship between high-risk human papillomavirus (HPV) infection and new-onset cardiovascular diseases (CVD).",Caspase-3 cleavage of Salmonella type III secreted effector protein SifA is required for localization of functional domains and bacterial dissemination.,https://www.ncbi.nlm.nih.gov/pubmed/30727836,Gut microbes,2019 06 16,"SifA is a bi-functional Type III Secretion System (T3SS) effector protein that plays an important role in Salmonella virulence. The N-terminal domain of SifA binds SifA-Kinesin-Interacting-Protein (SKIP), and via an interaction with kinesin, forms tubular membrane extensions called Sif filaments (Sifs) that emanate from the Salmonella Containing Vacuole (SCV). The C-terminal domain of SifA harbors a WxxxE motif that functions to mimic active host cell GTPases. Taken together, SifA functions in inducing endosomal tubulation in order to maintain the integrity of the SCV and promote bacterial dissemination. Since SifA performs multiple, unrelated functions, the objective of this study was to determine how each functional domain of SifA becomes processed. Our work demonstrates that a linker region containing a caspase-3 cleavage motif separates the two functional domains of SifA. To test the hypothesis that processing of SifA by caspase-3 at this particular site is required for function and proper localization of the effector protein domains, we developed two tracking methods to analyze the intracellular localization of SifA. We first adapted a fluorescent tag called phiLOV that allowed for type-III secretion system (T3SS) mediated delivery of SifA and observation of its intracellular colocalization with caspase-3. Additionally, we created a dual-tagging strategy that permitted tracking of each of the SifA functional domains following caspase-3 cleavage to different subcellular locations. The results of this study reveal that caspase-3 cleavage of SifA is required for the proper localization of functional domains and bacterial dissemination. Considering the importance of these events in Salmonella pathogenesis, we conclude that caspase-3 cleavage of effector proteins is a more broadly applicable effector processing mechanism utilized by Salmonella to invade and persist during infection."

Thousands of biomarkers related to the survival and prognosis of patients with this cancer type have been investigated through database mining; however, the prediction effect of a single gene biomarker is not satisfactorily specific or sensitive. Thus, the present study aimed to develop a novel gene signature of prognostic values for patients with LUAD. Using a data-mining method, we performed expression profiling of 1145 mRNAs in large cohorts with LUAD (n = 511) from The Cancer Genome Atlas database. Using the Gene Set Enrichment Analysis, we selected 198 genes related to GLYCOLYSIS, which is the most important enrichment gene set. Moreover, these genes were identified using Cox proportional regression modeling. We established a risk score staging system to predict the outcome of patients with LUAD and subsequently identified four genes (AGRN, AKR1A1, DDIT4, and HMMR) that were closely related to the prognosis of patients with LUAD. The identified genes allowed us to classify patients into the high-risk group (with poor outcome) and low-risk group (with better outcome). Compared with other clinical factors, the risk score has a better performance in predicting the outcome of patients with LUAD, particularly in the early stage of LUAD. In conclusion, we developed a four-gene signature related to glycolysis by utilizing the Cox regression model and a risk staging model for LUAD, which might prove valuable for the clinical management of patients with LUAD.",Thermodynamic first law efficiency of membrane proteins.,https://www.ncbi.nlm.nih.gov/pubmed/30727820,Journal of biomolecular structure & dynamics,2019 03 05,"Proteins are nature's biomolecular machines. Proteins, such as transporters, pumps and motors, have complex function/operating-machinery/mechanisms, comparable to the macro-scaled machines that we encounter in our daily life. These proteins, as it is for their macro-scaled counterparts, convert (part of) other/various forms of energy into work. In this study, we are performing the first law analysis on a set of proteins, including the dopamine transporter, glycine transporters I and II, glutamate transporter, sodium-potassium pump and Ca2+ ATPase. Each of these proteins operates on a thermodynamic/mechanic cycle to perform their function. In each of these cycles, they receive energy from a source, convert part of this energy into work and reject the remaining part of the energy to the environment. Conservation of energy principle was applied to the thermodynamic/mechanic cycle of each protein, and thermodynamic first law efficiency was evaluated for each cycle, which shows how much of the energy input per cycle was converted into useful work. Interestingly, calculations based on experimental data indicate that proteins can operate under a range of efficiencies, which vary based on the extracellular and intracellular ion and substrate concentrations. The lowest observed first law efficiency was 50%, which is a very high value if compared to the efficiency of the macro-scaled heat engines we encounter in our daily lives.

This retrospective cohort study included 82 consecutive women with PPROM (23-34 gestational weeks) who delivered within 96 hours of blood sampling. A membrane-based human antibody microarray was used to analyze the plasma proteome. The validation of 5 candidate biomarkers of interest was performed by enzyme-linked immunosorbent assay (ELISA) in the final cohort (n = 82). Serum C-reactive protein (CRP) levels were measured at sampling. Seventy-nine molecules studied exhibited intergroup differences. Validation by ELISA confirmed higher levels of plasma matrix metalloproteinase-9 (MMP-9), interleukin-6 (IL-6), S100 A8/A9, and insulin-like growth factor-binding protein 1 (IGFBP-1), but not tissue inhibitor of metalloproteinase 1 (TIMP-1), in women with HCA than in women without HCA. Using a stepwise regression analysis, a combined prediction model was developed, which included the plasma MMP-9, serum CRP levels, and gestational age (area under the curve [AUC], 0.932). The AUC for this model was significantly greater than that for any single variable included in the predictive model. Protein-antibody microarray technology can be useful in identifying plasma-based predictors for HCA. This study suggests that plasma MMP-9, IL-6, IGFBP-1, and S100 A8/A9 are important noninvasive predictors for HCA in women with PPROM and that the best predictive model, which combined these biomarkers with conventional clinical factors, can significantly improve the predictability for HCA.",Visuospatial neglect is more severe when stimulus density is large.,https://www.ncbi.nlm.nih.gov/pubmed/30727817,Journal of clinical and experimental neuropsychology,2019 03 21,"Patients with visuospatial neglect (VSN) suffer from an imbalance in visual attention between their left and right (egocentric or allocentric) hemispace. The view of VSN as an attentional imbalance between two hemispaces ignores the fact that-in our daily life-we are presented with varying levels of stimulus density, within but also across hemispaces. Therefore, we developed a novel experimental paradigm in which stroke patients (n = 207) were presented with a different number of simple objects in the left and right (egocentric) hemispaces and were asked to indicate whether there were more objects in the left or the right hemispace. We systematically varied the density of visual stimuli to investigate whether a high level of stimulus density impairs task performance of patients with VSN to a larger degree than it does for patients without VSN. Error rate increased when more objects were presented in the display, but this effect was most pronounced in patients with VSN, especially when more objects were presented in their contralesional than in their ipsilesional hemispace. Our findings reveal that deficits in early visual processing in patients with VSN become especially apparent when overall stimulus density is high. The degree of stimulus density should therefore be taken into account when considering the impact of attentional deficits on activities in daily life.",Normal values of distal radioulnar translation assessed by three-dimensional C-arm scans: a cadaveric study.,https://www.ncbi.nlm.nih.gov/pubmed/30727815,"The Journal of hand surgery, European volume",2019 05 17,"We investigated whether mobile C-arm cone beam computer tomography (CBCT) could be used to measure radioulnar translation. The study was conducted on 31 Thiel-fixed intact cadaver arms. Three-dimensional scans of each wrist were carried out in pronation and supination. Four established measurement methods were used (radioulnar line, subluxation ratio, epicentre and radioulnar ratio methods) to measure radioulnar translation. The intraclass correlation coefficient for inter-observer and intra-observer reliability were excellent in three of four methods (>0.94). The reference ranges for physiological radioulnar translation were between -30% and 91% (radioulnar line method), -32% and 87% (subluxation ratio method), -40% and 23% (epicentre method), and 2% and 73% (radioulnar ratio method). Our results indicate that radioulnar translation in the distal radioulnar joint can be determined reliably using mobile C-arm CBCT. The normal values provide a basis for further experimental and clinical studies.",Association of scapholunate dissociation and two-part articular fractures of the distal radius.,https://www.ncbi.nlm.nih.gov/pubmed/30727814,"The Journal of hand surgery, European volume",2019 05 17,"Scapholunate dissociation may occur in association with distal radial fractures and is easily missed at initial presentation. The aim of this study was to examine variances in the scapholunate distance with respect to subtypes of two-part partial articular distal radial fractures. Axial computed tomography (CT) scans of acute two-part intra-articular radial fractures were assessed retrospectively from 80 patients and compared to 20 controls. From each scan, two images were analysed to identify the scaphoid, lunate and articular fracture line in the distal radius for fracture type categorization. The images were overlaid on a standardized distal radius template and the scapholunate distance measured. Significant increase in the scapholunate distance was noted in fracture subtypes: radial styloid oblique; dorsal ulnar column; sagittal ulnar column; and volar coronal. We conclude that these findings support the need for a higher index of suspicion for scapholunate dissociation in these distal radial fracture subtypes.

We found an over-representation in the gene ontology categories ""Ribosome"" and ""Oxidative stress along with an increased abundance of late embryogenesis abundant (LEA) and early response to dehydration (ERD) proteins. Since nitric oxide (NO) plays a pivotal role in plant responses to drought stress and induces LEA and DREB proteins, here we monitored the levels of NO in Arabidopsis cell suspensions and leaf disks challenged with PEG, and performed comparative analyses of the proteomics and transcriptomics data in public domain to search for a common set of early drought and NO responsive proteins. We show that under drought-stress, NO shows a biphasic time course, much like in response to ozone stress and that among the early drought and NO responsive proteins, the categories ""DNA binding"", ""Nucleotide binding"" and ""Transcription regulator activity"" are enriched. Taken together, present study suggests that in Arabidopsis the changing NO levels may play a critical role in early drought responsive processes and notably in the transcriptional and translational reprograming observed under drought stress.",A Case of Aplastic Anemia Associated With Long-Term Metronidazole Use.,https://www.ncbi.nlm.nih.gov/pubmed/30727812,Journal of pharmacy practice,2019 02 07,"Metronidazole is a nitroimidazole antibacterial agent that is highly effective for the treatment of protozoal and anaerobic infections.

HCC is now the third leading cause of cancer deaths worldwide, with over 500,000 people affected. However, there is no complete effective (ideal) treatment for liver cancer yet, and the new methods are expected to be discovered. Herein, for the first time, we report the anti-HCC effects of copper-cysteamine nanoparticles (Cu-Cy NPs), a new type of photosensitizers. An in vitro 3-(4,5-dimethylthiazol- 2-yl)-2,5-diphenyltetrazolium bromide (MTT) assay shows that Cu-Cy NPs could significantly reduce the activity of HepG2 cells at a very low dose after a short time of ultraviolet radiation. In addition, we found that cell death was induced by Cu-Cy NPs, which is associated with cellular apoptosis. This implied that apoptosis might be the main mechanism of the Cu-Cy's anti-HCC activity. Furthermore, we found that Cu-Cy NPs obviously inhibited the tumor growth in vivo. More interestingly, we found that the soluble Cu-Cy NPs were able to enter exosomes which were secreted by tumor cells, and exosomes could be used to deliver Cu-Cy NPs to target tumor cells. All these observations suggest that Cu-Cy NPs have a good potential for cancer treatment.",90-Day readmission after radical prostatectomy-a prospective comparison between robot-assisted and open surgery.,https://www.ncbi.nlm.nih.gov/pubmed/30727795,Scandinavian journal of urology,2019 06 03,"Purpose: All types of surgery are associated with complications. The debate is ongoing whether robot-assisted radical prostatectomy can lower this risk compared to open surgery. The objective of the present study was to evaluate post-operative adverse events leading to readmissions, using clinical records to classify these adverse events systematically. Materials and methods: A prospective controlled trial of men who underwent robot-assisted laparoscopic (RALP) or retropubic radical prostatectomy (RRP) at 14 departments of Urology (LAPPRO) between 2008 and 2011. Data on all readmissions within 3 months of surgery were collected from the Patient registry, Swedish Board of Health and Welfare. For each readmission the highest Clavien-Dindo grade was listed. Results: A total of 4003 patients were included in the LAPPRO trial and, after applying exclusion criteria, 3706 patients remained for analyses. The results showed no statistically significant difference in the overall readmission rates (8.1 vs. 7.1%) or readmission due to major complications (Clavien-Dindo ≥3b, 1.7 vs. 1.9%) between RALP and RRP within 90 days after surgery. Patients subjected to lymph-node dissection (LND) had twice the risk for readmission as men not undergoing LND, irrespective RALP or RRP technique. Blood transfusion was significantly more frequent during and within 30 days of RRP surgery (16 vs. 4%). Abdominal symptoms were more common after RALP. Conclusions: There is a substantial risk for hospital readmission after prostate-cancer surgery, regardless of technique; although major complications are rare. Regardless of surgical technique, attention should be focused on specific types of complications.",Application of second-generation Shikani optical stylet in critically ill patients undergoing cerebral aneurysm embolization.,https://www.ncbi.nlm.nih.gov/pubmed/30727794,The Journal of international medical research,2019 04 21,This study was performed to compare the clinical value of the second-generation Shikani optical stylet with that of the Macintosh laryngoscope for tracheal intubation of patients undergoing cerebral aneurysm embolization.,Spherical silica nanoparticles promote malignant transformation of BEAS-2B cells by stromal cell-derived factor-1α (SDF-1α).,https://www.ncbi.nlm.nih.gov/pubmed/30727793,The Journal of international medical research,2019 03 29,This study aimed to examine the role of spherical silica nanoparticles (SiNPs) on human bronchial epithelial (BEAS-2B) cells through inflammation.,Sex differences in the prevalence and correlates of emergency department utilization among adults with prescription opioid use disorder.,https://www.ncbi.nlm.nih.gov/pubmed/30727792,Substance use & misuse,2019 04 27,The emergency department (ED) is well-suited as an opportunity to increase treatment access for prescription opioid use disorder (POUD).

The main challenge in this endeavor was the partial hydrophilicity of MTZ, which mandated careful selection of excipients, including solid and liquid lipids, surfactants, and their ratios in combination. NLCs were produced by the phase inversion temperature method and finally converted into a gel for topical application. The prepared nanoparticles were evaluated for their particle size, zeta potential, entrapment efficiency, solid-state characteristics, surface morphology, in vitro drug release, and permeation through excised skin. The gel was additionally characterized for its pH, drug content, viscosity, and spreadability. The prepared nanoparticles were spherical in shape and of size less than 300 nm. Incorporation of judiciously chosen excipients made possible a relatively high entrapment efficiency of almost 40%. The drug release was found to be biphasic, with an initial burst release followed by sustained release up to 8 hours. In comparison to the plain drug gel, which had a tissue deposition of 11.23%, the NLC gel showed a much superior and desirable deposition of 26.41%. The lipophilic nature of the carrier, its size, and property of occlusion enabled greater amounts of drug to enter and be retained in the skin, simultaneously minimizing permeation through the skin, i.e. systemic exposure. The results of the study suggest that NLCs of anti-rosacea drugs have the potential to be used in the therapy of rosacea."

To this end, the actions of two cinnamamides, (E)-3-(4-hydroxyphenyl)-N-phenylethyl acrylamide (NCT) and N-trans-coumaroyltyramine (NCPA), were determined on AD by orally administering them to mice. Oral administration of the cinnamamides ameliorated the increase in epidermal and dermal thickness as well as mast cell infiltration. Cinnamamides suppressed serum immunoglobulin (Ig) levels and expression of T-helper (Th)1/Th2 cytokines. Moreover, cinnamamides suppressed interleukin (IL)-4, which plays a crucial role in preparing naïve clusters of differentiation (CD)4+ T cells, and decreased the cervical lymph node size and weight. Interestingly, in almost all cases, NCPA exhibited higher anti-AD activity compared to NCT. These results strongly indicate that NCPA may have potential as an anti-AD agent, and further mechanistic comparative studies of NCT and NCPA are required to determine the cause of differences in biological activity.",Immunogenicity and Therapeutic Effects of Latency-Associated Genes in a Mycobacterium Tuberculosis Reactivation Mouse Model.,https://www.ncbi.nlm.nih.gov/pubmed/30727774,Human gene therapy methods,2019 04 16,"In this study, the Mycobacterium tuberculosis (MTB) latency-associated antigens Rv2660c, Rv1733c, Rv1813c, Rv2628, Rv2029c, and Rv2659c were compared regarding their immunogenicity and potential therapeutic effects in an MTB reactivation mouse model. Normal mice or MTB reactivation mice were immunized intramuscularly three times at 2-week intervals with saline, plasmid vector pVAX1, Mycobacterium vaccae vaccine (a commercial inactivated vaccine), rv1813c DNA, rv2628 DNA, rv2029c DNA, rv2659c DNA, rv1733c DNA, or rv2660c DNA. The normal mice immunized with rv2628 DNA or rv2659c DNA had low numbers of Th1 cells and a lower ratio of Th1:Th2 immune cells in whole blood (p < 0.05). Compared to the saline group, Tc1 cells in the rv2029c DNA group and Tc1:Tc2 cell ratio in the rv1813c DNA, rv2628 DNA, and rv2029c DNA groups were significantly decreased (p < 0.05). The proportion of Foxp3+CD4+ T cells in the rv2628 DNA and rv2659c DNA groups and the proportion of CD4+CD25+ T cells in the rv2029c DNA group were significantly increased (p < 0.05). The level of anti-Rv1813c-immunoglobulin G (IgG) in the rv1813c DNA group was significantly increased (p < 0.01). The levels of specific IgG, IgG1, and IgG2a in the rv2628 DNA, rv2029c DNA, and rv2659c DNA groups were significantly increased (p < 0.05). Lung colony-forming units in M. vaccae and the six DNA groups decreased to different degrees in the MTB reactivation mouse model, but only the lung colony-forming units in the rv2628 DNA group (4.38 ± 0.70 log10) significantly decreased compared to the vector group (5.90 ± 0.42 log10; p < 0.05). The MTB rv1813c DNA, rv2628 DNA, rv2029c DNA, and rv2659c DNA could elicit a strong humoral immune response and a higher proportion of CD4+CD25+or CD4+Foxp3+ T cells but could not increase the proportions of Th1 and Tc1 cells. These results suggest that latency-associated DNA vaccines, especially rv2628 DNA, had some therapeutic effect on the endogenous resurgence mouse tuberculosis model.","The reference intervals for CA125, CA15-3, CA19-9, CA72-4, AFP, CEA, NSE and CYFRA21-1.",https://www.ncbi.nlm.nih.gov/pubmed/30727773,Scandinavian journal of clinical and laboratory investigation,2019 04 29,"Tumor markers are noninvasive diagnostic tools for cancer. Their abnormal expression often occurs earlier than clinical symptoms or other detection signals. Appropriate reference intervals (RIs) of tumor markers are important for health evaluation, cancer diagnosis, therapy monitoring and prognosis assessment.

Herein, the authors report a ruthenium(IV) complex that reduces P. aeruginosa PAO1 biofilm formation by 84%, and alters biofilm morphology and the living-to-dead cell ratio at 1 mM concentration. Including the compound in the culture medium altered the pigments secreted by PAO1, and fluorescence spectra revealed a decrease in pyoverdine. Scanning electron microscopy showed that the ruthenium complex did not penetrate the bacterial cell wall, but accumulated on external cell structures. Fluorescence quenching experiments indicated strong binding of the ruthenium complex to both plasmid DNA and bovine serum albumin. Formamidopyrimidine DNA N-glycosylase (Fpg) protein digestion of plasmid DNA isolated after ruthenium(IV) complex treatment revealed the generation of oxidative stress, which was further proved by the observed upregulation of catalase and superoxide dismutase gene expression.",The relationship between death anxiety and attitudes toward the care of dying patient in nursing students.,https://www.ncbi.nlm.nih.gov/pubmed/30727771,"Psychology, health & medicine",2019 06 05,"In order to provide dying individuals with the necessary care, firstly nurses and nursing students should be aware of their own emotions regarding death.

Herein we report the synthesis of a new class of self-healing materials, formed by the copolymerization of ethylene and anisyl-substituted propylenes using a sterically demanding half-sandwich scandium catalyst. The copolymerization proceeded in a controlled fashion, affording unique multi-block copolymers composed of relatively long alternating ethylene- alt-anisylpropylene sequences and short ethylene-ethylene units. By controlling the molecular weight and varying the anisyl substituents, a series of copolymers that show a wide range of glass-transition temperatures ( Tg) and mechanical properties have been obtained. The copolymers with Tg below room temperature showed high elastic modulus, high toughness, and remarkable self-healability, being able to autonomously self-heal upon mechanical damage not only in a dry environment but also in water and aqueous acid and alkaline solutions, while those with Tg around or above room temperature exhibited excellent shape-memory property. The unique mechanical properties may be ascribed to the phase separation of the crystalline ethylene-ethylene nanodomains from the ethylene- alt-anisylpropylene matrix.",Imidazole and 1-Methylimidazole Hydrogen Bonding and Nonhydrogen Bonding Liquid Dynamics: Ultrafast IR Experiments.,https://www.ncbi.nlm.nih.gov/pubmed/30727725,The journal of physical chemistry. B,2019 03 07,"The dynamics of imidazole (IM) and 1-methylimidazole (1-MeIM) in the liquid phase at 95 °C were studied by IR polarization selective pump-probe and two-dimensional IR (2D IR) spectroscopies. The two molecules are very similar structurally except that IM can be simultaneously a hydrogen bond donor and acceptor and therefore forms extended hydrogen-bonded networks. The broader IR absorption spectrum and a shorter vibrational lifetime of the vibrational probe, selenocyanate anion (SeCN-), in IM vs 1-MeIM indicate that stronger hydrogen bonding exists between SeCN- and IM. Molecular dynamics (MD) simulations support the strong hydrogen bond formation between SeCN- and IM via the HN moiety. SeCN- makes two H-bonds with IM; it is inserted in the IM H-bonded chains rather than being a chain terminator. The strong hydrogen bonding influenced the reorientation dynamics of SeCN- in IM, leading to a more restricted short time angular sampling (wobbling-in-a-cone). The complete orientational diffusion time in IM is 1.7 times slower than in 1-MeIM, but the slow down is less than expected, considering the 3-fold larger viscosity of IM. The jump reorientation mechanism accounts for the anomalously fast orientational relaxation in IM, and the MD simulations determined the average jump angle of the probe between hydrogen bonding sites. Spectral diffusion time constants obtained from the 2D IR experiments are only modestly slower in IM than in 1-MeIM in spite of the significant increase in viscosity. The results indicate that the spectral diffusion sensed by the SeCN- has IM hydrogen bond dynamics contributions not present in 1-MeIM.",Understanding sexual pain in endometriosis.,https://www.ncbi.nlm.nih.gov/pubmed/30727724,Minerva ginecologica,2019 05 15,"Sexual dysfunctions, particularly sexual pain, are common in adult women of all ages.
