Moreover, some of its biological traits (long life span, inshore feeding, high trophic position) make this species a suitable sentinel of coastal pollution. Here, we investigated contamination by multiple legacy and emerging organic pollutants, such as brominated and chlorinated flame retardants, polychlorinated dibenzo-p-dioxins (PCDDs) and polychlorinated dibenzofurans (PCDFs), in whitemouth croakers from two estuaries (Guanabara and Sepetiba Bays) located in industrialized and urbanized areas in Rio de Janeiro State, Southeastern Brazil. Furthermore, we assessed how biological and ecological features could explain the observed contamination patterns. Regarding brominated flame retardants, concentrations of polybrominated diphenyl ethers (PBDEs) varied from 7.6 to 879.7 pg g-1 wet weight (w.w.), with high contribution of tetra-, penta-, hexa- and deca-BDEs. The sum of chlorinated flame retardants (dechlorane-related compounds, ΣDRC) ranged from <LOD to 41.1 pg g-1 w.w., mostly represented by Dechlorane 603 and Dechlorane Plus (DP). Concentrations of PCDDs and PCDFs varied from <LOD to 1.7 pg g-1 w.w., while the Toxic Equivalent (TEQ-PCDD/Fs) levels ranged from 0.1 to 0.2 pg g-1 w.w. Positive correlations between δ15N and concentrations of tri-, tetra- and penta-BDEs, as well as ΣDRC, DP and anti-DP isomers suggested that ecological factors (namely biomagnification along the food web) influence contamination of whitemouth croakers in the estuaries studied. Moreover, the sum of PBDEs (ΣPBDE), tri- and tetra-BDEs concentrations were negatively correlated with fish size, suggesting that depuration by fishes and/or habitat shift throughout the whitemouth croaker's life cycle might also influence concentrations. Overall, our study emphasized the need for further investigations to help understand the complex patterns of bioaccumulation and biomagnification that seem to exist in Southeastern Brazil.",Evaluation of tourism impact on soil metal accumulation through single and integrated indices.,https://www.ncbi.nlm.nih.gov/pubmed/31129550,The Science of the total environment,2019 06 03,"Recently, surface soils of remote or protected areas, that receive pollutants from the surroundings or in situ activities through dry and wet deposition, exceed the baseline content of heavy metals. In the last decades, the use of single and integrated indices is a powerful tool to process, analyze and convey information about metal accumulation degree for decision makers to better manage protected areas. Single indices provide information about only one metal, whereas the integrated ones give a holistic evaluation. The aim of the research was to assess the temporal trends of three single (Contamination Factor, Enrichment Factor and Geo-accumulation Index) and two integrated (Pollution Load Index, Nemerow index) indices in order to evaluate if the touristic impact caused soil metal (Cr, Cu, Ni and Pb) accumulation. In autumn 2016 and in spring 2016 and 2017, the surface soils (0-10 cm) were collected at eight sites inside the Vesuvius National Park (Southern Italy), characterized by intense tourism from spring to autumn. The metal concentrations were measured in the soils and used to calculate the indices. In addition, the Ecological Risk Factor was calculated and the phytotoxicological assays were performed. The findings showed that the surface soils of the Vesuvius National Park were polluted by Cr, Cu, Ni and Pb, according to both single and integrated indices. The touristic impact would seem to be the main cause of soil metal accumulation, as the highest values of the calculated indices were detected for samples collected at the end of the touristic season and the lowest at the beginning of the touristic season. Anyway, Cu and Pb would seem also to derive by ex situ anthropogenic sources, whereas Cr and Ni also by natural sources, such as spontaneous fires and substrate weathering. Finally, the soils showed phytotoxic effects and low ecological risks.",The human cost of global warming: Deadly landslides and their triggers (1995-2014).,https://www.ncbi.nlm.nih.gov/pubmed/31129549,The Science of the total environment,2019 06 03,"Worldwide, landslides incur catastrophic and significant economic and human losses. Previous studies have characterized the patterns in landslides' fatalities, from all kinds of triggering causes, at a continental or global scale, but they were based on data from periods of <10 years. The research herein presented hypothesizes that climate change associated with extreme rainfall and population distribution is contributing to a higher number of deadly landslides worldwide. This study maps and identified deadly landslides in 128 countries and it encompasses their role, for a 20 years' period from January/1995 to December/2014, considered representative for establishing a relationship between landslides and their meteorological triggers. A database of georeferenced landslides, their date, and casualties' information, duly validated, was implemented. A hot spot analysis for the daily record of landslide locations was performed, as well as a percentile-based approach to evaluate the trend of extreme rainfall events for each occurrence. The relationship between casualty, population distribution, and rainfall was also evaluated. For 20 years, 3876 landslides caused a total of 163,658 deaths and 11,689 injuries globally. They occurred most frequently between June and December in the Northern Hemisphere, and between December and February in the Southern Hemisphere. A significant global rise in the number of deadly landslides and hotspots across the studied period was observed. Analysis of daily rainfall confirmed that more than half of the events were in areas exposed to the risk of extreme rainfall. The relationships established between extreme rainfall, population distribution, seasonality, and landslides provide a useful basis for efforts to model the adverse impacts of extreme rainfall due to climate change and human activities and thus contribute towards a more resilient society.",Dispersion of natural nanomaterials in surface waters for better characterization of their physicochemical properties by AF4-ICP-MS-TEM.,https://www.ncbi.nlm.nih.gov/pubmed/31129548,The Science of the total environment,2019 06 03,"Characterization and understanding of natural nanomaterials (NNMs) properties is essential to differentiate engineered nanomaterials (ENMs) from NNMs. However, NNMs in environmental samples typically occur as heteroaggregates with other particles, e.g., NNMs, ENMs, and larger particles. Therefore, there is a need to isolate NNMs into their primary particles to better characterize their physicochemical properties. Here, we evaluated the efficiency of sodium hydroxide, sodium oxalate, and sodium pyrophosphate to extract NNMs from surface waters. The extracted NNMs were characterized for total metal concentration by inductively coupled plasma-mass spectrometry (ICP-MS) following full digestion; size distribution, elemental composition and ratios by flow-field flow fractionation (AF4)-ICP-MS; and morphology by transmission electron microscopy (TEM). Sodium pyrophosphate extraction resulted in the highest NNM concentration and the smallest NNM size distribution. Sodium hydroxide and sodium oxalate extraction generated heteroaggregates with a broad size distribution. The NNM extraction efficiency increased with extractant (sodium oxalate and sodium pyrophosphate) concentration. The concentration of metals in the sodium pyrophosphate-extracted NNMs compared to the total metal concentration was element-dependent and varied from as high as >80% for Cu, Zn, and Sr to as low as <5% for Al, Ti, and Nb. This study provides a simple protocol for NNM extraction from complex environmental samples and provides a better understanding of NNM physicochemical properties. The presented NNM extraction protocol forms the basis for ENM extraction from natural waters.",Distribution of trace and major elements in subarctic ecosystem soils: Sources and influence of vegetation.,https://www.ncbi.nlm.nih.gov/pubmed/31129547,The Science of the total environment,2019 06 03,"Artic and subarctic environments are particularly sensitive to climate change with a faster warming compared to other latitudes. Vegetation is changing but its role on the biogeochemical cycling is poorly understood. In this study, we evaluated the distribution of trace elements in subarctic soils from different land covers at Abisko, northern Sweden: grassland, moor, broad-leaved forest, and peat bog. Using various multivariate analysis approaches, results indicated a spatial heterogeneity with a strong influence of soil horizon classes considered: lithogenic elements (e.g., Al, Cr, Ti) were accumulated in mineral horizon classes and surface process-influenced elements (e.g., Cd, Cu, Se) in organic horizon classes. Atmospheric influences included contamination by both local mines (e.g., Cu, Fe, Ni) and regional or long-range atmospheric transport (e.g., Cd, Pb, Zn). A non-negative matrix factorization was used to estimate, for each element, the contribution of various sources identified. For the first time, a comparison between geochemical and ecological data was performed to evaluate the influence of vegetation on element distribution. Apart from soil pH that could control dynamics of As, Cu, and Se, two vegetation classes were reported to be correlated to geochemical factors: forbs and shrubs/dwarf shrubs probably due to their annual vs. perennial activities, respectively. Since these are considered as the main vegetation classes that quickly evolve with climate change, we expect to see modifications in trace element biogeochemical cycling in the future.",Construction of a combined soil quality indicator to assess the effect of glyphosate application.,https://www.ncbi.nlm.nih.gov/pubmed/31129546,The Science of the total environment,2019 06 03,"Although the use of agrochemicals allowed increasing the crops productivity, in many cases led to soil deterioration. In this study, eight composite samples from different soils of two locations (San Martín and Anta) in Salta, Argentina, were collected and analyzed. All the samples were from loamy Entisols (0-20 cm depth) under reduced tillage without and with direct spray application of glyphosate. Twenty six variables were determined (physical, chemical, and biological soil quality indicators). From them, those of higher specificity and sensitivity to changes following glyphosate application were identified by a stepwise reduction of variables aided by statistical analysis. Samples were grouped regarding location and application of glyphosate, to identify differential effects upon variables, and glyphosate sensitive variables were selected by discarding those influenced by other factors. Thence, they were used to compose a first approximation to a combined soil quality indicator (CSQI) to assess the effect of glyphosate use in agriculture upon the soil. Overall, the set of physical variables showed the same discriminating structure as the biological set. Finally, two biological, two chemical, and two physical indicators resulted as the most specific to quality variations by the application of the herbicide, being the most sensitive the microbial biomass carbon and the (Aminomethyl)phosphonic acid concentration in soil. When these two were considered into a CSQI, it was possible to discriminate samples with the application of glyphosate (lower quality) from those without application (higher quality). To the best of our knowledge, this is the first attempt to propose a CSQI that could play an important role to prevent degradation in soils subjected to glyphosate application, as it could aid in the early detection of soil quality loss. This would provide to land managers a decision tool to let the land rest from glyphosate application, to ensure sustainable practices in agriculture.",Photochemical oxidation of PPCPs using a combination of solar irradiation and free available chlorine.,https://www.ncbi.nlm.nih.gov/pubmed/31129545,The Science of the total environment,2019 06 03,"The degradation of pharmaceuticals and personal care products (PPCPs) by using solar photolysis in the presence of free available chlorine (FAC) was investigated in simulated drinking water. The combination of free available chlorine and sunlight irradiation dramatically accelerated the degradation of all the contaminants tested through the generation of hydroxyl radicals, reactive chlorine species (RCS) and ozone. Contaminants containing electron-donating moieties degraded quickly and were preferentially degraded by RCS and/or HO oxidation. Primidone, ibuprofen and atrazine, which contain electron-withdrawing moieties, were mainly degraded by HO. Trace amounts of O3 contributed greatly to carbamazepine's degradation. Degradation of PPCPs was accelerated in oxygenated solutions. Increasing chlorine concentrations barely enhanced removal of PPCPs bearing electron-withdrawing moieties. Higher pH generally decreased the degradation rate constants along with reduced levels of HO and Cl, but diclofenac, gemfibrozil, caffeine and carbamazepine had peak degradation rate constants at pH 7-8. The cytotoxicity using Chinese hamster ovary (CHO) cell did not show significant enhancement in solar/FAC treated water. Combining chlorination with sunlight may provide a simple and energy-efficient approach for improving the removal of organic contaminants during water treatment.",Impacts of experimental alteration of water table regime and vascular plant community composition on peat mercury profiles and methylmercury production.,https://www.ncbi.nlm.nih.gov/pubmed/31129544,The Science of the total environment,2019 06 03,"Climate change is expected to alter the hydrology and vascular plant communities in peatland ecosystems. These changes may have as yet unexplored impacts on peat mercury (Hg) concentrations and net methylmercury (MeHg) production. In this study, peat was collected from PEATcosm, an outdoor, controlled mesocosm experiment where peatland water table regimes and vascular plant functional groups were manipulated over several years to simulate potential climate change effects. Potential Hg(II) methylation and MeHg demethylation rate constants were assessed using enriched stable isotope incubations at the end of the study in 2015, and ambient peat total Hg (THg) and MeHg concentration depth profiles were tracked annually from 2011 to 2014. Peat THg and MeHg concentrations and the proportion of THg methylated (%MeHg) increased significantly within the zone of water table fluctuation when water tables were lowered, but potential Hg(II) methylation rate constants were similar regardless of water table treatment. When sedges dominate over ericaceous shrubs, MeHg concentrations and %MeHg became significantly elevated within the sedge rooting zone. Increased desorption of Hg(II) and MeHg from the solid phase peat into pore water occurred with a lowered water table and predominant sedge cover, likely due to greater aerobic peat decomposition. Deeper, more variable water tables and a transition to sedge-dominated communities coincided with increased MeHg accumulation within the zone of water table fluctuation. Sustained high water tables promoted the net downward migration of Hg(II) and MeHg. The simultaneous decrease in Hg(II) and MeHg concentrations in the near-surface peat and accumulation deeper in the peat profile, combined with the trends in Hg(II) and MeHg partitioning to mobile pore waters, suggest that changes to peatland hydrology and vascular plant functional groups redistribute peat Hg(II) and MeHg via vertical hydrochemical transport mechanisms.",Sensitivity of sectoral CO2 emissions to demand and supply pattern changes in China.,https://www.ncbi.nlm.nih.gov/pubmed/31129543,The Science of the total environment,2019 06 03,"To realize the emission reduction targets, it is essential to understand how technical and structural variations of an economy can lead to emission changes. This paper establishes the carbon dioxide (CO2) emissions elasticity indicators of technical and final demand coefficients from the demand perspective as well as allocation and primary input coefficients from the supply perspective, based on the input-output technique combined with sensitivity analysis. We apply these indicators to the Chinese economy for the year 2012. The results show that with every 1% decrease of self-supplied intermediate products in the Production and supply of electricity and heat and Smelting and pressing of ferrous metals (the two largest CO2 emitting sectors) could reduce CO2 emissions from the whole economy by 20.6 Mt and 11.3 Mt from the demand perspective, accounting for 0.22% and 0.12% of the national total CO2 emissions, respectively. It could also mitigate 22.2 Mt and 8.7 Mt from the supply perspective, accounting for 0.24% and 0.09% of the national total, respectively. In addition, 1% decrease of final demand coefficient of the Construction in Capital Formation could exert great indirect effects on many sectors, and lead to 37.4 Mt (0.40%) emission reduction from the whole economy. The absolute reduction due to the variation of primary input coefficients is relatively small. By analyzing these important intersectoral linkages of CO2 emissions within the economy from both demand and supply perspectives, the most important economic transactions between sectors as well as supply and demand patterns to reduce emissions are identified. These results can help guide the development of potential effective emission mitigation policies and the methods can also be applied to other countries and regions.",Lidar data assimilation method based on CRTM and WRF-Chem models and its application in PM2.5 forecasts in Beijing.,https://www.ncbi.nlm.nih.gov/pubmed/31129542,The Science of the total environment,2019 06 03,"A three-dimensional variational (3DVAR) lidar data assimilation method is developed based on the Community Radiative Transfer Model (CRTM) and Weather Research and Forecasting model coupled to Chemistry (WRF-Chem) model. A 3DVAR data assimilation (DA) system using lidar extinction coefficient observation data is established, and variables from the Model for Simulating Aerosol Interactions and Chemistry (MOSAIC) mechanism of the WRF-Chem model are employed. Hourly lidar extinction coefficient data from 12:00 to 18:00 UTC on March 13, 2018 at four stations in Beijing are assimilated into the initial field of the WRF-Chem model; subsequently, a 24 h PM2.5 concentration forecast is made. Results indicate that assimilating lidar data can effectively improve the subsequent forecast. PM2.5 forecasts without using lidar DA are remarkably underestimated, particularly during heavy haze periods; in contrast, forecasts of PM2.5 concentrations with lidar DA are closer to observations, the model low bias is evidently reduced, and the vertical distribution of the PM2.5 concentration in Beijing is distinctly improved from the surface to 1200 m. Of the five aerosol species, improvements of NO3- are the most significant. The correlation coefficient between PM2.5 concentration forecasts with lidar DA and observations at 12 stations in Beijing is increased by 0.45, and the corresponding average RMSE is decreased by 25 μg·m-3, which respectively compared to those without DA."

Thus, the aim of this study was to conduct a scoping review of the literature, thereby synthesising existing studies to explore nursing students' experiences of caring for patients with different cultural backgrounds from theirs. A systematic article search was done in PubMed, CINAHL and ERIC. A total of 996 studies were found in the searches and finally seven studies met the inclusion criteria and were included. The analysis of the seven included studies was interpreted to represent two overarching themes, namely the challenge of communication and non-mutual language and the challenge of culture and culturally influenced behaviour, representing nursing students' experiences of caring for patients with a different cultural background from theirs. A major challenge for nursing educators appears to be creating pedagogical interventions that cultivate a humble, solicitous and caring curiosity among students, such that they do not perceive only challenges in caring for culturally diverse patients.",Educational games developed for students in perioperative nursing: A systematic review and appraisal of the evidence.,https://www.ncbi.nlm.nih.gov/pubmed/31129530,Nurse education in practice,2019 06 04,"A systematic review was conducted on electronic databases of MEDLINE/PubMed, Scopus, ISI Web of Science, CINAHL, and Embase until December 2017, using relevant keywords for educational games developed for nursing students in perioperative field. To evaluate the level of strength and quality of the evidence, the Association of Operating Room Nurses (AORN) revised model for evidence appraisal was used. Of the 852 evidence, only 10 met the criteria and were reviewed and appraised. Educational games had focused on different learning domains, including skills, feelings, emotion, knowledge, performance, attitude, motivation, and interest. With respect to the evidence level, most evidence was categorized as V (expert opinion = 2, case report = 2, literature review = 1, and organizational experiences = 1), and only one was in level I (randomized controlled trial). The quality level of most evidence was high (n = 4) and low (n = 4), and the rating of most of them was moderate (n = 4) and limited (n = 4). Based on the findings, most evidence had inappropriate quality and was found to be weak. It seems that the investigated games are insufficient to promote the nursing students' learning outcomes in different domains. Accordingly, more high-quality studies are required to design and develop innovative and practical games for students in perioperative nursing by considering validity and reliability process.","Personal tutoring in nursing studies: A supportive relationship experience aimed at integrating, curricular theory and professional practice.",https://www.ncbi.nlm.nih.gov/pubmed/31129529,Nurse education in practice,2019 06 04,"The goal of personal tutoring is not only to guide future nurse practitioners in all aspects of their professional development in the academic context, but to support their development for nursing practice as well. The aim of this study is to explore how nursing students and personal tutors experience the process of personal tutoring. This was a qualitative study using educational action research methodology and convenience sampling, taking into account the criteria of maximum variation and theoretical saturation. Data were gathered through focus groups conducted separately with nursing students and personal tutors. The analysis revealed three categories that described the participants' experience of personal tutoring: tutoring as a supportive relationship that includes pastoral care; the personal tutor as a professional who links theory and practice; group meetings as an opportunity for peer support and learning.

There will be significant transition risks for health, livelihoods, and ecosystems associated with large-scale mitigation, but also opportunities. The aim of this study was to investigate the impacts, positive and negative, of climate policies on population health in China. We review the Intended Nationally Determined Contribution (INDC) that China took to the Paris meeting, link commitments in the INDC to national planning documents relevant to environment and health, and search the literature for Chinese publications on health trade-offs and synergies. Synergies are evident in the measures taken to reduce local air pollution in China: controls on coal burning have materially improved local air quality and benefited health. But there may be risks to health also, depending on how policies are implemented and what safeguards are provided. To date most assessments of the health impacts of climate policies in China have been modelling studies. We recommend work of this kind is complemented by observational research to identify unexpected impacts and vulnerabilities.

We studied the effects of adjunct treatment with pharmaceutical grade cannabidiol (CBD) oral solution (Epidiolex®; Greenwich Biosciences, Inc.) on attention control processes related to stimulus conflict resolution in patients with TRE. Twenty-two patients with TRE underwent 3 T magnetic resonance imaging (MRI) before receiving (PRE) and after achieving a stable dose of CBD (ON). Functional MRI (fMRI) data were collected while patients performed 2 runs of a flanker task (FT). Patients were instructed to indicate via button press the congruent (CON) and incongruent (INC) conditions. We performed t-tests to examine with FT attention control processes at PRE and ON visits and to compare the 2 visits using derived general linear model (GLM) data (INC - CON). We performed generalized psychophysiological interaction (gPPI) analyses to assess changes in condition-based functional connectivity on FT. Median time between fMRI visits was 10 weeks, and median CBD dose at follow-up was 25 mg/kg/d. From PRE to ON, participants experienced improvements in seizure frequency (SF) (p = 0.0009), seizure severity (Chalfont Seizure Severity Scale (CSSS); p < 0.0001), and mood (Total Mood Disturbance (TMD) score from Profile of Mood States (POMS); p = 0.0026). Repeated measures analysis of variance showed nonsignificant improvements in executive function from 34.6 (23.5)% to 41.9 (22.4)% CON accuracy and from 34.2 (25.7)% to 37.6 (24.4)% INC accuracy (p = 0.199). Change in CON accuracy was associated with change in INC accuracy (rS = 0.81, p = 0.0005). Participants exhibited CBD-induced increases in fMRI activation in the right superior frontal gyrus (SFG) and right insula/middle frontal gyrus (MFG) and decrease in activation for both regions at ON relative to PRE (corrected p = 0.05). The subset of patients who improved in FT accuracy with CBD showed a negative association between change in right insula/MFG activation and change in accuracy for the INC condition (rS = -0.893, p = 0.0068). The gPPI analysis revealed a CBD-induced decrease in condition-based functional connectivity differences for the right SFG seed region (corrected p = 0.05). Whole-brain regression analysis documented a negative association of change in right insula/MFG condition-based connectivity with change in INC accuracy (corrected p = 0.005). Our results suggest that CBD modulates attention control processing in patients with TRE by reducing right SFG and right insula/MFG activation related to stimulus conflict resolution and by dampening differences in condition-based functional connectivity of the right SFG. Our study is the first to provide insight into how CBD affects the neural substrates involved in attention processing and how modulation of the activity and functional connectivity related to attentional control processes in the right insula/MFG may be working to improve cognitive performance in TRE.",Serum C-reactive protein/albumin ratio and restless legs syndrome.,https://www.ncbi.nlm.nih.gov/pubmed/31129525,Sleep medicine,2019 06 14,"Our study aimed to assess the variation in serum C-reactive protein/albumin ratio (CAR), a biomarker of peripheral inflammation and oxidative stress, in patients with restless legs syndrome (RLS).",Sleep quality can influence the outcome of patients with multiple sclerosis.,https://www.ncbi.nlm.nih.gov/pubmed/31129524,Sleep medicine,2019 06 14,"Sleep plays a role in some oligodendrocyte processes, including myelination.

B, Biointerfaces",2019 06 14,"Drug-eluting stents (DESs) have been used for the treatment of cardiovascular diseases including stenosis. However, in-stent restenosis, thrombosis, and delayed re-endothelialization represent challenges for their clinical applications. Here, we demonstrate a novel work to overcome these limitations through surface modification technology. The cobalt-chromium (Co-Cr) surface was modified with antioxidants such as gallic acid (GA) and rutin (Ru) and the corresponding persulfates derivatives (i.e., GAS, and RuS) through a simple conjugation procedure. Various analyses tools such as ATR-FTIR, XPS, water contact angle, SEM, and AFM characterized the functionalized surface. The surface characterization confirmed that the antioxidant and the additional persulfates were successfully bonded to the Co-Cr surface. The results of in vitro endothelial cells proved that the persulfates derivatives showed the highest tendency to get rapid re-endothelialization especially RuS. In addition, it showed inhibition to smooth muscle cells (SMCs) as compared to control Co-Cr substrate. The persulfates modified substrates reduced the amount of adsorbed fibrinogen and albumin with higher stability to fetal bovine serum. Moreover, platelet study also demonstrated that Ru and RuS presented lower platelet adhesion with round shape morphology, whereas the control Co-Cr adhere and activate many platelets with pseudopodium morphology. Moreover, these modification processes did not cause any inflammatory responses. In conclusion, it is believed that the persulfates flavonoids have a great potential in the field of drug-eluting stents and blood contacting medical implants to improve blood compatibility, suppress SMCs, and get rapid re-endothelialization.",Chitosan based self-assembled nanocapsules as antibacterial agent.,https://www.ncbi.nlm.nih.gov/pubmed/31129522,"Colloids and surfaces. B, Biointerfaces",2019 06 14,"Creating an appropriate antibacterial disinfection system without forming any harmful compounds is still a major challenge and calls for new technologies for efficient disinfection and microbial control. Towards this aim, we report on the elaboration of biodegradable and biocompatible polymeric nanocapsules, also called hollow nanoparticles, for potential applications in antibiotic therapy. These nanomaterials are based on the self-assembly of charged polysaccharides, namely chitosan and alginate, onto gold nanoparticles as a sacrificial matrix (60 nm). Electrostatic interactions between the protonated amine groups of chitosan (+35 mV) and the carboxylate groups of alginate (- 20 mV) are the driving attraction force enabling the elaboration of well-ordered multilayer films onto the spherical substrate. The removal of the colloidal gold, via cyanide-assisted hydrolysis, is evidenced by time-dependent variation of the gold spectroscopic signature (30 min is required). TEM shows the obtention of nanocapsules. An inhibitory effect of these particles has been demonstrated during the growth of two representative bacteria in a liquid medium: Staphylococcus aureus (Gram-positive) (from 4.6% to 16.3% for gold nanomaterials + and from 18.6% to 34.9% for (chi+/alg-)n-chi+ nanocapsules) and Escherichia coli (Gram-negative) (from 5.4% to 20% for gold nanomaterials and from 23.7% to 40% for (chi+/alg-)n-chi+ nanocapsules). Acridine orange staining demonstrated the bactericidal effect of chitosan-based capsules. These findings demonstrate that (chitosan/alginate)n capsules can be exploited as new antibacterial material. Thus, we present a complementary approach to classical nanoparticles prepared by complexation between alginate and chitosan or other materials."

Mulberry leaf extract biomolecules act as capping and reducing agent for fabrication of AgNPs. Later, the fabricated AgNPs were characterized by using spectroscopic and microscopic instrumental techniques such as HR-TEM, UV-Vis, XRD and FT-IR. EDS, XRD and TEM have confirmed the synthesis of AgNPs. HRTEM results exhibited that the formed AgNPs are polydispersed and spherical in nature with mean particle size of 35 nm. Microscopic observation of retina in Al-intoxicated and diabetic mother rats showed abnormal changes in retinal cell layers. Yet, the retina of rats that are maternally received AgNPs plus diabetes or Al-intoxicated exhibited noticeable amelioration. However, lower ameliorations were found in rat's retina that are maternally undergone for combined exposure. Additionally, biochemical assessment revealed that the application of AgNPs caused the amelioration of the changes in Al concentration and maternal serum glucose.

B, Biology",2019 06 16,"Prolonged exposure of the skin to ultraviolet radiation (UV) leads to its damage and loss of protective properties. This condition called photoaging of the skin is caused by a number of destructive factors, such as reactive oxygen species (ROS) and proteolytic enzymes that cause damage to the extracellular matrix, e.g. collagen fibers. Many cells of the immune system, including neutrophils, are involved in the photoaging process. The presence of neutrophils in the skin exposed to UV irradiation is known; however, the mechanism of neutrophil activity at these conditions remains unclear. In our study, we focused on the ability of neutrophils to release neutrophil extracellular traps (NETs) and the role of these structures in the photoaging process. NET release occurs in response to various stimuli; however, we hereby showed that the UVA and UVB radiation that reaches the Earth's surface could activate the mechanism of netosis. UV-induced netosis was much faster than that activated by chemical or biological factors; however, it also occurred due to the production of ROS, known signal mediators in netosis. In this work, we also identified the probable netosis signaling pathway involved in the neutrophil response to UV. The participation of NET components may explain the ongoing process of skin photoaging, but it is also important to indicate netosis as a potential target for skin protection therapy. Antioxidants tested in this work, such as N-acetylcysteine, ethamsylate, as well as vitamin B1 (thiamine), can successfully inhibit UV-induced netosis, and thus be used as protective components against the negative effects of solar radiation.",Exploration of catalytic and cytotoxicity activities of CaxMgxNi1-2xFe2O4 nanoparticles.,https://www.ncbi.nlm.nih.gov/pubmed/31129509,"Journal of photochemistry and photobiology.

B, Biology",2019 06 16,"Surgical resection is one of the most common radical treatments for cancers. However, tumors may be compressed or the local intravascular pressure may be increased during surgical manipulation, causing the shedding and entry of tumor cells into the blood circulation and hence distant recurrence and metastasis of tumors. We have preliminarily established a method of riboflavin photosensitization treatment (RPT) for inactivation of circulating tumor cells. This technology promises to solve the problems of shedding and entry of solid tumor cells into blood circulation before surgical manipulation, and almost unavoidable hematogenous dissemination of tumor cells during surgical resection. In the present study, apoptosis detection and tumorigenicity experiment in immunodeficient mice were conducted to evaluate the effect of RPT for inactivation of circulating tumor cells respectively. Next, functional evaluation was carried out for the immune cells through detecting apoptosis rate and cytokine secretion of lymphocyte. Finally, thromboelastography (TEG) and free hemoglobin were detected to assess peripheral blood coagulation and red blood cell damage. The results showed that RPT (50 μmol/L riboflavin, 10.8 J/cm2 UV) could effectively make tumor cell lose the ability of proliferation in the peripheral blood. In the meantime, the damage caused to peripheral blood coagulation, immune cell function and red blood cells was generally acceptable. The results of the study showed that RPT had huge potential in addressing the problems of shedding and entry of solid tumor cells into blood circulation before surgical manipulation, and almost unavoidable hematogenous dissemination of tumor cells during surgical resection. This therapy is expected to be an auxiliary and supportive method to reduce the risk of hematogenous metastasis and recurrence of cancers, and to increase the surgical success rate of malignant solid tumors.",Monochromatic lights-induced trends in antioxidant and antidiabetic polyphenol accumulation in in vitro callus cultures of Lepidium sativum L.,https://www.ncbi.nlm.nih.gov/pubmed/31129506,"Journal of photochemistry and photobiology.

Optimum biomass accumulation (15.36 g/L DW), total phenolic and flavonoid contents (TPC; 47.43 mg/g; TFC; 9.41 mg/g) were recorded in calli placed under white light (24 h) compared to rest of the treatments. Antioxidant enzymatic activities i.e. superoxide dismutase and peroxidase were found optimum in cultures exposed to green light (SOD; 0.054 nM/min/mg FW, POD; 0.501 nM/min/mg FW). Phytochemical analysis further confirmed the potential influence of white light exposure on enhanced production of plant's metabolites.

B, Biology",2019 06 16,"Cancer is a leading cause of death worldwide, and doxorubicin (DOX) has become one of the most commonly prescribed drugs. Stem cell (SC) therapy is proving to be a promising strategy to alleviate DOX adverse effects on non-cancerous cells. However, the drug also has a toxic action on SCs, reducing the efficiency of cell therapy from a preventive view. The present study shows that the DOX toxicity in mesenchymal SCs (MSCs) can be partially overcome by low-level laser irradiation (LLLI). To achieve this, we applied the low-level red laser (wavelength: 660 nm; output power: 30 mW; laser beam: 0.028 cm2; irradiation: 1.07 mW/cm2; Ga-Al-As Photon Laser III, DMC, São Paulo, Brazil) in rat adipose tissue-derived MSCs before their exposure to different DOX concentrations. Results revealed that the DOX reduced the viability and adenosine triphosphate level of MSCs. These findings were followed by significantly increased apoptosis as well as oxidative stress in the MSCs. Interestingly, LLLI at the dose of 0.2 J alleviated the effects of DOX on cell viability and apoptosis, and inhibited oxidative stress in the MSCs. In summary, this study provides a crucial step toward the future application of LLLI as a protective approach against DOX-induced toxicity in MSCs, particularly cell death. This study also lays the groundwork for further investigation into the role of oxidative stress and inflammation as an instructive milieu for cell protection.",Effectiveness and cost-effectiveness of incentives as a tool for prevention of non-communicable diseases: A systematic review.,https://www.ncbi.nlm.nih.gov/pubmed/31129504,Social science & medicine (1982),2019 06 11,"The rising epidemic of non-communicable diseases (NCDs) poses substantial health and economic challenges to both individuals and society.

In this systematic review we aim to determine whether there is an evidence base for any of these strategies. Forty-eight published randomized controlled trials (70 contrasts) evaluating the effectiveness of incentive-based strategies for improvements in NCD risk-factors were reviewed. Our primary conclusion is that there is a lack of compelling evidence that incentives of any form represent a compelling NCD reduction strategy.

The most common ventilation metrics used deformable image registration to evaluate the exhale-to-inhale motion field Jacobian determinant (DIR-Jac) or changes in air volume content based on Hounsfield Units (DIR-HU).

(number of studies) linear regression correlation coefficients were 0.73 ± 0.25 (n = 6) and 0.86 ± 0.11 (n = 12) for DIR-Jac and DIR-HU respectively, and the SPC were 0.45 ± 0.31 (n = 6) and 0.41 ± 0.11 (n = 5) for DIR-Jac and DIR-HU respectively. We concluded that it is difficult to make a broad statement about the validity of CTVI due to the diverse methods used in the validation literature. Typically, CTVI appears to show reasonable cross-modality correlations at the lobar/whole lung level but poor correlations at the voxel level. Since CTVI is seeing new implementations in prospective trials, it is clear that refinement and standardization of the clinical validation methodologies are required. CTVI appears to be of relevance in radiotherapy planning, particularly in patients whose main pulmonary impairment is not a gas exchange problem but alternative imaging approaches may need to be considered in patients with other pulmonary diseases (i.e. restrictive or gas exchange problems).","Synthesis, biological evaluation and in silico studies of novel N-substituted phthalazine sulfonamide compounds as potent carbonic anhydrase and acetylcholinesterase inhibitors.",https://www.ncbi.nlm.nih.gov/pubmed/31129502,Bioorganic chemistry,2019 06 14,"The synthesis, characterization and biological evaluation of a series of novel N-substituted phthalazine sulfonamide (5a-l) are disclosed. Phthalazines which are nitrogen-containing heterocyclic compounds are biologically preferential scaffolds, endowed with versatile pharmacological activity, such as anti-inflammatory, cardiotonic vasorelaxant, anticonvulsant, antihypertensive, antibacterial, anti-cancer action. The compounds were investigated for the inhibition against the cytosolic hCA I, II and AChE. Most screened sulfonamides showed high potency in inhibiting hCA II, widely involved in glaucoma, epilepsy, edema, and other pathologies (Kis in the ranging from 6.32 ± 0.06 to 128.93 ± 23.11 nM). hCA I was inhibited with Kis in the range of 6.80 ± 0.10-85.91 ± 7.57 nM, whereas AChE in the range of 60.79 ± 3.51-249.55 ± 7.89 nM. ADME prediction study of the designed N-substituted phthalazine sulfonamides showed that they are not only with carbonic anhydrase and acetylcholinesterase inhibitory activities but also with appropriate pharmacokinetic, physicochemical parameters and drug-likeness properties. Also, in silico docking studies were investigated the binding modes of selected compounds, to hCA I, II, and AChE.",Antitrypanosomal activity and effect in plasma membrane permeability of (-)-bornyl p-coumarate isolated from Piper cernuum (Piperaceae).,https://www.ncbi.nlm.nih.gov/pubmed/31129501,Bioorganic chemistry,2019 06 14,"This work describes the isolation of six metabolites from leaves and branches of Piper cernuum (Piperaceae): (-)-cubebin (1), (-)-hinokinin (2), (-)-kusunokinin (3), trans-dehydroagarofuran (4), 11-hydroxi-4,5-secoeudesmane-4,5-dione (5), and (-)-bornyl p-coumarate (6). Antitrypanosomal activity and toxicity of purified compounds were performed in vitro against trypomastigote forms of Trypanosoma cruzi and NCTC cells, respectively. Compounds 2, 3 and 5 showed moderate activities with IC50 values of 33.1, 31.8 and 45.9 μM, respectively, while compounds 1 and 4 were inactive (IC50 > 100 μM). On the other hand, compound 6 displayed an IC50 value of 2.1 μM, a selectivity index (SI) of 18 and induced a considerable interference in the plasma membrane permeability (87%) in trypomastigotes of T. cruzi. Additionally, the lethal effect of compound 6 in T. cruzi could be associated to the plasma membrane permeability. Finally, experiments using scanning electron microscopy (SEM) confirmed the obtained results in which was possible to observe total alteration parasites topography after treatment with compound 6 in comparison to untreated parasites. These data indicated that the lethal action of compound 6 is directly related to structural disruption of the membrane."

Delay-stimulated bifurcation criteria of the developed FOQVNN are attained. Then, the bifurcation diagrams are perfectly exhibited to authenticate the veracity of the bifurcation results. Besides, the stability zone is more larger of the addressed FOQVNN in comparison with its counterpart if other parameters are intercalated. It further witnesses that the amplitudes of bifurcation oscillation get bigger with the augmentation of time delay. It discloses that the bifurcation phenomena engender earlier as the order incrementally magnifies. The exactness and merits of the achieved analytic results are eventually substantiated by a simulation example.",Approximate neural optimal control with reinforcement learning for a torsional pendulum device.,https://www.ncbi.nlm.nih.gov/pubmed/31129489,Neural networks : the official journal of the International Neural Network Society,2019 06 14,"A torsional pendulum device containing hyperbolic tangent input nonlinearities can be formulated as a nonaffine system. Unlike basic affine systems, the optimal feedback control of complex nonaffine plants is difficult but quite important. In this paper, the approximate optimal control design of continuous-time nonaffine nonlinear systems is investigated with the help of reinforcement learning. For addressing the learning algorithm conveniently, an effective pre-compensation technique is adopted to perform proper system transformation. Then, the integral policy iteration strategy is incorporated to relieve the demand of system dynamics. Moreover, the actor-critic structure is implemented by virtue of neural network approximators. Finally, the experimental verification for the proposed torsional pendulum plant is conducted after a learning process of 20 iterations and the stability performance with basic robustness guarantee can be observed during two case studies.",Activation of the kynurenine pathway and mitochondrial respiration to face allostatic load in a double-hit model of stress.,https://www.ncbi.nlm.nih.gov/pubmed/31129488,Psychoneuroendocrinology,2019 06 11,"Allostasis is the process by which the body's physiological systems adapt to environmental changes. Chronic stress increases the allostatic load to the body, producing wear and tear that could, over time, become pathological. In this study, young adult male Wistar Kyoto rats were exposed to an unpredictable chronic mild stress (uCMS) protocol to increase allostatic load. First, physiological systems which may be affected by extended uCMS exposure were assessed. Secondly, 5 weeks of uCMS were used to investigate early adaptations in the previously selected systems. Adverse experiences during developmentally sensitive periods like adolescence are known to severely alter the individual stress vulnerability with long-lasting effects. To elucidate how early life adversity impacts stress reactivity in adulthood, an additional group with juvenile single-housing (JSH) prior to uCMS was included in the second cohort. The aim of this work was to assess the impact of chronic stress with or without adversity during adolescence on two domains known to be impacted in numerous stress-related disorders: mitochondrial energy metabolism and the immune system. Both, uCMS and adolescence stress increased kynurenine and kynurenic acid in plasma, suggesting a protective, anti-oxidant response from the kynurenine pathway. Furthermore, uCMS resulted in a down-regulation of immediate early gene expression in the prefrontal cortex and hippocampus, while only rats with the double-hit of adolescent stress and uCMS demonstrated increased mitochondrial activity in the hippocampus. These results suggest that early life adversity may impact on allostatic load by increasing energetic requirements in the brain.",Neutron transport correction and density calculation in the neutron-gamma density logging.,https://www.ncbi.nlm.nih.gov/pubmed/31129487,"Applied radiation and isotopes : including data, instrumentation and methods for use in agriculture, industry and medicine",2019 06 16,"Formation density is one of the most important parameters in formation evaluation. The radioisotope chemical sources are widely used in conventional nuclear logging tools. Considering security and environmental risks, the pulsed neutron generators have successfully replaced the Am-Be source in neutron porosity logging tools. However, the Cs-137 is still mainly used for bulk density measurement. Recently, there is a growing interest in measuring bulk density with the pulsed neutron generators. Although the neutron-gamma density (NGD) is also calculated by gamma-ray attenuation, the neutron transport correction is needed for neutron-induced inelastic gamma rays. A new method of NGD calculation is developed based on the coupled-field theory. This new method does not require additional neutron transport correction. Additionally, a structural model of NGD logging tool is designed by Monte Carlo method, which includes two gamma-ray detectors and two epithermal neutron detectors. According to the proposed method, the corrected inelastic gamma-ray count rate response can eliminate the effect of neutron transport and meet the law of gamma-ray attenuation. The Monte Carlo simulation results indicate that the accuracy of NGD measurement is 0.02 g/cm3, which is close to the conventional gamma-gamma density logging (0.015 g/cm3). The NGD measurement is insensitive to porosity and formation fluids in the pore space.","Feeding lambs with silage mixtures of grass, sainfoin and red clover improves meat oxidative stability under high oxidative challenge.",https://www.ncbi.nlm.nih.gov/pubmed/31129486,Meat science,2019 06 13,"This study investigated the oxidative stability of meat from lambs fed silages in which timothy grass was totally or partially replaced by sainfoin and/or red clover. Five groups of 8 lambs were fed the following silages: timothy grass (T), mixture (50:50) of timothy with either sainfoin (T-SF) or red clover (T-RC), mixture of timothy, sainfoin and red clover (50:25:25; T-SF-RC), or mixture (50:50) of sainfoin and red clover (SF-RC). Feeding the silages containing red clover (T-RC, T-SF-RC and SF-RC) decreased the deposition of vitamin E in muscle relative to the highly unsaturated fatty acids (P < .001), did not affect the oxidative stability of fresh meat, but reduced oxidative deterioration in cooked meat and in meat homogenates incubated with pro-oxidant catalysts (P < .001). The results of this study demonstrated that feeding lambs with silages containing sainfoin and red clover improve the oxidative stability of meat subjected to strong pro-oxidant conditions and suggest that these effects should be further clarified.",Effect of protein thermal stability and protein secondary structure on the roasted mutton texture and colour from different cuts.,https://www.ncbi.nlm.nih.gov/pubmed/31129485,Meat science,2019 06 13,"The age and cut of mutton are important factors influencing the suitability of roasting. In this study, the sensory quality, texture profile and surface colour of roasted mutton cuts (back strap, silverside, square cut shoulder, breast and flap and oyster cut) from Merino sheep slaughtered at ages of six months and two years were investigated. Also the protein thermal stability and protein secondary structure of different samples were also evaluated. The results showed that the muscles of back strap, silverside and oyster cut were much more suitable for roasting, presented higher sensory scores and better corresponding instrumental colour, texture properties and shear force. Lower protein thermal stability of collagen, sarcoplasmic proteins and actin in raw muscle might be the cause of the higher values of sensory attributes, L⁎, texture profiles and lower a⁎ value of roasted mutton. The lower relative percentage of protein α-helix in fresh mutton might contribute to the higher protein random coil of roasted mutton, and these contribute with a great texture and colour. It concludes that differential protein thermal stability and protein secondary structure of muscles partially affect the roast quality of lamb.",Acute and long-term cannabis use among stimulant users: Results from CTN-0037 Stimulant Reduction Intervention using Dosed Exercise (STRIDE) Randomized Control Trial.,https://www.ncbi.nlm.nih.gov/pubmed/31129484,Drug and alcohol dependence,2019 06 04,"The aim of this study was to examine the impact of vigorous intensity, high dose exercise (DEI) on cannabis use among stimulant users compared to a health education intervention (HEI) using data from the Stimulant Reduction Intervention using Dosed Exercise, National Institute of Drug Abuse National Drug Treatment Clinical Trials Network Protocol Number 0037 (STRIDE).","Maternal use of illicit drugs, tobacco or alcohol and the risk of childhood cancer before 6 years of age.",https://www.ncbi.nlm.nih.gov/pubmed/31129483,Drug and alcohol dependence,2019 06 04,Previous studies provide conflicting evidence of a link between maternal substance use and risk of childhood cancer.,A comparison of the geographic patterns of HIV prevalence and hurricane events in the United States.,https://www.ncbi.nlm.nih.gov/pubmed/31129482,Public health,2019 06 11,"Previous research has documented the adverse association between hurricanes and HIV health outcomes; however, no research has been conducted to examine whether there is spatial overlap between hurricane events and the epidemiology of HIV in the United States.

However, the current pharmaceutical wastewater treatment plants (PWWTPs) were not sufficiently effective in removing antibiotics and ARGs. Here, we designed a lab-scale simulation reactor, including up-flow anaerobic sludge bed (UASB), anoxic-oxic tank (A/O), and four separate advanced oxidation processes (AOPs) i.e., UV, Ozonation, Fenton, and Fenton/UV, to simultaneously remove 18 antibiotics and 10 ARGs from a real pharmaceutical wastewater. The results showed that all antibiotics were fully eliminated through the reactor during 180 d-operation. Among all treatment units, UASB provided the greatest contribution (85.8 ± 16.1%) for the removal of 18 antibiotics. The mass balance results manifested that degradation was a predominant mechanism for the removal of tetracyclines, sulfamethoxazole, and ampicillin (62.5-80.9%), while sorption to sludge (73.9%) was predominant for enrofloxacin removal in UASB. Meanwhile, the substantial decrease of ARG absolute abundance (log reduction by 0.1-3.1 fold) through the whole reactor was observed although the existence of the partial enrichment (1.2-3.8 log units) from the influent to the A/O unit. Fenton/UV combination was the most effective AOP for the removal of ARGs. Finally, the optimum operating conditions for the removal of ARGs using Fenton was also proposed considering the relatively lower cost and high ARG elimination. Overall, this study provides feasible suggestions for the design of real PWWTPs for simultaneous removal of antibiotics and ARGs."

To study the molecular responses of Mexican lime to CTV infection, an analysis of plant metabolome in response to infection with severe (T318) or mild (T385) isolates of CTV was performed. Healthy plants and those infected with any of the two virus strains showed different metabolite profiles, at different stages of new sprout development. Proline content increased in plants infected with CTV, proportionally to the virulence of the virus strain. Abscisic acid content decreased after virus infection whereas jasmonic and salicylic acid levels increased. CTV infection had an impact on plant secondary metabolism, by stimulating the synthesis of different metabolites such as l-methylhistidine, phenylpropanoid derivatives. These metabolites are common responses of different organisms, including higher mammals, to viral diseases, and its presence in this system points to the existence of universal responses to virus infection among different kingdoms.",Transcriptome analysis reveals potential roles of a barley ASR gene that confers stress tolerance in transgenic rice.,https://www.ncbi.nlm.nih.gov/pubmed/31129469,Journal of plant physiology,2019 06 14,"Control of gene expression and induction of cellular protection mechanisms are two important processes that plants employ to protect themselves against abiotic stresses. ABA-, stress, and ripening-induced (ASR) proteins have been identified to participate in such responses. Previous studies have proposed that these proteins can act as transcription factors and as molecular chaperones protecting transgenic plants against stresses; however a gene network regulated by ASRs has not been explored. To expand our knowledge on the function of these proteins in cereals, we present the functional characterization of a barley ASR gene. Expression of HvASR5 was almost ubiquitous in different organs and responded to ABA and to different stress treatments. When expressed ectopically, HvASR5 was able to confer drought and salt stress tolerance to Arabidopsis thaliana and to improve growth performance of rice plants under stress conditions. A transcriptomic analysis with two transgenic rice lines overexpressing HvASR5 helped to identify potential downstream targets and understand ASR-regulated cellular processes. HvASR5 up-regulated the expression of a distinct set of genes associated with stress responses, metabolic processes (particularly carbohydrate metabolism), as well as reproduction and development. These data, together with the confirmed nuclear and cytoplasmic localization of HvASR5, further support the hypothesis that HvASR5 can also carry out roles as molecular protector and transcriptional regulator.",Mammalian gene circuits with biomolecule-responsive RNA devices.,https://www.ncbi.nlm.nih.gov/pubmed/31129468,Current opinion in chemical biology,2019 06 06,"Mammalian synthetic gene circuits are promising tools for both biological studies and therapeutic applications. These circuits enable autonomous cellular state-dependent regulation such as the killing of a target cell population. Biomolecule-responsive RNA devices are preferred components of mammalian synthetic gene circuits, because they enable cell-specific gene regulation with a low risk of insertional mutagenesis. In addition, because the output of one RNA device can be the input of another RNA device, synthetic biologists can construct layered gene circuits for more sophisticated regulation. In this review, we explain recent advancements of biomolecule-responsive mammalian gene circuits based on RNA devices.","Municipal solid waste management via mathematical modeling: A case study in İstanbul, Turkey.",https://www.ncbi.nlm.nih.gov/pubmed/31129467,Journal of environmental management,2019 06 09,"The prominence of managing municipal solid waste (MSW) in an efficient and effective manner is increasing from day to day. In this paper, the solid waste management (SWM) system of İstanbul is analyzed by applying the techniques from mathematical programming methodology. In this manner, the solutions of the two optimization problems which aim to minimize the total cost and the environmental effects of SWM, respectively, are presented in this study. Additionally, a sensitivity analysis is performed and a multi-objective problem that combines two problems is presented. In this regard, the application of five MSW management technologies which are currently in use in İstanbul on six waste components is analyzed; and the optimal solution regarding the best mixture of these technologies is developed on a given waste composition. Besides, this optimal solution is compared with the current practice in İstanbul; and recommendations are presented about possible future investments for the policymakers. The results of the study emphasize the importance of material recovery and incineration facilities to improve profitability and to minimize environmental side effects. In particular, material recovery facility (MRF) should be expanded to be able to treat all of metal, paper and plastic from a cost management perspective. Incineration (INC) facility should also be expanded in order to treat plastics or organic waste from a Greenhouse Gas (GHG) minimization perspective. In addition to this, landfill appears to be the most prominent treatment technique according to the current problem parameters. However, regarding the waste composition, the amount of organic waste must be decreased by more than 37% for other waste streams to be treated in different facilities other than landfill. Anaerobic digestion and composting facilities need to be more cost-effective for becoming economically feasible. The methodology represented in this study can be extended and generalized to other cities around the world once the correct problem parameters are specified.","Material flow analysis (MFA) as a strategic tool in E-waste management: Applications, trends and future directions.",https://www.ncbi.nlm.nih.gov/pubmed/31129466,Journal of environmental management,2019 06 09,"Material flow analysis (MFA) is one of the most widely accepted and utilized tools in the industrial-ecology discipline, that measures the input-output materials and examines the pathways and flux of each material flow within the whole system.

However, there is a need to understand the dynamics of MFA methodology, the data requirements (as well as the data sources used in the previous studies) and the lessons learnt from the studies, so that countries where such an E-waste-MFA study has not yet been performed can apply the international experience of such an emerging research technique. This comprehensive review article presents the recent applications, trends, characteristics, research gaps and challenges of the MFA method that may help e-waste management with an overview of the need for a such tool to be applied. A country-wise analysis is presented and MFA models complemented by various associated methods are summarized with national-level, regional-level, product-level, and element-level assessment. The highlighted future research perspectives discussed in this study will help to analyze e-waste management systems more critically, including the hidden and known flows of waste products and associated materials, economic assessment of material recovery and the role of responsible authorities.

Results from MODIS active fire count statistics indicate an increase in the number of fire occurrences (average 1477 fires per year) over India in a period of 15 years (2003-2017). The dominant fire seasons are (i) Pre-monsoon (March to May) accounting to more than 45% and (ii) Post-Monsoon having 24% of total annual fires counts. However, the crop residue burning hotspot region located in Punjab and Haryana, constitutes 26% of the total fires in India. At an average, 15456 (77.08%) fire counts were reported during the paddy season, whereas 3296 (16.44%) fire counts during wheat season respectively. The crop residue burning over the northwest IGP (Punjab) significantly affect the aerosol optical properties locally as well in the downwind regions during post-monsoon season i.e., crop residue fires increased by 4% (170 fires per year) with corresponding AOD, AAOD & AI increased by 8%, 9% & 11% respectively. The satellite observation shows large gradient of aerosol parameters from north-west to south-east along the Himalayan foot-hills which indicates the regional transport of smoke aerosols over the region. This is also supported by ground based AOD observations at four locations (Patiala, Delhi, Dehradun and Kanpur) and Black Carbon measurements at two locations (Patiala and Dehradun). The climatological averaged values of ground based AOD550 for Patiala, Delhi, Dehradun and Kanpur are 0.52 ± 0.26, 0.75 ± 0.40, 0.45 ± 0.24 and 0.57 ± 0.29 respectively whereas BC concentrations are 8.43 ± 3.14 μg m-3 & 3.36 ± 1.26 μg m-3 for Patiala & Dehradun respectively. Comparison of MODIS derived AOD agrees well with ground based AODs (overall R = 0.86 and RMSE = 0.14). In addition, CALIPSO shows the maximum amount of biomass burning smoke aerosols present within the atmospheric boundary layer and some cases it extending up to 2-3 km altitudes. The smoke aerosol transport pathways originated from crop residue burning were analyzed using Hysplit forward trajectories. The results reveal that majority of smoke aerosols are transported to eastern IGP, central India and adjacent oceanic regions during post-monsoon season.",The role of farmers' intrinsic motivation in the effectiveness of policy incentives to promote sustainable agricultural practices.,https://www.ncbi.nlm.nih.gov/pubmed/31129464,Journal of environmental management,2019 06 09,"This paper examines the effectiveness of intrinsic and extrinsic motivations on the adoption intensity of sustainable agricultural practices (SAPs) among annual crop farmers in Chile. We use the farmers' attitude towards SAPs as a proxy of intrinsic motivation, while extrinsic motivation is represented by an economic incentive to promote the use of SAPs. The policy program we studied is administered by the Chilean Ministry of Agriculture under the name System of Incentives for the Agro-Environmental Sustainability of Degraded Soils (SIRSD-S. Sustainable behaviour was defined as the adoption of (1) minimum tillage, (2) improved fallow, (3) stubble incorporation, (4) use of manure, and (5) use of compost. A count model was estimated that showed that both sources of motivation, and the interaction between them, significantly predicted the adoption of SAPs. Farmers with low levels of intrinsic motivation depended largely on the SIRSD-S to adopt SAPs, while the incentive was ineffective for intrinsically motivated farmers who adopted more SAPs regardless the presence of extrinsic motivation. Finally, the perception of risk of soil erosion and perceived behavioural control of this risk were found to play a positive role in the adoption of SAPs.",Soil microbial response to metal contamination in a vegetated and urban brownfield.,https://www.ncbi.nlm.nih.gov/pubmed/31129463,Journal of environmental management,2019 06 09,"The ubiquity of urban brownfields presents not only a challenge for environmental managers but also an opportunity to study the functional aspects of degraded ecosystems that are in close contact with human habitation. In this study, we investigate the soil microbial community response to heavy metal contamination at Liberty State Park (LSP), an urban brownfield in Jersey City, NJ, USA. Heavy metal contamination of the soils at LSP is heterogeneous, varying widely across site and among metals. We collected soils along a previously mapped gradient of metal contamination at LSP and sampled soil from a local and uncontaminated reference site (Hutcheson Memorial Forest (HMF)) for comparison. For all soils, we measured soil heavy metal concentrations, soil organic carbon content, bacterial density, and extracellular phosphatase activity as a proxy of ecosystem functioning. Additionally, we analyzed the microbial community composition using high-throughput sequencing. Data show that some sites within LSP have significantly higher phosphatase activity compared to HMF, indicating that some heavily contaminated LSP soils are highly functional. We also found that soil organic carbon and bacterial density have a significant and positive relationship with phosphatase activity. The microbial community analyses showed that the bacterial communities were sensitive to heavy metals and that the composition was significantly affected in particular by copper, zinc, and lead. The fungal communities, however, did not vary significantly with heavy metals. Our results shed important light on the composition and functioning of urban brownfield soils. A deeper understanding of these unique ecosystems is required for successful remediation, restoration and urban sustainability.",Racing thoughts revisited: A key dimension of activation in bipolar disorder.,https://www.ncbi.nlm.nih.gov/pubmed/31129462,Journal of affective disorders,2019 06 16,"Racing and crowded thoughts are frequently reported respectively in manic and mixed episodes of bipolar disorder (BD).

The discovery of estrogen receptor (ER) gave us not only a powerful predictive and prognostic marker, but also an efficient target for the treatment of hormone-dependent breast cancer with various estrogen ligands. ER consists of two subtypes i.e. ERα and ERβ, that are mostly G-protein-coupled receptors and activated by estrogen, specially 17β-estradiol. The activation is followed by translocation into the nucleus and binding with DNA to modulate activities of different genes. ERs can manage synthesis of RNA through genomic actions without directly binding to DNA. Receptors are tethered by protein-protein interactions to a transcription factor complex to communicate with DNA. Estrogens also exhibit nongenomic actions, a characteristic feature of steroid hormones, which are so rapid to be considered by the activation of RNA and translation. These are habitually related to stimulation of different protein kinase cascades. Majority of post-menopausal breast cancer is estrogen dependent, mostly potent biological estrogen (E2) for continuous growth and proliferation. Estrogen helps in regulating the differentiation and proliferation of normal breast epithelial cells. In this review we have investigated the important role of ER in development and progression of breast cancer, which is complicated by receptor's interaction with co-regulatory proteins, cross-talk with other signal transduction pathways and development of treatment strategies viz. selective estrogen receptor modulators (SERMs), selective estrogen receptor down regulators (SERDs), aromatase and sulphatase inhibitors.","Development of novel human lactate dehydrogenase A inhibitors: High-throughput screening, synthesis, and biological evaluations.",https://www.ncbi.nlm.nih.gov/pubmed/31129449,European journal of medicinal chemistry,2019 06 15,"Human lactate dehydrogenase A (LDHA) plays a critical role in the glycolytic process, making the enzyme an ideal of anti-cancer drug target. Herein, we report the discovery of novel potent LDHA inhibitors by screening an in-house library. The hit-to-lead modification enabled us to identify compound 24c, which inhibited LDHA activity with an EC50 value of 90 nM, and reduced MiaPaCa-2 cancer cell proliferation with an IC50 value of 2.1 μM. In line with the in vitro anticancer activity, 24c suppressed the tumor growth at a dose of 10 mg/kg in a MiaPaCa-2 cells xenograft model, but with little effect to the mice weight. Moreover, 24c strongly inhibited MiaPaCa-2 cell colonies formation, induced MiaPaCa-2 cell apoptosis, and arrested MiaPaCa-2 cell cycle at G2 phase. In addition, the mitochondrial bioenergetics analysis suggested that 24c could reprogram cancer cell metabolic pathways from glycolysis to oxidation phosphorylation, which verified by decreasing the extracellular acidification rates and lactate formation, and increasing oxygen consumption rate in cancer cell. All these results indicate 24c is a promising metabolic modulator for the anticancer drug development.",Potential different impact of inhibition of thrombin function and thrombin generation rate for the growth of thrombi formed at site of endothelial injury under blood flow condition.,https://www.ncbi.nlm.nih.gov/pubmed/31129447,Thrombosis research,2019 06 08,"Thrombin inhibitor and anti-Xa are now widely used in clinical practice.

A review and discussion of operational research techniques applied to nurse staffing.,https://www.ncbi.nlm.nih.gov/pubmed/31129446,International journal of nursing studies,2019 06 12,"Despite a long history of health services research that indicates that having sufficient nursing staff on hospital wards is critical for patient safety, and sustained interest in nurse staffing methods, there is a lack of agreement on how to determine safe staffing levels. For an alternative viewpoint, we look to a separate body of literature that makes use of operational research techniques for planning nurse staffing. Our goal is to provide examples of the use of operational research approaches applied to nurse staffing, and to discuss what they might add to traditional methods. The paper begins with a summary of traditional approaches to nurse staffing and their limitations. We explain some key operational research techniques and how they are relevant to different nurse staffing problems, based on examples from the operational research literature. We identify three key contributions of operational research techniques to these problems: ""problem structuring"", handling complexity and numerical experimentation. We conclude that decision-making about nurse staffing could be enhanced if operational research techniques were brought in to mainstream nurse staffing research. There are also opportunities for further research on a range of nurse staff planning aspects: skill mix, nursing work other than direct patient care, quantifying risks and benefits of staffing below or above a target level, and validating staffing methods in a range of hospitals.",Implementing a thermal care bundle for inadvertent perioperative hypothermia: A cost-effectiveness analysis.,https://www.ncbi.nlm.nih.gov/pubmed/31129445,International journal of nursing studies,2019 06 12,Active warming reduces risk of surgical complications.

We develop and experimentally test the first integrated cognitive process model that quantitatively explains all stationary features of behavioral performance in the SART. The model assumes that performance is generated by a competitive race between a stimulus-related decision process and a stimulus-unrelated rhythmic response process. We propose that the stimulus-unrelated process entrains to timing regularities in the task environment, and is unconditionally triggered as a habit or 'insurance policy' to protect against the deleterious effects of mind wandering on ongoing task performance. For two SART experiments the model provided a quantitatively precise account of a range of previously reported trends in choice, response time and self-reported mind wandering data. It also accounted for three previously unidentified features of response time distributions that place critical constraints on cognitive models of performance in situations when people might engage in task-unrelated thoughts. Furthermore, the parameters of the rhythmic race model were meaningfully associated with participants' self-reported distraction, even though the model was never informed by these data. In a validation test, we disrupted the latent rhythmic component with a manipulation of inter-trial-interval variability, and showed that the architecture of the model provided insight into its counter-intuitive effect. We conclude that performance in the presence of mind wandering can be conceived as a competitive latent decision vs. rhythmic response process. We discuss how the rhythmic race model is not restricted to the study of distraction or mind wandering; it is applicable to any domain requiring repetitive responding where evidence accumulation is assumed to be an underlying principle of behavior.","Genetic variations of TLRs and their association with HPV/EBV, co-infection along with nicotine exposure in the development of premalignant/malignant lesions of the oral cavity in Indian population.",https://www.ncbi.nlm.nih.gov/pubmed/31129425,Cancer epidemiology,2019 06 14,"Despite being most preventable malignancies associated with smoked and smokeless tobacco products, squamous cell carcinoma of oral cavity is one of the most common malignancy in India.

Pharmacological stimulation of G-protein coupled receptor (GPR) 40, a receptor of polyunsaturated fatty acids, have recently been shown to promote tight junction assembly in airway epithelial cells under non-inflammatory conditions. However, roles of GPR40 in regulating airway epithelial integrity in response to inflammatory insults are unknown. This study was aimed to investigate the effect of GPR40 stimulation on proinflammatory cytokine (TNFα and IL-1β)-induced tight junction disruption in human airway epithelial Calu-3 cells using GW9508, a GPR40 agonist. We found that stimulation of GPR40 by GW9508 attenuated the cytokine-induced airway epithelial barrier leakage as analyzed by measurements of transepithelial electrical resistance and transepithelial flux of fluorescently labeled dextran (molecular weight of 4 kDa). Furthermore, GW9508 prevented the cytokine-induced dislocalization of zonula occludens (ZO)-1, occludin and claudin-1. The barrier-protective effect of GW9508 was abolished by a GPR40 antagonist, but not a GPR120 antagonist. Immunofluorescence staining of NF-ĸB indicated that GW9508 had no effect on cytokine-induced NF-ĸB activation. Intriguingly, GW9508 inhibited cytokine-induced airway epithelial barrier disruption through suppression of extracellular signal-regulated kinase (ERK) phosphorylation in a phospholipase C (PLC) and calcium/calmodulin-dependent protein kinase kinase beta (CaMKKβ)-dependent manner. Collectively, this study uncovered the novel role of GPR40 in preventing cytokine-induced tight junction disruption in airway epithelial cells through mechanisms involving PLC-CaMKKβ-mediated suppression of ERK signaling. Pharmacological stimulation of GPR40 may be beneficial in the treatment of airway diseases.",Betulinic acid suppresses Th17 response and ameliorates psoriasis-like murine skin inflammation.,https://www.ncbi.nlm.nih.gov/pubmed/31129421,International immunopharmacology,2019 06 12,"Psoriasis is a common inflammatory skin disease. Current treatment for psoriasis relies on conventional immunosuppressive agents. However, long-term treatment with global immunosuppression may cause various side effects. Thus, it is compelling to seek alternative drugs for treating psoriasis with potentially less side effects. Betulinic acid (BA) is a naturally occurring pentacyclic triterpene, an ingredient that originally exists in natural plants and lacks systemic toxicity. BA can regulate immunity with anti-fibrotic, anti-inflammatory and antioxidant properties. However, it's unknown whether BA has a therapeutic effect on psoriasis. The objectives of this study were to investigate whether BA attenuates psoriatic skin inflammation and to identify its mechanisms of action. A murine model of imiquimod-induced psoriasis was utilized to evaluate skin lesion while flow cytometry, immunohistochemistry, quantitative RT-PCR and Western blotting analyses were performed for immunoassays. We found that BA treatment alleviated psoriatic symptoms and inflammatory skin lesion. BA lowered the PASI scores, decreased epidermal thickness and reduced T cell infiltration in the skin lesion. Moreover, BA reduced the frequency of IL-17A-expressing CD4+ and γδ T cells in psoriatic mice, but did not alter CD4+FoxP3+ Treg frequency. BA also reduced IL-17A production but increased anti-inflammatory cytokine IL-10 level in serum of the psoriatic mice. Furthermore, BA inhibited gene expression of pro-inflammatory mediators in skin lesions, including RORγt, IL-17A, IL-6 and TNFα. Importantly, it suppressed NFκB signaling in the skin lesion. Finally, BA inhibited T cell proliferation and IL-17A production by CD4+ T-Cells in vitro. Thus, BA attenuates psoriasis and inhibits Th17 development.",Growth arrest-specific protein 6 (Gas6) attenuates inflammatory injury and apoptosis in iodine-induced NOD.H-2h4 mice.,https://www.ncbi.nlm.nih.gov/pubmed/31129420,International immunopharmacology,2019 06 12,Growth arrest-specific protein 6 (Gas6) is a vitamin K-dependent protein that plays an important role in the pathogenesis of autoimmune diseases.

To determine the anti-inflammatory activity of the lirioresinol B dimethyl ether, RAW 264.7 macrophages challenged with lipopolysaccharide (LPS) were treated with various concentrations of lirioresinol B dimethyl ether (5, 15, 25, and 50 μM). The results indicated that pretreatment with lirioresinol B dimethyl ether significantly suppressed nuclear factor kappa B (NF-κB) activation, nitric oxide (NO) production, the protein expressions of inducible nitric oxide synthase (iNOS) and cyclooxygenase-2 (COX-2). Lirioresinol B dimethyl ether inhibited LPS-induced activation of production of pro-inflammatory cytokines as well as prostaglandin E2 (PGE2) release. The results obtained by electrophoretic mobility shift assay (EMSA) demonstrated a concentration dependent reduction of the LPS-stimulated activation of NF-κB and activator protein-1 (AP-1) by lirioresinol B dimethyl ether in in vitro and in vivo models. Moreover, lirioresinol B dimethyl ether also reduced the expression of toll-like receptor (TLR)-4 protein and myeloid differentiation primary response gene 88 (MyD88) as well as promoted the degradation of IκBα. Lirioresinol B dimethyl ether also significantly down-regulated the phosphorylation of Jun N-terminal kinase (JNK), p-38 and extracellular signal-regulated kinase (ERK). Furthermore, the results of acute and chronic inflammation demonstrated that lirioresinol B dimethyl ether (10 and 50 mg per kg) reduced paw edema and mechanical hyperalgesia in carrageenan- and Complete Freund's Adjuvant (CFA)-induced in vivo mouse models, respectively. Hence, the current results indicate that lirioresinol B dimethyl ether either act by inhibiting pro-inflammatory mediators through down-regulation of mitogen activated protein kinases (MAPKs) signaling pathways and reduction of NF-κB activation."

The use of pharmaceuticals in animal breeding causes them to reach the soil environment in excrement and fertilizers. Depending on their chemical properties, pharmaceuticals can be sorbed to the soil or be washed out with rainfall and eventually be entered into groundwater. This paper evaluates the mobility of tramadol (TRA) and carbamazepine (CBZ), and two transformation products, O-desmethyltramadol (O-DMTRA) and 10,11-dihydro-10-hydroxycarbamazepine (10-OH-CBZ) in soils. Both pharmaceuticals are applied in human and animal treatment, which makes them enter the environment in native and metabolized form in high doses. Experiments were carried out in accordance with the OECD 106 procedure (batch tests) and DIN 19528:2009-01 procedure (percolation column test). The adsorption coefficients (Kd) for TRA, CBZ, O-DMTRA and 10-OH-CBZ were, respectively, 1.41 ± 0.10, 1.87 ± 0.06, 0.90 ± 0.03 and 0.37 ± 0.07 for sandy soil RS04, and 18.09 ± 0.78, 2.56 ± 0.05, 10.89 ± 0.17 and 0.56 ± 0.38  L kg-1 for loamy soil RS06. The percolation column test was carried out for sandy soil RS04. The results obtained for TRA and O-DMTRA under static conditions indicated a high mobility of these compounds in soil, whereas the column leaching experiment showed that these compounds bind strongly to soil particles. A correlation between static and dynamic tests was observed in the case of CBZ and 10-OH-CBZ. These compounds will probably be characterized by a high or moderate mobility in soil.","Sources of volatile organic compounds in suburban homes in Shanghai, China, and the impact of air filtration on compound concentrations.",https://www.ncbi.nlm.nih.gov/pubmed/31129407,Chemosphere,2019 06 14,"Air pollution in China is an ongoing concern, with subsets of the population (e.g., asthmatic children) especially susceptible to the associated health effects. In addition, people spend the majority of their time indoors, where pollutant composition may differ from the better characterized ambient environment. Although volatile organic compounds (VOCs) present health risks and have high concentrations indoors, their sources have not been thoroughly quantified in typical homes in suburban China. Similarly lacking is an understanding of how well a purifier with high efficiency particulate air and activated carbon filters can remove VOCs in a real-world setting in China. In this study, we a) quantified total VOCs (TVOC) and 900 + individual VOCs in 20 homes in China, b) identified potential sources of VOCs, and c) evaluated impacts of filtration. We used non-negative matrix factorization, a variable reduction technique, to identify sources. TVOC and individual compounds had higher concentrations indoors than outdoors (mean [range] indoors, filtration with pre-filter only: 302 [56-793] μg m-3; outdoors, entire study: 92 [26-629] μg m-3), indicating prevalent sources indoors. Many compounds detected have not, to our knowledge, been measured in homes in China. Some compounds (e.g., octanal, heptanal, ⍺-cedrene) were specific to the indoor environment, a few were ubiquitous (e.g., acetaldehyde, formaldehyde), and others were detected infrequently. These compounds may originate from consumer products, solvents, vehicle emissions, a hexane source, wooden products, and cooking. Filtration may improve air quality indoors by lowering concentrations of some VOCs, and, specifically, contributions related to solvents and consumer products.",Adverse outcome pathways potentially related to hazard identification of microplastics based on toxicity mechanisms.,https://www.ncbi.nlm.nih.gov/pubmed/31129406,Chemosphere,2019 06 14,"Increasing concern over microplastics has recently brought increased attention to studies on microplastic toxicity. Here, we conduct a systematic review on toxicity of microplastics that focuses on identifying data gaps in the mechanisms of microplastic toxicity. We observe that microplastic toxicology research thus far has focused on ecotoxicity using apical endpoints and only a few studies deal with toxicity mechanisms. Based on this review, we propose putative Adverse Outcome Pathways (AOPs) applicable to microplastic management to understand microplastic toxicity. We matched toxicity mechanisms and apical endpoints to a key event (KE) and adverse outcome (AO) information from the AOP Wiki. Overall, our results suggest that the molecular initiating event (MIE) was reactive oxygen species (ROS) formation and the AO was increased mortality, decreased growth and feeding, and reproduction failure. However, there are a limited number of studies on toxicity mechanisms of microplastics and, therefore, evidence concerning the relationship between KEs is not sufficient. Clearly, more studies on toxicity mechanisms are required to fill these gaps in data. This study also suggests that the AOP framework is a suitable tool to integrate existing data from various literature sources and can identify data gaps in microplastic toxicity mechanisms.","A retrospective investigation into the occurrence and human exposure to polychlorinated naphthalenes (PCNs), dibenzo-p-dioxins and furans (PCDD/Fs) and PCBs through cod liver products (1972-2017).",https://www.ncbi.nlm.nih.gov/pubmed/31129405,Chemosphere,2019 06 14,"A retrospective analysis of a number of historical medicinal grade cod liver oil samples produced in Northern Europe revealed relatively high contamination levels of PCNs, PCDD/Fs and PCBs. The total toxic equivalence (TEQ) associated with PCDD/Fs, dl-PCBs and PCNs was in the range 95-427 pg g-1 for Baltic cod liver oils and from 70 to 148 pg g-1 for oils sourced from the North Atlantic. The corresponding range for canned cod liver products (Baltic Sea) sampled in 2017 ranged from 52 to 104 pg g-1 fat (33-34 pg g-1 ww). The contribution from PCBs to the overall TEQ toxicity was around 3-6-fold higher than from PCDD/Fs and ranged from 24 to 318 pg TEQ g-1ww. The estimated summed TEQ intakes of PCDD/Fs, dl-PCBs and dl-PCNs resulting from the consumption of the daily recommended doses was highest for the Baltic cod liver oils ranging from 16 to 293 pg kg-1 body mass (bm) day-1 for an adult, 20-183 pg kg-1 bm day-1 for a teenager and 15-131 pg kg-1 bm day-1 for a child. The contribution to daily adult TEQ intake from PCNs alone, although relatively small is estimated to contribute up to 5-fold above the recent EFSA proposed TWI of 2 pg kg-1 bm. The results indicate that although currently produced fish oils may undergo rigorous purification procedures and show low contaminant levels, cod livers sourced from the Baltic and consumed locally, continue to contribute substantially to the dietary intake of these contaminants.","PBDEs and PCBs in terrestrial ecosystems of the Victoria Land, Antarctica.",https://www.ncbi.nlm.nih.gov/pubmed/31129404,Chemosphere,2019 06 14,"The Victoria Land (East Antarctica) is characterized by the presence of lakes and ponds where rare water is found during the Summer months.

This study reports the concentration of PBDEs (23 congeners) and PCBs (21 among non-, mono-, di-, and ortho congeners) in lake sediment, soil and vegetation mat (community of algae, cyanobacteria, bryophites) collected close to six lakes in the Victoria Land (74°31'S-74°97'S, 165°07'E-162°51'E): Edmonson Point 14 and 15A, Carezza, Enigma, Tarn Flat 20, Inexpressible Island 10B. The ∑PBDEs averaged 0.09-0.28 ng/g and BDEs 28, 47 and 154 were higher in mat and soils, while BDEs 183 and 47 in sediment samples. PCBs ranged <0.003-0.807 ng/g and congeners nos. 114, 138, and 187 were the most abundant. In addition, TEQs were derived for the non-and mono-ortho PCBs detected and values were very low in each matrix (0.010 pg/g in the soil, 0.012 pg/g in sediment and mat). The long-range atmospheric transport can be confirmed as the most important POP source in Antarctica, although the scientific stations and seabird colonies may be potential local sources and contribute to contaminant release.",Associations between multiple serum metal exposures and low birth weight infants in Chinese pregnant women: A nested case-control study.,https://www.ncbi.nlm.nih.gov/pubmed/31129403,Chemosphere,2019 06 14,"To investigate the associations between prenatal exposure to single metal and multiple metals and the risk of low birth weight (LBW), we conducted a nested case-control study of 246 LBW and 406 NBW mother-infant pairs based on a prospective birth cohort study. 22 serum metals were detected by inductively coupled plasma quadruple mass spectrometry (ICP-MS). Categorical analyses showed serum Co and Ti were associated with LBW (Co: 3rd vs 4th. quartile: OR = 1.83, 95%CI: 1.14-2.92, Ptrend = 0.043; Ti: 2nd vs. 4th quartile: OR = 0.51, 95% CI: 0.32-0.81, P trend = 0.051), especially gestational age >13 weeks (Co: 3rd vs. 4th quartile: OR = 1.94, 95% CI: 1.13 - 3.32, Ptrend = 0.043; Ti: 2nd vs. 4th quartile: OR = 0.50, 95% CI: 0.30 - 0.84, P trend= 0.073). Cubic spline analyses showed serum Co and serum Ti had non-linearity associations with LBW (Co: P for overall = 0.048, P-nonlinearity = 0.014; Ti: P for overall = 0.015, P- nonlinearity = 0.008). In multi-metal compound exposure model, 15 metals selected by elastic net model were significantly associated with the increased risk of LBW and OR (95%CI) was 5.14 (2.81-9.40). Our study suggested that lower level serum Co was positively associated with LBW and lower level serum Ti was negatively associated with LBW, especially gestational age >13 weeks, and both of them had non-linearity dose-relationships with LBW. And multi-metal compound model was significantly associated with LBW compared with single metal model.","Brominated flame retardants in a computer technical service: Indoor air gas phase, submicron (PM1) and coarse (PM10) particles, associated inhalation exposure, and settled dust.",https://www.ncbi.nlm.nih.gov/pubmed/31129402,Chemosphere,2019 06 14,"Brominated flame retardants (BFRs) are found in multi-media indoors, therefore, may pose serious risks to human health. This study investigated the occurrence of BFRs in particulate matter (PM1 and PM10) and gas phase by active and passive sampling, and settled dust to estimate potential exposure in a computer technical service. Polybrominated diphenyl ethers (PBDEs) and their alternatives (novel BFRs, NBFRs) were studied. PM and gas phase were collected on glass fiber filters and polyurethane foam plugs, respectively, and analyzed with a GC/MS after extraction, clean-up, and concentration. Inhalation exposure of the staff was estimated based on the measured concentrations using Monte Carlo simulation. BDE-209 was the dominating PBDE congener in all media while bis(2-ethylhexyl)-3,4,5,6-tetrabromophthalate and 1,2-bis(2,4,6-tribromophenoxy)ethane were those of NBFRs. Submicron particulate matter (PM1) BFR levels constituted about one half of the PM10-associated concentrations, while average PM10 mass concentration (69.9 μg m-3) was nine times that of PM1 (7.73 μg m-3). Calculated log10 dust-gas and PM-gas partitioning coefficients ranged from -5.03 to -2.10, -2.21 to -0.55, and -2.26 to -1.04 for settled dust, PM10, and PM1, respectively. The indoor/outdoor concentration ratios were >1 for all compounds indicating the strength of indoor sources in the service. The estimated potential inhalation exposures, for future chronic-toxic and carcinogenic risk assessments, indicated that the levels of gas-phase and PM1-associated exposures were similar at approximately one half of PM10-associated levels. Results of this study indicate that the occurrence of BFRs in all studied media should be taken into consideration for occupational health mitigation efforts.","Bioaccumulation, biotransformation and toxic effect of fipronil in Escherichia coli.",https://www.ncbi.nlm.nih.gov/pubmed/31129401,Chemosphere,2019 06 14,"Fipronil is a highly effective, broad-spectrum insecticide used to control pests, globally. The increased usage has led to contamination of soil, water, fruits, and vegetables. The wide and frequent usage of fipronil across the globe calls for attention regarding risk assessment of undesirable effects on non-target microorganisms. In this context, the present study was carried to understand the impact of fipronil on non-pathogenic Escherichia coli. The non-pathogenic E. coli are important commensal of the intestinal tract of humans and animals and are also indicator organisms in the environment. Our study indicates that exposure of E. coli to fipronil (100 μM concentration) leads to significant reactive oxygen species production, loss of membrane potential and viability. Further, we have witnessed the bioaccumulation and biotransformation of fipronil by E. coli at non-lethal concentrations. The bio-transformed products (fipronil sulfone and fipronil sulfide) are also the major metabolites (along with amide) reported in the feces of the mammals when exposed to fipronil. Thus, there is a possibility that the gut E. coli might play a role in the degradation and thereby removal of fipronil. In addition, the bioaccumulation of fipronil in bacteria is of concern and need to be further explored because it can lead to biomagnification in the higher trophic level and can disturb the ecological balance. In our knowledge, this is the first report on the determination of fipronil and its metabolites in bacteria through GC-MS/MS.",Tools for non-invasive sampling of metal accumulation and its effects in Mediterranean pond turtle populations inhabiting mining areas.,https://www.ncbi.nlm.nih.gov/pubmed/31129400,Chemosphere,2019 06 14,"Among reptiles, freshwater turtle species have high potential for metal accumulation because of their long lifespan or their aquatic and terrestrial habits. In order to monitor metal bioaccumulation, determine potential toxic effects, and investigate tools for non-invasive metal sampling in reptiles, we studied lead (Pb) and mercury (Hg) accumulation in Mediterranean pond turtles (Mauremys leprosa) inhabiting two former mining areas, one of them with high environmental concentrations of Pb (Sierra Madrona-Alcudia Valley district) and the other one with high environmental concentrations of Hg (Almadén district). Individuals from the Pb mining area showed mean blood concentrations (i.e. 5.59 μg Pb/g dry weight, d.w.) that were higher than those measured in other populations. Blood Hg concentrations were highest (8.83 μg Hg/g d.w.) in the site close to the former Hg mines, whereas blood Hg concentrations in terrapins from another site of Almadén district, located ∼28 km downstream, were not different from locations at the non-mining area. Animals from the Pb-contaminated site showed evidence of oxidative stress, whereas those from the Hg-contaminated site showed increased activity of the antioxidant enzyme glutathione peroxidase, as well as reduced circulating levels of the main endogenous antioxidant peptide, glutathione. Concentrations measured in feces and carapace scutes were useful indicators to monitor blood concentrations of Pb, but not of Hg. Our results provide evidence of the usefulness of freshwater turtles as sentinels of chronic metal pollution, and validate non-invasive tools to advance Pb monitoring in reptiles.",Biodegradation of hydrolyzed polyacrylamide by a Bacillus megaterium strain SZK-5: Functional enzymes and antioxidant defense mechanism.,https://www.ncbi.nlm.nih.gov/pubmed/31129399,Chemosphere,2019 06 14,"Hydrolyzed polyacrylamide (HPAM) is the most widely used water-soluble linear polymer with high molecular weight in polymer flooding. Microbiological degradation is an environment-friendly and effective method of treating HPAM-containing oilfield produced water. In this study, a strain SZK-5 that could degrade HPAM was isolated from soil contaminated by oilfield produced water. Based on morphological, biochemical characteristics and 16S rDNA sequence homology analysis, the strain was identified as Bacillus megaterium. The biodegradation capability of strain SZK-5 was determined by incubation in a mineral salt medium (MSM) containing HPAM under different environmental conditions, showing 55.93% of the HPAM removed after 7 d of incubation under the optimum conditions ((NH4)2SO4 = 1667.9 mg L-1, temperature = 24.05 °C and pH = 8.19). Cytochrome P450 (CYP) and urease (URE) played significant roles in biological carbon and nitrogen removal, respectively. The strain SZK-5 could resist the damages caused by oxidative stress given by crude oil and HPAM. To our knowledge, this is the first report about the biodegradation of HPAM by B. megaterium. These results suggest that strain SZK-5 might be a new auxiliary microbiological resource for the biodegradation of HPAM residue in wastewater and soil."

They typically modulate the fast inhibitory neurotransmission, and represent the target receptors for major classes of drugs used in the clinic, such as benzodiazepines and general anesthetics. Recent technological progress in structural biology, in particular single-particle cryo-electron microscopy, has led to fundamental advances in understanding the detailed organization and signalling mechanisms of major GABAA receptor subtypes. This effort culminated with the high-resolution structural analysis of an intact, full-length human heteropentameric receptor, α1β3γ2, in a lipid bilayer and in complex with small molecule ligands including the commonly used benzodiazepines diazepam (Valium) and alprazolam (Xanax).

A key hindrance to the reuse of water is the cost of compliance testing and process validation associated with ensuring that pathogen and chemicals in the feedwater are removed to a level that ensures no acute or chronic health and/or environmental effects. The critical control point (CCP) approach is well established and widely adopted by water utilities to provide an operational and risk management framework for the removal of pathogens in the treatment system. The application of a CCP approach to barriers in a treatment system for the removal of chemicals is presented. The application exemplar is to a small community wastewater treatment system that aims to produce potable quality water from a secondary treated wastewater effluent, however, the concepts presented are generic. The example used seven treatment barriers, five of which were designed and operated as CCP barriers for pathogens. The work demonstrates a method and risk management framework by which three of the seven barriers could also include a CCP approach for the removal of chemicals. Analogous to a CCP approach for pathogens, the potential is to reduce the use of chemical analysis as a routine determinant of performance criteria. The operational deployment of a CCP approach for chemicals was augmented with the development of a decision tree encompassing the classification of chemicals and the total removal credits across the treatment train in terms of the mechanistic removal of chemicals for each barrier. Validation of the approach is shown for an activated sludge, ozone and reverse osmosis barrier.",Ozone-encapsulated colloidal gas aphrons for in situ and targeting remediation of phenanthrene-contaminated sediment-aquifer.,https://www.ncbi.nlm.nih.gov/pubmed/31129379,Water research,2019 06 11,"The hydrophobic polycyclic aromatic hydrocarbons (PAHs) are apt to adhere tightly to the sediments in aquifer and thus pose great threats to the aquatic environment of groundwater and surface water as well as human health. The present study constructed functionalized microbubbles, named colloidal ozone aphrons (COAs), by dissolving ozone-contained air into the nonionic surfactant (Tween-20) solution at the pressure of 300 kPa for the in situ remediation of phenanthrene (PHE)-contaminated sediments. The COA system aimed at improving the PHE elimination in terms of (i) enhancing the migration and transportation ability of the bubble system in the contaminated aquifer matrix, (ii) accurately desorbing the target hydrophobic contaminants from sediments, and (iii) reinforcing the in situ oxidation degradation immediately after or simultaneously when the PAHs are desorbed into the aqueous phase. Experimental results demonstrated that the COAs exhibited similar characteristics as the classical colloidal gas aphrons (CGAs), including the high stability (half-life time > 200 s), typical morphology and average bubble size (114-162 μm); higher air hold-up of COAs was achieved (i. e. > 20%) compared with the air-microbubbles (1-2%) obtained under the same generation conditions. Although the encapsulated ozone could oxidize the surfactant-layers, the properties and behaviors of COAs were not greatly affected. The surfactant multi-layers endowed the COAs with strong hydrophobic attraction with PHE, great migration capacity and enlarged oxidation area in the sediment matrix. Approximately 96.9% of PHE was removed from the sediments and 84.9% of the overall PHE was oxidized at the high ozone concentration of 0.6 mg/L when the initial PHE concentration was 240.0 μg/kg. The COA-involved remediation technology provided the insight of combining the processes of washing and oxidizing through adopting the particularly conceived microbubbles. The in situ and selective removal of hydrophobic organic contaminants from sediments in aquifer was well achieved in this study.",Microbial production and consumption of dissolved organic matter in glacial ecosystems on the Tibetan Plateau.,https://www.ncbi.nlm.nih.gov/pubmed/31129378,Water research,2019 06 11,"Dissolved organic matter (DOM) from alpine glaciers is highly biolabile and plays a vital role in the biogeochemical cycle of meltwater-impacted environments. To unravel the composition and interactions of DOM with the bacterial community in glacier and glacier meltwater, we conducted sampling of two different Tibetan Plateau glaciers and carried out laboratory bio-incubation experiments. The field data revealed that four protein-like components accounted for 86.0 ± 11.9% of the total variability of all six fluorescence components, which suggests a predominantly microbial source of glacial chromophoric DOM (CDOM). The ice and meltwater samples displayed major contributions of molecular formulae associated with lipids and proteins (i.e. high H/C) as revealed by ultrahigh resolution mass spectrometry. Multiple linear regression models revealed that the abundant phyla explain 64.2%, 61.3%, and 65.0% of the variability of microbial and terrestrial humic-like, and protein-like components, respectively. Correlation-based network analysis determined the metabolic niches of the bacterial community members associated with different fluorescence types in biogeochemical processes. Furthermore, laboratory DOM bio-incubation experiments confirmed that sub-components of the CDOM pool differentially participate in bacterial metabolism. We therefore conclude that the bacterial community interacted closely with the compositional variability of DOM in the investigated alpine glacial environments by both producing and consuming of DOM.",Impacts of diel temperature variations on nitrogen removal and metacommunity of anammox biofilm reactors.,https://www.ncbi.nlm.nih.gov/pubmed/31129376,Water research,2019 06 11,"The influence of diel temperature variations (DTVs) on nitrogen removal and bacterial communities was investigated in two parallel anammox reactors (i.e., control and DTV reactors). The control reactor was operated at a constant temperature of 30 °C, whereas the DTV reactor was operated in a temperature fluctuation mode with a cycle of 12/12 h of high/low temperatures. Nine water temperature variations for the day/night periods were set from 30/30 °C (i.e., Δ0 °C) to 38/22 °C (i.e., Δ16 °C). An increase in DTVs from Δ8 °C (34/26 °C) to Δ16 °C (38/22 °C) caused a significant decline in reactor performance and a shift in bacterial diversity. Compared to the control reactor, for instance, nitrogen removal efficiency decreased (P < 0.05) when temperature fluctuations exceeded Δ8 °C in the DTV reactor with a decreasing ΔNO3-/ΔNH4+ ratio (from 0.21 ± 0.15 to 0.16 ± 0.04). The results of 16S rRNA gene sequencing showed that the initial disturbance of temperature variations led to increased levels of bacterial diversity (i.e., alpha diversity) and decreased community levels of anammox consortia whereas they slightly recovered at the end of each DTV phase. Notably, Candidatus Jettenia was more sensitive to strong water temperature fluctuations, with the lower relative abundance at Δ14 °C (17.11 ± 5.01%) and Δ16 °C (17.83 ± 7.22%) than at Δ4 °C (39.82 ± 0.01%). In contrast, Ca. Brocadia and Ca. Kuenenia had higher relative abundance at Δ14 °C (i.e., 0.24 ± 0.07% and 0.09 ± 0.02%, respectively) and Δ16 °C (i.e., 0.28 ± 0.05% and 0.12 ± 0.03%, respectively) compared to that at Δ4 °C (i.e., 0.15 ± 0.04% and 0.04 ± 0.01%, respectively). Nitrifiers (i.e., unidentified_Nitrospiraceae and Nitrosomonas) and denitrifiers (i.e., Denitratisoma) were also capable of tolerating high temperature perturbations.

These drugs in 1-mm sections of single hair specimens were each determined by a liquid chromatography-tandem mass spectrometric procedure. During the early stage (12-36 h) after intake, for black hairs, both drugs were detected over the entire area of hair root (4-5 mm in length), in which notable concentration of these drugs in the hair bulb (0-1-mm segment from the bottom of hair root, Region 1) and lower concentrations in the upper dermis zone (1-2-mm to 3-4-mm or to 4-5-mm segments, Region 2) were commonly observed. Meanwhile, for white hairs, high drug concentrations in Region 1 as detected in black hairs were not observed although only small amounts of these drugs were detected over Region 2. Subsequent time-course changes in the concentration of drugs in hair demonstrated that the drugs once incorporated into white hair via Region 2 decreased gradually over the period from 24 h to 35 days after intake, but those of black hairs remained almost unchanged. These findings revealed here suggest that hair pigments have two important roles in the distribution of drugs: (1) incorporation of drugs into hair via Region 1, and (2) retention of already incorporated drugs in the hair tissue. These findings would be useful for discussing individual drug-use history based on hair analysis in the forensic fields."

While all of these vesicles are called as EVs, the smaller size are normally called as exosomes. Small EVs (sEVs) have now been explored as a potential candidate in therapeutics delivery owing to their endogenous functionality, intrinsic targeting property, and ability to cooperate with a host defense mechanism. Considering these potentials, we hypothesize that immune cell-derived sEVs can mimic immune cell to target cancer. However, different sEVs isolation technique reported poor yield and loss of functional properties. To solve this problem, herein we hybridized sEVs with synthetic liposome to engineer vesicles with size less than 200 nm to mimic the size of exosome and named as hybrid exosome (HE). To achieve this goal, sEVs from mouse macrophage was hybridized with synthetic liposome to engineer HE. The fluorescence-based experiment confirmed the successful hybridization process yielding HE with the size of 177 ± 21 nm. Major protein analysis from Blot techniques reveal the presence of EV marker proteins CD81, CD63, and CD9. Differential cellular interaction of HE was observed when treated with normal and cancerous cells thereby supporting our hypothesis. Moreover, a water-soluble doxorubicin was loaded in HE. Drug-loaded HE showed enhanced toxicity against cancer cells and pH-sensitive drug release in acidic condition, benefiting drug delivery to acidic cancer environment. These results suggest that the engineered HE would be an exciting platform for tumor-targeted drug delivery. STATEMENT OF SIGNIFICANCE: Extracellular vesicles (EVs) are phospholipid and protein constructs which are continuously secreted by cells in the human body. These vesicles can efficiently deliver their parental biomolecules to the recipient cells and assist in intracellular communication without a direct cell-to-cell contact. Moreover, they have the ability to perform some of the molecular task similar to that of its parent cells. For example, exosome derived from immune cells can seek for diseased and/or inflammatory cells by reading the cell surface proteins. However, different EVs isolation techniques reported poor yield and loss of functional properties. Therefore, to overcome this limitation, we herein propose to re-engineer immuno-exosome with a synthetic liposome as a refined biomimetic nanostructure for the delivery of doxorubicin (clinical drug) for breast cancer treatment.",A sintered graphene/titania material as a synthetic keratoprosthesis skirt for end-stage corneal disorders.,https://www.ncbi.nlm.nih.gov/pubmed/31129362,Acta biomaterialia,2019 05 26,"An artificial cornea or keratoprosthesis requires high mechanical strength, good biocompatibility, and sufficient wear and corrosion resistance to withstand the hostile environment. We report a reduced graphene oxide-reinforced titania-based composite for this application. Graphene oxide nanoparticles (GO) and liquid crystalline graphene oxide (LCGO) were the graphene precursors and mixed with titanium dioxide (TiO2) powder. The composites reinforced with reduced GO or LCGO were produced through spark plasma sintering (SPS). The mechanical properties (Young's modulus and hardness), wear behaviour and corrosion resistance were studied using nanoindentation, anoidic polarization, long-term corrosion assay in artificial tear fluid and tribology assay in corroboration with atomic force microscopy and scanning electron microscopy. Biocompatibility was assessed by human corneal stromal cell attachment, survival and proliferation, and DNA damages. Sintered composites were implanted into rabbit corneas to assess for in vivo stability and host tissue responses. We showed that reduced graphene/TiO2 hybrids were safe and biocompatible. In particular, the 1% reduced LCGO/TiO2 (1rLCGO/TiO2) composite was mechanically strong, chemically stable, and showed better wear and corrosion resistance than pure titania and other combinations of graphene-reinforced titania. Hence the 1rLCGO/ TiO2 bioceramics can be a potential skirt biomaterial for keratoprosthesis to treat end-stage corneal blindness. STATEMENT OF SIGNIFICANCE: The osteo-odonto-keratoprosthesis(OOKP) is an artificial cornea procedure used to restore vision in end-stage corneal diseases, however it is contraindicated in young subjects, patients with advanced imflammatory diseases and posterior segment complications. Hence, there is a need of an improved keratoprosthesisskirt material with high mechanical and chemical stability, wear resistance and tissue integration ability. Our study characterized a reduced graphene oxide-reinforced titania-based biomaterial, which demonstrated strong mechanical strength, wear and corrosion resistance, and was safe and biocompatible to human corneal stromal cells. In vivo implantation to rabbit corneas did not cause any immune and inflammation outcomes.

Finally, I focus on in vitro modeling and cell-based therapies as applications of hydrogels that will exploit our ability to create micro-environments with physiologically relevant elasticity and viscoelasticity to control cell biology. These translational applications will not only use our current understanding of mechanobiology but will also bring new tools to study the fundamental problem of how cells sense their mechanical environment. STATEMENT OF SIGNIFICANCE: Hydrogels are an important tool for understanding how our cells can sense their mechanical environment, and to exploit that understanding in regenerative medicine. In the current review, I discuss historical work linking mechanics to cell behavior in vitro, and highlight the role hydrogels played in allowing us to understand how cells monitor mechanical cues. I then highlight potential translational applications of hydrogels with mechanical properties similar to those of the tissues where cells normally reside in our bodies, and discuss how these types of studies can provide clues to help us enhance our understanding of mechanosensing.",Bioinspirational understanding of flexural performance in hedgehog spines.,https://www.ncbi.nlm.nih.gov/pubmed/31129360,Acta biomaterialia,2019 06 04,"In this research, the flexural performance of hedgehog spines is investigated in four ways. First, X-ray micro-computed tomography (μCT) is employed to analyze the complex internal architecture of hedgehog spines. μCT images reveal distinct structural morphology, characterized by longitudinal stringers and transverse central plates, which enhance flexural performance. Second, computer-aided design (CAD) is utilized to create and produce different three-dimensional (3D) computational models that gradually approach resemblance to hedgehog spines. Various levels of models are constructed by including and excluding key internal features of hedgehog spines, resulting in the formation of model levels from the simplest to the most realistic form. Third, finite element analysis (FEA) is exploited to simulate flexural behavior of hedgehog spines undergoing three-point bending. FEA results aim to identify and elucidate how internal structural features affect flexural stiffness and bending stress contours. Fourth, flexural analytical modeling is performed to calculate flexural shear flow and twist angle during transverse loading. The effects of the number of hedgehog outer cells, the spine wall thickness ratio and radius ratio are theoretically investigated to predict the shear stress and twist angle of the hedgehog spine structure. Results demonstrate that longitudinal stringers of the hedgehog spine significantly increase the overall flexural stiffness, while the transverse central plates provide support and rigidity to prevent spines from buckling and collapsing. Interestingly, the 3D model level that most realistically resembles the actual hedgehog spine is evidenced to have the highest specific bending stiffness, demonstrating nature's most efficient design. The findings of this study may be useful for developing hedgehog-inspired lightweight, high-stiffness, impact-tolerant structures. STATEMENT OF SIGNIFICANCE: This research has given much needed insight on the inner morphology of hedgehog spines and the structure-property relationship to the spine's flexural performance. X-ray μCT images reveal inner structural morphology, characterized by longitudinal stringers and transverse plates. Finite element analysis shows that longitudinal stringers significantly increase flexural stiffness, while the transverse plates provide support and rigidity to prevent buckling. The model that resembles the actual hedgehog spine is evidenced to have the highest specific bending stiffness, demonstrating nature's most efficient design. Analytical model studies influence on cell number, spine geometrical ratios, and further confirms nature's perfect design with lowest flexural shear flow and twist angle during transverse loading. This work paths future design for hedgehog-inspired lightweight, high-stiffness, impact-tolerant structures.",Degradable antimicrobial polycarbonates with unexpected activity and selectivity for treating multidrug-resistant Klebsiella pneumoniae lung infection in mice.,https://www.ncbi.nlm.nih.gov/pubmed/31129359,Acta biomaterialia,2019 06 05,"Multidrug resistant (MDR) Klebsiella pneumoniae is a major cause of healthcare-associated infections around the world, with attendant high rates of morbidity and mortality. Progressive reduction in potency of antibiotics capable of treating MDR K. pneumoniae infections - including lung infection - as a consequence of escalating drug resistance provides the motivation to develop drug candidates targeting MDR K. pneumoniae. We recently reported degradable broad-spectrum antimicrobial guanidinium-functionalized polycarbonates with unique antimicrobial mechanism - membrane translocation followed by precipitation of cytosolic materials. These polymers exhibited high potency against bacteria with negligible toxicity. The polymer with ethyl spacer between the quanidinium group and the polymer backbone (pEt_20) showed excellent in vivo efficacy for treating MDR K. pneumoniae-caused peritonitis in mice. In this study, the structures of the polymers were optimized for the treatment of MDR Klebsiella pneumoniae lung infection. Specifically, in vitro antimicrobial activity and selectivity of guanidinium-functionalized polycarbonates containing the same number of guanidinium groups but of a shorter chain length and a structural analogue containing a thiouronium moiety as the pendent cationic group were evaluated. The polymers with optimal compositions and varying hydrophobicity were assessed against 25 clinically isolated K. pneumonia strains for antimicrobial activity and killing kinetics. The results showed that the polymers killed the bacteria more efficiently than clinically used antibiotics, and repeated use of the polymers did not cause drug resistance in K. pneumonia. Particularly, the polymer with butyl spacer (pBut_20) self-assembled into micelles at high concentrations, where the hydrophobic component was shielded in the micellar core, preventing interacting with mammalian cells. A subtle change in the hydrophobicity increased the antimicrobial activity while reducing in vivo toxicity. The in vivo efficacy studies showed that pBut_20 alleviated K. pneumonia lung infection without inducing damage to major organs. Taken together, pBut_20 is promising for treating MDR Klebsiella pneumoniae lung infection in vivo. STATEMENT OF SIGNIFICANCE: Multidrug resistant (MDR) Klebsiella pneumoniae is a major cause of healthcare-associated infections, with attendant high rates of morbidity and mortality. The progressive reduction in antibiotics capable of treating MDR K. pneumoniae infections - including lung infection - as a consequence of escalating drug resistance rates provides the motivation to develop drug candidates. In this study, we report a degradable guanidinium-functionalized polycarbonate with unexpected antimicrobial activity and selectivity towards MDR Klebsiella pneumoniae. A subtle change in polymer hydrophobicity increases antimicrobial activity while reducing in vivo toxicity due to self-assembly at high concentrations. The polymer with optimal composition alleviates Klebsiella pneumonia lung infection without inducing damage to major organs. The polymer is promising for treating MDR Klebsiella pneumoniae lung infection in vivo.",Toll-like receptor-targeted particles: A paradigm to manipulate the tumor microenvironment for cancer immunotherapy.,https://www.ncbi.nlm.nih.gov/pubmed/31129358,Acta biomaterialia,2019 06 02,"The expression of Toll-like receptors (TLRs) on antigen presenting cells, especially dendritic cells, offers several sensitive mediators to trigger an adaptive immune response, which potentially can be exploited to detect and eliminate pathogenic objects. Consequently, numerous agonists that target TLRs are being used clinically either alone or in combination with other therapies to strengthen the immune system in the battle against cancer. This review summarizes the roles of TLRs in tumor biology, and focuses on relevant TLR-dependent antitumor pathways and the conjugation of TLR agonists as adjuvants to nano- and micro-particles for boosting responses leading to cancer suppression and eradication. STATEMENT OF SIGNIFICANCE: Toll-like receptors (TLRs), which express on antigen presenting cells, such as dendritic cells and macrophages, play an important role in sensing pathogenic agents and inducing adaptive immunity. As a result, several TLR agonists have been investigating as therapeutic agents individually or in combination with other treatment modalities for cancer treatment through boosting the immune system. This review aims to focus on the roles of TLRs in cancer and TLR-dependent antitumor pathways as well as the use of different nano- or micro-particles bearing TLR agonists for tumor inhibition and elimination.",The relative influence of serum ionized calcium and 25-hydroxyvitamin D in regulating PTH secretion in healthy subjects.,https://www.ncbi.nlm.nih.gov/pubmed/31129357,Bone,2019 06 01,"While the inverse relationship between serum ionized calcium (Ca2+) and PTH is well-established, the relationship between 25(OH)D and PTH showed conflicting results.

B, Analytical technologies in the biomedical and life sciences",2019 06 16,"A simple, accurate, and reliable liquid chromatography-mass spectrometry (LC-MS/MS) method was developed and validated for the determination of mangiferin in rat plasma and tissue homogenates using rutin as an internal standard (IS). Chromatographic separation was achieved on a Shiseido CAPCELL PAK C18 column (150 × 2.0 mm, 5 μm) using a gradient elution of 1% acetic acid in water and methanol at a flow rate of 300 μL·min-1. Quantification was performed on an API 4000+ triple-quadrupole mass spectrometer equipped with a turbo electrospray ionization (ESI) source in positive ion multiple reaction monitoring (MRM) mode. Selected ion monitoring transitions of 423.1 → 273.1 and 611.4 → 303.3 were chosen to quantify mangiferin and IS. Biological samples were pretreated via protein precipitation with acetonitrile-acetic acid. The standard calibration curves were above the ranges of 2 to 500 ng·mL-1 and 5 to 2000 ng·mL-1 for tissues, and 1 to 600 ng·mL-1 for plasma. All calibration curves for tissue and plasma samples showed good linearity (r ≥ 0.9974) over the concentration ranges. Intra- and inter-day precisions were <14.0%, and accuracy ranged from 97.2% to 111.7%. The established method was successfully applied on mangiferin tissue distribution following the intragastric administration of mangiferin, Rhizoma Anemarrhenae (A. Rhizoma) decoction, or Rhizoma Anemarrhenae-Phellodendron (herb pair, HP) decoction under healthy or diabetic conditions. Mangiferin was detected from all the tested tissues (except for brain) after monomer administration, and the concentrations were lower compared with the decoction groups. Distributions in the HP group were lower than those in the A. Rhizoma group, but mangiferin content in pancreas was obviously higher than in other tissues and in the A. Rhizoma group. Compared with healthy rats, mangiferin distributions in pancreas and intestine were lower in diabetic rats administered with the same dose of the herb pair, but still higher than those in other tissues. In addition, distributions in liver, spleen, lung, kidney, stomach, and plasma were higher than those in the normal group.",Outcomes of Salvage Haploidentical Transplant with Post-Transplant Cyclophosphamide for Rescuing Graft Failure Patients: a Report on Behalf of the Francophone Society of Bone Marrow Transplantation and Cellular Therapy.,https://www.ncbi.nlm.nih.gov/pubmed/31129355,Biology of blood and marrow transplantation : journal of the American Society for Blood and Marrow Transplantation,2019 06 16,"Prognosis of patients with graft failure is dismal, and retransplantation is the sole option for long-term survival. To address the interest of haploidentical transplantation as a salvage option in this context, we analyzed data from 24 patients with graft failure or loss retransplanted with a haploidentical donor who received post-transplant cyclophosphamide (PTCy) as graft-versus-host disease prophylaxis (GVHD). Fludarabine-based reduced-intensity conditioning was used in 23 patients and the Baltimore regimen in 14 patients. The median delay between previous and salvage transplantation for graft failure was 63 days (range, 39 to 98). In addition to PTCy, all patients received cyclosporine, and 22 patients also received mycophenolate mofetil for GVHD prophylaxis. With a median follow-up of 353 days (range, 16 to 2010), 1-year overall survival (OS) was 56% (95% confidence interval, 38% to 81%). Transplant complications accounted for 80% of deaths. The cumulative incidence of neutrophil engraftment at day +30 was 79%. Cumulative incidence of grades II to IV acute GVHD at day 100 was 14%, and 1-year cumulative incidence of chronic GVHD was 31%. One-year cumulative incidence of relapse was 13%. Stem cell source did not impact on engraftment, GVHD, relapse, or OS. Salvage haploidentical transplant with PTCy for rescuing graft failure patients leads to an acceptable 1-year OS and might be a valid option in this poor situation.",The Case for Upfront HLA-Matched Unrelated Donor Hematopoietic Stem Cell Transplantation as a Curative Option for Adult Acquired Severe Aplastic Anemia.,https://www.ncbi.nlm.nih.gov/pubmed/31129354,Biology of blood and marrow transplantation : journal of the American Society for Blood and Marrow Transplantation,2019 06 14,"The improved success of HLA-matched unrelated donor (MUD) hematopoietic stem cell transplantation (HSCT) for severe aplastic anemia (SAA) in recent decades has had an impact on the indications for and timing of this treatment modality. In the absence of a matched sibling donor (MSD), historically MUD HSCT was reserved as an option after failure to respond to at least 2 courses of immunosuppressive therapy (IST) in adults with SAA, but with improved outcomes over time, it is now considered following failure to respond to 1 course of IST. Recent national and international studies and guidelines now recommend upfront MUD HSCT as an option for children for whom an MUD is readily available, because outcomes are similar to those for MSD HSCT. Fludarabine-based conditioning and the use of in vivo T cell depletion with antithymocyte globulin or alemtuzumab has been associated with a reported overall survival (OS) of >85% in adult patients undergoing MUD HSCT. However, the recent introduction of eltrombopag for patients with SAA has transformed the treatment landscape, and there is currently much interest in its use with IST as upfront treatment, which showed a high response rate in an early-phase study. The risks of HSCT, especially graft-versus-host disease (GVHD), need to be carefully balanced against the concerns of IST, namely relapse and later clonal evolution to myelodysplastic syndrome (MDS)/acute myelogenous leukemia (AML). In the absence of a current prospective randomized trial comparing these 2 approaches, in this review we examine the evidence supporting consideration of early MUD HSCT in adults with SAA who would have been considered for MSD HSCT but who lack a MSD and for whom an MUD is readily available, especially using an irradiation-free conditioning regimen, with a low risk of GVHD, as another treatment option. This option may be offered to patients to provide them with an informed choice, with the aim of curing disease rather than achieving freedom from disease, relapse-free survival, or OS. Furthermore, understanding the immune signature for the response to IST and the immunologic responses to somatic mutations and clonal progression to MDS/AML may help define the future indications for upfront HSCT and a more precise medical approach to therapy."

As such, the outcomes of local pharmacological treatments in oral disorders can fail due to unsuccessfully drug delivery. Oral mucositis, a severe inflammatory and ulcerative side effect of oncological treatments, is one of such diseases. Although the damaged tissue is within reach, no approved topical drug treatment is available. Several strategies based on its physiopathology have been implemented and clinically used. Even so, results tend to lack or be insufficient to improve patient's quality of life. The use of corticosteroids has been employed in such strategies due to their strong anti-inflammatory action. Typically, these are administrated in simple liquid formulations, where the drug is dispersed or solubilized, lacking the ability to maintain local concentration. In this work, we propose the development of a biocompatible delivery system with boosted abilities of retention and control release of budesonide, a corticosteroid with an elevated ratio of topical anti-inflammatory to systemic action. Through spray-drying, polymeric particles of Chitosan and Eudragit® E PO were produced and characterized for the vectorization of this drug.",Implementation of a mathematical model for the photochemical kinetics of a solid form active pharmaceutical ingredient.,https://www.ncbi.nlm.nih.gov/pubmed/31129341,International journal of pharmaceutics,2019 06 16,We present here the development of a photochemical model used to quantify the risk to photodegradation of a solid drug substance. A key feature of the proposed model development is streamlined estimation of the dependence of the absorption spectra and the quantum yield to the wavelength. A mathematical description of the relationship between the quantum yield and the wavelength enables estimation of photodegradation kinetics under any light anticipated to be encountered in the manufacturing environment. The system studied here consisted of a first order irreversible transformation (A → B(1Φ)) and the formalism strongly suggested the quantum yield was constant over the relevant wavelength range. The predictive power of the model enabled the design of a control strategy to limit the formation of the photo-degradant to very low levels. Also presented are insights obtained from quantum mechanical modeling of the electronic transitions associated with the UV absorption spectra.,pH-activated heat shock protein inhibition and radical generation enhanced NIR luminescence imaging-guided photothermal tumour ablation.,https://www.ncbi.nlm.nih.gov/pubmed/31129340,International journal of pharmaceutics,2019 06 16,"Photothermal therapy had great potential in being a new approach of tumour ablation due to their high selectivity and low side effect. However, the shallow penetration depth of near-infrared (NIR) irradiation resulted in the limited curative effect. Herein, a novel nanomedicine was developed based on the indocyanine green-loaded vanadium oxide nanocomposites (VO2-ICG) for pH-activated NIR luminescence imaging-guided enhanced photothermal tumour ablation. In acidic tumour microenvironment, the VO2 NPs were decomposed and released VO2+, which could not only inhibit the function of 60 kDa heat shock protein (HSP60), but also generate hydroxyl radical (OH) by catalysing intratumoral H2O2. Furthermore, the ICG was also released in the decomposition process of VO2 NPs, allowing the pH-activated NIR luminescence imaging and photothermal therapy. The inhibition of HSP60 down-regulated the heat tolerance of cells and the generation of OH up-regulated the intracellular oxidative stress, which enhanced the photothermal therapeutic efficiency. Our work demonstrated a promised method to enhance photothermal therapeutic effect, highlighting the importance of HSP inhibition and OH generation in promoting cell apoptosis under mild hyperthermia.",Effects of titanium dioxide nanoparticles on Microcystis aeruginosa and microcystins production and release.,https://www.ncbi.nlm.nih.gov/pubmed/31129339,Journal of hazardous materials,2019 06 13,"Due to growing production and use, release of nanoparticles (NPs) into the aquatic environment may pose a hazard to ecosystem. In this study, Microcystis aeruginosa was exposed to different concentrations (0.1, 1, 10, 50, 100 mg/L) of titanium dioxide (TiO2) NPs to assess their impact on algae. Meanwhile, the production and release of microcystins (MCs) was determined. Results showed that TiO2 NPs significantly decreased the maximal photochemical efficiency of photosystem II, and thus inhibited the photosynthetic activity of M. aeruginosa. They also increased the content of reactive oxygen species (ROS) and malondialdehyde (MDA), indicating their oxidative damage on algae. Besides, TiO2 NPs at high concentrations (50 and 100 mg/L) aggregated on the algal surface and block the light, herein inhibited algae growth (16.03%±2.50% and 54.13%±0.93%) but induced the production (25.02%±1.23% and 114.43%±2.96%) and release (20.96%±13.30% and 12.10%±8.80%) of MCs. These results indicated that high concentrations of TiO2 NPs increased MCs concentration in water system, which may be harmful to aquatic ecosystem.",Fouling and wetting in the membrane distillation driven wastewater reclamation process - A review.,https://www.ncbi.nlm.nih.gov/pubmed/31129338,Advances in colloid and interface science,2019 06 13,"Fouling and wetting of membranes are significant concerns that can impede the widespread application of the membrane distillation (MD) process during high-salinity wastewater reclamation. Fouling, caused by the accumulation of undesirable materials on the membrane surface and pores, causes a decrease in permeate flux. Membrane wetting, the direct permeation of the feed solution through the membrane pores, results in reduced contaminant rejection and overall process failure. Lately, the application of MD for water recovery from various types of wastewaters has gained increased attention among researchers. In this review, we discuss fouling and wetting phenomena observed during the MD process, along with the effects of various mitigation strategies. In addition, we examine the interactions between contaminants and different types of MD membranes and the influence of different operating conditions on the occurrence of fouling and wetting. We also report on previously investigated feed pre-treatment options before MD, application of integrated MD processes, the performance of fabricated/modified MD membranes, and strategies for MD membrane maintenance during water reclamation. Energy consumption and economic aspects of MD for wastewater recovery is also discussed. Throughout the review, we engage in dialogues highlighting research needs for furthering the development of MD: the incorporation of MD in the overall wastewater treatment and recovery scheme (including selection of appropriate membrane material, suitable pre-treatment or integrated processes, and membrane maintenance strategies) and the application of MD in long-term pilot-scale studies using real wastewater.",Humoral responses in cattle to commercial vaccines containing Clostridium perfringens epsilon toxoid and C. botulinum types C and D toxoids last less than a-year.,https://www.ncbi.nlm.nih.gov/pubmed/31129336,Anaerobe,2019 06 16,"The aim of this study was to evaluate the titers of neutralizing antibodies in cattle inoculated with multivalent commercial clostridial vaccines containing C. botulinum type C (BoNTC), C. botulinum type D (BoNTD), and C. perfringens epsilon (ETX) toxoids for a period of one year. Cattle (Bos taurus), aged 4-6 months and not previously immunized, were vaccinated under four different protocols at days 0 and 30 and followed over one year. Individual serum titration was performed by a serum neutralization test in mice or in MDCK cells. The number of animals with detectable neutralizing antibodies ranged from 40.6% to 78.1%, but only 12.5% of animals showed neutralizing antibodies against all tested antigens. Neutralizing antibodies were found only until 60 days for ETX, 120 days for BoNTC, and 180 days for BoNTD. The absence of detectable neutralizing antibodies against the three antigens before 360 days, suggests that cattle remained unprotected for a long period before the recommended booster vaccination.","Effects of soil erosion and reforestation on soil respiration, organic carbon and nitrogen stocks in an eroded area of Southern China.",https://www.ncbi.nlm.nih.gov/pubmed/31129335,The Science of the total environment,2019 06 04,"Soil erosion and reforestation greatly affects the functionality of many terrestrial ecosystems. However, the effects of soil erosion and reforestation on soil respiration (SR), and soil organic carbon (SOC) and total nitrogen (TN) stocks remain unclear. Therefore, we investigated the changes in SR, and SOC and TN stocks at four different soil erosion levels (severely, moderately, lightly, and non-eroded) and two different aged Pinus massoniana plantations (8- and 36-year-old) in the hilly red soil regions of Southern China. Our results showed that soil erosion level and reforestation significantly influenced SR, and SOC and TN stocks. Meanwhile, the mean SR, and SOC and TN stocks all significantly decreased with erosion level but increased significantly with times since reforestation. Soil temperature (ST) could explain 70-92% of SR seasonal variation based on exponential models, whereas no significant relationship between SR and soil water content were found. Furthermore, the structural equation modeling indicated that SOC stocks at 0-20 cm had a much stronger effect on SR than ST. Meanwhile, the SOC stocks for 0-20 cm increased by 177% and 558% in the 8- and 36-year-old Pinus massoniana plantations in comparison with the severely eroded forestland, respectively. This study highlights that reforestation could be an effective strategy for restoring the carbon and nitrogen storage in eroded regions of Southern China and emphasizes the need to consider the effects of soil erosion and reforestation when assessing regional carbon budgets under different climate scenarios.",Nitrate reduction via micro-electrolysis on Zn-Ag bimetal combined with photo-assistance.,https://www.ncbi.nlm.nih.gov/pubmed/31129334,The Science of the total environment,2019 06 04,"A selective and efficient chemical reduction of nitrate to nitrogen gas using micro-electrolysis on ZnAg combined with a photo-assisted reduction in the presence of formic acid was investigated. The 99.58% removal of nitrate, 0.073 min-1 of rate constant and 94.3% nitrogen selectivity were achieved in Zn-Ag/hv/HCOOH system under the initial pH 2.5, 13.8 mmol/L of formic acid and 60 g/L of Zn-0.06%Ag dose at 60 min. The Zn-Ag/hv/HCOOH system had the highest removal rate and nitrogen selectivity for nitrate reduction compared with the alone or two combinations of ZnAg bimetals, formic acid, and UV-A. Furthermore, the co-existence anions of HCO3- and CO32- showed a negative effect on nitrate reduction while SO42- had slightly promoted the reduction process. During the nitrate reduction by Zn-Ag/hv/HCOOH process, rapid reduction of NO3- to NO2- was primarily caused by ZnAg bimetal. Subsequently, the conversion of NO2- to N2 was mainly owing to the produced CO2- by the reaction of formic acid and UV-A. The results suggested a novel strategy of chemical reduction combined with photoreduction for denitrification with high reaction kinetic as well as high nitrogen gas selectivity.",Linking environmental sustainability and nutritional quality of the Atlantic diet recommendations and real consumption habits in Galicia (NW Spain).,https://www.ncbi.nlm.nih.gov/pubmed/31129333,The Science of the total environment,2019 06 04,"Today's society is increasingly aware of food consumption patterns. Under the perspective that real consumption trends are often not in line with healthy recommendations, this research focuses on the study of the environmental and nutritional sustainability of two types of food consumption habits present in the northern Atlantic area of Spain (Galicia). The main objective is, therefore to detect the existing deviations between the current Galician diet (GD) and the traditional and increasingly relevant Recommended Atlantic Diet (RAD), allowing verifying whether current consumption patterns ensure an optimal and sustainable nutritional profile. In this sense, the carbon footprint from a Life Cycle Assessment perspective has been estimated as environmental indicator of both dietary patterns and, the nutritional quality has been determined by the Nutrient Rich Diet 9.3 index and the Health gain score. The carbon footprint of both dietary models is moderately high compared to recommended diets such as the Mediterranean one. Comparing the two scenarios, the associated greenhouse gas emissions are about 15% higher for GD than for RAD, mainly due to the higher intake of beef and dairy products. On the other hand, nutritional quality is comparatively higher for RAD than for GD, associated with higher consumption of vegetables and fruits. An additional objective of this work has been to consider a sensitivity analysis to determine the effect of replacing beef with alternative sources. Having in mind this study, it can be concluded that the real consumption pattern in Galicia is far from the recommended one, with worse environmental and nutritional quality. The promotion of social awareness policies to guide consumers in the choice a healthier and more environmentally sustainable dietary pattern should be advisable for regional decision-makers as well as for those who wish to promote adherence to the Atlantic diet in other regions and countries.",Nitrogen transport and retention in a headwater catchment with dense distributions of lowland ponds.,https://www.ncbi.nlm.nih.gov/pubmed/31129330,The Science of the total environment,2019 06 04,"The existence of lowland ponds alter watershed nitrogen (N) cycles via combined changes in runoff and N processing potential, which can significantly buffer watershed N transport. Here, we adopt the conceptual framework of the SPAtially Referenced Regressions On Watershed attributes (SPARROW) model to describe N transport and explore the buffering roles of lowland ponds in a small headwater watershed of Taihu Lake Basin, China. Our model, which included variables for nutrient sources, riverine length, precipitation and pond density, explained 95% of the spatio-temporal variability in total N loads. Results indicated that the northern parts of this watershed were hotspot regions, which contributed relatively large N yields. While their contributions have high temporal variations, they depend upon local precipitation rates. The model results also revealed important processes of landscape N retention. On average, approximately 87% of terrestrial N inputs were removed via denitrification, plant uptake, and other processes or retained in the subsurface during land-to-water delivery. This amount can be further differentiated into 12% retained by lowland ponds and the remaining 75% associated with other landscapes including nutrient storage in soils and groundwater, as a legacy of historical inputs. By contrast, in-stream retention processes only removed 3% of the total terrestrial N inputs. In the future, riverine N pollution will likely be exacerbated by releases from legacy storage and intensified human activities, especially as climate change is expected to enhance extreme rainfall conditions. An integrated N management strategy that appropriately considers the buffering roles of lowland ponds and other landscapes, is required to optimize N fertilizer inputs and protect precious headwater resources."

Phosphogypsum (PG) contains plenty of phosphate (PO43-), fluorine (F-) and some heavy metals. Separate storage of EMR and PG could seriously damage the ecological environment. In this study, synergistic stabilization/solidification (S/S) of EMR and PG was studied. The effects of EMR:PG mass ratio, S/S pH, solid-liquid ratio and temperature on the concentrations of NH4+-N, PO43-, Mn2+ and F- in the leaching solution, and the characteristics of EMR and PG were studied. Meanwhile, the synergistic S/S mechanisms of EMR and PG, and leaching test were investigated. The results showed that the concentrations of F-, PO43-, NH4+-N and Mn2+ in the leaching solution were 4.5 mg/L, 13.6 mg/L, 55.5 mg/L and 0.8 mg/L, respectively, when the mass ratio of EMR to PG was 1:2 and the pH was 9.0 adjusted by MgO after 20 days S/S. Manganese was mainly solidified as Mn3(PO4)2·7H2O and Mn(OH)2, and ammonia nitrogen was mainly stabilized as struvite; fluorine was mainly stabilized as (Mn, Ca, Mg)F2, and phosphate was mainly solidified as (Mn, Ca, Mg)3(PO4)2 and (Mn, Ca, Mg)HPO4. The leaching test results showed that PO43- and NH4+-N were reduced to 13.6 mg/L and 55.5 mg/L, respectively, and the concentrations of all the measured heavy metals and F- were within the permitted level for the GB8978-1996 after 20 days S/S.",Anti-atherosclerotic action of GW9508 - Free fatty acid receptors activator - In apoE-knockout mice.,https://www.ncbi.nlm.nih.gov/pubmed/31129318,Pharmacological reports : PR,2019 06 14,"In the past two decades, enhanced understanding of the biology of G-protein-coupled receptors (GPRs) has led to the identification of several such receptors as novel targets for free fatty acids (FFAs).

However, the transition from ICD-9-CM to ICD-10-CM diagnostic coding in 2015 left researchers without methods for comparing the prevalence of pain conditions before and after the transition. In this study, we developed and assessed a diagnostic framework to serve as a crosswalk between ICD-9-CM and ICD-10-CM diagnosis codes for common pain-related health conditions. We refined existing ICD-9-CM definitions for diagnostic clusters of common pain conditions consistent with the US National Pain Strategy and developed corresponding ICD-10-CM definitions. We then assessed the stability of prevalence estimates and associated patient socio-demographic features of each diagnostic cluster during one-year periods before and after the transition to ICD-10-CM in three US health care systems using electronic health records data for in-person encounters. Prevalence estimates and socio-demographic characteristics were similar before and after the transition. The Pain Condition ICD-9-CM to ICD-10-CM Crosswalk includes a full spectrum of common pain conditions to enable prevalence estimates of multiple and chronic overlapping pain conditions. This allows the tool to serve as a foundation for a broad array of pain-related health services research utilizing electronic databases. Perspective: This article details the development and assessment of the Pain Condition ICD-9-CM to ICD-10-CM Crosswalk, a diagnostic framework for assessing pain condition prevalence across the ICD-9-CM to ICD-10-CM transition.

Emerging evidence suggests the estimated heritability for chronic pain is 45% and that genetic factors partially explain individual susceptibility to CPSP. The aim of this study was to systematically review, assess quality and summarize the studies in humans that have investigated genetic factors associated with CPSP. We also conducted a meta-analysis to derive a single effect size for evaluable genetic associations with CPSP. Our comprehensive literature search included review of 21 full-text articles evaluating variants of 69 genes for association with CPSP. We found significant gene variant associations reported for variants/haplotypes of 26 genes involved in neurotransmission, pain signaling, immune responses and neuroactive ligand-receptor interaction, with CPSP. Six variants of five genes (COMT: rs4680 and rs6269, OPRM1: rs1799971, GCH1: rs3783641, KCNS1: rs734784 and TNFA: rs1800629), were evaluated by more than one study and were included in the meta-analysis. At rs734784 (A>G) of KCNS1, presence of G allele marginally increased risk of CPSP (Additive genetic model; Odds ratio: 1.511; 95% CI 1 to 2.284; p-value 0.050), while the other variants did not withstand meta-analyses criteria. Our findings demonstrate the role of genetic factors with different functions in CPSP, and also emphasize that single genetic factors have small effect sizes in explaining complex conditions like CPSP. Heterogeneity in surgical cohorts, population structure and outcome definitions, as well as small number of available studies evaluating same variants, limit the meta-analysis. There is a need for large-scale, homogenous, replication studies to validate candidate genes, and understand the underlying biological networks underpinning CPSP. Perspective: Our systematic review comprehensively describes 21 studies evaluating genetic association with CPSP, and limitations thereof. A meta-analysis of 6 variants (5 genes) found marginally increased risk for CPSP associated with rs734784 A>G of the potassium voltage-gated channel gene (KCNS1).

Prompt treatment is critical for preventing progression and reducing neuropathy. We report a patient who presented with cranial neuropathy related to a malignant skull base lesion that originated as lentigo maligna. The diagnosis was challenging, requiring two surgeries to obtain tissue and neither biopsy leading to a definitive diagnosis. Pathological analyses demonstrated positive immunoreactivity for SOX10 and S100, preservation of H3K27me3, and PTEN and STK11 mutations. The patient was managed with Gamma Knife Radiosurgery and combination immunotherapy. Imaging at 9 months post-SRS showed resolution of the mass lesion. Clinically, the patient has occasional left-sided facial pain requiring no medication and denies facial numbness. We favor a diagnosis of desmoplastic neurotropic melanoma due to the neurotropic spread and response to melanoma-targeted immunotherapy.","Voltage-gated sodium channels: structures, functions, and molecular modeling.",https://www.ncbi.nlm.nih.gov/pubmed/31129313,Drug discovery today,2019 06 09,"Voltage-gated sodium channels (VGSCs), formed by 24 transmembrane segments arranged into four domains, have a key role in the initiation and propagation of electrical signaling in excitable cells. VGSCs are involved in a variety of diseases, including epilepsy, cardiac arrhythmias, and neuropathic pain, and therefore have been regarded as appealing therapeutic targets for the development of anticonvulsant, antiarrhythmic, and local anesthetic drugs. In this review, we discuss recent advances in understanding the structures and biological functions of VGSCs. In addition, we systematically summarize eight pharmacologically distinct ligand-binding sites in VGSCs and representative isoform-selective VGSC modulators in clinical trials. Finally, we review studies on molecular modeling and computer-aided drug design (CADD) for VGSCs to help understanding of biological processes involving VGSCs.",Neurophysiological evidence for early modulation of amygdala activity by emotional reappraisal.,https://www.ncbi.nlm.nih.gov/pubmed/31129312,Biological psychology,2019 06 08,"How emotions unfold through time in the brain, and how fast they can be regulated by voluntary control, remain unresolved. Psychological accounts of emotion regulation posit cognitive reappraisal mechanisms may alter early emotion generative processes directly, whereas suppression impacts only later processing stages, after emotion has arisen. However, to date, there is no neurophysiological data concerning the precise latency of emotion regulation effects on the amygdala, a major emotion processing relay in the brain. Here we record amygdala activity from six patients undergoing surgery for pharmaco-resistant epilepsy during both reappraisal and suppression. We find that emotion reappraisal strategy, but not suppression, modulates early neural responses to emotional scenes during an extended period of time, starting 130 ms post-stimulus onset. Further, reappraisal produced earlier impact on amygdala responses to positive compared to negative scenes. Our results provide the first neurophysiological support for theoretical accounts of emotion regulation that postulate an early modulation of emotion generative processes by reappraisal.",Genome sequencing of Bacillus thuringiensis isolate T414 toxic to pink bollworm (Pectinophora gossypiella Saunders) and its insecticidal genes.,https://www.ncbi.nlm.nih.gov/pubmed/31129311,Microbial pathogenesis,2019 06 16,"Bacillus thuringiensis is a spore-forming bacterium that is pathogenic towards a range of insect and nematode species and had been widely used as a biopesticide. In this study, we present the morphological, molecular and genetic characteristics of an indigenous Bt isolate T414 which displayed an effective toxicity against Pectinophora gossypiella. Scanning electron microscopy revealed the presence of bipyramidal, spherical and cubic shaped protein crystals in its spore-crystal suspension. SDS-PAGE analysis of its spore-crystal mixture showed the presence of two major protein bands viz.130 and 65 kDa. Whole genome sequencing with MiSeq divulged that it contains a chromosome and many plasmids. The assembled genome finally contained 6493494bp. Automated annotation of this genome draft predicted 6877 coding sequences and 152 RNAs (rRNAs, tRNAs and ncRNAs). NCBI blast analysis showed that assembled genome was distributed in a chromosome and 15 different types of plasmids. Further analysis of draft sequence revealed it harbors parasporal crystal protein genes (cry1Aa, cry1Ab, cry1Ac, cry1IAa, cry2Aa, cry2Ab and cyt1), vegetative insecticidal protein gene (vip3Aa), all plasmid borne and various additional virulence factors such as chitinases, proteases, bacteriocins and hemolysins. From the analysis it is evident that all the Cry, Cyt or Vip toxins are plasmid borne and are present on two types of plasmids named as p414A and p414E in the present study.

Photoacoustic (PA) signals are inherently recorded in a noisy environment and are also exposed to noise by system components. Therefore, it is essential to reduce the noise in PA signals to reconstruct images with less error. In this study, an image reconstruction algorithm for PAM system was implemented and different filtering approaches for denoising were compared. Studies were carried out in three steps: simulation, experimental phantom and blood cell studies. FIR low-pass and band-pass filters and Discrete Wavelet Transform (DWT) based filters (mother wavelets: ""bior3.5″, ""bior3.7″, ""sym7″) with four different thresholding techniques were examined. For the evaluation purposes, Root Mean Square Error (RMSE), Signal to Noise Ratio (SNR) and Contrast to Noise Ratio (CNR) metrics were calculated. In the simulation studies, the most effective methods were obtained as: sym7/heursure/hard thresh. combination (low and medium level noise) and bior3.7/sqtwolog/soft thresh. combination (high-level noise). In experimental phantom studies, noise was classified into five levels. Different filtering approaches perform better depending on the SNR of PA images. For the blood cell study, based on the standard deviation in the background, sym7/sqtwolog/soft thresh. combination provided the best improvement and this result supported the experimental phantom results."

While substrate elasticity has been investigated for its influence on bacterial adhesion, the impact of substrate viscosity has not been explored. Here, the importance of considering substrate viscosity is explored by using polydimethylsiloxane (PDMS) as the substrate material, whose mechanical properties can be tuned from predominantly elastic to viscous by varying cross-linking degree. Interfacial rheology and atomic force microscopy analysis prove that PDMS with a low cross-linking degree exhibits both low stiffness and high viscosity. This degree of viscoelasticity confers to PDMS a remarkable stress relaxation, a good capability to deform and an increased adhesive force. Bacterial adhesion assays were conducted under flow conditions to study the impact of substrate viscosity on Escherichia coli adhesion. The viscous PDMS not only enhanced E. coli adhesion but also conferred greater resistance to desorption against shear stress at air/liquid interface, compared to the PDMS with high crosslinking degree. These findings highlight the importance to consider substrate viscosity while studying bacterial adhesion. The current work provides new insights to an improved understanding of how bacteria interact with complex viscoelastic environments.",Halloysite nanotubes-carbon dots hybrids multifunctional nanocarrier with positive cell target ability as a potential non-viral vector for oral gene therapy.,https://www.ncbi.nlm.nih.gov/pubmed/31129295,Journal of colloid and interface science,2019 06 12,The use of non-viral vectors for gene therapy is hindered by their lower transfection efficiency and their lacking of self-track ability.,A new durable pigment with hydrophobic surface based on natural nanotubes and indigo: Interactions and stability.,https://www.ncbi.nlm.nih.gov/pubmed/31129294,Journal of colloid and interface science,2019 06 12,"Covering with polyorganosilane (POS) was proved as an effective way to enhance the chemical and thermal stability of clay/dye hybrid pigments. But the photostability and interactions with clay minerals, dyes and POS layer has never been reported. In order to investigate above issues, new organic-inorganic hybrid pigments based on halloysite (Hal) and indigo (In) were prepared by grinding method. X-ray diffraction, transmission electron microscopy, thermogravimetry, Fourier transform infrared spectroscopy were applied to characterize the structure of In-Hal (without POS layer) and In-Hal-POS (with POS layer) pigments. Solid state nuclear magnetic resonance (NMR) was employed to reveal the interactions between Hal, In and POS. Reflection spectra and CIE 1976 color space system were used to evaluate the color parameters and color changes of pigments. Thermal stability, chemical resistance to ethanol, 1 mol·L-1 HCl and 1 mol⋅L-1 NaOH, and light fastness to visible light were tested. Indigo molecules dispersed on the surface of Hal nanotubes. POS layer homogeneously covered on the surface of hybrid pigments, without changing the crystal structure and morphology of Hal. Covering with POS layer seldomly affect the color of hybrid pigments. However, In-Hal-POS exhibited better stability than In-Hal, due to hydrophobic surface which can prevent indigo molecules from chemical reactions and degradation. A new route was proposed to prepare organic-inorganic hybrid pigments, ignoring the interaction between dye molecules and substrates.","Activity of proteolytic enzymes in the intestine of bream Abramis brama infected with cestodes Caryophyllaeus laticeps (Cestoda, Caryophyllidea).",https://www.ncbi.nlm.nih.gov/pubmed/31129293,"Comparative biochemistry and physiology. Part B, Biochemistry & molecular biology",2019 06 16,"Adaptive mechanisms underlying the long-term existence of intestinal parasites in their enzymatically hostile environment are still poorly understood, particularly with regard to fish cestodes. The study describes the activity distribution of proteolytic enzymes along the gut of the bream Abramis brama infected with intestinal cestodes Caryophyllaeus laticeps and characterizes the capacity of these worms to inhibit host proteinase activity. Mucosal proteolytic activity was mainly presented by serine proteinases. The research revealed an insignificant increase in total proteolytic activity from anterior and middle to posterior part of the gut accompanied with changes in proportions of various proteinase subclasses along the intestine. The trypsin (but not chymotrypsin) activity in the posterior section was significantly higher than in the mid-section. Both the incubation medium of the worms and their extract had a significant inhibitory effect on mucosal proteolytic activity and commercial trypsin samples. In both instances, the effect was comparable with that of a synthetic serine protease inhibitor, PMSF. SDS-PAGE electrophoregrams of the incubation medium of C. laticeps and its extract revealed three common protein bands, with apparent molecular masses from 19 to 47 kDa, possibly responsible for the worms' inhibitory capacities. According to casein-zymography performed, the target host proteinases for a putative cestode inhibitor (inhibitors) have an approximate molecular weight of 28-53 kDa. A comparative test with the extracts from three other cestodes showed that each of them can suppress the proteolytic activity of the bream mucosa. The level of inhibitory activity was found to increase with protein content in the extracts of these tapeworms.",Detergent-resistant domains in Spodoptera frugiperda midgut microvillar membranes and their relation to microapocrine secretion.,https://www.ncbi.nlm.nih.gov/pubmed/31129292,"Comparative biochemistry and physiology. Part B, Biochemistry & molecular biology",2019 06 16,"The midgut from lepidopteran insects has a particular way to release proteins to the lumen, named microapocrine secretion that could be an adaptation to release secretory contents into the lumen at water absorbing regions. In this process small vesicles (microapocrine vesicles) bud from the midgut microvilli as double membrane vesicles, where the inner membrane comes from the secretion vesicle and the outer one from the microvillar membrane. The molecular machinery associated with this process may be recruited by specific midgut microvilli membrane domains. To address to this, Spodoptera frugiperda midgut microvillar membranes, prepared by magnesium treatment and free from cytoskeleton with the hyperosmotic Tris procedure, were submitted to detergent extraction and fractionated by density gradient ultracentrifugation. Detergent-resistant membrane domains (DRM) were recovered and their proteins identified by proteomics. Microapocrine vesicles were isolated by washing the luminal surface of the midgut epithelium, followed by freezing and thawing plus centrifugation to recover only membranes. Proteins from purified microvillar membranes and microapocrine vesicle membranes were identified by proteomics. Comparison of the two populations suggests that the budding of microapocrine vesicles surrounded by microvillar membrane is not a random process, because only around 50% of the microvillar membrane proteins are in the microapocrine vesicles. From the 16 proteins from DRM, 14 were enriched in the microapocrine membrane vesicles. These results suggest that on budding, the microapocrine vesicle membrane is enclosed by DRM and a surrounding area of the microvillar membrane. It is proposed that the DRMs somehow recruit the proteins composing the secretory machinery.",Purification and functional analysis of the shell matrix protein N66 from the shell of the pearl oyster Pteria sterna.,https://www.ncbi.nlm.nih.gov/pubmed/31129291,"Comparative biochemistry and physiology.

In this study, a shell matrix protein, N66, has been purified and characterized biochemically from the shell of Pteria sterna. Two protein bands with carbohydrates associated were separated with a molecular weight of ~60 and 64 kDa. It has carbonic anhydrase activity and it is able to form crystal polymorphs of calcium carbonate in vitro. The mRNA N66 was obtained from the mantle tissue of Pteria sterna and the deduced amino acid sequence contained a carbonic anhydrase (CA) domain and a Asn/Gly-rich domain (aa243-439). The CA domain contained three His residues acting as zinc ligands and the gate-keeper residues present in all α-CAs (Glu166-Thr525), being thus similar to the human isoform hCAVII. Also, to test whether the posttranslational modifications present on the native N66 affects the CA activity and its crystallization capability in vitro, a recombinant N66 was overexpressed in Escherichia coli and functionally characterized. Our results show that recombinant N66 has higher CA activity and produce larger size crystals in vitro than the native N66 protein, suggesting that intrinsic properties of the native N66, such as glycosylations and/or phosphorylations, might regulate its activity.",3D super-resolution microscopy performance and quantitative analysis assessment using DNA-PAINT and DNA origami test samples.,https://www.ncbi.nlm.nih.gov/pubmed/31129290,"Methods (San Diego, Calif.)",2019 06 02,"Assessment of the imaging quality in localisation-based super-resolution techniques relies on an accurate characterisation of the imaging setup and analysis procedures.

Here, we analyse robust test samples for 3D and quantitative super-resolution imaging, which are straightforward to use, are time- and cost-effective and do not require experience beyond basic laboratory and imaging skills. We present two options for assessment of 3D imaging quality, the use of microspheres functionalised for DNA-PAINT and a commercial DNA origami sample.

However, many biochemical approaches to monitoring RNA structures are time-consuming and low-throughput, and thereby are only of limited utility for RNA-small molecule studies. Fluorescence-based techniques are powerful tools for rapid investigation of RNA conformations, dynamics, and interactions with small molecules. Many fluorescence methods are amenable to high-throughput analysis, enabling library screening for small molecule binders. In this review, we summarize numerous fluorescence-based approaches for identifying and characterizing RNA-small molecule interactions. We describe in detail a high-information content dual-reporter FRET assay we developed to characterize small molecule-induced conformational and stability changes. Our assay is uniquely suited as a platform for both small molecule discovery and thorough characterization of RNA-small molecule binding mechanisms. Given the growing recognition of non-coding RNAs as attractive targets for therapeutic intervention, we anticipate our FRET assay and other fluorescence-based techniques will be indispensable for the development of potent and specific small molecule inhibitors targeting RNA.",Detection of distortions in images of natural scenes in mild traumatic brain injury patients.,https://www.ncbi.nlm.nih.gov/pubmed/31129288,Vision research,2019 06 16,"Mild traumatic brain injuries (mTBI) frequently lead to the impairment of visual functions including blurred and/or distorted vision, due to the disruption of visual cortical mechanisms. Previous mTBI studies have focused on specific aspects of visual processing, e.g., stereopsis, using artificial, low-level, stimuli (e.g., Gaussian patches and gratings). In the current study we investigated high-level visual processing by employing images of real world natural scenes as our stimuli. Both an mTBI group and control group composed of healthy observers were tasked with detecting sinusoidal distortions added to the natural scene stimuli as a function of the distorting sinusoid's spatial frequency. It was found that the mTBI group were equally as sensitive to high frequency distortions as the control group. However, sensitivity decreased more rapidly with decreasing distortion frequency in the mTBI group relative to the controls. These data reflect a deficit in the mTBI group to spatially integrate over larger regions of the scene.",Nonlinearities in the flicker electroretinogram: A tool for studying retinal dysfunction applied to early-stage diabetic retinopathy.,https://www.ncbi.nlm.nih.gov/pubmed/31129287,Vision research,2019 06 16,"The flicker electroretinogram (ERG) is typically analyzed in terms of peak-to-trough amplitude and implicit time.

This study describes an approach to analyze the harmonic components of the flicker ERG and its application to patients who have early-stage non-proliferative diabetic retinopathy (NPDR). Of particular interest were the sub-harmonic components occurring at 1.5x and 2.5x the stimulus frequency that produce cycle-to-cycle variation in amplitude termed ""period doubling."" Twenty visually-normal subjects, 20 diabetic subjects who have no clinically-apparent retinopathy (NDR), and 20 diabetic subjects who have mild NPDR participated. ERGs were recorded in response to sinusoidal flicker (27-63 Hz) and Fourier analysis was performed to extract fundamental and harmonic response amplitudes. Linear quantile mixed models (LQMMs) were used to compare the amplitude of the response components among the three subject groups. Results indicated that the maximum sub-harmonic amplitude occurred in the stimulus frequency range of 33-38 Hz for all subjects. The LQMMs showed a significant sub-harmonic amplitude reduction for the mild NPDR subjects compared to the controls; sub-harmonic amplitude for the NDR subjects did not differ significantly from the controls. In contrast, the fundamental response did not differ among the groups for stimulus frequencies between 33 and 38 Hz. Modeling these results indicated that subharmonic amplitude loss in mild NPDR subjects may be attributed to attenuated feedback occurring early in the retina, possibly at the synapse of cone photoreceptors and OFF bipolar cells."

For steroidogenesis, 18 miRNAs could elevate or inhibit androsterone release at the PLC stage. Eleven and 9 miRNAs inhibited the production of 5α-androstane-3α,17β-diol in ILCs and testosterone in ALCs, respectively. miR-17-5p, miR-29a-3p and miR-299a-5p decreased androgen production by LCs at all developmental stages. Furthermore, the miR-299a-5p-mediated decrease in androgen production by the LC lineage was primarily achieved by downregulating the expression of luteinizing hormone/choriogonadotropin receptor (LHCGR) and 3β-hydroxysteroid dehydrogenase 1 (HSD3B1). These findings provide insights into the regulatory roles of miRNAs during the postnatal development of LCs and suggest potential strategies for the treatment of steroid-related disorders.","FOXE1 inhibits cell proliferation, migration and invasion of papillary thyroid cancer by regulating PDGFA.",https://www.ncbi.nlm.nih.gov/pubmed/31129275,Molecular and cellular endocrinology,2019 05 26,"Forkhead box E1 (FOXE1) plays an important role in the development, proliferation and differentiation of thyroid cells.

Before such systems could potentially be used, their biocompatibility must be evaluated. In this study, dexamethasone acetate-loaded poly(ɛ-caprolactone) nanofibers (DX PCL nanofibers) were developed for targeted delivery in the vitreous cavity in the treatment of retinal diseases. Ocular biocompatibility was tested in vitro and in vivo. DX PCL nanofibers were characterized by scanning electron microscopy (SEM) and Fourier Transform InfraRed spectroscopy (FTIR) and the in vitro drug release from nanofibers was evaluated. The in vitro biocompatibility of DX PCL nanofibers was tested on both ARPE-19 and MIO-M1 cells using the cytotoxicity (MTT) test by morphological studies based on staining of the actin fibers in ARPE-19 cells and GFAP in MIO-M1 cells. The in vivo biocompatibility of DX PCL nanofibers was investigated after intravitreous injection in the rat eye, using spectral domain Optical Coherence Tomography (OCT) imaging of the retina. SEM results indicated that nanometric fibers were interconnected in a complex network, and that they were composed of polymer. FTIR showed that polymer and drug did not chemically interact after the application of the electrospinning technique. PCL nanofibers provided controlled DX release for 10 days. DX PCL nanofibers were not cytotoxic to the ocular cells, allowing for the preservation of actin fibers and GFAP in the cytoplasm of ARPE-19 and MIO-M1 cells, respectively, which are biomarkers of these ocular cell populations. DX PCL nanofibers did not affect the retinal and choroidal structures, and they did not induce abnormalities, hemorrhages, or retinal detachment, suggesting that the nanofibers were well tolerated. In eyes receiving DX PCL nanofibers, SD-OCT images were corroborated with histological analysis of neuroretina and choroid, which are ocular tissues that are extremely sensitive to toxic agents. Finally, the preservation of cone and rod photoreceptors indicated the light sensitivity of the animals. In conclusion, DX PCL nanofibers exhibited ocular biocompatibility and safety in the rodent eye and allow the release of dexamethasone. Further studies are required to appreciate the potential of these new drug delivery systems for the treatment of retinal diseases.","Cloning, functional analysis, and microRNA-induced negative regulation of growth arrest and DNA damage-inducible 45 γ (Gadd45g) in grass carp (Ctenopharyngodon idella).",https://www.ncbi.nlm.nih.gov/pubmed/31129273,Developmental and comparative immunology,2019 06 16,"Growth arrest and DNA damage-inducible 45 gamma (Gadd45g) is a member of Gadd45 gene family of immunological proteins in mammals. Herein, we identified and characterised Gadd45g from grass carp. The cDNA spans over 1189 bp, with an open reading frame of 480 bp encoding a 159 amino acid protein. CiGadd45g mRNAs were expressed in all tissues investigated, with abundant expression in liver, kidney, heart, brain, blood and skin. Following infection with Aeromonas hydrophila, CiGadd45g expression was upregulated in these immune-related tissues (gill, liver, spleen, intestine, kidney and head kidney). Immune-related cytokines (p38 and JNK) and proinflammatory cytokines (IL-8, IFN-1 and TNF-α) were activated by CiGadd45g. CiGadd45g and downstream genes were regulated by microRNA miR-429b. These results indicate that CiGadd45g plays an important immune role in the response to A. hydrophila infection in grass carp.",Nicole Le Douarin and the use of quail-chick chimeras to study the developmental fate of neural crest and hematopoietic cells.,https://www.ncbi.nlm.nih.gov/pubmed/31129272,Mechanisms of development,2019 05 26,"The quail-chick chimera marking system, devised in 1969, gave a new impetus to the analysis of cell migrations and interactions in the developing nervous, immune and hematopoietic systems. The method is based on the observation that the constitutive heterochromatin in all embryonic and adult cells of the quail is condensed in one large mass in the centre of the nucleus and is associated with the nucleolus, making this organelle strongly stained with the Feulgen-Rossenbeck reaction. The association of cells or rudiments from two avian species, advocated as a means to identify cells that migrate during embryogenesis, was rapidly recognized in this context as a useful tool for the study of many developmental biology problems. This article summarizes the fundamental contribution of Nicole Le Douarin to the discovery and the application of this technique over the last 40 years.",Heart Failure with Mid-Range Ejection Fraction in Patients Admitted for Acute Decompensation: A Report from the Japanese Multicenter Registry.,https://www.ncbi.nlm.nih.gov/pubmed/31129270,Journal of cardiac failure,2019 05 26,"Patients having heart failure with mid-range ejection fraction (HFmrEF: 40%≤EF<50%) are increasingly being considered a new subset of the heart-failure population. Despite recent advances in heart-failure treatment strategies, the prognosis of these patients has not improved substantially over time. In addition, the significance of this new phenotype in hospitalized patients with acute decompensated heart failure (ADHF), another population whose prognosis has not improved, also remains poorly understood. This study aimed to describe the clinical characteristics, prognosis, and treatment responses of patients with HFmrEF hospitalized for ADHF.",SWATH-MS quantitative proteomic investigation of intrauterine growth restriction in a porcine model reveals sex differences in hippocampus development.,https://www.ncbi.nlm.nih.gov/pubmed/31129268,Journal of proteomics,2019 06 15,"Intrauterine growth restriction (IUGR) is characterized by reduced growth and weight of the foetus, mainly due to the lack of nutrients and oxygen. Animals affected by IUGR show changes in specific brain areas and several neuronal processes. Female offspring affected by IUGR show increased survival and development compared to males. The objective of this study was to analyse changes in the hippocampus proteome in male and female piglets affected by IUGR. Seven pregnant Iberian sows were fed from Day 35 of pregnancy onwards at 50% of their requirements. At Day 100 of pregnancy, foetuses were obtained and classified by sex and weight, as mild IUGR (Normal Body Weight) versus severe IUGR (Low Body Weight). Hippocampi were dissected and the proteomes analysed by SWATH-MS DIA. In this study, 1497 proteins were identified of which 260 were quantitatively analysed. All differential proteins were more abundant in females versus males and were involved in protein synthesis, neuronal development, metabolism, antiapoptotic signalling and vesicular transport. Our findings support that female foetuses tolerate nutrient limitation better than males, especially under mild IUGR. Under severe IUGR, females still seems to maintain normal lipid metabolism and antiapoptotic signalling, which may be related to the increased female survival. SIGNIFICANCE: In the last years, proteomics have been used to evidence differences related to sex in non-reproductive organs. Intrauterine Growth Restriction (IUGR) can affect female and male offspring differently. Female offspring has stronger protective strategies compared to males, enhancing growth and postnatal survival. Most studies regarding this issue have focused on metabolic organs (i.e. liver). However, the predominance of neurodevelopmental disorders in males suggests that the central nervous system in female offspring adapt better to nutritional stress conditions than that of males. Based on the differential protein expression in hippocampal samples, our work demonstrates that female foetuses indeed adapt better to IUGR than males, especially under mild IUGR conditions. In severe IUGR conditions, differences between males and females were not so evident, but even in this case, the remaining differences suggest increased survival in females than in males.",Proteomic fingerprinting for the fast and accurate identification of species in the Polyporoid and Hymenochaetoid fungi clades.,https://www.ncbi.nlm.nih.gov/pubmed/31129267,Journal of proteomics,2019 06 16,"Basidiomycotan fungi play significant roles in the biogeochemical cycle of carbon as wood decomposers and are used in the food industry for mushroom production and in biotechnology for the production of diverse bioactive compounds and bioremediation. The correct identification of basidiomycotan isolates is crucial for understanding their biology and being able to expand their applications. Currently, the identification of these organisms is performed by analyzing morphological and genomic characteristics, primarily those based on DNA biomarkers. Despite their efficiency, such methods require considerable expertise and are both time-consuming and error-prone (multistep workflow). Matrix-assisted laser desorption/ionization time-of-flight mass spectrometry (MALDI-TOF MS) has emerged in the last decade as an accurate, fast, and powerful alternative for the identification of microorganisms. MALDI-TOF MS has been widely applied for the identification and taxonomical characterization of both bacteria and ascomycotan fungi from clinical origins. However, species of Basidiomycota have been poorly evaluated using this method. In the present study, we assessed the performance of MALDI-TOF MS using basidiomycotan isolates of two distinct taxonomical families: Polyporaceae and Hymenochaetaceae. Using a simple protocol, which eliminates the protein extraction step, we obtained high-quality mass spectra data and demonstrated that this method is efficient for the discrimination of isolates at the species level. SIGNIFICANCE: In this study, the MALDI-TOF mass spectrometry was employed to test its accuracy on the recognition of fungal species with high biotechnological and environmental interest. Using a simple and fast protocol, we obtained high-quality mass-spectra (protein fingerprinting) and proved that MALDI-TOF MS is sufficiently robust to the identification at species level and to evaluate the relationships among the isolates of the polyporoid and hymenochaetoid clades (Basidiomycota).",iTRAQ-based proteomic analysis to identify molecular mechanisms of the selenium deficiency response in the Przewalski's gazelle.,https://www.ncbi.nlm.nih.gov/pubmed/31129266,Journal of proteomics,2019 06 16,"The Przewalski's gazelle shows long-term survival in a selenium (Se)-deficient environment, but fails to exhibit obvious pathological manifestations. To reveal proteomic changes in the Przewalski's gazelle in response to Se-deficiency, twenty Przewalski's gazelle were randomly divided into control group and Se-deficient group. After induction of Se-deficiency animal model, blood samples were collected from eight animals. An isobaric tag for relative and absolute quantitation (iTRAQ)-liquid chromatography-tandem mass spectrometry (LC-MS/MS) proteomics approach was employed to explore blood protein alterations and potential mechanisms of the response to Se-deficiency challenge. Se deficiency contributed to a remarkable change in blood Se levels and routine blood indexes. In proteomic analyses, 130 proteins were differentially accumulated in the Se-deficient and control groups. The differentially expressed proteins were annotated mainly as single-organism process, extracellular region, or binding, respectively, and they were highly enriched in the coagulation and complement cascades. Protein-protein interaction analysis showed several important nodal proteins involved in the regulation of binding, cellular biochemical processes, and signal transduction pathways. To our knowledge, this study is the first to comprehensively analyze blood protein changes in the Przewalski's gazelle under Se-deficient conditions, which reveal that this species has developed physiological mechanisms of adaptation in response to Se-deficiency stress. SIGNIFICANCE: The present study is the first to comprehensively analyze alterations in the protein profiles induced by Se deficiency in the blood of the Przewalski's gazelle, showing that Se-deficiency contributed to a significant reduction in blood Se levels and marked changes in blood parameters, which will likely contribute to a better understanding of the molecular mechanisms of the changes in protein abundance in the Przewalski's gazelle in response to Se-deficiency stress.","Targeting kinases in Parkinson's disease: A mechanism shared by LRRK2, neurotrophins, exenatide, urate, nilotinib and lithium.",https://www.ncbi.nlm.nih.gov/pubmed/31129265,Journal of the neurological sciences,2019 06 16,"Several kinases have been implicated in the pathogenesis of Parkinson's disease (PD), most notably leucine-rich repeat kinase 2 (LRRK2), as LRRK2 mutations are the most common genetic cause of a late-onset parkinsonism that is clinically indistinguishable from sporadic PD. More recently, several other kinases have emerged as promising disease-modifying targets in PD based on both preclinical studies and clinical reports on exenatide, the urate precursor inosine, nilotinib and lithium use in PD patients. These kinases include protein kinase B (Akt), glycogen synthase kinases-3β and -3α (GSK-3β and GSK-3α), c-Abelson kinase (c-Abl) and cyclin-dependent kinase 5 (cdk5). Activities of each of these kinases are involved either directly or indirectly in phosphorylating tau or increasing α-synuclein levels, intracellular proteins whose toxic oligomeric forms are strongly implicated in the pathogenesis of PD. GSK-3β, GSK-3α and cdk5 are the principle kinases involved in phosphorylating tau at sites critical for the formation of tau oligomers. Exenatide analogues, urate, nilotinib and lithium have been shown to affect one or more of the above kinases, actions that can decrease the formation and increase the clearance of intraneuronal phosphorylated tau and α-synuclein. Here we review the current preclinical and clinical evidence supporting kinase-targeting agents as potential disease-modifying therapies for PD patients enriched with these therapeutic targets and incorporate LRRK2 physiology into this novel model."

Angiotensin II and aldosterone are the two most powerful biologically active products of the RAAS, inducing all of the classical actions of the RAAS including vasoconstriction, sodium retention, tissue remodeling and pro-inflammatory and pro-fibrotic effects. In recent years, new components of the RAAS have been discovered beyond the classical pathway that have led to the identification of depressor or so-called protective RAAS pathways and the development of novel therapies targeting this system. Moreover, dual inhibitors which block the RAAS and other systems involved in the regulation of blood pressure or targeting upstream of angiotensin II by selectively deleting liver-derived angiotensinogen, the precursor to all angiotensins, may provide superior treatment for cardiovascular and renal diseases and revolutionize RAAS-targeting therapy.",Pigment epithelium-derived factor peptide reverses mouse age-related meibomian gland atrophy.,https://www.ncbi.nlm.nih.gov/pubmed/31129251,Experimental eye research,2019 05 26,"Age-related meibomian gland (MG) atrophy, characterized by decreased meibocyte proliferation, is one of the causes of meibomian gland dysfunction (MGD), which leads to dry eye disease. Currently, there is no available treatment effectively preventing or reversing the decreased cell proliferation and acinar tissue atrophy. In this study, we investigated the therapeutic effects of a pigment epithelium-derived factor (PEDF) peptide in treating this condition. We found abundant expression of PEDF in the nucleus of acinar basal cells, but not in mature meibocytes, and that the expression levels were significantly decreased in the aged mice. We next treated the aged mice (15-month-old) with atrophic MGs using a synthetic PEDF-derived peptide 29-mer (residues 93-121). We found that 29-mer effectively stimulated acinar basal cell proliferation and the following mature meibocyte proliferation in the atrophied MGs. In addition, the treatment increased ΔNp63 and Lrig1 expression in acinar basal cells. Finally, the aged mice receiving the treatment showed MG growth and improved tear break-up time. In conclusion, the 29-mer treatment is effective in promoting MG acinar basal cell proliferation and enlarging the acinar size of MG, as well as improving MG function in aged mice, suggesting a therapeutic potential of the PEDF-derived short peptide in ameliorating age-related MGD.",Expanded phenotypic spectrum of retinopathies associated with autosomal recessive and dominant mutations in PROM1.,https://www.ncbi.nlm.nih.gov/pubmed/31129250,American journal of ophthalmology,2019 05 26,To describe the genetic and phenotypic characteristics of a cohort of patients with PROM1 variants.,Overexpression of RACK1 enhanced the replication of porcine reproductive and respiratory syndrome virus in Marc-145 cells and promoted the NF-κB activation via upregulating the expression and phosphorylation of TRAF2.,https://www.ncbi.nlm.nih.gov/pubmed/31129249,Gene,2019 06 15,"Porcine reproductive and respiratory syndrome virus (PRRSV) is the causative pathogen for porcine reproductive and respiratory syndrome (PRRS), which lead to huge loss to porcine industry. RACK1 (receptor of activated protein C kinase 1) was first identified as a receptor for protein kinase C. Mounting evidence demonstrated that RACK1 played diverse roles in NF-κB activation and virus infections. We previously reported that siRNA knockdown of RACK1 inhibited PRRSV replication in Marc-145 cells, abrogated NF-κB activation induced by PRRSV infection and reduced the viral titer. Here we established a Marc-145 cell line which could stably overexpress RACK1 to consolidate our findings. Based on the data from RT-qPCR, western blot, immunofluorescence staining, cytopathic effects and viral titer analysis, we concluded that overexpression of RACK1 could enhance the replication of PRRSV in Marc-145 cells and promote the NF-κB activation via upregulating TRAF2 expression and its phosphorylation. Marc-145 cells overexpressing RACK1exhibited severe cytopathic effects post infection with PRRSV and elevated the viral titer. Taken together, RACK1 plays an essential role for PRRSV replication in Marc-145 cells and NF-κB activation. The results presented here shed more light on the understanding of the molecular mechanisms underlying PRRSV infection and its subsequent NF-κB activation. Therefore, we anticipate RACK1 as a promising target for PRRS control.",Novel recessive PDZD7 biallelic mutations associated with hereditary hearing loss in a Chinese pedigree.,https://www.ncbi.nlm.nih.gov/pubmed/31129248,Gene,2019 06 15,"Autosomal recessive non-syndromic hearing loss (ARNSHL) is a highly heterogeneous genetic disease.

However, the roles and mechanisms of several miRNAs in melanoma remain poorly understood. In our study, we showed that miR-10b was significantly up-regulated in melanoma tissues and cell lines, and was associated with overall survival of melanoma patients. Inhibition of miR-10b dramatically suppressed melanoma cell proliferation, migration and invasion in vitro and inhibited tumor growth in vivo. Moreover, we defined ITCH as a direct and functional downstream target of miR-10b, and showed that there was an inverse correlation between the expression of ITCH and miR-10b on melanoma tissues. Down-regulation of ITCH partially attenuated the inhibitory effects of miR-10b inhibition on melanoma cell proliferation, migration and invasion. Furthermore，we found that miR-10b exerted its effects on melanoma by regulating the Wnt/β-catenin pathway. Taken together, our results demonstrated that miR-10b was an important epigenetic modifier, promoting melanoma progression through regulating ITCH/Wnt/β-catenin pathway.

Furthermore, indirect utilization of solar energy increases both cost and energy loss. Here, we demonstrate a new humidity pumping concept based on multilayer moisture permeable panels. Such panels, with a simple structure, may allow the penetration of moisture from indoor (adsorption) to outdoor (desorption) with little heat loss. One-sun illumination is introduced as the direct energy source. A proof-of-concept prototype is designed and established, successfully dehumidifying indoor air with the best dehumidification rate of 33.8 g⋅m-2⋅h-1.

We obtained two putative tumor necrosis factor receptor-associated factor 6 (TRAF6)-binding motifs (TBMs) within the protease domain of the viral nonstructural 3 (NS3) protein. Here, we show that TBFV NS3 interacted with TRAF6 during infection and that TRAF6 supports TBFV replication. The proviral role of TRAF6 was not seen with mosquito-borne flaviviruses, consistent with the lack of conserved TBMs. Mutation of the second TBM within NS3 disrupted TRAF6 binding, coincident with reduced abundance of mature, autocatalytically derived form of the NS3 protease and significant virus attenuation in vitro.

The enzyme can utilize effectively for pulping, delignification of pulps as alone or in the combination with other bleaching enzymes. Laccase has been evaluated for the biografting of pulp fibers, decolorize and stabilize the effluent of the paper mills, biotransformation of high molecular weight (HMW) lignins to lower molecular weight (LMW) aromatic compounds. Further this enzyme has the huge possibilities to apply for deinking of old newsprint (ONP) and pitch removal from varieties of the different pulps. There is no doubt on versatility mode of action of laccases in paper industry, but still there is limited commercialization of this enzyme has been possible, because of laccases has the less redox potential (E0) and needs mediators for the oxidation of non phenolic substrates, production of enzyme is cost intensive at large scale.

Due to abundant anthocyanin content, MPE showed pH-sensitive property with solution color changed from red to purple and final gray when pH value increased from 2 to 13. When MPE was incorporated into κ-carrageenan film, the composite films presented blue color. Notably, the incorporation of 2 and 4 wt% of MPE could significantly increase the thickness, tensile strength, thermal stability, antioxidant activity and pH-sensitive property of κ-carrageenan film. However, the moisture content, water vapor permeability, UV-vis light transmittance and elongation at break were greatly reduced when 2 and 4 wt% of MPE were incorporated. In addition, κ-carrageenan-MPE films exhibited heterogeneous and rougher surfaces as compared with κ-carrageenan film. The existence of intermolecular interactions between MPE and κ-carrageenan matrix was confirmed by infrared spectroscopy and X-ray diffraction. When applied to monitor the freshness of milk, κ-carrageenan-MPE films showed evident color changes as milk deteriorated after storage at 40 °C for 8 h. Our results suggested that κ-carrageenan-MPE films could be used as novel active and intelligent food packaging materials.",'Fragmentation' of NMJs: a sign of degeneration or regeneration? A long journey with many junctions.,https://www.ncbi.nlm.nih.gov/pubmed/31129203,Neuroscience,2019 06 10,"Mammalian neuromuscular junctions (NMJs) often consist of curved bands of synaptic contact, about 3-6 μm wide, which resemble pretzels. This contrasts with the NMJs of most animal species which consist of a cluster of separate synaptic spots, each of which is also about 3-6 μm across. In a number of situations, including a variety of disease states as well as normal ageing, mammalian NMJs acquire a more 'fragmented' appearance that resembles somewhat that of other species. This 'fragmentation' of the NMJ has sometimes been interpreted as a 'disintegration' or 'degeneration', with the suggestion that it might be associated with impaired neuromuscular transmission. An alternative view is that NMJ fragmentation is the outcome of a normal process by which the NMJ is maintained in an effective state. In this highly personal commentary, I cite a number of examples of this and point out that although the 'pretzel' form arises during normal development as a result of the sculpting of an immature synaptic 'plaque', in virtually all situations where new synaptic contact is established in adult mammals this occurs by the addition of new synaptic 'spots' rather than by the extension, or neoformation, of 'pretzels'. Further, where appropriate studies have been performed, no evidence of a correlation between the degree of fragmentation and the efficacy of transmission has emerged. It may therefore be more appropriate to consider NMJ 'fragmentation' as a form of regeneration, rather than of degeneration.",Pseudoginsenoside-F11 Protects against Transient Cerebral Ischemia Injury in Rats Involving Repressing Calcium Overload.,https://www.ncbi.nlm.nih.gov/pubmed/31129202,Neuroscience,2019 06 15,"Calcium overload has been reported to trigger neuronal death following stroke. Pseudoginsenoside-F11 (PF11), an ocotillol-type ginsenoside with various neuroprotective activities, has displayed therapeutic efficacy against permanent ischemic stroke. The present study examined the protective potential of PF11 in rats subjected to 2-h transient middle cerebral artery occlusion (tMCAO) and in cultured primary cortical neuron (PCN) exposed to oxygen-glucose deprivation/reoxygenation (OGD/R). Single intravenous administration of PF11 (12 mg/kg) significantly reduced infarct volume, brain edema, neurological deficit and cortex neuron loss at 24 h after reperfusion. Immunoblotting and immunofluorescence demonstrated that PF11 inhibited the over activation of μ-Calpain and the reduction of calcium calmodulin kinase II-α, reduced the degradation of sarcoplasmic/endoplasmic reticulum ATPase-2 and alleviated endoplasmic reticulum stress (ERS) in tMCAO rats. What's more, rats treated with PF11 (12 mg/kg) intravenously immediately after reperfusion, and then intraperitoneally every 24 h for 14 days exhibited lessened cortex neuron loss, reduced mortality and improved performances of rotarod, grip strength and gait patterns at 1, 4, 7, and 14 days after tMCAO. Furthermore, in vitro investigations showed PF11 increased cell viability, reduced neurites decline, restored ATP level and decreased calcium content in cultured PCN under OGD/R. Moreover, PF11 alleviated ERS, reversed the diminished levels of NMDA-2B subunit, postsynaptic density protein 95 and neuronal nitric oxide synthase both in vivo and in vitro. Our study indicates that PF11 produced neuroprotection and improved long-term outcomes while repressing calcium overload in model of transient focal ischemia, suggesting that PF11 might be a considerable candidate for stroke treatment.",The Protective Effect of Aromatase on NSC-34 Cells with Stably Expressed hSOD1-G93A.,https://www.ncbi.nlm.nih.gov/pubmed/31129201,Neuroscience,2019 06 15,"As an adult-onset neurodegenerative disease, amyotrophic lateral sclerosis (ALS) results in progressive muscular atrophy and paralysis. However, the mechanism of ALS has not yet been elucidated, and no cure has been found. Research has revealed that a mutation of the Cu/Zn superoxide dismutase (SOD1) gene is linked to familial ALS and that potential sex discrepancies exist in ALS incidence. Here, NSC-34 cells stably expressing hSOD1-G93A (hSOD1-G93A cells) were transiently transfected with Cyp19a1 mouse open reading frame (ORF) cDNA or a short hairpin RNA (ShRNA) plasmid. Overexpression of aromatase resulting from Cyp19a1 mouse ORF cDNA plasmid transfection enhanced cell proliferation and reduced cell damage in hSOD1-G93A cells. This protective effect occurred through anti-apoptotic pathways related to estrogen receptor-alpha (ER-α) activation. Meanwhile, knockdown of aromatase with Cyp19a1 ShRNA plasmid transfection reduced cell proliferation, increased cell damage, promoted apoptosis, and decreased ER-α expression in hSOD1-G93A cells, and the induced apoptotic effects could be reversed by estradiol (E2). In brief, the results of our study suggest that aromatase plays a neuroprotective role against apoptosis in hSOD1-G93A cells by activating ER-α and may become a new intervention target for ALS treatment.","FTY720 Improves Behavior, Increases Brain Derived Neurotrophic Factor Levels and Reduces α-Synuclein Pathology in Parkinsonian GM2+/- Mice.",https://www.ncbi.nlm.nih.gov/pubmed/31129200,Neuroscience,2019 06 15,"Parkinson's disease (PD) is a progressive aging disorder that affects millions worldwide, thus, disease-modifying-therapies are urgently needed. PD pathology includes α-synuclein (aSyn) accumulation as synucleinopathy. Loss of GM1 gangliosides occurs in PD brain, which is modeled in GM2 synthase transgenic mice. GM2+/- mice have low, not absent GM1 and develop age-onset motor deficits, making them an excellent PD drug testing model. FTY720 (fingolimod) reduces synucleinopathy in A53T aSyn mice and motor dysfunction in 6-OHDA and rotenone PD models, but no one has tested FTY720 in mice that develop age-onset PD-like motor problems. We confirmed that GM2+/-mice had equivalent rotarod, hindlimb reflexes, and adhesive removal functions at 9 mo. From 11 mo, GM2+/- mice received oral FTY720 or vehicle 3x/week to 16 mo. As bladder problems occur in PD, we also assessed GM2+/- bladder function. This allowed us to demonstrate improved motor and bladder function in GM2+/- mice treated with FTY720. By immunoblot, FTY720 reduced levels of proNGF, a biomarker of bladder dysfunction. In humans with PD, arm swing becomes abnormal, and brachial plexus modulates arm swing. Ultrastructure of brachial plexus in wild type and GM2 transgenic mice confirmed abnormal myelination and axons in GM2 transgenics. FTY720 treated GM2+/- brachial plexus sustained myelin associated protein levels and reduced aggregated aSyn and PSer129 aSyn levels. FTY720 increases brain derived neurotrophic factor (BDNF) and we noted increased BDNF in GM2+/- brachial plexus and cerebellum, which contribute to rotarod performance. These findings provide further support for testing low dose FTY720 in patients with PD.",Asymmetrical response of aminopeptidase A in the medial prefrontal cortex and striatum of 6-OHDA-unilaterally-lesioned Wistar Kyoto and spontaneously hypertensive rats.,https://www.ncbi.nlm.nih.gov/pubmed/31129199,"Pharmacology, biochemistry, and behavior",2019 06 07,"Aminopeptidase A is responsible for the hydrolysis of angiotensin II and cholecystokinin. By measuring its activity we obtain a reflection of the functional status of its endogenous substrates. Dopamine coexists with these neuropeptides in striatum and prefrontal cortex. If the content of any of them is altered, the others and the functions they are involved in would also be affected. Wistar Kyoto (WKY) and spontaneously hypertensive rats (SHR) are rat models with different motor behavior and mood. We hypothesized that aminopeptidase A activity could be modified in WKY or SHR affecting the brain dopamine. The results may provide new insights for the understanding of dopamine-related disorders such as schizophrenia, depression or Parkinson's disease. To analyze the influence of unilateral depletions of dopamine on the intra- and inter-hemispheric behavior of aminopeptidase A in striatum and prefrontal cortex of WKY and SHR, aminopeptidase A activity was measured fluorometrically, using an arylamide derivative as substrate, in the left and right sides of striatum and prefrontal cortex of WKY and SHR treated with saline (control groups) or following left or right intrastriatal injections of 6-hydroxydopamine (lesioned groups). Differential asymmetrical intra- and inter-hemispheric behaviors of aminopeptidase A were observed, depending on the lesioned hemisphere, the region and the strain analyzed. Results also demonstrated differential intra and inter-hemispheric correlations between striatum and prefrontal cortex and between both regions and motor behavior depending on the side of lesion. The changes mostly involved the left hemisphere. The functions in which the aminopeptidase A activity is involved could be modified depending on whether the dopamine depletion occurs on the left or right hemisphere.",A comparison of body condition of the yellowstriped butterfish Labracoglossa argenteiventris in relation to parasitism by the cymothoid isopod Ceratothoa arimae.,https://www.ncbi.nlm.nih.gov/pubmed/31129198,Parasitology international,2019 06 08,"Isopods of the genus Ceratothoa (Cymothoidae) are one of the largest invertebrates parasitic on a variety of fishes, which include commercially important species. Nevertheless, the parasitic effects on fish body condition have been studied only in a few Ceratothoa species, particularly those living in the Mediterranean and Australian waters. Findings from these previous studies suggest the hypothesis that effects of parasitism by Ceratothoa species are benign on native host condition in the wild. In this study, to test this hypothesis on another Ceratothoa-fish relationship in different region, we examined the effects of Ceratothoa arimae on the body condition of the yellowstriped butterfish, Labracoglossa argenteiventris, a commercial fish important to local fisheries particularly in the remote islands of Tokyo, Japan. Ceratothoa arimae was found in 8 out of 23 fish examined (prevalence: 34.8%). Although infected and uninfected fish were similar in standard length, the body condition index (relative weight) of infected fish was significantly lower than that of uninfected fish. The observed weight of infected fish was an average of 89.2% of the expected weight. These results are inconsistent with the hypothesis and suggest that the potential effects of Ceratothoa parasites need to be considered carefully in fishery management plan of host fish.",Treatment of resistant visceral leishmaniasis with interferon gamma in combination with liposomal amphotericin B and allopurinol.,https://www.ncbi.nlm.nih.gov/pubmed/31129197,Parasitology international,2019 06 08,"This report describes the first case of visceral leishmaniasis (VL) resistant to pentavalent antimonials and also the first use of combinational therapy in Iran.

The L. vannamei fed 0.02% and 0.04% β-glucan gained more weight and showed higher activities of protease, amylase, superoxide dismutase, and glutathione peroxidase in the intestine than in the control (0% β-glucan). The L. vannamei fed 0.04% β-glucan had a higher condition factor than those fed the control diet. Amylase activity in the hepatopancreas of L. vannamei fed 0.02% β-glucan was higher than those fed the control diet. Dietary β-glucan supplement increased the mRNA expressions of Toll-like receptor, myostatin, immune deficiency or heat shock protein 70, but decreased the mRNA expressions of tumor necrosis factor-α and C-type lectin 3 in both hepatopancreas and intestine. The response of intestine microbiota in L. vannamei fed 0.04% β-glucan was further compared to the control. The 0.04% β-glucan supplement reduced richness and diversity of the intestinal microbial community as indicated by the low values of Chao1 estimator, ACE estimator, Simpson index and Shannon diversity index. Abundances of Bacillus, Chitinibacter, Geobacillus and Vibrio in the intestine increased, while Flavobacterium, Microbacterium and Mycobacterium decreased significantly in L. vannamei fed 0.04% β-glucan compared to the control. This study indicates that dietary β-glucan supplement at 0.02%-0.04% can significantly improve digestibility, antioxidant capacity and immunity in L. vannamei, and thus improve growth performance and survival at low salinity. These beneficial effects of β-glucan probably are related to the dominance of probiotics over potential pathogens in the intestine.","Elecsys® Total-Tau and Phospho-Tau (181P) CSF assays: Analytical performance of the novel, fully automated immunoassays for quantification of tau proteins in human cerebrospinal fluid.",https://www.ncbi.nlm.nih.gov/pubmed/31129184,Clinical biochemistry,2019 06 07,"Total tau (tTau) and phosphorylated 181P tau (pTau) are supportive diagnostic cerebrospinal fluid (CSF) biomarkers for Alzheimer's disease.

It is affecting human health regardless of their gender, age, eating habits, and ecological location. Many drugs and therapies are available for its cure still the need for effective targeted drugs and therapies are of paramount importance. In the recent past, Ca2+ signalling (including channels/transporters/pumps) are being studied as a plausible target for combating the cancer menace. Many evidence has shown that the intracellular Ca2+ homeostasis is altered in cancer cells and the remodelling is linked with tumor instigation, angiogenesis, progression, and metastasis. Focusing on these altered Ca2+ signalling tool kit for cancer treatment is a cross-cutting and emerging area of research. In addition, there are numerous phytomolecules which can be exploited as a potential Ca2+ (channels/transporters/ pumps) modulators in the context of targeting Ca2+ signalling in the cancer cell. In the present review, a list of plant-based potential Ca2+ (channel/transporters/pumps) modulators has been reported which could have application in the framework of repurposing the potential drugs to target Ca2+ signalling pathways in cancer cells.

Cytosolic PLA2α (cPLA2α) is constitutively expressed in most cells, whereas IIA secreted PLA2 (sPLA2-IIA) is induced during inflammation and is present at high levels in the synovial fluid of rheumatoid arthritis patients. In mice, both cPLA2α and sPLA2-IIA have been implicated in autoimmune arthritis; however, the respective contribution of these two enzymes to the pathogenesis and production of eicosanoids is unknown. We evaluated the respective role of cPLA2α and sPLA2-IIA with regard to arthritis and eicosanoid profile in an in vivo model of arthritis. While arthritis was most severe in mice expressing both enzymes, it was abolished when both cPLA2α and sPLA2-IIA were lacking. cPLA2α played a dominant role in the severity of arthritis, although sPLA2-IIA sufficed to significantly contribute to the disease. Several eicosanoids were modulated during the course of arthritis and numerous species involved sPLA2-IIA expression. This study confirms the critical role of PLA2s in arthritis and unveils the distinct contribution of cPLA2α and sPLA2-IIA to the eicosanoid profile in arthritis.","Mechanisms, Biomarkers and Targets for Therapy in Alcohol-associated Liver Injury: From Genetics to Nutrition: Summary of the ISBRA 2018 Symposium.",https://www.ncbi.nlm.nih.gov/pubmed/31129175,"Alcohol (Fayetteville, N.Y.)",2019 05 26,"The symposium ""Mechanisms, Biomarkers and Targets for Therapy in Alcohol-associated Liver Injury: From Genetics to Nutrition"" was held at the 19th Congress of International Society for Biomedical Research on Alcoholism on September 13th, 2018 in Kyoto, Japan.

Ecotoxicological studies have also been performed, exclusively on the adult stage. In the present study we investigated the mortality and biochemical (oxidative stress and neurotoxicity) responses of P. marmoratus larvae exposure to environmental relevant concentration of copper. Results showed dose-dependent responses in terms of larval mortality, with a calculated LC50 value of 0.5 mg/L of Cu2+. The LC50 concentration was used as the starting point for subsequent biochemical response evaluation. Results also demonstrated dose-dependent activation of antioxidant systems assuming a compensatory antioxidant activity to prevent higher cellular damage when larvae were exposed to the highest concentrations of copper. Moreover, a significant enhancement of neurotransmitter activities was observed, assuming a possible direct interaction of copper with the enzymes or an increase of free copper ion aliquot into the cells."

However, cases of recurrent neurotoxic envenoming after antivenom treatment are rarely reported. We present three patients who were envenomed by a cobra (Naja kaouthia or N. siamensis) and experienced recurrent neurotoxic envenomation after they initially responded to antivenom treatments. These three patients, aged 13, 35 and 65 years, were consulted to the Ramathibodi Poison Centre. All were bitten by cobra snakes and developed neurotoxic signs and symptoms including ptosis, muscle weakness, and respiratory failure. All were treated with, and responded to, Fragment Affinity-Purified Secondary Antibody [F(ab')2] antivenom. Two cases underwent debridement and fasciotomy. One case required extensive wound dressing with bleb aspiration, in addition to usual wound care. Approximately 6-14 hours after these procedures, all three patients developed recurrent signs and symptoms of neurotoxicity. All received second doses of antivenom, after which their symptoms improved, and all were ultimately discharged. Each of these cases exhibited recurrent systemic envenomation that resulted from cobra bites after they exhibited antivenom responses. We believe that non-neutralized venom that remained at the bite site, was released, and re-entered the circulation after the wound was manipulated or the patient underwent surgery may explain these instances of recurrent envenomation. Future investigations should examine other potential mechanisms of recurrent envenomation, especially in patients without histories of aggressive wound manipulation. If neurological effects recur, prompt re-treatment with antivenom should be considered.",Persistent pit viper envenomation in three dogs.,https://www.ncbi.nlm.nih.gov/pubmed/31129161,Toxicon : official journal of the International Society on Toxinology,2019 06 10,"North Central Florida is the home to several venomous snakes. The most clinically significant pit vipers include the Eastern Diamondback Rattlesnake, the Water Moccasin, and less commonly the Timber Rattlesnake. Many of the dogs and cats that become envenomated by these particular snakes have moderate to severe clinical signs requiring the use of antivenom in doses that can range from 1 to 20 vials with the average case requiring two vials. Oftentimes, the pet owners' financial limitations restrict the amount of antivenom that can be administered initially to severely envenomed cases. Most of these patients will become clinically stable after the first 48 hours of treatment, but there are rare instances where some patients will follow this same initial course, and then revert back to the initial signs of envenomation associated with delayed absorption of redistributed venom from other tissue sites in addition to the bite site. This report describes three dogs that showed signs of persistent and/or recurrent envenomation requiring additional doses of antivenom.",Phylogeny and toxicological assessments of two Porthidium lansbergii lansbergii morphotypes from the caribbean region of Colombia.,https://www.ncbi.nlm.nih.gov/pubmed/31129160,Toxicon : official journal of the International Society on Toxinology,2019 06 10,"After a snakebite accident, species identification is of vital importance. However, the existence of intraspecific differences in the body coloration patterns of venomous snakes can generate confusion and delay a convenient and effective treatment. This is the situation for Porthidium lansbergii lansbergii from Colombia, for which two distinctive color morphs occur, and the relationship of these morphs with venom toxicity is unknown. Therefore, venom samples from specimens of these two morphs were collected from the Colombian Caribbean region, and their protein profiles compared. Likewise, their venom functional activities were evaluated in vitro and in vivo in BALB/C mice. Additionally, using sequences of the mitochondrial cytochrome b (Cyt-b) gene, the relationship between these Colombian P. lansbergii lansbergii morphotypes was investigated, and their phylogenetic positions were determined for the first time using Bayesian inference. Despite the noticeable coloration divergence between the individuals analyzed, similar protein profiles of their venoms were observed. Additionally, neither their lethality nor biochemical activities were notably different. In general, both venoms were highly proteolytic, lacked a coagulant effect in vitro, and extended the clotting time due to the action of venom components, such as disintegrins and proteases, that induce defibrination. These results agreed with the result of our phylogenetic analysis, suggesting that the two chromatic morphs do not represent isolated populations. The phylogenetic analyses also supported the currently recognized P. lansbergii lansbergii subspecies as a monophyletic complex. In conclusion, the results of this investigation suggest similar clinical manifestations regardless of body coloration after a P. lansbergii lansbergii envenomation, and pools can therefore be used for antivenom development, medical treatments, and further research efforts.","Sub-lethal effects of the triazole fungicide propiconazole on zebrafish (Danio rerio) development, oxidative respiration, and larval locomotor activity.",https://www.ncbi.nlm.nih.gov/pubmed/31129159,Neurotoxicology and teratology,2019 06 09,"Propiconazole is a triazole fungicide used in agriculture. Via run-off, it can enter the aquatic environment, and can adversely affect organisms. However, data are scarce on how propiconazole may affect early developmental life stages of fish. The objectives of this study were to evaluate the potential sub-lethal effects of propiconazole during zebrafish development. Wildtype zebrafish (ABTu strain) embryos and larvae were exposed to propiconazole (0.1-100 μM) for up to 150 hours post fertilization (hpf) depending upon the endpoint measured. Propiconazole decreased survival and induced hypopigmentation in fish at 100 μM compared to the water and solvent controls. Pericardial edema was also noted in embryos and larvae (beginning at 2-3 dpf) exposed to 100 μM propiconazole. To visualize the effects of propiconazole on the circulatory system in more detail, we exposed transgenic zebrafish (globin-LCR:eGFP) to the fungicide. Hematopoietic changes were observed within 48 h of exposure to 100 μM, and localization of blood cells in the cardic region became diffuse, indicating pooling of blood in the pericardial region. We measured oxidative respiration in embryos as sufficient ATP is needed for development. Exposure to 100 μM propiconazole (~6-30 hpf) reduced basal respiration (~50%), oligomycin-induced ATP linked respiration (~70%), proton leak (~30%), and non-mitochondrial respiration (~50%), indicating compromised mitochondrial bioenergetics. A Visual Motor Response (VMR) test was used to measure dark photokinesis behavior in larval fish exposed to propiconazole for a 6-day period. Larval fish exposed to the highest concentration in the assay (10 μM) showed evidence of hypoactivity. This study demonstrates that propiconazole can induce hypopigmentation in zebrafish, disrupt mitochondrial bioenergetics, and can alter locomotor activity. However, these sub-lethal responses were observed at concentrations above what is typically detected in the environment.",The selective TRPV4 channel antagonist HC-067047 attenuates mechanical allodynia in diabetic mice.,https://www.ncbi.nlm.nih.gov/pubmed/31129158,European journal of pharmacology,2019 06 16,"Painful diabetic neuropathy (PDN) is a serious symptom that compromises quality of life and remains without effective pharmacological treatment. The transient receptor vanilloid 4 (TRPV4) is a cation-permeable channel implicated in sensory transduction and pain signalling. Therefore, drugs that act on TRPV4 may have therapeutic applications to treat PDN. In the present work, we assessed the effect of the selective TRPV4 channel antagonist HC-067047 on painful neuropathy associated with streptozotocin (STZ)-induced diabetes in mice. STZ-treated animals presented both mechanical and cold allodynia at 6 weeks after diabetes induction. Notably, HC-067047 (1 mg/kg, s.c.) given daily between 2 and 6 weeks after diabetes induction significantly prevented the development of mechanical allodynia. Additionally, both single and repeated treatments with HC-067047 (10 mg/kg, s.c.) significantly reverted established mechanical allodynia induced by STZ. However, HC-067047 was not capable of affecting either thermal cold allodynia or hyperglycemia. Similarly, HC-067047 treatments showed no effect on body weight, temperature, locomotor activity or motor coordination of control mice. Immunohistochemistry assay showed that TRPV4 expression was not different in sciatic nerve, dorsal root ganglia (DRG) or hind paw plantar skin from diabetic and non-diabetic mice, suggesting that HC-067047 acts on constitutive receptors to inhibit mechanical allodynia. Taken together, the data generated in the present study show the potential relevance of using TRPV4 antagonists to treat painful neuropathy associated with diabetes.","KHG21834 attenuates glutamate-induced mitochondrial damage, apoptosis, and NLRP3 inflammasome activation in SH-SY5Y human neuroblastoma cells.",https://www.ncbi.nlm.nih.gov/pubmed/31129157,European journal of pharmacology,2019 06 16,"New compounds were screened to develop effective drugs against glutamate-induced toxicity. The present study assessed the effects of the novel thiazole derivative KHG21834 against glutamate-induced toxicity in human neuroblastoma SH-SY5Y cell cultures. Treatment of SH-SY5Y cells with KHG21834 significantly protected cells against glutamate-induced toxicity in a dose-dependent manner, with an optimum concentration of 50 μM. KHG21834 protected SH-SY5Y cells against glutamate toxicity by suppressing glutamate-induced oxidative stress by 50%. KHG21834 also attenuated glutamate-induced mitochondrial membrane potential, ATP level reductions, and intracellular Ca2+ influx. Furthermore, KHG21834 efficiently reduced glutamate-induced ER stress and NLRP3 inflammasome activation (59% and 65% of glutamate group, respectively). In addition, KHG21834 effectively attenuated glutamate-induced levels of Bax, Bcl-2, cleaved caspase-3, p-p38, p-JNK proteins, and TUNEL positive cells. To our knowledge, this is the first study showing that KHG21834 can effectively protect SH-SY5Y cells against glutamate toxicity, suggesting that this compound may be a valuable therapeutic agent for the treatment of glutamate toxicity.",Therapeutic and antiproteinuric effects of salvianolic acid A in combined with low-dose prednisone in minimal change disease rats: Involvement of PPARγ/Angptl4 and Nrf2/HO-1 pathways.,https://www.ncbi.nlm.nih.gov/pubmed/31129156,European journal of pharmacology,2019 05 26,"Danshen (Salvia miltiorrhiza) and prednisone are extensively applied in the treatment of kidney disease. Salvianolic acid A (SAA), the major biologically active component of Danshen, which has various biological effects. Our previous findings have demonstrated the renoprotective effect of SAA in various kidney disease rodent models. Here, we explore the therapeutic potential and possible mechanisms of SAA in combination with low-dose prednisone in adriamycin (ADR)-induced minimal change disease (MCD) rat model and mouse podocyte injury cell model. SAA was injected via tail vein at 10 mg/kg/day and prednisone at 5 mg/kg/day via gavage. Each drug was administered daily alone or in combination for 3 weeks. Combination therapy showed significant therapeutic efficacy as manifested by relieved urinary proteins, improved blood biochemical indicators including serum total protein, albumin, triglyceride, cholesterol, the indices of renal function i.e. blood urea nitrogen and serum creatinine levels, and ameliorated pathological lesions. Particularly, co-administration showed a significant anti-proteinuria effect in MCD rats. Further studies suggested that co-administration effectively ameliorated the podocyte injury as indicated by the reduction of podocyte foot processes fusion, up-regulation of synaptopodin and down-regulation of desmin. These beneficial effects are accompanied by activation of the Nrf2/HO-1 and PPARγ/Angptl4 pathways in vivo, and the effect of SAA on PPARγ/Angptl4 is also demonstrated in vitro. These findings suggested that SAA exerted podocyte-protection against MCD injury through PPARγ/Angptl4 and Nrf2/HO-1 pathways, and combined with low-dose prednisone possessed a significant anti-proteinuria and therapeutic effects in MCD rats.",Molecular programs underlying differences in the expression of mood disorders in males and females.,https://www.ncbi.nlm.nih.gov/pubmed/31129154,Brain research,2019 06 11,"Major depressive disorder (MDD) is a sexually dimorphic disease.

This happened in response to increasing insight into impacts of climate on drinking-water and required adaptation to anticipated climate change. Literature was reviewed for published guidance and case examples, documenting how to consider climate in water safety planning to support future uptake. Climate-resilient water safety plans were piloted within a project in the water supplies of Addis Ababa and Adama, Ethiopia. Case examples have been published in four of six WHO regions with a focus on urban supplies. Integration of climate aspects focused mostly on the steps of establishing the team, system description, hazard analysis and risk assessment, improvement planning and development of management procedures. While the traditional framework focuses on drinking-water quality, considering climate change augments aspects of water quantity. Therefore, other factors affecting water quantity such as population development and demand of other sectors need to be considered as well. Local climate information and tools should be employed as a significant success factor for future uptake. Such information should be incorporated as it becomes available, and may - depending on the setting - be incrementally integrated into existing water safety plans or used to develop new ones.",Evaluation of mixture effects of endocrine active substances in wastewater using CALUX reporter-gene assays.,https://www.ncbi.nlm.nih.gov/pubmed/31129136,International journal of hygiene and environmental health,2019 06 01,"Endocrine active substances (EAS), which are commonly used in pharmaceuticals and personal care products, are released into surface water mainly through WWTP effluents and have been shown to cause adverse effects in aquatic organisms. In wastewater, a variety of EAS with different hormonal activities is present, which can lead to additive effects or mask an endocrine activity. To investigate hormonal combination effects, with a focus on estrogen and androgen-modulators, influent samples from municipal and hospital wastewater treatmenr plants were spiked with 17α-ethinylestradiol, toremifene, 17α-methyltestosterone and bicalutamide and analyzed using in vitro reporter gene CALUX assays. All wastewaters caused endocrine activities in human cells, which were modified by adding one or several endocrine active substances. As expected, estrogenic activity was reduced in presence of the anti-estrogenic toremifene and androgenic activity decreased with the anti-androgen bicalutamide. In general, substance addition caused a similar trend in altered endocrine activities; however, their intensities differed between the wastewaters. Our results indicate that masking effects, leading to a suppressed biological signal, are of significant importance in the assessment of complex water samples, and combination effects rather than single substances determine the final biological effect. This emphasizes the need of effect-based tools in the assessment of water samples.",Comparison of different label-free imaging high-throughput biosensing systems for aptamer binding measurements using thrombin aptamers.,https://www.ncbi.nlm.nih.gov/pubmed/31129134,Analytical biochemistry,2019 06 10,"To enable the analysis of several hundreds to thousands of interactions in parallel, high-throughput systems were developed. We used established thrombin aptamer assays to compare three such high-throughput imaging systems as well as analysis software and user influence. In addition to our own iRIf-system, we applied bscreen and IBIS-MX96. As non-imaging reference systems we used Octet-RED96, Biacore3000, and Monolith-NT.115. In this study we measured 1378 data points. Our results show that all systems are suitable for analyzing binding kinetics, but the kinetic constants as well as the ranking of the selected aptamers depend significantly on the applied system and user. We provide an insight into the signal generation principles, the systems and the results generated for thrombin aptamers. It should contribute to the awareness that binding constants cannot be determined as easily as other constants. Since many parameters like surface chemistry, biosensor type and buffer composition may change binding behavior, the experimenter should be aware that a system and assay dependent KD is determined. Frequently, certain conditions that are best suited for a given biosensing system cannot be transferred to other systems. Therefore, we strongly recommend using at least two different systems in parallel to achieve meaningful results.",Human plasma-derived butyrylcholinesterase is behaviorally safe and effective in cynomolgus macaques (Macaca fascicularis) challenged with soman.,https://www.ncbi.nlm.nih.gov/pubmed/31129133,Chemico-biological interactions,2019 06 16,"Organophosphorus compounds (OP) pose a significant threat. Administration of human butyrylcholinesterase (HuBChE) may reduce or prevent OP toxicity. Thus, we evaluated the safety and efficacy of HuBChE in monkeys using sensitive neurobehavioral tests while concurrently characterizing absorption and elimination in the presence and absence of high-dose soman exposure to predict time course and degree of protection. Eight young adult male cynomolgus macaques were trained on two distinct automated tests of neurobehavioral functioning. HuBChE purified under current Good Manufacturing Practices (CGMP) was injected intramuscularly at 13.1 mg/kg, producing an average peak plasma value (Cmax) of over 27 Units/ml. The apparent time to maximum concentration (Tmax) approximated 7 h, the elimination half-life approximated 102 h, and plasma levels returned to pre-administration (baseline) levels by 14 days. No behavioral disruptions following HuBChE administration were observed on either neurobehavioral test, even in monkeys injected 24 h later with an otherwise lethal dose of soman. Thus, HuBChE provided complete neurobehavioral protection from soman challenge. The present data replicate and extend previous results from our laboratory that had used a different route of administration (intravenous), a different species (rhesus macaque), and a different BChE product (non-CGMP material). The addition of two sensitive neurobehavioral tests coupled with the PK/PD results convincingly demonstrates the neurobehavioral safety of plasma-derived HuBChE at therapeutic levels. Protection against an otherwise-lethal dose of soman by a pre-exposure treatment dose that is devoid of side effects establishes a foundation for additional testing using other exposure routes and treatment times, other challenge agents/routes, or other classes of organophosphate scavengers.",Zolmitriptan attenuates hepatocellular carcinoma via activation of caspase mediated apoptosis.,https://www.ncbi.nlm.nih.gov/pubmed/31129132,Chemico-biological interactions,2019 06 16,"A preclinical study using DEN-induced HCC rat model was attempted to evaluate the antitumor potential of zolmitriptan (ZOL). The molecular insights were investigated using ELISA, qRT-PCR and Western blot techniques. The result confirmed that the HCC condition was developed in response to lower expressions of caspase 3 and 9 which, in turn, was due to the upstream regulation of iNOS, Bcl-xl and Bcl-2, and downstream regulation of eNOS, BAX, BAD and Cyt C. The treatment with ZOL caused the significant activation of caspase mediated apoptotic signals that could be responsible for its anti-HCC potential. Later, 1H NMR based serum metabolomics study confirmed that ZOL restored the perturbed metabolites associated with DEN-induced HCC. The antineoplastic potential of ZOL was found comparable or to some degree better than the marketed chemotherapeutics, 5-flurouracil.","Association of status of acetylcholinesterase and ACHE gene 3' UTR variants (rs17228602, rs17228616) with drug addiction vulnerability in pakistani population.",https://www.ncbi.nlm.nih.gov/pubmed/31129131,Chemico-biological interactions,2019 06 16,"Substance addiction is a chronic, relapsing mental disorder Characterized by compulsive drug seeking, and loss of control over drug intake and relapse after prolonged abstinence. Genetics has been shown to contribute towards an individual's vulnerability to addiction. Acetylecholine (ACh), a cholinergic neurotransmitter hydrolyzed by acetylcholinesterase (AChE), is an essential neurotransmitter and neuromodulator in central and peripheral nervous system and has regulatory influence on numerous neuronal functions including addiction. The present study was carried out to investigate the role of acetylcholinesterase (AChE) in addiction through measurement of enzyme activity and to find potential association of ACHE gene 3'UTR variants rs17228602 and rs17228616 in heroin, hashish and poly drug addicts. Both SNPs are located within microRNA (miRNA) recognition sites with potential to affect miRNA/transcript interaction. A total of 122 addicts of heroin, hashish and polydrug were recruited from local rehabilitation centers to participate in this study. AChE activity was measured in blood by Ellman's method. SNP genotyping was performed by restriction fragment length polymorphism (PCR-RFLP) and Sanger sequencing. The AChE activity was found significantly higher (p ≤ 0.005) in addicted cohort (mean ± standard error of mean 0.020 ± 0.001 μmol/L/min; 95% confidence interval (CI) 0.018-0.022) in comparison to non-addicted healthy subjects (0.011 ± 0.001 μmol/L/min; 95% confidence interval CI 0.010-0.013).

However, no statistically significant association of rs17228616 SNP with substance abuse disorder was found. The data presented here shows that AChE could play significant role in substance addiction.

Part A, Molecular & integrative physiology",2019 06 16,"Euryhaline teleosts can survive in a wide salinity range via alteration of the molecular mechanisms to maintain internal ionic and osmotic balance in osmoregulatory organs such as gill，kidney and intestine. Na+/K+-ATPase (NKA), plays a crucial role in sustaining intracellular homeostasis and is characterized by association of multiple isoforms of α- and β-subunits. To gain insight into the potential function of nka genes in salinity adaptation, 5 nkaα genes (nkaα1a, nkaα1b, nkaα2, nkaα3a, nkaα3b) and 7 nkaβ genes (nkaβ1a, nkaβ1b, nkaβ2a, nkaβ2b, nkaβ3a, nkaβ3b and nkaβ4) were identified from transcriptomic and genomic databases of Lateolabrax maculatus. The annotation and evolutionary footprint of these nka genes was revealed via the analysis of phylogenetic tree, gene synteny, copy numbers, exon-intron structures and motif compositions. The expressions of 12 nka genes in spotted sea bass was tested in ten tissues (kidney, gonad, stomach, intestine, gill, muscle, heart, spleen, liver and brain) and 6 genes (nkaα1a, nkaα1b, nkaα3a, nkaα3b, nkaβ1b and nkaβ2a) showed high expression in osmoregulatory organs. Furthermore, the responses of NKA and potential salinity-sensitive nka genes were examined under different salinity treatment (0 ppt, 12 ppt, 30 ppt, 45 ppt). Results showed that the enzyme activity of NKA was highest in gill and exhibited salinity dependent variation, with the highest activity identified in 45 ppt. Different nkaα/β-isoforms showed their diverse responses to salinity changes and the expression of nka genes including nkaα1a, nkaα3b, nkaβ1b in gill, nkaα3a in kidney and nkaβ2a in intestine were transcriptionally regulated by altered salinity. Notably, the expression patterns of nkaα1a and nkaβ1b in gill showed similar variation trend with NKA activity, suggesting that nkaα1a/β1b could be the major function isoforms involved in primary ion transport during salinity adaptation. Our results provided insights into the roles of nkas in osmotic regulation and a theoretical basis for future studies that focus on detailed molecular mechanisms in salinity adaptation of euryhaline teleosts."

Both membrane adapter proteins bind to each other and to clathrin, to drive assembly of the clathrin coat over nascent synaptic vesicles. Using knowledge of in vivo phosphorylation sites, AP180 was mutated to determine the effect on binding. N-terminally truncated AP180 exhibited phospho-mimetic (Ser/Thr to Glu)-dependent interaction with AP2, but not clathrin. C-terminally truncated and full length phospho-mutant AP180 bound less AP2 than wild type. However, there was no difference in AP2 binding for the phospho-mimetic or phospho-deficient (Ser/Thr to Ala) AP180 mutants. Thus, the phospho-mutant approach did not provide clarity for the role of phosphorylation in AP180-AP2 binding. Clathrin exhibited a phospho-mimetic-dependent interaction with full-length AP180. Furthermore, phospho-mimetic AP180 was deficient at assembling clathrin cages.

This effect is expressed in terms of fixation-fitness coefficients times ancestry coefficients that are related to the effective population size. In the case of constant selection, the fixation-fitness coefficients are functions of the coefficients of viability and fertility selection weighted by reproductive values and population-structure coefficients for the different age classes. This explains the difference between the effects of viability selection and fertility selection on fixation probability in age-structured populations. With frequency-dependent selection in the form of a public goods game, the fixation-fitness coefficients depend also on the public good allocation strategy of the population and the resource allocation strategies of the individuals. In this case, the results show that weak selection may favor the fixation of cooperation if the cooperators allocate more resources to reproduction versus survival than the defectors."

We found that the potentiation of glutamate release induced by the β adrenergic receptor (βAR) agonist isoproterenol is absent in cerebrocortical nerve terminals (synaptosomes) from mice lacking FMRP (Fmr1 KO), despite the normal cAMP generation. The glutamate release induced by moderate stimulation of synaptosomes with 5 mM KCl was not potentiated in Fmr1 KO synaptosomes by isoproterenol, nor by stimulating the receptor associated signaling pathway with the adenylyl cyclase activator forskolin or with the Epac activator 8-pCPT. Hence, the impairment in the pathway potentiating release is distal to βARs. Electron microscopy shows that Fmr1 KO cortical synapses have more docked vesicles than WT synapses, consequently occluding the isoproterenol response through which more SVs approach the active zone (AZ) of the plasma membrane. Weak stimulation of synaptosomes with the Ca2+ ionophore ionomycin recovered the release potentiation driven by forskolin and 8-pCPT but not with isoproterenol, revealing an impairment in the efficiency of receptor generated cAMP to activate the release potentiation pathway. Indeed, inhibiting cyclic nucleotide phosphodiesterase PDE2A with BAY 60-7550 reestablished isoproterenol mediated potentiation in Fmr1 KO synaptosomes. Thus, the lack of β-AR mediated potentiation of glutamate release appears to be the consequence of an impaired capability of the receptor to mobilize SVs to the AZ and because of a decreased efficiency of cAMP to activate the signaling pathway that enhances neurotransmitter release.",The use of iPSC technology for modeling Autism Spectrum Disorders.,https://www.ncbi.nlm.nih.gov/pubmed/31129084,Neurobiology of disease,2019 06 16,"Autism Spectrum Disorders (ASDs) are a group of neurodevelopmental disorders that influence social skills, involving communication, interaction, and behavior, usually with repetitive and restrictive manners. Due to the variety of genes involved in ASDs and several possible environmental factors influence, there is still no answer to what really causes syndromic and non-syndromic types of ASDs, usually affecting each individual in a unique way. However, we know that the mechanism underlying ASDs involves brain functioning. The human brain is a complex structure composed of close to 100 billion cells, which is a big challenge to study counting just with post mortem tissue investigation or genetic approaches. Therefore, human induced pluripotent stem cells (iPSC) technology has been used as a tool to produce viable cells for understanding a working brain. Taking advantage of patient-derived stem cells, researchers are now able to generate neurons, glial cells and brain organoids in vitro to model ASDs. In this review we report data from different studies showing how iPSCs have been a critical tool to study the different phenotypes of ASDs.",The relationship of team and individual athlete performances on match quarter outcome in elite women's Australian Rules football.,https://www.ncbi.nlm.nih.gov/pubmed/31129083,Journal of science and medicine in sport,2019 05 26,To evaluate the relationships between the athlete distribution of team performance indicators and quarter outcome in elite women's Australian Rules football matches.,"Attitudes, beliefs and knowledge related to doping in different categories of football players.",https://www.ncbi.nlm.nih.gov/pubmed/31129082,Journal of science and medicine in sport,2019 05 26,"The aim of this study was to study and compare attitudes, beliefs and knowledge about doping of footballers, from elite to under-18 categories.",Efficacy of immune checkpoint inhibitors in older adults with advanced stage cancers: A meta-analysis.,https://www.ncbi.nlm.nih.gov/pubmed/31129081,Journal of geriatric oncology,2019 05 26,There is uncertainty whether older patients derive a similar benefit from immune checkpoint inhibitors (ICI) as younger patients.

Limited number of electrophysiological studies revealed better visual sensory processing in deaf participants. On the other hand, studies deploying tactile stimuli especially used either electrical or painful stimulus or they focused the psychophysical assessments of thresholds associated with tactile stimuli. The present study tried to evaluate electrophysiological brain responses in deaf and control group with a unimodal study design including both the visual and non-painful tactile stimuli, and to reveal the possible changes in brain plasticity within modality basis. Thirteen congenitally deaf adolescents (mean: 14.61 ± 1.06 years; 7 girls) and 10 adolescents with normal hearing (16.6 ± 2.72 years; 4 girls) were recruited for the study. Somatosensory evoked potentials (SEP) and visual evoked potentials (VEP) were separately delivered to the participants and in order to maintain neutrality among sessions they were presented in random order while the electroencephalography (EEG) recordings were taken. Brain responses to non-painful tactile and visual stimuli were measured for N1, P2, and N2 components. All amplitudes of deaf group were significantly larger than all amplitudes of control group in SEP session whereas in VEP session only P2 and N2 amplitudes of deaf group were statistically larger. In addition, the latency of N1 component in VEP session was significantly earlier in deaf group. These findings suggest early cortical excitability, less neuronal capacity usage and also more efficient sensory processing in deaf group.",Numb deficiency causes impaired trafficking of mGlu5 in neurons and autistic-like behaviors.,https://www.ncbi.nlm.nih.gov/pubmed/31129078,Neuroscience letters,2019 06 16,"Protein Numb localizes to clathrin-coated vesicles and participates in the trafficking of trans-membrane receptors. We previously reported that Numb deficiency in cerebellar Purkinje cells impairs synaptic expression of metabotropic glutamate receptor 1 (mGlu1) and motor coordination. However, the functions of Numb in other brain regions have not been investigated. Here, we show that Numb regulates the membrane expression of metabotropic glutamate receptor 5 (mGlu5) and is critical to social behaviors. Numb binds to mGlu5 and promotes the membrane expression of mGlu5 by antagonizing its internalization and recycling. Interestingly, the conditional knockout of Numb and its homologous gene, Numblike, in excitatory neurons leads to a significant deficit in the three-chamber social test. Together, our work suggests that Numb is required for social interaction by modulating the functions of mGlu5.",Organization in complex brain networks: Energy distributions and phase shift.,https://www.ncbi.nlm.nih.gov/pubmed/31129077,Journal of theoretical biology,2019 06 14,"The Hamiltonian function of a network, derived from the intrinsic distributions of nodes and edges, magnified by resolution parameter has information on the distribution of energy in the network.

Here we identified to our knowledge a previously unreported communication form between tissue-resident DCs and niche cells that allows direct intracellular material exchange between the parties. We show that many keratinocytes (KC)-specific molecules such as keratins and adhesion molecules could be detected in the epidermal-resident Langerhans cells (LCs) as mRNA and protein. Furthermore, KC-derived Cre led to genetic recombination in the LCs. We also found that LCs containing KC-derived material were more prone to migration. The KC-specific signatures were transferred from KCs to LCs through an exosome-independent mechanism that likely involved nanotubes/dendrites. The transfer of material between epithelial cells and epithelia-associated DCs was not limited to mice or to KC-to-LC transfer. Taken together, these data suggest that the epithelial environment might have a long-term effect on DC biology and that genetic tools that specifically target epithelial cells also affect tissue-resident immune cells.",The differentiation-associated keratinocyte protein cornifelin contributes to cell-cell adhesion of epidermal and mucosal keratinocytes.,https://www.ncbi.nlm.nih.gov/pubmed/31129056,The Journal of investigative dermatology,2019 05 26,"Cornifelin (CNFN) has been identified as protein component of epidermal corneocytes. Here, we investigated the tissue distribution of CNFN and potential consequences of CNFN-deficiency on epithelial function in in vitro models of human skin and oral mucosa. Our detailed bioinformatics and immunostaining analysis revealed that CNFN is not only expressed in human epidermis but also in non-cornifying oral mucosa. In normal epidermis CNFN was confined to the upper granular layer and the stratum corneum. By contrast, in both, partly cornifying and non-cornifying oral mucosa CNFN was expressed in a cell membrane-associated pattern over several suprabasal layers. siRNA-mediated knock-down of CNFN in epidermal keratinocytes was associated with only subtle alterations of the overall epidermal architecture in skin models in vitro but led to altered morphology of corneodesmosomes as detected by electron-microscopy. Using dispase treatment followed by mechanical stress, epithelial sheets of CNFN-deficient epidermal keratinocytes were easily disrupted whereas their CNFN-competent counterparts remained intact. In contrast to epidermal keratinocytes, CNFN knock-down in oral keratinocytes had a more severe effect and caused pronounced acantholysis in organotypic models of oral mucosa. Together, these findings indicate that CNFN is a structural component of the cell-adhesion system of differentiated keratinocytes in both epidermis and oral mucosa.",Utilizing comprehensive and mini-kinome panels to optimize the selectivity of quinoline inhibitors for cyclin G associated kinase (GAK).,https://www.ncbi.nlm.nih.gov/pubmed/31129055,Bioorganic & medicinal chemistry letters,2019 06 04,"We demonstrate an innovative approach for optimization of kinase inhibitor potency and selectivity utilising kinase mini-panels and kinome-wide panels.

Herein we report the development and use of a high throughput fluorescence polarization-based peptide binding assay as an initial step toward the discovery and development of GRP78 inhibitors. This assay was used in a pilot screen to discover the anti-infective agent, hexachlorophene, as an inhibitor of GRP78. Through biochemical characterization we show that hexachlorophene is a competitive inhibitor of the GRP78-peptide interaction.

We here generated Eg5 shRNA-expressing plasmids using the inverted terminal repeats (ITRs) sequences to produce Eg5 hairpin RNA under the control of U6 promoter. Using PEGylated DC-Chol/DOPE cationic liposomes, we demonstrated that a single systemic administration of Eg5 shRNA-expressing plasmid/liposome lipoplexes induced the long-term Eg5 silencing in the tumor sites of tumor-bearing mice, and ultimately lead to more sustained anticancer effects than standard synthetic siEg5/liposome lipoplexes. This non-viral Eg5 shRNA expression system had no risk of immunogenicity anticipated in the use of viral vectors, and could reduce the potential of off-target effects by scaling down the administration dose of RNAi therapeutics in patient. Therefore, the sustainable shRNA expression properties in the tumor sites suggest an efficient strategy to overcome the limitations caused by chemically synthesized siRNA methods such as short-term silencing effects and off-target effects. Herein, this study provides a non-viral silencing strategy for inducing long-term Eg5 silencing in vivo and suggests the great potential of Eg5 shRNA-expressing lipoplexes as a DNA-based RNAi therapeutics for cancer treatment.",A structure-function approach identifies L-PGDS as a mediator responsible for glucocorticoid-induced leptin expression in adipocytes.,https://www.ncbi.nlm.nih.gov/pubmed/31129049,Biochemical pharmacology,2019 06 15,"Leptin is an adipokine predominantly secreted by adipocytes and has many physiological roles, including in energy homeostasis. We identified that AM630, a cannabinoid receptor 2 (CB2) antagonist, down-regulated leptin expression in mature adipocytes differentiated from either stromal vascular fractions isolated from inguinal fat pads of C57BL/6J mice or 3T3-L1 preadipocytes. However, the leptin-suppressive effects of AM630 preserved in CB2-deficient adipocytes indicated the off-target activity of AM630 in leptin expression. Pharmacological and genetic studies, cheminformatics, and docking simulation were applied to identify the potential protein target of AM630 that modulates leptin expression in differentiated primary preadipocytes. Screening of the reported off-targets of AM630 identified a synthetic cannabinoid WIN55212-2 exerting the same function. Target deconvolution and docking simulation suggested that AM630 and WIN55212-2 were both inhibitors of lipocalin-type prostaglandin D2 synthase (L-PGDS). Further studies showed that L-PGDS positively regulates leptin expression. Although glucocorticoid and aldosterone were previously reported to induce expression of both L-PGDS and leptin, our data demonstrated that L-PGDS mediates only glucocorticoid-induced leptin expression in differentiated primary preadipocytes. No effect was observed after aldosterone treatment. This newly discovered glucocorticoid - L-PGDS - leptin pathway may provide insights into current clinical use of glucocorticoid and management of their undesired effects such as obesity.",A dual farnesoid X receptor/soluble epoxide hydrolase modulator treats non-alcoholic steatohepatitis in mice.,https://www.ncbi.nlm.nih.gov/pubmed/31129048,Biochemical pharmacology,2019 06 15,"Non-alcoholic fatty liver disease (NAFLD) and non-alcoholic steatohepatitis (NASH) are the most prevalent metabolic liver disorders and a serious global health burden. NAFLD/NASH pathogenesis and progression are highly multi-factorial and likely demand a combination of multiple mechanisms to provide a more effective treatment. We have developed a dual farnesoid X receptor agonist (FXRA)/soluble epoxide hydrolase inhibitor (sEHi) to simultaneously address two validated and complementary modes of action in NASH treatment. Here we report the in vivo profiling for this FXRA/sEHi in toxin- and diet-induced rodent NASH models. In streptozotocin-induced NASH as a proof-of-concept study, the experimental FXRA/sEHi drug robustly prevented hepatic steatosis and fibrosis, and improved lipid homeostasis as well as biochemical markers of liver health. In methionine-choline-deficient high-fat diet-induced NASH, FXRA/sEHi treatment reduced hepatic steatosis and fibrosis to levels similar to healthy animals and demonstrated anti-inflammatory activity confirming that dual FXRA/sEHi modulation produces a triad of complementary anti-NASH effects. Our results validate dual FXRA/sEHi modulation as an effective therapeutic strategy to treat NASH and advocates for a combinational drug therapeutic approach for multifactorial liver diseases."

The purpose of our study is to compare various advanced PMRT techniques including fixed-beam intensity-modulated radiotherapy (IMRT), non-coplanar volumetric modulated arc therapy (NC-VMAT), multiple arc VMAT (MA-VMAT), and tomotherapy (TOMO). Results of standard VMAT and mixed beam therapy that were published by our group previously were also included in the plan comparisons. Treatment plans were produced for nine PMRT patients previously treated in our clinic. The plans were evaluated based on planning target volume (PTV) coverage, dose homogeneity index (DHI), conformity index (CI), dose to organs at risk (OARs), normal tissue complication probability (NTCP) of pneumonitis, lifetime attributable risk (LAR) of second cancers, and risk of coronary events (RCE). All techniques produced clinically acceptable PMRT plans. Overall, fixed-beam IMRT delivered the lowest mean dose to contralateral breast (1.56 ± 0.4 Gy) and exhibited lowest LAR (0.6 ± 0.2%) of secondary contralateral breast cancer; NC-VMAT delivered the lowest mean dose to lungs (7.5 ± 0.8 Gy), exhibited lowest LAR (5.4 ± 2.8%) of secondary lung cancer and lowest NTCP (2.1 ± 0.4%) of pneumonitis; mixed beam therapy delivered the lowest mean dose to heart (7.1 ± 1.3 Gy) and exhibited lowest RCE (8.6 ± 7.1%); TOMO plans provided the most optimal target coverage while delivering higher dose to OARs than other techniques. Both NC-VMAT and MA-VMAT exhibited lower values of all OARs evaluation metrics compare to standard VMAT.

In cells, HMGB1 is a transcription factor or transcription enhancer that is involved in nucleosome sliding, DNA repair, V(D)J recombination, telomere homeostasis, autophagy and viral sensing. HMGB1 can also be secreted or released by stressed cells and serves as an alarmin, cytokine or growth factor to activate the immune response. This protein facilitates CD4+ T cell differentiation and tissue repair through binding with its receptors, including toll-like receptors (TLRs) and the receptor for advanced glycation end-products (RAGE). Recent works have established that HMGB1 plays many vital functions in cardiac inflammatory injury, cardiac regeneration and remodelling. The present review addresses the novel role of HMGB1 in secretion and cardiomyocyte senescence and in the dual faced roles of HMGB1 in cardiac inflammatory injury, inflammatory resolution and cardiac regeneration and remodelling following cardiac injury."

Unfortunately, in order to improve transplantation possibilities, they require modification to reduce their degradation rate and immunogenicity. To date, no modifying agent has been approved to overcome these limitations. The objective of this study was to evaluate the ability of silver nanoparticles (AgNPs) to improve the structural stability and biocompatibility of decellularized rat esophagi. AgNPs have the advantage over currently used agents in that they bind with collagen fibers in a highly ordered manner, via non-covalent binding mechanisms forming multiple binding sites, while other agents provide only two-point connections between collagen molecules. Rat esophagi were decellularized, loaded with 5 μg/mL of AgNPs (100 nm), and then treated with an immobilization-complex buffer composed of ethyl carbodiimide hydrochloride and N-hydroxysuccinimide (EDC/NHS). Then, they were evaluated in terms of ultra-structural morphology, water uptake, in vitro resistance to enzymatic and thermal degradation, indentation strength, in vitro anti-calcification, cytocompatibility with rat bone marrow derived stromal cells (rat-BMSCs), angiogenic properties, and in vivo biocompatibility, and compared to scaffolds modified using glutaraldehyde and EDC/NHS complex buffer alone. AgNP-modified scaffolds showed an improved ultrastructure, good water uptake, and considerable resistance against in vitro degradation and indentation, and a high resistance against in vitro calcification. Moreover, they were cytocompatible for allogeneic rat-BMSCs. Additionally, AgNPs did not alter the angiogenic properties of the modified scaffolds and decreased host immune responses after their subcutaneous implantation.

A procedure of f-hPSC isolation from fragments of both selected fresh or cryopreserved bulk placental neonate tissues is proposed, based on their high migratory potential,. The fragments of the desired fetal placental tissues are adhered to a culture dish by traces of diluted fibrin and covered with culture medium. Spontaneous migration of pure f-hPSC from the tissue fragments to the cell culture dishes is followed by their rapid expansion by numerous passages.

Optimal yields of f-hPSC cultures can also be obtained from tissue samples cryopreserved in medium composed of 10% dimethyl sulfoxide (M2SO) and 50% fetal calf serum. Slightly better yields are obtained with media supplemented with 1% human albumin. Medium with 5% M2SO and/or 0.25 mg/ml PEG yielded inferior results.

Here, we elucidate an unexpected role of an essential ribogenesis factor, WDR43, as a chromatin-associated RNA-binding protein (RBP) and release factor in modulating the polymerase (Pol) II activity for pluripotency regulation. WDR43 binds prominently to promoter-associated noncoding/nascent RNAs, occupies thousands of gene promoters and enhancers, and interacts with the Pol II machinery in embryonic stem cells (ESCs). Nascent transcripts and transcription recruit WDR43 to active promoters, where WDR43 facilitates releases of the elongation factor P-TEFb and paused Pol II. Knockdown of WDR43 causes genome-wide defects in Pol II release and pluripotency-associated gene expression. Importantly, auxin-mediated rapid degradation of WDR43 drastically reduces Pol II activity, precluding indirect consequences.

Apoptosis of renal tubular cells is known to be the critical mechanisms of the progression of renal fibrosis, and mitochondrial dysfunction participates in this process. In this study, we investigated the effects of HSP75 on mitochondrial dysfunction and its relevance to apoptosis in human renal proximal tubular cells (HK2). HSP75 was up- and down-regulated in HK2 cells treated with TGF-β1 using letiviral vectors. HSP75 improved mitochondrial morphological injury and stabilized mitochondrial functions in HK2 cells stimulated by TGF-β1. Overexpression of HSP75 inhibited cell apoptosis, and it was reversed by using HSP75 shRNAs. HSP75 may be important for maintenance of mitochondrial function in HK2 cells under pathological conditions. Activation of HSP75 may be therapeutically useful in renal fibrosis to promote and maintain normal mitochondrial functions.","Variability in human drug metabolizing cytochrome P450 CYP2C9, CYP2C19 and CYP3A5 activities caused by genetic variations in cytochrome P450 oxidoreductase.",https://www.ncbi.nlm.nih.gov/pubmed/31128914,Biochemical and biophysical research communications,2019 06 11,"A broad spectrum of human diseases are caused by mutations in the NADPH cytochrome P450 oxidoreductase (POR). Cytochrome P450 proteins perform several reactions, including the metabolism of steroids, drugs, and other xenobiotics. In 2004 the first human patients with defects in POR were reported, and over 250 variations in POR are known. Information about the effects of POR variants on drug metabolizing enzymes is limited and has not received much attention. By analyzing the POR sequences from genomics databases, we identified potentially disease-causing variations and characterized these by in vitro functional studies using recombinant proteins. Proteins were expressed in bacteria and purified for activity assays. Activities of cytochrome P450 enzymes were tested in vitro using liposomes prepared with lipids into which P450 and P450 reductase proteins were embedded. Here we are reporting the effect of POR variants on drug metabolizing enzymes CYP2C9, CYP2C19, and CYP3A5 which are responsible for the metabolism of many drugs. POR Variants A115V, T142A, A281T, P284L, A287P, and Y607C inhibited activities of all P450 proteins tested. Interestingly, the POR variant Q153R showed a reduction of 20-50% activities with CYP2C9 and CYP2C19 but had a 400% increased activity with CYP3A5. The A287P is most common POR mutation found in patients of European origin, and significantly inhibited drug metabolism activities which has important consequences for monitoring and treatment of patients. In vitro, functional assays using recombinant proteins provide a useful model for establishing the metabolic effect of genetic mutations. Our results indicate that detailed knowledge about POR variants is necessary for correct diagnosis and treatment options for persons with POR deficiency and the role of changes in drug metabolism and toxicology due to variations in POR needs to be addressed.",Involvement of Myt1 kinase in the G2 phase of the first cell cycle in Xenopus laevis.,https://www.ncbi.nlm.nih.gov/pubmed/31128913,Biochemical and biophysical research communications,2019 06 11,"During cleavage of Xenopus laevis, the first mitotic cell cycle immediately following fertilization is approximately 90 min and consists of S, G2, and M phases. In contrast, the subsequent eleven cell cycles are approximately 30 min and consist mostly of S and M phases. The balance between Cdc25 and Wee1A/Myt1 is thought to be crucial for Xenopus first cell cycle progression; however, the role of Myt1 in this period has not been fully investigated. In this study, we examined the roles of Myt1, Wee1A, and Cdc25A in the first cell cycle of Xenopus laevis. Inhibition of Cdc25A with antisense morpholino oligonucleotides lengthened the duration of the first cell cycle to some extent, whereas it was slightly shortened by ectopic Cdc25A expression, suggesting that the low concentration of Cdc25A during the first cell cycle does not fully account for the long duration of this cycle. Using the Wee1A antisense morpholino oligonucleotide and neutralizing antibody against Myt1, we found that Myt1 phosphorylates and inhibits Cdk1 much more effectively than Wee1A during the first cell cycle in Xenopus. Taken together, these results suggest that the activity of Myt1 is predominantly responsible for the duration of the long G2 phase in the first mitotic cell cycle in Xenopus.",The prognostic potential of alpha-1 type I collagen expression in papillary thyroid cancer.,https://www.ncbi.nlm.nih.gov/pubmed/31128912,Biochemical and biophysical research communications,2019 06 11,"The present study aimed to identify the expression of key mRNAs as prognostic factors for papillary thyroid cancer (PTC) using integrated bioinformatic analyses and in vitro assays.

Furthermore, we performed in vitro assays, including cell proliferation, colony formation, transwell, and wound healing assays, to validate the role of COL1A1 in the progression and metastasis of PTC.

We here describe that non-adherent culture of glioma cells was accompanied by an increase in hypoxia-inducible factor (HIF)-dependent, but not β-catenin/TCF-induced transcription. Levels of reactive oxygen species decreased in suspension and knockdown of HIF-1α enhanced cell death following detachment. By promoting the adaptation to non-adherent conditions, mechanisms driven by HIF-1α may considerably contribute to the biology and aggressiveness of glioblastoma.","MTA2 promotes HCC progression through repressing FRMD6, a key upstream component of hippo signaling pathway.",https://www.ncbi.nlm.nih.gov/pubmed/31128910,Biochemical and biophysical research communications,2019 06 11,"Discerning oncogenic drivers from passengers remains a major effort in understanding of the essence of the initiation and development of hepatocellular carcinoma (HCC), the most common primary liver malignancy and the third leading cause of cancer mortality worldwide. Here we report that MTA2, Metastasis Associated 1 Family Member 2, is significantly up-regulated in HCC. We show that high level of MTA2 expression is strongly correlated with advanced pathological stages and poor overall survival of the patients. Genome-wide identification of the transcriptional targets of MTA2 by ChIP-seq indicates that MTA2 represses a cohort of genes including FRMD6 that are critically involved in the growth and mobility of HCC. We demonstrate that the MTA2 promotes the proliferation and metastasis of HCC in vitro and in vivo through suppressing Hippo signaling pathway. Together, these results reveal a key role for the MTA2-FRDM6-Hippo axis in human hepatocarcinogenesis.",Weight bearing in patients with femoral neck fractures compared to pertrochanteric fractures: A postoperative gait analysis.,https://www.ncbi.nlm.nih.gov/pubmed/31128909,Injury,2019 05 26,"Early mobilization following hip fracture surgery is of superior importance especially in elderly hip fracture patients. Reduced mobilization can result in complications and increased mortality. In this study a gait analysis was performed using force-measuring insoles. We hypothesized, that patients with femoral neck fractures treated with hip replacement surgery load the affected limb more compared to patients with pertrochanteric fractures treated with fracture fixation. All patients (> 65 years) treated for a femoral neck fracture with hip replacement or a pertrochanteric fracture, respectively using fracture fixation with intramedullary nailing, were consecutively included in this study. For gait analysis, specific insole forcesensors (Loadsol®) were inserted into the footwear. Five days after surgery gait analysis was performed with a defined walking distance and all patients were instructed to transpose full weight. 20 patients following hip replacement surgery and 27 patients following intramedullary nailing were included. The hip replacement group loaded the affected limb with an average of 74.01% (SD 13.6) of bodyweight, while the fracture fixation group loaded a significantly reduced average of 62.70% (SD 8.3; p = 0.002). The results of the present study indicate that patients suffering from pertrochanteric fractures following fracture fixation are struggling to fully load the affected leg compared to patients suffering from femoral neck fractures treated with hip replacement surgery. The focus of further studies should concentrate on alternative analgesia and verify the cause of the observed difference in order to facilitate early full weight bearing especially in hip fracture patients following fracture fixation. The results indicate that in elderly patients, the fracture pattern and thus the surgical approach lead to a different weight bearing pattern. The primary therapeutic goal for elderly patients must be early mobilization at full weight bearing.",A comparison between the Major Trauma Centre management of complex open lower limb fractures in children and the elderly.,https://www.ncbi.nlm.nih.gov/pubmed/31128908,Injury,2019 05 26,Open lower limb fractures can be devastating with outcomes determined by tissue damage and adherence to strictly defined care pathways.

In healthy breast-fed infants, the gut microbiota is dominated by Bifidobacterium spp.. Cutibacterium avidum is among the initial colonizers, however, the phylogenetic relationship of infant fecal isolates to isolates from other body sites, and C. avidum carbon utilization related to the infant gut ecosystem have been little investigated. In this study, we investigated the phylogenetic and phenotypic diversity of 28 C. avidum strains, including 16 strains isolated from feces of healthy infants. We investigated the in vitro capacity of C. avidum infant isolates to degrade and consume carbon sources present in the infant gut, and metabolic interactions of C. avidum with infant associated Bifidobacterium longum subsp. infantis and Bifidobacterium bifidum. Isolates of C. avidum showed genetic heterogeneity. C. avidum consumed d- and l-lactate, glycerol, glucose, galactose, N-acetyl-d-glucosamine and maltodextrins. Alpha-galactosidase- and β-glucuronidase activity were a trait of a group of non-hemolytic strains, which were mostly isolated from infant feces. Beta-glucuronidase activity correlated with the ability to ferment glucuronic acid. Co-cultivation with B. infantis and B. bifidum enhanced C. avidum growth and production of propionate, confirming metabolic cross-feeding. This study highlights the phylogenetic and functional diversity of C. avidum, their role as secondary glycan degraders and propionate producers, and suggests adaptation of a subpopulation to the infant gut.","The Role of Genetic Predisposition, Programing During Fetal Life, Family Conditions, and Post-natal Diet in the Development of Pediatric Fatty Liver Disease.",https://www.ncbi.nlm.nih.gov/pubmed/31128886,The Journal of pediatrics,2019 05 26,"To evaluate, in patients with nonalcoholic fatty liver disease (NAFLD), the role of lifetime exposures associated with genetic predisposition, family history (parental obesity, economic income), programming during fetal life (gestational age, birthweight), being breastfed or not, and later biomarkers of dietary habits and lifestyle in the development of fibrosis.",Health Outcomes and Quality of Life Indices of Children Receiving Blenderized Feeds via Enteral Tube.,https://www.ncbi.nlm.nih.gov/pubmed/31128885,The Journal of pediatrics,2019 05 26,To determine whether clinical and patient-reported outcomes differ in children receiving blenderized diets compared with conventional formula.,Recovery and reactivity of polycyclic aromatic hydrocarbons collected on selected sorbent tubes and analyzed by thermal desorption-gas chromatography/mass spectrometry.,https://www.ncbi.nlm.nih.gov/pubmed/31128883,Journal of chromatography. A,2019 05 26,"This article describes the optimization of methodology for extending the measurement of volatile organic compounds (VOCs) to increasingly heavier polycyclic aromatic hydrocarbons (PAHs) with a detailed focus on recent sorbent tube technology. Although PAHs have lower volatility than compounds such as benzene, toluene, ethylbenzene and xylenes, these semi-volatile compounds can be detected in air and breath samples. For this work, PAHs were captured on sorbent tubes and subsequently analyzed using automated thermal desorption gas chromatography - mass spectrometry (ATD-GC/MS). While many different sorbent tubes are commercially available, optimization for airborne PAH sampling using sorbent tubes has not been previously considered. Herein, several commercially available sorbent tubes, including Carbograph 2 TD/1TD, Tenax TA, XRO-440, and inert-coated PAH tubes are compared to determine the relative recovery for eight PAHs commonly found in the environment. Certain types of sorbent materials were found to be better suited for PAH recovery during thermal desorption, and PAH reaction products were observed on several types of sorbent tubes, including graphitized carbon black sorbents with stainless steel tube materials.

To further explore the affect of solvent type on column selectivity complementary information is presented for aqueous phases containing 10-70% (v/v) tetrahydrofuran for two columns. Columns were selected to include examples of all common column packing morphologies for small molecule separations (totally porous particles, superficially porous particles, organic-inorganic hybrid particles, and a monolith) and common topologies octadecylsiloxane-bonded (including phases with a polar-embedded group, mixed-mode phases with a short-chain siloxane-bonded polar functional group, sterically crowded, positive shield, and fluorine-containing phases); octylsiloxane-bonded; and various phenyl-containing stationary phases with different linker arms, pentafluorophenylalkyl and biphenyl groups. The column properties are reported as a system constant database and as system maps for the full range of mobile phase compositions. Selectivity differences are evaluated using principal component factor analysis to classify the columns into selectivity groups and correlation plots of the system constants for compared columns at all mobile phase compositions. The later is shown to be a suitable technique to identify (near) selectivity equivalent columns and varied columns suitable for method development. Contributions to retention from steric resistance and cation-exchange interactions not parameterized in the solvation parameter model are identified for columns and conditions where they may be important. It is shown that the interaction parameters employed in the hydrophobic-subtraction model have little overlap with those of the solvation parameter model and a quantitative comparison of column properties delineated by both models is not possible.",Toward the characterisation of non-intentionally added substances migrating from polyester-polyurethane lacquers by comprehensive gas chromatography-mass spectrometry technologies.,https://www.ncbi.nlm.nih.gov/pubmed/31128881,Journal of chromatography. A,2019 06 04,"Polyester-polyurethane lacquer, used to cover the inner surface of metallic food contact materials, may transfer non-intentionally added substances (NIAS) to the food. The identification of such a diversity of compounds, considered as migrating substances, requires taking advantage of complementary analytical platforms. Therefore, four types of gas chromatography-mass spectrometry (GCMS) couplings were investigated and compared for their abilities to identify migrating substances after acetonitrile extraction of two commercialised lacquers. In parallel, various ionisation sources, i.e. electron ionisation (EI) (70 eV and soft energies) and atmospheric-pressure chemical ionisation (APCI) as well as various mass analysers, i.e. quadrupole, time-of-flight (low and high resolution) and Orbitrap, were tested. Comparison of mass spectra with a commercial library for EI ionisation source led to the identification of two NIAS compounds, isophorone diisocyanate and 4,4'-diphenylmethane diisocyanate. Additionally, many cyclic oligoesters (four monomer units) were unambiguously identified according to supplier's declaration on starting materials used, primarily based on the molecular ion observed by APCI mode and characteristic fragment ions. High resolution mass analysers also enhanced confidence level in such NIAS identification. One- and two-dimensional GC were also investigated for separation assessment. Although GC × GC did not reveal additional NIAS, its use provided a valuable mapping of oligomers according to monomers composition. These results were compared to our previously published LC-MS study, carried out on the same lacquer samples. This study shows that LC and GC, along with their related ionisation techniques and their own selectivity, are complementary approaches, revealing different classes of compounds covering a wide range of volatility and polarity.",Systematic review and consensus definitions for the Standardised Endpoints in Perioperative Medicine initiative: clinical indicators.,https://www.ncbi.nlm.nih.gov/pubmed/31128879,British journal of anaesthesia,2019 05 26,"Clinical indicators are powerful tools to quantify the safety and quality of patient care.

A subset of 2 isolates was selected for inoculation into milk and onto the surface of a model cheese for subsequent color measurement. These isolates produced different colors on potato dextrose agar, but produced nearly identical color defects in milk and on model cheese. For the same subset of 2 isolates, the gray color defect in milk was produced only in containers with ample headspace and not in full containers, suggesting that oxygen is vital for pigment formation. This work also demonstrated that a Pseudomonas isolate from cheese can produce a pigment defect in milk, and vice versa. Comparative genomics identified an accessory locus encoding tryptophan biosynthesis genes that was present in all isolates that produced gray or blue pigment under laboratory conditions and was only previously reported in 2 P. fluorescens isolates responsible for blue mozzarella in Italy. Because this locus was found in genetically distant isolates belonging to different Pseudomonas species groups, it may have been acquired via horizontal gene transfer. These data suggest that several past and present gray- or blue-pigmented dairy spoilage events share a common genetic etiology that transcends species-level identification and merits further investigation to determine mechanistic details and modes of prevention.",[Therapeutic failure in skin carcinomas of the face].,https://www.ncbi.nlm.nih.gov/pubmed/31128865,Annales de chirurgie plastique et esthetique,2019 06 01,"Therapeutic failures in the management of skin carcinomas of the face are not rare, because of the very high frequency of these lesions.

Considering the network congestion, an event-triggered communication mechanism is adopted, where the measurements are transmitted only when an 'event' occurs. An indicator obeying the Markov jump rule is introduced to characterize the randomly occurring denial-of-service attacks. In virtue of the extended state observer (ESO), the states and the total disturbance which involves both unknown dynamics and physical attacks are estimated. Then, the composite controller is designed which could stabilize the overall controlled system and eliminate the so-called total disturbance. Sufficient conditions are established to guarantee the stability of the observer system and overall controlled system. The cone-complementarity linearization algorithm is adopted to obtain the parameters of the extended state observer and the controller. Finally, both numerical and application design examples demonstrate the feasibility and efficacy of the proposed method. Simulation results show that the steady-state error within 0.02 can be achieved within 3 s.",Aberrant expressed long non-coding RNAs in laryngeal squamous-cell carcinoma.,https://www.ncbi.nlm.nih.gov/pubmed/31128861,American journal of otolaryngology,2019 05 26,Laryngeal squamous-cell carcinoma (LSCC) is the second most common malignant tumor of head and neck squamous cell carcinoma.

The strategy applied the Governmental Learning Spiral method, an approach designed to overcome political barriers and to enhance innovation in the political context. This participative process, where those who develop are also those who implement, enhances a sense of social belonging among the people involved, which leads to the alignment of different viewpoints as well as to the creation of social networks. In consequence, a broader audience becomes involved; this creates feedback loops that lead to the continuous improvement of the strategy process. Within less than five years the SHS has been able to achieve significant goals within the scope of its vision: the implementation of universal access to Hepatitis C therapies has been enforced; increased attention within the general population has been achieved by using progressively more media coverage about therapies, a patient organisation has been founded and the national health authorities have begun to support the strategy financially. The case of the SHS proves, that a carefully designed political learning process is an efficient and innovative tool in the face of today's health policy challenges such as the Hepatitis C epidemic.",Depression and PTSD-related anhedonia mediate the association of military sexual trauma and suicidal ideation in female service members/veterans.,https://www.ncbi.nlm.nih.gov/pubmed/31128854,Psychiatry research,2019 05 26,"Previous research shows a direct link between military sexual trauma and suicide risk. Little is known about mediators of this association, including posttraumatic stress disorder (PTSD) or depression severity, mental health conditions that are correlated with both suicide risk and military sexual trauma. Moreover, existing studies of military sexual trauma do not distinguish between harassment and assault, resulting in a gap in our knowledge regarding suicide risk as a function of sexual trauma type. We explored whether PTSD symptom clusters and depression mediated the association of military sexual trauma type (none, harassment-only, assault) and suicidal ideation (SI). Female service members/Veterans (n = 1190) completed a demographic inventory, military sexual trauma history and type screening, and PTSD symptom cluster severity, depression severity, and SI measures. Structural equation modeling revealed that the association of military sexual trauma, particularly assault, with SI was mediated by depression severity and PTSD-related anhedonia. Screening for SI among those endorsing a history of military sexual trauma, PTSD-related anhedonia, and depression may help identify those at risk for SI. Therapeutic interventions aimed at reducing PTSD-related anhedonia and depression symptoms may be the most efficient way to mitigate suicide risk in those with histories of assault military sexual trauma.",The impact of completion thyroidectomy followed by radioactive iodine ablation for patients with lymph node recurrence of papillary thyroid carcinoma.,https://www.ncbi.nlm.nih.gov/pubmed/31128851,Surgery,2019 05 26,"Although lobectomy is considered acceptable as a primary surgical treatment for papillary thyroid carcinoma in properly selected patients, a standard treatment for postlobectomy lymph node recurrence has not been established.

In 2013, the species formed a red tide in a shallow lagoon in western Japan, which was the first report of the species in the area. To investigate the genetic relatedness of Japanese A. ostenfeldii and global isolates, the full-length SSU, ITS and LSU sequences were determined, and phylogenetic analyses were conducted for isolates from western and northern Japan and from the Baltic Sea. Genotyping and microsatellite sequence comparison were performed to estimate the divergence and connectivity between the populations from western Japan and the Baltic Sea. In all phylogenetic analyses, the isolates from western Japan grouped together with global isolates from shallow and low saline areas, such as the Baltic Sea, estuaries on the east coast of U.S.A. and from the Bohai Sea, China. In contrast, the isolates from northern Japan formed a well-supported separate group in the ITS and LSU phylogenies, indicating differentiation between the Japanese populations. This was further supported by the notable differentiation between the sequences of western and northern Japanese isolates, whereas the lowest differentiation was found between the western Japanese and Chinese isolates. Microsatellite genotyping revealed low genetic diversity in the western Japanese population, possibly explained by a recent introduction to the lagoon from where it was detected. The red tide recorded in the shallow lagoon followed notable changes in the salinity of the waterbody and phytoplankton composition, potentially facilitating the bloom of A. ostenfeldii.",Volatile compounds released by microalgae-water phase from Taihu Lake in China.,https://www.ncbi.nlm.nih.gov/pubmed/31128813,Harmful algae,2019 05 26,"The spectrum of Volatile Organic Compounds (VOCs) released by the microalgae-water phase of Taihu Lake in China was examined, then release behaviors were studied using non-methane hydrocarbons (NMHC, including a few polar organics) to describe the total amount of the released VOCs.

Alkanes, alkenes, oxygenated VOCs (OVOCs) and volatile sulfide chemicals (VOSCs) were detected. Their relative contents over time varied markedly from the stationary to the apoptosis phase, with their release rates as described by NMHC estimated from 0.02 to 0.59 μgC/(h g). Methane was investigated simultaneously, and its release rate was found to be 0.05-3.96 μgC/(h g).

Input reduction of both nitrogen (N) and phosphorus (P) are commonly recognized as basic ways of controlling blooms, but little is known about the roles of nutrients and their using strategy among cyanobacteria in triggering the succession of diazotrophic to non-diazotrophic cyanobacteria. In this study, we investigated in situ responses of cyanobactria to ambient P status during the transition from Dolichospermum flos-aquae to Microcystis spp. in Lake Taihu and Lake Chaohu. While dominant in phytoplankton community, D. flos-aquae experienced P deficiency as evidenced by qualitative detection of extracellular phosphatase via enzyme labeled fluorescence (ELF). The percentage of ELF-labelled D. flos-aquae cells was 33% when it dominated the phytoplankton community, and was 78% when it co-dominated with Microcystis spp., indicating an increase in P deficiency. Meanwhile, no ELF-labelled Microcystis cells were observed while polyphosphate body (PPB) were present, suggesting that Microcystis spp. were not P deficient. Additionally, the percentages of Microcystis cells containing PPB showed an inverted ""U-shaped"" relationship with concentrations on soluble reactive phosphorus (SRP). To validate the field observation, a laboratory study of the monocultures of the dominant cyanobacteria was conducted. Extracellular alkaline phosphatase activity (APA) and PPB accumulation were regulated by P availability in monocultures of D. flos-aquae. Interestingly, no cell bound extracellular phosphatase was found on Microcystis aeruginasa even in the culture without P supply. Consistently, the expressions of phosphatase encoding gene phoX showed no differences among the treatments. The way in which PPB accumulation occurred in Microcystis spp. in response to P availability in the cultures was similar to that observed in the field, demonstrating a strategy of energy conservation over P accumulation. The competitive advantage of Microcystis spp. was displayed at low P concentrations: where it could rapidly uptake and store inorganic P, which also increased the P deficiency of the coexisting phytoplankton species. Responses of P-transport gene pstS confirmed this hypothesis. The physiological and molecular mechanisms mentioned above enable Microcystis to survive and proliferate in environment with low available P supply more efficiently. In conclusion, different cyanobacterial species have distinct ways of responding to P availability, suggesting that the control of cyanobacterial blooms by targeted nutrient reduction is largely dependent upon the dominant species. P reduction is more effective in controlling diazotrophic cyanobacteria than non-diazotrophic cyanobacteria.",Development of a multiplex polymerase chain reaction assay for the parallel detection of harmful algal bloom-forming species distributed along the Chinese coast.,https://www.ncbi.nlm.nih.gov/pubmed/31128811,Harmful algae,2019 05 26,"Harmful algal blooms (HABs) have adverse effects on the marine ecological environment, public health, and marine economy. Thus, methods for the accurate and rapid identification of harmful algal species are urgently needed for the effective monitoring of the occurrence of HABS. A method for the parallel detection of harmful algal species must be established because various HAB-forming algal species coexist in the marine environment. This work developed a multiplex PCR (mPCR) method that can simultaneously detect six common HAB-forming microalgal species distributed along the coast of China: Karlodinium veneficum (Kv), Chattonella marina (Cm), Skeletonema spp., Scrippsiella trochoidea (St), Karenia mikimotoi (Km), and Prorocentrum donghaiense (Pd). Specific mPCR primers were designed from the internal transcribed spacer rDNA or large subunit rDNA gene of the target algal species. The mPCR conditions were optimized. Each mPCR primer was subjected to a cross-reactivity test with other microalgae to confirm the specificity of the developed mPCR system. The results of the system stability test indicated that the background concentration of DNA tested did not affect the performance of the established mPCR system. The results of the sensitivity test showed that the detection limit of the proposed mPCR system for Kv, Cm, Km, and Pd was 0.6 ng μL-1 and that for Skeletonema spp. and St was 0.06 ng μL-1. Additional mPCR analysis with spiked field samples revealed that the detection limit of the mPCR system for Km, Pd, and Kv was 60 cells, whereas that for Cm, Skeletonema spp., and St was 6 cells. The convenience and accuracy of the established mPCR assay were further validated through tests with field samples. The proposed mPCR assay is characterized by parallel analysis, strong specificity, and stability and can be used to supplement morphology-based detection methods for algal species.",Colorimetric DNA-based assay for the specific detection and quantification of Ostreopsis cf. ovata and Ostreopsis cf. siamensis in the marine environment.,https://www.ncbi.nlm.nih.gov/pubmed/31128810,Harmful algae,2019 05 26,"Ostreopsis is a toxic benthic dinoflagellate largely distributed worldwide in tropical and temperate areas. In the Mediterranean Sea, periodic summer blooms have been reported and have become a serious concern due to their direct impact on human health and the environment. Current microalgae identification is performed via light microscopy, which is time-consuming and is not able to differentiate among Ostreopsis species. Therefore, there is mature need for rapid, specific and easy-to-use detection tools. In this work, a colorimetric assay exploiting a combination of recombinase polymerase amplification (RPA) and a sandwich hybridisation assay was developed for O. cf. ovata and O. cf. siamensis detection and quantification. The specificity of the system was demonstrated by cross-reactivity experiments and calibration curves were successfully constructed using genomic DNA, achieving limits of detection of 10 and 14 pg/μL for O. cf. ovata and O. cf. siamensis, respectively. The assay was applied to the analysis of planktonic and benthic environmental samples from different sites of the Catalan coast. Species-specific DNA quantifications were in agreement with qPCR analysis, demonstrating the reliability of the colorimetric approach. Significant correlations were also obtained between DNA quantifications and light microscopy counts. The approach may be a valuable tool to provide timely warnings, facilitate monitoring activities or study population dynamics, and paves the way towards the development of in situ tools for the monitoring of harmful algal blooms.","High abundance of Amphidomataceae (Dinophyceae) during the 2015 spring bloom of the Argentinean Shelf and a new, non-toxigenic ribotype of Azadinium spinosum.",https://www.ncbi.nlm.nih.gov/pubmed/31128809,Harmful algae,2019 05 26,"Azaspiracids (AZA) are the most recently discovered group of lipophilic marine biotoxins of microalgal origin, and associated with human incidents of shellfish poisoning. They are produced by a few species of Amphidomataceae, but diversity and occurrence of the small-sized dinophytes remain poorly explored for many regions of the world. In order to analyze the presence and importance of Amphidomataceae in a highly productive area of Argentinean coastal waters (El Rincón area, SW Atlantic), a scientific cruise was performed in 2015 to sample the early spring bloom. In a multi-method approach, light microscopy was combined with real-time PCR molecular detection of Amphidomataceae, with chemical analysis of AZA, and with the establishment and characterization of amphidomatacean strains. Both light microscopy and PCR revealed that Amphidomataceae were widely present in spring plankton communities along the El Rincón area. They were particularly abundant offshore at the shelf front, reaching peak densities of 2.8 × 105 cells L-1, but no AZA were detected in field samples. In total, 31 new strains were determined as Az. dalianense and Az. spinosum, respectively. All Az. dalianense were non-toxigenic and shared the same rRNA sequences. The large majority of the new Az. spinosum strains revealed for the first time the presence of a non-toxigenic ribotype of this species, which is otherwise the most important AZA producer in European waters. One of the new Az. spinosum strains, with a particular slender shape and some other morphological peculiarities, clustered with toxigenic strains of Az. spinosum from Norway and, exceptionally for the species, produced only AZA-2 but not AZA-1. Results indicate a wide diversity within Az. spinosum, both in terms of sequence data and toxin profiles, which also will affect the qualitative and quantitative performance of the specific qPCR assay for this species. Overall, the new data provide a more differentiated perspective of diversity, toxin productivity and occurrence of Amphidomataceae in a poorly explored region of the global ocean.",Urea dynamics during Lake Taihu cyanobacterial blooms in China.,https://www.ncbi.nlm.nih.gov/pubmed/31128808,Harmful algae,2019 05 26,"Lake Taihu, the third largest freshwater lake in China, suffers from harmful cyanobacteria blooms caused by Microcystis spp., which do not fix nitrogen (N). Reduced N (i.e., NH4+, urea and other labile organic N compounds) is an important factor affecting the growth of Microcystis. As the world use of urea as fertilizer has escalated during the past decades, an understanding of how urea cycling relates to blooms of Microcystis is critical to predicting, controlling and alleviating the problem. In this study, the cycling rates of urea-N in Lake Taihu ranged from non-detectable to 1.37 μmol N L-1 h-1 for regeneration, and from 0.042 μmol N L-1 h-1 to 2.27 μmol N L-1 h-1 for potential urea-N removal. The fate of urea-N differed between light and dark incubations. Increased 15NH4+ accumulated and higher quantities of the removed urea-15N remained in the 15NH4+ form were detected in the dark than in the light. A follow-up incubation experiment with 15N-urea confirmed that Microcystis can grow on urea but its effects on urea dynamics were minor, indicating that Microcystis was not the major factor causing the observed fates of urea under different light conditions in Lake Taihu. Bacterial community composition and predicted functional gene data suggested that heterotrophic bacteria metabolized urea, even though Microcystis spp. was the dominant bloom organism.",Causal relationships of Raphidiopsis (formerly Cylindrospermopsis) dynamics with water temperature and N:P-ratios: A meta-analysis across lakes with different climates based on inferential modelling.,https://www.ncbi.nlm.nih.gov/pubmed/31128807,Harmful algae,2019 05 26,"Raphidiopsis raciborskii is a tropical toxic cyanobacterium that is rapidly expanding to diverse lake habitats in different climate zones by sophisticated adaptation mechanisms. This meta-analysis investigated correlations of R. raciborskii with water temperature and N:P (nitrogen to phosphorus)-ratios across four lakes with different climates and trophic states by means of long-term time series and the hybrid evolutionary algorithm HEA. The results have shown that in the lakes with temperate and Mediterranean climate, R. raciborskii is strongly correlated with water temperature since germination and growth rely on rising water temperatures in spring. In contrast, there was a weaker correlation with water temperature in subtropical and tropical lakes where pelagic populations of R. raciborskii are overwintering, and are present all year round. However, the highest abundances of R. raciborskii coincided with highest water temperature for the Mediterranean, subtropical and tropical lakes, whilst in the temperate Langer See the highest abundances of R. raciborskii occurred at 24.1 °C, even though temperatures of up to 27 °C were recorded in 2013 and 2014. The correlation of R. raciborskii with N:P-ratios proved to be strongest for the meso- to eutrophic Lake Kinneret (r2 = 0.8) and lowest for the eutrophic Lake Paranoa (r2 = 0.16). However, the assumption has been confirmed that R. raciborskii is growing fastest when waters are N-limited regardless of trophic states. In terms of phenology, the temperate and Mediterranean lakes displayed ""fastest growth"" in spring and early summer. In contrast, the growing season in subtropical and tropical lakes lasted from spring to autumn most likely because of overwintering populations, and growing importance of direct and indirect biotic regulating factors such as competition, grazing, remineralisation of nutrients along warming climate. In order to carry out a meta-analysis of time series across four different lakes, HEA served as powerful tool resulting in inferential models with predictive capacity for population dynamics of R. raciborskii just driven by water temperature or N:P-ratios, whilst coefficients of determination r2 served as criteria for hypotheses testing.",Physical transport processes affect the origins of harmful algal blooms in estuaries.,https://www.ncbi.nlm.nih.gov/pubmed/31128806,Harmful algae,2019 05 26,"The effects of physical transport processes on the initiation of harmful algal blooms (HABs) in estuaries were investigated through both mathematical model analysis and numerical model experiments. This study highlights the influence of the flushing effect due to physical transport processes on the location of bloom initiation, which is comparable to or even more important than local processes. The theoretical analysis suggests that the differential flushing effect at different waterbodies due to complex geometry is one of the dominant factors causing inhomogeneous distribution of algal density during HAB initiation. The ratio of residence time to volume is one of the key variables that determine the differential timing of HAB occurrence in estuary-subestuary systems with multiple interconnected waterbodies. As a result, a HAB tends to be observed first in those locations with relatively long residence time and small waterbodies, such as tributaries or areas with large eddies. Multiple unconnected originating locations can co-exist within an estuary. Two three-dimensional model experiments with realistic forcings were conducted to demonstrate the flushing effect on annual Cochlodinium polykrikoides bloom in the lower James River. The results show that while the environmental conditions that affect local processes, such as salinity and temperature, are important in determining the originating locations of HABs, the differential flushing effect is the dominant factor driving the spatial difference in the density of C. polykrikoides in this region during the bloom initiation. This explains why the occurrence of the first bloom in this region is frequently observed in the Lafayette River, a relatively small waterbody with long residence time. Because of the relatively low growth rate of C. polykrikoides and because of the high water-exchange between the mainstem and tributaries of the James River, initial cyst distribution is suggested to have a relatively small impact on originating locations of the bloom compared to flushing effect and salinity, and the HAB originating locations do not have to be in the waterbody with abundant cysts.","Species composition and toxicity of the genus Pseudo-nitzschia in Taiwan Strait, including P. chiniana sp. nov. and P. qiana sp. nov.",https://www.ncbi.nlm.nih.gov/pubmed/31128805,Harmful algae,2019 05 26,"In a field survey in the Taiwan Strait during April 2016, the species composition and the domoic acid production of the diatom genus Pseudo-nitzschia were investigated. A total of 80 strains of Pseudo-nitzschia were established, and species identification was determined based on a combination of morphological and molecular data. Fourteen taxa were recognized, i.e., P. americana, P. brasiliana, P. calliantha, P. cuspidata, P. galaxiae, P. lundholmiae, P. multiseries, P. multistriata, P. pseudodelicatissima, P. pungens var. aveirensis, P. pungenus var. pungens and P. sabit, as well as two novel species P. chiniana C.X. Huang & Yang Li and P. qiana C.X. Huang & Yang Li. Morphologically, P. chiniana is characterized by striae comprising one or two rows of poroids, and valve ends that are normally dominated by two rows of poroids within each stria. Whereas P. qiana is unique by having a narrow valve width (1.3-1.5 μm) and sharply pointed valve ends. Both taxa constitute their own monophyletic lineage in the phylogenetic analyses inferred from LSU and ITS2 rDNA, and are well differentiated from other Pseudo-nitzschia species. Pseudo-nitzschia chiniana forms a group with P. abrensis and P. batesiana in LSU and ITS trees, whereas P. qiana is sister to P. lineola. When comparing ITS2 secondary structure, five CBCs and seven HCBCs are recognized between P. chiniana and P. abrensis, and four CBCs and ten HCBCs between P. chiniana and P. batesiana. Two CBCs and eight HCBCs are found between P. qiana with P. lineola. The ability of the strains to produce domoic acid was assessed, including a potential toxin induction by the presence of brine shrimps. Results revealed production of domoic acid in six strains belonging to three species. Without presence of brine shrimps, cellular DA (pDA) was detected in four P. multiseries strains (1.6 ± 0.3, 26.6 ± 2.7, 68.3 ± 4.2 and 56.9 ± 4.7 fg cell-1, separately), one strain of P. pseudodelicatissima (0.8 ± 0.2 fg cell-1) and one strain of P. lundholmiae (2.5 ± 0.4 fg cell-1). In the presence of brine shrimps, pDA contents increased significantly (p < 0.05) in P. lundholmiae (strain MC4218) and P. multiseries (strain MC4177), from 2.5 ± 0.4 to 8.9 ± 0.7 and 1.6 ± 0.3 to 37.2 ± 2.5 fg cell-1 respectively."

Hence, an efficient detection platform for the rapid and sensitive identification of K. veneficum is highly demanded. In this study, a method referred to as recombinase polymerase amplification coupled with lateral flow dipstick (RPA-LFD) was developed for the rapid detection of K. veneficum. The primers for RPA and the detection probe for LFD were designed to specially target the internal transcribed spacer of K. veneficum by molecular cloning and multiple alignments of the related sequences. The developed RPA can gain an approximately 300 bp specific band from K. veneficum. Successful amplification for RPA could be achieved at a temperature range of 35 °C-45 °C. RPA for 30 min could produce enough products that could generate clearly visible electrophoresis bands and were adequate for subsequent LFD analysis. The RPA products can be visually detected by the naked eyes through an LFD after an automatic chromatography for 5 min at room temperature. The developed RPA-LFD was exclusively specific for K. veneficum and displayed no cross-reactivity with other algal species that are commonly distributed along the Chinese coast. In addition, the lowest detection limit of RPA-LFD was 10 ng μL-1 of genomic DNA and 0.1 cell mL-1, which was 100-fold sensitive than conventional PCR. In conclusion, the developed RPA-LFD assay in this study can be used as a rapid and sensitive method to monitor K. veneficum in the future.",Direct cloning and heterologous expression of natural product biosynthetic gene clusters by transformation-associated recombination.,https://www.ncbi.nlm.nih.gov/pubmed/31128791,Methods in enzymology,2019 06 10,"Heterologous expression of natural product biosynthetic gene clusters (BGCs) is a robust approach not only to decipher biosynthetic logic behind natural product (NP) biosynthesis, but also to discover new chemicals from uncharacterized BGCs. This approach largely relies on techniques used for cloning large BGCs into suitable expression vectors. Recently, several whole-pathway direct cloning approaches, including full-length RecE-mediated recombination in Escherichia coli, Cas9-assisted in vitro assembly, and transformation-associated recombination (TAR) in Saccharomyces cerevisiae, have been developed to accelerate BGC isolation. In this chapter, we summarize a protocol for TAR cloning large NP BGCs, detailing the process of choosing TAR plasmids, designing pathway-specific TAR vectors, generating yeast spheroplasts, performing yeast transformation, and heterologously expressing BGCs in various host strains. We believe that the established platforms can accelerate the process of discovering new NPs, understanding NP biosynthetic logic, and engineering biosynthetic pathways.",A guide for drug inducible transcriptional activation with HIT systems.,https://www.ncbi.nlm.nih.gov/pubmed/31128790,Methods in enzymology,2019 05 26,"Precise investigation and manipulation of gene function often require modulation in a controlled and dynamic manner.

An aliquot of the electrolyte solution (1μL) is dropped into an organic solvent, and the droplet sinks to the drop-in-well at the bottom, where two monolayer-lined droplets come in contact to form the bilayer. Pre-installed electrodes allow electrophysiological measurements. The detailed drop-in-well method is presented, and some variations of the method, such as the use of microelectrodes and a sheet with a small hole for low-noise recordings, are extended.

Genomic aptamers constitute the ligand-binding domains of riboswitches, whereas synthetic aptamers find applications as diagnostic and therapeutic tools, and as ligand-binding domains of regulatory RNAs in synthetic biology. Discovery and characterization of aptamers has been limited by a lack of high-throughput approaches that uncover the target-binding domains and the biochemical properties of individual sequences. With the advent of high-throughput sequencing, large-scale analysis of in vitro selected populations of aptamers (and catalytic nucleic acids, such as ribozymes and DNAzmes) became possible. In recent years the development of new experimental approaches and software tools has led to significant streamlining of the selection-pool analysis.

This approach enables the sensitive, PCR-amplifiable detection of individual ac4C sites from nanograms of unfractionated cellular RNA. The sensitive and quantitative nature of this assay provides a powerful tool to understand how cytidine acetylation is targeted, profile RNA acetyltransferase dynamics, and validate the sites and stoichiometry of ac4C in novel RNA species.",Improved sensitivity and resolution of in-cell NMR spectra.,https://www.ncbi.nlm.nih.gov/pubmed/31128785,Methods in enzymology,2019 05 26,"In-cell NMR spectroscopy is a powerful tool to study protein structures and interactions under near physiological conditions in both prokaryotic and eukaryotic living cells. The low sensitivity and resolution of in-cell NMR spectra and limited lifetime of cells over the course of an in-cell experiment have presented major hurdles to wide acceptance of the technique, limiting it to a few select systems. These issues are addressed by introducing the use of the CRINEPT pulse sequence to increase the sensitivity and resolution of in-cell NMR spectra and the use of a bioreactor to maintain cell viability for up to 24h. Application of advanced pulse sequences and bioreactor during in-cell NMR experiments will facilitate the exploration of a wide range of biological processes.",Cysteine-ethylation of tissue-extracted membrane proteins as a tool to detect conformational states by solid-state NMR spectroscopy.,https://www.ncbi.nlm.nih.gov/pubmed/31128784,Methods in enzymology,2019 05 26,"Solid-state NMR (ssNMR) is an ideal tool to study structure and dynamics of membrane proteins in their native lipid environment. In principle, ssNMR has no size limitations. However, this feature is rarely exploited as large membrane proteins display severe resonance overlap. In addition, dismal yields from recombinant bacterial expression systems limit severely spectroscopic characterization of membrane proteins. For very large mammalian membrane proteins, extraction from the original organism remains the most viable approach. In this case, NMR-observable nuclei must be introduced post-translationally, but the approaches developed so far are rather scarce. Here, we detail the synthesis and engineering of a reactive 13C-ethylmethanethiosulfonate (13C-EMTS) reagent for the post-translational alkylation of cysteine sidechains of a 110kDa sarcoplasmic reticulum Ca2+-ATPase (SERCA) extracted from rabbit skeletal muscle tissue. When reconstituted into liposomes, it is possible to resolve the resonances of the engineered ethyl groups by magic-angle spinning (MAS) 2D [13C,13C]-DARR experiments. Notably, the ethyl-group modification does not perturb the function of SERCA, yielding well-resolved 13C-13C fingerprints that are used to image its structural states in the catalytic cycle and filtering out overwhelming naturally-abundant 13C nuclei signals arising from the enzyme and lipids. We anticipate that this approach will be used together with 19F NMR to monitor conformational transitions of enzymes and proteins that are difficult to express recombinantly.",Quick-soaking of crystals reveals unprecedented insights into the catalytic mechanism of glycosyltransferases.,https://www.ncbi.nlm.nih.gov/pubmed/31128783,Methods in enzymology,2019 05 26,"Glycosyltransferases (GTs) catalyze the transfer of a sugar moiety from nucleotide-sugar or lipid-phospho-sugar donors to a wide range of acceptor substrates, generating a remarkable amount of structural diversity in biological systems. Glycosyl transfer reactions can proceed with either inversion or retention of the anomeric configuration with respect to the sugar donor substrate. In this chapter, we discuss the application of a quick soaking method of substrates and products into protein crystals to visualize native ternary complexes of retaining glycosyltransferases. The crystal structures provide different snapshots of the catalytic cycle, including the Michaelis complex. During this sequence of events, we visualize how the enzyme guides the substrates into the reaction center where the glycosyl transfer reaction takes place, and unveil the mechanism of product release, involving multiple conformational changes not only in the substrates and products but also in the enzyme. The methodology described here provides unprecedented insights into the catalytic mechanism of glycosyltransferases at the molecular level, and can be applied to the study a myriad of enzymatic mediated reactions."

This methodology is based on the use of polyvinyl alcohol-based cryogels as a physical substitute for biologic soft tissues and of 3-D printed polymers for hard tissues, moulding and supporting elements. Thin and durable soft-tissue mimicking layers and multilayer arrangements can be obtained using these materials. Special attention was paid to the acoustic properties (sound speed, attenuation coefficient and mechanical impedance) of the materials developed to simulate soft tissues. These properties were characterized as a function of the additives concentration (propylene-glycol and alumina particles). The polyvinyl alcohol formulation proposed in this work is stable over several freeze-thaw cycles, allowing the manufacturing of multilayer materials with controlled properties. The manufacturing methodology presented was applied to the development of a phantom for high-frequency cranial ultrasonography in infants. This phantom was able to reproduce the main characteristics of the ultrasound images obtained in neonates through the anterior fontanel, down to 8-mm depth.","Association between exposure to the natural environment, rurality, and attention-deficit hyperactivity disorder in children in New Zealand: a linkage study.",https://www.ncbi.nlm.nih.gov/pubmed/31128768,The Lancet.

The aptasensor has been successfully designed by taking advantages of the Förster Resonance Energy Transfer (FRET) process and the super fluorescence quenching property of graphene oxide (GO) sheet. The sensing mechanism of the aptasensor is based on the conformational switch of the Pb2+-specific aptamer from a random coil to a G-quadruplex structure. An injection of Pb2+ on the paper-based platform induces the release of the specific aptamer from the GO surface that recovers the fluorescence emission. Under the optimal experimental conditions, there is a good linear relationship between the fluorescence recovery and the Pb2+concentration in the ranges of 5-70 pM and 0.07-20 nM. Moreover, the aptasensing array exhibits a high sensitivity to Pb2+ with an ultra-low detection limit of 0.5 pM.

In μID, the immunosensors were assembled with monoclonal antibody against CYFRA 21-1 covalently immobilized on graphene oxide previously deposited on the screen-printed carbon-based electrodes. Under optimized conditions, the method presented a good linear response for CYFRA 21-1 in the range of 3.9-1000 fg mL-1 achieving an ultralow limit of detection (LOD) of 0.19 fg mL-1. For comparison, Fe3O4 nanoparticles (FeONPs) was also synthetized and presented results slight inferior to that obtained with CoZnFeONPs.

Waterlogged archeological wood presents an accumulation of iron sulfides within its structure, which, after exposition to oxygen, lead to salt precipitation and acidification and so to the degradation of the wooden artifact. A new extraction method, based on the dissolution of iron sulfides by the use of bacteria could be an alternative to the current chemical extraction methods, as being more respectful and ecological. While A. ferrooxidans is very effective in mines and groundwater, in the field of conservation-restoration of wood, Thiobacillus denitrificans is a better candidate as it grows at neutral pH, which is less aggressive for organic substrates (wood here). Preliminary studies show the efficiency of T. denitrificans for the dissolution of iron sulfides, as the concentration of nitrates used as electron donors decreases while the concentration of sulfates produced increases without degrading the wooden matrix. Long-term behavior should be studied to assess the stability of the artifacts after treatment.",Implications of Perceived Dyspnea and Global Well-Being Measured by Visual Assessment Scales During Treatment for Acute Decompensated Heart Failure.,https://www.ncbi.nlm.nih.gov/pubmed/31128735,The American journal of cardiology,2019 05 26,"Symptomatic improvement through decongestive therapy is a cornerstone for treatment of acute decompensated heart failure (ADHF). Visual analog scales (VAS) are instruments that can capture patients' perceptions of dyspnea (DVAS) or global well-being (GVAS). However, the clinical implications of these instruments and their changes over time during treatment for ADHF need further clarification. DVAS and GVAS were collected in 657 patients randomized in the DOSE-AHF and ROSE-AHF trials. To determine factors associated with symptom change, multivariable predictors of changes in DVAS and GVAS over 72 hours were determined. In addition, time-to-event analyses determined the association between these assessments and post-discharge clinical outcomes. The median baseline DVAS and GVAS scores were 54 (interquartile range 35 to 76) and 50 (30 to 66), respectively. These scores increased from baseline to 72 hours (ΔDVAS 16 [0 to 35] and ΔGVAS 19 [2 to 37]). Although changes in both scales were associated with their baseline values, 72-hour change in NT-proBNP was associated with each scale in multivariable analysis. However, there were additional variables associated with 72-hour change in GVAS including 72-hour change in creatinine, implantable cardioverter-defibrillator presence, baseline loop diuretic dose, and 72-hour total loop diuretic dose. There were no consistent associations between DVAS or GVAS and clinical composite outcomes at 60 days. In conclusion, DVAS and GVAS may be related to different clinical factors during treatment for ADHF and VAS scores were not consistently associated with clinical outcomes in ADHF. These findings inform the utility of the DVAS and GVAS instruments as measurements of symptom change for future ADHF clinical trials and registries.",Cardiovascular Health and Disease Among Asian-Americans (from the National Health and Nutrition Examination Survey).,https://www.ncbi.nlm.nih.gov/pubmed/31128733,The American journal of cardiology,2019 05 26,"Variable propensity toward cardiovascular disease in the different ethnicities in the United States has been reported. We aimed to characterize the prevalence trends of cardiovascular health, as defined by the American Heart Association's Life's Simple 7 metrics, and cardiovascular diseases amongst Asian-Americans. We used the National Health and Examination Nutrition Survey from 2011 to 2016 capture self-identified American-born Asian-Americans and foreign-born Asian-Americans. The prevalence trends of cardiovascular health metrics and diseases were evaluated in Asian-Americans and also compared between American-born and foreign-born Asian-Americans. Results were presented as weighted percentages and odds ratios with 95% confidence intervals. From 2011-2012 to 2015-2016, the prevalence of Asian-Americans reporting no physical activity increased from 21.5% to 32.4% (p for linear trend = 0.001) and the prevalence of Asian-American participants reporting a healthy diet decreased from 44.1% to 36.8% (p for quadratic trend = 0.02). There was a concomitant decline in the prevalence of Asian-Americans with normal weight (body mass index <25 kg/m2) from 60.5% from 2011-2012 to 55.3% in 2015-2016 (p for linear trend = 0.04). The prevalence of congestive heart failure and chronic kidney disease increased over 2011-2012 to 2015-2016. Foreign-born Asian-Americans had lower odds of having a nonhealthy diet and blood pressure compared with American-born Asians. In conclusion, in the National Health and Examination Nutrition Survey 2011 to 2016 cycles, Asian-Americans exhibited a declining prevalence of healthy weight and an increasing prevalence of poor diet, physical activity levels, congestive heart failure, and chronic kidney disease. Foreign-born Asian-Americans also exhibited a different cardiometabolic risk profile compared with American-born Asian-Americans.",Metabolomic foundation for differential responses of lipid metabolism to nitrogen and phosphorus deprivation in an arachidonic acid-producing green microalga.,https://www.ncbi.nlm.nih.gov/pubmed/31128719,Plant science : an international journal of experimental plant biology,2019 05 26,"The green oleaginous microalga Lobosphaera incisa accumulates storage lipids triacylglycerols (TAG) enriched in the long-chain polyunsaturated fatty acid arachidonic acid under nitrogen (N) deprivation. In contrast, under phosphorous (P) deprivation, the production of the monounsaturated oleic acid prevails. We compared physiological responses, ultrastructural, and metabolic consequences of L. incisa acclimation to N and P deficiency to provide novel insights into the key determinants of ARA accumulation. Differential responses to nutrient deprivation on growth performance, carbon-to-nitrogen stoichiometry, membrane lipid composition and TAG accumulation were demonstrated. Ultrastructural analyses suggested a dynamic role for vacuoles in sustaining cell homeostasis under conditions of different nutrient availability and their involvement in autophagy in L. incisa. Paralleling ARA-rich TAG accumulation in lipid droplets, N deprivation triggered intensive chloroplast dismantling and promoted catabolic processes. Metabolome analysis revealed depletion of amino acids and pyrimidines, and repression of numerous biosynthetic hubs to favour TAG biosynthesis under N deprivation. Under P deprivation, despite the relatively low growth penalties, the presence of the endogenous P reserves and the characteristic lipid remodelling, metabolic signatures of energy deficiency were revealed. Metabolome adjustments to P deprivation included depletion in ATP and phosphorylated nucleotides, increased levels of TCA-cycle intermediates and osmoprotectants. We conclude that characteristic cellular and metabolome adjustments tailor the adaptive responses of L. incisa to N and P deprivation modulating its LC-PUFA production.","""Wild barley serves as a source for biofortification of barley grains"".",https://www.ncbi.nlm.nih.gov/pubmed/31128718,Plant science : an international journal of experimental plant biology,2019 05 26,"The continuing growth of the human population creates an inevitable necessity for higher crop yields, which are mandatory for the supply with adequate amounts of food. However, increasing grain yield may lead to a reduction of grain quality, such as a decline in protein and mineral nutrient concentrations causing the so-called hidden hunger. To assess the interdependence between quantity and quality and to evaluate the biofortification potential of wild barley, we conducted field studies, examining the interplay between plant development, yield, and nutrient concentrations, using HEB-YIELD, a subset of the wild barley nested association mapping population HEB-25. A huge variation of nutrient concentration in grains was obtained, since we identified lines with a more than 50% higher grain protein, iron, and zinc concentration in comparison to the recurrent parent 'Barke'. We observed a negative relationship between grain yield and nutritional value in barley, indicated by predominantly negative correlations between yield and nutrient concentrations. Analyzing the genetic control of nutrient concentration in mature grains indicated that numerous genomic regions determine the final nutritional value of grains and wild alleles were frequently associated with higher nutrient concentrations. The targeted introgression of wild barley alleles may enable biofortification in future barley breeding.",A late embryogenesis abundant protein GsPM30 interacts with a receptor like cytoplasmic kinase GsCBRLK and regulates environmental stress responses.,https://www.ncbi.nlm.nih.gov/pubmed/31128717,Plant science : an international journal of experimental plant biology,2019 05 26,"A Glycine soja receptor like cytoplasmic kinase GsCBRLK was previously characterized as a positive regulator of salt tolerance. However, how GsCBRLK regulates stress responses remains obscure. Here, we report the interaction between GsCBRLK and a group 3 late embryogenesis abundant protein GsPM30, and suggest its role in stress responses. GsPM30 was found to physically associate with GsCBRLK through yeast two hybrid assays, which was verified by bimolecular fluorescence complementation analysis. Deletion analyses showed that the N-terminal variable domain of GsCBRLK was sufficient for GsPM30 interaction. Besides GsPM30, GsCBRLK could associate with several group 3 LEAs, of which the N-terminus sequences show high identity with GsPM30. Lower binding affinity or even no interaction was observed between GsCBRLK and other group 3 LEAs, which are less closely related to GsPM30. Furthermore, we observed that GsPM30 could localize surrounding the internal circumference of plant cells, as well as in cytoplasm and nucleus. In addition, GUS staining and quantitative real-time PCR results suggested the ubiquitous expression in different tissues and induced expression by NaCl and mannitol treatments for GsPM30. Consistently, GsPM30 overexpression in Arabidopsis caused increased tolerance to high salinity and dehydration/water deficit at both the young and adult seedling stages. Our results demonstrated the interaction between GsCBRLK and LEAs, and revealed the positive role of GsPM30 in stress responses.","The multiple roles of OsmiR535 in modulating plant height, panicle branching and grain shape.",https://www.ncbi.nlm.nih.gov/pubmed/31128716,Plant science : an international journal of experimental plant biology,2019 05 26,"The miR156/miR529-SPL module acts a vital role in regulating plant growth and development. Though miR535 shows very high sequence identity to miR156 and miR529, it is still unknown whether miR535 could control plant growth and development. In this study, we performed the evolutionary analyses of miR535s in land plants and found that miR535s were less conserved than miR156s during evolution. In rice, miR535 expressed at a very low level during the vegetative growth but highly accumulated in young panicles, which is similar with OsmiR529, but opposite to OsmiR156. Expectedly, OsmiR535 overexpression in rice reduced plant height by decreasing the 1st and 2nd internode length. Furthermore, OsmiR535 overexpression imposed great influence in panicle architecture, such as more but shorter panicles, and fewer primary/secondary panicle branches. Moreover, OsmiR535 overexpression increased the grain length, but did not affect grain width. Through quantitative real-time PCR analyses, we further revealed that OsmiR535 overexpression repressed the expression of OsSPL7/12/16, as well as the OsSPLs downstream panicle related genes, including OsPIN1B, OsDEP1, OsLOG and OsSLR1. Taken together, our findings suggest that OsmiR535 multiply modulates plant height, panicle architecture and grain shape possibly by regulating OsSPLs genes in rice.",Phenolic distribution in apple epidermal and outer cortex tissue by multispectral deep-UV autofluorescence cryo-imaging.,https://www.ncbi.nlm.nih.gov/pubmed/31128715,Plant science : an international journal of experimental plant biology,2019 05 26,"Phenolic compounds in fruit are involved in responses to biotic and abiotic stresses and are responsible for organoleptic properties. To establish the distribution of these secondary metabolites at the tissue and sub-cellular scales, mapping of fluorescence in apple epidermis and outer cortex tissue in cryogenic condition was performed after deep-UV excitation at 275 nm. Douce Moën and Guillevic cider apple varieties were sampled and frozen after harvest, after 30 days at 4 °C and after 20 days at room temperature. Image analysis of fluorescence emission images acquired between 300 and 650 nm allowed the assignment of fluorescence signals to phenolic compound families based on reference molecules. Emission attributed to monomeric and/or condensed flavanol was localized in whole tissue with major fluorescence in the cuticle region. Hydroxycinnamic acids were found predominantly in the outer cortex and appeared in the cell wall. Fluorescent pigments were mostly found in the epidermis. The distribution of flavanols in the sub-cuticle and phenolic acids in the outer cortex distinguished apple varieties. Storage conditions had no impact on phenolic distribution. The proposed fluorescent imaging and analysis approach enables studies on phenolic distribution in relation to fruit development, biotic/abiotic stress resistance and quality.",Foliar-applied glutathione activates zinc transport from roots to shoots in oilseed rape.,https://www.ncbi.nlm.nih.gov/pubmed/31128714,Plant science : an international journal of experimental plant biology,2019 05 26,"Glutathione is a tripeptide involved in diverse aspects of plant metabolism. We investigated how the reduced form of glutathione, GSH, applied site-specifically to plants, affects zinc (Zn) distribution and behavior in oilseed rape plants (Brassica napus) cultured hydroponically. Foliar-applied GSH significantly increased the Zn content in shoots and the root-to-shoot Zn translocation ratio; furthermore, this treatment raised the Zn concentration in the cytosol of root cells and substantially enhanced Zn xylem loading. Notably, microarray analysis revealed that the gene encoding pectin methylesterase was upregulated in roots following foliar GSH treatment. We conclude that certain physiological signals triggered in response to foliar-applied GSH were transported via sieve tubes and functioned in root cells, which, in turn, increased Zn availability in roots by releasing Zn from their cell wall. Consequently, root-to-shoot translocation of Zn was activated and Zn accumulation in the shoot was markedly increased.",Elevated glutathione synthesis in leaves contributes to zinc transport from roots to shoots in Arabidopsis.,https://www.ncbi.nlm.nih.gov/pubmed/31128713,Plant science : an international journal of experimental plant biology,2019 05 26,"Glutathione (GSH) is a vital compound involved in several plant metabolic pathways. Our previous study indicated that foliar GSH application can increase zinc (Zn) levels in leafy vegetables. The objective of this study was to determine the mode of action of GSH as it relates to Zn transport from roots to shoots. Two types of transgenic Arabidopsis plants with genes for GSH synthesis, including StGCS-GS or AtGSH1 driven by the leaf-specific promoter of chlorophyll a/b-binding protein (pCab3) gene were generated. Both types of transgenic Arabidopsis plants showed significant increases in shoot GSH concentrations compared to the wild type (WT). Monitoring 65Zn movement by positron-emitting tracer imaging system (PETIS) analysis indicated that the 65Zn amount in the shoots of both types of transgenic Arabidopsis plants were higher than that in the WT. GSH concentration in phloem sap was increased significantly in WT with foliar applications of 10 mM GSH (WT-GSH), but not in transgenic Arabidopsis with elevated foliar GSH synthesis. Both types of transgenic Arabidopsis with elevated foliar GSH synthesis and WT-GSH exhibited increased shoot Zn concentrations and Zn translocation ratios. These results suggest that enhancement of endogenous foliar GSH synthesis and exogenous foliar GSH application affect root-to-shoot transport of Zn."

Tropane alkaloids such as scopolamine and hyoscyamine are used in modern medicine to treat pain, motion sickness, as eye pupil dilators and antidotes against organo-phosphate poisoning. Hyoscyamine is converted to 6β-hydroxyhyoscyamine (anisodamine) and scopolamine by hyoscyamine 6β-hydroxylase (H6H), a 2-oxoglutarate dependent dioxygenase. We describe here a marked chemo-diversity in the tropane alkaloid content in Mandragora spp. M. officinarum and M. turcomanica lack anisodamine and scopolamine but display up to 10 fold higher hyoscyamine levels as compared with M. autumnalis. Transcriptomic analyses revealed that H6H is highly conserved among scopolamine-producing Solanaceae. MoH6H present in M. officinarum differs in several amino acid residues including a homozygotic mutation in the substrate binding region of the protein and its prevalence among accessions was confirmed by Cleaved-Amplified-Polymorphic-Sequence analyses. Functional expression revealed that MaH6H, a gene isolated from M. autumnalis encodes an active H6H enzyme while the MoH6H sequence isolated from M. officinarum was functionally inactive. A single G to T mutation in nucleotide 663 of MoH6H is associated with the lack of anisodamine and scopolamine in M. officinalis.",GSK3/shaggy-like kinase 1 ubiquitously regulates cell growth from Arabidopsis to Moso bamboo (Phyllostachys edulis).,https://www.ncbi.nlm.nih.gov/pubmed/31128699,Plant science : an international journal of experimental plant biology,2019 05 26,"Moso bamboo (Phyllostachys edulis) is one of the fastest growing species with a maximum growth rate of 1 m/day. However, the regulator genes for this explosive growth phenomenon have not been functionally studied. Here, we found that Moso bamboo GSK3/shaggy-like kinase 1 (PeGSK1) acts as a negative regulator of cell growth. Over-expression of PeGSK1 in Arabidopsis showed significant growth arrest phenotypes, including dwarfism, small leaves, reduced cell length, and disturbed cell elongation of petiole. Furthermore, Overexpression of PeGSK1 fully inhibited the longer hypocotyl phenotype of Arabidopsis atgsk1 mutants. In addition, PeGSK1-overexpressing lines were resistant to exogenous BR treatment and PeGSK1 interacted with the brassinosteroid signal transduction key regulator BZR1. The BZR1-dependent cell growth genes were down-regulated in PeGSK1-overexpressing lines. These results indicated that PeGSK1 is functionally similar to AtGSK1 and inhibited cell growth via the brassinosteroid signaling pathway. Importantly, PeGSK1 also interacted with PeBZR1, and the expression pattern of PeGSK1 was negatively correlated with the internode elongation of bamboo, indicating that PeGSK1 is involved in the cell growth of bamboo. In summary, our results provide insight into the role of brassinosteroids in the rapid-growth of bamboo culms and identifying target genes for the genetic manipulation of plant height.",Adaptation strategies of forage soybeans cultivated on acidic soils under cool climate to produce high quality forage.,https://www.ncbi.nlm.nih.gov/pubmed/31128698,Plant science : an international journal of experimental plant biology,2019 05 26,"Boreal soils tend to be podzols characterized by acidic pH, which can further limit forage crop growth and production. It is unclear, how forage soybeans adopt to produce forage with high nutritional quality when cultivated on podzols in boreal climate. To answer this question, we cultivated forage soybeans on agricultural podzols at 3 farm sites with varied soil pH (6.8, 6.0 or 5.1), and assessed the root membrane lipidome remodeling response to such climatic conditions. Contrary to our expectations, significantly lower biomass was observed at pH 6.8 compared to 6.0 and 5.1. However, surprisingly the plants produced similar forage quality at 6.8 and 5.1 pH. Three major lipid classes including phospholipids, glycolipids and phytosterols were observed in roots irrespective of soil pH. Phosphatidylcholine (PC), phosphatidylethanolamine (PE), phosphatidic acid (PA), and acylated glucosyl betasitosterol ester (AGlcSiE) accounted for 95% of the root lipidome, and expressed significant changes in response to cultivation across the three soil pH levels. These lipids were also observed to have strong correlations with forage production, and forage quality. Therefore, soybean genotypes with higher abilities to remodel PC, PE, PA, and AGlcSiE could be better suited for producing higher quality forage in acid podzolic soils characteristics of boreal ecosystems.","The study of hormonal metabolism of Trincadeira and Syrah cultivars indicates new roles of salicylic acid, jasmonates, ABA and IAA during grape ripening and upon infection with Botrytis cinerea.",https://www.ncbi.nlm.nih.gov/pubmed/31128697,Plant science : an international journal of experimental plant biology,2019 05 26,"Hormones play an important role in fruit ripening and in response to biotic stress. Nevertheless, analyses of hormonal profiling during plant development and defense are scarce. In this work, changes in hormonal metabolism in grapevine (Vitis vinifera) were compared between a susceptible (Trincadeira) and a tolerant (Syrah) variety during grape ripening and upon infection with Botrytis cinerea. Infection of grapes with the necrotrophic pathogen Botrytis cinerea leads to significant economic losses worldwide. Peppercorn-sized fruits were infected in the field and mock-treated and infected berries were collected at green, veraison and harvest stages for hormone analysis and targeted qPCR analysis of genes involved in hormonal metabolism and signaling. Results indicate a substantial reprogramming of hormonal metabolism during grape ripening and in response to fungal attack. Syrah and Trincadeira presented differences in the metabolism of abscisic acid (ABA), indole-3-acetic acid (IAA) and jasmonates during grape ripening that may be connected to fruit quality. On the other hand, high basal levels of salicylic acid (SA), jasmonates and IAA at an early stage of ripening, together with activated SA, jasmonates and IAA signaling, likely enable a fast defense response leading to grape resistance/ tolerance towards B. cinerea. The balance among the different phytohormones seems to depend on the ripening stage and on the intra-specific genetic background and may be fundamental in providing resistance or susceptibility. In addition, this study indicated the involvement of SA and IAA in defense against necrotrophic pathogens and gains insights into possible strategies for conventional breeding and/or gene editing aiming at improving grape quality and grape resistance against Botrytis cinerea.",A novel approach for real-time monitoring of leaf wounding responses demonstrates unprecedently fast and high emissions of volatiles from cut leaves.,https://www.ncbi.nlm.nih.gov/pubmed/31128696,Plant science : an international journal of experimental plant biology,2019 05 26,"Wounding is a key plant stress that results in a rapid, within seconds to a few minutes, release of ubiquitous stress volatiles and stored volatiles in species with storage structures. Understanding the timing and extent of wound-dependent volatile elicitation is needed to gain an insight into different emission controls, but real-time monitoring of plant emissions through wounding treatments has been hampered by the need to stop the measurements to perform the wounding, slow stabilization of gas flows upon chamber closure and smearing out the signal by large chambers and long sampling lines. We developed a novel leaf cutter that allows to rapidly perform highly precise leaf cuts within the leaf chamber. The cutter was fitted to the standard Walz GFS-3000 portable gas-exchange system leaf chamber and chamber exhaust air for analysis with a proton transfer reaction time-of-flight mass-spectrometer (PTR-TOF-MS) was taken right at the leaf chamber outlet. Wounding experiments in four species of contrasting leaf structure demonstrated significant species differences in timing, extent and blend of emitted volatiles, and showed unprecedently high emission rates of several stress volatiles and stored monoterpenes. In light of the rapid rise of release of de novo synthesized and stored volatiles, the results of this study suggest that past studies have underestimated the rate of elicitation and maximum emission rates of wound-dependent volatiles.",Chrysanthemum requires short-day repeats for anthesis: Gradual CsFTL3 induction through a feedback loop under short-day conditions.,https://www.ncbi.nlm.nih.gov/pubmed/31128695,Plant science : an international journal of experimental plant biology,2019 05 26,"Chrysanthemums require continuous short-days (SD) for anthesis. FTL3 (FLOWERING LOCUS T-like 3), a floral promoter expressed in chrysanthemum leaf, forms a complex with its interacting partner FDL1 to induce floral meristem identity gene AFL1. We explored the FTL3 induction mechanism during SD repeats in Chrysanthemum seticuspe. CsFTL3 expression was not immediately induced by a shift from long-day (LD) to SD, but gradually increased until the capitulum development stage under repeated SDs. Overexpression of CsFTL3 transgene increased endogenous leaf CsFTL3 induction under SD but not LD. Overexpression of CsFDL1 promoted anthesis and increased CsAFL1 and CsFTL3 expression under SD. Loss-of-function of CsFDL1 by RNAi resulted in delayed anthesis and downregulation of leaf CsAFL1 and CsFTL3, indicating the necessity of CsFDL1 for CsFTL3 induction. Overexpression of an antagonistic protein of CsFTL3 or CsFDL1 inhibited leaf CsFTL3 induction. CsFTL3 expression was positively regulated during SDs by a feedback mechanism involving the CsFTL3-CsFDL1 complex. Furthermore, flowering was accomplished by feedback with high levels of CsFTL3 induction under repeated SDs.",AtSPX1-mediated transcriptional regulation during leaf senescence in Arabidopsis thaliana.,https://www.ncbi.nlm.nih.gov/pubmed/31128694,Plant science : an international journal of experimental plant biology,2019 05 26,"Leaf senescence is the final stage of leaf growth, a highly coordinated and complicated process. Phosphorus as an essential macronutrient for plant growth is remobilized from senescing leaves to other vigorous parts of the plant. In this study, through data mining, we found some phosphate starvation induced genes such as AtSPX1, were significantly induced in aging leaves in Arabidopsis. We applied a reverse genetics approach to investigate the phenotypes of transgenic plants and mutant plants, and the results showed that the overexpression of AtSPX1 accelerated leaf senescence, suppressed Pi accumulation, promoted SA production and H2O2 levels in leaves, while the mutant lines of AtSPX1 showed slightly delayed leaf senescence. We conducted RNA-seq-based transcriptome analysis together with GO and GSEA enrichment analyses for transgenic vs. wild-type plants to elucidate the possible underlying regulatory mechanism. The 558 genes that were up-regulated in the overexpression plants 35S::AtSPX1/WT, were significantly enriched in the process of leaf senescence, Pi starvation responses and SA signaling pathways, as were the target genes of some transcription factors such as WRKYs and NACs. In a word, we characterized AtSPX1 as a key regulator, which mediated the crosstalks among leaf senescence, Pi starvation and SA signaling pathways in Arabidopsis thaliana.","Nitrogen differentially modulates photosynthesis, carbon allocation and yield related traits in two contrasting Capsicum chinense cultivars.",https://www.ncbi.nlm.nih.gov/pubmed/31128692,Plant science : an international journal of experimental plant biology,2019 05 26,"Yield-related traits of Capsicum chinense are highly dependent on coordination between vegetative and reproductive growth, since the formation of reproductive tissues occurs iteratively in new sympodial bifurcations. In this study, we used two C. chinense cultivars (Biquinho and Habanero), contrasting for fruit size and fruit set, to investigate the responses of nitrogen (N) deficiency and excess on growth, photosynthesis, carbon (C) and N metabolisms as well as yield-related traits. Both cultivars increased biomass allocation to leaves in conditions of higher N supply and exhibited a parabolic behavior for fruit biomass allocation. Plants growing under N-deficiency produced a lower number of flowers and heavier fruits. Contrarily, plants under high N condition tended to decrease their CO2 assimilation rate, harvest index and fruit weight. Biquinho, the cultivar with lower fruit size and higher fruit set, was initially less affected by excess of N due to its continuous formation of new reproductive sinks in relation to Habanero (which has lower fruit set and higher fruit size). The results suggest that N amount influences sucrose supply to different organs and can differentially affect yield-related traits between Capsicum cultivars with contrasting source-sink relations.",Structural and metabolic alterations in root systems under limited water conditions in forage grasses of Lolium-Festuca complex.,https://www.ncbi.nlm.nih.gov/pubmed/31128691,Plant science : an international journal of experimental plant biology,2019 05 26,"Drought resistance is a crucial attribute of plants and to properly decipher its mechanisms, a valuable plant model is required. Lolium multiflorum is a forage grass characterized by a low level of abiotic stress resistance, whereas Festuca arundinacea is recognized as a species with drought resistance, including both stress avoidance and tolerance strategies. These two species can be crossed with each other. Two closely related L. multiflorum/F. arundinacea introgression forms with distinct levels of field drought resistance were involved, thus enabling the dissection of this complex trait into its crucial components. The processes occurring in roots were shown to be the most significant for the expression of drought resistance. Thus, the analysis was focused on the root architecture and the accumulation of selected hormones, primary metabolites and glycerolipids in roots. The introgression form, with a higher resistance to field water deficit was characterized by a deeper soil penetration by its roots, and it had a higher accumulation level of primary metabolites, including well recognized osmoprotectants, such as proline, sucrose or maltose, and an increase in phosphatidylcholine to phosphatidylethanolamine ratio compared to the low resistant form. A comprehensive model of root performance under water deficit conditions is presented here for the first time for the grass species of the Lolium-Festuca complex.",Interspecific hybridization improves the performance of Lotus spp. under saline stress.,https://www.ncbi.nlm.nih.gov/pubmed/31128690,Plant science : an international journal of experimental plant biology,2019 05 26,"Salinity is one of the most frequent limiting conditions in pasture production for grazing livestock. Legumes, such as Lotus spp. with high forage quality and capable of adapting to different environments, improves pasture performance in restrictive areas. In order to determine potential cultivars with better forage traits, the current study assess the response to salt stress of L. tenuis, L. corniculatus and a novel L. tenuis x L. corniculatus accession. For this purpose, chlorophyll fluorescence, biomass production, ion accumulation and anthocyanins and proanthocyanidins levels have been evaluated in control and salt-treated plants PSII activity was affected by salt in L. tenuis, but not in L. corniculatus or hybrid plants. Analyzed accessions showed similar values of biomass, Na+ and K+ levels after salt treatment. Increasing Cl- concentrations were observed in all accessions. However, hybrid plants accumulate Cl- in stems at higher levels than their parental. At the same time, the levels of anthocyanins considerably increased in L. tenuis x L. corniculatus stems. Chloride and anthocyanin accumulation in stems could explain the best performance of hybrid plants after a long saline treatment. Finally, as proanthocyanidins levels were no affected by salt, L. tenuis x L. corniculatus plants maintained adequate levels to be used as ruminant feed. In conclusion, these results suggest that hybrid plants have a high potential to be used as forage on salt-affected lands. High Cl- and anthocyanins accumulation in Lotus spp. stems seems to be a trait associated to salinity tolerance, with the possibility of being used in legume breeding programs."

However, there exist wide variation between researchers in defining an appropriate range of THI values for denoting different levels of stress. The present study was aimed to reassess previously described heat stress indicators of dairy cattle of sub-tropical region of India. From comparative evaluation of meteorological data over previous four years (2014-2017) the period of year when high THI prevailed in the region was determined. Accordingly, the time period of sample collection and observation on animals was decided, so that a THI range of 68-86 could be covered. After analyzing physiological, biochemical parameters and expression profile of heat shock response (HSR) genes of animals in response to different THI, it was evident from the study that animal undergoes few or little changes at THI 72, but major physiological changes occurred after THI reached 74. At THI range 74-79, no drastic change in these parameters occurred suggesting animals undergo transient acclimatization in this range to maintain homeostasis. Once THI reached and crossed 80, this homeostasis was perturbed and animals experienced major physiological changes again. Overall, the study suggests that THI values indicating level of heat stress are dependent on the geographic location, as well as type of animal and therefore, existing THI should be recalibrated for different climatic region for accurate assessment of the heat stress.",Thermotolerance indicators related to production and physiological responses to heat stress of holstein cows.,https://www.ncbi.nlm.nih.gov/pubmed/31128664,Journal of thermal biology,2019 05 26,"Heat stress (HS) adversely influences dairy cattle welfare and productivity. This study aimed to investigate the effects of HS on production and physiological parameters of Holstein cows. Two experiments each lasted 6 weeks were conducted in four Tunisian farms, firstly during summer under HS (n = 80, THI = 77) and later during autumn under thermo-neutral (n = 80, THI = 54) conditions. Respiration rate (RR), skin temperature (ST), rectal temperature (RT) and milk yield were measured, and milk samples were collected on 2 days every week during each experimental period. Temperature and relative humidity were measured inside the barn to calculate the temperature-humidity index (THI). Mixed models were used to evaluate the effects of period and the relationships between THI and physiological and production traits. Reaction norm models were applied to quantify the individual responses of cows across the trajectory of THI during the HS period. A clustering methodology was developed to identify tolerant and sensitive cows to HS based on their slope for response of physiological and production traits during HS period. In summer, RR (61 breaths/min) and ST (37.7 °C) were 2.3- and 1.3-fold higher, whereas milk yield per milking was 24% lower compared with thermo-neutral conditions. Linear relationship between THI and RR, ST and RT was observed and showed increases by 2 breaths/min, 0.5 °C and 0.04 °C per increase in one THI unit, respectively. Inversely, milk, fat and protein yields showed a drop of 0.13 kg, 0.4 g and 0.3 g per milking per increase in one THI unit, respectively. Cows qualified to be heat tolerant by our work tended to have higher RR, ST, and RT and lower to almost no decay in milk yield compared to cows qualified to be heat sensitive. Specifically, RR could be used as a reliable indicator for thermotolerance. The results of this study deepen our understanding of different aspects of HS resilience.",Thermal and cardiovascular responses and thermal sensation during hot-water bathing and the influence of room temperature.,https://www.ncbi.nlm.nih.gov/pubmed/31128663,Journal of thermal biology,2019 05 26,"The aim of the present study was to clarify physical risks during hot-water bathing by measuring thermal and cardiovascular responses and thermal sensation. Young men and women (n = 7 and 5, respectively) participated in the present study, which consisted of two trials mimicking bathing behavior at room temperature of 25 °C and 15 °C. Participants bathed in 41 °C water for 20 min to the subclavian level. Before bathing, participants rested fully clothed for 15 min and then rested for 15 min without clothes. After bathing, they rested without clothes for 15 min and afterwards rested fully clothed for another 15 min. Tympanic temperature (Tty), heart rates (HR), mean skin temperature (Tsk), mean arterial pressure (MAP), and laser-Doppler flow at the chest and forehead (LDFhead and LDFchest) were evaluated. Thermal perception was assessed with a visual analogue scale. Mean Tsk in the 15 °C trial decreased during the period without clothing while MAP increased. The value remained unchanged in the 25 °C trial. During bathing, Tty, mean Tsk, HR, LDFhead, and LDFchest increased in both trials, and MAP decreased to similar levels. Relative change in LDFchest was greater in the 15 °C trial than in the 25 °C trial. Participants felt cold when they were without clothes at 15 °C; however, the thermal perception during bathing was similar between the two trials. Greater changes in cardiovascular and thermal responses were observed during the bathing behavior. In addition, bathing in cold room augmented the changes, which may induce some physical risks during bathing.","Attributable risk of mortality associated with heat and heat waves: A time-series study in Kerman, Iran during 2005-2017.",https://www.ncbi.nlm.nih.gov/pubmed/31128662,Journal of thermal biology,2019 05 26,"The association between heat or heat waves and mortality should often be reported in a way that makes it sensible by health policymakers. In this study we aimed to assess the effect of heat and heat waves on mortality using attributable risks during 2005-2017. Nine heat waves were defined using a combination of severity and duration of mean daily temperature. Heat wave effects were assessed using added and main effects. Added effects were assessed as a binary variable and main effects were assessed by comparing the median temperature (in heat wave days) to Minimum Mortality Temperature (MMT). The effects of heat, mild heat and extreme heat on mortality were also assessed. Distributed Lag Non-linear Models were used to assess the relations in a bi-dimensional perspective in which the quadratic b-spline was chosen as the basis function for the dimension of the exposure and the natural cubic b-spline was chosen for lag dimension. The backward perspective was used to estimate the attributable risks. The total mortality attributed to non-optimal temperatures for all days was 1.91% (CI 95%: -6.36, 8.47). The attributable risks (AR) were 2.23%, 2.02% and 0.25% for heat, mild heat and extreme heat days, respectively. AR was more for females and the above 65 years old groups than other groups in heat, mild heat and extreme heat days. While the stronger heat waves defined based on temperature above the 95 and 98th percentile had a significant attributable risk for total mortality in the added effects; the weaker heat waves (defined based on temperature above of the 90th percentile (HW1, HW2, HW3) had higher attributable risks, significant for HW1 and HW2, in the main effects. Apparently weaker heat waves show more immediate effects, while stronger heat waves increase mortality over several days.",Protective effect of resveratrol against hepatic damage induced by heat stress in a rat model is associated with the regulation of oxidative stress and inflammation.,https://www.ncbi.nlm.nih.gov/pubmed/31128661,Journal of thermal biology,2019 05 26,"Heat stress jeopardizes humans and animals health, and results in enormous economic loss in public health care and livestock production. The aim of this study was to investigate the effects of resveratrol on hepatic oxidative stress and inflammation in heat-stressed rats. Male Sprague-Dawley rats were orally fed with 100 mg resveratrol/kg body weight/day prior to heat stress (40 ∘C per day for 1.5 h) exposure for 3 consecutive days. Serum and liver samples were collected for the analysis of hepatic injury, redox status and immune response. The results showed that the heat-stress-induced increased aspartate aminotransferase activities in the serum, aberrant hepatic histology, excessive hepatic malondialdehyde and tumor necrosis factor alpha concentrations, and up-regulation of heat shock protein 70, superoxide dismutase 1, glutathione peroxidase 1, toll-like receptor 4 and interleukin 10 mRNA expression in the liver were mitigated by oral resveratrol treatment. Collectively, the beneficial effects of resveratrol on hepatic damage induced by heat stress were associated with the regulation of oxidative stress and inflammation.",Baicalin protects mouse testis from injury induced by heat stress.,https://www.ncbi.nlm.nih.gov/pubmed/31128660,Journal of thermal biology,2019 05 26,"Heat stress has been documented to reduce reproductive performance of female animals through injury to germ cells, with few studies available in male animals. The objectives of this study were to evaluate protective effects of baicalin on testicular tissue damage of mice subjected to heat stress and its related mechanisms. In this experiment, A total of forty mice were divided into four groups, including control group (C), baicalin group (B), heat stressed group (H) and heat stress with baicalin treatment (H + B) group. Morphological changes, activities of antioxidant enzymes and apoptosis-related parameters in the mice testes tissue were monitored. The results showed that the process of spermatogenesis in mice testis was impaired and the cellular apoptosis increased due to acute heat stress at 41 °C. Interestingly, the tissue damage was alleviated with the significant (P < 0.05) increase in the activities of SOD, CAT and GSH-Px enzymes, decrease (P < 0.05) in MDA content and number of cellular apoptosis recorded in mice of H + B group compared with those in mice from H group. In addition, the Fas, FasL and P-JNK protein expressions were significantly (P < 0.05) increased; and apaf-1, caspase-3, -9 were slightly expressed in the H group, while there was no difference in Bcl-2 expression, compared with C, B and H + B groups. The above results clearly indicate that heat stress induces macroscopic/apoptotic and oxidative changes in the testicular tissue of mice; these changes are alleviated by Baicalin through increasing anti-oxidative enzyme activities and possibly through blocking Fas/FasL pathway.","Revisiting the dermatomal recruitment of, and pressure-dependent influences on, human eccrine sweating.",https://www.ncbi.nlm.nih.gov/pubmed/31128659,Journal of thermal biology,2019 05 26,"Herein we describe two experiments in which the recruitment and pressure-induced modifications of human eccrine sweating were investigated. In one experiment, the longstanding belief that glandular recruitment follows a gradual, caudal-to-rostral (dermatomal) recruitment pattern was re-evaluated. The onset of sweating was simultaneously determined (ventilated capsules) from four spinal (dermatomal) segments (forehead, dorsal hand, lower chest and dorsal foot) during the passive heating of supine participants (N = 8). No evidence was found to support either dermatomal or simultaneous glandular recruitment patterns. Instead, the results were more consistent with individualised (random) patterns of regional activation (P > 0.05), with significant time delays among sites. Such delays in the appearance of discharged sweat may reflect differences in neurotransmitter sensitivity, precursor sweat production or ductal reabsorption. In the second experiment, the pressure-induced hemihidrotic reflex (contralateral sudomotor enhancement) was revisited, using pressures applied over 10 cm2 areas of the chest (left side: 6 N cm-2) and left heel (3 N cm-2) during both supine and seated postures (N = 12). Participants were passively heated and thermally clamped before pressure application. Hemihidrosis was not observed from the contralateral surfaces within the same (chest) or lower spinal segments (abdomen; both P > 0.05) during chest pressure, but a generalised enhancement followed heel pressure when supine. We suggest that previous observations of hemihidrosis possibly resulted from elevated heat storage, rather than a neural reflex. Chest pressure significantly inhibited ipsilateral sweating (forehead, hand, chest; all P < 0.05), and that influence is hypothesised to result from interactions between ascending mechanoreceptor afferents and the descending sudomotor pathways.","Interactive effects of experimental heating rates, ontogeny and body mass on the upper thermal limits of anuran larvae.",https://www.ncbi.nlm.nih.gov/pubmed/31128658,Journal of thermal biology,2019 05 26,"Biological and methodological factors influence the upper thermal limits (UTL) of ectothermic animals, but most factors have been studied independently. Few studies have integrated variables, so our understanding about sources of UTL variation remains fragmentary. Thereby, we investigated synergic effects of experimental protocols (heating rates, ΔTs) and biological factors (ontogeny and body mass) on the UTL on the larvae of two anuran species (Physalaemus nattereri and Boana pardalis), specifically their Critical Thermal Maximum (CTmax). The species displayed slightly different responses to ΔTs: In B. pardalis tadpoles both average and variance of CTmax increased at a fastest ΔT, the same response happened in P. nattereri tadpoles at slow and moderate ΔTs. Also, the CTmax of P. nattereri declined at the end of metamorphosis independently of ΔT, but tadpoles at all developmental stages still displayed higher heat tolerance at the slow ΔT. Finally, we detected small, synergic effects of body mass and ΔTs on the CTmax of both species. In small B. pardalis tadpoles and premetamorphic P. nattereri tadpoles, body mass had a positive effect on CTmax, but only at slow and moderate ΔTs, probably indicating physiological responses. A similar trend was observed in large B. pardalis tadpoles at the fast ΔT, but this result is likely to be influenced by thermal inertia. Our findings contribute to integrate the understanding of factors influencing UTL in small ectothermic animals. This understanding is critical to discuss the physiological component of vulnerability to climate change that is related to acute temperatures.",Genome-wide association study on the body temperature changes of a broiler-type strain Taiwan country chickens under acute heat stress.,https://www.ncbi.nlm.nih.gov/pubmed/31128657,Journal of thermal biology,2019 05 26,"Body temperature is the simplest parameter for evaluating the physiological conditions of animals under thermal stress. Genome-wide association studies (GWAS) have identified candidate genes related to economic traits in domestic animals. The present study conducted a GWAS on body temperature changes in a broiler-type strain Taiwan country chickens (TCCs) under acute heat stress. A total of two hundred 30-week-old roosters of a broiler-type strain TCCs were used. The roosters were subjected to acute heat stress at 38 °C for 4 h, and their body temperature was recorded before and during heat stress. The change in body temperature (ΔT) of each rooster was calculated according to the difference between the initial temperature and the highest body temperature during heat stress. The roosters were categorized according to survival and ΔT at the end into dead, susceptible, resistant, and intermediate groups. Collected red blood cells were genotyped using a 600 K chicken single-nucleotide polymorphism (SNP) array. A GWAS for ΔT was conducted using the Cochran-Armitage trend test. Significant SNPs were annotated as candidate genes according to the nearest genes. Results indicated that the ΔT of the heat-resistant group was significantly lower than that of the heat-susceptible group. A total of 17 SNPs belonging to 8 candidate genes, 352 SNPs for 78 candidate genes, and 174 significant SNPs for 63 candidate genes were identified in the association analyses in the dead vs. survival, resistant vs. susceptible, and intermediate vs. susceptible groups, respectively. The annotated candidate genes are associated with apoptosis, cellular response to external stimuli, and signal transduction pathways. In conclusion, the significant SNPs located in and proximal to genes in the GWAS analysis were related to apoptosis or responses to external stimuli which serve as potential candidates underlying physiological adaptation to heat stress or thermotolerance in chickens.",Thermogenic and psychogenic sweating in humans: Identifying eccrine glandular recruitment patterns from glabrous and non-glabrous skin surfaces.,https://www.ncbi.nlm.nih.gov/pubmed/31128655,Journal of thermal biology,2019 05 26,"In this experiment, psychogenic (mental arithmetic), thermogenic (mean body temperature elevation of 0.6 °C) and combined thermo-psychogenic treatments were used to explore eccrine sweat-gland recruitment from glabrous (volar hand and forehead) and non-glabrous skin surfaces (chest). It was hypothesised that each treatment would activate the same glands, and that glandular activity would be intermittent. Nine individuals participated in a single trial with normothermic and mildly hyperthermic phases. When normothermic, a 10-min arithmetical challenge was administered, during which sudomotor activity was recorded. Following passive heating and thermal clamping, sweating responses were again evaluated (10 min). A second arithmetical challenge (10 min) was administered during clamped hyperthermia, with its sudorific impact recorded. The activity of individual sweat glands was recorded at 60-s intervals, using precisely positioned, and uniformly applied, starch-iodide papers. Those imprints were digitised and analysed. Peak activity typically occurred during the thermo-psychogenic treatment, revealing physiologically active densities of 128 (volar hand), 165 (forehead) and 77 glands.cm-2 (chest). Except for the hand (46%), glands uniquely activated by one treatment were consistently <10% of the total glands identified. Glandular activations were most commonly of an intermittent nature, particularly during the thermogenic treatment. Accordingly, we accepted the hypothesis that psychogenic, thermogenic and thermo-psychogenic stimuli activate the same sweat glands in both the glabrous and non-glabrous regions. In addition, this investigation has provided detailed descriptions of the intermittent nature of sweat-gland activity, revealing that a consistent proportion of the physiologically active glands are recruited during these thermal and non-thermal stimuli."

Broiler chickens were distributed into 4 groups and fed diets with dietary MO at 0% or 5% (MO0 or MO5) and raised under ambient temperature 22 ± 1 °C (N) or 35±1 °C (HS). HS conditions negatively affected the weight gain and FCR, while feeding MO exhibited beneficial effects especially under HS conditions. Triglycerides, total cholesterol and low-density lipoprotein cholesterol (LDL) levels were significantly (P < 0.05) higher in chickens raised in HS conditions and fed the basal diet than those in normal condition and fed with or without MO, while MO decreased triglycerides and total cholesterol levels in normal and HS conditions. Blood high-density lipoprotein cholesterol (HDL) was significantly decreased in broilers raised in HS conditions and fed diets without MO, while MO increased HDL level. Blood glutathione peroxidase (GSH-Px) was significantly (P < 0.05) decreased in broilers raised in HS conditions and fed the basal diet without MO. mRNA expression of GSH-Px was significantly (P < 0.05) downregulated in broilers raised in HS conditions and fed diets without MO.

Clustering has significant physiological and ecological benefits, promoting successful hibernation of individuals. Such aggregations may help maintain optimal temperatures, allowing better energy utilisation than in solitarily bats. However, aroused bats in a cluster could conceivably disturb those still hibernating, starting an energy-demanding arousal process. Our study was conducted over two winters in two different hibernacula (cave and mine) in the Czech Republic, where Greater mouse-eared bats (Myotis myotis) have previously been diagnosed with white-nose syndrome. In 118 arousal episodes we recorded 193 individual arousals in which a warming phase was observed, 135 (69.9%) being cold arousals, where bats ceased increasing their body temperatures at ≤ 10 °C. The remaining arousals were standard normothermic arousals, where body (fur) surface temperatures reached > 20 °C. Cold arousals occurred during the mid- and late hibernation periods, suggesting they were a response to disturbance by a neighbour in the same cluster. Arousal cascades, where bats aroused in series, were rare (12.7%) and reached a maximum in mid-January. Our data suggest that Myotis bats prolong their torpor bouts using numerous cold arousals but few arousal cascades. Upon arrival of a bat, the clustered bats show tolerance to disturbing by conspecifics.","Relationships of body surface thermography with core temperature, birth weight and climatic variables in neonatal lambs born during early spring in an arid region.",https://www.ncbi.nlm.nih.gov/pubmed/31128641,Journal of thermal biology,2019 05 26,"The main cause of death in newborn lambs is hypothermia, so is necessary to identify the factors affecting variations in body surface temperatures of sheep neonates because approximately 60% of their body heat losses occur through the skin. This study aimed to establish relationships among body surface thermography from different regions with rectal temperature (RT), birth weight (BW) and climatic variables in hair breed newborn lambs during early spring in an arid region. Data of body surface temperatures measured by infrared thermography (entire head, eye, muzzle, ear, entire body, shoulder, rump, loin, right flank, belly and leg), RT and BW were collected at 0, 12 and 24 h post-lambing in 85 lambs born in early spring. Relative humidity [RH], temperature [Te] and temperature-humidity index [THI] were also recorded. RT was not correlated with surface temperatures at 0 and 24 h, but it was at 12 h with all of them (0.36 ≤ r ≤ 0.44). BW and some surface temperatures were negatively correlated at 0 and 24 h (-0.24 ≤ r ≤ -0.30), but positively at 12 h (0.25 ≤ r ≤ 0.27). All surface temperatures were positively correlated (0.51 ≤ r ≤ 0.85) with Te and THI in the three sampling times. Principal component (PC) analysis showed that PC1 explained the majority of the variance (71-72%), followed by PC2 (8-9%) at 0, 12 and 24 h. Body surface temperatures increased as Te and THI also increased, but decreased with the increase in HR. In conclusion, under early spring environment (predominantly cold), the variations in body surface temperatures of hair sheep neonates were more closely related to climatic variables than to RT and BW. Thermography proved to be an effective tool to determine body heat loss by radiation in skin of neonate lambs.",Would personal cooling vest be effective for use during exercise by people with thoracic spinal cord injury?,https://www.ncbi.nlm.nih.gov/pubmed/31128640,Journal of thermal biology,2019 05 26,"People with thoracic spinal cord injury (SCI), named people with paraplegia (PA), are vulnerable to thermal heat stress during exercise due to disruption in their thermal physiology. Using personal cooling vests with phase change material (PCM) or ice presents a possible solution for PA to suppress the increase in core temperature and body heat storage. With the limited published experimental studies about effective cooling vest for PA, this work aims to develop an altered PA bioheat model combined with cooling vest model to study cooling vest performance during exercise. The integrated PA bioheat and vest models predict core and skin temperatures, latent and sensible heat losses and change in body heat storage for PA with and without a cooling vest. The models were validated with published experimental data on PA without the cooling vest and on PA with two cooling vests; one using PCM at melting temperature of 15 °C and the other using ice packets during exercise. It was observed that sensible heat losses at the four torso segments (abdomen, lower back, chest and upper back) increased with the vest case compared to the no-vest case; while, latent heat losses decreased compared to the no-vest case. However, insignificant change was seen in core temperatures and body heat storage as was also reported experimentally. The performance of each of the cooling vest during exercise on PA was dependent on skin coverage area and melting temperatures.",Heat seekers: A tropical nocturnal lizard uses behavioral thermoregulation to exploit rare microclimates at night.,https://www.ncbi.nlm.nih.gov/pubmed/31128638,Journal of thermal biology,2019 05 26,"Environmental temperatures play a vital role in the physiological and behavioral activity of ectotherms. Behavioral thermoregulation allows animals to modify their body temperature to optimize functions critical to fitness, including digestion, growth, reproduction, and locomotor performance. Diurnal reptiles are a classic model system to answer questions related to thermal ecology, whereas behavioral thermoregulation in nocturnal species is thought to be strongly constrained by low environmental thermal heterogeneity at night. The few studies describing the thermal ecology of nocturnal reptiles indicate a majority of thermoregulatory behavior (if any) occurs during the day within diurnal retreats, but few examined this behavior throughout the night. In tropical systems, thermal heterogeneity may remain high, even at night, allowing nocturnal ectotherms to thermoregulate through conduction on surfaces that retain heat after sunset. We investigated the thermoregulatory behavior of a tropical nocturnal gecko (Australian house gecko, Gehyra dubia) by measuring its preferred temperature in a thermal gradient, and selected body temperatures using radio telemetry, in relation to available operative environmental temperatures obtained using thermal models. Preferred body temperatures of geckos ranged from 31.4 ± 0.59-34.5 ± 0.55 °C in a laboratory thermal gradient. In the field, during winter, geckos were more effective thermoregulators than in the summer. In low thermal quality habitats, geckos sought rare, warm microclimates at night to maintain body temperatures warmer than most available environmental temperatures, and were highly effective thermoregulators. For ectotherms, appropriate environmental temperatures are a vital resource for survival, similar to food or shelter. The ability to exploit rare microclimates is especially important for nocturnal species, as heterogeneity of environmental temperatures is reduced at night compared to the day. In a warming world, it is vital to understand the thermal ecology of nocturnal ectotherms, as other species may shift to become more nocturnal to avoid lethal diurnal temperatures.",Heat tolerance of Fire Service Instructors.,https://www.ncbi.nlm.nih.gov/pubmed/31128636,Journal of thermal biology,2019 05 26,"Fire Service Instructors (FSI) experience repeated fire exposures a median of 13 ± 8 times a month; consequently they may develop an acclimatised state.

Our high-quality data consisting of point locations of these delivery events allows use of a Bayesian Poisson point process approach to evaluate the spatial pattern of events. With this large epidemiologic dataset, we implemented the integrated nested Laplace approximation (INLA) to fit the conditional formulation of the point process via a Bayesian hierarchical model and empirically showed that INLA, compared to Markov chain Monte Carlo (MCMC) sampling, is an attractive approach. Furthermore, we modeled the temporal variability in stillbirth to better understand how stillbirths are geographically linked over the seven-year study period and demonstrate the similarity between the conditional formulation of the spatio-temporal model and a log Gaussian Cox process governed by discrete space-time random fields. After controlling for important features of the data, the Bayesian temporal relative risk maps identified areas of increasing and decreasing stillbirth risk over the birth period, which may warrant further public health investigation in the regions identified.","Estimating the health impact of air pollution in Scotland, and the resulting benefits of reducing concentrations in city centres.",https://www.ncbi.nlm.nih.gov/pubmed/31128634,Spatial and spatio-temporal epidemiology,2019 05 26,"Air pollution continues to be a key health issue in Scotland, despite recent improvements in concentrations. The Scottish Government published the Cleaner Air For Scotland strategy in 2015, and will introduce Low Emission Zones (LEZs) in the four major cities (Aberdeen, Dundee, Edinburgh and Glasgow) by 2020. However, there is no epidemiological evidence quantifying the current health impact of air pollution in Scotland, which this paper addresses. Additionally, we estimate the health benefits of reducing concentrations in city centres where most LEZs are located. We focus on cardio-respiratory disease and total non-accidental mortality outcomes, linking them to concentrations of both particulate (PM10 and PM2.5) and gaseous (NO2 and NOx) pollutants. Our two main findings are that: (i) all pollutants exhibit significant associations with respiratory disease but not cardiovascular disease; and (ii) reducing concentrations in city centres with low resident populations only provides a small health benefit.",Exploring socio-demographic-and geographical-variations in prevalence of diabetes and hypertension in Bangladesh: Bayesian spatial analysis of national health survey data.,https://www.ncbi.nlm.nih.gov/pubmed/31128633,Spatial and spatio-temporal epidemiology,2019 05 26,"Bangladesh has been experiencing an epidemiological transition from communicable diseases to non-communicable disease (NCDs), with a rapid increase in the NCD related morbidity and mortality in the last decade. Hypertension and diabetes are two important risk factors of NCDs that significantly increase the burden of cardiovascular diseases and risk of death. While the prevalence of people with both hypertension and diabetes has been increasing dramatically over time, it is essential to identify relatively more prevalent socio-demographic groups and geographical regions (local administrative districts) to reduce the NCDs related deaths in an urgent basis. This study focused on examining the association of socio-demographic factors with both hypertension and diabetes and exploring the regional variations in their prevalence using nationally representative survey data on adult population of age over 35 years. Bayesian spatial analysis was performed for both hypertension and diabetes data separately by fitting a model, that accounts for spatial variations, using integrated nested laplace approximation. The area-specific prevalence was then estimated as weighted average of the corresponding individual level predicted probabilities of being diseased derived from the fitted model, with weight from the individual level sampling weight. Finally, the estimated area-specific prevalence estimates were sketched in country-map to explore regional variations and identify regions with relatively higher prevalence. The results revealed that people of older age, higher education, better socio-economic condition, higher BMI are at greater risk of having hypertension and diabetes. Significant regional variations were observed with prevalence for hypertension ranges between 10% and 35% and for diabetes between 6% and 19% while their national prevalence were reported as 24% and 11%, respectively. The western regions of the country including middle capital city were found to be relatively more prevalent for hypertension while the middle-east and south-east regions were observed to be more prevalent for diabetes. The capital Dhaka region was observed as the most prevalent for both diabetes and hypertension. Details explanations of the findings and evidence based policy implications were discussed."

Mexico 2010: Based on a hierarchical Bayesian estimator.,https://www.ncbi.nlm.nih.gov/pubmed/31128618,Spatial and spatio-temporal epidemiology,2019 05 26,"The Sustainable Development Goal (SDG) 2.2 proposes ending stunting and wasting in children under five years of age by 2025. In Mexico, progress in the reduction of stunting has slowed in the 21st century. One of the challenges in tackling stunting is that it has become more concentrated in certain areas, but there are no data detailing its precise location. This paper produces the first small-area estimates of stunting for the Mexican municipalities by applying a hierarchical Bayesian estimator using data from a nationally representative survey (ENSANUT 2012, in Spanish) and the sample of the National Housing and Population Census 2010. The findings suggest the existence of large within-state differences in the prevalence of stunting and that this phenomenon is highly spatially clustered. The paper also illustrates the value of the small-area stunting estimates by performing a spatial analysis on the relationship between stunting and food insecurity at the municipal level.",A review of the burden and management of mild asthma in adults - Implications for clinical practice.,https://www.ncbi.nlm.nih.gov/pubmed/31128617,Respiratory medicine,2019 05 26,"Mild asthma is present in 50-75% of patients with asthma and is defined by the Global Initiative for Asthma as asthma that can be well controlled with low-intensity treatments (Steps 1 and 2). Despite this definition, 'mild' asthma is often not well controlled in reality, and can have a significant impact on an individual's symptom burden and quality of life. We performed a PubMed literature search to investigate the burden of 'mild' asthma in the lives of patients, including future risk and asthma control, and the current management strategies. While clinical guidelines recommend long-term, daily, low-dose inhaled corticosteroids (ICS) for 'mild' asthma, published data suggest that ICS are often under-prescribed or used intermittently as symptoms arise. Furthermore, patients and physicians tend to overestimate disease control, impacting the accuracy of diagnosing 'mild asthma' and subsequent management. This disconnect may be amplified by miscommunication between patients and physicians, limited objective assessment of control, and differences in guidelines. As with moderate and severe asthma, current evidence supports early initiation of regular ICS in 'mild' asthma to address the underlying inflammation, achieve symptom control and reduce risk of exacerbations. Adherence to ICS treatment is key and can be improved by educating both patients and healthcare professionals. The results of this literature search challenge the term 'mild' asthma and suggest strategies to improve the proactive management of the disease to enable patients to live symptom-free.",Serum CXCL11 correlates with pulmonary outcomes and disease burden in sarcoidosis.,https://www.ncbi.nlm.nih.gov/pubmed/31128616,Respiratory medicine,2019 05 26,"Sarcoidosis is a systemic granulomatous disease of unknown etiology that affects the lungs in 90% of patients, but has a wide range of disease manifestations and outcomes including chronic and progressive courses.

We investigated patient parameters upon hospital admission to predict MP infection. Methods All patients hospitalized in a tertiary care hospital between 2013 and 2017 for CAP with a confirmed etiology were analyzed using logistic regression analyses and area under the receiver operator characteristics (ROC) curves (AUC) for associations between demographic, clinical and laboratory features and the causative pathogen. Results We analyzed 568 patients with CAP, including 47 (8%) with MP; 152 (27%) with SP and 369 (65%) with influenza or other viruses. Comparing MP and SP by multivariate logistic regression analysis, younger age (odds ration [OR] 0.56 per 10 years, 95% CI 0.42-0.73), a lower neutrophil/lymphocyte ratio (OR 0.9, 0.82-0.99) and an elevated C-reactive protein/procalcitonin (CRP/PCT) ratio (OR 15.04 [5.23-43.26] for a 400 mg/μg cut-off) independently predicted MP. With a ROC curve AUC of 0.91 (0.80 for the >400 mg/μg cutoff), the CRP/PCT ratio was the strongest predictor of MP vs. SP. The discriminatory value resulted from significantly lower PCT values (p < 0.001) for MP, while CRP was high in both groups (p = 0.057). Comparing MP and viral infections showed similar results with again the CRP/PCT ratio providing the best information (AUC 0.83; OR 5.55 for the >400 mg/μg cutoff, 2.26-13.64). Conclusions In patients hospitalized with CAP, a high admission CRP/PCT ratio predicts M. pneumoniae infection and may improve empiric management.",Day length predicts investment in human immune function: Shorter days yield greater investment.,https://www.ncbi.nlm.nih.gov/pubmed/31128570,Psychoneuroendocrinology,2019 06 11,"Winter is characterized by stressful conditions which compromise health and render animals more vulnerable to infection and illness than during other times of the year. Organisms are hypothesized to adapt to these seasonal stressors by increasing investment in immune function in response to diminished photoperiod duration. Here, we examined this hypothesis in a sample of healthy human participants. Using several functional immune assays in vitro, as well as by utilizing measures of in vivo proinflammatory cytokine levels, we predicted that shorter day length would be associated with greater investment in immunological function. Results revealed that shorter days predicted significant upregulation of several facets of immune function, including natural killer cell cytotoxicity, peripheral blood mononuclear cell proliferation (in response to, and in the absence of stimulation), and plasma levels of interleukin-6, as well as lower rates of Staphylococcus aureus growth in serum ex vivo. Further, consistent with the hypothesis that these trade-offs would be offset by decreased investment in mating effort, shorter day length also predicted lower levels of total testosterone in men. These results suggest that ambient photoperiod may be a powerful regulator of human immunological activity, providing some of the first evidence of seasonal changes in multiple facets of human immune function.",Cortisol modulates the engagement of multiple memory systems: Exploration of a common NR3C2 polymorphism.,https://www.ncbi.nlm.nih.gov/pubmed/31128569,Psychoneuroendocrinology,2019 06 11,"Exposure to acute stress has been shown to result in a shift from declarative toward non-declarative learning, presumably mediated by brain mineralocorticoid receptors (MRs). In this study, we aimed to replicate and extend these findings by investigating the role of stress-associated cortisol secretion on learning behavior. Furthermore, we explored the influence of a well-characterized common single nucleotide polymorphism of the MR gene (rs2070951; minor allele frequency: 49.3%) previously shown to influence MR expression and HPA axis activity. Healthy males (n = 74) were exposed to the Trier Social Stress Test or a control condition prior to performing a probabilistic classification task (Weather Prediction Task). The use of a non-declarative learning strategy continuously increased over the course of the learning task after stress exposure, but leveled in the control condition. The shift toward a non-declarative strategy in the stress group was associated with better learning performance. Higher pre-stress cortisol levels favored the adoption of a non-declarative learning strategy. rs2070951 C/C-carriers in contrast to G-allele carriers exhibited a larger secretion of cortisol under stress. Furthermore, control participants homozygous for the C-allele adopted a non-declarative learning strategy less often than stressed participants, whereas the choice of strategy was independent of stress in G-allele carriers. The failure to switch strategies resulted in poorer performance, suggesting a beneficial effect of stress in dependence of MR variation. Consistent with previous findings, the results provide further support for cortisol as a driving force in coordinating the competition between multiple memory systems under stress.",Null results of oxytocin and vasopressin administration across a range of social cognitive and behavioral paradigms: Evidence from a randomized controlled trial.,https://www.ncbi.nlm.nih.gov/pubmed/31128568,Psychoneuroendocrinology,2019 06 11,"Research examining oxytocin and vasopressin in humans has the potential to elucidate neurobiological mechanisms underlying human sociality that have been previously unknown or not well characterized. A primary goal of this work is to increase our knowledge about neurodevelopmental and psychiatric disorders characterized by impairments in social cognition. However, years of research highlighting wide-ranging effects of, in particular, intranasal oxytocin administration have been tempered as the fields of psychology, neuroscience, and other disciplines have been addressing concerns over the reproducibility and validity of research findings. We present a series of behavioral tasks that were conducted using a randomized, double-blind, placebo controlled, between-subjects design, in which our research group found no main effects of oxytocin and vasopressin on a host of social outcomes. In addition to null hypothesis significance testing, we implemented equivalence testing and Bayesian hypothesis testing to examine the sensitivity of our findings. These analyses indicated that 47-83% of our results (depending on the method of post-hoc analysis) had enough sensitivity to detect the absence of a main effect. Our results add to evidence that intranasal oxytocin may have a more limited direct effect on human social processes than initially assumed and suggest that the direct effects of intranasal vasopressin may be similarly limited.

Symptoms of intoxication by these substances are well known but less is known about the pathology of overdose-related death. NEH-induced fatal intoxication has not been described in the literature and knowledge surrounding the particular circumstances of death could be useful better public education of risk and more adequate treatment of overdose patients. In this report, we characterize the case of a 23-year-old male regular drug user who died a few hours after NEH and ADB-FUBINACA consumption. His medical history showed arrhythmia in childhood, and some seizures. Autopsy found he had a BMI of 42.9, a hypertrophic and dilated heart, severe atherosclerosis of the valves, coronaries and the arteries, and edema of the internal organs. Histology confirmed those findings. Postmortem blood levels of NEH were 285 ng/ml, along with 0.08 ng/ml ADB-FUBINACA and five ADB-FUBINACA metabolites. Based on the blood concentrations measured in suspected drug users (≤83.9 ng/ml) we hypothesize that NEH intoxication was the cause of death in this case, with heart disease being a co-factor and that the synthetic cannabinoid effect might have been accompaniment. This case also offered the opportunity to identify the metabolites of ADB-FUBINACA in the blood. We identified metabolites in the post-mortem blood by comparing them to human liver microsomal enzyme metabolites in vitro. Three major and two minor metabolites were found in the blood, of which two could only be derived from ADB-FUBINACA, as opposed to other cannabinoids. The case highlights the importance of the complex analysis of drug related deaths by medico-legal autopsy, histopathology and toxicology.",Longstanding psychological stress in relation to biomarkers of neuronal dysfunction in cerebrospinal fluid: a 25-year follow-up study in women.,https://www.ncbi.nlm.nih.gov/pubmed/31128566,Neurobiology of aging,2019 06 10,"Longstanding psychological stress has been associated with increased risk of neurodegenerative disorders, such as dementia and Alzheimer's disease. In a prospective population study of women (n = 81), we tested if midlife stress (mean age 49 years) was associated with late-life biomarkers of neurodegeneration in cerebrospinal fluid (CSF) (mean age 74 years) in linear regression models. It was found that women who report of stress at baseline (n = 20) had higher levels of CSF visinin-like protein-1 (VILIP-1) (age adjusted β = 0.113, p = 0.017) and CSF myelin basic protein (β = 0.060, p = 0.030) compared with women without midlife stress (n = 61). There was also a trend observed for higher CSF neurofilament light (β = 0.133, p = 0.056). In addition, longer periods of stress (i.e., stress at 2-3 midlife examinations) were associated with higher levels of CSF VILIP-1. The results suggest that longstanding stress might be associated with neurodegenerative processes in the brain, as CSF VILIP-1 is an unspecific marker for neuronal injury and CSF myelin basic protein reflects neuroaxonal demyelination.","Chronic nutrient inputs affect stream macroinvertebrate communities more than acute inputs: An experiment manipulating phosphorus, nitrogen and sediment.",https://www.ncbi.nlm.nih.gov/pubmed/31128565,The Science of the total environment,2019 06 04,"Freshwaters worldwide are affected by multiple stressors. Timing of inputs and pathways of delivery can influence the impact stressors have on freshwater communities. In particular, effects of point versus diffuse nutrient inputs on stream macroinvertebrates are poorly understood. Point-source inputs tend to pose a chronic problem, whereas diffuse inputs tend to be acute with short concentration spikes. We manipulated three key agricultural stressors, phosphorus (ambient, chronic, acute), nitrogen (ambient, chronic, acute) and fine sediment (ambient, high), in 112 stream mesocosms (26 days colonisation, 18 days of manipulations) and determined the individual and combined effects of these stressors on stream macroinvertebrate communities (benthos and drift). Chronic nutrient treatments continuously received high concentrations of P and/or N. Acute channels received the same continuous enrichment, but concentrations were doubled during two 3-hour periods (day 6, day 13) to simulate acute nutrient inputs during rainstorms. Sediment was the most pervasive stressor in the benthos, reducing total macroinvertebrate abundance and richness, EPT (mayflies, stoneflies, caddisflies) abundance and richness. By contrast, N or P enrichment did not affect any of the six studied community-level metrics. In the drift assemblage, enrichment effects became more prevalent the longer the experiment went on. Sediment was the dominant driver of drift responses at the beginning of the experiment. After the first acute nutrient pulse, sediment remained the most influential stressor but its effects started to fade. After the second pulse, N became the dominant stressor. In general, impacts of either N or P on the drift were due to chronic exposure, with acute nutrient pulses having no additional effects. Overall, our findings imply that cost-effective management should focus on mitigating sediment inputs first and tackle chronic nutrient inputs second. Freshwater managers should also take into account the length of exposure to high nutrient concentrations, rather than merely the concentrations themselves.",A functional homologue of Arabidopsis TTG1 from Freesia interacts with bHLH proteins to regulate anthocyanin and proanthocyanidin biosynthesis in both Freesia hybrida and Arabidopsis thaliana.,https://www.ncbi.nlm.nih.gov/pubmed/31128564,Plant physiology and biochemistry : PPB,2019 06 14,"The MBW complex, consisting of MYB, basic helix-loop-helix (bHLH) and WD40 proteins, regulates multiple traits in plants, such as anthocyanin and proanthocyanidin biosynthesis and cell fate determination. The complex has been widely identified in dicot plants, whereas few studies are concentrated on monocot plants which are of crucial importance to decipher its functional diversities among angiosperms during evolution. In present study, a WD40 gene from Freesia hybrida, designated as FhTTG1, was cloned and functionally characterized. Real-time PCR analysis indicated that it was expressed synchronously with the accumulation of both proanthocyanidins and anthocyanins in Freesia flowers. Transient protoplast transfection and biomolecular fluorescence complementation (BiFC) assays demonstrated that FhTTG1 could interact with FhbHLH proteins (FhTT8L and FhGL3L) to constitute the MBW complex. Moreover, the transportation of FhTTG1 to nucleus was found to rely on FhbHLH factors. Outstandingly, FhTTG1 could highly activate the anthocyanin or proanthocyanidin biosynthesis related gene promoters when co-transfected with MYB and bHLH partners, implying that FhTTG1 functioned as a member of MBW complex to control the anthocyanin or proanthocyanidin biosynthesis in Freesia hybrida. Further ectopic expression assays in Arabidopsis ttg1-1 showed the defective phenotypes of ttg1-1 were partially restored. Molecular biological assays validated FhTTG1 might interact with the endogenous bHLH factors to up-regulate genes responsible for anthocyanin and proanthocyanidin biosynthesis and trichome formation, indicating that FhTTG1 might perform exchangeable roles with AtTTG1. These results will not only contribute to the characterization of FhTTG1 in Freesia but also shed light on the establishment of flavonoid regulatory system in monocot plants, especially in Freesia hybrida.",The potential role of brassinosteroids (BRs) in alleviating antimony (Sb) stress in Arabidopsis thaliana.,https://www.ncbi.nlm.nih.gov/pubmed/31128563,Plant physiology and biochemistry : PPB,2019 06 14,"Brassinosteroids (BRs) play a crucial role in improving plant resistance to various environmental stresses. In this study, we aimed to explore the potential role of BRs in protecting plants from antimony (Sb) toxicity. In the in vitro agar-plate culture experiments, the level changes of BR in wide-type plants and BR biosynthesis mutant dwrf4-1 significantly affected the corresponding response of Arabidopsis to Sb stress. Increasing the BR content significantly enhanced Sb-induced root growth inhibition and lowering the BR level appeared to reduce the plant sensitivity to Sb stress. Foliar application of eBL, however, significantly decreased the Sb accumulation and peroxidation of membrane lipids, increased the contents of chlorophyll and proline, and further boosted and strengthened the antioxidant enzymes activities. These experiments demonstrated that BRs played an important role in regulating heavy metal stress responses in plants and exogenous foliar spray of eBL was an important method for alleviating toxicity of Sb.",5-Azacytidine promotes shoot regeneration during Agrobacterium-mediated soybean transformation.,https://www.ncbi.nlm.nih.gov/pubmed/31128562,Plant physiology and biochemistry : PPB,2019 06 14,"Agrobacterium-mediated soybean transformation has been greatly improved in recent years, however the transformation efficiency is still low and highly genotype-dependent when compared to other species. Here, we characterized seventeen soybean genotypes based on their genetic transformation efficiencies, i.e., high and low, during Agrobacterium-mediated transformation. To reveal the molecular basis of this transformation difference, we constructed a highly efficient transient transgene expression system using soybean cotyledon protoplasts and then assess the methylation levels of promoter and coding regions of an EYFP (enhanced yellow fluorescent protein) gene introduced into the protoplast cultures of various soybean genotypes using BSP (bisulfite sequencing PCR). Increased methylation was found to be associated with the considerably decreased transfection efficiency (as percentage of EYFP fluorescent protoplasts) in low-efficacy genotypes as compared with those in high-efficacy on three DAT (day after transfection). 5-Azacytidine (5-Azac), a demethylating reagent commonly applied in epigenetic researches, significantly improved the transient transfection efficiency and transgene expression level in low-efficiency genotypes. Furthermore, the shoot regeneration efficiency in low-efficiency genotypes was substantially increased by 5-Azac treatment in an Agrobacterium-mediated soybean transformation system. Taken together, we concluded that lower methylation level in transgene contributed to enhanced shoot regeneration in Agrobacterium-mediated soybean transformation."

A Fourier transform-infrared photoacoustic spectroscopy and chlorophyll a fluorescence study.,https://www.ncbi.nlm.nih.gov/pubmed/31128550,Ecotoxicology and environmental safety,2019 06 16,"With the continued increase of technological uses of cerium oxide nanoparticles (CeO2 NPs or nanoceria) and their unregulated disposal, the accumulation of nanoceria in the environment is inevitable. Concomitantly, atmospheric carbon dioxide (CO2) levels continue to rise, increasing the concentrations of bicarbonate ions in aquatic ecosystems. This study investigates the influence of CeO2 NPs (from 0 to 100 μgL-1) in the presence and absence of an elevated bicarbonate (HCO3-) ion concentration (1 mM), on vibrational biochemical parameters and photosystem II (PSII) activity in leaf discs of Salvinia auriculata. Fourier transform-infrared photoacoustic spectroscopy (FTIR-PAS) was capable of diagnostic use to understand biochemical and metabolic changes in leaves submitted to the CeO2 NPs and also detected interactive responses between CeO2 NPs and HCO3- exposure at the tissue level. The results showed that the higher CeO2 NPs levels in the presence of HCO3- increased the non-photochemical quenching (NPQ) and coefficient of photochemical quenching in dark (qPd) compared to the absence of HCO3. Moreover, the presence of HCO3- significantly decreased the NPQ at all levels of CeO2 NPs demonstrating that HCO3- exposure may change the non-radiative process involved in the operation of the photosynthetic apparatus. Overall, the results of this study are useful for providing baseline information on the interactive effects of CeO2 NPs and elevated HCO3- ion concentration on photosynthetic systems.",Phytoremediation of multi-metal contaminated mine tailings with Solanum nigrum L. and biochar/attapulgite amendments.,https://www.ncbi.nlm.nih.gov/pubmed/31128549,Ecotoxicology and environmental safety,2019 06 16,"A greenhouse experiment was conducted to investigate an enhanced phytoremediation technique for multi-metal contaminated mine tailings by Solanum nigrum L. and using biochar/attapulgite as soil amendments. The 10% attapulgite (MA2) and 10% biochar (MB2) were recommended as the optimum chemical proportions for amendment materials. Plant length and fresh weight in the MA2/MB2-applied treatments were significantly higher than that in the non-amended treatment, indicating MA2 and MB2 amendments could alleviate metal phytotoxicity. Metal uptake in plant leaves was lower with MA2 and MB2 application than that in the non-amended treatment. However, metal uptake in plant roots was significantly increased with MA2 and MB2 application from the fifth month, suggesting that MA2 and MB2 had significant enhancement on metal stabilization. Temporal variation of metal translocation in soil-to-plant system showed that the function of MA2 and MB2 reached the plateau nearly in the seventh month. The removal rates of metals were higher after the application of MA2 than MB2, and by the following order: Cu (39.6%) > Zn (35.0%) > Cd (34.1%) > Hg (32.1%) > Pb (31.8%) > Mn (19.1%).

To delineate their histogenesis, gene profiles, and their potential drivers, we performed a whole-transcriptome sequencing analysis of fourteen samples of spiradenoma/cylindroma in comparison to normal samples. A total of 12 spiradenomas, 5 cylindromas, 3 hybrid spiradenomas/cylindromas and 2 adnexal carcinomas were included in this study. 1335 characteristic genes and transcripts expressed over all 14 spiradenoma/cylindroma tumors were identified, and two groups of expression profiles were observed. Highest upregulated top 7 gene signatures characterized benign tumors with developmental and differentiation related genes, and carcinomas with top 7 genes mainly related to signaling, reorganization and metabolism of membranes. Immunohistochemistry of protein expressions validated 4 upregulated genes (ODAM, HOXB13, MYB and SOX10) considered important and as potential biomarkers for spiradenomas and cylindromas. We further compared the transcriptome of eccrine adnexal tumors with the transcriptome of adenoid cystic carcinoma (ACC) to identify the overlapping genes that may indicate histogenesis. There were 36 specific genes overlapping between adnexal carcinomas and the epithelial-dominant subtype of ACC, and 27 specific genes overlapping benign adnexal tumors with the myoepithelial-dominant subtype of ACC, At this point there is no known specific biomarker to aid in the diagnosis of eccrine spiradenoma and cylindroma in small samples or biopsies within the context of morphological overlap with ACC.

However, it still showed undesirable performance because of the challenge to control the orientation (such as vertical alignment) of PANI nanostructure for extracellular electron transfer (EET). In this work, vertically aligned polyaniline (VA-PANI) on carbon cloth electrode surface were prepared by in-situ polymerization method (simply tuning the ratio of tartaric acid (TA) dopant). Impressively, the VA-PANI greatly improved the EET due to the increased opportunity to connect with conductive proteins. Eventually, MFC equipped with the VA-PANI electrodes delivered a power output of 853 mW/m2, which greatly outperformed those electrodes modified with un-oriented PANI.

In this study, the dynamic changes in the enzyme activity levels, bacterial community structure, and metabolism functions were investigated during chicken manure composting with an added bio-surfactant (rhamnolipid) or chemical surfactant (Tween-80). The results showed that rhamnolipid and Tween-80 improved the quality of the finished compost in terms of the C/N ratio, water-soluble carbon content, germination index, E4/E6 ratio, and the cellulase activity, especially with Tween-80. Furthermore, the bacterial communities were determined by high-throughput sequencing, and their metabolism functions were evaluated using the PICRUSt and Biolog methods. Tween-80 greatly influenced the bacterial community structure, where it enhanced the abundances of bacteria that degrade cellulose and lignin (e.g., members of the order Bacillales) and the capacities for carbohydrate and amino acid metabolism. Network analysis also showed that the order Bacillales was closely related to the metabolism of characteristic carbon sources, especially carbohydrates.",Bioconversion of kitchen wastes into bioflocculant and its pilot-scale application in treating iron mineral processing wastewater.,https://www.ncbi.nlm.nih.gov/pubmed/31128543,Bioresource technology,2019 06 14,"In this study, the feasibility of converting kitchen waste into bioflocculant using Bacillus agaradhaerens C9 was analyzed.

Strong alkaline fermentation condition was able to induce the bioflocculant production, and inhibit the growth of contaminated bacteria, which avoids the sterilization process of kitchen waste. The optimum fermentation condition for enzymatic hydrolysis and bioflocculant production was 40 g/L kitchen waste, 37 °C, pH 9.5, and the highest bioflocculant yield of 6.92 g/L was achieved. Furthermore, bioflocculant was applied to treat pilot-scale (30 L) of mineral processing wastewater for the first time, and the removal rate of 92.35% was observed when 9 mg/L bioflocculant was added into wastewater.

In this study, salinity did not significantly inhibit the removal of TP and COD, but TN and NH4+-N removal efficiencies during saline wastewater treatment (ST) were significantly lower than during non-saline wastewater treatment (NT). However, salinity significantly increased the power density (16.4 mW m-2 in ST and 3.9 mW m-2 in NT, a 4-fold enhancement) by increasing the electron transfer rate and reducing internal resistance (140.29 Ω in ST and 415.21 Ω in NT). The peptides in extracellular polymeric substances (EPS) acted as electron shuttles to promote the migration of electrons and protons in ST.

Inhibition of neuroinflammation has been proved to be effective in neurodegenerative diseases treatment. Nuclear factor erythroid 2 related factor 2 (Nrf2) is a key mediator of endogenous inducible defense systems in the body. In response to oxidative stress, Nrf2 translocates to the nucleus and binds to specific DNA sites termed as anti-oxidant response elements to initiate transcription of cytoprotective genes, such as hemeoxygenase-1 (HO-1) and nicotinamide adenine dinucleotide phosphate: quinine oxidoreductase-1 (NQO1). However, insufficient Nrf2 activation has been closely associated with the progress of neurodegenerative diseases. New findings have linked activation of Nrf2 signaling to anti-inflammatory effects. Icariin (ICA), a natural compound derived from Herba Epimedii, possesses amounts of pharmacological activities, such as anti-aging, anti-oxidation and anti-inflammatory effects. Recent studies have confirmed that ICA exerted neuroprotection against neurodegenerative diseases. However, the mechanisms underlying ICA-mediated neuroprotection were not fully understood. In the present study, microglia BV-2 cell lines were performed to investigate the anti-neuroinflammatory effects of ICA and the mechanisms of actions. Results showed that ICA suppressed lipopolysaccharide (LPS)-induced microglial pro-inflammatory factors production. In addition, activation of Nrf2 signaling pathway participated in ICA-mediated anti-neuroinflammation, as evidenced by the following observations. First, Nrf2 siRNA reversed ICA-reduced microglial activation and pro-inflammatory factors release. Second, a selective inhibitor of HO-1 abolished ICA-mediated anti-neuroinflammatory actions. This study will give us an insight into the potential of Nrf2 and neuroinflammation in terms of opening up an alternative therapeutic strategy for neurodegenerative diseases.",Egg yolk antibodies (IgY) and their applications in human and veterinary health: A review.,https://www.ncbi.nlm.nih.gov/pubmed/31128529,International immunopharmacology,2019 06 12,"Egg yolk constitutes a relevant alternative source of antibodies. It presents some advantages over mammalian serum immunoglobulins regarding productivity, animal welfare and specificity. The main immunoglobulin present in avian blood (IgY) is transmitted to their offspring and accumulates in egg yolks, which enables the non-invasive harvesting of high amounts of antibodies. Moreover, due to structural differences and phylogenetic distance, IgY is more suitable for diagnostic purposes than mammalian antibodies, since it does not react with certain components of the human immune system and displays greater avidity for mammalian conserved proteins. IgY has been extensively used in health researches, as both therapeutic and diagnostic tool.

AC has been used in the field of biopharmaceutical manufacturing for plasma-derived products and recombinant monoclonal antibodies (mAb). In our previous study, AC was employed in the purification process of therapeutic mAb as a replacement for Protein A affinity chromatography (PrA). In addition, we designed an all flow-through purification process using AC. In these investigations, greater effective clearance of high-molecular-weight species (HMW), low-molecular-weight species (LMW), host cell proteins (HCP), and DNA was observed compared to that of the conventional Protein A platform purification process. However, it was revealed that mAb recovery from the AC step was lower than that from the PrA step. In this work, to improve mAb recovery from the AC step while maintaining the effective removal of impurities, a pretreatment procedure conducted prior to the AC treatment was investigated. We found that both an ultrafiltration/dilution and reduction in the conductivity of the filtered cell culture supernatant after acid precipitation could improve both the impurity clearance and mAb recovery from the AC treatment. From the obtained results, we designed a two-step purification process in which AC treatment is followed by either cation exchange column chromatography or anion exchange column chromatography, and we compared this against the Protein A platform purification process. Excellent impurity clearance was achieved, even in the one-column process. Furthermore, we designed an innovative column-free flow-through purification process based on acid precipitation, clarification, ultrafiltration/dilution, and the implementation of an AC filter membrane and an anion exchange chromatography membrane. With this process in the pilot-scale, HCP level can be reduced to below 10 ng/mg, and HMW and LMW can be removed to below 1% while improving mAb recovery. From these results, it is strongly expected that AC is a promising candidate for the next generation of mAb purification processes to improve the economy and efficiency of the process.",Understanding Aldose Reductase-Inhibitors interactions with free energy simulation.,https://www.ncbi.nlm.nih.gov/pubmed/31128525,Journal of molecular graphics & modelling,2019 06 14,"Aldose Reductase (AR) reduces a variety of substrates, such as aldehydes, aldoses and corticosteroids. It is the first and rate-limiting enzyme of the polyol pathway and is an important target enzyme for diabetes-associated complications, including retinopathy, neuropathy, and nephropathy. Inhibitors targeting this enzyme are structurally different and some of them have side effects. In existing publications, computational techniques are applied to investigate the binding affinities of existing inhibitors and predicting the affinities of newly designed ligands. However, these calculations only employ coarse and approximated methods such as docking and MM/PBSA. Brute force simulations are employed to study the dynamics of the system but no converged statistics is obtained. As a result, these computations provide results not consistent with experimental values and large discrepancies exist. In the current work, we employ the enhanced sampling technique of alchemical free energy simulation to calculate the binding affinities of several ligands targeting AR. The statistical error is defined with care and the correlation in the time-series data is fully considered. The statistically optimal estimators are used to extract the free energy estimates and the predicted results are in agreement with the experimental values. Less computationally demanding end-point free energy methods are also performed to compare their efficiency with the alchemical methods. As is expected, the end-point methods are of less accuracy and reliability compared with the alchemical free energy methods. The decomposition of the free energy difference in each alchemical transformation into the enthalpic and entropic components gives further insights on the thermodynamics. The enthalpy-entropy compensation is observed in this case. As the structural data obtained from experiments are only snapshots and more details are needed to understand the dynamics of the protein-ligand system, the conformational ensemble is analyzed. We identify important residues involved in the protein-ligand binding case and short-lived interactions formed due to fluctuations in the conformational ensemble. The current work shed light on the atomic detailed understanding of the dynamics of AR-inhibitors interactions.","A totally data-driven whole-brain multimodal pipeline for the discrimination of Parkinson's disease, multiple system atrophy and healthy control.",https://www.ncbi.nlm.nih.gov/pubmed/31128523,NeuroImage.

In this study, we used such a complete MRI protocol and adapted a fully-data driven analysis pipeline to discriminate between these populations and a healthy controls (HC) group. The pipeline combined several feature selection and reduction steps to obtain interpretable models with a low number of discriminant features that can shed light onto the brain pathology of PD and MSA. Using this pipeline, we could discriminate between PD and HC (best accuracy = 0.78), MSA and HC (best accuracy = 0.94) and PD and MSA (best accuracy = 0.88). Moreover, we showed that indexes derived from resting-state fMRI alone could discriminate between PD and HC, while mean diffusivity in the cerebellum and the putamen alone could discriminate between MSA and HC. On the other hand, a more diverse set of indexes derived by multiple modalities was needed to discriminate between the two disorders. We showed that our pipeline was able to discriminate between distinct pathological populations while delivering sparse model that could be used to better understand the neural underpinning of the pathologies.",Mind-body exercise improves cognitive function and modulates the function and structure of the hippocampus and anterior cingulate cortex in patients with mild cognitive impairment.,https://www.ncbi.nlm.nih.gov/pubmed/31128522,NeuroImage. Clinical,2019 06 11,"Mild cognitive impairment (MCI) is a common neurological disorder. This study aims to investigate the modulation effect of Baduanjin (a popular mind-body exercise) on MCI. 69 patients were randomized to Baduanjin, brisk walking, or an education control group for 24 weeks. The Montreal Cognitive Assessment (MoCA) and Magnetic Resonance Imaging scans were applied at baseline and at the end of the experiment. Compared to the brisk walking and control groups, the Baduanjin group experienced significantly increased MoCA scores. Amplitude of low-frequency fluctuations (ALFF) analysis showed significantly decreased ALFF values in the right hippocampus (classic low-freqency band, 0.01-0.08 Hz) in the Baduanjin group compared to the brisk walking group and increased ALFF values in the bilateral anterior cingulate cortex (ACC, slow-5 band, 0.01-0.027 Hz) in the Baduanjin group compared to the control group. Further, ALFF value changes in the right hippocampus and bilateral ACC were significantly associated with corresponding MoCA score changes across all groups. We also found increased gray matter volume in the Baduanjin group in the right hippocampus compared to the brisk walking group and in the bilateral ACC compared to the control group. In addition, there was an increased resting state functional connectivity between the hippocampus and right angular gyrus in the Baduanjin group compared to the control group.

As preceptors at the postgraduate level, district nurses play an important role in helping these students to achieve the learning outcomes of the clinical practice part of their education. However, there is a lack of studies on precepting at this level. Thus, the aim was to describe district nurses' experiences of precepting district nurse students at the postgraduate level. The study was descriptive in design and used a qualitative approach. Purposive sampling was used and nine district nurses from seven primary health care units in Sweden were interviewed. Data were analysed using qualitative content analysis. An overall theme ""Fluctuating between transferring knowledge and striving for reflective learning"" and two subthemes emerged. The preceptors' views on precepting and performance varied depending on the situation. The conclusions is that given the current learning outcomes for clinical practice education at the postgraduate level, district nurses need to be more influenced by preception focused on reflective learning."

Here, the vertical distribution and the seasonal variation of 16 PAHs in the soils and the water of 4 epikarst spring catchments in Southwest China were investigated. The total concentration of the PAHs ranged within 61-3285 ng g-1 in the soils, and 341-4969 ng L-1 in the spring water. The vertical distribution of the PAHs in soils varied with ring numbers and altitude of the catchment.

However, no correlation with TOC was observed in the catchment of a high altitude (2090 m A.S.L.), because the large water flux led to the fast migration of the 2-3 rings PAHs in soils. The PAHs in soils and springs were mainly derived from the combustion of grass/wood/coal, closely related with the primary fossil fuels used in this area.

Meta-analyses of the PANSS was conducted using both a co-occurrence similarity matrix and reproduced correlations. Both methods produced similar results. Five factors (Positive Symptoms, Negative Symptoms, Disorganization, Affect and Resistance) emerged clearly across both analyses. The factors and the items defining them were Positive Symptoms (P1 Delusions, G9 Unusual thought content, P3 Hallucinatory behavior, P6 Suspiciousness and persecution, P5 Grandiosity), Negative Symptoms (N2 Emotional withdrawal, N1 Blunted affect, N4 Passive apathetic social withdrawal, N6 Lack of spontaneity, N3 Poor rapport, G7 Motor retardation, G16 Active social avoidance), Disorganization often termed Cognitive (P2 Conceptual disorganization, G11 Poor attention, N5 Difficulty in abstract thinking, G13 Disturbance of volition, N7 Stereotyped thinking, G5 Mannerisms/posturing, G15 Preoccupation, G10 Disorientation), Affect often termed Depression-Anxiety (G2 Anxiety, G6 Depression, G3 Guilt feelings, G4 Tension, G1 Somatic concern) and a small fifth factor that might be characterized as Resistance or Excitement/Activity (P7 Hostility, G14 Poor impulse control, P4 Excitement, G8 Uncooperativeness).

Therefore, the search for effective augmentation strategies that may reduce ketamine doses is welcome. Therefore, this study sought to augment the effect of ketamine by guanosine in the novelty-suppressed feeding (NSF) test, a behavioral paradigm able to detect depression/anxiety-related behavior. Acute administration of guanosine (0.05 mg/kg, p.o.), similar to ketamine (1 mg/kg, i.p.), produced a rapid behavioral response in mice submitted to NSF test. Moreover, the coadministration of sub-effective doses of guanosine (0.01 mg/kg, p.o.) and ketamine (0.1 mg/kg, i.p.) was effective in mice submitted to NSF test. Subsequently, the intracellular mechanism underpinning the augmentation effect of ketamine by guanosine was investigated. Our results suggest that augmentation response of ketamine by guanosine in the NSF test probably involves the activation of mTOR signaling, since the treatment with rapamycin (0.2 nmol/site, i.c.v., a selective mTOR inhibitor) completely abolished this effect. This augmentation strategy also increased mTOR phosphorylation (Ser2448) in the hippocampus, reinforcing the role of mTOR in this augmentation response. However, no changes in the p70S6K, PSD-95, GluA1, and synapsin immunocontents were found in the hippocampus of ketamine plus guanosine-treated mice. Overall, results provide evidence that guanosine is able to augment the effect of ketamine in the NSF test via mTOR activation, a finding that might have therapeutic implications for the management of depression/anxiety.","Comprehensive analysis of renal arsenic accumulation using images based on X-ray fluorescence at the tissue, cellular, and subcellular levels.",https://www.ncbi.nlm.nih.gov/pubmed/31128499,"Applied radiation and isotopes : including data, instrumentation and methods for use in agriculture, industry and medicine",2019 06 16,"Exposure to arsenic (As) through drinking water results in accumulation of As and its methylated metabolites in several organs, promoting adverse health effects, particularly potential development of cancer.

Differently from the pathological amyloid fibrils, those derived from food proteins can be used as advanced materials in biomedicine, tissue engineering, environmental science, nanotechnology, material science as well as in food science, owing to a combination of highly desirable feature such as extreme aspect ratios, outstanding stiffness and a broad availability of functional groups on their surfaces. In food science, protein fibrillization is progressively recognized as an appealing strategy to broaden and improve food protein functionality. This review article discusses the various classes of reported food protein amyloid fibrils and their formation conditions. It furthermore considers amyloid fibrils in a broad context, from their structural characterization to their forming mechanisms and ensued physical properties, emphasizing their applications in food-related fields. Finally, the biological fate and the potential toxicity mechanisms of food amyloid fibrils are discussed, and an experimental protocol for their health safety validation is proposed in the concluding part of the review.",,https://www.ncbi.nlm.nih.gov/pubmed/31128462,Advances in colloid and interface science,2019 06 11,"Cell-cell and cell-matrix adhesions are fundamental in all multicellular organisms. They play a key role in cellular growth, differentiation, pattern formation and migration. Cell-cell adhesion is substantial in the immune response, pathogen-host interactions, and tumor development. The success of tissue engineering and stem cell implantations strongly depends on the fine control of live cell adhesion on the surface of natural or biomimetic scaffolds. Therefore, the quantitative and precise measurement of the adhesion strength of living cells is critical, not only in basic research but in modern technologies, too. Several techniques have been developed or are under development to quantify cell adhesion. All of them have their pros and cons, which has to be carefully considered before the experiments and interpretation of the recorded data.

PUL presents many favorable characteristics, such as renewable origin, biocompatibility, stability, hydrophilic nature, and availability of reactive sites for chemical modification. With an inherent affinity to asialoglycoprotein receptors, PUL can be used for targeted drug delivery to the liver. Besides, these primary properties have been combined with modern synthetic approaches for developing multifunctional biomaterials. This is evident from numerous studies on approaches, such as hydrophobic modification, cross-linking, grafting and transformation as a polyelectrolyte. In this review, we have discussed up-to-date advances on chemical modifications and emerging applications of PUL in targeted theranostics and tissue engineering.

However, data on the use of antiepileptic drugs in these patients are still lacking. This study assessed the real-world effectiveness and safety/tolerability of eslicarbazepine acetate (ESL) in patients with intellectual disability and psychiatric comorbidities, including a separate analysis specifically in those with depression, using data from the Euro-Esli study. Effectiveness measures included responder and seizure freedom rates. Safety and tolerability were assessed by evaluating adverse events (AEs) and ESL discontinuation due to AEs, respectively. Of the 2058 patients initially included in the Euro-Esli study, 952 patients had intellectual disability data available, 1138 had psychiatric comorbidity data available and 1134 had depression data available. Of those who had intellectual or psychiatric comorbidity data available, 11.3% (108/952) suffered from intellectual disability, 24.9% (283/1138) had a psychiatric disorder, including depression, and 12.4% (141/1134) specifically had depression. Responder and seizure freedom rates were generally comparable between patients with psychiatric comorbidity and those without, and patients with depression and those without. However, responder and seizure freedom rates were significantly lower in patients with intellectual disability compared with those without. Overall, patients with psychiatric and intellectual comorbidities experienced more AEs and AEs leading to ESL discontinuation than patients without these comorbidities. The incidence of psychiatric AEs was not significantly different for patients with psychiatric comorbidities or depression than those without, and the incidence of cognitive AEs was not significantly different for patients with intellectual disability than those without. These findings suggest that ESL is effective in patients with psychiatric and intellectual comorbidities and that its use in these patients is unlikely to exacerbate existing psychiatric or cognitive disturbances.",Autonomic dysfunction is frequent and disabling in non-paraneoplastic sensory neuronopathies.,https://www.ncbi.nlm.nih.gov/pubmed/31128458,Journal of the neurological sciences,2019 06 16,"Sensory neuronopathies (SN) are characterized by asymmetric non-length dependent sensory deficits and sensory ataxia.

These individuals, particularly first-generation SA immigrants, are at higher risk of developing type 2 diabetes, atherogenic dyslipidaemia, and coronary heart disease than most other racial/ethnic groups living in Europe. SAs also have an increased risk of stroke compared to European-born individuals. Despite a large body of conclusive evidence, SA-specific cardiovascular health promotion and preventive interventions are currently scarce in most European countries, as well as at the European Union level. In this narrative review, we aim to increase awareness among clinicians and healthcare authorities of the public health importance of cardiovascular disease among SAs living in Europe, as well as the need for tailored interventions targeting this group - particularly, in countries where SA immigration is a recent phenomenon. To this purpose, we review key studies on the epidemiology and risk factors of cardiovascular disease in SAs living in the United Kingdom, Italy, Spain, Denmark, Norway, Sweden, and other European countries. Building on these, we discuss potential opportunities for multi-level, targeted, tailored cardiovascular prevention strategies. Because lifestyle interventions often face important cultural barriers in SAs, particularly for first-generation immigrants; we also discuss features that may help maximise the effectiveness of those interventions.

The goal of model inference is to, based on time-series gene expression data, obtain the sparse topological structure and parameters that quantitatively understand and reproduce the dynamics of biological systems. In this paper, we propose a multi-objective approach for the inference of S-System structures for Gene Regulatory Networks (GRNs) based on Pareto dominance and Pareto optimality theoretical concepts instead of the conventional single-objective evaluation of Mean Squared Error (MSE). Our motivation is that, using a multi-objective formulation for the GRN, it is possible to optimize the sparse topology of a given GRN as well as the kinetic order and rate constant parameters in a decoupled S-System, yet avoiding the use of additional penalty weights. A flexible and robust Multi-Objective Cellular Evolutionary Algorithm is adapted to perform the tasks of parameter learning and network topology inference for the proposed approach. The resulting software, called MONET, is evaluated on real-based academic and synthetic time-series of gene expression taken from the DREAM3 challenge and the IRMA in vivo datasets. The ability to reproduce biological behavior and robustness to noise is assessed and compared. The results obtained are competitive and indicate that the proposed approach offers advantages over previously used methods. In addition, MONET is able to provide experts with a set of trade-off solutions involving GRNs with different typologies and MSEs.",Virtual screening of p53 mutants reveals Y220S as an additional rescue drug target for PhiKan083 with higher binding characteristics.,https://www.ncbi.nlm.nih.gov/pubmed/31128451,Computational biology and chemistry,2019 06 13,"Pharmacological intervention to reactivate p53 in human tumors holds great promise for cancer patients. A number of small molecules that reactivate p53 mutants that are either specific to certain mutation or more broadly on various mutants of p53 are discovered by rational design and screening methods. One of the most remarkable among small molecules for the rescue of specific mutant p53, Y220C is PhiKan083 (1-(9-ethyl-9H-carbazole-3-yl)-N-methylmethanamine) that have been demonstrated effective in advanced pre-clinical trials. Our attempt here is to identify additional targets of p53 mutants for rescue drugs and provide insight into the molecular level interactions of the drug with the mutant target. In this study PhiKan083 also known as PK083 is investigated, screened and validated on 28 different mutants of p53 using FlexX. Interaction of PhiKan08 with Y220C is found to be largely hydrophobic and a crucial single H-bond interaction with Asp228 in addition to few electrostatic interactions. Our study identified Y220S mutant as an additional target for PK083 as it shows a similar interaction pattern. Besides this, Docking and MD simulation studies, showed that Y220S binds to PK083 at higher efficiency as a result of improved steric and hydrophobic environment in the binding cavity in comparison with known mutant target, Y220C. Further, we point out that structure guided optimization of PhiKan08 can lead to an improved drug that can interact favourably with yet another mutant, Y220 N. In addition, this study revealed that Y220H and other mutants including native p53 does not provide any favourable interaction with PhiKan08 which is in accord with the experimental findings. These findings can facilitate the selection of patients for clinical studies and cancer survival analysis."

Due to their potential threat to the ecological environment, the toxicity of SAs to bacteria have been determined in depth, and the toxic mechanism is found to target dihydropteroate synthase (DHPS). However, other toxic mechanism may also exist for SAs, which is still unclear to us. In this paper, the toxic mechanism of sulfachloropyridazine (SCP, as a representative of SAs) was investigated thoroughly on Aliivibrio fischeri (A. fischeri) from the perspective of quorum sensing (QS). The results reveal that SCP may act on three signaling pathways, i.e., Pathway I, II and III, which triggers, maintains and destroys the homeostasis of A. fischeri respectively. In Pathway I, SCP changes the active form of LitR that regulates the expression of lux-related genes, inducing inhibition on bacterial growth while stimulation on luminescence; in Pathway II, SCP facilitates the production of C6HSL signaling molecules, maintaining the homeostasis in LitR and DHPS proteins; whereas in Pathway III, SCP typically combines with DHPS to inhibit the folate metabolism. This study can provide a deeper and more comprehensive understanding on the toxicity of SAs and help the environmental risk assessment of SAs.",Characteristics and influencing factors of organic fouling in forward osmosis operation for wastewater applications: A comprehensive review.,https://www.ncbi.nlm.nih.gov/pubmed/31128437,Environment international,2019 06 10,"Wastewater reuse is considered one of the most promising practices for the achievement of sustainable water management on a global scale. In the context of the safe reuse of water, membrane filtration is a competitive technique due to its superior efficiency in several processes. However, membrane fouling by organics is an inevitable challenge that is encountered during the practical application of membrane processes. The resolution of the membrane fouling challenge requires an in-depth understanding of many complex interactions between organic foulants and the membrane. In the last few decades, the forward osmosis (FO) membrane process, which exploits osmosis as a driving force, has emerged as an effective technology for water production with low energy consumption, thus leveraging the water-energy nexus. However, their successful application is severely hampered by membrane fouling, which is caused by such complex fouling mechanisms as cake enhanced osmotic pressure (CEOP), reverse salt diffusion (RSD), internal, and external concentration polarization as well as by the traditional fouling processes encompassing colloids, microbial (biofouling), inorganic, and organic fouling. Of these fouling types, the fouling potential of organic matter in FO has not been given sufficient attention, in particular, when FO is applied to wastewater treatment. This paper aims to provide a comprehensive overview of FO membrane fouling for wastewater applications with a special focus on the identification of the major factors that lead to the unique properties of organic fouling in this filtration process. Based on the critical assessment of organic fouling formation and the governing mechanisms, proposals were advanced for future research aimed at the mitigation of FO membrane fouling to enhance process efficiency in wastewater applications.",Interaction of benzo[a]pyrene with Cu(II)-montmorillonite: Generation and toxicity of environmentally persistent free radicals and reactive oxygen species.,https://www.ncbi.nlm.nih.gov/pubmed/31128436,Environment international,2019 06 10,"This paper presents the interaction of benzo[a]pyrene (B[a]P) with Cu(II)-montmorillonite to investigate the formation, evolution and potential toxicity of environmentally persistent free radicals (EPFRs) under dark and visible light irradiation conditions. Degradation of B[a]P and the generated transformative products on clay mineral are monitored by gas chromatography-mass spectrometry (GC-MS) technique. Hydroxyl-B[a]P and B[a]P-diones are observed during the transformation of B[a]P under dark condition. B[a]P-3,6-dione and B[a]P-6,12-dione are the main products under visible light irradiation. B[a]P transformation is accompanied by the formation of EPFRs, which are quantified by electron paramagnetic resonance (EPR) spectroscopy. With increasing reaction time, the concentrations of the produced EPFRs are initially increased and then gradually decrease to an undetectable level. The deconvolution results of EPR spectra reveal formation of three types of organic radicals (carbon-centered radicals, oxygen-centered radicals, and carbon-centered radicals with a conjugated oxygen), which also co-exist. Correspondingly, visible-light irradiation promotes the formation and the decay of these EPFRs. The produced B[a]P-type EPFRs induce the generation of reactive oxygen species (ROS), such as superoxide (O2-) and hydroxide radicals (OH), which may cause oxidative stress to cells and tissues of organisms. The toxicity of degradation products is evaluated by the livability of human gastric epithelial GES-1cells. The toxicity is initially increased and then decreases with the elapsed reaction time, which correlates with the evolution of EPFRs concentrations. The present work provides direct evidence that the formation of EPFRs in interaction of PAHs with metal-contaminated clays may result in negative effects to human health.",Long-term exposure to atmospheric metals assessed by mosses and mortality in France.,https://www.ncbi.nlm.nih.gov/pubmed/31128435,Environment international,2019 06 10,"Long-term exposure to air pollution affects health, but little is known about exposure to atmospheric metals.

The synthesized compounds were tested in a cell viability assay using human mammary gland epithelial cell line (MCF-10A) where all the compounds exhibited no cytotoxic effects and more than 85% cell viability at a concentration of 50 μM.

High risk neuroblastoma (HRNB), an aggressive childhood cancer, is especially reliant on telomere maintenance. Three recurrent genetic aberrations in HRNB (MYCN amplification, TERT re-arrangements, and ATRX mutations) are mutually exclusive and each capable of promoting telomere maintenance mechanisms (i.e., through telomerase or ALT). We analyzed a panel of 5 representative HRNB cell lines and 30 HRNB surgical samples using assays that assess average telomere lengths, length distribution patterns, single-stranded DNA on the G- and C-strand, as well as extra-chromosomal circular telomeres. Our analysis pointed to substantial and variable degrees of telomere DNA damage in HRNB, including pervasive oxidative lesions. Moreover, unlike other cancers, neuroblastoma consistently harbored high levels of C-strand ssDNA overhangs and t-circles, which are consistent with active ""telomere trimming"". This feature is observed in both telomerase- and ALT-positive tumors and irrespective of telomere length distribution. Moreover, evidence for telomere trimming was detected in normal neural tissues, raising the possibility that TMMs in HRNB evolved in the face of a canonical developmental program of telomere shortening. Telomere trimming by itself appears to distinguish neuroectodermal derived tumors from other human cancers, a distinguishing characteristic with both biologic and therapeutic implications.","Light elicited growth, antioxidant enzymes activities and production of medicinal compounds in callus culture of Cnidium officinale Makino.",https://www.ncbi.nlm.nih.gov/pubmed/31128431,"Journal of photochemistry and photobiology.

In this study different light (dark, white, blue, red and red: blue) conditions were arranged to raise callus on MS medium containing 0.5 mg·L-1 of each 2,4-D and BAP. Callus grown in dark condition showed maximum (2.0 g) fresh weight with lower total phenolic and flavonoids contents. Also, in dark condition callus faced higher catalase (CAT) and guaiacol peroxidase (GPX) activities to avoid free radicals. Mix (red: blue) light condition favored the synthesis of phenolics and flavonoids in callus at the cost of higher ascorbate peroxidase (APX) and superoxide dismutase (SOD) enzymes expression. However, DPPH free radical scavenging activity was less variable among the samples from the different light conditions. Interestingly, the HPLC profile showed higher (28.3 μg·g-1 DW) phthalide accumulation in dark grown-cultures. Compared to other light conditions, 3-butyledinephthalide accumulation was higher (0.43 μg·g-1 DW) in white light-grown callus. These findings suggest that light conditions play an important role in the regulation of in vitro callus growth and synthesis of important medicinal compounds of C. officinale."

The final developed models were robust, externally predictive and characterized by a large chemical as well as biological domain. The predictive efficiency of the developed models was then compared with the ECOSAR tool in order to justify the applicability of the developed models in ecotoxicological predictions for organic chemicals. Better predictive efficiency of the developed QSAR models compared to the ECOSAR derived predictions signifies their applicability in early risk assessment of known as well as untested chemicals in order to design safer alternatives to the environment.",Impact and tissue metabolism of nitrite at two acclimation temperatures in striped catfish (Pangasianodon hypophthalmus).,https://www.ncbi.nlm.nih.gov/pubmed/31128416,"Aquatic toxicology (Amsterdam, Netherlands)",2019 06 09,"Elevated concentrations of nitrite develop occasionally in various aquatic habitats and aquaculture facilities, providing a potential danger for freshwater fish that take up nitrite via the gill chloride uptake mechanism. We studied the uptake, effects and metabolism of nitrite in blood, heart and skeletal muscle at two temperatures in striped catfish Pangasianodon hypophthalmus, a facultative air-breathing fish that is heavily cultivated in Southeast Asia. Exposure to 0.8 mM ambient nitrite increased blood [nitrite] and [methaemoglobin] (metHb) to high values at day 1, but values subsequently decreased towards controls at day 7. Blood [nitrite] and metHb content were unexpectedly higher at 27 °C (∼1.2 mM; 69% at day 1) than at 33 °C (∼0.9 mM; 55%), reflecting a lower nitrite uptake at the highest temperature, possibly via an increased reliance on air-breathing relative to water-breathing with temperature increase. A large fraction of the nitrite taken up was effectively eliminated by being detoxified to nitrate. Further, erythrocyte metHb reductase activity was increased during nitrite exposure, efficiently reducing metHb to functional haemoglobin. The uptake of nitrite into white skeletal musculature (main part of the fish) was much lower than into heart tissue. While heart [nitrite] was close to blood plasma levels, muscle [nitrite] peaked at ∼0.2 mM at day 1 and subsequently declined to ∼0.05 mM at day 7, which is below levels reported in various commercial cured meat products. Nitrite was partly metabolized to iron-nitrosyl, S-nitroso and N-nitroso compounds. The increase in nitros(yl)ated compounds was marginal in skeletal muscle and more pronounced in heart tissue.","Interactive effects of 3,4-DCA and temperature on the annual killifish Nothobranchius furzeri.",https://www.ncbi.nlm.nih.gov/pubmed/31128415,"Aquatic toxicology (Amsterdam, Netherlands)",2019 06 09,"Although aquatic organisms are increasingly exposed to pollutants and abnormally high temperatures as a consequence of climate change, interactive effects between those stressors remain poorly assessed. Especially in ectotherms, such as fish, increases in ambient temperature are expected to affect fitness-related traits and physiology. We used the turquoise killifish Nothobranchius furzeri to study the effects of a range of 3,4-dichloroaniline concentrations (0, 50, 100 μg/L) in combination with two temperature conditions (control and control +4 °C) during four months of exposure. As part of an integrated multi-level approach, we quantified effects on classic life history traits (size, maturation time, body mass, fecundity), critical thermal maximum and physiology (energy reserves and stress-associated enzymatic activity). While no interactive effects of 3,4-DCA exposure and increased temperature emerged, our results do show a negative effect of 3,4-DCA on thermal tolerance. This finding is of particular relevance in light of increasing temperatures under climate change. Due to increases in pest species and faster degradation of 3,4-DCA under higher temperatures, increased use of the pesticide is expected under climate change which, in turn, could result in a decreased tolerance of aquatic organisms to high temperatures.",Motor resonance during linguistic processing as shown by EEG in a naturalistic VR environment.,https://www.ncbi.nlm.nih.gov/pubmed/31128414,Brain and cognition,2019 06 09,"Embodied cognition studies have shown motor resonance during action language processing, indicating that linguistic representations are at least partially multimodal. However, constraints of this activation linked to linguistic and extra-linguistic context, function and timing have not yet been fully explored. Importantly, embodied cognition binds social and physical contexts to cognition, suggesting that more ecologically valid contexts will yield more valid measures of cognitive processing. Herein, we measured cortical motor activation during language processing in a fully immersive Cave automatic virtual environment (CAVE). EEG was recorded while participants engaged in a Go/No-Go task. They heard action verbs and, for Go trials, performed a corresponding action on a virtual object. ERSP (event-related spectral perturbation) was calculated during verb processing, corresponding to the pattern of power suppression (event-related desynchronization - ERD) and enhancement (event-related synchronization - ERS) relative to the reference interval. Significant ERD emerged during verb processing in both the µ (8-13 Hz) and beta band (20-30 Hz) for both Go and No-Go trials. µ ERD emerged in the 400-500 msec time window, associated with lexical-semantic processing. Greater µ ERD emerged for Go compared to No-Go trials. The present results provide compelling evidence in a naturalistic setting of how motor and linguistic processes interact.",Fluctuations of focused electron beam in a conventional SEM.,https://www.ncbi.nlm.nih.gov/pubmed/31128413,Ultramicroscopy,2019 05 29,"Noise diagnostics was performed on a tungsten hairpin cathode that was used in conventional scanning electron microscope (SEM) which operates in a high vacuum. The focused beam was firstly measured and its power spectrum obtained in order to characterize its slope in the lower frequencies which are connected with the events occurring on the cathode surface during the emission of electrons. Further experiments involved additional noise measurements which evaluated electron beam with altering beam energy, in particular at 5 kV, 10 kV and 20 kV up to 30 kV; with and without electron beam scanning involved and with different levels of cathode heating. Obtained results were evaluated in relation to a 1/f type noise component, generation-recombination process on the cathode surface, on the shot noise and on the velocity fluctuations caused by the ion oscillations.

Many individuals use alcohol for its sleep-promoting effects. Nonetheless, alcohol disrupts sleep through multiple mechanisms, such as disrupting electrophysiologic sleep architecture, triggering insomnia, and contributing to abnormalities of circadian rhythms and short sleep duration (SSD) in cross-sectional studies. Alcohol also increases breathing-related sleep events such as snoring and oxygen desaturation, especially in those with pre-existing problems. Emerging data demonstrate that insomnia may co-exist with SSD and circadian abnormalities. Future studies should unravel these tentative associations in individuals who misuse alcohol.",Hierarchically structured ternary heterojunctions based on Ce3+/ Ce4+ modified Fe3O4 nanoparticles anchored onto graphene oxide sheets as magnetic visible-light-active photocatalysts for decontamination of oxytetracycline.,https://www.ncbi.nlm.nih.gov/pubmed/31128399,Journal of hazardous materials,2019 06 03,"The main prerequisite of an active visible-light-driven photocatalyst is to effectively utilize the visible light to induce electron-hole (e-/h+) pairs of expanded lifetime. To this end, for the first time, the ternary heterojunctions of CeO2/Fe3O4 /Graphene oxide and Ce3+/ Fe3O4 /Graphene oxide (CeO2/Fe3O4/GO and Fe2.8Ce0.2O4/GO) were prepared via facile ultrasonic-assisted procedures and employed for destruction of oxytetracycline (OTC) under visible light irradiation. The changes in the relative crystal structure, morphology, atomic and surface functional group composition, magnetic, and optic properties of magnetite were uncovered by various techniques. The substantial degradation and mineralization of OTC via visible light/Fe2.8Ce0.2O4/GO system were thoroughly discussed in terms of narrowed band gap energy, the principal function of Ce3+/Ce4+ and Fe2+/Fe3+ redox pairs and GO platelets, enhanced charge separation and transfer, and enlarged active surface area. Furthermore, the performance of visible light/Fe2.8Ce0.2O4/GO system was evaluated for treating real wastewater and its efficiency was investigated using a number of enhancers and scavengers. Finally, the generated byproducts in the course of photodegradation were determined and the oxidation pathway, photocatalytic kinetics, and plausible mechanism were proposed. The results confirmed that the introduced Ce ions and graphene oxide sheets boost the photo-catalytic efficiency of magnetite for photodegradation of OTC.",Development of Two novel silica based symmetric triazine-ring opening N-donor ligands functional adsorbents for highly efficient separation of palladium from HNO3 solution.,https://www.ncbi.nlm.nih.gov/pubmed/31128398,Journal of hazardous materials,2019 06 03,"The synthesis and characterization of two novel symmetric triazine-ring opening ligands CA-MP (pyridine derivative)/CA-BOPhen (1,10-phenanthroline derivative) functionalized SiO2-P (P = Polymer) adsorbents for separation of Pd(II) from HNO3 solutions are presented. SEM, N2 adsorption/desorption isotherms, TGA and EDS spectroscopy characterization results showed that CA-MP and CA-BOPhen were successfully introduced into the pores of SiO2-P carrier via physical intermolecular interactions. CA-MP@SiO2-P and CA-BOPhen@SiO2-P show high efficiency, high selectivity, extremely fast adsorption rates towards Pd(II) over 19 typical fission or corrosion products in HNO3 solution. The distribution coefficient Kd values of CA-MP@SiO2-P and CA-BOPhen@SiO2-P are up to 206.5 and 205.7 cm3/g, respectively, within 10-15 min of contact time in 0.4 M HNO3. The adsorption capacities of them to Pd(II) were determined to be 0.36 mmol/g and 0.23 mmol/g, respectively. The fast adsorption rates and high selectivity of two adsorbents towards Pd(II) were related to the formation of the highly preorganized complex [Pd(NO3)(L)]+ (L = CA-MP or CA-BOPhen).

A herbicide, dicamba was employed as model organic pollutant for degradation in presence with the catalyst and hydrogen peroxide. A 3D printed photon concentrator with two chips on board (COB) LEDs with visible light spectra and two complex parabolic mirror surfaces was used as photo-reactor. The findings revealed that both photocurrent and degradation of dicamba were functions of light intensity and concentrator geometry. The rapid degradation of dicamba can be attributed to the holistic and individual actions of structural components of the photocatalyst. Four distinct phenomena, including photocatalytic activity of carbon nitride, quenching of electron/hole pairs and generation of additional reactive hydroxyl radicals by hydrogen peroxide, Fenton and photo-Fenton activity of iron oxide component of carbon nitride in presence of hydrogen peroxide and photocatalytic activity of iron oxide alone in conjuncture with carbon nitride can contribute to the overall photocatalytic activity of the system.

Herein we construct an effective ratiometric fluorescent sensing platform by combining green fluorescent polymer carbon dots (PCDs) and red fluorescent tetraphenylporphyrin tetrasulfonic acid hydrate (TPPS) for specific and visual detection of Hg2+. The fluorescence of PCDs can be quenched by TPPS through inner filter effect (IEF). In the presence of both Mn2+ and Hg2+, however, Hg2+ can expedite the complexation of TPPS and Mn2+, which causes the decrease in both fluorescence and absorption of TPPS, accompanied by the fluorescence recovery of PCDs due to the subdued IFE between TPPS and PCDs. Based on the change of fluorescence signal, a ratiometric fluorescent sensing platform is constructed for specific and visual detection of Hg2+. The proposed approach presents a fine linear range for Hg2+ over the range of 10-200 nM with a detection limit of 0.038 nM. Moreover, an easily distinguishable fluorescence color change from pink to green with the increase of Hg2+ concentration can be observed by the naked eye under a UV lamp. Such a simple and effective method shows great potential for visual sensing of Hg2+ in on-site and resource-limited settings.",Mixed matrix membrane contactor containing core-shell hierarchical Cu@4A filler for efficient SO2 capture.,https://www.ncbi.nlm.nih.gov/pubmed/31128395,Journal of hazardous materials,2019 06 03,"Achieving high flux membrane contactor is significantly important for hazardous gas removal. In this study, we prepared poly(vinylidene fluoride) (PVDF)-based mixed matrix membrane contactor (MMMC) that contained a core-shell hirarchical Cu@4A composite filler (Cu@4A). On one hand, the Cu@4A regulated the physical structure of MMMC, which enhanced gas permeation and thus resulted in the increment of physical SO2 absorption flux. On the other hand, Cu@4A changed the chemical environment of MMMC by remarkably increased SO2 facilitated transport sites, which elevated SO2 concentration around Cu@4A by the enhancement of adsorption and oxidation of SO2, resulting in the increase of chemical SO2 absorption flux. Moreover, the copper nanosheets on 4A helped to construct facilitated transport pathways along the Cu@4A fillers at polymer-filler interface. The results showed that Cu@4A loaded MMMC exhibited increased SO2 removal efficiency and SO2 absorption flux compared with PVDF control membrane. Specifically, the M1040 MMMC loaded with 40 wt% Cu@4A and PVDF concentration 10 wt% exhibited the highest SO2 removal efficiency and SO2 absorption flux, which was up to 73.6% and 9.1 × 10-4 mol·m-2·s-1 at the liquid flow rate of 30 L/h. Besides, the overall SO2 mass transfer coefficient (Ko) and membrane mass transfer resistance (H/Km) were investigated.",Suspect screening analysis of the occurrence and removal of micropollutants by GC-QTOF MS during wastewater treatment processes.,https://www.ncbi.nlm.nih.gov/pubmed/31128394,Journal of hazardous materials,2019 06 03,"The presence of micropollutants in wastewater treatment plant (WWTP) poses potential risks to the aquatic system and human health.

Overall, 5724 features were identified in influent, while only 3418 features existed in effluents. Hierarchical cluster analysis (HCA) was used to group features based on intensity profiles to investigate the behavior and fate of detected features. Four representative trends were defined with the corresponding features.

This study deals with the removal of NO3- and HCO3- from contaminated wastewater using Fe-exchanged nano-bentonite and Fe3O4 nanoparticles. X-ray diffraction, Fourier transform infrared spectroscopy, scanning electron microscopy, surface area measurement and particle size analysis revealed that the adsorbents fall under the nano-scale size range with high specific surface area, and Fe was successfully exchanged in the nano-bentonite clay. The kinetics of adsorption was well defined by pseudo-first order and pseudo-second order kinetic models for both NO3- and HCO3-. The Fe-exchanged nano-bentonite was a better performing adsorbent of the oxyanions than Fe3O4 nanoparticles. According to the Sips isothermal model, the Fe-exchanged nano-bentonite exhibited the highest NO3- and HCO3- adsorption potential of 64.76 mg g-1 and 9.73 meq g-1, respectively, while the respective values for Fe3O4 nanoparticles were 49.90 mg g-1 and 3.07 meq g-1.

On the other side, Ni particles can have potential applications in the developing of magnetorheological fluids currently being used to improve the performance of mechanical devices. The present study raises the treatment of a residual effluent from a chemical nickel industry by applying a chemical precipitation which uses sodium hypophosphite as a reducer, and varying the order of the reagents involved in the conditioning of the reaction with respect to the reducer. The recovered solids were studied using different material characterization techniques to recognize the chemical composition (X-Ray Fluorescence, Inductively Coupled Plasma Mass Spectrometry), crystallinity and morphology (X-Ray Diffraction, Scanning Electron Microscope), surface charge and size distribution (Dynamic Light Scattering). By the chemical reduction treatment it was possible to decrease the amount of nickel in the residual between 97.25% and 99.50%, obtaining Ni particles that were then tested to be used in magnetic fluids.

Water samples from four potential pollution sources in South Korea were collected for toxicity evaluation. First, conventional acute toxicity test in Daphnia magna and behavioral test in zebrafish was conducted to assess water quality. Second, metabolomic analysis was performed on zebrafish exposed to water samples and on environmental fish collected from the same source. Acute toxicity test in D. magna showed that none of the water samples exerted significant adverse effects. However, activity of zebrafish larvae exposed to samples from the zinc smelter (ZS) and industrial complex (IND) sites decreased compared to those exposed to samples from the reference site (RS). Metabolomic analysis using the Manhattan plot and Partial Least Square (PLS)/Orthogonal PLS Discriminant Analysis (OPLS-DA) showed differences in metabolic profiles between RS and ZS, and between IND and abandoned mine site (M). Interestingly, applying the same metabolomic analysis to environmental fish revealed patterns similar to those for zebrafish, despite the uncontrollable variables involved in environmental sampling. This study shows that metabolomics is a promising tool in assessing the health of aquatic environments."

In the UK, services have evolved in an ad hoc way, with no standardized approach nationally. Some people are seen face to face at regular intervals, others are discharged at two years, while others are followed up over the telephone. This is creating confusion for patients as to what is best practice. The lack of evidence to support intensive surveillance is frequently cited as the main reason to reduce or indeed review the benefits of face to face clinical consultations in the hospital/community setting. In addition, a lack of specific recommendations in current guidelines compounds this. Although primary disease stage and treatment are strong indicators of survival, and time to recurrence (both local and distant) is extending, patterns of follow-up care in the UK differ depending on where you live. Yet, European and American guidelines, where survival is frequently reported as being better than the UK, continue to recommend follow-up at regular intervals as part of their overall management approach; to ensure new and changing ways of treating early breast cancer are initiated, managed and monitored accordingly. Indeed their guidelines are increasing rather than decreasing follow-up. While their health systems may differ, survival outcome reporting is not adjusted to reflect these differences. This paper provides an overview of breast cancer follow-up guidance across the world and opens up a debate about whether patterns of follow up care will affect survival outcomes into the future.",Stress response and population dynamics: Is Allee effect hormesis?,https://www.ncbi.nlm.nih.gov/pubmed/31128374,The Science of the total environment,2019 06 03,"Hormesis is a fundamental notion in ecotoxicology while competition between organisms is an essential notion in population ecology and species adaptation and evolution. Both sub-disciplines of ecology deal with the response of organisms to abiotic and biotic stresses. In ecotoxicology, the Linear-non-Threshold (LNT), Threshold and Hormetic models are used to describe the dominant responses of a plethora of endpoints to abiotic stress. In population ecology, the logistic, theta-logistic and the Allee effect models are used to describe the growth of populations under different responses to (biotic) stress induced by population density. The per capita rate of population increase (r) measures species fitness. When it is used as endpoint, the responses to population density seem to perfectly correspond to LNT, Threshold and Hormetic responses to abiotic stress, respectively. Our analysis suggests the Allee effect is a hormetic-like response of r to population density, an ultimate biotic stress. This biphasic dose-response model appears across different systems and situations (from molecules to tumor growth to population dynamics), is highly supported by ecological and evolutionary theory, and has important implications in most sub-disciplines of biology as well as in environmental and earth sciences. Joined multi-disciplinary efforts would facilitate the development and application of advanced research approaches for better understanding potential planetary-scale implications.",On-farm wastewater treatment using biochar from local agroresidues reduces pathogens from irrigation water for safer food production in developing countries.,https://www.ncbi.nlm.nih.gov/pubmed/31128373,The Science of the total environment,2019 06 03,"In this study, the suitability of an anaerobic biofilter (AnBF) as an efficient and low-cost wastewater treatment for safer irrigation water production for Sub-Saharan Africa was investigated. To determine the influence of different ubiquitous available materials on the treatment efficiency of the AnBF, rice husks and their pyrolysed equivalent, rice husk biochar, were used as filtration media and compared with sand as a common reference material. Raw sewage from a municipal full-scale wastewater treatment plant pretreated with an anaerobic filter (AF) was used in this experiment. The filters were operated at 22 °C room temperature with a hydraulic loading rate of 0.05 m·h-1 for 400 days. The mean organic loading rate (OLR) of the AF was 194 ± 74 and 63 ± 16 gCOD·m-3·d-1 for the AnBF. Fecal indicator bacteria (FIB) (up to 3.9 log10-units), bacteriophages (up to 2.7 log10-units), chemical oxygen demand (COD) (up to 94%) and turbidity (up to 97%) could be significantly reduced. Additionally, the essential plant nutrients nitrogen and phosphorous were not significantly affected by the water treatment. Overall, the performance of the biochar filters was significantly better than or equal to the sand and rice husk filters. By using the treated wastewater for irrigating lettuce plants in a pot experiment, the contamination with FIB was >2.5 log-units lower (for most of the plants below the detection limit of 5.6 MPN per gram fresh weight) than for plants irrigated with raw wastewater.

In this study, we prepared carboxylated graphene oxide (GO-OCH2COOH) sponge and investigated the adsorption behaviors of Cu2+ on it by both experimental and computational approaches. Carboxylation largely improved the adsorption capacity from 23.8mg/g for graphene oxide (GO) sponge to 93.8mg/g for GO-OCH2COOH. The efficient adsorption was due to the strong interaction between Cu2+ and carboxyl groups (especially in -OCH2COOH form) according to the density functional theory calculation, while epoxy and hydroxyl groups contributed lowly. The fast adsorption process was achieved within 30min, corresponding to a large k2 value of pseudo-second order model (0.061mg/g/min). The adsorption was spontaneous and exothermic according to thermodynamics analyses. The binding strength of Cu2+ on GO-OCH2COOH was so strong that pH and ionic strength had mild impact. The strong binding sites were not recyclable, but the weaker ones (more than 40%) could be regenerated by simple washing. Our results highlighted the importance of chemical design in graphene adsorbents and the potential of GO-OCH2COOH in heavy metal fixation from water and soil.",Functional diversity overrides community-weighted mean traits in linking land-use intensity to hydrological ecosystem services.,https://www.ncbi.nlm.nih.gov/pubmed/31128371,The Science of the total environment,2019 06 03,"Land-use intensification can importantly influence terrestrial ecosystem services by altering plant functional traits. Although we know that functional traits influence both ecosystem properties and services, we do not fully understand the mechanistic pathways governing these relationships nor how they will respond to global climate change. To identify the impact pathways of land-use intensity on hydrological services under changing precipitation regimes, we monitored hydrological services in 15 plots of different land-use types during 25 precipitation events (6 light, 8 moderate, and 11 heavy rains). Bayesian structural equation modeling was used to quantify the direct and indirect effects between land-use intensity, functional trait components (community weighted mean [CWM] and functional diversity [FD]), ecosystem properties (canopy density, litter fall and fine-root density), and hydrological services under different rainfall intensities. The impact of land-use intensity on hydrological service provisioning was regulated by plant functional traits regardless of intensity rainfall. Under light and moderate rain, FD significantly influenced hydrological services by altering canopy density and fine-root density, but we found no significant effect of CWMs. Under heavy rain, FD had significant, and greater, impacts on hydrological services than CWM of traits, although CWM of traits influenced hydrological services provision indirectly by altering canopy density and fine-root density. Land-use intensity indirectly affected hydrological services mainly by altering FD regardless of rainfall intensification, suggesting that the reduction of niche differentiation caused by land-use intensity is the main mechanism of hydrological services degradation. Our results suggested that the effect of land-use intensity on hydrological services are likely to change with increasing frequency of extreme precipitation events because of the different underlying mechanism at play and emphasize the importance of FD in maintaining hydrological services in respond to global environmental changes.",Analysis of ZnO nanoparticle-induced changes in Oreochromis niloticus behavior as toxicity endpoint.,https://www.ncbi.nlm.nih.gov/pubmed/31128370,The Science of the total environment,2019 06 03,"The toxicity of zinc oxide nanoparticles (ZnO NPs) has been investigated in different animal models. However, concentrations tested in most studies are often much higher than the ones potentially identified in the environment. Therefore, such toxicity limits the application of these studies to evaluate ecotoxicological risks posed by these nanopollutants. Thus, the aim of the current study is to evaluate the impacts of ZnO NPs (at environmentally relevant concentrations - 760 μg/L and 76,000 μg/L, for 72 h) on the behavioral responses of Oreochromis niloticus (Nile tilapia) exposed to it. Results did not evidence harmful effects of NPs on animals' locomotor abilities (evaluated through open-field and light-dark transition tests), or anxiety-predictive behavior. On the other hand, Zn bioaccumulation in the body tissues of the analyzed tilapias was correlated to changes in eating behavior (motivated by ration pellets), as well as to deficits in antipredatory defensive behavior (under individual and collective conditions). Tilapia exposed to ZnO NPs recorded lower avoidance, flight and territorialist behavior rates when they were individually confronted with potential predators (Salminus brasiliensis). However, collectively exposed animals were unable to recognize their predators, as well as to differentiate them from artificial baits (""false predators""). The present study is the first to report biological impacts resulting from the short exposure of fish-group representatives to ZnO NPs. Thus, we believe that it may be relevant to improve the knowledge about ecotoxicological risks posed by these pollutants.",Simultaneous oxidation of ammonium and tetracycline in a membrane aerated biofilm reactor.,https://www.ncbi.nlm.nih.gov/pubmed/31128369,The Science of the total environment,2019 06 03,"The membrane aerated biofilms reactor (MABR) is an emerging technology in wastewater treatment with particular advantages including high rate nitrification, and very high oxygen transfer efficiencies. In this study a synthetic feed water incorporating tetracycline (TC) was investigated in a MABR. Simultaneous removal of ammonium and tetracycline (TC) in the reactor, formation of TC transformation products (TPs), and microbial community analysis in the biofilm growing on the membrane were performed. A range of TC and ammonium loading rates and the effect of different intra-membrane oxygen pressures were on treatment performance were systematically investigated. Successful nitrification and TC degradation were achieved with the highest TC removal (63%) obtained at a HRT of 18 h HRT and 0.41 bar gas pressure. It has shown that different operating conditions (HRT and gas pressure) do not cause a significant change in ammonium removal. The concentration of TPs such as ETC, EATC, and ATC was determined to be at the ppb level. Molecular results showed that MABR reactor was mainly dominated by β-proteobacteria. The relative abundance of this group decreased in parallel with the increasing ammonium and TC loading.",Bioaccumulation and health risk assessments of trace elements in housefly (Musca domestica L.) larvae fed with food wastes.,https://www.ncbi.nlm.nih.gov/pubmed/31128368,The Science of the total environment,2019 06 03,"This study aimed to use food waste to culture housefly larvae, which serve as the major source of protein in fish feeds, to evaluate copper (Cu), zinc (Zn), iron (Fe), nickel (Ni), cadmium (Cd), and chromium (Cr) bioaccumulation and trophic transfer in the food chain. In addition, the potential health risk to humans of exposure to these metal elements via dietary intake of tilapia fed with housefly larvae feeds was also evaluated. The results showed the bioavailability of trace elements in dish waste to housefly larvae was lower than that in staple food waste. Trace element concentrations in housefly larvae fed with food waste met the animal feed standards in China and the European Union (EU). The highest concentrations of Cu, Zn, Ni, Cr, and Cd in residue did not exceed the limits specified for fertilizer in China, Canada, and Germany. The tilapia fed with dried housefly larvae presented a greater final weight and protein content than those fed with commercial feed and fresh housefly larvae (p < 0.05). The Cu, Cr, and Cd concentrations in tilapia fed with commercial feed were higher than in those fed with commercial housefly larvae or dried housefly larvae (p < 0.05). The highest bioaccumulation of Cu, Zn, and Ni was found in tilapia fed with fresh housefly larvae feed. The results of the health risk assessment showed that the tilapia fed with the housefly larvae feed pellets or fresh housefly larvae were safe for consumption from the perspective of trace elements."

The low solubility and strong sorption of PAHs in soil often limits bioremediation. To increase PAH bioavailability and enhance microbial degradation, surfactants are often added to contaminated soils. However, the effects of surfactants on the PAH degradation capacities of soil microbes are generally neglected. In this study, 16S rRNA gene high-throughput sequencing was used to evaluate changes in the soil microbial community after the application of rhamnolipid biosurfactant or Brij-35 surfactant and Mycobacterium vanbaalenii PYR-1 bioaugmentation over a 50-d mineralization study in two soils contaminated with pyrene at 10 mg kg-1. The introduction of pyrene in both soils resulted in an increase in Firmicutes and a decrease in microbial richness and Shannon diversity index. Amendment of rhamnolipid at 1,400 μg g-1 to the native clay soil resulted in a decrease in Bacillus from 48% to 2%, which was accompanied with an increase in Mycoplana that accounted for 67% of the total genera relative abundance. Phylogenetic investigation of communities by reconstruction of unobserved states was used to predict the activity of functional genes involved in the PAH degradation KEGG pathway and determined that M. vanbaalenii PYR-1 bioaugmentation resulted in an increased number of functional genes utilized in PAH biodegradation. Results of this study provide a better understanding of the soil microbial dynamics in response to surfactant amendments in addition to bioaugmentation of a PAH-degrading microbe. This knowledge contributes to successful and efficient surfactant-enhanced bioremediation of PAH-contaminated soils.",Comprehensive evaluation on removal of lead by graphene oxide and metal organic framework.,https://www.ncbi.nlm.nih.gov/pubmed/31128355,Chemosphere,2019 06 14,"Graphene oxide (GO) and metal-organic framework (MOF) as adsorbents were applied to removal of Pb(II) with comprehensive characterizations and various experimental conditions. Various characterizations were conducted to clarify the physico-chemical properties of adsorbents. The analyses of adsorption experiments included (i) dosage amounts, (ii) isotherm and kinetic studies, and (iii) several factors related to water chemistry (i.e., solution pH, background ions, and humic acid). The maximum equilibrium adsorption capacity (qe) for Pb(II) using the GO and MOF was 555 and 108 mg g-1, respectively, as determined in the optimum dosage experiments. Although the surface area of the MOF (629 m2 g-1) was much larger than that of the GO (19.8 m2 g-1), the adsorption capacity of the MOF was five times lower due to electrical repulsion. Thus, the MOF was utilized as the control group for comparison with the GO to evaluate the adsorption mechanisms in the experiments related to surface charge (i.e., under various pH and humic acid conditions). The adsorption isotherms and kinetics model determined using GO followed the Langmuir model (R2 > 0.99) and pseudo-second-order model (R2 > 0.99), respectively. Additionally, three adsorption-desorption cycles were conducted with the GO adsorbent to evaluate the maintenance of the removal ratio after regeneration and the equilibrium adsorption capacity was determined. Finally, the adsorption of other heavy metals (i.e., Cu(II), Cd(II), and Zn(II)), separately and in mixtures, was also evaluated to determine the selectivity of the adsorbents.",Formation of hydroxylated derivatives and coupling products from the photochemical transformation of polyfluorinated dibenzo-p-dioxins (PFDDs) on silica surfaces.,https://www.ncbi.nlm.nih.gov/pubmed/31128354,Chemosphere,2019 06 14,"Polyfluorinated dibenzo-p-dioxins (PFDDs) are dioxin compounds that have been detected in industrial fluoroaromatic chemicals and can cause adverse effects to organisms. In this work, the photochemical behaviors of PFDDs congeners on silica was systematically investigated. The pseudo-first-order rate constants (k, h-1) of surface photolysis changed with the substitution number and position of fluorine atoms, and the tetra-fluorinated PFDDs tended to degrade more efficiently. Octafluorinated dibenzo-p-dioxin (OFDD) was selected as a representative to explore the reaction mechanisms. Product analysis showed that OFDD was decomposed into hydroxylated PFDDs (OH-PFDDs) and hydroxylated polyfluorinated diphenyl ethers (OH-PFDEs) via hydroxyl substitution and (OH radical mediated or direct) C-O bond cleavage. Coupling elimination reaction was also observed, resulting in the formation of three-membered and four-membered ring compounds. According to the extracted peak areas in mass spectra and the energy barrier in potential energy surface, direct homolysis of C-O bond occurs as the dominant reaction pathway. This work could provide some new insights into the environmental fate of dioxin compounds.",Paraquat exposure delays stem/progenitor Leydig cell regeneration in the adult rat testis.,https://www.ncbi.nlm.nih.gov/pubmed/31128353,Chemosphere,2019 06 14,"Paraquat, a widely used nonselective herbicide, is a serious hazard to human health. However, the effects of paraquat on the male reproductive system remain unclear. In this study, adult male Sprague Dawley rats were intraperitoneally injected ethane dimethane sulfonate (EDS, 75 mg/kg) to initiate a regeneration of Leydig cells. EDS-treated rats were orally exposed to paraquat (0.5, 2, 8 mg/kg/day) from post-EDS day 17 to day 28 and effects of paraquat on Leydig and Sertoli cell functions on post-EDS day 35 and day 56 were investigated. Paraquat significantly decreased serum testosterone levels at 2 and 8 mg/kg. Paraquat lowered Leydig cell Hsd17b3, Srd5a1, and Hsd11b1 mRNA levels but increased Hsd3b1 on post-EDS day 35. Paraquat lowered Cyp11a1, Cyp17a1, and Hsd11b1 but increased Srd5a1 on post-EDS day 56. However, paraquat did not alter Leydig cell number and PCNA labeling index. Epididymal staining showed that few sperms were observed in paraquat-treated rats. Primary culture of adult Leydig cells showed that paraquat diminished testosterone output and induced reactive oxygen species generation at 1 and 10 μM and apoptosis rate at 10 μM. In conclusion, a short-term exposure to paraquat delays Leydig cell regeneration from stem/progenitor Leydig cells, causing low production of testosterone and an arrest of spermatogenesis.",Highly efficient removal of surfactant from industrial effluents using flaxseed mucilage in coagulation/photo-Fenton oxidation process.,https://www.ncbi.nlm.nih.gov/pubmed/31128352,Chemosphere,2019 06 14,"In this study, flaxseed mucilage (FSM) has been used as a green coagulant in the pretreatment stage of a combined process for the removal of an anionic surfactant, sodium dodecyl sulfate (SDS).

Using response surface methodological approach, optimum condition in the coagulation process was obtained at pH 7.0, FSM dose of 100 mg L-1 and 30 min. In the photo-Fenton oxidation process, complete SDS removal was achieved using 76 mg of the nanocatalyst, 1.07 mL of H2O2 at 17 min.

In this study, we investigated the occurrence and distribution characteristics associated to their potential health risks of selected 13 OPEs in outdoor dust with a comparison between urban and rural areas in Nanjing, China as well as seasonal variations. Ten out of 13 OPEs showed higher concentrations in urban dust than those in rural dust (p < 0.05). Six OPEs congeners exhibited significantly different concentrations with seasonal variations (p < 0.01) in rural dust. Halogenated OPEs were the dominant group in both urban (median: 56.8%) and rural (median: 45.9%) dust, and tris(2-chloroisopropyl) phosphate (TCPP) was found to be the most abundant OPE in both urban (median: 48.7%) and rural (median:26.4%) dust. Principal component analysis with multiple linear regression (PCA-MLR) and spearman correlations showed the different sources of OPEs in urban and rural dust. The non-carcinogenic (Hazard Index, HI < 1.62 × 10-5) and carcinogenic risks (CR < 2.28 × 10-9) of ΣOPEs were much lower than the theoretical threshold of risk, revealing a negligible risk to local residents from the exposure of OPEs in outdoor dust.",Wood-based biochar as an excellent activator of peroxydisulfate for Acid Orange 7 decolorization.,https://www.ncbi.nlm.nih.gov/pubmed/31128350,Chemosphere,2019 06 14,"Wood-based biochar, as a metal-free heterogeneous activator of peroxydisulfate (PDS), was successfully prepared by pyrolysis of polar sawdust for efficient removal of Acid Orange 7 (AO7). The results demonstrate PDS could be effectively activated by wood-based biochar, and AO7 was rapidly eliminated in a wide range of pH value (3.0-10.0) with AO7 removal achieved ≥ 99.3% after 14 min reaction. The dominant reactive species in the biochar/PDS system were verified via radical quenching tests and electron paramagnetic resonance (EPR) technique. It is speculated that sulfate radicals (SO4•-) and hydroxyl radicals (•OH) were formed on the surface of biochar. Based on the results of X-ray photoelectron spectroscopy (XPS), π-electron density and oxygen-containing functional groups (especially C-OH) on biochar surface were active centers for the catalytic reaction. Recycle experiments of biochar for 4 runs were carried out and the regeneration method of the catalyst was also studied.",Prenatal perfluorooctanoic acid exposure is associated with early onset atopic dermatitis in 5-year-old children.,https://www.ncbi.nlm.nih.gov/pubmed/31128349,Chemosphere,2019 06 14,"Atopic dermatitis (AD) is the most common childhood skin disease and the first step of atopic march. Perfluoroalkyl substance (PFAS) exposure is associated with atopic diseases, including AD. However, whether PFAS exposure is related to earlier AD onset remains unclear. We aimed to investigate the association between prenatal PFAS exposure and earlier onset of AD in children in a 5-year follow-up study. From 2001 to 2005, 1264 mother-infant pairs were recruited from eight Taiwanese maternity hospitals. PFAS levels were analyzed from cord blood. Information on children's health status, including AD occurrence, was obtained via phone interviews at multiple time points. Perfluorooctanoic acid (PFOA) and perfluorooctane sulfonate (PFOS) concentrations were measured by ultra-high performance liquid chromatography/tandem mass spectrometry. Cox proportional hazards models assessed associations between prenatal PFAS exposure and early onset AD. Overall, 863 mother-infant pairs with complete measurements were recruited. The prevalence of physician-diagnosed AD before 5 years of age was 7.1%. PFOA and PFOS concentrations were grouped based on whether they were above the 75th percentile. PFOA exposure was positively associated with earlier onset of AD (Kaplan-Meier estimate, p = 0.014). In the Cox model, after adjusting for sex, family income, parental atopy, breast feeding, and maternal age at childbirth, significance was observed in children above the upper quartile (≥75th) of the PFOA group (hazard ratio: 1.89; 95% confidence interval, 1.10-3.16). Our findings suggested that children with higher prenatal PFOA exposure have a higher risk of earlier AD development. Minimizing early life PFAS exposure may help inhibit AD development.",Solid phase extraction of PCDDs/PCDFs and dioxin-like PCBs from edible oils and fats.,https://www.ncbi.nlm.nih.gov/pubmed/31128348,Chemosphere,2019 06 14,"We have studied the feasibility of solid phase extraction of PCDDs/PCDFs and dioxin-like PCBs from oils and fats as the first step of a sample preparation procedure that would not involve the chemical decomposition of the matrix. A few experimental setups using dual-layer columns packed with various brands of active carbon were tested. The use of a dual-layer microcolumn with AX-21 and Carboxen 1000 carbons for dioxins extraction from animal fats, vegetable oils and powdered milk gave satisfactory recoveries which met the European Union Commission Regulation 2017/644 criteria for dioxin analysis. The developed method of solid phase extraction on a dual-layer carbon column requires lower amounts of solvents and sorbents, tolerates high amounts of fat and can be used in both manual and automated sample preparation procedures. The recoveries obtained for the most toxic congeners (2,3,7,8-TCDD, 1,2,3,7,8-PeCDD and 2,3,4,7,8-PeCDF) are within 79-119%.",Biodegradation mechanism of polyesters by hydrolase from Rhodopseudomonas palustris: An in silico approach.,https://www.ncbi.nlm.nih.gov/pubmed/31128347,Chemosphere,2019 06 14,"Massively used plastics have caused worldwide environmental concerns. Polyesters like polylactic acid (PLA) are one of the mostly used plastics due to its excellent physical and chemical properties and low-cost advantages. It is critical to develop the elimination and recycle techniques for polyesters. Experimental studies have shown that a hydrolase RPA1511 isolated from Rhodopseudomonas palustris can efficiently depolymerize polylactic acid (PLA) into oligomers and monomers. It was also active against emulsified aliphatic polymers as well as multipurpose soluble ester monomers (α-naphthyl ester and p-nitrophenyl ester). In the present study, molecular dynamics simulations and molecular mechanics Poisson-Boltzmann surface area method were applied to screen all amino acids from hydrolase RPA1511 and identify the most important amino acids during substrate binding. Seven substrates were considered: PLA (dimer and tetramer), polycaprolactone, butylene succinate, 1-naphthyl acetate, 2-naphthyl formate, p-nitrophenyl acetate. The results highlighted the importance of amino acids like Tyr139, Tyr213, Arg259, Thr46. Subsequent quantum mechanics/molecular mechanics calculations were also performed to determine the detailed degradation mechanism of hydrolase RPA1511 toward PLA and explore the role of the active site residues during catalysis. The results demonstrated that degradation involves two elementary steps: enzyme acylation and PLA hydrolysis. The corresponding Boltzmann average barriers are 20.40 kcal/mol and 14.45 kcal/mol. The electrostatic influence analysis of 15 amino acids on the rate-determining step indicated that amino acids His114, Trp219 and Ala273 facilitate the reaction while the Arg244 suppresses the reaction which may serve as future mutation studies to enhance the enzymatic efficiency."

Local governments and developers face variation in the incentives and barriers while implementing LEED-ND projects across four key dimensions - economic, policy, public awareness, and organizational. This paper investigated the drivers of variation using a mixed-methods approach including a two-stage Heckman model, a survey of Texas subdivision developers and interviews with local planning officials. Results indicate that initial public funding may lead to more LEED-ND projects being completed, but with a diminishing return as these projects become established within the region. Support for local programs including tax abatement, public-private partnerships, and other incentives were also demonstrated to help facilitate LEED-ND project adoption. Overall this paper underscored the important role, especially early on, the public sector and local governments play in initiating local LEED-ND projects to inform and motivate the land development industry.",Novel applications of waste foundry sand in conventional and dry-mix concretes.,https://www.ncbi.nlm.nih.gov/pubmed/31128334,Journal of environmental management,2019 06 09,"The use of waste materials in the building industry is a major challenge for eco-efficient construction. Brazil generates more than 3 million tons of waste foundry sand (WFS) annually, making it one of the largest industrial wastes produced in the country. This work proposes the use of WFS in two novel ways: in conventional concrete by WFS calcination, and in dry-mix concrete for the production of concrete blocks. For the conventional mixture study, mortars with 0, 50 and 100% replacement of natural sand by WFS and calcined WFS (CFS) were produced. The fresh state properties, volumetric variation, cement hydration and 28-days compressive strength of the mortars were evaluated. For the dry-mix concrete study, compositions with two densities (2.20 and 2.25 g/cm3), three cement contents and 0, 50 and 100% WFS in natural sand replacement were produced in the laboratory. Furthermore, concrete blocks of different strength ranges and 0 and 100% WFS in natural sand replacement were produced in a concrete block manufacturing plant for full-scale testing. The results showed that the use of WFS led to reductions in flowability and compressive strength of the mortars, but did not cause expansion as initially expected. In contrast, the use of up to 100% CFS resulted in mortars with flowability and compressive strength similar to those of the reference. WFS calcination removed the pulverized coal and may have formed pozzolanic phases in the clay material. As a result, the CFS presented performance similar to that of natural sand. In dry-mix concrete, the laboratory results showed that the use of 100% WFS resulted in similar strengths to the reference for concretes of up to 20 MPa. Finally, full-scale tests showed that it was possible to produce concrete blocks with 100% WFS and strengths compatible to the reference.",Long-term evaluation of the impact of urbanization on chloride levels in lakes in a temperate region.,https://www.ncbi.nlm.nih.gov/pubmed/31128333,Journal of environmental management,2019 06 09,"The application of road salts for winter de-icing of roadways in cold regions has been demonstrated to increase chloride (Cl) concentrations in nearby surface waters and have a negative impact on aquatic organisms and processes. In addition to toxicity to aquatic organisms, high concentrations of Cl in lakes can alter mixing processes, resulting in prolonged anoxic conditions and associated water quality degradation. Elevated concentrations of Cl in freshwater environments in cold regions is a well-documented phenomenon, but few studies have undertaken a long-term evaluation of the impact of urbanization on lakes. In this paper, nine lakes in the Halifax region of Nova Scotia, Canada, were monitored over 35 years to observe Cl concentrations prior to, during, and after urbanizing development. Cl concentrations were observed to increase in most study lakes over the monitoring period and all nine exhibited seasonal trending in response to winter de-icing activities. Six of the lakes achieved a steady-state Cl level after an initial increase in response to development activities, two are potentially still in transition, and one was unaffected by development activities. Watershed land use was found to be a good predictor of the springtime concentration of Cl and can help to inform decision-making surrounding development activities. When the percent of developed land was 25% or more, the Cl concentrations tended to exceed Canadian freshwater quality guidelines for the protection of aquatic life.",Managing taste and odour metabolite production in drinking water reservoirs: The importance of ammonium as a key nutrient trigger.,https://www.ncbi.nlm.nih.gov/pubmed/31128332,Journal of environmental management,2019 06 09,"Taste and odour (T&O) compounds (most commonly 2-MIB and Geosmin) in drinking water are becoming an increasingly global problem for water management. Here, the trigger(s) for 2-MIB and Geosmin production were investigated in Plas Uchaf reservoir (North Wales, UK) with detailed water sample analysis between 2015 and 2016. Historical abstraction data from this reservoir and 4 reservoirs in Somerset (England, UK) were compared statistically using Self-Organising Map (SOM) analysis. In-reservoir measurements (2015-2016) revealed an 85% reduction in ammonium from the primary external loading source led to lower 2-MIB and Geosmin concentrations, with peak concentrations of 2-MIB declining from 60 to 21  ng l-1 and Geosmin declining from 140 to 18  ng l-1. No other measured water chemistry parameter showed a significant difference between years. The SOM results support the in-reservoir findings, revealing 2-MIB and Geosmin to be associated with high ammonium relative to nitrate for all 5 reservoirs. We conclude that ammonium is key for stimulating cyanobacterial productivity and production of T&O compounds. Whilst it is well understood that adequate availability of phosphorus is required for rapid growth in cyanobacteria, and hence should still be considered in management decisions, we suggest that monitoring sources and concentrations of ammonium is key for managing T&O outbreaks in drinking water reservoirs.",,,,2019 06 09,,Isolated Extramedullary Relapse as a Poor Predictor of Survival after Allogeneic Hematopoietic Cell Transplantation for Acute Leukemia.,https://www.ncbi.nlm.nih.gov/pubmed/31128329,Biology of blood and marrow transplantation : journal of the American Society for Blood and Marrow Transplantation,2019 06 16,"Limited and conflicting data exist on outcomes of patients with extramedullary relapses (EMRs) after allogeneic hematopoietic cell transplantation (allo-HCT) for acute leukemias.

Ten-year CI of 10.5% for iEMR was associated only with advanced disease phase at transplantation, whereas 10-year CI of 34.8% for BMR was independently associated with pretransplant disease phase, lines of treatment, and fungal infections. Most iEMR and BMR patients (75% and 81%, respectively) received systemic treatment combined with local radiation for iEMR (26%) and donor lymphocyte infusions (16% and 28%, respectively) when feasible. Extensive chronic graft-versus-host disease (GVHD) was recorded in 47% of iEMR and 48% of BMR patients. Outcomes were poor both in iEMR (10-year overall survival [OS], 18.3%) and BMR (10-year OS, 19.1%). Independent predictors of OS were disease phase, type of donor, acute and chronic GVHD, fungal infections, iEMR, and BMR. In a large population with long-term follow-up, incidence of iEMR was relatively high, developed at the late post-transplant period, and was associated only with disease phase at transplantation. Furthermore, iEMR and BMR conferred similarly poor outcomes despite systemic treatment or extensive chronic GVHD.","Dynamic Graft-versus-Host Disease-Free, Relapse-Free Survival: Multistate Modeling of the Morbidity and Mortality of Allotransplantation.",https://www.ncbi.nlm.nih.gov/pubmed/31128328,Biology of blood and marrow transplantation : journal of the American Society for Blood and Marrow Transplantation,2019 06 14,"Graft-versus-host disease (GVHD)-free, relapse-free survival (GRFS) represents complete, ideal recovery after allogeneic hematopoietic cell transplantation (HCT). However, as originally proposed, this composite endpoint does not account for the possibility that HCT complications may improve after treatment. To more accurately estimate survival with response to GVHD and relapse after HCT, we developed a dynamic multistate GRFS (dGRFS) model with outcomes data from 949 patients undergoing their first allogeneic HCT for hematologic malignancy at the University of Minnesota. Because some patients were successfully treated for GVHD and relapse, dGRFS was higher than the originally defined time-to-event GRFS at 1 year (37.0 versus 27.6%) through 4 years (37.4% versus 22.2%). Mean survival without failure events was .52 years (95% confidence interval, .45 to .58 year) greater in dGRFS compared with the originally defined GRFS. Patient age (P< .001), disease risk (P < .001), conditioning intensity (P = .007), and donor type (P = .003) all significantly influenced dGRFS. The multistate model of dGRFS closely estimates the continuing and prevalent severe morbidity and mortality of allogeneic HCT. To serve the greater HCT community in more accurately modeling recovery from transplantation, we provide our R code for determination of dGRFS with annotations in Supplementary Materials.",Peripheral Blood Stem Cells versus Bone Marrow for T Cell-Replete Haploidentical Transplantation with Post-Transplant Cyclophosphamide in Hodgkin Lymphoma.,https://www.ncbi.nlm.nih.gov/pubmed/31128326,Biology of blood and marrow transplantation : journal of the American Society for Blood and Marrow Transplantation,2019 06 09,"Haploidentical stem cell transplantation (haplo-SCT) with post-transplant cyclophosphamide (PT-Cy) represents a potential curative strategy for patients with Hodgkin lymphoma (HL) when a matched related or unrelated donor is not available. The role of graft source, either bone marrow (BM) or peripheral blood stem cells (PBSCs), in this setting has not been fully elucidated. We performed a retrospective study on 91 patients with HL to compare the outcome after BM (n = 53) or PBSC (n = 38) transplant. Eighty-nine patients engrafted with no difference between BM and PBSCs in terms of median time for neutrophil (20 versus 20 days, P = .405) and platelet (26 versus 26.5 days, P = .994) engraftment. With a median follow-up of 40.2 months, 100-day cumulative incidences of grades II to IV acute graft-versus host disease (GVHD) and grades II to IV acute GVHD were 24% and 4%, respectively. Graft source was not associated with a different risk of acute GVHD both by univariate and multivariate analyses. Consistently, 1-year cumulative incidence of chronic GVHD was 7% with no differences between the 2 graft types (P = .761). Two-year rates of overall survival (OS), progression-free survival (PFS), nonrelapse mortality, and GVHD/relapse-free survival (GRFS) were 67%, 58%, 20%, and 52%, respectively. By univariate analysis, pretransplant disease status was the main variable affecting all outcomes. By multivariate analysis, PBSCs resulted in a protective factor for OS (hazard ratio [HR], .29; P = .006), PFS (HR, .38; P = .001), and GRFS (HR, .44; P = .020). The other independent variables affecting the final outcome were pretransplant disease status and hematopoietic cell transplant-specific comorbidity index. In conclusion, when planning a haplo-SCT with PT-Cy for patients with poor-risk HL, graft type is an important variable to take into account when selecting the best available donor.","Thiotepa, Fludarabine, and Busulfan Conditioning Regimen before T Cell-Replete Haploidentical Transplantation with Post-Transplant Cyclophosphamide for Acute Myeloid Leukemia: A Bicentric Experience of 100 Patients.",https://www.ncbi.nlm.nih.gov/pubmed/31128325,Biology of blood and marrow transplantation : journal of the American Society for Blood and Marrow Transplantation,2019 06 07,"Haploidentical stem cell transplantation (haplo-SCT) with post-transplant cyclophosphamide (PT-Cy) is an alternative treatment for acute myeloid leukemia (AML) patients who lack HLA-matched donors. Relapse after haplo-SCT remains a major concern, especially after nonmyeloablative conditioning regimens. Promising results were reported for TBF-based conditioning regimens (thiotepa, busulfan, and fludarabine) in patients transplanted from different categories of donors and for various disease types but not specifically in PT-Cy haplo-SCT for AML. Here we evaluate the outcome of 100 AML patients who received haplo-SCT with PT-Cy after TBF conditioning regimens (reduced-intensity conditioning, n = 77; myeloablative conditioning, n = 23) in 2 transplant programs. Cumulative incidences of grades III to IV acute and moderate or severe chronic graft-versus-host disease (GVHD) were 7% and 14%, respectively. NRM at 2 years was 28%, significantly influenced by disease status at haplo-SCT (first complete response [CR1] versus advanced AML: 16% versus 38%, P = .016) but not by conditioning intensity or age. The cumulative incidences of relapse at 2 years were 17% and 24% in CR1 and advanced AML, respectively (not significant). Progression-free survival, overall survival, and GVHD and relapse-free survival at 2 years were 67%, 71%, and 49% in CR1 patients, respectively, whereas comparative values in patients with advanced disease were 37%, 41%, and 32%. Our study suggests that TBF conditioning for PT-Cy haplo-SCT is safe and effective for AML patients in CR1. In patients with more advanced disease, the relatively low incidence of relapse seems counterbalanced by a high nonrelapse mortality, underlining the need for alternative strategies to decrease relapse risk, without increasing the intensity of conditioning regimen.",Characterization of Viral Infections after Antithymocyte Globulin-Based Conditioning in Adults Undergoing Allogeneic Hematopoietic Stem Cell Transplantation.,https://www.ncbi.nlm.nih.gov/pubmed/31128324,Biology of blood and marrow transplantation : journal of the American Society for Blood and Marrow Transplantation,2019 06 10,"Antithymocyte globulin (ATG) has been shown to reduce the incidence of graft-versus-host-disease (GVHD) after matched related donor (MRD) and matched unrelated donor (MUD) hematopoietic stem cell transplantation (HCT); however, because of increased risks of infection and relapse, this use has not translated into a significant improvement in post-transplant survival. The goal of this single-center, retrospective cohort analysis was to quantify the incidence of viral reactivation and viral end-organ disease (EOD) within the first 100 days after MUD HCT with ATG-based conditioning compared with MRD HCT without ATG. Fifty-nine adult patients underwent ATG-based MUD HCT compared with 64 patients receiving MRD HCT without ATG. Cytomegalovirus reactivation was the most frequent event in both groups (65% MUD versus 61% MRD), followed by BK virus reactivation (26% versus 24%) and Epstein-Barr virus reactivation (20% versus 9%). A higher percentage of MUD patients experienced viral EOD by day +100 when compared with MRD patients (34% versus 16%, P = .022). This was most notable for EOD involving BK virus (15% versus 6%, P = .14) and Epstein-Barr virus (7% versus 0%, P = .050). Correspondingly, more patients in the MUD group experienced virus-related complications, including hospitalization (24% versus 3%, P < .001), intensive care unit admission (10% versus 6%, P = .19), and mortality (8% versus 4%, P = .44). There were no significant differences in either relapse-free survival (RFS; 62% versus 78%, P = .07) or overall survival (OS; 72% versus 86%, P = .07) at 6 months post-HCT. However, when using the final time point of 21 months in the MUD/ATG group and 23 months in the MRD/no ATG group, MUD patients who received ATG had inferior survival (OS: 27% versus 77%, P = .009; RFS: 40% versus 59%, P = .042). Our results add to and further quantify the infectious risks associated with the use of ATG in MUD transplants and promote the implementation of more intensive preemptive viral monitoring practices in patients receiving ATG-based MUD transplants."

Although pediatric and adolescent PCNSL patients generally respond well to intensive chemotherapy, the salvage treatment for this condition remains uncertain for patients exhibiting a poor/suboptimal response to primary therapy. Proton beam therapy (PBT) is being increasingly employed especially for pediatric oncology cases. However, the safety and feasibility of PBT for PCNSL patients have not been addressed. We encountered an adolescent patient with PCNSL exhibiting 4 of 5 adverse prognostic factors at diagnosis and a residual tumor adjacent to the pituitary gland with gadolinium enhancement on brain magnetic resonance imaging after 7 courses of intensive chemotherapy. We selected local PBT at a dose of 30.6 Gy (relative biological effectiveness) as a salvage treatment for the residual tumor. After PBT, gadolinium enhancement of the residual lesion rapidly disappeared with no acute adverse effects. Moreover, during 30 months of follow-up, no neurological or endocrinological adverse effects have been observed despite the location of the tumor. The patient is now healthy and has shown no evidence of relapse.

The tumor is clinically ill-defined with indistinct margins and blends subtly with the choroid. Associated exudative retinal detachment is a common complication that is reversible with management. External beam radiation therapy (EBRT) has traditionally been used for treatment. There have been limited reports on the use of radioactive eye plaque brachytherapy. A necessary component of eye plaque brachytherapy is accurate target delineation. Unfortunately, traditional computed tomography (CT) does not reveal the footprint of this vascular tumor, especially in the presence of retinal detachment. We report a case where magnetic resonance imaging (MRI) was used to aid in radiation target delineation for radioactive eye plaque brachytherapy. A thin-slice orbital MRI enhanced with gadolinium contrast was performed to differentiate the enhanced tumor from the unenhanced subretinal fluid, allowing for hemangioma delineation. Our patient was treated with 35Gy to the tumor apex over four days via radioactive iodine eye plaque. Subretinal fluid in the macula improved within a month and the exudative retinal detachment resolved within six months. There was no recurrence of subretinal fluid at three years. Our case illustrates radioactive iodine eye plaque brachytherapy is safe and effective for management of DCH-associated retinal detachment.

The initial theory by Heinrich Warburg was that cancer cells had a deficient oxidative respiration and thus had to perform aerobic glycolysis to produce energy. However, further research suggested that there is a metabolic reprogramming within the tumour microenvironment, controlled by communication between tumour and stromal cells. The importance of this communication exposes the need to use complex models in cancer research. Until recently, classic cell models included immortalized 2D cell lines or patient-derived tumour xenografts. Despite having contributed to many discoveries, these models present many limitations. Improved models are now being developed using 3D cell culture technology. These models are more physiologically relevant allowing the co-culture of different cells types and establishing a gradient concentration of solutes. Recent developments in organoid technology contributed largely to the expansion of 3D cell technology. Organoids can be developed from different tissues including tumours, representing the cell population and spatial organization of the tissue of origin. In the field of cancer metabolism, the interaction of different cell types, the stroma, and the different solutes and oxygen concentrations are crucial parameters. Current models to study metabolism either include only one cell population or are unable to represent solute/oxygen gradients or to collect samples in a proficient manner. The characteristics of organoid culture thus makes them a potent model to use in metabolic studies, drug development, disease model or even personalized medicine.",Transition from intravenous to oral antimicrobial therapy in patients with uncomplicated and complicated bloodstream infections.,https://www.ncbi.nlm.nih.gov/pubmed/31128289,Clinical microbiology and infection : the official publication of the European Society of Clinical Microbiology and Infectious Diseases,2019 05 25,The role of oral antimicrobial agents in the management of bloodstream infections (BSI) is currently evolving.,Effect of ampC derepression on cefepime MIC in Enterobacterales with chromosomally encoded inducible AmpC β-lactamase.,https://www.ncbi.nlm.nih.gov/pubmed/31128286,Clinical microbiology and infection : the official publication of the European Society of Clinical Microbiology and Infectious Diseases,2019 05 25,We aimed to evaluate the effect of ampC derepression on the cefepime MIC in different species of Enterobacterales with chromosomally encoded inducible AmpC β-lactamase.,"Estimating the association between antibiotic exposure and colonisation with ESBL-producing Gram negative bacteria: a multicentre, prospective cohort study.",https://www.ncbi.nlm.nih.gov/pubmed/31128285,Clinical microbiology and infection : the official publication of the European Society of Clinical Microbiology and Infectious Diseases,2019 05 25,The aim of the study was to measure the impact of antibiotic exposure on the acquisition of colonisation with extended-spectrum beta-lactamase -producing Gram-negative bacteria (ESBL-GNB) accounting for individual- and group-level confounding using machine learning methods.,Characterization of fungal microbiota on normal ocular surface of humans.,https://www.ncbi.nlm.nih.gov/pubmed/31128284,Clinical microbiology and infection : the official publication of the European Society of Clinical Microbiology and Infectious Diseases,2019 05 25,Our objective was to characterize the fungal microbiota on normal ocular surface of humans with the culture-based method and high-throughput sequencing approach.,"Blood-brain barrier function, cell viability, and gene expression of tight junction-associated proteins in the mouse are disrupted by crude oil, benzo[a]pyrene, and the dispersant COREXIT.",https://www.ncbi.nlm.nih.gov/pubmed/31128282,Comparative biochemistry and physiology. Toxicology & pharmacology : CBP,2019 06 14,"Exposure to crude oil, its components, and oil dispersants during a major crude oil spill, such as the Deepwater Horizon Oil Spill, can elicit behavioral changes in animals and humans. However, the underlying mechanisms by which oil spill-related compounds alters behavior remains largely unknown. A major cause of behavioral changes generally is dysfunction of the blood-brain barrier (BBB). We investigated the impact of a crude oil high energy water accommodated fraction (HEWAF), benzo[a] pyrene (BaP; a major component of crude oil), and the oil dispersant COREXIT, on BBB function. BBB function was assessed by measuring transendothelial electrical resistance (TEER) of mouse brain microvascular endothelial cells (BMECs). Within 3 h after treatment, TEER was significantly reduced by exposure to high concentrations of all test compounds. TEER remained reduced in response to COREXIT after 48 h, but this effect waned in BMECs treated with HEWAF and BaP, with low-mid range concentrations inducing increased TEER compared to vehicle controls. At 48 h of treatment, BMEC viability was significantly reduced in response to 2% HEWAF, but was increased in response to BaP (25 and 50 μM). BMEC viability was increased with 80 ppm COREXIT, but was reduced with 160 ppm. Gene expression of tight junction-associated proteins (claudin-5 and tight junction protein-1), and cell adhesion receptor (vascular cell adhesion molecule-1) was reduced in response to HEWAF and COREXIT, but not BaP. Taken together, these data suggest that oil spill-related compounds markedly affect BBB function, and that these changes may underlie the observed behavioral changes due to crude oil exposure.",Developmental neurotoxicity of reserpine exposure in zebrafish larvae (Danio rerio).,https://www.ncbi.nlm.nih.gov/pubmed/31128281,Comparative biochemistry and physiology. Toxicology & pharmacology : CBP,2019 05 25,"Reserpine is widely used for treatment of hypertension and schizophrenia. As a specific inhibitor of monoamine transporters, reserpine is known to deplete monoamine neurotransmitters and cause decreased movement symptoms. However, how zebrafish larvae respond to reserpine treatment is not well studied. Here we show that swimming distance and average velocity are significantly reduced after reserpine exposure under various stimulatory conditions. Using liquid chromatograph-mass spectrometer analysis, decreased levels of monoamines (e.g. dopamine, noradrenaline, and serotonin) were detected in reserpine-treated larvae. Moreover, reserpine treatment significantly reduced the number of dopaminergic neurons, which was identified with th(Tyrosine Hydroxylase) in situ hybridization in the preoptic area. Interestingly, dopaminergic neuron development-associated genes, such as otpa, otpb, wnt1, wnt3, wnt5 and manf, were downregulated in reserpine treated larvae. Our data indicates that 2 mg/L reserpine exposure induces dopaminergic neuron damage in the brain, demonstrating a chemical induced depression-like model in zebrafish larvae for future drug development.",Do different diets affect oxidative stress biomarkers and metal bioaccumulation in two snake species?,https://www.ncbi.nlm.nih.gov/pubmed/31128280,Comparative biochemistry and physiology. Toxicology & pharmacology : CBP,2019 06 14,"In this study we examined possible differences in heavy metal accumulation and oxidative stress parameters in the liver and muscle of two semi-aquatic snakes: grass snake (Natrix natrix) and dice snake (N. tessellata), that inhabit the same environment but differ in prey diversity. The obtained results revealed some interspecies, inter-tissue, prey-snake and prey-prey differences in heavy metal concentrations. Grass snakes pray contained significantly higher concentrations of Al, Cr and Fe as compared to food of dice snakes. Both investigated snakes accumulated generally lower concentrations of metals than their prey, indicating that they are not at risk of contaminant biomagnification. A significant interspecies difference in accumulation was observed only for Cu and Mn concentrations. On the other hand, analysis of oxidative stress biomarkers showed clear differences between the investigated snake species and the two investigated tissues. The liver of grass snake had increased superoxide dismutase, glutathione reductase and glutathione-S-transferase activities in comparison to dice snake. In muscle, a reverse trend was observed for the activities of these three enzymes, as well as for glutathione peroxidase activity. The higher number of significant correlations observed between oxidative stress biomarkers and heavy metal concentrations in grass snake points to upregulation of the antioxidative system (AOS), which resulted in a lower TBARS concentration. Results show that while the investigated snake species did not differ significantly in the accumulated metals, their defense mechanisms were different. This reveals the complexity of the AOS and points to the cooperation of different AOS components in individuals from natural populations.",iNKT cells and hematopoietic stem cell transplantation: Two-phase activation of iNKT cells may improve outcome.,https://www.ncbi.nlm.nih.gov/pubmed/31128279,"Clinical immunology (Orlando, Fla.)",2019 05 25,"Invariant natural killer T cells (iNKT) produce large amounts of different cytokines which can influence differentiation, polarization and activation of immune cells, particularly NK and T cells. iNKT have been shown to suppress GvHD and promote anti-tumor and anti-pathogen immunity.

Bone marrow transplantation (BMT) or 'hematopoietic stem cell transplantation' (HSCT) is effective for leukemia and lymphoma through 'graft-versus-leukemia' (GVL) immunity. However, frequent serious complications include graft-versus-host-disease (GVHD), opportunistic infections and relapse. Both GVHD and GVL are mediated by T cells.

Dendritic cells regulate mucosal immune responses including the induction of T regulatory cells which are fundamental in Helicobacter pylori-induced dampening of allergies. In this respect expression of high-affinity IgE receptor (FcεRI) has been associated with a regulatory dendritic cell profile. Therefore we aimed to evaluate possible mechanisms by which H. pylori infection might modify atopy in pediatric patients. Here we show that H. pylori-infected children exhibited both increased expression of FcεRI on peripheral myeloid and plasmacytoid dendritic cells and higher levels of Foxp3 and Latency Associated Peptide on T regulatory cells. Moreover, exposure to H. pylori drove increased FcεRI expression and IL-10 secretion by both pediatric H. pylori-exposed monocyte derived dendritic cells and T cells. Finally, we show a positive correlation between expression of FcεRI in circulating myeloid DCs and total Treg cells, suggesting that in children, H. pylori infection may have a modulating role in atopy, mediated by both altered surface expression of FcεRI on children's DC and an increased T regulatory cell profile."

Approximatively, one third of patients with schwannomatosis are carriers of a germline mutation in LZTR1 (Leucin Zipper Transcription Regulator 1). Tumorigenesis in schwannomatosis responds to a somatic 5-hit/3-step mechanism resulting in a loss of function (LOF) of LZTR1 and the contiguous genes of locus 22q11.2q12.2. Effectively, LZTR1 is mapped on 22q11.2 and centromeric to SMARCB1 also implicated in the determinism of schwannomatosis and NF2, responsible for neurofibromatosis type 2. On a somatic point of view, LZTR1 mutations are known to drive with a significant frequency glioblastoma (GB) development. We report here two families in which segregate both multiple schwannomas and GB. In the first family, the proband received a diagnosis with of schwannomatosis after a surgery for a lumbar schwannoma at age 43, molecularly confirmed by identification of a germline heterozygous mutation in LZTR1. Her father, having unremarkable medical history deceased from an apparently isolated GB at age 59. In the second family, LZTR1-related schwannomatosis was diagnosed in the index case at age 70 after multiple schwannomas surgeries. Her elder sister had no neurological medical history before occurrence of a lethal GB at age 78. Molecular analysis of GB sample from both affected relatives showed the presence of the familial mutation. These observations hypothesize a potential link between schwannomatosis and the GB development.",Dual effects of gossypol on human hepatocellular carcinoma via endoplasmic reticulum stress and autophagy.,https://www.ncbi.nlm.nih.gov/pubmed/31128260,The international journal of biochemistry & cell biology,2019 06 14,"Treatment outcomes for hepatocellular carcinoma (HCC) remain unsatisfactory, and effective new therapeutic methods are urgently needed. Gossypol has been shown to have an anti-HCC effect, but the underlying mechanism requires further study. In this study, we found gossypol inhibited HCC cells in vitro and in vivo. Typical apoptosis was induced in HCC cells. Dilated ER and autophagosomes were observed by electron microscopy, and the activation of the unfolded protein response and autophagy markers suggested that gossypol induced both ER stress and autophagy. C/EBP homologous protein was the key factor that led to apoptotic cell death, whereas inositol-requiring enzyme 1α and eukaryotic initiation factor 2α played a protective role. Autophagy protected the cells from ER stress-related apoptosis. Both in vitro and in vivo studies indicated that inhibition of autophagy enhanced the anti-HCC effect of gossypol. Taken together, ER stress is the molecular mechanism underlying gossypol-induced apoptosis and autophagy. Gossypol exhibits anti-HCC activity primarily through the activation of apoptosis. However, gossypol-induced autophagy protects HCC cells from ER stress. Therefore, a combination therapy of gossypol and autophagy inhibitors may lead to an enhanced anti-HCC effect.",Towards the automated economic assessment of newborn screening for rare diseases.,https://www.ncbi.nlm.nih.gov/pubmed/31128259,Journal of biomedical informatics,2019 05 25,"Economic assessments of newborn screening programs for rare diseases involve the use of models and require huge efforts to synthesize information from different sources.

For this purpose, five feature selection ranking methods including Bhattacharyya distance, entropy, receiver operating characteristic curve, t-test, and Wilcoxon are used in the proposed topology of HMM. Here, we presented a strategy for constructing, learning and inferring the HMM for gene selection, which led to higher performance in cancer classification. In this experiment, three publicly available microarray datasets including diffuse large B-cell lymphoma, leukemia cancer and prostate were used for evaluation. Results demonstrated the higher performance of the proposed HMM-based gene selection against Markov chain rank aggregation and using individual feature selection criterion, where applied to general classifiers. In conclusion, the proposed approach is a powerful procedure for combining different feature selection methods, which can be used for more robust classification in real world applications.",Highly specific and sensitive anti-Strongyloides venezuelensis IgY antibodies applied to the human strongyloidiasis immunodiagnosis.,https://www.ncbi.nlm.nih.gov/pubmed/31128257,Parasitology international,2019 06 08,"Due to the epidemiological problem of the neglected condition of human strongyloidiasis, rapid and effective diagnosis is extremely important, with the development of new diagnostic tools being essential to reduce infections and chronic cases. Avian immunoglobulin Y (IgY) technology is an alternative for antibody production that has high specificity and profitability. This study aimed to produce and fractionate IgY antibodies from the egg yolks of hens that were immunized with the total antigenic extracts of Strongyloides venezuelensis infectious filariform larvae (iL3) and parthenogenetic females (pF). IgY antibodies were then evaluated by their recognition of antigenic proteins, evolutive helminth forms, and serological diagnosis of human strongyloidiasis by the detection of immune complexes in serum samples. Egg yolks were fractionated to obtain IgY antibodies by thiophilic interaction chromatography. Immune complex detection in serum samples showed diagnostic values for anti-iL3 IgY and anti-pF IgY antibodies at 95.56% and 88.89% sensitivity and 95.56% and 91.11% specificity, respectively. Therefore, IgY technology is a promising tool for the detection of blood circulating Strongyloides antigens, with possible application as a serological diagnostic method.",Predicting Transfusions During Left Ventricular Assist Device Implant.,https://www.ncbi.nlm.nih.gov/pubmed/31128255,Seminars in thoracic and cardiovascular surgery,2019 06 15,"Perioperative bleeding and transfusion cause morbidity and mortality in patients receiving left ventricular assist devices (LVADs). We assessed factors associated with transfusions within 30 days of durable LVAD implantation and the clinical outcomes associated with transfusions. A retrospective cohort study of patients undergoing initial durable LVAD implantation between 2014 and 2016 was performed. Rates of packed red blood cell (PRBC) or other blood product transfusions (platelets or fresh frozen plasma) were assessed. Ordinal multivariable regression analysis was performed to determine factors independently associated with transfusion. Analysis included 156 patients, mean age 54.6 years and 74.4% male, who received a mean of 11.7 units of PRBC and 10.0 units of other products within 30 days. Preimplant mechanical ventilation, dialysis, higher INR, previous sternotomy, higher model for end-stage liver disease score, and lower hemoglobin were associated with increased PRBC transfusion rates. Higher preoperative central venous pressure, mechanical ventilation, concomitant surgical procedures, previous sternotomy, and lower hemoglobin were associated with increased PRBC transfusion rates within 48 hours of implant (adjusted odds ratio [OR] 1.46, P = 0.013 per 5 mm Hg). There were no significant associations with ferritin (adjusted OR 1.00, P = 0.236) or transferrin saturation (adjusted OR 1.17, P = 0.068). Transfusions were associated with an increase in ventilation duration, intensive care unit length of stay, reoperation for bleeding, and all-cause mortality. In patients undergoing LVAD implantation, perioperative blood product exposure is common and associated with increased morbidity and mortality. Elevated central venous pressure and anemia are potentially modifiable factors associated with increased early PRBC transfusion rates.",Thyroid Hormone (Triiodothyronine) Therapy in Children After Congenital Heart Surgery: A Meta-Analysis.,https://www.ncbi.nlm.nih.gov/pubmed/31128253,Seminars in thoracic and cardiovascular surgery,2019 06 12,"Thyroid hormone modifies metabolic, immune and cardiovascular functions and has been administered perioperatively to treat a relative reduction of thyroid function in children following cardiopulmonary bypass (CPB) for correction of congenital heart disease. However, it remains unclear whether its use is associated with improved outcomes. We performed a meta-analysis of studies that evaluated the impact of thyroid hormone supplementation on clinical outcomes in children undergoing repair of congenital heart disease using CPB. A systematic review of published trials was conducted to identify studies of children randomized to thyroid hormone supplementation or placebo undergoing congenital heart surgery. A meta-analysis was then conducted to determine the clinical impact of thyroid hormone replacement on cardiac function and postoperative characteristics. The following outcomes were included for the study: duration of mechanical ventilation, duration of intensive care unit (ICU) stay, duration of postoperative hospital stay, inotrope score, cardiac index at 24 hours postoperatively, and inpatient mortality. A total of 9 studies with 711 patients were included in the analyses. All included studies were prospective and patients were randomized to either thyroid hormone or placebo. There was wide variation in thyroid hormone dosing, ranging from 0.4 μg/kg up to 5 μg/kg over a 24-hour period, and duration of therapy, ranging from a single dose after cessation of CPB to continued thyroid hormone for the duration of the ICU stay. There was a significant difference in the mean inotrope score between the 2 groups of -1.249 (95% confidence interval -1.570 to -0.929, P < 0.001), with the inotrope score being significantly lower in the thyroid group. There was no difference in duration of mechanical ventilation, duration of ICU stay, duration of hospital stay, cardiac index, and mortality between groups. In this meta-analysis, routine thyroid hormone replacement with approximately 1-5 μg/kg administered over 24 hours does not significantly alter the postoperative course in children following CPB. However, given a clinically small but significant difference in respect to lower inotrope score and shorter duration of ICU and hospital stays with higher thyroid replacement additional studies are warranted.",The rs-fMRI study of effects of Fornix and Hippocampus-related Brain Function after the Transcallosal Interforniceal Approach.,https://www.ncbi.nlm.nih.gov/pubmed/31128251,Brain research bulletin,2019 05 25,"The tumors in third ventricle are common intracranial tumors in children, characterized by various pathological types and difficult to be removed.

In the past, complications could only be assessed by clinical feature and traditional imaging, lack of quantitative data to support. Resting-state functional magnetic resonance imaging (rs-fMRI) can assess brain functional connectivity between local regions and different regions in quiet state.

Indeed, the adult mammalian brain does not regenerate tissue, but there is ongoing endogenous neurogenesis, which is upregulated after injury and contributes to tissue repair. This endogenous repair response is a conditio sine que non for tissue regeneration. However, scarring around the lesion core and cavitation provide unfavorable conditions for tissue regeneration in the brain. Based on the success of using extracellular matrix (ECM)-based bioscaffolds in peripheral soft tissue regeneration, it is plausible that the provision of an inductive ECM-based hydrogel inside the volumetric tissue loss can attract neural cells and create a de novo viable tissue. Following perturbation theory of these successes in peripheral tissues, we here propose 9 perturbation parts (i.e. requirements) that can be solved independently to create an integrated series to build a functional and integrated de novo neural tissue. Necessities for tissue formation, anatomical and functional connectivity are further discussed to provide a new substrate to support the improvement of behavioral impairments after acute brain injury. We also consider potential parallel developments of this tissue engineering effort that can support therapeutic benefits in the absence of de novo tissue formation (e.g. structural support to veterate brain tissue). It is envisaged that eventually top-down inductive ""natural"" bioscaffolds composed of decellularized tissues (i.e. ECM) will be replaced by bottom-up synthetic designer hydrogels that will provide very defined structural and signaling properties, potentially even opening up opportunities we currently do not envisage using natural materials.","Cortisol regulation of Na+, K+-ATPase β1 subunit transcription via the pre-receptor 11β-hydroxysteroid dehydrogenase 1-like (11β-Hsd1L) in gills of hypothermal freshwater milkfish, Chanos chanos.",https://www.ncbi.nlm.nih.gov/pubmed/31128249,The Journal of steroid biochemistry and molecular biology,2019 06 16,"Hypothermal stress changes the balance of osmoregulation by affecting Na+, K+-ATPase (Na-K-ATPase) activity or inducing modulation to epithelium permeability in fish. Meanwhile, cellular concentrations of cortisol can be modulated by the pre-receptor enzymes 11β-hydroxysteroid dehydrogenase 1 and 2 (11β-Hsd1 and 2). In fish, increasing levels of exogenous cortisol stimulate Na+ uptake via speciﬁc interaction with cortisol. This study investigated cortisol effects on expression of Na-K-ATPase subunit proteins and activity in gills of milkfish under hypothermal stress and revealed that the plasma cortisol contents as well as gill 11β-hsd1l and na-k-atpase β1 mRNA abundance were decreased in fresh water (FW) milkfish. Meanwhile, in the seawater (SW) milkfish, the plasma cortisol contents and gill 11β-hsd1l and na-k-atpase β1 mRNA abundance was increased under hypothermal stress. On the other hand, the abundance of 11β-hsd2 mRNA increased in both FW and SW. In addition, 11β-hsd1l expression increased in FW milkfish but decreased in SW milkfish after cortisol injection. Accordingly, the results that gill Na-K-ATPase activity of FW milkfish was affected by environmental temperatures as well as cortisol-dependent Na-K-ATPase β1-subunit levels might be due to increased expression of 11β-hsd1l that elevated intracellular cortisol contents. In hypothermal SW milkfish, decreasing abundance of Na-K-ATPase β1 protein due to reduced expression of 11β-hsd1l was found after cortisol injection. Thus, under hypothermal stress, 11β-HSD1L in FW milkfish gills was used to modulate cortisol and the following effects on increasing the transcription of Na-K-ATPase β1 protein."

A common method involves oligo(dT)19V reverse-transcription (RT)-based library preparation and high-throughput sequencing with a custom primer ending in (dT)19. While the majority of library products have the first sequenced nucleotide correspond to the bona fide pA site, a substantial fraction of sequencing reads arise from various mis-priming events, which can result in incorrect pA site calls anywhere from several nucleotides downstream to several kilobases upstream from the bona fide pA site. While these can be mitigated by increasing the stringency of oligo(dT) annealing conditions (e.g. increasing temperature from 37°C to 42°C), they still exist at an appreciable level (∼10%) and computational methods must be used to prevent artifactual calls. Here we present a bioinformatics workflow for robust identification of precise 3́ends arising from both canonical and non-canonical polyadenylation and removal of artifacts due to oligo(dT) mis-priming and 5́-end proximal sequencing errors. We test pA site calling with three different read mapping programs (STAR, BWA, and BBMap), and show that the way in which each handles 5́-end mismatches and soft-clipping has a substantial impact on identifying correct pA sites. We demonstrate the use of this pipeline for mapping pA sites in the model eukaryote S.cerevisiae and we also show that this technology can be used for 3́-end mapping of non-polyadenylated transcripts by employing in vitro polyadenylation. As proof of concept, we show the ability to identify the CC(A) tail present on tRNAs, and also find evidence for a substantial fraction of tRNAs harboring terminal 3́ CCU and CU moieties instead of the CCA tail.","When Patients Say They Know About Palliative Care, How Much Do They Really Understand?",https://www.ncbi.nlm.nih.gov/pubmed/31128230,Journal of pain and symptom management,2019 05 25,"Lack of knowledge or misconceptions about palliative care (PC) can serve as barriers to accessing palliative care for seriously ill patients.

Performing gray matter statistics with low-resolution image modalities is a challenge due to registration artifacts and partial volume effects. Gray matter surface based spatial statistics (GS-BSS) has been shown to provide higher sensitivity using gray matter surfaces compared to that of skeletonization approach of gray matter based spatial statistics which is adapted from tract based spatial statistics in diffusion studies. In this study, we improve upon GS-BSS incorporating neurite orientation dispersion and density imaging (NODDI) based search (denoted N-GSBSS) by 1) enhancing metrics mapping from native space, 2) incorporating maximum orientation dispersion index (ODI) search along surface normal, and 3) proposing applicability to other modalities, such as functional MRI (fMRI). We evaluated the performance of N-GSBSS against three baseline pipelines: volume-based registration, FreeSurfer's surface registration and ciftify pipeline for fMRI and simulation studies. First, qualitative mean ODI results are shown for N-GSBSS with and without NODDI based search in comparison with ciftify pipeline. Second, we conducted one-sample t-tests on working memory activations in fMRI to show that the proposed method can aid in the analysis of low resolution fMRI data. Finally we performed a sensitivity test in a simulation study by varying percentage change of intensity values within a region of interest in gray matter probability maps. N-GSBSS showed higher sensitivity in the simulation test compared to the other methods capturing difference between the groups starting at 10% change in the intensity values. The computational time of N-GSBSS is 68 times faster than that of traditional surface-based or 86 times faster than that of ciftify pipeline analysis.",MRI imaging and histopathological study of brain iron overload of β-thalassemic mice.,https://www.ncbi.nlm.nih.gov/pubmed/31128226,Magnetic resonance imaging,2019 05 25,"Brain iron overload is chronic and slow progressing and plays an important role in the pathogenesis of neurodegenerative disorders. Magnetic resonance imaging (MRI) is a useful noninvasive tool for determining liver iron content, but it has not been proven to be adequate for evaluating brain iron overload. We evaluated the usefulness of MRI-derived parameters to determine brain iron concentration in β-thalassemic mice and the effects of the membrane permeable iron chelator, deferiprone. Sixteen β-thalassemic mice underwent 1.5 T MRI of the brain that included a multiecho T2*-weighted sequence. Brain T2* values ranged from 28 to 31 ms for thalassemic mice. For the iron overloaded thalassemic mice, brain T2* values decreased, ranging from 8 to 12 ms, which correlated with the iron overload status of the animals. In addition, brain T2* values increased in the group with the treatment of deferiprone, ranging from 18 to 24 ms. Our results may be useful to understand brain pathology in iron overload.

Trinity assembly tool generated 104,634 transcript contigs with N50 contig being 2195 bp and average contig length at 1103 bp. Transcriptome BLASTX matching results of five nematodes (C. elegans, Strongyloides stercoralis, Necator americanus, Trichuris trichiura, and Pristionchus pacificus) were consistent with their evolutionary relationships. Sixteen genes were identified to be homologous to key elements of the C. elegans RNA interference system, such as Dicer, Argonaute, RNA-dependent RNA polymerase and double strand RNA transport proteins.

The results showed shikonin inhibited human and rat liver microsomal UGT activity only in a dose-dependent manner. The further enzyme kinetic studies demonstrated that shikonin was not only a competitive inhibitor of human UGT1A1, UGT1A9, and UGT2B7, but also presented competitive inhibition on rat UGT1A1 and AZTG reactions. In conclusion, shikonin as a reversible inhibitor of UGT enzyme has a high-risk potential to cause the possible toxicity, especially drug-drug or food-drug interactions.",Systematic evaluation of the impact of solid-state polymorphism on the bioavailability of thalidomide.,https://www.ncbi.nlm.nih.gov/pubmed/31128208,European journal of pharmaceutical sciences : official journal of the European Federation for Pharmaceutical Sciences,2019 06 16,"Thalidomide (TLD) is used to treat erythema nodosum leprosum (ENL), multiple myeloma, aphthous ulceration and wasting syndrome in HIV patients. The API can be found in two crystalline habits known as α-TLD and β-TLD. The saturation solubility (Cs) and the dissolution profiles under non-sink and sink conditions of both polymorphs were assessed. In addition, mini-capsules containing α-TLD or β-TLD without excipients were orally given (10 mg/kg) to Wistar rats. An intravenous (i.v.) dose was also administrated (5 mg/kg). The Cs values for α-TLD and β-TLD were not significantly different (α = 56.2 ± 0.5 μg·mL-1; β = 55.2 ± 0.2 μg·mL-1). However, the dissolution profile of α-TLD presented the fastest rate and the largest extension of drug dissolution than that from β-TLD (80% in 4 h versus 55% in 4 h). The α-TLD provided a more favorable pharmacokinetic than the β-TLD (maximum plasma concentration - Cmax: 5.4 ± 0.90 μg·mL-1versus 2.6 ± 0.2 μg·mL-1; area under the curve of the concentration-time profile from time zero to infinity - AUC0-∞: 44.3 ± 8.8 μg·h·mL-1versus 33.9 ± 4.7 μg·h·mL-1; absolute bioavailability - F: 92.2 ± 18.5% versus 70.5 ± 9.9%, respectively). Drug suppliers and pharmaceutical companies should strictly control the technological processes involved in the TLD API synthesis as well as in the production of the pharmaceutical dosage form in order to guarantee the inter-batch homogeneity and therefore, product compliance.",Autism-associated Nf1 deficiency disrupts corticocortical and corticostriatal functional connectivity in human and mouse.,https://www.ncbi.nlm.nih.gov/pubmed/31128207,Neurobiology of disease,2019 06 16,"Children with the autosomal dominant single gene disorder, neurofibromatosis type 1 (NF1), display multiple structural and functional changes in the central nervous system, resulting in neuropsychological cognitive abnormalities. Here we assessed the pathological functional organization that may underlie the behavioral impairments in NF1 using resting-state functional connectivity MRI. Coherent spontaneous fluctuations in the fMRI signal across the entire brain were used to interrogate the pattern of functional organization of corticocortical and corticostriatal networks in both NF1 pediatric patients and mice with a heterozygous mutation in the Nf1 gene (Nf1+/-). Children with NF1 demonstrated abnormal organization of cortical association networks and altered posterior-anterior functional connectivity in the default network. Examining the contribution of the striatum revealed that corticostriatal functional connectivity was altered. NF1 children demonstrated reduced functional connectivity between striatum and the frontoparietal network and increased striatal functional connectivity with the limbic network. Awake passive mouse functional connectivity MRI in Nf1+/- mice similarly revealed reduced posterior-anterior connectivity along the cingulate cortex as well as disrupted corticostriatal connectivity. The striatum of Nf1+/- mice showed increased functional connectivity to somatomotor and frontal cortices and decreased functional connectivity to the auditory cortex. Collectively, these results demonstrate similar alterations across species, suggesting that NF1 pathogenesis is linked to striatal dysfunction and disrupted corticocortical connectivity in the default network.",Multi-faceted strategy based on enzyme immobilization with reactant adsorption and membrane technology for biocatalytic removal of pollutants: A critical review.,https://www.ncbi.nlm.nih.gov/pubmed/31128206,Biotechnology advances,2019 06 08,"In the modern era, the use of sustainable, environmentally friendly alternatives for removal of recalcitrant pollutants in streams resulting from industrial processes is of key importance. In this context, biodegradation of phenolic compounds, pharmaceuticals and dyes in wastewater by using oxidoreductases offers numerous benefits. Tremendous research efforts have been made to develop novel, hybrid strategies for simultaneous immobilization of oxidoreductase and removal of toxic compounds. The use of support materials with the options for combining enzyme immobilization with adsorption technology focused on phenolic pollutants and products of biocatalytic conversion seems to be of particular interest. Application of enzymatic reactors based on immobilized oxidoreductases for coupling enzyme-aided degradation and membrane separation also attract still growing attention. However, prior selection of the most suitable support/sorbent material and/or membrane as well as operational mode and immobilization technique is required in order to achieve high removal efficiency. Thus, in the framework of this review, we present an overview of the impact of support/sorbent material on the catalytic properties of immobilized enzymes and sorption of pollutants as well as parameters of membranes for effective bioconversion and separation. Finally, future perspectives of the use of processes combining enzyme immobilization and sorption technology as well as application of enzymatic reactors for removal of environmental pollutants are discussed.",Recovery of Muscovy duck-origin goose parvovirus from an infectious clone containing an E-box motif (CACATG) deletion within the left terminal region.,https://www.ncbi.nlm.nih.gov/pubmed/31128205,Molecular and cellular probes,2019 05 31,"Muscovy duck-origin goose parvovirus (MDGPV) is a causative agent of MDGPV-associated Derzsy's disease. To evalute the role of the cis-acting element E-box (CACATG) deletion on MDGPV eplication, an infectious plasmid clone p-PTΔE287, having one E-box deletion at nucleotide (nt) 287 of the left inverted terminal repeat sequence (L-ITR), was constructed by overlap extension PCR deleting the 287CACATG292 motif from the plasmid pMDGPVPT containing the full-length genome of the virulent MDGPV strain PT. The p-PTΔE287 plasmid was transfected into 9-day-old non-immune Muscovy duck embryos via the yolk sac, resulting in successful rescue of the deletion mutant virus r-PTΔE287. Compared with its parental virus PT, the virulence and the replication ability of r-PTΔE287 were reduced. In addition, we examined the ability of r-PTΔE287 to manipulate cell cycle progression. The results showed that r-PTΔE287 replication results in G0/G1 phase accumulation of infected duck embryo liver mesenchymal stem cells (BMSCs) and that this accumulation is caused by the prevention of cell cycle entry from G0/G1 phase into S phase. Taken together, introducing 287CACATG292 element deletion into MDGPV PT genomic DNA that induced rescued mutant virus (r-PTΔE287) cell cycle arrest function at the G0/G1 phase, which might inhibit MDGPV replication and virus progeny production. This study laid the foundation for further understanding of the relationship between E-box deletion in the L-ITR and MDGPV virulence.","Beneficial effects of pioglitazone, a selective peroxisome proliferator-activated receptor-γ agonist in prenatal valproic acid-induced behavioral and biochemical autistic like features in Wistar rats.",https://www.ncbi.nlm.nih.gov/pubmed/31128204,International journal of developmental neuroscience : the official journal of the International Society for Developmental Neuroscience,2019 06 14,"Autism Spectrum Disorder (ASD) is a neurodevelopmental disorder in children. It is diagnosis by two main behavioral phenotypes i.e. social-communication impairments and repetitive behavior. ASD is complex disorder with unsolved etiology due to multiple genes involvement, epigenetic mechanism and environmental factors. Valproic acid (VPA), a teratogen is known to induce characteristic features related to ASD in rodents. Numerous studies suggest the potential therapeutic effects of peroxisome proliferator-activated receptor-gamma (PPAR-γ) in different brain disorders. This research evaluates the utility of selective agonist of PPAR-γ, pioglitazone in prenatal VPA induced experimental ASD symptomatology in Wistar rats. The prenatal administration of VPA has induced social impairment, repetitive behavior, hyperlocomotion, anxiety and low exploratory activity in rats. Also, prenatal VPA-treated rats have shown higher levels of oxidative stress (increased in thiobarbituric acid reactive species, and decreased in reduced glutathione level) and inflammation (increased in interleukin-6, tumor necrosis factor-alpha and decreased in interleukin-10) in the cerebellum, brainstem and prefrontal cortex. Treatment with pioglitazone significantly attenuated the prenatal VPA-induced social impairment, repetitive behavior, hyperactivity, anxiety and low exploratory activity. Furthermore, pioglitazone also reduced the prenatal VPA-induced oxidative stress and neuroinflammation in aforementioned brain regions. Hence, it may be concluded that pioglitazone may provide neurobehavioral and biochemical benefits in prenatal VPA-induced autistic phenotypes in rats.",Accumulation of progerin affects the symmetry of cell division and is associated with impaired Wnt signaling and the mislocalization of nuclear envelope proteins.,https://www.ncbi.nlm.nih.gov/pubmed/31128203,The Journal of investigative dermatology,2019 05 25,"Hutchinson-Gilford progeria syndrome (HGPS) is the result of a defective form of the lamin A protein called progerin. While progerin is known to disrupt the properties of the nuclear lamina, the underlying mechanisms responsible for the pathophysiology of HGPS remain less clear. Previous studies in our laboratory have shown that progerin expression in murine epidermal basal cells results in impaired stratification and halted development of the skin. Stratification and differentiation of the epidermis is regulated by asymmetric stem cell division. Here, we show that expression of progerin impairs stem cells ability to maintain tissue homeostasis as a result of altered cell division. Quantification of basal skin cells showed an increase in symmetric cell division that correlated with progerin accumulation in HGPS mice. Investigation of the mechanisms underlying this phenomenon revealed a putative role of Wnt/β-catenin signaling. Further analysis suggested an alteration in the nuclear translocation of β-catenin involving the inner and outer nuclear membrane proteins, emerin and nesprin-2. Taken together our results suggest a direct involvement of progerin in the transmission of Wnt signaling and normal stem cell division. These insights into the molecular mechanisms of progerin may help develop new treatment strategies for HGPS.",Role of SNAREs in the Atopic Dermatitis-related Cytokine Secretion and Skin-Nerve Communication.,https://www.ncbi.nlm.nih.gov/pubmed/31128202,The Journal of investigative dermatology,2019 05 25,"The role of soluble N-ethylmaleimide-sensitive factor attachment protein receptors (SNAREs) in atopic dermatitis (AD) is unknown. This study is envisioned to lead to the previously unreported SNARE function in AD-related cytokine secretion and epidermis-nerve communication. Herein, we report that various cytokines were simultaneously upregulated and co-released in the innate immunity-activated primary human keratinocytes (phKCs). AD-related cytokines thymic stromal lymphopoietin (TSLP), endothelin-1 (ET-1) or inflammatory TNF-α activated distinct but overlapping sensory neurons. Interestingly, TNF-α potentiated TSLP-induced Ca2+-influx, whereas ET-1 caused itch-selective B-type natriuretic peptide (BNP) release. In phKCs, BNP upregulated genes promoting dermatological and neuroinflammatory diseases and conditions. VAMP3, SNAP-29 and syntaxin4 proved important in driving cytokine release from phKCs. Depletion of VAMP3 inhibited nearly all the cytokine release including TSLP and ET-1. Accordingly, VAMP3 co-occurred with ET-1 in AD patient skin. Our study pinpoints the pivotal role of SNAREs in mediating cytokine secretion related to AD. VAMP3 is identified as a suitable target for developing broad-spectrum anti-cytokine therapeutics for controlling itch and atopic skin inflammation.",Bispecific antibody approach for improved melanoma-selective PD-L1 immune checkpoint blockade.,https://www.ncbi.nlm.nih.gov/pubmed/31128201,The Journal of investigative dermatology,2019 05 25,"Reactivation of functionally-impaired anticancer T cells by PD-1/PD-L1-blocking antibodies shows prominent therapeutic benefit in advanced melanoma and NCSLC patients. However, current PD-L1-blocking antibodies lack intrinsic tumor-selectively. Therefore, efficacy may be reduced due to 'on-target/off-tumor' binding to PD-L1-expressing normal cells. This may lead to indiscriminate activation of antigen-experienced T cells, including those implicated in autoimmune-related adverse events. To direct PD-L1-blockade to CSPG4-expressing cancers and to reactivate anticancer T cells more selectively we constructed bispecific antibody (bsAb) PD-L1xCSPG4. CSPG4 is an established target antigen that is selectively overexpressed on malignant melanoma and various other difficult-to-treat cancers. PD-L1xCSPG4 showed enhanced capacity for CSPG4-directed blockade of PD-L1 on cancer cells. Importantly, treatment of mixed-cultures containing primary patient-derived CSPG4-expressing melanoma cells and autologous tumor-infiltrating lymphocytes with PD-L1xCSPG4 significantly enhanced activation status, IFN-γ production, and cytolytic activity of anticancer T cells. In conclusion, tumor-directed blockade of PD-L1 by PD-L1xCSPG4 may improve efficacy and safety of PD-1/PD-L1 checkpoint blockade for treatment of melanoma and other CSPG4-overexpressing malignancies.",Predictors and patterns of eating behaviors across childhood: Results from The Generation R study.,https://www.ncbi.nlm.nih.gov/pubmed/31128200,Appetite,2019 05 25,"Only a few studies have prospectively examined stability of eating behaviors in childhood.

The produced oxidized starch was coarse, brownish with 15.68% carbonyl content, insoluble in cold water and has a positive influence on bioplastic films. The film thickness increased with increase in the amount of added oxidized starch from 0.21% (filmO) to 0.23% (film6O). The film moisture content dropped from 7.93% (filmO) to 5.36% (film6O), likewise the film water solubility decreased from 13.48% (filmO) to 5.75% (film6O). Addition of oxidized starch led to longer biodegradability and enduring water absorption kinetics. The mechanical property was improved by the addition of oxidized starch. The derivative thermogravimetry analysis indicates five degradation stages for all the bioplastic films, while films surface roughness was shown by AFM. The research has revealed that oxidized starch can be used to improve the physicomechanical properties of starch based bioplastic film.",Chitosan hydrogel inclusion in fish mince based emulsion sausages: Effect of gel interaction on functional and physicochemical qualities.,https://www.ncbi.nlm.nih.gov/pubmed/31128188,International journal of biological macromolecules,2019 06 15,"Chitosan has been reported to possess diverse applications in food industry. The cross linking properties of chitosan beneficially affects the protein-carbohydrate interactions which in turn enhances the functional properties in emulsion based meat products.

The comparative analysis of various functional properties of the produced sausages showed that inclusion of chitosan gel had significant effect (p < 0.05) on the emulsion stability, gel-strength, pH, cooking yield, WHC, structural-compactness, texture, colour and sensory attributes of the products when compared with control. Further, from the study, it can be inferred that, sausages with 0.25% chitosan content (CS-2) uphold the best necessary functional and physiochemical attributes and presumed to be a superior ready-to eat product.","Chitosan-acorn starch-eugenol edible film: Physico-chemical, barrier, antimicrobial, antioxidant and structural properties.",https://www.ncbi.nlm.nih.gov/pubmed/31128187,International journal of biological macromolecules,2019 06 15,"Edible films from chitosan (CH) containing various amount of acorn starch (AS) and eugenol (Eu) were developed by casting and solvent-evaporation method, and their physico-chemical, barrier, antimicrobial, antioxidant and structural properties were also investigated. The experimental data showed that an appropriate proportion of AS could improve the mechanical and barrier properties of the film, and the incorporation of Eu in the film significantly improved the flexibility, barrier, hydrophobicity, antimicrobial and antioxidant properties. The results showed that the optimum comprehensive properties of the film were obtained when the mass ratio of AS to CH was 0.9 and the content of Eu was 9%. Possible intermolecular interactions between CH, AS and Eu were confirmed by Fourier-transform infrared spectroscopy (FTIR). SEM indicated that a good compatibility was present between CH and AS, and Eu was well emulsified and dispersed in the film matrix network. TG and DTG curves further confirmed Eu present in the film matrix network.

The concentration of polyol was fixed at 20 wt%. FTIR result showed that the addition of polyols weakened the hydrogen bonding between chitosan molecules, whereas the electrostatic interactions remained nearly unchanged. Structural analysis revealed that the plasticizer which promoted the crystallization of chitosan was moisture rather than polyol contained in the polymer films. DSC result indicated that glycerol plasticized film had a lower glass transition temperature (Tg) and lower melting temperature (Tm). The low thermal transition temperatures suggested that the moisture content is higher in glycerol plasticized film, which was evidenced by TGA result. In addition, the polyols incorporation resulted in a decrease of the tensile strength of chitosan films, while their ductility was improved. These observations indicate that the addition of polyols as plasticizers could regulate the microstructure as well as the properties of chitosan films, which is essential for their usage in food industry.","Grafting of chitosan-acrylamide hybrid on the wool: Characterization, reactive dyeing, antioxidant and antibacterial studies.",https://www.ncbi.nlm.nih.gov/pubmed/31128183,International journal of biological macromolecules,2019 06 15,"This study presents a new approach to enhance reactive dye uptake and functional finishing of wool yarns via simple grafting with synthesized chitosan-acrylamide (Ch-Ac) hybrid.

Then, Ch-Ac was grafted on wool, characterized with FTIR, SEM, and weight gain analysis and dyeability with two commercial reactive dyes. Results showed that Ch-Ac treated wool could be dyed at lower temperatures (ca. 40 °C), times (ca. 30 min), and amount of reactive dye (2% owf) as compared to raw wool. Also, deeper shades not obtainable in conventional dyeing could be attained using Ch-Ac treated wool. In addition, Ch-Ac treatment imparted very good radical scavenging and excellent antibacterial activity against gram-negative (E. coli) and gram-positive (S. aureus) bacteria. Color fastness results confirmed that Ch-Ac treatment had no adverse effect on durability of dyes against washing, light, rubbing and perspiration.

Meanwhile, the release characteristics of EGCG from edible films and its antioxidant activity in fat food simulant (95% ethanol) were also detected. The results showed that the addition of EGCG could improve the tensile strength (TS) of edible films and reduce their elongation at break (E). Especially, the color of edible film added with EGCG deepened and the transmittance decreased. Scanning electron microscopy (SEM) images displayed that the films were dense and compact with a little roughness. Fourier transform infrared spectroscopy (FTIR) analysis indicated that the incorporation of EGCG into SA-CMC caused interactions occurring between SA-CMC and EGCG. In addition, the release and DPPH radical scavenging assay of incorporating EGCG in SA-CMC films showed that the obtained SA-CMC films with high EGCG content could release EGCG slowly and had strong antioxidant activity in fatty foods.

However, the contribution of MRTF-A to the development of atherosclerosis remains unknown. Macrophages are known to be important mediators of atherosclerosis. It has been demonstrated that local proliferation and survival of macrophages are atherogenic. In this study, we found that MRTF-A was highly expressed in lesional macrophages in human carotid atherosclerotic plaque. We then investigated the role of macrophagic MRTF-A in the pathogenesis of atherosclerosis. ApoE null MRTF-A transgenic mice (ApoE-/-/MRTF-Atg/+), in which human MRTF-A was specifically overexpressed in monocytes/macrophages, were established and fed with normal diet to examine the progression of atherosclerosis. We found that ApoE-/-/MRTF-Atg/+ aggravated atherosclerosis and lesional macrophages were more prominently accumulated in the aortic sinus of ApoE-/-/MRTF-Atg/+ than in that of ApoE-/- littermates. We also found that MRTF-A promoted proliferation and mitigated apoptosis of macrophages both in vitro and in vivo, and down regulated the expression of cyclin-dependent kinase inhibitors. From these findings, we conclude that MRTF-A modulates functional properties of pro-atherogenic macrophages. Our study may play a valuable role in understanding the pathological role of macrophagic MRTF-A in the progression of atherosclerosis.",Time-dependent changes in cognitive flexibility performance during intermittent social stress: Relevance for motivation and reward-seeking behavior.,https://www.ncbi.nlm.nih.gov/pubmed/31128165,Behavioural brain research,2019 06 09,"Repeated exposure to stress produces cognitive impairments that can lead to psychiatric disorders.

Set-shifting performance was evaluated before and in between social stress episodes, and up to ten days after the end of the stress protocol. Plasma levels of corticosterone after tail-pinch were also measured after the last set-shifting session. Intermittent exposure to social stress did not impair cognitive flexibility but produced short-and long-term changes in set-shifting performance. After the third social defeat episode, stressed animals required significantly more time to respond to cues (instrumental action) and to poke in the food-trough when no food pellet was delivered. These effects were reversed ten days after stress and suggest a decrease in motivation to pursue rewards. In contrast, stressed animals responded more accurately to light cues that predicted rewards. This effect, which emerged ten days after stress, suggests an increase in the reactivity to salient cues in the long-term. These time-dependent behavioral changes might help to understand the transition from social stress to stress-related disorders including drug abuse.",Memory consolidation impairment induced by Interleukin-1β is associated with changes in hippocampal structural plasticity.,https://www.ncbi.nlm.nih.gov/pubmed/31128164,Behavioural brain research,2019 06 09,"Pro-inflammatory cytokines, particularly Interleukin-1β (IL-1β), can affect cognitive processes such as learning and memory. The aim of this study was to establish whether the effect of IL-1β on contextual fear memory is associated with changes in hippocampal structural plasticity. We also studied the effect of α-melanocyte-stimulating hormone (α-MSH), a potent anti-inflammatory and neuro-protective peptide. Different groups of animals were implanted bilaterally in dorsal hippocampus (DH). After recovery they were conditioned for contextual fear memory and received the different treatments (vehicle, IL-1β, α-MSH or IL-1β + α-MSH). Memory was assessed 24 hs after conditioning and immediately after rats were perfused for dendritic spine analysis. Our results show that local hippocampal administration of IL-1β just after memory encoding induced impairment in contextual memory and a reduction in the total density of CA1 hippocampal dendritic spines, particularly the mature ones. α-MSH administration reversed the IL-1β induced changes. The results suggest that neuro-inflammation induced by IL-1β interferes with experience-dependent structural plasticity in DH whereas α-MSH has a beneficial modulatory role in preventing this effect.",Regional gray matter reductions associated with mild cognitive impairment in Parkinson's disease: A meta-analysis of voxel-based morphometry studies.,https://www.ncbi.nlm.nih.gov/pubmed/31128163,Behavioural brain research,2019 06 10,"Mild cognitive impairment (MCI) is inconclusively associated with regional gray matter (GM) abnormalities in Parkinson's disease (PD). We aimed to quantitatively evaluate whole-brain voxel-based morphometry (VBM) studies that have investigated brain GM changes in PD patients with MCI (PD-MCI). Seed-based d Mapping, a well-validated coordinate-based meta-analytic approach, was utilized. We included 20 VBM studies that reported 22 datasets containing 504 patients with PD-MCI and 554 PD patients without MCI (PD-NCI). The most reliable finding identified in this meta-analysis was that patients with PD-MCI exhibited greater GM atrophy in the left anterior insula than those with PD-NCI. Our findings further suggest that several moderators (age, gender, educational level, disease stage, severity of motor disability, and the severity of cognitive impairments) in PD-MCI individuals, as well as scanner field-strength, may drive heterogeneous GM changes across studies. GM abnormalities in the anterior insula, an important cognitive hub involved in switching between neural networks, contribute to understanding the neural substrates of MCI in PD, which may serve as a biomarker of PD-MCI.",Conditioned place preferences induced by hearing song outside the breeding season relate to neural dopamine D1 and cannabinoid CB1 receptor gene expression in female European starlings (Sturnus vulgaris).,https://www.ncbi.nlm.nih.gov/pubmed/31128162,Behavioural brain research,2019 06 10,"The affective state induced by sensory stimuli changes to adaptively modify behaviors that are critical for survival and reproduction. In European starlings, during the spring breeding season, male courtship song is rewarding to females, but only to those that possess resources that are necessary for reproduction (i.e., nesting sites). In fall, starling song is non-sexual and proposed to maintain flocks. This suggests that in fall it may be adaptive for females to be rewarded by fall rather than spring, courtship song. We used a conditioned place preference (CPP) test to evaluate song-induced affective state in fall condition females and quantitative real-time PCR to measure expression of genes that modulate affective state (CB1 endocannabinoid and D1 dopamine receptors) in brain regions that were previously implicated in song-induced reward (i.e., the medial preoptic nucleus (mPOA) and ventromedial hypothalamus (VMH)). Fall condition females developed an aversion to a place that had been paired with playback of both male fall and courtship song, indicating that in general male song induces a negative affective state outside the breeding season. Song-induced aversion was stronger in birds conditioned towards an initial place preference. For mPOA, CB1 receptor expression correlated positively with fall and spring song-induced CPP. D1 receptor expression correlated negatively with fall (but not spring) song-induced CPP, and the ratio of CB1 to D1 receptor expression correlated positively with fall (but not spring) song-induced CPP. These correlations suggest that interactions between D1 and CB1 receptors in mPOA may play a role in modifying affective responses to song.",Eye Drop Instillation of the Rac1 Modulator CNF1 Attenuates Retinal Gliosis and Ameliorates Visual Performance in a Rat Model of Hypertensive Retinopathy.,https://www.ncbi.nlm.nih.gov/pubmed/31128161,Neuroscience,2019 06 15,"In hypertensive retinopathy, the retinal damage due to high blood pressure is accompanied by increased expression of Glial Fibrillary Acidic Protein (GFAP), which indicates a role of neuroinflammatory processes in such a retinopathy. Proteins belonging to the Rho GTPase family, particularly Rac1, are involved in the activation of Müller glia and in the progression of photoreceptor degeneration, and may thus represent a novel candidate for therapeutic intervention following central nervous system inflammation. In this paper, we have observed that topical administration as eye drops of Cytotoxic Necrotizing Factor 1 (CNF1), a Rho GTPase modulator, surprisingly improves electrophysiological and behavioral visual performances in aged spontaneously hypertensive rats. Furthermore, such functional improvement is accompanied by a reduction of Rac1 activity and retinal GFAP expression. Our results suggest that Rac1 inhibition through CNF1 topical administration may represent a new strategy to target retinal gliosis.","Expression Analysis of Serotonin Receptors, Serotonin Transporter and l-Amino Acid Decarboxylase in the Mouse Sphenopalatine Ganglion by RT-PCR, Northern Blot Analysis and In Situ Hybridization.",https://www.ncbi.nlm.nih.gov/pubmed/31128160,Neuroscience,2019 06 15,"The sphenopalatine ganglion (SPG) is a gathering of the cell bodies of parasympathetic fibers that dominate the nasal gland, lacrimal gland and cerebral blood vessels. The SPG controls nasal secretions, tears, and the dilation of cerebral blood vessels. However, it is unclear how serotonin regulates SPG functions. In this study, we investigated the expression of genes involved in the serotonergic system in the mouse SPG. We examined the mRNA expression levels of 5-HT1A, 5-HT1B, 5-HT1D, 5-HT1F, 5-HT2A, 5-HT2B, 5-HT2C, 5-HT3A, 5-HT3B, 5-HT4, 5-HT5A, 5-HT5B, 5-HT6 and 5-HT7 receptors, as well as serotonin transporter, tryptophan hydroxylases 1 and 2, and L-amino acid decarboxylase (AADC) by RT-PCR. It revealed that the 5-HT3A and 5-HT3B ionotropic receptors and AADC were likely to be highly expressed in the SPG, as measured by RT-PCR. We next performed in situ hybridization on the SPG to examine the expression of these three genes at the cellular level after validating the specificity of each cRNA probe by northern blotting. The 5-HT3A receptor, 5-HT3B receptor, and AADC were expressed in 96.5% ± 1.0%, 29.7% ± 10.7%, and 57.4% ± 2.9% of neuronal cell bodies in the SPG, respectively, indicating that the 5-HT3A receptor was virtually expressed in all SPG neurons. Our results on the expression of these critical serotonin system genes in the parasympathetic SPG provide insight into the pathogenetics of rhinitis, conjunctivitis and headache. Furthermore, our findings suggest that targeting the 5-HT3A receptor might have therapeutic potential in the treatment of these ailments.",Immune Mediators of Pathology in Neurobrucellosis: From Blood to Central Nervous System.,https://www.ncbi.nlm.nih.gov/pubmed/31128159,Neuroscience,2019 06 10,"Neurobrucellosis, which is the most morbid form of brucellosis disease, presents with inflammatory signs and symptoms. Recent experimental evidence clearly indicates that deregulation of astrocytes and microglia caused by Brucella infection creates a microenvironment in the central nervous system (CNS) in which secretion of pro-inflammatory mediators lead to destabilization of the glial structure, the damage of the blood brain barrier (BBB) and neuronal demise. This review of Brucella interactions with cells of the CNS and the BBB is intended to present recent immunological findings that can explain, at least in part, the basis for the inflammatory pathogenesis of the nervous system that takes place upon Brucella infection.",Nuclei of HeLa cells interactomes unravel a network of ghost proteins involved in proteins translation.,https://www.ncbi.nlm.nih.gov/pubmed/31128158,Biochimica et biophysica acta. General subjects,2019 06 05,"Ghost proteins are issued from alternative Open Reading Frames (ORFs) and are missing a genome annotation. Indeed, historical filters applied for the detection of putative translated ORFs led to a wrong classification of transcripts considered as non-coding although translated proteins can be detected by proteomics. This Ghost (also called Alternative) proteome was neglected, and one major issue is to identify the implication of the Ghost proteins in the biological processes. In this context, we aimed to identify the protein-protein interactions (PPIs) of the Ghost proteins. For that, we re-explored a cross-link MS study performed on nuclei of HeLa cells using cross-linking mass spectrometry (XL-MS) associated with the HaltOrf database. Among 1679 cross-link interactions identified, 292 are involving Ghost Proteins. Forty-Four of these Ghost proteins are found to interact with 7 Reference proteins related to ribonucleoproteins, ribosome subunits and zinc finger proteins network. We, thus, have focused our attention on the heterotrimer between the RE/poly(U)-binding/degradation factor 1 (AUF1), the Ribosomal protein 10 (RPL10) and AltATAD2. Using I-Tasser software we performed docking models from which we could suggest the attachment of AUF1 on the external part of RPL10 and the interaction of AltATAD2 on the RPL10 region interacting with 5S ribosomal RNA as a mechanism of regulation of the ribosome. Taken together, these results reveal the importance of Ghost Proteins within known protein interaction networks.",Protective effect of gastrodin against methamphetamine-induced autophagy in human dopaminergic neuroblastoma SH-SY5Y cells via the AKT/mTOR signaling pathway.,https://www.ncbi.nlm.nih.gov/pubmed/31128157,Neuroscience letters,2019 06 16,"Methamphetamine (METH) has been shown to induce neuropathological dysfunction and irreversible brain cell damage. Prior studies indicated the involvement of autophagy in METH-induced neurotoxicity. However, the underlying mechanism by which autophagy contributes to METH-induced neurotoxicity remains elusive. Gastrodin, a primary bioactive constituent of Gastrodia elata-an orchid used in traditional Chinese medicine-is used widely to treat stroke, dementia, and headache. This study investigates whether METH induces autophagy in the human dopaminergic neuroblastoma cell line SH-SY5Y, then examines the neuroprotective effects of gastrodin against autophagy in METH-treated SH-SY5Y cells. The effects of METH on the protein expressions of autophagy-related genes (LC3B and Beclin-1) were evaluated with and without gastrodin. The presence of autophagosomes in the METH-induced treatment with and without gastrodin is revealed through transmission electron microscopy. Pharmacological intervention was employed to study the role of the AKT/mTOR signaling pathway in the gastrodin-mediated neuroprotection against METH-induced autophagy. The present results indicate that METH exposure elevates the protein expression levels of LC3B and Beclin-1 in a dose- and time-dependent manner. Gastrodin is observed to block the METH-induced upregulation of LC3B and Beclin-1 protein expression significantly. Gastrodin is found to exhibit an anti-autophagic effect on the inhibition of the METH-induced Beclin-1 protein expression, partly via the AKT/mTOR These findings may aid the development of a gastrodin-based therapeutic strategy for treating METH-induced neurotoxicity."

An ideal palliative radiation regimen should alleviate symptoms secondary to the cancer with minimal treatment toxicity and side effects, while improving a patient's quality of life. This review presents the different treatment approaches, the outcomes and toxicities associated with different radiation regimens, and proposes a multidisciplinary framework for the selection of an individualized treatment regimen for patients that centers around patient prognosis, goals of care, logistics of treatment, and the availability of other surgical and systemic therapies.","Hydrogel-based ocular drug delivery systems: Emerging fabrication strategies, applications, and bench-to-bedside manufacturing considerations.",https://www.ncbi.nlm.nih.gov/pubmed/31128143,Journal of controlled release : official journal of the Controlled Release Society,2019 06 14,"The physiological barriers of the eye pose challenges to the delivery of the array of therapeutics for ocular diseases.

The first model, describing the overall epidemic dynamics, provides the starting data for the second model which different influenza subtypes, and whose dynamics is further investigated. Weekly data from December 2017 to May 2018 are obtained from the data base of the Centre of Health Protection in Hong Kong, and used to parametrise the models. With the help of these models, we investigate the impact of different vaccination strategies and determine the corresponding critical vaccination coverage for different vaccine efficacies. The results suggest that at least 72% of Hong Kong population should have been vaccinated during 2017-2018 winter to prevent the seasonal epidemic by herd immunity (while data showed that only a maximum of 11.6% of the population were vaccinated). Our results also show that the critical vaccination coverage decreases with increasing vaccine efficacy, and the increase in one influenza subtype vaccine efficacy may lead to an increase in infections caused by a different subtype.",Approximate nutrient flux and concentration solutions of the Nye-Tinker-Barber model by the perturbation expansion method.,https://www.ncbi.nlm.nih.gov/pubmed/31128141,Journal of theoretical biology,2019 06 14,"The Nye-Tinker-Barber model is a basic and representative one for single-ion nutrient uptake by plant root from the soil and we aim to derive its approximate analytical solutions of flux and concentration. We divide the rhizosphere into the inner and the outer fields, match the inner and the outer solutions near the root surface, and then obtain the approximate analytical solutions of nutrient uptake flux at the root surface and global nutrient concentration of the diffusion or the convection-diffusion Nye-Tinker-Barber model. The analytical and numerical fluxes of K+ and [Formula: see text] decay quickly to 0 in less than 3 days while [Formula: see text] and Cd2+ gradually decrease in more than 15 days; the depletion profile spread of [Formula: see text] is apparently narrower than [Formula: see text] and K+ in 24 days. The different flux and concentration patterns of 4 nutrients result from their mobility and solubility in the rhizosphere. In comparison with the numerical simulations and the previous analytical results, we find that the analytical flux will overestimate the numerical flux of [Formula: see text] and Cd2+ while the analytical concentration can accurately predict the numerical concentration; the flux and the concentration solutions of the convection-diffusion Nye-Tinker-Barber model can be simplified to the diffusion versions by the Péclet number, and they can more widely describe the transport of nutrients of different attributes in soils of different textures with different levels of saturation, conductivity and permeability.",A stochastic model of adult neurogenesis coupling cell cycle progression and differentiation.,https://www.ncbi.nlm.nih.gov/pubmed/31128140,Journal of theoretical biology,2019 06 07,"Long-term tissue homeostasis requires a precise balance between stem cell self-renewal and the generation of differentiated progeny. Recently, it has been shown that in the adult murine brain, neural stem cells (NSCs) divide mostly symmetrically. This finding suggests that the required balance for tissue homeostasis is accomplished at the population level. However, it remains unclear how this balance is enabled. Furthermore, there is experimental evidence that proneural differentiation factors not only promote differentiation, but also cell cycle progression, suggesting a link between the two processes in NSCs. To study the effect of such a link on NSC dynamics, we developed a stochastic model in which stem cells have an intrinsic probability to progress through cell cycle and to differentiate. Our results show that increasing heterogeneity in differentiation probabilities leads to a decreased probability of long-term tissue homeostasis, and that this effect can be compensated when cell cycle progression and differentiation are positively coupled. Using single-cell RNA-Seq profiling of adult NSCs, we found a positive correlation in the expression levels of cell cycle and differentiation markers. Our findings suggest that a coupling between cell cycle progression and differentiation on the cellular level is part of the process that maintains tissue homeostasis in the adult brain.",A coupled multiscale model to guide malaria control and elimination.,https://www.ncbi.nlm.nih.gov/pubmed/31128139,Journal of theoretical biology,2019 06 07,"In this paper, we share with the biomathematics community a new coupled multiscale model which has the potential to inform policy and guide malaria control and elimination. The formulation of this multiscale model is based on integrating four submodels which are: (i) a sub-model for the mosquito-to-human transmission of malaria parasite, (ii) a sub-model for the human-to-mosquito transmission of malaria parasite, (iii) a within-mosquito malaria parasite population dynamics sub-model and (iv) a within-human malaria parasite population dynamics sub-model. The integration of the four submodels is achieved by assuming that the transmission parameters of the sub-model for the mosquito-to-human transmission of malaria at the epidemiological scale are functions of the dependent variables of the within-mosquito sporozoite population dynamics while the transmission parameters of the sub-model for the human-to-mosquito transmission of malaria are functions of the dependent variables of the within-human gametocyte population dynamics. This establishes a unidirectionally coupled multiscale model where the within-human and within-mosquito submodels are unidirectionally coupled to the human-to-mosquito and mosquito-to-human submodels. A fast and slow time scale analysis is performed on this system. The result is a simple multiscale model which describes the mechanics of malaria transmission in terms of the major components of the complete malaria parasite life-cycle. This multiscale modelling approach may be found useful in guiding malaria control and elimination.",Type 2 diabetes mellitus reduces clinical complications and mortality in Stanford type B aortic dissection after thoracic endovascular aortic repair: A 3-year follow-up study.,https://www.ncbi.nlm.nih.gov/pubmed/31128138,Life sciences,2019 05 25,Previous studies have demonstrated that type 2 diabetes mellitus (T2DM) is negatively correlated with the occurrence of aortic dissection (AD).

Since the medial prefrontal cortex (mPFC) is a core region for the interaction between emotional processing and cognition with a high density of 5-HT1AR and GALR1 and GALR2, we have analyzed the binding characteristics and mRNA levels of 5-HT1AR in the mPFC after GAL(1-15)-FLX administration in the rats. GAL(1-15) increased the Kd and the Bmax of the 5HT1AR agonist binding in the mPFC as well as the mRNA levels of 5-HT1AR in mPFC. Moreover, GAL(1-15) reversed the effects of memory impairment induced by FLX(10 mg/kg) in the Novel Object Recognition task. GALR2 was involved in these effects, since the specific GALR2 antagonist M871 blocked GAL(1-15) mediated actions at behavioral level.
