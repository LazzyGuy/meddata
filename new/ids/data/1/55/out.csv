Dispositional resilience, as described and defined in literature on hardiness, consists of three facets, namely beliefs about having control in everyday living, having a sense of purpose or commitment, and a positive attitude toward challenges. This study explores associations between dispositional resilience (measured with the Dispositional Resilience Scale (DRS-15-R)), symptom severity, and treatment outcome in a sample of 89 patients treated with concentrated exposure therapy (cET), and compares the findings with scores from two reference groups (students and soldiers). The patient group had significantly lower resilience scores than the two reference groups. Weak correlations were observed between dispositional resilience and OCD symptoms. Differences in dispositional resilience were weakly related to remission status at follow-up (odds ratio of 1.11). Furthermore, resilience improved from pre- to post-treatment (Cohen's d of 0.65). Our results imply that patients' initial resilience score does not hinder nor facilitate treatment effects to a great extent in this format of ERP treatment.",Anterior abdominal wall defects managed at a tertiary maternal-fetal medicine service in New Zealand: What counselling advice can we offer parents?,https://www.ncbi.nlm.nih.gov/pubmed/30841012,The Australian & New Zealand journal of obstetrics & gynaecology,2019 03 06,"Anterior abdominal wall defects, including gastroschisis and omphalocoele, are common fetal anomalies.

This underscores the importance of diagnosis and risk stratification for these patients. High definition endoscopy with chromoendoscopy (CE) is better than high definition white-light endoscopy alone for this purpose. Virtual CE can guide biopsies for staging atrophic and metaplastic changes and can target neoplastic lesions. Biopsies should be taken from at least two topographic sites (antrum and corpus) and labelled in two separate vials. For patients with mild to moderate atrophy restricted to the antrum there is no evidence to recommend surveillance. In patients with IM at a single location but with a family history of gastric cancer, incomplete IM, or persistent Helicobacter pylori gastritis, endoscopic surveillance with CE and guided biopsies may be considered in 3 years. Patients with advanced stages of atrophic gastritis should be followed up with a high quality endoscopy every 3 years. In patients with dysplasia, in the absence of an endoscopically defined lesion, immediate high quality endoscopic reassessment with CE is recommended. Patients with an endoscopically visible lesion harboring low or high grade dysplasia or carcinoma should undergo staging and treatment. H. pylori eradication heals nonatrophic chronic gastritis, may lead to regression of atrophic gastritis, and reduces the risk of gastric cancer in patients with these conditions, and it is recommended. H. pylori eradication is also recommended for patients with neoplasia after endoscopic therapy.

It has been reported that overproduction of reactive oxygen species (ROS) and cell apoptosis are associated with the development of FSGS. Epigallocatechin-3-gallate (EGCG) is a bioactive constituent accounting for more than 50% of the total catechins in green tea, which have anti-oxidative and anti-apoptotic effects. Based on this, this study was designed to evaluate the renoprotective effect of EGCG treatment on Adriamycin-induced FSGS. -Methods: In C57BL/6 mice, Adriamycin nephropathy (AN) was induced by Adriamycin (10 mg/kg body weight, diluted in normal saline) via a tail vein on day 0.

We aimed to compare the effects of maternal BM in combination with mechanical ventilation on the white matter (WM) of late preterm sheep. At 0.85 of gestation, pregnant ewes were randomly assigned to receive intra-muscular (i.m.) saline (n = 9) or i.m. BM (n = 13). Lambs were delivered and unventilated controls (UVCSal, n = 4; UVCBM, n = 6) were humanely killed without intervention; ventilated lambs (VentSal, n = 5; VentBM, n = 7) were injuriously ventilated for 15 min, followed by conventional ventilation for 75 min. Cardiovascular and cerebral haemodynamics and oxygenation were measured continuously. The cerebral WM underwent assessment of inflammation and injury, and oxidative stress was measured in the cerebrospinal fluid (CSF). In the periventricular and subcortical WM tracts, the proportion of amoeboid (activated) microglia, the density of astrocytes, and the number of blood vessels with protein extravasation were higher in UVCBM than in UVCSal (p < 0.05 for all). During ventilation, tidal volume, mean arterial pressure, carotid blood flow, and oxygen delivery were higher in -VentBM lambs (p < 0.05 vs. VentSal). In the subcortical WM, microglial infiltration was increased in the VentSal group compared to UVCSal. The proportion of activated microglia and protein extravasation was higher in the VentBM group compared to VentSal within the periventricular and subcortical WM tracts (p < 0.05). CSF oxidative stress was increased in the VentBM group compared to UVCSal, UVCBM, and VentSal groups (p < 0.05).

The C/S-SiCNWs were composed of a crystalline cubic (3C) SiC core wrapped by an amorphous silicon dioxide (SiO x ) shell; however, TEM observations of the NWs showed that hexagonal polytypes (2H, 4H , and 6H) were partially induced in the core by a stacking fault owing to a Shockley partial dislocation. The stress-strain relationship of the C/S-SiCNWs and SiC cores without an SiO x shell was examined using MEMS-based nanotensile tests. The tensile strengths of the C/S-SiCNWs and SiC cores were 7.0 GPa and 22.4 GPa on average, respectively. The lower strength of the C/S-SiCNWs could be attributed to the SiO x shell with the surface roughness as the breaking point. The Young's modulus of the C/S-SiCNWs was 247.2 GPa on average, whereas that of the SiC cores had a large value with scatter data ranging from 450 to 580 GPa. The geometrical model of the SiC core based on the transmission electron microscopy observations rationalized this scatter data by the volume content of the stacking fault in the core. The piezoresistive effects of the C/S-SiCNW and SiC core were also evaluated from the I-V characteristics under uniaxial tensile strain. The gauge factor of -30.7 at 0.008 ε for the C/S-SiCNW was approximately two-times larger than that of -15.8 at 0.01 ε for the SiC core. This could be caused by an increase of the surface state density at the SiO x /SiC interface owing to the positive fixed oxide charge of the SiO x shell.",Strong long-range electron-phonon interaction as possible driving force for charge ordering in cuprates.,https://www.ncbi.nlm.nih.gov/pubmed/30840947,Journal of physics. Condensed matter : an Institute of Physics journal,2019 04 10,"A model resulting in charge ordering (CO) similar to that observed in cuprate superconductors is under study. It includes strong long-range electron-phonon interaction (EPI) and high density of correlated carriers. Coexistence of large bipolarons and delocalized carriers is a feature of such system. We develop generalized variation method to calculate the bipolaron size (CO period) in the ground normal state of such system at various doping. The approach allows the revealing of a possible physical reason of strongly different doping behavior of the CO wave vector in different cuprates. Obtained doping dependences of the CO period and temperature of the CO decay demonstrate quantitative agreement with those observed in cuprates. Predicted in the suggested approach ratio of the CO wave vector to the wave vector of the high-energy anomaly (HEA) in ARPES spectrum is in consent with that in cuprates. Calculated resonant x-rays scattering on the CO emerging in the model is in good agreement with experiments on cuprates including the asymmetry of the CO peaks' cross-section. A gap arises in the spectrum of delocalized carriers near antinodal direction due to their scattering on the periodic potential created by autolocalized carriers, analogously to photon crystal effect.",Evaluation of Ge-doped silica fibre TLDs for in vivo dosimetry during intraoperative radiotherapy.,https://www.ncbi.nlm.nih.gov/pubmed/30840946,Physics in medicine and biology,2019 04 12,"Ge-doped silica fibre (GDSF) thermoluminescence dosimeters (TLD) are non-hygroscopic spatially high-resolution radiation sensors with demonstrated potential for radiotherapy dosimetry applications. The INTRABEAM® system with spherical applicators, one of a number of recent electronic brachytherapy sources designed for intraoperative radiotherapy (IORT), presents a representative challenging dosimetry situation, with a low keV photon beam and a desired rapid dose-rate fall-off close-up to the applicator surface. In this study, using the INTRABEAM® system, investigations were made into the potential application of GDSF TLDs for in vivo IORT dosimetry. The GDSFs were calibrated over the respective dose- and depth-range 1 to 20 Gy and 3 to 45 mm from the x-ray probe. The effect of different sizes of spherical applicator on TL response of the fibres was also investigated. The results show the GDSF TLDs to be applicable for IORT dose assessment, with the important incorporated correction for beam quality effects using different spherical applicator sizes. The total uncertainty in use of this type of GDSF for dosimetry has been found to range between 9.5% to 12.4%. Subsequent in vivo measurement of skin dose for three breast patients undergoing IORT were performed, the measured doses being below the tolerance level for acute radiation toxicity.",A comparative study of information retrieval in grating-based x-ray phase-contrast imaging.,https://www.ncbi.nlm.nih.gov/pubmed/30840945,Physics in medicine and biology,2019 06 12,"The cosine-model analysis (CMA) method and the small angle x-ray scattering (SAXS) method are two major types of information retrieval algorithms, commonly utilized in x-ray phase-contrast imaging with a grating interferometer. However, there are significant differences between the two methods in algorithm implementation, and the existing literature has not completely revealed their intrinsic relationship. In this paper, we theoretically derive and experimentally verify the intrinsic connections between CMA and SAXS, and it is seen that SAXS can be interpreted well by the cosine-model assumption of CMA. To validate our analysis of the scattering distribution when applying the cosine model to the convolution used in SAXS, we applied a deconvolution process into CMA before using the Fourier transform to get the three contrasts. Furthermore, the principal component analysis (PCA) is introduced in this work, and two PCA-based retrieval algorithms are presented in order to simplify the iteration process of deconvolution in SAXS or to obtain absorption and dark-field signals instead of the Fourier transform in CMA. Applying a quantitative structural similarity (SSIM) index and a profile analysis to the results of an ex vivo mammography, it is proved that retrieved images via CMA and SAXS are consistent with each other (SSIM values are 1.0000, 0.9845 and 0.9767 respectively), and that the extra deconvolution process applied into CMA shows a good performance and our analytical analysis of the scattering distribution is valid when applying the cosine model to the convolution used in SAXS. Besides, it is concluded that PCA shows almost the same performance with the Fourier transform (SSIM values are 1.0000 for both absorption and dark-field images), and the simplified SAXS-analogous method works well with higher efficiency in computation and better stability relative to the original SAXS, while maintaining the similar level of image quality (SSIM values are 1.0000, 0.9839 and 0.9781 respectively)."

It encompasses the demands for scalable fabrication as well as for ultra-fast response due to weak coupling to environment. The fabricated devices exhibited initially a weak field-effect response with substantial positive (p) doping which transformed into weak negative (n) doping upon current annealing at the temperature of 4 K. With increased annealing current, n-doping gradually decreased while the Dirac peak position approached zero in gate voltage. An ultra-low residual charge density of 9 × 108 cm-2 and a mobility of 1.9 × 105 cm2 V-1 s-1 were observed. Our samples display clear Fabry-Pérot (FP) conductance oscillation which indicates ballistic electron transport. The spacings of the FP oscillations are found to depend on the charge density in a manner that agrees with theoretical modeling based on Klein tunneling of Dirac particles. The ultra-low residual charge, the FP oscillations with density dependent period, and the high mobility prove the excellent quality of our suspended graphene devices. Owing to its simplicity, scalability and robustness, this fabrication scheme enhances possibilities for production of suspended, high-quality, two-dimensional-material structures for novel electronic applications.",Gliosis of astrocytes cultivated on coral skeleton is regulated by the matrix surface topography.,https://www.ncbi.nlm.nih.gov/pubmed/30840929,"Biomedical materials (Bristol, England)",2019 04 29,"Astrogilosis is the response of astrocytes to brain trauma which manifest opposite roles on brain injury repair. On the one hand, astrocytes undergoing astrogliosis inhibit tissue regeneration by forming scar tissue, but, on the other hand, they enhance damage repair through secretion of neuro-protecting and neurotrophic factors. Therefore, identifying means that regulate astrogliosis can provide a control over progression and repair of brain damage. We have previously shown that the calcium carbonate skeleton of corals upregulates two manifestations of astrogliosis in astrocytes in culture-expression of the Glial Fibrillay Acidic Protein (GFAP), and shape conversion from non-spiky to reactive spiky cell morphology. Here, we investigated if the surface topography of the coralline skeleton plays a role in GFAP expression and the morphogenesis of reactive astrocytes. To address that, we utilized the non-porous exoskeleton of the coral Trachyphyllia geoffroyi, having three topographies of distinct heights on its surface: rough surface (made of <30 μm height bumps), protrusions (50-250 μm) and ridges (>250 μm). We observed that astrocytes reacted similarly to all three structures in terms of adhesion, acquisition of a spiky morphology and organization in networks. By contrast, the extent by which these cells expressed GFAP was structure-dependent. The expression was 2-fold higher on protrusions and ridges than on the rough surface and acquired. Accordingly, the distribution pattern of the GFAP overexpressing astrocytes followed that of the protrusions and ridges. Hence, fabricating coralline scaffolds with designed flatness/protrusions/ridges ratios can serve to control astrogliosis-derived regeneration in TBI wounds, and as a result improve the capacity to repair brain damage.","Nanostructured, ultrathin silver-based transparent electrode with broadband near-infrared plasmonic resonance.",https://www.ncbi.nlm.nih.gov/pubmed/30840928,Nanotechnology,2019 06 07,"A nanostructured transparent electrode with high average visible transmittance of 76%, low sheet resistance of 7.0 Ω/sq and steep transmittance drop in the near-infrared (NIR) range is investigated by simulations and experiments. The electrode is composed of a nanostructured substrate, on which a trilayer, consisting of an ultrathin 14 nm thick silver film embedded between thin films of TiO2 and Al-doped ZnO, is deposited. Directional silver deposition results in the formation of a disk-hole array without additional lift-off or etching steps. While the trilayer approach enables increased visible transmittance, the transmittance in the NIR regime is decreased by a broadband plasmonic dipole excitation in the disk-hole array. Moreover, a rich mode spectrum of weaker multipole surface plasmon excitations is observed in the nanodisk- and nanohole array.

Cellooligomers with a degree of polymerization of 6 or 15 (βGlc6 or βGlc15, respectively), which were labeled at each reducing end group with thiosemicarbazide (TSC) and dissolved in the aqueous NMMO phase, were successfully conjugated to the surfaces of GNPs in situ during spontaneous NMMO-mediated gold reduction. As-synthesized βGlc6-GNPs and βGlc15-GNPs had average diameters of 11.3 ± 2.1 and 10.5 ± 0.7 nm, respectively, while their surface sugar densities were 0.21 and 0.51 chains nm-2, respectively. Concanavalin A (ConA), a lectin that recognizes non-reducing end groups of glucose residues, aggregated with βGlc15-GNPs with higher sensitivity than it did with βGlc6-GNPs, possibly as a result of the sugar density on the GNP surfaces. The aggregates were rapidly re-suspended by adding methyl-β-d-glucopyranoside as a binding inhibitor. Other lectins and proteins showed no interaction with βGlc-GNPs. Therefore, clustering of glucose non-reducing ends on the GNP surfaces via strong intermolecular association of cellooligomers, possibly led to high affinity for ConA. This facile synthesis route to structural carbohydrate-decorated GNPs has potential applications in carbohydrate-nanometal conjugate nano-biosensor development.",Hederagenin amide derivatives as potential antiproliferative agents.,https://www.ncbi.nlm.nih.gov/pubmed/30840925,European journal of medicinal chemistry,2019 04 22,"In this study, a series of C-28 amides derivatives of hederagenin with or without the presence of an acetyl group at positions 3 and 23 in ring A, were synthetized aiming to develop potent cytotoxic agents.

The majority of the amide derivatives were cytotoxic for a variety of human tumor cell lines. In general, the hydroxylated derivatives (1a-1d; EC50 in the range 1.2-22.5 μM) were less active than the acetylated derivatives (2a-2n; EC50 in the range 0.4-9.0 μM). Hydroxylated derivative bearing pyrrolidinyl substituent 1c, was the most active for HT29 human line cells (EC50 = 1.2 μM), however their acetylated derivative 2c was the most potent and selective against A2780, FaDu, SW1736 cells, showing EC50 values between 0.4 and 1.7 μM and SI between 5.6 and 24. Staining experiments combined with fluorescence microscopy indicate that the cell membrane became permeable, and finally a process of secondary necrosis was observed. In addition, the docking results showed that acetylated compounds display more affinity to HER2 than to USP7, indicating that HER2 is a most probable receptor, both proteins found in tumor cell line A2780."

Here, we apply a new modality to a previously established, functionally stable, multi-well bioengineered microliver-fabricated from primary human hepatocytes and supportive stromal cells-in order to advance both small molecule and nucleic acid therapeutic pipelines. Specifically, we achieve robust and durable gene silencing in vitro to tune the human metabolism of small molecules, and demonstrate its capacity to query the potential efficacy and/or toxicity of candidate therapeutics. Additionally, we apply this engineered platform to test siRNAs designed to target hepatocytes and impact human liver genetic and infectious diseases.","Caloric Restriction Mimetics against Age-Associated Disease: Targets, Mechanisms, and Therapeutic Potential.",https://www.ncbi.nlm.nih.gov/pubmed/30840912,Cell metabolism,2019 03 06,"The increase in life expectancy has boosted the incidence of age-related pathologies beyond social and economic sustainability. Consequently, there is an urgent need for interventions that revert or at least prevent the pathogenic age-associated deterioration. The permanent or periodic reduction of calorie intake without malnutrition (caloric restriction and fasting) is the only strategy that reliably extends healthspan in mammals including non-human primates. However, the strict and life-long compliance with these regimens is difficult, which has promoted the emergence of caloric restriction mimetics (CRMs). We define CRMs as compounds that ignite the protective pathways of caloric restriction by promoting autophagy, a cytoplasmic recycling mechanism, via a reduction in protein acetylation. Here, we describe the current knowledge on molecular, cellular, and organismal effects of known and putative CRMs in mice and humans. We anticipate that CRMs will become part of the pharmacological armamentarium against aging and age-related cardiovascular, neurodegenerative, and malignant diseases.",Navigating Two Roads to Glucose Normalization in Diabetes: Automated Insulin Delivery Devices and Cell Therapy.,https://www.ncbi.nlm.nih.gov/pubmed/30840911,Cell metabolism,2019 03 06,"Incredible strides have been made since the discovery of insulin almost 100 years ago.

Replacement of insulin-producing cells via transplantation shows significant promise, but is limited in application due to supply constraints (cadaver-based) and the need for chronic immunosuppression. Over the past decade, significant progress has been made to address these barriers to widespread implementation of a cell therapy.

In particular, little is known about whether patterns of functional connectivity (FC) differ down the anterior-posterior axis of each subfield. Here, using high resolution structural MRI we delineated the hippocampal subfields in healthy young adults. This included the CA fields, separating DG/CA4 from CA3, separating the pre/parasubiculum from the subiculum, and also segmenting the uncus. We then used high resolution resting state functional MRI to interrogate FC. We first analysed the FC of each hippocampal subfield in its entirety, in terms of FC with other subfields and with the neighbouring regions, namely entorhinal, perirhinal, posterior parahippocampal and retrosplenial cortices. Next, we analysed FC for different portions of each hippocampal subfield along its anterior-posterior axis, in terms of FC between different parts of a subfield, FC with other subfield portions, and FC of each subfield portion with the neighbouring cortical regions of interest. We found that intrinsic functional connectivity between the subfields aligned generally with the tri-synaptic circuit but also extended beyond it. Our findings also revealed that patterns of functional connectivity between the subfields and neighbouring cortical areas differed markedly along the anterior-posterior axis of each hippocampal subfield. Overall, these results contribute to ongoing efforts to characterise human hippocampal subfield connectivity, with implications for understanding hippocampal function.",Big GABA II: Water-referenced edited MR spectroscopy at 25 research sites.,https://www.ncbi.nlm.nih.gov/pubmed/30840905,NeuroImage,2019 06 15,"Accurate and reliable quantification of brain metabolites measured in vivo using 1H magnetic resonance spectroscopy (MRS) is a topic of continued interest. Aside from differences in the basic approach to quantification, the quantification of metabolite data acquired at different sites and on different platforms poses an additional methodological challenge. In this study, spectrally edited γ-aminobutyric acid (GABA) MRS data were analyzed and GABA levels were quantified relative to an internal tissue water reference. Data from 284 volunteers scanned across 25 research sites were collected using GABA+ (GABA + co-edited macromolecules (MM)) and MM-suppressed GABA editing. The unsuppressed water signal from the volume of interest was acquired for concentration referencing. Whole-brain T1-weighted structural images were acquired and segmented to determine gray matter, white matter and cerebrospinal fluid voxel tissue fractions. Water-referenced GABA measurements were fully corrected for tissue-dependent signal relaxation and water visibility effects. The cohort-wide coefficient of variation was 17% for the GABA + data and 29% for the MM-suppressed GABA data. The mean within-site coefficient of variation was 10% for the GABA + data and 19% for the MM-suppressed GABA data. Vendor differences contributed 53% to the total variance in the GABA + data, while the remaining variance was attributed to site- (11%) and participant-level (36%) effects. For the MM-suppressed data, 54% of the variance was attributed to site differences, while the remaining 46% was attributed to participant differences. Results from an exploratory analysis suggested that the vendor differences were related to the unsuppressed water signal acquisition. Discounting the observed vendor-specific effects, water-referenced GABA measurements exhibit similar levels of variance to creatine-referenced GABA measurements. It is concluded that quantification using internal tissue water referencing is a viable and reliable method for the quantification of in vivo GABA levels.",Decoding the status of working memory representations in preparation of visual selection.,https://www.ncbi.nlm.nih.gov/pubmed/30840904,NeuroImage,2019 06 15,"Daily life is filled with sequences of multiple tasks, each with their own relevant perceptual input. Working memory needs to dissociate representations that drive attention towards currently relevant information from prospective representations that are needed for future tasks, but that until then should be prevented from guiding attention. Yet, little is known about how the brain initiates and controls such sequential prioritization of selection. In the current study we recorded EEG while subjects remembered a color as the target template for one of two sequential search tasks, thus making it either currently relevant (when it was the target for the first search) or prospectively relevant (when it was the target for the second search) prior to the task sequence. Using time-frequency specific linear classifiers, we were able to predict the priority status (current versus prospective) of the memory representation from multivariate patterns of delta (2-4 Hz) and non-lateralized alpha power (8-14 Hz) during both delay periods. The delta band was only transiently involved when initializing the priority status at the start of the first delay, or when switching priority during the second delay, which we interpret as reflecting the momentary top-down control over prioritization. In contrast, alpha power decoding was based on a more stable pattern of activity that generalized across time both within and between delay periods, which we interpret as reflecting a difference in the prioritized memory representations themselves. Taken together, we reveal the involvement of a complex, distributed and dynamic spatiotemporal landscape of frequency-specific oscillatory activity in controlling prioritization of information within working memory."

We tested the effect of 4-day fasting-mimicking diet (FMD) cycles on a chronic dextran sodium sulfate (DSS)-induced murine model resulting in symptoms and pathology associated with IBD. These FMD cycles reduced intestinal inflammation, increased stem cell number, stimulated protective gut microbiota, and reversed intestinal pathology caused by DSS, whereas water-only fasting increased regenerative and reduced inflammatory markers without reversing pathology. Transplants of Lactobacillus or fecal microbiota from DSS- and FMD-treated mice reversed DSS-induced colon shortening, reduced inflammation, and increased colonic stem cells. In a clinical trial, three FMD cycles reduced markers associated with systemic inflammation. The effect of FMD cycles on microbiota composition, immune cell profile, intestinal stem cell levels and the reversal of pathology associated with IBD in mice, and the anti-inflammatory effects demonstrated in a clinical trial show promise for FMD cycles to ameliorate IBD-associated inflammation in humans.",IPMK Mediates Activation of ULK Signaling and Transcriptional Regulation of Autophagy Linked to Liver Inflammation and Regeneration.,https://www.ncbi.nlm.nih.gov/pubmed/30840891,Cell reports,2019 05 03,"Autophagy plays a broad role in health and disease. Here, we show that inositol polyphosphate multikinase (IPMK) is a prominent physiological determinant of autophagy and is critical for liver inflammation and regeneration. Deletion of IPMK diminishes autophagy in cell lines and mouse liver. Regulation of autophagy by IPMK does not require catalytic activity. Two signaling axes, IPMK-AMPK-Sirt-1 and IPMK-AMPK-ULK1, appear to mediate the influence of IPMK on autophagy. IPMK enhances autophagy-related transcription by stimulating AMPK-dependent Sirt-1 activation, which mediates the deacetylation of histone 4 lysine 16. Furthermore, direct binding of IPMK to ULK and AMPK forms a ternary complex that facilitates AMPK-dependent ULK phosphorylation. Deletion of IPMK in cell lines and intact mice virtually abolishes lipophagy, promotes liver damage as well as inflammation, and impairs hepatocyte regeneration. Thus, targeting IPMK may afford therapeutic benefits in disabilities that depend on autophagy and lipophagy-specifically, in liver inflammation and regeneration.",Fcμ receptor as a Costimulatory Molecule for T Cells.,https://www.ncbi.nlm.nih.gov/pubmed/30840890,Cell reports,2019 03 06,"Fc receptor for IgM (FcμR)-deficient mice display dysregulated function of neutrophils, dendritic cells, and B cells. The relevance of FcμR to human T cells is still unknown. We show that FcμR is mostly stored inside the cell and that surface expression is tightly regulated. Decreased surface expression on T cells from elderly individuals is associated with alterations in the methylation pattern of the FCMR gene. Binding and internalization of IgM stimulate transport of FcμR to the cell surface to ensure sustained IgM uptake. Concurrently, IgM accumulates within the cell, and the surface expression of other receptors increases, among them the T cell receptor (TCR) and costimulatory molecules. This leads to enhanced TCR signaling, proliferation, and cytokine release, in response to low, but not high, doses of antigen. Our findings indicate that FcμR is an important regulator of T cell function and reveal an additional mode of interaction between B and T cells.",MicroRNA-Mediated Suppression of the TGF-β Pathway Confers Transmissible and Reversible CDK4/6 Inhibitor Resistance.,https://www.ncbi.nlm.nih.gov/pubmed/30840889,Cell reports,2019 04 07,"CDK4/6 inhibition is now part of the standard armamentarium for patients with estrogen receptor-positive (ER+) breast cancer, so that defining mechanisms of resistance is a pressing issue. Here, we identify increased CDK6 expression as a key determinant of acquired resistance after palbociclib treatment in ER+ breast cancer cells. CDK6 expression is critical for cellular survival during palbociclib exposure. The increased CDK6 expression observed in resistant cells is dependent on TGF-β pathway suppression via miR-432-5p expression. Exosomal miR-432-5p expression mediates the transfer of the resistance phenotype between neighboring cell populations. Levels of miR-432-5p are higher in primary breast cancers demonstrating CDK4/6 resistance compared to those that are sensitive. These data are further confirmed in pre-treatment and post-progression biopsies from a parotid cancer patient who had responded to ribociclib, demonstrating the clinical relevance of this mechanism.

Here, we elucidate mechanisms of tumor evolution and heterogeneity in metastatic thoracic tumors (lung adenocarcinoma and thymic carcinoma) using whole-exome and transcriptome sequencing, SNP array for copy-number alterations (CNAs), and mass-spectrometry-based quantitative proteomics of metastases obtained by rapid autopsy. APOBEC mutagenesis, promoted by increased expression of APOBEC3 region transcripts and associated with a high-risk APOBEC3 germline variant, correlated with mutational tumor heterogeneity. TP53 mutation status was associated with APOBEC hypermutator status. Interferon pathways were enriched in tumors with high APOBEC mutagenesis and IFN-γ-induced expression of APOBEC3B in lung adenocarcinoma cells, suggesting that the immune microenvironment may promote mutational heterogeneity. CNAs occurring late in tumor evolution correlated with downstream transcriptomic and proteomic heterogeneity, although global proteomic heterogeneity was significantly greater than transcriptomic and CNA heterogeneity.

We found that hyperactivation of YAP1 in mouse cervical epithelium was sufficient to induce invasive cervical cancer. Cervical epithelial cell-specific HPV16 E6/E7 and YAP1 double-knockin mouse model demonstrated that high-risk HPV synergized with hyperactivated YAP1 to promote the initiation and progression of cervical cancer. Our mechanistic studies indicated that hyperactivation of YAP1 in cervical epithelial cells facilitated HPV infection by increasing the putative HPV receptor molecules and disrupting host cell innate immunity.

However, cancer secretome studies are often limited to one tissue or cancer type or focus on biomarker prediction without exploring the associated functions. We therefore conducted a pan-cancer analysis of secretome gene expression changes to identify candidate diagnostic biomarkers and to investigate the underlying biological function of these changes. Using transcriptomic data spanning 32 cancer types and 30 healthy tissues, we quantified the relative diagnostic potential of secretome proteins for each cancer. Furthermore, we offer a potential mechanism by which cancer cells relieve secretory pathway stress by decreasing the expression of tissue-specific genes, thereby facilitating the secretion of proteins promoting invasion and proliferation. These results provide a more systematic understanding of the cancer secretome, facilitating its use in diagnostics and its targeting for therapeutic development.",Human Pluripotent Stem Cell-Derived Tumor Model Uncovers the Embryonic Stem Cell Signature as a Key Driver in Atypical Teratoid/Rhabdoid Tumor.,https://www.ncbi.nlm.nih.gov/pubmed/30840885,Cell reports,2019 03 06,"Atypical teratoid/rhabdoid tumor (AT/RT), which harbors SMARCB1 mutation and exhibits a characteristic histology of rhabdoid cells, has a poor prognosis because of the lack of effective treatments.

SMARCB1-deficient hPSC-derived neural progenitor-like cells (NPLCs) efficiently give rise to brain tumors when transplanted into the mouse brain. Notably, activation of an embryonic stem cell (ESC)-like signature confers a rhabdoid histology in SMARCB1-deficient NPLC-derived tumors and causes a poor prognosis. Consistently, we find the activation of the ESC-like gene expression signature and an ESC-like DNA methylation landscape in clinical specimens of AT/RT. Finally, we identify candidate genes that maintain the activation of the ESC-like signature and the growth of AT/RT cells. Collectively, SMARCB1-deficient hPSCs offer the human models for AT/RT, which uncover the role of the activated ESC-like signature in the poor prognosis and unique histology of AT/RT.",Single-Cell RNA-Seq Reveals Cellular Heterogeneity of Pluripotency Transition and X Chromosome Dynamics during Early Mouse Development.,https://www.ncbi.nlm.nih.gov/pubmed/30840884,Cell reports,2019 03 06,"Following implantation, the epiblast (EPI) cells transit from the naive to primed pluripotency, accompanied by dynamic changes in X chromosome activity in females.

The transition of three EPI states was driven by inductive signaling activity emanating from the visceral endoderm (VE). In the EPI of female embryos, X chromosome reactivation (XCR) was initiated prior to the completion of imprinted X chromosome inactivation (XCI), and the ensuing random XCI was highly asynchronous. Moreover, imprinted paternal XCI proceeded faster in the VE than the extraembryonic ectoderm. Our study has provided a detailed molecular roadmap of the emergent lineage commitment before gastrulation and characterized X chromosome dynamics during early mouse development.",Ultra-High-Frequency Reprogramming of Individual Long-Term Hematopoietic Stem Cells Yields Low Somatic Variant Induced Pluripotent Stem Cells.,https://www.ncbi.nlm.nih.gov/pubmed/30840883,Cell reports,2019 04 18,"Efficiency of reprogramming of human cells into induced pluripotent stem cells (iPSCs) has remained low. We report that individual adult human CD49f+ long-term hematopoietic stem cells (LT-HSCs) can be reprogrammed into iPSCs at close to 50% efficiency using Sendai virus transduction. This exquisite sensitivity to reprogramming is specific to LT-HSCs, since it progressively decreases in committed progenitors. LT-HSC reprogramming can follow multiple paths and is most efficient when transduction is performed after the cells have exited G0. Sequencing of 75 paired skin fibroblasts/LT-HSC samples collected from nine individuals revealed that LT-HSCs contain a lower load of somatic single-nucleotide variants (SNVs) and indels than skin fibroblasts and accumulate about 12 SNVs/year. Mutation analysis revealed that LT-HSCs and fibroblasts have very different somatic mutation signatures and that somatic mutations in iPSCs generally exist prior to reprogramming. LT-HSCs may become the preferred cell source for the production of clinical-grade iPSCs."

However, few researches have focused on the tuber polysaccharides. In the present study, a purified polysaccharide (ATP-1) was isolated with the average molecular weights of 12.16 kDa. ATP-1 significantly suppressed the release of nitric oxide (NO) and inflammatory cytokines from LPS-induced RAW 264.7 cells, as well as oxidative stress and mitochondrial dysfunction. Meanwhile, ATP-1 reduced oxidative damage via the NF-κB, MAPKs and Nrf2-Keap1 signaling pathways in RAW264.7 macrophages. Furthermore, autophagy was activated by HMGB1-Beclin1, Sirt1-FoxO1 and Akt-mTOR signaling pathways, leading to a relief of oxidative stress, mitochondrial dysfunction, inflammation and an expression enhancement of autophagy-related proteins, such as LC3, Beclin1, Atg4, Atg5, and Atg7. In summary, our results suggested that ATP-1 might help to activate the anti-inflammation system，resulting in prevention of LPS-induced damage in RAW264.7 cells.",Antimicrobial properties of chitosan and whey protein films applied on fresh cut turkey pieces.,https://www.ncbi.nlm.nih.gov/pubmed/30840870,International journal of biological macromolecules,2019 04 17,"The aim of this study was to evaluate the antimicrobial activity of edible films made from a mixture of whey proteins and chitosan, supplemented with cranberry or quince juice, and then applied on fresh cut turkey pieces.

The extracted chitins were characterized by FT-IR, TGA, XRD, SEM and 1H NMR. The yield of chitin, with moderate molecular weights, can be as high as 13.4% (mass of extracted chitin/mass of shrimp shells) when the extraction was operated at 110 °C for 24 h. The extracted chitin can be further converted into chitosan and the product has 93% degree of deacetylation. The experimental results reveal that the ILs play a remarkable role in the extraction of chitin from shrimp shells with high selectivity. These ammonium-based ILs can be a promising green solvent to extract chitin from wasted shrimp shells and then converted into chitosan.","Polyamine-co-2, 6-diaminopyridine covalently bonded on chitosan for the adsorptive removal of Hg(II) ions from aqueous solution.",https://www.ncbi.nlm.nih.gov/pubmed/30840868,International journal of biological macromolecules,2019 04 17,"In the present study, 2, 6-diaminopyridine (PD) and polyamine compounds (ethylenediamine (EDA), triethylenetetramine (TETA), and tetraethylenepentamine (TEPA)) were used to modify chitosan (CS). The obtained derivatives (PD-CS, PD-EDA-CS, PD-TETA-CS, and PD-TEPA-CS) were identified and employed as adsorbents in batch experiments for the removal of Hg(II) from aqueous solutions. The results confirmed that successful modification improves the Hg(II) adsorption significantly compared to pristine CS. The adsorbed amounts of Hg(II) increased gradually and reached maxima at pH values above 4.0 for all derivatives. The Hg(II) adsorption equilibrium state was achieved within 12 h, with the process driven by a pseudo-second-order kinetic model. The Langmuir model effectively interpreted the Hg(II) adsorption isotherms; the maximum adsorption capacities for Hg(II) ions at 295 K were 172.7, 303.6, 276.0, and 230.6 mg/g for PD-CS, PD-EDA-CS, PD-TETA-CS, and PD-TEPA-CS, respectively. High temperature and low ionic strength favored Hg(II) adsorption. The Hg(II)-loaded CS derivative was easily regenerated and showed acceptable reusability. The further FT-IR and XPS analyses indicate that the Hg(II) adsorption is governed by a process combining electrostatic attraction and a coordination reaction. The CS derivatives produced from polyamine-co-2, 6-diaminopyridine covalently bonded onto CS are promising adsorbents for the adsorptive removal of Hg(II) from an aqueous solution.",Preparation of crosslinked active bilayer film based on chitosan and alginate for regulating ascorbate-glutathione cycle of postharvest cherry tomato (Lycopersicon esculentum).,https://www.ncbi.nlm.nih.gov/pubmed/30840867,International journal of biological macromolecules,2019 04 17,"In the present study, a bilayer film composed of chitosan and alginate was produced by layer-by-layer casting and crosslinking by oxidized ferulic acid. The effects of different film components on mechanical, permeable and optical properties of the film were systematically investigated and the optimum concentrations were determined. The results of scanning electron microscopy and thermogravimetric analysis showed that the crosslinked bilayer film had a smoother and more uniform appearance than the uncrosslinked bilayer film, while the thermal stability was not significantly different. In addition, the infrared measurements confirmed the existence of crosslinking. Subsequently, citric acid was added as an active compound to the bilayer film, which endows the film with antioxidant capacity. Its optimum concentration was also determined by measuring the mechanical, permeable and optical properties of the film. Finally, the active bilayer film was applied to preserve the postharvest cherry tomatoes.

Then these hydrogels were used as carrier for bovine serum albumin (BSA), which served as the model drug. The nanowhiskers worked effectively to raise the mechanical property of the PVA/ChWs hydrogels. This property increased significantly from 1.55 to 26.59 MPa with the increase of the ratio of ChWs to PVA from 0% to 40%. Additionally, the morphological properties of the gel matrix were comprehensively investigated.

There are few anthelmintic drugs available against them. The development of new drugs is urgently needed and this process can be accelerated through the development of rodent models for in vivo testing. Among the few paramphistomes that develop in rodents is the caecal fluke Zygocotyle lunata, a species with which several biological studies have been performed over several decades. Nevertheless, its use as a model for evaluation of anthelmintic drugs had not yet been evaluated. In the present study, we evaluated the efficacy of praziquantel (PZQ 300 mg/kg 5x), albendazole (ABZ 200 mg/kg 5x) and closantel (CLO 50 mg/kg single dose, 50 mg/kg 3x and 25 mg/kg 3x) for treatment of mice experimentally infected with Z. lunata. The animals were infected with 20 metacercariae of the parasite and were treated 30 days post-infection. Untreated groups were maintained as controls. Seven days after the treatments, the animals were euthanized for recovery and counting of parasites. We found that PZQ and ABZ, at the dosages and therapeutic schedule employed here, did not cause significant alterations in worm burden [worm counts 16.0 ± 2.8 (13-19), 17.6 ± 2.1 (14-19) and 16.2 ± 1.9 (13-18) (p = 0.51) in PZQ, ALB and control, respectively]. CLO 50 mg/kg in a single dose caused significant reduction in the number of parasites [treated: 1.8 ± 0.9 (1-3); control: 15.6 ± 2.5 (12-19)], although it did not result in complete elimination of the parasites in any animal. Despite the fact that three doses of CLO 50 mg/kg or CLO 25 mg/kg caused complete elimination of the parasites in most surviving animals, there was significant host mortality. In general, results here obtained are concordant with those of studies performed on ruminant paramphistomes. Given that Z. lunata can be maintained in laboratory rodents, it is a suitable model for screening anthelmintic drugs against paramphistomes.",Short- and long-term effects of orally administered azithromycin on Trypanosoma brucei brucei-infected mice.,https://www.ncbi.nlm.nih.gov/pubmed/30840850,Experimental parasitology,2019 04 22,"Human African trypanosomosis (HAT) and animal African trypanosomosis (AAT) are diseases of economic importance in humans and animals that affect more than 36 African countries. The currently available trypanocidal drugs are associated with side effects, and the parasites are continually developing resistance. Thus, effective and safe drugs are needed for the treatment of HAT and AAT. This study aimed to evaluate the effects of azithromycin (AZM) on Trypanosoma brucei brucei-infected mice. Mice were randomly divided into 7 groups consisting of a vehicle control group, 5 test groups and a diminazene aceturate (DA)-treated group. Mice were treated orally for 7 and 28 days, as short-term and long-term treatments, respectively. Short-term AZM treatment cured 23% (16 of 70) of the overall treated mice whereas long-term treatment resulted in the survival of 70% of the mice in the groups that received AZM at doses of 300 and 400 mg/kg. Trypanosomes treated in vitro with 25 μg/mL of AZM were subjected to transmission electron microscopy, which revealed the presence of increased numbers of glycosomes and acidocalcisomes in comparison to the vehicle group. The current study showed the trypanocidal effect of AZM on T. b. brucei in vivo. The demonstrated efficacy increased with an increase in treatment period and an increased concentration of AZM.",Age and sex differences in the innate defensive behaviors of C57BL/6 mice exhibited in a fear conditioning paradigm and upon exposure to a predatory odor.,https://www.ncbi.nlm.nih.gov/pubmed/30840847,Physiology & behavior,2019 04 20,"Defensive responses of mice include an array of specific behaviors that involve adaptive components based on the assessment of the threat of confrontation. The freezing response is represented by a motionless moment without any specific posture or behavioral sequence, and it is widely used in the fear conditioning paradigms and other relevant defensive situations. However, freezing measurements include fragmental components of several defensive behaviors that are exhibited during the session, such as behavioral inhibition, crouching, and a moment of risk assessment behavior. From an ethological view, behavioral analyses of C57BL/6 mice of both sexes and three different ages (postnatal days (P) 25, 35, and 65) revealed a rich variety of defensive behaviors during a fear conditioning session and in response to predatory odor exposure as a nonconditioned behavior. P-25 and 35 mice exhibited more behavioral inhibition than P-65 adult mice, and P-65 mice exhibited a crouching posture more often than younger mice. This age difference was more pronounced in males. The stretch-attend posture (SAP) increased with age, except in P-25 males, which exhibited robust SAP in response to a conditioned cue; this response indicates that P-25 males are defensive in a situation-nonmatching manner. Situation-dependent defense strategies were revealed in P-35 and 65 mice: Fear conditioning paradigm induced more robust defensive responses than predatory odor exposure, to which mice primarily exhibited SAP. A sex-based difference was revealed in adult mice. Males tended to show more passive defensive responses, such as crouching and withdrawal, and females exhibited more active responses, such as SAP. These age- and sex-based differences may stem from the ethological demands and illustrate adolescent ontogenetic processes of defense behavior.",Visualizing Protein Folding and Unfolding.,https://www.ncbi.nlm.nih.gov/pubmed/30840846,Journal of molecular biology,2019 04 08,"Protein folding/unfolding is a complicated process that defies high-resolution characterization by experimental methods.

However, the level of detail necessary to map the process at high spatial-temporal resolution provides an overwhelming amount of data. As more and better tools are developed for analysis of these large data sets and validation of the simulations, one is still left with the problem of visualizing the results in ways that provide insight into the folding/unfolding process. While viewing and interrogating static crystal structures has become commonplace, more and different approaches are required for dynamic, interconverting, unfolding, and refolding proteins. Here we review a variety of approaches, ranging from straightforward to complex and unintuitive for multiscale analysis and visualization of protein folding and unfolding.",Characterization and Pathogenicity of Botryosphaeriaceae Species Obtained from Avocado Trees with Branch Canker and Dieback and from Avocado Fruit with Stem End Rot in Chile.,https://www.ncbi.nlm.nih.gov/pubmed/30840843,Plant disease,2019 05 08,"Several species of the Botryosphaeriaceae family have been associated with branch canker, dieback, and stem end rot in avocado (Persea americana Mill.). In Chile, the incidence of diseases affecting the avocado tree increased from 2011 to 2016, which coincided with a severe drought that affected avocado production. Moreover, distant countries importing avocados from Chile also reported an increase of stem end rot of ripe avocados. Therefore, the aims of this study were to identify the pathogen species associated with branch canker, dieback, and stem end rot of avocado in Chile and to study their pathogenicity. This study was conducted between 2015 and 2016 in 'Hass' avocado orchards located in the main avocado-producing regions in Chile. A diverse collection of fungal species was recovered from both necrotic woody tissue and necrotic tissue on harvested ripe fruit. On the basis of morphology and phylogenetic analyses of the internal transcribed spacer region (ITS1-5.8S-ITS2) and the translation elongation factor 1-α (TEF1-α) gene, eight species in the Botryosphaeriaceae family were identified: Diplodia mutila, D. pseudoseriata, D. seriata, Dothiorella iberica, Lasiodiplodia theobromae, Neofusicoccum australe, N. nonquaesitum, and N. parvum. For each of these species, pathogenicity studies were conducted on 1-year-old healthy Hass avocado plants. All isolates produced brown gum exudate and caused necrosis in the vascular system 3 weeks after inoculation. N. nonquaesitum, N. parvum, and D. pseudoseriata were the most virulent species. Necrotic lesions and cavities with white mycelia near the peduncle union were observed on Hass avocado fruit inoculated postharvest. L. theobromae, N. australe, and N. parvum were significantly more virulent than the other tested species in the Botryosphaeriaceae family. This study identified and characterized the pathogenicity of Botryosphaeriaceae species in Chile, which will prove useful to future research on these pathogens directed at establishing effective control strategies in avocado.","Amylose-Free (""waxy"") Wheat Colonization by Fusarium spp. and Response to Fusarium Head Blight.",https://www.ncbi.nlm.nih.gov/pubmed/30840842,Plant disease,2019 05 08,"Hexaploid waxy wheat (Triticum aestivum L.) has null mutations in Wx genes and grain lacking amylose with increased digestibility and usability for specialty foods. The waxy cultivar Mattern is susceptible to Fusarium head blight (FHB) caused by Fusarium graminearum species complex, which produces the mycotoxin deoxynivalenol (DON). In experiment 1, conducted during low natural FHB, grain from waxy breeding lines, Mattern, and wild-type breeding lines and cultivars were assessed for Fusarium infection and DON concentration. Nine Fusarium species and species complexes were detected from internally infected (disinfested) grain; F. graminearum infections were not different between waxy and wild-type. Surface- and internally infected grain (nondisinfested) had greater numbers of Fusarium isolates across waxy versus wild-type, but F. graminearum-like infections were similar; however, DON levels were higher in waxy. In experiment 2, conducted during a timely epidemic, disease severity, Fusarium-damaged kernels (FDK), and DON were assessed for waxy breeding lines, Mattern, and wild-type cultivars. Disease severity and FDK were not significantly different from wild-type, but DON was higher in waxy than wild-type lines. Across both experiments, waxy breeding lines, Plant Introductions 677876 and 677877, responded similarly to FHB as moderately resistant wild-type cultivar Overland, showing promise for breeding advanced waxy cultivars with reduced FHB susceptibility.",Developmental Dynamics of Meloidogyne hapla in Washington Wine Grapes.,https://www.ncbi.nlm.nih.gov/pubmed/30840841,Plant disease,2019 05 08,"Meloidogyne hapla is the most prevalent plant-parasitic nematode in Washington state wine grape vineyards. Understanding the developmental dynamics of M. hapla can improve the timing of diagnostic sampling and nematicide application. Three Vitis vinifera vineyards in Washington were sampled March 2015 to March 2017 to determine the developmental dynamics of M. hapla by measuring second-stage juveniles (J2) in soil, eggs and adult females in roots, and fine root tips. A model of M. hapla J2 development based on soil growing degree days using a base temperature (Tb) of 0°C (GDDsoil) and a start date of 1 March was developed. This model was validated at two additional vineyards in Washington and was robust with R2 values > 0.74. M. hapla has one generation per year and overwinters primarily as the J2 infective stage. Juvenile populations declined after 1 March, reaching their lowest density in early July and reaching a maximum density over the winter. M. hapla egg and root tip densities reached a maximum in early August. The number of females per root tip did not vary throughout the year. A single generation with defined peaks in J2 population densities will allow for specific timing of nematicide interventions.","Ocular dysfunctions and toxicities induced by antiepileptic medications: Types, pathogenic mechanisms, and treatment strategies.",https://www.ncbi.nlm.nih.gov/pubmed/30840840,Expert review of clinical pharmacology,2019 04 05,"Ocular dysfunctions and toxicities induced by antiepileptic drugs (AEDs) are rarely reviewed and not frequently received attention by treating physicians compared to other adverse effects (e.g. endocrinologic, cognitive and metabolic). However, some are frequent and progressive even in therapeutic concentrations or result in permanent blindness. Although some adverse effects are non-specific, others are related to the specific pharmacodynamics of the drug. Areas covered: This review was written after detailed search in PubMed, EMBASE, ISI web, SciELO, Scopus, and Cochrane Central Register databases (from 1970 to 2019). It summarized the reported ophthalmologic adverse effects of the currently available AEDs; their risks and possible pathogenic mechanisms. They include ocular motility dysfunctions, retinopathy, maculopathy, glaucoma, myopia, optic neuropathy, and impaired retinal vascular autoregulation. In general, ophthalmo-neuro- or retino-toxic adverse effects of AEDs are classified as type A (dose-dependent), type B (host-dependent or idiosyncratic) or type C which is due to the cumulative effect from long-term use. Expert opinion: Ocular adverse effects of AEDs are rarely reviewed although some are frequent or may result in permanent blindness. Increasing knowledge of their incidence and improving understanding of their risks and pathogenic mechanisms are crucial for monitoring, prevention, and management of patients' at risk.",Reduced asymmetric dimethylarginine accumulation through inhibition of the type I protein arginine methyltransferases promotes renal fibrosis in obstructed kidneys.,https://www.ncbi.nlm.nih.gov/pubmed/30840839,FASEB journal : official publication of the Federation of American Societies for Experimental Biology,2019 05 30,"The role of asymmetric dimethylarginine (ADMA) in chronic kidney disease (CKD) is unclear. Through inhibition of type I protein arginine methyltransferases (PRMTs), a novel strategy, we aimed to determine the effect of ADMA on renal fibrosis and explore its underlying working mechanisms. After sham or unilateral ureter ligation (UUO) operation, 20-25 g male c57 mice were treated with vehicle or PT1001B, an inhibitor of type I PRMTs, for 13 d. Moreover, human kidney 2 (HK2) and normal rat kidney 49F (NRK-49F) cells were treated with various concentrations of PT1001B or ADMA in the presence of 2.5 ng/ml TGF-β. We found that treatment with PT1001B increased the deposition of extracellular matrix proteins, the expression of α smooth muscle actin, and connective tissue growth factor in UUO-induced fibrotic kidneys, which is correlated with reduced expression of PRMT1, reduced the production of ADMA, and increased expression of uromodulin. In TGF-β-stimulated HK2 and NRK-49F cells, PT1001B dose-dependently inhibited ADMA production, increased NO concentrations, and enhanced the expression of profibrotic proteins. Exogenous addition of ADMA inhibited the expression of profibrotic proteins dose-dependently and attenuated the profibrotic effect of PT1001B. Moreover, ADMA reduced the NO concentration in PT1001B-treated HK2 cells. Finally, we conclude that ADMA has an antifibrotic effect in obstructed kidneys, and future application of type I PRMT inhibitor should be done cautiously for patients with CKD.-Wu, M., Lin, P., Li, L., Chen, D., Yang, X., Xu, L., Zhou, B., Wang, C., Zhang, Y., Luo, C., Ye, C.

Our hypothesis was that failure of resolution programs may lead to unremitting inflammation in obesity, contributing to the development of metabolic comorbidities in this condition. Obese individuals with persistent low-grade systemic inflammation showed reduced leukocyte production of the DHA-derived monohydroxy fatty acid 17-hydroxy-DHA (HDHA) and unbalanced formation of SPMs (in particular D-series Rvs) accompanied by enhanced production of proinflammatory lipid mediators such as leukotriene B4. Mechanistic studies attributed this impairment to reduced 15-lipoxygenase (LOX) activity rather than altered DHA cellular uptake. Moreover, leukocytes from obese individuals exhibited decreased 5-LOX levels and reduced 5-LOX Ser271 phosphorylation and distinct intracellular 5-LOX redistribution. However, 15-LOX appears to be the most critical factor for the deficient production of SPMs by obese leukocytes because the formation of D-series Rvs was completely rescued by incubation with the intermediate precursor 17-HDHA. These data provide proof of concept that administration of intermediate precursors of SPM biosynthesis (e.g., 17-HDHA) could be more efficient in overriding impaired formation of these proresolving lipid mediators in conditions characterized by dysfunctional LOX activity, such as obesity.-López-Vicario, C., Titos, E., Walker, M.

In this work, the interaction of functionalized graphene with tunable hydrophobicity and bacteria is investigated. Poly(ethylene glycol)- block-(poly- N-isopropylacrylamide) copolymer (PEG- b-PNIPAM) with the triazine joint point was attached to the graphene surface by a nitrene [2 + 1] cycloaddition reaction. By thermally switching between hydrophobic and hydrophilic states, functionalized graphene sheets were able to bind to bacteria. Bacteria were eventually disrupted when the functionality was switched to the hydrophobic state. On the basis of measuring the different microscopy methods and a live/dead viability assay, it was found that Escherichia coli ( E. coli) bacteria are more susceptible to hydrophobic interactions than B. cereus bacteria, under the same conditions. Our investigations confirm that hydrophobic interaction is one of the main driving forces at the presented graphene/bacteria interfaces and promotes the antibacterial activity of graphene derivatives significantly.",CH Stretch Activation of CH3CHOO: Deep Tunneling to Hydroxyl Radical Products.,https://www.ncbi.nlm.nih.gov/pubmed/30840823,The journal of physical chemistry. A,2019 04 05,"Alkene ozonolysis, an important source of hydroxyl (OH) radicals in the Earth's troposphere, proceeds through unimolecular decay of Criegee intermediates. In this work, infrared activation of the methyl-substituted Criegee intermediate, syn-CH3CHOO, in the CH stretch fundamental region (2850-3150 cm-1) is shown to result in unimolecular decay to OH radical products. These excitation energies correspond to only half of the transition state barrier height, and thus the resultant 1,4 H atom transfer that leads to OH products occurs exclusively by quantum mechanical tunneling. Infrared action spectra recorded with UV laser-induced fluorescence detection of the OH products reveal the four CH stretch fundamentals and CO stretch overtone predicted to have strong transition strength. The vibrational band origins, relative intensities, and transition types derived from rotational band contour analyses are in good accord with theory. Distinctly different Lorentzian line broadening of the observed features is attributed to mode-specific anharmonic couplings predicted theoretically between spectroscopically bright and nearby dark states. The measured OH product state distribution shows a strong λ-doublet preference arising from pπ orbital alignment, which is indicative of the vinyl hydroperoxide intermediate along the reaction pathway. The unimolecular decay of syn-CH3CHOO at ca. 3000 cm-1 is predicted to be quite slow (ca. 105 s-1) using statistical Rice-Ramsperger-Kassel-Marcus theory with tunneling and much slower than observed at higher energies.",Connecting Wires: Photoinduced Electronic Structure Modulation in Metal-Organic Frameworks.,https://www.ncbi.nlm.nih.gov/pubmed/30840822,Journal of the American Chemical Society,2019 04 03,"Electronic structure modulation of metal-organic frameworks (MOFs) through the connection of linker ""wires"" as a function of an external stimulus is reported for the first time. The established correlation between MOF electronic properties and photoisomerization kinetics as well as changes in an absorption profile is unprecedented for extended well-defined structures containing coordinatively integrated photoresponsive linkers. The presented studies were carried out on both single crystal and bulk powder with preservation of framework integrity. An LED-containing electric circuit, in which the switching behavior was driven by the changes in MOF electronic profile, was built for visualization of experimental findings.

Real-time quantification of electron flux across this barrier by strains with different electron transfer capabilities revealed that this bacterium exports flavins to its surroundings when faced with no direct physical access to an electron acceptor, allowing it to reduce metals at distances exceeding 60 μm. An energy balance indicates that flavins must be recycled for S. oneidensis MR-1 to yield energy from lactate oxidation coupled to flavin reduction. In our system, we find that flavins are recycled between 24 and 60 times depending on flow conditions. This energy saving strategy, which until now had not been systematically tested or captured in environmentally relevant systems, suggests that electron shuttling microorganisms have the capacity to access and reduce metals in physically distant or potentially toxic microenvironments (i.e., pores with soluble and transiently sorbed toxins) where direct contact is limited or unfavorable. Our results challenge the prediction that diffusion-based electron shuttling is only effective across short distances and may lead to improved bioremediation strategies or advance biogeochemical models of electron transfer in anaerobic sediments.",Potential Neuroprotective Peptide Emerged from Dual Neurotherapeutic Targets: A Fusion Approach for the Development of Anti-Alzheimer's Lead.,https://www.ncbi.nlm.nih.gov/pubmed/30840820,ACS chemical neuroscience,2019 05 15,"Amyloid-beta (Aβ) peptide misfolds into fibrillary aggregates (β-sheet) and is deposited as amyloid plaques in the cellular environment, which severely damages intraneuronal connections leading to Alzheimer's disease (AD) pathogenesis. Furthermore, neurons are rich in tubulin/microtubules, and the intracellular network of microtubules also gets disrupted by the accumulation of Aβ fiber in the brain. Hence, development of new potent molecules, which can simultaneously inhibit Aβ fibrillations and stabilize microtubules, is particularly needed for the efficient therapeutic application in AD. To address these issues, here we introduced an innovative fusion strategy to design and develop next generation anti-AD therapeutic leads. This unexplored fusion strategy entails design and development of a potent nonapeptide by taking into account both the hydrophobic core (17-21) of Aβ peptide and the taxol binding region of β-tubulin. In vitro results suggest that this newly designed peptide interacts at the taxol binding region of β-tubulin with a moderate binding affinity and promotes microtubule polymerization. It has the ability to bind at the hydrophobic core (17-21) of Aβ, responsible for its aggregation, and prevent amyloid fibril as well as plaque formation. In addition, it interacts at the CAS site (catalytic anionic site) of acetylcholinesterase (AChE) and significantly inhibits AChE induced Aβ fibrillation, stimulates neurite branching, and provides stability to intracellular microtubules and extensive protection of neurons against nerve growth factor (NGF) deprived neuron toxicity. Moreover, this newly designed peptide shows good stability in serum obtained from humans and efficiently permeates the blood-brain barrier (BBB) without showing any toxicity toward differentiated PC12 neurons as well as primary rat cortical neurons. This excellent feature of protecting the neurons by stabilizing the microtubules without showing any toxicity toward neurons will make this peptide a potent therapeutic agent of AD in the near future.",Incidentally detected odontoma within a dentigerous cyst.,https://www.ncbi.nlm.nih.gov/pubmed/30840819,Archives of craniofacial surgery,2019 03 29,"Odontoma is an asymptomatic slow-growing odontogenic tumor. It is usually found by chance in the maxilla or mandible on radiography, or when it deforms the adjacent teeth. It is commonly found in patients who are 30 years of age or younger. We report our encounter with an odontoma within a dentigerous cyst found incidentally in a 56-year-old man. He presented with abnormal fullness in the right infraorbital area of the cheek. During the evaluation of the mass, we incidentally detected the odontogenic tumor within a dentigerous cyst in the patient's maxilla. Under general anesthesia, complete surgical drainage of the infraorbital cystic mass was performed. Enucleation of the odontogenic tumor and a bone grafting from the iliac bone were also performed. The final diagnosis was odontoma. After 2 years of follow-up, there was no sign of recurrence of the tumor. In case of odontogenic tumors, even in old patients, it is important to suspect an odontoma. When odontoma accompanies a dentigerous cyst, surgical excisional biopsy should be performed to rule out malignancy.

The standard curve of Tm-shift was established using the standard plasmids of A. ceylanicum (AceP) and A. tubaeforme (AtuP). The Tm-shift method stability, sensitivity, and accuracy were tested with reference to the standard curve, and clinical fecal samples were also examined. The results demonstrated that the 2 sets of primers based on the 2 SNPs could accurately distinguish between A. ceylanicum and A. tubaeforme. The coefficient of variation (CV) of Tm-values of AceP and AtuP was 0.07% and 0.06% in ITS101 and was 0.06% and 0.08% in ITS296, respectively.

No established clinically relevant criteria for defining and treating TRS exist, although guidelines have been promulgated for clozapine use among TRS patients. This report summarizes the consensus from a roundtable that focused on defining and identifying TRS, pathways to treatment resistance, current treatments, unmet needs, and disease burden. Nine clinical experts in schizophrenia and TRS participated in a closed meeting on June 23, 2017, sponsored by Lundbeck, at which published literature in key areas of TRS research was reviewed. The findings from published studies were synthesized by experts in each area and presented to the group for review and discussion. It was agreed that inadequate response to 2 different antipsychotics, each taken with adequate dose and duration, is required to establish TRS. This recommendation is consistent with guidelines for clozapine use. For each trial, objective symptom measures should be used to assess treatment response, with medication adherence ensured. Once nonresponse is established (after ≥ 12 weeks for positive symptoms [2 trials of ≥ 6 weeks]), the treatment plan should be reevaluated and alternative pharmacologic or nonpharmacologic treatments considered.

Reducing Cd transfer from soil to the rice grain is important for food safety. Rice cultivars vary widely in their Cd accumulation, but the genetic basis for this variation is not fully understood. Based on field and pot experiments comparing 26 rice cultivars, we identified a cultivar with high Cd accumulation in grain (BG367, coded as W4) and a cultivar with low grain Cd accumulation (Huajingxian 74, coded as W0). W4 showed a higher Cd translocation from roots to shoots than W0. Using chromosome single segment substitution lines derived from the two cultivars, we mapped a quantitative trait locus for Cd accumulation in grain to a 400 kb region in chromosome 7. Using yeast expression assays and transgenic complementation, we identified OsHMA3 as the causal gene at this locus. Compared with OsHMA3W0, OsHMA3W4 has a deletion of 14 amino acids predicted to be in the ATP binding domain. OsHMA3W4 showed a complete loss of transport activity for Cd in yeast assays. Taking our findings together, we have identified a new allele of OsHMA3 with a total loss-of-function, resulting in greatly elevated Cd translocation to rice shoots and grain.",The tonoplast-localized transporter OsHMA3 plays an important role in maintaining Zn homeostasis in rice.,https://www.ncbi.nlm.nih.gov/pubmed/30840766,Journal of experimental botany,2019 05 14,"In order to respond to fluctuating zinc (Zn) in the environment, plants must have a system to control Zn homeostasis. However, how plants maintain an appropriate level of Zn during their growth and development is still poorly understood. In this study, we found that OsHMA3, a tonoplast-localized transporter for Zn/Cd, plays an important role in Zn homeostasis in rice. Accessions with the functional allele of OsHMA3 showed greater tolerance to high Zn than those with the non-functional allele based on root elongation test. A 67Zn-labeling experiment showed that accessions with loss of function of OsHMA3 had lower Zn accumulation in the roots but similar concentrations in the shoots compared with functional OsHMA3 accessions. When exposed to Zn-free growing medium, the concentration in the root cell sap was rapidly decreased in accessions with functional OsHMA3, but less dramatic changes were observed in non-functional accessions. A mobility experiment showed that more Zn in the roots was translocated to the shoots in accessions with functional OsHMA3. Higher expression levels of OsZIP4, OsZIP5, OsZIP8, and OsZIP10 were found in the roots of accessions with functional OsHMA3 in response to Zn deficiency. Taken together, our results indicate that OsHMA3 plays an important role in rice roots in both Zn detoxification and storage by sequestration into the vacuoles, depending on Zn concentration in the environment.",Use and success of In Vitro Fertilization following Restorative Proctocolectomy and Ileal Pouch-Anal Anastomosis.

K. pneumoniae was isolated from stools of 17/149 (11%) patients and 18/922 swabs of their environment, together with one patient bloodstream infection during the study and 4 others over a 24-month period. Each patient carried one or more lineages that was unique to them, but two broad environmental contamination events and patient-environmental transmission were identified. K. pneumoniae was isolated from cattle and poultry, hospital sewage and 12/20 wastewater plants. There was low genetic relatedness between isolates from patients/their hospital environment versus isolates from elsewhere. Identical genes encoding cephalosporin resistance were carried by isolates from different reservoirs, but were carried on different plasmids by isolates from patients/their environment versus elsewhere.

 regions of interest (ROIs) from 40 digital mammograms were studied along with 39 manually delineated ROIs from the head and neck (HN) computed tomography (CT) scans of 39 patients. Each package was used to calculate first-order histogram and second-order gray-level co-occurrence matrix (GLCM) features. Friedman tests determined differences in feature values across packages, whereas intraclass-correlation coefficients (ICC) quantified agreement. All first-order features computed from both mammography and HN cases (except skewness in mammography) showed significant differences across all packages due to systematic biases introduced by each package; however, based on ICC values, all but one first-order feature calculated on mammography ROIs and all but two first-order features calculated on HN CT ROIs showed excellent agreement, indicating the observed differences were small relative to the feature values but the bias was systematic. All second-order features computed from the two databases both differed significantly and showed poor agreement among packages, due largely to discrepancies in package-specific default GLCM parameters. Additional differences in radiomics features were traced to variations in image preprocessing, algorithm implementation, and naming conventions. Large variations in features among software packages indicate that increased efforts to standardize radiomics processes must be conducted.",Malaria parasite detection and cell counting for human and mouse using thin blood smear microscopy.,https://www.ncbi.nlm.nih.gov/pubmed/30840746,"Journal of medical imaging (Bellingham, Wash.)",2019 03 09,"Despite the remarkable progress that has been made to reduce global malaria mortality by 29% in the past 5 years, malaria is still a serious global health problem.

Using interstitial pressure data from a porcine study, we use an inverse model to reconstruct material properties in an effort to capture these in vivo brain tissue dynamics. Four distinct models for the reconstruction of parameters are investigated (full anatomical condition description, condition without dural septa description, condition without ventricle boundary description, and the conventional fully saturated model). These models are systematic in their development to isolate the influence of three model characteristics: the dural septa, the treatment of the ventricles, and the treatment of the brain as a saturated media. This study demonstrates that to capture appropriate pressure compartmentalization, interstitial pressure gradients, pressure transient effects, and deformations within the brain, the proposed boundary conditions and structural enhancement coupled with a heterogeneous description invoking partial saturation are needed in a biphasic poroelastic model. These findings suggest that with enhanced anatomical modeling and appropriate model assumptions, poroelastic models can be used to capture quite complex brain deformations and interstitial pressure dynamics.",Impact of automatically detected motion artifacts on coronary calcium scoring in chest computed tomography.,https://www.ncbi.nlm.nih.gov/pubmed/30840743,"Journal of medical imaging (Bellingham, Wash.)",2019 03 08,"The amount of coronary artery calcification (CAC) quantified in computed tomography (CT) scans enables prediction of cardiovascular disease (CVD) risk.

This study includes 1000 baseline and 585 one-year follow-up low-dose chest CTs from the National Lung Screening Trial. About 415 baseline scans are used to train and evaluate a convolutional neural network that identifies observer determined CACs affected by severe motion artifacts. Therefore, 585 paired scans acquired at baseline and follow-up were used to evaluate the impact of severe motion artifacts on CAC quantification and risk categorization. Based on the CAC amount, the scans were categorized into four standard CVD risk categories. The method identified CACs affected by severe motion artifacts with 85.2% accuracy. Moreover, reproducibility of CAC scores in scan pairs is higher in scans containing mostly CACs not affected by severe cardiac motion. Hence, the proposed method enables identification of scans affected by severe cardiac motion, where CAC quantification may not be reproducible.",Recurrence analysis on prostate cancer patients with Gleason score 7 using integrated histopathology whole-slide images and genomic data through deep neural networks.,https://www.ncbi.nlm.nih.gov/pubmed/30840742,"Journal of medical imaging (Bellingham, Wash.)",2019 03 09,"Prostate cancer is the most common nonskin-related cancer, affecting one in seven men in the United States.

When developers are ready to apply their CADe device to a mammographic acquisition system, they typically assess the device with images acquired using the system. Collecting large repositories of clinical images containing verified lesion locations acquired by a system is costly and time consuming. We previously developed an image blending technique that allows users to seamlessly insert regions of interest (ROIs) from one medical image into another image. Our goal is to assess the performance of this technique for inserting microcalcification clusters from one mammogram into another, with the idea that when fully developed, our technique may be useful for reducing the clinical data burden in the assessment of a CADe device for use with an image acquisition system. We first perform a reader study to assess whether experienced observers can distinguish between computationally inserted and native clusters. For this purpose, we apply our insertion technique to 55 clinical cases. ROIs containing microcalcification clusters from one breast of a patient are inserted into the contralateral breast of the same patient. The analysis of the reader ratings using receiver operating characteristic (ROC) methodology indicates that inserted clusters cannot be reliably distinguished from native clusters (area under the ROC

Recent fluorescence microscopy techniques can collect hundreds of focal plane images from deeper tissue volumes, thus enabling characterization of three-dimensional (3-D) biological structures at subcellular resolution. Automatic analysis methods are required to obtain quantitative, objective, and reproducible measurements of biological quantities. However, these images typically contain many artifacts such as poor edge details, nonuniform brightness, and distortions that vary along different axes, all of which complicate the automatic image analysis. Another challenge is due to ""multitarget labeling,"" in which a single probe labels multiple biological entities in acquired images. We present a ""jelly filling"" method for segmentation of 3-D biological images containing multitarget labeling. Intuitively, our iterative segmentation method is based on filling disjoint tubule regions of an image with a jelly-like fluid.

Advances in machine learning-based techniques show great potential for automatic image segmentation, but these techniques usually require a huge amount of accurately annotated reference segmentations for training. The guiding hypothesis of this paper was that crowd-algorithm collaboration could evolve as a key technique in large-scale medical data annotation. As an initial step toward this goal, we evaluated the performance of untrained individuals to detect and correct errors made by three-dimensional (3-D) medical segmentation algorithms. To this end, we developed a multistage segmentation pipeline incorporating a hybrid crowd-algorithm 3-D segmentation algorithm integrated into a medical imaging platform. In a pilot study of liver segmentation using a publicly available dataset of computed tomography scans, we show that the crowd is able to detect and refine inaccurate organ contours with a quality similar to that of experts (engineers with domain knowledge, medical students, and radiologists). Although the crowds need significantly more time for the annotation of a slice, the annotation rate is extremely high. This could render crowdsourcing a key tool for cost-effective large-scale medical image annotation.","Validation of automatic cochlear implant electrode localization techniques using

Clinical studies have shown that IGCIP leads to significantly improved outcomes. A crucial step is the localization of the electrodes, and rigorously quantifying the accuracy of our algorithms requires dedicated datasets. We discuss the creation of a ground truth dataset for electrode position and its use to evaluate the accuracy of our electrode localization techniques.

Deep convolutional neural networks (CNNs) were trained separately for the left and right hemithoraces on the task of differentiating between pleural thickening and normal thoracic tissue on computed tomography (CT) scans. A total of 4259 and 6192 axial sections containing segmented tumor were used to train the left-hemithorax CNN and the right-hemithorax CNN, respectively. Two distinct test sets of 131 sections from the CT scans of 43 patients were used to evaluate segmentation performance by calculating the Dice similarity coefficient (DSC) between deep CNN-generated tumor segmentations and reference tumor segmentations provided by a total of eight observers. Median DSC values ranged from 0.662 to 0.800 over the two test sets when comparing deep CNN-generated segmentations with observer reference segmentations. The deep CNN-based method achieved significantly higher DSC values for all three observers on the test set that allowed direct comparisons with a previously published automated segmentation method of MPM tumor on CT scans (

Pathologically-confirmed malignancies from 30 thoracic patient cases from the RIDER database were modeled. Tumors were either isolated or attached to lung structures. Patient images were acquired on one of two CT scanner models (Lightspeed 16 or VCT; GE Healthcare) using standard chest protocol. Real tumors were segmented and used to inform the size and shape of simulated tumors. Simulated tumors developed in Duke Lesion Tool (Duke University) were inserted using a validated image-domain insertion program. Four readers performed volume measurements using three commercial segmentation tools. We compared the volume estimation performance of segmentation tools between real tumors in actual patient CT images and corresponding simulated tumors virtually inserted into the same patient images (i.e., hybrid datasets). Comparisons involved (1) direct assessment of measured volumes and the standard deviation between simulated and real tumors across readers and tools, respectively, (2) multivariate analysis, involving segmentation tools, readers, tumor shape, and attachment, and (3) effect of local tumor environment on volume measurement. Volume comparison showed consistent trends (9% volumetric difference) between real and simulated tumors across all segmentation tools, readers, shapes, and attachments. Across all cases, readers, and segmentation tools, an intraclass correlation coefficient = 0.99 indicates that simulated tumors correlated strongly with real tumors ( 

p

 ). In addition, the impact of the local tumor environment on tumor volume measurement was found to have a segmentation tool-related influence. Strong agreement between simulated tumors modeled in this study compared to their real counterparts suggests a high degree of similarity. This indicates that, volumetrically, simulated tumors embedded into patient CT data can serve as reasonable surrogates to real patient data.",Integration of spatial information in convolutional neural networks for automatic segmentation of intraoperative transrectal ultrasound images.,https://www.ncbi.nlm.nih.gov/pubmed/30840715,"Journal of medical imaging (Bellingham, Wash.)",2019 03 08,"Image guidance systems that register scans of the prostate obtained using transrectal ultrasound (TRUS) and magnetic resonance imaging are becoming increasingly popular as a means of enabling tumor-targeted prostate cancer biopsy and treatment. However, intraoperative segmentation of TRUS images to define the three-dimensional (3-D) geometry of the prostate remains a necessary task in existing guidance systems, which often require significant manual interaction and are subject to interoperator variability. Therefore, automating this step would lead to more acceptable clinical workflows and greater standardization between different operators and hospitals. In this work, a convolutional neural network (CNN) for automatically segmenting the prostate in two-dimensional (2-D) TRUS slices of a 3-D TRUS volume was developed and tested. The network was designed to be able to incorporate 3-D spatial information by taking one or more TRUS slices neighboring each slice to be segmented as input, in addition to these slices. The accuracy of the CNN was evaluated on data from a cohort of 109 patients who had undergone TRUS-guided targeted biopsy, (a total of 4034 2-D slices). The segmentation accuracy was measured by calculating 2-D and 3-D Dice similarity coefficients, on the 2-D images and corresponding 3-D volumes, respectively, as well as the 2-D boundary distances, using a 10-fold patient-level cross-validation experiment. However, incorporating neighboring slices did not improve the segmentation performance in five out of six experiment results, which include varying the number of neighboring slices from 1 to 3 at either side. The up-sampling shortcuts reduced the overall training time of the network, 161 min compared with 253 min without the architectural addition."

The Mycobacterium tuberculosis (Mtb) strains from HT and LT index cases of the households were designated Mtb-HT and Mtb-LT, respectively. We found that C3HeB/FeJ mice infected with Mtb-LT strains exhibited significantly higher bacterial burden compared to Mtb-HT strains and also developed diffused inflammatory lung pathology. In stark contrast, a significant number of mice infected with Mtb-HT strains developed caseating granulomas, a lesion type with high potential to cavitate. None of the Mtb-HT infected animals developed diffused inflammatory lung pathology. A link was observed between increased in vitro replication of Mtb-LT strains and their ability to induce significantly high lipid droplet formation in macrophages. These results support that distinct early interactions of Mtb-HT and Mtb-LT strains with macrophages and subsequent differential trajectories in pathological disease may be the mechanism underlying their transmission potential.",Growth enhancement of porcine epidemic diarrhea virus (PEDV) in Vero E6 cells expressing PEDV nucleocapsid protein.,https://www.ncbi.nlm.nih.gov/pubmed/30840701,PloS one,2019 03 29,"More recently emerging strains of porcine epidemic diarrhea virus (PEDV) cause severe diarrhea and especially high mortality rates in infected piglets, leading to substantial economic loss to worldwide swine industry. These outbreaks urgently call for updated and effective PEDV vaccines. Better understanding in PEDV biology and improvement in technological platforms for virus production can immensely assist and accelerate PEDV vaccine development. In this study, we explored the ability of PEDV nucleocapsid (N) protein in improving viral yields in cell culture systems. We demonstrated that PEDV N expression positively affected both recovery of PEDV from infectious clones and PEDV propagation in cell culture. Compared to Vero E6 cells, Vero E6 cells expressing PEDV N could accelerate growth of a slow-growing PEDV strain to higher peak titers by 12 hours or enhance the yield of a vaccine candidate strain by two orders of magnitude. Interestingly, PEDV N also slightly enhances replication of porcine reproductive and respiratory virus, a PEDV relative in the Nidovirales order. These results solidify the importance of N in PEDV recovery and propagation and suggest a potentially useful consideration in designing vaccine production platforms for PEDV or closely related pathogens.",Food insecurity and violence in a prospective cohort of women at risk for or living with HIV in the U.S.,https://www.ncbi.nlm.nih.gov/pubmed/30840700,PloS one,2019 03 29,"Food insecurity and violence are two major public health issues facing U.S. women.

This knowledge is particularly important considering their function in food webs and ecosystem services. In this study, we investigated the factors affecting distribution and abundance of the little auk Alle alle, a seabird considered a keystone species of the Arctic ecosystem. We performed the study on the W and the NW coast of Spitsbergen. Using Generalized Additive Models (GAMs) and Conditional Inference Tree (CIT) we examined factors related to presence/absence and size (estimated number of breeding pairs) of the little auk colonies. We also tested the nesting preferences for geographical features such as aspect, slope angle, altitude, solar radiation, rock type, and distance to foraging grounds. Our findings indicate that the occurrence of little auk breeding colonies is non-random and highly attributed to environmental factors. The probability of colony occurrence was significantly associated with altitude (negative relationship; preference to sites situated lower), solar radiation (positive relationship; the higher radiation, the more likely colony occurrence) and slope (positive relationship; the steeper a slope, the more likely colony occurrence), whilst aspect appeared non-significant (though the probability of colony occurrence peaked at southern slopes). Colony size was significantly associated with rock type (larger colonies in amphibolite and quartzite). The distance to foraging grounds did not appear to affect the probability of colony occurrence and size, implying that birds may choose optimal breeding sites at the cost of longer foraging flights. We estimated the Spitsbergen little auk breeding population at 728 529 (5-95% CI: 479 312-986 352). Spitsbergen comprises ca 1.9% (95% CI: 1.2%-2.7%) of the world breeding population and represents the third most important breeding area for the species, following the W and the E coast of Greenland.","Split green fluorescent protein as a tool to study infection with a plant pathogen, Cauliflower mosaic virus.",https://www.ncbi.nlm.nih.gov/pubmed/30840696,PloS one,2019 03 29,"The split GFP technique is based on the auto-assembly of GFP when two polypeptides-GFP1-10 (residues 1-214; the detector) and GFP11 (residues 215-230; the tag)-both non-fluorescing on their own, associate spontaneously to form a fluorescent molecule. We evaluated this technique for its efficacy in contributing to the characterization of Cauliflower mosaic virus (CaMV) infection. A recombinant CaMV with GFP11 fused to the viral protein P6 (a key player in CaMV infection and major constituent of viral factory inclusions that arise during infection) was constructed and used to inoculate transgenic Arabidopsis thaliana expressing GFP1-10. The mutant virus (CaMV11P6) was infectious, aphid-transmissible and the insertion was stable over many passages. Symptoms on infected plants were delayed and milder. Viral protein accumulation, especially of recombinant 11P6, was greatly decreased, impeding its detection early in infection. Nonetheless, spread of infection from the inoculated leaf to other leaves was followed by whole plant imaging. Infected cells displayed in real time confocal laser scanning microscopy fluorescence in wild type-looking virus factories. Thus, it allowed for the first time to track a CaMV protein in vivo in the context of an authentic infection. 11P6 was immunoprecipitated with anti-GFP nanobodies, presenting a new application for the split GFP system in protein-protein interaction assays and proteomics.

Using peptide phage display as a tool to identify potential molecular targets in HPV associated tumors, we identified α-mannosidase, among other enriched sequences. This enzyme is expressed in both tumor and inflammatory compartment of the tumor microenvironment. Several studies in experimental models have shown that its inhibition by swainsonine (SW) led to inhibition of tumor growth and metastasis directly and indirectly, through activation of macrophages and NK cells, promoting anti-tumor activity. Therefore, the aim of this work was to test if swainsonine treatment could modulate anti-tumor immune responses and therefore interfere in HPV associated tumor growth. Validation of our biopanning results showed that cervical tumors, both tumor cells and leukocytes, expressed α-mannosidase. Ex vivo experiments with tumor associated macrophages showed that SW could partially modulate macrophage phenotype, decreasing CCL2 secretion and impairing IL-10 and IL-6 upregulation, which prompted us to proceed to in vivo tests. However, in vivo, SW treatment increased tumor growth. Investigation of the mechanisms leading to this result showed that SW treatment significantly induced the accumulation of myeloid derived suppressor cells in the spleen of tumor bearing mice, which inhibited T cell activation. Our results suggested that SW contributes to cervical cancer progression by favoring proliferation and accumulation of myeloid cells in the spleen, thus exacerbating these tumors systemic effects on the immune system, therefore facilitating tumor growth."

The proportion of the phenotypic variations explained by the individual SNPs varied between 7%, for the SNP S1_285330124 (located on chromosome 9 and associated with the EH/PH ratio), and 22%, for the SNP S1_317085830 (located on chromosome 6 and associated with the leaf angle). A total of 40 haplotype blocks were significantly associated with the traits of interest, explaining up to 29% of the phenotypic variation for the leaf angle, corresponding to the haplotype hapLA4.04, which was stable over two growing seasons. Overall, the associations for PH, EH and the EH/PH ratio were environment-specific, which was confirmed by performing a model comparison analysis using the information criteria of Akaike and Schwarz.

We validate this ""AutonoMouse"" system in a series of olfactory behavioural tasks and show that acquired data is comparable to previous semi-manual approaches. Furthermore, we use AutonoMouse to systematically probe the impact of graded olfactory bulb lesions on olfactory behaviour, demonstrating that while odour discrimination in general is robust to even most extensive disruptions, small olfactory bulb lesions already impair odour detection. Discrimination learning of similar mixtures as well as learning speed are in turn reliably impacted by medium lesion sizes.

In this paper, we study the global activity of users in bike-sharing systems operating in the cities of Chicago and New York. For this transportation mode, we explore the temporal and spatial characteristics of the mobility of cyclists. In particular, through the analysis of origin-destination matrices, we characterize the spatial structure of the displacements of users. We apply a mobility model for the global activity of the system that classifies the displacements between stations in local and non-local transitions. In local transitions, cyclists move in a region around each station whereas, in the non-local case, bike users travel with long-range displacements in a similar way to Lévy flights. We reproduce the spatial dynamics by using Monte Carlo simulations. The obtained results are similar to the observed in real data and reveal that the model implemented captures important characteristics of the global spatial dynamics in the systems analyzed.","Geological significance of new zircon U-Pb geochronology and geochemistry: Niuxinshan intrusive complex, northern North China Craton.",https://www.ncbi.nlm.nih.gov/pubmed/30840673,PloS one,2019 03 29,"The Huajian gold deposit is one of the largest hydrothermal intrusion-related gold deposits in eastern Hebei Province, located in the northern margin of the North China Craton (NCC). The mineralization in this district displays a close spatial association with the shoshonitic Niuxinshan intrusive complex (NIC), which contributes to the characterization of the metallogeny associated with convergent margin magmatism. In the current study, new geochronological and geochemical data are combined with previously published isotopic data, obtained from the granitic rocks in the NIC, to constrain the timing of the district's tectonic setting transformation and determine its bearing on regional metallogeny. The new geochronological data constrain the timing of the tectonic transformation between 155 and 185 Ma. The NIC's granitic rocks can be geochemically subdivided into two groups. One group's geochemical signature exhibits steep rare earth element (REE) patterns with negligible Eu anomalies, lower Yb, higher Sr, and negative Nb-Ta-Ti (NTT) anomalies, which indicate a volcanic-arc environment with a thickened crust in a convergent setting. The other group exhibits flat REE patterns with obvious negative Eu anomalies, higher Yb, lower Sr, and weak NTT anomalies, which indicate an intra-plate extensional environment with a thinning crust. Combining geochronologic and isotopic data, the mineralization is Late Jurassic (~155 Ma). This is interpreted to be genetically related to the crystallization of the shallow crustal-sourced portions of this complex. Additionally, a tectonic model is presented that provides a plausible explanation for the abundant polymetallic mineralization that occurs in the northern margin of the NCC after 155 Ma.","Empowering HIV-infected women in low-resource settings: A pilot study evaluating a patient-centered HIV prevention strategy for reproduction in Kisumu, Kenya.",https://www.ncbi.nlm.nih.gov/pubmed/30840672,PloS one,2019 03 29,"Female positive/male negative HIV-serodiscordant couples express a desire for children and may engage in condomless sex to become pregnant.

In a c-VEP based study in normal subjects (n = 44, 21 females) we presented these codes visually and recorded EEG signals from the corresponding codes for their four lagged versions. Canonical correlation analysis (CCA) and spatiotemporal beamforming (STB) methods were used for target identification and comparison of responses. Additionally, we compared the subjective self-declared fatigue using VAS caused by presented m-sequence and chaotic codes. The introduced chaotic code was decoded from EEG responses with CCA and STB methods. The maximum total accuracy values of 93.6 ± 11.9% and 94 ± 14.4% were achieved with STB method for chaotic and m-sequence codes for all subjects respectively. The achieved accuracies in all subjects were not significantly different in m-sequence and chaotic codes.

However, few studies have focused on what many scholars call the urban densification process (i.e., urban intensity expansion) despite its importance to both planning and subsequent impacts to the environment and local economies. This paper documents past urban densification patterns and uses this information to predict future densification trends in southeastern Wisconsin (SEWI) by using a rich dataset from the United States and by adapting the well-known Land Transformation Model (LTM) for this purpose. Urban densification is a significant and progressive process that often accompanies urbanization more generally. The increasing proportion of lower density areas, rather than higher density areas, was the main characteristic of the urban densification in SEWI from 2001 to 2011. We believe that improving urban land use efficiency to maintain rational densification are effective means toward a sustainable urban landscape. Multiple goodness-of-fit metrics demonstrated that the reconfigured LTM performed relatively well to simulate urban densification patterns in 2006 and 2011, enabling us to forecast densification to 2016 and 2021. The predicted future urban densification patterns are likely to be characterized by higher densities continue to increase at the expense of lower densities. We argue that detailed categories of urban density and specific relevant predictor variables are indispensable for densification prediction. Our study provides researchers working in land change science with important insights into urban densification process modeling. The outcome of this model can help planners to identify the current trajectory of urban development, enabling them to take informed action to promote planning objectives, which could benefit sustainable urbanization definitely.",Population density and temperature correlate with long-term trends in somatic growth rates and maturation schedules of herring and sprat.,https://www.ncbi.nlm.nih.gov/pubmed/30840654,PloS one,2019 03 29,"We examine long-term trends in the average growth rates and maturation schedules of herring and sprat populations using survey data collected from the North Sea and west of Scotland since the 1960s and 1980s respectively. Otolith age data and maturity data are used to calculate time series of mean lengths at age, von Bertalanffy growth parameters, and probabilistic maturation reaction norms. As the growth and maturation of fish is known to be influenced by temperature and stock abundances, we account for these variables using Generalised Additive Models. Each of the herring populations displayed either steady declines in mean length across multiple age groups, or declines in length followed years later by some recovery. Depending on region, lengths at age of sprat increased or decreased over time. Varying temporal trends in maturation propensity at age and length were observed across herring populations. Many of the trends in growth rate and maturation were correlated to population abundance and/or temperature. In general, abundance is shown to be negatively correlated to growth rates in herring and sprat, and positively correlated with maturation propensity in herring. Temperature is also shown to be correlated to growth and maturation, and although the effect is consistent within species, the temperature effects differ between herring and sprat. This study provides detailed information about long-term trends in growth and maturation, which is lacking for some of these pelagic stocks, especially in the west of Scotland.",Molecular and genetic characterization of partial masculinization in embryonic ovaries grafted into male nude mice.,https://www.ncbi.nlm.nih.gov/pubmed/30840652,PloS one,2019 03 29,"In most of mammalian embryos, gonadal sex differentiation occurs inside the maternal uterus before birth. In several fetal ovarian grafting experiments using male host mice, an experimental switch from the maternal intrauterine to male-host environment gradually induces partial masculinization of the grafted ovaries even under the wild-type genotype. However, either host-derived factors causing or molecular basis underlying this masculinization of the fetal ovaries are not clear. Here, we demonstrate that ectopic appearance of SOX9-positive Sertoli cell-like cells in grafted ovaries was mediated by the testosterone derived from the male host. Neither Sox8 nor Amh activity in the ovarian tissues is essential for such ectopic appearance of SOX9-positive cells. The transcriptome analyses of the grafted ovaries during this masculinization process showed early downregulation of pro-ovarian genes such as Irx3, Nr0b1/Dax1, Emx2, and Fez1/Lzts1 by days 7-10 post-transplantation, and subsequent upregulation of several pro-testis genes, such as Bhlhe40, Egr1/2, Nr4a2, and Zc3h12c by day 20, leading to a partial sex reversal with altered expression profiles in one-third of the total numbers of the sex-dimorphic pre-granulosa and Sertoli cell-specific genes at 12.5 dpc. Our data imply that the paternal testosterone exposure is partially responsible for the sex-reversal expression profiles of certain pro-ovarian and pro-testis genes in the fetal ovaries in a temporally dependent manner.",Psychological factors and premenstrual syndrome: A Spanish case-control study.,https://www.ncbi.nlm.nih.gov/pubmed/30840651,PloS one,2019 03 29,"To assess whether the psychological variables perceived stress, neuroticism and coping strategies, are associated with Premenstrual Syndrome (PMS) and Premenstrual Dysphoric Syndrome (PMDD).",Postural control of a musculoskeletal model against multidirectional support surface translations.,https://www.ncbi.nlm.nih.gov/pubmed/30840650,PloS one,2019 03 29,"The human body is a complex system driven by hundreds of muscles, and its control mechanisms are not sufficiently understood. To understand the mechanisms of human postural control, neural controller models have been proposed by different research groups, including our feed-forward and feedback control model. However, these models have been evaluated under forward and backward perturbations, at most. Because a human body experiences perturbations from many different directions in daily life, neural controller models should be evaluated in response to multidirectional perturbations, including in the forward/backward, lateral, and diagonal directions. The objective of this study was to investigate the validity of an NC model with FF and FB control under multidirectional perturbations. We developed a musculoskeletal model with 70 muscles and 15 degrees of freedom of joints, positioned it in a standing posture by using the neural controller model, and translated its support surface in multiple directions as perturbations. We successfully determined the parameters of the neural controller model required to maintain the stance of the musculoskeletal model for each perturbation direction. The trends in muscle response magnitudes and the magnitude of passive ankle stiffness were consistent with the results of experimental studies. We conclude that the neural controller model can adapt to multidirectional perturbations by generating suitable muscle activations. We anticipate that the neural controller model could be applied to the study of the control mechanisms of patients with torso tilt and diagnosis of the change in control mechanisms from patients' behaviors.",Video loss prediction model in wireless networks.,https://www.ncbi.nlm.nih.gov/pubmed/30840649,PloS one,2019 03 29,"This work discusses video communications over wireless networks (IEEE 802.11ac standard). The videos are in three different resolutions: 720p, 1080p, and 2160p. It is essential to study the performance of these media in access technologies to enhance the current coding and communications techniques. This study sets out a video quality prediction model that includes the different resolutions that are based on wireless network terms and conditions, an approach that has not previously been adopted in the literature. The model involves obtaining Service and Experience Quality Metrics, such as PSNR (Peak Signal-to-Noise Ratio) and packet loss. This article outlines a methodology and mathematical model for video quality loss in the wireless network from simulated data and its accuracy is ensured through the use of performance metrics (RMSE and Standard Deviation). The methodology is based on two mathematical functions, (logarithmic and exponential), and their parameters are defined by linear regression. The model obtained RMSE values and standard deviation of 2.32 dB and 2.2 dB for the predicted values, respectively. The results should lead to a CODEC (Coder-Decoder) improvement and contribute to a better wireless networks design.",Contact with adult hen affects development of caecal microbiota in newly hatched chicks.,https://www.ncbi.nlm.nih.gov/pubmed/30840648,PloS one,2019 03 29,"Chickens in commercial production are hatched in a clean hatchery environment in the absence of any contact with adult hens. However, Gallus gallus evolved to be hatched in a nest in contact with an adult hen which may act as a donor of gut microbiota. In this study, we therefore addressed the issue of microbiota development in newly hatched chickens with or without contact with an adult hen. We found that a mere 24-hour-long contact between a hen and newly hatched chickens was long enough for transfer of hen gut microbiota to chickens. Hens were efficient donors of Bacteroidetes and Actinobacteria. However, except for genus Faecalibacterium and bacterial species belonging to class Negativicutes, hens did not act as an important source of Gram-positive Firmicutes. Though common to the chicken intestinal tract, Lactobacilli and isolates from families Erysipelotrichaceae, Lachnospiraceae and Ruminococcaceae therefore originated from environmental sources instead of from the hens. These observation may have considerable consequences for the evidence-based design of the new generation of probiotics for poultry.",Variable weights theory and its application to multi-attribute group decision making with intuitionistic fuzzy numbers on determining decision maker's weights.,https://www.ncbi.nlm.nih.gov/pubmed/30840647,PloS one,2019 03 29,"The determination of the weights of decision makers (DMs) is an important problem in multi-attribute group decision making. Many approaches have been presented to determine DMs' weights. However, the computed weight vectors of DMs are usually assumed to be constant in existing studies, and this may cause irrationalities in the decision results. Therefore, this article proposes a novel method to determine DMs' weights based on variable weights theory in which the evaluation information is described as intuitionistic fuzzy sets (IFSs). First, DMs provide their assessment with IFSs, and the intuitionistic fuzzy weighted averaging (IFWA) operator is applied to obtain weighted decision matrix based on the prior given DMs' and attributes' weights. Second, the DMs' weights are obtained based on variable weights theory, and an alternative decision can be computed. Finally, the converted value of the achieved IFS of each alternative is calculated, and the best appropriate alternative is acquired. Two illustrative examples and the comparisons with exsiting approaches are also used to reflect the effectiveness of the proposed approach.",Targeted next generation sequencing can serve as an alternative to conventional tests in myeloid neoplasms.,https://www.ncbi.nlm.nih.gov/pubmed/30840646,PloS one,2019 03 29,"The 2016 World Health Organization classification introduced a number of genes with somatic mutations and a category for germline predisposition syndromes in myeloid neoplasms. We have designed a comprehensive next-generation sequencing assay to detect somatic mutations, translocations, and germline mutations in a single assay and have evaluated its clinical utility in patients with myeloid neoplasms. Extensive and specified bioinformatics analyses were undertaken to detect single nucleotide variations, FLT3 internal tandem duplication, genic copy number variations, and chromosomal copy number variations. This enabled us to maximize the clinical utility of the assay, and we concluded that, as a single assay, it can be a good supplement for many conventional tests, including Sanger sequencing, RT-PCR, and cytogenetics. Of note, we found that 8.4-11.6% of patients with acute myeloid leukemia and 12.9% of patients with myeloproliferative neoplasms had germline mutations, and most were heterozygous carriers for autosomal recessive marrow failure syndromes. These patients often did not respond to standard chemotherapy, suggesting that germline predisposition may have distinct and significant clinical implications.",Improved calibration estimators for the total cost of health programs and application to immunization in Brazil.,https://www.ncbi.nlm.nih.gov/pubmed/30840645,PloS one,2019 03 29,"Multi-stage/level sampling designs have been widely used by survey statisticians as a means of obtaining reliable and efficient estimates at a reasonable implementation cost. This method has been particularly useful in National country-wide surveys to assess the costs of delivering public health programs, which are generally originated in different levels of service management and delivery. Unbiased and efficient estimates of costs are essential to adequately allocate resources and inform policy and planning. In recent years, the global health community has become increasingly interested in estimating the costs of immunization programs. In such programs, part of the cost correspond to vaccines and it is in most countries procured at the central level, while the rest of the costs are incurred in states, municipalities and health facilities, respectively. As such, total program cost is a result of adding these costs, and its variance should account for the relation between the totals at the different levels. An additional challenge is the missing information at the various levels. A variety of methods have been developed to compensate for this missing data. Weighting adjustments are often used to make the estimates consistent with readily-available information. For estimation of total program costs this implies adjusting the estimates at each level to comply with the characteristics of the country. In 2014, A National study to estimate the costs of the Brazilian National Immunization Program was initiated, requested by the Ministry of Health and with the support of international partners. We formulate a quick and useful way to compute the variance and deal with missing values at the various levels. Our approach involves calibrating the weights at each level using additional readily-available information such as the total number of doses administered. Taking the Brazilian immunization costing study as an example, this approach results in substantial gains in both efficiency and precision of the cost estimate."

The impact of unintended pregnancy is so severe that the rate of women who die or suffer an injury while giving birth in crisis settings is almost double the world average death rate. Thus, this study was aimed to investigate the utilization of modern contraceptive and associated factors among women in the reproductive age group in Shimelba refugee camp, Northern Ethiopia. A community-based cross-sectional study was employed and 329 study subjects were selected using simple random sampling technique with a face-to-face interview. The prevalence of using modern contraceptive was 47.7% and the study showed that being older [AOR = 0.017, 95%CI: 0.001, 0.467], being single [AOR = 0.17, 95%CI:0.031,0.914], being unemployed [AOR = 0.21, 95% CI:0.001,0.392], having no partner support [AOR = 0.006, 95% CI:0.001,0.044], and inconvenient service site AOR = 0.089,95% CI:0.013, 0.595] were factors that contributed to women not using modern contraceptive methods. Receipt of counseling on family planning utilization was more likely to helps women to use it [AOR = 3.37, 95% CI: 1.1095, 10.236]. Our study concluded that the current prevalence rate of contraceptive use is fairly good. However, much effort has to be made to improve this result. The situations in refugee can exacerbate the existing barriers to the use of contraceptives. Given its grave consequence on the livelihood of women, the contraceptive issue should be given due emphasis using several techniques including education to expand the awareness on modern contraceptive so as to augment access to family planning.",The effect of a transient immune activation on subjective health perception in two placebo controlled randomised experiments.,https://www.ncbi.nlm.nih.gov/pubmed/30840633,PloS one,2019 03 29,"Patient-reported outcomes predict mortality and play increasingly important roles in care, but factors that modify central measures such as health ratings have been little investigated.

The approach allows us to identify the most and least desired green space characteristics (attributes) and to assess the willingness to pay for the multifunctionality of green spaces. To do this, we test the following hypotheses, each with a separate hedonic pricing model: the proximity of all green space characteristics increases the property prices, but the specific monetary value of these characteristics differs;the multifunctionality of green spaces is well recognized and highly valued by real estate buyers. We find partial support for the first hypothesis: the green space attributes of ""aesthetics"", ""social activity"" and ""nature"" seem to be desired by real estate buyers, whereas ""physical activity"" and ""play"" seem not to be desired. We also find support for the second hypothesis: the higher the number of characteristics an urban green space has, the stronger its impact on property prices. This study furthers the discussion on the economic value of urban green spaces by assigning monetary value to their perceived character and use values. In doing so, it highlights the need to understand green spaces both as ecological features and social constructs.","Combining biophysical parameters, spectral indices and multivariate hyperspectral models for estimating yield and water productivity of spring wheat across different agronomic practices.",https://www.ncbi.nlm.nih.gov/pubmed/30840631,PloS one,2019 03 29,"Manipulating plant densities under different irrigation rates can have a significant impact on grain yield and water use efficiency by exerting positive or negative effects on ET. Whereas traditional spectral reflectance indices (SRIs) have been used to assess biophysical parameters and yield, the potential of multivariate models has little been investigated to estimate these parameters under multiple agronomic practices. Therefore, both simple indices and multivariate models (partial least square regression (PLSR) and support vector machines (SVR)) obtained from hyperspectral reflectance data were compared for their applicability for assessing the biophysical parameters in a field experiment involving different combinations of three irrigation rates (1.00, 0.75, and 0.50 ET) and five plant densities (D1: 150, D2: 250, D3: 350, D4: 450, and D5: 550 seeds m-2) in order to improve productivity and water use efficiency of wheat. Results show that the highest values for green leaf area, aboveground biomass, and grain yield were obtained from the combination of D3 or D4 with 1.00 ET, while the combination of 0.75 ET and D3 was the best treatment for achieving the highest values for water use efficiency. Wheat yield response factor (ky) was acceptable when the 0.75 ET was combined with D2, D3, or D4 or when the 0.50 ET was combined with D2 or D3, as the ky values of these combinations were less than or around one. The production function indicated that about 75% grain yield variation could be attributed to the variation in seasonal ET. Results also show that the performance of the SRIs fluctuated when regressions were analyzed for each irrigation rate or plant density specifically, or when the data of all irrigation rates or plant densities were combined. Most of the SRIs failed to assess biophysical parameters under specific irrigation rates and some specific plant densities, but performance improved substantially for combined data of irrigation rates and some specific plant densities. PLSR and SVR produced more accurate estimations of biophysical parameters than SRIs under specific irrigation rates and plant densities. In conclusion, hyperspectral data are useful for predicting and monitoring yield and water productivity of spring wheat across multiple agronomic practices.",Utilization patterns of insulin for patients with type 2 diabetes from national health insurance claims data in South Korea.,https://www.ncbi.nlm.nih.gov/pubmed/30840630,PloS one,2019 03 29,"Type 2 diabetes mellitus (T2DM) is a chronic disease that requires long-term therapy and regular check-ups to prevent complications. In this study, insurance claim data from the National Health Insurance Service (NHIS) of Korea were used to investigate insulin use in T2DM patients according to the economic status of patients and their access to primary physicians, operationally defined as the frequently used medical care providers at the time of T2DM diagnosis. A total of 91,810 participants were included from the NHIS claims database for the period between 2002 and 2013. The utilization pattern of insulin was set as the dependent variable and classified as one of the following: non-use of antidiabetic drugs, use of oral antidiabetic drugs only, or use of insulin with or without oral antidiabetic drugs. The main independent variables of interest were level of income and access to a frequently-visited physician. Multivariate Cox proportional hazards analysis was performed. Insulin was used by 9,281 patients during the study period, while use was 2.874 times more frequent in the Medical-aid group than in the highest premium group [hazard ratio (HR): 2.874, 95% confidence interval (CI): 2.588-3.192]. Insulin was also used ~50% more often in the patients managed by a frequently-visited physician than in those managed by other healthcare professionals (HR: 1.549, 95% CI: 1.434-1.624). The lag time to starting insulin was shorter when the patients had a low income and no frequently-visited physicians. Patients with a low level of income were more likely to use insulin and to have a shorter lag time from diagnosis to starting insulin. The likelihood of insulin being used was higher when the patients had a frequently-visited physician, particularly if they also had a low level of income. Therefore, the economic statuses of patients should be considered to ensure effective management of T2DM. Utilizing frequently-visited physicians might improve the management of T2DM, particularly for patients with a low income.",Modern botanical analogue of endangered Yak (Bos mutus) dung from India: Plausible linkage with extant and extinct megaherbivores.,https://www.ncbi.nlm.nih.gov/pubmed/30840629,PloS one,2019 03 29,"The study reports the micro- and macrobotanical remains on wild Yak dung, providing evidence for understanding the diet, habitat, and ecology of extant and extinct megaherbivores. Grasses are the primary diet of the yak as indicated by the abundance of grass pollen and phytoliths. Other associated non-arboreal and arboreal taxa namely, Cyperacaeae, Rosaceae, Chenopodiaceae, Artemisia, Prunus, and Rhododendron are also important dietary plants for their living. The observation of plant macrobotanical remains especially the vegetative part and seeds of the grasses and Cyperaceae is also in agreement with the palynodata. The documented micro- and macrobotanical data are indicative of both Alpine meadow and steppe vegetation under cold and dry climate which exactly reflected the current vegetation composition and climate in the region. The recovery of Botryococcus, Arcella, and diatom was observed in trace amounts in the palynoassemblage which would have been incorporated in the dung through the ingestion of water and are indicative of the presence of perennial water system in the region. Energy dispersive spectroscopy analysis marked that the element contained in dung samples has variation in relation to the summer and winter, which might be due to the availability of the food plants and vegetation. This generated multiproxy data serves as a strong supplementary data for modern pollen and vegetation relationships based on surface soil samples in the region. The recorded multiproxy data could also be useful to interpret the relationship between the coprolites of herbivorous fauna and the palaeodietary, the palaeoecology in the region, and to correlate with other mega herbivores in a global context.","A paper-based, cell-free biosensor system for the detection of heavy metals and date rape drugs.",https://www.ncbi.nlm.nih.gov/pubmed/30840628,PloS one,2019 03 29,"Biosensors have emerged as a valuable tool with high specificity and sensitivity for fast and reliable detection of hazardous substances in drinking water. Numerous substances have been addressed using synthetic biology approaches. However, many proposed biosensors are based on living, genetically modified organisms and are therefore limited in shelf life, usability and biosafety. We addressed these issues by the construction of an extensible, cell-free biosensor. Storage is possible through freeze drying on paper. Following the addition of an aqueous sample, a highly efficient cell-free protein synthesis (CFPS) reaction is initiated. Specific allosteric transcription factors modulate the expression of 'superfolder' green fluorescent protein (sfGFP) depending on the presence of the substance of interest. The resulting fluorescence intensities are analyzed with a conventional smartphone accompanied by simple and cheap light filters. An ordinary differential equitation (ODE) model of the biosensors was developed, which enabled prediction and optimization of performance. With an optimized cell-free biosensor based on the Shigella flexneri MerR transcriptional activator, detection of 6 μg/L Hg(II) ions in water was achieved. Furthermore, a completely new biosensor for the detection of gamma-hydroxybutyrate (GHB), a substance used as date-rape drug, was established by employing the naturally occurring transcriptional repressor BlcR from Agrobacterium tumefaciens.",Mysteries in embryonic development: How can errors arise so frequently at the beginning of mammalian life?,https://www.ncbi.nlm.nih.gov/pubmed/30840627,PLoS biology,2019 04 02,"Chromosome segregation errors occur frequently during female meiosis but also in the first mitoses of mammalian preimplantation development.

This retrospective cohort study included 1,434 adult patients (aged ≥18 years) who were admitted to the emergency department of a university hospital during 2013-2015 because of community-acquired pneumonia. Viral infections were diagnosed by multiplex PCR. Patients diagnosed with non-viral community-acquired pneumonia were included in the control group (N = 1,173). The main outcome was 30-day all-cause mortality. multivariate Cox regression analyses were performed to calculate the risk of death. Respiratory viruses were detected in 261 (18.2%) patients with community-acquired pneumonia. Two types of respiratory viruses were detected in 7 cases. Of the 254 cases detected with only one virus, 62 were influenza A, 18 were influenza B, 65 were rhinovirus, 35 were respiratory syncytial virus, 25 were metapneumovirus, 20 were parainfluenza, 17 were coronavirus, 7 were bocavirus, and 5 were adenovirus. Mortality was not significantly different between patients with respiratory virus and those without respiratory virus; the 30-day all-cause mortality rates were 20.3% and 22.4%, respectively (P = 0.45). Mortality rate increased with an increasing PSI score with or without respiratory viral infection. Pulmonary severity index was significantly associated with mortality adjusted for respiratory virus detection (hazard ratio = 1.024, 95% confidence interval = 1.020-1.028). Pneumonia severity index score is an important factor for assessing the prognosis of patients with community-acquired pneumonia, regardless of respiratory virus detection.","Bioconversion of fructus sophorae into 5,7,8,4'-tetrahydroxyis oflavone with Aspergillus aculeatus.",https://www.ncbi.nlm.nih.gov/pubmed/30840625,PloS one,2019 03 29,"A fungus identified as Aspergillus aculeatus was used to biotransform genistein and glycosides to polyhydroxylated isoflavones.

The chemical structure of the product was identified by high performance liquid chromatography(HPLC), liquid chromatography-mass spectrometry(LC/MS), Infrared spectroscopy (IR) and NMR spectrometer methods. The ITS rDNA sequence of the strain had 100% similarity with Aspergillus. Furthermore, it was ultimately identified as Aspergillus aculeatus. The metabolite of genistein and glycosides was identified as 5,7,8,4'-tetrahydroxyisoflavone. 120 mg 5,7,8,4'-tetrahydroxyisoflavone was made from 20 g fructus sophorae, which was bioconverted unconditionally by Aspergillus aculeatus for 96 h, and the purity was 96%. On the basis of the findings, Aspergillus aculeatus was a novel strain with specific ability to convert genistein and glycosides into 5,7,8,4'-tetrahydroxyisoflavone which had potential applications."

Half of cases are due to complete loss of an X chromosome, while the remainder are due to other alterations of the X chromosome that disrupt genes necessary for normal physical and sexual development. The SHOX gene, located at Xp22.33, is essential for the growth and maturation of bone, while genes on Xq are important for ovarian function. Thus, loss of an X chromosome results in phenotypic short stature and amenorrhea typically seen in Turner syndrome. We present a unique case of Turner syndrome in a 16-year-old girl with primary amenorrhea and above-average height, in which karyotype revealed a derivative X chromosome resulting in partial Xp trisomy and partial Xq monosomy [46,X,der(X)(pter->q21.2::p11.23->pter)]. We hypothesize this unique karyotype explains the atypical phenotypic presentation of this patient.","Molecular Cytogenetic Characterization of a Case of a Myelodysplastic/Myeloproliferative Neoplasm, Chronic Myelomonocytic Leukemia-1 (CMML-1) with Abnormal Karyotype with an Apparent Monosomy 7 Resulting in Rearrangements Involving Chromosomes 7 and 21.",https://www.ncbi.nlm.nih.gov/pubmed/30840601,Journal of the Association of Genetic Technologists,2019 03 06,"We report the case of a 69-year-old male with peripheral blood findings of persistent anemia, mild absolute monocytosis with mild dysgranulopoiesis, rare circulating blasts, and mild thrombocytopenia. Bone marrow biopsy revealed hypercellular bone marrow (60%) with 3.4% blasts and mild dysgranulopoiesis, morphologically characteristic of myelodysplastic/myeloproliferative neoplasm, chronic myelomonocytic leukemia-1 (CMML-1). Chromosome analysis revealed an abnormal karyotype with an apparent monosomy 7 and the presence of one marker chromosome. FISH analysis of metaphases from destained G-banded slides revealed translocation of D7S486 to a derivative chromosome 21, and two copies of RUNX1 located on an isoderivative chromosome 7.

It is characterized by genetic and epigenetic aberrations. The most remarkable mechanisms involved in epigenetic abnormalities are DNA methylation and acetylation. Methylation of CpG islands in promoter regions and acetylation of lysine residues regulate gene expression. Several studies have shown that patients with B-ALL show aberrant DNA methylation in a genome-wide scale. Histone deacetylases (HDAC) regulate gene expression by removing acetyl groups from lysine residues and histone acetyltransferase (HAT) adds acetyl groups. A hematologic malignancy like B-ALL may be very sensitive to small-molecule inhibitors that target these epigenetic mechanisms and therefore may induce expression of pro-apoptotic factors. Thus, HDAC inhibitors (HDACi), DNA methyltransferase inhibitors (DNMTi) and histone acetyltransferase inhibitors (HATi) have been developed as therapies. The objective of this review is to summarize the different epigenetic mechanisms involved in B-ALL.",A resummed thermodynamic perturbation theory for positive and negative hydrogen bond cooperativity in water.,https://www.ncbi.nlm.nih.gov/pubmed/30840599,Journal of physics. Condensed matter : an Institute of Physics journal,2019 03 13,"In this paper a resummed thermodynamic perturbation theory is developed which accounts for both positive and negative hydrogen bond cooperativity in water. The theory is developed in Wertheim's multi-density statistical mechanics. We demonstrate that the hydrogen bonded structure of water is controlled by positive hydrogen bond cooperativity in homodromic hydrogen bonded clusters. Inclusion of negative anti-cooperativity in antidromic hydrogen bonded structures has little effect on the underlying hydrogen bond structure of liquid water. The resummed perturbation theory is shown to give hydrogen bond statistics consistent with first principles ab initio molecular dynamics simulations. In addition, the theory is shown to be in good agreement with experiment in the prediction of the average number of hydrogen bonds per water molecule in a liquid at ambient conditions. Finally, we develop a full thermodynamic model for water by including contributions to the free energy for isotropic square well attractions. We demonstrate that the model gives good representation of saturated liquid density, hydrogen bonding and vapor pressure. In addition, we show the full model predicts the anomalous minima in isothermal compressibility and isobaric heat capacity.",netprioR: a probabilistic model for integrative hit prioritisation of genetic screens.,https://www.ncbi.nlm.nih.gov/pubmed/30840598,Statistical applications in genetics and molecular biology,2019 05 11,"In the post-genomic era of big data in biology, computational approaches to integrate multiple heterogeneous data sets become increasingly important. Despite the availability of large amounts of omics data, the prioritisation of genes relevant for a specific functional pathway based on genetic screening experiments, remains a challenging task. Here, we introduce netprioR, a probabilistic generative model for semi-supervised integrative prioritisation of hit genes. The model integrates multiple network data sets representing gene-gene similarities and prior knowledge about gene functions from the literature with gene-based covariates, such as phenotypes measured in genetic perturbation screens, for example, by RNA interference or CRISPR/Cas9. We evaluate netprioR on simulated data and show that the model outperforms current state-of-the-art methods in many scenarios and is on par otherwise. In an application to real biological data, we integrate 22 network data sets, 1784 prior knowledge class labels and 3840 RNA interference phenotypes in order to prioritise novel regulators of Notch signalling in Drosophila melanogaster. The biological relevance of our predictions is evaluated using in silico and in vivo experiments.

Because of this defect, damaged mitochondria are not removed correctly, and their decomposing components accumulate inside the cells. Dysfunctional mitochondria that are not removed by mitophagy produce high amounts of reactive oxygen species (ROS) and, thus, cause oxidative stress. Oxidative stress, in turn, is very harmful for the cells, neuronal cells, in particular. Consequently, the process of mitophagy plays a crucial role in mitochondria-related disease. Mitochondrial dysfunctions and oxidative stress are well-established factors contributing to Parkinson's disease (PD), one of the most common neurodegenerative disorders. In this review, we report various known antioxidants for PD treatments and describe the stimulation of mitophagy process as a novel and exciting method for reducing oxidative stress in PD patients. We describe the different mechanisms responsible for mitochondria removal through the mitophagy process. In addition, we review the functional connection between mitophagy induction and reduction of oxidative stress in several in vitro models of PD and also agents (drugs and natural compounds) already known to be antioxidants and to be able to activate mitophagy. Finally, we propose that there is an urgent need to test the use of mitophagy-inducing antioxidants in order to fight PD."

Despite this, few studies investigated the implementation of TPMT testing and the combined evaluation of genotype and phenotype in multidisciplinary clinical settings where patients are undergoing chronic therapy with AZA. Methods A total of 356 AZA-treated patients for chronic autoimmune diseases were enrolled. DNA was isolated from whole blood and the samples were analyzed for the c.460G>A and c.719A>G variants by the restriction fragment length polymorphism (RFLP) technique and sequenced for the c.238G>C variant. The TPMT enzyme activity was determined in erythrocytes by a high-performance liquid chromatography (HPLC) assay. Results All the patients enrolled were genotyped while the TPMT enzyme activity was assessed in 41 patients. Clinical information was available on 181 patients. We found no significant difference in the odds of having adverse drug reactions (ADRs) in wild-type patients and variant allele carriers, but the latter had an extra risk of experiencing hematologically adverse events. The enzyme activity was significantly associated to genotype. Conclusions TPMT variant allele carriers have an extra risk of experiencing hematologically adverse events compared to wild-type patients. Interestingly, only two out of 30 (6.6%) patients had discordant results between genotype, phenotype and onset of ADRs.",Enhanced anti-cancer activity by menthol in HepG2 cells exposed to paclitaxel and vincristine: possible involvement of CYP3A4 downregulation.,https://www.ncbi.nlm.nih.gov/pubmed/30840584,Drug metabolism and personalized therapy,2019 04 17,"Background Menthol is widely used as a constituent of functional foods and chemical drugs. In the present study, we investigated changes in the expression of cytochrome P450 isoform CYP3A4mRNA after treating human hepatocellular carcinoma HepG2 cells with menthol. We also examined the effects of pretreatment with menthol on the cytotoxic activity of paclitaxel (PAC) and vincristine (VIN), which are substrates of CYP3A4, in the cells. Methods HepG2 cells were maintained in Dulbecco's Modified Eagle's Medium. Expression of CYP3A4 was examined by the real-time polymerase chain reaction. Survival rate of HepG2 cells was evaluated by the MTT assay. Results The gene expression level of CYP3A4 in HepG2 cells was significantly reduced by treatment with menthol for 1 day. The viability of HepG2 cells was not affected by treatment with menthol alone once a day for two consecutive days. The degree of reduction in cell viability by PAC or VIN in HepG2 cells was significantly increased by menthol treatment for 24 h prior to exposure to these anti-cancer drugs. Conclusions These results demonstrate that menthol enhanced the anti-tumor effects of PAC and VIN through the downregulation of CYP3A4 in HepG2 cells without exerting cytotoxic activity.",Ambient temperature and prevalence of diabetes and insulin resistance in the Spanish population: Di@bet.es study.,https://www.ncbi.nlm.nih.gov/pubmed/30840583,European journal of endocrinology,2019 05 07,"Objective The activity of brown adipose tissue is sensitive to changes in ambient temperature. A lower exposure to cold could result in an increased risk of developing diabetes at population level, although this factor has not yet been sufficiently studied.

All subjects underwent a clinical, demographic and lifestyle survey, a physical examination and blood sampling (75 g oral glucose tolerance test). Insulin resistance was estimated with the homeostasis model assessment (HOMA-IR). The mean annual temperature (°C) in each individual municipality was collected from the Spanish National Meteorology Agency. Results Linear regression analysis showed a significant positive association between mean annual temperature and fasting plasma glucose (β: 0.087, P < 0.001), 2 h plasma glucose (β: 0.049, P = 0.008) and HOMA-IR (β: 0.046, P = 0.008) in multivariate adjusted models.

Methods We analyzed data from 73 517 women, mostly teachers, from the E3N cohort study followed for 22 years (1992-2014), to study the association between mentally tiring work, used as a proxy of job demands, and type 2 diabetes risk. Univariate and multivariable Cox regression models were used to estimate hazard ratios and 95% confidence intervals. Results A total of 4187 incident cases of type 2 diabetes cases were observed. There was a higher type 2 diabetes risk for women with a 'Very mentally tiring work' when compared to women with 'Little or not mentally tiring work' (HR = 1.21 (1.09-1.35)). This association was independent of unhealthy lifestyle and traditional metabolic factors. An interaction between mentally tiring work and BMI was detected (P < 0.0001), with a stronger association being observed in non-overweight women, HR = 1.26 (1.08-1.47) vs HR = 1.14 (0.98, 1.32), in overweight women. Conclusions We observed an increased risk of type 2 diabetes associated with mentally tiring work, used as a proxy of job demands. These observational results suggest the importance of taking into consideration the potential long-term metabolic impact of work-related stress for women working in a demanding environment.

Fifty-six patients were retrospectively analyzed in two experimental groups: signal (-) group (n=41) and signal (+) group (n=15). JOA scores, Borden values, Cobb angles, disc space heights, and adjacent disc space heights of the cervical spine were measured to evaluate the neurological functional recovery rate. The effective rate in the spinal cord signal (-)/(+) group was 95.1%/86.7% and the excellent (or good) rate was 85.4% (or 20.0%). A rank-sum test revealed a significant difference between the JOA score improvement rates of the signal (+) and signal (-) groups. Analyses of variance showed that the Borden values and Cobb angles, but not the disc space heights and inter-vertebral space heights, collected at these four time points were statistically different. The signal (-) group improvement rate was higher than that of the signal (+) group despite the fact that posterior cervical decompression laminectomy with fixation effectively improved the overall neurological functions in all MCSM patients.

This single surgeon study presents the postoperative results of the initial 200 cases after implementing the direct anterior approach (DAA) compared with the initial 200 cases after implementing a 24 hours time- based fast-track program using identical technique by the same surgeon. The effect of the learning curve has been described in operative parameters, overall complications and radiological component placement. The complication rate of the initial 100 cases after commencing with the direct anterior operation technique was high and declined thereafter. After implementing a new time-based fast-tack program with identical DAA-THA technique we found from the outset unchanged low complication and revision rates. The learning phase in performing the direct anterior hip replacement is rather long but the incidence of complications decreases with greater surgeon experience and does not increase after implementing a new time-based fast-track program.

Former notions of anonymity and privacy are now infeasible as a result of massive information sharing through electronic media. The clinical repercussions of these changes are being extensively debated, but issues involving patient privacy and anonymity have not been sufficiently explored. Although several aspects of the impact of the internet on therapeutic setting-such as the need for psychotherapists to exercise caution when making personal information available online-have been addressed in the literature, there has been comparatively little discussion on psychotherapists seeking information about their patients on the internet, a phenomenon known as ""patient-targeted googling"" (PTG).",Borderline Personality Disorder: Clinical Guidelines for Treatment.,https://www.ncbi.nlm.nih.gov/pubmed/30840560,Psychodynamic psychiatry,2019 04 09,"Borderline personality disorder (BPD) is fundamentally a syndrome composed of symptoms (primarily of emotional dysregulation) and a number of true personality traits (such as inordinate anger, impulsivity, and a tendency to stress-related paranoid ideation). Whereas schizotypal personality disorder, with its cognitive peculiarities (ideas of reference, odd beliefs, eccentric speech), is closely linked as a genetic condition-""borderline"" to the major condition schizophrenia-BPD is less closely linked to bipolar disorder. Some cases of BPD are linked genetically to and are in the ""border"" of bipolar disorder. But the condition can also arise from adverse post-natal factors: parental cruelty or neglect, or incest. In some BPD patients, both are present: risk genes for bipolar disorder and adverse conditions within the family. The genetic risk is often overlooked. To avoid this, initial evaluations should always include a careful and extensive family history for mood disorders, and should extend out to grandparents, aunts, uncles, and cousins. Where the history suggests a genetic link to bipolar disorder, a mood stabilizer such as lithium or lamotrigine, even in modest doses, may be particularly beneficial, more so than conventional antidepressants. In some patients, ADHD was present in childhood, BPD was diagnosed during or after puberty, and a form of bipolar disorder becomes apparent during their 20s. As for the psychotherapeutic component, the patient's cognitive style and capacity for introspection will help determine whether a primarily expressive (psychoanalytically oriented) technique is preferable or a primarily cognitive-behavioral technique. Flexibility is necessary, since during emotional crises, supportive and limit-setting interventions will be needed, along with psychotropic medications, and where necessary, programs to help combat substance abuse (which is common among patients with BPD).",Sustained Reduction in Health Care Service Usage after Adjunctive Treatment of Intensive Short-Term Dynamic Psychotherapy in Patients with Bipolar Disorder.,https://www.ncbi.nlm.nih.gov/pubmed/30840559,Psychodynamic psychiatry,2019 04 09,"The aim of this study was to evaluate changes in long-term health care costs and symptom severity after adjunctive intensive short-term dynamic psychotherapy (ISTDP) individually tailored and administered to patients with bipolar disorder undergoing standard psychiatric care. Eleven therapists with different levels of expertise delivered an average of 4.6 one-hour sessions of ISTDP to 29 patients with bipolar disorders. Health care service costs were compiled for a one-year period prior to the start of ISTDP along with four one-year periods after termination. Two validated self-report scales, the Brief Symptom Inventory and the Inventory of Interpersonal Problems, were administered at intake and termination of ISTDP. Hospital cost reductions were significant for the one-year post-treatment period relative to baseline year, and all cost reductions were sustained for the follow-up period of four post-treatment years. Self-reported psychiatric symptoms and interpersonal problems were significantly reduced. These preliminary findings suggest that this brief adjunctive psychotherapy may be beneficial and cost-effective in select patients with bipolar disorders, and that gains may be sustained in long-term followup.

Research on affective, cognitive, mnemic, somatic, psychophysiologic, developmental, and integrative mental processes, amongst others, must hold to a high standard of translation from basic scientific findings or we risk practicing a psychotherapy enslaved to an authoritarian scientism as a substitute for the creation of unfettered intimacy and engagement. A balanced approach is required if in trauma treatment, for example, we are to be both potential beneficiaries of understanding what is in our human heads while not losing track of our very human hearts. Each clinician need develop a basic knowledge of neuroscience in order to critically assess the meanings of new findings and their proper place in the practice of all the psychotherapies.",Freud's Clinical Theories Then and Now.,https://www.ncbi.nlm.nih.gov/pubmed/30840557,Psychodynamic psychiatry,2019 04 09,"In Freud's day, his case studies, coupled with the findings of others (e.g., Breuer, Charcot), provided evidence that the Oedipus complex and his dynamic theory of repression (i.e., the unconscious interactions between id, ego, and superego) as causal agents in neurotic symptoms was suspect. With the aid of over 75 years of research since Freud's death, today's psychodynamic-orientated clinicians have discarded many of Freud's tenets related to the Oedipus complex. Modern psychoanalysts have focused their attention instead on a patient's personal relationships in their early life, their current life, and in their interactions with their therapist (transference).",The Price of Needing to Belong: Neurobiology of Working Through Attachment Trauma.,https://www.ncbi.nlm.nih.gov/pubmed/30840555,Psychodynamic psychiatry,2019 04 09,"Belonging is fundamental to health and well-being. Complex relational trauma disrupts attachments, negatively impacting developing neurobiology and has significant implications for attachment behaviors, mental health, and treatment planning. We have developed a dynamic relational (DR) model of psychotherapy that aims to restore a healthy sense of belonging, targeting levels of activation and integration of large scale neural networks in the service of increasing the emotional capacities (attunement, processing, regulation, and expression) required to work through attachment trauma and establish healthy relationships. Our DR model provides an organizing framework through which to understand both the phenomenology observed in complex trauma and the mechanisms of therapeutic change. Our approach informs the weighting and timing of interventions to actively address capacity deficits, ego-syntonic symptoms, and unconscious resistance. The implications of this model also relate to the pathogenesis of mental disorder, and suggest prevention and early intervention efforts focus on modulation of subcortical (autonomic) responses and the encouragement of balanced cortical integration to enhance cognitive flexibility/psychological resilience. Ultimately, interventions based on our systematic model may modulate the genetic diathesis and comorbidities of relational trauma and increase psychological resilience.",PP2A-B55/SUR-6 collaborates with the nuclear lamina for centrosome separation during mitotic entry.,https://www.ncbi.nlm.nih.gov/pubmed/30840554,Molecular biology of the cell,2019 05 15,"Across most sexually reproducing animals, centrosomes are provided to the oocyte through fertilization and must be positioned properly to establish the zygotic mitotic spindle. How centrosomes are positioned in space and time through the concerted action of key mitotic entry biochemical regulators, including protein phosphatase 2A (PP2A-B55/SUR-6), biophysical regulators, including dynein, and the nuclear lamina is unclear. Here, we uncover a role for PP2A-B55/SUR-6 in regulating centrosome separation. Mechanistically, PP2A-B55/SUR-6 regulates nuclear size before mitotic entry, in turn affecting nuclear envelope-based dynein density and motor capacity. Computational simulations predicted the requirement of PP2A-B55/SUR-6 regulation of nuclear size and nuclear-envelope dynein density for proper centrosome separation. Conversely, compromising nuclear lamina integrity led to centrosome detachment from the nuclear envelope and migration defects. Removal of PP2A-B55/SUR-6 and the nuclear lamina simultaneously further disrupted centrosome separation, leading to unseparated centrosome pairs dissociated from the nuclear envelope. Taking these combined results into consideration, we propose a model in which centrosomes migrate and are positioned through the concerted action of PP2A-B55/SUR-6-regulated nuclear envelope-based dynein pulling forces and centrosome-nuclear envelope tethering. Our results add critical precision to models of centrosome separation relative to the nucleus during spindle formation in cell division.",Both fast and slow learning processes contribute to savings following sensorimotor adaptation.,https://www.ncbi.nlm.nih.gov/pubmed/30840553,Journal of neurophysiology,2019 05 01,"Recent work suggests that the rate of learning in sensorimotor adaptation is likely not fixed, but rather can change based on previous experience. One example is savings, a commonly observed phenomenon whereby the relearning of a motor skill is faster than the initial learning. Sensorimotor adaptation is thought to be driven by sensory prediction errors, which are the result of a mismatch between predicted and actual sensory consequences. It has been proposed that during motor adaptation the generation of sensory prediction errors engages two processes (fast and slow) that differ in learning and retention rates. We tested the idea that a history of errors would influence both the fast and slow processes during savings. Participants were asked to perform the same force field adaptation task twice in succession. We found that adaptation to the force field a second time led to increases in estimated learning rates for both fast and slow processes. While it has been proposed that savings is explained by an increase in learning rate for the fast process, here we observed that the slow process also contributes to savings. Our work suggests that fast and slow adaptation processes are both responsive to a history of error and both contribute to savings. NEW & NOTEWORTHY We studied the underlying mechanisms of savings during motor adaptation. Using a two-state model to represent fast and slow processes that contribute to motor adaptation, we found that a history of error modulates performance in both processes. While previous research has attributed savings to only changes in the fast process, we demonstrated that an increase in both processes is needed to account for the measured behavioral data.","Evaluation of TLC-NOSF dressing with poly-absorbent fibres in exuding leg ulcers: two multicentric, single-arm, prospective, open-label clinical trials.",https://www.ncbi.nlm.nih.gov/pubmed/30840551,Journal of wound care,2019 05 13,"To assess the efficacy, safety and acceptability of a new TLC-NOSF dressing with poly-absorbent fibres in the management of exuding leg ulcers, at the different stages of healing.",TIME CDST: an updated tool to address the current challenges in wound care.,https://www.ncbi.nlm.nih.gov/pubmed/30840549,Journal of wound care,2019 05 13,"Despite the understanding that wounds are a common problem affecting the individual, the health service and society as a whole, there continues to be a lack of a systematic, structured, evidence-based approach to wound management. The TIME principle was first published in 2003, 1 and has since been integrated by many into clinical practice and research. However, this tool has been criticised for its tendency to focus mainly on the wound rather than on the wider issues that the patient is presenting with. At an expert meeting held in London in 2018, this conundrum was addressed and the TIME clinical decision support tool (CDST) was elaborated upon. This article introduces the TIME CDST, explains why it is required and describes how its use is likely to benefit patients, clinicians and health-service organisations. It also explores the framework in detail, and shows why this simple and accessible framework is robust enough to facilitate consistency in the delivery of wound care and better patient outcomes. Finally, it outlines the next steps for the rollout, use and evaluation of the impact of the TIME CDST."

The mechanism through which Bcl-xL is recruited to the MOM has not been fully discerned. The retromer is a conserved endosomal scaffold complex involved in membrane trafficking. Here we identify VPS35 and VPS26, two core components of the retromer, as novel regulators of Bcl-xL. We observed interactions and colocalization between Bcl-xL, VPS35, VPS26, and MICAL-L1, a protein involved in recycling endosome biogenesis that also interacts with the retromer. We also found that upon VPS35 depletion, levels of nonmitochondrial Bcl-xL were increased. In addition, retromer-depleted cells displayed more rapid Bax activation and apoptosis. These results suggest that the retromer regulates apoptosis by facilitating Bcl-xL's transport to the MOM. Importantly, our studies suggest a previously uncharacterized relationship between the machineries of cell death/survival and endosomal trafficking.",Motion integration is anisotropic during smooth pursuit eye movements.,https://www.ncbi.nlm.nih.gov/pubmed/30840536,Journal of neurophysiology,2019 04 30,"Smooth pursuit eye movements (pursuit) are used to minimize the retinal motion of moving objects. During pursuit, the pattern of motion on the retina carries not only information about the object movement but also reafferent information about the eye movement itself. The latter arises from the retinal flow of the stationary world in the direction opposite to the eye movement. To extract the global direction of motion of the tracked object and stationary world, the visual system needs to integrate ambiguous local motion measurements (i.e., the aperture problem). Unlike the tracked object, the stationary world's global motion is entirely determined by the eye movement and thus can be approximately derived from motor commands sent to the eye (i.e., from an efference copy). Because retinal motion opposite to the eye movement is dominant during pursuit, different motion integration mechanisms might be used for retinal motion in the same direction and opposite to pursuit. To investigate motion integration during pursuit, we tested direction discrimination of a brief change in global object motion. The global motion stimulus was a circular array of small static apertures within which one-dimensional gratings moved. We found increased coherence thresholds and a qualitatively different reflexive ocular tracking for global motion opposite to pursuit. Both effects suggest reduced sampling of motion opposite to pursuit, which results in an impaired ability to extract coherence in motion signals in the reafferent direction. We suggest that anisotropic motion integration is an adaptation to asymmetric retinal motion patterns experienced during pursuit eye movements. NEW & NOTEWORTHY This study provides a new understanding of how the visual system achieves coherent perception of an object's motion while the eyes themselves are moving. The visual system integrates local motion measurements to create a coherent percept of object motion. An analysis of perceptual judgments and reflexive eye movements to a brief change in an object's global motion confirms that the visual and oculomotor systems pick fewer samples to extract global motion opposite to the eye movement.",No temporal contrast enhancement of simple decreases in noxious heat.,https://www.ncbi.nlm.nih.gov/pubmed/30840535,Journal of neurophysiology,2019 04 30,"Offset analgesia (OA) studies have found that small decreases in the intensity of a tonic noxious heat stimulus yield a disproportionately large amount of pain relief. In the classic OA paradigm, the decrease in stimulus intensity is preceded by an increase of equal size from an initial noxious level. Although the majority of researchers believe this temporal sequence of two changes is important for eliciting OA, it has also been suggested that the temporal contrast mechanism underlying OA may enhance detection of simple, isolated decreases in noxious heat. To test whether decreases in noxious heat intensity, by themselves, are perceived better than increases of comparable sizes, we used an adaptive two-interval alternative forced choice task to find perceptual thresholds for increases and decreases in radiant and contact heat. Decreases in noxious heat were more difficult to perceive than increases of comparable sizes from the same initial temperature of 45°C. In contrast, decreases and increases were perceived equally well within a common range of noxious temperatures (i.e., when increases started from 45°C and decreases started from 47°C). In another task, participants rated the pain intensity of heat stimuli that randomly and unpredictably increased, decreased, or remained constant. Ratings of unpredictable stimulus decreases also showed no evidence of perceptual enhancement. Our results demonstrate that there is no temporal contrast enhancement of simple, isolated decreases in noxious heat intensity. Combined with previous OA findings, they suggest that long-lasting noxious stimuli that follow an increase-decrease pattern may be important for eliciting the OA effect. NEW & NOTEWORTHY Previous research suggested that a small decrease in noxious heat intensity feels surprisingly large because of sensory enhancement of noxious stimulus offsets (a simplified form of ""offset analgesia""). Using a two-alternative forced choice task where participants detected simple increases or decreases in noxious heat, we showed that decreases in noxious heat, by themselves, are no better perceived than increases of comparable sizes. This suggests that a decrease alone is not sufficient to elicit offset analgesia.",Thrombosis after sclerotherapy and poorly applied bandaging for venous leg ulcers: case reports.,https://www.ncbi.nlm.nih.gov/pubmed/30840534,Journal of wound care,2019 05 20,"Side-effects occurring in patients treated by multilayer bandaging may be neurological, dermatological or arterial. We report on two cases of venous thrombosis involving outpatients treated for venous leg ulcers (VLU). In the first case, a lack of understanding of multilayer bandages and training on their use by the nursing staff was likely the cause of a superficial vein thrombosis (SVT) in a great saphenous vein tributary. The second case occurred in a patient suffering from an ulcer complicated by oedema. Insufficient education of the patient in alert symptoms for his condition and an inappropriate medical follow-up were the direct causes of a non-severe distal vein thrombosis. We conclude that, as it has been suggested over a number of years, patients being treated with bandage therapy must be rigorously and carefully monitored.",Clinical indicators of wound infection and biofilm: reaching international consensus.,https://www.ncbi.nlm.nih.gov/pubmed/30840533,Journal of wound care,2019 05 20,"To achieve international consensus relating to clinical indicators for a chronic wound, wound infection and biofilm presence to inform the development of international clinical guidance for assessing and managing wound infection.",The protective effect of Lactobacillus plantarum against meticillin-resistant Staphylococcus aureus infections: an experimental animal model.,https://www.ncbi.nlm.nih.gov/pubmed/30840532,Journal of wound care,2019 05 20,To determine and quantitatively measure the protective and/or therapeutic effect of Lactobacillus plantarum (LP) application on a burn wound before and after the onset of meticillin-resistant Staphylococcus aureus (MRSA) infection.,Maintaining Breastfeeding During Severe Infant and Maternal HSV-1 Infection: A Case Report.,https://www.ncbi.nlm.nih.gov/pubmed/30840531,Journal of human lactation : official journal of International Lactation Consultant Association,2019 03 08,"Childbearing women with primary or secondary Herpes Simplex Virus type 1 infection are at risk of transmitting neonatal herpes infection to their infants; a medical emergency that is associated with high mortality and morbidity. Neonatal herpes infection has been commonly associated with Herpes Simplex Virus type 2, or genital herpes, but can be caused by either subtype and the presentations are indistinguishable. This case describes the course of diagnosis, treatment, and recovery for a mother and infant during a severe maternal and neonatal herpes infection, and how lactation was maintained and breastfeeding re-established. Our children's hospital coordinated its efforts to assist and monitor this breastfeeding family, and they were able to resume breastfeeding soon after discharge.

In this study, we utilized retrograde transsynaptic transport of the N2c strain of rabies virus injected into the ciliary body of one eye of macaque monkeys to identify premotor neurons that control lens accommodation. We previously used this approach to label a premotor population located in the supraoculomotor area. In the present report, we describe a set of neurons located bilaterally in the central mesencephalic reticular formation that are labeled in the same time frame as the supraoculomotor area population, indicating their premotor character. The labeled premotor neurons are mostly multipolar cells, with long, very sparsely branched dendrites. They form a band that stretches across the core of the midbrain reticular formation. This population appears to be continuous with the premotor near-response neurons located in the supraoculomotor area at the level of the caudal central subdivision of the oculomotor nucleus. The central mesencephalic reticular formation has previously been associated with horizontal saccadic eye movements, so these premotor cells might be involved in controlling lens accommodation during disjunctive saccades. Alternatively, they may represent a population that controls vergence velocity. NEW & NOTEWORTHY This report uses transsynaptic transport of rabies virus to provide new evidence that the central mesencephalic reticular formation (cMRF) contains premotor neurons controlling lens accommodation. When combined with other recent reports that the cMRF also contains premotor neurons supplying medial rectus motoneurons, these results indicate that this portion of the reticular formation plays an important role in directing the near response and disjunctive saccades when viewers look between targets located at different distances.",On the reflex mechanisms of cervical transcutaneous spinal cord stimulation in human subjects.,https://www.ncbi.nlm.nih.gov/pubmed/30840527,Journal of neurophysiology,2019 04 24,"Transcutaneous and epidural electrical spinal cord stimulation techniques are becoming more valuable as electrophysiological and clinical tools. Recently, remarkable recovery of the upper limb sensorimotor function during cervical spinal stimulation was demonstrated. In the present study, we sought to elucidate the neural mechanisms underlying the effects of transcutaneous spinal cord stimulation (tSCS) of the cervical spine. We hypothesized that cervical tSCS can be used to selectively activate the sensory route entering the spinal cord and transsynaptically converge on upper limb motor pools. To test this hypothesis, we applied cervical tSCS using paired stimuli (homosynaptic depression) and during passive muscle stretching of the wrist flexor (presynaptic inhibition via Ia afferents), voluntary hand muscle contraction (descending facilitation of motoneuron pool), and muscle-tendon vibration of the wrist (presynaptic inhibition via afferent occlusion). Our results demonstrate significant inhibition of the second evoked response during paired stimulus delivery, inhibition of responses during passive muscle stretching and muscle-tendon vibration, and facilitation during voluntary muscle contraction, which share similarities with responses evoked during lumbosacral tSCS. These results indicate that the route of the stimulation current transmission passes via afferents in the dorsal roots through the spinal cord to activate the motor pools and potentially interneuronal networks projecting to upper limb muscles. Using a novel stimulation paradigm, our study is the first to present evidence of the sensory neuronal pathway of the cervical tSCS propagation. Overall, our work demonstrates the utility and sensitivity of cervical tSCS to engage the sensory pathway projecting to the upper limbs. NEW & NOTEWORTHY Despite therapeutic effects that have been demonstrated previously using noninvasive cervical spinal stimulation, it has been unclear whether, and to what degree, the stimulation can activate the sensory afferent system. Our study presents evidence that cervical transcutaneous spinal cord stimulation can engage the sensory pathways and transsynaptically converge on motor pools projecting to upper limb muscles, demonstrating the utility and sensitivity of cervical spinal stimulation for electrophysiological assessments and neurorehabilitation.",High-density extracellular probes reveal dendritic backpropagation and facilitate neuron classification.,https://www.ncbi.nlm.nih.gov/pubmed/30840526,Journal of neurophysiology,2019 05 13,"Different neuron types serve distinct roles in neural processing. Extracellular electrical recordings are extensively used to study brain function but are typically blind to cell identity. Morphoelectrical properties of neurons measured on spatially dense electrode arrays have the potential to distinguish neuron types. We used high-density silicon probes to record from cortical and subcortical regions of the mouse brain. Extracellular waveforms of each neuron were detected across many channels and showed distinct spatiotemporal profiles among brain regions. Classification of neurons by brain region was improved with multichannel compared with single-channel waveforms. In visual cortex, unsupervised clustering identified the canonical regular-spiking (RS) and fast-spiking (FS) classes but also indicated a subclass of RS units with unidirectional backpropagating action potentials (BAPs). Moreover, BAPs were observed in many hippocampal RS cells. Overall, waveform analysis of spikes from high-density probes aids neuron identification and can reveal dendritic backpropagation. NEW & NOTEWORTHY It is challenging to identify neuron types with extracellular electrophysiology in vivo. We show that spatiotemporal action potentials measured on high-density electrode arrays can capture cell type-specific morphoelectrical properties, allowing classification of neurons across brain structures and within the cortex. Moreover, backpropagating action potentials are reliably detected in vivo from subpopulations of cortical and hippocampal neurons. Together, these results enhance the utility of dense extracellular electrophysiology for cell-type interrogation of brain network function."

These EVAs were supported by a Mission Support Center (MSC) that included an on-site, colocated Science Support Team (SST). The SST was composed of scientists from a variety of disciplines and operations researchers who provided scientific and technical expertise to the crew while each EVA was being conducted (intra-EVA). SST management and organization developed under operational conditions that included Mars-like communication latencies, bandwidth constraints, and EVA plans that were infused with Mars analog field science objectives. This paper focuses on the SST workspace considerations such as science team roles, physical layout, communication interactions, operational techniques, and work support technology. Over the course of BASALT field deployments to Idaho and Hawai'i, the SST team made several changes of note to increase both productivity and efficiency. For example, new roles were added for more effective management of technical discussions, and the layout of the SST workspace evolved multiple times during the deployments. SST members' reflexive adjustments resulted in a layout that prioritized face-to-face discussions over face-to-data displays, highlighting the importance of interpersonal communication during SST decision-making.

Spectrometers on flyby, orbital, and landed missions are currently used to determine the composition and mineralogy of geological materials of various types and sizes, from small fragments to celestial bodies in the solar system. Handheld spectrometers that are capable of in situ analyses are already used for geological exploration on Earth; however, their usefulness for human exploration missions and how data from multiple handheld instruments could be combined to enhance scientific return must be further evaluated. As part of the Biologic Analog Science Associated with Lava Terrains (BASALT) research project, we incorporated two handheld instruments, a visible-near infrared spectrometer and an X-Ray Fluorescence spectrometer, into simulated Mars exploration missions conducted on basaltic terrains in Idaho and Hawai'i. To understand the data quality provided by these handheld spectrometers, we evaluated their performance under varying conditions of measurement time, distance, angle, atmosphere, and sample matrix, and we compared data quality between handheld instruments and laboratory techniques.

Future crews on Mars will be expected to achieve their science objectives while operating and coordinating with a science team back on Earth under communication latency and bandwidth restrictions. The BASALT (Biologic Analog Science Associated with Lava Terrains) research program conducted Mars analog science on Earth to understand the concept of operations and capabilities needed to support these new kinds of EVAs. A suite of software tools (Minerva) was used for planning and executing all BASALT EVAs, supporting text communication across communication latency, and managing the collection of operational and scientific EVA data.

The results of these operations often create new capabilities for exploration and increase confidence in, and credibility of, emerging technologies, usually at very low cost and risk to the test subjects involved. While these experiments resemble missions 10-30 years into the future, insights obtained are often of immediate value.

The BASALT research program simulated a series of extravehicular activities (EVAs) in Mars analog terrains under various Mars-relevant bandwidth and latency conditions to investigate how best to approach this problem. Here we discuss tactical decision-making under these conditions, that is, how the crew on Mars interacts with a team of scientists and support personnel on Earth to collect samples of maximum scientific interest. We describe the strategies, protocols, and tools tested in BASALT EVAs and give recommendations on how best to conduct human exploration of Mars with support from Earth-based scientists. We find that even with scientists supporting them, the crew performing the exploration must be trained in the appropriate scientific disciplines in order to provide the terrestrial scientists with enough information to make decisions, but that with appropriate planning and structure, and tools such as a ""dynamic leaderboard,"" terrestrial scientists can add scientific value to an EVA, even under Mars communication latency.",A Flexible Telecommunication Architecture for Human Planetary Exploration Based on the BASALT Science-Driven Mars Analog.,https://www.ncbi.nlm.nih.gov/pubmed/30840502,Astrobiology,2019 03 06,"There is a synergistic relationship between analog field testing and the deep space telecommunication capabilities necessary for future human exploration.

Even in the absence of life, the mapping of habitable and uninhabitable environments is an essential task in developing a complete understanding of the geological and aqueous history of Mars and, as a consequence, understanding what factors caused Earth to take a different trajectory of biological potential. We carried out the aseptic collection of samples and comparison of the bacterial and archaeal communities associated with basaltic fumaroles and rocks of varying weathering states in Hawai'i to test four hypotheses concerning the diversity of life in these environments. Using high-throughput sequencing, we found that all these materials are inhabited by a low-diversity biota. Multivariate analyses of bacterial community data showed a clear separation between sites that have active fumaroles and other sites that comprised relict fumaroles, unaltered, and syn-emplacement basalts. Contrary to our hypothesis that high water flow environments, such as fumaroles with active mineral leaching, would be sites of high biological diversity, alpha diversity was lower in active fumaroles compared to relict or nonfumarolic sites, potentially due to high-temperature constraints on microbial diversity in fumarolic sites. A comparison of these data with communities inhabiting unaltered and weathered basaltic rocks in Idaho suggests that bacterial taxon composition of basaltic materials varies between sites, although the archaeal communities were similar in Hawai'i and Idaho. The taxa present in both sites suggest that most of them obtain organic carbon compounds from the atmosphere and from phototrophs and that some of them, including archaeal taxa, cycle fixed nitrogen. The low diversity shows that, on Earth, extreme basaltic terrains are environments on the edge of sustaining life with implications for the biological potential of similar environments on Mars and their exploration by robots and humans.",Strategic Planning Insights for Future Science-Driven Extravehicular Activity on Mars.,https://www.ncbi.nlm.nih.gov/pubmed/30840500,Astrobiology,2019 04 02,"Short-term and long-term science plans were developed as part of the strategic planning process used by the Biologic Analog Science Associated with Lava Terrains (BASALT) science team to conduct two Mars-simulation missions investigating basalt habitability at terrestrial volcanic analog sites in 2016. A multidisciplinary team of scientists generated and codified a range of scientific hypotheses distilled into a Science Traceability Matrix (STM) that defined the set of objectives pursued in a series of extravehicular activity (EVA) campaigns performed across multiple field deployments. This STM was used to guide the pre-deployment selection of sampling stations within the selected Mars analog sites on the Earth based on precursor site information such as multispectral imagery. It also informed selection of hand-held instruments and observational data to collect during EVA to aid sample selection through latency-impacted interaction with an Earth-based Science Support Team. A significant portion of the pre-deployment strategic planning activities were devoted to station selection, ultimately the locations used for sample collection and EVA planning. During development of the EVAs, the BASALT science team identified lessons learned that could be used to inform future missions and analog activities, including the critical need for high-resolution precursor imagery that would enable the selection of stations that could meet the scientific objectives outlined in the STM.",Using Science-Driven Analog Research to Investigate Extravehicular Activity Science Operations Concepts and Capabilities for Human Planetary Exploration.,https://www.ncbi.nlm.nih.gov/pubmed/30840499,Astrobiology,2019 04 02,"Biologic Analog Science Associated with Lava Terrains (BASALT) is a science-driven exploration program seeking to determine the best tools, techniques, training requirements, and execution strategies for conducting Mars-relevant field science under spaceflight mission conditions.

Regulatory, integrative and comparative physiology",2019 05 21,"The glucocorticosteroid betamethasone is routinely administered via maternal intramuscular injection to enhance fetal lung maturation before anticipated preterm birth. Although antenatal betamethasone increases fetal pulmonary arterial (PA) blood flow, whether this agent alters the contribution of 1) right ventricular (RV) output or 2) left-to-right shunting across the ductus arteriosus to rises in PA blood flow after preterm birth is unknown. To address this question, anesthetized control (n = 7) and betamethasone-treated (n = 7) preterm fetal lambs (gestation 127 ± 1 days, means ± SD) were instrumented with aortic, pulmonary, and left atrial catheters as well as ductus arteriosus and left PA flow probes to calculate RV output, with hemodynamics measured for 30 min after cord clamping and mechanical ventilation. Mean PA blood flow was higher in betamethasone-treated than in control lambs over the initial 10 min after birth (P < 0.05). This higher PA flow was accompanied by 1) a greater pulmonary vascular conductance (P ≤ 0.025), 2) a larger proportion of RV output passing to lungs (P ≤ 0.01), despite a fall in this output, and 3) earlier reversal and a greater magnitude (P ≤ 0.025) of net ductal shunting, due to the combination of higher left-to-right (P ≤ 0.025) and lesser right-to-left phasic shunting (P ≤ 0.025). These results suggest that antenatal betamethasone augments the initial rise in PA blood flow after birth in preterm lambs, with this augmented rise supported by the combination of 1) a greater redistribution of RV output toward the lungs and 2) a faster and larger reversal in net ductal shunting underpinned not only by greater left-to-right, but also by lesser right-to-left phasic shunting.",Consumptive coagulopathy is associated with organ dysfunction during PICS.,https://www.ncbi.nlm.nih.gov/pubmed/30840483,American journal of physiology. Lung cellular and molecular physiology,2019 05 10,"Patients who survive the acute phase of sepsis can progress to persistent inflammation, immunosuppression, and catabolism syndrome (PICS). Although sepsis is characterized by early hypercoagulability and delayed hypocoagulability, coagulopathy during chronic critical illness is not fully understood. The objective of this study was to determine whether sepsis-induced PICS is associated with coagulation abnormalities. Using our previously described murine PICS model, outbred mice underwent cecal ligation and puncture, and coagulability was characterized after 8 days. We found that during PICS the spleen became markedly enlarged with increased splenocytes and splenic megakaryocytes without a concomitant increase in circulating platelets. Microscopy revealed a nearly sevenfold increase in pulmonary microvascular thrombi in PICS mice, along with significantly decreased pulmonary tidal volumes and inspiratory times and with significantly increased respiratory rates. Thromboelastometry showed that PICS mice had significantly delayed clot initiation time but increased clot firmness. Finally, PICS mice displayed delayed thrombin production and decreased overall thrombin concentrations. All together, these data demonstrate a general dysregulation of coagulation resulting in microthrombus formation and compromised lung function. On the basis of these findings, we propose that consumptive coagulopathy constitutes another cardinal feature of PICS and may contribute to the ongoing tissue damage and multiple organ failure that can occur in chronic critical illness.",Age-dependent pulmonary reactivity to house dust mite allergen: a model of adult-onset asthma?,https://www.ncbi.nlm.nih.gov/pubmed/30840481,American journal of physiology. Lung cellular and molecular physiology,2019 04 24,"Asthma is a heterogeneous disease differentiated by factors like allergen sensitivity, inflammation, sex, and age at onset. The mouse model is widely used to study the early-life development of allergic asthma. However, age-dependent allergen responses later in life remain relatively understudied and lack a widely accepted model. To differentiate age-dependent responses to the ubiquitous house dust mite (HDM), 3- and 9-mo-old female C57BL/6 mice were randomized into two groups each and exposed to HDM or phosphate-buffered saline (control) via intranasal instillation for sensitization and challenge phases. At 24 h after challenge, all mice underwent pulmonary function testing and methacholine challenge. Bronchoalveolar lavage fluid (BALF) was collected for assessment of cell differentials, and right lung lobes were fixed, sectioned, and stained for histopathology and immunohistochemistry. Both age groups demonstrated strong inflammatory/allergic responses to HDM exposure. However, only 9-mo-old HDM-exposed mice demonstrated significant airway hyperresponsiveness compared with age-matched controls. These HDM-exposed mice also had 1) statistically significant increases in tissue bronchiolitis, perivasculitis, and BALF neutrophilia relative to their younger counterparts and 2) significantly increased extent of immunostaining compared with all other groups. This study presents a potential model for adult-onset asthma, focusing specifically on the atopic, perimenopausal female phenotype. Our findings suggest that lung function declines with age and that the inflammatory profile of this adult subgroup is a mixed, rather than a simple, atopic, Th2 response. This model may enhance our understanding of how age influences the development of asthmic-like symptoms in older subgroups.",Millimeter-Size Pickering Emulsions Stabilized with Janus Microparticles.,https://www.ncbi.nlm.nih.gov/pubmed/30840480,Langmuir : the ACS journal of surfaces and colloids,2019 04 02,"The ability to make stable water-in-oil and oil-in-water millimeter-size Pickering emulsions is demonstrated using Janus particles-particles with distinct surface chemistries. The use of a highly cross-linked hydrophobic polymer network and the excellent water-wetting nature of a hydrogel as the hydrophobic and hydrophilic sides, respectively, permit distinct wettability on the Janus particle. Glass capillary microfluidics allows the synthesis of Janus particles with controlled sizes between 128 and 440 μm and control over the hydrophilic-to-hydrophobic domain volume ratio of the particle from 0.36 to 12.77 for a given size. It is shown that the Janus particle size controls the size of the emulsion drops, thus providing the ability to tune the structure and stability of the resulting emulsions. Stability investigations using centrifugation reveal that particles with the smallest size and a balanced hydrophilic-to-hydrophobic volume ratio (Janus ratio) form emulsions with the greatest stability against coalescence. Particles eventually jam at the interface to form nonspherical droplets. This effect is more pronounced as the hydrogel volume is increased. The large Janus particles permit facile visualization of particle-stabilized emulsions, which result in a better understanding of particle stabilization mechanisms of formed emulsions.",Redox-Annulations of Cyclic Amines with Electron-Deficient o-Tolualdehydes.,https://www.ncbi.nlm.nih.gov/pubmed/30840479,Organic letters,2019 06 03,"Amines such as 1,2,3,4-tetrahydroisoquinoline undergo redox-neutral annulations with 2-methyl-3,5-dinitrobenzaldehyde and closely related substrates.

We developed a local drug delivery system to provide sustained pain relief in patients with AOM, achieved by applying a single dose of a hydrogel formulation onto the tympanic membrane. Successful drug delivery across intact tympanic membranes was demonstrated using the amino-amide anesthetic, bupivacaine, and a highly potent site 1 sodium channel blocker anesthetic, tetrodotoxin. The chemical permeation enhancers incorporated in the delivery system increased the permeability of the tympanic membrane to the anesthetics considerably.

The structural characteristics of the polynucleotide carrier system OO4 mixed with the commonly used co-lipid DOPE and the saturated phospholipid DPPE have been studied in two-dimensional and three-dimensional model systems to understand their influence on the physical-chemical properties. The phase behavior of pure OO4 and its mixtures with DOPE and DPPE was studied at the air-water interface using a Langmuir film balance combined with infrared reflection-absorption spectroscopy. In bulk, the self-assembling structures in the presence and absence of DNA were determined by small-angle and wide-angle X-ray scattering. The amount of adsorbed DNA to cationic lipid bilayers was measured using a quartz crystal microbalance. The choice of the co-lipid has an enormous influence on the structure and capability of binding DNA. DOPE promotes the formation of nonlamellar lipoplexes (cubic and hexagonal structures), whereas DPPE promotes the formation of lamellar lipoplexes. The correlation of the observed structures with the transfection efficiency and serum stability indicates that OO4/DOPE 1:3 lipoplexes with a DNA-containing cubic phase encapsulated in multilamellar structures seem to be most promising.",Direct Access to Acyl Fluorides from Carboxylic Acids Using a Phosphine/Fluoride Deoxyfluorination Reagent System.,https://www.ncbi.nlm.nih.gov/pubmed/30840474,Organic letters,2019 06 05,"A fast and simple method for deoxyfluorination of carboxylic acids is presented.

Here, we applied electrospray-cold ion trap spectroscopy to complexes of a partial binding motif SIVSF of a β2-adrenergic receptor pocket with L- and D-epinephrine AdH+. The ultraviolet spectrum of the SIVSF-AdH+ complex changed drastically when L-AdH+ was replaced by its enantiomer. The isomer-selected infrared spectra revealed that D-AdH+ was bound to SIVSF by its protonated amino-group or a single catechol OH and induced nonhelical secondary structures of SIVSF. This is in sharp contrast to the helical SIVSF complex with L-AdH+, which is close to the natural binding structure with two catechol OHs binding in the receptor. This shows that a short pentapeptide SIVSF can distinguish the chirality of the ligand AdH+ as well as the receptor. This stereoselectivity is suggested to arise from an additional interaction involving the hydroxyl group on the chiral carbon.",Prediction of a Nonvalence Temporary Anion Shape Resonance for a Model (H2O)4 System.,https://www.ncbi.nlm.nih.gov/pubmed/30840459,The journal of physical chemistry. A,2019 04 05,"Ab initio calculations are used to demonstrate the existence of a nonvalence temporary anion shape resonance for a model (H2O)4 cluster system with no net dipole moment. The cluster is composed of two water dimers, the distance between which is varied. Each dimer possesses a weakly bound nonvalence anion state. For large separations of the dimer subunits, there are two bound nonvalence anion states (of Ag and B2u symmetry) corresponding to the symmetric and asymmetric combinations of the nonvalence anion states of the two dimer subunits. As the separation between the dimer subunits is decreased, the B2u anion increases in energy and becomes a temporary anion shape resonance. The real part of the resonance energy is determined as a function of the distance between the dimers and is found to increase monotonically from just above threshold to 28 meV for the range of geometries considered. Over this same range of geometries, the resonance half-width varies from 0 to 21 meV. The B2u anion, both when bound and when temporary, has a very diffuse charge distribution. The effective radial potential for the interaction of the excess electron with the cluster has a barrier at large distance arising from the electron-quadrupole interaction in combination with the repulsive angular momentum ( l = 1) contribution. This barrier impacts both the resonance energy and its lifetime.",Mechanisms and Kinetic Parameters for the Gas-Phase Reactions of 3-Methyl-3-buten-2-one and 3-Methyl-3-penten-2-one with Ozone.,https://www.ncbi.nlm.nih.gov/pubmed/30840458,The journal of physical chemistry.

The results indicate that the major products are butanedione and formaldehyde for MBO332, and butanedione and acetaldehyde for MPO332. Possible reaction mechanism and thermodynamic parameters of some complex stable Criegee intermediates (SCIs) RR'COO were also be investigated in this study. Some organic peroxides can be regarded as the main products for the further reactions of SCIs.

These identified mechanisms include direct nonadiabatic Coulomb explosion responsible for CO bond-breaking, a long-range "" inverse harpooning"" dominating the production of H2+ + HCOH+, a transient proton migration leading to surprising energy partitioning in three-body fragmentation and other complex dynamics forming products such as H2O+ and H3+. These mechanisms provide general concepts that should be useful for analyzing future time-resolved Coulomb explosion imaging of methanol as well as other molecular systems. These advances are enabled by a combination of recently developed experimental and computational techniques, using weak ultrafast EUV pulses to initiate the CE and a high-level quantum chemistry approach to follow the resulting field-free nonadiabatic molecular dynamics.",Underlying Role of Brushite in Pathological Mineralization of Hydroxyapatite.,https://www.ncbi.nlm.nih.gov/pubmed/30840456,The journal of physical chemistry.

However, the underlying mechanisms of the phase transition and its modulation by natural inhibitors, such as osteopontin (OPN) proteins, remain poorly understood. Here, the in vitro formation of new phases on the DCPD (010) surface is observed in situ using atomic force microscopy in a simulated hypercalciuria milieu. We demonstrate the presence of an acidic amorphous calcium phosphate (ACP) phase with a characteristic Raman band of ν1HPO42- and the octacalcium phosphate (OCP)-like phase during the transformation process. High-resolution transmission electron microscopy analyses also confirm the existence of OCP and HAP within an amorphous matrix phase. In support of clinical observations, we further demonstrate the inhibitory effect of OPN peptide segments on the dissolution of DCPD and reprecipitation of acidic ACP. The definition of respective roles of DCPD and OPN thereby provides insights into the control of nucleus formation and subsequent inhibition of pathological mineralization.","Concise Approach to Cyclohexyne and 1,2-Cyclohexadiene Precursors.",https://www.ncbi.nlm.nih.gov/pubmed/30840455,The Journal of organic chemistry,2019 03 15,"Silyl triflate precursors to cyclic alkynes and allenes serve as valuable synthetic building blocks.

Small molecule (SM) drugs have been utilized to treat complex human diseases by affecting the expression of miRNAs. Several computational methods were proposed to infer underlying associations between SMs and miRNAs. In our study, we proposed a new calculation model of random forest based small molecule-miRNA association prediction (RFSMMA) which was based on the known SM-miRNA associations in the SM2miR database. RFSMMA utilized the similarity of SMs and miRNAs as features to represent SM-miRNA pairs and further implemented the machine learning algorithm of random forest to train training samples and obtain a prediction model. In RFSMMA, integrating multiple kinds of similarity can avoid the bias of single similarity and choosing more reliable features from original features can represent SM-miRNA pairs more accurately. We carried out cross validations to assess predictive accuracy of RFSMMA. As a result, RFSMMA acquired AUCs of 0.9854, 0.9839, 0.7052, and 0.9917 ± 0.0008 under global leave-one-out cross validation (LOOCV), miRNA-fixed local LOOCV, SM-fixed local LOOCV, and 5-fold cross validation, respectively, under data set 1. Based on data set 2, RFSMMA obtained AUCs of 0.8456, 0.8463, 0.6653, and 0.8389 ± 0.0033 under four cross validations according to the order mentioned above. In addition, we implemented a case study on three common SMs, namely, 5-fluorouracil, 17β-estradiol, and 5-aza-2'-deoxycytidine. Among the top 50 associated miRNAs of these three SMs predicted by RFSMMA, 31, 32, and 28 miRNAs were verified, respectively. Therefore, RFSMMA is shown to be an effective and reliable tool for identifying underlying SM-miRNA associations.",Synthesis and Biological Studies of (+)-Liquiditerpenoic Acid A (Abietopinoic Acid) and Representative Analogues: SAR Studies.,https://www.ncbi.nlm.nih.gov/pubmed/30840453,Journal of natural products,2019 04 26,"The first semisynthesis and biological profiling of the new abietane diterpenoid (+)-liquiditerpenoic acid A (abietopinoic acid) (7) along with several analogues are reported.

Abnormal CE levels are often related to various diseases, particularly hyperlipidemia and atherosclerosis. Herein, we developed a mathematical model-assisted ultrahigh performance liquid chromatography-mass spectrometry (UHPLC-MS) method for the untargeted identification to targeted quantification of CEs in plasma, different density lipoprotein samples from humans, rats, and golden hamsters. Using UHPLC-quadrupole-time-of-flight mass spectrometry (UHPLC-QTOF-MS), 81 CE candidates were detected in the above samples, of which 24 CEs were reported in the Human Metabolome Database and 57 CEs were newly identified based on an in-house database of theoretically possible CEs, including the computationally generated precursor ion m/ z mass of CE, carbon number and double bond numbers of the fatty acyl chain. Then three mathematical models based on the characteristic chromatographic retention behavior related to structural features were established and validated using commercial and synthetic CE standards. The mathematical model-assisted UHPLC-MS/MS strategy was proposed to provide a global profiling and identification of CEs, especially unknown CEs. With the efficient strategy, 74 CEs in the plasma of golden hamsters were identified and then quantified in normal and hyperlipidemic golden hamsters by dynamic multiple reaction monitoring (dMRM). A total of 21 CEs among 35 shared potential biomarkers were newly found for hyperlipidemia. Our work will contribute to the in-depth study of the functions of CEs and the discovery of disease biomarkers.",Magnetic Quantum Dot Nanobead-Based Fluorescent Immunochromatographic Assay for the Highly Sensitive Detection of Aflatoxin B1 in Dark Soy Sauce.,https://www.ncbi.nlm.nih.gov/pubmed/30840438,Analytical chemistry,2019 04 02,"Herein, we synthesized bifunctional magnetic fluorescent beads (MFBs) with a distinct core/shell structure by encapsulating octadecylamine-coated CdSe/ZnS QDs (OC-QDs) and oleic acid-modified iron oxide nanoparticles (OA-IONPs) into two polymer matrixes with different hydrophobic properties. The OC-QDs and OA-IONPs were mainly distributed in the outer layer of MFBs. The resultant MFBs displayed ca. 226-fold stronger fluorescence emission relative to the corresponding OC-QDs and retained ca. 45.4% of the saturation magnetization of the OA-IONPs. The MFBs were used to purify and enrich aflatoxin B1 (AFB1) from dark soy sauce and then utilized as a fluorescent reporter of immunochromatographic assay (ICA) for the sensitive detection of AFB1. Under the optimal detection conditions, the MFB-based ICA (MFB-ICA) displayed a dynamic linear detection of AFB1 in sauce extract over the range of 5-150 pg/mL with a half maximal inhibitory concentration of 27 ± 3 pg/mL ( n = 3). The detection limits for AFB1 in sauce extract and real dark soy sauce were 3 and 51 pg/mL, respectively, which are considerably better than those of the previously reported fluorescent bead-based ICA methods. The analytical performance of the proposed MFB-ICA in terms of selectivity and accuracy was investigated by analyzing AFB1-spiked dark soy sauce samples. The reliability of the proposed method was further confirmed by ultraperformance liquid chromatography with fluorescence detection. With the combined advantages of QDs and IONPs, the resultant MFBs offer great potential as reporters of ICA for the sensitive detection of trace pollutants in complex matrix samples.","Designing of a Cofactor Self-Sufficient Whole-Cell Biocatalyst System for Production of 1,2-Amino Alcohols from Epoxides.",https://www.ncbi.nlm.nih.gov/pubmed/30840437,ACS synthetic biology,2019 04 19,"Optically pure 1,2-amino alcohols are highly valuable products as intermediates for chiral pharmaceutical products. Here we designed an environmentally friendly non-natural biocatalytic cascade for efficient synthesis of 1,2-amino alcohols from cheaper epoxides. A redesignated ω-transaminase PAKω-TA was tested and showed good bioactivity at a lower pH than other reported transaminases. The cascade was efficiently constructed as a single one-pot E. coli recombinant, by coupling SpEH (epoxide hydrolase), MnADH (alcohol dehydrogenase), and PAKω-TA. Furthermore, RBS regulation strategy was used to overcome the rate limiting step by increasing expression of MnADH. For cofactor regeneration and amino donor source, an interesting point was involved as that a cofactor self-sufficient system was designed by expression of GluDH. It established a ""bridge"" between the cofactor and the cosubstrate, such that the cofactor self-sufficient system could release cofactor (NADP+) and cosubstrate (l-Glutamine) regenerated simultaneously. The recombinant E. coli BL21 (SGMP) with cofactor self-sufficient whole-cell cascade biocatalysis showed high ee value (>99%) and high yield, with 99.6% conversion of epoxide ( S)-1a to 1,2-amino alcohol ( S)-1d in 10 h. It further converted ( S)-2a-5a to ( S)-2d-5d with varying conversion rates ranging between 65-96.4%.

Optimally, nearly all antibody binding sites should be available to bind. Here we report for the first time an LC-MS/MS approach to probe antibody orientation directly, utilizing sterically restricted proteolysis. Trypsin-decorated magnetic beads (MBs, 1.5 μm) were much larger than average antibody-free areas (55 × 55 nm) of oriented antibodies on MBs, restricting proteolysis to mainly Fab regions. Randomly attached antibodies on MB surfaces served as controls. The tryptic-hydrolyzed peptides were quantified using LC-MS/MS peptide analysis as markers for average positions of Fc and Fab of antibodies on the beads. Different patterns of digestion rates were found due to proteolysis of the oriented and nonoriented antibodies on MBs. For oriented antibodies, the peptides from outer Fab regions gave a much higher digestion rate than those from Fc regions, while for randomly immobilized antibodies digestion rates for Fab and Fc peptides were similar. This novel approach is a useful and convenient tool to characterize antibody orientation for immunoassays and other applications. The relative degree of orientation can be assessed using a metric Ro denoting amount of Fab marker peptides found divided by Fc + Fab marker peptides × 100%. Oriented antibodies on the MBs also provided more efficient antigen capture compared to randomly immobilized antibodies.",Asymmetric Photocatalysis with Bis-cyclometalated Rhodium Complexes.,https://www.ncbi.nlm.nih.gov/pubmed/30840435,Accounts of chemical research,2019 03 19,"Aspects of sustainability are playing an increasingly important role for the development of new synthetic methods. In this context, the combination of asymmetric catalysis, which is considered one of the most economic strategies to generate nonracemic chiral compounds, and visible light as an abundant source of energy to induce or activate chemical reactions has recently gained much attention. Furthermore, the combination of photochemistry with asymmetric catalysis provides new opportunity for the development of mechanistically unique reaction schemes. However, the development of such asymmetric photocatalysis is very challenging and two main problems can be pinpointed to undesirable photochemical background reactions and to difficulties in controlling the stereochemistry with photochemically generated highly reactive intermediates. In this Account, we present and discuss asymmetric photocatalysis using one of the currently most versatile photoactivatable asymmetric catalysts, namely, reactive bis-cyclometalated rhodium(III) complexes. The catalysts contain two inert cyclometalating 5-( tert-butyl)-2-phenyl benzoxazole or benzothiazole ligands together with two labile acetonitriles, and the overall chirality is due to a stereogenic metal center. The bis-cyclometalated rhodium complexes serve as excellent chiral Lewis acids for substrates such as 2-acyl imidazoles and N-acyl pyrazoles, which, upon replacement of the two labile acetonitrile ligands, coordinate to the rhodium center in a 2-point fashion. These rhodium-substrate intermediates display unique photophysical and photochemical properties and are often the photoactive intermediates in the developed asymmetric photocatalysis reaction schemes. This combination of visible light excitation to generate long-lived photoexcited states and intrinsic Lewis acid reactivity opens the door for a multitude of visible-light-induced asymmetric conversions. In a first mode of reactivity, bis-cyclometalated rhodium complexes function as chiral Lewis acids to control asymmetric radical reactions of rhodium enolates with electron-deficient radicals, rhodium-coordinated enones with electron-rich radicals, or rhodium-bound radicals generated by photoinduced single electron transfer. The rhodium-substrate complexes in their ground states are key intermediates of the asymmetric catalysis, while separate photoredox cycles initiate radical generations via single electron transfer with either the rhodium-substrate complexes or additional photoactive compounds serving as the photoredox catalyst (secondary asymmetric photocatalysis). In a second mode of reactivity, the rhodium-substrate complexes serve as photoexcited intermediates within the asymmetric catalysis cycle (primary asymmetric photocatalysis) and undergo stereocontrolled chemistry either upon single electron transfer or by direct bond forming reactions out of the excited state. These multiple modes of intertwining photochemistry with asymmetric catalysis have been applied to asymmetric α- and β-alkylations, α- and β-aminations, β-C-H functionalization of carbonyl compounds, [3 + 2] photocycloadditions between cyclopropanes and alkenes or alkynes, [2 + 2] photocycloadditions of enones with alkenes, dearomative [2 + 2] photocycloadditions, and [2 + 3] photocycloadditions of enones with vinyl azides. We anticipate that these reaction schemes of chiral bis-cyclometalated rhodium complexes as (photoactive) chiral Lewis acids will spur the development of new photocatalysts for visible-light-induced asymmetric catalysis.",Reverse Chemical Proteomics Identifies an Unanticipated Human Target of the Antimalarial Artesunate.,https://www.ncbi.nlm.nih.gov/pubmed/30840434,ACS chemical biology,2019 04 19,"Artemisinins are the most potent and safe antimalarials available. Despite their clinical potential, no human target for the artemisinins is known. The unbiased interrogation of several human cDNA libraries, displayed on bacteriophage T7, revealed a single human target of artesunate; the intrinsically disordered Bcl-2 antagonist of cell death promoter (BAD). We show that artesunate inhibits the phosphorylation of BAD, thereby promoting the formation of the proapoptotic BAD/Bcl-xL complex and the subsequent intrinsic apoptotic cascade involving cytochrome c release, PARP cleavage, caspase activation, and ultimately cell death. This unanticipated role of BAD as a possible drug target of artesunate points to direct clinical exploitation of artemisinins in the Bcl-xL life/death switch and that artesunate's anticancer activity is, at least in part, independent of reactive oxygen species.",Biomimetic Glyconanoparticle Vaccine for Cancer Immunotherapy.,https://www.ncbi.nlm.nih.gov/pubmed/30840433,ACS nano,2019 03 27,"Cancer immunotherapy aims to harness the immune system to combat malignant processes. Transformed cells harbor diverse modifications that lead to formation of neoantigens, including aberrantly expressed cell surface carbohydrates. Targeting tumor-associated carbohydrate antigens (TACA) hold great potential for cancer immunotherapy. N-glycolylneuraminic acid (Neu5Gc) is a dietary non-human immunogenic carbohydrate that accumulates on human cancer cells, thereby generating neoantigens. In mice, passive immunotherapy with anti-Neu5Gc antibodies inhibits growth of Neu5Gc-positive tumors. Here, we designed an active cancer vaccine immunotherapy strategy to target Neu5Gc-positive tumors. We generated biomimetic glyconanoparticles using engineered αGal knockout porcine red blood cells to form nanoghosts (NGs) that either express (NGpos) or lack expression (NGneg) of Neu5Gc-glycoconjugates in their natural context. We demonstrated that optimized immunization of ""human-like"" Neu5Gc-deficient Cmah-/- mice with NGpos glyconanoparticles induce a strong, diverse and persistent anti-Neu5Gc IgG immune response. The resulting anti-Neu5Gc IgG antibodies were also detected within Neu5Gc-positive tumors and inhibited tumor growth in vivo. Using detailed glycan microarray analysis, we further demonstrate that the kinetics and quality of the immune responses influence the efficacy of the vaccine. These findings reinforce the potential of TACA neoantigens and the dietary non-human sialic acid Neu5Gc, in particular, as immunotherapy targets.",Colloidal Drug Aggregate Stability in High Serum Conditions and Pharmacokinetic Consequence.,https://www.ncbi.nlm.nih.gov/pubmed/30840432,ACS chemical biology,2019 04 23,"Colloidal drug aggregates have been a nuisance in drug screening, yet, because they inherently comprise drug-rich particles, they may be useful in vivo if issues of stability can be addressed. As the first step toward answering this question, we optimized colloidal drug aggregate formulations using a fluorescence-based assay to study fulvestrant colloidal formation and stability in high (90%) serum conditions in vitro. We show, for the first time, that the critical aggregation concentration of fulvestrant depends on media composition and increases with serum concentration. Excipients, such as polysorbate 80, stabilize fulvestrant colloids in 90% serum in vitro for over 48 h. Using fulvestrant and an investigational pro-drug, pentyloxycarbonyl-( p-aminobenzyl) doxazolidinylcarbamate (PPD), as proof-of-concept colloidal formulations, we demonstrate that the in vivo plasma half-life for stabilized colloids is greater than their respective monomeric forms. These studies demonstrate the potential of turning the nuisance of colloidal drug aggregation into an opportunity for drug-rich formulations.",Wavelength-Tunable Waveguide Emissions from Electrically Driven Single ZnO/ZnO:Ga Superlattice Microwires.,https://www.ncbi.nlm.nih.gov/pubmed/30840431,ACS applied materials & interfaces,2019 03 28,"Because of the superlattice structures comprising periodic and alternating crystalline layers, one-dimensional photon crystals can be employed to expand immense versatility and practicality of modulating the electronic and photonic propagation behaviors, as well as optical properties. In this work, individual superlattice microwires (MWs) comprising ZnO and Ga-doped ZnO (ZnO/ZnO:Ga) layers were successfully synthesized. Wavelength-tunable multipeak emissions can be realized from electrically driven single superlattice MW-based emission devices, with the dominant wavelengths tuned from ultraviolet to visible spectral regions. To illustrate the multipeak character, single superlattice MWs were selected to construct fluorescent emitters, and the emission wavelength could be tuned from 518 to 562 nm, which is dominated by Ga incorporation. Especially, by introducing Au quasiparticle film decoration, emission characteristics can further be modulated, such as the red shift of the emission wavelengths, and the multipeaks were strongly modified and split into more and narrower subbands. In particular, electrically pumped exciton-polariton emission was realized from heterojunction diodes composed of single ZnO/ZnO:Ga superlattice MWs and p-GaN layers in the blue-ultraviolet spectral regions. With the aid of localized surface plasmons from Au nanoparticles, which deposited on the superlattice MW, significant improvement of emission characteristics, such as enhancement of output efficiencies, blue shift of the dominant emission wavelengths, and narrowing of the spectral linewidth, can be achieved. The multipeak emission characteristics would be originated from the typical optical cavity modes, but not the Fabry-Perot mode optical cavity formed by the bilateral sides of the wire. The resonant modes are likely attributed to the coupled optical microcavities, which formed along the axial direction of the wire; thus, the emitted photons can be propagated and selected longitudinally. Therefore, the novel ZnO/ZnO:Ga superlattice MWs with a quadrilateral cross section can provide a potential platform to construct multicolor emitters and low-threshold exciton-polariton diodes and lasers.",The Canadian Biomarker Integration Network in Depression (CAN-BIND): magnetic resonance imaging protocols,https://www.ncbi.nlm.nih.gov/pubmed/30840428,Journal of psychiatry & neuroscience : JPN,2019 03 06,"Studies of clinical populations that combine MRI data generated at multiple sites are increasingly common. The Canadian Biomarker Integration Network in Depression (CAN-BIND; www.canbind.ca) is a national depression research program that includes multimodal neuroimaging collected at several sites across Canada. The purpose of the current paper is to provide detailed information on the imaging protocols used in a number of CAN-BIND studies. The CAN-BIND program implemented a series of platform-specific MRI protocols, including a suite of prescribed structural and functional MRI sequences supported by real-time monitoring for adherence and quality control. The imaging data are retained in an established informatics and databasing platform. Approximately 1300 participants are being recruited, including almost 1000 with depression. These include participants treated with antidepressant medications, transcranial magnetic stimulation, cognitive behavioural therapy and cognitive remediation therapy. Our ability to analyze the large number of imaging variables available may be limited by the sample size of the substudies. The CAN-BIND program includes a multimodal imaging database supported by extensive clinical, demographic, neuropsychological and biological data from people with major depression. It is a resource for Canadian investigators who are interested in understanding whether aspects of neuroimaging — alone or in combination with other variables — can predict the outcomes of various treatment modalities."

Dihydroxyacetone is one of the most important value-added products obtained from glycerol, a by-product of biodiesel production. The effect of organic nitrogen source and initial substrate concentrations has been studied together with the possibility of product inhibition. Afterward, the influence of the main operating conditions (temperature, shaking speed, and initial biomass concentration) on in vivo glycerol dehydrogenase activity has also been considered. The results show no evidence of glycerol inhibition, but an important product inhibition was detected, which has been taken into account in a kinetic model for enzymatic activity description. In terms of operating conditions, pH was found to exert a great impact on glycerol conversion, being necessary to keep it above 4 to ensure complete glycerol conversion. The minimum temperature that maximized enzymatic activity was found to be 30°C. In addition, a surprising decoupling between biomass concentration and dihydroxyacetone production rate was observed when adding increasing nitrogen source concentrations at a fixed shaking speed. Glycerol dehydrogenase activity remains constant despite the increase in biomass concentration, contrary to what would be expected. This fact revealed the existence of a rate limiting factor, identified subsequently as oxygen transfer rate depending on the biomass concentration.",Synthesis and Biological Evaluation of RGD and isoDGR-Monomethyl Auristatin Conjugates Targeting Integrin αV β3.,https://www.ncbi.nlm.nih.gov/pubmed/30840356,ChemMedChem,2019 05 06,"This work reports the synthesis of a series of small-molecule-drug conjugates containing the αV β3 -integrin ligand cyclo[DKP-RGD] or cyclo[DKP-isoDGR], a lysosomally cleavable Val-Ala (VA) linker or an ""uncleavable"" version devoid of this sequence, and monomethyl auristatin E (MMAE) or F (MMAF) as the cytotoxic agent. The conjugates were obtained via a straightforward synthetic scheme taking advantage of a copper-catalyzed azide-alkyne cycloaddition as the key step. The conjugates were tested for their binding affinity for the isolated αv β3 receptor and were shown to retain nanomolar IC50 values, in the same range as those of the free ligands. The cytotoxic activity of the conjugates was evaluated in cell viability assays with αv β3 integrin overexpressing human glioblastoma (U87) and human melanoma (M21) cells. The conjugates possess markedly lower cytotoxic activity than the free drugs, which is consistent with inefficient integrin-mediated internalization. In almost all cases the conjugates featuring isoDGR as integrin ligand exhibited higher potency than their RGD counterparts. In particular, the cyclo[DKP-isoDGR]-VA-MMAE conjugate has low nanomolar IC50 values in cell viability assays with both cancer cell lines tested (U87: 11.50±0.13 nm; M21: 6.94±0.09 nm) and is therefore a promising candidate for in vivo experiments.",Conversion of Intrathecal Opioids to Fentanyl in Chronic Pain Patients With Implantable Pain Pumps: A Retrospective Study.,https://www.ncbi.nlm.nih.gov/pubmed/30840355,Neuromodulation : journal of the International Neuromodulation Society,2019 03 06,"Conversion between routes such as intravenous (IV), epidural (EP), and intrathecal (IT) routes for morphine is well established.

In this study, optimization of marine and freshwater microalgae flocculation by pH adjustment was investigated via central composite design methodology. One molar of KOH and NaOH solutions were used to increase the pH level of the microalgal culture. Increasing pH value of the medium provided the highest flocculation efficiency up to 92.63 and 86.18% with pH adjusted to 10.5 with KOH and NaOH solutions for marine microalgae Nannochloropsis oculata and freshwater microalgae Chlorella minutissima, respectively. Also, it was revealed that microalgae cells were still alive after flocculation process and their biochemical composition was not changed, and flocculated medium can be used again for the next microalgal production.

Understanding the nature of these interactions can provide the basis for regulating their structures and functionalities, and a reasonable way to interpret the differences in various properties. However, the relative strength of gold-chalcogen bonds remains controversial, and the conclusions of many related works are inconsistent. Thus, in this work, we successfully quantified the relative strength of Au-X (X=S, Se, and Te from chalcogenide-containing A-B-A type block copolymers) interactions at the single-molecule level through single-molecule force spectroscopy (SMFS) from a kinetic point of view and quantum chemical studies from a thermodynamic point of view. Both sets of results suggested that the strength of the Au-X bonds decreases as Au-Te>Au-Se>Au-S.

Unfortunately, adult mouse and human retinal stem cells (RSCs), unlike fish and amphibians, are quiescent in vivo and do not regenerate following disease or injury. To replace lost cells, we used microcarriers (MCs) in a suspension stirring bioreactor to help achieve numbers suitable for differentiation and transplantation. We achieved a significant 10-fold enrichment of RSC yield compared to conventional static culture techniques using a combination of FACTIII MCs and relative hypoxia (5%) inside the bioreactor. We found that hypoxia (5% O2 ) was associated with better RSC expansion across all platforms; and this can be attributed to hypoxia-induced increases in survival and/or symmetric division of stem cells. In the future, we will target the differentiation of RSCs and their progeny toward rod and cone photoreceptor phenotypes using FACTIII MCs inside bioreactors to expand their populations in order to produce the large numbers of cells needed for transplantation.",Wireless Coupling of Conducting Polymer Actuators with Light Emission.,https://www.ncbi.nlm.nih.gov/pubmed/30840350,Chemphyschem : a European journal of chemical physics and physical chemistry,2019 05 17,"Combining the actuation of conducting polymers with additional functionalities is an interesting fundamental scientific challenge and increases their application potential.

A light emitting diode is used as a part of an electroactive surface on which electrochemical polymerization allows direct incorporation of the electronic device into the polymer. The resulting free-standing polymer/LED hybrid can be addressed by bipolar electrochemistry to trigger simultaneously oxidation and reduction reactions at its opposite extremities, leading to a controlled deformation and an electron flow through the integrated LED.

Bilateral common carotid artery (CCA) ligation (n = 24) or sham-operation (n = 24) was performed with a 1-week interval. A subgroup (ligated n = 6; sham-operated n = 3) underwent magnetic resonance imaging (MRI) before the procedures and 2 and 4 weeks after the second procedure. After termination, carotids were harvested for assessment of complete ligation and nerve density in cerebral arteries that were stained for the general neural marker PGP 9.5 and sympathetic marker TH by computerized image analysis. Five rats were excluded because of incomplete ligation. MRI-based tortuosity of the posterior communicating artery (Pcom), first part of the posterior cerebral artery (P1) and basilar artery was observed in the ligated group, as well as an increased volume (p = 0.05) and relative signal intensity in the basilar artery (p = 0.04; sham-group unchanged). Immunohistochemical analysis revealed that compared to sham-operated rats, ligated rats had increased diameters of all intracircular segments and the extracircular part of the internal carotid artery (p < 0.05). Ligated rats showed a higher general nerve density compared to controls in P1 (10%, IQR:8.7-10.5 vs. 6.6%, IQR:5.5-7.4, p = 0.003) and Pcom segments (6.4%, IQR:5.8-6.5 vs. 3.2%, IQR:2.4-4.3, p = 0.003) and higher sympathetic nerve density in Pcom segments (3.7%, IQR:2.8-4.8 vs. 1.7%, IQR:1.3-2.2, p = 0.02).

Although discovered 13 years previously with over 70 topologies reported, there is a lack in the fundamental understanding of assembly mechanisms, particularly the role of the alkali counterions. Herein, the reaction pathway and assembly of uranyl peroxide capsules is reported by tracking the conversion from K+ uranyl triperoxide monomer to the K+ uranyl-peroxide U28 capsule by means of small-angle X-ray scattering and Raman spectroscopy. For the first time, the K+ uranyl-peroxide pentamer face is isolated and structurally characterized, giving credence to the long-held belief that these geometric faces serve as building blocks to the fully formed capsules. Once isolated and re-dissolved, the pentamer face undergoes rapid conversion to capsule forms, underlining its high reactivity that challenges its isolation.

The extent of this feedback depends on plants' ability to acclimate respiration to maintain a constant carbon use efficiency (CUE). We quantified respiratory partitioning of gross primary production (GPP) and CUE of field-grown trees in a long-term warming experiment (+3°C). We delivered a 13 C-CO2 pulse to whole tree crowns and chased that pulse in the respiration of leaves, whole crowns, roots, and soil. We also measured the isotopic composition of soil microbial biomass and the respiration rates of leaves and whole crowns. We documented homeostatic respiratory acclimation of foliar and whole-crown respiration rates; the trees adjusted to experimental warming such that leaf-level respiration rates were not increased. Experimental warming had no detectable impact on respiratory partitioning or mean residence times. Of the 13 C label acquired by the trees, aboveground respiration consumed 10%, belowground respiration consumed 40%, and the remaining 50% was retained. Experimental warming of +3°C did not alter respiratory partitioning at the scale of entire trees, suggesting that complete acclimation of respiration to warming is likely to dampen a positive climate warming feedback.",Non-invasive positive pressure ventilation for prevention of complications after pulmonary resection in lung cancer patients.,https://www.ncbi.nlm.nih.gov/pubmed/30840317,The Cochrane database of systematic reviews,2019 04 16,"Pulmonary complications are often seen during the postoperative period following lung resection for patients with lung cancer.

The equilibrium isotherms studied were from Langmuir and Freundlich. The coefficients of determination (R2 > 0.99) were found to confirm the best fitted to Langmuir isotherm, with a monolayer adsorption capacity (qmax) of 552.49 mg g-1.

To elucidate the effect of earthworms in the selective reduction of pathogens, grape marc substrate was artificially inoculated with Escherichia coli, Enterococcus spp., thermotolerant coliform bacteria (TCB), and Salmonella spp., and their reduction during vermicomposting was monitored. Various defense mechanisms eliminating microorganisms in the earthworm gut were assumed to be involved in the process of pathogen reduction. Therefore, we followed the expression of three pattern recognition receptors (coelomic cytolytic factor (CCF), lipopolysaccharide-binding protein (LBP), and Toll-like receptor (v-TLR)), two antimicrobial molecules (fetidin/lysenins and lysozyme), and heat shock protein HSP70.

Water samples were collected and field parameters measured, during low flow period. Temperature, pH, dissolved oxygen, electric conductivity, turbidity, total suspended solids, silicate, N-NO3, N-NO2, N-NH4, dissolved and particulate organic nitrogen, PO4, and dissolved and particulate organic phosphorus were measured hourly during a diel cycle. Upstream hydrochemistry resembles pristine watersheds in tropical rainforest, and results are restricted to a narrow range of values during the entire sampling period. Conversely, values downstream varied widely and, for some analytes, presented differences between day and night. Dissolved oxygen and electric conductivity showed the effect of the urban pulse, varying according to the routine of the population. Other field parameters did no presents a pattern that could distinguish up- and downstream stations. All the nutrients, but silicate, increased in concentration downstream. Particulate organic phosphorus, N-NO2, and N-NH4 were the nutrients that highlight the magnitude of the changes driven by urban effluents. These three nutrient species, and dissolved organic phosphorus, revealed a remarkably pattern that reflects the routine of the urban population, with low concentrations at night and a progressive increase starting at the early morning."

The aim of this review is to focus on the effects of short-chain fatty acids (SCFAs), which are the main products of gut microbial fermentation from non-digestible carbohydrates in the colon, on the gut-brain axis. Evidence is accumulating regarding the role of SCFAs in the fine-tuning of the gut-brain axis, a feedback system which is vital not only for the proper maintenance of gastrointestinal and metabolic functions, but also for the regulation of food intake and energy expenditure. SCFAs are thought to play a key role in increasing the host capacity to harvest excess energy from the diet. SCFAs, however, can exert their effects on the host metabolism via multiple complementary pathways. Metabolic, inflammatory, and neural pathways can be regulated by SCFAs, which can act by sensing nutritional status, thereby maintaining body energy homeostasis. SCFA production from prebiotic consumption is the rationale for targeting intestinal mechanisms to increase energy expenditure and thereby reduce obesity risk.","Can baseline endocrinological examination and thyroid ultrasound predict the development of thyroid disease in immunotherapy-treated patients?

We found that plasma and liver levels of HSP70 were lower after DJOS surgery in comparison to the control in the groups of animals kept on control diet (CD) and high-fat, high-sugar diet (HFS) but the postoperative change of the diet led to the increase in HSP70 in plasma and liver concentration in DJOS-operated animals. A high-calorie meal, rich in carbohydrates and fats, significantly increased circulating levels of HSP90, reducing the normalising effect of DJOS. The HFS diet applied during all stages of the experiment led to the higher levels of liver HSP90 concentration. The combination of CD and DJOS surgery was the most efficient in the lowering of the HSP90 liver concentration. The normalisation of circulating levels and liver concentrations of HSP70 and HSP90 may be achieved in a combination of DJOS procedure with a proper dietary plan."

The liverwort, Marchantia polymorpha, is a basal land plant, with a recently sequenced genome. The number of genes encoding basic helix-loop-helix (bHLH) family members is considerably higher in M. polymorpha than in charophyte green algae, suggesting the contribution of bHLH proteins to the evolution of GRNs associated with the adaptation of plants to land. Although an understanding of the evolutionary aspects of GRNs is fundamental for elucidating the mechanisms of environmental adaptation, the evolution of GRNs that led to land adaptation in plants remains poorly understood. In this study, we isolated a single gene encoding a IIIf bHLH TF from M. polymorpha, MpBHLH12. Transgenic M. polymorpha constitutively overexpressing MpBHLH12 showed smaller and fewer gemma cups than wild type, suggesting that MpBHLH12 is involved in the regulation of morphological development. Transcriptomic analysis of MpBHLH12 overexpressor (MpBHLH12ox) lines revealed an overlap with the GRN of MpMYB14, which regulates the biosynthesis of anthocyanins and phenolic compounds. However, MpBHLH12ox did not show anthocyanin accumulation. Results of the transient reporter assay suggest that MpBHLH12 could function in repression rather than activation. Our findings suggest that although the IIIf bHLH MpBHLH12 shows highest amino acid similarity with IIIf bHLH clade and is involved in developmental process and partly biosynthesis of phenolic compounds in M. polymorpha like Arabidopsis IIIf bHLH, the GRN involving MpBHLH12 would be distinct one from those of the IIIf bHLH TFs of seed plants.",Family Planning and Rheumatoid Arthritis.,https://www.ncbi.nlm.nih.gov/pubmed/30840208,Current rheumatology reports,2019 04 06,"Patients with rheumatoid arthritis (RA) have special family planning considerations that require close coordination with health care providers.

Correct splicing requires a precise exon/intron junction definition, which is determined by a consensual donor and acceptor splice site at the 5' and 3' end, respectively. An acceptor splice site (3'ss) consists of highly conserved AG nucleotides in positions E-2 and E-1. These nucleotides can appear in tandem, located 3 bp from each other. Then they are referred to as NAGNAG or tandem 3'ss, which can be alternatively spliced. NAG/TAG 3'ss motif abundance is extremely low and cannot be easily explained by just a nucleotide preference in this position. We tested artificial NAG/TAG motif's potential negative effect on exon recognition using a minigene assay. Introducing the NAG/TAG motif into seven different exons revealed no general negative effect on exon recognition. The only observed effect was the partial use of the newly formed distal 3'ss. We can conclude that this motif's extremely low preference in a natural 3'ss is not a consequence of the NAG/TAG motif's negative effect on exon recognition, but more likely the result of other RNA processing aspects, such as an alternative 3'ss choice, decreased 3'ss strength, or incorporating an amber stop codon.",Tumour infiltrating lymphocytes and PD-L1 expression as potential predictors of outcome in patients with malignant pleural mesothelioma.,https://www.ncbi.nlm.nih.gov/pubmed/30840203,Molecular biology reports,2019 06 10,"Malignant pleural mesothelioma (MPM) is a rare and aggressive form of tumour.

Patients were divided in 4 groups according to a cut-off of the percentage of TILs found per sample as measured by immunohistichemistry: ""0"" or absent (between 0 and 5%), ""1"" or low (between 6 and 25%), ""2"" or moderate (between 26 and 50%) and ""3"" or high (between 51 and 75%). OS was then correlated with different TILs' expression patterns. Moreover, PD-L1 expression was assessed within the tumour as well as in the adjacent stroma on the same samples. Higher expression of peritumoral TILs (Group 2 + 3) versus Group 0 and 1 correlated with improved OS (p-value = 0.02). On the contrary PD-L1 expression seemed to be inversely correlated with clinical outcomes, even in the absence of statistical significance (HR 1.76; p = 0.083 95% IC 0.92-3.36 in areas within the tumour; HR 1.60; p = 0.176 95%; IC 0.80-3.19 in areas within the stroma). No relationship between TILs and PD-L1 expression was identified. Our research supports the use of TILs and PD-L1 expression as potential outcome predictors in patients with MPM. The use of TILs and PD-L1 as biomarkers for checkpoint inhibitors' efficacy warrants future investigation."

We identified miR-21, miR-24, and miR-143 to be highly upregulated in stenotic aortic valves. Using luciferase reporter systems, we found direct binding of miR-143 to the 3'UTR region of the matrix gla protein (MGP), which in turn is a key factor to sustain homeostasis in aortic valves. In subsequent experiments, we demonstrated a therapeutic potential of miRNA regulation during calcification in cardiac valvular interstitial cells.

Recent theoretical and methodological developments have helped clarify a number of principles of confounder selection. When complete knowledge of a causal diagram relating all covariates to each other is available, graphical rules can be used to make decisions about covariate control. Unfortunately, such complete knowledge is often unavailable. This paper puts forward a practical approach to confounder selection decisions when the somewhat less stringent assumption is made that knowledge is available for each covariate whether it is a cause of the exposure, and whether it is a cause of the outcome. Based on recent theoretically justified developments in the causal inference literature, the following proposal is made for covariate control decisions: control for each covariate that is a cause of the exposure, or of the outcome, or of both; exclude from this set any variable known to be an instrumental variable; and include as a covariate any proxy for an unmeasured variable that is a common cause of both the exposure and the outcome. Various principles of confounder selection are then further related to statistical covariate selection methods.",Comparative transcriptome analyses provide insights into the adaptation mechanisms to acute salt stresses in juvenile Sinonovacula constricta.,https://www.ncbi.nlm.nih.gov/pubmed/30840180,Genes & genomics,2019 04 26,"Sinonovacula constricta is an economically important bivalve species in China, Korea and Japan that widely resides in estuarine and coastal areas where salinity fluctuates rapidly.

MiRNA target genes involved in fruit ripening and the differentially expressed miRNAs under CO2 treatment were identified. MicroRNAs (miRNAs) are short non-coding RNAs and play important functions in many biological processes, including fruit ripening and senescence. In the current study, the high-throughput sequencing and bioinformatics methods were implemented to decipher the miRNAs landscape in sweet cherry fruit. A total of 157 known miRNAs belonging to 50 families and 55 putative novel miRNAs were found. Target genes of the miRNAs were predicted and genes involved in fruit ripening were found, including F-box proteins and TFs such as SPL, TCP, NAC, MYB, ARF and AP2/ERF. And these target genes were further confirmed by degradome sequencing. A regulatory network model was constructed to uncover the miRNAs and their targets involved in fruit ripening and senescence. Importantly, elevated carbon dioxide can significantly postpone the ripening and senescence of sweet cherry fruit and the differentially expressed miRNAs exposed to CO2 were identified. These miRNAs included miR482j, miR6275, miR164, miR166, miR171, miR393, miR858, miR3627a, miR6284, miR6289 and miR7122b, and some of their functions were linked to fruit ripening. This study was the first report to profile miRNAs in sweet cherry fruit and it would provide more information for further study of miRNA roles in the ripening processes and their regulation mechanism underlying the effects of high carbon dioxide treatment on fruit ripening.",Identification and characterisation of a glycine-rich RNA-binding protein as an endogenous suppressor of RNA silencing from Nicotiana glutinosa.,https://www.ncbi.nlm.nih.gov/pubmed/30840177,Planta,2019 05 20,"This study shows that NgRBP suppresses both local and systemic RNA silencing induced by sense- or double-stranded RNA, and the RNA binding activity is essential for its function. To counteract host defence, many plant viruses encode viral suppressors of RNA silencing targeting various stages of RNA silencing. There is increasing evidence that the plants also encode endogenous suppressors of RNA silencing (ESR) to regulate this pathway. In this study, using Agrobacterium infiltration assays, we characterized NgRBP, a glycine-rich RNA-binding protein from Nicotiana glutinosa, as an ESR. Our results indicated that NgRBP suppressed both local and systemic RNA silencing induced by sense- or double-stranded RNA. We also demonstrated that NgRBP could promote Potato Virus X (PVX) infection in N. benthamiana. NgRBP knockdown by virus-induced gene silencing enhanced PVX and Cucumber mosaic virus resistance in N. glutinosa. RNA immunoprecipitation and electrophoretic mobility shift assays showed that NgRBP bound to GFP mRNA, dsRNA rather than siRNA. These findings provide the evidence that NgRBP acts as an ESR and the RNA affinity of NgRBP plays the key role in its ESR activity. NgRBP responds to multiple signals such as ABA, MeJA, SA, and Tobacco mosaic virus infection. Therefore, it could participate in the regulation of gene expression under specific conditions.",Physiological function of photoreceptor UVR8 in UV-B tolerance in the liverwort Marchantia polymorpha.,https://www.ncbi.nlm.nih.gov/pubmed/30840176,Planta,2019 05 13,"The physiological importance of MpUVR8 in UV-B resistance and translocation in a UV-B-dependent manner from the cytosol into the nucleus is characterized in Marchantia polymorpha. UV RESISTANCE LOCUS 8 (UVR8) is an ultraviolet-B (UV-B) light receptor functioning for UV-B sensing and tolerance in Arabidopsis thaliana and other species. It is unclear whether UVR8 physiologically functions in UV-B-induced defense responses in Marchantia polymorpha, which belongs to the earliest diverging group of embryophyte lineages. Here, we demonstrate that UVR8 has a physiological function in UV-B tolerance and that there is a UVR8-dependent pathway involved. In addition, a UVR8-independent pathway is revealed. We examine the tissue-specific expression pattern of M. polymorpha UVR8 (MpUVR8), showing that it is highly expressed in the apical notch in thalli and gametangiophores, as well as in antheridial and archegonial heads. Furthermore, Mpuvr8KO plant transformants, in which the MpUVR8 locus was disrupted, were produced and analyzed to understand the physiological and molecular function of MpUVR8. Analysis using these plants indicates the important roles of MpUVR8 and MpUVR8-regulated genes, and of MpUVR8-independent pathways in UV-B tolerance. Subcellular localization of Citrine-fused MpUVR8 in M. polymorpha cells was also investigated. It was found to translocate from the cytosol into the nucleus in response to UV-B irradiation. Our findings indicate strong conservation of the physiological function of UVR8 and the molecular mechanisms for UVR8-dependent signal transduction through regulation of gene expression in embryophytes."

It is a pathogen of cereals including wheat and barley, and causes foliar spot blotch, root rot, black point on grains, head blight, leaf blight, and seedling blight diseases. Annual yields of these economically important cereals are severely reduced due to this pathogen attack. Evolution of fungicide resistant pathogen strains, availability of a limited number of potent antifungal compounds, and their efficacy are the acute issues in field management of phytopathogenic fungi. Propiconazole is a widely used azole fungicide to control the disease in fields. The known targets of azoles are the demethylase enzymes involved in ergosterol biosynthesis. Nonetheless, azoles have multiple modes of action, some of which have not been explored yet. Identifying the off-target effects of fungicides by dissecting gene expression profiles in response to them can provide insights into their modes of action and possible mechanisms of fungicide resistance. Moreover it can also reveal additional targets for development of new fungicides. Hence, we analyzed the global gene expression profile of C. sativus on exposure to sub-lethal doses of propiconazole in a time series. The gene expression patterns were confirmed using quantitative reverse transcriptase PCR (qRT-PCR). This study revealed overexpression of target genes from the sterol biosynthesis pathway supporting the reported mode of resistance against azoles. In addition, some new potential targets have also been identified, which could be explored to develop new fungicides and plant protection strategies.",Obtaining Optimal Long-Term Outcomes from Liver Transplantation for Hepatocellular Cancer.,https://www.ncbi.nlm.nih.gov/pubmed/30840163,Digestive diseases and sciences,2019 04 08,"Liver transplantation is the definitive treatment for patients with end-stage liver disease. Liver transplantation is also the optimal treatment for patients with hepatocellular carcinoma (HCC), especially in the setting of chronic liver disease. Unfortunately, due to the worldwide shortage of organs, this treatment is not available for all patients with HCC. Strict selection criteria have been developed in order to obtain optimal results. A surgical perspective of the preoperative selection, perioperative management, and postoperative care of patients is reviewed in depth and provides an overview for obtaining optimal long-term results from liver transplantation for HCC. With rigorous selection and patient management, excellent long-term outcomes can be obtained with liver transplantation for patients with HCC.",Barriers and Facilitators of Rapid HIV and Syphilis Testing Uptake Among Filipino Transnational Migrants in China.,https://www.ncbi.nlm.nih.gov/pubmed/30840160,AIDS and behavior,2019 06 10,"Transnational migrant workers are known to be at high risk for HIV/STIs. This study estimated the point prevalence of HIV/syphilis and examined correlates of HIV/syphilis testing uptake among female migrant domestic workers in Macao, China. Data was obtained from 1363 female Filipino domestic workers who were offered free rapid HIV and syphilis testing. A mixed methods analysis was undertaken to examine correlates of testing and themes about reasons for not testing. Among 1164 women tested, there were no cases of HIV/syphilis observed and 199 (14.6%) refused HIV/syphilis testing. Greater social integration (aOR 1.12; 95% CI 1.02-1.24), having more than one sexual partner (aOR 1.65; 95% CI 1.02-2.65), and longer working hours on the testing day (aOR 0.97; 95% CI 0.94-1.00), were associated with testing uptake. Among those who tested, the majority (> 70%) had never tested before, suggesting the need to improve testing outreach. Qualitative themes about reasons for not testing included low perceived need and insufficient time. Individual and structural testing barriers should be reduced to optimize HIV/STI testing in migrant populations.",Intensive multidisciplinary management in critical care patients affected by severe necrotizing soft tissue infections: a cooperative method to improve the efficacy of treatment.,https://www.ncbi.nlm.nih.gov/pubmed/30840159,European journal of clinical microbiology & infectious diseases : official publication of the European Society of Clinical Microbiology,2019 05 20,"To illustrate the effectiveness of our intensive multidisciplinary management (IMM) in the treatment of severely ill patients with necrotizing soft tissue infections (NSTIs). A retrospective observational study was conducted in a general ICU. Thirty-two consecutive patients undergoing IMM were carefully compared with 30 consecutive patients receiving a standard management (SM). IMM combined intensive care management, early surgical debridement followed by daily inspection of surgical wounds, close microbiological surveillance, and targeted high-dose antibiotics. IMM was associated with the better decrease of daily SOFA score (p = 0.04). Also, IMM caused + 12% increase in the overall number of surgical procedures (p = 0.022) and a higher number of tissue biopsies/per day (median 0.63 versus 0.32; p = 0.025), leading to a more targeted antimicrobial changes (89.6% vs 51.6%; p < 0.00001). High-dose daptomycin (75% vs 36.7%; p = 0.002) and extended/continuous infusion of beta-lactams (75% vs 43.3%; p = 0.011) were more frequently utilized. A specific efficiency score correlated with the decrease of SOFA score (efficacy) in IMM patients only (p = 0.027). Finally, IMM was associated with a significant lower ICU mortality rate (15.6% vs 40%; p = 0.032). IMM was more effective than SM as it allowed the earlier control of infection and the faster reduction of multiple organ-dysfunction.",Evaluating the decisions of glioma patients regarding clinical trial participation: a retrospective single provider review.,https://www.ncbi.nlm.nih.gov/pubmed/30840157,"Medical oncology (Northwood, London, England)",2019 05 07,"Clinical trial accrual is vital to advancing care. A single study elucidated demographic data correlating with glioma patients' clinical trial enrollment. However, it did not investigate the underlying decision-making process for non-participation. In this study, we seek to understand this key aspect of patient accrual. All notes for glioma patients seen by a single neuro-oncologist from July 2010 to May 2017 were examined for mention of clinical trial offerings. When a trial was declined, the patient's reasoning was recorded along with the following: diagnosis, KPS, extent of resection, age, gender, race, marital status, income group, religion, trial offered at initial visit versus subsequent, and distance from trial site. Of 279 consecutive glioma patients, 88 were eligible for and offered a clinical trial. Fifty-seven accepted (65%), and 31 (35%) declined participation (Fig. 1). Of those offered a clinical trial, patients with glioblastoma (GBM) were significantly more likely to accept (44 out of 57 (77%) vs. 13 out of 57 (23%), p =0.03). After we adjusted for gender and travel distance, GBM was the only significant predictor of clinical trial acceptance, with an odds ratio of 3.18 (95% CI 1.17, 8.61, p =0.02). Reasons cited for non-participation included: travel distance (39%), lack of interest (39%), visit frequency (16%), and fear of randomization (6%). This study clarified for the first time individual glioma patient rationale for non-participation and potential areas for improving enrollment. Allowing off-site treatment centers or telemedicine visits may entice rural patients to participate. Visit frequency should be carefully considered and minimized whenever possible. Further prospective study of rationale for non-participation may improve enrollment over time.",The Current Role of Robotics in Colorectal Surgery.,https://www.ncbi.nlm.nih.gov/pubmed/30840156,Current gastroenterology reports,2019 03 10,"Despite the growth in laparoscopic surgery, comparable oncological outcomes, and reduced complication rates, the majority of colorectal surgery is still performed via an open approach.

Materials in medicine,2019 03 10,"It has been widely recognized that one of the critical limitations in biofabrication of functional tissues/organs is lack of vascular networks which provide tissues and organs with oxygen and nutrients. Biofabrication of 3D vascular-like constructs is a reasonable first step towards successful printing of functional tissues and organs. In this paper, a dynamic optical projection stereolithography system has been implemented to successfully fabricate 3D Y-shaped tubular constructs with living cells encapsulated. The effects of operating conditions on the cure depth of a single layer have been investigated, such as UV intensity, exposure time, and cell density. A phase diagram has been constructed to identify optimal operating conditions. Cell viability immediately after printing has been measured to be around 75%. Post-printing mechanical properties, swelling properties, and microstructures of the gelatin methacrylate hydrogels have been characterized. The resulting fabrication knowledge helps to effectively and efficiently print tissue-engineered vascular networks with complex geometries.","Assessing inhibitory activity of probiotic culture supernatants against Pseudomonas aeruginosa: a comparative methodology between agar diffusion, broth culture and microcalorimetry.",https://www.ncbi.nlm.nih.gov/pubmed/30840154,World journal of microbiology & biotechnology,2019 05 04,"Cell free supernatants (CFS) obtained from probiotic species are routinely used to preliminary investigate the antimicrobial activity of potential probiotic isolates by the agar well diffusion and broth culture. Both methods have documented limitations. In this work, the potential of isothermal microcalorimetry (IMC), a technique based on the measurement of heat produced by growing bacteria was used to investigate the antimicrobial effects of two commercial probiotic species (Lactobacillus acidophilus LA-5® and Bifidobacterium lactis BB-12®) and one reference strain (Bifidobacterium bifidum ATCC 11863) against Pseudomonas aeruginosa NCIMB 8628 using unmodified, neutralised and heat-treated CFS. P. aeruginosa was inhibited in growth by the unmodified CFS of all the species. No inhibitory activity was recorded for neutralised CFS of all the species using the agar well diffusion assay. Plate count during co-incubation of P. aeruginosa with the neutralised CFS of all the species showed no inhibition. However, IMC data showed significant inhibition with neutralised CFS obtained from the two Bifidobacterium species suggesting presence of other non-acidic inhibitory compounds in the CFS. The results in this work demonstrated that IMC has potential in probiotic bioassay as it has the capability to record in real-time and capture even subtle effects, which could be unnoticed with traditional assays.",Characteristics of chitosan-modified glass ionomer cement and their effects on the adhesion and proliferation of human gingival fibroblasts: an in vitro study.,https://www.ncbi.nlm.nih.gov/pubmed/30840153,Journal of materials science. Materials in medicine,2019 03 10,"This study explores the possibility of adhering gingival tissue to a root surface that was restored with chitosan (CS)-modified glass ionomer cement (GIC) in the case of gingival recessions associated with root caries, which provides a theoretical basis for clinical application at the cellular level. The specimens were mixed after integrating 1, 2, and 4 wt% CS into the GIC fluid. The characteristics and cytocompatibility were then examined. As more CS was incorporated into the GIC fluid, the mechanical properties and cytocompatibility of chitosan-modified glass ionomer cement (CS-GIC) first improved but then reduced. Under scanning electron microscopy, microcracks were observed on the surface of all materials, but the fewest microcracks were observed on the surface of 2 wt% CS-GIC. The compressive strength of 2 wt% CS-GIC was significantly higher than that of the other groups at 5 days (P < 0.05) and the addition of chitosan didn't change the basic fracture mode of materials. Additionally, the integration 2 wt% CS into GIC can obviously reduce acidity of the original GIC (P < 0.01) when using extracts with concentrations of 100 and 50%. The Cell Counting Kit-8 assay and adhesion and proliferation of human gingival fibroblasts (HGFs) on the surface of the materials indicated that 2 wt% CS-GIC presented better cytocompatibility and was more suitable for the growth of HGFs. In summary, 2 wt% CS-GIC could be considered as a potential root filling material to allow the adhesion and growth of gingival tissue.",Properties of reduced graphene/carbon nanotubes reinforced calcium phosphate bone cement in a microwave environment.,https://www.ncbi.nlm.nih.gov/pubmed/30840152,Journal of materials science.

Materials in medicine,2019 03 10,"Biobased hydrogels are considered to mimic native extracellular matrix due to their high water content and are considered as adequate matrices for cell encapsulation. However, the equilibrium degree of swelling (EDS) and stiffness of simple hydrogel formulations are typically confined: Increasing polymer concentration results in increasing stiffness and simultaneously decreasing EDS. The aim of this contribution was to decouple this standard correlation between polymer content, stiffness and EDS as well as the assembly of hydrogels with graded composition of hydrogels by layer-wise printing. We investigated two sets of formulations, which consisted of three different compositions with increasing total biopolymer concentration (10.6%, 11.5%, 13.0%). Within these compositions the amount of gelatin methacryloyl acetyl (GMA) was constant (10%), whereas the proportion of methacrylated hyaluronic acid and chondroitin sulfate increased. In the first set of formulations GMA with one fixed degree of methacryloylation (DM) was used, whereby the storage modulus (G') increased from ~10 to ~25 kPa and the EDS decreased from ~700 to ~600%. In the second set of formulations we gradually lowered the DM of the GMA in parallel to increase of polymer concentration and achieved an increase of both, G' from ~11 to ~18 kPa and EDS from ~690 to ~790%. By dispensing these compositions, we created a glycosaminoglycan-graded hydrogel. We proved the cytocompatibility of the dispensing process, the used photoinitiator lithium phenyl-2,4,6-trimethylbenzoylphosphinate, and layer-wise UVA irradiation. Glycosaminoglycan gradient was proved stable for 28 d,encapsulated chondrocytes were viable and produced new matrix.",Enhanced of antibacterial activity of antibiotic-functionalized silver nanocomposites with good biocompatibility.,https://www.ncbi.nlm.nih.gov/pubmed/30840138,Journal of materials science.

This study focused on the preparation of silver nanocomposites (AgNPs@Tob&PAGA) by modifying AgNPs with tobramycin (Tob) and carbohydrate polymer of poly(2-(acrylamido) glucopyranose) (PAGA). The enhanced antibacterial activities of nanocomposites against common pathogens of Escherichia coli (E. coli) and Staphylococcus aureus (S. aureus) were explored. The introduction of PAGA onto silver nanocomposites improved both citocompatibility and antibacterial activity. Compared with nude Tob, AgNPs@Tob&PAGA showed more fascinating antimicrobial effect against E. coli and S. aureus with about 20-fold increase in the antibacterial activity, simultaneously no detectable resistance was observed. Consequently, the silver nanocomposite as an antimicrobial agent presents promising prospects in the treatment of bacterial infections caused by antimicrobial resistant bacteria.",Assessment of the Food-Swallowing Process Using Bolus Visualisation and Manometry Simultaneously in a Device that Models Human Swallowing.,https://www.ncbi.nlm.nih.gov/pubmed/30840137,Dysphagia,2019 03 06,"The characteristics of the flows of boluses with different consistencies, i.e. different rheological properties, through the pharynx have not been fully elucidated. The results obtained using a novel in vitro device, the Gothenburg Throat, which allows simultaneous bolus flow visualisation and manometry assessments in the pharynx geometry, are presented, to explain the dependence of bolus flow on bolus consistency. Four different bolus consistencies of a commercial food thickener, 0.5, 1, 1.5 and 2 Pa s (at a shear rate of 50 s-1)-corresponding to a range from low honey-thick to pudding-thick consistencies on the National Dysphagia Diet (NDD) scale-were examined in the in vitro pharynx. The bolus velocities recorded in the simulator pharynx were in the range of 0.046-0.48 m/s, which is within the range reported in clinical studies. The corresponding wall shear rates associated with these velocities ranged from 13 s-1 (pudding consistency) to 209 s-1 (honey-thick consistency). The results of the in vitro manometry tests using different consistencies and bolus volumes were rather similar to those obtained in clinical studies. The in vitro device used in this study appears to be a valuable tool for pre-clinical analyses of thickened fluids.

Materials in medicine,2019 03 10,"In the last few years, additive manufacturing (AM) has been gaining great interest in the fabrication of complex structures for soft-to-hard tissues regeneration, with tailored porosity, and boosted structural, mechanical, and biological properties. 3D printing is one of the most known AM techniques in the field of biofabrication of tissues and organs. This technique opened up opportunities over the conventional ones, with the capability of creating replicable, customized, and functional structures that can ultimately promote effectively different tissues regeneration. The uppermost component of 3D printing is the bioink, i.e. a mixture of biomaterials that can also been laden with different cell types, and bioactive molecules. Important factors of the fabrication process include printing fidelity, stability, time, shear-thinning properties, mechanical strength and elasticity, as well as cell encapsulation and cell-compatible conditions. Collagen-based materials have been recognized as a promising choice to accomplish an ideal mimetic bioink for regeneration of several tissues with high cell-activating properties. This review presents the state-of-art of the current achievements on 3D printing using collagen-based materials for hard tissue engineering, particularly on the development of scaffolds for bone and cartilage repair/regeneration. The ultimate aim is to shed light on the requirements to successfully print collagen-based inks and the most relevant properties exhibited by the so fabricated scaffolds. In this regard, the adequate bioprinting parameters are addressed, as well as the main materials properties, namely physicochemical and mechanical properties, cell compatibility and commercial availability, covering hydrogels, microcarriers and decellularized matrix components. Furthermore, the fabrication of these bioinks with and without cells used in inkjet printing, laser-assisted printing, and direct in writing technologies are also overviewed.

Periprocedural anticoagulation management could decrease the risk of these complications. However, evaluation of the complications from pulmonary vein isolation using cryoballoon related to different anticoagulation strategies is limited. Therefore, we aimed to compare prothrombotic responses as assessed on the basis of D-dimer levels between the uninterrupted and interrupted apixaban therapies during cryoballoon ablation. Ninety-seven consecutive patients with paroxysmal AF scheduled to undergo cryoballoon ablation were randomly assigned in a 1:2 ratio to uninterrupted apixaban therapy (Group 1, n = 32) or interrupted apixaban therapy (Group 2, n = 65). D-Dimer levels were measured immediately before the ablation, at the end of the ablation, and 24 and 48 h after the procedure. No statistical difference was observed in the baseline characteristics between the two groups. The rates of hemorrhagic complications were similar in both groups (major bleeding: 3.1 vs. 1.5%; p = 0.61, and minor bleeding: 3.1 vs. 4.6%; p = 0.73, respectively). No thromboembolic events occurred in either group. However, D-dimer levels 48 h after the ablation increased more markedly following the procedure in Group 2 than in Group 1 (from 0.58 ± 0.16 to 1.01 ± 0.42 μg/mL vs. 0.58 ± 0.20 to 0.82 ± 0.25 μg/mL; p = 0.01). In conclusion, uninterrupted apixaban therapy during the periprocedural period of cryoballoon ablation for AF did not increase the risk of bleeding in this study and might reduce the periprocedural risk of subclinical hypercoagulable state."

Identification of genes that regulate conidiation would thus be of help in genetic reprogramming of these species to optimize sporulation. In this study, we constructed an SSH (suppression subtractive hybridization) library from RNA samples of the wild type strain and a non-conidiating mutant, M7, grown under constant illumination for 2 days. We identified several genes that are underexpressed in the mutant. Some of these genes are related to secondary metabolism, and a few could be associated with conidiation. Genes coding for the following proteins, among others, were identified: O-methyl transferase, ATPase, alpha/beta-hydrolase, WD repeat containing protein, dehydrogenase, thioesterase, translationally controlled tumour protein, and a proline-glycine-tyrosine-rich protein (PGYRP) that has been annotated in T.reesei as a signalling protein. Two of these genes, encoding Pgy1, a novel PGYRP, and Ecm33, a GPI-anchored cell wall protein, were further studied in detail by generation of deletion mutants. We demonstrate here that both these genes not only regulate radial growth and conidiation in Trichoderma virens, but are also involved in antagonism against soil-borne wide host range plant pathogens.

The central pathogenetic mechanism is characterized by the loss of immune tolerance against autoantigens of the cell nucleus, which can lead to renal inflammation via the formation of nuclear autoantibodies. The clinical manifestations of LN encompass nephritic syndrome with the special form of rapidly progressive glomerulonephritis, nephrotic syndrome and thrombotic microangiopathy. The diagnostic procedures consist of renal function and urine analysis as well as the determination of serum autoantibody profiles and complement components. An early renal biopsy enables a differentiation between the prognostically different forms of LN. In addition to supportive measures, a differentiated immunosuppressive treatment is the main approach for prognostically unfavorable forms. Important components are corticosteroids, cyclophosphamide and mycophenolate mofetil for induction treatment.

We hypothesized that personalized models developed from cardiac late gadolinium enhancement magnetic resonance imaging (LGE-MRI) could determine VT risk in patients with myocarditis using a previously-validated protocol. Personalized three-dimensional computational cardiac models were reconstructed from LGE-MRI scans of 12 patients diagnosed with myocarditis. Four patients with clinical VT and eight patients without VT were included in this retrospective analysis. In each model, we incorporated a personalized spatial distribution of fibrosis and myocardial fiber orientations. Then, VT inducibility was assessed in each model by pacing rapidly from 26 sites distributed throughout both ventricles. Sustained reentrant VT was induced from multiple pacing sites in all patients with clinical VT. In the eight patients without clinical VT, we were unable to induce sustained reentry in our simulations using rapid ventricular pacing.

A high diverse and abundant fungal community was found in the two soft corals. Furthermore, five isolates shared 83-95% similarity with their closest relatives, indicating that they might be novel species in genera Phaeoshaeria and Mucor. In addition, approximately 50% of the representative isolates exhibited distinct antifouling activity. In particular, isolates Fungal sp. SCAU132 and Fungal sp.

Recently, several studies put forward DNA methylation as a mechanism regulating seasonal timing of reproduction in both plants and animals. To understand the involvement of DNA methylation in seasonal timing of reproduction, it is necessary to examine within-individual temporal changes in DNA methylation, but such studies are very rare. Here, we use a temporal sampling approach to examine changes in DNA methylation throughout the breeding season in female great tits (Parus major) that were artificially selected for early timing of breeding. These females were housed in climate-controlled aviaries and subjected to two contrasting temperature treatments. Reduced representation bisulfite sequencing on red blood cell derived DNA showed genome-wide temporal changes in more than 40,000 out of the 522,643 CpG sites examined. Although most of these changes were relatively small (mean within-individual change of 6%), the sites that showed a temporal and treatment-specific response in DNA methylation are candidate sites of interest for future studies trying to understand the link between DNA methylation patterns and timing of reproduction.",Pediatric Neuroschistosomiasis: A Case Report and Review of the Literature.,https://www.ncbi.nlm.nih.gov/pubmed/30840073,Journal of the Pediatric Infectious Diseases Society,2019 03 06,Neuroschistosomiasis is a rare but severe manifestation of Schistosoma infection.

Modeling its invasion dynamics is valuable to guide management through early detection and prevention of further invasion. Herein, we initially estimated the spread rate of kudzu bug with county-level invasion records and then determined important spatial factors affecting its spread during years 2010-2016. As kudzu bug infests a large heterogeneous area and shows asymmetric spread, we first utilized spatially constrained clustering (SCC), an unsupervised machine learning method, to divide the infested area into eight spatially contiguous and environmentally homogenous neighborhoods. We then used distance regression and boundary displacement methods to estimate the spread rates in all neighborhoods. Finally, we applied multiple regression to determine spatial factors influencing the spread of kudzu bug. The average spread rate reached 76 km/yr by boundary displacement method; however, the rate varied largely among eight neighborhoods (45-144 km/yr). In the southern region of the infested area, host plant density and wind speed were positively associated with the spread rate, whereas mean annual temperature, precipitation in the fall, and elevation had inverse relationships. In the northern region, January minimum temperature, wind speed, and human population density showed positive relationships. This study increases the knowledge on the spread dynamics of kudzu bug. Our research highlights the utility of SCC to determine natural clustering in a large heterogeneous region for better modeling of local spread patterns and determining important factors affecting the invasions.",Sex-Biased lncRNAs Inversely Correlate With Sex-Opposite Gene Coexpression Networks in Diversity Outbred Mouse Liver.,https://www.ncbi.nlm.nih.gov/pubmed/30840070,Endocrinology,2019 04 12,"Sex differences in liver gene expression are determined by pituitary growth hormone secretion patterns, which regulate sex-dependent liver transcription factors and establish sex-specific chromatin states. Hypophysectomy (hypox) identifies two major classes of liver sex-biased genes, defined by their sex-dependent positive or negative responses to pituitary hormone ablation. However, the mechanisms that underlie each hypox-response class are unknown. We sought to discover candidate, regulatory, long noncoding RNAs (lncRNAs) controlling responsiveness to hypox. We characterized gene structures and expression patterns for 15,558 mouse liver-expressed lncRNAs, including many sex-specific lncRNAs regulated during postnatal development or subject to circadian regulation. Using the high natural allelic variance of Diversity Outbred (DO) mice, we discovered tightly coexpressed clusters of sex-specific protein-coding genes (gene modules) in male and female DO liver. Remarkably, many gene modules were strongly enriched for sex-specific genes within a single hypox-response class, indicating that the genetic heterogeneity of DO mice encompasses responsiveness to hypox. Moreover, several distant gene modules were enriched for gene subsets of the same hypox-response class, highlighting the complex regulation of hypox-responsiveness. Finally, we identified eight sex-specific lncRNAs with strong negative regulatory potential, as indicated by their strong negative correlation of expression across DO mouse livers with that of protein-coding gene modules enriched for genes of the opposite sex bias and inverse hypox-response class. These findings reveal an important role for genetic factors in regulating responsiveness to hypox, and present testable hypotheses for the roles of sex-biased liver lncRNAs in controlling the sex-bias of liver gene expression.",Substructured Population Growth in the Ashkenazi Jews Inferred with Approximate Bayesian Computation.,https://www.ncbi.nlm.nih.gov/pubmed/30840069,Molecular biology and evolution,2019 05 21,"The Ashkenazi Jews (AJ) are a population isolate sharing ancestry with both European and Middle Eastern populations that has likely resided in Central Europe since at least the tenth century. Between the 11th and 16th centuries, the AJ population expanded eastward leading to two culturally distinct communities in Western/Central and Eastern Europe. Our aim was to determine whether the western and eastern groups are genetically distinct, and if so, what demographic processes contributed to population differentiation. We used Approximate Bayesian Computation to choose among models of AJ history and to infer demographic parameter values, including divergence times, effective population sizes, and levels of gene flow. For the ABC analysis, we used allele frequency spectrum and identical by descent-based statistics to capture information on a wide timescale. We also mitigated the effects of ascertainment bias when performing ABC on SNP array data by jointly modeling and inferring SNP discovery. We found that the most likely model was population differentiation between Eastern and Western AJ ∼400 years ago. The differentiation between the Eastern and Western AJ could be attributed to more extreme population growth in the Eastern AJ (0.250 per generation) than the Western AJ (0.069 per generation).",Distribution and Genetic Diversity of Genes Involved in Quorum Sensing and Prodigiosin Biosynthesis in the Complete Genome Sequences of Serratia marcescens.,https://www.ncbi.nlm.nih.gov/pubmed/30840067,Genome biology and evolution,2019 04 11,"Quorum sensing is a cell density-dependent regulation of gene expression. N-acyl-l-homoserine lactone (AHL) is a major quorum-sensing signaling molecule in gram-negative bacteria and synthesized by the LuxI family protein. The genus Serratia is known as a producer of the red pigment, prodigiosin, whose biosynthesis is dependent on the pig gene cluster. Some Serratia strains regulate prodigiosin production via AHL-mediated quorum sensing, whereas there is red-pigmented Serratia strains without quorum-sensing system. In addition, nonpigmented Serratia marcescens, which does not produce prodigiosin, has also been isolated from natural and clinical environments. In this study, we aim to reveal the distribution and genetic diversity of quorum-sensing genes and pig gene cluster in the complete genome sequences of S. marcescens. We previously demonstrated that S. marcescens AS-1 regulates the production of prodigiosin via AHL-mediated quorum sensing. We sequenced the genomes of AS-1 and compared with the complete genomes of AS-1 and the other 34 strains of S. marcescens. The luxI homolog was present on 25 complete genome sequences. The deduced amino acid sequences of the luxI homolog were divided into three phylogenetic classes. In contrast, the pig gene cluster was present in the genome of seven S. marcescens strains and only two strains, AS-1 and N4-5 contained both the luxI homolog and pig gene cluster in their genome. It is therefore assumed that prodigiosin production and its regulation by quorum sensing are not essential for the life cycle of S. marcescens.","Cit1,2RhaT and two novel CitdGlcTs participate in flavor-related flavonoid metabolism during citrus fruit development.",https://www.ncbi.nlm.nih.gov/pubmed/30840066,Journal of experimental botany,2019 05 14,"Neohesperidosides are disaccharides that are present in some flavonoids and impart a bitter taste, which can significantly affect the commercial value of citrus fruits. In this study, we identified three flavonoid-7-O-di-glucosyltransferase (dGlcT) genes closely related to 1,2-rhamnosyltransferase (1,2RhaT) in citrus genomes. However, only 1,2RhaT was directly linked to the accumulation of neohesperidoside, as demonstrated by association analysis of 50 accessions and co-segregation analysis of an F1 population derived from Citrus reticulata × Poncirus trifoliata. In transgenic tobacco BY2 cells, over-expression of CitdGlcTs resulted in flavonoid-7-O-glucosides being catalysed into bitterless flavonoid-7-O-di-glucosides, whereas over-expression of Cit1,2RhaT converted the same substrate into bitter-tasting flavonoid-7-O-neohesperidoside. Unlike 1,2RhaT, during citrus fruit development the dGlcTs showed an opposite expression pattern to CHS and CHI, two genes encoding rate-limiting enzymes of flavonoid biosynthesis. An uncoupled availability of dGlcTs and substrates might result in trace accumulation of flavonoid-7-O-di-glucosides in the fruit of C. maxima (pummelo). Past human selection of the deletion and functional mutation of 1,2RhaT has led step-by-step to the evolution of the flavor-related metabolic network in citrus. Our research provides the basis for potentially improving the taste in citrus fruit through manipulation of the network by knocking-out 1,2RhaT or by enhancing the expression of dGlcT using genetic transformation."

This process results in a heart loop that is no longer planar with the inflow and outflow tracts now lying in adjacent planes. We investigate the biomechanics of s-looping and use modeling to understand the nonlinear and time variant morphogenetic shape changes. We developed physical and finite element models and validated the models using perturbation studies.

The kinetics of hydrazone exchange are optimal at pH ∼4.5, which limits the use of hydrazone-based dynamic combinatorial libraries, particularly for biological targets which are only stable at near-neutral pH values. It would thus be advantageous if hydrazone exchange proceeded with faster rates at pH values closer to neutral. We experimentally and computationally evaluated the hypothesis that hydrazones possessing neighbouring acidic or basic functional groups within the carbonyl-derived moitety of the hydrazone would enhance exchange rates. Our work suggests that judiciously placed N- or O-hydrogen bond acceptors within the carbonyl-derived moiety of the hydrazone stabilize transition states via hydrogen bonding interactions, providing a valuable boost to exchange kinetics at near-neutral pH values. We anticipate these findings will be of interest in dynamic combinatorial chemistry, dynamic covalent polymers/materials, functionalized nanoparticles and interlocked molecules, all of which may benefit from hydrazone exchange processes able to operate at near-neutral pH values.",Asymmetric total synthesis of (+)-asenapine.,https://www.ncbi.nlm.nih.gov/pubmed/30840011,Organic & biomolecular chemistry,2019 03 20,"Asymmetric total synthesis of (+)-asenapine, an atypical antipsychotic drug, used for treating schizophrenia and acute mania associated with bipolar disorder, is reported.

Approaches for the synthesis of high content filler polymer nanocomposites are suggested to facilitate future applications. The fabrication methods address the design of the polymer nanocomposite architecture, which encompasses one, two, and three dimensional morphologies. Factors that hamper the reinforcement of nanostructures, such as alignment, dispersion of the filler and interfacial bonding between the filler and polymer, are outlined. Using suitable approaches, maximum potential reinforcement of nanoscale fillers can be anticipated without limitations in orientation, dispersion, and the integrity of the filler particle-matrix interface.

Static properties are additionally calculated using the PC-SAFT equation of state. Force fields calibrated on water-free glyceline show predictive power for density and water activity over the entire composition range. In contrast, the PC-SAFT approach using pseudo one-component or two-component modelling strategies performed better for the density or the water activity, respectively. The MD simulations show that at low water content, the hydrogen-bond network between glycerol molecules as well as between glycerol and the cholinium cation is hardly affected by the water molecules while at higher water content, glycerol-glycerol hydrogen bonds are replaced by glycerol-water hydrogen bonds indicating the formation of an aqueous solution accompanied by a strong decrease of the shear viscosity. At the same time, the thermodynamic activity of water increases such that the MD simulations are able to guide the optimal composition with respect to requirements in biocatalytic applications such as low viscosity and low water activity.

Herein, we employed in situ X-ray absorption spectroscopy to study the dynamic valence state and local structure of RuO2 during the OER in both acidic and alkaline electrolytes. In the acidic electrolyte, the Ru center was reduced near the onset potential prior to launching the OER and was oxidized during the OER process, while the coordination numbers and the bond lengths of the Ru-O path also decreased as revealed by in situ EXAFS analysis. Besides, in the alkaline electrolyte, RuO2 showed a similar behavior as revealed under acidic conditions. These results provide an evident insight into the dynamic change of the RuO2 electrocatalyst during the OER.",Amperometric monitoring of vesicular dopamine release using a gold nanocone electrode.,https://www.ncbi.nlm.nih.gov/pubmed/30839997,"Chemical communications (Cambridge, England)",2019 03 19,We report a facile approach to fabricate a gold nanocone electrode for monitoring dopamine release from individual vesicles.

Here we report the design and syntheses of a novel class of histidine-containing hexapeptide derivatives (Nap-1 and ID-1) for in situ hydrogelation at the zinc ion-rich prostate tissue. Thanks to the efficient co-ordination between zinc and histidine, both Nap-1 and ID-1 displayed excellent self-assembly capability with a high sensitivity to zinc ions at ∼0.1 equivalency. To foster a prostate-specific drug delivery system (DDS), ID-1 was chosen for further conjugation with bicalutamide (BLT), a clinically used drug for prostate cancer. The as-synthesized ID-1-BLT retained the self-assembly capability with zinc ions, and conferred supramoelcular hydrogels at the prostate site. Interestingly, ID-1-BLT hydrogels demonstrated tunable drug release profiles in a typical tumor microenvironment, with acidic pH and esterase activity regulating the drug release in a dose dependent manner. Consequently, the hydrogel-based DDS demonstrated enhanced potency and selective cytotoxicity against prostate cancer cell DU145 over normal fibroblast cell NIH3T3, plausibly due to differential cellular uptake of drugs as well as the elevated esterase activities in cancer cells. Finally, the biocompatible hydrogel system demonstrated sustained delivery of drugs at the prostate gland of rats, with a superior in situ drug distribution profile compared to that of aqueous solution of BLT alone.",Gate-tuned conductance of graphene-ribbon junctions with nanoscale width variations.,https://www.ncbi.nlm.nih.gov/pubmed/30839984,Nanoscale,2019 03 15,"To utilize graphene as interconnection electrodes in high-density nanoelectronic structures, the electrical stability of graphene should be guaranteed under nanometer-scale deviations. Graphene-ribbon (GR) junctions with accessible dimensions (i.e., sub-micrometer widths) are used in diverse interconnection electrode applications and should be characterized properly if they are to be applied in high-density nanoelectronics. Analyzing the effects of nanoscale GR width variations on the conductance of the entire graphene electrode is necessary for their proper characterization. Here, we diagnose the conductance and thermal effect of graphene electrode junctions constructed from GRs of various widths and directions under gate-tuned voltages. On applying partial gate voltages, we identify the effect of local potential variance on the entire graphene electrode junction. As a result, we were able to perceive precise and minute conductance variations for the entire graphene electrode, arising mainly from different sub-micrometer-scale widths of the GRs, which could not be distinguished using conventional global gating methods.",Boosting the oxygen reduction activity of a nano-graphene catalyst by charge redistribution at the graphene-metal interface.,https://www.ncbi.nlm.nih.gov/pubmed/30839982,Nanoscale,2019 03 15,"N-Doped carbon materials have been intensively studied to replace Pt catalysts for the oxygen reduction reaction (ORR) in anion exchange membrane fuel cells (AEMFCs). However, the low doping level in these catalysts results in a limited number of ORR active sites, so high catalyst loading is still required. Hence, the electrode thickness becomes extra thick, causing large mass transfer resistance in AEMFCs. In this study, we propose a unique hybrid catalyst concept utilizing charge redistribution at the graphene-transition metal interface to modify the electronic structure of graphene and simultaneously create multiple carbon active sites. The hybrid catalyst consists of n-type nano-graphene shells (NGS) three-dimensionally coated on the surface of transition metal nanoparticles highly dispersed on carbon supports. The n-type NGS catalysts efficiently facilitate oxygen adsorption owing to facile charge transfer from the metal nanoparticles underneath and provide abundant active carbon sites owing to their structural benefits. As a result, despite the same catalyst loading, the NGS catalyst shows high ORR activity and greater durability than a carbon-supported Pt (Pt/C) catalyst.",Highly sensitive glutathione assay and intracellular imaging with functionalized semiconductor quantum dots.,https://www.ncbi.nlm.nih.gov/pubmed/30839981,Nanoscale,2019 04 29,"Glutathione (GSH) plays a vital role in biological systems and is associated with human pathology.

Herein, we report the in situ growth of manganese dioxide nanosheets (MnO2) on silica-coated semiconductor quantum dots (QD@SiO2), to prepare a stable and biocompatible fluorescent nanoprobe (QD@SiO2-MnO2) for the selective and sensitive detection of GSH. The modification of QD@SiO2 with MnO2 significantly quenched the fluorescence of CdSe/ZnS QDs, yet the addition of GSH efficiently recovered the fluorescence of the nanoprobe due to the decomposition of MnO2 by GSH. This nanosensor showed a rapid response to GSH with a low detection limit, and high selectivity towards GSH over potential interferences. Furthermore, the MnO2-engineered QDs had good biocompatibility and cellular uptake ability, and were successfully applied for the real-time imaging of intracellular GSH.

To understand the mechanical interplay between cells/intracellular membranous organelles and encapsulated rodlike materials, we perform theoretical analyses to investigate how the morphologies and mechanical behaviors of lipid vesicles of given relative volumes are regulated by encapsulated rigid nanorods of finite diameters and selected geometries, including a cylindrical nanorod, a nanorod with one widened end, and a cone-shaped nanorod. The contact between the vesicle protrusion and the sidewall of the rod, neglected in most theoretical studies, is shown to play an important role in regulating vesicle tubulation, membrane tension, and axial contact force on the nanorod. As the nanorod length increases, the confining vesicle evolves from a prolate into different shapes, such as a lemon, a conga drum, a cherry, and a bowling pin, depending on the radical size of the nanorod and the relative vesicle volume. The corresponding morphological phase diagrams are determined. Moreover, phase diagrams of the buckling of the encapsulated nanorods are determined based on the classical Euler buckling theory. It is shown that there exists an optimal filament number at which the encapsulated weakly cross-linked filament bundle maintains the largest length in a mechanically stable state. Similarities and differences between the nanorod packing in vesicles at a given pressure difference and a relative volume are discussed.

The analysis of the low-frequency current noise spectra revealed that the main electronic noise contribution arises from the resistance fluctuations due to internal dynamical defects of Ag nanofilaments. The resulting 0.01-1% current noise ratio, i.e. the total noise level with respect to the mean value of the current, is found to be universal: its magnitude only depends on the total resistance of the device, irrespective of the materials aspects of the surrounding solid electrolyte and of the specific filament formation procedure. Moreover, the resistance dependence of the current noise ratio also displays the diffusive to ballistic crossover, confirming that stable resistive switching operation utilizing Ag nanofilaments is not compromised even in truly atomic scale junctions by technologically impeding noise levels.",The role of shape disorder in the collective behaviour of aligned fibrous matter.,https://www.ncbi.nlm.nih.gov/pubmed/30839978,Soft matter,2019 03 21,"We study the compression of bundles of aligned macroscopic fibers with intrinsic shape disorder, as found in human hair and in many other natural and man-made systems.

In particular, the simplification of logical analysis to implement advanced logic diagnoses is still a critical challenge for DNA computing and bioelectronics. Here, we developed a magnetic bead/DNA system to construct a library of logic gates, enabling the sensing of multiplex target miRNAs. In this assay, the miRNA-catalyzed hairpin assembly (CHA) was successfully applied to construct two/three-input concatenated logic circuits with excellent specificity extended to design a highly sensitive multiplex detection system. Significantly, the CHA-based multiplex detection system can distinguish individual target miRNAs (such as miR-21, miR-155, and miR let-7a) under a logic function control, which presents great applications in the development of rapid and intelligent detection. Another novel feature is that the multiplex detection system can be reset by heating the output system and the magnetic separation of the computing modules. Overall, the proposed logic diagnostics with high amplification efficiency is simple, fast, low-cost, and resettable, and holds great promise in the development of biocomputing, multiparameter sensing, and intelligent disease diagnostics.",Structure optimization of perovskite quantum dot light-emitting diodes.,https://www.ncbi.nlm.nih.gov/pubmed/30839976,Nanoscale,2019 03 15,"Although all-inorganic perovskite light emitting diodes (PeLED) have satisfactory stability under an ambient atmosphere, producing devices with high performance is challenging. A device architecture with a reduced energy barrier between adjacent layers and optimized energy level alignment in the PeLED is critical to achieve high electroluminescence efficiency. In this study, we report the optimization of a CsPbBr3-based PeLED device structure with Li-doped TiO2 nanoparticles as the electron transport layer (ETL). Optimal Li doping balances charge carrier injection between the hole transport layer (HTL) and ETL, leading to superior performance in both devices. The turn-on voltages for devices with Li-doped TiO2 nanoparticles were significantly reduced from 7.7 V to 4.9 V and from 3 V to 2 V in the direct and inverted PeLED structures, respectively. The low turn-on voltage for green emission is one of the lowest values among the reported CsPbBr3-based PeLEDs. Further investigations show that the device with an inverted structure is superior to the device with a direct structure because the energy barrier for carrier injection was minimized. The inverted structure devices exhibited a current efficiency of 5.6 cd A-1 for the pristine TiO2 ETL, while it was 15.2 cd A-1 for the Li-doped TiO2 ETL, a factor of ∼2.7 enhancement at 5000 cd m-2.","Defect-related multicolour emissions in ZnO smoke: from violet, over green to yellow.",https://www.ncbi.nlm.nih.gov/pubmed/30839975,Nanoscale,2019 03 15,"The nature of defects in ZnO smoke was studied at different stages of the material's history by combining photoluminescence (PL) and electron paramagnetic resonance (EPR) spectroscopy. In contrast to studies previously reported on ZnO nanopowders, high vacuum conditions (P < 10-5 mbar) have been applied during sample storage, handling and spectroscopic investigations. Two pairs of violet-PL/EPR signals (2.88 eV/ g = 1.956 and 2.80 eV/ g = 1.960) were observed in the as-synthesized ZnO powder and attributed to surface (dominant) and bulk zinc interstitials (Zni+). Upon annealing in O2-poor conditions, green-PL emission (2.41 eV) and EPR signal at g = 2.002 develop along with EPR signals specific of superoxide radicals (O2-). In the absence of any external O2 supply, the oxygen necessary for the creation of a notable amount of O2- is provided by the lattice of ZnO smoke, so that the green emission and its EPR counterpart are unambiguously assigned to singly charged oxygen vacancies (VO+). Annealing at high PO2 results in a broad PL emission (∼2.07 eV) without an EPR counterpart. This yellow emission was assigned to peroxide-like surface species (O22-). Overall, this study shows that the visible emissions in ZnO smoke nanopowders can range from violet, over green to yellow as a function of sample history and that the corresponding PL/EPR fingerprints can serve as guidelines for the recognition of defects in other ZnO types."

However, their poor electrical conductivity, unstable cycling performance and unclear additional capacity are still great challenges. Herein, CoxMnyNizO (x : y : z = 8 : 0.92 : 0.71) nanosheets corresponding to the cubic CoO phase directly formed on a Cu foil (CMN-CH) were fabricated and directly tested as binder-free anode electrodes for lithium-ion batteries. The unique preparation of the electrode without a binder effectively accelerated the transfer of Li+ ions and electrons. Additionally, much more active sites were exposed to the electrolyte in the absence of additives (binder and conductive carbon). Metal vacancies and oxygen vacancies could be clearly observed in the crystal lattices, which were induced by doping Mn and Ni atoms in the CoO crystal lattices. The prepared CMN-CH electrode demonstrated superior capacities of 1501 mA h g-1 at 5 A g-1 after 1500 cycles and 823 mA h g-1 at 10 A g-1 after 1500 cycles, which are far beyond the theoretical capacity of CoO (716 mA h g-1) and surpass that of most CoO-based composites with carbon materials reported in the literature. The reversible conversion between Co2+ and Co3+ during the cycling process contributed greatly to the reversible capacity. Based on the obtained excellent electrochemical capacities, the prepared CMN-CH has great potential to be used as an anode electrode for lithium-ion batteries.",Dietary lysozyme supplementation contributes to enhanced intestinal functions and gut microflora of piglets.,https://www.ncbi.nlm.nih.gov/pubmed/30839962,Food & function,2019 03 20,"Lysozyme plays a significant role in defense against bacterial pathogens and in regulating the interactions between gut microbiota and host immune systems.

After the 14-day treatment, piglets supplemented with 1.0 g kg-1 lysozyme had higher average weaning weight, jejunal villus height (VH), and ileal lymphocyte counts than those in the control groups (P < 0.005). Serum total protein and albumin were significantly up-regulated (P < 0.005) and immunoglobulin G tended to increase in the 0.5 g kg-1 lysozyme group (P = 0.065). Bacteroidetes, Proteobacteria, and Fibrobacteres all showed a significant increase in relative abundance after lysozyme treatment at the highest dosage (P < 0.005). At the genus level, the relative abundance of Lactobacillus, Treponema_2, and Prevotellaceae_NK3B31_group was significantly increased in the lysozyme-treated groups. Furthermore, microbial genes related to glycerolipid, propanoate, and pyruvate metabolism showed much more abundance in the 1.0 g kg-1 lysozyme group. Interleukin-4 in the colonic mucosa was significantly up-regulated, while transforming growth factor-β1 showed significant reduction in the lysozyme-treated group.

However, the detailed microscopic mechanism of the improved formation of stereocomplex crystallites (SCs) in filled polylactides is still unclear. Therefore, we performed dynamic Monte Carlo simulations to reveal the underlying mechanism of the effect of two-dimensional nanofillers on the formation of SCs in polymer blends. It was observed that the nanofillers can lead to the occurrence of heterogeneous nucleation of mixed polymer chains. On one hand, the miscibility of mixed polymers is improved in the interfacial regions, attributed to attractive interactions between polymers and nanofillers. On the other hand, for the heterogeneous nucleation process, chains prefer to crystallize by means of intermolecular packing alignment. Both phenomena contribute to the promotion of SCs.","Hydrogen-bonded organo-amino phosphonium halides: dielectric, piezoelectric and possible ferroelectric properties.",https://www.ncbi.nlm.nih.gov/pubmed/30839960,"Dalton transactions (Cambridge, England : 2003)",2019 05 28,"Molecular ferroelectric materials are an exciting class of materials for potential applications in energy and electronics.

The phosphonium bromide salt was prepared by bromination of the phosphine precursor Ph2PCl and its subsequent treatment with isopropyl amine. The chloride and iodide salts were synthesized by the halogen exchange reaction of the bromide salt. The variable temperature single crystal X-ray analysis indicates the retention of the polar non-centrosymmetric phase of these materials for a wide range of temperatures from 100 to 400 K and above. All these assemblies were shown to exhibit 1D H-bonded chain structures along the crystallographic b-axis. The P-E loop measurements of these salts gave curves similar to those of non-linear leaky dielectric materials. However, the vertical piezoresponse force microscopy (V-PFM) analyses showed the existence of polarizable domain inversions indicating the possibility of ferroelectric behaviour in these materials. The temperature dependent dielectric measurements on these salts support the absence of phase transition temperatures in these assemblies. Also, bias-dependent PFM studies reveal their piezoelectric nature as the obtained converse piezoelectric coefficients are consistent with the d33 values obtained by the direct quasi-static methods.",Extraordinary optical fields in nanostructures: from sub-diffraction-limited optics to sensing and energy conversion.,https://www.ncbi.nlm.nih.gov/pubmed/30839959,Chemical Society reviews,2019 04 15,"Along with the rapid development of micro/nanofabrication technology, the past few decades have seen the flourishing emergence of subwavelength-structured materials and interfaces for optical field engineering at the nanoscale. Three remarkable properties associated with these subwavelength-structured materials are the squeezed optical fields beyond the diffraction limit, gradient optical fields in the subwavelength scale, and enhanced optical fields that are orders of magnitude greater than the incident field. These engineered optical fields have inspired fundamental and practical advances in both engineering optics and modern chemistry. The first property is the basis of sub-diffraction-limited imaging, lithography, and dense data storage. The second property has led to the emergence of a couple of thin and planar functional optical devices with a reduced footprint. The third one causes enhanced radiation (e.g., fluorescence), scattering (e.g., Raman scattering), and absorption (e.g., infrared absorption and circular dichroism), offering a unique platform for single-molecule-level biochemical sensing, and high-efficiency chemical reaction and energy conversion.

Here, we examine the relative merits of using either the fingerprint or the high frequency regions of the IR spectrum for tissue histopathology. We selected a complex model as a test case, evaluating both stromal and epithelial segmentation for various breast pathologies. IR spectral classification in each of these spectral windows is quantitatively assessed by estimating area under the curve (AUC) of the receiver operating characteristic curve (ROC) for pixel level accuracy and images for diagnostic ability. We found only small differences, though some that may be sufficiently important in diagnostic tasks to be clinically significant, between the two regions with the fingerprint region-based classifiers consistently emerging as more accurate. The work provides added evidence and comparison with fingerprint region, complex models, and previously untested tissue type (breast) - that the use of restricted spectral regions can provide high accuracy. Our study indicates that the fingerprint region is ideal for epithelial and stromal models to obtain high pixel level accuracies.

In this work, we perform a thorough investigation on the formation of surface oxides on Pd(211) using advanced first principles calculations. A detailed mechanism of the surface oxide formation is revealed: starting from simple O chemisorption, the step sites of Pd(211) are oxidized by formation of local linear O-Pd-O oxide structures and then planar Pd-O4 structures as the O coverage is increased; the local oxide structures spread out to yield a surface oxide layer, and finally 3-dimesional oxide forms with the increase of the degree of surface oxidation. The structures of O-Pd-O and Pd-O4 are revealed to be the basic units for oxide formation and can be considered as the oxide seeds. The origin of the oxide seed formation is identified, and the understanding of the oxide formation process is provided. A simple equation is derived, which describes the general trend of O vacancy formation in the oxides. The equation may be of great use for understanding oxide formation on Pd surfaces.",Standalone interferometry-based calibration of convex lens-induced confinement microscopy with nanoscale accuracy.,https://www.ncbi.nlm.nih.gov/pubmed/30839956,The Analyst,2019 04 15,"Strongly confined environments (confined dimensions between 1-100 nm) represent unique challenges and opportunities for understanding and manipulating molecular behavior due to the significant effects of electric double layers, high surface-area to volume ratios, and other phenomena at the nanoscale. Convex Lens-induced Confinement (CLiC) can be used to analyze the dynamics of individual molecules or particles confined in a planar slit geometry with continuously varying gap thickness. We describe an interferometry-based method for precise measurement of the slit pore geometry. Specifically, this approach permitted accurate characterization of separation distances as small as 5 nm, with 1 nm precision, without a priori knowledge or assumptions about the contact geometry, as well as a greatly simplified experimental setup that required only a lens, coverslip, and inverted microscope. The interferometry-based measurement of gap height offered a distinct advantage over conventional fluorescent dye-based methods; e.g., accurate interferometric height measurements were made at low gap heights regardless of solution conditions, while the concentration of fluorescent dye was significantly impacted by solution conditions such as ionic strength or pH. The accuracy of the interferometric measurements was demonstrated by comparing the experimentally measured concentration of a charged fluorescent dye as a function of gap thickness with dye concentration profiles calculated using Debye-Hückel theory. Accurate characterization of nanoscale gap thickness will enable researchers to study a variety of practical and biologically relevant systems within the CLiC geometry.",Synthesis and study of Au(iii)-indolizine derivatives: turn-on luminescence by photo-induced controlled release.,https://www.ncbi.nlm.nih.gov/pubmed/30839955,"Chemical communications (Cambridge, England)",2019 04 15,"The photo- and structural properties of a series of Au(iii) indolizine complexes were determined.

Achieving the optimal ORR performance would require fine tuning of the core composition and structure. Previous work studying the enhancement effects has primarily focused on core alloys with a cubic structure, (i.e. disordered alloy or L12 ordered structure) which limits the tuning to composition alone. In this work, using ab initio calculations, we have systemically investigated a new class of Pt0.5M0.5 (M = V, Cr, Fe, Co, Ni and Cu) core alloy that has a face-centered tetragonal L10 intermetallic structure. We have calculated the adsorption energies of O, OH and OOH on various Pt skins and the underlying tetragonally structured alloys, which allows us to not only predict the optimal number of pure Pt skin layers but also tune the activity of the catalysts toward the peak of the ORR volcano plot. More importantly, using adsorption energies on intermediate structures, we are able to decompose the enhancement factor into the ligand, normal and shear strain effects, and reveal the significant contribution of the shear strain that is only possible with a tetragonal core but not a cubic one. Our results point to a new direction in designing tetragonally structured intermetallic core-shell nanoparticles for ORR applications."

However, this control method poses a negative impact on the poultry industry. In addition, the pathogenicity and transmissibility of the H5N6 in both the birds and the humans remain largely unknown which call for the necessity to develop more strategic control methods for the virus. In this study, we constructed a mathematical model for the bilinear and half-saturated incidence to compare their corresponding effect on transmission dynamics of H5N6. The simulations of half-saturated incidence model were similar to what occurred during the H5N6 outbreak (2017) in the Philippines. Instead of culling the birds, we implemented other control strategies such as non-medicinal (personal protection and poultry isolation) and medicinal (poultry vaccination) ways to prevent, reduce, and control the rate of the H5N6 virus transmission. Among the proposed control strategies, we have shown that the poultry isolation strategy is still the most effective in reducing the infected birds.",Factors of early protective action of live influenza vaccine combined with recombinant bacterial polypeptides against homologous and heterologous influenza infection.,https://www.ncbi.nlm.nih.gov/pubmed/30839941,Heliyon,2019 03 08,"We are developing an associated vaccine based on live influenza vaccine (LAIV) and streptococcal recombinant peptides. The recombinant group B streptococcus (GBS) peptides P6 and ScaAB demonstrated a distinguished immunomodulating effect in THP-1 cells. The increase in IFN 1-alpha expression after ScaAB inoculation was similar to that against LAIV. We immunized mice intranasal using of A/H7N3 LAIV or/and ScaAB peptide. At day 5 after immunization, we detected serum IgM which reacted with non-vaccine influenza viruses. Associated vaccination of mice using LAIV and GBS peptide was the most effective against sub-lethal infection with A/H7N9 influenza virus and against lethal challenge with A/H1N1pdm virus at day 5 after immunization. Not only LAIV but also the ScaAB protected about 20% of the immunized animals against lethal challenge with A/H1N1pdm virus. The early protection was related to increasing type 1 interferons expression in the lungs. Our results in mice have shown that successful protection against homologous and heterologous influenza infections can be achieved soon after vaccination with either LAIV or LAIV in combination with GBS recombinant peptide. Presumably, such protection may be mediated by non-specific IgM antibodies and an increase in the expression of early cytokines in the airway.",Establishment and evaluation of a novel mouse model of peri/postmenopausal depression.,https://www.ncbi.nlm.nih.gov/pubmed/30839939,Heliyon,2019 03 08,"Women are believed to be more vulnerable to develop depressive symptoms during the perimenopause compared to postmenopause. The traditional bilateral ovariectomy and chronic mild stress (CMS) stimulation animal model produces a postmenopausal depressive-like state but the transition from perimenopausal period to postmenopausal period was ignored. Thus we establish a novel animal model in which the mice were stimulated by CMS for three months and removed the ovaries by two-step operation, and then evaluate whether this novel model could be much better for preclinical study used as a peri/postmenopause depressive model. The present study systemically evaluated the changes induced by two-step ovariectomy plus CMS in the mice. The depression-like behaviors, the levels of corticosterone, estrogen, pro-inflammatory factors, neurotransmitters, as well as brain-derived neurotrophic factor were determined; the changes of estrogen receptors, serotonin receptors, uterine weight and bone microarchitecture were also observed. The results show that the behaviors and biochemical indexes of mice changed gradually over time.

Parasitic diseases which increase the death rate of the hosts proportional to the integer number of parasites present were described by integral equations for the generating function of the age- and time-dependent number of parasites. A model was derived for a population structured by the continuous level of parasitic infection. Stimulated by the spread of AIDS a new class of epidemic models was developed which take into account explicitly the formation and separation of pairs. For predator-prey populations with parasitic infections threshold conditions for the persistence of the predator were derived. The interaction of epidemics and demography was analysed. Several epidemiological conditions led to backward bifurcations associated with multiple infective stationary states.,Selective electron beam melting of Al0.5CrMoNbTa0.5 high entropy alloys using elemental powder blend.,https://www.ncbi.nlm.nih.gov/pubmed/30839937,Heliyon,2019 03 08,"High Entropy Alloys (HEAs) is a novel promising class of multi-component materials which may demonstrate superior mechanical properties useful for high-temperature applications. Despite the high potential of HEAs, their production is complicated, using pre-alloyed powders in powder metallurgy route. This significantly complicates development and implementation of refractory BCC solid solution based HEAs. The present paper reports on experiments aiming at production of Al0.5CrMoNbTa0.5 multi-principle alloy using powder bed beam based additive manufacturing. Samples were manufactured using Selective Electron Beam Melting (SEBM) additive manufacturing technique from a blend of elemental powders aiming at achieving microstructure with high configurational entropy. Though it was not possible to achieve completely homogeneous microstructure, the as-printed material was composed of the zones with two multi-component solid solutions, which differed only by Al content confirming in situ alloying. The process parameters optimization was not carried out and the as-print material contained a notable amount of residual porosity. It was possible to reach lower porosity level using heat treatment at 1300 °C for 24 hours, however undesirable alloy composition changes took place. The main conclusion is that the production of the Al0.5CrMoNbTa0.5 multi-principle alloy from elemental powder blends using SEBM technique is achievable, but the process parameter optimization rather than post-process heat treatment should be performed to reduce the porosity of samples.",Modelling the dynamics of population viral load measures under HIV treatment as prevention.,https://www.ncbi.nlm.nih.gov/pubmed/30839936,Infectious Disease Modelling,2019 03 08,"In 2011 the Centers for Disease Control and Prevention (CDC) published guidelines for the use of population viral load (PVL), community viral load (CVL) and monitored viral load (MVL), defined as the average viral load (VL) of all HIV infected individuals in a population, of all diagnosed individuals, and of all individuals on antiretroviral treatment (ART), respectively. Since then, CVL has been used to assess the effectiveness of ART on HIV transmission and as a proxy for HIV incidence. The first objective of this study was to investigate how aggregate VL measures change with the HIV epidemic phase and the drivers behind these changes using a mathematical transmission model. Secondly, we aimed to give some insight into how well CVL correlates with HIV incidence during the course of the epidemic and roll out of ART. We developed a compartmental model for disease progression and HIV transmission with disease stages that differ in viral loads for epidemiological scenarios relevant to a concentrated epidemic in a population of men who have sex with men (MSM) in Western Europe (WE) and to a generalized epidemic in a heterosexual population in Sub-Saharan Africa (SSA). The model predicts that PVL and CVL change with the epidemic phase, while MVL stays constant. These dynamics are linked to the dynamics of infected subgroups (undiagnosed, diagnosed untreated and treated) in different disease stages (primary, chronic and AIDS). In particular, CVL decreases through all epidemic stages: before ART, since chronic population builds up faster than AIDS population and after ART, due to the build-up of treated population with low VL. The trends in CVL and incidence can be both opposing and coinciding depending on the epidemic phase. Before ART is scaled up to sufficiently high levels, incidence increases while CVL decreases. After this point, CVL is a useful indicator of changes in HIV incidence. The model predicts that during the ART scale-up HIV transmission is driven by undiagnosed and diagnosed untreated individuals, and that new infections decline due to the increase in the number of treated. Although CVL is not able to capture the contribution of undiagnosed population to HIV transmission, it declines due to the increase of people on ART too. In the scenarios described by our model, the present epidemic phase corresponds to declining trends in CVL and incidence.",3D energy frameworks of dimethylbenzophenone tetramorphs.,https://www.ncbi.nlm.nih.gov/pubmed/30839935,Heliyon,2019 03 08,"The tetramorphth crystals of 4,4-dimethylbenzophenone (D) were obtained using slow-evaporation crystallization method and the structure is elucidated using single crystal X-ray diffraction technique.

In this context, the present research was designed to study the effects of fenugreek sprouts juice (FS), barley sprouts juice (BS), cell-free probiotic extract (cell-free PE), whey protein hydrolysate (WPH) and their mixture on diabetic rats. Free radical scavenging activity, total phenolic contents (TPC) and total flavonoid contents (TFC) of each item mentioned were determined. Diabetes was induced through the injection of male rats with a single intraperitoneal dose (45 mg/kg) of streptozotocin. After the development of diabetes, diabetic rats were orally administered daily with 1ml of with fenugreek sprouts juice, barley sprouts juice, cell-free probiotic extract, whey protein hydrolysate or their mixture until the end of the study period (45 day). Oral administration of fenugreek sprouts juice, barley sprouts juice, cell-free probiotic extract, whey protein hydrolysate and their mixture to diabetic rats significantly reduced fasting blood glucose levels and improved the lipid profile. All the studied items limit the reductions of haemoglobin concentrations and plasma α-amylase activities. Also all the studied items suppressed the elevation of malondialdehyde values and the reduction of catalase activities. Histopathological investigation of pancreas, liver and kidneys of the diabetic rats showed histological alterations. On the other hand, supplementations with the tested materials lead to relieving these injuries.

We present and analyse a model of infectious disease transmission where primary and secondary infections are distinguished to examine the interplay between infection and immunity. Additionally we allow the duration of infection-acquired immunity to differ from that of vaccine-acquired immunity to explore the impact on long-term disease patterns and prevalence of infection in the presence of immune boosting. Our model demonstrates that vaccination may induce cyclic behaviour, and the ability of vaccinations to reduce primary infections may not lead to decreased transmission. Where the boosting of vaccine-acquired immunity delays a primary infection, the driver of transmission largely remains primary infections. In contrast, if the immune boosting bypasses a primary infection, secondary infections become the main driver of transmission under a sufficiently long duration of immunity. Our results show that the epidemiological patterns of an infectious disease may change considerably when the duration of vaccine-acquired immunity differs from that of infection-acquired immunity. Our study highlights that for any particular disease and associated vaccine, a detailed understanding of the waning and boosting of immunity and how the duration of protection is influenced by infection prevalence are important as we seek to optimise vaccination strategies.",Laser processing of Ti6Al4V alloy: wetting state of surface and environmental dust effects.,https://www.ncbi.nlm.nih.gov/pubmed/30839931,Heliyon,2019 03 08,"Laser processing of Ti6Al4V alloy surface, via repetitive pulses, is realized incorporating the nitrogen assisting gas. The texture characteristics of the surface and wetting state are analyzed. The free energy of the laser treated surface is estimated. The influence of the dust particles on the treated and untreated surfaces is examined. The solution formed due to water condensate on the dust particles is evaluated. The adhesion of the mud dried solution on the treated and untreated surfaces is assessed through determining the tangential force required for the removal of the solution from the surface. The findings demonstrate that the high power laser repetitive pulse heating results in formation of the hieratically distributed micro/nano pillars on the workpiece surface. The wetting state of the processed surface remains hydrophilic because of the large gap size between the micro/nano pillars. The free energy of the laser textured surface is similar to that obtained for the TiN coated surfaces, which is because of the nitride compounds developed during the processing. The dried liquid solution strongly adheres at the surface and the force needed for removing the dried liquid solution is almost four times of the friction force at the surface. The liquid solution gives rise to locally scattered shallow pit sites on as received surface. This phenomenon does not occur for the laser treated surface, which is related to the passive layer developed on the surface."

It has recently been reported that autonomic nervous activity, which is expressed as total heart rate variability (HRV) power, is associated with, and can be used as an objective measure of, mental and physical fatigue. Total HRV power (log (LF + HF)) has been shown to decline with ageing, and thus cannot be utilized as a fatigue index in populations with a different age composition. In the present study, we devised standard scores (deviation value) for autonomic nervous activity corrected for individual age calculated from the distribution of such activity in individual age cohorts. This allowed us to accurately evaluate an individual's autonomic nervous activity, even when that individual was part of a group with members of different ages. Standard scores were quantified using autonomic nervous function data gathered from 1,969 healthy individuals (age range 20-77 years). The efficacy of this method in mental health screening was investigated by evaluating both autonomic nervous function and subjective levels of fatigue among corporate workers. Based on results from the Brief Job Stress Questionnaire recommended by the research team of the Ministry of Health, Labour and Welfare, 103 participants were divided into two groups (a high-stress group [n = 17] and a non-high-stress group [n = 86]). Visual analog scale (VAS) scores for all fatigue-related symptoms were significantly higher among the high-stress than among the non-high-stress group (p < 0.01). The mean standard score for autonomic nervous activity was 56.3 for the non-high-stress group. The score for the high-stress group was significantly lower, at 47.9 (p < 0.01), indicating that autonomic nervous function was reduced among participants who experienced high stress. According to an analysis of raw and standard scores in each domain, autonomic nervous activity did not significantly correlate with stress-causing factors (e.g., overwork) or other factors affecting stress responses (e.g., support from supervisors and colleagues), but did exhibit a significant positive correlation with physical and mental responses to stress (r = 0.334, p < 0.01). Lower raw scores for mental and physical responses to stress represent stronger subjective symptoms. Moreover, greater stress responses were found to be associated with lower standard scores for autonomic nervous activity. In terms of fatigue-related symptoms rated using the VAS, autonomic nervous activity negatively correlated with mental stress, physical stress, fatigue/malaise, depressed mood, anxiety/fear, tension, irritation/anger, cognitive decline, and muscle/joint/general pain, and positively correlated with motivation/vitality. Reduced autonomic nervous activity was observed with high stress, confirming that standard scores for autonomic nervous activity are associated with mental and physical responses to stress and subjective fatigue-related symptoms. These results indicate that the evaluation of autonomic nervous activity using standard scores (deviation value) is a useful tool for the objective measurement of fatigue state, even in groups with members of different ages, and can be applied as a useful objective health index to evaluate industrial fatigue.",Dynamic model of tuberculosis considering multi-drug resistance and their applications.,https://www.ncbi.nlm.nih.gov/pubmed/30839915,Infectious Disease Modelling,2019 03 08,"Infectious diseases have always been a problem that threatens people's health and tuberculosis is one of the major.

We recently introduced a single equation model (the incidence decay with exponential adjustment, or IDEA model) that can be used for short-term epidemiological forecasting. In the mid-19th century, Dr. William Farr made the observation that epidemic events rise and fall in a roughly symmetrical pattern that can be approximated by a bell-shaped curve. He noticed that this time-evolution behavior could be captured by a single mathematical formula (""Farr's law"") that could be used for epidemic forecasting. We show here that the IDEA model follows Farr's law, and show that for intuitive assumptions, Farr's Law can be derived from the IDEA model. Moreover, we show that both mathematical approaches, Farr's Law and the IDEA model, resemble solutions of a susceptible-infectious-removed (SIR) compartmental differential-equation model in an asymptotic limit, where the changes of disease transmission respond to control measures, and not only to the depletion of susceptible individuals. This suggests that the concept of the reproduction number

Via the resource-based view model (RBV), it was hypothesized that each capability (i.e., entrepreneurship, motivation, investment, and adaptation) is positively related to Cyprus' government achievement of higher performance. It was also hypothesized that performance is positively related to prosperity. Data collected from 200 Cypriot citizens, aged 18 or over. Using correlation analysis, the study shows that entrepreneurial and adaptive capabilities have a statistical strong positive relationship with performance. In turn, performance has a strong positive relationship with prosperity. Several implications can be drawn from this study's findings for democratic governments and interesting directions for future research are provided.",A primer on the use of probability generating functions in infectious disease modeling.,https://www.ncbi.nlm.nih.gov/pubmed/30839899,Infectious Disease Modelling,2019 03 08,"We explore the application of probability generating functions (PGFs) to invasive processes, focusing on infectious disease introduced into large populations. Our goal is to acquaint the reader with applications of PGFs, moreso than to derive new results. PGFs help predict a number of properties about early outbreak behavior while the population is still effectively infinite, including the probability of an epidemic, the size distribution after some number of generations, and the cumulative size distribution of non-epidemic outbreaks. We show how PGFs can be used in both discrete-time and continuous-time settings, and discuss how to use these results to infer disease parameters from observed outbreaks. In the large population limit for susceptible-infected-recovered (SIR) epidemics PGFs lead to survival-function based models that are equivalent to the usual mass-action SIR models but with fewer ODEs. We use these to explore properties such as the final size of epidemics or even the dynamics once stochastic effects are negligible. We target this primer at biologists and public health researchers with mathematical modeling experience who want to learn how to apply PGFs to invasive diseases, but it could also be used in an applications-based mathematics course on PGFs. We include many exercises to help demonstrate concepts and to give practice applying the results. We summarize our main results in a few tables. Additionally we provide a small python package which performs many of the relevant calculations."

Mathematical, physical, and engineering sciences",2019 03 08,"Data-driven discovery of dynamics via machine learning is pushing the frontiers of modelling and control efforts, providing a tremendous opportunity to extend the reach of model predictive control (MPC). However, many leading methods in machine learning, such as neural networks (NN), require large volumes of training data, may not be interpretable, do not easily include known constraints and symmetries, and may not generalize beyond the attractor where models are trained. These factors limit their use for the online identification of a model in the low-data limit, for example following an abrupt change to the system dynamics. In this work, we extend the recent sparse identification of nonlinear dynamics (SINDY) modelling procedure to include the effects of actuation and demonstrate the ability of these models to enhance the performance of MPC, based on limited, noisy data. SINDY models are parsimonious, identifying the fewest terms in the model needed to explain the data, making them interpretable and generalizable. We show that the resulting SINDY-MPC framework has higher performance, requires significantly less data, and is more computationally efficient and robust to noise than NN models, making it viable for online training and execution in response to rapid system changes. SINDY-MPC also shows improved performance over linear data-driven models, although linear models may provide a stopgap until enough data is available for SINDY. SINDY-MPC is demonstrated on a variety of dynamical systems with different challenges, including the chaotic Lorenz system, a simple model for flight control of an F8 aircraft, and an HIV model incorporating drug treatment.","Antioxidant, physicochemical, microbiological, and sensory properties of probiotic yoghurt incorporated with various Annona species pulp.",https://www.ncbi.nlm.nih.gov/pubmed/30839857,Heliyon,2019 03 08,"In this study, antioxidant, chemical, microbiological, and sensory attributes changes taking place during the production of probiotic yoghurt using pulp of soursop (Annona muricata), sweetsop (Annona squamosa), and custard apple (Annona reticulata) were evaluated. The products were stored at 4 °C for 28 d, during which time physicochemical properties and viability of probiotic bacteria and yoghurt starter cultures were evaluated weekly. Yoghurts prepared with fruit pulps displayed higher antioxidant activities on the first day of storage compared to the control. During the storage, the addition of fruit pulps influenced (p < 0.05) pH, titratable acidity, syneresis and counts of B. animalis ssp. lactis BB-12 of yoghurts, whereas counts of Streptococcus thermophiles and Lactobacillus delbrueckii ssp. bulgaricus were found to be insignificant. Sensory evaluation results showed that yoghurt containing soursop fruit pulp had better sensory scores than other treatments. Therefore, these results proved that soursop can be used to produce probiotic yoghurt with enhanced physicochemical, microbiological and sensory properties.",Energy efficiency measures in buildings for achieving sustainable development goals.,https://www.ncbi.nlm.nih.gov/pubmed/30839852,Heliyon,2019 03 08,"Governments, worldwide, are committed to achieving sustainable development goals (SDGs). In a context where urban agglomerates consume roughly 80% of the global energy, of which buildings account for 40%, energy-efficient buildings can make a significant contribution to meeting SDGs 11 and 13. Currently, the implementation of energy efficiency measures (EEMs) in building is constrained by socioeconomic and technical barriers. Using empirical survey data, the drivers that affect both the supply of and demand for EEMs were identified. These drivers were then categorized within four clusters according to their importance in meeting supply and demand priorities. The following critical drivers were identified: standardization, low transaction costs, energy prices, and stability of the regulatory framework. The findings indicated that an effective energy policy provides consumers with reliable information and project developers with a stable regulatory environment. Investment behavior is rational and responsive to reliable information that prompts a switch toward sustainable building choices.","Origin and residence time of shallow groundwater resources in Lagos coastal basin, south-west Nigeria: An isotopic approach.",https://www.ncbi.nlm.nih.gov/pubmed/30839849,Heliyon,2019 03 08,"Knowledge of the source of water in the Lagos coastal basin (LCB) groundwater system was to be found vital to the future development and management of the system. Stable and radioactive isotopic measurements have been employed to unravel the source of recharge and residence time of the shallow groundwater system, based on the sampling conducted in 2016 and 2017 on groundwater, surface water and rainfall. The concentration of tritium in the groundwater samples were very low and ranged from less than 1 to 2.8 TU, while measured 14C contents ranged from 59.1 to 88 pMC. The δ18O values of groundwater samples ranged from 4.81 and 3.98 ‰, while the δ2H values ranged from -24.75 and -19.70 ‰ for the wet and dry seasons, respectively. The obtained results indicated non-existence of paleo recharge; rather all groundwater in the basin were found to be essentially of meteoric origin with intermittent surface water contributions. Moreover, shallow groundwater and surface water have considerable variations in isotopic compositions, reflecting evaporation and preservation of seasonal fluctuation. Though there was an observed generally low tritium content, however, it proved useful in the identification of recent active recharge taking place across the basin. The deduced radiocarbon age reflected the presence of ""modern water"" and thus supports the presence of present recharge to the groundwater system. Therefore, the source of the shallow groundwater recharge was actively renewable particularly during the wet season and thus water exploitation is potentially sustainable in the basin.",Child health care coverage and reductions in child physical abuse.,https://www.ncbi.nlm.nih.gov/pubmed/30839846,Heliyon,2019 03 08,"Children in the United States suffered almost 118,000 cases of physical abuse in 2015. One factor that might help decrease child physical abuse is health care coverage. This paper presents a justification for a link between health care coverage and reductions in child physical abuse and, though it does not assess specific causal mechanisms, examines evidence for such a connection. The paper uses panel data linear regression analysis to explore state level physical abuse and health care coverage rates. Findings indicate a statistically significant relationship between increases in child health care coverage rates, including both private coverage and Medicaid coverage, and decreases in child physical abuse.",Generating multibreather vector solitons by influencing the Manakov model and its modified forms with the linear self and cross coupling parameters.,https://www.ncbi.nlm.nih.gov/pubmed/30839844,Heliyon,2019 03 08,"We have realized for the first time the multibreather vector multi-solitons supporting collision dynamics with many interaction effects (namely reflection, attraction, beating, etc., effects) associated with the coupled nonlinear Schrödinger family equations having multiple applications. Such effects can be suppressed or enhanced by using the soliton parameters. Here each colliding multibreather vector one-soliton is composed with many soliton and antisoliton parts. Our solutions have freedom to control the number of soliton and antisoliton parts used to compose a vector one-soliton with a definite breathing length. It is also interesting to observe that the breathing maps associated with the obtained solutions depend on their free parameters and also the system parameters. All such investigations help us to realize different breathing mechanisms (namely pedaling, toggling, symmetric compression, symmetric elongation, asymmetric compression, asymmetric elongation, etc.) supported by the colliding one-solitons. An existing breathing mechanism of a given vector breather one-soliton can be suppressed or switched into another mechanism by tuning certain parameters appropriately. Because of such features we believe that this kind of study will further give impetus on the Lindner-Fedyanin system in the continuum limit, and find the potential applications in fiber coupler and also in Bose-Einstein condensates.",Strategies for data acquisition using ultrasonic phased arrays.,https://www.ncbi.nlm.nih.gov/pubmed/30839841,"Proceedings. Mathematical, physical, and engineering sciences",2019 03 08,"Ultrasonic phased arrays have produced major benefits in a range of fields, from medical imaging to non-destructive evaluation. The maximum information, which can be measured by an array, corresponds to the Full Matrix Capture (FMC) data acquisition technique and contains all possible combinations of transmitter-receiver signals. However, this method is not fast enough for some applications and can result in a very large volume of data. In this paper, the problem of optimal array data acquisition strategy is considered, that is, how to make the minimum number of array measurements without loss of information. The main result is that under the single scattering assumption the FMC dataset has a specific sparse structure, and this property can be used to design an optimal data acquisition method. An analytical relationship between the minimum number of array firings, maximum steering angle and signal-to-noise ratio is derived, and validated experimentally. An important conclusion is that the optimal number of emissions decreases when the angular aperture of the array increases. It is also shown that plane wave imaging data are equivalent to the FMC dataset, but requires up to an order of magnitude fewer array firings.",Determination of the instantaneous geostrophic flow within the three-dimensional magnetostrophic regime.,https://www.ncbi.nlm.nih.gov/pubmed/30839837,"Proceedings. Mathematical, physical, and engineering sciences",2019 03 08,"In his seminal work, Taylor (1963 Proc. R. Soc. Lond. A274, 274-283. (doi:10.1098/rspa.1963.0130).) argued that the geophysically relevant limit for dynamo action within the outer core is one of negligibly small inertia and viscosity in the magnetohydrodynamic equations. Within this limit, he showed the existence of a necessary condition, now well known as Taylor's constraint, which requires that the cylindrically averaged Lorentz torque must everywhere vanish; magnetic fields that satisfy this condition are termed Taylor states. Taylor further showed that the requirement of this constraint being continuously satisfied through time prescribes the evolution of the geostrophic flow, the cylindrically averaged azimuthal flow. We show that Taylor's original prescription for the geostrophic flow, as satisfying a given second-order ordinary differential equation, is only valid for a small subset of Taylor states. An incomplete treatment of the boundary conditions renders his equation generally incorrect. Here, by taking proper account of the boundaries, we describe a generalization of Taylor's method that enables correct evaluation of the instantaneous geostrophic flow for any three-dimensional Taylor state. We present the first full-sphere examples of geostrophic flows driven by non-axisymmetric Taylor states. Although in axisymmetry the geostrophic flow admits a mild logarithmic singularity on the rotation axis, in the fully three-dimensional case we show that this is absent and indeed the geostrophic flow appears to be everywhere regular.",Impacts of natural and human drivers on the multi-decadal morphological evolution of tidally-influenced deltas.,https://www.ncbi.nlm.nih.gov/pubmed/30839833,"Proceedings. Mathematical, physical, and engineering sciences",2019 03 08,"The world's deltas are at risk of being drowned due to rising relative sea levels as a result of climate change, decreasing supplies of fluvial sediment, and human responses to these changes. This paper analyses how delta morphology evolves over multi-decadal timescales under environmental change using a process-based model. Model simulations over 102 years are used to explore the influence of three key classes of environmental change, both individually and in combination: (i) varying combinations of fluvial water and sediment discharges; (ii) varying rates of relative sea-level rise; and (iii) selected human interventions within the delta, comprising polder-dykes and cross-dams. The results indicate that tidal asymmetry and rate of sediment supply together affect residual flows and delta morphodynamics (indicated by sub-aerial delta area, rates of progradation and aggradation). When individual drivers of change act in combination, delta building processes such as the distribution of sediment flux, aggradation, and progradation are disrupted by the presence of isolated polder-dykes or cross-dams. This suggests that such interventions, unless undertaken at a very large scale, can lead to unsustainable delta building processes. Our findings can inform management choices in real-world tidally-influenced deltas, while the methodology can provide insights into other dynamic morphological systems."

Eggshell membrane (ESM) was selected and modified to adsorb heavy metals. Adsorption of metal ions on the modified ESM (MESM) might be attributed to electrostatic interaction, ion exchange and coordination effect with chelating ligands containing N and S on the surface of the MESM. The pH of the solution was a key factor affecting the adsorption. The Cu-Ag/MESM composites with uniform Cu-Ag NPs were prepared with MESM as matrices, and with Cu2+ and Ag+ adsorbed as metal sources. The Cu-Ag/MESM showed excellent catalytic performance in the reduction of 4-nitrophenol to 4-aminophenol in the aqueous phase.

The underlying mechanisms postulated for magnetoreception in bees are varied, but most point towards the abdomen as the most likely anatomical region for its location, partly owing to the large accumulation of iron in trophocyte cells that comprise the honeybee fat body. Using a multi-modal imaging and analysis approach, we have investigated iron in the honeybee, with a particular focus on the abdomen and the utility of such techniques as applied to magnetoreception. Abdominal iron is shown to accumulate rapidly, reaching near maximum levels only 5 days after emerging from the comb and is associated with the accumulation of iron within the fat body. While fat body iron could be visualized, no regions of interest, other than perhaps the fat body itself, were identified as potential sites for magnetoreceptive cells. If an iron-based magnetoreceptor exists within the honeybee abdomen the large accumulation of iron in the fat body is likely to impede its discovery.","Ar-Ar dating for hydrothermal quartz from the 2.4 Ga Ongeluk Formation, South Africa: implications for seafloor hydrothermal circulation.",https://www.ncbi.nlm.nih.gov/pubmed/30839744,Royal Society open science,2019 03 08,"Fluid inclusions in hydrothermal quartz in the 2.4 Ga Ongeluk Formation, South Africa, are expected to partially retain a component of the ancient seawater. To constrain the origin of the fluid and the quartz precipitation age, we conducted Ar-Ar dating for the quartz via a stepwise crushing method. The obtained argon isotopes show two or three endmembers with one or two binary mixing lines as the crushing proceeds, suggesting that the isotopic compositions of these endmembers correspond to fluid inclusions of each generation, earlier generated smaller 40Ar- and K-rich inclusions, moderate 40Ar- and 38ArCl (neutron-induced 38Ar from Cl)-rich inclusions and later generated larger atmospheric-rich inclusions. The K-rich inclusions show significantly different 40Ar/38ArCl values compared to the 38ArCl-rich inclusions, indicating that it is difficult to constrain the quartz formation age using only fluid inclusions containing excess 40Ar. The highest obtained 40Ar/36Ar value from the fluid inclusions is consistent with an expected value of the Ongeluk plume source, suggesting that the quartz precipitation was driven by Ongeluk volcanism. Considering the fluid inclusion generations and their compositions, the hydrothermal system was composed of crustal fluid and magmatic fluid without seawater before the beginning of a small amount of seawater input to the hydrothermal system.",The role of geospatial hotspots in the spatial spread of tuberculosis in rural Ethiopia: a mathematical model.,https://www.ncbi.nlm.nih.gov/pubmed/30839742,Royal Society open science,2019 03 08,"Geospatial tuberculosis (TB) hotspots are hubs of TB transmission both within and across community groups. We aimed to quantify the extent to which these hotspots account for the spatial spread of TB in a high-burden setting. We developed spatially coupled models to quantify the spread of TB from geographical hotspots to distant regions in rural Ethiopia. The population was divided into three 'patches' based on their proximity to transmission hotspots, namely hotspots, adjacent regions and remote regions. The models were fitted to 5-year notification data aggregated by the metapopulation structure. Model fitting was achieved with a Metropolis-Hastings algorithm using a Poisson likelihood to compare model-estimated notification rate with observed notification rates. A cross-coupled metapopulation model with assortative mixing by region closely fit to notification data as assessed by the deviance information criterion. We estimated 45 hotspot-to-adjacent regions transmission events and 2 hotspot-to-remote regions transmission events occurred for every 1000 hotspot-to-hotspot transmission events. Although the degree of spatial coupling was weak, the proportion of infections in the adjacent region that resulted from mixing with hotspots was high due to the high prevalence of TB cases in a hotspot region, with approximately 75% of infections attributable to hotspot contact. Our results suggest that the role of hotspots in the geospatial spread of TB in rural Ethiopia is limited, implying that TB transmission is primarily locally driven.",Dual tree complex wavelet transform-based signal denoising method exploiting neighbourhood dependencies and goodness-of-fit test.,https://www.ncbi.nlm.nih.gov/pubmed/30839740,Royal Society open science,2019 03 08,"A novel signal denoising method is proposed whereby goodness-of-fit (GOF) test in combination with a majority classifications-based neighbourhood filtering is employed on complex wavelet coefficients obtained by applying dual tree complex wavelet transform (DT-CWT) on a noisy signal. The DT-CWT has proven to be a better tool for signal denoising as compared to the conventional discrete wavelet transform (DWT) owing to its approximate translation invariance. The proposed framework exploits statistical neighbourhood dependencies by performing the GOF test locally on the DT-CWT coefficients for their preliminary classification/detection as signal or noise. Next, a deterministic neighbourhood filtering approach based on majority noise classifications is employed to detect false classification of signal coefficients as noise (via the GOF test) which are subsequently restored. The proposed method shows competitive performance against the state of the art in signal denoising.",Preparation and characterization of molecularly imprinted solid-phase extraction column coupled with high-performance liquid chromatography for selective determination of melamine.,https://www.ncbi.nlm.nih.gov/pubmed/30839739,Royal Society open science,2019 03 08,"We synthesized a selective molecularly imprinted solid-phase extraction (MIP-SPE) column and established an extraction and enrichment method using this MIP-SPE column. By coupling with HPLC, we developed a new method to detect trace amounts of melamine in eggs. The MIP-SPE column was synthesized by in situ thermal-initiated polymerization using melamine as the template, methacrylic acid as the functional monomer, ethylene glycol dimethacrylate as the cross-linker and azodiisobutyronitrile as the initiator. HPLC was used to evaluate the identification and enrichment capability of the MIP-SPE column and for the measurement of melamine in the sample. The melamine concentration exhibited an excellent linear relationship in the range of 0.1-25.0 µg ml-1 (r = 0.9983). The identification capability of the MIP-SPE column was apparently superior to that of the non-imprinted polymer solid-phase extraction column; an average enrichment factor of 46.8-fold (RSD = 3.5%) was obtained for 0.4 µg ml-1 melamine by the MIP-SPE column. When the MIP-SPE HPLC method was applied to the detection of melamine in eggs, an average recovery rate of 93.5-102.0% (RSD = 3.6-4.9%) and a limit of detection of 0.05 µg kg-1 were obtained.

Optimization of the reaction conditions towards double carbonylation (PCO = 30 bar, T = 80°C, iodoindole/diamine ratio = 1 : 1.5, toluene as solvent) allowed the target cyclic products, which are formed in situ via intramolecular cyclization of the ketocarboxamide intermediates, to be obtained through a nucleophilic addition/elimination reaction with the pendant terminal amine groups. The structure of the diamine nucleophile was revealed to affect the reaction's selectivity, with the best yields for the cyclic products being obtained in the presence of (1S,2S)-(+)-cyclohexane-1,2-diamine (a) as the nucleophile, using either 5- or 7-iodoindole as the substrate. The reaction's selectivity was rationalized based on electronic structure calculations, which explain the effect of the diamine structure on the predominant formation of the cyclic products."

It is argued that the production of an equal number of male and female offspring by individual parents should be favoured by selection, if all costs and benefits are equal. Theoretically, an even sex ratio should yield the highest probability for a fetus to be adjacent to a fetus of the opposite sex in utero. This may cause developmental costs or benefits that have been overlooked. We examined the physiological and developmental parameters associated with in utero sex ratios in the nutria (Myocastor coypus), an invasive wildlife species with a strong reproductive output. Using hair testing, we found that litters with even sex ratios had the highest average cortisol levels. Fetuses neighbouring the opposite sex exhibited longer trunks than those neighbouring the same sex, which might imply better lung development. Our results are the first, to our knowledge, to link intra-utero sex ratios and fetal cortisol and suggest that fetal cortisol might be a mechanism by which even sex ratios are maintained via developmental advantages.",Structural and wetting properties of nature's finest silks (order Embioptera).,https://www.ncbi.nlm.nih.gov/pubmed/30839723,Royal Society open science,2019 03 08,"Insects from the order Embioptera (webspinners) spin silk fibres which are less than 200 nm in diameter.

Our studies cover five of the 10 named taxonomic families and represent about one third of the known taxonomic family-level diversity in the order Embioptera. Naturally spun silk varied in diameter from 43.6 ± 1.7 nm for D. vandykei to 122.4 ± 3.2 nm for An. urichi. Mean fibre diameter did not correlate with adult female body length. Fibre diameter is more similar in closely related species than in more distantly related species. Field observations indicated that silk appears shiny and smooth when exposed to rainwater. We therefore measured contact angles to learn more about interactions between silk and water. Higher contact angles were measured for silks with wider fibre diameter and higher quantity of hydrophobic amino acids. High static contact angles (ranging up to 122° ± 3° for An. urichi) indicated that silken sheets spun by four arboreal, webspinner species were hydrophobic. A second contact angle measurement made on a previously wetted patch of silk resulted in a lower contact angle (average difference was greater than 27°) for all four species. Our studies suggest that silk fibres which had been previously exposed to water exhibited irreversible changes in hydrophobicity and water adhesion properties. Our results are in alignment with the 'super-pinning' site hypothesis by Yarger and co-workers to describe the hydrophobic, yet water adhesive, properties exhibited by webspinner silk fibres. The physical and chemical insights gained here may inform the synthesis and development of smaller diameter silk fibres with unique water adhesion properties.",Unexpected diversity within the extinct elephant birds (Aves: Aepyornithidae) and a new identity for the world's largest bird.,https://www.ncbi.nlm.nih.gov/pubmed/30839722,Royal Society open science,2019 03 08,"Madagascar's now-extinct radiation of large-bodied ratites, the elephant birds (Aepyornithidae), has been subject to little modern research compared to the island's mammalian megafauna and other Late Quaternary giant birds. The family's convoluted and conflicting taxonomic history has hindered accurate interpretation of morphological diversity and has restricted modern research into their evolutionary history, biogeography and ecology. We present a new quantitative analysis of patterns of morphological diversity of aepyornithid skeletal elements, including material from all major global collections of aepyornithid skeletal remains, and constituting the first taxonomic reassessment of the family for over 50 years. Linear morphometric data collected from appendicular limb elements, and including nearly all type specimens, were examined using multivariate cluster analysis and the Bayesian information criterion, and with estimation of missing data using multiple imputation and expectation maximization algorithms. These analyses recover three distinct skeletal morphotypes within the Aepyornithidae. Two of these morphotypes are associated with the type specimens of the existing genera Mullerornis and Aepyornis, and represent small-bodied and medium-bodied aepyornithids, respectively. Aepyornis contains two distinct morphometric subgroups, which are identified as the largely allopatric species A. hildebrandti and A. maximus. The third morphotype, which has not previously been recognized as a distinct genus, is described as the novel taxon Vorombe titan. Vorombe represents the largest-bodied aepyornithid and is the world's largest bird, with a mean body mass of almost 650 kg. This new taxonomic framework for the Aepyornithidae provides an important new baseline for future studies of avian evolution and the Quaternary ecology of Madagascar.","Does 1,8-diiodooctane affect the aggregation state of PC71BM in solution?",https://www.ncbi.nlm.nih.gov/pubmed/30839721,Royal Society open science,2019 03 08,"1,8-Diiodooctane (DIO) is an additive used in the processing of organic photovoltaics and has previously been reported, on the basis of small-angle X-ray scattering (SAXS) measurements, to deflocculate nano-aggregates of [6,6]-phenyl-C71-butyric acid methyl ester (PC71BM) in chlorobenzene. We have critically re-examined this finding in a series of scattering measurements using both X-rays and neutrons. With SAXS, we find that the form of the background solvent scattering is influenced by the presence of DIO, that there is substantial attenuation of the X-rays by the background solvent and that there appears to be beam-induced aggregation. All three factors call into question the suitability of SAXS for measurements on these samples. By contrast, small-angle neutron scattering (SANS) measurements, performed at concentrations of 15 mg ml-1 up to and including 40 mg ml-1, show no difference in the aggregation state for PC71BM in chlorobenzene with and without 3% DIO; we find PC71BM to be molecularly dissolved in all solvent cases. Insitu film thinning measurements of spin-coated PC71BM solution with the DIO additive dry much slower. Optical imaging shows that the fullerene films possess enhanced molecular mobility in the presence of DIO and it is this which, we conclude, improves the nanomorphology and consequently solar cell performance. We propose that any compatible high boiling solvent would be expected to show the same behaviour.",Anastasis: recovery from the brink of cell death.,https://www.ncbi.nlm.nih.gov/pubmed/30839720,Royal Society open science,2019 03 08,"Anastasis is a natural cell recovery phenomenon that rescues cells from the brink of death. Programmed cell death such as apoptosis has been traditionally assumed to be an intrinsically irreversible cascade that commits cells to a rapid and massive demolition. Interestingly, recent studies have demonstrated recovery of dying cells even at the late stages generally considered immutable. Here, we examine the evidence for anastasis in cultured cells and in animals, review findings illuminating the potential mechanisms of action, discuss the challenges of studying anastasis and explore new strategies to uncover the function and regulation of anastasis, the identification of which has wide-ranging physiological, pathological and therapeutic implications.",Portable bacteria-capturing chip for direct surface-enhanced Raman scattering identification of urinary tract infection pathogens.,https://www.ncbi.nlm.nih.gov/pubmed/30839718,Royal Society open science,2019 03 08,"Acute urinary tract infections (UTIs) are one of the most common nosocomial bacterial infections, which affect almost 50% of the population at least once in their lifetime. UTIs may lead to lethal consequences if they are left undiagnosed and not properly treated. Early, rapid and accurate uropathogens detection methods play a pivotal role in clinical process. In this work, a portable bacteria-grasping surface-enhanced Raman scattering (SERS) chip for identification of three species of uropathogens (Escherichia coli CFT 073, Pseudomonas aeruginosa PAO1 and Proteus mirabilis PRM1) directly from culture matrix was reported. The chip was firstly modified with a positively charged NH3+ group, which enables itself grasp the negatively charged bacterial cells through the electrostatic adsorption principle. After the bacterial cells were captured by the chip, concentrated Ag nanoparticles (NPs) were used to obtain their Raman fingerprint spectra with recognizable characteristic peaks and good reproducibility. With the help of chemometric method such as discriminant analysis (DA), the SERS-based chip allows a rapid, successful identification of three species of UTI bacteria with a minimal bacterial concentration (105 cells ml-1) required for clinical diagnostics. In addition, this chip could spot the bacterial SERS fingerprints information directly from LB culture medium and artificial urine without sample pre-treatment. The portable bacteria-grasping SERS-based chip provides a possibility for fast and easy detection of uropathogens, and viability of future development in healthcare applications.",Removal of Cr6+ ions from water by electrosorption on modified activated carbon fibre felt.,https://www.ncbi.nlm.nih.gov/pubmed/30839717,Royal Society open science,2019 03 08,"Electrosorption is a novel desalination technique that has many advantages in the treatment of sewage. However, commercially available activated carbon electrodes for electrosorption commonly have low microporosity, poor moulding performance, and low adsorption and regeneration efficiency. Here, we evaluated a novel adsorbent material, activated carbon fibre felt (ACFF), for electrosorption of chromium ions (Cr6+) in sewage treatment. The ACFF was modified with 20% nitric acid and its modified structure was characterized. The modified ACFF was used as an adsorbing electrode to investigate its desalination effect by electrosorption. Results showed that compared with those of unmodified ACFF, the modified ACFF had more carbonyl and carboxyl groups and the specific surface area, average pore size and micropore volume of the modified ACFF also improved by 32.2%, 2.5% and 23.1%, respectively. The kinetics of Cr6+ adsorption conformed to the pseudo-second-order kinetic equation, and the adsorption isotherm conformed to the Langmuir model. In addition, the regeneration rate of the modified ACFF electrode was more than 94%. In conclusion, the modified ACFF exhibits excellent electrosorption and regeneration performance for Cr6+ removal from water and thus is of great value for promotion in sewage treatment.",Network resilience of mutualistic ecosystems and environmental changes: an empirical study.,https://www.ncbi.nlm.nih.gov/pubmed/30839716,Royal Society open science,2019 03 08,"It is theorized that a mutualistic ecosystem's resilience against perturbations (e.g. species extinction) is determined by a single macroscopic parameter (network resilience), calculable from the network. Given that such perturbations occur owing to environmental changes (e.g. climate change and human impact), it has been predicted that mutualistic ecosystems that exist despite extensive environmental changes exhibit higher network resilience; however, such a prediction has not been confirmed using real-world data. Thus, in this study, the effects of climate change velocity and human activities on mutualistic network resilience were investigated. A global dataset of plant-animal mutualistic networks was used, and spatial analysis was performed to examine the effects. Moreover, the potential confounding effects of network size, current climate and altitude were statistically controlled. It was demonstrated that mutualistic network resilience was globally influenced by warming velocity and human impact, in addition to current climate. Specifically, pollination network resilience increased in response to human impact, and seed-dispersal network resilience increased with warming velocity. The effect of environmental changes on network resilience for plants was remarkable. The results confirmed the prediction obtained based on the theory and imply that real-world mutualistic networks have a structure that increases ecosystem resilience against environmental changes. These findings will enhance the understanding of ecosystem resilience.",Effect of carboxylic group on the compatibility with retarder and the retarding side effect of the fluid loss control additive used in oil well cement.,https://www.ncbi.nlm.nih.gov/pubmed/30839713,Royal Society open science,2019 03 06,"The retarding side effect and the compatibility with other additives are the main problems that limit the field application of the synthesized fluid loss control additive (FLCA). The effect of the type and content of carboxylic acid groups on the retarding side effect of FLCA and the compatibility between FLCA and the retarder AMPS-IA synthesized using 2-acrylamido-2-methyl propane sulfonic acid (AMPS) and itaconic acid (IA) was studied in this paper. The type and content of carboxylic acid group have a great influence on the fluid loss control ability, the compatibility with retarder and the retarding side effect of FLCA. FLCA containing IA or maleic acid (MA) shows better compatibility with retarder than FLCA containing acrylic acid, but the retarding side effect of FLCA containing MA is weaker than that of FLCA containing IA. Thus, MA is the most suitable monomer for synthesizing FLCA having good compatibility with retarder AMPS-IA.",Risk factors for human cutaneous anthrax outbreaks in the hotspot districts of Northern Tanzania: an unmatched case-control study.,https://www.ncbi.nlm.nih.gov/pubmed/30839712,Royal Society open science,2019 03 08,"Bacillus anthracis is an aerobic, Gram-positive and spore-forming bacterium, which causes anthrax in herbivores.

An unmatched case-control study was conducted to identify the importance of demographic, biological and/or behavioural factors associated with human cutaneous anthrax outbreaks in the hotspot areas of Northern Tanzania. A semi-structured questionnaire was administered to both cases and controls. The age range of participants was 1-80 years with a median age of 32 years. In the younger group (1-20 years), the odds of being infected were 25 times higher in the exposed group compared to the unexposed group (OR= 25, 95% CI = 1.5-410). By contrast, the odds of exposure in the old group (≥20 years) were three times lower in the exposed group compared to the unexposed group (OR = 3.2, 95% CI = 1.28-8.00). Demographic characteristics, sleeping on animal's skins, contacting with infected carcasses through skinning and butchering, and not having formal education were linked to exposure for anthrax infection. Hence, a One Health approach is inevitable for the prevention and control of anthrax outbreaks in the hotspot areas of Northern Tanzania."

A case study was conducted in Keluke Lake, China, to reveal the effects of sedimentary nitrogen on water quality in plateau freshwater lakes. Nitrogen speciation, mineralization potential and release flux were analysed through a sequential extraction method, waterlogged incubation experiment and Fick's first diffusion law, respectively. The content of total nitrogen (TN) was 1295.75-6151.69 mg kg-1, and 94.2% of TN was organic nitrogen (ON).

While much effort has been given to identifying the responsible pathogens, little is known about the factors that influence disease transmission or individual susceptibility. In the Kanyawara community of wild chimpanzees, respiratory illness has been the leading cause of mortality over 31 years, contributing to 27% of deaths. Deaths were common in all age groups except juveniles. Over 22 years of health observations, respiratory signs were rare among infants and most common among older adults of both sexes. Respiratory signs were also common among males during the transition to adulthood (ages 10-20 years), particularly among those of low rank. Respiratory signs peaked conspicuously in March, a pattern that we could not explain after modelling climatic factors, group sizes, diet or exposure to humans. Furthermore, rates of respiratory illness in the chimpanzees did not track seasonal rates of illness in the nearby village. Our data indicate that the epidemiology of chimpanzee respiratory illness warrants more investigation but clearly differs in important ways from humans. Findings on individual susceptibility patterns suggest that respiratory signs are a robust indicator for investigating immunocompetence in wild chimpanzees.",A microfluidic chip-based co-culture of fibroblast-like synoviocytes with osteoblasts and osteoclasts to test bone erosion and drug evaluation.,https://www.ncbi.nlm.nih.gov/pubmed/30839692,Royal Society open science,2019 03 08,"Targeting fibroblast-like synoviocyte (FLS) migration and invasion-mediated bone erosion is a promising clinical strategy for the treatment of rheumatoid arthritis (RA). Drug sensitivity testing is fundamental to this scheme. We designed a microfluidic chip-based, cell co-cultured platform to mimic RA FLS-mediated bone erosion and perform drug-sensitive assay. Human synovium SW982 cells were cultured in the central channel and migrated to flow through matrigel-coated side channels towards cell culture chamber where RANKL-stimulated osteoclastic RAW264.7 and osteogenic medium (OS)-stimulated bone marrow mesenchymal stem cells (BMSC) were cultured in the microfluidic chip device, mimicking FLS migration and invasion-mediated bone erosion in RA. These SW982 cells showed different migration potentials to osteoclasts and BMSC. The migration of SW982 cells with high expression of cadherin-11 was more potent when SW982 cells were connected with the co-culture of RAW264.7 and BMSC. Simultaneously, in the co-cultured chamber, tartrate-resistant acid phosphatase (TRAP) activity of RANKL-stimulated RAW264.7 cells was enhanced, but alkaline phosphatase (ALP) activity was decreased in comparison with mono-cultured chamber. Furthermore, it was confirmed that celastrol, a positive drug for the treatment of RA, inhibited SW982 cell migration as well as TRAP activity in the cell-cultured microfluidic chips. Thus, the migration and invasion to bone-related cells was reconstituted on the microfluidic model. It may provide an effective anti-RA drug screen model for targeting FLS migration-mediated bone erosion.","Spatial scale changes the relationship between beta diversity, species richness and latitude.",https://www.ncbi.nlm.nih.gov/pubmed/30839691,Royal Society open science,2019 03 08,"The relationship between β-diversity and latitude still remains to be a core question in ecology because of the lack of consensus between studies. One hypothesis for the lack of consensus between studies is that spatial scale changes the relationship between latitude and β-diversity. Here, we test this hypothesis using tree data from 15 large-scale forest plots (greater than or equal to 15 ha, diameter at breast height ≥ 1 cm) across a latitudinal gradient (3-30o) in the Asia-Pacific region. We found that the observed β-diversity decreased with increasing latitude when sampling local tree communities at small spatial scale (grain size ≤0.1 ha), but the observed β-diversity did not change with latitude when sampling at large spatial scales (greater than or equal to 0.25 ha). Differences in latitudinal β-diversity gradients across spatial scales were caused by pooled species richness (γ-diversity), which influenced observed β-diversity values at small spatial scales, but not at large spatial scales. Therefore, spatial scale changes the relationship between β-diversity, γ-diversity and latitude, and improving sample representativeness avoids the γ-dependence of β-diversity.",Effect on electrospun fibres by synthesis of high branching polylactic acid.,https://www.ncbi.nlm.nih.gov/pubmed/30839690,Royal Society open science,2019 03 08,"Polylactic electrospun porous fibres have been widely used in tissue engineering scaffolds. However, the application of linear polylactic is limited due to its poor hydrophilicity, which leads to phase separation and has been seldom used in porous fibre preparation. Instead, branching polylactic acts as a new effective method to prepare porous fibres because it can increase polylactic polar property and make it easy to be formulated in the following application. In the current study, we prepared an ultra-high molecular weight of high branching polylactic with glycerol as the initiator by controlling the ring-opening polymerization time, adding amount of catalyst and glycerol. The structure, molecular weight and thermal properties of copolymers were tested subsequently. The result showed that the surface of the high branching polylactic films is smooth, hydrophilic and porous. This branching polylactic formed electrospun porous fibres and possessed a strong adsorption of silver ion.

Prior attempts to resolve long-standing debates on this topic have been hampered by an over-reliance on narrative arguments, small and geographically narrow samples, and by contradictory findings. Here we overcome these methodological limitations by applying multi-model inference tools developed in biogeography to a global dataset (818 societies). Although some have argued that unique conditions and events determine each society's particular subsistence strategy, we find strong support for a general global pattern in which a limited set of environmental, social and historical factors predicts an essential characteristic of all human groups: how we obtain our food.",The catalytic effect of calcium and potassium on CO2 gasification of Shengli lignite: the role of carboxyl.,https://www.ncbi.nlm.nih.gov/pubmed/30839688,Royal Society open science,2019 03 08,"The CO2 gasification of Chinese Shengli lignite (SL) catalysed by K+ and Ca2+ was studied. The results showed that calcium could greatly decrease the gasification reaction temperature of SL, and the gasification reaction rates of acid-treated SL catalysed by calcium were significantly higher than that catalysed by potassium. Kinetic analysis showed that the activation energy of the reaction catalysed by calcium was much lower than that catalysed by potassium, which was the reason for the higher catalytic activity of calcium. Fourier transform infrared characterization showed that, compared with acid-treated SL, the addition of K+/Ca2+ resulted in the significant weakening of C=O bond, and new peaks attributed to carboxylate species appeared. X-ray photoelectron spectroscopy results indicated that the numbers of C=O decreased after the metal ions were added, indicating the formation of metal-carboxylate complexes. Raman characterization showed that the ID1/IG values increased, suggesting more structural defects, which indicated that the reactivity of coal samples had a close relation with amorphous carbon structures. Ca2+ could interact with the carboxyl structure in lignite by both ionic forces and polycarboxylic coordination, while K+ interacted with carboxyl structure mainly via ionic forces.",Tailoring morphology of cobalt-nickel layered double hydroxide via different surfactants for high-performance supercapacitor.,https://www.ncbi.nlm.nih.gov/pubmed/30839687,Royal Society open science,2019 03 08,"Tailoring the morphology of cobalt-nickel layered double hydroxide (LDH) electrode material was successfully achieved via the process of cathodic electrodeposition by adding different surfactants (hexamethylenetetramine, dodecyltrimethylammonium bromide (DTAB) or cetyltrimethylammonium bromide).

In particular, a specific capacitance of 1209.1 F g-1 was found for the cauliflower-like Co0.75Ni0.25(OH)2 electrode material using DTAB as the surfactant at a current density of 1 A g-1, whose structure boosted ion diffusion to present a good rate ability of 64% with a 50-fold increase in current density from 1 A g-1 to 50 A g-1. Accordingly, the asymmetric supercapacitor assembled by current LDH electrode and activated carbon electrode showed an energy density as high as 21.3 Wh kg-1 at a power density of 3625 W kg-1.

We provide a rationale for this, based on a simple proportional growth with birth and death model previously employed to describe the size distribution of firms, cities, webpages, etc. We empirically validate the model and its main predictions, in terms of proportional growth (Gibrat's Law) of the coins and tokens. Estimating the main parameters of the model, the theoretical predictions for the power-law exponents of coin and token distributions are in remarkable agreement with the empirical estimations, given the simplicity of the model. Our results clearly characterize coins as being 'entrenched incumbents' and tokens as an 'explosive immature ecosystem', largely due to massive and exuberant Initial Coin Offering activity in the token space.

In the column leaching experiment, a PVC pipe with an inner diameter of 112 mm and a height of 1500 mm was used. The uranium content was determined by using titanium trioxide that was placed into a 0.1 mg ml-1 standard uranium solution, and a sampling rate of once daily with a 5 ml volume of leaching solution was adopted after 8 h drenching time. The results show that the flow rate of the leaching solution depends on the distribution of the ore's particle size, that is, a larger fractal dimension results in a smaller flow rate. The concentration of the uranium leaching solution reaches a maximum value which subsequently decreases with time on the third day of the experiment, and it seems that the changes in the uranium concentration tend to be stable at around 15 days. Moreover, the concentration seems to increase with the increasing fractal dimension, and the fractal dimension of the ore particle size has a significant impact on the leaching kinetics. When the fractal dimension is between 1.1 and 2.6, the uranium dissolution rate, K, increases with the increasing fractal dimension. The kinetic reaction of the uranium leaching is a liquid-solid one, which is controlled by chemical reactions in the earlier phase. While the middle reaction phase is mainly chemical-diffusion reaction coupling, and the latter part of the reaction is controlled by diffusion. As the fractal dimension increases, the liquid-solid reaction controlled by diffusion appears at earlier phases. When the fractal dimension is greater than 2.0, the time of entering the diffusion control phase only changed little with the increasing of the fractal dimension. At last, a fractal dimension of 2.0 is suggested for the acid leaching of uranium ore crushing."

All-optical sound detectors yield a higher signal-to-noise ratio per unit area than piezoelectric detectors and feature wide detection bandwidths that may be more appropriate for optoacoustic applications, enabling several biomedical or industrial applications. Additionally, optical sensing of sound is less sensitive to electromagnetic noise, making it appropriate for a greater spectrum of environments. In this review, we categorize different methods of optical ultrasound detection and discuss key technology trends geared towards the development of all-optical optoacoustic systems. We also review application areas that are enabled by all-optical sound detectors, including interventional imaging, non-contact measurements, magnetoacoustics, and non-destructive testing.",Tailoring spin mixtures by ion-enhanced Maxwell magnetic coupling in color-tunable organic electroluminescent devices.,https://www.ncbi.nlm.nih.gov/pubmed/30839638,"Light, science & applications",2019 03 08,"In this work, we show that the spin dynamics of excitons can be dramatically altered by Maxwell magnetic field coupling, together with an ion-enhanced, low-internal-splitting-energy organic semiconducting emitter. By employing a unique, alternating current (AC)-driven organic electroluminescent (OEL) device architecture that optimizes this magnetic field coupling, almost complete control over the singlet-to-triplet ratio (from fluorescent to phosphorescent emission in a single device) is realized. We attribute this spin population control to magnetically sensitive polaron-spin pair intersystem crossings (ISCs) that can be directly manipulated through external driving conditions. As an illustration of the utility of this approach to spin-tailoring, we demonstrate a simple hybrid (double-layer) fluorescence-phosphorescence (F-P) device using a polyfluorene-based emitter with a strong external Zeeman effect and ion-induced long carrier diffusion. Remarkable control over de-excitation pathways is achieved by controlling the device-driving frequency, resulting in complete emission blue-red color tunability. Picosecond photoluminescence (PL) spectroscopy directly confirms that this color control derives from the magnetic manipulation of the singlet-to-triplet ratios. These results may pave the way to far more exotic organic devices with magnetic-field-coupled organic systems that are poised to usher in an era of dynamic spintronics at room temperature.",Second harmonic generation hotspot on a centrosymmetric smooth silver surface.,https://www.ncbi.nlm.nih.gov/pubmed/30839636,"Light, science & applications",2019 03 08,"Second harmonic generation (SHG) is forbidden for materials with inversion symmetry, such as bulk metals. Symmetry can be broken by morphological or dielectric discontinuities, yet SHG from a smooth continuous metallic surface is negligible. Using non-linear microscopy, we experimentally demonstrate enhanced SHG within an area of smooth silver film surrounded by nanocavities. Nanocavity-assisted SHG is locally enhanced by more than one order of magnitude compared to a neighboring silver surface area. Linear optical measurements and cathodoluminescence (CL) imaging substantiate these observations. We suggest that plasmonic modes launched from the edges of the nanocavities propagate onto the smooth silver film and annihilate, locally generating SHG. In addition, we show that these hotspots can be dynamically controlled in intensity and location by altering the polarization of the incoming field. Our results show that switchable nonlinear hotspots can be generated on smooth metallic films, with important applications in photocatalysis, single-molecule spectroscopy and non-linear surface imaging.",Wavelength stability in a hybrid photonic crystal laser through controlled nonlinear absorptive heating in the reflector.,https://www.ncbi.nlm.nih.gov/pubmed/30839633,"Light, science & applications",2019 03 08,"The need for miniaturized, fully integrated semiconductor lasers has stimulated significant research efforts into realizing unconventional configurations that can meet the performance requirements of a large spectrum of applications, ranging from communication systems to sensing. We demonstrate a hybrid, silicon  photonics-compatible photonic crystal (PhC) laser architecture that can be used to implement cost-effective, high-capacity light sources, with high side-mode suppression ratio and milliwatt output output powers. The emitted wavelength is set and controlled by a silicon PhC cavity-based reflective filter with the gain provided by a III-V-based reflective semiconductor optical amplifier (RSOA). The high power density in the laser cavity results in a significant enhancement of the nonlinear absorption in silicon in the high Q-factor PhC resonator. The heat generated in this manner creates a tuning effect in the wavelength-selective element, which can be used to offset external temperature fluctuations without the use of active cooling. Our approach is fully compatible with existing fabrication and integration technologies, providing a practical route to integrated lasing in wavelength-sensitive schemes.",Experimental demonstration of tunable refractometer based on orbital angular momentum of longitudinally structured light.,https://www.ncbi.nlm.nih.gov/pubmed/30839632,"Light, science & applications",2019 03 08,"The index of refraction plays a decisive role in the design and classification of optical materials and devices; therefore, its proper and accurate determination is essential. In most refractive index (RI) sensing schemes, however, there is a trade-off between providing high-resolution measurements and covering a wide range of RIs. We propose and experimentally demonstrate a novel mechanism for sensing the index of refraction of a medium by utilizing the orbital angular momentum (OAM) of structured light. Using a superposition of co-propagating monochromatic higher-order Bessel beams with equally spaced longitudinal wavenumbers, in a comb-like setting, we generate non-diffracting rotating light structures in which the orientation of the beam's intensity profile is sensitive to the RI of the medium (here, a fluid). In principle, the sensitivity of this scheme can exceed ~2700°/RI unit (RIU) with a resolution of ~

  RIU. Furthermore, we show how the unbounded degrees of freedom associated with OAM can be deployed to offer a wide dynamic range by generating structured light that evolves into different patterns based on the change in RI. The rotating light structures are generated by a programmable spatial light modulator. This provides dynamic control over the sensitivity, which can be tuned to perform coarse or fine measurements of the RI in real time. This, in turn, allows high sensitivity and resolution to be achieved simultaneously over a very wide dynamic range, which is a typical trade-off in all RI sensing schemes. We thus envision that this method will open new directions in refractometry and remote sensing.",Single-shot BOTDA based on an optical chirp chain probe wave for distributed ultrafast measurement.,https://www.ncbi.nlm.nih.gov/pubmed/30839630,"Light, science & applications",2019 03 08,"Brillouin optical time-domain analysis (BOTDA) requires frequency mapping of the Brillouin spectrum to obtain environmental information (e.g., temperature or strain) over the length of the sensing fiber, with the finite frequency-sweeping time-limiting applications to only static or slowly varying strain or temperature environments. To solve this problem, we propose the use of an optical chirp chain probe wave to remove the requirement of frequency sweeping for the Brillouin spectrum, which enables distributed ultrafast strain measurement with a single pump pulse. The optical chirp chain is generated using a frequency-agile technique via a fast-frequency-changing microwave, which covers a larger frequency range around the Stokes frequency relative to the pump wave, so that a distributed Brillouin gain spectrum along the fiber is realized. Dynamic strain measurements for periodic mechanical vibration, mechanical shock, and a switch event are demonstrated at sampling rates of 25 kHz, 2.5 MHz and 6.25 MHz, respectively. To the best of our knowledge, this is the first demonstration of distributed Brillouin strain sensing with a wide-dynamic range at a sampling rate of up to the MHz level.",Selective excitation and imaging of ultraslow phonon polaritons in thin hexagonal boron nitride crystals.,https://www.ncbi.nlm.nih.gov/pubmed/30839629,"Light, science & applications",2019 03 08,"We selectively excite and study two new types of phonon-polariton guided modes that are found in hexagonal boron nitride thin flakes on a gold substrate. Such modes show substantially improved confinement and a group velocity that is hundreds of times slower than the speed of light, thereby providing a new way to create slow light in the mid-infrared range with a simple structure that does not require nano-patterning. One mode is the fundamental mode in the first Restrahlen band of hexagonal boron nitride thin crystals on a gold substrate; the other mode is equivalent to the second mode of the second Restrahlen band of hexagonal boron nitride flakes that are suspended in vacuum. The new modes also couple efficiently with incident light at the hexagonal boron nitride edges, as we demonstrate experimentally using photo-induced force microscopy and scanning near-field optical microscopy. The high confinement of these modes allows for Purcell factors that are on the order of tens of thousands directly above boron nitride and a wide band, with new perspectives for enhanced light-matter interaction. Our findings demonstrate a new approach to engineering the dispersion of polaritons in 2D materials to improve confinement and light-matter interaction, thereby paving the way for new applications in mid-infrared nano-optics.",Phase-matching-free parametric oscillators based on two-dimensional semiconductors.,https://www.ncbi.nlm.nih.gov/pubmed/30839628,"Light, science & applications",2019 03 08,"Optical parametric oscillators are widely used as pulsed and continuous-wave tunable sources for innumerable applications, such as quantum technologies, imaging, and biophysics. A key drawback is material dispersion, which imposes a phase-matching condition that generally entails a complex design and setup, thus hindering tunability and miniaturization. Here we show that the burden of phase-matching is surprisingly absent in parametric micro-resonators utilizing mono-layer transition-metal dichalcogenides as quadratic nonlinear materials. By the exact solution of nonlinear Maxwell equations and first-principle calculations of the semiconductor nonlinear response, we devise a novel kind of phase-matching-free miniaturized parametric oscillator operating at conventional pump intensities. We find that different two-dimensional semiconductors yield degenerate and non-degenerate emission at various spectral regions due to doubly resonant mode excitation, which can be tuned by varying the incidence angle of the external pump laser. In addition, we show that high-frequency electrical modulation can be achieved by doping via electrical gating, which can be used to efficiently shift the threshold for parametric oscillation. Our results pave the way for the realization of novel ultra-fast tunable micron-sized sources of entangled photons-a key device underpinning any quantum protocol. Highly miniaturized optical parametric oscillators may also be employed in lab-on-chip technologies for biophysics, detection of environmental pollution and security."

By employing a gold mirror under a silicon nanodisk, we introduce a novel characteristic of the anapole mode through the spatial overlap of resonantly excited Cartesian electric and toroidal dipole modes. This is a remarkable improvement on the early demonstrations of the anapole mode in which the electric and toroidal modes interfere off-resonantly. Therefore, our system produces a significant near-field enhancement, facilitating the nonlinear process. Moreover, the mirror surface boosts the nonlinear emission via the free-charge oscillations within the interface, equivalent to producing a mirror image of the nonlinear source and the pump beneath the interface. We found that these improvements result in an extremely high experimentally obtained efficiency of 0.01%.","Gain in polycrystalline Nd-doped alumina: leveraging length scales to create a new class of high-energy, short pulse, tunable laser materials.",https://www.ncbi.nlm.nih.gov/pubmed/30839607,"Light, science & applications",2019 03 08,"Traditionally accepted design paradigms dictate that only optically isotropic (cubic) crystal structures with high equilibrium solubilities of optically active ions are suitable for polycrystalline laser gain media. The restriction of symmetry is due to light scattering caused by randomly oriented anisotropic crystals, whereas the solubility problem arises from the need for sufficient active dopants in the media. These criteria limit material choices and exclude materials that have superior thermo-mechanical properties than state-of-the-art laser materials. Alumina (Al2O3) is an ideal example; it has a higher fracture strength and thermal conductivity than today's gain materials, which could lead to revolutionary laser performance. However, alumina has uniaxial optical proprieties, and the solubility of rare earths (REs) is two-to-three orders of magnitude lower than the dopant concentrations in typical RE-based gain media. We present new strategies to overcome these obstacles and demonstrate gain in a RE-doped alumina (Nd:Al2O3) for the first time. The key insight relies on tailoring the crystallite size to other important length scales-the wavelength of light and interatomic dopant distances, which minimize optical losses and allow successful Nd doping. The result is a laser gain medium with a thermo-mechanical figure of merit of Rs~19,500 Wm-1 a 24-fold and 19,500-fold improvements over the high-energy-laser leaders Nd:YAG (Rs~800 Wm-1) and Nd:Glass (Rs~1 Wm-1), respectively. Moreover, the emission bandwidth of Nd:Al2O3 is broad: ~13 THz. The successful demonstration of gain and high bandwidth in a medium with superior Rs can lead to the development of lasers with previously unobtainable high-peak powers, short pulses, tunability, and high-duty cycles.",Quenching of the red Mn4+ luminescence in Mn4+-doped fluoride LED phosphors.,https://www.ncbi.nlm.nih.gov/pubmed/30839606,"Light, science & applications",2019 03 08,"Red-emitting Mn4+-doped fluorides are a promising class of materials to improve the color rendering and luminous efficacy of white light-emitting diodes (w-LEDs). For w-LEDs, the luminescence quenching temperature is very important, but surprisingly no systematic research has been conducted to understand the mechanism for thermal quenching in Mn4+-doped fluorides. Furthermore, concentration quenching of the Mn4+ luminescence can be an issue but detailed investigations are lacking. In this work, we study thermal quenching and concentration quenching in Mn4+-doped fluorides by measuring luminescence spectra and decay curves of K2TiF6:Mn4+ between 4 and 600 K and for Mn4+ concentrations from 0.01% to 15.7%. Temperature-dependent measurements on K2TiF6:Mn4+ and other Mn4+-doped phosphors show that quenching occurs through thermally activated crossover between the 4T2 excited state and 4A2 ground state. The quenching temperature can be optimized by designing host lattices in which Mn4+ has a high 4T2 state energy. Concentration-dependent studies reveal that concentration quenching effects are limited in K2TiF6:Mn4+ up to 5% Mn4+. This is important, as high Mn4+ concentrations are required for sufficient absorption of blue LED light in the parity-forbidden Mn4+d-d transitions. At even higher Mn4+ concentrations (>10%), the quantum efficiency decreases, mostly due to direct energy transfer to quenching sites (defects and impurity ions). Optimization of the synthesis to reduce quenchers is crucial for developing more efficient highly absorbing Mn4+ phosphors. The present systematic study provides detailed insights into temperature and concentration quenching of Mn4+ emission and can be used to realize superior narrow-band red Mn4+ phosphors for w-LEDs.",Observing charge separation in nanoantennas via ultrafast point-projection electron microscopy.,https://www.ncbi.nlm.nih.gov/pubmed/30839605,"Light, science & applications",2019 03 08,"Observing the motion of electrons on their natural nanometer length and femtosecond time scales is a fundamental goal of and an open challenge for contemporary ultrafast science1-5.

In this study, we create an ultrafast electron source via plasmon nanofocusing on a sharp gold taper and implement this source in an ultrafast point-projection electron microscope. This source is used in an optical pump-electron probe experiment to study ultrafast photoemissions from a nanometer-sized plasmonic antenna12-15.

This study explores unique optical properties associated with one-dimensional nanostructures discovered in silk cocoon fibers of the comet moth, Argema mittrei. The fibers are populated with a high density of air voids randomly distributed across the fiber cross-section but are invariant along the fiber. These filamentary air voids strongly scatter light in the solar spectrum. A single silk fiber measuring ~50 μm thick can reflect 66% of incoming solar radiation, and this, together with the fibers' high emissivity of 0.88 in the mid-infrared range, allows the cocoon to act as an efficient radiative-cooling device. Drawing inspiration from these natural radiative-cooling fibers, biomimetic nanostructured fibers based on both regenerated silk fibroin and polyvinylidene difluoride are fabricated through wet spinning. Optical characterization shows that these fibers exhibit exceptional optical properties for radiative-cooling applications: nanostructured regenerated silk fibers provide a solar reflectivity of 0.73 and a thermal emissivity of 0.90, and nanostructured polyvinylidene difluoride fibers provide a solar reflectivity of 0.93 and a thermal emissivity of 0.91. The filamentary air voids lead to highly directional scattering, giving the fibers a highly reflective sheen, but more interestingly, they enable guided optical modes to propagate along the fibers through transverse Anderson localization. This discovery opens up the possibility of using wild silkmoth fibers as a biocompatible and bioresorbable material for optical signal and image transport.",Generalization of the optical theorem: experimental proof for radially polarized beams.,https://www.ncbi.nlm.nih.gov/pubmed/30839603,"Light, science & applications",2019 03 08,"The optical theorem, which is a consequence of the energy conservation in scattering processes, directly relates the forward scattering amplitude to the extinction cross-section of the object.

On the other hand, radially or azimuthally polarized fields and various vortex beams, essential in modern photonic technologies, possess a prominent vectorial field structure. Here, we experimentally demonstrate a complete violation of the commonly used form of the optical theorem for radially polarized beams at both visible and microwave frequencies. We show that a plasmonic particle illuminated by such a beam exhibits strong extinction, while the scattering in the forward direction is zero. The generalized formulation of the optical theorem provides agreement with the observed results.

However, accurately locating the tumor during a lumpectomy, especially when the lesion is small and nonpalpable, is a challenge. Such difficulty can lead to either incomplete tumor removal or prolonged surgical time, which result in high re-operation rates (~25%) and increased surgical costs. Here, we report a fiber optoacoustic guide (FOG) with augmented reality (AR) for sub-millimeter tumor localization and intuitive surgical guidance with minimal interference. The FOG is preoperatively implanted in the tumor. Under external pulsed light excitation, the FOG omnidirectionally broadcasts acoustic waves through the optoacoustic effect by a specially designed nano-composite layer at its tip. By capturing the acoustic wave, three ultrasound sensors on the breast skin triangulate the FOG tip's position with 0.25-mm accuracy. An AR system with a tablet measures the coordinates of the ultrasound sensors and transforms the FOG tip's position into visual feedback with <1-mm accuracy, thus aiding surgeons in directly visualizing the tumor location and performing fast and accurate tumor removal. We further show the use of a head-mounted display to visualize the same information in the surgeons' first-person view and achieve hands-free guidance. Towards clinical application, a surgeon successfully deployed the FOG to excise a ""pseudo tumor"" in a female human cadaver. With the high-accuracy tumor localization by FOG and the intuitive surgical guidance by AR, the surgeon performed accurate and fast tumor removal, which will significantly reduce re-operation rates and shorten the surgery time.",Strategies for reducing speckle noise in digital holography.,https://www.ncbi.nlm.nih.gov/pubmed/30839600,"Light, science & applications",2019 03 08,"Digital holography (DH) has emerged as one of the most effective coherent imaging technologies. The technological developments of digital sensors and optical elements have made DH the primary approach in several research fields, from quantitative phase imaging to optical metrology and 3D display technologies, to name a few. Like many other digital imaging techniques, DH must cope with the issue of speckle artifacts, due to the coherent nature of the required light sources. Despite the complexity of the recently proposed de-speckling methods, many have not yet attained the required level of effectiveness. That is, a universal denoising strategy for completely suppressing holographic noise has not yet been established. Thus the removal of speckle noise from holographic images represents a bottleneck for the entire optics and photonics scientific community. This review article provides a broad discussion about the noise issue in DH, with the aim of covering the best-performing noise reduction approaches that have been proposed so far. Quantitative comparisons among these approaches will be presented.",A hybrid invisibility cloak based on integration of transparent metasurfaces and zero-index materials.,https://www.ncbi.nlm.nih.gov/pubmed/30839599,"Light, science & applications",2019 03 08,"The invisibility cloak, a long-standing fantastic dream for humans, has become more tangible with the development of metamaterials. Recently, metasurface-based invisibility cloaks have been proposed and realized with significantly reduced thickness and complexity of the cloaking shell. However, the previous scheme is based on reflection-type metasurfaces and is thus limited to reflection geometry. In this work, by integrating the wavefront tailoring functionality of transparent metasurfaces and the wave tunneling functionality of zero-index materials, we have realized a unique type of hybrid invisibility cloak that functions in transmission geometry. The principle is general and applicable to arbitrary shapes. For experimental demonstration, we constructed a rhombic double-layer cloaking shell composed of a highly transparent metasurface and a double-zero medium consisting of dielectric photonic crystals with Dirac cone dispersions. The cloaking effect is verified by both full-wave simulations and microwave experimental results. The principle also reveals exciting possibilities for realizing skin-thick ultrathin cloaking shells in transmission geometry, which can eliminate the need for spatially varying extreme parameters.

The current study presents a compound structure composed of multilayer grating stripes and multilayer shallow trenches. A small depth was adopted for the trench configuration to exclude the extra bend loss. These two sections supported Fabry-Perot resonance and cavity modes, respectively, with hybrid modes formed through intercoupling. In addition, the total loss for the entire framework was clearly reduced due to the introduction of the trench geometry, indicating that both absorption and radiation losses were successfully taken into consideration in the compound structure. Significantly, such a low loss realized by the hybridization of surface plasmon polariton modes has rarely been seen before. Moreover, the debatable relationship between the total and partial quality factors was described for the first time based on a hybrid mode analysis to establish a new approach to investigate the different resonance modes. In the detailed calculation process, the relative electric field intensity was first adopted to stipulate the effective areas for the various modes, which is more reasonable than using the common definition that is based on a unit structure. The multilayer trench grating exhibited a relatively low loss without weakening energy localization, which is significant in the design of plasmonic devices."

A potential new field of application is microwave photonics, an interdisciplinary field in which the interaction between microwaves and optical signals is exploited. In this article, we report the experimental use of PT symmetry in an optoelectronic oscillator (OEO), a key microwave photonics system that can generate single-frequency sinusoidal signals with high spectral purity. PT symmetry is theoretically analyzed and experimentally observed in an OEO with two mutually coupled active oscillation cavities via a precise manipulation of the interplay between gain and loss in the two oscillation cavities. Stable single-frequency microwave oscillation is achieved without using any optical/electrical filters for oscillation mode selection, which is an indispensable requirement in traditional OEOs.

We replace the traditionally used gold nanoparticles with graphene nanoparticles as photothermal sensitizers to permeabilize the cell membrane upon laser irradiation. We demonstrate that the enhanced thermal stability of graphene quantum dots allows the formation of multiple vapor nanobubbles upon irradiation with short laser pulses, allowing the delivery of a variety of extrinsic cell labels efficiently and homogeneously into live cells. We demonstrate high-quality time-lapse imaging with confocal, total internal reflection fluorescence (TIRF), and Airyscan super-resolution microscopy.

A parallel image readout and processing structure is introduced to achieve an ultra-low latency time on the order of nanoseconds, and a hyper-frame resolution in the time domain can be achieved by combining the row-by-row structure and the electrical rolling shutter technique. Experimental results suggest that the expected target can be successfully detected under various interferences with an accuracy of 0.1 pixels (1σ) under the worst sky night test condition and that a centroiding precision of better than 0.03 pixels (1σ) can be reached for static tests.

Much research has been carried out to increase the luminous efficiency, lifetime and colour stability of such devices. However, the emission characteristics of a given light source do not necessarily comply with today's often sophisticated applications. Here, beam shaping addresses the transformation of a given light distribution into a customized form. This is typically achieved by secondary optical elements often sporting elaborate designs, where the actual light source takes up only a small fraction of the system's volume. Such designs limit the final light source to a single permanent operation mode, which can only be overcome by employing mechanically adjustable optical elements. Here we show that organic light-emitting diodes (OLEDs) can enable real-time regulation of a beam shape without relying on secondary optical elements and without using any mechanical adjustment. For a red light-emitting two-unit OLED architecture, we demonstrate the ability to continuously tune between strongly forward and strongly sideward emission, where the device efficiency is maintained at an application-relevant level ranging between 6 and 8% of external quantum efficiency for any chosen setting.

With far-field diffractive optics, this decoding scheme provides a full recording, i.e., a hologram, of the amplitude and phase of the object wave, giving three-dimensional information from a two-dimensional recording. For plasmonics, only a one-dimensional recording is needed, and both the phase and amplitude of the propagating plasmons can be extracted for high-resolution in-plane imaging. Here, we demonstrate lens-less, point-source digital plasmonic holography using two methods to record the plasmonic holograms: a dual-probe near-field scanning optical microscope and lithographically defined circular fluorescent screens. The point-source geometry gives in-plane magnification, allowing for high-resolution imaging with relatively lower-resolution microscope objectives. These results pave the way for a new form of in-plane plasmonic imaging, gathering the full complex wave, without the need for plasmonic mirrors or lenses.",Entanglement beating in free space through spin-orbit coupling.,https://www.ncbi.nlm.nih.gov/pubmed/30839563,"Light, science & applications",2019 03 08,"It is well known that the entanglement of a quantum state is invariant under local unitary transformations. This rule dictates, for example, that the entanglement of internal degrees of freedom of a photon remains invariant during free-space propagation. Here, we outline a scenario in which this paradigm does not hold. Using local Bell states engineered from classical vector vortex beams with non-separable degrees of freedom, the so-called classically entangled states, we demonstrate that the entanglement evolves during propagation, oscillating between maximally entangled (purely vector) and product states (purely scalar). We outline the spin-orbit interaction behind these novel propagation dynamics and confirm the results experimentally, demonstrating spin-orbit coupling in paraxial beams. This demonstration highlights a hitherto unnoticed property of classical entanglement and simultaneously offers a device for the on-demand delivery of vector states to targets, for example, for dynamic laser materials processing, switchable resolution within stimulated emission depletion (STED) systems, and a tractor beam for entanglement.",Thermal camouflage based on the phase-changing material GST.,https://www.ncbi.nlm.nih.gov/pubmed/30839556,"Light, science & applications",2019 03 08,"Camouflage technology has attracted growing interest for many thermal applications. Previous experimental demonstrations of thermal camouflage technology have not adequately explored the ability to continuously camouflage objects either at varying background temperatures or for wide observation angles. In this study, a thermal camouflage device incorporating the phase-changing material Ge2Sb2Te5 (GST) is experimentally demonstrated. It has been shown that near-perfect thermal camouflage can be continuously achieved for background temperatures ranging from 30 °C to 50 °C by tuning the emissivity of the device, which is attained by controlling the GST phase change. The thermal camouflage is robust when the observation angle is changed from 0° to 60°.

Metasurfaces have emerged as fascinating subwavelength flat optical components and devices for light focusing and holography applications. However, these devices exhibit a severe limitation due to their natural passive response. Here we introduce an active hybrid metasurface integrated with patterned semiconductor inclusions for all-optical active control of terahertz waves. Ultrafast modulation of polarization states and the beam splitting ratio are experimentally demonstrated on a time scale of 667 ps. This scheme of hybrid metasurfaces could also be extended to the design of various free-space all-optical active devices, such as varifocal planar lenses, switchable vector beam generators, and components for holography in ultrafast imaging, display, and high-fidelity terahertz wireless communication systems.",Ultra-fast polymer optical fibre Bragg grating inscription for medical devices.,https://www.ncbi.nlm.nih.gov/pubmed/30839549,"Light, science & applications",2019 03 08,"We report the extraordinary result of rapid fibre Bragg grating inscription in doped polymer optical fibres based on polymethyl methacrylate in only 7 ms, which is two orders of magnitude faster than the inscription times previously reported. This was achieved using a new dopant material, diphenyl disulphide, which was found to enable a fast, positive refractive index change using a low ultraviolet dose. These changes were investigated and found to arise from photodissociation of the diphenyl disulphide molecule and subsequent molecular reorganization. We demonstrate that gratings inscribed in these fibres can exhibit at least a 15 times higher sensitivity than silica glass fibre, despite their quick inscription times. As a demonstration of the sensitivity, we selected a highly stringent situation, namely, the monitoring of a human heartbeat and respiratory functions. These findings could permit the inscription of fibre Bragg gratings during the fibre drawing process for mass production, allowing cost-effective, single-use, in vivo sensors among other potential uses."

So far, biosensing associated with high-quality factor plasmonic resonances has almost exclusively relied on detection of spectral shifts and their associated intensity changes. However, the phase response of the plasmonic resonances have rarely been exploited, mainly because this requires a more sophisticated optical arrangement. Here we present a new phase-sensitive platform for high-throughput and label-free biosensing enhanced by plasmonics. It employs specifically designed Au nanohole arrays and a large field-of-view interferometric lens-free imaging reader operating in a collinear optical path configuration. This unique combination allows the detection of atomically thin (angstrom-level) topographical features over large areas, enabling simultaneous reading of thousands of microarray elements. As the plasmonic chips are fabricated using scalable techniques and the imaging reader is built with low-cost off-the-shelf consumer electronic and optical components, the proposed platform is ideal for point-of-care ultrasensitive biomarker detection from small sample volumes.

In this review, we perform a systematic and comparative study of these two flat panel display technologies. First, we review recent advances in LCDs and OLEDs, including material development, device configuration and system integration. Next we analyze and compare their performances by six key display metrics: response time, contrast ratio, color gamut, lifetime, power efficiency, and panel flexibility. In this section, we focus on two key parameters: motion picture response time (MPRT) and ambient contrast ratio (ACR), which dramatically affect image quality in practical application scenarios. MPRT determines the image blur of a moving picture, and ACR governs the perceived image contrast under ambient lighting conditions. It is intriguing that LCD can achieve comparable or even slightly better MPRT and ACR than OLED, although its response time and contrast ratio are generally perceived to be much inferior to those of OLED. Finally, three future trends are highlighted, including high dynamic range, virtual reality/augmented reality and smart displays with versatile functions.",Giant intrinsic chiro-optical activity in planar dielectric nanostructures.,https://www.ncbi.nlm.nih.gov/pubmed/30839535,"Light, science & applications",2019 03 08,"The strong optical chirality arising from certain synthetic metamaterials has important and widespread applications in polarization optics, stereochemistry and spintronics. However, these intrinsically chiral metamaterials are restricted to a complicated three-dimensional (3D) geometry, which leads to significant fabrication challenges, particularly at visible wavelengths. Their planar two-dimensional (2D) counterparts are limited by symmetry considerations to operation at oblique angles (extrinsic chirality) and possess significantly weaker chiro-optical responses close to normal incidence. Here, we address the challenge of realizing strong intrinsic chirality from thin, planar dielectric nanostructures. Most notably, we experimentally achieve near-unity circular dichroism with ~90% of the light with the chosen helicity being transmitted at a wavelength of 540 nm. This is the highest value demonstrated to date for any geometry in the visible spectrum. We interpret this result within the charge-current multipole expansion framework and show that the excitation of higher-order multipoles is responsible for the giant circular dichroism. These experimental results enable the realization of high-performance miniaturized chiro-optical components in a scalable manner at optical frequencies.",Multispectral light scattering endoscopic imaging of esophageal precancer.,https://www.ncbi.nlm.nih.gov/pubmed/30839534,"Light, science & applications",2019 03 09,"Esophageal adenocarcinoma is the most rapidly growing cancer in America. Although the prognosis after diagnosis is unfavorable, the chance of a successful outcome increases tremendously if detected early while the lesion is still dysplastic. Unfortunately, the present standard-of-care, endoscopic surveillance, has major limitations, since dysplasia is invisible, often focal, and systematic biopsies typically sample less than one percent of the esophageal lining and therefore easily miss malignancies. To solve this problem we developed a multispectral light scattering endoscopic imaging system. It surveys the entire esophageal lining and accurately detects subcellular dysplastic changes. The system combines light scattering spectroscopy, which detects and identifies invisible dysplastic sites by analyzing light scattered from epithelial cells, with rapid scanning of the entire esophageal lining using a collimated broadband light beam delivered by an endoscopically compatible fiber optic probe. Here we report the results of the first comprehensive multispectral imaging study, conducted as part of routine endoscopic procedures performed on patients with suspected dysplasia. In a double-blind study that characterized the system's ability to serve as a screening tool, 55 out of 57 patients were diagnosed correctly. In addition, a smaller double-blind comparison of the multispectral data in 24 patients with subsequent pathology at locations where 411 biopsies were collected yielded an accuracy of 90% in detecting individual locations of dysplasia, demonstrating the capability of this method to serve as a guide for biopsy.",Localization optoacoustic tomography.,https://www.ncbi.nlm.nih.gov/pubmed/30839533,"Light, science & applications",2019 03 29,"Localization-based imaging has revolutionized fluorescence optical microscopy and has also enabled unprecedented ultrasound images of microvascular structures in deep tissues.

Dynamic focusing is conventionally achieved with mechanically reconfigurable lenses, spatial light modulators or microfluidics. Here we demonstrate that dynamic control of focusing can be achieved through coherent interaction of optical waves on a thin beam splitter. We use a nanostructured plasmonic metasurface of subwavelength thickness as the beam splitter, allowing operation in the regimes of coherent absorption and coherent transparency. Focusing of light resulting from illumination of the plasmonic metasurface with a Fresnel zone pattern is controlled by another patterned beam projected on the same metasurface. By altering the control pattern, its phase, or its intensity, we switch the lens function on and off, and alter the focal spot's depth, diameter and intensity. Switching occurs as fast as the control beam is modulated and therefore tens of gigahertz modulation bandwidth is possible with electro-optical modulators, which is orders of magnitude faster than conventional dynamic focusing technologies.","Multi-mW, few-cycle mid-infrared continuum spanning from 500 to 2250 cm-1.",https://www.ncbi.nlm.nih.gov/pubmed/30839530,"Light, science & applications",2019 03 08,"The demand for and usage of broadband coherent mid-infrared sources, such as those provided by synchrotron facilities, are growing.

Here we demonstrate a broadband, coherent and intrinsically carrier-envelope-phase-stable source with a spectrum spanning from 500 to 2250 cm-1 (-30 dB) at an average power of 24 mW and a repetition rate of 77 MHz. This performance is enabled by the first mode-locked thin-disk oscillator operating at 2 μm wavelength, providing a tenfold increase in average power over femtosecond oscillators previously demonstrated in this wavelength range4.

Although near-infrared broadband light emitters have found increasingly wide utilization in these imaging applications, the requirement to simultaneously achieve both a high spectral bandwidth and output power is still challenging for such devices. Owing to the relatively weak amplified spontaneous emission, as a consequence of the very short non-radiative carrier lifetime of the inter-subband transitions in quantum cascade structures, it is even more challenging to obtain desirable mid-infrared broadband light emitters. There have been great efforts in the past 20 years to pursue high-efficiency broadband optical gain and very low reflectivity in waveguide structures, which are two key factors determining the performance of broadband light emitters. Here we describe the realization of a high continuous wave light power of >20 mW and broadband width of >130 nm with near-infrared broadband light emitters and the first mid-infrared broadband light emitters operating under continuous wave mode at room temperature by employing a modulation p-doped InGaAs/GaAs quantum dot active region with a 'J'-shape ridge waveguide structure and a quantum cascade active region with a dual-end analogous monolithic integrated tapered waveguide structure, respectively. This work is of great importance to improve the performance of existing near-infrared optical coherence tomography systems and describes a major advance toward reliable and cost-effective mid-infrared imaging and sensing systems, which do not presently exist due to the lack of appropriate low-coherence mid-infrared semiconductor broadband light sources.","Near-UV electroluminescence in unipolar-doped, bipolar-tunneling GaN/AlN heterostructures.",https://www.ncbi.nlm.nih.gov/pubmed/30839526,"Light, science & applications",2019 03 08,"Cross-gap light emission is reported in n-type unipolar GaN/AlN double-barrier heterostructure diodes at room temperature.

In contrast to traditional GaN light emitters, p-type doping and p-contacts are completely avoided, and instead, holes are created in the GaN on the emitter side of the tunneling structure by direct interband (that is, Zener) tunneling from the valence band to the conduction band on the collector side. The Zener tunneling is enhanced by the high electric fields (~5 × 106 V cm-1) created by the notably large polarization-induced sheet charge at the interfaces between the AlN and GaN."

This neural network-based method is fast to compute and reconstructs phase and amplitude images of the objects using only one hologram, requiring fewer measurements in addition to being computationally faster.

Echocardiography and electrocardiogram were performed to assess kinetic and rhythm changes during 45 days of drug administration. At the end of study, type I and type III collagen were measured through immunohistochemistry analysis, and left ventricular pressure was assessed through invasive method. Echocardiography assessment showed increased relative wall thickness at 45 days in pimobendan group with significant diastolic dysfunction and increased collagen I deposition compared with nontreated positive group (3.03 ± 0.31 vs. 2.73 ± 0.28%, P < 0.05).

Next, we investigated the effects of 2-ME and 2-hydroxyestardiol (2-HE) on hypertension and cardiovascular and renal injury induced by chronic infusion of Ang II. Furthermore, the effects of 2-ME on blood pressure and cardiovascular remodeling in the constricted aorta (CA) rat model and on isoproterenol-induced (ISO) cardiac hypertrophy and fibrosis were examined. 2-ME had no effects on Ang II-induced acute changes in blood pressure, renal hemodynamics, or glomerular filtration rate. Both 2-ME and 2-HE reduced hypertension, cardiac hypertrophy, proteinuria, and mesangial expansion induced by chronic Ang II infusions. In CA rats, 2-ME attenuated cardiac hypertrophy and fibrosis and reduced elevated blood pressure above the constriction. Notably, 2-ME reduced both pressure-dependent (above constriction) and pressure-independent (below constriction) vascular remodeling. 2-ME had no effects on ISO-induced renin release yet reduced ISO-induced cardiac hypertrophy and fibrosis.

Therefore, there is an immense need for novel approaches to combating the issues surrounding such defects. Because of their accessibility, substantial proportion, and osteogenic differentiation potential, adipose-derived stem cells (ASCs) make for an ideal source of bone tissue in regenerative medicine. However, efficient induction of ASCs toward an osteoblastic lineage in vivo is met with challenges, and many signaling pathways must come together to secure osteoblastogenesis. Among them are bone morphogenic protein, wingless-related integration site protein, Notch, Hedgehog, fibroblast growth factor, vascular endothelial growth factor, and extracellular regulated-signal kinase. The goal of this literature review is to conglomerate the present research on these pathways to formulate a better understanding of how ASCs are most effectively transformed into bone in the context of tissue engineering.",Incidence and Severity of Maxillofacial Injuries During the Syrian Civil War in Syrian Soldiers and Civilians.,https://www.ncbi.nlm.nih.gov/pubmed/30839466,The Journal of craniofacial surgery,2019 06 05,"The aim of this study was to assess the maxillofacial injuries (MFIs) and our surgical approaches in the Syrian Civil War that emerged during the spring of 2011, among Syria's government and Syrians.",Prospective Clinical and Histologic Evaluation of Alveolar Socket Healing Following Ridge Preservation Using a Combination of Hydroxyapatite and Collagen Biomimetic Xenograft Versus Demineralized Bovine Bone.,https://www.ncbi.nlm.nih.gov/pubmed/30839465,The Journal of craniofacial surgery,2019 06 05,This prospective study is aimed at investigating clinically and histologically the effectiveness of a biomimetic magnesium-enriched-hydroxyapatite (MgHA)/collagen-based bone substitute for alveolar socket preservation.,The Effective Fixation Level for Cosmetic Lateral Canthoplasty.,https://www.ncbi.nlm.nih.gov/pubmed/30839464,The Journal of craniofacial surgery,2019 06 05,"In previous reports of lateral canthoplasty, the components of the inferior retinaculum were mostly secured to the lateral orbital rim at a level around the pupil or superior limbus.

The aim of this study was to compare anatomic and audiological results of cartilage graft with temporal fascia graft in type 1 tympanoplasty patients. We conducted a descriptive, retrospective study of medical records of patients who underwent tympanoplasty between January 2010 and December 2015 at the Department of Otolaryngology Head and Neck Surgery of Farhat Hached University Hospital. In total, we obtained 46 patients. Twenty-three patients who underwent type 1 cartilage tympanoplasty using cartilage graft were compared with 23 patients in whom temporal muscle fascia was used. In follow-up, residual perforation occurred in 1 of 23 patients (4.3%) undergoing cartilage tympanoplasty and in 2 of 23 patients undergoing fascia tympanoplasty (8.7%), which was found to be statistically non significant (P > 0.05). In both cartilage and fascia groups, when they were compared in terms of gain, no significant difference was found between groups (P = 0.271), air bone gap gain was found to be 12.9 ±9.9 decibels in cartilage group, whereas it was 10 ± 6.6 decibels in fascia group. Operation success is defined by successful anatomical and functional outcome. Among all patients, 35 (76%) were reported to have operation success. It was established that type of operation had no significant influence on success (P = 0.73). Currently, there is an increasing interest in using cartilage grafts in primary tympanoplasty.

A case of a 72-year-old man in whom an endoscopic technique was used to remove a dental implant that had been mistakenly planted into the maxillary sinus was reported in this study. The authors approached the sinus through the inferior nasal meatus, and the dental implant was removed through the widened ostium. The endoscopic surgical approach described in this study is reliable and minimally invasive for removing residual roots displaced into the maxillary sinus. Therefore, it has been concluded that this clinical procedure is worth using."

In this study, we conducted a longitudinal functional MRI study to test the hypothesis that the pain-relieving effect of ketamine is the result of reversal of abnormalities in regional low-frequency brain oscillations (LFOs) and abnormal cross-network functional connectivity (FC) of the dynamic pain connectome. We found that (1) ketamine decreased regional LFOs in the posterior cingulate cortex of the default mode network, (2) a machine-learning algorithm demonstrated that treatment-induced brain changes could be used to make generalizable inferences about pain relief, (3) treatment responders exhibited a significant decrease in cross-network static FC between the posterior cingulate cortex and regions of the sensorimotor and salience networks following treatment, (4) the degree of reduced cross-network FC correlated with the amount of pain relief, and (5) ketamine treatment did not produce significant differences in static or dynamic FC within the ascending nociceptive or descending antinociceptive pathway. These findings support the proposition that regional LFOs contribute to cross-network connectivity that underlie the effectiveness of ketamine to produce significant relief from neuropathic pain. Together with our recent findings that pretreatment dynamic FC of the descending antinociceptive pathway can predict ketamine treatment outcomes, these new findings indicate that pain relief from ketamine arises from a combination of flexible pretreatment FC of the descending antinocieptive pathway together with plasticity (reduction) of cross-network connectivity of the default mode network with sensorimotor and salience networks.",People in pain make poorer decisions.,https://www.ncbi.nlm.nih.gov/pubmed/30839432,Pain,2019 04 18,"Chronic pain affects 1 in 5 people and has been shown to disrupt attention.

In study 1, 1322 participants completed 2 tasks online: a shopping-decisions task and a measure of decision outcomes over the previous 10 years. Participants who were in pain during the study made more errors on the shopping task than those who were pain-free. Participants with a recurrent pain condition reported more negative outcomes from their past decisions than those without recurrent pain. In study 2, 44 healthy participants completed the shopping-decisions task with and without experimentally induced pain. Participants made more errors while in pain than while pain-free. We suggest that the disruptive effect of pain on attending translates into poorer decisions in more complex and ecologically valid contexts, that the effect is causal, and that the consequences are not only attentional but also financial."

Part B,2019 03 06,"Breech, family history, first born and female sex are the main risk factors described for developmental dysplasia of the hip (DDH). Foot abnormalities and oligohydramnios have also been listed. Recent studies have discredited torticollis, multiple gestation pregnancy, mode of delivery and prematurity as risk factors. Definition of oligohydramnios in the literature is inconsistent. Our aim was to investigate the term oligohydramnios and evaluate whether it should be considered a risk factor for DDH. All live births in our institution between 2001 and 2014 were included. We identified all pregnancies classed as reduced amniotic fluid (AF) or oligohydramnios over that period. Data on DDH, breech presentation, female sex and positive family history were collected. The significance level was set to 5%. We identified 73 990 live births, 3408 pregnancies were classed as reduced AF or oligohydramnios. The incidence of DDH (Graf type IIb and higher) was 1 : 1000 (75 babies, 18 bilateral). Oligohydramnios/reduced AF was found in 12 (16%) DDH babies. Breech presentation was found in 24 (32%), positive family history in 19 (25%) and female sex in 71 (94.7%). Oligohydramnios was found to be associated with a higher odds ratio (OR) for DDH [OR=3.9, 95% confidence interval (CI): 2.1-7.3] as were breech presentation (OR=10.6, 95% CI: 6.5-17.1) and female sex (OR=19.1, 95% CI: 7-52.4). All examined risk factors showed statistical significance (P<0.05). A regression analysis was performed to control for interactions and confounding factors and confirmed the findings. On the basis of our findings the diagnosis of reduced AF/oligohydramnios in consecutive antenatal sonographic scans should be regarded as an independent risk factor for DDH and be considered in any future studies regarding DDH. Level of evidence: Level IV: Case series."

Its histologic characteristic is the accumulation of neutrophils within the papillary dermis with granular deposition of immunoglobulin A (IgA) observed under direct immunofluorescence. Herein, we report a 58-year-old woman who presented with a vesicular rash on the buttocks. The patient reported a recent history of genital herpes, Entamoeba histolytica colitis, recurrent hives, and eczema. A representative biopsy demonstrated features of spongiotic dermatitis and focal papillary dermal neutrophilic aggregates. Direct immunofluorescence revealed fibrillary IgA deposition in the papillary dermis, granular C3 deposition at the dermal-epidermal junction, and dermal papillae. The overall clinical, histologic, and DIF findings were consistent with those of dermatitis herpetiformis. The fibrillar IgA pattern is rare and easily overlooked by the unwary.

The association of amyloidosis with alopecia is uncommon with at least 22 cases reported in the literature mostly in the setting of systemic amyloidosis. Alopecia in these patients occurs either as the initial presentation of the systemic amyloidosis or it happens during the disease course. The occurrence of amyloid alopecia associated with light chain (LC) restricted plasmacytic infiltrates in the absence of systemic amyloidosis, however, it is not well known. We report 3 cases of LC-associated amyloidosis presenting with alopecia, whereby there was evidence of a systemic plasma cell dyscrasia in 2 of the patients, one of whom developed multiple myeloma. None of the patients had systemic amyloidosis. Skin presentation in the patient with multiple myeloma was characterized by a diffuse form of alopecia affecting the entire scalp, eyebrow, and axillary and pubic hair in contrast to the localized form of alopecia noted in the other 2 patients. The mechanism by which LC-associated amyloidosis eventuates in this pattern of nonscarring alopecia potentially reflects the affinity of this form of amyloid for dermatan sulfate. Dermatan sulfate is found at highest concentrations within the adventitial dermis of the superficial to mid isthmic portions of the anagen hair follicles likely interfering with the hair cycle and induces early hair follicle involution. The result is a pattern of alopecia that can clinically and to some extent pathologically resemble either androgenetic alopecia or alopecia areata.",αEβ7 Expression Increases With the Extent of Cutaneous Involvement in Mycosis Fungoides.,https://www.ncbi.nlm.nih.gov/pubmed/30839339,The American Journal of dermatopathology,2019 03 06,Cell adhesion molecules are essential to lymphocyte migration in neoplastic and inflammatory skin diseases.

Since this time, HIV prevention changed from behavior modification to testing to treatment as prevention to chemoprophylaxis using HIV medications among HIV-negative persons. While these modifications have been heralded as public health successes, critical evaluations are needed. In this article, we present one such review in which we argue that HIV prevention, while previously disciplinary in the Foucauldian sense, has become controlling in the Deleuzian sense.

Local and federal solutions to the problem have had limited success because of the fragmentation of services and lack of valid and timely information. Billions of dollars spent to provide reliable, timely, and actionable information in health care have exposed the difficulty of establishing such a system using the prevalent information technology solutions. However, relying on successful examples of the use of blockchain to help refugee populations and poor farmers internationally, we have partnered to propose an innovative solution to this problem using the case of people experiencing homelessness in Austin, Texas. This paper aims to describe one of the first applications of blockchain technology for addressing homelessness in the United States by creating a digital identity for people experiencing homelessness and engaging emergency medical services and clinical providers. The authors argue that a lack of documentation to prove personal identity and the inability to access own records are major hurdles for empowering persons experiencing homelessness to be resilient and overcome the life challenges they face. Furthermore, it is argued that this lack of information causes misdiagnosis, duplication, and fragmentation in service delivery, which can be potentially addressed by blockchain technology. Further planning for creating a program on the ground with additional funding will demonstrate the results of using blockchain technology to establish digital identity for persons experiencing homelessness."

Background:
 Surgical site infections (SSIs) remains a concern for surgeons because of the negative impact on outcomes and health care costs. Our purpose was to assess whether topical antibiotics before primary incision closure reduced the rate of SSIs. 
Methods:
 Systematic review of MEDLINE/PubMed, Scopus, CINAHL, and Web of Science databases from inception to January 2017. Only randomized controlled trials (RCTs) were retrieved. The primary outcome was the SSI rate. Meta-analysis was complemented with trial sequential analysis (TSA). 
Results:
 Thirty-five RCTs (10,870 patients) were included. Only β-lactams and aminoglycosides were used. A substantial reduction of the incidence of SSIs with the application of antibiotic agents before incision closure (risk ratio [RR] 0.49, 95% confidence interval [CI] 0.37-0.64) was found, which remained in the analysis of 12 RCTs after removal of studies of uncertain quality. The use of β-lactams was effective to reduce SSI in elective surgery only (RR 0.33, 95% CI 0.13-0.85). In clean-contaminated fields and as an irrigation solution, β-lactams did not reduce the risk of SSI. Aminoglycosides were not effective (RR 0.74, 95% CI 0.49-1.10). After TSA, the evidence accumulated was far below the optimal information size. The heterogeneity of studies was high and methodological quality of most RCTs included in the meta-analysis was uncertain. 
Conclusions:
 Results of this meta-analysis show the data present in the literature are not sufficiently robust and, therefore, the use of topical β-lactams or aminoglycosides before incision closure to reduce SSI cannot be recommended or excluded.",Poly (ADP-Ribose) Polymerase Inhibition for Chemotherapy-Induced Peripheral Neuropathy: A Meta-Analysis of Placebo-Controlled Trials.,https://www.ncbi.nlm.nih.gov/pubmed/30839241,Journal of palliative medicine,2019 03 06,"Chemotherapy-induced peripheral neuropathy is characterized by pain, numbness, and tingling in the hands and feet and by diminished quality of life.

Background:
 Body weight reduction (BWR) of at least 3% in obese Japanese individuals through lifestyle interventions has improved the risk factors for cardiovascular disease (CVD). We aimed to assess the relation between body weight change (BWC) and CVD risk change and to identify lifestyle improvement related to BWR in obese Japanese individuals. 
Methods:
 Subjects were 2579 health checkup examinees without medicated diabetes, hypertension or dyslipidemia, and a body mass index ≥25 kg/m2 who completed lifestyle questionnaires in 2008 and 2012. The 4-year changes in fasting plasma glucose (FPG), glycated hemoglobin (HbA1c), lipids, and blood pressure (BP) levels were compared across the five groups based on the 4-year BWC, and presented as <-5%, -5% to -3%, -3% to -1%, -1% to 1%, and ≥1%. Multivariable logistic regression models were used to calculate odds ratios (ORs) and 95% confidence intervals (CI) for lifestyle improvement related to BWR. 
Results:
 Comparing the groups to the reference group (BWC ranging from -1% to +1%), we observed that FPG and HbA1c levels were lower in women in the <-5% group; BP levels were also lower in the <-5% group; triglyceride levels had improved in the <-3% group, and low-density lipoprotein cholesterol levels in the <-5% group; high-density lipoprotein cholesterol levels had improved in men in the <-5% group. In men, the adjusted OR (95% CI) for BWR related to lifestyle improvement pertaining to ""over 30 min exercise"" was 2.6 (2.0-3.6). In women, the adjusted ORs for BWR related to ""walking or physical activity,"" ""drinking alcohol,"" and ""drinking more than a glass of sake"" were 1.7 (1.1-2.7), 1.9 (1.1-3.5), and 1.8 (1.1-3.0), respectively. 
Conclusions:
 A 5% BWR improved FPG and HbA1c levels in obese women, and BP and lipid levels in obese men.

Background:
 The incidence of diabetes is rising, and with it, the number of pregnancies affected by diabetes. U.S. black women have a disproportionately high prevalence of diabetes and lower rates of breastfeeding. 
Objective:
 The objective of this study was to quantify the relationship between diabetes before pregnancy and breastfeeding duration among black women in the United States. 
Materials and Methods:
 We analyzed women from the Black Women's Health Study (N = 59,000) to assess the relationship between prepregnancy diabetes and time to breastfeeding cessation occurring up to 24 months postdelivery using Kaplan-Meier survival curves, log rank tests, and Cox proportional hazards models. The study population included primiparous women with births between 1995 and 2009 (N = 3,404). Obesity, hypertension before pregnancy, and family history of diabetes were examined for effect modification. 
Results:
 Survival curves demonstrated a markedly reduced duration of breastfeeding in women who had been diagnosed with prepregnancy diabetes (p < 0.01). The hazard ratio for breastfeeding cessation for women with prepregnancy diabetes was 1.5 (95% confidence interval 1.1-2.0) compared with women without prepregnancy diabetes after control for age, body mass index (BMI) at age 18, prepregnancy BMI, other metabolic factors, demographics, and health behaviors. 
Conclusions:
 Our results suggest that prepregnancy diabetes is a strong predictor of curtailed breastfeeding duration, even after control for BMI. This underscores the need for targeted lactation support for diabetic women."

B,2019 04 04,"The outer membrane channel OprD from Pseudomonas aeruginosa transports basic amino acids and clinically relevant carbapenem antibiotics. Understanding the molecular basis of substrate permeation across this channel will therefore lead to better therapeutic designs to treat infections. Using umbrella sampling simulations, we calculated the potential of mean force (PMF) for the arginine permeation pathway through OprD. The PMF reveals a deep free energy well of ∼6 kT around the putative substrate binding site followed by a shallower well of ∼4 kT close to the most constricted region of the pore. Despite becoming partially dehydrated during translocation, some water molecules are retained to shield the guanidinium side chain of arginine from the ladder of basic residues in the protein. Sugars of the lipopolysaccharide headgroups form contacts with arginine and could potentially play an important role in transferring substrate from the external medium to OprD. The PMF through bulk membrane shows a large energetic barrier of ∼45 kT within the hydrophobic core of the membrane, suggesting that spontaneous translocation without OprD is highly unlikely. This significant energetic penalty is likely caused by the extensive distortion of the lower leaflet of the outer membrane as phospholipid headgroups sink inwards to interact with charged groups of arginine. Our results provide quantitative insights into solute permeation across the bacterial outer membrane.",Honeybee Pollen Load: Phenolic Composition and Antimicrobial Activity and Antioxidant Capacity.,https://www.ncbi.nlm.nih.gov/pubmed/30839214,Journal of natural products,2019 03 22,"Honeybee pollen loads result from the agglutination of pollen grains and salivary secretions of bees. The potential use of honeybee pollen as a food supplement greatly depends on its chemical composition, which varies depending on the botanical and geographical origin of the pollen grains. This study aimed to characterize the botanical origin, chemical composition, and antioxidant and antibacterial activities of honeybee pollen from the V Region of Chile. The introduced species Brassica rapa and Eschscholzia californica predominated in the bee pollen analyzed. The honeybee pollen extracts showed antioxidant and antibacterial properties, specifically against the pathogenic microorganism Streptococcus pyogenes. Quercetin and myricetin were found in all samples in large concentrations. The separation of pollen loads from a multifloral sample demonstrated that E. californica pollen loads are responsible for antibacterial activity. This sample also showed a high concentration of quercetin (304.8 mg/100 g of bee pollen). Based on the present results, honeybee pollen from the V Region of Chile has been found to exhibit antioxidant and antimicrobial activities. Furthermore, it is proposed to use quercetin as a quality indicator for honeybee pollen from this region of Chile. These results should help establish better quality control criteria for Chilean honeybee pollen and its potential use as a functional ingredient.",Adsorption of Formamide at the Surface of Amorphous and Crystalline Ices under Interstellar and Tropospheric Conditions. A Grand Canonical Monte Carlo Simulation Study.,https://www.ncbi.nlm.nih.gov/pubmed/30839213,The journal of physical chemistry. A,2019 04 05,"The adsorption of formamide is studied both at the surface of crystalline (Ih) ice at 200 K and at the surface of low density amorphous (LDA) ice in the temperature range of 50-200 K by grand canonical Monte Carlo (GCMC) simulation. These systems are characteristic of the upper troposphere and of the interstellar medium (ISM), respectively. Our results reveal that while no considerable amount of formamide is dissolved in the bulk ice phase in any case, the adsorption of formamide at the ice surface under these conditions is a very strongly preferred process, which has to be taken into account when studying the chemical reactivity in these environments. The adsorption is found to lead to the formation of multimolecular adsorption layer, the occurrence of which somewhat precedes the saturation of the first molecular layer. Due to the strong lateral interaction acting between the adsorbed formamide molecules, the adsorption isotherm does not follow the Langmuir shape. Adsorption is found to be slightly stronger on LDA than Ih ice under identical thermodynamic conditions, due to the larger surface area exposed to the adsorption. Indeed, the monomolecular adsorption capacity of the LDA and Ih ice surfaces is found to be 10.5 ± 0.7 μmol/m2 and 9.4 μmol/m2, respectively. The first layer formamide molecules are very strongly bound to the ice surface, forming typically four hydrogen bonds with each other and the surface water molecules. The heat of adsorption at infinitely low surface coverage is found to be -105.6 kJ/mol on Ih ice at 200 K.",Structural Characterization of Cranberry Arabinoxyloglucan Oligosaccharides.,https://www.ncbi.nlm.nih.gov/pubmed/30839212,Journal of natural products,2019 03 22,"Cranberry ( Vaccinium macrocarpon) products are widely available in North American food, juice, and dietary supplement markets. The use of cranberry is popular for the prevention of urinary tract infections (UTIs) and other reported health benefits. Preliminary findings by our research group indicate that arabinoxyloglucan oligosaccharides are present in cranberry products and may contribute to the antiadhesion properties of urine produced after cranberry consumption, but relatively little is known regarding the oligosaccharide components of cranberry. This report describes the isolation from two cranberry sources and the complete structure elucidation of two arabinoxyloglucan oligosaccharides through the use of carbohydrate-specific NMR spectroscopic and chemical derivatization methods.

Selected fractions and the isolated compounds were subjected to antimicrobial, cell viability, and E. coli antiadhesion assays. Results indicated that enriched fractions and purified compounds lacked antimicrobial and cytotoxic effects, supporting the potential use of such compounds for disease prevention without the risk for resistance development. Preliminary antiadhesion results indicated that mixtures of oligosaccharides exhibited greater antiadhesion properties than purified fractions or pure compounds.

In order to verify that the quality of our devices is not compromised, we compare the electronic transport response of different sample geometries, paying close attention to fragile quantum states, such as the fractional quantum Hall states that are highly susceptible to disorder. The ability to define local depletion regions without compromising device quality establishes a new approach toward structuring graphene-based quantum transport devices.",Simulation-Guided Rational de Novo Design of a Small Pore-Forming Antimicrobial Peptide.,https://www.ncbi.nlm.nih.gov/pubmed/30839209,Journal of the American Chemical Society,2019 06 10,"In the age of failing small-molecule antibiotics, tapping the near-infinite structural and chemical repertoire of antimicrobial peptides (AMPs) offers one of the most promising routes toward developing next-generation antibacterial compounds. One of the key impediments en route is the lack of methodologies for systematic rational design and optimization of new AMPs. Here we present a new simulation-guided rational design approach and apply it to develop a potent new AMP. We show that unbiased atomic detail molecular dynamics (MD) simulations are able to predict structures formed by evolving peptide designs enabling structure-based rational fine-tuning of functional properties. Starting from a 14-residue poly leucine template we demonstrate the design of a minimalistic potent new AMP. Consisting of only four types of amino acids (LDKA), this peptide forms large pores in microbial membranes at very low peptide-to-lipid ratios (1:1000) and exhibits low micromolar activity against common Gram-positive and Gram-negative pathogenic bacteria. Remarkably, the four amino acids were sufficient to encode preferential poration of bacterial membranes with negligible damage to red blood cells at bactericidal concentrations. As the sequence is too short to span cellular membranes, pores are formed by stacking of channels in each bilayer leaflet.",Proteasome Activation as a New Therapeutic Approach To Target Proteotoxic Disorders.,https://www.ncbi.nlm.nih.gov/pubmed/30839208,Journal of medicinal chemistry,2019 03 14,"Proteasomes are multienzyme complexes that maintain protein homeostasis (proteostasis) and important cellular functions through the degradation of misfolded, redundant, and damaged proteins. It is well established that aging is associated with the accumulation of damaged and misfolded proteins. This phenomenon is paralleled by declined proteasome activity. When the accumulation of redundant proteins exceed degradation, undesirable signaling and/or aggregation occurs and are the hallmarks of neurodegenerative diseases and many cancers. Thus, increasing proteasome activity has been recognized as a new approach to delay the onset or ameliorate the symptoms of neurodegenerative and other proteotoxic disorders. Enhancement of proteasome activity has many therapeutic potentials but is still a relatively unexplored field. In this perspective, we review current approaches, genetic manipulation, posttranslational modification, and small molecule proteasome agonists used to increase proteasome activity, challenges facing the field, and applications beyond aging and neurodegenerative diseases.",Ultrathin Black Phosphorus-on-Nitrogen Doped Graphene for Efficient Overall Water Splitting: Dual Modulation Roles of Directional Interfacial Charge Transfer.,https://www.ncbi.nlm.nih.gov/pubmed/30839207,Journal of the American Chemical Society,2019 03 27,"Few-layered exfoliated black phosphorus (EBP) has attracted surging interest for electronics, optoelectronics, and catalysis. As compared to excellent progress in electronic and optoelectronic applications, very few reports are available for electrocatalysis by metal-free EBPs. Herein, we couple solution-processable ultrathin EBP nanosheets with higher Fermi level of N-doped graphene (NG) into a new metal-free 2D/2D heterostructure (EBP@NG) with well-designed interfaces and unique electronic configuration, as efficient and durable bifunctional catalysts toward hydrogen evolution and oxygen evolution reactions (HER/OER) for overall water splitting in alkaline media. By rational interface engineering, the synergy of EBP and NG is fully exploited, which not only improves the stability of EBP, but also effectively modulates electronic structures of each component to boost their intrinsic activities. Specifically, due to the lower Fermi level of EBP relative to NG, their electronic interaction induces directional interfacial electron transfer, which not only enriches the electron density over EBP and optimizes H adsorption/desorption to promote HER, but also introduces abundant positively charged carbon sites on NG and provides favorable formation of key OER intermediates (OOH*) to improve OER energetics. Thus, despite that pure EBP or NG alone has poor or negligible activity, EBP@NG achieves remarkably enhanced bifunctional HER/OER activities, along with an excellent durability. This endows an optimized electrolyzer using EBP@NG as anode and cathode with a low cell voltage of 1.54 V at 10 mA cm-2, which is smaller than that of the costly integrated Pt/C@RuO2 couple (1.60 V).",Simultaneous Determination of Acrylamide and 5-Hydroxymethylfurfural in Heat-Processed Foods Employing Enhanced Matrix Removal-Lipid as a New Dispersive Solid-Phase Extraction Sorbent Followed by Liquid Chromatography-Tandem Mass Spectrometry.,https://www.ncbi.nlm.nih.gov/pubmed/30839206,Journal of agricultural and food chemistry,2019 05 01,"The goal of this study was to develop a method for simultaneous determination of acrylamide (AA) and 5-hydroxymethylfurfural (5-HMF) in heat-processed foods by liquid chromatography-tandem mass spectrometry analysis.

Selecting polyurea aerogels as a model system with demonstrated potential for rich nanomorphology and guided by a statistical design-of-experiments model, we prepared a large array of materials (208) with identical chemical composition but quite different nanostructures. By reflecting on SEM imaging, it was realized that our first preverbal impression about a nanostructure is related to its openness and texture; the former is quantified by porosity ( Π), and the latter is oftentimes related to hydrophobicity, which, in turn, is quantified by the contact angle (θ) of water droplets resting on the material. Herewith, the θ-to-Π ratio is referred to as the K-index, and it was noticed that all polyurea samples of this study could be put in eight K-index groups with separate nanomorphologies ranging from caterpillar-like assemblies of nanoparticles, to thin nanofibers, to cocoon-like structures, to large bald microspheres. A first validation of the K-index as a morphology descriptor was based on compressing samples to different strains: it was observed that as the porosity decreases, the water-contact angle decreases proportionally, and thereby the K-index remains constant. The predictive power of the K-index was demonstrated with 20 polyurea aerogels prepared in 8 binary solvent systems. Subsequently, several material properties were correlated to nanomorphology through the K-index and that, in turn, provided insight about the root cause of the diversity of the nanostructure in polyurea aerogels. Finally, using response surface methodology, K-indexes and other material properties of practical interest were correlated to the monomer, water, and catalyst concentrations as well as the three Hansen solubility parameters of the sol. That enabled the synthesis of materials with up to six prescribed properties at a time, including nanomorphology, bulk density, BET surface area, elastic modulus, ultimate compressive strength, and thermal conductivity."

The good blocking ability for LiPSs indicates that these interlayers can promote the electrochemistry performance with high S loading. However, most of these interlayers are just used as a simple blocking wall. Such a blocking wall, for example, the lower Li+ ion conductivity, would often reduce the electrochemical performance, especially under large current density. Here, we report a multifunctional ion-sieve made by three two-dimensional (2D) sheets, graphitic carbon nitride (g-C3N4), boron nitride (BN), and graphene. A g-C3N4 sheet which possesses orderly channels with a size of 3 Å in the crystalline structure can effectively prevent polysulfides from passing through but allow lithium ions to pass freely, whereas a BN sheet acts as an excellent catalyst for sulfur redox, and graphene acts as an extended collector, which can promote the conductivity of the sulfur electrode region. Benefiting from the synergistic effect among these 2D materials, the ion-sieve interlayer makes the Li-S battery show excellent performance at a large rate with both high sulfur loadings and high sulfur content. In addition, the host materials are not necessary in these cells. The ion-sieve liberated a discharge capacity of about 600 mA h g-1 after 500 cycles at 1 C, and the capacity attenuation was less than 0.01% per cycle with a 6 mg cm-2 areal S-loading (pure S as the active material). The reversible capacity could be maintained at more than 400 mA h g-1 at 2 C, which amounts to an area current density of 26.88 mA cm-2.",Enhancing Photostability of Perovskite Solar Cells by Eu(TTA)2(Phen)MAA Interfacial Modification.,https://www.ncbi.nlm.nih.gov/pubmed/30839191,ACS applied materials & interfaces,2019 03 28,"Organic-inorganic lead halide perovskite solar cells (PSCs) exhibit spectacular changes in the photovoltaic area, but they still face the challenges of full spectral utilization and photostability under continuous light irradiation. The ultraviolet (UV) part in sunlight could induce oxygen vacancy in the mesoporous TiO2 (m-TiO2) layer, resulting in the degradation of perovskite photoactive films and the rapidly decreased device performance. In this work, we demonstrate that an effective luminescent downconversion material, Eu(TTA)2(Phen)MAA (ETPM), can be used as an interfacial modifier between the m-TiO2 layer and the perovskite photoactive layer to improve the power conversion efficiency (PCE) from 17.00 to 19.07%. The improved device performance can be ascribed to the effective utilization of incident UV light and reduced carrier recombination. Meanwhile, the conversion of the UV light by ETPM could inhibit the stability loss of the device under irradiation. As a result, the modified PSCs can maintain 86% of their initial value under continuous light soaking for 100 h, higher than that of 40% for the control device. This work indicates that the introduction of the luminescent downconversion material ETPM can successfully improve the PCE and photostability of PSCs.",Flexible 64 × 64 Pixel AMOLED Displays Driven by Uniform Carbon Nanotube Thin-Film Transistors.,https://www.ncbi.nlm.nih.gov/pubmed/30839190,ACS applied materials & interfaces,2019 03 28,"Carbon nanotube (CNT) thin-film transistors are expected to be promising for use in flexible electronics including flexible and transparent integrated circuits and in wearable chemical and physical sensors and for driving the circuits of flexible display panels. However, current devices based on CNT channels suffer from poor performance uniformity and low manufacturing yield; therefore, they are still far from being practical. This is usually caused by nonuniform deposition of the semiconducting CNTs and the rough surface of flexible substrates. Here, we report CNT thin-film transistors (TFTs) driving a flexible 64 × 64 pixel active matrix light-emitting diode display (AMOLED) by improving the formation of uniform CNT films and developing a new pretreatment technique for flexible substrates. The achieved AMOLED has uniform brightness and a high yield of 99.93% in its 4096 pixels. More than 8000 TFTs with high-purity semiconducting CNTs as the channel material show an average on-off current ratio of ∼107 and a carrier mobility of 16 cm2 V-1 s-1. The standard deviations of the on-state current and the carrier mobility are 4.1 and 6.5%, respectively. Our result shows that the panel driven by high-purity semiconducting CNTs is a promising strategy for the development of next-generation flexible, large-area displays.","Kirkendall Growth and Ostwald Ripening Induced Hierarchical Morphology of Ni-Co LDH/MMoS x (M = Co, Ni, and Zn) Heteronanostructures as Advanced Electrode Materials for Asymmetric Solid-State Supercapacitors.",https://www.ncbi.nlm.nih.gov/pubmed/30839189,ACS applied materials & interfaces,2019 03 28,"By changing the mixed metal sulfide composition, morphology tuning of an active electrode material can be possible, which can have a huge impact on its electrochemical performance. Here, effective morphology tuning of Ni-Co layered double hydroxide (LDH)/MMoS x (M = Co, Ni, and Zn) heteronanostructures is demonstrated by varying the composition of MMoS x. Taking advantage of the benefits associated with Kirkendall growth and Ostwald ripening, tunable morphologies were successfully achieved. Among the Ni-Co LDH/MMoS x (M = Co, Ni, and Zn) heteronanostructures, a Ni-Co LDH/NiMoS x core-shell structured electrode delivered a high specific capacity of 404 mAh g-1 at 3 mA cm-2 and an extraordinary cycling stability (after 10 000 cycles) of 93.2% at 50 mA cm-2. In addition, an asymmetric supercapacitor (ASC) device coupled with Ni-Co LDH/NiMoS x as the cathode and Fe2O3/reduced graphene oxide as the anode exhibited excellent cell capacity and extraordinary cycling stability. Moreover, the ASC device provided a very high specific energy of 72.6 Wh kg-1 at a specific power of 522.7 W kg-1 and maintained the specific power of 23.5 Wh kg-1 at 5357.6 W kg-1, demonstrating its high applicability to energy storage devices.",Conversion of MoS2 to a Ternary MoS2- xSe x Alloy for High-Performance Sodium-Ion Batteries.,https://www.ncbi.nlm.nih.gov/pubmed/30839188,ACS applied materials & interfaces,2019 03 28,"MoS2 has attracted tremendous attention as an anode for Na-ion batteries (NIBs) owing to its high specific capacity and layered graphite-like structure. Herein, MoS2 is converted to a ternary MoS2- xSe x alloy through the selenizing process in order to boost the electrochemical performance for Na-ion batteries. Conversion of MoS2 to MoS2- xSe x expands interlayer spacing, improves electronic conductivity, and creates more defects. The expanded interlayer spacing decreases Na+ diffusion resistance and facilitates Na+ fast transfer. The integrated graphene as a conductive network offers effective pathway for electron migration and maintains structural stability of electrodes during cycles. The ternary MoS1.2Se0.8/graphene (MoS1.2Se0.8/G) electrode demonstrates an extremely high reversible capacity of 509 mA h g-1 after 200 cycles at 0.1 A g-1 (capacity retention of 109%) as an anode for sodium-ion batteries. Even at 2 A g-1 and after 700 cycles, the MoS1.2Se0.8/G electrode also displays a relatively high reversible capacity of 178 mA h g-1. Full cells assembled with Na3V2(PO4)2F3 cathodes and MoS1.2Se0.8/G anodes reveal high charge/discharge capacities. This work demonstrates that the ternary MoS2- xSe x alloy could be a potential anode material for Na-ion storage.",Self-Supporting Hybrid Fiber Mats of Cu3P-Co2P/N-C Endowed with Enhanced Lithium/Sodium Ions Storage Performances.,https://www.ncbi.nlm.nih.gov/pubmed/30839187,ACS applied materials & interfaces,2019 03 28,"Recently, Cu3P has been targeted as an alternative anode material for alkali-metal-ion batteries because of their safety potential and high volumetric capacity. However, designing a high-rate Cu3P electrode with long durability is still faced with huge challenges. Here, we report a self-supporting three-dimensional (3D) composite of Cu3P and Co2P interconnected by N-doped C fibers (Cu3P-Co2P/N-C). The advanced 3D structure not only provides fast reaction kinetics but also improves the structural stability, leading to excellent rate capability and long-term cycling stability, and pseudocapacitance behavior is also beneficial to the high rate performance. Additionally, the synergistic effects between Cu3P, Co2P, and N-doped carbon can increase the electrical conductivity and active sites, ensuring more ion storage. The Cu3P-Co2P/N-C anode for lithium-ion batteries delivers high discharge capacity, superior rate performance, and ultralong lifespan over 2000 cycles accompanied by a stable capacity of around 316.9 mAh/g at 5 A/g. When the 3D structured material works in sodium-ion batteries, it also displays improved electrochemical performance.

Noteworthy, metal-organic framework (MOF) nanoparticles are excellent examples to meet this idea. Current approaches for multifunctional MOFs are mainly based on encapsulation of functional molecules or multistep modification; however, high risk for leakage and burst release and time-consuming and complicated organic synthesis limit their applications. Here, we report a one-pot approach to build the defect structure of a metal organic framework with near-infrared dye (cypate), which is based on the interaction between Fe3+ and carboxyl group of cypate molecules, to construct a multifunctional MOF. Moreover, this system can achieve multimodal imaging guided phototherapy. Subsequently, the precise cancer phototherapy is investigated in vivo, and the tumors are entirely eliminated without obvious side effects, demonstrating the high efficacy and safety of this multifunctional platform. Hence, it is expected that not only this system is simple, safe, and highly effective but also our method of creating defect structures of MOFs will open a new way to develop multifunctional nanoplatforms for bioapplications.",Water-Evaporation-Powered Fast Actuators with Multimodal Motion Based on Robust Nacre-Mimetic Composite Film.,https://www.ncbi.nlm.nih.gov/pubmed/30839185,ACS applied materials & interfaces,2019 04 05,"Water evaporation as a source of energy to trigger moisture-responsive soft materials is an emerging field in a variety of energy-harvesting devices, which has attracted widespread attention. Here, we design and fabricate bioinspired nacrelike composite film actuators consisting of graphene oxide and sodium alginate, which demonstrate an obvious shrinkage in volume when their state transfers from wet to dry and the contractile stress is up to 42.3 MPa. Based on these features, the film actuators can show rapid and continuous movements under the water gradient. The flipping frequency of the actuators can reach up to 76 rounds min-1, which is much faster than those in previous reports. The film can flap back and forth quickly on water vapor even after loading a cargo that is 9 times its own weight. Moreover, high mobility with multimodal motion including blooming, stretching, folding, and twisting can also be achieved by modulating the shapes of films. Thus, film actuators may hold great potential in many fields, such as microrobots, artificial muscles, and sensors on grounds of their rapid response speed and adjustable motion models.",MOP × MOF: Collaborative Combination of Metal-Organic Polyhedra and Metal-Organic Framework for Proton Conductivity.,https://www.ncbi.nlm.nih.gov/pubmed/30839184,ACS applied materials & interfaces,2019 04 05,"We report a hybrid solid system, UMOM-100-a and UMOM-100-b, synthesized by incorporation of Cu-based metal-organic polyhedra (MOPs) into a porous metal-organic framework (MOF) host, PCN-777. The MOP guests have acid (SO3-) functional groups, acting as functionalized nanocages, whereas the porosity is still maintained for proton conductivity. The key parameter for the UMOM-100 series is the number of MOPs inside a MOF, which controls the ratio between meso- and micropores, polarity, and finally proton conductivity. This is an example demonstrating a new design strategy for porous solids to add active components into porous MOFs, opening up possibilities in other applications such as solid-state electrolytes and heterogeneous catalysts.",Early Onset Neonatal E.Coli Sepsis,https://www.ncbi.nlm.nih.gov/pubmed/30839183,Irish medical journal,2019 03 07,"This was a retrospective case-control study over 14 years comparing characteristics of neonates who developed E.coli bacteraemia with matched infant controls whose mothers were colonised with E.coli on high vaginal swab but who did not develop bacteraemia. Data was obtained from maternal and neonatal charts, the laboratory data-base was analysed to identify possible risk factors for E.coli bacteraemia. 21 cases and 38 controls were identified. The data showed no difference in gender, maternal age, white cell count, or cord pH. Significant differences were found in gestation (33 vs. 39.5wks p<0.01), weight (1.64 vs. 3.08 kg p<0.001) and duration of preterm, pre-labour rupture of membranes (pPROM) (6 vs. 2.9 days p=0.04) between cases and controls. Risk factors for E.coli bacte-raemia were identified, most notably duration of pPROM. A re-evaluation of antimicrobial therapy in neonates with a maternal pPROM >5 days is advised."
