For the adjustment, two novel scene segmentation approaches based on luminance distribution are also proposed. Multi-exposure image fusion is a method for producing images that are expected to be more informative and perceptually appealing than any of the input ones, by directly fusing photos taken with different exposures. However, existing fusion methods often produce unclear fused images when input images do not have a sufficient number of different exposure levels. In this paper, we point out that adjusting the luminance of input images makes it possible to improve the quality of the final fused images. This insight is the basis of the proposed method. The proposed method enables us to produce high-quality images, even when undesirable inputs are given. Visual comparison results show that the proposed method can produce images that clearly represent a whole scene. In addition, multi-exposure image fusion with the proposed method outperforms state-of-the-art fusion methods in terms of MEF-SSIM, discrete entropy, tone mapped image quality index, and statistical naturalness.",Structural Similarity based Nonlocal Variational Models for Image Restoration.,https://www.ncbi.nlm.nih.gov/pubmed/30908219,IEEE transactions on image processing : a publication of the IEEE Signal Processing Society,2019 03 25,"In this paper, we propose and develop a novel nonlocal variational technique based on structural similar- ity (SS) information for image restoration problems. In the literature, patches extracted from images are compared ac- cording to their pixel values, and then nonlocal filtering can be employed for image restoration. The disadvantage of this approach is that intensity based patch distance may not be effective in image restoration, especially for images containing texture or structural information. The main aim of this paper is to propose to use SS between image patches to develop nonlocal regularization models. In particular, two types of nonlocal regularizing functions are studied: a SS based nonlocal quadratic function (SS-NLH1) and a SS based nonlocal total variation function (SS-NLTV) for reg- ularization of image restoration problems. Moreover, we employ iterative algorithms to solve these SS-NLH1 and SS-NLTV variational models numerically, and discuss the convergence of these algorithms. Experimental results are presented to demonstrate the effectiveness of the proposed models.",LMR: Learning A Two-class Classifier for Mismatch Removal.,https://www.ncbi.nlm.nih.gov/pubmed/30908218,IEEE transactions on image processing : a publication of the IEEE Signal Processing Society,2019 03 25,"Feature matching, which refers to establishing reliable correspondences between two sets of features, is a critical prerequisite in a wide spectrum of vision-based tasks. Existing attempts typically involve the mismatch removal from a set of putative matches based on estimating the underlying image transformation. However, the transformation could vary with different data. Thus a pre-defined transformation model is often demanded, which severely limits the applicability. From a novel perspective, this paper casts the mismatch removal into a two-class classification problem, learning a general classifier to determine the correctness of an arbitrary putative match, termed as Learning for Mismatch Removal (LMR). The classifier is trained based on a general match representation associated with each putative match through exploiting the consensus of local neighborhood structures based on a multiple K-nearest neighbors strategy. With only 10 training image pairs involving about 8,000 putative matches, the learned classifier can generate promising matching results with linearithmic time complexity on arbitrary testing data. The generality and robustness of our approach are verified under several representative supervised learning techniques as well as different training and testing data. Extensive experiments on feature matching, visual homing, and near-duplicate image retrieval are conducted to reveal the superiority of our LMR over the state-of-the-art competitors.",Illumination Estimation and Compensation of Low Frame Rate Video Sequences for Wavelet-Based Video Compression.,https://www.ncbi.nlm.nih.gov/pubmed/30908217,IEEE transactions on image processing : a publication of the IEEE Signal Processing Society,2019 03 25,"In this paper, we are interested in the compression of image sets or video with considerable changes in illumination. We develop a framework to decompose frames into illumination fields and texture in order to achieve sparser representations of frames which is beneficial for compression. Illumination variations or contrast ratio factors among frames are described by a full resolution multiplicative field. First, we propose a Lifting-based Illumination Adaptive Transform (LIAT) framework which incorporates illumination compensation to temporal wavelet transforms. We estimate a full resolution illumination field, taking heed of its spatial sparsity by a rate-distortion (RD) driven framework. An affine mesh model is also developed as a point of comparison. We find the operational coding cost of the subband frames by modeling a typical t+2D wavelet video coding system. While our general findings on R-D optimization are applicable to a range of coding frameworks, in this paper we report results based on employing JPEG 2000 coding tools. Experimental results highlight the benefits of the proposed R-D driven illumination estimation and compensation in comparison with alternative scalable coding methods and non-scalable coding schemes of AVC and HEVC employing weighted prediction.",Dispersion-Engineered Guided-Wave Resonators in Anisotropic Single-Crystal Substrates - Part I: Concept and Analytical Design.,https://www.ncbi.nlm.nih.gov/pubmed/30908216,"IEEE transactions on ultrasonics, ferroelectrics, and frequency control",2019 03 25,"This paper presents an analytical approach for implementation of high quality-factor (Q) resonators with arbitrary cross-sectional vibration mode-shapes in anisotropic single-crystal substrates. A closed-form dispersion relation is analytically derived to characterize the dynamics of guided waves in rectangular waveguides. Three categories of waves with propagating, standing-evanescent and propagating-evanescent dynamics are identified and used for energy localization of acoustic excitations with arbitrary cross-sectional vibration patterns. An analytical design procedure is presented for dispersion engineering of waveguides to realize high-Q resonators without the need for geometrical suspension through narrow tethers or rigid anchors. The effectiveness of the dispersion engineering methodology is verified through development of experimental test-vehicles in 20㯌m-thick single-crystal silicon substrate with 500nm aluminum nitride transducers. Various proof-of-concept resonators, representing guided waves with different dispersion types, are presented and compared to highlight the optimum design procedures for Q enhancement and spurious mode suppression. Part I of this paper presents the operation principle of guided wave resonators based on analytical derivation of dispersion relation followed by a systematic resonator design procedure. Numerical and experimental characterization for verification of the proposed design procedure and extensive measurement data on proof-of-concept resonators are presented in Part II.",CMUT Electrode Resistance Design: Modelling and Experimental Verification by a Row-Column Array.,https://www.ncbi.nlm.nih.gov/pubmed/30908215,"IEEE transactions on ultrasonics, ferroelectrics, and frequency control",2019 03 25,"This paper addresses the importance of having control over the resistivity of the electrodes for capacitive micromachined ultrasonic transducers (CMUT) devices. The electrode resistivity can vary depending on the fabrication technology used, and resistivity control becomes especially important in the cases where metal electrodes can not be used. This raises the question: When is the resistivity of an electrode sufficiently low? To answer this question we have developed a simple design criterion. The criterion describes the attenuation of AC signals along a CMUT element. It is shown that the non-dimensional product between angular excitation frequency, resistance, and capacitance ωRC of an element has to be smaller than 0.35 to ensure an AC potential drop along the element of less than 1%. The optimal magnitude and directionality of the transmit pressure will be achieved if CMUT elements are designed according to the developed criteria. Hence, the model can be used to estimate device parameters that will ensure the CMUT is suitable for generating ultrasound images. An example is given where the model is used to predict the required electrode thickness for structured electrodes made of Gold, Aluminium, and Indium-Tin-Oxide, respectively. To verify the model, two Row-Column addressed (RCA) CMUT transducers were used to illustrate the effect of high and low electrode resistivity. One transducer had a sufficient electrode resistivity, and the other had an insufficient electrode resistivity. The RCA CMUT transducers were fabricated using fusion bonding, where the top electrode is made of aluminium and the bottom electrode is made of doped silicon. The resistivity of the aluminium top electrode is 2×10-6 Ωcm for both transducers, whereas the resistivity for the bottom electrode is 0.1 Ωcm for the first transducer and 0.005 Ωcm for the second transducer. The transducer with low resistivity emits pressure uniformly along both the rows and columns, whereas the transmit pressure field from the other transducer has a uniformly distributed pressure field along the rows, but a decreasing pressure field along the columns due to the high resistivity in the bottom electrode. The pressure drop, along the columns is frequency dependent and has been observed to be 63%, 74%, and 82% for the excitation frequencies 2 MHz, 4.5 MHz, and 7 MHz, respectively.",Miniature Transducer Using PNN-PZT-based Ceramic for Intravascular Ultrasound.,https://www.ncbi.nlm.nih.gov/pubmed/30908214,"IEEE transactions on ultrasonics, ferroelectrics, and frequency control",2019 04 01,"In this work, the development and performance evaluation of a high-frequency miniature ultrasonic transducer based on a Pb(Ni1/3Nb2/3)O3-Pb(Zr0.3Ti0.7)O3 (PNN-PZT-based) ceramic for intravascular imaging application are reported. The fabricated PNN-PZT-based ceramic possesses ultrahigh relative clamped dielectric permittivity (.S/.0 = 3409) and high electromechanical coupling capability (kt = 0.60). A 42-MHz high-frequency side-looking ultrasonic transducer probe using the PNN-PZT-based ceramic with a miniature aperture of 0.33 mm × 0.33 mm was designed and fabricated, which exhibited a wide -6 dB bandwidth of 79% and an insertion loss of -19.6 dB. High spatial resolution, including the axial resolution of 36 μm and lateral resolution of 141 μm, was determined by imaging a 13-μm tungsten wire phantom. Ex vivo intravascular ultrasound (IVUS) imaging of a porcine coronary artery was performed to show the imaging capability of the miniature transducer. The results demonstrated the great potential of PNN-PZT-based ceramic for high-resolution miniature transducers application.",Fast Orthogonal Row-Column Electronic Scanning (FORCES) Experiments and Comparisons.,https://www.ncbi.nlm.nih.gov/pubmed/30908213,"IEEE transactions on ultrasonics, ferroelectrics, and frequency control",2019 03 25,"Three-dimensional ultrasound imaging presents technical challenges of addressing large numbers of elements in 2D array transducers. Top-Orthogonal to Bottom Electrode (TOBE) 2D transducer arrays can simplify addressing but typical imaging methods with such arrays enable only one-way focusing in azimuth and elevation. Here experimental results are reported for the Fast Orthogonal Row-Column Electronic Scanning (FORCES) imaging scheme implemented on a 64 ×64 element bias-sensitive electrostrictive relaxor TOBE array. The FORCES imaging scheme involves transmitting along rows to form an elevational transmit focus, while biasing columns with bias patterns selected from a Hadamard matrix. Channel data from columns is received and decoded for synthetic aperture beamforming in azimuth. This scheme offers two-way azimuthal focusing. Volumetric imaging experiments were conducted using wire phantoms as well as on rat hearts using two different TOBE imaging schemes: Scheme 1 (transmit focusing in elevation and receive focusing in azimuth) and FORCES. Wire phantom experiments at a depth of 2 cm showed an azimuthal resolution of 0.42 mm and 0.31 mm with Scheme 1 and FORCES, respectively. We also compared the elevational imaging performance of these imaging schemes with a mechanically scanned linear array. The FORCES imaging displayed an elevational resolution of 0.46 mm at a depth of 2 cm and the linear array an elevational resolution of 0.72 cm. The novel TOBE array architecture and FORCES imaging scheme thus enable high-quality 3D ultrasound imaging using only row-column addressing and bias control, and may prove an enabling technology for many future 3D imaging platforms.",Short-lag Spatial Coherence Imaging in 1.5-D and 1.75-D Arrays: Elevation Performance and Array Design Considerations.,https://www.ncbi.nlm.nih.gov/pubmed/30908212,"IEEE transactions on ultrasonics, ferroelectrics, and frequency control",2019 06 14,"Short-lag spatial coherence (SLSC) imaging has demonstrated improved performance over conventional B-Mode ultrasound imaging. Previous work has evaluated the performance of SLSC using 2-D matrix arrays in simulation and in vivo studies across various levels of subaperture beamforming, demonstrating improved contrast-to-noise ratio (CNR) and speckle signal-to-noise ratio (SNR) over 1-D arrays. This work explores the application of SLSC imaging in 1.5-D and 1.75-D arrays to quantify the impacts of elevation element count, mirroring, and Fresnel element spacing on SLSC image quality. Through simulation and in vivo studies, increased elevation element count was shown to improve CNR and speckle SNR relative to 1-D SLSC and B-Mode images. Elevation mirroring (1.5-D) was shown to force the inclusion of long lags into the SLSC calculation, introducing additional decorrelation and reducing image quality relative to 1.75-D arrays with individually-connected elements. These results demonstrate the effectiveness of SLSC imaging in 1.5-D and 1.75-D arrays.",Fast Acoustic Wave Sparsely Activated Localization Microscopy (fast-AWSALM): Ultrasound Super-Resolution using Plane-Wave Activation of Nanodroplets.,https://www.ncbi.nlm.nih.gov/pubmed/30908211,"IEEE transactions on ultrasonics, ferroelectrics, and frequency control",2019 05 31,"Localization-based ultrasound super-resolution imaging using microbubble contrast agents and phase-change nano-droplets has been developed to visualize microvascular structures beyond the diffraction limit. However, the long data acquisition time makes the clinical translation more challenging. In this study, fast acoustic wave sparsely activated localization microscopy (fast-AWSALM) was developed to achieve super-resolved frames with sub-second temporal resolution, by using low-boiling-point octafluoropropane nanodroplets and high frame rate plane waves for activation, destruction, as well as imaging. Fast-AWSALM was demonstrated on an in vitro microvascular phantom to super-resolve structures that could not be resolved by conventional B-mode imaging. The effects of the temperature and mechanical index on fast-AWSALM was investigated. Experimental results show that sub-wavelength micro-structures as small as 190 lm were resolvable in 200 ms with plane-wave transmission at a center frequency of 3.5 MHz and a pulse repetition frequency of 5000 Hz. This is about a 3.5 fold reduction in point spread function full-width-half-maximum compared to that measured in conventional B-mode, and two orders of magnitude faster than the recently reported AWSALM under a non-flow/very slow flow situations and other localization based methods. Just as in AWSALM, fast-AWSALM does not require flow, as is required by current microbubble based ultrasound super resolution techniques. In conclusion, this study shows the promise of fast-AWSALM, a super-resolution ultrasound technique using nanodroplets, which can generate super-resolution images in milli-seconds and does not require flow."

Electrophysiological models have been found effective in regularizing these inverse problems by incorporating a priori knowledge about how the electrical potential in the heart propagates over time. However, these models suffer from model errors arising from, for example, parameters associated with tissue properties and the earliest sites of excitation. We present a Bayesian approach to simultaneously estimate transmembrane potential (TMP) signals and prior model errors, exploiting sparsity of the error in the gradient domain in the form of a novel sparse prior based on variational lower bound of the generalized Gaussian distribution. In synthetic and real-data experiments, we demonstrate the improvement of accuracy in TMP reconstruction brought by simultaneous model error estimation. We further provide theoretical and empirical justifications for the change of performances in the presented method at the presence of different model errors.",Shape Optimization of an Electric Dipole Array for 7 Tesla Neuroimaging.,https://www.ncbi.nlm.nih.gov/pubmed/30908199,IEEE transactions on medical imaging,2019 03 25,"Radio-frequency (RF) arrays constructed using electric dipoles have potential benefits for transmit and receive applications using ultra-high field (UHF) MRI. This study examines some of the implementation barriers regarding dipole RF arrays for human head imaging at 7 T. The dipole array was constructed with conformal, meandered dipoles with dimensions selected utilizing an evolutionary-based optimization routine to shape-optimize the dipole structure. Coupling matrix synthesis (CMS) was utilized to decouple the dipole array. Mean and worst-case transmission between nearest-neighbour dipoles was -17.2 and - 15.5 dB, respectively (± 2.4 dB). Transmit efficiencies of 24.6 nT/V for the entire brain and 26.0 nT/V across the axial slice were observed. The total and peak 10-g SAR, normalized to 1 Watt accepted input power per channel, was 0.163 W/kg and 0.601 W/kg, respectively. Maximum and mean noise correlations were -17 dB and -32 dB, respectively. The use of both CMS and a novel shape optimization routine to design a dipole array translated into sufficient transmit uniformity with a simultaneous reduction in 10-g SAR in comparison to a non-optimized dipole array of the same geometry. As a receiver, the dipole array maintained high orthogonality between elements, resulting in strong parallel imaging performance..",Correlation-weighted sparse representation for robust liver DCE-MRI decomposition registration.,https://www.ncbi.nlm.nih.gov/pubmed/30908198,IEEE transactions on medical imaging,2019 03 25,"Conducting an accurate motion correction of liver dynamic contrast-enhanced magnetic resonance (DCE-MR) imaging remains challenging because of intensity variations caused by contrast agents. Such variations lead to the failure of the traditional intensity-based registration method. To address this problem, we propose a correlation-weighted sparse representation framework to separate the contrast agent from original liver DCE-MR images. This framework allows the robust registration of motion components over time without intensity variances. Existing sparse coding techniques recover a 3D image containing only contrast agents (named contrast enhancement component) from a manually labeled dictionary, whose column has the same size with the original 3D volume (3D-t mode). The high dimension of the recovery target (3D volume) and the indistinguishability between the unenhanced and enhanced images make accurate coding difficult. In this paper, we pre-define an ideal time-intensity curve containing only contrast agents (named contrast agent curve) and recover it from the transpose dictionary (t-3D mode), whose column has been updated into the original time-intensity curves. The low dimension of the target (1D curve) and the significant intergroup difference between contrast agent curves and non-contrast agent curves can estimate a series of pure contrast agent curves. A ""correlation-weighted"" constraint is introduced for the selection of a coding subset with more contrast agent curves, leading to an efficient and accurate sparse recovery process. Then, the contrast enhancement component can be estimated by the solved sparse coefficients map and the ideal curve and subtracted from the original DCE-MRI. Finally, we register the de-enhanced images and apply the obtained deformation fields for the original DCE-MRI to achieve the goal of motion correction. We conduct experiments on both simulated and real liver DCE-MRI data. Compared with other state-of-theart DCE-MRI registration methods, experimental results show that our method achieves a better registration performance with less computational efficiency.",A novel weakly supervised Multitask Architecture for Retinal Lesions Segmentation on Fundus Images.,https://www.ncbi.nlm.nih.gov/pubmed/30908197,IEEE transactions on medical imaging,2019 03 25,"Obtaining the complete segmentation map of retinal lesions is the first step towards an automated diagnosis tool for retinopathy that is interpretable in its decision-making. However, the limited availability of ground truth lesion detection maps at a pixel level restricts the ability of deep segmentation neural networks to generalize over large databases. In this paper, we propose a novel approach for training a convolutional multi-task architecture with supervised learning and reinforcing it with weakly supervised learning. The architecture is simultaneously trained for three tasks: segmentation of red lesions and of bright lesions, those two tasks done concurrently with lesion detection. In addition, we propose and discuss the advantages of a new preprocessing method that guarantees the color consistency between the raw image and its enhanced version. Our complete system produces segmentations of both red and bright lesions. The method is validated at the pixel level and per-image using four databases and a cross-validation strategy. When evaluated on the task of screening for the presence or absence of lesions on the Messidor image set, the proposed method achieves an area under the ROC curve of 0.839, comparable to the state of the art.",TETRIS: Template Transformer Networks for Image Segmentation with Shape Priors.,https://www.ncbi.nlm.nih.gov/pubmed/30908196,IEEE transactions on medical imaging,2019 05 06,"In this paper we introduce and compare different approaches for incorporating shape prior information into neural network based image segmentation. Specifically, we introduce the concept of template transformer networks where a shape template is deformed to match the underlying structure of interest through an end-to-end trained spatial transformer network. This has the advantage of explicitly enforcing shape priors and is free of discretisation artefacts by providing a soft partial volume segmentation. We also introduce a simple yet effective way of incorporating priors in state-of-the-art pixel-wise binary classification methods such as fully convolutional networks and U-net. Here, the template shape is given as an additional input channel, incorporating this information significantly reduces false positives. We report results on synthetic data and sub-voxel segmentation of coronary lumen structures in cardiac computed tomography showing the benefit of incorporating priors in neural network based image segmentation.",Automatic Spatial Calibration of Ultra-Low-Field MRI for High-Accuracy Hybrid MEG-MRI.,https://www.ncbi.nlm.nih.gov/pubmed/30908195,IEEE transactions on medical imaging,2019 06 06,"With a hybrid magnetoencephalography (MEG)-MRI device that uses the same sensors for both modalities, the co-registration of MRI and MEG data can be replaced by an automatic calibration step. Based on the highly accurate signal model of ultra-low-field (ULF) MRI, we introduce a calibration method that eliminates the error sources of traditional co-registration. The signal model includes complex sensitivity profiles of the superconducting pickup coils. In the ULF MRI, the profiles are independent of the sample and therefore well-defined. In the most basic form, the spatial information of the profiles, captured in parallel ULF-MR acquisitions, is used to find the exact coordinate transformation required. We assessed our calibration method by simulations assuming a helmet-shaped pickup-coil-array geometry. Using a carefully constructed objective function and sufficient approximations, even with low-SNR images, sub-voxel and sub-millimeter calibration accuracy were achieved. After the calibration, distortion-free MRI and high spatial accuracy for MEG source localization can be achieved. For an accurate sensor-array geometry, the co-registration and associated errors are eliminated, and the positional error can be reduced to a negligible level.",Standardized Assessment of Automatic Segmentation of White Matter Hyperintensities; Results of the WMH Segmentation Challenge.,https://www.ncbi.nlm.nih.gov/pubmed/30908194,IEEE transactions on medical imaging,2019 03 25,"Quantification of cerebral white matter hyperintensities (WMH) of presumed vascular origin is of key importance in many neurological research studies. Currently, measurements are often still obtained from manual segmentations on brain MR images, which is a laborious procedure. Automatic WMH segmentation methods exist, but a standardized comparison of the performance of such methods is lacking. We organized a scientific challenge, in which developers could evaluate their method on a standardized multi-center/-scanner image dataset, giving an objective comparison: the WMH Segmentation Challenge (https://wmh.isi.uu.nl/). Sixty T1+FLAIR images from three MR scanners were released with manual WMH segmentations for training. A test set of 110 images from five MR scanners was used for evaluation. Segmentation methods had to be containerized and submitted to the challenge organizers. Five evaluation metrics were used to rank the methods: (1) Dice similarity coefficient, (2) modified Hausdorff distance (95th percentile), (3) absolute log-transformed volume difference, (4) sensitivity for detecting individual lesions, and (5) F1-score for individual lesions. Additionally, methods were ranked on their inter-scanner robustness. Twenty participants submitted their method for evaluation. This paper provides a detailed analysis of the results. In brief, there is a cluster of four methods that rank significantly better than the other methods, with one clear winner. The inter-scanner robustness ranking shows that not all methods generalize to unseen scanners. The challenge remains open for future submissions and provides a public platform for method evaluation.",Learning to Index for Nearest Neighbor Search.,https://www.ncbi.nlm.nih.gov/pubmed/30908193,IEEE transactions on pattern analysis and machine intelligence,2019 03 25,"In this study, we present a novel ranking model based on learning neighborhood relationships embedded in the index space. Given a query point, conventional approximate nearest neighbor search calculates the distances to the cluster centroids, before ranking the clusters from near to far based on the distances. The data indexed in the top-ranked clusters are retrieved and treated as the nearest neighbor candidates for the query. However, the loss of quantization between the data and cluster centroids will inevitably harm the search accuracy. To address this problem, the proposed model ranks clusters based on their nearest neighbor probabilities rather than the query-centroid distances. The nearest neighbor probabilities are estimated by employing neural networks to characterize the neighborhood relationships, i.e., the density function of nearest neighbors with respect to the query. The proposed probability-based ranking can replace the conventional distance-based ranking for finding candidate clusters, and the predicted probability can be used to determine the data quantity to be retrieved from the candidate cluster. Our experimental results demonstrated that the proposed ranking model could boost the search performance effectively in billion-scale datasets.",Social Anchor-Unit Graph Regularized Tensor Completion for Large-Scale Image Retagging.,https://www.ncbi.nlm.nih.gov/pubmed/30908192,IEEE transactions on pattern analysis and machine intelligence,2019 03 25,"Image retagging aims to improve the tag quality of social images by completing the missing tags, recrifying the noise-corrupted tags, and assigning new high-quality tags. Recent approaches simultaneously explore visual, user and tag information to improve the performance of image retagging by mining the tag-image-user associations. However, such methods will become computationally infeasible with the rapidly increasing number of images, tags and users. It has been proven that the anchor graph can significantly accelerate large-scale graph-based learning by exploring only a small number of anchor points. Inspired by this, we propose a novel Social anchor-Unit GrAph Regularized Tensor Completion (SUGAR-TC) method to efficiently refine the tags of social images, which is insensitive to the scale of data. First, we construct an anchor-unit graph across multiple domains (e.g., image and user domains) rather than traditional anchor graph in a single domain. Second, a tensor completion based on Social anchor-Unit GrAph Regularization (SUGAR) is implemented to refine the tags of the anchor images. Finally, we efficiently assign tags to non-anchor images by leveraging the relationship between the non-anchor units and the anchor units. Experimental results on a real-world social image database well demonstrate the effectiveness and efficiency of SUGAR-TC, outperforming the state-of-the-arts methods.",Back To The Future: Radial Basis Function Network Revisited.,https://www.ncbi.nlm.nih.gov/pubmed/30908191,IEEE transactions on pattern analysis and machine intelligence,2019 04 01,"Radial Basis Function (RBF) networks are a classical family of algorithms for supervised learning. The most popular approach for training RBF networks has relied on kernel methods using regularization based on a norm in a Reproducing Kernel Hilbert Space (RKHS), which is a principled and empirically successful framework. In this paper we aim to revisit some of the older approaches to training the RBF networks from a more modern perspective. Specifically, we analyze two common regularization procedures, one based on the square norm of the coefficients in the network and another one using centers obtained by k-means clustering. We show that both of these RBF methods can be recast as certain data-dependent kernels. We provide a theoretical analysis of these methods as well as a number of experimental results, pointing out very competitive experimental performance as well as certain advantages over the standard kernel methods in terms of both flexibility (incorporating of unlabeled data) and computational complexity. Finally, our results shed light on some impressive recent successes of using soft k-means features for image recognition and other tasks."

The epidemiologic trend of cancers in LMICs is of particular concern. Despite a lower incidence of cancer in LMICs compared with high-income countries, total cancer-related mortality is significantly higher in LMICs, especially in people younger than 65 years of age. The enormous economic impact of premature mortality and lost productive life years highlights the critical importance of galvanizing cancer prevention and management to achieve sustainable development. The rising burden of cancer in LMICs stresses an already weak health care and economic infrastructure and poses unique challenges. Although the WHO acknowledges that the effective management of cancer relies on early detection, accurate diagnosis, and access to appropriate multimodal therapy, the placement of priority on early detection cannot be assumed to be effective in LMICs, where limited downstream resources may be overwhelmed by the inevitable increases in number of diagnoses. This review discusses several factors and considerations that may compromise the success of cancer control programs in LMICs, particularly if the focus is only on early detection through screening and surveillance. It is intended to guide optimal implementation of cancer control programs by accentuating challenges common in LMICs and by emphasizing the importance of cancer prevention where relevant so that communities and stakeholders can work together to devise optimal means of combatting the growing burden of cancer.","Challenges, Opportunities, and Priorities for Advancing Breast Cancer Control in Zambia: A Consultative Meeting on Breast Cancer Control.",https://www.ncbi.nlm.nih.gov/pubmed/30908146,Journal of global oncology,2019 04 10,"In 2016, the Zambian government made cancer control a national priority and released a National Cancer Control Strategic Plan for 2016 to 2021, which focuses on malignancies of the breast, cervix, and prostate, and retinoblastoma. The plan calls for a collective reduction in the cancer burden by 50%. In support of this vision, Susan G. Komen sponsored a consultative meeting in Lusaka, Zambia, in September 2017 to bring together the country's main breast cancer stakeholders and identify opportunities to improve breast cancer control. The recommendations generated during the discussions are presented. There was general agreement that the first step toward breast cancer mortality reduction should consist of implementation of early detection service platforms focused on women who are symptomatic. Participants also agreed that the management of all components of the national breast cancer control program should be integrated and led by the Ministry of Health. As much as possible, early detection and treatment services presently offered by the Cervical Cancer Prevention Program of Zambia and Cancer Diseases Hospital should be leveraged. Efforts are under way through multiple stakeholders to implement the following recommendations: development of national guidelines for the early diagnosis of breast cancer, training of breast surgeons, implementation of early detection and surgical treatment service platforms at the district-hospital level, and epidemiologic research, including the improvement of electronic recording mechanisms.",Establishing Cohorts to Generate the Evidence Base to Reduce the Burden of Breast Cancer in Sub-Saharan Africa: Results From a Feasibility Study in Kenya.,https://www.ncbi.nlm.nih.gov/pubmed/30908145,Journal of global oncology,2019 04 10,"By 2025, Kenya is estimated to experience a two-thirds increase in the incidence of breast cancer.

As phytoplasmas can be spread by vegetative propagation and latency periods of Rubus stunt can be up to one year, the use of pathogen-free Rubus propagation material in plant nurseries is important in order to stop the spread of this disease. Even though heat therapy has been commonly applied against viruses in many plants, its potential for phytoplasma eradication has been much less explored. Here, the efficacy of heat therapy with subsequent tissue culture to eliminate phytoplasmas from infected raspberry and blackberry plants is evaluated. Heat therapy was performed on 25 phytoplasma-infected raspberry and 33 infected blackberry plants, out of which 100 raspberry and 65 blackberry plants were regenerated via subsequent tissue culture. All plants were negative for the presence of phytoplasma DNA by qPCR at the end of cultivation periods of 481 to 565 days for the treated raspberry plants and 231 to 337 days for the treated blackberry plants. These results show the suitability of heat therapy combined with tissue culture as a routine tool to ensure the presence of phytoplasma-free Rubus mother plants in nurseries.",Use of Systemic Acquired Resistance and Whitefly Optical Barriers to Reduce Tomato Yellow Leaf Curl Disease Damage to Tomato Crops.,https://www.ncbi.nlm.nih.gov/pubmed/30908127,Plant disease,2019 06 06,"Epidemics of tomato yellow leaf curl disease (TYLCD) caused by tomato yellow leaf curl-like begomoviruses (genus Begomovirus, family Geminiviridae) severely damage open field and protected tomato crops worldwide. Intensive application of insecticides against the whitefly vector Bemisia tabaci is generally used as control strategy to reduce TYLCD impact. This practice, however, is frequently ineffective and has a negative impact on the environment and human health. TYLCD-resistant varieties are commercially available, but cultivation of susceptible traditional tasting ones is also requested if possible. For susceptible tomatoes, here we show that using whitefly optical barriers by means of UV-blocking plastics in protected crops can contribute to reducing TYLCD damage and increasing commercial fruit yield. Moreover, induction of systemic acquired resistance by application of the elicitor of plant defense acibenzolar-S-methyl was effective to reduce yield losses when viral pressure was moderate. Interestingly, combining both practices in protected tomato crops can result in a significant TYLCD control. Therefore, these control practices are proposed to be used commercially as management alternatives to include in integrated management of TYLCD.",Compatible Mixture of Bacterial Antagonists Developed to Protect Potato Tubers from Soft Rot Caused by Pectobacterium spp. and Dickeya spp.,https://www.ncbi.nlm.nih.gov/pubmed/30908126,Plant disease,2019 06 06,"Possibilities to protect potato tubers from rotting caused by Soft Rot Pectobacteriaceae (SRP) under disease favoring conditions were investigated using compatible mixtures of bacterial antagonists and tested with a newly developed stepwise efficacy-based screening protocol. Twenty-two bacterial antagonists were evaluated against a combination of five Pectobacterium and Dickeya strains representing species and subspecies most often associated with potato soft rot in Europe. To enable potential synergistic activity, the antagonists were initially tested against the combination of pathogens in 15 random mixtures containing up to 5 antagonists each. Three mixtures (M2, M4, and M14) out of 15 tested reduced tuber tissue maceration due to soft rot. The individual antagonists derived from M2, M4, and M14 mixtures were tested on potato slices and whole tuber injection assays. These five strains (S. plymuthica strain A294, E. amnigenus strain A167, R. aquatilis strain H145, S. rubidaea strain H440, and S. rubidaea strain H469) were combined to develop a tailored biological control mixture against potato soft rot. The new mixture, designated the Great Five (GF), was tested on seed potato tubers vacuum infiltrated with antagonists and subsequently with the combination of five SRP pathogens. In these experiments, the GF mixture provided stable protection of inoculated potato tubers, reducing soft rot by 46% (P = 0.0016) under high disease pressure conditions. The A294, A167, H145, H440, and H469 antagonists were characterized for features important for viable commercial applications including growth at different temperatures, resistance to antibiotics, and potential toxicity toward Caenorhabditis elegans. The implications for control of soft rot caused by SRP with the use of the GF mixture of antagonists are discussed.",Point Inoculation Method for Measuring Adult Plant Response of Wheat to Stripe Rust Infection.,https://www.ncbi.nlm.nih.gov/pubmed/30908125,Plant disease,2019 06 06,"Depending on the pathogenicity of the stripe rust fungus Puccinia striiformis f. sp. tritici, the nature of resistance in the wheat host plant, and the environment, a broad range of disease phenotypes can be expressed. Therefore, the phenotyping of partial adult plant stripe rust resistance requires reliable and repeatable procedures, especially under controlled conditions. In this study, the development of a flag leaf point inoculation method, which resulted in a 100% initial infection rate, is reported. Flag leaf inoculations were achieved by placing 6-mm antibiotic test paper discs, dipped into a urediniospore and water suspension and covered with water-proof plastic tape, on the adaxial side of leaves. Results from independent trials allowed for the statistical comparison of stripe rust lesion expansion rate in wheat entries that differ in resistance. The technique is inexpensive, reliable, and applicable to routine screening for adult plant response type, quantitative comparison of stripe rust progress, environmental influences, and pathogenicity of different isolates.","Prediction of peak

The current study was undertaken to expand the empirical evidence base for the triarchic model by examining its correlates in adolescents, with measures of particular relevance to developmental theories of antisocial behavior. Self-report scales assessing the triarchic constructs were administered along with measures of conduct problems, callous-unemotional traits, attachment style dimensions, negative emotionality, and hyperactivity/inattention to 608 Italian adolescents (272 girls; M age = 16.70 years). The disinhibition dimension of the triarchic model was related most highly to general externalizing outcomes, such as conduct problems and hyperactivity-inattention, in this adolescent sample. The meanness dimension was selectively related to callous-unemotional traits and other measures of limited prosocial emotions and to affiliation motives that emphasize social gain. Triarchic boldness was associated with greater emotional stability and greater confidence in peer relationships. Of interest, an interaction between meanness and boldness was evident in predicting a lower need to understand one's own and others' emotions. These results provide a valuable illustration of the potential of the triarchic model to help advance developmental models of antisocial behavior in youth. Public Significance Statement This study examined how dimensions of psychopathy described by the triarchic model relate to measures of problem behaviors and affective-interpersonal style in an adolescent sample. Scores on the three triarchic dimensions-disinhibition, meanness, and boldness-showed meaningful contrasting relations with conduct problems, hyperactivity/inattention, callous-unemotional traits, emotional proclivities, and attachment style dimensions. This work illustrates how the triarchic model conceptualization can help advance developmental models of the emergence of antisocial behavior.",An update on the Lutheran blood group system.,https://www.ncbi.nlm.nih.gov/pubmed/30908076,Immunohematology,2019 04 23,"This update of the Lutheran (LU) blood group system (Daniels G.

To ensure proper identification, multiple investigative tools may be used. We review one of these methods-inhibition by soluble substances-which has become an expansion of our toolbox within the past 10 years. Alloantibodies can be inhibited using specific soluble substances. These soluble substances occur naturally in various fluids or can be manufactured.

As a feedback of mechanical stimuli, local surface tension can be readily changed and immediately propagated through the membrane, influencing structures and dynamics of both inclusions and membrane-associated proteins. Using the nonequilibrium coarse-grained membrane simulation, here we investigate the inter-related processes of tension propagation, lipid diffusion, and transport of nanoparticles (NPs) adhering on the membrane of constant tension gradient, mimicking that of migrating cells or cells under prolonged stimulation. Our results demonstrate that the lipid bilayer membrane can by itself propagate surface tension in defined rates and pathways to reach a dynamic equilibrium state where surface tension is linearly distributed along the gradient maintained by the directional flow-like motion of lipids. Such lipid flow exerts shearing forces to transport adhesive NPs toward the region of a larger surface tension. Under certain conditions, the shearing force can generate nonzero torques driving the rotational motion of NPs, with the direction of the NP rotation determined by the NP-membrane interaction state as functions of both NP property and local membrane surface tension. Such features endow NPs with promising applications ranging from biosensing to targeted drug delivery.","Organocatalytic, Enantioselective, Polarity-Matched Ring-Reorganization Domino Sequence Based on the 3-Oxindole Scaffold.",https://www.ncbi.nlm.nih.gov/pubmed/30908056,Organic letters,2019 06 05,"A one-pot squaramide-catalyzed enantioselective ring-reorganization domino sequence (Michael addition/intramolecular ring-opening/lactamization) of 3-hydroxyoxindole and methyleneindolinone, which can be readily derived from 3-oxindole, has been established in this work.

The localization of antigen proteins, i.e., whether they lie on the outer surface or inner surface of exosomes, might affect antigen presentation after exosomes are taken up by antigen-presenting cells; however, little is known about the importance of this phenomenon. In this study, lactadherin (LA) and group-specific antigen (Gag), exosome-tropic proteins that had previously been shown to cause the localization of luciferase to the outer surface and inner surface of exosomes, respectively [ Takahashi , Y. ; J. Biotechnol. 2013 ; Charoenviriyakul , C. ; Mol. Pharm. 2018 ], were used to examine the importance of the localization of antigen proteins in antigen presentation. Human embryonic kidney cells 293 (HEK293) were selected as exosomes producing cells. First, green fluorescent protein (GFP) was used to trace intracellular behavior of antigen proteins after uptake by murine dendritic DC2.4 cells. GFP-derived fluorescence signals were detected in cells only when GFP-inner-loaded (Gag-GFP) exosomes were added to them. Then, ovalbumin (OVA) was used as a model antigen protein, and OVA-loaded exosomes were added to bone marrow-derived dendritic cells. OVA-inner-loaded (Gag-OVA) exosomes showed enhanced class I antigen presentation capacity as compared with OVA-outer-loaded (OVA-LA) exosomes. Using PKH-labeled exosomes, it was found that the localization of OVA had very little effect on the cellular uptake of exosomes. These results indicate that the loading of antigen proteins inside exosomes helps in efficient antigen presentation.","Asymmetric Synthesis 1-Substituted 2,6-Diazaspiro[3.3]heptanes through Addition of 3-Azetidinecarboxylate Anions to Davis-Ellman Imines.",https://www.ncbi.nlm.nih.gov/pubmed/30908052,Organic letters,2019 06 13,"Asymmetric synthesis of 1-substituted 2,6-diazaspiro[3.3]heptane is described.

We have used vibrational sum frequency generation spectroscopy to determine the orientation of poly-3-hexylthiophene (P3HT) at the planar buried interface with fullerene (C60). The thiophene rings of P3HT have been found to tilt significantly toward C60, making an average angle θ ≈ 49° ± 10° between the plane of the ring and the interface. Such tilt may be attributed to π-π stacking interactions between P3HT and C60 and may facilitate efficient charge transfer between donor and acceptor. Upon annealing, the thiophene rings tilt away from the interface by Δθ = 12-19°. This may be attributed to higher crystallinity of annealed P3HT that propagates all the way to the interface, resulting in more ""edge-on"" orientation, which is consistent with the observed red-shift by ∼6 cm-1 and spectral narrowing of the C=C stretch bands.",A Mixed Quantum/Classical Approach to Associative Detachment in Low-Energy H- + H Collisions.,https://www.ncbi.nlm.nih.gov/pubmed/30908050,The journal of physical chemistry.

Chitosan aerogel, one of the emerging biopolymer aerogels, was prepared by chemical cross-linking gelation, followed by solvent exchange with methanol and supercritical drying using CO2. Small-angle X-ray scattering analysis shows that the structure of the wet gel, which consists of Gaussian chains of individual molecular strands, converts into a nanofibrous network during CO2 processing. In situ observation reveals a drastic shrinkage of the gel in CO2, demonstrating that physical coagulation caused by the low affinity between chitosan and CO2 is the main structure-forming step. These results challenge the common perception of supercritical drying: it is no longer an inactive drying method, but rather an active nanostructure forming a tool to produce porous biopolymer materials with tailored structure and properties.",Parallel Implementation of a Sequential Markov Chain in Monte Carlo Simulations of Physical Systems with Pairwise Interactions.,https://www.ncbi.nlm.nih.gov/pubmed/30908037,Journal of chemical theory and computation,2019 05 15,"In molecular simulations performed by Markov Chain Monte Carlo (typically employing the Metropolis criterion), each state of a system is obtained by a small random modification of the previous state. Therefore, the process consists of an immense number of small, quick to calculate steps, which are inherently sequential and hence considered to be very hard to parallelise. Here, we present a novel protocol for efficient calculation of multiple sequential steps in parallel. To this end, we first precompute in parallel energy components of all states achievable in a sequence of steps. Then we select a single path through all achievable states, which is identical with the path obtained with the sequential algorithm. As an example, we carried out simulations of the TIP5P water model with the new protocol and compared results with those obtained using the standard Metropolis Monte Carlo scheme. The implementation on the Titan X (Pascal) graphic processor (GPU) architectures allows for a 30-fold speedup in comparison with a simulation on a single core of a multicore CPU. The protocol is general and not limited to the GPU; it can also be used on multicore CPU when the longest possible length of the single simulation is required.",Undiscovered Mechanism for Pyrogenic Carbonaceous Matter-Mediated Abiotic Transformation of Azo Dyes by Sulfide.,https://www.ncbi.nlm.nih.gov/pubmed/30908036,Environmental science & technology,2019 04 16,"Pyrogenic carbonaceous matter (PCM) catalyzes the transformation of a range of organic pollutants by sulfide in water; however, the mediation mechanisms are not fully understood. In this study, we observed for the first time that the degradation of azo dyes by sulfide initially underwent a lag phase followed by a fast degradation phase. Interestingly, the presence of PCM only reduced the lag phase length of the azo dye decolorization but did not significantly enhance the reaction rate in the fast degradation phase. An analysis of the azo dye reduction and polysulfide formation indicated that PCM facilitated the transformation of sulfide into polysulfides, including disulfide and trisulfide, resulting in fast azo dye reduction. Moreover, the oxygen functional groups of the PCM, especially the quinones, may play an important role in the transformation of sulfide into polysulfides by accelerating the electron transfer. The results of this study provide a better understanding of the PCM-mediated abiotic transformation of organic pollutants by sulfide in anaerobic aqueous environments.",High-Frequency and -Field EPR (HFEPR) Investigation of a Pseudotetrahedral CrIV Siloxide Complex and Computational Studies of Related CrIVL4 Systems.,https://www.ncbi.nlm.nih.gov/pubmed/30908035,Inorganic chemistry,2019 04 24,"Chromium species are the active sites in a variety of heterogeneous catalysts, such as the Phillips catalyst, which is composed of Cr ions supported by SiO2 and is used to produce polyethylene. Among the catalytically relevant oxidation states of chromium is CrIV. Families of neutral, homoleptic, four-coordinate complexes, CrL4, with a variety of monoanionic, monodentate ligands, such as L = alkyls, aryls, amides, ketimides (R2C = N-), alkoxides, and siloxides, are available and can provide information regarding Cr sites in heterogeneous materials. For example, the previously reported siloxide, Cr(DTBMS)4, where DTBMS = -OSiMe tBu2 (di- tert-butylmethylsiloxide), may be considered a molecular analogue of CrIV supported by SiO2. Such CrL4 complexes can have either a singlet ( S = 0) or triplet ( S = 1) spin ground state, and the spin state preferences of such complexes are not fully understood. A truly tetrahedral d2 S = 1 complex would exhibit no zero-field splitting (zfs), and the zfs is indeed small and observable by X-band EPR for several CrR4 and Cr(OR)4 complexes. In contrast, Cr(DTBMS)4 has zfs beyond the range amenable to X-band EPR so that high-frequency and high-field EPR (HFEPR) is appropriate. HFEPR of Cr(DTBMS)4 in the solid state shows the presence of three very similar triplet species with the major component having D = +0.556 cm-1. Classical ligand-field theory (LFT) and quantum chemical theory (QCT), including ab initio methods, use EPR and electronic absorption spectra to give a complete picture of the electronic structure of Cr(DTBMS)4, and other complexes of formula Cr(ER n)4, E = C, n = 3; E = N, n = 2; E = O, n = 1; E = F, n = 0. Computations show the importance of ligand steric bulk and of π-bonding in controlling the subtleties of electronic structure of CrL4 species.

Incorporation of hydrogen bonding groups on a sensor's receptor unit to target saccharides is an obvious strategy but not one that is likely to ensure analyte-receptor interactions over analyte-solvent or receptor-solvent interactions. Phenylboronic acids are known to reversibly and covalently bind saccharides (diols in general) with highly selective affinity in aqueous solution. Therefore, recent work has sought to design such sensors and understand their mechanism for allowing fluorescence with bound saccharides. In past work, binding orientations of several saccharides were determined to dimethylaminomethylphenylboronic acid (DMPBA) receptors with an anthracene fluorophore; however, the binding orientation of d-fructose to such a sensor could not be determined. In this work, we investigate the potential binding modes by generating 20 possible bidentate and six possible tridentate modes between fructose and DMPBA, a simplified receptor model. Gas phase and implicit solvent geometry optimizations, with a myriad functional/basis set pairs, were carried out to identify the lowest energy bidentate and tridentate binding modes of d-fructose to DMPBA. An interesting hydrogen transfer was observed during selected bidentate gas phase optimizations; this transfer suggests a strong sharing of the hydrogen atom between the boronate hydroxyl and amine nitrogen.",Pathogenic Bacteria Detection Using RNA-Based Loop-Mediated Isothermal-Amplification-Assisted Nucleic Acid Amplification via Droplet Microfluidics.,https://www.ncbi.nlm.nih.gov/pubmed/30908029,ACS sensors,2019 04 26,"Nucleic acid amplifications, such as polymerase chain reaction (PCR), are very beneficial for diagnostic applications, especially in the context of bacterial or viral outbreaks due to their high specificity and sensitivity. However, the need for bulky instrumentation and complicated protocols makes these methods expensive and slow, particularly for low numbers of RNA or DNA templates. In addition, implementing conventional nucleic acid amplification in a high-throughput manner is both reagent- and time-consuming. We bring droplet-based microfluidics and loop-mediated isothermal amplification (LAMP) together in an optimized operational condition to provide a sensitive biosensor for amplifying extracted RNA templates for the detection of Salmonella typhimurium (targeting the invA gene). By simultaneously performing ∼106 LAMP-assisted amplification reactions in picoliter-sized droplets and applying a new mathematical model for the number of droplets necessary to screen for the first positive droplet, we study the detection limit of our platform with pure culture and real samples (bacterial contaminated milk samples). Our LAMP-assisted droplet-based microfluidic technique was simple in operation, sensitive, specific, and rapid for the detection of pathogenic bacteria Salmonella typhimurium in comparison with well-established conventional methods.

In this work, we propose a new searching algorithm, RISC, which exploits sparsity in high-dimensional fingerprints to derive effective pruning mechanisms and dramatically speed-up searching efficiency. RISC is robust enough to work on both binary and nonbinary chemical fingerprints. Extensive experiments on Range Queries and Top-k Queries across several molecular repositories demonstrate that at fingerprints of dimension 2048 and above, which is often the case with unfolded fingerprints, RISC is consistently faster than the state-of-the-art techniques.

Natural polysaccharide is one of the good candidates of these hydrogels. However, weak mechanical properties of cellulose hydrogels greatly limit their practical application. Here, chemically dual-cross-linked cellulose hydrogels (DCHs) were constructed by sequential reaction of cellulose with low- and high-molecular-weight cross-linkers to obtain relatively short chains and long chains cross-linked networks. Both the distribution and density of the cross-linking domains in the hydrogel networks were monitored by three-dimensional Raman microscopic imaging technique. Interestingly, the ruptured stress of DCHs in tensile and compressive tests were 1.7 and 9.4 MPa, which were 26.3- and 83.9-fold larger than those of chemically single-cross-linked cellulose hydrogel. The reinforcement mechanism of DCH was proposed, as the breaking of the short-chain cross-linking in the networks effectively dissipated mechanical energy, and the extensibility of the relatively long-chain cross-linking maintained the elasticity of DCH. Therefore, both the strength and toughness of DCH was enhanced, and the dual networks consisting of short-chain and long-chain cross-linking played an important role in the improvement of the mechanical properties of the cellulose hydrogels. The application prospect of the robust cellulose hydrogels with bimodal network structure would be greatly broadened in the sustainable biopolymer fields.",In the Search for Nanospecific Effects of Dissolution of Metallic Nanoparticles at Freshwater-Like Conditions: A Critical Review.,https://www.ncbi.nlm.nih.gov/pubmed/30908015,Environmental science & technology,2019 04 16,"Knowledge on relations between particle properties and dissolution/transformation characteristics of metal and metal oxide nanoparticles (NPs) in freshwater is important for risk assessment and product development. This critical review aims to elucidate nanospecific effects on dissolution of metallic NPs in freshwater and similar media. Dissolution rate constants are compiled and analyzed for NPs of silver (Ag), copper (Cu), copper oxide/hydroxide (CuO, Cu(OH)2), zinc oxide (ZnO), manganese (Mn), and aluminum (Al), showing largely varying (orders of magnitude) constants when modeled using first order kinetics. An effect of small primary sizes (<15 nm) was observed, leading to increased dissolution rate constants and solubility in some cases. However, the often extensive particle agglomeration can result in reduced nanospecific effects on dissolution and also an increased uncertainty related to the surface area, a parameter that largely influence the extent of dissolution. Promising ways to model surface areas of NPs in solution using fractal dimensions and size distributions are discussed in addition to nanospecific aspects related to other processes such as corrosion, adsorption of natural organic matter (NOM), presence of capping agents, and existence of surface defects. The importance of the experimental design on the results of dissolution experiments of metal and metal oxide NPs is moreover highlighted, including the influence of ionic metal solubility and choice of particle dispersion methodology.",Tumor Chemosensitization through Oncogene Knockdown Mediated by Unique α-Tocopherylated Cationic Geminis.,https://www.ncbi.nlm.nih.gov/pubmed/30908014,Biomacromolecules,2019 04 08,"Herein, siRNA transfection efficiency of a unique set of α-tocopherylated gemini lipids has been established in vitro and in vivo. High efficacy of oncogene silencing achieved using the biomacromolecular assembly, formed from siRNA complexes of co-liposomes containing an α-tocopherylated gemini lipid, has been utilized for tumor regression via chemosensitization. Delivery studies with the gemini bearing hydroxyethyl headgroup with octamethylene spacer (TH8S) pointed to a higher siRNA transfection efficacy than its analog without hydroxyethyl group (T8S). Owing to p53 upregulation, transfected cells showed enhanced sensitivity to the chemotherapeutic agent, doxorubicin. Studies in murine model revealed significantly low levels of survivin mRNA in xenograft tumors injected with siRNA lipoplexes, leading to effective inhibition of tumor growth and an increase in sensitivity of the tumors toward doxorubicin. These findings enable us to propose the anti-survivin siRNA carrying TH8S co-liposomes as a potent member of cancer management strategies using suicide gene therapy.","Transition-Metal (Pd, Ni, Mn)-Catalyzed C-C Bond Constructions Involving Unactivated Alkyl Halides and Fundamental Synthetic Building Blocks.",https://www.ncbi.nlm.nih.gov/pubmed/30908013,Accounts of chemical research,2019 06 16,"The catalytic construction of C-C bonds between organohalide or pseudohalide electrophiles and fundamental building blocks such as alkenes, arenes, or CO are widely utilized metal-catalyzed processes. The use of simple, widely available unactivated alkyl halides in these catalytic transformations has significantly lagged behind the use of aryl or vinyl electrophiles. This difference is primarily due to the relative difficulty of activating alkyl halides with transition metals under mild conditions. This Account details our group's work toward developing a general catalytic manifold for the construction of C-C bonds using unactivated alkyl halides and a range of simple chemical feedstocks. Critical to the strategy was the implementation of new modes of hybrid organometallic-radical reactivity in catalysis. Generation of carbon-centered radicals from alkyl halides using transition metals offers a solution to challenges associated with the application of alkyl electrophiles in classical two-electron reaction modes. A major focus of this work was the development of general palladium-catalyzed carbocyclizations and intermolecular cross-couplings of unactivated alkyl halides (alkyl-Mizoroki-Heck-type reactions). Initial studies centered on the use of alkyl iodides in these processes, but subsequent studies determined that the use of an electron-rich ferrocenyl bisphosphine (dtbpf) enables the palladium-catalyzed carbocyclizations of unactivated alkyl bromides. Mechanistic studies of these reactions revealed interesting details regarding a difference in mechanism between reactions of alkyl iodides and alkyl bromides in carbocyclizations. These studies were consistent with alkyl bromides reacting via an autotandem catalytic process involving atom-transfer radical cyclization (ATRC) followed by catalytic dehydrohalogenation. Reactions of alkyl iodides, on the other hand, involved metal-initiated radical chain pathways. Recent studies have expanded the scope of alkyl-Mizoroki-Heck-type reactions to the use of a first-row transition metal. Inexpensive nickel precatalysts, in combination with the bisphosphine ligand Xantphos, efficiently activate alkyl bromides for both intra- and intermolecular C-C bond-forming reactions. The reaction scope is similar to the palladium-catalyzed system, but in addition, alkene regioisomeric ratios are dramatically improved over those in reactions with palladium, solving one of the drawbacks of our previous work. Initial mechanistic studies were consistent with a hybrid organometallic-radical mechanism for the nickel-catalyzed reactions. The novel reactivity of the palladium catalysts in the alkyl-Mizoroki-Heck-type reactions have also paved the way for the development of other C-C bond-forming processes of unactivated alkyl halides, including aromatic C-H alkylations as well as low-pressure alkoxycarbonylations. Related hybrid organometallic-radical reactivity of manganese has led to an alkene dicarbofunctionalization using alkyl iodides.",Enabling Multifunctional Organic Transistors with Fine-Tuned Charge Transport.,https://www.ncbi.nlm.nih.gov/pubmed/30908012,Accounts of chemical research,2019 04 16,"Organic field-effect transistors (OFETs) are promising candidates for many electronic applications not only because of the intrinsic features of organic semiconductors in mechanical flexibility and solution processability but also owing to their multifunctionalities promised by combined signal switching and transduction properties. In contrast to rapid developments of high performance devices, the construction of multifunctional OFETs remains challenging. A key issue is fine-tuning the charge transport by modulating electric fields that are coupled with various external stimuli. Given that the charge transport is determined by complicated factors involving material and device engineering, the development of effective strategies to manipulate charge transport is highly desired toward state-of-the-art multifunctional OFETs. In this Account, we present our recent progress on device-engineered OFETs for sensing applications and thermoelectric studies of organic semiconductors. The interactions between organic semiconductors and the target analyte determine the performance of chemical sensors based on OFETs. We introduced gas receptors and in situ tailored molecular antenna on the surface of ultrathin active layers. The engineered interfaces enable direct and specific semiconductor-analyte interactions, as demonstrated in developed chemical sensors and biosensors with prominent sensitivity and good selectivity. In comparison with chemical stimuli, many physical stimuli such as pressure typically possess a limit effect on the charge transport properties of organic semiconductors. By utilizing the suspended-gate geometry, the carrier concentration in a conductive channel can be controlled quantitatively by the pressure dominated changes in the capacitance of an air dielectric layer, allowing for ultrasensitive pressure detection in a unique manner. More importantly, the transduced current can be further processed by a synaptic OFET, in which the proton/electron coupling interfaces contribute to the dynamic modulation of carrier concentration, thus mimicking biological synapses. The integrated pressure sensor and synaptic OFETs, namely, the dual-organic-transistor-based tactile-perception element, has exhibited promising applications in artificial intelligence elements. Aiming at revealing thermoelectric (TE) properties of organic semiconductors, we also investigated field-modulated TE performance of several high-mobility semiconductors by varying the driving electric field to the temperature gradient. This has been confirmed to offer a strategy to accelerate the search for promising TE materials from well-developed organic semiconductors. By tuning the charge transport process in the device, the functional modulation of OFETs has experienced significant progress in the preceding years. The exploration of new ways to create OFETs with more fascinating functionalities is still full of opportunities to obtain greater benefit from organic transistors.",A Unified Framework for the Incorporation of Bioorthogonal Compound Exposure Probes within Biological Compartments.,https://www.ncbi.nlm.nih.gov/pubmed/30908011,ACS chemical biology,2019 04 19,"Compartmentalization is a crucial facet of many biological systems, and key aspects of cellular processes rely on spatial segregation within the cell. While many drug targets reside in specific intracellular compartments, the tools available for assessing compound exposure are generally limited to whole-cell measurements. To address this gap, we recently developed a bioorthogonal chemistry-based method to assess compartment-specific compound exposure and demonstrated its use in Gram-negative bacteria. To expand the applicability of this approach, we report here novel bioorthogonal probe modalities which enable diverse probe incorporation strategies. The probes we developed utilize a cleavable thiocarbamate linker to connect localizing elements such as metabolic substrates to a cyclooctyne moiety which enables the detection of azide-containing molecules. Adducts between the probe and azide-bearing compounds can be recovered and affinity purified after exposure experiments, thus facilitating the mass-spectrometry based analysis used to assess compound exposure. The bioorthogonal system reported here thus provides a valuable new tool for interrogating compartment-specific compound exposure in a variety of biological contexts while retaining a simple and unified sample preparation and analysis workflow.",Spectral-Selective Plasmonic Polymer Nanocomposites Across the Visible and Near-Infrared.,https://www.ncbi.nlm.nih.gov/pubmed/30908010,ACS nano,2019 04 24,"State-of-the-art commercial light-reflecting glass is coated with a metalized film to decrease the transmittance of electromagnetic waves. In addition to the cost of the metalized film, one major limitation of such light-reflecting glass is the lack of spectral selectivity over the entire visible and near-infrared (NIR) spectrum. To address this challenge, we herein effectively harness the transmittance, reflectance, and filtration of any wavelength across the visible and NIR, by judiciously controlling the planar orientation of two-dimensional plasmonic silver nanoplates (AgNPs) in polymer nanocomposites. In contrast to conventional bulk polymer nanocomposites where plasmonic nanoparticles are randomly mixed within a polymer matrix, our thin-film polymer nanocomposites comprise a single layer, or any desired number of multiple layers, of planarly oriented AgNPs separated by tunable spacings. This design employs a minimal amount of metal and yet efficiently manages light across the visible and NIR. The thin-film plasmonic polymer nanocomposites are expected to have a significant impact on spectral-selective light modulation, sensing, optics, optoelectronics, and photonics.",In Situ Study of Molecular Structure of Water and Ice Entrapped in Graphene Nanovessels.,https://www.ncbi.nlm.nih.gov/pubmed/30908009,ACS nano,2019 04 24,"Water is ubiquitous in natural systems, ranging from the vast oceans to the nanocapillaries in the earth crust or cellular organelles. In bulk or in intimate contact with solid surfaces, water molecules arrange themselves according to their hydrogen (H) bonding, which critically affects their short- and long-range molecular structures. Formation of H-bonds among water molecules designates the energy levels of certain nonbonding molecular orbitals of water, which are quantifiable by spectroscopic techniques. While the molecular architecture of water in nanoenclosures is of particular interest to both science and industry, it requires fine spectroscopic probes with nanometer spatial resolution and sub-eV energy sensitivity. Graphene liquid cells (GLCs), which feature opposing closely spaced sheets of hydrophobic graphene, facilitate high-resolution transmission electron microscopy (TEM) and electron energy-loss spectroscopy (EELS) measurements of attoliter water volumes encapsulated tightly in the GLC nanovessels. We perform in situ TEM and EELS analysis of water encased in thin GLCs exposed to room and cryogenic temperatures to examine the nanoscale arrangement of the contained water molecules. Simultaneous quantification of GLC thickness leads to the conclusion that H-bonding strengthens under increased water confinement. The present results demonstrate the feasibility of nanoscale chemical characterization of aqueous fluids trapped in GLC nanovessels and offer insights on water molecule arrangement under high-confinement conditions.",Lipid-Based DNA Therapeutics: Hallmarks of Non-Viral Gene Delivery.,https://www.ncbi.nlm.nih.gov/pubmed/30908008,ACS nano,2019 04 24,"Gene therapy is a promising strategy for the treatment of monogenic disorders. Non-viral gene delivery systems including lipid-based DNA therapeutics offer the opportunity to deliver an encoding gene sequence specifically to the target tissue and thus enable the expression of therapeutic proteins in diseased cells. Currently, available gene delivery approaches based on DNA are inefficient and require improvements to achieve clinical utility. In this Review, we discuss state-of-the-art lipid-based DNA delivery systems that have been investigated in a preclinical setting. We emphasize factors influencing the delivery and subsequent gene expression in vitro, ex vivo, and in vivo. In addition, we cover aspects of nanoparticle engineering and optimization for DNA therapeutics. Finally, we highlight achievements of lipid-based DNA therapies in clinical trials."

However, few studies have examined its therapeutic potential in prostate cancer (PC), a most common and highly aggressive malignancy among male population. We used both LNCaP, and PC3 and PC3-AR (androgen receptor) cells as the model system and assessed the effects of nimotuzumab on epithelial-mesenchymal transition (EMT) in vitro and in vivo. The EMT makers were detected by immunohistochemistry, qRT-PCR and Western blot. MTT, wound healing assay, and transwell assay were used to measure cell viability, migration, and invasion, respectively. For mechanistic understanding, we evaluated the significance of Akt/Y-box binding protein-1 (YB-1)/AR axis in nimotuzumab-induced EMT by overexpressing AR, activating Akt using SC79, and/or downregulating YB-1 using siRNA. Nimotuzumab suppressed the xenograft growth from both LNCaP and PC3 cells in vivo, which was associated with reduced EMT. Consistently, nimotuzumab inhibited proliferation, cell-cycle progression, EMT, and migration/invasion, but stimulated apoptosis of both LNCaP and PC3-AR cells in vitro. On the molecular level, nimotuzumab inactivated Akt and YB-1 and reduced the expression of AR. Boosting AR expression in LNCaP and PC3-AR cells antagonized the action of nimotuzumab, at least partially restored EMT, and enhanced the migration/invasion. We also found that Akt was essential for controlling YB-1 activation, and both critical for regulating the levels of AR and EMT-related biomarkers. In this study, we presented our novel findings that by targeting the Akt/YB-1/AR axis, nimotuzumab significantly inhibited EMT of PC cells. Considering that EMT is a critical mechanism contributing to the metastatic spread of cancer cells, nimotuzumab may become a promising therapy for alleviating the malignant progression of PC. © 2019 IUBMB Life, 1-14, 2019.",Zoonotic Staphylococcus pseudintermedius sinonasal infections: risk factors and resistance patterns.,https://www.ncbi.nlm.nih.gov/pubmed/30907985,International forum of allergy & rhinology,2019 03 25,Staphylococcus pseudintermedius is a Gram-positive bacteria that colonizes the skin and orifices of healthy canines and felines.

Increasing evidence implicates beneficial effects of omega-3 fatty acids including eicosapentaenoic acid (EPA) and docosahexaenoic acid (DHA) and ascorbic acid (AA) in cardiovascular diseases, in particular their role in ameliorating fibrosis. In the current study, we aim to assess the cytoprotective role of EPA + DHA and AA in protecting embryonic stem cell (ESC)-derived cardiac lineage cells and amelioration of fibrosis. Herein, we have shown that preincubation of the cells with EPA + DHA + AA prior to H2 O2 treatment attenuated generation of reactive oxygen species (ROS) and enhanced cell viability. Gene expression analysis revealed that preincubation with EPA + DHA + AA followed by H2 O2 treatment, upregulated heme oxygenase-1 (HO-1) along with cardiac markers (GATA4, myosin heavy chain, α isoform [MYH6]), connexin 43 [CX43]) and attenuated oxidative stress-induced upregulation of fibroblast markers (vimentin and collagen type 1 [Col1]).

Inflammatory effects of neutrophils are modulated by extracellular purines such as adenosine (ADO) that is inhibitory or ATP that generally up-regulates effector functions. In order to evaluate the effects of ADO on NETs, human neutrophils were isolated from peripheral venous blood from healthy donors and stimulated to make NETs. Treatment with ADO inhibited NET production as quantified by 2 methods: SYTOX green fluorescence and human neutrophil elastase (HNE)-DNA ELISA assay. Specific ADO receptor agonist and antagonist were tested for their effects on NET production. The ADO 2A receptor (A2A R) agonist CSG21680 inhibited NETs to a similar degree as ADO, whereas the A2A R antagonist ZM241385 prevented ADO's NET-inhibitory effects. Additionally, CD73 is a membrane bound ectonucleotidase expressed on mesenchymal stromal cells (MSCs) that allows manipulation of extracellular purines in tissues such as bone marrow. The effects of MSCs on NET formation were evaluated in coculture. MSCs reduced NET formation in a CD73-dependent manner. These results imply that extracellular purine balance may locally regulate NETosis and may be actively modulated by stromal cells to maintain tissue homeostasis."

Therefore, we compared rotenone treated males (2.8 mg/kg/day, i.p.) to females at increasing doses (2.8 mg/kg/day, 3.2 mg/kg/day, 3.6 mg/kg/day and 1.6 mg/kg BID, i.p.). Female rats receiving 3.2 mg/kg, and 3.6 mg/kg rotenone displayed significant loss of dopaminergic neurons in the substantia nigra as assessed by stereology, which was accompanied by a loss of striatal dopaminergic terminals. Even at these higher doses, however, females showed less inflammation, and less accumulation of α-synuclein and transferrin, possibly as a result of preserved autophagy. Thus, the bias toward increased male incidence of human Parkinson's disease is reflected in the rotenone model. Whether such sex differences will translate into differences in responses to mechanism-driven therapeutic interventions remains to be determined.",Women's Values and Preferences Regarding Osteoporosis Treatments: A Systematic Review.,https://www.ncbi.nlm.nih.gov/pubmed/30907968,The Journal of clinical endocrinology and metabolism,2019 03 28,Several treatments are available to reduce the risk of fragility fractures associated with osteoporosis.

AHR also regulates developmental processes, like craniofacial development and hematopoiesis, in the absence of environmental exposures. Zebrafish have three paralogues of AHR: ahr1a, ahr1b and ahr2. Adult zebrafish with mutations in ahr2 exhibited craniofacial and fin defects. However, the degree to which ahr1a and ahr1b influence ahr2 signaling and contribute to fin and craniofacial development are not known. We compared morphology of adult ahr2 mutants and ahr1a;ahr1b single and double mutant zebrafish. We found that ahr1a;ahr1b single and double mutants were morphologically normal while ahr2 mutant zebrafish demonstrated fin and craniofacial malformations. At 5 days post fertilization, both ahr1a;ahr1b and ahr2 mutant larvae were normal, suggesting that adult phenotypes are due to defects in maturation or maintenance. Next, we analyzed the function of zebrafish AHRs activated by environmental ligands. The prototypical AHR ligand, TCDD, induces toxicity in humans and rodents via AHR and causes cardiotoxicity in zebrafish embryos. It has been shown that embryos with mutations in ahr2 are resistant to TCDD toxicity, yet it is unclear whether ahr1 receptors are required. Further, though AHR was shown to interact with estrogen receptor alpha following TCDD treatment, it is not known whether this interaction is constitutive or context-dependent. To determine whether estrogen receptors are constitutive cofactors for AHR signaling, we used genetic and pharmacologic techniques to analyze TCDD-dependent toxicity in estrogen receptor and ahr mutant embryos. We found that embryos with mutations in ahr1a;ahr1b or estrogen receptor genes are susceptible to TCDD toxicity while ahr2 mutant embryos are TCDD-resistant. Moreover, pharmacologic blockade of nuclear estrogen receptors failed to prevent TCDD toxicity. These findings suggest that ahr1 genes do not have overlapping functions with ahr2 in fin and craniofacial development or TCDD-dependent toxicity, and that estrogen receptors are not constitutive partners of ahr2.",Efficacy of Pharmacological Therapies for the Prevention of Fractures in Postmenopausal Women: A Network Meta-Analysis.,https://www.ncbi.nlm.nih.gov/pubmed/30907957,The Journal of clinical endocrinology and metabolism,2019 03 28,Osteoporosis and osteopenia are associated with increased fracture incidence in postmenopausal women.

Sixty-nine awake rats acutely intoxicated by CN (IP, KCN 7mg/kg) received saline, MB (20mg/kg) or hydroxocobalamin (HyCo, 150 mg/kg) when in deep coma. Survival in this model was very low, reaching 9% at 60 minutes without any treatment. MB significantly increased survival (59%, p < 0.001) at 60 minutes, versus 37% with HyCo (p < 0.01). In addition, eight urethane-anesthetized rats were exposed to a sub-lethal CN intoxication (KCN, 0.75 mg/kg/min iv for 4 minutes); they received MB (20mg/kg, iv) or saline, 5 minutes after the end of CN exposure. All MB treated rats displayed a significant reduction in hyperlactacidemia, a restoration of pyruvate/lactate ratio -a marker of NAD/NADH ratio- and an increase in CO2 production, a marker of the activity of the TCA cycle. These changes were also associated with a 2-fold increase in the pool of CN in red cells. Based on series of in vitro experiments, looking at the effects of MB on NADH, as well as the redox effects of MB on hemoglobin and cytochrome C, we hypothesize that the antidotal properties of MB can in large part be accounted for by its ability to readily restore NAD/NADH ratio and to cyclically re-oxidize then reduce the iron in hemoglobin and the electron chain complexes. All of these effects can account for the rapid antidotal properties of this dye following CN poisoning."

Cross-sectional research was conducted among 730 Polish female university students, aged 19-25 years. Anthropometric measurements were performed and data about socioeconomic status were collected. The results showed no statistically significant relationships between both right- or left-hand 2D:4D digit ratio and body height and BMI either in univariate linear regressions or in multivariate regression when SES was included in the models. The correlation between right-hand 2D:4D digit ratio and WHR also was not statistically significant. There were significant linear negative relationships between left 2D:4D and WHR. The significant linear negative relationships between both right and left 2D:4D and waist circumference and WHtR were found. Relationships between digit ratio and WC and WHtR were also tested by multiple regression analyses with SES included in the models. The results were statistically significant. Additionally, statistically significant differences in both right- and left digit ratios depending of the categories of waist circumference and WHtR were found.

Aim: The aim of this retrospective study was to assess their prevalence among a Slovenian dental school patient population. Materials and methods: A total of 3668 PMMs (1361 first, 1573 second, and 734 third) were evaluated by means of intraoral (periapical and bite-wing) radiographs that were collected from dental records of 1317 patients (708 females and 609 males) aged 13-92 years (mean age 37.3 years). The radiographs were evaluated independently by two observers under optimal conditions using a viewing box and a magnifying glass. 95% confidence intervals (CI) for the prevalence of three-rooted PMMs in the population were estimated using Wald's method. The Fisher's exact test was applied to examine any statistically significant difference among PMM groups, between left and right teeth and between male and female patients. Results: Three roots were identified in 1.32% [0.82%-2.10%, 95% CI] of the evaluated first PMMs, 0.25% [0.07%-0.61%, 95% CI] of second, and 1.77% [1.01%-3.04%, 95% CI] of third PMMs. The overall prevalence of three-rooted PMMs was 0.95% [0.68%-1.33%, 95% CI]. The second PMM was less often affected than the first or the third PMM (p < 0.001). No statistically significant differences for three-rooted first, second and third PMMs were detected with respect to sex (p > 0.05) or the side of occurrence (left vs. right side, p > 0.05). Conclusions: A relatively low prevalence of three-rooted PMMs in the examined Slovenian population is in agreement with the available data for Europeans. Three-rooted variants occur least frequently in second PMMs. From a clinical viewpoint, the possibility of three-rooted PMMs should always be considered and looked for, even when treating indigenous European patients.",Air-plasma treatment promotes bone-like nano-hydroxylapatite formation on protein films for enhanced in vivo osteogenesis.,https://www.ncbi.nlm.nih.gov/pubmed/30907916,Biomaterials science,2019 06 10,"Introducing hydroxylapatite (HAp) into biomolecular materials is a promising approach to improve their bone regenerative capability. Thus a facile method needs to be developed to achieve this goal. Here we show that a simple air-plasma treatment of silk fibroin (SF) films for 5 min induced the formation of bone-like plate-shaped nano-HAp (nHAp) on their surface and the resultant material efficiently enhanced in vivo osteogenesis. The air-plasma-treated SF films (termed A-SF) presented surface nano-pillars and enhanced hydrophilicity compared to the pristine SF films (termed SF), making the A-SF and SF films induce the formation of plate-shaped/more-crystalline and needle-like/less-crystalline nHAp, respectively. The mineralized A-SF and SF films (termed A-SF-nHAp and SF-nHAp, respectively) and their non-mineralized counterparts were seeded with rat mesenchymal stem cells and subcutaneously implanted into the rat models. The A-SF-nHAp and A-SF films exhibited more efficient bone formation than the SF-nHAp and SF films in 4 weeks due to their unique nanotopography, with the A-SF-nHAp films being more efficient than the A-SF films. This work shows that a combination of the air-plasma treatment and the subsequent nHAp mineralization most efficiently promotes bone formation. Our plasma-based method is an attractive approach to enhance the bone regenerative capacity of protein-based biomaterials.",A theoretical study of several fully hydrogenated borophenes.,https://www.ncbi.nlm.nih.gov/pubmed/30907915,Physical chemistry chemical physics : PCCP,2019 04 05,"Several recently synthesized two dimensional borophene monolayers are almost all metallic with a strong anisotropic character, but their structural instability and the need to explore their novel physical properties are still ongoing issues. We present a detailed study of four fully hydrogenated borophenes (β12, δ3, δ5 and α borophanes) by first-principles calculations. According to phonon dispersion relations and ab initio molecular dynamics simulations, δ3 and δ5 borophanes are dynamically and thermally stable. The structural, mechanical, and electronic properties of δ3 and δ5 borophanes are analyzed. The results indicate that charge transfer from B to H atoms is crucial for the stability of two borophane phases. The HSE06 calculations predict that both δ3 and δ5 borophanes are semiconductors with indirect band gaps of 1.51 and 1.99 eV, respectively.

Herein, we report the construction of a dual-modal time-gated luminescence (TGL)/MRI nanoprobe, BHHBB-Eu3+@MnO2, for glutathione (GSH) by anchoring luminescent β-diketone-Eu3+ complexes on layered MnO2 nanosheets. The fabricated nanoprobe exhibited very week luminescence and MR signals since the luminescence of the Eu3+ complex was quenched by MnO2 nanosheets and Mn atoms were isolated from water. Upon exposure to GSH, the MnO2 nanosheets were rapidly and selectively reduced to Mn2+ ions, resulting in remarkable enhancements of TGL and MR signals simultaneously. The combination of TGL and MR detection modes enables the nanoprobe to be used for detecting GSH in a wide concentration range (1-1000 μM) and imaging GSH at different resolutions and depths ranging from the subcellular level to the whole body. Furthermore, the as-prepared nanoprobe exhibited a low cytotoxicity and good biocompatibility, rapid response rate, long-lived luminescence, and high sensitivity and selectivity for responding to GSH. These features allowed it to be successfully used for the TGL detection of GSH in human sera, TGL imaging of GSH in living cells and zebrafish, as well as dual-modal TGL/MR imaging of GSH in tumor-bearing mice. All of these results highlighted the applicability and advantages of the nanoprobe for detecting GSH in vitro and in vivo.",Cubic versus hexagonal - effect of host crystallinity on the T1 shortening behaviour of NaGdF4 nanoparticles.,https://www.ncbi.nlm.nih.gov/pubmed/30907912,Nanoscale,2019 04 05,"Sodium gadolinium fluoride (NaGdF4) nanoparticles are promising candidates as T1 shortening magnetic resonance imaging (MRI) contrast agents due to the paramagnetic properties of the Gd3+ ion. Effects of size and surface modification of these nanoparticles on proton relaxation times have been widely studied. However, to date, there has been no report on how T1 relaxivity (r1) is affected by the different polymorphs in which NaGdF4 crystallizes: cubic (α) and hexagonal (β). Here, a microwave-assisted thermal decomposition method was developed that grants selective access to NaGdF4 nanoparticles of either phase in the same size range, allowing the influence of host crystallinity on r1 to be investigated. It was found that at 3 T cubic NaGdF4 nanoparticles exhibit larger r1 values than their hexagonal analogues. This result was interpreted based on Solomon-Bloembergen-Morgan theory, suggesting that the inner sphere contribution to r1 is more pronounced for cubic NaGdF4 nanoparticles as compared to their hexagonal counterparts. This holds true irrespective of the chosen surface modification, i.e. small citrate groups or longer chain poly(acrylic acid). Key aspects were found to be a polymorph-induced larger hydrodynamic diameter and the higher magnetization possessed by cubic nanoparticles.",Enhanced proliferation and differentiation of retinal progenitor cells through a self-healing injectable hydrogel.,https://www.ncbi.nlm.nih.gov/pubmed/30907911,Biomaterials science,2019 05 28,"Retinal progenitor cell (RPC)-based transportation therapy is a promising strategy for repairing visual loss caused by retinal degeneration (RD) in people; however, its application is still significantly limited by the low effective delivery, proliferation and differentiation of RPCs. Herein, a self-healing injectable hydrogel (CS-Odex) based on chitosan hydrochloride (CS) and oxidized dextran (Odex) was developed via a dynamic Schiff-base linkage as a bioactive vehicle for the delivery of RPCs. Moreover, its biological effects on the RPC behaviors, including survival, proliferation and differentiation, were systematically evaluated. The CS-Odex hydrogel exhibits good biocompatibility and suitable mechanical stiffness for the growth of RPCs, and the cells can retain a high survival ratio (about 90%) with the protection of the self-healing CS-Odex hydrogels post-injection. In addition, the proliferation of RPCs in the CS-Odex hydrogels was significantly enhanced by activating the Akt and Erk pathways, especially in the hydrogel with higher CS content. Moreover, the differentiation of RPCs was improved by the CS-Odex hydrogel. Particularly, the differentiation of RPCs towards photoreceptors, the most important cell-type for RD, was elevated. Therefore, the self-healing injectable CS-Odex hydrogel would provide a promising platform for the delivery of RPCs and promote the proliferation and differentiation of RPCs towards RPC-based transplantation therapy in the future."

Softening involves multiple co-ordinated events leading to modifications of the cell wall architecture. Several studies described that UV-B radiation positively affects both the nutraceutical and aesthetical qualities of fruit. However, very few studies investigated the effect of UV-B irradiation on the activity of cell wall-related enzymes. This research aimed at studying how different UV-B treatments (10 min and 60 min) affect the activity of cell wall-modifying enzymes (pectin methylesterase, polygalacturonase and β-galactosidase) together with the expression of some of their isoforms up to 36 h after UV-B treatment of peach (cv. Fairtime, melting phenotype) fruit. Results revealed that UV-B radiation did not affect the soluble solid content and the titratable acidity, two important parameters influencing consumers' choice and taste. In contrast, UV-B was effective at reducing the loss of firmness 24 h after the 60 min irradiation. Generally, a lower activity of the hydrolytic enzymes compared to untreated fruit was observed, regardless of the UV-B dose. However, gene expression did not reflect the corresponding enzymatic activity. Based on these results, UV-B irradiation might be a successful tool in reducing the loss of firmness of peach fruit during post-harvest, thus improving their quality and shelf-life.",Rational design of few-layer MoSe2 confined within ZnSe-C hollow porous spheres for high-performance lithium-ion and sodium-ion batteries.,https://www.ncbi.nlm.nih.gov/pubmed/30907895,Nanoscale,2019 04 05,"Rechargeable battery systems, including Li-ion batteries and Na-ion batteries, have attracted great interest in energy storage because of their high energy density, low cost, efficient energy storage and suitable redox potential. Nevertheless, their rapid development is still greatly hampered by some typical constraints including low coulombic efficiency, large volume changes and severe particle agglomeration and pulverization during the charge-discharge process. Here, we fabricate a few-layer MoSe2 confined within a ZnSe-C hollow porous sphere nanocomposite through a simple self-assembly strategy followed by selenization, which efficiently circumvents these problems. The fabricated ZnSe/MoSe2@C electrode demonstrates diverse advantages, including the existence of a few-layer structure, an in situ porous carbon matrix, multicomponent coordination and excellent pseudocapacitive behavior. When used as an anode material, it displays extraordinarily attractive electrochemical performance for both lithium-ion batteries (LIBs) and sodium-ion batteries (SIBs). The reversible capacity of ZnSe/MoSe2@C for LIBs reaches as high as 1051 mA h g-1 at 0.2 A g-1 (150 cycles). A long-term high-rate cycling test reveals an excellent stability of 524 mA h g-1 at 4 A g-1 after 600 cycles. In addition, for SIBs, ZnSe/MoSe2@C also manifests a high initial coulombic efficiency of 89% at 0.2 A g-1 and a remarkable reversible capacity of 381 mA h g-1 at a high current density of 4 A g-1 even after 250 cycles with negligible capacity loss. This is one of the best performances of ZnSe-based anode materials for SIBs reported so far. The regulation strategy reported in the present work is expected to offer new insights into the fabrication of high performance anode materials for SIBs.","Isolating, Sequencing and Analyzing Extracellular MicroRNAs from Human Mesenchymal Stem Cells.",https://www.ncbi.nlm.nih.gov/pubmed/30907893,Journal of visualized experiments : JoVE,2019 03 25,"Extracellular and circulating RNAs (exRNA) are produced by many cell types of the body and exist in numerous bodily fluids such as saliva, plasma, serum, milk and urine.

Setup of a classic multicolor panel requires high-end instruments, custom labeled antibodies, and careful study design to minimize spectral overlap. We developed a multiparametric analysis to identify major human immune populations (CD4+ and CD8+ T cells, γδ T cells, B cells, NK cells and monocytes) in peripheral blood by combining seven lineage markers using only two fluorochromes. Our strategy is based on the observation that lineage markers are constantly expressed in a unique combination by each cell population. Combining this information with a careful titration of the antibodies allows investigators to record five additional markers, expanding the optical limit of most flow cytometers. Head-to-head comparison demonstrated that the vast majority of immune cell populations in peripheral blood can be characterized with comparable accuracy between our method and the classic ""one fluorochrome-one marker approach"", although the latter is still more precise for identifying populations such as NKT cells and γδ T cells. Combining seven markers using two fluorochromes allows for the analysis of complex immune cell populations and clinical samples on affordable 6-10 fluorochrome flow cytometers, and even on 2-3 fluorochrome field instruments in areas with limited resources. High-end instruments can also benefit from this approach by using extra fluorochromes to accomplish deeper flow cytometry analysis. This approach is also very well suited for screening several cell populations in the case of clinical samples with limited number of cells.",The Left Pneumonectomy Combined with Monocrotaline or Sugen as a Model of Pulmonary Hypertension in Rats.,https://www.ncbi.nlm.nih.gov/pubmed/30907889,Journal of visualized experiments : JoVE,2019 03 25,"In this protocol, we detail the correct procedural steps and necessary precautions to successfully perform a left pneumonectomy and induce PAH in rats with the additional administration of monocrotaline (MCT) or SU5416 (Sugen). We also compare these two models to other PAH models commonly used in research. In the last few years, the focus of animal PAH models has moved towards studying the mechanism of angioproliferation of plexiform lesions, in which the role of increased pulmonary blood flow is considered as an important trigger in the development of severe pulmonary vascular remodeling. One of the most promising rodent models of increased pulmonary flow is the unilateral left pneumonectomy combined with a ""second hit"" of MCT or Sugen. The removal of the left lung leads to increased and turbulent pulmonary blood flow and vascular remodeling. Currently, there is no detailed procedure of the pneumonectomy surgery in rats. This article details a step-by-step protocol of the pneumonectomy surgical procedure and post-operative care in male Sprague-Dawley rats. Briefly, the animal is anesthetized and the chest is opened. Once the left pulmonary artery, pulmonary vein, and bronchus are visualized, they are ligated and the left lung is removed. The chest then closed and the animal recovered. Blood is forced to circulate only on the right lung. This increased vascular pressure leads to a progressive remodeling and occlusion of small pulmonary arteries. The second hit of MCT or Sugen is used one week post-surgery to induce endothelial dysfunction. The combination of increased blood flow in the lung and endothelial dysfunction produces severe PAH. The primary limitation of this procedure is that it requires general surgical skills.",Ultrasound Imaging of the Thoracic and Abdominal Aorta in Mice to Determine Aneurysm Dimensions.,https://www.ncbi.nlm.nih.gov/pubmed/30907888,Journal of visualized experiments : JoVE,2019 04 07,"Contemporary high-resolution ultrasound instruments have sufficient resolution to facilitate the measurement of mouse aortas.

Sequential measurements of aortic dimensions by ultrasound are the principal approach for assessing the development and progression of aortic aneurysms in vivo. Although many reported studies used ultrasound imaging to measure aortic diameters as a primary endpoint, there are confounding factors, such as probe position and cardiac cycle, that may impact the accuracy of data acquisition, analysis, and interpretation. The purpose of this protocol is to provide a practical guide on the use of ultrasound to measure the aortic diameter in a reliable and reproducible manner. This protocol introduces the preparation of mice and instruments, the acquisition of appropriate ultrasound images, and data analysis.","A Deep-sequencing-assisted, Spontaneous Suppressor Screen in the Fission Yeast Schizosaccharomyces pombe.",https://www.ncbi.nlm.nih.gov/pubmed/30907886,Journal of visualized experiments : JoVE,2019 03 25,"A genetic screen for mutant alleles that suppress phenotypic defects caused by a mutation is a powerful approach to identify genes that belong to closely related biochemical pathways. Previous methods such as the Synthetic Genetic Array (SGA) analysis, and random mutagenesis techniques using ultraviolet (UV) or chemicals like ethyl methanesulfonate (EMS) or N-ethyl-N- nitrosourea (ENU), have been widely used but are often costly and laborious. Also, these mutagen-based screening methods are frequently associated with severe side effects on the organism, inducing multiple mutations that add to the complexity of isolating the suppressors. Here, we present a simple and effective protocol to identify suppressor mutations in mutants which confer a growth defect in Schizosaccharomyces pombe. The fitness of cells with a growth deficiency in standard rich liquid media or synthetic liquid media can be monitored for recovery using an automated 96-well plate reader over an extended period. Once a cell acquires a suppressor mutation in the culture, its descendants outcompete those of the parental cells. The recovered cells that have a competitive growth advantage over the parental cells can then be isolated and backcrossed with the parental cells. The suppressor mutations are then identified using whole-genome sequencing. Using this approach, we have successfully isolated multiple suppressors that alleviate the severe growth defects caused by loss of Elf1, an AAA+ family ATPase that is important in nuclear mRNA transport and maintenance of genomic stability. There are currently over 400 genes in S. pombe with mutants conferring a growth defect. As many of these genes are uncharacterized, we propose that our method will hasten the identification of novel functional interactions with this user-friendly, high-throughput approach.","Expression, Solubilization, and Purification of Eukaryotic Borate Transporters.",https://www.ncbi.nlm.nih.gov/pubmed/30907885,Journal of visualized experiments : JoVE,2019 03 25,"The Solute Carrier 4 (SLC4) family of proteins is called the bicarbonate transporters and includes the archetypal protein Anion Exchanger 1 (AE1, also known as Band 3), the most abundant membrane protein in the red blood cells. The SLC4 family is homologous with borate transporters, which have been characterized in plants and fungi. It remains a significant technical challenge to express and purify membrane transport proteins to homogeneity in quantities suitable for structural or functional studies. Here we describe detailed procedures for the overexpression of borate transporters in Saccharomyces cerevisiae, isolation of yeast membranes, solubilization of protein by detergent, and purification of borate transporter homologs from S. cerevisiae, Arabidopsis thaliana, and Oryza sativa. We also detail a glutaraldehyde cross-linking experiment to assay multimerization of homomeric transporters. Our generalized procedures can be applied to all three proteins and have been optimized for efficacy. Many of the strategies developed here can be utilized for the study of other challenging membrane proteins.",Quantification of Hypopigmentation Activity In Vitro.,https://www.ncbi.nlm.nih.gov/pubmed/30907884,Journal of visualized experiments : JoVE,2019 03 25,"This study presents laboratory methods for the quantification of hypopigmentation activity in vitro. Melanin, the major pigment in melanocytes, is synthesized in response to multiple cellular and environmental factors. Melanin protects skin cells from ultraviolet damage, but also has biophysical and biochemical functions. Excessive production or accumulation of melanin in melanocytes can cause dermatological problems, such as freckles, dark spots, melasma, and moles. Therefore, the control of melanogenesis with hypopigmentation agents is important in individuals with clinical or cosmetic needs. Melanin is primarily synthesized in the melanosomes of melanocytes in a complex biochemical process called melanogenesis, which is influenced by extrinsic and intrinsic factors, such as hormones, inflammation, age, and ultraviolet light exposure. We describe three methods to determine the hypopigmentation activity of chemicals or natural substances in melanocytes: measurement of the 1) cellular tyrosinase activity and 2) melanin content, and 3) staining and quantifying cellular melanin with image analysis. In melanogenesis, tyrosinase catalyzes the rate-limiting step that converts L-tyrosine into 3,4-dihydroxyphenylalanine (L-DOPA) and then into dopaquinone. Therefore, the inhibition of tyrosinase is a primary hypopigmentation mechanism. In cultured melanocytes, tyrosinase activity can be quantified by adding L-DOPA as a substrate and measuring dopaquinone production by spectrophotometry. Melanogenesis can also be measured by quantifying the melanin content. The melanin-containing cellular fraction is extracted with NaOH and melanin is quantified spectrophotometrically. Finally, the melanin content can be quantified by image analysis following Fontana-Masson staining of melanin. Although the results of these in vitro assays may not always be reproduced in human skin, these methods are widely used in melanogenesis research, especially as the initial step to identify potential hypopigmentation activity. These methods can also be used to assess melanocyte activity, growth, and differentiation. Consistent results with the three different methods ensure the validity of the effects."

There is, however, little known about the impact of SCI on skin wound healing in the context of animal models in controlled experimental settings. In this study, a simple, non-invasive, reproducible and clinically relevant mouse model of PUs in the context of complete SCI is presented. Adult male mice (Balb/c, 10 weeks old) were shaved and depilated. Post-depilation (24 h), mice were subjected to laminectomy followed by complete spinal cord transection (T9-T10 vertebrae). Immediately after, a skin fold on the back of the mice was lifted and sandwiched between two magnetic discs held in place for next 12 h, thus creating an ischemic area that developed into a PU over the following days. The wounded areas demonstrated tissue edema and epidermal disappearance by day 3 post-magnet application. PUs spontaneously developed and healed. Healing was, however, slower in the SCI mice compared to control non-SCI mice when the wound was created below the level of SCI. Conversely, no difference in healing was seen between SCI and control non-SCI mice when the wound was created above the level of SCI. This model is a potentially useful tool to study the dynamics of skin PU development and healing after SCI, as well as to test therapeutic approaches that may help heal such wounds.",Forced Flowering in Mandarin Trees under Phytotron Conditions.,https://www.ncbi.nlm.nih.gov/pubmed/30907871,Journal of visualized experiments : JoVE,2019 03 25,"Phytotron has been widely used to assess the effect of numerous parameters on the development of many species. However, less information is available on how to achieve fast profuse flowering in young fruit trees with this plant growth chamber. This study aimed to outline the design and performance of a fast clear methodology to force flowering in young mandarin trees (cv. Nova and cv. Clemenules) and to analyze the influence of induction intensity on inflorescence type. The combination of a short water stress period with simulated spring conditions (day 13 h, 22 °C, night 11 h, 12 °C) in the phytotron allowed flowers to be obtained only after 68-72 days from the time the experiment began. Low-temperature requirements were adequately replaced with water stress. Floral response was proportional to water stress (measured as the number of fallen leaves): the greater the induction, the larger the quantity of flowers. Floral induction intensity also influenced inflorescence type and dates for flowering. Details on artificial lighting (lumens), photoperiod, temperatures, plant size and age, induction strategy and days for each stage are provided. Obtaining flowers from fruit trees at any time, and also several times a year, can have many advantages for researchers. With the methodology proposed herein, three, or even four, flowering periods can be forced each year, and researchers should be able to decide when, and they will know, the duration of the entire process. The methodology can be useful for: flower production and in vitro pollen germination assays; experiments with pests that affect early fruit development stages; studies on fruit physiological alterations. All this can help plant breeders to shorten times to obtain male and female gametes to perform forced-crosses.",Assembly of Gold Nanorods into Chiral Plasmonic Metamolecules Using DNA Origami Templates.,https://www.ncbi.nlm.nih.gov/pubmed/30907870,Journal of visualized experiments : JoVE,2019 03 25,"The inherent addressability of DNA origami structures makes them ideal templates for the arrangement of metal nanoparticles into complex plasmonic nanostructures. The high spatial precision of a DNA origami-templated assembly allows controlling the coupling between plasmonic resonances of individual particles and enables tailoring optical properties of the constructed nanostructures. Recently, chiral plasmonic systems attracted a lot of attention due to the strong correlation between the spatial configuration of plasmonic assemblies and their optical responses (e.g., circular dichroism [CD]). In this protocol, we describe the whole workflow for the generation of DNA origami-based chiral assemblies of gold nanorods (AuNRs). The protocol includes a detailed description of the design principles and experimental procedures for the fabrication of DNA origami templates, the synthesis of AuNRs, and the assembly of origami-AuNR structures. In addition, the characterization of structures using transmission electron microscopy (TEM) and CD spectroscopy is included. The described protocol is not limited to chiral configurations and can be adapted for the construction of various plasmonic architectures.",Visualization of Amyloid β Deposits in the Human Brain with Matrix-assisted Laser Desorption/Ionization Imaging Mass Spectrometry.,https://www.ncbi.nlm.nih.gov/pubmed/30907869,Journal of visualized experiments : JoVE,2019 03 25,"The neuropathology of Alzheimer's disease (AD) is characterized by the accumulation and aggregation of amyloid β (Aβ) peptides into extracellular plaques of the brain. The Aβ peptides, composed of 40 amino acids, are generated from amyloid precursor proteins (APP) by β- and γ-secretases. Aβ is deposited not only in cerebral parenchyma but also in leptomeningeal and cerebral vessel walls, known as cerebral amyloid angiopathy (CAA). While a variety of Aβ peptides were identified, the detailed production and distribution of individual Aβ peptides in pathological tissues of AD and CAA have not been fully addressed. Here, we develop a protocol of matrix-assisted laser desorption/ionization-based imaging mass spectrometry (MALDI-IMS) on human autopsy brain tissues to obtain comprehensive protein mapping. For this purpose, human cortical specimens were obtained from the Brain Bank at the Tokyo Metropolitan Institute of Gerontology. Frozen cryosections are cut and transferred to indium-tin-oxide (ITO)-coated glass slides. Spectra are acquired using the MALDI system with a spatial resolution up to 20 µm. Sinapinic acid (SA) is uniformly deposited on the slide using either an automatic or a manual sprayer. With the current technical advantages of MALDI-IMS, a typical data set of various Aβ species within the same sections of human autopsied brains can be obtained without specific probes. Furthermore, high-resolution (20 µm) imaging of an AD brain and severe CAA sample clearly shows that Aβ1-36 to Aβ1-41 were deposited into leptomeningeal vessels, while Aβ1-42 and Aβ1-43 were deposited in cerebral parenchyma as senile plaque (SP). It is feasible to adopt MALDI-IMS as a standard approach in combination with clinical, genetic, and pathological observations in understanding the pathology of AD, CAA, and other neurological diseases based on the current strategy.","In Vitro Assays to Evaluate the Migration, Invasion, and Proliferation of Immortalized Human First-trimester Trophoblast Cell Lines.",https://www.ncbi.nlm.nih.gov/pubmed/30907868,Journal of visualized experiments : JoVE,2019 03 25,"Cell movement is a critical property of trophoblasts during placental development and early pregnancy. The significance of proper trophoblast migration and invasion is demonstrated by pregnancy disorders such as pre-eclampsia and intrauterine growth restriction, which are associated with inadequate trophoblast invasion of the maternal vasculature. Unfortunately, our understanding of the mechanisms by which the placenta develops from migrating trophoblasts is limited. In vitro analysis of cell migration via the scratch assay is a useful tool in identifying factors that regulate trophoblast migratory capacity. However, this assay alone does not define the cellular changes that can result in altered cell migration. This protocol describes three different in vitro assays that are used collectively to evaluate trophoblast cell movement: the scratch assay, the invasion assay, and the proliferation assay. The protocols described here may also be modified for use in other cell lines to quantify cell movement in response to stimuli. These methods allow investigators to identify individual factors that contribute to the cell movement and provide a thorough examination of potential mechanisms underlying apparent changes in cell migration.",Assembly and Characterization of Biomolecular Memristors Consisting of Ion Channel-doped Lipid Membranes.,https://www.ncbi.nlm.nih.gov/pubmed/30907866,Journal of visualized experiments : JoVE,2019 03 25,"The ability to recreate synaptic functionalities in synthetic circuit elements is essential for neuromorphic computing systems that seek to emulate the cognitive powers of the brain with comparable efficiency and density. To date, silicon-based three-terminal transistors and two-terminal memristors have been widely used in neuromorphic circuits, in large part due to their ability to co-locate information processing and memory. Yet these devices cannot achieve the interconnectivity and complexity of the brain because they are power-hungry, fail to mimic key synaptic functionalities, and suffer from high noise and high switching voltages. To overcome these limitations, we have developed and characterized a biomolecular memristor that mimics the composition, structure, and switching characteristics of biological synapses. Here, we describe the process of assembling and characterizing biomolecular memristors consisting of a 5 nm-thick lipid bilayer formed between lipid-functionalized water droplets in oil and doped with voltage-activated alamethicin peptides. While similar assembly protocols have been used to investigate biophysical properties of droplet-supported lipid membranes and membrane-bound ion channels, this article focuses on key modifications of the droplet interface bilayer method essential for achieving consistent memristor performance. Specifically, we describe the liposome preparation process and the incorporation of alamethicin peptides in lipid bilayer membranes, and the appropriate concentrations of each constituent as well as their impact on the overall response of the memristors. We also detail the characterization process of biomolecular memristors, including measurement and analysis of memristive current-voltage relationships obtained via cyclic voltammetry, as well as short-term plasticity and learning in response to step-wise voltage pulse trains.",Central Macular Thickness in Diabetic Patients: A Sex-based Analysis.,https://www.ncbi.nlm.nih.gov/pubmed/30907864,Optometry and vision science : official publication of the American Academy of Optometry,2019 04 04,"The pathological changes in clinically significant diabetic macular edema lead to greater retinal thickening in men than in women.

Its purpose is to inform the choice of appropriate dose limits and subsequent as low as reasonably achievable requirements, social and economic factors taken into account. The linear no-threshold model assumes that the risk of developing cancer increases proportionately with increasing radiation dose. The linear no-threshold model has historically been applied by extrapolating the risk of cancer at high doses (>1,000 mSv) down to low doses in a linear manner. As the health effects of radiation exposure at low doses remain ambiguous, reducing uncertainties found in cancer risk dose-response models can be achieved through in vitro and animal-based studies.

The International Atomic Energy Agency has operationalized these new guidelines. Subsequently, national/regional radiation protection regulators are reviewing their lens of eye dose limits with an aim of moving towards the proposed new limits, resulting in licensees having to demonstrate compliance. In health care settings, fluoroscopic interventional practices generally have higher lens of eye doses and nuclear medicine settings generally have lower doses. A prospective cohort (n = 19) of nuclear medicine technologists wore dedicated lens of eye dosimeters for a 3 mo period synchronized with their body dosimeter schedules. The lens of eye dosimeters were validated to have a linear response in the anticipated dose ranges. The participants worked in a relatively high-volume nuclear medicine practice, which included general and cardiac, positron emission tomography/computed tomography, radiopharmacy, and cyclotron operations. The annualized dose ranges were 0.0-3.68 mSv (lens of eye) and 0.48-4.72 mSv (whole body). There was a good correlation between lens of eye and body dosimeter readings (R = 0.67). There were no significant differences in lens of eye dose by work type, worker sex, or side on which the dosimeter was worn. The findings should be generalizable to other similar practices, especially in North America, and should be sufficient to demonstrate regulatory compliance in nuclear medicine settings with the proposed new lens of eye dose limits.",MONITORING AND DOSE ASSESSMENT FOR CHILDREN FOLLOWING A RADIATION EMERGENCY-PART II: CALIBRATION FACTORS FOR THYROID MONITORING.,https://www.ncbi.nlm.nih.gov/pubmed/30907781,Health physics,2019 03 25,"Past radiological and nuclear accidents have demonstrated that monitoring a large number of children following a radiological and nuclear emergency can be challenging, in accommodating their needs as well as adapting monitoring protocols and applying age-specific biokinetics to account for various ages and body sizes.

Furthermore, intense hunger states, especially those evoked via AgRP photoactivation, fundamentally altered sequences of behavioral choice; effects dependent on food availibility.

Similar to the psychoanalytic concept of personality organization developed by Kernberg ( 1984 ), personality disorders are assessed not only by categorical diagnoses, but also by measuring impairment of personality functioning. In this study we empirically investigate the convergence between two instruments examining personality functioning, the Structured Clinical Interview for the DSM-5 Alternative Model for Personality Disorders Module I (SCID-AMPD) and the Structured Interview of Personality Organization (STIPO). For this goal, correlations between both the overall scores of the two instruments as well as between the corresponding domain scale scores were examined. In addition, the relationship between interview ratings and clinical criteria quantifying the severity of the disorder (suicide attempts, frequency of psychiatric hospitalization, ICD-10 diagnoses) were analyzed.

Inspired by the AMPD, the LoPF-Q 12-18 was developed to assess Levels of Personality Functioning (LoPF) dimensionally in adolescents from 12 to 18 years old in self-report. The questionnaire shows good scale reliabilities, good construct validity by demonstrating a systematic variation with pathology in line with theory, and a valuable clinical utility. The results suggest that the LoPF-Q 12-18 questionnaire is a clinically useful instrument to assess personality pathology in young people and that the concept of personality functioning is useful in detecting and describing central impairments of PD pathology at an early stage of development.",Hip moment and knee power eccentric utilisation ratios determine lower-extremity stretch-shortening cycle performance.,https://www.ncbi.nlm.nih.gov/pubmed/30907707,Sports biomechanics,2019 03 25,"The eccentric utilisation ratio (EUR) is calculated as the ratio between countermovement jump (CMJ) and squat jump (SJ) heights, and is an indicator of lower-extremity stretch-shortening cycle (SSC) performance in athletes.

Nine NCAA Division I college athletes (age: 21 ± 1 year, height: 1.75 ± 0.15 m, mass: 71 ± 20 kg) performed three SJ and CMJ. During all jumps, kinematic and kinetic data were obtained and used to calculate hip, knee and ankle net joint moments (NJM) and net joint powers (NJP). JH was calculated from pelvis marker data. EUR (CMJ/SJ [unitless]) were calculated for JH, NJM, and NJP. JH-EUR was 1.11 ± 0.70. NJM-EUR were 1.07 ± 0.17, 1.17 ± 0.25, and 1.07 ± 0.18 for the hip, knee and ankle joint, respectively. NJP-EUR were 1.41 ± 0.12, 1.26 ± 0.28 and 1.06 ± 0.11 for the hip, knee and ankle joint, respectively. Regularised regression showed that Hip-NJM-EUR, Knee-NJP-EUR and Ankle-NJM-EUR were able to predict 83% of the variance in JH-EUR, which suggests that the enhancement of lower-extremity SSC performance during CMJ arises from a combination of these parameters.",Death anxiety and psychological distress post-donation in non-directed living kidney donors.,https://www.ncbi.nlm.nih.gov/pubmed/30907706,Death studies,2019 03 25,"The current study sought to assess death anxiety and psychological distress among kidney donors, in comparison to a control population.

However, to interact with the environment safely and to perform a task effectively, a soft robot faces a series of challenges such as dexterous motion, proprioceptive sensing, and robust control of its deformable bodies. To address these issues, this article presents a method for fabrication and dynamic modeling of a novel bidirectional bending soft pneumatic actuator that embeds a curvature proprioceptive sensor. The bidirectional bending deformation was generated by two similar chambers with a sinusoidal shape for reducing the internal dampness during bending deformation. An optical waveguide made from flexible poly (methyl methacrylate) material that is immune to the inlet pressure was embedded into the actuator body to measure its bending angle. A dynamic modeling framework based on step response and parameter fitting was proposed to establish a simple differential equation that can describe the nonlinear behavior of the soft actuator. Hence, a sliding mode controller is designed based on this differential equation and the Taylor expansion. The proposed dynamical model and the sliding mode controller were validated by trajectory tracking experiments. The performance of the bidirectional bending soft actuator, such as the linear output of the curvature sensor in different inflating patterns, the proprioceptive sensitiveness to the external environment, the output force, and large bending range under relatively small pressure, was evaluated by relevant experimental paradigms. Prototypes from the novel design and fabrication process demonstrated the soft actuator's potential applications in industrial grasping and hand rehabilitation.","Self-reported awake bruxism and chronotype profile: a multicenter study on Brazilian, Portuguese and Italian dental students.",https://www.ncbi.nlm.nih.gov/pubmed/30907703,Cranio : the journal of craniomandibular practice,2019 03 29,"To assess the association between self-reported awake bruxism (AB) and the chronotype profile among Brazilian, Portuguese, and Italian dental students.",Prevalence and Identification of Borrelia burgdorferi Sensu Lato Genospecies in Ticks from Northeastern China.,https://www.ncbi.nlm.nih.gov/pubmed/30907702,"Vector borne and zoonotic diseases (Larchmont, N.Y.)",2019 05 02,"Lyme disease is considered as one of important tick-transmitted zoonosis in northeastern China, where the causative agents, the Borrelia burgdorferi sensu lato (s.l.) complex, remain poorly characterized.

However, the length of time a re-created marsh will take to become functionally equivalent to a natural (reference) system, or indeed, whether reference conditions are attainable, is largely unknown. Here, we describe a combined field chronosequence and modelling study of saltmarsh carbon accumulation and provide empirically based predictions of changes in the carbon sequestration rate over time following saltmarsh restoration. Carbon accumulation was initially rapid (average 1.04 t C ha-1 yr-1 during the first 20 years), slowing to a steady rate of around 0.65 t C ha-1 yr-1 thereafter. The resulting increase in C stock gave an estimated total C accumulation of 74 t C ha-1 in the century following restoration. This is approximately the same as our observations of natural marsh C content (69 t C ha-1), suggesting that it takes approximately 100 years for restored saltmarsh to obtain the same carbon stock as natural sites.",Telemedicine in Camp Mode While Screening for Noncommunicable Diseases: A Preliminary Report from India.,https://www.ncbi.nlm.nih.gov/pubmed/30907700,Telemedicine journal and e-health : the official journal of the American Telemedicine Association,2019 03 25,"Noncommunicable diseases (NCDs) are a major cause of disease burden.

Findings from a National Survey of Hematologic Oncologists.,https://www.ncbi.nlm.nih.gov/pubmed/30907686,Journal of palliative medicine,2019 06 10,"
Background:
 Although blood cancers are accompanied by a high level of prognostic uncertainty, little is known about when and how hematologic oncologists discuss prognosis. 
Objectives:
 Characterize reported practices and predictors of prognostic discussions for a cohort of hematologic oncologists. 
Design:
 Cross-sectional mailed survey in 2015. 
Setting/Subjects:
 U.S.-based hematologic oncologists providing clinical care for adult patients with blood cancers. 
Measurements:
 We conducted univariable and multivariable analyses assessing the association of clinician characteristics with reported frequency of initiation of prognostic discussions, type of terminology used, and whether prognosis is readdressed. 
Results:
 We received 349 surveys (response rate = 57.3%). The majority of respondents (60.3%) reported conducting prognostic discussions with ""most"" (>95%) of their patients. More than half (56.8%) preferred general/qualitative rather than specific/numeric terms when discussing prognosis. Although 91.3% reported that they typically first initiate prognostic discussions at diagnosis, 17.7% reported routinely never readdressing prognosis or waiting until death is imminent to revisit the topic. Hematologic oncologists with ≤15 years since medical school graduation (odds ratio [OR] 0.51; confidence interval (95% CI) 0.30-0.88) and those who considered prognostic uncertainty a barrier to quality end-of-life care (OR 0.57; 95% CI 0.35-0.90) had significantly lower odds of discussing prognosis with ""most"" patients. 
Conclusions:
 Although the majority of hematologic oncologists reported discussing prognosis with their patients, most prefer general/qualitative terms. Moreover, even though prognosis evolves during the disease course, nearly one in five reported never readdressing prognosis or only doing so near death. These findings suggest the need for structured interventions to improve prognostic communication for patients with blood cancers.","Rheological Properties, Dissolution Kinetics, and Ocular Pharmacokinetics of Loteprednol Etabonate (Submicron) Ophthalmic Gel 0.38.",https://www.ncbi.nlm.nih.gov/pubmed/30907685,Journal of ocular pharmacology and therapeutics : the official journal of the Association for Ocular Pharmacology and Therapeutics,2019 06 06,"
Purpose:
 To evaluate rheological properties, in vitro dissolution, and in vivo ocular pharmacokinetics of loteprednol etabonate (LE) (submicron) ophthalmic gel 0.38%. 
Methods:
 The viscosity of the LE gel 0.38% formulation was measured with a controlled stress rheometer. Dissolution kinetics were evaluated in a fixed-volume and flow-through assay. Rabbits received a single instillation of LE (submicron) gel 0.38% (both eyes), and concentrations of LE in ocular tissues were determined through 24 h by liquid chromatography with tandem mass spectrometry. Where indicated, comparators included micronized LE gel 0.38%, 0.5% (Lotemax® gel), and 0.75%. 
Results:
 LE (submicron) gel 0.38% exhibited shear-thinning characteristics similar to LE gel 0.5% with nearly identical yield stress. LE (submicron) gel 0.38% released 2.6-fold more LE into the dissolution medium than micronized LE gel 0.5% over 30 s in the fixed-volume dissolution assay, and submicron LE attained higher concentrations of dissolved LE than micronized LE gel 0.38% in the flow-through dissolution assay. In rabbits, the maximal concentration and area-under-the-curve over 24 h for LE in aqueous humor were 2.5- and 1.8-fold higher, respectively, for LE (submicron) gel 0.38% versus micronized LE gel 0.5% (both P < 0.001). Pharmacokinetic parameters were similar for most other tissues. 
Conclusions:
 LE (submicron) gel 0.38% demonstrated similar rheological properties to micronized LE gel 0.5% but faster dissolution, thus providing similar or higher LE concentrations in the aqueous humor, cornea, and iris-ciliary body after ocular dosing in rabbits despite a lowered concentration of drug in the formulation.",Breaking Point: Violence Against Long-Term Care Staff.,https://www.ncbi.nlm.nih.gov/pubmed/30907683,New solutions : a journal of environmental and occupational health policy : NS,2019 04 27,"Direct resident care in long-term care facilities is carried out predominantly by personal support workers and registered practical nurses, the majority of whom are women. They experience physical, verbal, and sexual violence from residents on a regular basis. To explore this widespread problem, fifty-six staff in seven communities in Ontario, Canada, were consulted. They identified such immediate causes of violence as resident fear, confusion, and agitation and such underlying causes as task-driven organization of work, understaffing, inappropriate resident placement, and inadequate time for relational care. They saw violence as symptomatic of an institution that undervalues both its staff and residents. They described how violence affects their own health and well-being-causing injuries, unaddressed emotional trauma, job dissatisfaction, and burnout. They outlined barriers to preventing violence, such as insufficient training and resources, systemic underfunding, lack of recognition of the severity and ubiquity of the phenomenon, and limited public awareness.","The development of spasticity with age in 4,162 children with cerebral palsy: a register-based prospective cohort study.",https://www.ncbi.nlm.nih.gov/pubmed/30907682,Acta orthopaedica,2019 06 13,"Background and purpose - Spasticity is often regarded as a major cause of functional limitation in children with cerebral palsy (CP). We analyzed the spasticity development with age in the gastrosoleus muscle in children with CP. Children and methods - This is a longitudinal cohort study of 4,162 children (57% boys) with CP born in 1990-2015, monitored using standardized follow-up examinations in the Swedish surveillance program for CP. The study is based on 57,953 measurements of spasticity of the gastrosoleus muscle assessed using the Ashworth scale (AS) in participants between 0 and 15 years of age. The spasticity was analyzed in relation to age, sex, and Gross Motor Function Classification System (GMFCS) levels using a linear mixed model. Development of spasticity with age was modeled as a linear spline. Results - The degree of spasticity increased in most children over the first 5 years of life. At 5 years of age, 38% had an AS level of ≥ 2. The spasticity then decreased for 65% of the children during the remaining study period. At 15 years of age only 22% had AS ≥ 2. The level of spasticity and the rate of increase and decrease before and after 5.5 years of age were higher in children at GMFCS IV-V. Interpretation - The degree of spasticity of the gastrosoleus muscle often decreases after 5 years of age, which is important for long-term treatment planning and should be considered in spasticity management.",Guidelines for Experiments Using Antisense Oligonucleotides and Double-Stranded RNAs.,https://www.ncbi.nlm.nih.gov/pubmed/30907681,Nucleic acid therapeutics,2019 06 10,"After decades of research and development, synthetic nucleic acids are beginning to enjoy significant success in the clinic. Approved drugs have increased interest in the field, and many basic research studies have focused on synthetic nucleic acids to control the action of messenger RNA and noncoding RNAs. Unfortunately, experimental designs are often inadequate, resulting in misleading interpretation of data and unconvincing work that wastes resources and does little to advance the field. The goal of this commentary is to outline the problems facing many researchers, especially those new to the use of synthetic oligonucleotides. We describe the minimum control experiments necessary to build a strong case for real effects that are likely due to interactions at the intended molecular target. A common set of standards for preparing and judging experiments should facilitate better interpretation of data and publications that contribute positively to using synthetic nucleic acids as tools and drugs.",Return to work after primary total hip arthroplasty: a nationwide cohort study.,https://www.ncbi.nlm.nih.gov/pubmed/30907679,Acta orthopaedica,2019 06 13,"Background and purpose - While the number of working-age patients undergoing total hip arthroplasty (THA) is increasing, the effect of the surgery on patients' return to work (RTW) is not thoroughly studied. We aimed to identify risk factors of RTW after THA among factors related to demographic variables, general health, health risk behaviors, and socioeconomic status. Patients and methods - We studied 408 employees from the Finnish Public Sector (FPS) cohort (mean age 54 years, 73% women) who underwent THA. Information on demographic and socioeconomic variables, preceding health, and health-risk behaviors was derived from linkage to national health registers and FPS surveys before the operation. The likelihood of return to work was examined using Cox proportional hazard modeling. Results - 94% of the patients returned to work after THA on average after 3 months (10 days to 1 year) of sickness absence. The observed risk factors of successful return to work were: having < 30 sick leave days during the last year (HR 1.8; 95% CI 1.4-2.3); higher occupational position (HR 2.2; CI 1.6-2.9); and BMI < 30 (HR 1.4; CI 1.1-1.7). Age, sex, preceding health status, and health-risk behaviors were not correlated with RTW after the surgery. Interpretation - Most employees return to work after total hip arthroplasty.

The acute change in OS biomarkers due to exercise, known as exercise-induced OS (EIOS), is postulated to be a more appropriate marker of OS compared to spot OS measures. These studies objectives were to investigate EIOS in participants with MetS and compare the associations between EIOS, spot OS measures and MetS severity. Methods: Sixty-three participants with MetS had MetS severity assessed using the MetS Z-score. Participants undertook a cardiorespiratory fitness test ( 
V
 O2peak) to volitional exhaustion (∼8-12 minutes). Plasma OS (total F2-isoprostanes (IsoP), protein carbonyls (PCs)) and antioxidant (glutathione peroxidase (GPx), total antioxidant status (TAS)) biomarkers were measured from samples obtained before and five minutes post-

 O2peak test to exhaustion failed to induce OS in participants with MetS. There were no associations between MetS severity and spot OS or EIOS biomarkers.","Self-assembled nanoparticles of reduction-sensitive poly (lactic-co-glycolic acid)-conjugated chondroitin sulfate A for doxorubicin delivery: preparation, characterization and evaluation.",https://www.ncbi.nlm.nih.gov/pubmed/30907676,Pharmaceutical development and technology,2019 05 16,"In this study, reduction-sensitive self-assembled polymer nanoparticles based on poly (lactic-co-glycolic acid) (PLGA) and chondroitin sulfate A (CSA) were developed and characterized. PLGA was conjugated with CSA via a disulfide linkage (PLGA-ss-CSA). The critical micelle concentration (CMC) of PLGA-ss-CSA conjugate is 3.5 µg/mL. The anticancer drug doxorubicin (DOX) was chosen as a model drug, and was effectively encapsulated into the nanoparticles (PLGA-ss-CSA/DOX) with high loading efficiency of 15.1%. The cumulative release of DOX from reduction-sensitive nanoparticles was only 34.8% over 96 h in phosphate buffered saline (PBS, pH 7.4). However, in the presence of 20 mM glutathione-containing PBS environment, DOX release was notably accelerated and almost complete from the reduction-sensitive nanoparticles up to 96 h. Moreover, efficient intracellular DOX release of PLGA-ss-CSA/DOX nanoparticles was confirmed by CLSM assay in A549 cells. In vitro cytotoxicity study showed that the half inhibitory concentrations of PLGA-ss-CSA/DOX nanoparticles and free DOX against A549 cells were 1.141 and 1.825 µg/mL, respectively. Therefore, PLGA-ss-CSA/DOX nanoparticles enhanced the cytotoxicity of DOX in vitro. These results suggested that PLGA-ss-CSA nanoparticles could be a promising carrier for drug delivery."

In Study 1 we examined the relationship between a mood instability factor in the Eysenck Personality Inventory and impulsivity (i.e., rapid unplanned behavior) in a general population sample of 6,066 adults. The mood instability factor was positively correlated with impulsivity. The remaining factors, largely reflecting trait anxiety, were also positively correlated with impulsivity, although these correlations disappeared when mood instability was included in the same regression model. In Study 2 we factor analyzed the short form of the revised Eysenck Personality Questionnaire to isolate mood instability and trait anxiety factors and explore their associations with risk taking in a general population sample of 394,170 adults 40 to 69 years old. The mood instability factor was positively associated with risk taking, whereas the association for the trait anxiety factor was negative. Taken together, the results suggest that mood instability and trait anxiety are separable components of Eysenckian neuroticism and that mood instability is the main component that is positively associated with trait impulsivity and risk taking.

In 2 studies, participants completed PES items amended to include both deprived-identity-based and grandiose-identity-based rationales for item agreement and various individual-difference measures of constructs related to entitlement, self-evaluation, personality, and interpersonal orientations. The modified PES yielded a grandiose-based (PES-G) and vulnerable-based (PES-V) entitlement scale that showed good psychometric qualities. PES-G and PES-V converged well on core features of psychological entitlement (e.g., antagonistic outcomes) but generally failed to converge on self-evaluation, acquisitive versus defensive forms of entitlement, behavioral inhibition system and behavioral activation system, and interpersonal behavior indicative of claiming and cultivating grandiose versus deprived identities.

Background:
 School gardening interventions typically include cooking and gardening (CG) components; however, few studies have examined associations between CG psychosocial behaviors (attitudes, self-efficacy, and motivation), dietary intake, and obesity parameters. This study assessed the association between changes in CG behaviors with changes in dietary intake and obesity in participants of the LA Sprouts study, an after-school, 12-week, randomized controlled CG intervention conducted in four inner-city elementary schools in Los Angeles. 
Methods:
 Process analysis using data from 290 low-income, primarily Hispanic/Latino third through fifth-grade students who were randomized to either the LA Sprouts intervention (n = 160) or control group (n = 130). Height, weight, waist circumference, dietary intake via questionnaire, and CG behaviors were collected at baseline and postintervention. Linear regressions determined whether changes in CG behaviors predicted changes in dietary intake and obesity outcomes. 
Results:
 There were no differences in changes in CG psychosocial behaviors between intervention and control groups, therefore groups were combined. Participants were 49% male, 87% Hispanic/Latino, and an average age of nine. Increases in cooking behaviors significantly predicted increases in dietary fiber intake (p = 0.004) and increases in vegetable intake (p = 0.03). Increases in gardening behaviors significantly predicted increased intake of dietary fiber (p = 0.02). Changes in CG behaviors were not associated with changes in BMI z-score or waist circumference. 
Conclusions:
 Results from this study suggest that school-based interventions should incorporate CG components, despite their potentially costly and time-intensive nature, as these behaviors may be responsible for improvements in dietary intake of high-risk minority youth.","Acrylamide in human diet, its metabolism, toxicity, inactivation and the associated European Union legal regulations in food industry.",https://www.ncbi.nlm.nih.gov/pubmed/30907623,Critical reviews in food science and nutrition,2019 03 25,"Nowadays acrylamide is known not only as synthetic material used in industry, but also as carcinogenic, cyto- and genotoxic compound which forms during heat-induced process (due to Maillard reaction) mostly in foodstuff such as potato, bakery, plant derivatives products and coffee.

In the article ""Embracing in a Female-Bonded Monkey Species (Theropithecus gelada)"" by Virginia Pallante, Pier Francesco Ferrari, Marco Gamba, and Elisabetta Palagi (Journal of Comparative Psychology, Advance online publication. March 25, 2019. http://dx.doi.org/10.1037/ com0000173), the title incorrectly read ""Embracing in a Female-Bonded Monkey Specie (Theropithecus gelada)"" All versions of this article have been corrected.] In several primate species, including humans, embracing predicts the level of affiliation between subjects. To explore the functional meaning of embracing, we selected Theropithecus gelada as a model species. The basic level of the gelada society is the 1-male unit, and the integrity of the group is maintained by the strong bonds between females. In our study group, we observed 3 different kinds of embracing: the frontal and side embraces involving a face-to-face and chest-to-chest interaction and the posterior embrace that consists in putting the arms around conspecifics' back and posing a cheek on it. We verified that the quality of relationships between subjects predicts the type of embracing. Frontal and side embraces were more frequent between females sharing strong bonds. Posterior embracing was randomly distributed. We found a high level of female embracing among the mothers during the first months of lactation. This may improve female cohesiveness against males, thus reducing the risk of infanticide, which is particularly high in geladas. Embracing seems also to act as an ice-breaker favoring grooming. Female embracing could be an affiliative strategy that has evolved to maintain group integrity and high social cohesion among females, especially mothers.

Yet limited research has examined whether familism moderates the effects of sibling relationship features on alcohol use. The present study examined whether familism enhanced or reduced the effects of sibling intimacy, negativity, and sibling deviance on later alcohol use, also testing whether sibling sex constellation (sisters, brothers, mixed) modified the patterns of influence. We analyzed two waves of data (N = 404) from the California Families Project, a longitudinal study of Mexican-origin youth. Using zero-inflated Poisson models, we examined unique and intersecting prospective influences of age 14 sibling contexts and familism on the likelihood of and degree of engagement in alcohol use at age 16. Results indicated a complex interplay of sibling features, familism values, and alcohol use patterns. Familism moderated the effects of sibling intimacy on later alcohol use patterns. For those with lower familism, increasing intimacy was associated with higher probability of any use, but decreasing degree of use (especially for brother pairs and sister pairs). Among those with higher familism, increasing intimacy predicted reduced probability of any use, but increases in the degree of use (for sister and mixed pairs). More sibling negativity was related to reduced alcohol use probability for brothers, and increased alcohol use in mixed sibling pairs. Sibling deviance was associated with greater age 16 alcohol use. This study highlights cultural considerations for including siblings in substance use prevention programs for Mexican-origin youth.

The decision to drop out of school is thus a dynamic developmental process that can begin with disengagement in elementary school. Yet few studies have examined the multilevel factors that might contribute to children's early disengagement from school. In the present study, we examined associations between household chaos (i.e., disorganization and instability) from birth to age 5 and student (dis)engagement in third grade. We also examined positive parenting in early childhood (6-60 months) and child self-regulatory skills at kindergarten as potential mediators in this pathway. Participants were 1,097 children who participated in the Family Life Project, a longitudinal study of the development of children living in underresourced high poverty rural areas. Study questions were addressed using structural equation models. Results indicated that, even after taking into account a considerable number of covariates, early positive parenting and children's self-regulatory skills were viable process mechanisms through which early household disorganization, but not instability, was linked to student (dis)engagement in third grade. Findings are discussed with respect to the multilevel proximal forces at play in children's risk for early disengagement from school.

There is theoretical and empirical support for both protective and detrimental effects of ERI. This meta-analysis includes 53 effect sizes from 51 studies and 18,545 participants spanning early adolescence to adulthood to synthesize the interaction of ERI and discrimination for adjustment outcomes. Consistent with existing meta-analyses, discrimination was associated with compromised adjustment; further, this effect was buffered by overall ERI particularly for academic and physical health outcomes. Different ERI dimensions and adjustment outcomes revealed important patterns. ERI exploration increased vulnerabilities associated with discrimination, particularly for negative mental health and risky health behaviors. The exacerbating influence of ERI exploration was strongest at age 24, and more recent publications reported weaker exacerbating effects. In contrast, ERI commitment conferred protection. A composite score of ERI exploration and commitment also conferred protection against discrimination. Sample demographics mattered. The buffering effect of ERI commitment was stronger for Latinx (compared with Asian heritage) individuals. The buffering effect of public regard was stronger for Asian heritage (compared with African heritage) individuals. For positive mental health outcomes, a composite score of ERI exploration and commitment had a stronger buffering effect for Latinx (compared with African heritage) individuals. For risky health behaviors, Latinx individuals reported a stronger buffering effect of ERI (compared with African heritage and Asian heritage) individuals. The current meta-analysis identifies gaps in the literature and offers suggestions for future research.

Given cognitive and neurocognitive model-based evidence indicating that, in speeded choice tasks, (a) age-related slowing is associated with higher and less flexible overall evidence thresholds (response caution) and (b) gains in speed and accuracy in relation to base-rate bias require flexible control of choice-specific evidence thresholds (response bias), it was hypothesized that base-rate neglect might increase with age due to compromised flexibility, and so optimality, of response bias. We administered a computer-based perceptual discrimination task to 20 healthy older (63-78 years) and 20 younger (18-28 years) adults where base-rate direction was either variable or constant over trials and so required more or less flexible bias control. Using an evidence accumulation model of response times and accuracy (specifically, the Linear Ballistic Accumulator model; Brown & Heathcote, 2008), age-related slowing was attributable to higher response caution, and gains in speed and accuracy per base-rate bias were attributable to response bias. Both age groups were less biased than required to achieve optimal accuracy, and more so when base-rate direction changed frequently. However, bias was closer to optimal among older than younger participants, especially when base-rate direction was constant. We conclude that older participants performed better than younger participants because of their greater emphasis on accuracy, and that, by making greater absolute and equivalent relative adjustments of evidence thresholds in relation to base-rate bias, flexibility of bias control is at most only slightly compromised with age.

In this article, we apply machine learning techniques to job application form data (including previous job descriptions and stated reasons for changing jobs) to develop interpretable measures of work experience relevance, tenure history, and history of involuntary turnover, history of avoiding bad jobs, and history of approaching better jobs. We empirically examine our model on a longitudinal sample of 16,071 applicants for public school teaching positions, and predict subsequent work outcomes including student evaluations, expert observations of performance, value-added to student test scores, voluntary turnover, and involuntary turnover. We found that work experience relevance and a history of approaching better jobs were linked to positive work outcomes, whereas a history of avoiding bad jobs was associated with negative outcomes. We also quantify the extent to which our model can improve the quality of selection process above the conventional methods of assessing work history, while lowering the risk of adverse impact.

However, the mediators of this relationship remain unclear. The present study examined (a) the concurrent relationship between insomnia symptoms and hazardous cannabis use and (b) examined whether use of protective behavioral strategies (PBS) for cannabis mediated this relationship among college student cannabis users. Participants were 984 (69.9% female) college students who reported consuming cannabis at least once in the past month and completed measures of insomnia, cannabis PBS, and cannabis misuse. Data were analyzed by structural equation modeling for binary and count outcomes. The significance of the mediator was evaluated using bias-corrected bootstrap confidence intervals. Insomnia symptoms were associated with an increase in the odds of hazardous cannabis use and possible cannabis use disorder. Cannabis PBS significantly mediated the relationship between insomnia symptoms and hazardous cannabis use, cannabis use disorder symptoms, and cannabis-related problems. Specifically, higher reports of insomnia symptoms were associated with lower use of cannabis PBS; which in turn was associated with an increase in the odds of hazardous cannabis use and possible cannabis use disorder, as well as a higher report of cannabis-related problems. Implications of these findings on the prevention of cannabis use problems among college students in the United States were discussed.

The robustness and utility of these measures in the CUD literature are somewhat equivocal. The present study was designed to increase measurement sensitivity by capitalizing on (a) individually calibrated stimulus selection based on cue reactivity patterns and (2) eye-tracking based measurement. CUD (n = 42) and non-CUD controls (n = 11) served as subjects. Subjects were first exposed to MJ and neutral pictures while measuring physiological and subjective responses on a trial by trial basis. A single reactivity index was created for each stimulus (L2 vector norm). Subject-unique high-reactivity MJ and low-reactivity neutral stimuli were then used in an eye-tracking task (pro-/antisaccade). The stimulus calibration procedure produced large reactivity differences between high/MJ and low/neutral stimuli (p < .001, effect size >7). CUD subjects made more overall antisaccade errors than controls (inhibitory control, p < .02, effect size >1), and CUD subjects (but not controls) made more errors on MJ trials versus neutral trials (attentional bias, p < .002, effect size >1). Within CUD subjects, L2 vector norm scores were associated with antisaccade errors (p < .04), and antisaccade errors were correlated with the Perceived Stress Scale (p < .03) and marginally with CUD severity (p < .07). Because of precise understanding of the neural circuitry governing antisaccades (a marker in several neuro/psychiatric disorders), eye movement-based measures combined with individually determined stimuli may provide an efficient and robust marker in CUD research.

It causes significant hazardous effects to the food- and animal-production industries. We found a bacterial strain, 3J2MO, that degraded AFB1 well, and here we tested and characterized its AFB1-degradation ability. The strain degraded about 93.82% of the AFB1 after incubation for 48 h in Luria-Bertani (LB) medium at 37 °C with a final concentration of 100 ppb and an inoculation quantity of 1 × 107 cfu/mL. High-performance liquid chromatography-fluorescence detection (HPLC-FLD) was used to determine AFB1 amounts. The maximum degradation rates were 89.23% at pH 8.5; 55.78% at an inoculation quantity of 1 × 108 cfu/mL; and 71.50 and 71.21% at 34 and 37 °C, respectively. Treatment with sucrose and soluble starch as carbon sources and beef extract and ammonium acetate as nitrogen sources stimulated the degradation rate. Mg2+ and Ca2+ ions were activators for AFB1 degradation; however, Mn2+, Fe3+, Zn2+, and Cu2+ were strong inhibitors.

Efflux pumps and transport proteins play an important role in MDR. Compounds displaying inhibitory activity toward these proteins are prospective for adjuvant treatment of such conditions. Natural low-cost and nontoxic flavonoids, thanks to their vast structural diversity, offer a great pool of lead structures with broad possibility of chemical derivatizations. Various flavonoids were found to reverse both antineoplastic and bacterial multidrug resistance by inhibiting Adenosine triphosphate Binding Cassette (ABC)-transporters (human P-glycoprotein, multidrug resistance-associated protein MRP-1, breast cancer resistance protein, and bacterial ABC transporters), as well as other bacterial drug efflux pumps: major facilitator superfamily (MFS), multidrug and toxic compound extrusion (MATE), small multidrug resistance (SMR) and resistance-nodulation-cell-division (RND) transporters, and glucose transporters.

The extraction of REEs from residues often generate acidified leachates that require highly selective separation methods to recover the REEs from other major soluble ions in the leachates. Here, we studied two liquid membrane processes (liquid emulsion membranes, LEM, and supported liquid membranes, SLM) and compared them to standard solvent extraction techniques for selective recovery and concentration of REEs from a leachate of coal fly ash. All separation methods involved an organic solution of di(2-ethylhexyl)phosphoric acid dissolved in kerosene or mineral oil and an acid strippant solution of 5 M nitric acid for the liquid-based separations. The LEM configuration, which separated REEs by immersing an acid-in-oil emulsion in the ash leachate, resulted in similar recovery percentages of individual REEs as the conventional solvent extraction approach. The recovery of REEs in the SLM configuration, which involved the impregnation of the solvent in a hydrophobic membrane, was slower than the LEM process. However, the SLM process was notably more selective for the heavy (and higher value) REEs, while the conventional extraction and LEM processes were more selective for the light REEs. A flux-based model of the extraction processes suggested that recovery rates were limited by REE affinity for the solvent chelator in the SLM, while the rates of REEs separation via LEM were limited by diffusive mass transfer across the liquid membrane. Altogether, these results help to identify specific steps in the recovery process that future work should target in the development of scalable liquid membrane separations for REE recovery.",Advancing Computational Toxicology in the Big Data Era by Artificial Intelligence: Data-Driven and Mechanism-Driven Modeling for Chemical Toxicity.,https://www.ncbi.nlm.nih.gov/pubmed/30907586,Chemical research in toxicology,2019 04 15,"In 2016, the Frank R. Lautenberg Chemical Safety for the 21st Century Act became the first US legislation to advance chemical safety evaluations by utilizing novel testing approaches that reduce the testing of vertebrate animals. Central to this mission is the advancement of computational toxicology and artificial intelligence approaches to implementing innovative testing methods. In the current big data era, the terms volume (amount of data), velocity (growth of data), and variety (the diversity of sources) have been used to characterize the currently available chemical, in vitro, and in vivo data for toxicity modeling purposes. Furthermore, as suggested by various scientists, the variability (internal consistency or lack thereof) of publicly available data pools, such as PubChem, also presents significant computational challenges. The development of novel artificial intelligence approaches based on public massive toxicity data is urgently needed to generate new predictive models for chemical toxicity evaluations and make the developed models applicable as alternatives for evaluating untested compounds. In this procedure, traditional approaches (e.g., QSAR) purely based on chemical structures have been replaced by newly designed data-driven and mechanism-driven modeling. The resulting models realize the concept of adverse outcome pathway (AOP), which can not only directly evaluate toxicity potentials of new compounds, but also illustrate relevant toxicity mechanisms. The recent advancement of computational toxicology in the big data era has paved the road to future toxicity testing, which will significantly impact on the public health.",Reductive Binding and Ligand-Based Redox Transformations of Nitrosobenzene at a Dinickel(II) Core.,https://www.ncbi.nlm.nih.gov/pubmed/30907585,Inorganic chemistry,2019 05 01,"The metal-mediated activation of PhNO represents an important starting point for understanding the reactivity patterns of nitrosoarenes in biological systems and catalysis. Here we report that the pyrazole-based dinickel(II) dihydride complex [KL(NiH)2] (1) reacts with PhNO to eliminate dihydrogen concomitant with binding of the doubly reduced substrate in μ-κ(O):κ(N) mode in the bimetallic pocket of [KLNi2(PhNO)] (2). The addition of [2,2,2]cryptand leads to the ionic complex [K(crypt)][LNi2(PhNO)] (3). Structural and spectroscopic analyses evidence that interaction with the Lewis acidic K+ in 2 causes significant elongation and weakening of the substrate's N-O bond [ dN-O = 1.487(12) Å in 2 vs 1.374(4) Å in 3]. Complex 2 (or 3) reacts with [FeCp*2][PF6] to give LNi2(PhNO) (4), which is shown by electron paramagnetic resonance and IR spectroscopies and density functional theory calculations to feature two low-spin d8 nickel(II) ions and a bridging (PhNO)•- radical anion ligand, with the out-of-plane π*(NO) being the singly occupied molecular orbital. Cyclic voltammetry and UV-vis spectroelectrochemical experiments show that 4 and the anion of 3 can be reversibly interconverted at very low potential ( E1/2 = -1.53 V vs Fc/Fc+). Protonation of 2 leads to the N-phenylhydroxylamine complex [LNi2(ONHPh)] (5) with a long N-O bond of 1.464(2) Å, and titration studies suggest a p Ka of around 23-25 in tetrahydrofuran. This allows one to derive a bond dissociation energy of 62-65 kcal mol-1 for the N-H bond of 5. Accordingly, 5 readily reacts with the phenoxy radical 2,4,6- tBu3C6H2O• to yield 4. This work demonstrates the reductive binding of PhNO without prior formation of unstable nickel(I) species and the redox noninnocence of the PhNO ligand in the less common μ-κ(O):κ(N) bridging mode. Thermodynamic data for H-atom-abstraction chemistry at the activated PhNO may be valuable for understanding the reactivity patterns of the transient but biologically relevant nitroxyl (HNO) ligand.","Spectroscopic and Quantum Chemical Investigation of Benzene-1,2-dithiolate-Coordinated Diiron Complexes with Relevance to Dinitrogen Activation.",https://www.ncbi.nlm.nih.gov/pubmed/30907584,Inorganic chemistry,2019 04 24,"In this work, a benzene-1,2-dithiolate (bdt) pentamethylcyclopentadienyl di-iron complex [Cp*Fe(μ-η2:η4-bdt)FeCp*] and its [Cp*Fe(bdt)(X)FeCp*] analogues (where X = N2H2, N2H3-, H-, NH2-, NHCH3-, or NO+) were investigated through spectroscopic and computational studies. These complexes are of relevance as model systems for dinitrogen activation in nitrogenase and share with its active site the presence of iron, sulfur ligands, and a very flexible electronic structure. On the basis of a combination of X-ray emission spectroscopy (XES), X-ray crystallography, Mössbauer, NMR, and EPR spectroscopy, the geometric and electronic structure of the series has been experimentally elucidated. All iron atoms were found to be in a local low-spin configuration. When no additional X ligand is bound, the bdt ligand is tilted and features a stabilizing π-interaction with one of the iron atoms. The number of lone-pair orbitals provided by the nitrogen-containing species is crucial to the overall electronic structure. When only one lone-pair is present and the iron atoms are bridged by one atom, a three-center bond occurs, and a direct Fe-Fe bond is absent. If the bridging atom provides two lone-pairs, then an Fe-Fe bond is formed. A recurring theme for all ligands is σ-donation into the unoccupied eg manifolds of both iron atoms and back-donation from the t2g manifolds into the ligand π* orbitals. The latter results in a weakening of the double bond of the bound ligand, and in the case of NO+, it results in a weakening of all bonds that comprise triple bond. The electron-rich thiolates further amplify this effect and can also serve as bases for proton binding. While the above observations have been made for the studied di-iron complexes, they may be of relevance for the active site in nitrogenase, where a similar N2 binding mode may occur allowing for the simultaneous weakening of the N2 σ bond and π bonds.",Ag-Catalyzed Chemoselective Decarboxylative Mono- and gem-Difluorination of Malonic Acid Derivatives.,https://www.ncbi.nlm.nih.gov/pubmed/30907583,Journal of the American Chemical Society,2019 04 10,"Malonic acid derivatives have been successfully applied in a Ag-catalyzed decarboxylative fluorination reaction, providing an unprecedented route to either gem-difluoroalkanes or α-fluorocarboxylic acids by the judicious selection of base and solvent.

However, sensitivity of DESI-MSI for nonpolar compounds is restricted by low ionization efficiency and strong ion suppression. In this study, a compact postphotoionization assembly combined with DESI (DESI/PI) was developed for imaging polar and nonpolar molecules in tissue sections by switching off/on a portable krypton lamp. Compared with DESI, higher signal intensities of nonpolar compounds could be detected with DESI/PI. To further increase the ionization efficiency and transport of charged ions of DESI/PI, the desorption solvent composition and gas flow in the ionization tube were optimized. In mouse brain tissue, more than 2 orders of magnitude higher signal intensities for certain neutral biomolecules like creatine, cholesterol, and GalCer lipids were obtained by DESI/PI in the positive ion mode, compared with that of DESI. In the negative ion mode, ion yields of DESI/PI for glutamine and some lipids (HexCer, PE, and PE-O) were also increased by several-fold. Moreover, nonpolar constituents in plant tissue, such as catechins in leaf shoots of tea, could also be visualized by DESI/PI. Our results indicate that DESI/PI can expand the application field of DESI to nonpolar molecules, which is important for comprehensive imaging of biomolecules in biological tissues with moderate spatial resolution at ambient conditions.",In Situ Formed Li-B-H Complex with High Li-Ion Conductivity as a Potential Solid Electrolyte for Li Batteries.,https://www.ncbi.nlm.nih.gov/pubmed/30907580,ACS applied materials & interfaces,2019 04 24,"Li-B-H complexes facilely prepared via partial dehydrogenation of LiBH4 are presented in this study as solid electrolytes for Li batteries.

Parylene N is used as the carbon source. The surface molecule layer of parylene N is cross-linked by argon plasma bombardment. Under high-temperature annealing, the cross-linking layer of parylene N is graphitized into nanocrystalline graphene, which is a process that transforms organic to inorganic and insulation to conduction, while the parylene N molecules below the cross-linking layer decompose and vaporize at high temperature. Using this technique, the direct growth of a graphene film in a large area and with good uniformity is achieved. The thickness of the graphene is determined by the thickness of the cross-linking layer. Patterned graphene films can be obtained directly by controlling the patterns of the cross-linking region (lithography-free patterning). Graphene-silicon Schottky junction photodetectors are fabricated using the as-grown graphene. The Schottky junction shows good performance.

To understand the environmental behaviors of heavy metals and assess their bioavailability in contaminated soils, it is important to investigate the sequestration mechanisms of heavy metals by iron oxides. The traditional methods, including adsorption modeling and chemical extraction fractionation, have obvious limitations and provide little information on the sequestration mechanisms of heavy metal by iron oxides at the molecular level. The application of synchrotron-based techniques in environmental soil science has greatly enhanced the molecular-level understanding of the immobilization mechanisms of heavy metals by iron oxides under various environmental conditions. Here, we reviewed the development of synchrotron-based techniques and summarized the molecular sequestration mechanisms of heavy metals by iron oxides in model and real soil systems under various environmental factors.

Under the condition of freeze-thaw, soil water was transported and soil structure was dama-ged. Soil porosity, bulk density, shear strength, aggregate stability and organic matter were all changed. The change tendency and amplitude were related to soil texture and the degree of freeze-thaw. The occurrence and process of soil wind erosion and water erosion were influenced by the condition of freeze-thaw. Soil erodibility and erosion intensity increased as a result of the changes of soil physical and chemical properties. At present, the research on freeze-thaw mainly based on indoor simulation, which was quite different from the actual freeze-thaw process in the field.

Here, we revisit the question, and discuss the relationship between sustainability science and sustainable development research, the scientific paradigm and the core research questions of sustainability science. Our review of the recent advances in this field reveals contrasting trends for the world versus China. On the one hand, the world is witnessing sustainability science maturing with global momentum to systematically advance sustainability research and education. On the other hand, China greatly lags behind developed countries and South Africa, albeit the great deal of new passion and desire for sustainable development. To promote the science and practice of sustainability in China, we propose a trinity strategy: 1) bringing in from the global community to guide Chinese practices in sustainable development; 2) reaching out to the global community to share Chinese wisdom of sustainable development; and 3) integrating traditional Chinese philosophy with western science to lead the development of sustainability science.",[Research progress on the effects of atmospheric nitrogen dioxide on plant growth and metabo-lism].,https://www.ncbi.nlm.nih.gov/pubmed/30907555,Ying yong sheng tai xue bao = The journal of applied ecology,2019 03 25,"Nitrogen dioxide (NO2) is one type of the atmospheric nitrogen oxides, which is the main component of atmospheric aerosol particles.

At the habitat level, dissolved oxygen (DO), conductivity (COND), turbidity (TURB), NH3-N, pond-interior vegetation cover (VEGinterior), emergent vegetation cover (EMER), pond-edge vegetation cover (VEGedge), benthic fauna predators (PRE), and pond area (AREA) were selected as habitat variables. At the landscape level, total area of ponds (AP), distance to the nearest road (DR), total area of farmlands (AF), total area of woodlands (AW), Shannon&rsquo;s diversity index (SHDI), and contagion index (CONTAG) were selected as explanatory variables, calculated within a buffer of 250, 500, 1000 and 2000 m around the centroid of each pond. The results showed that the distribution of Bufo gargarizans was mainly related to the PRE and landscape variables within the larger radius buffer zone (AW2000, DR2000, SHDI1000, CONTAG1000). The distribution of Pelophylax nigromaculata was closely related to the EMER and landscape variables within the smaller radius buffer zone (SHDI500). VEGinterior and PRE were the key factors determining the distribution of Pelophylax plancyi. Landscape variables (AF2000, SHDI2000) within the larger buffer radius were the most significant influencing factors on Fejervarya multistriata. For all amphibian species, the EMER and SHDI500 were variables that should be considered.

The results indicated that the drought risk of rice in Sichuan Basin was higher. The medium-risk areas in terms of the two planting methods were both the most widely distributed areas. The spatial-distribution characteristics of drought risk for the two kinds of rice were generally the same which was high in the middle and east of the basin, low in the southwest of the basin, and decreased from east to west and from the center to the surroundings. For the two planting methods, the greatest difference of rice drought risk appeared at the sowing-jointing stage. The drought risk of the direct-sowing rice at the sowing-jointing stage was significantly lower, and the distribution range was smaller than that of the transplanting rice.

The cha-racteristics of amino sugars accumulation in the rhizosphere and non-rhizosphere soils at rice tillering stage were analyzed. Results showed that the contents of soil organic carbon, total amino sugars and three amino monosaccharides (muramic acid, glucosamine and galactosamine) with long-term application of organic materials (rice residue or manure) were significantly higher compared with CK and NPK. The inconsistent accumulation trends of the three amino monosaccharides under different fertilization treatments indicated that different responses of microbial groups to various fertilization treatments. The content of total amino sugars was not significantly different between the rhizosphere soil and the non-rhizosphere soil, probably because the agricultural operations such as plowing could homogenize paddy soils. The contribution of amino sugar derived carbon to soil organic carbon ranged from 24.0 to 28.3 mg·g-1, which was highest in NPKS, and lowest in HOM and CK. The ratio of fungal to bacterial residues (fungal glucosamine/muramic acid) ranged from 24.4 to 36.6, indicating that fungi dominated the degradation and transformation of organic matter in all the soils. Compared with that under NPK and CK, the participation of organic matter transformation from fungi under NPKS treatment was increased, whereas the bacteria involved in organic matter transformation under HOM treatment was enhanced.",[Evolutionary characteristics of soil organic carbon storage in soil plough layer under a cropland reclamation process in desert oasis].,https://www.ncbi.nlm.nih.gov/pubmed/30907539,Ying yong sheng tai xue bao = The journal of applied ecology,2019 03 25,"The reclamation time was examined by combining field investigation and remote sensing image analysis in the Linze desert oasis area in the middle of the Hexi Corridor.

The SOCD of cropland (0-20 cm) varied from 2.41 to 32.97 t·hm-2, with an average of 17.22 t·hm-2. The ave-rage SOCD of cropland in saline-alkali land, Gobi and sandy land background was 19.36, 16.10, and 15.93 t·hm-2, respectively. The SOCD under three different reclamation conditions showed an increasing trend after cultivation. The cropland in sandy land and the Gobi background slowly increased after 20 years reclamation. The cropland in saline-alkali background showed a slowdown after 25 years reclamation. The SOC sequestration rates of the cropland under sandy land, Gobi and saline-alkali land background were 0.424, 0.485 and 0.811 t·hm-2·a-1, respectively. The SOCD were positively correlated with total nitrogen, total phosphorus, available nitrogen, and available phosphorus content, but had no significant correlation with available potassium and soil pH. In conclusion, the SOC sequestration rate in the saline-alkali land background was significantly higher than that in Gobi and sandy land background. However, SOCD were at a relatively low level after 30 years reclamation. Therefore, cropland management needs to be carried out for different reclamation backgrounds to improve land use efficiency and productivity in desert oasis.",[Phosphate solubilizing characteristics of Talaromyces aurantiacus and its growthpromoting effect on Phyllostachys edulis seedlings].,https://www.ncbi.nlm.nih.gov/pubmed/30907538,Ying yong sheng tai xue bao = The journal of applied ecology,2019 03 25,"To investigate phosphate-solubilizing characteristics and plant growth-promoting effect of Talaromyces aurantiacus (JXBR04) from Phyllostachys edulis rhizosphere soil, the influence of culture time, carbon sources, nitrogen sources, initial pH, liquid filling volume, and salt ions on phosphate solubilizing ability of strain JXBR04 were examined. The capability to solubilize different types of mineral phosphate was detected using a liquid fermentation method. A pot experiment was conducted to evaluate the effects of strain JXBR04 in promoting the growth of Ph. edulis seedlings. The results showed that strain JXBR04 displayed the highest phosphate-dissolving capacity when the cultivation period was 7 days, the initial pH reached 3.5, the volume of liquid was 1/5 or 2/5, and the NaCl concentration was 0 or 1.0 g·L-1.

The results showed that the exponents of the scaling between total leaf mass and stem mass on twigs significantly decreased with increasing altitude for all the five bamboo species. The common scaling exponents of total leaf mass vs. stem mass for P. edulis, I. tessellatus and O. oedogonatum were 0.94, 0.85 and 0.84, respectively.

The seabuckthorn in the Pisha sandstone area was suitable for planting on slope bottom or mid-slope with a soil moisture of about 8%. Mid-slope with a slope of 30&deg;-35&deg; was recommended. The root-shoot ratio of seabuckthorn decreased with increasing soil moisture. It increased at first and then decreased with increasing slope and slope position.

Using the continuously monitored data of soil moisture in root zone during growing season from 2015 to 2016 and daily precipitation from 2000 to 2016 in a fixed dune at the southern edge of Gurbantunggut Desert, we analyzed soil moisture dynamics and probability density function of soil moisture on slopes in growing season and discussed the sensitivity of parameters of the stochastic model and its application feasibility. The results showed that the seasonal distribution of precipitation was irregular. The total number of annual precipitation was mainly derived from the precipitation of &gt;10 mm. The precipitation frequency and interval were dominated by &lt;5 mm and &lt;10 d, respectively. The precipitation in the eastern slope was slightly larger than that in the western slope. The interannual variability of soil moisture in the eastern and western slopes in the growing season was basically consistent with the rainfall distribution. The soil moisture in the root zone in the western slope was slightly lower than that in the eas-tern slope, and the soil water content in different slope positions followed a normal distribution. The curve characteristics of the soil moisture probability density function (the curve peak value, the position of the peak, the confidence interval of 95%) in the root zone in the different slopes in growing season simulated by the hillslope-scale model were consistent with observed values, with the consistency measure (CM) being higher than 0.5. Such a result indicated that the hillslope-scale stochastic model could be used for simulating the soil moisture probability density function in diffe-rent slope positions in the study area, with a good applicability. This model could provide theoretical basis and scientific methods for vegetation survival or restoration and the implementation of ecological construction project of desertification control in arid sandy area.","[Effects of vegetation restoration on nutrient and microbial properties of soil aggregates with different particle sizes in the loess hilly regions of Ningxia, Northwest China].",https://www.ncbi.nlm.nih.gov/pubmed/30907534,Ying yong sheng tai xue bao = The journal of applied ecology,2019 03 25,"We explored the effects of vegetation restoration on the soil nutrients and microbial pro-perties of soil aggregates with different particle size by comparing soils in a natural grassland which had been restored for nearly 30 years and in cropland in the loess hilly regions of Ningxia. We analyzed the soil organic carbon (SOC), total nitrogen (TN), microbial biomass carbon (MBC), microbial biomass nitrogen (MBN), soil basal respiration (CO2-C) and respiratory quotient (qCO2) of different particle size soil aggregates collected from cropland and natural grassland. The results showed that soil aggregates of natural grassland had more micro-aggregates (particle size &lt;0.25 mm), higher nutrient concentrations (SOC, TN and available K) and C/N than that of cropland. The highest concentrations of SOC and TN in 1-2 mm aggregates and higher C/N in natural grassland and cropland suggested that vegetation restoration could improve the capacity of soil aggregates to reduce nutrient loss and accumulate organic matter, with the highest nutrient accumulation in 1-2 mm aggregates. Microbial biomass (MBC, MBN) and CO2-C in natural grassland were higher than in cropland, but the qCO2 was significantly lower, suggesting that vegetation restoration could effectively improve soil microbial biomass and activity, and make soil habitats more stable. The magnitude of responses of the microbial characteristics of different particle aggregates to vegetation restoration varied due to the differences in nutrient characteristics. The MBC of 1-2 mm aggregates, the MBN of &lt;0.25 mm, 0.25-1 mm and 1-2 mm aggregates, the microbial activity of 1-2 mm and &gt;5 mm aggregates were more sensitive than the rest of the particle aggregates of vegetation restoration.

To examine the interaction between biotic and abiotic in lightly degraded and enclosing grasslands is helpful for a clear understanding of the structure and function of grassland ecosystem. In this study, soil microbial community and soil stoichiometric characteristics in lightly degraded and 10-year enclosing alpine meadows were studied by high-throughput sequencing and Biolog-Eco methods. The results showed that compared with lightly degraded grassland, the concentration of soil NH4+-N in the enclosing grassland increased significantly, while total K (TK) dramatically decreased. There was no obvious variation in soil total organic carbon (TOC), total N (TN), total P (TP), NO3--N, available P (AP), available K (AK), microbial biomass C (MBC) and microbial biomass N (MBN). The soil microbial biomass C/N was significantly enhanced. The carbon metabolic capabilities of soil microbes in different soil layers of alpine mea-dow were obviously increased with the prolonged incubation time, but there was no significant difference between lightly degraded and enclosed meadows. The OTUs of soil bacteria was significantly higher than that of fungi in alpine meadow. The microbial similarity between lightly degraded and fencing grasslands was 27.0%-32.7%. Enclosing significantly increased the fungal relative richness of Ascomycota, Zygomycetes and Chytridiomycota, while simultaneously decreased the rela-tive abundance of Basidiomycetes. Compared with lightly degraded meadow, the bacterial relative richness of Acidobacteria significantly decreased in enclosing meadow. The community composition of soil fungi and bacteria greatly varied among different soil layers. There was significant difference of fungal community composition in the upper soils between lightly degraded and enclosed grassland. The soil bacterial community diversity was greatly affected by soil TN and AK, while the fungal community diversity was significantly affected by plant aboveground biomass. Soil AK produced great influence on soil microbial carbon source utilization capacity. Generally, long-term grazing exclosure had no significant effects on soil nutrients and soil microbial community diversity of lightly degraded grassland and thus would waste the pasture resources, whereas appropriate grazing could maintain the sustainable utilization of grassland.","[Effects of nitrogen addition on the structure of rhizosphere microbial community in Pinus tabuliformis plantations on Loess Plateau, China].",https://www.ncbi.nlm.nih.gov/pubmed/30907532,Ying yong sheng tai xue bao = The journal of applied ecology,2019 03 25,"Atmospheric nitrogen deposition in China displays a pronounced southeast-northwest gradient, with a range of ～35 kg&middot;hm-2&middot;a-1 in southern and central China and ～7.55 kg&middot;hm-2&middot;a-1 in the northwest.

Little is known about how nitrogen deposition impacts the soil microbial communities in plantations in this region. In order to investigate the responses of diversity and structure of soil microbial community in Pinus tabuliformis plantations to nitrogen addition on Loess Plateau, China, we used high-throughput sequencing of 16S ribosomal RNA genes of bacteria and ITS genes of fungi to investigate the effects of nitrogen addition (200 kg N&middot;hm-2&middot;a-1) on the bacterial and fungal community over a 40-year chronosequence of coniferous P. tabuliformis plantation forests. After nitrogen addition, the Shannon diversity of both bacteria and fungi significantly increased in the 25-year-old stand, while the abundance-based coverage estimator of bacteria increased significantly in the 40-year-old stand. Nitrogen addition enhanced the relative abundance of Bacteroidetes in the 40-year-old stand and that of Acidobacteria/Zygomycota in the 25-year-old stand. In contrast, the relative abundance of Thaumarchaeota was reduced by nitrogen addition in the 40-year old stand. The effects of nitrogen addition were stronger on bacterial than on fungal community structure as indicated by the results from non-metric multidimensional scaling analysis. Moreover, the effects of nitrogen addition were stronger in the 25-year-old stand than in the 40-year-old stand. These results indicated that the effects of nitrogen addition on microbial community structure diminished over time in temperate forests on Loess Plateau, China. The stronger effects of nitrogen addition was found on the community structure of bacteria than that of fungi, and on the microbial community structure in the 25-year-old stand than in the 40-year-old stand. Our findings suggested that forest ecosystem at a certain stage (～40-year old) would be less sensitive to disturbance such as nitrogen addition than young forests."

Then, we proposed the focus of future research on fluorine-contaminated soil remediation. The aim of this review was providing the reference for the remediation of fluoride-contaminated soil. There are five forms of fluorine in soils, with the proportion of residual fluorine being over 90%. The reactions of fluorine in the soil solution mainly include precipitation-dissolution, complexation-dissociation, and adsorption-desorption. At present, the remediation technology of fluorine contaminated soil mainly focused on chemo-immobilization, chemical leaching, electrokinetic remediation, and phytoremediation.

Based on the production capacity of China's key industries contributing to fluorine emission, we estimated the fluorine emissions of key industries and built a fluorine emission list in China. Based on data integration and fusion, the soil fluorine background value, fluorine geochemical distribution and soil fluorine concentration distribution in China were analyzed. Then, the causes and control of fluorine pollution in typical areas were analyzed. The results showed that productions of steel, phosphorus fertilizers and electrolytic aluminum were the key industries for fluorine emissions in China. The highest fluorine emission was from the application of phosphorus fertilizers. Due to the huge area of P application, its contribution to soil fluorine concentration was negligible. Electrolytic aluminum production resulted in a high intensity of fluorine emission. A high amount of fluorine was discharged with steel industry production, with low emission intensity. In most parts of China, the soil fluorine background value is low and the environmental capacity is large. In some areas of China, however, fluorine pollution is serious, mainly due to industrial fluorine emissions and high background values of fluorine in soil.

The aim of this study is to investigate the underlying mechanisms by which Sal B regulates osteogenesis and adipogenesis. We used MC3T3-E1 and 3T3-L1 as the study model to explore the changes of cell differentiation induced by Sal B. The results indicated that Sal B at different concentrations had no obvious toxicity effects on cell proliferation during differentiation. Furthermore, Sal B facilitated osteogenesis but inhibited adipogenesis by increasing the expression of transcriptional co-activator with PDZ-binding motif (TAZ). Accordingly, TAZ knock-down offset the effects of Sal B on cell differentiation into osteoblasts or adipocytes. Notably, the Sal B induced up-expression of TAZ was blocked by U0126 (the MEK-ERK inhibitor), rather than LY294002 (the PI3K-Akt inhibitor). Moreover, Sal B increased the p-ERK/ERK ratio to regulate the TAZ expression as well as the cell differentiation. In summary, this study suggests for the first time that Sal B targets TAZ to facilitate osteogenesis and reduce adipogenesis by activating MEK-ERK signalling pathway, which provides evidence for Sal B to be used as a potential therapeutic agent for the management of bone diseases."

To investigate the associations between biomarkers and TRV elevation, we examined the relationship between TRV and hemolytic, inflammatory, and cardiac biomarkers, stratified by disease-modifying treatments and SCD genotype. In total, 294 participants with SCD (mean age, 11.0 ± 3.7 years) and 49 hereditary spherocytosis (HS; mean age, 22.9 ± 19.75 years) were included for comparison and enrolled. TRV was elevated in 30.7% of children with SCD overall: 18.8% in HbSC/HbSβ+ -thalassemia, 28.9% in untreated HbSS/HbSβ0 -thalassemia, 34.2% in HbSS/HbSβ0 -thalassemia hydroxyurea-treated, and 57% in HbSS/HbSβ0 -thalassemia chronic transfusion treated. TRV was elevated in 10.7% and 27.8% in HS children and adults, respectively. In children with SCD, elevated TRV was correlated with hemoglobin (odds ratio [OR] = 0.78, P = 0.004), lactate dehydrogenase (LDH; OR = 2.52, P = 0.005), and N-terminal pro-brain natriuretic peptide (NT-pro BNP; OR = 1.003, P = 0.004). In multivariable logistic regression, adjusting for genotype, sex, hemolytic index, and treatment, hemoglobin concentration remained the only significant variable associated with elevated TRV in untreated HbSS/HbSβ0 -thalassemia participants. TRV was not associated with inflammatory markers, other markers of hemolysis, or NT-pro BNP in untreated HbSS/HbSβ0 -thalassemia. Neither hemoglobin nor LDH was associated with TRV in HbSC/HbSβ+ -thalassemia. These results suggest that elevated TRV is influenced by the degree of anemia, possibly reflecting sickling as part of the disease pathophysiology.

Tumour microenvironment comprises not only stromal cells, mainly cancer-associated fibroblasts, but also immune cells of both the innate and adaptive system (tumour-associated macrophages, neutrophils, natural killer cells, and T and B lymphocytes), and endothelial cells. This results in an intricate web of mutual communications regulated by an extensively remodelled extracellular matrix, where the tumour cells are centrally engaged. In this regard, cholangiocarcinoma, in particular the intrahepatic variant, has become the focus of mounting interest in the last years, largely because of the lack of effective therapies despite its rising incidence and high mortality rates worldwide. On the other hand, recent studies in pancreatic cancer, which similarly to cholangiocarcinoma, is highly desmoplastic, have argued against a tumour-promoting function of the tumour microenvironment. In this review, we will discuss recent developments concerning the role of each cellular population and their multifaceted interplay with the malignant biliary epithelial counterpart.

SMVs from 65 patients with OSCC, 21 patients with oral ulcer (OU), and 42 healthy donors were purified, quantified and analysed for their correlations with the clinicopathologic features and prognosis of OSCC patients. The results showed that the level of SMVs was significantly elevated in patients with OSCC compared to healthy donors and OU patients. Meanwhile, the level of SMVs showed close correlations with the lymph node status, and the clinical stage of OSCC patients. Additionally, the ratio of apoptotic to non-apoptotic SMVs was significantly decreased in OSCC patients with higher pathological grade. Consistently, poorer overall survival was observed in patients with lower ratio of apoptotic to non-apoptotic SMVs. In conclusion, the elevated level of SMVs is associated with clinicopathologic features and decreased survival in patients with OSCC, suggesting that SMVs are a potential biomarker and/or regulator of the malignant progression of OSCC.",Using a feeding tube to intubate and ventilate a 650 gram preterm neonate.,https://www.ncbi.nlm.nih.gov/pubmed/30907489,Paediatric anaesthesia,2019 03 25,"A 28 week old male patient born of a normal vaginal delivery in the hospital presented on the second day of life with failure to feed, vomiting and abdominal distension, diagnosed as necrotizing enterocolitis.

Here, using a combination of chromatin immunoprecipitation-sequencing (ChIP-seq), microarray transcriptional profiling and bioinformatic analysis, we attempt to define the σE regulon. Approximately half of the genes identified encode proteins implicated in cell envelope function. Seventeen novel targets were validated by S1 nuclease mapping or in vitro transcription, establishing a σE -binding consensus. Subsequently, we used bioinformatic analysis to look for conservation of the σE target promoters identified in S. coelicolor across 19 Streptomyces species. Key proteins under σE control across the genus include the actin homolog MreB, three penicillin-binding proteins, two L,D-transpeptidases, a LytR-CpsA-Psr-family protein predicted to be involved in cell wall teichoic acid deposition and a predicted MprF protein, which adds lysyl groups to phosphatidylglycerol to neutralize membrane surface charge. Taken together, these analyses provide biological insight into the σE -mediated cell envelope stress response in the genus Streptomyces.","Folliculitis decalvans is characterized by a persistent, abnormal subepidermal microbiota.",https://www.ncbi.nlm.nih.gov/pubmed/30907453,Experimental dermatology,2019 05 15,"Folliculitis decalvans (FD) is a chronic inflammatory disease of unknown aetiology. Although Staphylococcus aureus, frequently found on lesional skin, is thought to play a causal role, the importance of its involvement remains controversial. To examine the role of S aureus, we compared superficial and subepidermal microbiota in 20 FD patients who had S aureus on lesional skin and in 20 healthy controls using culture techniques and genomic identification, before and after an anti-staphylococcal treatment; we also screened for S aureus virulence factors. When present on lesional skin, S aureus colonized non-lesional and subepidermal skin in 80% of cases. These data imply a break in the epidermal barrier integrity and that an abnormal non-lesional skin microbiota persists in FD. S aureus had no superantigenic toxin in 31% of cases and no toxin specificity. Clinical improvement obtained in most cases upon treatment was associated with the disappearance of S aureus in all studied areas, with an incomplete restoration of normal microbiota and a significant increase in negative bacterial samples. This persistent unbalanced, subepidermal microbiota may act as a reservoir of abnormal flora and explain the chronicity of FD, suggesting new avenues of research to restore normal microbiota.",Antidementia medication use by aged care facility residents with dementia.,https://www.ncbi.nlm.nih.gov/pubmed/30907450,International journal of geriatric psychiatry,2019 04 25,"Little is known about the use of antidementia medications in Australia.

In this study, we treated a human renal proximal tubule cell line (HK-2) with glyphosate for 24 hours at concentrations of 0, 20, 40 and 60 μm. Glyphosate was found to reduce cell viability and induce apoptosis and oxidative stress in a dose-dependent manner. Because the chemical structures of glyphosate and those of its metabolite AMPA are similar to glycine and glutamate, which are agonists of the N-methyl-d-aspartate receptor (NMDAR), we investigated the potential role of the NMDAR pathway in mediating the proapoptotic effect of glyphosate on proximal tubule cells. We found that NMDAR1 expression, as well as intracellular Ca2+ ([Ca2+ ]i ) and reactive oxygen species (ROS) levels, increased after glyphosate treatment. Blocking NMDAR attenuated glyphosate-induced upregulation of [Ca2+ ]i and ROS levels as well as apoptosis. Meanwhile, inhibition of [Ca2+ ]i reduced glyphosate-induced ROS and apoptosis, and inhibition of ROS alleviated glyphosate-induced apoptosis. In mice exposed to 400 mg/kg glyphosate, the urine low molecular weight protein levels started to increase from day 7. Upregulation of apoptosis and NMDAR1 expression in renal proximal tubule epithelium and an imbalance of oxidant and antioxidative products were observed. These results strongly suggest that activation of the NMDAR1 pathway, together with its downstream [Ca2+ ]i and oxidative stress, is involved in glyphosate-induced renal proximal tubule epithelium apoptosis.",Haematological adverse events associated with tyrosine kinase inhibitors in chronic myeloid leukaemia: A network meta-analysis.,https://www.ncbi.nlm.nih.gov/pubmed/30907446,British journal of clinical pharmacology,2019 05 24,"Despite their overall favourable safety profile, tyrosine kinase inhibitors (TKIs) are related to severe adverse events including haematological toxicities such as anaemia, leucopenia, neutropenia and thrombocytopenia.

The contraction of renal arterial rings in mice was measured by a Multi Myograph System. The intracellular calcium concentration ([Ca2+ ]i ) in vascular smooth muscle cells (VSMCs) was obtained by using a fluo-4/AM dye and a confocal laser scanning microscopy. The results show that the U46619-induced vasoconstriction of renal artery was completely blocked by a TXA2 receptor antagonist GR32191, significantly inhibited by a selective phospholipase C (PI-PLC) inhibitor U73122 at 10 μmol/L and partially inhibited by a Phosphatidylcholine - specific phospholipase C (PC-PLC) inhibitor D609 at 50 μmol/L. Moreover, the U46619-induced vasoconstriction was inhibited by a general protein kinase C (PKC) inhibitor chelerythrine at 10 μmol/L, and a selective PKCδ inhibitor rottlerin at 10 μmol/L. In addition, the PKC-induced vasoconstriction was partially inhibited by a Rho-kinase inhibitor Y-27632 at 10 μmol/L and was further completely inhibited together with a putative IP3 receptor antagonist and store-operated Ca2+ (SOC) entry inhibitor 2-APB at 100 μmol/L. On the other hand, U46619-induced vasoconstriction was partially inhibited by L-type calcium channel (Cav1.2) inhibitor nifedipine at 1 μmol/L and 2-APB at 50 and 100 μmol/L. Last, U46619-induced vasoconstriction was partially inhibited by a cell membrane Ca2+ activated C1- channel blocker 5-Nitro-2-(3-phenylpropylamino) benzoic acid (NPPB) at 50 and 100 μmol/L. Our results suggest that the U46619-induced contraction of mouse intrarenal arteries is mediated by Cav1.2 and SOC channel, through the activation of thromboxane-prostanoid receptors and its downstream signaling pathway.",Non-IgE-mediated hypersensitivity induced by multivitamins containing Tween-80.,https://www.ncbi.nlm.nih.gov/pubmed/30907442,Clinical and experimental pharmacology & physiology,2019 06 03,"Multivitamins have been widely used for years. Adverse reactions, especially hypersensitivity, to multivitamins are becoming noteworthy. However, the classification of hypersensitivity is confusing, and the trigger is unknown. Multivitamins consist of two vials labelled vial 1 containing Tween-80 and vial 2. Multivitamins without Tween-80 were used as a contrast. Behaviouristics, histamine, IgE, and blood pressure of beagle dogs and guinea-pigs were investigated by observation, ELISA and sphygmomanometer, and degranulation and apoptotic of RBL-2H3 cells were assayed by spectrophotometry and flow cytometry. The results showed that dogs suffered from multiorgan anaphylactoid symptoms, and dramatically decreased blood pressure, and high plasma concentrations of histamine after the first administration of multivitamins and multivitamins vial 1, which contains Tween-80, compared to the control, multivitamins vial 2 or multivitamins without Tween-80. In anaphylaxis assay, guinea-pigs did not display any anaphylaxis symptoms and there were no changes in plasma histamine and IgE concentrations in the multivitamins and multivitamins vial 1 groups or in the multivitamins vial 2 and multivitamins without Tween-80 groups except ovalbumin. Compared to the control, the release of β-hexosaminidase and histamine, and the apoptosis of non-antigen-sensitized RBL-2H3 cells significantly increased in the Tween-80 and multivitamins and multivitamins vial 1 groups in a concentration-dependent manner. However, there was no alteration in multivitamins vial 2 and multivitamins without Tween-80 groups. The results indicate that the hypersensitivity induced by multivitamins may be anaphylactoid reaction, but not anaphylaxis.

Sulfate uptake is a dynamic biological process that occurs in multiple cell layers and organs in plants. In vascular plants, sulfate ions are taken up from the soil environment to the outermost cell layers of roots and horizontally transferred to the vascular tissues for further distribution to distant organs. The amount of sulfate ions being metabolized in the cytosol and chloroplast/plastid or temporally stored in the vacuole depends on expression levels and functionalities of sulfate transporters bound specifically to the plasma membrane, chloroplast/plastid envelopes and tonoplast membrane. The entire system for sulfate homeostasis, therefore, requires different types of sulfate transporters to be expressed and coordinately regulated in specific organs, cell-types and subcellular compartments. Transcriptional and post-transcriptional regulatory mechanisms control the expression levels and functions of sulfate transporters to optimize sulfate uptake and internal distribution in response to sulfate availability and demands for synthesis of organic S metabolites.

Therefore, on 31 January 2018, a systematic literature search was performed to identify articles that reported (i) the amount of grafts classified as abnormal or which were revised or (ii) an association between TTFM and outcomes during follow-up. Random-effects models were used to create pooled estimates with 95% confidence intervals (CI) of (i) the rate of graft revision per patient, (ii) the rate of graft revision per graft and (iii) the rate of graft revision among grafts deemed abnormal based on TTFM parameters. The search yielded 242 articles, and 66 original articles were included in the systematic review. Of those articles, 35 studies reported on abnormal grafts or graft revisions (8943 patients, 15 673 grafts) and were included in the meta-analysis. In 4.3% of patients (95% CI 3.3-5.7%, I2 = 73.9) a revision was required and 2.0% of grafts (95% CI 1.5-2.5%; I2 = 66.0) were revised. The pooled rate of graft revisions among abnormal grafts was 25.1% (95% CI 15.5-37.9%; I2 = 80.2). Studies reported sensitivity ranging from 0.250 to 0.457 and the specificity from 0.939 to 0.984. Reported negative predictive values ranged from 0.719 to 0.980 and reported positive predictive values ranged from 0.100 to 0.840.

However, investigation and clinical application of this biomarker have been limited because standard approaches to identify these brief, low amplitude events are difficult, time consuming, and subjective. Recent studies have demonstrated that ripples co-occurring with epileptiform discharges ('spike ripple events') are easier to detect than ripples alone and have greater pathological significance. Here, we used objective techniques to quantify spike ripples and test whether this biomarker predicts seizure risk in childhood epilepsy. We evaluated spike ripples in scalp EEG recordings from a prospective cohort of children with a self-limited epilepsy syndrome, benign epilepsy with centrotemporal spikes, and healthy control children. We compared the rate of spike ripples between children with epilepsy and healthy controls, and between children with epilepsy during periods of active disease (active, within 1 year of seizure) and after a period of sustained seizure-freedom (seizure-free, >1 year without seizure), using semi-automated and automated detection techniques. Spike ripple rate was higher in subjects with active epilepsy compared to healthy controls (P = 0.0018) or subjects with epilepsy who were seizure-free ON or OFF medication (P = 0.0018). Among epilepsy subjects with spike ripples, each month seizure-free decreased the odds of a spike ripple by a factor of 0.66 [95% confidence interval (0.47, 0.91), P = 0.021]. Comparing the diagnostic accuracy of the presence of at least one spike ripple versus a classic spike event to identify group, we found comparable sensitivity and negative predictive value, but greater specificity and positive predictive value of spike ripples compared to spikes (P = 0.016 and P = 0.006, respectively). We found qualitatively consistent results using a fully automated spike ripple detector, including comparison with an automated spike detector. We conclude that scalp spike ripple events identify disease and track with seizure risk in this epilepsy population, using both semi-automated and fully automated detection methods, and that this biomarker outperforms analysis of spikes alone in categorizing seizure risk. These data provide evidence that spike ripples are a specific non-invasive biomarker for seizure risk in benign epilepsy with centrotemporal spikes and support future work to evaluate the utility of this biomarker to guide medication trials and tapers in these children and predict seizure risk in other at-risk populations."

The attention is mainly focused on the lipid droplets (LDs), spherical cytoplasmic organelles, which are devoted to the storage of the lipids. The amount of lipid content is often evaluated by measuring LDs size and/or the integrated optical density (IOD) in cultured cells. Both evaluations are directly associated to the lipid content and therefore they are correlated to each other, but a lack of theoretical relationship between size and IOD was observed in literature. Here we investigated the size-IOD relationship of LDs observed in microscopical images of cultured cells. The experimental data were obtained from immature and differentiated 3T3-L1 murine cells, which have been extensively used in studies on adipogenesis. A simple model based on the spherical shape of the LDs and the Lambert-Beer law, which describes the light absorption by an optical thick material, leads to a mathematical relationship. Despite only light rays' absorption was considered in the model, neglecting their scattering, a very good agreement between the theoretical curve and the experimental data was found. Moreover, a computational simulation corroborates the model indicating the validity of the mathematically theoretical relationship between size and IOD. The theoretical model could be used to calculate the absorption coefficient in the LDs population and it could be applied to seek for morphologically and functionally LDs subpopulations. The identification of LDs dynamic by measuring size and IOD could be related to different pathophysiological conditions and useful for understand cellular lipid-associated diseases.",[Prevalence of ten Immune-mediated inflammatory diseases (IMID) in Spain].,https://www.ncbi.nlm.nih.gov/pubmed/30907380,Revista espanola de salud publica,2019 05 13,"Immune-mediated inflammatory diseases (IMID) are chronic and highly disabling diseases that share inflammatory sequences and immunological dysregulations.

The LUNGMAN N1 anthropomorphic chest model contained artificial pulmonary nodules (diameter: 5, 8, 10, and 12 mm). Low-dose scanning protocols were used in image acquisition. Two experienced radiologists evaluated the image quality. The combinations of voltage, tube current, image noise, and radiation dose were recorded. Consistency of the image quality between raters was assessed by kappa statistical analysis. RESULTS Seventy CT scans of pulmonary nodules (diameter, 5-12 mm) were performed. There was a high degree of consistency for image quality between the two observers (K=0.929 for 5 mm nodules; K=0.819 for overall image quality). For 8 mm nodules, 100% were detected on both SDCT and HDCT. HDCT outperformed SDCT by 5%, in terms of effective dose.

Due to its differential diagnosis with melanoma, its recognition can be challenging. To evaluate clinical and dermoscopic predictors of recurrent nevi. Clinical data on 224 melanocytic nevi were collected, together with dermoscopic images. Shave biopsy was performed and the underside of the surgical specimen was examined using ex vivo dermoscopy. A total of 195 lesions were followed for six months. Recurrent nevi were observed in 59 lesions. The occurrence of recurrent nevi was inversely associated with increased patient age. Darker skin phototypes and the compound nevus type were more associated with recurrence. Regarding dermoscopic features, the presence of dark brown colour, multiple colours, dots, terminal hair, and an annular-distributed pigmentation around adnexal structures were associated with recurrent nevi. Ex vivo dermoscopy showed that visible hyperpigmentation on the underside of the surgical specimen was correlated with recurrence. Multivariable analysis showed that annular hyperpigmentation and age were the most relevant predictors of recurrence. Individuals with dark skin type and young adults are at increased risk of recurrent nevi.

Through the struggle against adverse events associated with treatments, the question of the residents' safety and wellbeing has been paramount. To get an estimation of the highest incidence rates of adverse events in nursing homes, we carried out a follow-up study on 536 residents over 15-day periods between November 2016 and May 2017 in 8 French nursing homes. Notifications by professionals coupled with explorations by an investigating physician helped evidence the different typologies and degrees of seriousness of treatment-related adverse events. The 149 treatment-related adverse events that were identified belonged to 13 risk domains. Four of these domains accounted for 60% of treatment-related adverse events: 'medication and medical provision', 'living environment', 'technical care and accompaniment', 'care organization and coordination'. Four treatment-related adverse events out of the 149 (2.7%) had a level of seriousness rated as 4; 16 (10.7%) had a seriousness level rated as 3.

Previously, we found that an excess of the free C-terminal domain (CTD) of ParB impeded DNA condensation or promoted decondensation of pre-assembled networks (Fisher et al., 2017). However, interpretation of the molecular basis for this phenomenon was complicated by our inability to uncouple protein binding from DNA condensation. Here, we have combined lateral magnetic tweezers with TIRF microscopy to simultaneously control the restrictive force against condensation and to visualise ParB protein binding by fluorescence. At non-permissive forces for condensation, ParB binds non-specifically and highly dynamically to DNA. Our new approach concluded that the free CTD blocks the formation of ParB networks by heterodimerisation with full length DNA-bound ParB. This strongly supports a model in which the CTD acts as a key bridging interface between distal DNA binding loci within ParB networks.",[Mitochondrial DNA hydroxymethylation level in the cerebral cortex of neonatal rats with hypoxic-ischemic brain damage].,https://www.ncbi.nlm.nih.gov/pubmed/30907358,Zhongguo dang dai er ke za zhi = Chinese journal of contemporary pediatrics,2019 04 03,To study the methylation level and dynamic change of 5-hydroxymethylcytosine (5hmC) in mitochondrial DNA (mtDNA) in the cerebral cortex of neonatal rats with hypoxic-ischemic brain damage.,"[Effects of respiratory syncytial virus infection on epidermal growth factor receptor, tight junction association proteins and mucin in airway epithelial cells].",https://www.ncbi.nlm.nih.gov/pubmed/30907357,Zhongguo dang dai er ke za zhi = Chinese journal of contemporary pediatrics,2019 04 03,"To study the effects of respiratory syncytial virus (RSV) infection on epidermal growth factor receptor (EGFR), tight junction association proteins and mucin in the human airway epithelial cells.",[Continuous expression of miR-431 during lung development in Sprague-Dawley rats].,https://www.ncbi.nlm.nih.gov/pubmed/30907356,Zhongguo dang dai er ke za zhi = Chinese journal of contemporary pediatrics,2019 04 03,To study the role of miR-431 in lung development and morphology.,[Liver dysfunction for 8 years with hypertension for 1 week in an 8-year-old girl].,https://www.ncbi.nlm.nih.gov/pubmed/30907355,Zhongguo dang dai er ke za zhi = Chinese journal of contemporary pediatrics,2019 04 03,"A girl, aged 8 years, developed jaundice and liver dysfunction in the neonatal period, with congenital glaucoma diagnosed on day 5 after birth, hypertension and unusual facies (broad forehead, hypertelorism and deep-set eyes).

The Rivalta test yielded a positive result and revealed that the ascites was exudate, suggesting the possibility of tuberculosis infection. The symptoms were not relieved after isoniazid-rifampicin anti-tuberculosis therapy and symptomatic/supportive treatment. Plain CT scan of the abdomen and contrast-enhanced CT showed that the lesion was located at the left wall of the transverse colon, with uneven thickening of the peritoneum and heterogeneous enhancement.

PET-CT scan showed an abnormal increase in fluorodeoxyglucose metabolism, which was shown as a mass near the splenic flexure of the transverse colon, with a maximum standard uptake value of 9.9, indicating a highly active lesion; this was consistent with the metabolic changes of malignant tumors. Surgical operation was performed and intraoperative exploration revealed massive ascites, a hard mass located at the hepatic flexure of the colon, involvement of the serous coat and surrounding tissues, stenosis of the bowel, lymph node enlargement around the superior mesenteric vessels and the gastrocolic ligament, and multiple metastatic nodules in the greater omentum, the abdominal wall and the pelvic cavity. The results of postoperative pathology were consistent with those of colonoscopic biopsy, i.e., poorly differentiated mucinous adenocarcinoma of the transverse colon and partly signet-ring cell carcinoma.

AD is pathologically characterized by senile plaques formed by extracellular amyloid-β (Aβ) peptide and intracellular neurofibrillary tangles (NFT) formed by hyperphosphorylated tau protein. Extensive synaptic loss and neuronal degeneration are responsible for memory impairment, cognitive decline and behavioral dysfunctions typical of AD. Amyloidosis has been implicated in the depression of acetylcholine synthesis and release, overactivation of N-methyl-D-aspartate (NMDA) receptors and increased intracellular calcium levels that result in excitotoxic neuronal degeneration. Current drugs used in AD treatment are either cholinesterase inhibitors or NMDA receptor antagonists; however they provide only symptomatic relief and do not alter the progression of the disease. Aβ is the product of amyloid precursor protein (APP) processing after successive cleavage by β- and γsecretases while APP proteolysis by α-secretase results in non-amyloidogenic products. According to the amyloid cascade hypothesis, Aβ dyshomeostasis results in the accumulation and aggregation of Aβ into soluble oligomers and insoluble fibrils. The former are synaptotoxic and can induce tau hyperphosphorylation while the latter deposit in senile plaques and elicit proinflammatory responses, contributing to oxidative stress, neuronal degeneration and neuroinflammation. Aβ-protein-targeted therapeutic strategies are thus a promising disease-modifying approach for the treatment and prevention of AD. This review summarizes recent findings on Aβ-protein targeted AD drugs, including β-secretase inhibitors, β-secretase inhibitors and modulators, β-secretase activators, direct inhibitors of Aβ aggregation and immunotherapy targeting Aβ, focusing mainly on those currently under clinical trials.",Strategies for the Recruitment and Retention of Racial/Ethnic Minorities in Alzheimer Disease and Dementia Clinical Research.,https://www.ncbi.nlm.nih.gov/pubmed/30907319,Current Alzheimer research,2019 03 25,"Racial/ethnic minorities have among the highest risks for Alzheimer disease and dementia, but remain underrepresented in clinical research studies.",In silico evaluation of acetylation mimics in the 27 lysine residues of human tau protein.,https://www.ncbi.nlm.nih.gov/pubmed/30907318,Current Alzheimer research,2019 03 25,"Various neurodegenerative diseases, including Alzheimer's disease (AD), are related to abnormal hyper-phosphorylated microtubule-associated protein tau accumulation in brain lesions.

Inflammation is a key characteristic of numerous diseases including neurodegenerative disorders and thus not surprisingly suppression of inflammation frequently constitutes a major therapeutic strategy for a wide spectrum of disorders. Several brain-resident and peripherally-derived immune populations and inflammatory mediators are involved in AD pathophysiology, with microglia comprising central cellular player in the disease process. Systemic inflammation, mostly in the form of infections, has long been observed to induce behavioral alterations and cognitive dysfunction, suggesting for a close interaction of the peripheral immune system with the brain. Systemic inflammation can result in neuroinflammation, mainly exhibited as microglial activation, production of inflammatory molecules, as well as recruitment of peripheral immune cells in the brain, thus shaping a cerebral inflammatory milieu that may seriously impact neuronal function. Increasing clinical and experimental studies have provided significant evidence that acute (e.g. infections) or chronic (e.g. autoimmune diseases like rheumatoid arthritis) systemic inflammatory conditions may be associated with increased AD risk and accelerate AD progression. Here we review the current literature that links systemic with CNS inflammation and the implications of this interaction for AD in the context of acute and chronic systemic pathologies as acute infection and rheumatoid arthritis. Elucidating the mechanisms that govern the crosstalk between the peripheral and the local brain immune system may provide the ground for new therapeutic approaches that target the immune-brain interface and shed light to the understanding of AD.",Attenuation of cardiac ischaemia-reperfusion injury by treatment with hydrogen-rich water.,https://www.ncbi.nlm.nih.gov/pubmed/30907314,Current molecular medicine,2019 03 25,"Hydrogen has been shown to exert a bioactive effect on myocardium. This study examined the signalling pathways for hydrogen attenuating ischaemia-reperfusion injury. In total, 20 male Wistar rats were evaluated for the effects of hydrogen-rich water on ischaemia-reperfusion in hearts. Left ventricular tissue was taken for screening and analysis of active protein factors by protein chip technology. The enrichment of the KEGG pathway was obtained by using the Gene Ontology (GO) enrichment principle. The expression of JAK2、STAT1、STAT3、p-STAT1、p-JAK2、p-STAT3 in rat myocardium was detected by Western blot analysis and immunohistochemistry. The apoptosis rates of the control and hydrogen-rich water groups were detected by TUNEL staining. The expression levels of 25 proteins, including five transduction pathways, were downregulated in the hydrogen-rich water group. The expression levels of p-JAK2/JAK2、p-STAT3/STAT3 were upregulated in the hydrogen-rich water group compared with the control group, and p-STAT1/STAT1 was downregulated in the hydrogen-rich water group compared with the control group. Furthermore, the apoptosis rate was significantly decreased in the hydrogen-rich water group, as well. Hydrogen-rich water may inhibit the apoptosis of cardiomyocytes after ischaemia-reperfusion by upregulating the expression of the JAK2-STAT3 signalling pathway, which reduces ischaemia-reperfusion injury.",Integrons and antiseptic resistance genes mediate resistance of Acinetobacter baumannii and Pseudomonas aeruginosa isolates from intensive care unit patients with wound infections.,https://www.ncbi.nlm.nih.gov/pubmed/30907313,Current molecular medicine,2019 03 25,"Acinetobacter baumannii and Pseudomonas aeruginosa are of major concern for hospitalized patients.

In addition, the reliability of the determination of creatinine level is limited because it depends on many factors. New studies have presented other, more useful laboratory markers of renal function that can be measured in serum and/or in urine."

The preservation of gonadal function and fertility is of great importance to many predominantly young SLE patients. Some fertility preservation methods are well established and well known, whereas others are considered more cautiously. In particular, the cryopreservation of ovarian tissue is a rarely chosen fertility preservation option for SLE patients of (pre)fertile age. We report the first case of successful conception and pregnancy of an SLE patient after autotransplantation of cryopreserved ovarian tissue. A 26-year-old SLE patient decided to undergo cryopreservation of ovarian tissue when receiving cyclophosphamide for lupus nephritis. Tissue removal, preparation, cryopreservation and quality control was performed, as described, according to current state-of-the-art techniques. After 6 years of being in remission using azathioprine and belimumab, her ovarian tissue was autotransplanted because of premature ovarian failure, diagnosed at the age of 32, and a wish to conceive. She conceived spontaneously 8 months later, having a diamniotic-dichoriotic twin pregnancy. The children were born prematurely due to preterm premature rupture of membranes in the 32nd week of gestation; mother and children are doing very well 8 months later. We regard the procedure to be an option worth consideration for our predominantly young SLE patients.",Left ventricular pseudoaneurysm associated with systemic lupus erythematosus.,https://www.ncbi.nlm.nih.gov/pubmed/30907295,Lupus,2019 05 08,"Systemic lupus erythematosus (SLE) is associated with several cardiac manifestations but, to our knowledge, there have been no previously published reports on left ventricular (LV) pseudoaneurysm in this disease.

The patient was diagnosed with a large LV pseudoaneurysm and a bovine pericardium patch closure was performed. Coronary arteries were angiographically normal, and cardiac magnetic resonance imaging did not exhibit detectable myocardial fibrosis or infarction. Trauma, previous cardiac surgery, Chagas disease, and antiphospholipid syndrome were excluded. Histopathology of the pericardium revealed lymphocytic arteriolitis raising the possibility of an autoimmune-mediated mechanism for this complication.

The aim of this study was to investigate whether providing information (psychoeducation) could improve study participants' perception of a PMDD-patient and whether experimentally-induced prejudices about PMDD resulted in stigmatization. Two hundred sixteen students (50% female; aged 18-42 years) from Philipps University Marburg participated in January 2014. Participants were randomly assigned to one of two experimental groups (EG1, EG2) or to a control group (CG). EG1 read a text informing about PMDD. EG2 read a text with stereotypic PMDD-information. CG received a text with information unrelated to PMDD. Then, all participants watched a video of a woman reporting about her PMDD. Finally, participants appraised the woman on the cognitive dimensions warmth and competence as well as on PMDD-related attributes (depressive symptoms, emotional regulation). Participants of EG1 rated the woman as warmer (p <  .001), more competent (p =  .006), and with less depressive symptoms (p < .001) than the CG. The results by study group did not differ by gender. Stereotypic information did not differ significantly among the study groups.

This article presents narrative-based accounts of nine queer South Asian women in Toronto, Canada, to examine the ways in which they experience racial discrimination in the LGBTQ community, and the impact that this mistreatment has on identity formation and connectivity to queer spheres. It finds that queer South Asian women experience racial discrimination in the form of racially charged microaggressions, which are evidenced through expectations of assimilation to Western-normative performances of queer identity and erasure of South Asian culture in the LGBTQ community. Further, it reveals that Toronto's LGBTQ community perpetuates a culture of White privilege that discredits the intersectional identity of queer South Asian women, and consequently invisibilizes, alienates, and revokes agency from these women who do not fit the majority's conceptualizations about what a queer woman looks like.","""Opening the door"": developing and pilot testing an adult protective services worker engagement training in New York city.",https://www.ncbi.nlm.nih.gov/pubmed/30907269,Journal of elder abuse & neglect,2019 06 10,"About 10% of Americans over the age of 60 experience elder abuse (EA), but EA is frequently under detected.

The Opening the Door (OTD) training was developed in a multidisciplinary setting and designed in collaboration with APS workers to enhance their engagement skills in potential EA cases and thus maximize the possibility of disclosure. Rooted in a relational approach and utilizing adult learning theory, it is divided into three main topics: Preparing for Engagement, Engagement Practice, and Processing Engagement. The eight-hour training was piloted with three groups of urban APS caseworkers with a wide range of work experience.

One of the reasons for this effectiveness is that the narratives' intention to persuade is often not explicit, thus making them less likely to be disputed. The goal of this research is to examine the moderating role of persuasive intent in narrative persuasion. To do so, we conducted a 2 (Message format: narrative vs. nonnarrative messages) × 2 (Persuasive intent: intent vs. no intent) experiment with a factorial design among 205 participants on the effects of health narrative messages. Results indicated that persuasive intent undermined the effects of health narratives on persuasion by reducing believability and increasing reactance.

Scholarship suggests a myriad of gendered social factors that precipitate girls' involvement in the juvenile justice system; however, less is known about how stakeholders within the juvenile justice system perceive the girls they work with or interpret their experiences. The current paper examines the attributions that juvenile justice system workers make about the reasons girls offend. In line with previous research, we identify both internal (personality, character traits) and external (situational) explanations for girls' involvement in the juvenile justice system that correspond to gender stereotypes and expectations of girls. Furthermore, we identify structural attributions as a special subset of external attributions that take into account how larger social, economic, and historical factors shape girls' situations and experiences and contribute to their criminal behavior. These structural attributions have implications for practitioners' views of justice and the role of the juvenile justice system in the lives of girls. We conclude with a set of implications for practice and policy.",Traditional gender roles and alcohol use among Latinas/os: A review of the literature.,https://www.ncbi.nlm.nih.gov/pubmed/30907264,Journal of ethnicity in substance abuse,2019 03 25,"Research indicates alcohol use among Latinas/os occurs within a gendered context. Scholars surmise this is due to traditional gender roles (TGRs) of Latina/o culture, but without an analysis of the literature these assertions are unclear. Thus, this article provides a narrative review of the extant TGRs and alcohol use literature among Latinas/os. Thirteen articles met inclusion criteria. Across studies, findings were mixed, aside from those suggesting TGRs composed of hypermasculinity (i.e., traditional machismo) were robustly related to drinking. Tests of mediation and moderation indicated TGRs and alcohol use should be assessed within a multivariate framework. Future research should address these inconsistencies through methodological refinements. In addition, we suggest the integration of existing theoretical perspectives to assist with scholarly development in this area.",Gender differences in attachment from an evolutionary perspective: what is Good for the goose may not be good for the gander.,https://www.ncbi.nlm.nih.gov/pubmed/30907263,Attachment & human development,2019 03 25,"Human gender differences tend to be largest in behaviors of high reproductive relevance, that is, sexual and parenting behavior. Such differences show up best in biologically meaningful configurations of specific behaviors rather than in coarse categories. Paternal involvement is thus expressed in aspects and optima which differ from those of maternal involvement. A case in point is sensitivity in its effect on secure attachment, with paternal behavior to be measured by a yardstick different from maternal behavior. Secure father-child attachment may be fostered by optimal levels of paternal activation/stimulation which are different from maternal optima. Paternal action preferences lead to preferences for rough play, which may be especially relevant to the socialization of male offspring. Moreover, fathers-unlike mothers-may perceive their paternal effort as mating effort. The study of father-child attachment-and especially its differences from mother-child attachment-can benefit from considering evolved sex differences in parental behavior.",Self-Doubt Effects Depend on Beliefs about Ability: Experimental Evidence.,https://www.ncbi.nlm.nih.gov/pubmed/30907262,The Journal of general psychology,2019 05 10,"Past research has shown negative effects of chronic self-doubt on psychological and performance outcomes. Recent correlational evidence suggests that incremental beliefs about ability ameliorate certain self-doubt effects. The current research examines whether these correlational findings are robust when subjected to experimental testing. In Experiment 1, we manipulated beliefs about ability (incremental vs. entity) and demonstrated that changing beliefs about ability altered responses to self-doubt. For individuals primed with entity beliefs, higher self-doubt was associated with greater nervousness and poorer anagram performance; for individuals primed with incremental beliefs, self-doubt had no significant effects. Experiment 2 was a 2 (manipulated belief: incremental vs. entity) × 2 (self-doubt: doubt induction vs. control) factorial design. The result showed that self-doubt induction lowered self-esteem relative to control when people were primed with entity beliefs but did not affect self-esteem when incremental beliefs were primed. However, Experiment 1 results on affect and performance were not replicated in Experiment 2. Thus, although we provide some causal evidence that inducing individuals to adopt an ability-is-malleable mindset reduces the negative effects of self-doubt, further experimental work is required to study the moderating role of mindsets for self-doubt effects.","Diagnosing the GOSE: Structural and Psychometric Properties Using Item Response Theory, a TRACK-TBI Pilot Study.",https://www.ncbi.nlm.nih.gov/pubmed/30907261,Journal of neurotrauma,2019 06 10,"The Glasgow Outcome Scale-Extended (GOSE) was designed to assess global outcome after traumatic brain injury (TBI). Since its introduction, several empirically founded criticisms of the GOSE have been raised, including poor reliability; an insensitivity to small, but potentially meaningful, changes; a tendency to produce ceiling effects; inconsistent associations with neurocognitive, psychological, and quality-of-life measures; and an inability to assess the multi-dimensional nature of TBI outcome. The current project took a diagnostic approach to identifying the underlying causes of reported limitations by exploring the internal construct validity of the GOSE at 3 and 6 months post-injury using item response theory (IRT) techniques. Data were from the TRACK-TBI Pilot Study, a large (N = 586), prospective, multi-site project that included TBI cases of all injury severity levels. To assess the level of latent functional ""impairment"" captured by GOSE items independent of the assigned outcome category or GOSE total score, items were modified so that higher scores reflected greater impairment. Results showed that although the GOSE's items capture varying levels of impairment across a broad disability spectrum at 3 and 6 months, there was also evidence at each time point of item redundancy (multiple items capturing similar levels of impairment), item deficiency (lack of items capturing lower levels of impairment), and item inefficiency (items only capturing minimal impairment information). The findings illustrate the value of IRT to illuminate strengths and weaknesses of clinical outcome assessment measures and provide a framework for future measure refinement."

Arabic-speaking communities in Australia underutilise mental health services despite high levels of trauma and psychological distress. Clinicians who work with this population lack linguistically and culturally appropriate clinical resources. The aim of this study was to explore the acceptability and clinical utility of a Mindfulness Skills CD translated into formal Arabic. The 70 participants were Arabic-speaking adults, mostly Lebanese-born Muslim women, who enrolled in a 5-week mindfulness program using the CD and agreed to follow-up at 12 weeks. Both recruitment and data collection were undertaken by a female project officer who is a widely respected member of the Arabic community in south-east Sydney. Compliance with the program protocol was high and all but 4 participants continued to use the CD beyond the 5 weeks. Overall, participants reported that mindfulness techniques fitted well with their way of life and were compatible with their cultural and religious practices. Most found mindfulness complementary to their regular reflective prayer. Using the Mindfulness Skills CD was associated with statistically significant reductions in psychological distress as measured by the Kessler Scale (K10) and the Depression, Anxiety, and Stress Scale (DASS21) postprogram (K10; DASS21 Depression and Stress subscales) and at follow-up (all measures). The evaluation showed that the Arabic Mindfulness Skills CD is an effective and culturally appropriate mental health resource for this population group.

To investigate their attitudes towards suicide and the role they play when people are in suicidal crisis, 10 community leaders were interviewed in a rural community in Ghana. Thematic Analysis of the interviews showed that leaders held two conflicting views about suicide: health crisis and moral taboo. They also viewed the reasons for suicide as psychosocial strains more than psychiatric factors. Though they viewed suicide as a moral taboo, they maintained a more neutral position in their gatekeeping role: providing support for persons in suicidal crisis more often than exerting a condemnatory attitude.

The students were blind to the outcome of the event and an average score for each photograph was used in data analysis. Results showed that gold medallists displayed greater levels of happiness than silver medallists but that silver and bronze medallists showed little difference in their expressed happiness. In Study 2, 192 quotations from bronze and silver medallists were obtained from news outlets, and 20 students rated the expression of counterfactual thought in each quotation. Results showed that compared to bronze medallists, silver medallists had more counterfactual thoughts overall, more counterfactual thoughts about how things could have gone better, and more counterfactual thoughts about their opponents' behaviour. Overall, findings indicate that counterfactual thoughts differ between bronze and silver medallists, but that differences in expressed emotion are likely to be trivial or negligible.",Impact of a Quality Improvement Program on the Neurological Outcome of Patients with Traumatic Spinal Cord Injury: A Before-After Mono-Centric Study.,https://www.ncbi.nlm.nih.gov/pubmed/30907244,Journal of neurotrauma,2019 05 15,"Spinal cord injury (SCI) is a major cause of severe disability. This study aims to assess the effectiveness of a quality improvement program on neurological recovery after SCI. Before-after study during two phases was done in one intensive care unit in a university hospital. The quality improvement project comprised protective mechanical ventilation, early tracheostomy in anatomical injury above the sixth cervical vertebra, early enteral nutrition, early mobilization, and active perineal care in adult SCI patients. The primary endpoint was the difference between the American Spinal Injury Association (ASIA) motor score between discharge and intensive care unit (ICU) admission (Delta ASIA). Fifty-seven and 60 patients were included in the control and in the intervention period respectively. The ASIA motor score upon ICU admission was 16 (7-37) before and 11 (2-30) after the implementation (p = 0.30). The implementation phase was associated with lower tidal volumes (p < 0.001), higher positive end-expiratory pressure (p < 0.001), earlier tracheostomy (p = 0.01), earlier enteral nutrition initiation (p < 0.05), earlier mobilization (p < 0.05), and more active perineal care (p < 0.05). The Delta ASIA was +16 [4-32] after versus +6 [0-14] before the intervention (p < 0.05). After adjustment for potential cofounders, the intervention phase was significantly associated with higher Delta ASIA (β coefficient, 11.4; CI95 [1.9-21]; p = 0.01) in multi-variable analysis. No secular time trend unrelated to the intervention was highlighted. One year after trauma, the Delta ASIA was higher in the intervention period than in the control period (+34 [15-60] vs. +11 [0-33]; p < 0.05). After adjustment on potential confounders, an early in-ICU rehabilitation program in SCI patients was associated with higher neurological score upon ICU discharge.",Discovery of potential sclerostin inhibitors from plants with loop2 region of sclerostin inhibition by interacting with residues outside Pro-Asn-Ala-Ile-Gly motif.,https://www.ncbi.nlm.nih.gov/pubmed/30907243,Journal of biomolecular structure & dynamics,2019 04 08,"Sclerostin, an antagonist of the Wnt/β-catenin signaling pathway, was discovered as a potential therapeutic target for stimulating bone formation in osteoporosis. In this study, molecular docking was employed to predict the binding of 29 herbal compounds, which were reported as bone formation stimulators, to the loop2 region of sclerostin. Then, the 50 ns molecular dynamics (MD) simulation of the complexes between sclerostin and the top 10 hits obtained from molecular docking were carried out. Root mean square deviations (RMSDs) analysis of MD trajectories pointed out that all ligands-complexes remain stable throughout the duration of MD simulations. In addition, the molecular mechanics/generalized born surface area (MM/GBSA) binding free energy and energy decomposition analyses were determined. The results here suggested that baicalin is the most promising inhibitor of sclerostin. Interestingly, baicalin binds to sclerostin via the hydrophobic interaction with the amino acid residues on loop2 region but outside the Pro-Asn-Ala-Ile-Gly (PNAIG) motif, particularly the Arg-Gly-Lys-Trp-Trp-Arg (RGKWWR) motif.

Tobacco use has been shown to have a linear association with the development of the disease. While early diagnosis and treatment of LSCC are critical in improving the 5-year survival rate and quality of life, diagnosis of early-stage LSCC remains challenging because of the unapparent symptoms. Here, we report that miR-506, a critical regulator in many types of cancers, is aberrantly suppressed in LSCC patient tissues and cultured cancer cells. This is likely responsible for the enhanced production of YAP1 protein, a transcriptional factor that is well known for its oncogenic roles in LSCC malignancy. Statistical analysis has confirmed that the expression levels of miR-506 and YAP1 are strongly correlated with the malignant statuses of patient tumors. Restoring the expression level of miR-506 in cultured LSCC cells significantly inhibited proliferation, migration and invasion of the cells. The miR-506 and YAP1 regulatory network seems to affect at least pathways involved in apoptosis. Our study, for the first time, has demonstrated a tumor suppressive role of miR-506 in LSCC. This opens new opportunities for further exploring the molecular details of the development of the disease and thus will facilitate the development of novel diagnosis and therapeutic strategies.",Dual roles of ULK1 (unc-51 like autophagy activating kinase 1) in cytoprotection against lipotoxicity.,https://www.ncbi.nlm.nih.gov/pubmed/30907226,Autophagy,2019 04 10,"Saturated fatty acid (SFA)-induced lipotoxicity is caused by the accumulation of reactive oxygen species (ROS), which is associated with damaged mitochondria. Moreover, lipotoxicity is crucial for the progression of nonalcoholic steatohepatitis (NASH). Autophagy is required for the clearance of protein aggregates or damaged mitochondria to maintain cellular metabolic homeostasis. The NFE2L2/NRF2 (nuclear factor, erythroid 2 like 2)-KEAP1 (kelch like ECH associated protein 1) pathway is essential for the elimination of ROS. ULK1 (unc-51 like autophagy activating kinase 1; yeast Atg1) is involved in the initiation of autophagy; however, its role in lipotoxicity-induced cell death in hepatocytes and mouse liver has not been elucidated. We now show that ULK1 potentiates the interaction between KEAP1 and the autophagy adaptor protein SQSTM1/p62, thereby mediating NFE2L2 activation in a manner requiring SQSTM1-dependent autophagic KEAP1 degradation. Furthermore, ULK1 is required for the autophagic removal of damaged mitochondria and to enhance binding between SQSTM1 and PINK1 (PTEN induced kinase 1). This study demonstrates the molecular mechanisms underlying the cytoprotective role of ULK1 against lipotoxicity. Thus, ULK1 could represent a potential therapeutic target for the treatment of NASH.

Osteosarcoma (OS) is an aggressive bone tumour, characterized by the presence of malignant mesenchymal cells. The specific tumour-driving genetic alterations that are associated with OS development are currently poorly understood. Mesenchymal stem cells (MSCs) of osteogenic lineage have been postulated as likely candidates as the cells of origin for OS, thus indicating that MSCs and OS stroma cells may be related cell types. Therefore, this study set out to examine the EV-mediated intercellular crosstalk of MSCs and OS. MSCs and pre-osteoblasts were treated with OS-EVs at different time points, and the epigenetic signature of OS-EVs was assessed by methylation analysis of LINE-1 (long interspersed element) and tumour suppressor genes. In addition, surface markers and expression of specific genes were also evaluated. Our data indicated that OS-EVs mediated LINE-1 hypomethylation in MSCs, whereas an opposite effect was seen in pre-osteoblasts, indicating that MSCs but not pre-osteoblasts were susceptible to epigenetic transformation. Thus, OS-EVs modulated the fate of MSCs by modulating the epigenetic status, and also influenced the expression of genes related to bone microenvironment remodelling. Overall, this study provided evidence that epigenetic regulation appears to be an early event in the transformation of MSCs during the development of OS. Elucidating the mechanisms of EV-mediated communication may lead to new avenues for therapeutic exploitation.","""We Cannot Let Them Die"": Undocumented Immigrants and Media Framing of Health Deservingness in the United States.",https://www.ncbi.nlm.nih.gov/pubmed/30907224,Qualitative health research,2019 03 25,"Based on a systematic qualitative analysis of articles published by The New York Times (2009-2017), this article presents the main media frames that support the access to government-sponsored health care by undocumented immigrants, just before and after passage of the U.S. Affordable Care Act in 2010. Under the umbrella of ""selective inclusion,"" this study highlights a ""compassionate frame"" that conveys sympathy toward severely ill, undocumented immigrants. This approach is reinforced by a ""cost-control"" frame that underlines the economic benefits of providing health care to the undocumented immigrant population in the United States. Supported by both humane and market-based approaches, these frames make a compelling case for the inclusion of particular groups into the U.S. health care safety net.

In the previous work,9 the expression pattern of the genes encoding the PEPR receptors and the AtPROPEP peptide precursor proteins was studied using promoter-GUS reporter constructs. Here, using the same constructs to study their expression pattern under biotic and abiotic stress, including AtPep1, flg22, methyl jasmonate (MeJA), and NaCl treatments, we observed that in response to AtPep1 and flg22, the activation of AtPEPR1 promoter was different from AtPEPR2. We also found that these promoters were differentially activated in response to NaCl. Remarkably, we showed that it is possible to classify the genes of the AtPROPEP family, based on the response of their promoters to the various stimuli employed: thus, we classify AtPROPEP1 in one group; AtPROPEP2 and AtPROPEP3 in a second group; AtPROPEP4, AtPROPEP7 and AtPROPEP8 in a third group and AtPROPEP5 in a fourth group. Our finding, confirm non-redundant roles among the members of the AtPROPEP family and their corresponding receptors.",Actin filaments are dispensable for bulk autophagy in plants.,https://www.ncbi.nlm.nih.gov/pubmed/30907219,Autophagy,2019 04 01,"Actin filament, also known as microfilament, is one of two major cytoskeletal elements in plants and plays important roles in various biological processes. Like in animal cells, actin filaments have been thought to participate in autophagy in plants. However, surprisingly, in this study we found that actin filaments are dispensable for the occurrence of autophagy in plants. Disruption of actin filaments by short term treatment with actin polymerization inhibitors, cytochalasin D and latrunculin B, or transient overexpression of Profilin 3 in Nicotiana benthamiana had no effect on basal autophagy as well as the upregulation of nocturnal autophagy and salt stress-induced autophagy. Furthermore, anti-microfilament drug treatment affected neither basal nor salt stress-induced autophagy in Arabidopsis. In addition, prolonged perturbation of actin filaments by silencing Actin7 or 24-h treatment with microfilament-disrupting agents in N. benthamiana caused endoplasmic reticulum (ER) disorganization and subsequent degradation via autophagy involving ATG2, 3, 5, 6 and 7.

We identified 9,362 men aged ≥20 years diagnosed with gallbladder stone disease between 2000 and 2011 from Taiwan's National Health Insurance Research Database as the study cohort, and we randomly selected 9,362 men from the nongallbladder stone disease population by 1:1 frequency-matching with the case cohort based on age, the index date for the diagnosis of gallbladder stone disease, and comorbidities as the control cohort. All subjects were followed until December 31, 2011, for measuring the erectile dysfunction incidence. The risk of organic erectile dysfunction was higher in the gallbladder stone disease cohort than the nongallbladder stone disease cohort (4.01 vs. 2.69 per 1,000 person-years, adjusted hazard ratio = 1.41, 97.5% confidence interval [1.12, 1.78]), but the risk of psychogenic erectile dysfunction was comparable between the gallbladder stone disease cohort and the nongallbladder stone disease cohort (0.40 vs. 0.28 per 1,000 person-years, adjusted hazard ratio = 1.37, 97.5% confidence interval [0.67, 2.79]). Moreover, gallbladder stone disease men with cholecystectomy exhibited a lower risk of developing organic erectile dysfunction than gallbladder stone disease men without cholecystectomy (adjusted hazard ratio = 0.58, 97.5% confidence interval [0.41, 0.80]). The risk of organic erectile dysfunction contributed by gallbladder stone disease was only significantly higher in men aged ≥65 years (adjusted hazard ratio = 2.21, 97.5% confidence interval [1.34, 3.63]) and in men with comorbidities (adjusted hazard ratio = 1.42, 97.5% confidence interval [1.09, 1.85]). The risk of psychogenic erectile dysfunction contributed by gallbladder stone disease was nonsignificant in each age group and in men with or without comorbidities. Gallbladder stone disease is associated with an increased risk of organic erectile dysfunction, but it has no association with psychogenic erectile dysfunction. History of cholecystectomy for gallbladder stone disease may ameliorate the risk of organic erectile dysfunction; it requires more studies to ascertain the protective mechanism and to clarify whether the existence of gallbladder stone disease is an epiphenomenon or independent risk factor of erectile dysfunction.",Helicobacter pylori: molecular basis for colonization and survival in gastric environment and resistance to antibiotics. A short review.,https://www.ncbi.nlm.nih.gov/pubmed/30907202,"Infectious diseases (London, England)",2019 05 10,"Helicobacter pylori is a human-specific pathogen with a strict tropism for the gastric mucosa. This bacterium infects around half of the world population and is the main responsible for gastritis, peptic ulcer and, in some cases, for the pathogenesis of gastric cancer. Nevertheless, disease development in infected subjects depends not only on the bacterium, but also on the host genetic predisposition and on environmental factors. The fascinating question of how the bacterium can survive in the gastric environment has stimulated research in this field. It is now clear that H. pylori is able to colonize and adhere to the gastric epithelium through several mechanisms, including the breakdown of urea with production of the cell-toxic ammonia. The resulting raise in pH neutralizes acidity of the stomach, thereby allowing the bacterium to safely cross the mucus layer to the epithelial surface. Current challenges regard understanding the mechanisms of antibiotic resistance and how to overcome it. Lately, an increasing H. pylori resistance rate to antibiotics has been reported and several molecular bases for this phenomenon described. In this review, we highlight the current knowledge on mechanisms supporting H. pylori resistance to gastric environment and to therapy.",Intratubular Teratoma: A Rare Form of Testicular Germ Cell Neoplasia.,https://www.ncbi.nlm.nih.gov/pubmed/30907201,International journal of surgical pathology,2019 03 25,"Germ cell neoplasia in situ is the initial manifestation for invasive germ cell tumor. Further progression will result in intratubular germ cell tumor with the majority being intratubular seminoma or intratubular embryonal carcinoma. Intratubular teratoma in the testis is exceptionally rare with no well-documented cases to our knowledge. In this article, we report a case of an intratubular teratoma adjacent to mixed germ cell tumor in the testis. The patient is a 34-year-old male who presented with a palpable right testicular mass and underwent right radical orchiectomy. Gross examination of the testis revealed 2.0-cm tan, well-circumscribed, firm, and nodular mass at the inferior pole. Microscopic examination revealed a mixed germ cell tumor, predominantly seminoma (95%) with embryonal carcinoma (4%) and teratoma (1%). There is also germ cell neoplasia in situ, intratubular seminoma, and intratubular teratoma at the periphery of the tumor. Tubules with intratubular teratoma were filled by neoplastic squamous cells with a single layer of germ cell neoplasia in situ at the periphery. Adjacent to the intratubular teratoma was seminoma, embryonal carcinoma, and invasive teratoma. Immunohistochemical stains showed the neoplastic squamous cells in the tubule to be positive for p40 and negative for OCT34 and D2-40. The single layer of germ cell neoplasia in situ at the periphery of the intratubular teratoma was negative for p40 and positive for OCT34 and D2-40. Although teratoma is a common component in an adult germ cell tumor, an intratubular manifestation is exceptional. The present case illustrates this rare finding.",Chlorogenic acid-enriched green coffee bean extract affects arterial stiffness assessed by the cardio-ankle vascular index in healthy men: a pilot study.,https://www.ncbi.nlm.nih.gov/pubmed/30907200,International journal of food sciences and nutrition,2019 06 05,"The effect of chlorogenic acid-enriched green coffee bean extract (cGCE) intake on arterial stiffness was investigated using the cardio-ankle vascular index (CAVI) as a novel surrogate marker for predicting arteriosclerosis. A placebo-controlled double-blind pilot study was conducted with 16 healthy Japanese men. Subjects were divided into two groups and consumed beverages containing either cGCE or placebo daily for 2 weeks. The CAVI, the primary endpoint of the study, was evaluated at the beginning of the study and 2 weeks later. Endothelium-dependent flow-mediated dilation (FMD) and sympathetic nervous activity (SNA), which are thought to be related to the CAVI, were also measured. The CAVI change was significantly greater in the cGCE group than in the placebo group. In addition, FMD increased and SNA decreased in the cGCE group. These findings suggest that 2-week ingestion of cGCE may improve arterial stiffness as assessed by the CAVI.",Analysis of phytochemical contributors to antioxidant capacity of the peel of Chinese mandarin and orange varieties.,https://www.ncbi.nlm.nih.gov/pubmed/30907199,International journal of food sciences and nutrition,2019 03 25,"The phytochemicals in the peel of six oranges and ten mandarins including seven wild varieties and three cultivars were systematically characterised using UHPLC-Q-TOF-MS, and the correlation analysis was performed between phytochemicals and antioxidant capacity in order to investigate the phytochemical contributors to antioxidant capacity.

The aim of this study was to assess accuracy of FIT for advanced neoplasia (AN) with two fecal samples in a colonoscopy screening cohort. Materials and methods: The study comprised 1155 participants of the colonoscopy arm in SCREESCO (Screening of Swedish Colons, NCT02078804), a randomized controlled study on CRC screening of 60-year-olds from the Swedish average-risk population. Participants provided two FIT samples prior to colonoscopy. First sample, mean of two, and any of the two samples above cut off level were assessed. Colonoscopy findings (CRC, advanced adenoma (AA), AN (CRC + AA) and adenoma characteristics) were evaluated in uni- and multivariable analysis in relation to FIT positivity (at ≥10 µg hemoglobin (Hb)/g). Results: Of 1155 invited, 806 (416 women, 390 men) participated. CRC, AA and non-AA were found in one (0.1%), 80 (9.9%) and 145 (18%), respectively. Sensitivity and specificity for AN were 20%/93%, 25%/92% and 26%/89% for first, mean of two and any of the two samples respectively at cut off level 10 µg/g, corresponding to 60 (74%)-65 (80%) participants with missed AN. The difference in sensitivity between screening strategies was non-significant. The specificity for first sample was significantly higher than for any of the two samples at cut off 10 µg/g (p = .02) and 20 µg/g (p = .04). FIT positivity in participants with adenoma was associated with pedunculated shape (p = .007) and high-risk dysplasia (p = .009). Conclusions: In an average-risk colonoscopy screening cohort of 60-year-olds, sensitivity for AN was modest and did not increase when using two samples instead of one. FIT predominantly detected adenomas with pedunculated shape and high-risk dysplasia, and participants with flat or broad based adenomas may thus be missed in screening.",Extra-Adrenal Adult Neuroblastoma With Aberrant Germ Cell Marker Expression: Maturation After Chemotherapy as an Important Clue to a Challenging Diagnosis.,https://www.ncbi.nlm.nih.gov/pubmed/30907195,International journal of surgical pathology,2019 03 25,"Adult neuroblastoma is an extremely infrequent neoplasm, usually occurring in the adrenal medulla or in the paraspinal sympathetic ganglia, as its childhood counterpart.

This aberrant marker expression, the unusual positivity for NKX2.2 and the very scattered (instead of diffuse strong) PHOX2B expression, complicated the initial diagnosis. In this case, the posttreatment histological evaluation revealed the neuroblastic nature of the lesion. Neuroblastoma maturation after treatment is an unusual finding in adults, and in this case, added an important clue for the final diagnosis. Germs cells markers expression in neuroblastoma is an interesting feature to explore and may define a subset of neuroblastomas with a different biological nature.","Onset of respiratory symptoms among Chinese students: associations with dampness and redecoration, PM10, NO2, SO2 and inadequate ventilation in the school.",https://www.ncbi.nlm.nih.gov/pubmed/30907194,The Journal of asthma : official journal of the Association for the Care of Asthma,2019 03 25,To study onset of respiratory symptoms among students in China in relation to the school and the home environment.

The aim of our study is to understand the change of body representation in patients affected by Acquired Brain Injury (ABI), undergoing a program that integrates psychological and nutritional support. Forty patients with ABI diagnosis were enrolled in this study and randomized into either the control (CG:n = 20) or the experimental (EG:n = 20) group. The EG underwent psychological counselling (PC) focused on the perception of body schema and on the reduction of depressive symptoms as well as a Nutritional Counselling (NC) in which all patients had a personalized nutritional plan, based on their needs once a week for 6 months. In contrast, the CG received only a nutritional treatment. Results show that the combined PC-NC approach encouraged change in body representation, the reconstruction of body image and improved mood. In conclusion, our data demonstrates that patients with ABI undergoing the combined approach can improve the perception of their body schema, mood and therapeutic compliance.",Hepatitis C virus (HCV) related liver fibrosis in people who inject drugs (PWID) at the Stockholm Needle Exchange - evaluated with liver elasticity.,https://www.ncbi.nlm.nih.gov/pubmed/30907178,Scandinavian journal of gastroenterology,2019 05 22,"Background and aims: Sharing of unsterile injection equipment among people who inject drugs (PWID) is the major transmission-route for hepatitis C (HCV). HCV is highly prevalent in PWID in the Stockholm needle exchange programme (NEP). The frequency of advanced liver fibrosis among the participants is, however, unknown. Methods: From December 2016 to April 2018, all participants with chronic hepatitis C infection (CHC) were offered liver fibrosis evaluation at the Stockholm NEP, including liver stiffness measurement (LSM), a medical history and expanded blood tests to evaluate APRI and FIB-4 scores. Results: A total of 2037 individuals were enrolled of whom 964 (47.3%) had CHC. LSM was performed in 203 (21.1%) of eligible participants of whom 85% had mild fibrosis (LSM ≤9.4 kPa) and 15% advanced fibrosis (LSM ≥9.5 kPa). APRI >1 and FIB-4 > 3.25 only identified 30% of participants with advanced fibrosis. However, all 31(100%) participants with advanced fibrosis were detected when APRI >1 was combined with an age of ≥40 years and an injection drug use (IDU) duration of ≥15 years. Conclusions: We found that the diagnostic work-up for advanced fibrosis can be simplified with this combination of easily available factors. This allows identification of PWID in need of immediate HCV treatment to prevent further disease progression. Furthermore, LSM can be avoided among PWID with mild fibrosis, identified by age <40 years combined with IDU duration of <15 years and APRI score <1. This strategy enhances the HCV care cascade where LSM is not easily available, and will thus facilitate HCV treatment initiation.",Novel immunotherapeutic approaches for hepatocellular carcinoma treatment.,https://www.ncbi.nlm.nih.gov/pubmed/30907177,Expert review of clinical pharmacology,2019 05 16,"The introduction of immune checkpoint inhibitors has been lately proposed for the treatment of hepatocellular carcinoma (HCC) with respect to other cancer types. Several immunotherapeutic approaches are now under evaluation for HCC treatment including: i) antibodies acting as immune checkpoint inhibitors; ii) antibodies targeting specific tumor-associated antigens; iii) chimeric antigen receptor redirected T (CAR-T) cells targeting specific tumor-associated antigens; iv) vaccination strategies with tumor-specific epitopes. Areas covered: The review provides a wide description of the clinical trials investigating the efficacy of the main immunotherapeutic approaches proposed for the treatment of patients affected by HCC. Expert opinion: The balancing between immunostimulative and immunosuppressive factors in the context of HCC tumor microenvironment results in heterogeneous response rates to immunotherapeutic approaches such as checkpoint inhibitors, among HCC patients. In this context, it becomes crucial the identification of predictive factors determining the treatment response. A multiple approach using different biomarkers could be useful to identify the subgroup of HCC patients responsive to the treatment with a checkpoint inhibitor (as an example, nivolumab) as single agent, and to identify those patients in which other treatment regimens, such as the combination with sorafenib, or with locoregional therapies, could be more effective.",Timing treatment for smoldering myeloma: is earlier better?,https://www.ncbi.nlm.nih.gov/pubmed/30907176,Expert review of hematology,2019 05 03,"In 2014, the International Myeloma Working Group determined that patients with ultra-high-risk smoldering multiple myeloma (SMM) should be considered for treatment as per patients with symptomatic multiple myeloma (MM), despite not having CRAB (hyperCalcemia, Renal insufficiency, Anemia, Bone disease) symptoms. Current research is elucidating whether patients with high-risk, and even intermediate-risk, SMM could benefit from early therapeutic strategies aimed at delaying progression to active MM and prolonging survival. Areas covered: The authors conducted a systematic literature search using PubMed to identify a series of patients with SMM in which prognostic and predictive factors for progression were investigated, plus the main clinical trials in SMM. Additionally, a search of active clinical trials in SMM was conducted at ClinicalTrials.gov. Expert opinion: Patients with high-risk SMM can benefit from active treatment strategies, which may prolong survival and, perhaps, provide a possible path to cure. Enabled by the limited toxicity of new drugs investigated in MM, this approach, together with consolidation with autologous transplantation, is under investigation by American and European groups. In patients with high-risk SMM who are not candidates for transplantation, combinations of oral drugs may prolong time to progression.

The pathogenesis of CKD-associated anemia is multifactorial. Our understanding of the molecular control of iron metabolism has improved dramatically because of the discovery of hepcidin and attempts to introduce new drugs to stimulate erythropoiesis or affect the hepcidin-ferroportin pathway have recently emerged. Areas covered: We examine the possible role of hepcidin in iron metabolism and regulation and the potential therapeutic options involving hepcidin and hepcidin-ferroportin axis in renal anemia treatment. We focus on therapeutic targeting of hepcidin, the hepcidin-ferroportin axis and key molecules such as anti-hepcidin antibodies, spigelmers, and anticalins. We also discuss compounds affecting the bone morphogenetic protein receptor [BMP/BMPR] complex and molecules that influence hepcidin, such as hypoxia-inducible factor 1 stabilizers. Expert opinion: Hepcidin is a key regulator of iron availability and is a potential future therapeutic target for managing anemia that is associated with CKD. There are potential risks and benefits associated with novel sophisticated therapies and there are several novel options on the horizon; however, clinical data are currently limited and need development. Inhibition of hepcidin via various pathways might be a viable adjunctive therapeutic option in other clinical situations.",The risk of endometriosis after exposure to endocrine-disrupting chemicals: a meta-analysis of 30 epidemiology studies.,https://www.ncbi.nlm.nih.gov/pubmed/30907174,Gynecological endocrinology : the official journal of the International Society of Gynecological Endocrinology,2019 03 25,"Endocrine-disrupting chemicals (EDCs) are suspected to be associated with endometriosis (EMs). This study aimed to synthesize published data and evaluate the relationship between four classic EDCs exposure and the risk of EMs. A systematic literature search for original peer reviewed papers was performed in the databases PubMed, EMBASE, and Web of Science based on inclusion criteria up to January 2018. Subsequently, a total of 20 papers conducting 30 studies fulfilled the eligibility criteria and were included in this meta-analysis (four studies for bisphenol A (BPA), 12 studies for polychlorinated biphenyls (PCBs), eight studies for organochlorine pesticides (OCPs), and six studies for phthalate esters (PAEs)). The overall odds ratio (OR) across all exposures and EMs was 1.41 (95% confidence interval (CI): 1.23-1.60).

The current meta-analysis strengthens the evidence that specific EDCs or their metabolites may promote the occurrence of EMs.","Translation, inter-rater reliability, agreement, and internal consistency of the Spanish version of the cumulated ambulation score in patients after hip fracture.",https://www.ncbi.nlm.nih.gov/pubmed/30907173,Disability and rehabilitation,2019 03 25,"To translate the Cumulated Ambulation Score into Spanish, and to examine its inter-rater reliability, agreement and internal consistency.",Blood platelet function abnormalities in cirrhotic patients with esophageal varices in relation to the variceal bleeding history.,https://www.ncbi.nlm.nih.gov/pubmed/30907172,Scandinavian journal of gastroenterology,2019 05 22,"Objective: The study aimed at assessing the effect of thrombocytopenia and platelet function abnormalities on the occurrence of variceal bleeding in patients with cirrhosis. Methods: The results of impedance aggregometry, von Willebrand factor antigen level and thromboelastometry (TEM) with and without the addition of a platelet inhibitor (FIBTEM®, EXTEM® test, respectively) were compared in two patient groups: Group 1 (n = 32) - patients with moderate or large esophageal or gastric varices, who had never had symptoms of acute gastrointestinal bleeding and Group 2 (n = 26) - patients with history of variceal bleeding. Results: Standard clotting test indicated more hypocoagulable profile in Group 2 compared to Group 1. However, no differences in any TEM component were observed between groups in EXTEM® test. The contribution of platelets to clot strength was significantly higher in Group 2 than in Group 1 [PLT% = 74.2 (67.5-80.4) versus 68.8 (63.7-76.5) %; p = .039]. The aggregation index was also higher in Group 2 compared to Group 1, although not statistically significant [% of healthy = 96.9 (73.2-140.1) versus 67.6 (52.5-118.8) %, p = .195]. No differences in vWF antigen levels were observed between groups. Conclusions: The results of thromboelastometry and aggregometry indicate increased contribution of platelets in clot formation in patients with a history of variceal bleeding compared to cirrhotic patients who never bled. Comparable effectiveness of hemostasis in both groups is most likely associated with the compensatory role of platelets. Increased platelet activity in this group of patients is probably due to a mechanism independent of the von Willebrand factor antigen level.",Mobility and medical service dogs: a qualitative analysis of expectations and experiences.,https://www.ncbi.nlm.nih.gov/pubmed/30907171,Disability and rehabilitation.

Gallic acid (GA) is an important phenolic compound, which could protect different tissues from oxidative stress induced damage. The present study investigated effects of GA against sodium arsenite (SA)-induced renal and hepatic toxicity. Thirty-five rats were randomly divided in to five groups; group 1 was treated with normal saline (2 ml/kg/day, p.o.; for 21 days); group 2 was exposed to SA (10 mg/kg/day, p.o.; for 14 days); groups 3 and 4 were treated with GA (10 and 30 mg/kg/day, respectively; for 7 days) prior to exposure to SA, and treatment was continued up to 21 days in parallel with SA administration; group 5 was treated with GA (30 mg/kg/day, p.o.; for 21 days). The level of MDA, IL-1β, NO and glutathione (GSH) and the activity of glutathione peroxidase (GPx), superoxide dismutase (SOD) and catalase (CAT) were evaluated in kidney and liver tissues. Histopathological parameters and serum levels of ALT, AST, ALP, Cr and BUN were also assessed. Treatment with GA remarkably improved SA-induced alteration of hematological and histopathological parameters; these protective effects were associated with the reduction of SA-induced elevation of MDA, IL-1β and NO levels as well as reduction of GSH level and GPx, SOD and CAT activity. Our results suggest that GA may inhibit SA-induced kidney and liver toxicity through scavenging reactive free radicals and increasing intracellular antioxidant capacity.",Modified semantic feature analysis for anomia: a single case study.,https://www.ncbi.nlm.nih.gov/pubmed/30907157,Clinical linguistics & phonetics,2019 03 25,"Semantic feature analysis (SFA) is a treatment approach designed for patients with lexical retrieval difficulty caused by semantic deficits. During training, a structured framework (e.g. requiring the patient to name the category, function, and colour of the target items) is usually provided to facilitate the patient in thinking of the semantic features of the target items. Nevertheless, the use of a structured framework potentially limits the variety of semantic features activated for lexical retrieval. This study investigated the effectiveness of modified SFA training to address this potential limitation. An odd-man-out task was carried out in the modified SFA training with an anomic patient with impaired access to the phonological output lexicon. The task aimed to encourage a detailed comparison of semantic features among items in the same category. It is hypothesized that activations of more distinctive semantic features belonging to the target items will result in greater extent of generalizations in the lexical processing. The patient's abilities in naming semantic features at the beginning and at the end of each treatment session were compared. Besides, accuracy and error patterns in oral and written naming in the initial and post-treatment assessment were also compared. The results showed a significant increase in the number of semantic features retrieved within treatment sessions. Moreover, a significant improvement in oral picture naming was also observed subsequent to the modified SFA training. Finally, the results of the error analyses further supported that the modified SFA was effective in promoting overall lexical processing. The findings indicated that both quantity and distinctiveness of concepts activated in the semantic system are essential to effective lexical retrieval. Theoretical and clinical implications were also discussed.",Modified motor vehicles: the experiences of drivers with disabilities.,https://www.ncbi.nlm.nih.gov/pubmed/30907156,Disability and rehabilitation,2019 03 25,"Driving is often a rehabilitation goal of people with acquired disability, and vehicle modifications are typically required to facilitate this outcome.

Genetic testing for C9orf72 expansions in patients with ALS and/or FTD and their relatives has become increasingly available since hexanucleotide repeat expansions were first reported in 2011. The repeat number is highly variable and the threshold at which repeat size leads to neurodegeneration remains unknown. We present the case of an ALS patient who underwent genetic testing through our Motor Neurone Disease Clinic. We highlight current limitations to analysing and interpreting C9orf72 expansion test results and describe how this resulted in discordant reports of pathogenicity between testing laboratories that confounded the genetic counselling process. We conclude that patients with ALS or FTD and their at-risk family members, need to be adequately counselled about the limitations of current knowledge to ensure they are making informed decisions about genetic testing for C9orf72.

Therefore, shallow, artesian and thermal groundwaters of the investigated aquifer along with rainfall and rivers were analysed using (MC) ICP-MS. The n(87Sr)/n(86Sr) ratio and elemental pattern changed with aquifer depth as a result of progressing bedrock leaching and dissolution with increasing groundwater residence time. The n(87Sr)/n(86Sr) ratio of shallow groundwater below saline ponds of 0.71019 ± 0.00044 was significantly different from thermal groundwater of 0.71205 ± 0.00035 (U, k = 2). In contrast to previous theories, this result suggested no recharge of saline ponds by upwelling paleo-seawater. Isotope pattern deconvolution revealed that rainfall accounted to about 60% of the n(87Sr)/n(86Sr) ratio of shallow groundwater below saline ponds. The δ88Sr/86SrSRM987 values of groundwater decreased from about 0.25 ‰ in most shallow, to predominantly negative values of about -0.24 ‰ in artesian groundwater. This result indicated leaching and dissolution of weathered minerals. In turn, the δ88Sr/86SrSRM987 of deep thermal groundwater showed positive values of about 0.12 ‰, which suggested removal of 86Sr from solution by carbonate precipitation. These results highlight the potential of δ88Sr/86SrSRM987 signature as an additional geochemical tracer.",A light in the dark: state of the art and perspectives in optogenetics and optopharmacology for restoring vision.,https://www.ncbi.nlm.nih.gov/pubmed/30907134,Future medicinal chemistry,2019 04 05,"In the last decade, innovative therapeutic strategies against inherited retinal degenerations (IRDs) have emerged. In particular, chemical- and opto-genetics approaches or a combination of them have been identified for modulating neuronal/optical activity in order to restore vision in blinding diseases. The 'chemical-genetics approach' (optopharmacology) uses small molecules (exogenous photoswitches) for restoring light sensitivity by activating ion channels. The 'opto-genetics approach' employs light-activated photosensitive proteins (exogenous opsins), introduced by viral vectors in injured tissues, to restore light response. These approaches offer control of neuronal activities with spatial precision and limited invasiveness, although with some drawbacks.

Dysphagia has been shown to be associated with longer mealtime duration, and the use of texture-modified diets has been associated with reduced nutritional intake. The current study aimed to determine if the degree of diet modification affected mealtime duration and to examine the correlation between texture-modified diets and dysphagia risk. Data were collected from 639 LTC residents, aged 62-102 years. Nine meal observations per resident provided measures of meal duration, consistencies consumed, coughing and choking, and assistance provided. Dysphagia risk was determined by identifying residents who coughed/choked at meals, were prescribed thickened fluids, and/or failed a formal screening protocol. Degree of texture modification was derived using the International Dysphagia Diet Standardization Initiative Functional Diet Scale. There was a significant association between degree of diet modification and dysphagia risk (P < 0.001). However, there was no association between diet modifications and mealtime duration, even when the provision of physical assistance was considered. Some residents who presented with signs of swallowing difficulties were not prescribed a texture-modified diet. Swallowing screening should be performed routinely in LTC to monitor swallowing status and appropriateness of diet prescription. Physical assistance during meals should be increased.",Evaluation of Diffusional Kurtosis Imaging in Sub-acute Ischemic Stroke: Comparison with Rehabilitation Treatment Effect.,https://www.ncbi.nlm.nih.gov/pubmed/30907127,Cell transplantation,2019 03 25,"Stroke is a serious worldwide medical condition that causes neurological function disability. Diffusional kurtosis imaging, which measures the non-Gaussianity of water diffusion, has been demonstrated to be a sensitive biomarker in many neuro-pathologies. This study explores the relationship between neural function recovery and transformation of the ischemic lesion and/or corticospinal tract during the sub-acute phase after stroke by using diffusional kurtosis imaging. We performed a prospective study of function recovery and K metrics of 43 patients with sub-acute ischemic stroke in the middle cerebral artery territory. The effect of rehabilitation treatment was evaluated using both the Fugl-Meyer motor function score and modified Barthel index score at post-treatment compared with admission, and patients were allocated to two groups: good and poor rehabilitation effect (GRE and PRE). Metrics of diffusional kurtosis imaging within ischemic lesion and along the corticospinal tract were acquired, respectively. All three relative axial diffusional kurtoses (rKas) along the corticospinal tract in the GRE group ( n = 21) were significantly larger than those of the PRE group ( n = 22), including rKa in the posterior limb of internal capsule, rKa in the cerebral peduncle, and rKa in the basal part of the pons ( p = 0.014, 0.005, and 0.021, respectively). This multi-parametric magnetic resonance imaging study showed that diffusional kurtosis imaging has the potential to complement existing stroke imaging techniques and revealed its own advantages in elucidating the possible biophysical mechanism of functional restoration underlying ischemic stroke."

Analysis of soil F2 and F3 hydrocarbon fractions also revealed that these soils were remediated by inoculated plants when diesel was applied at 10,000 mg·kg-1 and 20,000 mg·kg-1. In addition, quantification of hydrocarbon-degrading genes suggests that all bacterial strains successfully colonized sweet clover plants.

Proposal for Hungarian application in clinical practice].,https://www.ncbi.nlm.nih.gov/pubmed/30907100,Orvosi hetilap,2019 03 25,"Invasive prenatal testing and conventional G-banding chromosome analysis have been considered to be the gold standard of fetal cytogenetic diagnosis. Standard karyotyping is, however, constrained by the limits of the resolution of using a microscope. The advantage of molecular karyotyping, array based methods is the evaluation of sub-microscopic copy number changes across the whole genome in a single analysis. The application of array comparative genome hybridization has greatly increased the detection of pathogenic chromosomal abnormalities in prenatal settings. Based on available data in the international literature of the last decade, the clinical utility of arrayCGH is the recognition of some 1-2% and 5-7% additional genetical information compared to metaphase karyotype alone in fetuses without ultrasound anomaly and in fetuses with ultrasonographically detected malformations, respectively. Thus arrayCGH improves the prenatal diagnosis of genetic abnormalities mainly in fetuses with structural sonographic findings. In the present paper we review the literature of chromosomal microarray and make a proposal for the application of the method in Hungarian prenatal genetical practice.

HBV surface antigen loss is considered a functional cure and is an ideal goal for antiviral therapy. However, current treatment regimens, including nucleos(t)ide analogues or interferons monotherapy and combination therapy, rarely achieve this goal in chronic hepatitis B patients. Nucleos(t)ide analogues (NAs), as well as many direct antiviral drugs in ongoing development, are able to inhibit HBV replication and gene expression, but it is hard to achieve immune control and prevent recurrence after therapy cessation. Host immunity, especially HBV-specific T cell response, is proven to play a critical role in control or clearance of HBV infection. Considering HBV chronically infected patients display varying degrees of dysfunction regarding their immune system, novel approaches to enhancing antiviral immune responses are necessary in order to combine with current antiviral agents. In this Review, we focus on the role of innate and adaptive immune responses in HBV immunopathogenesis and discuss attractive strategies or drugs that aim to activate or rebuild antiviral immunity to achieve the goal of an HBV functional cure.",Concise Modular Synthesis of Thalassotalic Acids A-C.,https://www.ncbi.nlm.nih.gov/pubmed/30907079,Journal of natural products,2019 04 26,"The novel N-acyldehydrotyrosine analogues known as thalassotalic acids A-C were isolated from a marine bacterium by Deering et al. in 2016.

Thus, deciphering new molecular targets and pathways is essential for enhancing the radiosensitivity of NPC. SALL4 is a vital factor in the development and prognosis of various cancers, but its role in radioresistance remains elusive. This study aimed to explore the association of SALL4 expression with radioresistance of NPC. It was revealed that SALL4 expression was closely correlated with advanced T classification of NPC patients. Inhibition of SALL4 reduced proliferation and sensitized cells to radiation both in vitro and in vivo. Furthermore, SALL4 silencing increased radiation-induced DNA damage, apoptosis, and G2/M arrest in CNE2 and CNE2R cells. Moreover, knockdown of SALL4 impaired the expression of p-ATM, p-Chk2, p-p53, and anti-apoptosis protein Bcl-2, while pro-apoptosis protein was upregulated. These findings indicate that SALL4 could induce radioresistance via ATM/Chk2/p53 pathway and its downstream proteins related to apoptosis.

The soft robot is actuated by a muscular tail fin that emulates the swimming of whales and works as a cellular engine powered by the synchronized contraction of striated cardiac microtissue constructs. For a transition of locomotive behavior, the robot can be optically triggered to transform from a spread to a retracted form, which effectively changes the bending stiffness of the tail fins, thus minimizing the propulsion output from the ""tail fin"" and effectively switching off the engine.

Given the important implications for plant population conservation, we tested the hypothesis that artificial pollen transfer (hand-pollination) and outbreeding between populations increases fruit set and seed germination percentage. The background fruit set and in vitro germination rates were determined for ten reference populations. An artificial cross-pollination experiment included (a) pollen transfer from one large population to two small and isolated populations; (b) pollen transfer between two small but not isolated populations; (c) within-population pollen transfer (control). All seeds were sown on a modified Malmgren's medium and cultured in a controlled environment. Germination percentage was compared using a Kruskal-Wallis anova. The background fruit set (mean = 18%) and germination (<5%) rates were consistently low across populations. Fruit set after hand-pollination was consistently 100%. Pollen transfer from the largest population to smaller populations resulted in an increase in total germination ranging from 0.9% to 2.9%. The largest increase in germination occurred between small-sized and less isolated populations (from 1.7% to 5.1%). The results of pollen transfer between the small populations are particularly encouraging, as the mean increase in germination was almost four times that of the control.

Therefore, the purpose of this study is to elucidate a novel electrospun gelatin nonwoven mat (NWM) for epithelial tissue engineering purposes in vivo. This NWM was seeded with either human gingival keratinocytes (GK, in coculture with gingival fibroblast) or human skin epithelial keratinocytes (EK, in coculture with skin dermal fibroblasts). These constructs were ex vivo cultured for 4 days before subcutaneous implantation into athymic nude mice. After 7 days, the constructs were explanted and investigated by immunohistology. Our results show that GK form a stratified epithelium on the surface of the NWM, mostly independent of a fibroblastic counterpart. Like native mucosa, the regenerated epithelium showed expression of epidermal growth factor receptor, cytokeratin-14 and -1, and involucrin. Only the expression of the basement membrane constituent laminin 5 was more pronounced in cocultures. Comparing GK and skin EK, we found that skin EK form a less developed epithelial tissue. Furthermore, the NWM allows not only for epithelial tissue formation by GK, but also for infiltration of human fibroblasts and mouse immune cells, thus representing a biomaterial with potential regenerative capacity for oral mucosa tissue engineering applications. © 2019 Wiley Periodicals, Inc.

Here, we used functional MRI to study resting state connectivity in rats following chronic intermittent exposure to ethanol. Further, we evaluated the effects of SB-277011-a, a selective dopamine D3 receptor antagonist, known to decrease ethanol consumption. Alcohol-dependent and control rats (N = 13/14 per group), 3 weeks into abstinence, were administered SB-277011-a or vehicle before fMRI sessions. Resting state connectivity networks were extracted by independent component analysis. A dual-regression analysis was performed using independent component maps as spatial regressors, and the effects of alcohol history and treatment on connectivity were assessed. A history of alcohol dependence caused widespread reduction of the internal coherence of components. Weaker correlation was also found between the insula cortex (IC) and cingulate cortices, key constituents of the salience network. Similarly, reduced connectivity was observed between a component comprising the anterior insular cortex, together with the caudate putamen (CPu-AntIns), and the posterior part of the IC. On the other hand, postdependent rats showed strengthened connectivity between salience and reward networks. In particular, higher connectivity was observed between insula and nucleus accumbens, between the ventral tegmental area and the cingulate cortex and between the VTA and CPu-AntIns. Interestingly, aberrant connectivity in postdependent rats was partially restored by acute administration of SB-277011-a, which, conversely, had no significant effects in naïve rats.",A Tandem Organic Solar Cell with PCE of 14.52% Employing Subcells with the Same Polymer Donor and Two Absorption Complementary Acceptors.,https://www.ncbi.nlm.nih.gov/pubmed/30907041,"Advanced materials (Deerfield Beach, Fla.)",2019 05 03,"The tandem structure is an efficient way to simultaneously tackle absorption and thermalization losses of the single junction solar cells.

The two subcells show high Voc with value of 0.99 V for the front cell and 0.86 V for the rear cell, which is the prerequisite for obtaining high Voc of their series-connected tandem device. Although there is much absorption overlap for the subcells, a decent Jsc of the tandem cell is still obtained owing to the complementary absorption of the two acceptors in a wide range. With systematic device optimizations, a best power conversion efficiency of 14.52% is achieved for the tandem device, with a high Voc of 1.82 V, a notable FF of 74.7%, and a decent Jsc of 10.68 mA cm-2 . This work demonstrates a promising strategy of fabricating high-efficiency tandem OSCs through elaborate selection of the active layer materials in each subcell and tradeoff of the Voc and Jsc of the tandem cells."

Canine endometrial adenocarcinomas are also rare in dogs and mainly affect geriatric females. This report describes the case of co-existing ovarian teratoma and uterine adenocarcinoma in a 10-year-old nulliparous female Boxer presented with lethargy, anorexia and purulent vaginal discharge. Abdominal ultrasonography evidenced pyometra and a mass in the left ovary. This was composed of a uniform whitish tissue with multiple cystic structures. The histology revealed an atrophy of the ovarian parenchyma, compressed by a proliferation of well-differentiated nervous tissue staining positively to vimentin, S100 and neuronal specific enolase (NSE), and negatively to keratin and inhibin. The left uterine horn, whose diameter was markedly increased, showed foci of endometrial cellular atypia, evident nucleoli and mitoses, at light microscopy.

Endometrial biopsies not only contain diseased glands, but also contain healthy glands and stroma. Myoepithelial (ME) and myofibroblastic (MF) markers are calponin, smooth muscle actin (SMA), desmin and glial fibrillary acidic protein (GFAP). Epithelial vimentin expression indicates epithelial to mesenchymal transition (EMT). The aim of this immunohistochemical study was to investigate whether biopsies with endometrosis express MF and ME markers and vimentin. Compared to healthy areas, significantly higher percentages of endometrotic glands were lined by calponin- and vimentin-positive epithelial cells, whereas periglandular fibrosis contained significantly higher percentages of stromal cells positive for vimentin, desmin and SMA and significantly less calponin-positive stromal cells. The rare GFAP expression was restricted to endometrotic glands. Of these, the most frequent features of endometrotic glands were higher percentages of SMA- and vimentin-positive stromal cells and the prominent epithelial calponin staining that occurred in 100%, 93% and 95% of examined biopsies. Results indicate plasticity of equine endometrial epithelial and stromal cells. Particularly, endometrotic glands show evidence for ME differentiation and EMT. The different expression of MF markers between stromal cells from healthy and endometrotic areas suggests functional differences. The characteristic changes in the expression of SMA, vimentin and calponin between endometrotic glands and healthy areas can be helpful to confirm early stages of endometrosis. The characterization of cellular differentiation may help to decipher the pathogenesis of endometrosis and could lead to therapeutic strategies.",Epicardial-endocardial breakthrough site ablation: Demonstration of alternative target for perimitral atrial tachycardia.,https://www.ncbi.nlm.nih.gov/pubmed/30907026,Journal of cardiovascular electrophysiology,2019 04 02,A 62-year-old man underwent the catheter ablation for persistent atrial tachycardia (AT) with a cycle length of 357 milliseconds. An ultrahigh resolution mapping revealed that this tachycardia was a clockwise perimitral AT despite the conduction was apparently blocked across the lateral mitral isthmus line both at the endocardium and within the coronary sinus. The AT was terminated by the single radiofrequency application at the site below the mitral isthmus line where the endocardial activation breakout was seen. This case suggests that the epicardial-endocardial conduction breakthrough site may be an alternative ablation target in a difficult ablation case of perimitral AT.,"Evaluation of ameliorating effect of lycopene against testicular toxicity due to diethylnitrosamine using biochemical, spermatological and histopathological data.",https://www.ncbi.nlm.nih.gov/pubmed/30907024,Andrologia,2019 06 03,"The aim of this study was to evaluate the possible therapeutic or protective effects of lycopene on diethylnitrosamine (DEN)-induced testicular lipid peroxidation and on the associated changes in spermatological parameters and histopathological architecture of rat testis. DEN is a carcinogenic substance that can be derived from chemicals used in agriculture, such as insecticides and nitrate. The rats were assigned to control, lycopene, DEN(1), DEN(2), lycopene + DEN(1), lycopene + DEN(2), DEN(1) + lycopene and DEN(2) + lycopene groups. During the study, lycopene was administered by oral gavage at a dose of 10 mg kg-1  bw-1 every other day for 10 days and DEN was administered at a dose of 200 mg  kg-1  bw-1 as a single dose intraperitoneally. DEN was applied for 30 days in group DEN(1) and for 90 days in group DEN(2). Malondialdehyde (MDA) and reduced glutathione (GSH) levels, antioxidant enzymes activities, spermatological parameters, the weight of the reproductive organs (v. seminalis, prostate, testis and epididymis) and the histopathological structure were determined. MDA levels significantly increased, while GSH and antioxidant enzymes' activities decreased in DEN groups (p < 0.001). There was an increase in the rate of abnormal spermatozoa and a decrease in sperm density and motility, and reproductive organ weight (the weight of the right and left testis) in both DEN groups. Lycopene has normalised biochemical and spermatological parameters and reproductive organ weight. The histopathological examination of testicular tissue showed that the most significant histopathological change in DEN groups was the seminiferous tubule dilatation. These results suggest that besides the protective effects, the therapeutic effect of lycopene is possibly due to its antioxidant effects on DEN-induced testicular toxicity.",Telmisartan protects against high glucose/high lipid-induced apoptosis and insulin secretion by reducing the oxidative and ER stress.,https://www.ncbi.nlm.nih.gov/pubmed/30907023,Cell biochemistry and function,2019 05 08,"Telmisartan, an angiotensin II receptor blocker, has been widely used for hypertension. It has also been reported to improve insulin sensitivity in animal models of obesity and diabetic patients by targeting to the peroxisome proliferator-activated receptor (PPAR)-γ. High glucose/high lipid (HG/HL)-induced apoptosis of pancreatic β-cells impairs its function of insulin secretion and is generally believed to be the key factor in the development of diabetes. In this study, we investigated whether telmisartan exerted a protective effect against HG/HL-induced apoptosis and insulin secretion in vitro as well as in vivo; 10-μM telmisartan treatment significantly reduced HG (25 mM) or/and HL (0.4 mM palmitic acid) induced-cell apoptosis and greatly improved insulin secretion in INS-1 pancreatic β-cells, which is consistent in an obesity rat model induced by HG/HL diets. Furthermore, telmisartan treatment markedly reduced the protein level of GRP78, CHOP, and caspase 12, while increasing anti-apoptotic Bcl-2 protein expression. Moreover, telmisartan treatment significantly reduced intracellular ROS levels. Mechanistically, we demonstrated that PPARγ signaling pathway may be involved in the telmisartan protective effects, which were blocked by a PPARγ blocker, GW9662. In conclusion, the protective effect of telmisartan was mediated by an anti-ER stress-induced apoptotic and anti-oxidative pathway. SIGNIFICANCE OF THIS STUDY: Type 2 diabetes mellitus (T2DM) is a chronic metabolic disorder worldwide pathologically characterized by hyperglycemia and insulin resistance. Long-term high glucose in the blood has been proposed to induce pancreatic β-cell loss and is generally believed to be the key factor in the development of diabetes. In the present study, we demonstrated that telmisartan, a common drug used for hypertension treatment, has a protective effect against high glucose/high lipid-induced cell apoptosis and greatly improves the insulin secretion function by inhibiting the oxidative stress and ER stress. Furthermore, this protective effect of telmisartan is mediated by the PPAR-γ signal pathway, which may provide a potential strategy against T2DM.",Treatment of benign cephalic histiocytosis with topical 1% rapamycin ointment.,https://www.ncbi.nlm.nih.gov/pubmed/30907021,Pediatric dermatology,2019 05 17,"We report a pediatric case of extensive, progressive benign cephalic histiocytosis (BCH) involving the face, trunk, and extremities with response of facial lesions to treatment with topical 1% rapamycin.

Our objectives were to investigate the extent of fluvalinate contamination in commercially available wax and to define exposure pathways to larval and adult honey bees. All the commercial wax tested contained elevated fluvalinate concentrations, indicating a need for regulation of the sources of wax being rendered for resale. Based on the negative logarithm of the partition coefficient between wax and pollen (-0.54), it is evident that fluvalinate has the potential to actively transfer from the contaminated wax into hive matrices. This was confirmed by adding fluvalinate-dosed wax, fluvalinate-impregnated strips, or a combination of the 2 to hives. Larvae and adult bees were checked for fluvalinate exposure using gas chromatography-mass spectrometry analysis. Larvae had detectable concentrations of fluvalinate in all treatments. Bioaccumulation in adult bees was significantly affected by the interaction between treatment type and application time. In other words, residues from hives that only had fluvalinate-dosed wax were comparable to residues in hives that were actively being treated, suggesting that transfer of fluvalinate from wax into adult bees was an important exposure route. In conclusion, exposure of fluvalinate from contaminated wax and treatment strips to honey bees needs to be considered when the risk for colony loss in hives is being evaluated.

A total of 15 ejaculates from five adult llama males (n = 5; r = 3) were evaluated. A significant decrease in sperm motility, viability, membrane function and intact acrosomes was observed in thawed samples (0%, 10% and 50%) when compared to raw semen. Neither morphology nor chromatin condensation was altered in all thawed samples (p > 0.05), but a significant increase (p < 0.05) in the percentage of spermatozoa with fragmented DNA was observed after thawing all samples compared to raw semen. Higher percentages of total and progressive sperm motility were observed when 0% and 10% of seminal plasma were used compared to 50%. However, no statistical differences were established for sperm viability, membrane function, morphology, acrosome status and DNA quality between thawed treatments. To conclude, neither of the percentages of seminal plasma used showed superiority nor cryoprotective effect on llama sperm survival."

Since symptoms overlap significantly, it is common for patients' presentations to be attributed to one disease alone, and for the other to be overlooked. The effect of COPD and CVD goes beyond the shared risk factors of smoking and advancing age. The presence of COPD adversely affects cardiac disease and vice versa. In comparison to individuals with one disease alone, those with both conditions have a higher mortality rate, experience more frequent exacerbations with more hospitalisations and have worse quality of life. More patients with mild and moderate COPD die from CVD than from COPD, and there is a higher rate of arrhythmias, particularly atrial fibrillation. Accurate and timely diagnosis is therefore crucial. Retrospective evidence indicates that individuals with COPD and CVD may have better outcomes with appropriate CVD pharmacotherapy, yet robust prospective evidence is lacking. Inhaled medications for patients with stable COPD improve quality of life and reduce exacerbations, but there is limited evidence that they reduce mortality.

One of the largest contributions to predictive uncertainty for hyporheic exchange has been attributed to the representation of heterogeneous subsurface properties. Our study evaluates the trade-offs between intrinsic (irreducible) and epistemic (reducible) model errors when choosing between homogeneous and highly complex subsurface parameter structures. We modeled the Steinlach River Test Site in Southwest Germany using a fully coupled surface water-groundwater model to simulate hyporheic exchange and to assess the predictive errors and uncertainties of transit time distributions. A highly parameterized model was built, treated as a ""virtual reality"" and used as a reference. We found that if the parameter structure is too simple, it will be limited by intrinsic model errors. By increasing subsurface complexity through the addition of zones or heterogeneity, we can begin to exchange intrinsic for epistemic errors. Thus, the appropriate level of detail to represent the subsurface depends on the acceptable range of intrinsic structural errors for the given modeling objectives and the available site data. We found that a zonated model is capable of reproducing the transit time distributions of a more detailed model, but only if the geological structures are known. An interpolated heterogeneous parameter field (cf. pilot points) showed the best trade-offs between the two errors, indicating fitness for practical applications. Parameter fields generated by multiple-point geostatistics (MPS) produce transit time distributions with the largest uncertainties, however, these are reducible by additional hydrogeological data, particularly flux measurements.",Parental longevity and survival among patients with multiple myeloma and monoclonal gammopathy of undetermined significance: a population-based study.,https://www.ncbi.nlm.nih.gov/pubmed/30906990,British journal of haematology,2019 04 04,"Parental longevity is associated with an increased life expectancy; results with regard to specific diseases are conflicting.

Among MM patients, parental longevity was associated with a decreased risk of death [hazard ratio (HR) = 0·92, 95% confidence interval (CI) 0·84-0·99] and the same was true for MGUS patients (HR = 0·87, 95% CI 0·78-0·96). Having one long lived parent significantly decreased the risk of death in both groups, but was not statistically significant when both parents exceeded 90 years of age.

However, chemical pretreatments on agro-stovers generate inhibitors that repress the subsequent lactic acid fermentation. In this study, three bacterial strains (Enterococcus faecalis B101, Acinetobacter calcoaceticus C1, and Pseudomonas aeruginosa CS) isolated from dye-polluted soils could utilize phenolic inhibitor mimics (vanillin, 4- hydroxybenzaldehyde, or syringaldehyde) from alkaline pretreated corn stovers as a sole carbon source. Lactic acid titer increased from 27.42 g/L (Bacillus coagulans LA204 alone) to 44.76 g/L (CS and LA204) using 50 g/L glucose with 1 g/L 4-hydroxybenzaldehyde added. Lactic acid production from 50 g/L ammonia pretreated corn stover was increased nearly twofold by inoculating phenolic degradation bacteria and lactic acid bacteria (C1& Lactobacillus pentosus FL0421). In the control (FL0421 alone), only 16.98 g/L of lactic acid was produced. The isolated and identified strains degraded the phenolic compounds and increased the lactic acid production from glucose and ammonia pretreated corn stover. These characteristics of the strains support industrial application with efficient in situ detoxification of phenolic compounds during lactic acid production from agro-stovers using simultaneous saccharification and fermentation (SSF).",Potential Circadian Rhythms in Oligodendrocytes? Working Together Through Time.,https://www.ncbi.nlm.nih.gov/pubmed/30906970,Neurochemical research,2019 04 26,"Oligodendrocytes (OL) are the only myelinating cells of the central nervous system thus interferences, either environmental or genetic, with their maturation or function have devastating consequences. Albeit so far neglected, one of the less appreciated, nevertheless possible, regulators of OL maturation and function is the circadian cycle. Yet, disruptions in these rhythms are unfortunately becoming a common ""disorder"" in the today's world. The temporal patterning of behaviour and physiology is controlled by a circadian timing system based in the anterior hypothalamus. At the molecular level, circadian rhythms are generated by a transcriptional/translational feedback system that regulates transcription and has a major impact on cellular function(s). Fundamental cellular properties/functions in most cell types vary with the daily circadian cycle: OL are unlikely an exception! To be clear, the presence of circadian oscillators or the cell-specific function(s) of the circadian clock in OL has yet to be defined. Furthermore, we wish to entertain the idea of links between the ""thin"" evidence on OL intrinsic circadian rhythms and their interjection(s) at different stages of lineage progression as well as in supporting/regulating OL crucial function: myelination. Individuals with intellectual and developmental syndromes as well as neurodegenerative diseases present with a disrupted sleep/wake cycle; hence, we raise the possibility that these disturbances in timing can contribute to the loss of white matter observed in these disorders.

This variation complicates the interpretation of preference results and the comparability of results across subgroups in a sample. This article highlights the potential consequences of ignoring variations in attribute importance measures, and makes the case for reporting more clearly how these measures are obtained and calculated. Transparency in the calculations can clarify what conclusions are supported by the results, and help make more accurate and meaningful comparisons across subsamples.",Microfluidic device for the analysis of MDR cancerous cell-derived exosomes' response to nanotherapy.,https://www.ncbi.nlm.nih.gov/pubmed/30906967,Biomedical microdevices,2019 06 10,"Exosomes are membrane-enclosed extracellular vesicles which have been indicated as important biomarkers of cancerous cell functionality, such as multiple drug resistance (MDR). Nanoparticles based chemotherapy is a promising strategy to overcome MDR by interfering the production and composition of exosomes. Therefore, tumor-derived exosomes post-treatment by nanotherapy are implied to play critical roles of biomarkers on cancer MDR analysis. However, the efficient isolation of such exosomes from extracellular environment for their therapeutic response analysis remains challenging. In this study, we presented a microfluidic device featured exosome specific anti-CD63 immobilized ciliated micropillars, which were capable to isolate cancer-derived exosomes from cell culture medium. The captured exosomes can be recovered intact by dissolving the cilia on the micropillars using PBS soaking. Owing to the immobilized antibody in the microfluidic device, nearly 70% of exosome from the biofluid could be isolated. So the secreted exosomes of the MDR and ordinary human breast cancer cells pre-treated by free drug or nanotherapy could be isolated with high purity. The drug contents of the isolated exosomes were measured to analysis of the exosomal pathway response of MDR cells to different chemotherapeutic formulations. Such analyses and further definition of the biomarkers of these exosomes could benefit the future investigations of accurately and reliably determine design principle, functional activity, and mechanisms of nanotherapy for MDR overcoming.",Behavioral and psychological aspects of cluster headache: an overview.,https://www.ncbi.nlm.nih.gov/pubmed/30906966,Neurological sciences : official journal of the Italian Neurological Society and of the Italian Society of Clinical Neurophysiology,2019 05 16,"This paper overviews available literature addressing behavioral and psychological aspects of cluster headache.

Before these technological advances, knowledge of the pathogenesis of migraine was particularly based on clinical assessment. Complementary to clinical evaluation, conventional MRI provides both specific information for differential diagnosis (particularly if cortical or subcortical lesions are detected in the migrainous brain) and unsurpassable opportunities in migraine research. However, the correlations between brain structural and functional alterations and both the clinical manifestation of the disease and the individual history of the patient remains uncertain. Both quantitative and functional MR-based techniques have a great potential to better provide insights into human brain structures and possible links between brain areas and complex brain networks that could be involved in the pathophysiology of migraine. Morphometric and functional MRI approaches are contributing to better elucidate the mechanisms that underlie the pain mechanisms and functional adaptation in migraine patients. All these information support the view of migraine as a complex brain disorder involving different cortical and subcortical areas.",Sleep disorder-related headaches.,https://www.ncbi.nlm.nih.gov/pubmed/30906963,Neurological sciences : official journal of the Italian Neurological Society and of the Italian Society of Clinical Neurophysiology,2019 05 16,"Migraine with and without aura, cluster headache, hypnic headache, and paroxysmal hemicranias are each reported as intrinsically related to sleep. Chronic migraine, chronic tension-type headache, and medication overuse headache may cause sleep disturbance. Otherwise, both headache and sleep disorder may be manifestations of a same systemic dysfunction. There is a vicious cycle linking sleep disorders and migraine. The poor quality or poor duration of sleep could be a trigger of migraine attack and migraineurs with poor sleep reported a higher headache frequency. Moreover, coping behaviors of migraineurs (e.g., going to sleep early to relieve migraine attacks) can be factors precipitating and perpetuating sleep disturbances themselves. During cluster headache, patients report a poor quality of sleep correlated with the amount of daylight. In particular, it was demonstrated that melatonin levels have influences on cluster headache attacks. Concerning the pathophysiology of hypnic headache, it has been hypothesized a possible role of obstructive sleep apnea in triggering nocturnal attacks: an increased number of apnea episodes has been reported in hypnic headache patients, but a lack of a temporal correlation of headache attacks with the drop of oxygen saturation has been observed. Tension-type headache is the most common headache with sleep dysregulation (lack of sleep or oversleeping) frequently reported as a triggering factor for acute attacks: management of sleep disturbances seems crucial in this form of headache.",Some aspects on the pathophysiology of migraine and a review of device therapies for migraine and cluster headache.,https://www.ncbi.nlm.nih.gov/pubmed/30906962,Neurological sciences : official journal of the Italian Neurological Society and of the Italian Society of Clinical Neurophysiology,2019 05 20,"Migraine is a common, severe disease, affecting the brain and blood vessels, causing much pain, time missed from work and family, and severe disability. It affects approximately 12% of most Western populations studied and affects women three times more than men. Cluster headache is a much less common dysfunction of the hypothalamus, involving the sphenopalatine ganglion and other areas; it causes more frequent, shorter, and even more intense pain than migraine. The pain usually comes in cycles and is associated with ipsilateral autonomic features and associated with irritability and inability to stay still. It affects less than 0.1% of the population and is slightly more prevalent in men than women. Although we have some acute care and preventive medications for both types of headache, no treatment is optimal for each patient and some will not respond well or have significant adverse events to existing therapies.",The attentional cost of movement in multiple sclerosis.,https://www.ncbi.nlm.nih.gov/pubmed/30906960,"Journal of neural transmission (Vienna, Austria : 1996)",2019 05 07,"Individuals living with multiple sclerosis frequently have impairments in mobility. These impairments are more pronounced when they engage in a cognitively demanding mobility tasks (i.e., walking and talking, obstacle clearance, etc). Based in part on the attentional capacity model of movement, these impairments are suggested to result from greater attentional demands. Yet, this model has not been directly tested in neurological populations. The objective of the study was to determine whether individuals with multiple sclerosis have greater attentional cost of movement across a range of tasks. This study tested probe reaction times of 20 individuals with multiple sclerosis and 26 healthy controls in five different movement tasks. The tasks were specifically chosen to challenge the perceptual-motor system based on variations in static and dynamic balance requirements. Participants were asked to verbally respond as quickly as possible to randomly presented audio probes during motor performance. Task order was randomized, and average probe reaction time was calculated for each task. The results showed tasks requiring dynamic stability had greater probe reaction times in both healthy controls and individuals with multiple sclerosis. Furthermore, individuals with multiple sclerosis had longer probe reaction times across all tasks compared to healthy controls. Yet, there was no relationship between probe reaction times and performance during a complex walking scenario. The results indicate the attentional capacity model may be inadequate to explain cognitive-motor interaction in people with multiple sclerosis. Future studies should address the theoretical framework of cognitive-motor interaction, which may influence the design of interventions aimed at improving performance in individuals with MS.",Functional dysbiosis within dental plaque microbiota in cleft lip and palate patients.,https://www.ncbi.nlm.nih.gov/pubmed/30906959,Progress in orthodontics,2019 04 16,"Dental caries is a polymicrobial disease and prevalent among cleft lip and palate (CLP) patients, although their oral hygiene is well maintained.

A key component of AMI therapy is the timely reopening of occluded vessels to prevent further ischaemic damage to the myocardium. However, reperfusion of the ischaemic myocardium can itself trigger reperfusion injury causing up to 50% of the overall infarct size. In recent years, considerable research has been devoted to understanding the pathogenesis of ischaemia/reperfusion (I/R) injury and platelets have emerged as a major contributing factor. This review summarizes the role of platelets in the pathogenesis of I/R injury and highlights the potential of platelet-directed therapeutics to minimize cardiac I/R injury. Activated platelets infiltrate specifically into the ischaemic/reperfused myocardium and contribute to I/R injury by the formation of microthrombi, enhanced platelet-leucocyte aggregation, and the release of potent vasoconstrictor and pro-inflammatory molecules. This review demonstrates the benefits of platelet inhibition beyond their well-described anti-thrombotic effect and highlights the direct cardioprotective role of anti-platelet drugs. In particular, the inhibition of COX, the P2Y12 receptor and the GPIIb/IIIa receptor has demonstrated the potential to attenuate I/R injury. Moreover, targeting of drug candidates or regenerative cells to the activated platelets accumulated within the ischaemic/reperfused myocardium shows remarkable potential to protect the myocardium from I/R injury. Overall, activated platelets play a key role in the pathogenesis of I/R injury. Their direct inhibition as well as their use as epitopes for site-directed therapy is a unique and promising therapeutic approach for the prevention of I/R injury and ultimately the preservation of cardiac function.",Technical Note: Effects of age and confinement on pupillary light reflex in sows.,https://www.ncbi.nlm.nih.gov/pubmed/30906947,Journal of animal science,2019 05 03,"Pupillary reflex has been used as a method to examine psychological problems in human clinics and mental disease research. Intensive animal farming has been shown to lead to chronic stress resulting in depression; however, comparing with humans we lack an effective clinical method to clinically inspect these psychological problems in animals. The goal of this study was to investigate the effect of age and housing conditions (confined crates vs. group pens) on pupillary light reflex of sows to explore whether pupillary light reflex (PLR) can be used as an effective way to measure psychological state of farm animals. In total, 270 pregnant sows were selected for PLR testing and divided into 6 treatments (45 sows per treatment) of 2 different environments (group-housed pen and confined gestation crates) and 3 parities (1st, 3rd and 5th parities). Six selected pupil parameters: 1) latency of the pupil constriction onset (LAT); 2) the ratio of max and min pupil diameter (CON); 3 average constriction velocity (ACV); 4) maximum constriction velocity (MCV), 5) average dilation velocity (ADV); and 6) time of 75% recovery after constriction (T75) were examined. The results showed that there was no difference found in these PLR parameters between the breeds (P > 0.05) but the significant effects were found on LAT, CON, ACV and MCV by age (P < 0.01). The group housed sows had significantly higher CON, ACV and MCV than those in the confined crates (P < 0.05). In conclusion, the pupillary light reflex of the sows was not affected by breed but by age. The results also indicate that some of PLR parameters were sensitive to housing conditions and suggest that ACV and MCV have potential to be sensitive indicators in relation to the psychological problem of sows.",Cortical microstructure in the behavioural variant of frontotemporal dementia: looking beyond atrophy.,https://www.ncbi.nlm.nih.gov/pubmed/30906945,Brain : a journal of neurology,2019 04 06,"Cortical mean diffusivity has been proposed as a novel biomarker for the study of the cortical microstructure in Alzheimer's disease. In this multicentre study, we aimed to assess the cortical microstructural changes in the behavioural variant of frontotemporal dementia (bvFTD); and to correlate cortical mean diffusivity with clinical measures of disease severity and CSF biomarkers (neurofilament light and the soluble fraction beta of the amyloid precursor protein). We included 148 participants with a 3 T MRI and appropriate structural and diffusion weighted imaging sequences: 70 patients with bvFTD and 78 age-matched cognitively healthy controls. The modified frontotemporal lobar degeneration clinical dementia rating was obtained as a measure of disease severity. A subset of patients also underwent a lumbar puncture for CSF biomarker analysis. Two independent raters blind to the clinical data determined the presence of significant frontotemporal atrophy to dichotomize the participants into possible or probable bvFTD. Cortical thickness and cortical mean diffusivity were computed using a surface-based approach. We compared cortical thickness and cortical mean diffusivity between bvFTD (both using the whole sample and probable and possible bvFTD subgroups) and controls. Then we computed the Cohen's d effect size for both cortical thickness and cortical mean diffusivity. We also performed correlation analyses with the modified frontotemporal lobar degeneration clinical dementia rating score and CSF neuronal biomarkers. The cortical mean diffusivity maps, in the whole cohort and in the probable bvFTD subgroup, showed widespread areas with increased cortical mean diffusivity that partially overlapped with cortical thickness, but further expanded to other bvFTD-related regions. In the possible bvFTD subgroup, we found increased cortical mean diffusivity in frontotemporal regions, but only minimal loss of cortical thickness. The effect sizes of cortical mean diffusivity were notably higher than the effect sizes of cortical thickness in the areas that are typically involved in bvFTD. In the whole bvFTD group, both cortical mean diffusivity and cortical thickness correlated with measures of disease severity and CSF biomarkers. However, the areas of correlation with cortical mean diffusivity were more extensive. In the possible bvFTD subgroup, only cortical mean diffusivity correlated with the modified frontotemporal lobar degeneration clinical dementia rating. Our data suggest that cortical mean diffusivity could be a sensitive biomarker for the study of the neurodegeneration-related microstructural changes in bvFTD. Further longitudinal studies should determine the diagnostic and prognostic utility of this novel neuroimaging biomarker.","A Phase I Randomized Clinical Trial of Evidence-Based, Pragmatic Interventions to Improve Functional Recovery After Hospitalization in Geriatric Patients.",https://www.ncbi.nlm.nih.gov/pubmed/30906944,"The journals of gerontology.

A milk protein caseinate can be glycated with lactose through this Maillard reaction. In this study, two tryptic digests from the lactose-glycated caseinate and commercial caseinate were assessed and compared for their activities in the intestinal barrier function of a non-transformed small intestine epithelial cell line (IEC-6 cells) as a cell model, to assess if this glycation might have positive or negative impact on caseinate biofunctions. Cell treatment with the two digests led to promoted cell growth by 103.1-130.9 (24 h) or 106.4-133.2% (48 h). More importantly, the two digests improved intestinal epithelial barrier integrity, reflected by the increased trans-epithelial electrical resistance values of 109.0-123.6 (24 h) or 112.5-127.8% (48 h), decreased epithelial permeability by 75.1-94.4 (24 h) or 64.0-83.4% (48 h), reduced bacterial translocation in the cells, and exhibited higher antibacterial activity against Escherichia coli. Furthermore, the results from the conducted immuno-fluorescence, qPCR, and western-blot assays indicated that the two digests enhanced the expression levels of 6 tight junction proteins ZO-1, ZO-2, occludin, claudin-1, claudin-3, and claudin-4 in the cells. However, the data comparison results also showed that the lactose-glycated caseinate digest always showed lower efficiency than the caseinate digest to improve the intestinal epithelial barrier function of this cell model. Thus, the present results highlight that the Maillard-type lactose glycation of caseinate gives the resultant tryptic digest with impaired activities in the intestinal epithelial barrier function of this cell model, suggesting that another adverse effect of the Maillard reaction on food proteins should be reconsidered and revised.",Discrepancy between thermodynamic and kinetic stabilities of the tert-butanol hydrates and its implication for obtaining pharmaceutical powders by freeze-drying.,https://www.ncbi.nlm.nih.gov/pubmed/30906942,"Chemical communications (Cambridge, England)",2019 04 15,"The tert-butanol (TBA)-water system is studied in relation to increasing the efficiency of obtaining pharmaceutical powders by freeze-drying.

Compared with the conventional process, 3-DG and HMF were decreased by 5.91 mg kg-1 and 0.39 mg kg-1 in the brown milk base under the alternative browning process, and thereafter, 3-DG and HMF were decreased by 54.5% and 65.0% in BFM. Investigation into the formation of 3-DG, MGO, and HMF in different chemical models showed that different sugars lead to different Maillard reaction products and browning rates, contributing to the mitigation of 3-DG and HMF. Apart from the mitigation of unhealthy Maillard compounds, hydrolyzing lactose and avoiding the addition of external glucose make the alternative browning process a theoretical and practical basis for improving the quality and safety of BFM.",Manipulation of a ring-shaped beam via spatial self- and cross-phase modulation at lower intensity.,https://www.ncbi.nlm.nih.gov/pubmed/30906940,Physical chemistry chemical physics : PCCP,2019 04 05,"We report a tunable ring-shaped diffraction pattern via either nonlinear spatial self- or cross-phase modulation caused by the EIT-like effect in rubidium atomic vapor.

In the current paper, we describe a newer approach to improving memory: event segmentation training. Event segmentation is an encoding strategy in which individuals parse continuous activity into meaningful chunks. The ability to segment activity is associated with later memory for the events, but unfortunately, this segmentation ability declines with age. Importantly, interventions designed to improve event segmentation have resulted in memory improvements for both young and older adults. We will review these past experiments as well as some new event segmentation training work that uses older adults' semantic knowledge to improve their segmentation and episodic memory.

In order to measure model generalizability, CV quantifies out-of-sample predictive performance, and the CV preference goes to the model that predicted the out-of-sample data best. The advantages of CV include theoretic simplicity and practical feasibility. Despite its prominence, however, the limitations of CV are often underappreciated. Here, we demonstrate the limitations of a particular form of CV-Bayesian leave-one-out cross-validation or LOO-with three concrete examples. In each example, a data set of infinite size is perfectly in line with the predictions of a simple model (i.e., a general law or invariance). Nevertheless, LOO shows bounded and relatively modest support for the simple model. We conclude that CV is not a panacea for model selection.","Associations between multipollutant day types and select cardiorespiratory outcomes in Columbia, South Carolina, 2002 to 2013.",https://www.ncbi.nlm.nih.gov/pubmed/30906916,"Environmental epidemiology (Philadelphia, Pa.)",2019 03 29,Health studies of air pollution are increasingly aiming to study associations between air pollutant mixtures and health.,The Contribution of the Circadian Gene Bmal1 to Female Fertility and the Generation of the Preovulatory Luteinizing Hormone Surge.,https://www.ncbi.nlm.nih.gov/pubmed/30906911,Journal of the Endocrine Society,2019 03 29,"In rodents, the preovulatory LH surge is temporally gated, but the timing cue is unknown. Estrogen primes neurons in the anteroventral periventricular nucleus (AVPV) to secrete kisspeptin, which potently activates GnRH neurons to release GnRH, eliciting a surge of LH to induce ovulation. Deletion of the circadian clock gene Bmal1 results in infertility. Previous studies have found that Bmal1 knockout (KO) females do not display an LH surge at any time of day. We sought to determine whether neuroendocrine disruption contributes to the absence of the LH surge. Because Kiss1 expression in the AVPV is critical for regulating ovulation, we hypothesized that this population is disrupted in Bmal1 KO females. However, we found an appropriate rise in AVPV Kiss1 and Fos mRNA at the time of lights out in ovariectomized estrogen-treated animals, despite the absence of a measureable increase in LH. Furthermore, Bmal1 KO females have significantly increased LH response to kiss-10 administration, although the LH response to GnRH was unchanged. We then created Kiss1- and GnRH-specific Bmal1 KO mice to examine whether Bmal1 expression is necessary within either kisspeptin or GnRH neurons. We detected no significant differences in any measured reproductive parameter. Our results indicate that disruption of the hypothalamic regulation of fertility in the Bmal1 KO females is not dependent on endogenous clocks within either the GnRH or kisspeptin neurons.",Temporal Pattern of Electrical Stimulation is a New Dimension of Therapeutic Innovation.,https://www.ncbi.nlm.nih.gov/pubmed/30906909,Current opinion in biomedical engineering,2019 03 29,"Artificial activation of the nervous system requires selection of appropriate stimulation parameters including stimulation amplitude, stimulation pulse duration, and stimulation pulse repetition rate. The temporal pattern of stimulation, i.e., the timing between stimulation pulses, is a novel dimension of stimulation parameter tuning. The effects evoked by artificial activation of the nervous system are dependent on the pattern of stimulation, and different patterns of stimulation, even when delivered at the same average rate, evoke different functional effects, different changes in synaptic plasticity, and even different patterns of gene expression. Non-regular temporal patterns of stimulation offer the opportunity to improve the efficacy and efficiency of therapeutic stimulation as well as to manipulate other processes in the nervous system.

Peptide-assisted trafficking of non-viral vectors can potentially overcome these biological barriers to improve gene delivery through targeted uptake using key cell-surface receptors (e.g., integrins, growth factor receptors, and G-protein coupled receptors); membrane disruption for endosomal escape; and nuclear importation.

Quit Together is a partnership between a US university and a Romanian university, obstetrics and gynecology clinics in Romania, and other community partners in Romania. The objective of the Quit Together pilot study is to adapt, enhance and test the implementation feasibility and initial efficacy of an evidence-based pregnancy and postnatal couple intervention for smoking cessation in Romania. Quit Together builds on the Motivation and Problem Solving (MAPS) approach, enhanced by targeting the couples' smoking behavior and focusing on dyadic efficacy for smoking cessation. The study is an ongoing randomized controlled trial of 120 Romanian pregnant smokers and their partners. Participants are randomized to: 1) an intervention arm consisting, typically, of up to 8 prenatal and postnatal telephone counseling calls for the women and 4 for their partners, combining motivational strategies and problem-solving/coping skills to encourage the woman to quit smoking and the partner to support her decision; and 2) a control arm (usual care). The primary outcome is maternal biochemically verified smoking abstinence at 3 months postpartum. Quit Together has the potential to identify effective strategies to increase maternal smoking cessation during pregnancy and smoking abstinence after birth. If effective, Quit Together is expected to have a sustainable positive impact on the health of the child, mother and partner, and potentially reduced health system costs."

From our critical readings, we argue that there is a lack of transparency over the ethical reasons for enforcing a maximum storage limit. We demonstrate that arguments for the retention of this limit are associated (in New Zealand) with arguments based upon 'build-up avoidance' and 'conflict avoidance' as social goods based on Pākehā [New Zealander of European descent] cultural world views rather than identifiable universal ethical principles. We illustrate that the avoidance of embryo accumulation and related conflict was only achieved by the denial of indigenous spiritual and cultural concerns, while also shifting the ethical burdens of disposition on to clinic staff and those members of the public who protested against enforced cryopreserved embryo disposal. The Pākehā cultural concept of 'tidy housekeeping' emerges as a presumed ethical and social good in the New Zealand situation.

At the session, representatives of the affected countries and of international organizations reviewed the epidemiologic impact of Syrian displacement on regional TB control, as well as challenges and successes seen in TB control during this displacement. This discussion offered several lessons for TB control in other humanitarian emergencies. TB control in humanitarian emergencies requires increasing awareness of TB symptoms and services among healthcare workers and the affected populations. It also requires performing standardized symptom screening at borders or registration, while leveraging more widely available radiographic and diagnostic tools to find cases in high-burden settings that may be missed using symptom screening alone. Additionally, treatment completion rates can be maintained and improved through dedication of sufficient resources and innovative strategies to keep mobile populations on treatment.

In contrast to mitosis and meiosis II, where sister chromatids are segregated, during meiosis I, homologous chromosomes are segregated. This requires the monopolar attachment of sister kinetochores and the loss of cohesion from chromosome arms, but not centromeres, during meiosis I. The establishment of both sister kinetochore mono-orientation and cohesin protection rely on the budding yeast meiosis I-specific Spo13 protein, the functional homolog of fission yeast Moa1 and mouse MEIKIN. Methods: Here we investigate the effects of loss of SPO13 on cohesion during meiosis I using a live-cell imaging approach. Results: Unlike wild type, cells lacking SPO13 fail to maintain the meiosis-specific cohesin subunit, Rec8, at centromeres and segregate sister chromatids to opposite poles during anaphase I. We show that the cohesin-destabilizing factor, Wpl1, is not primarily responsible for the loss of cohesion during meiosis I. Instead, premature loss of centromeric cohesin during anaphase I in spo13Δ cells relies on separase-dependent cohesin cleavage. Further, cohesin loss in spo13Δ anaphase I cells is blocked by forcibly tethering the regulatory subunit of protein phosphatase 2A, Rts1, to Rec8. Conclusions: Our findings indicate that separase-dependent cleavage of phosphorylated Rec8 causes premature cohesin loss in spo13Δ cells.",MyoCount: a software tool for the automated quantification of myotube surface area and nuclear fusion index.,https://www.ncbi.nlm.nih.gov/pubmed/30906880,Wellcome open research,2019 03 29,"It is often desirable to characterise the morphology of myogenic cultures. To achieve this, the surface area of myotubes is often quantified, along with the nuclear fusion index (NFI). Existing methods of such quantification are time-consuming and subject to error-prone human input. We have developed MyoCount, an open-source program that runs via the freely available MATLAB Runtime and quantifies myotube surface area and NFI. MyoCount allows the user to adjust its parameters to account for differences in image quality, magnification and the colour channels used in generating the image. MyoCount measures of myotube surface area and NFI were compared to the mean of measures performed by two blinded investigators using ImageJ software (surface area R 2 = 0.89, NFI R 2 =0.87). For NFI, the mean coefficient of variation (CV) between two investigators (17.6 ± 2.3%) was significantly higher than that between the investigator mean and MyoCount (13.5 ± 1.4%). For measurements of myotube area, the CV did not differ between both analysis methods. Given these results and the advantages of applying the same image analysis method uniformly across all images in an experiment, we suggest that MyoCount will be a useful research tool and we publish its source code and instructions for its use alongside this article."

Linkages to avian and terrestrial food webs may occur, but effects are thought to attenuate across ecosystem boundaries. Using data spanning more than four decades (1972-2017), we demonstrate that lake trout invasion of Yellowstone Lake added a novel, piscivorous trophic level resulting in a precipitous decline of prey fish, including Yellowstone cutthroat trout. Plankton assemblages within the lake were altered, and nutrient transport to tributary streams was reduced. Effects across the aquatic-terrestrial ecosystem boundary remained strong (log response ratio ≤ 1.07) as grizzly bears and black bears necessarily sought alternative foods. Nest density and success of ospreys greatly declined. Bald eagles shifted their diet to compensate for the cutthroat trout loss. These interactions across multiple trophic levels both within and outside of the invaded lake highlight the potential substantial influence of an introduced predatory fish on otherwise pristine ecosystems.",Zooming in on protons: Neutron structure of protein kinase A trapped in a product complex.,https://www.ncbi.nlm.nih.gov/pubmed/30906862,Science advances,2019 06 10,"The question vis-à-vis the chemistry of phosphoryl group transfer catalyzed by protein kinases remains a major challenge.

By using a high-affinity protein kinase substrate (PKS) peptide, we captured the reaction products, dephosphorylated nucleotide [adenosine diphosphate (ADP)] and phosphorylated PKS (pPKS), bound at the active site. In the complex, the phosphoryl group of the peptide is protonated, whereas the carboxyl group of the catalytic Asp166 is not. Our structure, including conserved waters, shows how the peptide links the distal parts of the cleft together, creating a network that engages the entire molecule. By comparing slow-exchanging backbone amides to those determined by the NMR analysis of PKA-C with ADP and inhibitor peptide (PKI), we identified exchangeable amides that likely distinguish catalytic and inhibited states.",Newly developed reversible MAO-B inhibitor circumvents the shortcomings of irreversible inhibitors in Alzheimer's disease.,https://www.ncbi.nlm.nih.gov/pubmed/30906861,Science advances,2019 03 29,"Monoamine oxidase-B (MAO-B) has recently emerged as a potential therapeutic target for Alzheimer's disease (AD) because of its association with aberrant γ-aminobutyric acid (GABA) production in reactive astrocytes. Although short-term treatment with irreversible MAO-B inhibitors, such as selegiline, improves cognitive deficits in AD patients, long-term treatments have shown disappointing results. We show that prolonged treatment with selegiline fails to reduce aberrant astrocytic GABA levels and rescue memory impairment in APP/PS1 mice, an animal model of AD, because of increased activity in compensatory genes for a GABA-synthesizing enzyme, diamine oxidase (DAO). We have developed a potent, highly selective, and reversible MAO-B inhibitor, KDS2010 (IC50 = 7.6 nM; 12,500-fold selectivity over MAO-A), which overcomes the disadvantages of the irreversible MAO-B inhibitor. Long-term treatment with KDS2010 does not induce compensatory mechanisms, thereby significantly attenuating increased astrocytic GABA levels and astrogliosis, enhancing synaptic transmission, and rescuing learning and memory impairments in APP/PS1 mice.",A previously unrecognized source of the O2 Atmospheric band emission in Earth's nightglow.,https://www.ncbi.nlm.nih.gov/pubmed/30906860,Science advances,2019 03 29,"Earth's night sky continuously produces a faint chemiluminescence known as nightglow. Two prominent nighttime emissions around 90 km are the O2 Atmospheric and the OH Meinel band systems. Despite a plethora of studies since their identification seven decades ago, substantial gaps persist in our understanding of the mechanisms that control them. This report shows that oxygen atoms connect these two emissions: Fast, multiquantum, vibrational-to-electronic relaxation of OH(v) by O atoms activates a pathway that generates O2 Atmospheric band emission. This newly discovered source exhibits a strong altitude dependence and can contribute a majority of the observed O2 Atmospheric band emission when the peaks of the OH and O-atom layers overlap. The new findings call for a reinterpretation of Earth's nightglow emissions and a revision of relevant atmospheric models.",Hypoxia and matrix viscoelasticity sequentially regulate endothelial progenitor cluster-based vasculogenesis.,https://www.ncbi.nlm.nih.gov/pubmed/30906859,Science advances,2019 05 08,"Vascular morphogenesis is the formation of endothelial lumenized networks. Cluster-based vasculogenesis of endothelial progenitor cells (EPCs) has been observed in animal models, but the underlying mechanism is unknown. Here, using O2-controllabe hydrogels, we unveil the mechanism by which hypoxia, co-jointly with matrix viscoelasticity, induces EPC vasculogenesis. When EPCs are subjected to a 3D hypoxic gradient ranging from <2 to 5%, they rapidly produce reactive oxygen species that up-regulate proteases, most notably MMP-1, which degrade the surrounding extracellular matrix. EPC clusters form and expand as the matrix degrades. Cell-cell interactions, including those mediated by VE-cadherin, integrin-β2, and ICAM-1, stabilize the clusters. Subsequently, EPC sprouting into the stiffer, intact matrix leads to vascular network formation. In vivo examination further corroborated hypoxia-driven clustering of EPCs. Overall, this is the first description of how hypoxia mediates cluster-based vasculogenesis, advancing our understanding toward regulating vascular development as well as postnatal vasculogenesis in regeneration and tumorigenesis.",The birth of a coronal mass ejection.,https://www.ncbi.nlm.nih.gov/pubmed/30906858,Science advances,2019 04 06,"The Sun's atmosphere is frequently disrupted by coronal mass ejections (CMEs), coupled with flares and energetic particles.

However, both the origin of flux ropes and their nascent paths toward eruption remain elusive. Here, we present an observation of how a stellar-sized CME bubble evolves continuously from plasmoids, mini flux ropes that are barely resolved, within half an hour. The eruption initiates when plasmoids springing from a vertical current sheet merge into a leading plasmoid, which rises at increasing speeds and expands impulsively into the CME bubble, producing hard x-ray bursts simultaneously. This observation illuminates a complete CME evolutionary path capable of accommodating a wide variety of plasma phenomena by bridging the gap between microscale and macroscale dynamics.",A hidden state in the turnover of a functioning membrane protein complex.,https://www.ncbi.nlm.nih.gov/pubmed/30906857,Science advances,2019 03 29,"Most membrane proteins exist in complexes that carry out critical cellular functions and exhibit rich dynamics.

Rotation of the motor is driven by multiple torque-generating units (stators). Turnover of the stators has been shown previously, demonstrating the exchange of stator units between the motor and a membrane pool. But the details of the turnover kinetics remain unclear. Here, we directly measured the kinetics of stator turnover in individual motors via analysis of a large dataset of long-term high-resolution recordings of motor speed at high load. We found that the dwell time distribution of the stator units exhibits a multi-exponential shape, suggesting the existence of a hidden state in the turnover of the stators.","Codweb: Whole-genome sequencing uncovers extensive reticulations fueling adaptation among Atlantic, Arctic, and Pacific gadids.",https://www.ncbi.nlm.nih.gov/pubmed/30906856,Science advances,2019 03 29,"Introgressive hybridization creates networks of genetic relationships across species.

The enigmatic walleye pollock differs morphologically, behaviorally, and ecologically from its relatives, representing a niche shift. Here, we apply whole-genome sequencing to Pacific, Arctic, and Atlantic gadids and reveal extensive introgression among them with the ABBA-BABA test and pseudolikelihood phylogenetic network analysis. We propose that walleye pollock resulted from extensive adaptive introgression or homoploid hybrid speciation. The path of evolution of these taxa is more web than a tree. Their ability to invade and expand into new habitats and become ecologically successful may depend on genes acquired through adaptive introgression or hybrid speciation.",Thermoresponsive Citrate-Based Graphene Oxide Scaffold Enhances Bone Regeneration from BMP9-Stimulated Adipose-Derived Mesenchymal Stem Cells.,https://www.ncbi.nlm.nih.gov/pubmed/30906855,ACS biomaterials science & engineering,2019 03 29,"Effective bone tissue engineering is important to overcome the unmet clinical challenges as more than 1.6 million bone grafts are done annually in the United States. Successful bone tissue engineering needs minimally three critical constituents: osteoprogenitor cells, osteogenic factors, and osteoinductive/osteoconductive scaffolds. Osteogenic progenitors are derived from multipotent mesenchymal stem cells (MSCs), which can be prepared from numerous tissue sources, including adipose tissue. We previously showed that BMP9 is the most osteogenic BMP and induces robust bone formation of immortalized mouse adipose-derived MSCs entrapped in a citrate-based thermoresponsive hydrogel referred to as PPCNg. As graphene and its derivatives emerge as promising biomaterials, here we develop a novel thermosensitive and injectable hybrid material by combining graphene oxide (GO) with PPCNg (designated as GO-P) and characterize its ability to promote bone formation. We demonstrate that the thermoresponsive behavior of the hybrid material is maintained while effectively supporting MSC survival and proliferation. Furthermore, GO-P induces early bone-forming marker alkaline phosphatase (ALP) and potentiates BMP9-induced expression of osteogenic regulators and bone markers as well as angiogenic factor VEGF in MSCs. In vivo studies show BMP9-transduced MSCs entrapped in the GO-P scaffold form well-mineralized and highly vascularized trabecular bone. Thus, these results indicate that GO-P hybrid material may function as a new biocompatible, injectable scaffold with osteoinductive and osteoconductive activities for bone regeneration.",Assessing the Impacts of Correlated Variability with Dissociated Timescales.,https://www.ncbi.nlm.nih.gov/pubmed/30906854,eNeuro,2019 04 29,"Despite the profound influence on coding capacity of sensory neurons, the measurements of noise correlations have been inconsistent. This is, possibly, because nonstationarity, i.e., drifting baselines, engendered the spurious long-term correlations even if no actual short-term correlation existed. Although attempts to separate them have been made previously, they were ad hoc for specific cases or computationally too demanding. Here we proposed an information-geometric method to unbiasedly estimate pure short-term noise correlations irrespective of the background brain activities without demanding computational resources. First, the benchmark simulations demonstrated that the proposed estimator is more accurate and computationally efficient than the conventional correlograms and the residual correlations with Kalman filters or moving averages of length three or more, while the best moving average of length two coincided with the propose method regarding correlation estimates. Next, we analyzed the cat V1 neural responses to demonstrate that the statistical test accompanying the proposed method combined with the existing nonstationarity test enabled us to dissociate short-term and long-term noise correlations. When we excluded the spurious noise correlations of purely long-term nature, only a small fraction of neuron pairs showed significant short-term correlations, possibly reconciling the previous inconsistent observations on existence of significant noise correlations. The decoding accuracy was slightly improved by the short-term correlations. Although the long-term correlations deteriorated the generalizability, the generalizability was recovered by the decoder with trend removal, suggesting that brains could overcome nonstationarity. Thus, the proposed method enables us to elucidate the impacts of short-term and long-term noise correlations in a dissociated manner."

Using Multinomial Logistic Regression and data from 40 patients, we were able to predict patients' pain scores on an 11-point rating scale with an average accuracy of 0.578 at the intra-individual level, and an accuracy of 0.429 at the inter-individual level. With a condensed 4-point rating scale, the accuracy at the inter-individual level was further improved to 0.681.

However, there are contradictory reports of the relationship among the MTHFR 677CT gene polymorphism, Hcy, and NAFLD. Therefore, the aim of this study was to identify potential associations and interactions of either Hcy levels or the MTHFR 677CT gene polymorphism with the susceptibility to NAFLD in a Chinese population. The association between the MTHFR 677 CT gene polymorphism and Hcy levels was determined in 243 subjects with NAFLD and 388 healthy subjects without NAFLD using polymerase chain reaction-restriction fragment length polymorphism analysis and high-performance liquid chromatography. In subjects with NAFLD, there was no statistical difference in the genotypic and allelic frequencies of the MTHFR 677 CT gene polymorphism, while serum Hcy levels were significantly higher in subjects with NAFLD. Furthermore, these results strongly suggest that the MTHFR 677CT gene polymorphism and NAFLD have a potential synergistic effect on Hcy elevation, although the MTHFR 677CT gene polymorphism was not correlated with NAFLD in a Chinese population.",Integrated transcriptome interactome study of oncogenes and tumor suppressor genes in breast cancer.,https://www.ncbi.nlm.nih.gov/pubmed/30906836,Genes & diseases,2019 03 29,"Breast cancer is the leading cause for mortality among women worldwide. Dysregulation of oncogenes and tumor suppressor genes is the major reason for the cause of cancer. Understanding these genes will provide clues and insights about their regulatory mechanism and their interplay in cancer. In the present study, an attempt is made to compare the functional characteristics and interactions of oncogenes and tumor suppressor genes to understand their biological role. 431 breast cancer samples from seven publicly available microarray datasets were collected and analysed using GEO2R tool. The identified 416 differentially expressed genes were classified into five gene sets as oncogenes (OG), tumor suppressor genes (TSG), druggable genes, essential genes and other genes. The gene sets were subjected to various analysis such as enrichment analysis (viz., GO, Pathways, Diseases and Drugs), network analysis, calculation of mutation frequencies and Guanine-Cytosine (GC) content. From the results, it was observed that the OG were having high GC content as well as high interactions than TSG. Moreover, the OG are found to have frequent mutations than TSG. The enrichment analysis results suggest that the oncogenes are involved in positive regulation of cellular protein metabolic process, macromolecule biosynthetic process and majorly in cell cycle and focal adhesion pathway in cancer. It was also found that these oncogenes are involved in other diseases such as skin diseases and viral infections.

The mechanism whereby KIAA1109 loss of function causes this spectrum of disorders was the primary focus of our studies. We hypothesized that KIAA1109 function could be conserved relative to the fly gene tweek and examined endocytosis and endosome recycling in patient fibroblasts. Furthermore, we examined the structure of the cytoskeleton and cilia based on functional overlap with endocytosis and several known etiologies for neuronal migration disorders. Utilizing primary dermal fibroblasts from one patient and a healthy donor, we performed immunofluorescence and endocytosis assays to examine the endosomal, cytoskeletal, and ciliary cellular phenotypes. We found notable abnormalities in endosomal trafficking and endosome recycling pathways. We also observed changes in the actin cytoskeleton and cilia structural dynamics. We conclude that the function of KIAA1109 in humans may indeed overlap with the function of the Drosophila ortholog, resulting in perturbations to endosomal trafficking and the actin cytoskeleton.

His mother seems like another effected individual because of the apparent short stature. Genomic DNA was extracted from peripheral blood lymphocytes. DNA sequencing analysis of the COMP gene revealed a heterozygous mutation (c.1219 T > C,p.Cys407Arg) in the patient. His mother was also affected with the same genetic change. Mutations in COMP gene is proved to change the Cartilage Oligomeric Matrix Protein. This missense mutation (c.1219 T > C) has not been reported before and it is not belongs to polymorphism sites.

Based on an AluScanCNV software developed by us previously, an AluScanCNV2 software has been developed in the present study as an R package that performs CNV detection from NGS data obtained through AluScan, whole-genome sequencing or other targeted NGS platforms. Its applications would include the expedited usage of somatic CNVs for cancer subtyping, and usage of recurrent germline CNVs to perform machine learning-assisted prediction of a test subject's susceptibility to cancer.",An EGLN1 mutation may regulate hypoxic response in cyanotic congenital heart disease through the PHD2/HIF-1A pathway.,https://www.ncbi.nlm.nih.gov/pubmed/30906831,Genes & diseases,2019 03 29,"Cyanotic congenital heart disease (CCHD), a term describing the most severe congenital heart diseases are characterized by the anatomic malformation of a right to left shunt. Although the incidence of CCHD are far less than the that of congenital heart diseases (CHD), patients with CCHD always present severe clinical features such as hypoxia, dyspnea, and heart failure. Chronic hypoxia induces hypoxemia that significantly contributes to poor prognosis in CCHD. Current studies have demonstrated that the prolyl-4-hydroxylase2 (PHD2, encoded by EGLN1)/hypoxia-inducible factor-1A (HIF-1A) pathway is a key regulator of hypoxic response. Thus, we aim to assess the associations of single polymorphisms (SNPs) of the EGLN1 gene and hypoxic response in CCHD. A missense variant of EGLN1 c.380G>C (rs1209790) was found in 46 patients (46/126), with lower hypoxia incidence and higher rate of collateral vessel formation, compared with the wild type (P < 0.05). In vitro experiments, during hypoxia, EGLN1 mutation reduced EGLN1 expression compared with the wild type, with higher HIF-1A, VEGF and EPO expression levels in the mutant. No difference in HK1 expression was observed between the mutant and wild type. CCHD patients with c.380G>C showed improved response to hypoxia compared with the wild-type counterparts. The EGLN1 c.380G>C mutation improves hypoxic response through the PHD2/HIF-1A pathway, which may provide a molecular mechanism for hypoxic response in CCHD. The effects of the EGLN1 c.380G>C mutation on CCHD prognosis deserve further investigation.",Structural investigation of Rett-inducing MeCP2 mutations.,https://www.ncbi.nlm.nih.gov/pubmed/30906830,Genes & diseases,2019 03 29,"X-ray structure of methyl-CpG binding domain (MBD) of MeCP2, an intrinsically disordered protein (IDP) involved in Rett syndrome, offers a rational basis for defining the spatial distribution for most of the sites where mutations responsible of Rett syndrome, RTT, occur. We have ascribed pathogenicity for mutations of amino acids bearing positively charged side chains, all located at the protein-DNA interface, as positive charge removal cause reduction of the MeCP2-DNA adduct lifetime. Pathogenicity of the frequent proline replacements, outside the DNA contact moiety of MBD, can be attributed to the role of this amino acid for maintaining both unfolded states for unbound MeCP2 and, at the same time, to favor some higher conformational order for stabilizing structural determinants required by protein activity. These hypotheses can be extended to transcription repressor domain, TRD, the other MeCP2-DNA interaction site and, in general, to all the IDP that interact with nucleic acids.","SKA2/FAM33A: A novel gene implicated in cell cycle, tumorigenesis, and psychiatric disorders.",https://www.ncbi.nlm.nih.gov/pubmed/30906829,Genes & diseases,2019 03 29,"SKA2 (spindle and KT associated 2), also referred to as FAM33A (family with sequence similarity 33, member A), is a recently identified gene involved in cell cycle regulation, and growing evidence is implicating its roles in tumorigenesis and psychiatric disorders. It has been demonstrated that SKA2, along with its coworkers SKA1 and SKA3, constitutes the SKA complex which plays a critical role in the maintenance of the metaphase plate and/or spindle checkpoint silencing during mitosis. SKA2 is over-expressed both in cancer cell lines and clinical samples including small cell lung cancer and breast cancer, whereas downregulation of SKA2 is associated with depression and suicidal ideation. The expression of SKA2 is regulated by transcription factors including NF-κΒ and CREB, miRNAs as well as DNA methylation. In this review, we provide an overview of studies that reveal SKA2 gene and protein characteristics as well as physiological function, with a special focus on its transcription regulatory mechanisms, and also provide a summary regarding the translational opportunity of the SKA2 gene as a clinical biomarker for cancers and psychiatric disorders.",Regulation and functions of integrin α2 in cell adhesion and disease.,https://www.ncbi.nlm.nih.gov/pubmed/30906828,Genes & diseases,2019 03 29,"Integrins are cell adhesion molecules that are composed of an alpha (α) subunit and a beta (β) subunit with affinity for different extracellular membrane components.

Each integrin heterodimer has a particular function in defined contexts as well as some partially overlapping features with other members in the family. As many reviews have covered the general integrin family in molecular and cellular studies in life science, this review will focus on the specific regulation, function, and signaling of integrin α2 subunit (CD49b, VLA-2; encoded by the gene ITGA2) in partnership with β1 (CD29) subunit in normal and cancer cells. Its roles in cell adhesion, cell motility, angiogenesis, stemness, and immune/blood cell regulations are discussed. The pivotal role of integrin α2 in many diseases such as cancer suggests its potential to be used as a novel therapeutic target."

Currently, its value is measured experimentally or, more commonly, is estimated using a semi-empirical model. This model was developed by Cooper, Mikic, and Yovanovich (CMY) in the 1960s for predicting contact resistance of metal-metal interfaces in a vacuum. In this work, it is shown that measured value of finger-object contact resistance is better predicted by a more recent correlation by Prasher and Matayabas (PM) that was developed by fitting contact resistance data for silicone gel-metal surface interfaces in microelectronic applications. Furthermore, it is show that the functional form of the empirical PM correlation can be derived using scale analysis of the finger-solid contact scenario, consequently can be considered a physics-based model. Comparing the two models against two previously published experimental data sets demonstrates that the PM model predicts well the thermal resistance between finger and variety of materials over a wide range of contact pressures. Specifically, for finger contact with significantly more conductive materials (thermal conductivity above 1 Wm-1K-1) including aluminum, BaF2 crystal, and marble a good prediction of contact resistance can be attained. For skin contact with less conductive materials, such as wood, both models become highly sensitive to the substrate's thermal conductivity value and provide only an order of magnitude estimate. The main implications of these results and relevant outstanding questions are also briefly discussed.",Skeletal muscle cold shock and heat shock protein mRNA response to aerobic exercise in different environmental temperatures.,https://www.ncbi.nlm.nih.gov/pubmed/30906813,"Temperature (Austin, Tex.)",2019 03 29,"The response of cold shock proteins to exercise and environmental temperature in human skeletal muscle is not known. The purpose of this study was to determine the early mRNA response of human stress proteins to endurance exercise and environmental temperatures. Seven recreationally trained males cycled for 1 hour at 60% VO2peak in 7°C, 20°C, and 33°C with biopsies taken pre- and 3 hours post-exercise. Gene expression for heat shock and cold shock proteins were analyzed using qRT-PCR on muscle biopsy samples from the vastus lateralis. RBM3 mRNA was reduced 1.43 ± 0.10 fold (p = 0.006) while there was a trend for CIRP to decrease1.27 ± 0.14 fold (p = 0.059) from pre- to 3 h post-exercise.

HSP70 mRNA was 2.27 ± 0.23 fold higher 3 h post-exercise when compared to pre-exercise (p = 0.002) but was not significantly different between temperatures (p = 0.103). HSP27, HSP90, and HSF1 mRNA did not change from pre- to post-exercise (p = 0.052, p = 0.324, p = 0.795) and were not different between temperatures (p = 0.247, p = 0.134, p = 0.808). These data indicate that exposure to mild heat and cold during aerobic exercise have limited effect on the skeletal muscle mRNA expression of heat shock and cold shock proteins. However, skeletal muscle mRNA of cold shock proteins decrease, while HSP70 mRNA increases in response to a low to moderate intensity aerobic exercise bout.",Thermoregulatory burden of elite sailing athletes during exercise in the heat: A pilot study.,https://www.ncbi.nlm.nih.gov/pubmed/30906812,"Temperature (Austin, Tex.)",2019 03 29,"Exercising in a hot and humid environment increases core body temperature, which may limit exercise performance. The risk of exercise-induced hyperthermia and associated performance decrement in Olympic sailing athletes is largely unknown. Therefore, this study aimed to compare thermoregulatory responses and performance indicators of elite sailors in a cool versus hot and humid environment. Seven elite athletes from four different Olympic sailing classes (Laser, RS:X, Finn, 470) performed cycling and/or rowing exercise in a cool (18°C) and hot (33°C) environment, while core body temperature (TC), skin temperature (TSK), exercise performance (covered distance), and rating of perceived exertion were measured continuously. TC increased significantly more in the hot environment (37.6 ± 0.2°C to 39.1 ± 0.1°C) compared to the cool environment (37.5 ± 0.1°C to 38.5 ± 0.2°C; p = 0.002), but the increase in TC between conditions differed substantially within individuals (range: 0.3°C - 0.9°C). Exercise performance decreased by 6.2 ± 2.9% in the hot environment (p = 0.013, range: 2.3%-9.5%), but more importantly, exercise performance was strongly inversely related to peak TC (R = -0.78, p = 0.039). Rating of perceived exertion (cool: 14.2 ± 0.6; hot: 13.9 ± 1.2) and increase in TSK (cool: 0.5 ± 1.0°C; hot: 0.9 ± 0.3°C) did not differ between conditions (p = 0.59 and p = 0.36, respectively). To conclude, a larger increase in TC and substantial exercise performance decrement were observed in the hot versus cool environment. As a further matter, large inter-individual differences were observed across athletes with an inverse relationship between TC and exercise performance, which stresses the importance of appropriate and personalized interventions to reduce thermoregulatory burden of elite sailors during exercise in the heat.",Upper body sweat mapping provides evidence of relative sweat redistribution towards the periphery following hot-dry heat acclimation.,https://www.ncbi.nlm.nih.gov/pubmed/30906811,"Temperature (Austin, Tex.)",2019 03 29,"Purpose: Produce a detailed upper-body sweat map and evaluate changes in gross and regional sweating rates (RSR) and distribution following heat acclimation (HA). Methods: Six males (25 ± 4 yrs) completed six consecutive HA days (45°C, 20% rh) requiring 90 minutes intermittent exercise to maintain a 1.4°C rectal temperature (Tre) rise. Pre- and post-HA upper-body RSR were measured at 55% (Intensity-1; I1) and 75% VO2 max (Intensity-2; I2) using a modified absorbent technique. Results: From day one to six of HA, work rate increased (n.s.), heart rate, Tre, and skin temperature were similar, and gross sweat loss (GSL) increased (P < 0.001). During pre and post-HA experiments, relative workloads were similar (Pre-I1 54 ± 3, Post-I1 57 ± 5%VO2max; Pre-I2 73 ± 4, Post-I2 76 ± 7%VO2max). Post-HA GSL was significantly higher (Pre 449 ± 90 g.m-2 h-1, Post 546 g.m-2 h-1; P < 0.01). Highest RSR were observed on the central back both pre and post-HA at I1 (pre 854 ± 269 post 1178 ± 402g.m-2 h-1) and I2 (pre 1221 ± 351 post 1772 ± 396 g.m-2 h-1). Absolute RSR increased significantly in 12 (I1) to 14 (I2) of the 17 regions. Ratio data indicated significant post-HA relative RSR redistribution, with decreased relative contributions to whole-body sweating on the back, chest staying the same and arms increasing. Conclusions: Hot-dry HA significantly increased GSL in aerobically trained males at I2. Absolute RSR significantly increased in I1 and I2, with a preferential relative redistribution towards the periphery of the upper-body.",Application of evidence-based recommendations for heat acclimation: Individual and team sport perspectives.,https://www.ncbi.nlm.nih.gov/pubmed/30906810,"Temperature (Austin, Tex.)",2019 03 29,"Heat acclimation or acclimatization (HA) occurs with repeated exposure to heat inducing adaptations that enhance thermoregulatory mechanisms and heat tolerance leading to improved exercise performance in warm-to-hot conditions. HA is an essential heat safety and performance enhancement strategy in preparation for competitions in warm-to-hot conditions for both individual and team sports. Yet, some data indicate HA is an underutilized pre-competition intervention in athletes despite the well-known benefits; possibly due to a lack of practical information provided to athletes and coaches. Therefore, the aim of this review is to provide actionable evidence-based implementation strategies and protocols to induce and sustain HA. We propose the following suggestions to circumvent potential implementation barriers: 1) incorporate multiple induction methods during the initial acclimation period, 2) complete HA 1-3 weeks before competition in the heat to avoid training and logistical conflicts during the taper period, and 3) minimize adaptation decay through intermittent exercise-heat exposure or re-acclimating immediately prior to competition with 2-4 consecutive days of exercise-heat training. Use of these strategies may be desirable or necessary to optimize HA induction and retention around existing training or logistical requirements.",Towards establishing evidence-based guidelines on maximum indoor temperatures during hot weather in temperate continental climates.,https://www.ncbi.nlm.nih.gov/pubmed/30906809,"Temperature (Austin, Tex.)",2019 03 29,"Rising environmental temperatures represent a major threat to human health. The activation of heat advisories using evidence-based thresholds for high-risk outdoor ambient temperatures have been shown to be an effective strategy to save lives during hot weather. However, although the relationship between weather and human health has been widely defined by outdoor temperature, corresponding increases in indoor temperature during heat events can also be harmful to health especially in vulnerable populations. In this review, we discuss our current understanding of the relationship between outdoor temperature and human health and examine how human health can also be adversely influenced by high indoor temperatures during heat events. Our assessment of the existing literature revealed a high degree of variability in what can be considered an acceptable indoor temperature because there are differences in how different groups of people may respond physiologically and behaviorally to the same living environment. Finally, we demonstrate that both non-physiological (e.g., geographical location, urban density, building design) and physiological (e.g., sex, age, fitness, state of health) factors must be considered when defining an indoor temperature threshold for preserving human health in a warming global climate.",Preserve Cultured Cell Cytonemes through a Modified Electron Microscopy Fixation.,https://www.ncbi.nlm.nih.gov/pubmed/30906805,Bio-protocol,2019 03 29,"Immunocytochemistry of cultured cells is a common and effective technique for determining compositions and localizations of proteins within cellular structures.

We developed a fixation protocol for cultured cells that preserves cytonemes, which allows for immunofluorescent analysis of endogenous and over-expressed proteins localizing to the delicate cellular structures.","Impact of α-adrenoceptor antagonists on prostate cancer development, progression and prevention.",https://www.ncbi.nlm.nih.gov/pubmed/30906804,American journal of clinical and experimental urology,2019 03 29,"Two decades following the discovery that α1-adrenoceptor antagonists suppress prostate tumor growth at the molecular and cellular level, the impact of α-blockade as re-purposed treatment strategy in the medical management of prostate cancer is gradually being recognized. Prostate cancer is the second most common cause of cancer deaths among males in the United States, yet the disease maintains inconsistent recommendations for prevention and screening. The functional relationship between α-adrenergic signaling and smooth muscle cells in the stroma of the prostate gland and the bladder neck empowered the use of α-adrenoceptor antagonists for the relief of urethral obstruction and clinical symptoms associated with benign prostatic hyperplasia (BPH). Adrenoceptors are G-protein-coupled receptors (GCPRs) that are functionally bound by catecholamines: epinephrine (ER) and norepinephrine (NE). The α1A adrenoceptor subtype is primarily responsible for smooth muscle contraction in the bladder neck and prostate gland. α1-adrenoceptor antagonists are clinically indicated as first-line therapies for the relief of BPH, hypertension, and post-traumatic stress disorder (PTSD). Compelling evidence from cellular and pre-clinical models have identified additional effects of α1-adrenoceptor antagonists regarding their ability to induce apoptosis-mediated suppression of prostate tumor growth and metastasis. Additionally, early epidemiologic data suggest that they may serve as a safe treatment to reduce the risk of prostate cancer. Optimization of quinazoline based compounds (doxazosin) to exploit pharmacologic targeting of tumor growth and vascularization revealed high efficacy of the lead novel compound DZ-50 against prostate tumors.

Despite an objective short-term response of interferon (IFN) therapy in renal cell carcinoma (RCC) patients, the potential adverse effect of IFN on RCC cells is not fully understood. In this study, we demonstrate that IFNs can enhance RCC invasion via a new mechanism of IFIT5-mediated tumor suppressor microRNA (miRNA) degradation resulted in the elevation of Slug and ZEB1 and epithelial-to-mesenchymal transition (EMT). Clinically, a significant upregulation of IFNγ signaling pathway (such as IFNGR1, IFNGR2, STAT1 and STAT2) is observed in RCC patients with metastatic disease. Overall, this study provides a new mechanism of action of IFN-elicited canonical pathway in regulating suppressor miRNAs.

In this study we investigated the functional significance of these miRNAs and identified gene targets involved in RCC pathogenesis. Ectopic expression of these miRNAs significantly attenuated the malignant phenotypes including proliferation, migration and invasion of two RCC cell lines, 786-O and A498. A combination of genome-wide gene expression and in silico database analyses revealed 36 and 34 genes as putative target oncogenes regulated by miR-532-5p and miR-532-3p, respectively, in RCC cells. Among these targets, expression of aquaporin9 (AQP9), a water channel protein, was directly regulated by both miR-532-5p and miR-532-3p, and high expression levels of AQP9 were significantly associated with poor prognosis of RCC patients (P = 2.03e-05). Multivariate analysis indicated that AQP9 expression is an independent prognostic factor for RCC patients. Aberrant AQP9 expression at both the gene and protein level was detected in RCC clinical specimens. siRNA-mediated knockdown of AQP9 by si-AQP9 inhibited the malignant phenotypes of RCC cells. Rescue assays of AQP9 overexpression showed that the miR-532/AQP9 axis was closely involved in RCC oncogenesis. The identification of antitumor miRNAs and their targets will contribute to an increased understanding of the molecular pathogenesis of RCC."

TNF-like ligand 1 aberrance (TL1A) was found to be able to induce intestinal inflammation and fibrosis. Furthermore, significantly increased TL1A had been detected in liver tissues and mononuclear cells of patients with primary biliary cirrhosis (PBC). This study was to investigate the effect of myeloid cells with constitutive TL1A expression on liver fibrogenesis. We found that TL1A expressions in liver tissues and macrophages were significantly increased in mice with liver fibrosis induced by injection of carbon tetrachloride (CCl4). TL1A overexpression in myeloid cells induced liver function injury, accelerated the necrosis and apoptosis of hepatocytes, recruited macrophages, and promoted activation of hepatic stellate cells (HSCs) and fibrosis. In vitro results of our study showed that TL1A overexpression in macrophages promoted secretion of platelet-derived growth factor-BB (PDGF-BB), tumor necrosis factor-α (TNF-α), and interleukin-1β (IL-1β). Culturing macrophages with TL1A overexpression could accelerate the activation and proliferation of primary HSCs. These results indicated that constitutive TL1A expression in myeloid cells exacerbated liver fibrosis, probably through macrophage recruitment and secretion of proinflammatory and profibrotic cytokines.",Genetic Manipulation of Calcium Release-Activated Calcium Channel 1 Modulates the Multipotency of Human Cartilage-Derived Mesenchymal Stem Cells.,https://www.ncbi.nlm.nih.gov/pubmed/30906790,Journal of immunology research,2019 03 29,"Calcium is a ubiquitous intracellular messenger that has a crucial role in determining the proliferation, differentiation, and functions of multipotent mesenchymal stem cells (MSCs). Our study is aimed at elucidating the influence of genetically manipulating Ca2+ release-activated Ca2+ (CRAC) channel-mediated intercellular Ca2+ signaling on the multipotency of MSCs. The abilities of genetically engineered MSCs, including CRAC-overexpressing and CRAC-knockout MSCs, to differentiate into multiple mesenchymal lineages, including adipogenic, osteogenic, and chondrogenic lineages, were evaluated. CRAC channel-mediated Ca2+ influx into these cells was regulated, and the differentiation fate of MSCs was modified. Upregulation of intracellular Ca2+ signals attenuated the adipogenic differentiation ability and slightly increased the osteogenic differentiation potency of MSCs, whereas downregulation of CRACM1 expression promoted chondrogenic differentiation potency. The findings demonstrated the effects of genetically manipulating MSCs by targeting CRACM1. CRAC-modified MSCs had distinct differentiation fates to adipocytes, osteoblasts, and chondrocytes. To aid in the clinical implementation of tissue engineering strategies for joint regeneration, these data may allow us to identify prospective factors for effective treatments and could maximize the therapeutic potential of MSC-based transplantation.",Evaluation of EBV- and HCMV-Specific T Cell Responses in Systemic Lupus Erythematosus (SLE) Patients Using a Normalized Enzyme-Linked Immunospot (ELISPOT) Assay.,https://www.ncbi.nlm.nih.gov/pubmed/30906789,Journal of immunology research,2019 03 29,"Systemic lupus erythematosus (SLE) is an autoimmune disease with a complex etiology. Opportunistic viral pathogens, such as human cytomegalovirus (HCMV) and Epstein-Barr virus (EBV), are particularly relevant.

PBMCs from 70 SLE patients and 50 healthy controls were stimulated with EBV- and HCMV-specific antigens, and IFN-γ-secreting T cells were quantified. We observed that both EBV- and HCMV-specific T cell responses were significantly lower in SLE patients compared with healthy subjects. We reported decreased EBV- and HCMV-specific T cell responses among medium-high immunosuppressed patients compared to low immunosuppressed patients. Immunosuppressive level could exert a role in the control of herpesviruses reactivation, even if the immunosuppressive condition of SLE remains the driving cause of skewed virus-specific T cell response.",High-Risk Indicators of Renal Involvement in Primary Sjogren's Syndrome: A Clinical Study of 1002 Cases.,https://www.ncbi.nlm.nih.gov/pubmed/30906788,Journal of immunology research,2019 03 29,A retrospective analysis of clinical characteristics and immunological manifestations of primary Sjogren's syndrome (pSS) patients with or without renal involvement was conducted in order to elucidate the potential risk factors of renal damage in pSS and evaluate the condition.,Comparative Serological Study for the Prevalence of Anti-MERS Coronavirus Antibodies in High- and Low-Risk Groups in Qatar.,https://www.ncbi.nlm.nih.gov/pubmed/30906787,Journal of immunology research,2019 03 29,"Infection with Middle East respiratory syndrome coronavirus (MERS-CoV) could be asymptomatic or cause mild influenza-like illness. Therefore, the prevalence of MERS-CoV infections in the general population could be underestimated, which necessitates active surveillance to determine the epidemiological importance of asymptomatic cases. The aim of this study is to evaluate the performance of various serological assays and to estimate the seroprevalence of anti-MERS-CoV antibodies in high- and low-risk groups in Qatar. A total of 4858 samples were screened, including 4719 samples collected from healthy blood donors (BD) over a period of five years (2012-2016), 135 samples from baseline case contacts (CC) collected from individuals in close contact with three positive PCR-confirmed patients (CP), and four samples from MERS-CoV CP. Initial screening using anti-MERS-CoV IgG (IgG rS1-ELISA kit) revealed ten reactive samples from BD (10/4719, 0.21%), one from CC (1/135, 0.74%), and three from CP (3/4, 75%). Samples from CP but not from BD were also reactive by whole-virus anti-MERS-CoV IgG (n = 3/4) and IgM (n = 1/4) indirect immunefluorescent tests (IIFT) and pseudoparticle neutralization test (ppNT). The reactive sample from CC was also confirmed by ppNT. Surprisingly, one out of thirteen (7.7%) randomly selected IgG rS1-ELISA-negative BD samples from the initial screening was reactive by the IgM-IIFT (but not by the IgG-IIFT) and was subsequently confirmed by ppNT. All IgG rS1-ELISA-reactive samples from BD exhibited considerable reactivity to the four circulating human coronaviruses (HKU1, OC43, 229E, and NL63). Cross-reactivity with SARS was only reported for samples from CP using IgG and IgM-IIFT. In conclusion, we report a low prevalence of anti-MERS antibodies in the general population, which coincides with the low number of all reported cases by the time of our study (2017) in Qatar (n = 21).

The present study evaluated the gastroprotective effects of these plants either single or in combination against HCl/EtOH-induced gastritis and indomethacin-induced ulcer in rat model. Stomach ulcer was induced by oral ingestions of HCl/EtOH or indomethacin. Treatment with RF, UL, and GJ separately or in combination was done 1 h before ulcer induction. On HCl/EtOH-induced gastritis RF, UL, and GJ at a dose of 150 mg/kg showed comparable antigastritis effect (less than 50% inhibition) with lesion index of 94.97±8.05, 108.48±11.51, and 79.10±9.77 mm compared to cimetidine (45.33±23.73 mm). However, the combination of RF, UL, and GJ at a dose of 150 mg/kg with a ratio of 50:50:50 showed remarkable antigastritis effect with 77% inhibition. The observed lesion index at a ratio of 50:50:50 was 23.34±9.11 mm similar to cimetidine (18.88±19.88 mm). On indomethacin-induced ulcer, RF and GJ showed 38.28% and 51.8% inhibition whereas UL showed around 17.73% inhibition at 150 mg/kg. Combination of RF, UL, and GJ at 150 mg/kg showed strong antigastritis effect with 83.71% inhibition. These findings suggest strong gastroprotective effect of combined extract. In addition, these plants showed significant antioxidant activity in DPPH scavenging assay and antilipid peroxidation activity. Combination of black raspberry, elm, and cape jasmine might be a significant systemic gastroprotective agent that could be utilized for the treatment and/or protection of gastritis and gastric ulcer.",Single- and Bicomponent Analyses of T2⁎ Relaxation in Knee Tendon and Ligament by Using 3D Ultrashort Echo Time Cones (UTE Cones) Magnetic Resonance Imaging.,https://www.ncbi.nlm.nih.gov/pubmed/30906782,BioMed research international,2019 03 29,"The collagen density is not detected in the patellar tendon (PT), posterior cruciate ligament (PCL), and anterior cruciate ligament (ACL) in clinic. We assess the technical feasibility of three-dimension multiecho fat saturated ultrashort echo time cones (3D FS-UTE-Cones) acquisitions for single- and bicomponent T2⁎ analysis of bound and free water pools in PT, PCL, and ACL in clinic. The knees of five healthy volunteers and six knee joint samples from cadavers were scanned via 3D multiecho FS-UTE-Cones acquisitions on a clinical scanner. Single-component fitting of T2⁎M and bicomponent fitting of short T2⁎ (T2⁎S), long T2⁎ (T2⁎L), short T2⁎ fraction (Frac_S), and long T2⁎ fraction (Frac_L) were performed within tendons and ligaments. Our results showed that biexponential fitting was superior to single-exponential fitting in PT, PCL, and ACL. For knee joint samples, there was no statistical difference among all data in PT, PCL, and ACL. For volunteers, all parameters of bicomponent fitting were statistically different across PT, PCL, and ACL, except for T2⁎S, T2⁎L, and T2⁎M resulting in flawed measurements due to the magic angle effect. 3D multiecho FS-UTE-Cones acquisition allows high resolution T2⁎ mapping in PT, PCL, and ACL of keen joint samples and PT and PCL of volunteers. The T2⁎ values and their fractions can be characterized by bicomponent T2⁎ analysis that is superior to single-component T2⁎ analysis, except for ACL of volunteers.",Blockage of TGF-α Induced by Spherical Silica Nanoparticles Inhibits Epithelial-Mesenchymal Transition and Proliferation of Human Lung Epithelial Cells.,https://www.ncbi.nlm.nih.gov/pubmed/30906781,BioMed research international,2019 03 29,"Background. Xuanwei City in Yunnan province has been one of the towns with highest lung cancer mortality in China. The high content of amorphous silica in the bituminous coal from Xuanwei of Yunnan is mainly present as irregular and spherical silica nanoparticles (SiNPs). It has been reported that silica nanoparticles in bituminous coal correlated with the high incidence of lung cancer in Xuanwei. To explore the role and mechanism of SiNPs in the tumorigenesis of lung cancer in Xuanwei, human mononuclear cells (THP-1) and human bronchial epithelial cells (BEAS-2B) were cocultured in a transwell chamber. Combined with Benzo[a]pyrene-7, 8-dihydrodiol-9, and 10-epoxide (BPDE), SiNPs could significantly promote the proliferation and Epithelial-Mesenchymal Transition (EMT) and inhibit apoptosis of BEAS-2B cells and induce the release of TGF-α from THP-1 cells. After neutralizing TGF-α with antibody, the proliferation and EMT were decreased and enhanced apoptosis of BEAS-2B cells. Furthermore, the results showed that TGF-α in the sera of patients with lung adenocarcinoma in Xuanwei were significantly higher than in patients with benign pulmonary lesions in Xuanwei and those with lung adenocarcinoma in outside of Xuanwei of Yunnan. Taken together, our study found that SiNPs promoted the proliferation and EMT of BEAS-2B cells by inducing the release of TGF-α from THP-1 cells."

In vitro modeling is an important step in understanding atrophy mechanisms and testing countermeasures before animal trials. The most ideal environment for modeling must be empirically determined to best mimic known responses in vivo. To simulate microgravity conditions, murine C2C12 myoblasts were cultured in a rotary cell culture system (RCCS). Alginate encapsulation was compared against polystyrene microcarrier beads as a substrate for culturing these adherent muscle cells. Changes after culture under simulated microgravity were characterized by assessing mRNA expression of MuRF1, MAFbx, Caspase 3, Akt2, mTOR, Ankrd1, and Foxo3. Protein concentration of myosin heavy chain 4 (Myh4) was used as a differentiation marker. Cell morphology and substrate structure were evaluated with brightfield and fluorescent imaging. Differentiated C2C12 cells encapsulated in alginate had a significant increase in MuRF1 only following simulated microgravity culture and were morphologically dissimilar to normal cultured muscle tissue. On the other hand, C2C12 cells cultured on polystyrene microcarriers had significantly increased expression of MuRF1, Caspase 3, and Foxo3 and easily identifiable multinucleated myotubes. The extent of differentiation was higher in simulated microgravity and protein synthesis more active with increased Myh4, Akt2, and mTOR. The in vitro microcarrier model described herein significantly increases expression of several of the same atrophy markers as in vivo models. However, unlike animal models, MAFbx and Ankrd1 were not significantly increased and the fold change in MuRF1 and Foxo3 was lower than expected. Using a standard commercially available RCCS, the substrates and culture methods described only partially model changes in mRNAs associated with atrophy in vivo.",Role of bronchoalveolar lavage in the management of immunocompromised patients with pulmonary infiltrates.,https://www.ncbi.nlm.nih.gov/pubmed/30906753,Annals of translational medicine,2019 03 29,"Pulmonary infiltrates are a significant cause of morbidity and mortality in immunocompromised patients and remain a diagnostic challenge due to the broad range of etiologies that include infection and malignancy. Empiric therapy may be sub-optimal and can adversely impact outcome. Therefore, a confirmed diagnosis is necessary and flexible bronchoscopy with bronchoalveolar lavage (BAL) may be a useful diagnostic tool. Samples are obtained for microbiological and cytological testing, but the procedure carries risk of complications including the adverse events related to moderate sedation. A review of published literature on BAL in immunocompromised patients from the year 2000 was undertaken focusing on diagnostic yield, complication rate, mortality as well as factors impacting these outcomes. Studies in which the majority of patients were supported on mechanical ventilation were excluded. A total of 23 studies (7 prospective and 16 retrospective) met inclusion criteria. This covered 3,395 procedures in 3,192 patients with a mean age of 47.4 years; 60.3% male gender. Diagnostic yield ranged from 26% to 69% with no clear association between diagnostic yield and etiology of immunosuppression or clinical/radiological presentation. Post BAL modification of treatment as an indicator for clinical utility ranged from 11% to 84%; and complication rate ranged from 1% to 52%. No specific factors were associated with increased adverse event rate. This review provides a summary of the data on the use of BAL for diagnosis of pulmonary infiltrates in immunocompromised patients, highlighting the heterogeneity of patients, significant variation in findings reported and the need for more data to optimize patient selection.",Short-term outcomes after anatomic total shoulder arthroplasty in patients with osteoarthritis versus osteonecrosis.,https://www.ncbi.nlm.nih.gov/pubmed/30906752,Annals of translational medicine,2019 03 29,"The outcomes of anatomic total shoulder arthroplasty (TSA) for glenohumeral osteoarthritis (OA) have been extensively reported in the literature.

Based on preclinical data, the time interval between radiotherapy, and hyperthermia is expected to influence treatment outcome. Clinical studies addressing the effect of time interval are sparse. The repercussions for clinical applications are substantial, as the time between radiotherapy and hyperthermia should be kept as short as possible. In this study, we therefore investigated the effect of the time interval between radiotherapy and hyperthermia on treatment outcome. Methods: We analyzed all primary cervical carcinoma patients treated between 1996 and 2016 with thermoradiotherapy at our institute. Data on patients, tumors and treatments were collected, including the thermal dose parameters TRISE and CEM43T90. Follow-up data on tumor status and survival as well as late toxicity were collected. Data was analyzed using Cox proportional hazards analysis and Kaplan Meier analysis. Results: 400 patients were included. Kaplan Meier and univariate Cox analysis showed no effect of the time interval (range 30-230 min) on any clinical outcome measure. Besides known prognostic factors, thermal dose parameters TRISE and CEM43T90 had a significant effect on LC. In multivariate analysis, the thermal dose parameter TRISE (HR 0.649; 95% CI 0.501-0.840) and the use of image guided brachytherapy (HR 0.432; 95% CI 0.214-0.972), but not the time interval, were significant predictors of LC and disease specific survival. Conclusions: The time interval between radiotherapy and hyperthermia, up to 4 h, has no effect on clinical outcome. These results are re-ensuring for our current practice of delivering hyperthermia within maximal 4 h after radiotherapy.",Skull Base Mucormycosis in an Immunocompetent Patient: A Case Report and Literature Review.,https://www.ncbi.nlm.nih.gov/pubmed/30906732,Indian journal of otolaryngology and head and neck surgery : official publication of the Association of Otolaryngologists of India,2019 03 29,"To demonstrate the affection of skull base by mucormycosis in an immunocompetent individual.

Standard methods were used for collection of oral specimens, culturing and identifying Candida species. Potential correlations between the presence and severity of oral lesions and CD4+ cells counts were analysed. Candidiasis was detected in 20% of the patients with an mean CD4+ count being 188. All the patients were on highly active antiretroviral therapy except one. There was pseudomembranous candidiasis in 9, erythematous type in 3, angular chelitis in 2, chronic hyperplastic in 4, and median rhomboid glossitis in 2. Candidiasis is an indicator of low CD4+ cell count but may be seen at different levels of the disease. In HIV sero-positive patients it is an indicator of falling CD4+ cell count generally below 200, indicating onset of AIDS.

The mean micronuclei index was significantly higher in those using tobacco, for longer duration and with frequent tobacco use. The mean micronuclei index can be used as a potential screening tool of genotoxic damage and biomarker for epithelial carcinogenesis. The method has practical utility for warning tobacco users that higher than range has a danger of malignant event and therefore this in future can be used as reinforcement to advice of avoiding tobacco before malignancy develops.",Auditory Lateralization Training Effects on Binaural Interaction Component of Middle Latency Response in Children Suspected to Central Auditory Processing Disorder.,https://www.ncbi.nlm.nih.gov/pubmed/30906724,Indian journal of otolaryngology and head and neck surgery : official publication of the Association of Otolaryngologists of India,2019 03 29,"Many children with central auditory processing disorder (C)APD suffer from spatial processing disorder and benefit from binaural processing training including auditory lateralization training.

The aim of present study was investigating effects of auditory lateralization training on binaural interaction component (BIC) of middle latency response (MLR). This study was an analytical interventional study. Sixty children suspected to (C)APD (40 boys and 20 girls) were selected based on inclusion criteria and were divided into two groups: control and training group. Auditory lateralization training included 12 formal sessions under headphone by using interaural time difference and performed as a game. MLR (monaural right ear, monaural left ear and binaural) and monaural selective auditory attention test (mSAAT) tests were performed in all the cases. BIC was calculated by subtracting binaural response from summed monaural responses. Covariance test showed that BIC latency decreased and BIC amplitude increased significantly and mSAAT score increased significantly in training group after auditory lateralization training (p value ≤ 0.001). In present study BIC of MLR had potential to show underlying neurophysiologic changes after auditory lateralization training in children suspected to (C)APD objectively. It is in agreement with behavioral improvements after training (mSAAT improvements)."

Despite recent advances in diagnosis and treatment, there has not been much improvement in outcome of these patients, necessitating identification of novel targeted therapeutic agents. Genomic profiling of mucoepidermoid carcinomas has recently revealed aberrations in BAP1 gene. Therefore, we conducted this study to identify BAP1 loss by immunohistochemistry in these tumors. Mucoepidermoid carcinoma cases were retrieved; hematoxylin-and-eosin stained sections were reviewed. Immunohistochemistry for BAP1 was performed. Forty cases were assessed, including 25 salivary gland and 15 pulmonary mucoepidermoid carcinomas. There were 19 cases in the parotid (76%), two in submandibular gland (8%), and remaining 16% from minor salivary gland locations. Ten (40%) were low grade, nine (36%) were intermediate grade, and six (24%) were high grade mucoepidermoid carcinomas. Thirteen (86.7%) pulmonary mucoepidermoid carcinomas were tracheobronchial, while two (13.3%) were intraparenchymal; all were low grade mucoepidermoid carcinomas. On immunohistochemistry, BAP1 nuclear staining was retained in all cases (100%), irrespective of tumor location or grade. Therapeutic connotations necessitate the identification of readily applicable techniques to detect BAP1 loss in mucoepidermoid carcinomas. Using immunohistochemistry, loss of BAP1 staining was not seen in any of our cases, suggesting insensitivity of BAP1 IHC to detect aberrations at genomic level in these tumors. Analysis of BAP1 alterations by targeted sequencing may therefore be performed prior to excluding the possibility of response to BAP1-targeted therapeutics based on immunohistochemistry alone.",Feasibility of Parotid Duct Transposition for the Treatment of Dry Eye: A Cadaveric Study.,https://www.ncbi.nlm.nih.gov/pubmed/30906709,Indian journal of otolaryngology and head and neck surgery : official publication of the Association of Otolaryngologists of India,2019 03 29,"Total dry eye is encountered less frequently, but it may lead to blindness. Transposition of parotid duct to the conjunctival cul-de-sac is a method of treatment for advanced cases of xerophthalmia to prevent blindness. Tears and parotid secretions have similar composition; therefore saliva provides an excellent replacement for tears. Limitation of this procedure is that the length of the parotid duct may not be adequate to reach the conjunctival cul-de-sac. This study was conducted in 30 fresh cadavers to assess the length of parotid duct and technical feasibility of parotid duct transposition for the treatment of dry eye. The parotid duct was dissected and resting length of parotid duct was measured on both sides without stretching. The distance between ear lobule to lateral canthus was also measured on both sides in each cadaver. The length of parotid duct ranges from 4.5 to 7 cm with average length was 5.8 cm. The majority of the cadavers had parotid duct length of 6 cm. Length of the right and left parotid duct was found to be equal in all cadavers. Parotid duct reached comfortably in 24 cadavers (80%) while it was short in 6 cadavers (20%) by 1-1.50 cm in length. Parotid duct can be transposed easily to the lower conjunctival cul-de-sac in majority of the cases. If the parotid duct is falling short than a cuff of the buccal mucosa can be taken in order to gain length.",Clinico-radiological Co-relation of Carcinoma Larynx and Hypopharynx: A Prospective Study.,https://www.ncbi.nlm.nih.gov/pubmed/30906708,Indian journal of otolaryngology and head and neck surgery : official publication of the Association of Otolaryngologists of India,2019 03 29,"The successful management of laryngeal and hypopharyngeal cancers requires accurate diagnosis, staging, assessment of patient wishes, and the selection of the most appropriate treatment for the individual patient.

To correlate carcinoma larynx and hypopharynx clinically and radiologically and to know the accurate pre-therapeutic stage of the disease. A total of 50 cases were included in this study. After clinical TNM staging, CT scan was done to know the real extent of tumor, volume and nodal status. After that, TNM staging was revised based on radiological findings. The number of people who had been upstaged and downstaged after CT evaluation was measured. There were total of 50 cases of carcinoma larynx and hypopharynx in this study. There were 26 (52%) cases of carcinoma larynx and 24 (48%) cases of carcinoma hypopharynx. There were significant changes in T stage after radiological evaluation. Major changes were observed in T2 and T3 stages. Majority of cases (17) were having N1 disease after radiological evaluation. On comparing clinical and radiological staging of neck nodes, it was observed that upstaging occurred mainly in N0. Overall after radiological evaluation, 48% of our cases were upstaged, 48% remained in same stage and 4% were downstaged.

Any kind of intervention routinely requires rigid direct laryngoscope with suspension. Identifying the potential use of Miller laryngoscope blade for pediatric airway surgery is the aim of the study. We have included pediatric patients from new born to 12 years of age in our clinical study. We have been using Miller laryngoscope blade for approaching till the level of subglottis for diagnostic laryngoscopy along with Hopkins 0 degree endoscope and performing surgical procedures like supraglottoplasty, vallecular cysts, subglottic stenosis etc. Miller laryngoscope blade can be used as an aid to upper airway surgery for the otolaryngologists with minimal operating time and effort.","Microsurgical Anatomy of Stapedius Muscle: Anatomy Revisited, Redefined with Potential Impact in Surgeries.",https://www.ncbi.nlm.nih.gov/pubmed/30906706,Indian journal of otolaryngology and head and neck surgery : official publication of the Association of Otolaryngologists of India,2019 03 29,"Stapedius muscle even though being the smallest skeletal muscle in human body, it has a major role in otology. As many of the distinguished books in otology missed to explain much about stapedius muscle, and also considering the need for the anatomy based visit to this small muscle we felt it was important to have a exercise like this. In the dissection hall of our institution we dissected 32 cadaveric temporal bones and delineated stapedius muscle as a part of PG teaching programme to have a clear idea of the anatomy of stapedius muscle, its origin, attachment, extension, size (all dimensions). Length of the stapedius muscle varied between 9 and 11 mm. Stapedial tendon measured about 2 mm. The muscle had a classical sickle shape with tendon looking like the handle of the sickle. It has a bulky belly with a maximum breadth of 2-3 mm. It was found to be medial to midportion of vertical limb of facial nerve. All of our temporal bones measured size varied from 9 to 11 mm in length excluding stapedial tendon. Stapedial tendon measured almost 2 mm. Muscle is classical sickle shaped with tendon acting like the handle of the sickle. It has a bulky tummy which forms the maximum breadth of 1-3 mm. Why to have a clear idea about the anatomy of stapedius muscle is that, unless the anatomy is clear there is chance of confusing the muscle with that of facial nerve while doing facial nerve grafting and also while drilling for facial nerve decompression in experienced hands may get confused and decompress the muscle. Stapedius muscle said to be the smallest muscle in the body, but its not as small as its been described. Detailed awareness of the anatomy of stapedius muscle is needed so as to avoid confusion while facial nerve grafting and while drilling.",Correlation of Eustachian Tube Dysfunction with Results of Tympanoplasty in Mucosal Type of Chronic Suppurative Otitis Media.,https://www.ncbi.nlm.nih.gov/pubmed/30906705,Indian journal of otolaryngology and head and neck surgery : official publication of the Association of Otolaryngologists of India,2019 03 29,"To Assess the relation between eustachian tube function and outcome of tympanoplasty in mucosal type of chronic suppurative otitis media, a prospective study was carried out over a period of one and half years (January 2016-July 2017) at a tertiary referral centre (Gujarat Cancer Society Medical College and Research Institute, Ahmedabad). Total 90 Patients of any age and sex and with Mucosal type of chronic suppurative otitis media and Patients with follow up of 12 months were selected. The Eustachian Tube function was assessed preoperatively by pressure swallow equalization test and impedance audiometry. All patients were categorized based on function of eustachian tube. All patients were operated by type 1 tympanoplasty with or without mastoidectomy. We measure the Graft uptake rate after type 1 tympanoplasty (with or without mastoidectomy) in patients with or without eustachian tube dysfunction. Graft uptake rate is higher in patients with normal or mild eustachian dysfunction compared to severe eustachian tube dysfunction. In our study we found 87% success rate in patients with normal Eustachian tube function, 80% in partially impaired Eustachian tube function, and 70% in totally impaired Eustachian tube. So, pre-operative planning in tympanoplasty surgery eustachian tube function assessment is must to increase graft uptake rate by preoperative utilization of decongestant.

Hydrogels possess both liquid and solid properties which allow them to overcome several shortfalls of both solid and liquid sensing platforms. Hydrogels offer a three dimensional platform which can house nanoparticles with different attributes (i.e. fluorescent QCD's) and prevents their aggregation. Here, we incorporate QCD's (made from the hydrothermal treatment of 1-naphthylamine and citric acid) into the matrix of a zinc oxide hydrogel. This nanocomposite was shown to have hexavalent chromium (Cr6+) specific fluorescence quenching properties. Detailed fluorescence analysis of the hydrogel with Cr6+ was conducted in a high throughput manner by loading the hydrogel into wells of a black 96-well plate. Fluorescence quenching of the hydrogel-QCD-nanocomposites in the presence of dilutions of Cr6+ was measured using a fluorescence spectrophotometer and showed incremental fluorescence decreases with increasing Cr6+ concentration. Furthermore, this was quantitatively confirmed by Stern-Volmer plots showing a linear quenching trend (R2 = 0.9975) when comparing fluorescence intensities against increasing Cr6+ concentrations (0.234-1.875 μM).

Emerging research on feedback highlights the importance of the learner, relationships, and culture for feedback to improve performance. We used the theory of self-regulated learning to develop the Prepare to Ask-Discuss-Ask-Plan Together (Prepare to ADAPT) framework to improve the feedback processes and investigated learner perceptions of this innovative feedback framework. Methods Qualitative thematic analysis of structured interviews of nine trainees participating in training on the Prepare to ADAPT feedback framework. Results  The framework appeared primarily to potentially decrease learner anxiety and stress around the feedback process by providing a simple, structured discourse pattern. We identified five contributing themes: (1) increased efficiency of the feedback process; (2) formation of coaching/teamwork relationships; (3) facilitation of reflection and goal identification; (4) increased frequency of the feedback; (5) increased usefulness of the feedback. Discussion The Prepare to ADAPT framework may help decrease stress and anxiety of the feedback by clarifying the process, applying a structure, and developing coaching relationships. The framework was found to be easy to use and increased the number of effective feedback conversations in this exploratory study.",Inaccurate Blood Pressure Readings in the Intensive Care Unit: An Observational Study.,https://www.ncbi.nlm.nih.gov/pubmed/30906677,Cureus,2019 03 29,"Measuring and monitoring cerebral perfusion pressure (CPP) is important in the management of patients with certain neurological conditions. To accurately reflect blood pressure at the circle of Willis, the arterial line transducer should be leveled at the tragus. This study measured the relative distance of the transducer to the tragus in 100 intensive care unit (ICU) patients in the mixed ICU at our institution, of which 44 patients had a pressure-sensitive neurological diagnosis. For neurological patients, the average distance was 10.9 cm and for non-neurological patients, the average distance was 11.4 cm (p-value: 0.60). This suggests that the arterial line transducer was leveled at approximately the same level regardless of pathology, potentially leading to falsely elevated CPP readings in patients with pressure-sensitive neurological pathology.",A Dyadic Data Analytic Primer: An Illustration with Mexican-origin Couples.,https://www.ncbi.nlm.nih.gov/pubmed/30906676,Journal of Latina/o psychology,2019 03 29,"Dyadic matched-pairs (each person paired with one other person) research designs that include parallel data from both members of a relationship dyad provide a rigorous method for examining questions of interdependence. These designs require the use of analytic methods that account for statistical dependencies due to dyad member characteristics and environments. Using structural equation modeling, we illustrate two alternative analytic approaches for distinguishable (nonexchangeable) two-wave dyadic data: (a) a hybrid of the two-intercept and actor-partner interdependence models and (b) a difference model. Few studies have used these rigorous analytic approaches to analyze dyadic data with Latinos, despite demographic shifts in the U.S. and the cultural relevance of family values and relationship interdependence for this population. As such, our illustrative data were drawn from a larger longitudinal study of Mexican-origin families, with husbands and wives both reporting on somatic symptoms and marital negativity (N = 246 marital dyads). Results revealed that Mexican-origin spouses' somatic symptoms related to increases in partners' marital negativity five years later. Prior levels of wives' marital negatively linked to more discrepancies in marital negativity five years later, whereas husbands' marital negativity related to fewer discrepancies. We conclude by discussing the benefits of prospective dyadic data designs for researchers examining questions related to Latino populations.","Is Worse Attention a Risk Factor for or a Consequence of Depression, or Are Worse Attention and Depression Better Accounted for by Stress?

These three hypotheses were tested in 523 adolescents assessed annually for depression, attentional functioning, and childhood/recent life stress. Baseline switching, sustained, and selective attention did not predict first onset of depression (foD) or depressive symptoms. Divided attention predicted depressive symptoms only. Piecewise growth modelling indicated that the trajectory of switching attention declined prior to foD; there was evidence of significant recovery in switching attention following foD. Structural equation modelling indicated that impaired switching attention prospectively predicted higher depressive symptoms and that higher depressive symptoms predicted worse selective and switching attention. Further, childhood stress prospectively predicted higher depressive symptoms via switching attention and worse switching attention via depressive symptoms.",Development of a Culturally Appropriate Smokeless Tobacco Cessation Program for American Indians.,https://www.ncbi.nlm.nih.gov/pubmed/30906672,Journal of health disparities research and practice,2019 03 29,"This study describes a multiphasic approach to the development of a smokeless tobacco cessation program targeted for American Indians (AI) of different tribal nations.

In humans, these precede the motor symptoms by decades. Previously developed and characterized transgenic mice expressing the mutant human α-synuclein gene (SNCA) (either A53T or A30P), but not the endogenous mouse Snca, serve as models for familial PD. These animals demonstrate both robust abnormalities in enteric nervous system (ENS) function as well as synuclein-immunoreactive aggregates in ENS ganglia by 3 months of age, recapitulating early gastrointestinal abnormalities seen before the gait impairment characteristics of human and murine PD. Posiphen is a translational inhibitor of α-synuclein that targets the 5' untranslated region (UTR) of SNCA mRNA and could be a potential drug for the treatment of PD. However, its efficacy in ameliorating symptoms of PD has not yet been evaluated. Here, we used these transgenic mouse models to investigate the efficacy of Posiphen in reversing the gastrointestinal dysfunction. We show that Posiphen normalizes the colonic motility of both transgenic mouse models, although it did not affect the Whole Gut Transit Time (WGTT). Pharmacokinetics studies revealed that Posiphen is more abundant in the brain than in blood, in agreement with its lipophilicity, and the main metabolite is N8-NorPosiphen, a molecule with similar properties as Posiphen. The brain Posiphen levels necessary to effect optimal function were calculated and compared with efficacious brain levels from previous studies, showing that a 2-3 mM concentration of Posiphen and metabolites is sufficient for functional efficacy. Finally, 10 mg/kg Posiphen reduced α-synuclein levels in the gut of hSNCAA53T mice treated for twenty-one weeks, while 50 and 65 mg/kg Posiphen reduced α-synuclein levels in the brain of hSNCAA53T mice treated for twenty-one days. In conclusion, this is the first study showing the preclinical efficacy of Posiphen in normalizing the colonic motility in mouse models of gastrointestinal dysfunction in early PD. This result is in agreement with the ability of Posiphen to reach the nervous system, and its mechanism of action, the translational inhibition of α-synuclein expression. These significant findings support further development of Posiphen as a drug for the treatment of PD.","Patent Application Trends of Induced Pluripotent Stem Cell Technologies in the United States, Japanese, and European Applications.",https://www.ncbi.nlm.nih.gov/pubmed/30906670,BioResearch open access,2019 03 29,"Patent application trends were investigated for induced pluripotent stem cell (iPSC) technologies, particularly disease-specific cell technologies related to iPSCs, in the U.S., Japanese, and European applications during 2017.

Using tyramide signal amplification (TSA) based fluorescent multiplexed immunohistochemistry in situ, we evaluated the distribution and frequency of B cell subsets in two independent HCC cohorts (n = 619). The results were further confirmed by flow cytometry. Correlations of B cell subsets with clinicopathologic features and patient prognosis were analyzed. Five B cell subsets were defined by multiplexed immunohistochemistry and each subset was clearly separated by t-SNE dimension reduction analysis. Notably, the densities of all B cell subsets were significantly decreased in the tumor. The frequency of plasma cells within B cells was most abundant in the tumor. In training cohort (n = 258), high densities of tumor-infiltrating CD20+ B cells, naive B cells, IgM+ memory B cells, CD27- isotype-switched memory B cells, and plasma cells were associated with superior survival. Multivariate analysis further identified CD20+ B cells, naive B cells, and CD27- isotype-switched memory B cells as independent prognosticators for survival. Unsupervised cluster analysis confirmed increased B cell subsets harbored superior survival. In addition, high density of B cells was correlated with smaller tumor size and well differentiation. The results were validated in the independent cohort of 361 HCC patients. Intratumor infiltration of B cells is significantly impaired during HCC progression. High densities of tumor-infiltrating B cells imply a better clinical outcome. Therapies designed to target B cells may be a novel strategy in HCC.",Targeting intrinsic RIG-I signaling turns melanoma cells into type I interferon-releasing cellular antitumor vaccines.,https://www.ncbi.nlm.nih.gov/pubmed/30906666,Oncoimmunology,2019 03 29,"Resistance to cell death and evasion of immunosurveillance are major causes of cancer persistence and progression. Tumor cell-intrinsic activation of the RNA receptor retinoic acid-inducible gene-I (RIG-I) can trigger an immunogenic form of programmed tumor cell death, but its impact on antitumor responses remains largely unexplored. We show that activation of intrinsic RIG-I signaling induces melanoma cell death that enforces cross-presentation of tumor-associated antigens by bystander dendritic cells. This results in systemic expansion and activation of tumor-antigen specific T cells in vivo with subsequent regression of pre-established melanoma. These processes were dependent on the signaling hub MAVS and type I interferon (IFN-I) signaling in the host cell. Using melanoma cells deficient for the transcription factors IRF3 and IRF7, we demonstrate that RIG-I-activated tumor cells used as a vaccine are a relevant source of IFN-I during T cell cross-priming in vivo. Thus, our findings may facilitate translational development of personalized anticancer vaccines."

In cancer, suppressive immune checkpoints are often hyper-activated to ensure an effective evasion of tumor cells from immune surveillance. These immune checkpoints include in part, the B7/butyrophilin-like receptors such as butyrophilin sub-family 3A/CD277 receptors (BTN3A), the B and T lymphocyte attenuator (BTLA) belonging to the B7-like receptors and the programmed death protein (PD-1) with its ligand PD-L1. We evaluated the plasma level of these markers in 32 PDAC patients (learning cohort) by ad hoc developed ELISA's and showed that there are highly correlated. We used ROC curves and univariate analysis to characterize their prognostic relevance in these patients and showed that their plasma level can serve as survival predictor. Plasma level thresholds that correlate with less than six months survival were established for sPD-1 (>8.6 ng/ml), sPD-L1 (>0.36 ng/ml), sBTLA (>1.91 ng/ml), sBTN3A1 (>6.98 ng/ml) and pan-sBTN3A (>6.92 ng/ml). These thresholds were applied in independent validation cohort composed by 27 new samples and could efficiently discriminate short versus long PDAC survivors.

Following vaccination, reactivity to three HLA class I- and five HLA class II-restricted candidate neoantigens were detected by IFN-γ ELISPOT in peripheral blood. A similar pattern of reactivity was observed among isolated post-treatment tumor-infiltrating lymphocytes. Genomic analysis of pre- and post-treatment GBM reflected clonal remodeling. These data demonstrate the feasibility and translational potential of a therapeutic neoantigen-based vaccine approach in patients with primary CNS tumors.",Cancer vaccines: designing artificial synthetic long peptides to improve presentation of class I and class II T cell epitopes by dendritic cells.,https://www.ncbi.nlm.nih.gov/pubmed/30906653,Oncoimmunology,2019 03 29,"There is now a consensus that efficient peptide vaccination against cancer requires that peptides should (i) be exclusively presented by professional APC and (ii) stimulate both CD4 and CD8-specific T cell responses. To this aim, in recent trials, patients were vaccinated with pools of synthetic long peptides (SLP) (15-30 aa long) composed of a potential class I epitope(s) elongated at both ends with native antigen sequences to also provide a potential class II epitope(s). Using MELOE-1 as a model antigen, we present an alternative strategy consisting in linking selected class I and class II epitopes with an artificial cathepsin-sensitive linker to improve epitope processing and presentation by DC. We provide evidence that some linker sequences used in our artificial SLPs (aSLPs) could increase up to 100-fold the cross-presentation of class I epitopes to CD8-specific T cell clones when compared to cross-presentation of the corresponding native long peptide. Presentation of class II epitopes were only slightly increased. We confirmed this increased cross-presentation after in vitro stimulation of PBMC from healthy donors with aSLP and assessment of CD8-specific responses and also in vivo following aSLP vaccination of HLA*A0201/HLA-DRB0101 transgenic mice. Finally, we provide some evidence that vaccination with aSLP could inhibit the growth of transplanted tumors in mice. Our data thus support the use of such aSLPs in future cancer vaccination trials to improve anti-tumor CD8 T cell responses and therapeutic efficacy.",Immune evasion by TGFβ-induced miR-183 repression of MICA/B expression in human lung tumor cells.,https://www.ncbi.nlm.nih.gov/pubmed/30906652,Oncoimmunology,2019 03 29,"Immune escape is a hallmark of cancer. In human lung cancer, we have identified a unique microRNA (miR)-based pathway employed by tumor cells to repress detection by immune cells via the NKG2D-MICA/B receptor-ligand system. MICA/B is readily induced by cell transformation and serves as a danger signal and ligand to alert NK and activated CD8+ T cells. However, immunohistochemical analysis indicated that human lung adenocarcinoma and squamous cell carcinoma specimens express little MICA/B while high levels of miR-183 were detected in both tumor types in a TCGA database. Human lung tumor cell lines confirmed the reverse relationship in expression of MICA/B and miR-183. Importantly, a miR-183 binding site was identified on the 3'untranslated region (UTR) of both MICA and MICB, suggesting its role in MICA/B regulation. Luciferase reporter constructs bearing the 3'UTR of MICA or MICB in 293 cells supported the function of miR-183 in repressing MICA/B expression. Additionally, anti-sense miR-183 transfection into H1355 or H1299 tumor cells caused the upregulation of MICA/B. Abundant miR-183 expression in tumor cells was traced to transforming growth factor-beta (TGFβ), as evidenced by antisense TGFβ transfection into H1355 or H1299 tumor cells which subsequently lost miR-183 expression accompanied by MICA/B upregulation. Most significantly, anti-sense miR-183 transfected tumor cells became more sensitive to lysis by activated CD8+ T cells that express high levels of NKG2D. Thus, high miR-183 triggered by TGFβ expressed in lung tumor cells can target MICA/B expression to circumvent detection by NKG2D on immune cells.",Making cold malignant pleural effusions hot: driving novel immunotherapies.,https://www.ncbi.nlm.nih.gov/pubmed/30906651,Oncoimmunology,2019 03 29,"Malignant pleural effusions, arising from either primary mesotheliomas or secondary malignancies, heralds advanced disease and poor prognosis. Current treatments, including therapeutic thoracentesis and tube thoracostomy, are largely palliative. The immunosuppressive environment within the pleural cavity includes myeloid derived suppressor cells, T-regulatory cells, and dysfunctional T cells. The advent of effective immunotherapy with checkpoint inhibitors and adoptive cell therapies for lung cancer and other malignancies suggests a renewed examination of local and systemic therapies for this malady. Prior strategies reporting remarkable success, including instillation of the cytokine interleukin-2, perhaps coupled with checkpoint inhibitors, should be further evaluated in the modern era.",A Simple and Fast Method for Derivation of blastocyst-like cell aggregates (BLCAs) from Murine Embryonic Stem Cells.,https://www.ncbi.nlm.nih.gov/pubmed/30906649,Journal of biomaterials and tissue engineering,2019 03 29,"The study of blastocyst differentiation from stem cells is still at its stage of infancy. In this study, a simple and efficient method was developed to derive blastocyst-like cell aggregates (BLCAs) from murine embryonic stem cells (mESCs). This was achieved by culturing the mESCs in non-adherent dishes.0020BLCAs (13±2 per million mESCs) were obtained in only 5 days and they were found to express the protein and gene markers of trophoblasts. Furthermore, the BLCAs showed the normal trophoblasts' capability of penetrating the uterine wall after being transferred into pseudo-pregnant mice, indicating the trophoblast-like functionality of the derived BLCAs. Collectively, we successfully developed a simple and fast 3D suspension culture approach to differentiate mESCs into BLCAs, which may provide important clues into the development of early embryos and stem cells. This may also offer a simple and efficient approach to isolate trophoblast cells for studying the native microenvironment of pluripotent stem cells without the need to sacrifice animals.","A portable device for nucleic acid quantification powered by sunlight, a flame or electricity.",https://www.ncbi.nlm.nih.gov/pubmed/30906647,Nature biomedical engineering,2019 06 14,"A decentralized approach to diagnostics can decrease the time to treatment of infectious diseases in resource-limited settings. Yet most modern diagnostic tools require stable electricity and are not portable. Here, we describe a portable device for isothermal nucleic-acid quantification that can operate with power from electricity, sunlight or a flame, and that can store heat from intermittent energy sources, for operation when electrical power is not available or reliable. We deployed the device in two Ugandan health clinics, where it successfully operated through multiple power outages, with equivalent performance when powered via sunlight or electricity. A direct comparison between the portable device and commercial qPCR (quantitative polymerase chain reaction) machines for samples from 71 Ugandan patients (29 of which were tested in Uganda) for the presence of Kaposi's sarcoma-associated herpesvirus DNA showed 94% agreement, with the four discordant samples having the lowest concentration of the herpesvirus DNA. The device's flexibility in power supply provides a needed solution for on-field diagnostics.",Rational design of silicon structures for optically controlled multiscale biointerfaces.,https://www.ncbi.nlm.nih.gov/pubmed/30906646,Nature biomedical engineering,2019 04 18,"Silicon-based materials have been widely used. However, remotely controlled and interconnect-free silicon configurations have been rarely explored, because of limited fundamental understanding of the complex physicochemical processes that occur at interfaces between silicon and biological materials. Here, we describe rational design principles, guided by biology, for establishing intracellular, intercellular and extracellular silicon-based interfaces, where the silicon and the biological targets have matched properties. We focused on light-induced processes at these interfaces, and developed a set of matrices to quantify and differentiate the capacitive, Faradaic and thermal outputs from about 30 different silicon materials in saline. We show that these interfaces are useful for the light-controlled non-genetic modulation of intracellular calcium dynamics, of cytoskeletal structures and transport, of cellular excitability, of neurotransmitter release from brain slices, and of brain activity in vivo.",Implantable pre-metastatic niches for the study of the microenvironmental regulation of disseminated human tumour cells.,https://www.ncbi.nlm.nih.gov/pubmed/30906645,Nature biomedical engineering,2019 04 22,"Cancer survivors often carry disseminated tumour cells (DTCs), yet owing to DTC dormancy they do not relapse from treatment. Understanding how the local microenvironment regulates the transition of DTCs from a quiescent state to active proliferation could suggest new therapeutic strategies to prevent or delay the formation of metastases. Here, we show that implantable biomaterial microenvironments incorporating human stromal cells, immune cells and cancer cells can be used to examine the post-dissemination phase of the evolution of the tumour microenvironment. After subdermal implantation in mice, porous hydrogel scaffolds seeded with human bone marrow stromal cells form a vascularized niche and recruit human circulating tumour cells released from an orthotopic prostate tumour xenograft. Systemic injection of human peripheral blood mononuclear cells slowed the evolution of the active metastatic niches but did not change the rate of overt metastases, as the ensuing inflammation promoted the formation of DTC colonies. Implantable pre-metastatic niches might enable the study of DTC colonization and proliferation, and facilitate the development of effective anti-metastatic therapies.",Combining peptide TNIIIA2 with all-trans retinoic acid accelerates N-Myc protein degradation and neuronal differentiation in MYCN-amplified neuroblastoma cells.,https://www.ncbi.nlm.nih.gov/pubmed/30906641,American journal of cancer research,2019 03 29,"Neuroblastoma is one of the common solid tumors of childhood. Nearly half of neuroblastoma patients are classified into the high-risk group, and their 5-year event-free survival (EFS) rates remain unsatisfactory in the range of 30-40%. High-risk neuroblastoma is characterized by amplification of the MYCN gene and excessive expression of its protein product, N-Myc. Because N-Myc is a transcription factor for various pro-proliferative proteins, the excessive expression causes aberrant or blocked neuronal differentiation during development of sympathetic nervous system, which is a central aspect of neuroblastoma genesis. The current main treatment for high-risk neuroblastoma is intensive chemotherapy using anti-cancer drugs that induce apoptosis in tumor cells, but intensive chemotherapy has another serious risk of long-lasting side effects, so-called ""late effects"", that occur many years after chemotherapy has ended. As a solution for such situation, differentiation therapy has been expected as a mild chemotherapy with a low risk of late effects, and an application of retinoic acid (RA) and its derivatives as treatment for high-risk neuroblastoma has long been attempted. However, the clinical outcome has not been sufficient with the use of retinoids, including all-trans retinoic acid (ATRA), mainly because of the inhibition of differentiation caused by N-Myc. In the present study, we succeeded in synergistically accelerating the ATRA-induced neuronal differentiation of MYCN-amplified neuroblastoma cells by combining a peptide derived from tenascin-C, termed TNIIIA2, which has a potent ability to activate β1-integrins. Accelerated differentiation was caused by a decrease in N-Myc protein level in neuroblastoma cells after the combined treatment of TNIIIA2 with ATRA. That is, combination treatment using ATRA with TNIIIA2 induced proteasomal degradation in the N-Myc oncoprotein of neuroblastoma cells with MYCN gene amplification, and this caused acceleration of neuronal differentiation and attenuation of malignant properties. Furthermore, an in vivo experiment using a xenograft mouse model showed a therapeutic potential of the combination administration of ATRA and TNIIIA2 for high-risk neuroblastoma. These results provide a new insight into differentiation therapy for high-risk neuroblastoma based on N-Myc protein degradation."

E2F1 binds preferentially to RB and accelerates the cell cycle in most cancer cells. However, it is thought that E2F1 modulates cell proliferation in other ways as well. Herein, it has been discovered that in pathological tissues derived from hepatocellular carcinoma (HCC) patients, E2F1 correlates positively with IQGAP3 and that both of these factors are highly expressed (N = 164, R = 0.6716). In addition, a high level of E2F1 or IQGAP3 predicted poor survival in HCC patients. Further study determined that E2F1 transactivates IQGAP3, the GTPase binding protein in MHCC-97H cells. Co-immunoprecipitation analysis indicated that IQGAP3 interacts with PKCδ and competitively inhibits the interaction between PKCδ and PKCα, resulting in phosphorylation of PKCα activation and promotion of cell proliferation. This study reveals that highly expressed E2F1 not only transactivates cell-cycle-related factors but also promotes HCC proliferation by activating the phosphorylation of PKCα.",The positive feedback loop of lncRNA DANCR/miR-138/Sox4 facilitates malignancy in non-small cell lung cancer.,https://www.ncbi.nlm.nih.gov/pubmed/30906628,American journal of cancer research,2019 03 29,"Non-small cell lung cancer (NSCLC) is one of the most frequent cancers worldwide. The abnormal expression of long non-coding RNAs (lncRNAs) has been reported to be closely associated with the progression of human cancers, including NSCLC. Here, we demonstrated that differentiation antagonizing noncoding RNA (DANCR) was overexpressed in NSCLC tissues. Upregulation of DANCR expression was significantly associated with larger tumor size, advanced TNM stage and lymph node metastasis, and also predicted poor prognoses of patients with NSCLC. Functional experiments showed that DANCR enhanced NSCLC growth and metastasis both in vitro and in vivo. Further investigation revealed that DANCR could compete with the Sox4 mRNA to bind with miR-138, thus affecting Sox4 expression. In addition, we found that Sox4 bound to the promoter regions of DANCR gene to activate DANCR expression, suggesting a positive feedback loop of DANCR/miR-138/Sox4 in NSCLC. Taken together, these results provide a comprehensive analysis of the roles of DANCR as a competing endogenous RNA (ceRNA) in NSCLC progression.",MicroRNA-940 inhibits glioma progression by blocking mitochondrial folate metabolism through targeting of MTHFD2.,https://www.ncbi.nlm.nih.gov/pubmed/30906627,American journal of cancer research,2019 03 29,"The aggressiveness and recurrence of glioma are major obstacles for the treatment of this type of tumor. Further understanding of the molecular mechanisms of glioma is necessary to improve the efficacy of therapy. MicroRNAs have been widely studied in many human cancers. Here, we found that miR-940 was one of the primary downregulated miRNAs in clinical samples and glioma cell lines through bioinformatics analysis and qRT-PCR. Upregulating miR-940 expression significantly inhibited the proliferation and invasion and promoted apoptosis of U87 and U118 cells. In addition, experiments in vivo showed that upregulation of miR-940 expression inhibited xenograft growth. Methylenetetrahydrofolate dehydrogenase (MTHFD2), a dual-functional metabolic enzyme, is involved in the one-carbon metabolism of folate in mitochondria. We found MTHFD2 to be overexpressed in glioma tissues and our clinical samples by qRT-PCR and Western blot assays. Through TargetScan prediction and luciferase assays, we found that miR-940 directly targets MTHFD2. Upregulation of miR-940 expression inhibited the expression of MTHFD2 and led to intracellular one-carbon metabolism dysfunction. Furthermore, the antitumor effects of miR-940 could be attenuated by overexpression of MTHFD2. Together, the results of our study suggest that miR-940 may be a new therapeutic target for the treatment of glioma through targeting of MTHFD2.","Interplay between heat shock proteins, inflammation and cancer: a potential cancer therapeutic target.",https://www.ncbi.nlm.nih.gov/pubmed/30906626,American journal of cancer research,2019 03 29,"The historical relationship between cancer and inflammation has long been evaluated, and dates back to the early work of Virchow (1863), where he hypothesised that chronic inflammation as a direct cause of tissue injury and infection, could actually promote tissue proliferation. At that period in time however, the exact mechanisms that mediated this relationship were little understood. Subsequent studies have since then demonstrated that chronic inflammation plays significant roles in microenvironments, mostly in the progression of tumours, probably, through over-secretion of proinflammatory cytokines and other immune-killing apparatus such as reactive oxygen species (ROS) which cause damage to normal cells leading to DNA damage and increased cellular mutation rates. Recently, the identification of DNA lesion 5-chlorocytosine (5-CIC) created by hypochlorous acid (HOCl) secreted to nullify or kill infectious agents and toll-like receptor 4 (TLR4)-mediated chronic inflammation in the human gut, has become the latest evidence linking inflammation directly to cancer. The key to cellular survival and adaptation under unfavourable or pathological conditions is the expression of heat shock proteins (HSPs) also called molecular chaperones. These proteins play essential roles in DNA repair processes by maintaining membrane integrity, orderliness and stability of client proteins that play prominent roles in DNA repair mechanisms. More so, HSPs have also been shown to modulate the effects of pro-inflammatory/apoptotic cytokines through the inhibition of cascades leading to the generation of ROS-mediated DNA damage, while promoting the DNA repair mechanism, thus playing prominent roles in various stages of DNA repair and cancer progression. Hence, studies targeting HSPs and their inhibitors in inflammation, DNA damage, and repair, could improve current cancer therapeutic efficiency. Here the focus will be on the relationship between HSPs, inflammation and cancer, as well as roles of HSPs in DNA damage response (DDR).",Target selection of CAR T cell therapy in accordance with the TME for solid tumors.,https://www.ncbi.nlm.nih.gov/pubmed/30906625,American journal of cancer research,2019 03 29,"Chimeric antigen receptor-engineered T (CAR T) cell therapy has made great progress in hematological malignancies and resulted in two newly FDA-approved drugs specific for CD19, Kymriah and Yescarta. To some extent, this success is attributable to the appropriately selected antigen, CD19, a cell surface protein that is uniformly and strongly expressed on malignant B cells. This result indicates that a proper CAR target is of great importance to the success of this technique. Another key factor contributing to the success of hematological malignancies can be ascribed to the nonphysical tumor microenvironment (TME). The TME in solid tumors is complicated and has a specific niche favorable for tumor progression with physical barriers, multiple mechanisms of immunosuppression, and a variety of biochemical factors, thus resulting in limited efficacy of CAR T cell therapy in clinical trials with cancer patients. Therefore, the inhospitable solid TME becomes a major hurdle in translating the success of CAR T cell therapy in hematological malignancies to solid tumors. Here, we provide our perspective on how to improve the success of CAR T therapy in solid tumors by focusing on the aspects of target selection and the related TME in CAR T cell design, especially stressing the interplay between them. With four kinds of antigenic CAR targets as examples in this review, we anticipate that the overall consideration of both factors will further expand CAR T cell therapy in clinical trials.",The role of cholesterol metabolism in cancer.,https://www.ncbi.nlm.nih.gov/pubmed/30906624,American journal of cancer research,2019 03 29,"Cholesterol plays an important role in cancer development. Both clinical and experimental studies have found that hypercholesterolemia and a high-fat high-cholesterol diet can affect cancer development. External cholesterol can directly activate the oncogenic Hedgehog pathway, and internal cholesterol can induce mTORC1 signaling. Cholesterol is a key component of lipid rafts, which are the major platforms for signaling regulation in cancer, and chelating membrane cholesterol is an effective anti-cancer strategy that disrupts the functions of lipid rafts. Cholesterol metabolism is often reprogrammed in cancer cells. Targeting cholesterol metabolism as a new therapeutic approach has received increasing attention. Here, we summarize some key molecular mechanisms supporting the use of anti-cholesterol therapy for cancer treatment.",Compound-therapy based on cancer-immunity cycle: promising prospects for antitumor regimens.,https://www.ncbi.nlm.nih.gov/pubmed/30906623,American journal of cancer research,2019 03 29,"Immunotherapy has made a significant impact on the survival of patients with different tumor. However, it has become clear that they are not sufficiently active durable responses for many tumor patients, but only in a fraction of tumor patients. In order to improve this, combination regimens revealed impressive synergistic effects by combination of doublet or triplet immune agents. In this article, we will summarize the cancer-immunity cycle (CIC) and propose a rationale for the design of synergistic antitumor combinations. In addition, key issues in the development of these strategies are further discussed. Overall, we wish to highlight the backbone principles of combination regimens design at different points of the CIC, with the ultimate goal to guide better designs for future cancer combination therapies.",The metabolic modulator PGC-1α in cancer.,https://www.ncbi.nlm.nih.gov/pubmed/30906622,American journal of cancer research,2019 03 29,"The peroxisome proliferator-activated receptor gamma coactivator 1 alpha (PGC-1α) is a central modulator of cell metabolism. It regulates mitochondrial biogenesis and oxidative metabolism.

International Conference on Knowledge Discovery & Data Mining,2019 03 29,"Deep learning methods have shown great success in pixel-wise prediction tasks. One of the most popular methods employs an encoder-decoder network in which deconvolutional layers are used for up-sampling feature maps. However, a key limitation of the deconvolutional layer is that it suffers from the checkerboard artifact problem, which harms the prediction accuracy. This is caused by the independency among adjacent pixels on the output feature maps. Previous work only solved the checkerboard artifact issue of deconvolutional layers in the 2D space. Since the number of intermediate feature maps needed to generate a deconvolutional layer grows exponentially with dimensionality, it is more challenging to solve this issue in higher dimensions. In this work, we propose the voxel deconvolutional layer (VoxelDCL) to solve the checkerboard artifact problem of deconvolutional layers in 3D space. We also provide an efficient approach to implement VoxelDCL. To demonstrate the effectiveness of VoxelDCL, we build four variations of voxel deconvolutional networks (VoxelDCN) based on the U-Net architecture with VoxelDCL. We apply our networks to address volumetric brain images labeling tasks using the ADNI and LONI LPBA40 datasets. The experimental results show that the proposed iVoxelDCNa achieves improved performance in all experiments. It reaches 83.34% in terms of dice ratio on the ADNI dataset and 79.12% on the LONI LPBA40 dataset, which increases 1.39% and 2.21% respectively compared with the baseline. In addition, all the variations of VoxelDCN we proposed outperform the baseline methods on the above datasets, which demonstrates the effectiveness of our methods.",HUMAN-INSPIRED ALGEBRAIC CURVES FOR WEARABLE ROBOT CONTROL.,https://www.ncbi.nlm.nih.gov/pubmed/30906619,Proceedings of the ASME Dynamic Systems and Control Conference.

In the rehabilitation robotics literature, control approaches that unify the gait cycle of wearable robots are more appealing than the conventional approaches that rely on dividing the gait cycle into several periods, each with their own distinct controllers. In this article we propose employing algebraic curves to represent human walking data for wearable robot controller design. In order to generate algebraic curves from human walking data, we employ the 3L fitting algorithm, a tool developed in the pattern recognition literature for fitting implicit polynomial curves to given datasets. For an impedance model of the knee joint motion driven by the hip angle signal, we provide conditions by which the generated algebraic curves satisfy a robust relative degree condition throughout the entire walking gait cycle. The robust relative degree property makes the algebraic curve representation of walking gaits amenable to various nonlinear output tracking controller design techniques."

Studies have reported conflicting results of the association of a common nonsynonymous variant, E158K (rs2266782), with hypertension. We examined the associations of E158K, along with rare and low frequency exonic variants (minor allele frequency [MAF]<5%) in FMO3 with hypertension, systolic blood pressure (SBP), and diastolic blood pressure (DBP). We included 7,350 European Americans and 2,814 African Americans in the Atherosclerosis Risk in Communities (ARIC) study with exome sequencing of FMO3. The association of FMO3 variants with SBP and DBP was tested using single variant and gene-based tests followed by the replication or interrogation of significant variants in ancestry-specific cohorts based on Bonferroni corrected thresholds. E158K had significant association with higher SBP in African Americans in ARIC (p=0.03), and two low frequency variants had significant association with higher SBP in African Americans (rs200985584, MAF 0.1%, p=0.0003) and European Americans (rs75904274, MAF 1.7%, p=0.006).

Currently, the general strategies for BRVO are symptomatic therapies. Cardiovascular aspects are essential risk factors for BRVO. The traditional Chinese medicine hexuemingmu (HXMM), consisting of tanshinol and baicalin, dilates the vasculature and accelerates microcirculation. Therefore, the aim of this study was to determine the efficacy and possible mechanism of HXMM in a BRVO rat model established by laser photocoagulation. Successful BRVO rat models were treated with different doses of HXMM. Fundus photography and fluorescein fundus angiography (FFA) of the animals were applied. The retinal layers were measured by optical coherence tomography (OCT). Full-field electroretinography (ffERG) was applied to evaluate the retinal function. The ear vein flow velocity was measured via a microcirculation detector. The expression of the vascular endothelial growth factor (VEGF-α) was measured via western blotting and immunofluorescent staining. Our study found that retinal edema predominantly occurred in the inner nuclear layer (INL) and outer nuclear layer (ONL). The retinal edema of the treated groups was significantly relieved in the early stage of BRVO as visualized via OCT detection and HE staining. The amplitudes of the b wave and oscillatory potentials (OPs) waves of ffERG in the treated groups were increased compared with those of the control group at several detection points (3, 5, 7, 10, 14, and 21 d postocclusion). The expression of VEGF-α was reduced in the treated groups at an early stage of BRVO. Furthermore, the ear vein flow velocity of the HXMM treatment groups was faster than that of the control group. Thus, our study indicates that the traditional Chinese medicine HXMM could ameliorate retinal edema and rescue the retinal structure and function in BRVO models through promoting occluded vein recanalization, improving microcirculation, and regulating the expression of VEGF-α.",Quantitative Assessment of Outer Retinal Layer and Photoreceptor Outer Segment Layer and Their Relation to Visual Acuity in Diabetic Macular Edema.,https://www.ncbi.nlm.nih.gov/pubmed/30906587,Journal of ophthalmology,2019 03 29,"To compare outer retinal layer (ORL) thickness and photoreceptor outer segment (PROS) length between normal eyes and eyes with diabetic macular edema (DME), and also, to study the correlation between central macular thicknesses (CMT), ORL, and PROS length with best corrected visual acuity (BCVA) in DME.",Management of Corneal Ectasia after LASIK with Phototherapeutic Keratectomy Combined with Photorefractive Keratectomy and Collagen Cross-Linking.,https://www.ncbi.nlm.nih.gov/pubmed/30906586,Journal of ophthalmology,2019 03 29,"To evaluate the efficacy of phototherapeutic keratectomy (PTK) combined with photorefractive keratectomy (PRK) and riboflavin with ultraviolet-A collagen cross-linking (CXL), performed sequentially on the same day, in the management of corneal ectasia after LASIK.",Chest drain and thoracotomy for chest trauma.,https://www.ncbi.nlm.nih.gov/pubmed/30906584,Journal of thoracic disease,2019 03 29,"Traumas are the leading cause of death in the first four decades of life. Nevertheless, thoracic traumas only seldom require invasive procedures. In particular, chest drain placement is required in case of pleural disruption causing haemothorax, pneumothorax or haemopneumothorax. Although large-bore chest drains have been traditionally used in case of haemothorax, recent evidences seem to question this routine, showing good performances of small-bore and pig tail drains. Although it is a common procedures, experience and training is needed to avoid complications which might be even lethal. Surgical exploration after thoracic trauma is rare, accounting for less than 3% of traumas. Penetrating traumas more likely require surgical exploration compared to blunt trauma. Anterolateral thoracotomy is usually performed in this setting, but also clamshell or hemi-clamshell approach can be used. In selected patients, minimally invasive techniques can be performed. Large randomized trials are still needed to assess and standardized the role of new tools and procedures in the thoracic trauma setting.",Surgical management of chronic diaphragmatic hernias.,https://www.ncbi.nlm.nih.gov/pubmed/30906583,Journal of thoracic disease,2019 03 29,"Chronic diaphragmatic hernia (CDH) is an uncommon disease which may be associated with significant morbidity and mortality. Antecedent (even many months or years before CDH development) blunt or penetrating thoracic/thoraco-abdominal trauma is generally recognized. A wide spectrum of different mechanisms of injury, timing in presentation, size of the diaphragmatic defect, types and amount of abdominal viscera herniated into the chest cavity, clinical symptoms are observed in CDHs. Thoracic and abdominal CT scan (with coronal, axial and sagittal reconstructions) is the best diagnostic tool; sometimes thoracic MRI is needed to better define the extent of the diaphragmatic defect and the number of abdominal organs displaced into the chest cavity. Surgery (sometimes urgent) represents the treatment of choice for CDH; diaphragmatic hernia direct repair with a tension-free suture is generally attempted; in case of very large defects or when a tension-free suture is deemed unfeasible, the use of prosthesis is recommended. This review article will discuss about CDH aetiology, clinical presentation diagnosis and surgical treatment.",Management of traumatic esophageal injuries.,https://www.ncbi.nlm.nih.gov/pubmed/30906582,Journal of thoracic disease,2019 03 29,"Traumatic esophageal perforations are rare but difficult to treat injuries. We review the principles of work-up, anatomy and treatment of cervical, thoracic and abdominal traumatic esophageal perforations. Management is dictated by location of the perforation and any concurrent injuries. The majority of cases are amenable to primary repair with flap re-enforcement. Other principles include adequate drainage around the repair, decompression of the esophagus and stomach (via nasogastric tube or gastrostomy tube) and distal enteral nutrition (feeding jejunostomy).",Blast injures to the thorax.,https://www.ncbi.nlm.nih.gov/pubmed/30906581,Journal of thoracic disease,2019 03 29,"One out of 10 of military casualties and 6-9 out of 10 civilian victims of terror incidents suffer pulmonary blast injuries when the attackers use explosives as weapon. No specific therapy exists for the primary, shock-wave injury to the lung. The treatment protocols are based on mechanical ventilation, intensive therapy and supportive care. Secondary and tertiary blast structural injuries to the thorax require damage control surgery, dominated by pleural space management (drainage) and haemorrhage control (thoracotomy if needed). Parenchyma resection of irreversibly destroyed lung is rarely needed, and non-anatomical resections are to be preferred. Delayed chest wall reconstruction follows haemodynamic stabilisation and completion of demarcation process. Blast injury to the chest requires a multidisciplinary approach, where the outcome is strongly influenced by the concomitant injuries.",Thoracic damage control surgery.,https://www.ncbi.nlm.nih.gov/pubmed/30906580,Journal of thoracic disease,2019 03 29,"Thoracic damage control surgery (TDCS) is a decision making tool and derivate of the damage control concept (DCC), where physiological stabilization has a priority over anatomical reconstruction under the pressure of time. Intrathoracic haemorrhage control and pleural decompression are the two main immediate tasks of TDCS, while definitive procedures follow when the patient is stabilised in 24-48 hours. The focus of the thoracic surgeon is on the prevention of the haemorrhage induced coagulopathy, metabolic acidosis and hypothermy formed triad of death. Surgical haemorrhage control and pleural space decompression are to be performed. The individual patients benefit from TDCS procedures whose condition is too severe for a complex immediate reconstruction (polytrauma). Life threatening chest injuries in multiple/mass casualty scenarios in civilian and military environment alike are triaged and treated accordingly. Onset of acute mismatch between the resources (available hands, OP theaters, resources, hardware) and the needs (number and severity of chest trauma cases), a mindset shift should take place, where time and space the two main limiting factors. Airway obstruction, tension haemo/pneumothorax falls into the preventable death category. Chest drainage and emergency thoracotomy are the two main procedures offered by TDCS. An intervention structured organ/injury specific list of procedures is detailed. This is a mix of emergency surgery and cardiothoracic surgery, where less is more. TDSC is not the Holy Grail found to solve all complex thoracic trauma cases, but is a good tool to increase the chance for survival in challenging, and frequently quite hopeless situations.",Diaphragm and transdiaphragmatic injuries.,https://www.ncbi.nlm.nih.gov/pubmed/30906579,Journal of thoracic disease,2019 03 29,"The incidence of traumatic diaphragmatic rupture (TDR) is around 0.5% of all trauma patients, located more frequently on the left side (80%), with penetrating trauma being more predominantly the cause (63%) than blunt injuries (37%). TDR typically develops during thoracoabdominal injuries and outcome depends on the severity of the associated organ lesion. Diagnosis is sometimes very difficult: chest X-ray can verify TDR in only 25-70% of cases, although the specificity of a multidetector computed tomography (MDCT) is 100% and 83% for left and right-sided ruptures, respectively. When TDR is a part of a polytrauma, the management of the patient must follow the ATLS (Advanced Trauma Life Support) protocol and surgery is rarely based on the primary survey. The usual scenario involves cases detected during the secondary survey. In acute cases approach is determined by the site of the life-threatening injuries. In the daily surgical routine, in cases of acute TDR, laparotomy provides the best approach to manage the associated abdominal injuries and diaphragmatic rupture. Alternatively a transthoracic approach offer access to reconstruction in cases of delayed. A transdiaphragmatic procedure is offered when during an exploration (laparotomy or thoracotomy), any sign of an injury (bleeding, perforation) is verified through the rupture of the diaphragm in the other cavity (abdomen or chest and vice versa): the injury via a transdiaphragmatic way can be managed. Usually, a simple and small rupture up to 5-6 cm can be reconstructed with No. 0 or 1 monofilament non-absorbable or absorbable interrupted sutures, while for larger defects, interrupted figure-of-eight or horizontal mattress sutures are required. Mesh prosthesis is rarely needed."
