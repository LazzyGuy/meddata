The dislocation has a low incidence rate and is often missed in the emergency department as physical and radiology signs are subtle. Treatment consists of closed or open reduction and immobilisation. When it is not recognised it is associated with significant peroneal nerve injury.,Placental chorioangioma associated with polyhydramnios and hydrops fetalis.,https://www.ncbi.nlm.nih.gov/pubmed/30700468,BMJ case reports,2019 05 13,"A 27-year-old multigravida woman was noted on routine growth scan at 27 weeks gestation to have a central placental hypoechoic area measuring 6.7×6.0×4.4 cm. A subsequent magnetic resonance scan confirmed a solid mass in the placenta lying anteriorly; therefore, a preliminary diagnosis of giant placental chorioangioma was made. A repeat ultrasound scan at 30 weeks gestation indicated that the mass had increased, with the presence of polyhydramnios. The patient experienced reduced fetal movements at 31 weeks gestation. There was persistent fetal tachycardia at 33 weeks gestation, and consequently the neonate was delivered by emergency caesarean section. The placenta revealed a large chorioangioma. The neonate's birth weight was 2.85 kg and non-immune hydrops fetalis was diagnosed. The neonate improved significantly in the neonatal intensive care unit and is currently well with no medical problems.",Rivaroxaban-related acute kidney injury in a patient with IgA vasculitis.,https://www.ncbi.nlm.nih.gov/pubmed/30700467,BMJ case reports,2019 05 13,"Anticoagulants have recently been recognised as a cause of acute kidney injury (AKI). We describe the case of a 75-year-old man with IgA vasculitis and atrial fibrillation treated with rivaroxaban, who presented with macroscopic haematuria and an acute decline in renal function. Two months before referral, he noted palpable purpuric lesions and was diagnosed with IgA vasculitis based on skin biopsy findings; the skin lesion disappeared following treatment with a steroid external preparation. Renal biopsy revealed glomerular haemorrhage and red blood cell casts. Although rivaroxaban was withdrawn, his kidney function worsened and he was started on haemodialysis. His renal function did not recover. To the best of our knowledge, this is the first case of direct oral anticoagulant (DOAC)-related AKI in systemic vasculitis. During DOAC therapy, close monitoring of a patient's urinalysis results and their renal function may be required for patients with systemic vasculitis to avoid AKI.",Stroke or side effect? dofetilide associated facial paralysis after direct current cardioversion for atrial fibrillation.,https://www.ncbi.nlm.nih.gov/pubmed/30700466,BMJ case reports,2019 05 13,"Dofetilide is a class III antiarrhythmic drug that has proven efficacious in maintaining sinus rhythm in up to 60% of patients with persistent atrial fibrillation. Dofetilide's most concerning adverse effect is QT prolongation and polymorphic VT, but providers should be aware of other rare significant side effects. We report a case of dofetilide associated Bell's palsy masquerading as stroke that developed shortly after a cardioversion. The patient's facial weakness, a side effect of dofetilide, resolved relatively quickly after discontinuation of the medication and a short course of oral corticosteroids.",Tubulointerstitial nephritis and uveitis syndrome in a female adult.,https://www.ncbi.nlm.nih.gov/pubmed/30700465,BMJ case reports,2019 05 13,"Tubulointerstitial nephritis and uveitis (TINU) syndrome is a rare disease characterised by the association of acutetubulointerstitial nephritis and uveitis. It affects mainly children and young women. Drugs and infections may be precipitating factors. It is a diagnosis of exclusion. The mainstays of treatment are topical and systemic corticosteroids. Prognosis is usually favourable. We report a case of TINU which occurred in our unit. A 37-year-old woman presented with an influenza-like illness, bilateral ocular pain and blurred vision. Ophthalmological evaluation revealed bilateral anterior uveitis and later renal involvement was seen as acute tubulointerstitial nephritis. A diagnosis of TINU was assumed after exclusion of other systemic diseases. She was treated with topical corticosteroids for the uveitis and evolved favourably, with resolution of ocular symptoms and normalisation of serum creatinine and proteinuria. This case highlights the importance of a high degree of clinical suspicion to make the diagnosis of TINU syndrome.",Synovial sarcoma in an HIV-positive pregnant woman and review of literature.,https://www.ncbi.nlm.nih.gov/pubmed/30700464,BMJ case reports,2019 05 13,"We present a first case of synovial sarcoma in an HIV-positive pregnant woman. This 28-year-old woman was diagnosed with synovial sarcoma, a high-grade malignant soft tissue sarcoma, involving her left thigh during the first trimester of her pregnancy. She underwent surgical treatment in the form of hip disarticulation at 30 weeks' gestation. She was subsequently delivered by emergency caesarean section (CS) at 34 weeks' gestation when she presented with wound sepsis and a scan revealed static growth in a small for gestational age fetus. Prompt diagnosis and treatment of this aggressive tumour is important and should involve a multidisciplinary approach, with a balanced consideration of the maternal and fetal outcomes.",Laparoscopic repair of a Morgagni hernia with extra-abdominal transfascial sutures.,https://www.ncbi.nlm.nih.gov/pubmed/30700463,BMJ case reports,2019 05 13,"Morgagni hernia is a congenital diaphragmatic hernia. It is rare, usually asymptomatic, and most of the times incidentally discovered during adulthood. A 77-year-old female patient was incidentally diagnosed with Morgagni hernia. Meanwhile, because of abdominal pain she resorted to the emergency department. A CT scan was performed. A laparoscopic repair with extra-abdominal transfascial sutures was conducted. At 3-month follow-up, the patient is asymptomatic. Surgical repair of Morgagni hernia is always indicated because of the risk of strangulation of hernia contents. Minimal invasive surgery is the gold standard, and laparoscopy is the preferred approach. Morgagni hernia does not have an anterior rim, which makes it technically difficult to close the defect. Extra-abdominal transfascial technique was used to repair the defect, eliminating the need for intracorporeal sutures. For small defects, simple repair with non-absorbable sutures using extra-abdominal transfascial technique is easy and efficient.",Congenital adrenal hyperplasia with salt-wasting crisis and arrhythmia: a case study.,https://www.ncbi.nlm.nih.gov/pubmed/30700462,BMJ case reports,2019 05 13,"We report a case of a 10-day-old male infant who presented to the emergency department with severe electrolyte imbalance and life-threatening arrhythmia. The parents reported a 3-day history of poor feeding and lethargy. On examination, he was bradycardic (heart rate of 65 beats/min) with signs of dehydration. His ECG showed broad complex bradycardia. Blood gas showed metabolic acidosis with hyponatraemia and hyperkalaemia. A probable diagnosis of congenital adrenal hyperplasia (CAH) with salt-wasting crisis was made and treatment was commenced. He was given saline bolus, nebulised salbutamol, calcium gluconate and hydrocortisone. Following the above interventions, his heart rate rose to 150 beats/min with a regular sinus rhythm within a period of 40 min. The diagnosis of CAH secondary to 21-hydroxylase deficiency with mutation in CYP21A2 was confirmed by genetic studies. He was discharged home with hydrocortisone, fludrocortisone and sodium chloride.",Gross anterior segment ischaemia following vitreoretinal surgery for sickle-cell retinopathy.,https://www.ncbi.nlm.nih.gov/pubmed/30700461,BMJ case reports,2019 05 13,"We report the case of a 32-year-old Afrocaribbean man with known stage 3 proliferative sickle-cell retinopathy who presented with a mixed picture of tractional and rhegmatogenous macula off detachment. He underwent left primary 25 g vitrectomy with silicone oil, delamination and endolaser photocoagulation under a general anaesthetic. He, however, presented 48 hours postoperatively with gross anterior segment ischaemia. His pain and ocular signs settled over the course of a few days following administration of supplemental oxygen, oral steroids, analgesia and intravenous hydration. Examination showed resolution of his proptosis and orbital signs as well as anterior segment inflammation.

This consists of a primary oropharyngeal infection and septic thrombophlebitis, and one or more metastatic focus. Prior to the widespread use of antibiotics, Lemierre's syndrome commonly followed a rapidly progressing course, with a high mortality. We describe a case of a previously well 18-month-old boy who presented to the emergency department with a 3-week history of progressive, right-sided, painful neck swelling and systemic sepsis.

A total of 37,510 patients aged ≥20 years were assessed to identify subjects who had been diagnosed with colorectal cancer by colonoscopy without a previous diagnosis of colorectal cancer, inflammatory bowel disease (IBD), or gastrointestinal symptoms; 1,560 patients were identified who were diagnosed with colorectal cancer by colonoscopy. The patients with colorectal cancer were matched with 1,560 age, gender, family history of colorectal cancer and comorbidity-matched control patients who were not diagnosed with colorectal cancer at colonoscopy. The medication histories were compared between the two groups. Next, candidate drugs that were more frequently used by the control patients were selected and their effects on human colorectal cancer cell lines in vitro and an inflammation-induced mouse model of colorectal cancer were tested. Putative colorectal cancer preventative agents were identified, including aspirin, vitamin D, vitamin B, vitamin C, vitamin E, xanthine oxidase inhibitor, alpha-blockers, angiotensin receptor blocker, nateglinide, probiotics, thienopyridine, folic acid, nitrovasodilators, bisphosphonates, calcium channel blockers, steroids, and statins (P < 0.05). Alpha-blockers and xanthine oxidase inhibitors were selected for further study because these agents have not been analyzed previously as factors that may affect colorectal cancer outcomes. In vitro doxazosin (alpha-blocker), but not febuxostat (xanthine oxidase inhibitor), suppressed the proliferation of human colorectal cancer cells. Doxazosin also decreased tumorigenesis in an AOM/DSS mouse colorectal cancer model. Alpha-blockers may prevent colorectal cancer.","An Abstract Provides ""seAFOod"" for Thought.",https://www.ncbi.nlm.nih.gov/pubmed/30700438,"Cancer prevention research (Philadelphia, Pa.)",2019 03 05,"A recent article published in The Lancet reports on the seAFOod trial, in which patients with colorectal adenomas received aspirin and/or eicosapentaenoic acid (EPA, an omega-3 polyunsaturated fatty acid) post-resection. The article's abstract indicates that the primary trial endpoint, adenoma detection rate, is negative, but it does not give any indication of the remarkable secondary endpoint (adenoma number) results, which strongly suggest chemopreventive efficacy of both agents. Given the difficulty researchers and physician-scientists experience in staying abreast of the latest literature in the field, inclusion of secondary findings in abstracts should be strongly considered.",NDM Metallo-β-Lactamases and Their Bacterial Producers in Health Care Settings.,https://www.ncbi.nlm.nih.gov/pubmed/30700432,Clinical microbiology reviews,2019 04 14,"New Delhi metallo-β-lactamase (NDM) is a metallo-β-lactamase able to hydrolyze almost all β-lactams. Twenty-four NDM variants have been identified in >60 species of 11 bacterial families, and several variants have enhanced carbapenemase activity. Klebsiella pneumoniae and Escherichia coli are the predominant carriers of blaNDM, with certain sequence types (STs) (for K. pneumoniae, ST11, ST14, ST15, or ST147; for E. coli, ST167, ST410, or ST617) being the most prevalent. NDM-positive strains have been identified worldwide, with the highest prevalence in the Indian subcontinent, the Middle East, and the Balkans. Most blaNDM-carrying plasmids belong to limited replicon types (IncX3, IncFII, or IncC). Commonly used phenotypic tests cannot specifically identify NDM. Lateral flow immunoassays specifically detect NDM, and molecular approaches remain the reference methods for detecting blaNDM Polymyxins combined with other agents remain the mainstream options of antimicrobial treatment. Compounds able to inhibit NDM have been found, but none have been approved for clinical use. Outbreaks caused by NDM-positive strains have been reported worldwide, attributable to sources such as contaminated devices. Evidence-based guidelines on prevention and control of carbapenem-resistant Gram-negative bacteria are available, although none are specific for NDM-positive strains. NDM will remain a severe challenge in health care settings, and more studies on appropriate countermeasures are required.",Escherichia coli Pathobionts Associated with Inflammatory Bowel Disease.,https://www.ncbi.nlm.nih.gov/pubmed/30700431,Clinical microbiology reviews,2019 04 14,"Gut bacteria play a key role in initiating and maintaining the inflammatory process in the gut tissues of inflammatory bowel disease (IBD) patients, by supplying antigens or other stimulatory factors that trigger immune cell activation. Changes in the composition of the intestinal microbiota in IBD patients compared to that in healthy controls and a reduced diversity of intestinal microbial species are linked to the pathogenesis of IBD. Adherent invasive Escherichia coli (AIEC) has been linked to Crohn's disease (CD) patients, while diffusely adherent E. coli (DAEC) has been associated with ulcerative colitis (UC). Bacteriological analysis of intestinal biopsy specimens and fecal samples from IBD patients shows an increased number of E. coli strains belonging to the B2 phylogenetic group, which are typically known as extraintestinal pathogenic E. coli (ExPEC). Results from studies of both cell cultures and animal models reveal pathogenic features of these E. coli pathobionts, which may link them to IBD pathogenesis. This suggests that IBD-associated E. coli strains play a facilitative role during IBD flares. In this review, we explain IBD-associated E. coli and its role in IBD pathogenesis."

The most notable and rapid movement of a haptonema is 'coiling', which occurs within a few milliseconds following mechanical stimulation in an unknown motor-independent mechanism. Here, we analyzed the coiling process in detail by high-speed filming and showed that haptonema coiling was initiated by left-handed twisting of the haptonema, followed by writhing to form a helix from the distal tip. On recovery from a mechanical stimulus, the helix slowly uncoiled from the proximal region. Electron microscopy showed that the seven microtubules in a haptonema were arranged mostly in parallel but that one of the microtubules often wound around the others in the extended state. A microtubule stabilizer, paclitaxel, inhibited coiling and induced right-handed twisting of the haptonema in the absence of Ca2+, suggesting changes in the mechanical properties of microtubules. Addition of Ca2+ resulted in the conversion of haptonematal twist into the planar bends near the proximal region. These results indicate that switching microtubule conformation, possibly with the aid of Ca2+-binding microtubule-associated proteins is responsible for rapid haptonematal coiling.",Zebrafish duox mutations provide a model for human congenital hypothyroidism.,https://www.ncbi.nlm.nih.gov/pubmed/30700401,Biology open,2019 03 06,"Thyroid dyshormonogenesis is a leading cause of congenital hypothyroidism, a highly prevalent but treatable condition. Thyroid hormone (TH) synthesis is dependent on the formation of reactive oxygen species (ROS). In humans, the primary sources for ROS production during thyroid hormone synthesis are the NADPH oxidases DUOX1 and DUOX2. Indeed, mutations in DUOX1 and DUOX2 have been linked with congenital hypothyroidism. Unlike humans, zebrafish has a single orthologue for DUOX1 and DUOX2 In this study, we investigated the phenotypes associated with two nonsense mutant alleles, sa9892 and sa13017, of the single duox gene in zebrafish. Both alleles gave rise to readily observable phenotypes reminiscent of congenital hypothyroidism, from the larval stages through to adulthood. By using various methods to examine external and internal phenotypes, we discovered a strong correlation between TH synthesis and duox function, beginning from an early larval stage, when T4 levels are already noticeably absent in the mutants. Loss of T4 production resulted in growth retardation, pigmentation defects, ragged fins, thyroid hyperplasia/external goiter and infertility. Remarkably, all of these defects associated with chronic congenital hypothyroidism could be rescued with T4 treatment, even when initiated when the fish had already reached adulthood. Our work suggests that these zebrafish duox mutants may provide a powerful model to understand the aetiology of untreated and treated congenital hypothyroidism even in advanced stages of development.This article has an associated First Person interview with the first author of the paper.",Altered topological characteristics of morphological brain network relate to language impairment in high genetic risk subjects and schizophrenia patients.,https://www.ncbi.nlm.nih.gov/pubmed/30700398,Schizophrenia research,2019 05 31,"Evidence suggests relationships between abnormalities in various cortical and subcortical brain structures and language dysfunction in individuals with schizophrenia, and to some extent in those with increased genetic risk for this diagnosis.

The Agency for Clinical Innovation hosted a full-day SDM masterclass in May 2017 and 53 attendees completed a survey to identify barriers to implementing SDM. The Theoretical Domains Framework, COM-B ('capability', 'opportunity', motivation' and 'behaviour') Model and Behaviour Change Wheel were used to conduct a theoretical analysis of the barriers and identify potential interventions to increase the uptake of SDM. This was supplemented by a purposive review of articles about current international efforts to facilitate SDM. From the theoretical analysis, 9 of the 14 theoretical domains were considered relevant to implementing SDM in the NSW Health context. Multi-faceted interventions including education, training, enablement, modelling, incentivisation, persuasion and environmental restructuring were identified as potential ways to increase SDM. The review of international articles identified communication and marketing, patient and public involvement, research, training, legislation, patient decision aids, service provision, clinical champions, financial incentives and policy as interventions being used to increase the uptake of SDM internationally. Based on current perceptions about barriers for SDM implementation in NSW Health, initial efforts should focus on workforce skills development, motivation, communication and marketing, service provision and creating receptive work environments. Investments into facilitating SDM will require an ongoing commitment to enhancing patient experience, evidence translation and reducing unwarranted variations in care.What is known about the topic?Shared decision making is considered an important strategy for reducing unwarranted variation in health care and promoting person-centred care. Despite a growing evidence base, uptake in Australia has been slow.What does this paper add?A description of the theoretical methods and results used to identify potential implementation interventions to increase the uptake of shared decision making clinical practice in New South Wales Health, Australia.What are the implications for practitioners?Learnings from this present case study may be relevant to other organisations wanting to support a culture of shared decision making and meet the National Safety and Quality Healthcare Standards in Australia.",Clinical Diagnostic Value of Combined Detection of Serum C-Reactive Protein and Procalcitonin for Bacterial Infectious Diseases in Children.,https://www.ncbi.nlm.nih.gov/pubmed/30700365,Journal of the College of Physicians and Surgeons--Pakistan : JCPSP,2019 06 05,"The aim of this study was to investigate the clinical diagnostic value of combined detection of serum C-reactive protein (CRP) and procalcitonin (PCT) for bacterial infectious diseases in children. It was a case control study carried out from October 2016 to March 2018. A total of 150 children with bacterial infectious disease were assigned to the observation group, and 150 healthy children without infectious diseases were assigned to the control group. The research showed that CRP and PCT levels, positive rates of CRP and PCT detection in observation group were higher than those in control group (p<0.001); sensitivity and diagnostic coincidence rate, detection specificity of CRP combined with PCT were higher than those in single PCT or CRP (p<0.001, <0.001 and 0.013, respectively).

It was a descriptive, analytical study carried out at the Third People's Hospital of Shenzhen City, China, from March 2012 to March 2015. A total of 84 patients with thoracolumbar spinal tuberculosis were randomly divided into group A and group B, each group having 42 patients. Group A was treated with posterior approach surgery, while group B was treated with anterior approach surgery. The results showed that operation time, bleeding condition, length of stay of group A were lower than those of group B (p<0.001, p<0.001 and p=0.013, respectively). Compared with group B, the Cobb angle of group A after surgery was lower (p<0.001). At the 28th day after treatment, the serum bone alkaline phosphatase (BAP), bone gla protein (BGP), procollagen type I carboxy terminal peptide (CTX) levels of group A were lower than those of group B (p<0.001, p<0.001 and p=0.002, respectively).

Demographics, comorbidities, presenting symptoms, length of stay (LOS), mortality, and associated risk factors were recorded. There were 35 patients treated for urosepsis with a male preponderance of 21/35 patients. Hypertension (n=18) and diabetes (n=10) were the two most common comorbidities. There were five deaths (mortality rate=14.3%) and the main bacterium cultured was Escherichia coli. Age >65, presence of underlying comorbid disease, presence of cancer, urine and blood culture positivity had higher incidence of death but were not statistically significant for urosepsis mortality.

Fungal infections in the small intestine or colon are usually part of a disseminated disease process and reach these organs through the bloodstream. Two of the patients were infants 10 and 15 days of age, while one was 23 years old. Patients presented with abdominal pain, intestinal obstruction, and rectal bleeding. Hirchsprung disease was suspected in the two infants. In the adult patient, the diagnosis was unclear. Mucormycosis was diagnosed in two out of three cases. It is imperative for clinicians to consider invasive mycosis in the differential diagnosis in patients of all ages with treatment-resistant severe abdominal pain, diarrhea and fever.","Idiopathic Dilatation of the Colon in a Nursing Home Resident, with a Suspected Acute Colonic Pseudo-Obstruction (Ogilvie Syndrome).",https://www.ncbi.nlm.nih.gov/pubmed/30700361,Journal of the College of Physicians and Surgeons--Pakistan : JCPSP,2019 06 05,"Ogilvie syndrome (acute colonic pseudo-obstruction) represents a clinical condition with symptoms of colonic obstruction without a distinct mechanical factor. The damage to the neural ganglia in the intestinal wall is the most likely etiology. A 62-year man was admitted to the Emergency Department due to acute dyspnea and vomiting. The patient had not defecated for 10 days prior to admission. An angio-CT revealed dilated colon, especially its left part, up to 85 mm with gas inside its lumen. During laparotomy, extremely dilated colon was confirmed with signs of the intestinal wall necrosis. A left sided hemicolectomy was performed. Despite the intensive treatment in the intensive care unit (ICU), the patient died on 3rd day after the surgery. In this case, the acute pseudo-obstruction of the large intestine was recognised late. This is due to overcrowding in this type of institution, overworked staff, and their inability to give individual attention to each patient.",Perforation of Cecal Diverticulum after Appendectomy.,https://www.ncbi.nlm.nih.gov/pubmed/30700360,Journal of the College of Physicians and Surgeons--Pakistan : JCPSP,2019 06 05,"Solitary cecal diverticulum was first described by Potier in 1912. Although it is a rare condition, however, there is an increased prevalence in Asian populations. The cecal diverticula are usually asymptomatic, however, 10-20% of the cases become symptomatic due to complications. The most common diverticulum-related complication is diverticulitis. Other complications include perforation, hemorrhage, and rarely intestinal obstruction. To conclude, cecal diverticulum is a rare condition that usually presents itself with complications. It is mostly diagnosed perioperatively in the cases of acute appendicitis, and rarely preoperatively. Cecal diverticulitis is commonly misdiagnosed as acute appendicitis. This is why USG, CT, and MRI are commonly used in the preoperative diagnosis. There are very few cases that are confirmed to have both cecal diverticulitis and acute appendicitis. When the condition is majorly diagnosed perioperatively after an acute appendicitis diagnosis; it should be remembered that in the case of determining cecal diverticulitis during the appendectomy, the best course of action is to simultaneously apply diverticulectomy. In this case report, a 54-year male patient is presented, where a cecal diverticulum perforation developed in the early postoperative phase following the appendectomy. At the time of admission, the patient had the complaints of distension, extensive sensitivity, and rebound. The patient underwent laparotomy and the diverticulectomy was performed with a linear stapler. In this case, the presence of a combination of acute appendicitis and cecal diverticulitis was confirmed through histopathological examination.",Intestinal Spirocheteosis in a Patient with Celiac Disease.,https://www.ncbi.nlm.nih.gov/pubmed/30700359,Journal of the College of Physicians and Surgeons--Pakistan : JCPSP,2019 06 05,"A young girl presented to us with recurrent diarrhea along with a history of 5 kg weight loss in one year. On examination, she appeared pale, while her laboratory reports showed a low hemoglobin, mean corpuscular volume (MCV) and serum albumin. Her erythrocyte sedimentation rate (ESR) was slightly raised with her iron profile suggestive of iron deficiency anemia. Viral markers, human immunodeficiency virus (HIV) serology along with thyroid profile were all unremarkable. There was no history of tuberculosis, and purified protein derivative (PPD) skin test was also negative. Computed tomography (CT) abdomen showed thickening of the terminal ileum with multiple enlarged lymph nodes. An esophagogastroduodenoscopy (EGD) along with colonoscopy was done. Multiple biopsies were taken, which were suggestive of sprue along with intestinal spirochetosis. Her tissue transglutaminase (TTG) was negative while deamidated gliadin peptide (DGP) was positive. She was kept on gluten-free diet and started on tablet metronidazole.

Views of health sector managers in Cambodia, China and Pakistan.",https://www.ncbi.nlm.nih.gov/pubmed/30700342,"Health economics, policy, and law",2019 01 31,"This study qualitatively investigates what factors apart from or in addition to financial incentives can encourage better performance of frontline health care providers. We interviewed health sector managers in Pakistan, Cambodia and China, and they highlighted many potential limitations in the applicability of financial incentives in their contexts. There was a consistent view that providers are not always primarily driven by monetary rewards and that non-monetary rewards - such as recognition from direct supervisors and career development - could have a greater influence on performance. Managers also highlighted several challenges related to the design and implementation of performance management schemes: supervisors may not have performance information necessary to determine which agents to reward; when performance information is available, organisational culture may value other attributes such as social ties or years of experience; finally, concentration of power at higher levels of the health system can reduce supervisors' ability to manage performance, rewards and accountability. Although health sector managers were enthusiastic about measures to improve performance of providers, our study indicated that specific social, cultural and health system factors may mean that non-monetary rewards and structural changes to support a more transparent and meritocratic working environment should also be considered.",Examining the associations between children's receptive language skills and developmental domains in the United States and Turkey.,https://www.ncbi.nlm.nih.gov/pubmed/30700341,Journal of child language,2019 03 27,"This study examined the relations between receptive language development and other developmental domains of preschoolers from low-income families, through an inter-cultural perspective involving the United States and Turkey. A total of 471 children and their caregivers participated in Turkey, while 287 participated in the United States. Children's development was assessed using the Ages and Stages Questionnaire for both samples. Different versions of the Peabody Picture Vocabulary Test were used for Turkish and US samples, to measure receptive language development. Results revealed similar patterns, with some differences, between the two countries. Receptive language predicted only communication and personal-social scales in the Turkish sample, while the US children's receptive language skills were associated with communication, problem solving, personal-social, and fine and gross motor development scales. These results were discussed in the context of each country, and the comparative conclusions contribute to the extant literature by illustrating the importance of language for three domains.",Genetic parameter estimates for fecal egg counts and their relationship with growth in Avikalin and Malpura sheep.,https://www.ncbi.nlm.nih.gov/pubmed/30700340,Animal : an international journal of animal bioscience,2019 01 31,"Breeding for resistance against nematodes has become the need of the hour due to emergence of anthelmintic resistant strains of major pathogenic nematodes of economic importance and rising demand for chemical residue free food by consumers. ICAR-Central Sheep and Wool Research Institute Avikanagar (Rajasthan) has developed Haemonchus contortus resistant lines of sheep in Avikalin and Malpura breeds by harvesting benefits of over-dispersion in fecal egg counts (FEC) through executing a breeding program since year 2004. Aim of the present study was to assess the genetic parameters for nematode resistance in these lines and also to develop suitable criteria for selection targeting resistance as well as growth improvement in these two lines. The data on 1240 Avikalin and 2172 Malpura sheep generated over 13 years (2004-16) for FEC along with deep pedigree and growth records for live weight at 6 (6WT) and 12 month were used for study. Data were analyzed using Average Information Restricted Maximum Likelihood (AIREML) approach. Results revealed moderate heritability (h2) for pre-drench log transformed fecal egg count (LFEC) in Avikalin (0.21±0.06) and Malpura (0.18±0.04) sheep. The post-drench h2 for LFEC was low in Avikalin (0.04±0.03) and Malpura (0.11±0.03) sheep. Effective selection program can be carried out for further improving the resistance against H. contortus in both the breeds using pre-drench LFEC estimates. The genetic correlation between the pre-drench LFEC and growth traits was not in the desired direction. Existence of substantial genotype × environment (G×E) interaction was seen in Malpura sheep, where major shift in ranks of sheep based on pre-drench LFEC as that of post-drench LFEC was observed owing to genetic correlation of 0.65±0.15. The G×E was absent in Avikalin sheep. Unreliable genetic correlation between growth and LFEC does not warrant a multi trait selection index development and its utilization in breeding program. The independent selection for LFEC followed by corrected 6WT can precisely help in achieving the goal of improving growth in nematode resistant sheep.",Laterality of Damage Influences the Relationship Between Impairment and Arm Use After Stroke.,https://www.ncbi.nlm.nih.gov/pubmed/30700339,Journal of the International Neuropsychological Society : JINS,2019 05 24,To investigate whether the relationship between arm use and motor impairment post-stroke is influenced by the hemisphere of damage.,Evaluation of visual function in Royal College of Surgeon rats using a depth perception visual cliff test.,https://www.ncbi.nlm.nih.gov/pubmed/30700338,Visual neuroscience,2019 06 07,"Preserving of vision is the main goal in vision research. The presented research evaluates the preservation of visual function in Royal College of Surgeon (RCS) rats using a depth perception test. Rats were placed on a stage with one side containing an illusory steep drop (""cliff"") and another side with a minimal drop (""table""). Latency of stage dismounting and the percentage of rats that set their first foot on the ""cliff"" side were determined. Nondystrophic Long-Evans (LE) rats were tested as control. Electroretinogram and histology analysis were used to determine retinal function and structure. Four-week-old RCS rats presented a significantly shorter mean latency to dismount the stage compared with 6-week-old rats (mean ± standard error, 13.7 ± 1.68 vs. 20.85 ± 6.5 s, P = 0.018). Longer latencies were recorded as rats aged, reaching 45.72 s in 15-week-old rats (P &lt; 0.00001 compared with 4-week-old rats). All rats at the age of 4 weeks placed their first foot on the table side. By contrast, at the age of 8 weeks, 28.6% rats dismounted on the cliff side and at the age of 10 and 15 weeks, rats randomly dismounted the stage to either table or cliff side. LE rats dismounted the stage faster than 4-week-old RCS rats, but the difference was not statistically significant (7 ± 1.58 s, P = 0.057) and all LE rats dismounted on the table side. The latency to dismount the stage in RCS rats correlated with maximal electroretinogram b-wave under dark and light adaptation (Spearman's rho test = -0.603 and -0.534, respectively, all P &lt; 0.0001), outer nuclear layer thickness (Spearman's rho test = -0.764, P = 0.002), and number of S- and M-cones (Spearman's rho test = -0.763 [P = 0.002], and -0.733 [P = 0.004], respectively).

Although progress has been made, there is a clear need for interventions that support parents and children receiving health services in the public sector who are vulnerable to multiple psychosocial risks associated with extreme poverty. In this mixed-method study, we examined the feasibility and acceptability of adapting an evidence-based parenting intervention called Mothering from the Inside Out that was developed for mothers who are vulnerable to similar risks in the United States. Using qualitative methods, we documented the collaborative process that was guided by principles of community-based participatory research and examined themes in the Western Cape collaborators' perspectives about the feasibility and acceptability of the intervention. Using quantitative methods, we tested the preliminary efficacy of the adapted version of Mothering from the Inside Out for improving maternal reflective functioning and mother-child interactions. Although findings from both study components indicated preliminary promise, a number of obstacles and challenges at multiple levels underscore the need for (a) flexibility and contextual support for intervention research conducted in under-resourced communities, (b) clinical sensitivity to the unique experiences of parents rearing children in highly stressful, under-resourced environments, and (c) equal partnerships that allow the expertise of local providers to inform the design proposals of consulting investigators."

As a chronic work stress, workplace bullying places the victims' physical and mental health at risk which, in extreme cases, may lead to suicidal ideation. The high prevalence rate of workplace bullying has been reported and documented globally. However, a major limitation of the existing literature is that studies essentially focus on the consequences of workplace bullying on victims, including the psychological, physiological and socioeconomic impacts, and on the factors causing workplace bullying, but research on the impact of workplace bullying on the victims' families is lacking. It is however evident that the consequences of workplace bullying have a spillover effect on the victims' family members. Since many victims have children and given that children are particularly vulnerable to a negative family environment, examining the impacts of the type of parental stress induced by workplace bullying on children's health including physical and psychological health (depression and self-esteem), externalizing problem behaviors (aggression, lying, disrespect) and school adjustment (academic performance and school conduct) is urgently needed.

Revue therapeutique,2019 03 22,"Extraintestinal manifestations in chronic inflammatory bowel diseases Abstract. Chronic inflammatory bowel diseases (IBD) are inflammatory gastrointestinal disorders that are not limited to the gastrointestinal tract. Various organ systems may be involved, making IBD a systemic disease. The most common extraintestinal manifestations (EIMs) include musculoskeletal, ophthalmic, dermatological and hepato-biliary disorders. EIMs considerably contribute to the morbidity of patients with IBD and also limit their quality of life. Due to the diversity of the organ systems involved, care should be provided on an interdisciplinary basis by a medical staff trained in the treatment of IBD. Early detection of EIM allows targeted therapy and reduces the overall morbidity of the affected patients. Of importance is the fact that EIM can occur in up to 25 % of all IBD patients before the onset of the first Crohn's episode or ulcerative colitis. Therefore, dermatologists, ophthalmologists and rheumatologists should beware of this possible association in EIM and the simultaneous occurrence of intestinal symptoms.",[Insights into the Pathogenesis of Inflammatory Bowel Diseases: Genetics and Microbiota].,https://www.ncbi.nlm.nih.gov/pubmed/30700240,Therapeutische Umschau. Revue therapeutique,2019 03 22,"Insights into the Pathogenesis of Inflammatory Bowel Diseases: Genetics and Microbiota Abstract. An inadequate immune response against bacteria of the gastrointestinal tract is the basic mechanism mediating the pathophysiology of inflammatory bowel diseases (IBD). The risk of IBD is partially heritable and approximately 12 % of patients have a family history of IBD. Large genome-wide association studies (GWAS) were able to identify 240 genetic regions associated with IBD. Many of the implicated genes have a function in the immune system, are associated with primary immunodeficiencies or the defense against mycobacteria. Together these 240 genetic regions form an excellent framework for further investigations into the pathogenesis and therapy of IBD. However, GWAS so far were able to unravel only a fraction of the genetic IBD risk. New strategies like genome wide sequencing are currently used to identify additional (rare) genetic variants. In rare cases, IBD is also inherited as a monogenetic disease. Moreover, there likely is significant interaction between genes and environmental factors which can only be unraveled if both, genes and the environment are simultaneously considered. Interestingly, the information provided by genetic risk factors for IBD is unable to predict the clinical course of IBD. New GWAS therefore focus on IBD prognosis and first insights have already been made. The gastrointestinal tract harbors a huge number of microorganisms (microbiota). It remains an enormous challenge for the immune system to contain this bacterial load while enabling the host to benefit from the many essential contributions of the microbiota. In IBD, the microbiota is altered to a dysfunctional (dysbiotic) state showing reduced diversity and a higher amount of potential pathogenic Proteobacteriae, such as Escherichia coli. In IBD, the microbiota is also more dynamic in its composition over time compared to health. Further, IBD dysbiosis is more pronounced in Crohn's disease than in ulcerative colitis. In animal experiments, dysbiosis could be transferred by fecal microbiota transplantation from one mouse to another, triggering inflammation in the recipient. In contrast, a healthy microbiota can downregulate the immune response of the host, for instance by bacterial short chain fatty acids (SCFA) synthesis. In addition, some bacteria with close physical contact to the intestinal wall also have specific immunosuppressive properties. So far, the highly complex network of microbiota, genetics, immune system and environment is only partially understood. The microbiota is a potential therapeutic target which up to now can only be non-specifically influenced by antibiotics, probiotics, prebiotics or fecal microbiota transplantation. A better understanding of the microbiota will likely yield in the discovery of new therapeutic options in the future.",[Epidemiology and socio-economic aspects of chronic inflammatory bowel diseases in Switzerland].,https://www.ncbi.nlm.nih.gov/pubmed/30700239,Therapeutische Umschau. Revue therapeutique,2019 03 22,"Epidemiology and socio-economic aspects of chronic inflammatory bowel diseases in Switzerland Abstract. Inflammatory bowel diseases (IBD) are comprised of Crohn's disease and ulcerative colitis. Both diseases are diagnosed with increasing frequency over the last few decades in industrialized countries. Current, population-based data from Switzerland show a prevalence of 0.4 % for IBD in Switzerland (one affected person in 250 inhabitants) with equal shares for Crohn's disease and ulcerative colitis (one affected person in 500 inhabitants each). The mortality rate of Swiss IBD patients is comparable with the one of patients without IBD. Roughly 80 % of patients with IBD suffer from co-morbidities. The most frequent co-morbidities concern cardiovascular diseases, followed by rheumatologic conditions, acid-related disorders, pain, and psychologic disorders.

Revue therapeutique,2019 03 22,"The Role of the Exposome in the Emergence of Chronic Inflammatory Bowel Diseases Abstract. Inflammatory Bowel Disease (IBD) including Crohn's disease (CD) and ulcerative colitis (UC), are chronic inflammatory conditions of the gut related to a combination of genetic and environmental factors that impact on normal host-microbe interactions. The gastrointestinal tract is exposed to an overwhelming load of foreign antigens arising from commensal microorganisms, dietary products and occasional pathogens. But these factors explain only a small fraction of disease risk. During the last two decades advances in genomics, epigenomics and understanding of the intestinal microbiota have improved our knowledge in IBD pathogenesis. Although our ability to predict relapses and response to treatment remains limited, the importance of the external environment to modify the risk of IBD and to precipitate relapses in patients with established disease rises. The term 'exposome' is proposed to reflect a life-course of environmental influences beginning in-utero and proceeding right through childhood to adulthood. While the exposome is still a concept which needs practical perspective to enable better patient care, this review highlights important components of environmental contributors to improve our understanding on pathophysiologic mechanisms in IBD.",Photochemical Tissue Bonding Technique for Improving Healing of Hand Tendon Injury.,https://www.ncbi.nlm.nih.gov/pubmed/30700237,Surgical innovation,2019 03 18,We utilized a novel approach of combined photochemical tissue bonding (PTB) and human amniotic membrane (HAM) to improve hand tendon repair and also evaluated its efficacy.,Thymomas and Associated Hyperplastic Lesions in Wistar Hannover Rats.,https://www.ncbi.nlm.nih.gov/pubmed/30700236,Toxicologic pathology,2019 04 05,"Thymomas occur prevalently in aged Wistar Hannover (WH) rats, along with hyperplastic lesions that cannot be categorized as thymomas. We compared the histological features of hyperplastic lesions and thymomas in WH rats, the incidences of these lesions, and the relationship of these lesions to the degree of thymic involution and also compared these lesions with those of Sprague Dawley (SD) rats in 4-, 13-, 26-, and 104-week studies. There were no morphological differences between hyperplastic cells and benign tumor cells in thymomas. The histological difference between hyperplastic lesions and thymomas was the size of the proliferative areas and the number of medullary differentiation areas. The hyperplastic lesions of the thymus in WH rats might have a potential for progression to thymomas due to the observed multiple hyperplastic lesions or mixed lesions with thymomas. The incidence of these proliferative lesions in the thymus was higher in females than in males. Further, the incidence of these proliferative lesions was higher in WH rats than in SD rats. Thymic involution was more severe in males than in females and more severe in SD rats than in WH rats.

Subsequent repolarisation is a metabolic process requiring glucose. Instances of CSD and glucose derangement are both linked to poor neurological outcome, but their causal inter-relationship is not fully defined. This systematic review seeks to evaluate the available human evidence studying CSD and glucose to further understand their dynamic relationship. We conducted a systematic review of studies examining CSD through electrocorticography and cerebral/systemic glucose concentrations in ABI, excluding animal studies. The search yielded 478 articles, of which 13 were eligible. Across 10 manuscripts, 125 patients received simultaneous monitoring, with 1987 CSD episodes observed. Eight of 10 studies observed correlation between CSD and glucose change. Seven of eight studies observed possible cumulative effect of recurrent CSD on glucose derangement and two identified correlation between glycopenia and incidence of CSD. These findings confirm a relationship between CSD and glucose, and suggest it may be cyclical, where CSD causes local glycopenia, which may potentiate further CSD. Positive observations were not common to all studies, likely due to differing methodology or heterogeneity in CSD propensity. Further study is required to delineate the utility of the clinical modulation of serum and cerebral glucose to alter the propensity for CSD following brain injury.",Biomechanical comparison of screw-based zones of a spatial subchondral support plate for proximal humerus fractures.,https://www.ncbi.nlm.nih.gov/pubmed/30700217,"Proceedings of the Institution of Mechanical Engineers. Part H, Journal of engineering in medicine",2019 04 08,"Stabilisation of proximal humerus fractures remains a surgical challenge. Spatial subchondral support (S3) plate promises to overcome common complications associated with conventional proximal humerus plates. This study compared the biomechanical performance of S3 plate with a fixed-angle hybrid blade (Equinoxe Fx) plate and a conventional fixed-angle locking plate (PHILOS). The effects of removal of different S3 plate screws on the humeral stability were also investigated. A total of 20 synthetic left humeri were osteotomised transversely at the surgical neck to simulate a two-part fracture and were each treated with an S3 plate. Head screws were divided into three zones based on their distance from the fracture site. Specimens were divided into four equal groups where one group acted as a control with all screws and three groups had one of the screw zones missing. With humeral head fixed, humeral shaft was first displaced 5 mm in extension, flexion, valgus and varus direction (elastic testing) and then until 30 mm varus displacement (plastic testing). Load-displacement data were recorded to determine construct stiffness in elastic tests and assess specimens' varus stability under plastic testing. Removal of the screw nearest to the fracture site led to a 20.71% drop in mean elastic varus bending stiffness. Removal of the two inferomedial screw above it resulted in a larger drop. The proximal screw pair had the largest contribution to extension and flexion bending stiffness. Varus stiffness of S3 plate constructs was higher than PHILOS and Fx plate constructs. Stability of humeri treated with S3 plate depends on screws' number, orientation and location. Varus stiffness of S3 plate construct (10.54 N/mm) was higher than that of PHILOS (6.61 N/mm) and Fx (7.59 N/mm) plate constructs. We attribute this to S3 plates' thicker cross section, the 135° inclination of its screws with respect to the humeral shaft and the availability of pegs for subchondral support.",Functional genetic evaluation of DNA house-cleaning enzymes in the malaria parasite: dUTPase and Ap4AH are essential in Plasmodium berghei but ITPase and NDH are dispensable.,https://www.ncbi.nlm.nih.gov/pubmed/30700216,Expert opinion on therapeutic targets,2019 02 21,"Cellular metabolism generates reactive oxygen species.

Thirty-one participants read neutral, emotionally negative texts and emotionally positive texts on a digital tablet and both participants' eye movements and body movements were recorded using respectively eye-tracking glasses and a motion capture system. The results showed that emotionally positive texts were read faster than neutral texts, and that readers' movements decreased when reading emotional texts regardless of valence polarity. Recent studies suggested that postural movements may reflect cognitive engagement and especially the engagement in the task to be done. Our findings seem to validate this hypothesis of a bodily engagement in reading emotional contents.

HRECs were cultured in high-glucose medium to mimic diabetic retinopathy (DR) model. We overexpressed or knocked down FENDRR in HRECs to evaluate the effect of FENDRR expression on cell proliferation, migration, and capillary morphogenesis of HRECs under either normal glucose or high glucose condition. Results showed that VEGF and FENDRR expression were increased in blood from DR patients compared with the control subjects. Furthermore, high glucose treatment upregulated expression of VEGF and FENDRR secreted from HRECs, in a dose- and time-dependent manner. Importantly, FENDRR overexpression significantly promoted the high-glucose-induced proliferation, migration, capillary morphogenesis, and VEGF expression in HRECs. In contrast, FENDRR knockdown exerted the opposite effects.

Over the past decades, the conventional Systematic Evolution of Ligands by Exponential Enrichment (SELEX) method has undergone dramatic modifications and improvements owing to developments in material sciences and analytical techniques. However, many of the recently developed strategies either require complex materials and instruments or suffer from low efficiency and high failure rates in the selection of desired aptamers. Accordingly, the development of aptamers against new or novel targets is still a major obstacle for aptamer-based research and application. Here, an improved protein-SELEX procedure is presented for simplified and highly efficient isolation of aptamers against protein targets. Approaches are described that ensure a high success rate in aptamer selection by simplifying polymerase chain reaction procedures, introducing denature gel, utilizing an electro-elution-based single-stranded DNA separation strategy, as well as an enzyme-linked immunosorbent assay-based highly sensitive binding assay. In addition, a simplified sample preparation method for MiSeq-based next-generation sequencing is also introduced. While a recombinant protein as a bait protein for SELEX is discussed here, this protocol will also be invaluable for researchers wishing to develop aptamers against targets other than proteins such as small molecules, lipids, carbohydrates, cells, and micro-organisms for future gene therapy and/or diagnostics.","Relationships between Media Exposure and Knowledge, Attitude, and Practice on HIV/AIDS: A Cross Sectional Survey of Adolescent Islamiyya Girls in Nigeria.",https://www.ncbi.nlm.nih.gov/pubmed/30700145,Health communication,2019 01 31,"Exposure to HIV/AIDS media among adolescents in sub-Saharan Africa was reported as low in the early 2000s, but now given developments in technology and program appeal, there emerges a need for reassessment. Given that communication, particularly through the media plays a major role in stemming the spread of the epidemic, this study examines the HIV/AIDS media exposure, knowledge, attitude, and practice (KAP) of adolescent Islamiyya girls in northern Nigeria as a predominantly Muslim society. The objectives of the study were to (1) identify the girls' major sources of information on HIV/AIDS; (2) assess their exposure to HIV/AIDS media and their HIV/AIDS knowledge, attitude and practice; and (3) verify relationships between media exposure and HIV/AIDS KAP. Based on the Advertising Research Foundation's Hierarchy of Effects model, hypotheses were posed to test the relationships. A questionnaire survey was administered on a randomly selected sample of 500 Islamiyya girls in Bauchi, Nigeria, from an estimated population of 35,000. Results were analyzed using descriptive statistics and partial least squares structural equation modeling. The results showed media exposure is not a significant predictor of HIV/AIDS practice, but it is a significant predictor of HIV/AIDS knowledge. And HIV/AIDS knowledge significantly predicted both HIV/AIDS attitude and practice. HIV/AIDS attitude also significantly predicted HIV/AIDS practice. It is thus concluded that among Nigerian adolescent girls, exposure to HIV/AIDS media is a necessary but not a sufficient predictor of HIV/AIDS KAP.","Use, Temporal Trends, and Outcomes of Endovascular Therapy After Interhospital Transfer in the United States.",https://www.ncbi.nlm.nih.gov/pubmed/30700144,Circulation,2019 03 25,The use of endovascular therapy (EVT) in patients with acute ischemic stroke who have large vessel occlusion has rapidly increased in the United States following pivotal trials demonstrating its benefit.

This qualitative study examines the practices of male sex workers and vulnerabilities to HIV infection based on interviews among 15 MSWs in Bulawayo. All the interviews were recorded, transcribed, and analyzed with the guidance of grounded theory. The transcripts were translated by the interviewer into English using NVivo 11.0 software for coding and analysis. The MSWs interviewed reported diverse backgrounds in sexual orientation and life situations, plus a variety of work settings, income levels and access to clients. Due to the illegal nature of sex work and the stigma of homosexuality, practices in the sex trade are often hidden and subtle to avoid exposure to the police. Some develop romantic relationships with regular clients, but more typically they suffer abuse, violence, and the threat of sexually transmitted diseases, including HIV. Most Zimbabwean MSWs are ill-informed and underestimate their vulnerability of HIV. The stigmatization and criminalization of homosexuality in Zimbabwe creates an environment where it is difficult for MSWs to protect themselves through consistent condom use and access to basic HIV prevention and care services.",Mediterranean Diet and the Association Between Air Pollution and Cardiovascular Disease Mortality Risk.,https://www.ncbi.nlm.nih.gov/pubmed/30700142,Circulation,2019 04 10,"Recent experimental evidence suggests that nutritional supplementation can blunt adverse cardiopulmonary effects induced by acute air pollution exposure.

Approach and Results- In the Beijing AIRCHD study (Air Pollution and Cardiovascular Dysfunction in Healthy Adults), 73 healthy adults (23.3±5.4 years) were followed-up with 4 repeated study visits in 2014 to 2016. During each visit, ambient air pollution concentrations, HDL function metrics, and parameters of inflammation and oxidative stress were measured. Average daily concentrations of ambient particulate matter in diameter <2.5 μm were 62.9 µg/m3 (8.1-331.0 µg/m3). We observed significant decreases in HDL cholesterol efflux capacity of 2.3% (95% CI, -4.3 to -0.3) to 5.0% (95% CI, -7.6 to -2.4) associated with interquartile range increases in moving average concentrations of particulate matter in diameter <2.5 μm and traffic-related air pollutants (black carbon, nitrogen dioxide, and carbon monoxide) during the 1 to 7 days before each participant's clinic visit. Higher ambient air pollutant levels were also associated with significant reductions in circulating HDL cholesterol and apoA-I (apolipoprotein A-I), as well as elevations in HDL oxidation index, oxidized LDL (low-density lipoprotein), malondialdehyde, and high-sensitivity C-reactive protein. Conclusions- Higher ambient air pollution concentrations were associated with impairments in HDL functionality, potentially because of systemic inflammation and oxidative stress. These novel findings further our understanding of the mechanisms whereby air pollutants promote cardiometabolic disorders."

In the present study, we evaluated the effect of microRNA-21 (miR-21) on the gastric cancer cell proliferation, migration, apoptosis and the related signaling cascades. Here, we showed that down-regulation of miR-21 markedly reduced gastric cancer cell proliferation (AGS and NCI-N87 cells) in a time dependent manner. Moreover, our findings revealed that silencing miR-21 dramatically blocked gastric cancer cell migration and movement, which might be related to down-regulation of vimentin expression. We also found that down-regulation of miR-21 promoted cell apoptosis and repressed cell cycle progression. Further investigation showed that down-regulation of miR-21 significantly increased phosphatase and tensin homolog (PTEN) protein expression level, but not transcription level (mRNA level), which in turn decreased Akt phosphorylation at Thr308 and Ser473. Collectively, our results uncover that miR-21 targets PTEN/Akt signaling pathway and regulates cell proliferation, migration and apoptosis in human gastric cancer cells. Our findings may provide a therapeutic target for treatment of human gastric cancer."

Measurements of the refractive index of aqueous solutions of acetic acid in the wide range of acetic acid concentrations (∼ 0 ÷ 1 mole fraction) in a solution at a room temperature were conducted. Maximum value of refractive index was detected at a concentration of ∼0.3 mole fraction. The deviation from the parabolic form of the dependence of the refractive index on the concentration occurs at a concentration of ∼0.8 mole fraction. As far as we know, this deviation has been observed for the first time. The maximum is attributed to the largest number of molecular interactions between water and acetic acid molecules, while the deviation is associated with the parallel orientation of acetic acid molecules. To identify the reconstructing of molecules in the system, FT-IR and Raman spectra of these solutions at a concentration of ∼0.3 and ∼0.8 mole fraction were recorded and compared with pure solutions.

Although the possibility of efficient multifunctional shock dissipation by MOFs was suggested by static high pressure studies, there is little known about MOFs under shock compression. Here, we measure the attenuation of shock wave by the MOF denoted zeolitic-imidazolate framework (ZIF-8) in its desolvated, porous state. We find that shock wave dissipation by ZIF-8 occurred by multiple processes: powder compaction, nanopore-collapse, and chemical bond-breakage. The shock energy absorbance in ZIF-8 is proportional to ZIF-8 thickness, allowing the prediction of the thickness of MOF layer needed to attenuate shock waves to a desired lower energy. Compared with PMMA, often used as a standard, ZIF-8 attenuates 7 times more shock energy per unit mass for impacts at a lower velocity of 0.75 km/s and 2.5 times more at a higher velocity of 1.6 km/s. This research illustrates how to improve the ability to attenuate shock waves for personnel and equipment protection by engineering multifunctionality into the shock wave absorbing armor material.",Pathway Bifurcation in the (4 + 3)/(5 + 2)-Cycloaddition of Butadiene and Oxidopyrylium Ylides: The Significance of Molecular Orbital Isosymmetry.,https://www.ncbi.nlm.nih.gov/pubmed/30700089,The Journal of organic chemistry,2019 05 17,"By drawing analogies from the dimerization of cyclopentadiene, a novel reaction pathway bifurcation is uncovered in the cycloaddition of oxidopyrylium ylides and butadiene. Analysis of the potential energy surface (at the M06-2X/6-311+G(d,p) level of theory) in combination with Born-Oppenheimer molecular dynamics simulations (M06-2X/6-31+G(d)) demonstrate that both the (4 + 3)- and (5 + 2)-cycloaddition products are accessed from the same transition state. Key indicators of a pathway bifurcation (asynchronous bond formation, and a second transition state for the interconversion of the products) are also observed. The absence of a post-transition state bifurcation in the related oxidopyridinium systems of Krenske and Harmata is rationalized. Finally, the isosymmetry of the oxidopyrylium and cyclopentadiene molecular orbitals as well as the presence of ""secondary orbital interactions"" are emphasized as the common source of nonstatistical behavior. Application of these principles will allow for the rapid identification of new reaction pathway bifurcations."

The objective of this study was to complete comprehensive health evaluations on e-waste recycling workers in Chile and to compare those that work in informal (i.e., independent) to those that work in formal (i.e., established company) settings. A cross-sectional study in the summer of 2017 recruited 78 informal recycling workers from two cities and 15 formal e-waste recycling workers from a single recycling facility to assess exposures and health outcomes. Participants completed a health questionnaire and underwent a full health assessment. Herein, only health questionnaire data are reported. Participants were primarily male, middle-aged, married with children, and had worked in e-waste recycling for an average of 12 years. Participants generally reported good health status, and their prevalence of chronic diseases was comparable to national rates. Workers frequently reported exposures to several occupational stressors, including noise and insufficient income, as well as other mental health stressors. Occupational injuries were commonly reported and use of safety equipment was low. Only a few significant differences, generally of a rather small magnitude, were found between informal and formal workers. In conclusion, from survey data, we did not identify major risks to health among e-waste workers, and only minor differences between workers in informal and formal settings.",Treatment of Anorexia Nervosa-New Evidence-Based Guidelines.,https://www.ncbi.nlm.nih.gov/pubmed/30700054,Journal of clinical medicine,2019 03 29,"Anorexia nervosa is the most severe eating disorder; it has a protracted course of illness and the highest mortality rate among all psychiatric illnesses. It is characterised by a restriction of energy intake followed by substantial weight loss, which can culminate in cachexia and related medical consequences. Anorexia nervosa is associated with high personal and economic costs for sufferers, their relatives and society. Evidence-based practice guidelines aim to support all groups involved in the care of patients with anorexia nervosa by providing them with scientifically sound recommendations regarding diagnosis and treatment. The German S3-guideline for eating disorders has been recently revised. In this paper, the new guideline is presented and changes, in comparison with the original guideline published in 2011, are discussed. Further, the German guideline is compared to current international evidence-based guidelines for eating disorders. Many of the treatment recommendations made in the revised German guideline are consistent with existing international treatment guidelines. Although the available evidence has significantly improved in quality and amount since the original German guideline publication in 2011, further research investigating eating disorders in general, and specifically anorexia nervosa, is still needed.",A Common Assessment Space for Different Sensor Structures.,https://www.ncbi.nlm.nih.gov/pubmed/30700053,"Sensors (Basel, Switzerland)",2019 02 27,"The study of the evolution process of our visual system indicates the existence of variational spatial arrangement; from densely hexagonal in the fovea to a sparse circular structure in the peripheral retina. Today's sensor spatial arrangement is inspired by our visual system. However, we have not come further than rigid rectangular and, on a minor scale, hexagonal sensor arrangements. Even in this situation, there is a need for directly assessing differences between the rectangular and hexagonal sensor arrangements, i.e., without the conversion of one arrangement to another. In this paper, we propose a method to create a common space for addressing any spatial arrangements and assessing the differences among them, e.g., between the rectangular and hexagonal. Such a space is created by implementing a continuous extension of discrete Weyl Group orbit function transform which extends a discrete arrangement to a continuous one. The implementation of the space is demonstrated by comparing two types of generated hexagonal images from each rectangular image with two different methods of the half-pixel shifting method and virtual hexagonal method. In the experiment, a group of ten texture images were generated with variational curviness content using ten different Perlin noise patterns, adding to an initial 2D Gaussian distribution pattern image. Then, the common space was obtained from each of the discrete images to assess the differences between the original rectangular image and its corresponding hexagonal image. The results show that the space facilitates a usage friendly tool to address an arrangement and assess the changes between different spatial arrangements by which, in the experiment, the hexagonal images show richer intensity variation, nonlinear behavior, and larger dynamic range in comparison to the rectangular images.",Porosity and Pore Size Distribution of Native and Delignified Beech Wood Determined by Mercury Intrusion Porosimetry.,https://www.ncbi.nlm.nih.gov/pubmed/30700052,"Materials (Basel, Switzerland)",2019 02 24,"The complex hierarchical structures of biological materials in combination with outstanding property profiles are great sources of inspiration for material scientists. Based on these characteristic features, the structure of wood has been increasingly exploited to fabricate novel hierarchical and functional materials. With delignification treatments, the density and chemistry of wood can be altered, resulting in hierarchical cellulose scaffolds with enhanced porosity for the fabrication of novel hybrid materials. In the present study, focusing on acidic delignification of beech wood and its influence on porosity, we report on a structural characterization and qualitative assessment of the cellulose scaffolds using mercury intrusion porosimetry (MIP). To account for the effect of water removal from the hygroscopic structure, different drying methods-e.g., standard oven and freeze-drying-were applied. While native beech wood is characterized by the presence of macro, meso and micro pores, delignification altered the porosity, increasing the importance of the macropores in the pore size distribution. Furthermore, we showed that the final porosity obtained in the material is strongly dependent on the applied drying process. Samples delignified under harsh conditions at high temperature (mass loss of ~35%) show a 13% higher porosity after freeze-drying compared to oven-dried samples. The obtained results contribute to a better understanding of the impact of the delignification and drying processes on the porosity of cellulose scaffolds, which is of high relevance for subsequent modification and functionalization treatments.",A Two-Dimensional Adaptive Target Detection Algorithm in the Compressive Domain.,https://www.ncbi.nlm.nih.gov/pubmed/30700051,"Sensors (Basel, Switzerland)",2019 02 27,"By applying compressive sensing to infrared imaging systems, the sampling and transmitting time can be remarkably reduced. Therefore, in order to meet the real-time requirements of infrared small target detection tasks in the remote sensing field, many approaches based on compressive sensing have been proposed. However, these approaches need to reconstruct the image from the compressive domain before detecting targets, which is inefficient due to the complex recovery algorithms. To overcome this drawback, in this paper, we propose a two-dimensional adaptive threshold algorithm based on compressive sensing for infrared small target detection. Instead of processing the reconstructed image, our algorithm focuses on directly detecting the target in the compressive domain, which reduces both the time and memory requirements for image recovery. First, we directly subtract the spatial background image in the compressive domain of the original image sampled by the two-dimensional measurement model. Then, we use the properties of the Gram matrix to decode the subtracted image for further processing. Finally, we detect the targets by employing the advanced adaptive threshold method to the decoded image. Experiments show that our algorithm can achieve an average 100% detection rate, with a false alarm rate lower than 0.4%, and the computational time is within 0.3 s, on average.",Polar Metallocenes.,https://www.ncbi.nlm.nih.gov/pubmed/30700050,"Molecules (Basel, Switzerland)",2019 06 13,"Crystalline polar metallocenes are potentially useful active materials as piezoelectrics, ferroelectrics, and multiferroics. Within density functional theory (DFT), we computed structural properties, energy differences for various phases, molecular configurations, and magnetic states, computed polarizations for different polar crystal structures, and computed dipole moments for the constituent molecules with a Wannier function analysis. Of the systems studied, Mn₂(C₉H₉N)₂ is the most promising as a multiferroic material, since the ground state is both polar and ferromagnetic. We found that the predicted crystalline polarizations are 30⁻40% higher than the values that would be obtained from the dipole moments of the isolated constituent molecules, due to the local effects of the self-consistent internal electric field, indicating high polarizabilities.",Enthalpy-Sensing Microsystem Effective in Continuous Flow.,https://www.ncbi.nlm.nih.gov/pubmed/30700049,"Sensors (Basel, Switzerland)",2019 02 27,"A new microsystem designed to detect and measure in real time the enthalpy of mixing of two fluid constituents is presented.

Achieving long-term immunity against S. pneumoniae through immunization is an important public health priority. Long-term protection after immunization is thought to rely both on protective serum antibody levels and immunological memory in the form of antigen-specific memory B cells (MBCs). Although the ability to achieve protective antibody levels shortly after pneumococcal vaccination has been well documented for the various infant immunization schedules currently in use worldwide, the examination of immunological memory in the form of antigen-specific MBCs has been much more limited. Such responses are critical for long-term protection against pneumococcal colonization and disease. This review summarizes the published literature on the MBC response to primary or booster immunization with either pneumococcal polysaccharide vaccine (PPV23) or pneumococcal conjugate vaccines (PCVs), aiming to elucidate the immunological mechanisms that determine the magnitude and longevity of vaccine protection against pneumococcus. There is evidence that PCVs induce the production of antigen-specific MBCs, whereas immunization with PPV23 does not result in the formation of MBCs. Increased understanding of the immunological factors that facilitate the induction, maintenance and recall of MBCs in response to pneumococcal vaccination could enable the use of MBC enumeration as novel correlates of protection against S. pneumoniae. Ongoing studies that examine MBC response to pneumococcal vaccination in high burden settings will be extremely important in our understanding of long-term protection induced by pneumococcal conjugate vaccines.",A Group Decision Making Approach Considering Self-confidence Behaviors and Its Application in Environmental Pollution Emergency Management.,https://www.ncbi.nlm.nih.gov/pubmed/30700047,International journal of environmental research and public health,2019 06 13,"Self-confidence as one of the human psychological behaviors has important influence on emergency management decision making, which has been ignored in existing methods. To fill this gap, we dedicate to design a group decision making approach considering self-confidence behaviors and apply it to the environmental pollution emergency management. In the proposed method, the self-confident fuzzy preference relations are utilized to express experts' evaluations. This new type of preference relations allow experts to express multiple self-confidence levels when providing their evaluations, which can deal with the self-confidence of them well. To apply the proposed group decision making method to environmental pollution emergency management, a novel determination of the decision weights of experts is given combining the subjective and objective weights. The subjective weight can be directly assigned by organizer, while the objective weight is determined by the self-confidence degree of experts on their evaluations. Afterwards, by utilizing the weighted averaging operator, the individuals' evaluations can be aggregated into a collective one. To do that, some operational laws for self-confident fuzzy preference relations are introduced. And then, a self-confidence score function is designed to get the best solution for environmental pollution emergency management. Finally, some analyses and discussions show that the proposed method is feasible and effective.",Cell Cycle Arrest and Cytotoxic Effects of SAHA and RG7388 Mediated through p21WAF1/CIP1 and p27KIP1 in Cancer Cells.,https://www.ncbi.nlm.nih.gov/pubmed/30700046,"Medicina (Kaunas, Lithuania)",2019 03 29,"Alterations in gene expressions are often due to epigenetic modifications that can have a significant influence on cancer development, growth, and progression.

The small molecule RG7388 (idasanutlin, R05503781) is a newly developed inhibitor that is specific for an oncogene-derived protein called MDM2, which is also in clinical trials for the treatment of various types of cancers. These two drugs have shown the ability to induce p21 expression through distinct mechanisms in MCF-7 and LNCaP cells, which are reported to have wild-type TP53.

Here we demonstrate that translation of both endogenous and reporter ACTB mRNA is inhibited in the presence of mTOR kinase inhibitor (Torin1) and under amino acid starvation. Notably, 5'UTR and promoter of ACTB are sufficient for the mTOR-dependent translational response, and the degree of mTOR-sensitivity of ACTB mRNA translation is cell type-dependent.",Antiradical and Antioxidative Activity of Azocalix[4]arene Derivatives: Combined Experimental and Theoretical Study.,https://www.ncbi.nlm.nih.gov/pubmed/30700034,"Molecules (Basel, Switzerland)",2019 06 13,"Developing antioxidants with high efficiency is fundamentally important for the protection of living cells and engineering materials against oxidative damage.

Combined with theoretical studies, the antiradical and antioxidative mechanisms have been explored. The results demonstrated that these two azocalix[4]arene derivatives both exhibited remarkable antiradical and antioxidative activity.

Ammonium heptamolybdate, its mixture with hexamethylenetetramine, and their complex were used as the precursors at different temperatures. It was investigated that the synthesis of the target molybdenum nitrides strongly depended on the structure of the precursor and temperature conditions, while the synthesis of carbide samples always led to the target phase composition. Unlike the carbide samples, where the α-Mo₂C phase was predominant, the mixture of β-Mo₂N, MoO₂ with a small amount of metal molybdenum was generally formed during the nitridation.

There are several approaches to HLS extraction. However, most of these approaches are based on processing two or more images captured from different camera views or on processing 3D data in the form of point clouds extracted from the camera images. In contrast and motivated by the extensive work developed for the problem of depth estimation in a single image, where parallax constraints are not required, in this work, we propose a novel methodology towards HLS extraction from a single image with promising results. For that, our method has four steps. First, we use a CNN to predict the depth for a single image. Second, we propose a region-wise analysis to refine depth estimates. Third, we introduce a graph analysis to segment the depth in semantic orientations aiming at identifying potential HLS. Finally, the depth sections are provided to a new CNN architecture that predicts HLS in the shape of cubes and rectangular parallelepipeds.",Incineration Kinetic Analysis of Upstream Oily Sludge and Sectionalized Modeling in Differential/Integral Method.,https://www.ncbi.nlm.nih.gov/pubmed/30700030,International journal of environmental research and public health,2019 06 13,"As the most significant solid residue generated in the oil production industry, upstream oily sludge was regarded as hazardous waste in China due to its toxicity and ignitability, and to date, the incineration process has been considered the most efficient method in practice. Due to the complicated components of oily sludge, a kinetic model of the incineration process was difficult to build, and is still absent in engineering use. In this study, multiple non-isothermal thermogravimetric analysis (TGA) and differential scanning calorimetry (DSC) analysis were applied for the kinetic analysis of upstream oily sludge in air conditions. A viewpoint regarding the rules to sectionalize the reaction stages was raised, and a differential integral method to obtain the incineration kinetic model was provided. The results showed that four stages that were divided based on the weight-loss regions in the TGA curves and the endothermic/exothermic sections in the DSC curves were suitable to obtain an incineration kinetic model of oily sludge. The integral method was beneficial for obtaining the average activation energy of each stage, and the differential method was suitable for gaining the nth-order reaction rate equation and the pre-exponential factor before the operating temperature became lower than 635.968 °C.

To make well-informed decisions, it is essential to have a proper data integration strategy, which must allow working with heterogeneous data sources and platforms in interoperable ways. In this paper, we present a new lightweight web service called InterSensor Service allowing to simply connect to multiple IoT platforms, simulation specific data, databases, and simple files and retrieving their observations without worrying about data storage and the multitude of different APIs. The service encodes these observations ""on-the-fly"" according to the standardized external interfaces such as the OGC Sensor Observation Service and OGC SensorThings API. In this way, the heterogeneous observations can be analyzed and visualized in a unified way. The service can be deployed not only by the users to connect to different sources but also by providers and stakeholders to simply add further interfaces to their platforms realizing interoperability according to international standards. We have developed a Java-based implementation of the InterSensor Service, which is being offered free as open source software.

Through the process of printing the effectiveness of these properties decreases. Thorough optimization is required to determine the idealized ink functional and flow properties to ensure maximum printability and functionalities offered by carbon nanoforms.

We conducted a systematic review of observational studies investigating associations between circulating 25-hydroxyvitamin D (25(OH)D) concentration and all-cause or cause-specific mortality in generally healthy populations. Relevant studies were identified using PubMed and EMBASE searches. After screening 722 unique records and removing those that were ineligible, 84 articles were included in this review. The vast majority of studies reported inverse associations between 25(OH)D concentration and all-cause mortality. This association appeared to be non-linear, with progressively lower mortality with increasing 25(OH)D up to a point, beyond which there was no further decrease. There is moderate evidence that vitamin D status is inversely associated with cancer mortality and death due to respiratory diseases, while for cardiovascular mortality, there is weak evidence of an association in observational studies, which is not supported by the data from intervention or Mendelian randomization studies. The relationship between vitamin D status and other causes of death remains uncertain due to limited data. Larger long-term studies are required to clarify these associations."

However, these expressions do not account for the influence of several parameters on bond behavior such as the type of surface preparation which is a mandatory and critical task in the strengthening application. The present work gives contributions to reduce this lack of knowledge. For this purpose, an experimental program composed of single-lap shear tests was carried out, the main parameters studied being: (i) the type of concrete surface preparation (i.e., grinding and sandblasting) and (ii) the bond length. Prior to the application of the EBR CFRP system, the roughness level provided by the different methods of surface preparation was characterized by a laser sensor. Test results revealed that sandblasting concrete surface preparation yielded higher values, in terms of maximum shear force and fracture energy. Finally, existing expressions in standards were upgraded in order to account for the concrete surface roughness level in the estimation of the bond strength.",Hypolipogenic Effect of Shikimic Acid Via Inhibition of MID1IP1 and Phosphorylation of AMPK/ACC.,https://www.ncbi.nlm.nih.gov/pubmed/30700011,International journal of molecular sciences,2019 05 13,"Although shikimic acid from Illicium verum has antioxidant, antibacterial, anti-inflammatory, and analgesic effects, the effect of shikimic acid on lipogenesis has not yet been explored. Thus, in the present study, hypolipogenic mechanism of shikimic acid was examined in HepG2, Huh7 and 3T3-L1 adipocyte cells. Shikimic acid showed weak cytotoxicity in HepG2, Huh7 and 3T3-L1 cells, but suppressed lipid accumulation in HepG2, Huh7 and 3T3-L1 cells by Oil Red O staining. Also, shikimic acid attenuated the mRNA expression of de novo lipogenesis related genes such as FAS, SREBP-1c, and LXR-α in HepG2 cells by RT-PCR analysis and suppressed the protein expression of SREBP-1c and LXR-α in HepG2 and 3T3-L1 cells. It should be noted that shikimic acid activated phosphorylation of AMP-activated protein kinase (AMPK)/Aacetyl-coenzyme A carboxylase (ACC) and reduced the expression of MID1 Interacting Protein 1 (MID1IP1) in HepG2, Huh7 and 3T3-L1 cells. Conversely, depletion of MID1IP1 activated phosphorylation of AMPK, while overexpression of MID1IP1 suppressed phosphorylation of AMPK in HepG2 cells. However, AMPK inhibitor compound c did not affect the expression of MID1IP1, indicating MID1IP1 as an upstream of AMPK. Taken together, our findings suggest that shikimic acid has hypolipogenic effect in HepG2 and 3T3-L1 cells via phosphorylation of AMPK/ACC and inhibition of MID1IP1 as a potent candidate for prevention or treatment of fatty liver and hyperlipidemia.",Identification of Diabetic Patients through Clinical and Para-Clinical Features in Mexico: An Approach Using Deep Neural Networks.,https://www.ncbi.nlm.nih.gov/pubmed/30700010,International journal of environmental research and public health,2019 06 13,"Diabetes is a chronic and noncommunicable but preventable disease that is affecting the Mexican population at worrying levels, being the first place in prevalence worldwide.

This generic motion segmentation approach can be transposed to several transportation sensor systems since no constraints are considered on segmented motions (6-DOF model). The tracking scheme is analyzed and its performance is evaluated under thorough experimental conditions including full-scale driving scenarios from known and available datasets. Results on challenging scenarios including the presence of multiple and simultaneous moving objects observed from a moving camera are reported and discussed.,Mitochondrial DNA Integrity: Role in Health and Disease.,https://www.ncbi.nlm.nih.gov/pubmed/30700008,Cells,2019 03 29,"As the primary cellular location for respiration and energy production, mitochondria serve in a critical capacity to the cell. Yet, by virtue of this very function of respiration, mitochondria are subject to constant oxidative stress that can damage one of the unique features of this organelle, its distinct genome. Damage to mitochondrial DNA (mtDNA) and loss of mitochondrial genome integrity is increasingly understood to play a role in the development of both severe early-onset maladies and chronic age-related diseases. In this article, we review the processes by which mtDNA integrity is maintained, with an emphasis on the repair of oxidative DNA lesions, and the cellular consequences of diminished mitochondrial genome stability.",High Risk of Hepatocellular Carcinoma Development in Fibrotic Liver: Role of the Hippo-YAP/TAZ Signaling Pathway.,https://www.ncbi.nlm.nih.gov/pubmed/30700007,International journal of molecular sciences,2019 05 13,"Liver cancer is the fourth leading cause of cancer-related death globally, accounting for approximately 800,000 deaths annually. Hepatocellular carcinoma (HCC) is the most common type of liver cancer, making up about 80% of cases. Liver fibrosis and its end-stage disease, cirrhosis, are major risk factors for HCC. A fibrotic liver typically shows persistent hepatocyte death and compensatory regeneration, chronic inflammation, and an increase in reactive oxygen species, which collaboratively create a tumor-promoting microenvironment via inducing genetic alterations and chromosomal instability, and activating various oncogenic molecular signaling pathways. In this article, we review recent advances in fields of liver fibrosis and carcinogenesis, and consider several molecular signaling pathways that promote hepato-carcinogenesis under the microenvironment of liver fibrosis. In particular, we pay attention to emerging roles of the Hippo-YAP/TAZ signaling pathway in stromal activation, hepatic fibrosis, and liver cancer.",Momilactones A and B Are α-Amylase and α-Glucosidase Inhibitors.,https://www.ncbi.nlm.nih.gov/pubmed/30700006,"Molecules (Basel, Switzerland)",2019 06 13,"Momilactones A (MA) and B (MB) are the active phytoalexins and allelochemicals in rice. In this study, MA and MB were purified from rice husk of Oryza sativa cv. Koshihikari by column chromatography, and purification was confirmed by high-performance liquid chromatography, thin-layer chromatography, gas chromatography-mass spectrometry, liquid chromatography-electrospray ionization-mass spectrometry (LC-ESI-MS), and ¹H and 13C nuclear magnetic resonance analyses. By in vitro assays, both MA and MB exerted potent inhibition on α-amylase and α-glucosidase activities. The inhibitory effect of MB on these two key enzymes was greater than that of MA. Both MA and MB exerted greater α-glucosidase suppression as compared to that of the commercial diabetic inhibitor acarbose. Quantities of MA and MB in rice grain were 2.07 ± 0.01 and 1.06 ± 0.01 µg/dry weight (DW), respectively. This study was the first to confirm the presence of MA and MB in refined rice grain and reported the α-amylase and α-glucosidase inhibitory activity of the two compounds. The improved protocol of LC-ESI-MS in this research was simple and effective to detect and isolate MA and MB in rice organs.",Overexpression of the Interferon-Inducible Isoform 4 of NCOA7 Dissects the Entry Route of Enveloped Viruses and Demonstrates that HIV Enters Cells via Fusion at the Plasma Membrane.,https://www.ncbi.nlm.nih.gov/pubmed/30700004,Viruses,2019 05 07,"The HIV-1 entry-route is a matter of ongoing controversy, and there is evidence for fusion either at the cell surface or from within endosomes. A recent report demonstrated that isoform 4 of nuclear receptor coactivator 7 (NCOA7iso4) interacts with endolysosomal vacuolar-type H⁺-ATPase (V-ATPase), increasing lytic activity and thereby severely affecting the entry of vesicular stomatitis virus glycoprotein (VSV-G)-mediated, but not HIV-Env-mediated, entry and infection. As basal expression of NCOA7iso4 is low in the absence of type-1 interferons, its overexpression is a novel tool to study viral entry.","Insect Consumption Attitudes among Vegans, Non-Vegan Vegetarians, and Omnivores.",https://www.ncbi.nlm.nih.gov/pubmed/30700003,Nutrients,2019 04 03,"Consumption of foods of insect origin is encouraged, since insect consumption is seen as one of the responses to the environmental impact of meat production.

Under the scenario of big data processing, privacy and security concerns become a very important consideration. This work focused on an approach to tackle the privacy and security issue of multimedia data/information in the internet of things domain. A solution based on Cryptographical Digital Signal Processor (CDSP), a Digital Signal Processor (DSP) based platform combined with dedicated instruction extension, has been proposed, to provide both programming flexibility and performance. We have evaluated CDSP, and the results show that the algorithms implemented on CDSP all have good performance. We have also taped out the platform designed for privacy and security concerns of multimedia transferring system based on CDSP. Using TSMC 55 nm technology, it could reach the speed of 360 MHz. Benefiting from its programmability, CDSP can be easily expanded to support more algorithms in this domain.","Effectiveness of a Large, Nation-Wide Smoking Abstinence Campaign in the Netherlands: A Longitudinal Study.",https://www.ncbi.nlm.nih.gov/pubmed/30699988,International journal of environmental research and public health,2019 06 13,"From 2014, the 28-day smoking abstinence campaign 'Stoptober' is held in the Netherlands. Each year, more than 50,000 people participate in what has become a nation-wide collective cessation attempt. This study aims to determine the short-term effects of 'Stoptober' on participants' smoking behavior and behavioral determinants. Stoptober participants completed online surveys before the start of the campaign (n = 6856) and three months later (n = 1127). Descriptive statistics and t-tests were performed to determine changes in smoking and behavioral determinants. Logistic regression analyses were used to identify differences between subgroups. After three months, 71.8% of respondents had quit smoking and consumption was reduced among sustained smokers. Cessation rates were similar for subgroups by age, sex and educational level. Cessation was positively associated with confidence and self-efficacy at baseline and negatively associated with past year quit attempts and addiction level at baseline. For quitters, we found favorable changes in attitude towards cessation related stress, social norms, social pressure to smoke, self-efficacy to quit, smoking habit strength and smoker identity. For sustained smokers, we found favorable changes in attitude towards cessation related stress, self-efficacy and smoking habit strength. These results suggest that an abstinence campaign with a wide reach in a national population may be effective in decreasing smoking prevalence and cigarette consumption among a broad range of participants.","Biology, Pathophysiological Role, and Clinical Implications of Exosomes: A Critical Appraisal.",https://www.ncbi.nlm.nih.gov/pubmed/30699987,Cells,2019 03 29,"Exosomes are membrane-enclosed entities of endocytic origin, which are generated during the fusion of multivesicular bodies (MVBs) and plasma membranes. Exosomes are released into the extracellular milieu or body fluids; this process was reported for mesenchymal, epithelial, endothelial, and different immune cells (B-cells and dendritic cells), and was reported to be correlated with normal physiological processes. The compositions and abundances of exosomes depend on their tissue origins and cell types. Exosomes range in size between 30 and 100 nm, and shuttle nucleic acids (DNA, messenger RNAs (mRNAs), microRNAs), proteins, and lipids between donor and target cells. Pathogenic microorganisms also secrete exosomes that modulate the host immune system and influence the fate of infections. Such immune-modulatory effect of exosomes can serve as a diagnostic biomarker of disease. On the other hand, the antigen-presenting and immune-stimulatory properties of exosomes enable them to trigger anti-tumor responses, and exosome release from cancerous cells suggests they contribute to the recruitment and reconstitution of components of tumor microenvironments. Furthermore, their modulation of physiological and pathological processes suggests they contribute to the developmental program, infections, and human diseases. Despite significant advances, our understanding of exosomes is far from complete, particularly regarding our understanding of the molecular mechanisms that subserve exosome formation, cargo packaging, and exosome release in different cellular backgrounds. The present study presents diverse biological aspects of exosomes, and highlights their diagnostic and therapeutic potentials.",Novel Bispecific Aptamer Enhances Immune Cytotoxicity Against MUC1-Positive Tumor Cells by MUC1-CD16 Dual Targeting.,https://www.ncbi.nlm.nih.gov/pubmed/30699986,"Molecules (Basel, Switzerland)",2019 06 13,"A promising strategy in cancer immunotherapy is the employment of a bispecific agent that can bind with both tumor markers and immunocytes for recruitment of lymphocytes to tumor sites and enhancement of anticancer immune reactions. Mucin1 (MUC1) is a tumor marker overexpressed in almost all adenocarcinomas, making it a potentially important therapeutic target. CD16 is expressed in several types of immunocytes, including NK cells, γδ-T cells, monocytes, and macrophages. In this study, we constructed the first bispecific aptamer (BBiApt) targeting both MUC1 and CD16. This aptamer consisted of two MUC1 aptamers and two CD16 aptamers linked together by three 60 nt DNA spacers. Compared with monovalent MUC1 or CD16 aptamers, BBiApt showed more potent avidity to both MUC1-positive tumor cells and CD16-positive immunocytes. Competition experiments indicated that BBiApt and monovalent aptamers bound to the same sites on the target cells. Moreover, BBiApt recruited more CD16-positive immunocytes around MUC1-positive tumor cells and enhanced the immune cytotoxicity against the tumor cells in vitro. The results suggest that, apart from bispecific antibodies, bispecific aptamers may also potentially serve as a novel strategy for targeted enhancement of antitumor immune reactions against MUC1-expressing malignancies.",Which Should Be Used First for ALK-Positive Non-Small-Cell Lung Cancer: Chemotherapy or Targeted Therapy? A Meta-Analysis of Five Randomized Trials.,https://www.ncbi.nlm.nih.gov/pubmed/30699985,"Medicina (Kaunas, Lithuania)",2019 03 29,"Background and objectives: Targeted therapy is widely used in the era of precision medicine. Whether the sequence in which targeted therapy and chemotherapy are performed matters, is however not known. We examined the impact of the sequential treatment of targeted therapy and chemotherapy among advanced anaplastic lymphoma kinase (ALK), non-small cell lung cancer (NSCLC) patients. Materials and Methods: Randomized controlled trials comparing the use of ALK inhibitors with chemotherapy were included in this meta-analysis. We estimated the hazard ratios (HRs) and 95% confidence intervals (CI), for progression-free survival (PFS) and overall survival (OS) from a random effects model. Two-sided statistical tests were used to determine the significance of these estimates. Results: In five eligible studies (1404 patients), ALK targeted therapy, in comparison with chemotherapy, had a significantly higher PFS (HR = 0.48; 95% CI, 0.42⁻0.55), but not significantly higher OS (HR = 0.88; 95% CI, 0.72⁻1.07). Crossover from chemotherapy to ALK inhibitors was allowed after progression in all trials. The sensitivity analysis of the use of ALK inhibitors as either the first- or second-line treatment, showed improvements in PFS but not in OS. Conclusions: Our results indicate that using targeted therapy first improved PFS, but that the sequence in which the treatments were performed did not cause a significant difference in overall survival.",Visible-broadband Localized Vector Vortex Beam Generator with a Multi-structure-composited Meta-surface.,https://www.ncbi.nlm.nih.gov/pubmed/30699984,"Nanomaterials (Basel, Switzerland)",2019 03 12,"We demonstrate a vortex beam generator meta-surface that consists of silver structures and graphene layers. The miniature material is just a few microns in size and the working part is only a few hundred nanometers thick. With the incidence of the linearly polarized beam, the meta-surface generates high-localized vector vortex beam with a high proportion of the longitudinal component. Being compared with the constituent part of the meta-surface, the multi-structure-combined meta-surface increases the localization by 250% and the longitudinal component proportion by 200%. Moreover, the above artificial material can generate vortex beams in broadband within the visible light range. These novel optical properties have the potential to improve the precision and sensitivity of nanoparticle manipulation. The study serves as a foundation in optical miniaturization and integration, nanoparticle manipulation, high-efficiency optical and quantum communication, and light-driven micro-tools.",The Role of the CopA Copper Efflux System in Acinetobacter baumannii Virulence.,https://www.ncbi.nlm.nih.gov/pubmed/30699983,International journal of molecular sciences,2019 05 13,"Acinetobacter baumannii has emerged as one of the leading causative agents of nosocomial infections. Due to its high level of intrinsic and adapted antibiotic resistance, treatment failure rates are high, which allows this opportunistic pathogen to thrive during infection in immune-compromised patients. A. baumannii can cause infections within a broad range of host niches, with pneumonia and bacteraemia being associated with the greatest levels of morbidity and mortality. Although its resistance to antibiotics is widely studied, our understanding of the mechanisms required for dealing with environmental stresses related to virulence and hospital persistence, such as copper toxicity, is limited. Here, we performed an in silico analysis of the A. baumannii copper resistome, examining its regulation under copper stress. Using comparative analyses of bacterial P-type ATPases, we propose that A. baumannii encodes a member of a novel subgroup of P1B-1 ATPases. Analyses of three putative inner membrane copper efflux systems identified the P1B-1 ATPase CopA as the primary mediator of cytoplasmic copper resistance in A. baumannii. Using a murine model of A. baumannii pneumonia, we reveal that CopA contributes to the virulence of A. baumannii. Collectively, this study advances our understanding of how A. baumannii deals with environmental copper toxicity, and it provides novel insights into how A. baumannii combats adversities encountered as part of the host immune defence.",Negative Regulatory Loop between Microphthalmia-Associated Transcription Factor (MITF) and Notch Signaling.,https://www.ncbi.nlm.nih.gov/pubmed/30699982,International journal of molecular sciences,2019 05 13,"Melanoma, a melanocyte-origin neoplasm, is a highly metastatic and treatment-resistance cancer. While it is well established that notch signaling activation promotes melanoma progression, little is known about the reciprocal interactions between Notch signaling and melanoma-specific pathways. Here we reveal a negative regulatory loop between Notch signaling and microphthalmia-associated transcription factor (MITF), the central regulator of melanoma progression and the driver of melanoma plasticity. We further demonstrate that Notch signaling activation, in addition to the known competition-based repression mechanism of MITF transcriptional activity, inhibits the transcription of MITF, leading to a decrease in MITF expression. We also found that MITF binds to the promoter of the gene encoding the master regulator of Notch signaling, recombination signal binding protein J kappa (RBPJK), leading to its upregulation. Our findings suggest that, once activated, Notch signaling represses MITF signaling to maintain the melanoma invasiveness and metastatic phenotype.",Spatial Reorganization of Myoelectric Activities in Extensor Digitorum for Sustained Finger Force Production.,https://www.ncbi.nlm.nih.gov/pubmed/30699981,"Sensors (Basel, Switzerland)",2019 02 27,"The study aims to explore the spatial distribution of multi-tendinous muscle modulated by central nervous system (CNS) during sustained contraction. Nine subjects were recruited to trace constant target forces with right index finger extension. Surface electromyography (sEMG) of extensor digitorum (ED) were recorded with a 32-channel electrode array. Nine successive topographic maps (TM) were obtained. Pixel wise analysis was utilized to extract subtracted topographic maps (STM), which exhibited inhomogeneous distribution. STMs were characterized into hot, warm, and cool regions corresponding to higher, moderate, and lower change ranges, respectively. The relative normalized area (normalized to the first phase) of these regions demonstrated different changing trends as rising, plateauing, and falling over time, respectively. Moreover, the duration of these trends were found to be affected by force level. The rising/falling periods were longer at lower force levels, while the plateau can be achieved from the initial phase for higher force output (45% maximal voluntary contraction). The results suggested muscle activity reorganization in ED plays a role to maintain sustained contraction. Furthermore, the decreased dynamical regulation ability to spatial reorganization may be prone to induce fatigue. This finding implied that spatial reorganization of muscle activity as a regulation mechanism contribute to maintain constant force production.","Erratum: Enrichi, F., et al.

The lack of congruence of salt tolerance quantitative trait loci (QTLs) in multiple genetic backgrounds and multiple environments is a major hindrance for undertaking marker-assisted selection (MAS). A genome-wide meta-analysis of QTLs controlling seedling-stage salt tolerance was conducted in rice using QTL information from 12 studies. Using a consensus map, 11 meta-QTLs for three traits with smaller confidence intervals were localized on chromosomes 1 and 2. The phenotypic variance of 3 meta-QTLs was ≥20%. Based on phenotyping of 56 diverse genotypes and breeding lines, six salt-tolerant genotypes (Bharathy, I Kung Ban 4-2 Mutant, Langmanbi, Fatehpur 3, CT-329, and IARI 5823) were identified. The perusal of the meta-QTL regions revealed several candidate genes associated with salt-tolerance attributes. The lack of association between meta-QTL linked markers and the level of salt tolerance could be due to the low resolution of meta-QTL regions and the genetic complexity of salt tolerance. The meta-QTLs identified in this study will be useful not only for MAS and pyramiding, but will also accelerate the fine mapping and cloning of candidate genes associated with salt-tolerance mechanisms in rice.",Graphene-Induced Osteogenic Differentiation Is Mediated by the Integrin/FAK Axis.,https://www.ncbi.nlm.nih.gov/pubmed/30699966,International journal of molecular sciences,2019 05 13,"Graphene is capable of promoting osteogenesis without chemical induction. Nevertheless, the underlying mechanism(s) remain largely unknown. The objectives here were: (i) to assess whether graphene scaffolds are capable of supporting osteogenesis in vivo and; (ii) to ascertain the participation of the integrin/FAK mechanotransduction axis during the osteogenic differentiation induced by graphene. MSC-impregnated graphene scaffolds (n = 6) were implanted into immunocompromised mice (28 days). Alternatively, MSCs were seeded onto PDMS substrates (modulus of elasticity = 130, 830 and 1300 kPa) coated with a single monomolecular layer of graphene and cultured in basal medium (10 days). The ensuing expressions of FAK-p397, integrin, ROCK1, F-actin, Smad p1/5, RUNX2, OCN and OPN were evaluated by Western blot (n = 3). As controls, MSCs were plated onto uncoated PDMS in the presence of mechanotransduction inhibitors (echistatin, Y27632 and DMH1). MSC-impregnated graphene scaffolds exhibited positive immunoexpression of bone-related markers (RUNX2 and OPN) without the assistance of osteogenic inducers. In vitro, regardless of the stiffness of the underlying PDMS substrate, MSCs seeded onto graphene-coated PDMS substrates demonstrated higher expressions of all tested osteogenic and integrin/FAK proteins tested compared to MSCs seeded onto PDMS alone. Hence, graphene promotes osteogenesis via the activation of the mechanosensitive integrin/FAK axis.",4-O-Methylhonokiol Influences Normal Cardiovascular Development in Medaka Embryo.,https://www.ncbi.nlm.nih.gov/pubmed/30699965,"Molecules (Basel, Switzerland)",2019 06 13,"Although 4-O-Methylhonokiol (MH) effects on neuronal and immune cells have been established, it is still unclear whether MH can cause a change in the structure and function of the cardiovascular system. The overarching goal of this study was to evaluate the effects of MH, isolated from Magnolia grandiflora, on the development of the heart and vasculature in a Japanese medaka model in vivo to predict human health risks. We analyzed the toxicity of MH in different life-stages of medaka embryos. MH uptake into medaka embryos was quantified. The LC50 of two different exposure windows (stages 9⁻36 (0⁻6 days post fertilization (dpf)) and 25⁻36 (2⁻6 dpf)) were 5.3 ± 0.1 μM and 9.9 ± 0.2 μM. Survival, deformities, days to hatch, and larval locomotor response were quantified. Wnt 1 was overexpressed in MH-treated embryos indicating deregulation of the Wnt signaling pathway, which was associated with spinal and cardiac ventricle deformities. Overexpression of major proinflammatory mediators and biomarkers of the heart were detected. Our results indicated that the differential sensitivity of MH in the embryos was developmental stage-specific. Furthermore, this study demonstrated that certain molecules can serve as promising markers at the transcriptional and phenotypical levels, responding to absorption of MH in the developing embryo.",Designing Paper-Based Immunoassays for Biomedical Applications.,https://www.ncbi.nlm.nih.gov/pubmed/30699964,"Sensors (Basel, Switzerland)",2019 02 27,"Paper-based sensors and assays have been highly attractive for numerous biological applications, including rapid diagnostics and assays for disease detection, food safety, and clinical care.

We previously identified aggrecanase activity that (a) cleaved at E↓G rather than E↓A bonds in the aggrecan core protein, and (b) was upregulated by retinoic acid but not IL-1α. The present study aimed to identify the alternative aggrecanase. Femoral head cartilage explants from TS-4/5∆cat mice were stimulated with IL-1α or retinoic acid and total RNA was analysed by microarray. In addition to ADAMTS-5 and matrix metalloproteinase (MMP)-13, which are not candidates for the novel aggrecanase, the microarray analyses identified MMP-11, calpain-5 and ADAMTS-9 as candidate aggrecanases upregulated by retinoic acid. When calpain-5 and MMP-11 failed to meet subsequent criteria, ADAMTS-9 emerged as the most likely candidate for the novel aggrecanase. Immunohistochemistry revealed ADAMTS-9 expression throughout the mouse growth plate and strong expression, particularly in the proliferative zone of the TS-4/5-∆cat mice. In conclusion, ADAMTS-9 has a novel specificity for aggrecan, cleaving primarily at E↓G rather than E↓A bonds in mouse cartilage. ADAMTS-9 might have more important roles in normal skeletal development compared with ADAMTS-4 and ADAMTS-5, which have key roles in joint pathology.",Arsenic Distribution Assessment in a Residential Area Polluted with Mining Residues.,https://www.ncbi.nlm.nih.gov/pubmed/30699962,International journal of environmental research and public health,2019 06 13,"Mining is a major source for metals and metalloids pollution, which could pose a risk for human health. In San Guillermo, Chihuahua, Mexico mining wastes are found adjacent to a residential area. A soil-surface sampling was performed, collecting 88 samples for arsenic determination by atomic absorption. Arsenic concentration data set was interpolated using the ArcGis models: inverse distance weighting (IDW), ordinary kriging (OK), and radial basis function (RBF). For method validation purposes, a set of the data was selected and two tests were performed (P1 and P2). In P1 the models were processed without the validation data; in P2 the validation data were removed one by one, models were processed every time that a data point was removed. An arsenic concentration range of 22.7 to 2190 mg/kg was reported. The 39% of data set was classified as contaminated soil and 61% as industrial land use. In P1 the method of interpolation with the lowest RMSE was RBF (0.80), the highest coefficient of E was RBF (46.25), and the highest Ceff value was with RBF (0.48). In P2 the method with the lowest RMSE was OK (0.76), the highest E value was 50.65 with OK, and the Ceff reported the highest value with OK (0.52). The high arsenic contamination in soil of the site indicates an abundant dispersion of this metalloid. Furthermore, the difference between the models was not very wide. The incorporation of more parameters would be of interest to observe the behavior of interpolation methods.","Xanthine Oxidase Inhibitory Potential, Antioxidant and Antibacterial Activities of Cordyceps militaris (L.)

In this study, the separation of constituents involved in xanthine oxidase (XO) inhibitory, antioxidant and antibacterial properties of C. militaris was conducted. Methods: The aqueous residue of this fungus was extracted by methanol and then subsequently fractionated by hexane, chloroform, ethyl acetate and water. The ethyl acetate extract possessed the highest XO inhibitory and antioxidant activities was separated to different fractions by column chromatography. Each fraction was then subjected to anti-hyperuricemia, antioxidant and antibacterial assays. Results: The results showed that the CM8 fraction exhibited the strongest XO inhibitory activity (the lowest IC50: 62.82 μg/mL), followed by the CM10 (IC50: 68.04 μg/mL) and the CM7 (IC50: 86.78 μg/mL). The level of XO inhibition was proportional to antioxidant activity. In antibacterial assay, the CM9 and CM11 fractions showed effective antibacterial activity (MIC values: 15⁻25 mg/mL and 10⁻25 mg/mL, respectively). Results from gas chromatography-mass spectrometry (GC-MS) analyses indicated that cordycepin was the major constituent in the CM8 and CM10 fractions. Conclusions: This study revealed that C. militaris was beneficial for treatment hyperuricemia although in vivo trials on compounds purified from this medicinal fungus are needed.",RNA Modifications Modulate Activation of Innate Toll-Like Receptors.,https://www.ncbi.nlm.nih.gov/pubmed/30699960,Genes,2019 03 29,"Self/foreign discrimination by the innate immune system depends on receptors that identify molecular patterns as associated to pathogens. Among others, this group includes endosomal Toll-like receptors, among which Toll-like receptors (TLR) 3, 7, 8, and 13 recognize and discriminate mammalian from microbial, potentially pathogen-associated, RNA. One of the discriminatory principles is the recognition of endogenous RNA modifications. Previous work has identified a couple of RNA modifications that impede activation of TLR signaling when incorporated in synthetic RNA molecules. Of note, work that is more recent has now shown that RNA modifications in their naturally occurring context can have immune-modulatory functions: Gm, a naturally occurring ribose-methylation within tRNA resulted in a lack of TLR7 stimulation and within a defined sequence context acted as antagonist. Additional RNA modifications with immune-modulatory functions have now been identified and recent work also indicates that RNA modifications within the context of whole prokaryotic or eukaryotic cells are indeed used for immune-modulation. This review will discuss new findings and developments in the field of immune-modulatory RNA modifications.",Chewing the Fat: The Conserved Ability of DNA Viruses to Hijack Cellular Lipid Metabolism.,https://www.ncbi.nlm.nih.gov/pubmed/30699959,Viruses,2019 05 07,"Viruses manipulate numerous host factors and cellular pathways to facilitate the replication of viral genomes and the production of infectious progeny. One way in which viruses interact with cells is through the utilization and exploitation of the host lipid metabolism. While it is likely that most-if not all-viruses require lipids or intermediates of lipid synthesis to replicate, many viruses also actively induce lipid metabolic pathways to sustain a favorable replication environment. From the formation of membranous replication compartments, to the generation of ATP or protein modifications, viruses exhibit differing requirements for host lipids. Thus, while the exploitation of lipid metabolism is a common replication strategy, diverse viruses employ a plethora of mechanisms to co-opt these critical cellular pathways. Here, we review recent literature regarding the exploitation of host lipids and lipid metabolism specifically by DNA viruses. Importantly, furthering the understanding of the viral requirements for host lipids may offer new targets for antiviral therapeutics and provide opportunities to repurpose the numerous FDA-approved compounds targeting lipid metabolic pathways as antiviral agents.",In silico Identification of Novel Toxin Homologs and Associated Mobile Genetic Elements in Clostridium perfringens.,https://www.ncbi.nlm.nih.gov/pubmed/30699957,"Pathogens (Basel, Switzerland)",2019 04 28,"Clostridium perfringens causes a wide range of diseases in a variety of hosts, due to the production of a diverse set of toxins and extracellular enzymes. The C. perfringens toxins play an important role in pathogenesis, such that the presence and absence of the toxins is used as a typing scheme for the species. In recent years, several new toxins have been discovered that have been shown to be essential or highly correlated to diseases; these include binary enterotoxin (BecAB), NetB and NetF. In the current study, genome sequence analysis of C. perfringens isolates from diverse sources revealed several putative novel toxin homologs, some of which appeared to be associated with potential mobile genetic elements, including transposons and plasmids. Four novel toxin homologs encoding proteins related to the pore-forming Leukocidin/Hemolysin family were found in type A and G isolates. Two novel toxin homologs encoding proteins related to the epsilon aerolysin-like toxin family were identified in Type A and F isolates from humans, contaminated food and turkeys. A novel set of proteins related to clostridial binary toxins was also identified. While phenotypic characterisation is required before any of these homologs can be established as functional toxins, the in silico identification of these novel homologs on mobile genetic elements suggests the potential toxin reservoir of C. perfringens may be much larger than previously thought."

Dental pulp stem cells (DPSCs) have been proposed to replace the degenerated dopaminergic neurons due to its inherent neurogenic and regenerative potential. However, the effective delivery and homing of DPSCs within the lesioned brain has been one of the many obstacles faced in cell-based therapy of neurodegenerative disorders. We hypothesized that DPSCs, delivered intranasally, could circumvent these challenges. In the present study, we investigated the therapeutic efficacy of intranasally administered DPSCs in a 1-methyl-4-phenyl-1,2,3,6-tetrahydropyridine (MPTP)-induced mouse model of PD. Human deciduous DPSCs were cultured, pre-labelled with PKH 26, and intranasally delivered into PD mice following MPTP treatment. Behavioural analyses were performed to measure olfactory function and sensorimotor coordination, while tyrosine hydroxylase (TH) immunofluorescence was used to evaluate MPTP neurotoxicity in SNpc neurons. Upon intranasal delivery, degenerated TH-positive neurons were ameliorated, while deterioration in behavioural performances was significantly enhanced. Thus, the intranasal approach enriched cell delivery to the brain, optimizing its therapeutic potential through its efficacious delivery and protection against dopaminergic neuron degeneration.",Evaluation of Solar-Driven Photocatalytic Activity of Thermal Treated TiO₂ under Various Atmospheres.,https://www.ncbi.nlm.nih.gov/pubmed/30699943,"Nanomaterials (Basel, Switzerland)",2019 03 12,"In this report, the photocatalytic activity of P25 has been explored and the influence of thermal treatment under various atmospheres (air, vacuum and hydrogen) were discussed. The samples' characteristics were disclosed by means of various instruments including X-ray diffraction (XRD), Electron paramagnetic resonance (EPR), X-ray photoelectron spectroscopy (XPS) and UV⁻vis. This study also accentuates various states of the oxygen vacancy density formed inside the samples as well as the colour turning observed in treated P25 under various atmospheres. Produced coloured TiO₂ samples were then exploited for their photocatalytic capability concerning photodegradation of methylene blue (MB) using air mass (AM) 1.5 G solar light irradiation. Our findings revealed that exceptional photocatalytic activity of P25 is related to the thermal treatment. Neither oxygen vacancy formation nor photocatalytic activity enhancement was observed in the air-treated sample. H₂-treated samples have shown better photoactivity which even could be further improved by optimizing treatment conditions to achieve the advantages of the positive role of oxygen vacancy (O-vacancy at higher concentration than optimum acts as electron trapping sites). The chemical structure and stability of the samples were also studied. There was no sign of deteriorating of O₂-vacancies inside the samples after 6 months. High stability of thermal treated samples in terms of both long and short-term time intervals is another significant feature of the produced photocatalyst.",Combined Amino Acid Positron Emission Tomography and Advanced Magnetic Resonance Imaging in Glioma Patients.,https://www.ncbi.nlm.nih.gov/pubmed/30699942,Cancers,2019 03 29,"Imaging techniques such as positron emission tomography (PET) and magnetic resonance imaging (MRI) provide valuable information about brain tumor patients. Particularly amino acid PET, advanced MRI techniques, and combinations thereof are of great interest for the non-invasive assessment of biological characteristics in patients with primary or secondary brain cancer. A methodological innovation that potentially advances research in patients with brain tumors is the increasing availability of hybrid PET/MRI systems, which enables the simultaneous acquisition of both imaging modalities. Furthermore, the advent of ultra-high field MRI scanners operating at magnetic field strengths of 7 T or more will allow further development of metabolic MR imaging at higher resolution. This review focuses on the combination of amino acid PET with MR spectroscopic imaging, perfusion- and diffusion-weighted imaging, as well as chemical exchange saturation transfer in patients with high-grade gliomas, especially glioblastomas.","Ripe and Raw Pu-Erh Tea: LC-MS Profiling, Antioxidant Capacity and Enzyme Inhibition Activities of Aqueous and Hydro-Alcoholic Extracts.",https://www.ncbi.nlm.nih.gov/pubmed/30699941,"Molecules (Basel, Switzerland)",2019 06 13,"Herein, we reported a detailed profiling of soluble components of two fermented varieties of Chinese green tea, namely raw and ripe pu-erh. The identification and quantification of the main components was carried out by means of mass spectrometry and UV spectroscopy, after chromatographic separation. The antioxidant capacity towards different radical species, the anti-microbial and the enzyme inhibition activities of the extracts were then correlated to their main constituents. Despite a superimposable qualitative composition, a similar caffeine content, and similar enzyme inhibition and antimicrobial activities, raw pu-erh tea extract had a better antioxidant capacity owing to its higher polyphenol content. However, the activity of raw pu-erh tea seems not to justify its higher production costs and ripe variety appears to be a valid and low-cost alternative for the preparation of products with antioxidant or antimicrobial properties.",Low Molecular Mass Myocardial Hyaluronan in Human Hypertrophic Cardiomyopathy.,https://www.ncbi.nlm.nih.gov/pubmed/30699940,Cells,2019 03 29,"During the development of hypertrophic cardiomyopathy, the heart returns to fetal energy metabolism where cells utilize more glucose instead of fatty acids as a source of energy. Metabolism of glucose can increase synthesis of the extracellular glycosaminoglycan hyaluronan, which has been shown to be involved in the development of cardiac hypertrophy and fibrosis. The aim of this study was to investigate hyaluronan metabolism in cardiac tissue from patients with hypertrophic cardiomyopathy in relation to cardiac growth. NMR and qRT-PCR analysis of human cardiac tissue from hypertrophic cardiomyopathy patients and healthy control hearts showed dysregulated glucose and hyaluronan metabolism in the patients. Gas phase electrophoresis revealed a higher amount of low molecular mass hyaluronan and larger cardiomyocytes in cardiac tissue from patients with hypertrophic cardiomyopathy. Histochemistry showed high concentrations of hyaluronan around individual cardiomyocytes in hearts from hypertrophic cardiomyopathy patients. Experimentally, we could also observe accumulation of low molecular mass hyaluronan in cardiac hypertrophy in a rat model. In conclusion, the development of hypertrophic cardiomyopathy with increased glucose metabolism affected both hyaluronan molecular mass and amount. The process of regulating cardiomyocyte size seems to involve fragmentation of hyaluronan.","Photocatalytic Performance of CuxO/TiO₂ Deposited by HiPIMS on Polyester under Visible Light LEDs: Oxidants, Ions Effect, and Reactive Oxygen Species Investigation.",https://www.ncbi.nlm.nih.gov/pubmed/30699939,"Materials (Basel, Switzerland)",2019 02 24,"In the present study, we propose a new photocatalytic interface prepared by high-power impulse magnetron sputtering (HiPIMS), and investigated for the degradation of Reactive Green 12 (RG12) as target contaminant under visible light light-emitting diodes (LEDs) illumination. The CuxO/TiO₂ nanoparticulate photocatalyst was sequentially sputtered on polyester (PES). The photocatalyst formulation was optimized by investigating the effect of different parameters such as the sputtering time of CuxO, the applied current, and the deposition mode (direct current magnetron sputtering, DCMS or HiPIMS). The results showed that the fastest RG12 degradation was obtained on CuxO/TiO₂ sample prepared at 40 A in HiPIMS mode. The better discoloration efficiency of 53.4% within 360 min was found in 4 mg/L of RG12 initial concentration and 0.05% Cuwt/PESwt as determined by X-ray fluorescence. All the prepared samples contained a TiO₂ under-layer with 0.02% Tiwt/PESwt. By transmission electron microscopy (TEM), both layers were seen uniformly distributed on the PES fibers. The effect of the surface area to volume (dye volume) ratio (SA/V) on the photocatalytic efficiency was also investigated for the discoloration of 4 mg/L RG12. The effect of the presence of different chemicals (scavengers, oxidant or mineral pollution or salts) in the photocatalytic medium was studied. The optimization of the amount of added hydrogen peroxide (H₂O₂) and potassium persulfate (K₂S₂O₈) was also investigated in detail. Both, H₂O₂ and K₂S₂O₈ drastically affected the discoloration efficiency up to 7 and 6 times in reaction rate constants, respectively. Nevertheless, the presence of Cu (metallic nanoparticles) and NaCl salt inhibited the reaction rate of RG12 discoloration by about 4 and 2 times, respectively. Moreover, the systematic study of reactive oxygen species' (ROS) contribution was also explored with the help of iso-propanol, methanol, and potassium dichromate as •OH radicals, holes (h⁺), and superoxide ion-scavengers, respectively. Scavenging results showed that O₂- played a primary role in RG12 removal; however, •OH radicals' and photo-generated holes' (h⁺) contributions were minimal. The CuxO/TiO₂ photocatalyst was found to have a good reusability and stability up to 21 cycles. Ions' release was quantified by means of inductively coupled plasma mass spectrometry (ICP-MS) showing low Cu-ions' release.",Targeting Hedgehog Signalling through the Ubiquitylation Process: The Multiple Roles of the HECT-E3 Ligase Itch.,https://www.ncbi.nlm.nih.gov/pubmed/30699938,Cells,2019 03 29,"Hedgehog signalling (Hh) is a developmental conserved pathway strongly involved in cancers when deregulated. This important pathway is orchestrated by numerous regulators, transduces through distinct routes and is finely tuned at multiple levels. In this regard, ubiquitylation processes stand as essential for controlling Hh pathway output. Although this post-translational modification governs proteins turnover, it is also implicated in non-proteolytic events, thereby regulating the most important cellular functions. The HECT E3 ligase Itch, well known to control immune response, is emerging to have a pivotal role in tumorigenesis. By illustrating Itch specificities on Hh signalling key components, here we review the role of this HECT E3 ubiquitin ligase in suppressing Hh-dependent tumours and explore its potential as promising target for innovative therapeutic approaches.",The Form of N Supply Determines Plant Growth Promotion by P-Solubilizing Microorganisms in Maize.,https://www.ncbi.nlm.nih.gov/pubmed/30699936,Microorganisms,2019 03 29,"Phosphate-(P)-solubilizing microorganisms (PSM) are important drivers of P cycling in natural and agro-ecosystems. Their use as plant inoculants to improve P acquisition of crops has been investigated for decades. However, limited reproducibility of the expected effects, particularly under field conditions, remains a major challenge. This study demonstrates that the form of nitrogen fertilization has a significant impact on the performance of various fungal and bacterial PSM inoculants in maize grown on neutral to alkaline soils with limited P availability. Under these conditions, a high soil pH-buffering capacity frequently limits the efficiency of nutrient mobilization, mediated by plant roots and microorganisms via rhizosphere acidification. In a soil pH range between 7.0 and 8.0, nitrate fertilization promoting rhizosphere alkalinisation further aggravates this problem. Accordingly, in greenhouse experiments, six strains of Pseudomonas, Bacillus, Paenibacillus, Streptomyces, and Penicillium with proven P-solubilizing potential, completely failed to promote P acquisition in maize grown on a calcareous Loess sub-soil pH 7.6 with nitrate fertilization and rock phosphate (Rock-P) as a sparingly soluble P source. However, after replacement of nitrate fertilization by ammonium, stabilized with the nitrification inhibitor 3,4-dimethylpyrazole-phosphate (DMPP), five out of seven investigated PSM inoculants (comprising 12 fungal and bacterial PSM strains) exerted beneficial effects on plant growth and reached up to 88% of the shoot biomass production of a control supplied with soluble triple-superphosphate (TSP). Stabilized ammonium combined with PSM-inoculants improved P acquisition (Trichoderma harzianum T22, Pseudomonas sp. DMSZ 13134), while other strains particularly stimulated root growth (T. harzianum OMG16, Bacillus amyloliquefaciens FZB42), which promoted the acquisition also of other mineral nutrients, such as N, K, and Mn. A similar effect was recorded under field conditions on an alkaline clay-loam soil pH 8.6. The combination of stabilized ammonium with a range of consortium products based on T. harzianum OMG16, B. amyloliquefaciens, micronutrients, and humic acids completely compensated the effect of a TSP fertilization on field establishment, nutrient acquisition, and yield formation in maize, while non-stabilized urea-di-ammonium phosphate fertilization was largely ineffective. These findings suggest that the efficiency of PSM-plant interactions can be influenced by the form of N fertilization, offering promising perspectives for synergistic effects with stabilized ammonium fertilizers.",Pulp Temperature Rise Induced by Light-Emitting Diode Light-Curing Units Using an Ex Vivo Model.,https://www.ncbi.nlm.nih.gov/pubmed/30699935,"Materials (Basel, Switzerland)",2019 02 24,"The aim of this research was to compare the pulp temperature (PT) rise induced by four light-emitting diode light-curing units (LED LCUs) (Bluephase 20i, Demi Ultra, SPEC 3, and Valo) in different curing modes. Immediately after extraction, the pulp chamber of 11 premolars was accessed from the palatal cervical third of the crown for insertion of fiber Bragg grating (FBG) sensors for temperature measurement and kept in a 37.0° water bath. The teeth were then submitted to a random sequence of curing modes with four irradiations at 30 s intervals. Care was taken to ensure complete pulp temperature reset between curing modes. The curing modes were classified as high-energy (above 80 J/cm²) or low-energy (below 40 J/cm²) according to the total energy density delivered. Statistical analysis was performed with repeated ANOVA measures and Pearson's correlation for the association between energy density and temperature variation. The significance level was set to 0.05. All curing units promoted a statistically significant PT rise (p < 0.01). After four emissions, the PT rise was higher than 5.0 °C for the high-energy curing modes. The low-energy modes induced approximately a 2.5 °C rise. A strong positive correlation was found between energy density and PT increase (R = 0.715; p = 0.01). Exposure of intact premolars to LED LCUs induced significant and cumulative PT rise. Curing modes emitting high energy densities produced higher PT variations. Radiant exposure was positively correlated to PT variation.",Adjuvant Ipilimumab in High-Risk Uveal Melanoma.,https://www.ncbi.nlm.nih.gov/pubmed/30699934,Cancers,2019 03 29,"Uveal melanoma is a common intraocular malignant tumor that is uniformly fatal once metastatic. No effective adjuvant therapy currently exists to reduce the risk of distant metastasis after definitive treatment of the primary lesion. Immunotherapy has been used effectively in the adjuvant setting in locally advanced cutaneous melanoma. We performed a Phase I/II clinical trial of adjuvant ipilimumab in high-risk primary uveal melanoma with distant metastasis-free survival (DMFS) as the primary objective. A total of 10 patients with genomically high-risk disease were treated: three at a dose of 3 mg/kg and seven at 10 mg/kg. Two of the seven patients at the higher dose had to discontinue therapy secondary to grade 3 toxicity. At 36 months follow-up, 80% of patients had no evidence of distant disease (95% CI, 58.7⁻100). With recent advancements in CTLA-4 inhibition, PD-1 inhibition, and combined checkpoint blockade, immunotherapy is a promising avenue of treatment in uveal melanoma. Further clinical trials are needed to elucidate the role of immunotherapy in the adjuvant setting."

This knowledge generation has been paramount for the development of improved intervention strategies. Yet, despite a broad knowledge base of direct risk factors for schistosomiasis, there remains a paucity of information related to more complex, interconnected, and often hidden drivers of transmission that hamper intervention successes and sustainability. Such complex, multidirectional, non-linear, and synergistic interdependencies are best understood by looking at the integrated system as a whole. A research approach able to address this complexity and find previously neglected causal mechanisms for transmission, which include a wide variety of influencing factors, is needed. Systems epidemiology, as a holistic research approach, can integrate knowledge from classical epidemiology, with that of biology, ecology, social sciences, and other disciplines, and link this with informal, tacit knowledge from experts and affected populations. It can help to uncover wider-reaching but difficult-to-identify processes that directly or indirectly influence exposure, infection, transmission, and disease development, as well as how these interrelate and impact one another. Drawing on systems epidemiology to address persisting disease hotspots, failed intervention programmes, and systematically neglected population groups in mass drug administration programmes and research studies, can help overcome barriers in the progress towards schistosomiasis elimination. Generating a comprehensive view of the schistosomiasis system as a whole should thus be a priority research agenda towards the strategic goal of morbidity control and transmission elimination.",Proteins and Signaling Pathways Response to Dry Needling Combined with Static Stretching Treatment for Chronic Myofascial Pain in a RAT Model: An Explorative Proteomic Study.,https://www.ncbi.nlm.nih.gov/pubmed/30699921,International journal of molecular sciences,2019 05 13,"A quantitative proteomic analysis of the response to dry needling combined with static stretching treatment was performed in a rat model of active myofascial trigger points (MTrPs). 36 rats were divided into a model group (MG), a stretching group (SG) and a dry needling combined with stretching group (SDG). We performed three biological replicates to compare large-scale differential protein expression between groups by tandem mass tag (TMT) labeling technology based on nanoscale liquid chromatography mass spectrometry analysis (LC⁻MS/MS). Hierarchical clustering, Gene Ontology (GO), Kyoto Encyclopedia of Genes and Genomes (KEGG) enrichment and protein-protein interaction network analyses were performed for the general characterization of overall enriched proteins. For validation of the results of TMT, the candidate proteins were verified by parallel reaction monitoring (PRM) analysis. 285 differentially expressed proteins between groups were identified and quantified. Tight junction pathway played a dominant role in dry needling combined with static stretching treatment for the rat model of active MTrPs. Three candidate proteins, namely actinin alpha 3, calsequestrin-1 and parvalbumin alpha, were further validated, consistent with the results of LC⁻MS/MS.

In Zambia, an estimated 14% of women are vitamin A-deficient, ~50% are anemic, 10% are underweight, and 23% are overweight/obese. A cross-sectional survey determined food and nutrient intakes of randomly selected Zambian women (n = 530) of reproductive age (15⁻49 years). Dietary intake data were collected using interactive multiple-pass 24-h recalls. Carbohydrate, fat, protein, and selected micronutrient intakes were estimated. Prevalence of adequate intakes were determined using the estimated average requirement (EAR) cut-point method and comparisons between lactating and non-lactating women were made by two-sample t-tests. The response rate was 98.7%. Overweight/obesity occurred in 20.7% (95% confidence interval (CI: 17.2, 24.5)). Almost all micronutrient intakes were inadequate, with values between 22.3% and 99.9%. Mean iron intake was >EAR, and 8.2% of women tested (12/146, 95% CI: 4.1, 13.0) were anemic (hemoglobin <115 g/L). Calcium intake was higher in lactating than non-lactating women (p = 0.004), but all intakes need improvement. Vitamin intakes in rural Zambian women are inadequate, suggesting a need for health promotion messages to encourage intake of locally available micronutrient-dense foods as well as supplementation, fortification, and biofortification initiatives. Nutritional support is important because maternal nutrition directly impacts child health.","Green Waste-Derived Substances Immobilized on SBA-15 Silica: Surface Properties, Adsorbing and Photosensitizing Activities towards Organic and Inorganic Substrates.",https://www.ncbi.nlm.nih.gov/pubmed/30699919,"Nanomaterials (Basel, Switzerland)",2019 03 12,"Urban wastes are a potential source of environment contamination, especially when they are not properly disposed. Nowadays, researchers are finding innovative solutions for recycling and reusing wastes in order to favour a sustainable development from the viewpoint of circular economy. In this context, the lignin-like fraction of biomass derived from Green Compost is a cost-effective source of soluble Bio-Based Substances (BBS-GC), namely complex macromolecules/supramolecular aggregates characterized by adsorbing and photosensitizing properties. In this work BBS-GC were immobilized on a silica support (SBA-15) and the chemico-physical properties of the resulting hybrid material (BBS-SBA) were analysed by zeta-potential measurements, nitrogen adsorption at 77K and micro-calorimetric techniques. Successively, the BBS-SBA photosensitizing and adsorption abilities were tested. Adsorption in the dark of Rhodamine B and Orange II on BBS-SBA and their degradation upon irradiation under simulated solar light were shown, together with the formation of hydroxyl radicals detected by Electron Paramagnetic Resonance spectroscopy. Furthermore, the adsorption of six inorganic ions (Al, Ni, Mn, As, Hg, Cr) on BBS-SBA was studied in pure water at two different pH values and in a landfill leachate, showing the good potential of this kind of materials in the removal of wastewater contaminants.",Nutrient Profiling Is Needed to Improve the Nutritional Quality of the Foods Labelled with Health-Related Claims.,https://www.ncbi.nlm.nih.gov/pubmed/30699918,Nutrients,2019 04 03,Health-related claims on food products influence consumers and their food preferences. None of the European countries have restricted the use of health claims to foods of high nutritional quality despite the regulatory background provided by the European Union in 2006. We evaluated the nutritional quality of foods labelled with claims available in the Slovenian market using two nutrient profile models-Food Standards Australia New Zealand (FSANZ) and European World Health Organization Regional office for Europe model (WHOE)-and compared the results to the nutritional quality of all available foods. Data for prepacked foods in the Slovenian food supply were collected in 2015 on a representative sample (n = 6619) and supplemented with 12-month product sales data for more accurate assessments of the food supply. A considerable proportion of foods labelled with any type of health-related claim was found to have poor nutritional quality. About 68% of the foods labelled with health-related claims passed FSANZ criterion (75% when considering sales data) and 33% passed the WHOE model (56% when considering sales data). Our results highlight the need for stricter regulations for the use of health-related claims and to build upon available nutrient profiling knowledge to improve nutrition quality of foods labeled with health-related claims.,Nano-Graphitic based Non-Volatile Memories Fabricated by the Dynamic Spray-Gun Deposition Method.,https://www.ncbi.nlm.nih.gov/pubmed/30699917,Micromachines,2019 04 10,"This paper deals with the fabrication of Resistive Random Access Memory (ReRAM) based on oxidized carbon nanofibers (CNFs). Stable suspensions of oxidized CNFs have been prepared in water and sprayed on an appropriate substrate, using the dynamic spray-gun deposition method, developed at Thales Research and Technology. This technique allows extremely uniform mats to be produced while heating the substrate at the boiling point of the solvent used for the suspensions. A thickness of around 150 nm of CNFs sandwiched between two metal layers (the metalized substrate and the top contacts) has been achieved, creating a Metal-Insulator-Metal (MIM) structure typical of ReRAM. After applying a bias, we were able to change the resistance of the oxidized layer between a low (LRS) and a high resistance state (HRS) in a completely reversible way. This is the first time that a scientific group has produced this kind of device using CNFs and these results pave the way for the further implementation of this kind of memory on flexible substrates.",Metabolomic and Transcriptomic Analyses of Escherichia coli for Efficient Fermentation of L-Fucose.,https://www.ncbi.nlm.nih.gov/pubmed/30699916,Marine drugs,2019 06 03,"L-Fucose, one of the major monomeric sugars in brown algae, possesses high potential for use in the large-scale production of bio-based products. Although fucose catabolic pathways have been enzymatically evaluated, the effects of fucose as a carbon source on intracellular metabolism in industrial microorganisms such as Escherichia coli are still not identified. To elucidate the effects of fucose on cellular metabolism and to find clues for efficient conversion of fucose into bio-based products, comparative metabolomic and transcriptomic analyses were performed on E. coli on L-fucose and on D-glucose as a control. When fucose was the carbon source for E. coli, integration of the two omics analyses revealed that excess gluconeogenesis and quorum sensing led to severe depletion of ATP, resulting in accumulation and export of fucose extracellularly. Therefore, metabolic engineering and optimization are needed for E. coil to more efficiently ferment fucose. This is the first multi-omics study investigating the effects of fucose on cellular metabolism in E. coli. These omics data and their biological interpretation could be used to assist metabolic engineering of E. coli producing bio-based products using fucose-containing brown macroalgae.",Self-Assembling Hybrid Linear-Dendritic Block Copolymers: The Design of Nano-Carriers for Lipophilic Antitumoral Drugs.,https://www.ncbi.nlm.nih.gov/pubmed/30699915,"Nanomaterials (Basel, Switzerland)",2019 03 12,"Two series of amphiphilic block copolymers with a hybrid linear-dendritic structure are presented. The compounds consisted of a hydrophilic poly (ethylene glycol) (PEG) block and a 2,2'-bis(hydroxymethyl)propionic acid (bis-MPA) dendron functionalized with stearic acid chains that impart a hydrophobic nature to the block. Different self-assembled nanostructures with a hydrophobic interior and a hydrophilic external part were obtained depending on the length of the PEG chain (Mn = 2000 and Mn = 5000) and the generation of the bis-MPA dendron. The materials were characterized by transmission electron microscopy (TEM). The shapes of the aggregates ranged from spherical or cylindrical micelles to flexible bilayers. The hydrophobic core enabled these nanostructures to encapsulate the water-insoluble drug plitidepsin. The efficacy of these new plitidepsin-containing carriers was evaluated in four cancer cell-lines and they showed similar anticancer activity to the current standard drug formulation.",Impairment of Motor Function Correlates with Neurometabolite and Brain Iron Alterations in Parkinson's Disease.,https://www.ncbi.nlm.nih.gov/pubmed/30699914,Cells,2019 03 29,"We took advantage of magnetic resonance imaging (MRI) and spectroscopy (MRS) as non-invasive methods to quantify brain iron and neurometabolites, which were analyzed along with other predictors of motor dysfunction in Parkinson's disease (PD). Tapping hits, tremor amplitude, and the scores derived from part III of the Movement Disorder Society-Sponsored Revision of the Unified Parkinson Disease Rating Scale (MDS-UPDRS3 scores) were determined in 35 male PD patients and 35 controls. The iron-sensitive MRI relaxation rate R2* was measured in the globus pallidus and substantia nigra. γ-aminobutyric acid (GABA)-edited and short echo-time MRS was used for the quantification of neurometabolites in the striatum and thalamus. Associations of R2*, neurometabolites, and other factors with motor function were estimated with Spearman correlations and mixed regression models to account for repeated measurements (hands, hemispheres). In PD patients, R2* and striatal GABA correlated with MDS-UPDRS3 scores if not adjusted for age. Patients with akinetic-rigid PD subtype (N = 19) presented with lower creatine and striatal glutamate and glutamine (Glx) but elevated thalamic GABA compared to controls or mixed PD subtype. In PD patients, Glx correlated with an impaired dexterity when adjusted for covariates. Elevated myo-inositol was associated with more tapping hits and lower MDS-UPDRS3 scores. Our neuroimaging study provides evidence that motor dysfunction in PD correlates with alterations in brain iron and neurometabolites."

In this context, we performed an intervention study that aimed to compare the effect of the administration of two doses (7 billion and 70 billion bacterial cells) of a multistrain probiotic formulation on the persistence of the four probiotic strains that were present in the product in the fecal samples collected from healthy subjects. The overall persistence of the probiotic strains was significantly higher for the 70 billion formulation than for the 7 billion formulation. Furthermore, probiotic strains were detected earlier and for longer for the 70 billion formulation compared to those for the 7 billion formulation. All probiotic strains were recovered alive from the 70 billion preparation, whereas recovery was not possible in a few fecal samples upon administration of the 7 billion preparation. In addition, the overall number of viable probiotic cells recovered on day 14 (i.e., the last day of consumption) was significantly higher for the 70 billion formulation than that for the 7 billion formulation. Finally, we found that the viability of the probiotic cells was stable over the course of the trial independent of volunteers' handling, demonstrating good manufacturing of the product. In conclusion, this study demonstrated that strains belonging to different taxa may coexist in the human gastrointestinal tract upon ingestion of a multispecies probiotic formulation. Moreover, this study suggests that higher doses of bacterial cells in probiotic formulations may permit a higher, earlier, and longer recovery of the probiotics in the feces of healthy adults.",Cognitive Behavioral Therapy (CBT) in Psychogenic Non-Epileptic Seizures (PNES): A Case Report and Literature Review.,https://www.ncbi.nlm.nih.gov/pubmed/30699899,"Behavioral sciences (Basel, Switzerland)",2019 03 10,"Psychogenic non-epileptic seizures (PNES) are classified as a somatoform conversion disorder. We present a case of a 24-year-old male with a past psychiatric history of posttraumatic stress disorder (PTSD) and anxiety disorder, admitted to our inpatient psychiatric unit. The patient experienced multiple episodes of seizures during hospitalization. Work up was unremarkable, and PNES were suspected and later confirmed with video-electroencephalography (video-EEG). He underwent supervised withdrawal of antiepileptic medications with the initiation of cognitive behavioral therapy (CBT), which reduced the frequency of seizures. Diagnosis of PNES can present as a challenge and failure to diagnose its psychological nature can lead to a delay in the psychological intervention. CBT leads to a decrease in seizure frequency, and improvement in psychiatric symptoms, psychosocial functioning, and quality of life. It is important to consider PNES in the differential diagnosis of seizures presented by psychiatric patients, as CBT is necessary for better patient outcomes.",The Influence of Physical Fitness on Reasons for Academy Separation in Law Enforcement Recruits.,https://www.ncbi.nlm.nih.gov/pubmed/30699898,International journal of environmental research and public health,2019 06 13,"This study analyzed the effects physical fitness may have on reasons for academy separation in law enforcement recruits. A retrospective analysis was conducted on 401 recruits; 330 recruits graduated (GRAD), and 71 recruits separated at various times during academy. Twenty-eight recruits separated for personal reasons (SEPPR); 18 due to physical training failures (i.e., poor fitness) or injury (SEPFI); and 25 due to academic or scenario failures (SEPAS). Fitness testing occurred prior to academy, and included: Push-ups and sit-ups in 60s; a 75-yard pursuit run (75PR); vertical jump; medicine ball throw; and multistage fitness test (MSFT). A one-way ANOVA with Bonferroni post hoc compared between-group fitness test performance. A multiple stepwise regression calculated whether recruit characteristics or fitness could predict separation. The GRAD group was younger than the SEPAS group (p < 0.01), faster in the 75PR than the SEPFI group (p = 0.02), and completed more MSFT shuttles than the SEPPR and SEPFI groups (p = 0.01). Age predicted GRAD and SEPAS group inclusion; MSFT predicted GRAD, SEPPR, and SEPFI group inclusion. Recruits who had superior high-intensity running capacity (75PR) and aerobic fitness (MSFT) should have a better chance of completing academy. However, this could be influenced by training practices adopted during academy.",Taxonomical and Phytochemical Characterisation of 10 Stachys Taxa Recorded in the Balkan Peninsula Flora: A Review.,https://www.ncbi.nlm.nih.gov/pubmed/30699897,"Plants (Basel, Switzerland)",2019 03 29,"The genus Stachys is one of the largest genera of the Lamiaceae, and it comprises about 300 species.

Limited resources for monitoring reveal that bicycle travel patterns may constrain such understanding at the network level. This study examined the potential exposure of bicyclists to traffic-related air pollution in El Paso, Texas, using Strava Metro data that revealed bicycle patterns across the city networks. An initial spatial mapping analysis was conducted to explore the spatial patterns of bicycling and traffic pollutant emission, followed by exploratory descriptive statistics. A spatial bicycle model was then developed to explore factors influencing bicycling activity in El Paso. Analysis results indicated significant associations between greater bicycle volume and both higher levels of particulate matter (PM2.5) emissions and more frequent bus services, implying adverse health concerns related to traffic-related air pollution. The results also indicated significant effects of various environmental characteristics (e.g., roadway, bicycle infrastructure, topography, and demographics) on bicycling. The findings encourage extending this study to provide guidance to bicyclists whose regular trips take place on heavily trafficked roads and during rush hours in this region and to evaluate the net health impacts of on-road bicycling for the general population.",Critical Admission Temperature of H₂ and CH₄ in Nanopores of Exchanged ERI Zeolites.,https://www.ncbi.nlm.nih.gov/pubmed/30699895,"Nanomaterials (Basel, Switzerland)",2019 04 01,"Due to the nanoporous nature of zeolitic materials, they can be used as gas adsorbents. This paper describes the effect of critical admission temperature through narrow pores of natural ERI zeolites at low levels of coverage. This phenomenon occurs by adsorption of CH₄ and H₂ on pores in natural erionite. The zeolite was exchanged with aqueous solutions of Na⁺, Mg2+, and Ca2+ salts at different concentrations, times, and temperatures of treatment. Experimental data of CH₄ and H₂ adsorption were treated by the Langmuir equation. Complementarily, the degree of interaction of these gases with these zeolites was evaluated by the evolution of isosteric heats of adsorption. The Ca2+ and Mg2+ cations favor the adsorption phenomena of H₂ and CH₄. These cations occupy sites in strategic positions Ca1, Ca2, and Ca3, which are located in the nanocavities of erionite zeolites and K2 in the center of 8MR. Following the conditions of temperature and the exchange treatment, ERICa2 and ERINa3 samples showed the best behavior for CH₄ and H₂ adsorption.",Genomic Features and Clinical Management of Patients with Hereditary Pancreatic Cancer Syndromes and Familial Pancreatic Cancer.,https://www.ncbi.nlm.nih.gov/pubmed/30699894,International journal of molecular sciences,2019 05 13,"Pancreatic cancer (PC) is one of the most devastating malignancies; it has a 5-year survival rate of only 9%, and novel treatment strategies are urgently needed. While most PC cases occur sporadically, PC associated with hereditary syndromes or familial PC (FPC; defined as an individual having two or more first-degree relatives diagnosed with PC) accounts for about 10% of cases. Hereditary cancer syndromes associated with increased risk for PC include Peutz-Jeghers syndrome, hereditary pancreatitis, familial atypical multiple mole melanoma, familial adenomatous polyposis, Lynch syndrome and hereditary breast and ovarian cancer syndrome. Next-generation sequencing of FPC patients has uncovered new susceptibility genes such as PALB2 and ATM, which participate in homologous recombination repair, and further investigations are in progress. Previous studies have demonstrated that some sporadic cases that do not fulfil FPC criteria also harbor similar mutations, and so genomic testing based on family history might overlook some susceptibility gene carriers. There are no established screening procedures for high-risk unaffected cases, and it is not clear whether surveillance programs would have clinical benefits. In terms of treatment, poly (ADP-ribose) polymerase inhibitors for BRCA-mutated cases or immune checkpoint inhibitors for mismatch repair deficient cases are promising, and clinical trials of these agents are underway.",Syncope in a Working-Age Population: Recurrence Risk and Related Risk Factors.,https://www.ncbi.nlm.nih.gov/pubmed/30699893,Journal of clinical medicine,2019 03 29,"Syncope in a worker undertaking risky tasks may result in fatalities for the individual or for third parties. We aimed at assessing the rate of syncope recurrence and the risk factors underlying the likelihood of syncope relapse in a working-age population. A prospective cohort of all patients aged 18⁻65 years consecutively admitted to the Emergency Department for syncope was enrolled. Risk of syncope relapse was assessed at a six-month, 1-year, and 5-year follow-up. Predictors of syncope recurrence have been evaluated at six months and 1 year from the syncope index by a multivariable logistic regression analysis. 348 patients were enrolled. Risk of syncope relapse was 9.2% at 6 months, 11.8% at 1 year, and 23.4% at 5 years. At 6-month follow-up, predictor of syncope recurrence was ≥3 prior lifetime syncope episodes. At 1-year, ≥3 prior lifetime syncope episodes, diabetes mellitus, and anaemia were risk factors for syncope relapse. There was an exceeding risk of recurrence in the first 6 months and a reduced risk of 3.5% per year after the first year.

This study was designed as an open-labeled, 2-sequence dosage, single- and repeated-dose study investigated under fasting conditions. Plasma concentrations of the parent compounds and their relative acid metabolites were measured and pharmacokinetic parameters were calculated using noncompartmental analysis. Tolerability was assessed based on physical examinations, monitoring of vital signs, clinical laboratory tests, and any observed adverse events. A key finding of this study was that the pharmacokinetics of ECa 233 in healthy volunteers did not correspond with its pharmacokinetics in animal studies. As indicated in human pharmacokinetic parameters, maximum plasma concentration and area under the curve of the parent compounds (madecassoside and asiaticoside) were very low, while their respective metabolites (madecassic acid and asiatic acid) demonstrated higher values. Based on the pharmacokinetic results observed in the dose comparison, accumulation of active metabolites after repeated dose is highly suggestive. In addition, the asiatic acid profile showed 2-fold increase in Cmax and AUC(0-t) after increasing dose from 250 to 500 mg of ECa 233. Lastly, the safety and tolerability evaluation illustrated that single and multiple doses in both 250 and 500 mg oral administration of ECa 233 were well tolerated, and none of the volunteers discontinued their participation due to adverse effects during the study."

Test results of 120 routine plasma samples were also compared with those obtained using two other coagulation analyzers (Instrumentation Laboratory ACL TOP 700 and Stago STA-R MAX). The accuracy, imprecision, and comparability of manual and automatic lyophilized material resuspension were also evaluated using 200 routine plasma samples. Overall, automatic resuspension was found to be more precise than, and equally accurate as, manual reconstitution, with coefficient of variations (CV%) three- to sixfold lower compared with manual reconstitution. The analytical imprecision was found to be excellent, as attested by total CV% of 0.7% for PT, 1.7 to 1.8% for APTT, and 1.9 to 3.2% for fibrinogen. Linearity was excellent over a clinically significant range of PT, APTT, and fibrinogen values, displaying correlation coefficients comprised between 0.994 and 0.999.

Complex interactions take place among the cellular components of the microenvironment of these tumors, and the recognition of the molecular mediators of their interplay and cross-talk is crucial to discover novel therapeutic targets. NET cells overexpress a plethora of proangiogenic molecules including VEGF, PDGF, FGF, semaphorins and angiopoietins, that promote both recruitment and proliferation of endothelial cell precursors, thus resulting among the most vascularized cancers with a microvessel density 10-fold higher then epithelial tumors. Also, NETs operate multi-faceted interactions with stromal cells, both at local and distant sites, and whether their paracrine secretion of serotonin, CTGF and TGF-β primarily drives the fibroblast activation to enhance the tumor proliferation, on the other side NET-derived profibrotic factors accelerate the extracellular matrix remodeling and contribute to heart valves and/or mesenteric fibrosis development, namely major complications of functioning NETs. However, at present little is known on the immune landscape of NETs, but accumulating evidence shows that tumor-infiltrating neutrophils, mast cells and/or macrophages concur to promote the neoangiogenic switch of these tumors by either direct or indirect mechanisms. On the other hand, immune checkpoint molecules are heterogeneously expressed in NETs' surrounding cells, and it is unclear whether or not tumor-infiltrating lymphocytes are anti-tumor armed within the microenvironment, given their low mutational load.

Preliminary research suggests that an MSG-restricted diet confers beneficial effects on somatic symptoms and well-being for some individuals with chronic pain conditions. In addition to associations with somatic distress, glutamate has been associated with the onset and progression of psychiatric symptoms.

Resolving fine electromechanical structure of collagen, however, is challenging, due to its weak piezoresponse, rough topography, and microstructural hierarchy. Here we adopt the newly developed sequential excitation strategy in combination with piezoresponse force microscopy to overcome these difficulties. It excites the local electromechanical response of collagen via a sequence of distinct frequencies, minimizing crosstalk with topography, followed by principal component analysis to remove the background noise and simple harmonic oscillator model for physical analysis and data reconstruction. These enable us to acquire high fidelity mappings of fine electromechanical response at the nanoscale that correlate with the gap and overlap domains of collagen fibrils, which show substantial improvement over conventional piezoresponse force microscopy techniques.

Condensed matter : an Institute of Physics journal,2019 03 13,"The mechanical properties of the uranyl squarate monohydrate material, [Formula: see text], were studied using theoretical solid-state methods based in density functional theory employing plane waves and pseudopotentials. Very demanding calculation parameters were utilized in order to obtain a realistic description of the mechanical behavior of this material. Since the determination of the positions of the hydrogen atoms in the unit cell of uranyl squarate monohydrate was not possible from x-ray diffraction data by structure refinement, they were fully optimized theoretically. The computed lattice parameters, bond distances, angles, and x-ray powder diffraction patterns of this material were in very good agreement with the experimental data. This material was found to be mechanically and dynamically stable since the corresponding stability conditions were satisfied. The values of the bulk modulus and its pressure derivatives, shear and Young moduli, Poisson ratio, ductility, hardness, and mechanical anisotropy indices of this material were reported. Furthermore, this study showed that this material exhibits the important negative Poisson ratio (NPR) and negative linear compressibility (NLC) phenomena. Uranyl squarate monohydrate is a very anisotropic brittle material characterized by a bulk modulus of ~33 GPa, which shows a minimum value of the NPR of the order of  -0.5. Besides, this material displays NLC values for a limited range of positive pressures, from 0.025 GPa to 0.094 GPa, applied along the direction of minimum negative Poisson ratio. The analysis of the crystal structure as a function of pressure demonstrates that the mechanism of NLC of this material is associated to the change in shape of the uranyl pentagonal bipyramids and unrelated to the wine-rack structural mechanism commonly used to rationalize this phenomenon.",Application of infrared thermography in diagnosing peripherally inserted central venous catheter infections in children with cancer.,https://www.ncbi.nlm.nih.gov/pubmed/30699393,Physiological measurement,2019 04 26,"Children affected by oncological diseases are often fitted with central venous catheters (CVCs).

Here, letting the light travel in the two-dimensional plane, we treat the light-driven Dirac systems by using a unitary transformation, instead of usual Floquet theory, to capture the photon-mediated electronic correlation effects. In this approach, the direct electron-photon interaction terms can be removed and the resulting effective electron-electron interactions can produce important effects. The effective interactions can produce topological band structure in the case of irradiated 2D Dirac fermion system, and can lift the energy degeneracy of the Dirac cones for irradiated graphene. This method can be applied to other light-driven Dirac systems to investigate their photon-mediated electronic effects.

To minimize the effects of these loads, active feedback control systems have been proposed but such systems still face numerous challenges which impede their widespread adoption. In order to overcome many of these challenges, inspiration can be drawn from the signal processing and actuating techniques employed by the biological central nervous system to develop a bio-inspired control algorithm. In this study the front-end, signal processing techniques employed by biological sensory systems, and in particular the mammalian auditory system, are drawn upon in order to alleviate computations at the actuation node. This results in a simplistic control law that is a weighted combination of input information about the structure's response such that F   =   WN , where F is the applied control force, W is a pre-determined weighting matrix, and N is a deconstructed representation of the structural response to the applied excitation. There is no empirical solution for deriving an optimal weighting matrix, W , and in this study numerous methods are explored in order to determine values for this matrix that produce the most effective control. These methods include particle swarm optimization, artificial neural networks, and optimal control theory. The various weighting matrices are integrated into the proposed bio-inspired control algorithm and applied in simulation to a five story benchmark structure. These methods are also compared to a traditional linear quadratic regulator (LQR) to gain insight into the overall performance of the bio-inspired control algorithm. Of the three training techniques, the particle swarm optimization technique offers the most effective control which is comparable in performance to the traditional LQR.","On defects' role in enhanced perpendicular magnetic anisotropy in Pt/Co/Pt, induced by ion irradiation.",https://www.ncbi.nlm.nih.gov/pubmed/30699388,Journal of physics. Condensed matter : an Institute of Physics journal,2019 03 13,"Modifications of magnetic and magneto-optical properties of Pt/Co(d Co )/Pt upon Ar+ irradiation (with energy 1.2, 5 and 30 keV) and fluence, F at the range from 2 · 1013-2 · 1016 Ar+ cm-2) were studied. Two 'branches' of increased perpendicular magnetic anisotropy (PMA) and enhanced magneto-optical response are found on 2D (d Co , F) diagrams. The difference in F between 'branches' is driven by ion energy. Structural features correlated with magnetic properties have been analysed thoroughly by x-ray diffraction, Rutherford backscattering spectrometry and positron annihilation spectroscopy. Experimental results are in agreement with TRIDYN numerical calculations of irradiation-induced layers intermixing. Our work discusses particularly structural factors related to crystal lattice defects and strain, created and modified by irradiation, co-responsible for the increase in the PMA.",Modeling of magnetoliposome uptake in human pancreatic tumor cells in vitro.,https://www.ncbi.nlm.nih.gov/pubmed/30699387,Nanotechnology,2019 03 14,"The internalization kinetics resulting from magnetic nanoparticle interactions with tumor cells play an important role in nanoparticle-based cancer treatment efficiency. Here, the uptake kinetics of magnetoliposomes (ML) into human pancreatic tumor cells (MiaPaCa-2 and BxPC-3) are quantified using magnetic particle spectrometry. A comparison to the uptake kinetics for healthy L929 cells is given. The experimental results are used for the development of an uptake kinetics model describing the three relevant internalization processes: ML adsorption to the cell membrane, endo- and exocytosis. By fitting of experimental data, the rate constant of each internalization process is determined enabling the prediction of internalized ML at any incubation time. After seven hours incubation time, MiaPaCa-2 internalized three times more ML than BxPC-3 and L929 cells even though their ML adsorption rate constants were nearly the same. As the interaction of the ML with the cell membrane is non-specific, the uptake kinetics mirror the individual cell response to ML internalization. With a new mathematical term to cover the exocytosis contribution to the overall internalization process, the extended uptake kinetics model offers new possibilities to analyze the specific internalization mechanism for other nanoparticle and cell types.","Hydrodynamics of frontal striking in aquatic snakes: drag, added mass, and the possible consequences for prey capture success.",https://www.ncbi.nlm.nih.gov/pubmed/30699386,Bioinspiration & biomimetics,2019 02 26,"Transient locomotion under water is highly constrained by drag and added mass, yet some aquatic snakes catch their prey using a fast forward acceleration, with the mouth opened. These aquatic snakes show a convergence of their head shape in comparison with closely related species that do not forage under water. As both drag and added mass are related to some extent to the shape of the moving object, we explored how shape impacts the hydrodynamic forces applied to the head of a snake during a prey capture event. We compared two 3D-printed heads representing typical shapes of aquatically-foraging and non-aquatically-foraging snakes, and frontal strike kinematics based on in vivo observations. By using direct force measurements, we calculated the drag and added mass coefficient of the two models. Our results show that both drag and added mass are reduced in aquatic snakes. The drag coefficient of the aquatic model is 0.24, which is almost two times smaller than the non-aquatic model. The added mass coefficient of the aquatic model is 0.15 versus 0.24 for the non-aquatic model, showing that the convergence of head shape in aquatically foraging snakes is associated with a hydrodynamic advantage during frontal striking. The vorticity field measurements with particle image velocimetry show that a less intense recirculation bubble behind the jaw of the aquatic model, compared to the non-aquatic model, might be the basis of this advantage."

This study is aimed to characterize emission and deposition fluxes of respirable particulate matter (PM), and assess exposure of workers to particle-bound polybrominated diphenyl ethers (PBDEs). An electrical low-pressure impactor was used to measure the real-time PM concentrations inside and outside the hood during the WPCBs de-soldering process. The results show that PM mass concentration inside the hood (204 mg/m3) was significantly higher than outside the hood (9.4 mg/m3), representing 95.4% PM removal by the hood. According to the International Commission on Radiological Protection model, the total deposition fluxes of PM in head airways region, tracheobronchial region, and alveolar region were determined as 1930, 74.0, and 123 μg/h, respectively. The deposition flux for coarse particles (2.5-10 μm) in the head airways was the largest (1830 μg/h), accounting for 86.1% of total PM deposited in respiratory system. The ∑8PBDEs concentration in PM10 inside the WPCBs de-soldering workshop was 20,300 pg/m3, and the ∑8PBDEs inhalation exposure for the worker was 1.46 ng/kg/day. This study improves understanding of PM emission mechanisms and provides fundamental data for health assessments during WPCBs de-soldering process.",Water footprint of German agricultural imports: Local impacts due to global trade flows in a fifteen-year perspective.,https://www.ncbi.nlm.nih.gov/pubmed/30699372,The Science of the total environment,2019 03 01,"This study investigates the water scarcity footprint (WSF) trend of German agricultural imports over recent years, following the principles of the ISO 14046 standard on water footprinting. For this purpose, the import statistics of agricultural goods for the years 2000, 2005, 2010, and 2015 was compiled and linked with the irrigation water consumption during their production as well as with the AWARE water scarcity factors of the country of production. Agricultural imports increased by 62% from 22 to 35 million tons during the analysed period. At the same time, the blue water consumption for agricultural production (i.e., irrigation water) decreased by 13% and the WSF declined by 20%, from 119 to 91 km3world-equivalents (world-eq.). The decrease in WSF is caused by drop in the cotton imports, while the WSF associated with the imports of other crops increased by 45%. Product-wise, cotton, nuts, and rice contribute to more than half of the total WSF in all analysed years. Despite their high WSF, these products account for only 3% of the imports by mass confirming the relevance of impact based water footprint assessments. Country-wise, main contributors change along the analysed years. In the year 2000, one-quarter of the WSF occurs in Uzbekistan due to cotton imports. Afterwards, the highest WSF arises in Iran and Spain, while the imports from the US dominate the WSF in 2015. The changing trend follows the pattern of production of the hotspots identified on the product level, e.g. nuts, soybeans, and cotton. This study provides information on the water scarcity impacts that the German consumption creates in other countries and may be useful for decision-making processes aiming at optimising water scarcity footprints.",Preferable phosphate removal by nano-La(III) hydroxides modified mesoporous rice husk biochars: Role of the host pore structure and point of zero charge.,https://www.ncbi.nlm.nih.gov/pubmed/30699371,The Science of the total environment,2019 03 26,"Immobilizing La(OH)3 nanoparticles (NPs) to porous hosts has been widely applied to inhibiting their inherent aggregation as well as the subsequent low utilization efficiency of La. In this study, a series of rice husk biochars (RHBCs) with high mesoporous rates were prepared and the effects of host pore structure and point of zero charge (pHpzc) on phosphate adsorption by La-modified RHBCs was particularly focused. Characterization results confirmed that La(OH)3 NPs were both confined in the pore channel and external surface of RHBCs. Adsorption kinetics and isotherms showed that La-modified RHBCs with higher mesoporous rates of the host showed a faster adsorption rate and La-modified RHBCs exhibited superior La utilization efficiency than many reported La-incorporated adsorbents. Phosphate could be effectively captured over a wide pH of 3-10 due to the high pHpzc of La-modified RHBCs. Moreover, the La-modified RHBCs showed satisfactory affinity towards phosphate in the presence of coexisting anions and the phosphate adsorption by La-RHBC9 was enhanced in the presence of Ca2+, while it was inhibited in the presence of Mg2+. The mesoporous structure of RHBCs strengthened the stability of La-modified RHBCs and weakened the inhibition of coexisting humic substances on phosphate adsorption through the ""shielding effect"".",Bioremediation of petroleum-contaminated soil enhanced by aged refuse.,https://www.ncbi.nlm.nih.gov/pubmed/30699370,Chemosphere,2019 04 03,"In this study, the effect of aged refuse on biodegradation of total petroleum hydrocarbons (TPH), microbial counts, soil ecotoxicity, dehydrogenase activity and microbial community compositions were investigated in solid phase reactors during a 30-week period. The results demonstrate that the removal efficiency of TPH was significantly higher in the soil supplemented with aged refuse than in the soil without aged refuse. After 30 weeks, the removal efficiencies of TPH in soils were 29.3%, 82.1%, 63.7% and 90.2% in the cases of natural attenuation, nutrient addition (with NH4NO3 and K2HPO4), supplement with 20% (w/w, dry weight basis) of aged refuse and the combination of nutrient and aged refuse. Nutrient plus aged refuse made the TPH concentration decrease to below the threshold level of commercial use required for Chinese soil quality for TPH (<3000 mg/kg) in 30 weeks. It was also found that dehydrogenase activity, bacterial counts and degrader abundance in the soil were remarkably enhanced by the addition of aged refuse (20%,w/w). Total organic carbon analysis demonstrates that large amounts of hydrocarbon intermediates occurred in the soil after bioremediation.",Silicate coating to prevent leaching from radiolabeled surrogate far-field fallout in aqueous environments.,https://www.ncbi.nlm.nih.gov/pubmed/30699369,Chemosphere,2019 04 03,"Recent characterization of radioactive particles indicate that a large percentage of the radioactivity observed during the Fukushima Daiichi nuclear meltdown was insoluble 137Cs bound within silica microparticles. Therefore, much of the decontamination research performed prior to the Fukushima incident that used either soluble radionuclides deposited onto wet surfaces or large (∼100 μm) particles characteristic of nuclear weapons fallout do not accurately represent the characteristics of potential contamination. Thus, the common practice of extrapolating radioactive decontamination methods generically to all radioactive release events is, at best, suspect. In response, a method to produce chemically-inert, radiolabeled silica particles was developed. Binding 152Eu within a sodium silicate coating required proper temperature control and ethanol was beneficial as a volatile dispersant to limit residues. In the end, a step-wise method, which first deposited 152Eu or 241Am as a nitrate salt, decomposed the salt to a sesquioxide, and finally coated the surface with sodium silicate led to dispersed particles of the desired 2 or 0.5 μm diameters. Dynamic light scattering and scanning election microscopy confirmed the particle size was unchanged. Leaching studies into several common decontaminants were performed to ensure particle inertness. Our approach allows for substitution of other radionuclides making it a robust, simple, and novel method to produce inert particle surrogates for a release event that allows direct comparison of decontamination techniques and contaminant fate studies, greatly aiding the development of response and recovery plans.",Surfactant-free solid dispersion of BCS class IV drug in an amorphous chitosan oligosaccharide matrix for concomitant dissolution in vitro - permeability increase.,https://www.ncbi.nlm.nih.gov/pubmed/30699368,European journal of pharmaceutical sciences : official journal of the European Federation for Pharmaceutical Sciences,2019 02 20,"Saccharides have been applied as a water-soluble matrix for dispersing hydrophobic drugs homogeneously without the need to use surfactants in amorphous solid dispersions (ASD). Up to now, concomitant permeability improvement of BCS Class IV drug by such matrices have not been much appreciated. Herein, an amorphous chitosan oligosaccharide (COS) was used as matrix to prepare surfactant-free ASD of BCS class IV drug by the ball milling method, with curcumin (CUR) as a model drug. The DSC, XRPD, FTIR and physical stability experiments indicated that CUR was in an amorphous state with high physical stability and exhibited potential interactions with COS in the ASD. Non-sink dissolution in vitro studies showed the maximum dissolution concentration of all CUR-COS ASD (CUR and COS at weight ratios of 1:1, 1:2 and 1:4) reached ranging from 97.85 to 101.21 μg/mL, far above that of pure CUR. The supersaturated concentration remained for at least 24 h under non-sink condition. Caco-2 cell model revealed that, compared to the pure CUR group, the apparent permeability coefficients were increased by 1.72-4.44-fold in all three CUR-COS ASD, which was mainly attributed to opening the tight junctions of Caco-2 cells by COS. The pharmacokinetic study showed that all CUR-COS ASD groups exhibited significant enhancements in AUC0-∞, with 1.55-3.01-fold that of pure CUR (p < 0.01). Tmax of CUR was shortened after oral administration of all three ASD. The current study demonstrates the amorphous COS could be used as a promising matrix in ASD for enhancing the oral bioavailability of BCS class IV drug by improving dissolution behavior and membrane permeability.",Effects of Neddylation and mTOR Inhibition in Acute Myelogenous Leukemia.,https://www.ncbi.nlm.nih.gov/pubmed/30699367,Translational oncology,2019 03 16,"Acute myelogenous leukemia (AML) is a heterogeneous disease and often relapses after standard chemotherapy. Recently, the neddylation (NEDD8) and the mammalian target of rapamycin (mTOR) signaling pathways have emerged as promising pharmaceutical targets for AML therapy. However, the interaction of these two pathways remains unclear. Here we evaluated the effects of pevonedistat, an inhibitor of the NEDD8 activating enzyme (NAE), and sapanisertib (TAK-228), an inhibitor of mTORC1 and mTORC2 as single agents or in combination on AML cell lines. We found that inhibition of neddylation with pevonedistat partially inhibited mTOR signaling transduction and vice versa, inhibition of mTOR signaling with sapanisertib partially inhibited neddylation in AML cell lines. Pevonedistat alone was able to induce cytotoxicity in most AML cell lines as well as in primary AML, whereas sapanisertib alone decreased cell metabolic activity, reduced cell size and arrested cells in G0 phase with only minimal induction of cell death. In addition, pevonedistat was able to induce cell differentiation, arrest cells in G2/M cell cycle phases, and induce DNA re-replication and damage. However, co-treatment with sapanisertib suppressed pevonedistat induced apoptosis, differentiation, S/G2/M arrest, and DNA damage. Taken together, our data demonstrate that pevonedistat and sapanisertib exhibit distinct anti-tumor effects on AML cells, i.e. cytotoxic and cytostatic effects, respectively; however, sapanisertib can attenuate pevonedistat-induced cellular responses in AML cells. Understanding mTOR and neddylation pathway interaction could provide therapeutic strategies for treatment of AML and other malignancies.",Heat shock protein B1 is a key mediator of prolactin-induced beta-cell cytoprotection against oxidative stress.,https://www.ncbi.nlm.nih.gov/pubmed/30699366,Free radical biology & medicine,2019 04 08,"Maintaining islet cell viability in vitro, although challenging, appears to be a strategy for improving the outcome of pancreatic islet transplantation. We have shown that prolactin (PRL) leads to beta-cell cytoprotection against apoptosis, an effect mediated by heat shock protein B1 (HSPB1). Since the role of HSPB1 in beta-cells is still unclear and the hormone concentration used is not compatible with clinical applications because of all the side effects displayed by the hormone in other tissues, we explored the molecular mechanisms by which HSPB1 mediates beta-cell cytoprotection. Lysates from PRL- and/or cytokine-treated MIN6 beta-cells were subjected to HSPB1 immunoprecipitation followed by identification through mass spectrometry. PRL-treated cells presented an enrichment of several proteins co-precipitating with HSPB1. Of note were oxidative stress resistance-, protein degradation- and carbohydrate metabolism-related proteins. Wild type, HSPB1 silenced or overexpressing MIN6 cells were exposed to menadione and hydrogen peroxide and analysed for several oxidative stress parameters. HSPB1 knockdown rendered cells more sensitive to oxidative stress and led to a reduced antioxidant capacity, while prolactin induced an HSPB1-mediated cytoprotection against oxidative stress. HSPB1 overexpression, however, led to opposite effects. PRL treatment, HSPB1 silencing or overexpression did not change the expression nor activities of antioxidant enzymes, it also did not lead to a modulation of total glutathione levels nor G6PD expression. However, HSPB1 levels are related to a modulation of GSH/GSSG ratio, G6PD activity and NADPH/NADP + ratio. We have shown that HSPB1 is important for pro-survival effects against oxidative stress-induced beta-cell death. These results are in accordance with PRL-induced enrichment of HSPB1-interacting proteins related to protection against oxidative stress. Finally, our results outline the need of further studies investigating the importance of HSPB1 for beta-cell viability, since this could lead to the mitigation of beta-cell death through the up-regulation of an endogenous protective pathway.",Hot-melt extrusion process impact on polymer choice of glyburide solid dispersions: The effect of wettability and dissolution.,https://www.ncbi.nlm.nih.gov/pubmed/30699365,International journal of pharmaceutics,2019 06 13,"The aim of this study was to evaluate the choice of polymer and polymer level on the performance of the microstructure and wettability of hot-melt extruded solid dispersion of Glyburide (Gly) as a model drug. The produced solid dispersion were characterised using scanning electron microscopy (SEM), image analysis using a focus variation instrument (FVI), differential scanning calorimetry (DSC), X-ray powder diffraction (XRPD), X-ray microtomography (XµT), dynamic contact angle measurement and dissolution analysis using biorelevant dissolution media (FASSIF). SEM and focus variation analysis showed that the microstructure and surface morphology was significantly different between samples produced. This was confirmed by further analysis using XµT which showed that an increase in polymer content brought about a decrease in the porosity of the hot-melt extruded dispersions. DSC suggested complete amorphorisation of Gly whereas XRPD suggested incomplete amorphorisation. The static and dynamic contact angle measurement correlated with the dissolution studies using FASSIF media indicating that the initial liquid imbibition process as captured by the dynamic contact angle directly affects the dissolution performance.",Saporin-loaded CD44 and EGFR dual-targeted nanogels for potent inhibition of metastatic breast cancer in vivo.,https://www.ncbi.nlm.nih.gov/pubmed/30699364,International journal of pharmaceutics,2019 06 13,"Metastasis poses a long-standing treatment challenge for many cancers including breast cancer. Once spreading out, cell-selective delivery of drug appears especially critical. Here, we report on epidermal growth factor receptor and CD44 dual-targeted hyaluronic acid nanogels (EGFR/CD44-NGs) that afford enhanced targetability and protein therapy for metastatic 4T1 breast cancer in vivo. Flow cytometry in CD44 and EGFR-positive 4T1 metastatic breast cancer cells showed over 6-fold higher cellular uptake of EGFR/CD44-NGs than mono-targeting CD44-NGs. MTT and scratch assays displayed that saporin-loaded EGFR/CD44-NGs (Sap-EGFR/CD44-NGs) was highly potent in inhibiting growth as well as migration of 4T1 cells in vitro, with an IC50 of 5.36 nM, which was 1.7-fold lower than that for Sap-CD44-NGs. In 4T1-luc metastatic breast cancer model in mice, Sap-EGFR/CD44-NGs exhibited significant inhibition of tumor metastasis to lung at a small dose of 3.33 nmol Sap equiv./kg. Increasing the dosage to 13.3 nmol Sap equiv./kg resulted in further reduced lung metastasis without causing notable adverse effects. These dual-targeted nanogels with improved cancer cell selectivity provide a novel platform for combating breast cancer metastasis."

To overcome the risk of insertional mutagenesis, integrase-deficient lentiviral vectors (IDLVs) have been developed. We show here that strong and persistent specific cytotoxic T cell (CTL) responses are induced by IDLVs, which persist several months after a single injection. These responses were associated with the induction of mild and transient maturation of dendritic cells (DCs) and with the production of low levels of inflammatory cytokines and chemokines. They were independent of the IFN-I, TLR/MyD88, interferon regulatory factor (IRF), retinoic acid induced gene I (RIG-I), and stimulator of interferon genes (STING) pathways but require NF-κB signaling in CD11c+ DCs. Despite the lack of integration of IDLVs, the transgene persists for 3 months in the spleen and liver of IDLV-injected mice. These results demonstrate that the capacity of IDLVs to trigger persistent adaptive responses is mediated by a weak and transient innate response, along with the persistence of the vector in tissues.",Endothelial Calcineurin Signaling Restrains Metastatic Outgrowth by Regulating Bmp2.,https://www.ncbi.nlm.nih.gov/pubmed/30699351,Cell reports,2019 01 30,"Calcineurin/NFAT signaling is active in endothelial cells and is proposed to be an essential component of the tumor angiogenic response. Here, we investigated the role of endothelial calcineurin signaling in vivo in physiological and pathological angiogenesis and tumor metastasis. We show that this pathway is dispensable for retinal and tumor angiogenesis, but it is implicated in vessel stabilization. While ablation of endothelial calcineurin does not affect the progression of primary tumors or tumor cell extravasation, it does potentiate the outgrowth of lung metastases. We identify Bmp2 as a downstream target of the calcineurin/NFAT pathway in lung endothelium, potently inhibiting cancer cell growth by stimulating differentiation. We reveal a dual role of calcineurin/NFAT signaling in vascular regression or stabilization and in the tissue-specific production of an angiocrine factor restraining cancer cell outgrowth. Our results suggest that, besides targeting the immune system, post-transplantation immunosuppressive therapy with calcineurin inhibitors directly targets the endothelium, contributing to aggressive cancer progression.",ELKS/Voltage-Dependent Ca2+ Channel-β Subunit Module Regulates Polarized Ca2+ Influx in Pancreatic β Cells.,https://www.ncbi.nlm.nih.gov/pubmed/30699350,Cell reports,2019 01 30,"Pancreatic β cells secrete insulin by Ca2+-triggered exocytosis. However, there is no apparent secretory site similar to the neuronal active zones, and the cellular and molecular localization mechanism underlying polarized exocytosis remains elusive. Here, we report that ELKS, a vertebrate active zone protein, is used in β cells to regulate Ca2+ influx for insulin secretion. β cell-specific ELKS-knockout (KO) mice showed impaired glucose-stimulated first-phase insulin secretion and reduced L-type voltage-dependent Ca2+ channel (VDCC) current density. In situ Ca2+ imaging of β cells within islets expressing a membrane-bound G-CaMP8b Ca2+ sensor demonstrated initial local Ca2+ signals at the ELKS-localized vascular side of the β cell plasma membrane, which were markedly decreased in ELKS-KO β cells. Mechanistically, ELKS directly interacted with the VDCC-β subunit via the GK domain. These findings suggest that ELKS and VDCCs form a potent insulin secretion complex at the vascular side of the β cell plasma membrane for polarized Ca2+ influx and first-phase insulin secretion from pancreatic islets.",Metabolic and Organelle Morphology Defects in Mice and Human Patients Define Spinocerebellar Ataxia Type 7 as a Mitochondrial Disease.,https://www.ncbi.nlm.nih.gov/pubmed/30699348,Cell reports,2019 03 29,"Spinocerebellar ataxia type 7 (SCA7) is a retinal-cerebellar degenerative disorder caused by CAG-polyglutamine (polyQ) repeat expansions in the ataxin-7 gene. As many SCA7 clinical phenotypes occur in mitochondrial disorders, and magnetic resonance spectroscopy of patients revealed altered energy metabolism, we considered a role for mitochondrial dysfunction. Studies of SCA7 mice uncovered marked impairments in oxygen consumption and respiratory exchange. When we examined cerebellar Purkinje cells in mice, we observed mitochondrial network abnormalities, with enlarged mitochondria upon ultrastructural analysis. We developed stem cell models from patients and created stem cell knockout rescue systems, documenting mitochondrial morphology defects, impaired oxidative metabolism, and reduced expression of nicotinamide adenine dinucleotide (NAD+) production enzymes in SCA7 models. We observed NAD+ reductions in mitochondria of SCA7 patient NPCs using ratiometric fluorescent sensors and documented alterations in tryptophan-kynurenine metabolism in patients. Our results indicate that mitochondrial dysfunction, stemming from decreased NAD+, is a defining feature of SCA7.",Enhancer Histone Acetylation Modulates Transcriptional Bursting Dynamics of Neuronal Activity-Inducible Genes.,https://www.ncbi.nlm.nih.gov/pubmed/30699347,Cell reports,2019 02 19,"Neuronal activity-inducible gene transcription correlates with rapid and transient increases in histone acetylation at promoters and enhancers of activity-regulated genes. Exactly how histone acetylation modulates transcription of these genes has remained unknown. We used single-cell in situ transcriptional analysis to show that Fos and Npas4 are transcribed in stochastic bursts in mouse neurons and that membrane depolarization increases mRNA expression by increasing burst frequency. We then expressed dCas9-p300 or dCas9-HDAC8 fusion proteins to mimic or block activity-induced histone acetylation locally at enhancers. Adding histone acetylation increased Fos transcription by prolonging burst duration and resulted in higher Fos protein levels and an elevation of resting membrane potential. Inhibiting histone acetylation reduced Fos transcription by reducing burst frequency and impaired experience-dependent Fos protein induction in the hippocampus in vivo. Thus, activity-inducible histone acetylation tunes the transcriptional dynamics of experience-regulated genes to affect selective changes in neuronal gene expression and cellular function.",Mafb and c-Maf Have Prenatal Compensatory and Postnatal Antagonistic Roles in Cortical Interneuron Fate and Function.,https://www.ncbi.nlm.nih.gov/pubmed/30699346,Cell reports,2019 04 19,"Mafb and c-Maf transcription factor (TF) expression is enriched in medial ganglionic eminence (MGE) lineages, beginning in late-secondary progenitors and continuing into mature parvalbumin (PV+) and somatostatin (SST+) interneurons.

Analyses of Maf mutant mice revealed redundant functions of Mafb and c-Maf in secondary MGE progenitors, where they repress the generation of SST+ cortical and hippocampal interneurons. By contrast, Mafb and c-Maf have distinct roles in postnatal cortical interneuron (CIN) morphological maturation, synaptogenesis, and cortical circuit integration.

Here, we show that MAP4K4, a MAP kinase family member, regulates MN death, with its suppression not only promoting survival but preventing neurite degeneration and decreasing mutant SOD1 levels through autophagy activation. Moreover, we report that MAP4K4 signaling specifically modulates MN viability via phosphorylated JNK3 and activation of the canonical c-Jun apoptotic pathway. Finally, we show the feasibility of MAP4K4 as a drug target by using an available MAP4K4-specific inhibitor, which improves survival of ESC and/or iPSC-derived MNs and MNs cultured from mouse spinal cords. In summary, our studies highlight a MAP4K4-initiated signaling cascade that induces MN degeneration, shedding light on the mechanism underlying MN degeneration and providing a druggable target for ALS therapeutics.",Dorsal Raphe Dual Serotonin-Glutamate Neurons Drive Reward by Establishing Excitatory Synapses on VTA Mesoaccumbens Dopamine Neurons.,https://www.ncbi.nlm.nih.gov/pubmed/30699344,Cell reports,2019 05 01,"Dorsal raphe (DR) serotonin neurons provide a major input to the ventral tegmental area (VTA). Here, we show that DR serotonin transporter (SERT) neurons establish both asymmetric and symmetric synapses on VTA dopamine neurons, but most of these synapses are asymmetric. Moreover, the DR-SERT terminals making asymmetric synapses on VTA dopamine neurons coexpress vesicular glutamate transporter 3 (VGluT3; transporter for accumulation of glutamate for its synaptic release), suggesting the excitatory nature of these synapses. VTA photoactivation of DR-SERT fibers promotes conditioned place preference, elicits excitatory currents on mesoaccumbens dopamine neurons, increases their firing, and evokes dopamine release in nucleus accumbens. These effects are blocked by VTA inactivation of glutamate and serotonin receptors, supporting the idea of glutamate release in VTA from dual DR SERT-VGluT3 inputs. Our findings suggest a path-specific input from DR serotonergic neurons to VTA that promotes reward by the release of glutamate and activation of mesoaccumbens dopamine neurons.",REST and Neural Gene Network Dysregulation in iPSC Models of Alzheimer's Disease.,https://www.ncbi.nlm.nih.gov/pubmed/30699343,Cell reports,2019 06 10,"The molecular basis of the earliest neuronal changes that lead to Alzheimer's disease (AD) is unclear. Here, we analyze neural cells derived from sporadic AD (SAD), APOE4 gene-edited and control induced pluripotent stem cells (iPSCs). We observe major differences in iPSC-derived neural progenitor (NP) cells and neurons in gene networks related to neuronal differentiation, neurogenesis, and synaptic transmission. The iPSC-derived neural cells from SAD patients exhibit accelerated neural differentiation and reduced progenitor cell renewal. Moreover, a similar phenotype appears in NP cells and cerebral organoids derived from APOE4 iPSCs. Impaired function of the transcriptional repressor REST is strongly implicated in the altered transcriptome and differentiation state. SAD and APOE4 expression result in reduced REST nuclear translocation and chromatin binding, and disruption of the nuclear lamina. Thus, dysregulation of neural gene networks may set in motion the pathologic cascade that leads to AD.",A 20-Gene Set Predictive of Progression to Severe Dengue.,https://www.ncbi.nlm.nih.gov/pubmed/30699342,Cell reports,2019 04 23,"There is a need to identify biomarkers predictive of severe dengue. Single-cohort transcriptomics has not yielded generalizable results or parsimonious, predictive gene sets. We analyzed blood samples of dengue patients from seven gene expression datasets (446 samples, five countries) using an integrated multi-cohort analysis framework and identified a 20-gene set that predicts progression to severe dengue. We validated the predictive power of this 20-gene set in three retrospective dengue datasets (84 samples, three countries) and a prospective Colombia cohort (34 patients), with an area under the receiver operating characteristic curve of 0.89, 100% sensitivity, and 76% specificity. The 20-gene dengue severity scores declined during the disease course, suggesting an infection-triggered host response. This 20-gene set is strongly associated with the progression to severe dengue and represents a predictive signature, generalizable across ages, host genetic factors, and virus strains, with potential implications for the development of a host response-based dengue prognostic assay."

However, recent adaptations of the light-dark preference test for zebrafish have produced inconsistent results. Several studies have reported that zebrafish exhibit a preference for light, while others have found a preference for black. We suggest the inconsistencies may be the result of confusing certain parameters of the test leading to improper interpretation. For example, researchers often use ""light"" interchangeably with ""white"" and ""dark"" with ""black"" when these are two distinct factors: level of illumination vs. background shade. In the current study, we use specifically designed preference tanks to investigate the influence of background shade (i.e. white vs. black) and level of illumination (i.e. light vs. dark) on preference and anxiety-like behaviour. Furthermore, we pharmacologically validate our results by quantifying the effects of ethanol, a drug with known anxiety-altering properties, on anxiety-like behaviours. Here we report that zebrafish's preference varies depending upon background shade and level of illumination. We also found that ethanol administration altered behavioural responses in an illumination- and background shade-dependent manner. Our findings reinforce the need to correctly differentiate between these factors when interpreting results obtained with this behavioural paradigm. Lastly, our results show that simple modifications to the experimental tank in which anxiety-related responses are measured can significantly alter behaviour of zebrafish, supporting the need for standardized testing procedures and/or for detailed description of experimental procedures and the apparatus.",Mining the Nav1.7 interactome: Opportunities for chronic pain therapeutics.,https://www.ncbi.nlm.nih.gov/pubmed/30699328,Biochemical pharmacology,2019 04 19,"The peripherally expressed voltage-gated sodium NaV1.7 (gene SCN9A) channel boosts small stimuli to initiate firing of pain-signaling dorsal root ganglia (DRG) neurons and facilitates neurotransmitter release at the first synapse within the spinal cord. Mutations in SCN9A produce distinct human pain syndromes. Widely acknowledged as a ""gatekeeper"" of pain, NaV1.7 has been the focus of intense investigation but, to date, no NaV1.7-selective drugs have reached the clinic. Elegant crystallographic studies have demonstrated the potential of designing highly potent and selective NaV1.7 compounds but their therapeutic value remains untested. Transcriptional silencing of NaV1.7 by a naturally expressed antisense transcript has been reported in rodents and humans but whether this represents a viable opportunity for designing NaV1.7 therapeutics is currently unknown. The demonstration that loss of NaV1.7 function is associated with upregulation of endogenous opioids and potentiation of mu- and delta-opioid receptor activities, suggests that targeting only NaV1.7 may be insufficient for analgesia. However, the link between opioid-dependent analgesic mechanisms and function of sodium channels and intracellular sodium-dependent signaling remains controversial. Thus, additional new targets - regulators, modulators - are needed. In this context, we mine the literature for the known interactome of NaV1.7 with a focus on protein interactors that affect the channel's trafficking or link it to opioid signaling. As a case study, we present antinociceptive evidence of allosteric regulation of NaV1.7 by the cytosolic collapsin response mediator protein 2 (CRMP2). Throughout discussions of these possible new targets, we offer thoughts on the therapeutic implications of modulating NaV1.7 function in chronic pain.",Broad cross-reactivity of the T-cell repertoire achieves specific and sufficiently rapid target searching.,https://www.ncbi.nlm.nih.gov/pubmed/30699327,Journal of theoretical biology,2019 02 16,"The molecular recognition of T-cell receptors is the hallmark of the adaptive immunity. Given the finiteness of the T-cell repertoire, individual T-cell receptors are necessary to be cross-reactive to multiple antigenic peptides. In this study, we quantify the variability of the cross-reactivity by using a string model that estimates the binding affinity between two sequences of amino acids. We examine sequences of 10,000 human T-cell receptors and 10,000 antigenic peptides, and obtain a full spectrum of cross-reactivity of the receptor-peptide binding. Then, we find that the cross-reactivity spectrum is broad. Some T-cells are reactive to 1000 peptides, but some T-cells are reactive to only one or two peptides. Since the degree of cross-reactivity has a correlation with the (un)binding affinity of receptors, we further investigate how the broad cross-reactivity affects the target searching of T-cells. High cross-reactive T-cells may not require many trials for searching correct targets, but they may spend long time to unbind from incorrect targets. In contrast, low cross-reactive T-cells may not spend long time to ignore incorrect targets, but they require many trials for screening correct targets. We evaluate this hypothesis, and show that the broad cross-reactivity of the natural T-cell repertoire can balance the trade-off between the rapid screening and unbinding penalty.","New Neuroscience of Homeostasis and Drives for Food, Water, and Salt.",https://www.ncbi.nlm.nih.gov/pubmed/30699320,The New England journal of medicine,2019 02 15,"Well-being requires the maintenance of energy stores, water, and sodium within permissive zones. The brain, as ringleader, orchestrates their homeostatic control. It senses disturbances, decides what needs to be done next, and then restores balance by altering physiological processes and ingestive drives (i.e., hunger, thirst, and salt appetite). But how the brain orchestrates this control has been unknown until recently — largely because we have lacked the ability to elucidate and then probe the underlying neuronal “wiring diagrams.” This has changed with the advent of new, transformative neuroscientific tools. When targeted to specific neurons, these tools make it possible to selectively map a neuron’s connections, measure its responses to various homeostatic challenges, and experimentally manipulate its activity. This review examines these approaches and then highlights how they are advancing, and in some cases profoundly changing, our understanding of energy, water, and salt homeostasis and the linked ingestive drives.",Oral versus Intravenous Antibiotics for Bone and Joint Infection.,https://www.ncbi.nlm.nih.gov/pubmed/30699315,The New England journal of medicine,2019 06 10,The management of complex orthopedic infections usually includes a prolonged course of intravenous antibiotic agents.

The functional ecology of two key taxa from the P. trichocarpa rhizobiome, M. elongata PMI93 and I. europaea PMI82, was studied by coupling forest soil bioassays with environmental metatranscriptomics. Using soil bioassay experiments amended with fungal inoculants, M. elongata was observed to promote the growth of P. trichocarpa. This response was cultivar independent. In contrast, I. europaea had no visible effect on P. trichocarpa growth. Metatranscriptomic studies revealed that these fungi impacted rhizophytic and endophytic activities in P. trichocarpa and induced shifts in soil and root microbial communities. Differential expression of core genes in P. trichocarpa roots was observed in response to both fungal species. Expression of P. trichocarpa genes for lipid signaling and nutrient uptake were upregulated, and expression of genes associated with gibberellin signaling were altered in plants inoculated with M. elongata, but not I. europaea. Upregulation of genes for growth promotion, downregulation of genes for several leucine-rich repeat receptor kinases, and alteration of expression of genes associated with plant defense responses (e.g., jasmonic acid, salicylic acid, and ethylene signal pathways) also suggest that M. elongata manipulates plant defenses while promoting plant growth.",The AC4 Protein of a Cassava Geminivirus Is Required for Virus Infection.,https://www.ncbi.nlm.nih.gov/pubmed/30699305,Molecular plant-microbe interactions : MPMI,2019 05 23,"Geminiviruses (family Geminiviridae) are among the most devastating plant viruses worldwide, causing severe damage in crops of economic and subsistence importance. These viruses have very compact genomes and many of the encoded proteins are multifunctional. Here, we investigated the role of the East African cassava mosaic Cameroon virus (EACMCV) AC4 on virus infectivity in Nicotiana benthamiana. Results showed that plants inoculated with EACMCV containing a knockout mutation in an AC4 open reading frame displayed symptoms 2 to 3 days later than plants inoculated with wild-type virus, and these plants recovered from infection, whereas plants inoculated with the wild-type virus did not. Curiously, when an additional mutation was made in the knockout mutant, the resulting double mutant virus completely failed to cause any apparent symptoms. Interestingly, the role of AC4 on virus infectivity appeared to be dependent on an encoded N-myristoylation motif that mediates cell membrane binding. We previously showed that EACMCV containing the AC4T38I mutant produced virus progeny characterized by second-site mutations and reversion to wild-type virus. These results were confirmed in this study using additional mutations. Together, these results show involvement of EACMCV AC4 in virus infectivity; they also suggest a role for the combined action of mutation and selection, under prevailing environmental conditions, on begomovirus genetic variation and diversity.","A Novel Measure to Assess Variation in Hepatitis C Prevalence Among Homeless and Unstably Housed Veterans, 2011-2016.",https://www.ncbi.nlm.nih.gov/pubmed/30699304,"Public health reports (Washington, D.C. : 1974)",2019 05 28,"We constructed a novel measure of homelessness to examine differences in hepatitis C virus (HCV) prevalence across 3 categories of unstably housed and homeless veterans and across US Department of Veterans Affairs Medical Center facilities.

Based on the multiple weak H-bonds and synergistic effects between the three components, the as-prepared hybrid hydrogel exhibits ultrastretchability with high elasticity, good self-healing, excellent conformability, and high self-adhesiveness to diverse substrates both in air and underwater. More importantly, the ternary hydrogel exhibits high strain sensitivity especially under subtle strains with a gauge factor of 2.0, which is close to the theoretical value of the ionic hydrogel sensors; an extremely large workable range of strain (0.05-2100%); and a low operating voltage 0.07 V. Consequently, the sensor demonstrates superior sensing performance for real-time monitoring of the large and subtle human motions, including limb motions, swallowing, smiling, and wrist pulse. Therefore, it is believed that the STP hydrogel has great potential applications in health monitoring, smart wearable devices, and soft robots.","Crystal Structure of d-Ornithine/d-Lysine Decarboxylase, a Stereoinverting Decarboxylase: Implications for Substrate Specificity and Stereospecificity of Fold III Decarboxylases.",https://www.ncbi.nlm.nih.gov/pubmed/30699288,Biochemistry,2019 02 26,"A newly discovered Fold III pyridoxal 5'-phosphate (PLP)-dependent decarboxylase, d-ornithine/lysine decarboxylase (DOKDC), catalyzes decarboxylation of d-lysine and d-ornithine with inversion of stereochemistry. The X-ray crystal structure of DOKDC has been determined to 1.72 Å. DOKDC has a low level of sequence identity (<30%) with meso-diaminopimelate decarboxylase (DAPDC) and l-lysine/ornithine decarboxylase (LODC), but its three-dimensional structure is very similar. The distal binding site of DAPDC contains a conserved arginine that forms an ion pair with the l-carboxylate end of DAP. In both LODC and DOKDC, this distal site is modified by replacement of the arginine with aspartate, changing the substrate specificity. l-Ornithine decarboxylase (ODC) and LODC have a conserved phenylalanine on the re-face of the PLP complex that has been found to play a key role in the decarboxylation mechanism. We have found that both DAPDC and DOKDC have tyrosine instead of phenylalanine at this position, which precludes the binding of l-amino acids. Because the PLP-binding lysine in ODC, LODC, DAPDC, and DOKDC is located on the re-face of the PLP, we propose that this is the acid group responsible for protonation of the product, thus resulting in the observed retention of configuration for decarboxylation of l-amino acids and inversion for decarboxylation of d-amino acids. The reactions of DAPDC and DOKDC are likely accelerated by positive electrostatics on the re-face by the lysine ε-ammonium ion and on the si-face by closure of the lid over the active site, resulting in desolvation and destabilization of the d-amino acid carboxylate.",Novel Discovery of LINE-1 in a Korean Individual by a Target Enrichment Method.,https://www.ncbi.nlm.nih.gov/pubmed/30699287,Molecules and cells,2019 03 26,"Long interspersed element-1 (LINE-1 or L1) is an autonomous retrotransposon, which is capable of inserting into a new region of genome. Previous studies have reported that these elements lead to genomic variations and altered functions by affecting gene expression and genetic networks. Mounting evidence strongly indicates that genetic diseases or various cancers can occur as a result of retrotransposition events that involve L1s. Therefore, the development of methodologies to study the structural variations and interpersonal insertion polymorphisms by L1 element-associated changes in an individual genome is invaluable. In this study, we applied a systematic approach to identify human-specific L1s (i.e., L1Hs) through the bioinformatics analysis of high-throughput next-generation sequencing data. We identified 525 candidates that could be inferred to carry non-reference L1Hs in a Korean individual genome (KPGP9). Among them, we randomly selected 40 candidates and validated that approximately 92.5% of non-reference L1Hs were inserted into a KPGP9 genome. In addition, unlike conventional methods, our relatively simple and expedited approach was highly reproducible in confirming the L1 insertions. Taken together, our findings strongly support that the identification of non-reference L1Hs by our novel target enrichment method demonstrates its future application to genomic variation studies on the risk of cancer and genetic disorders.",Mutation Hotspots in the β-Catenin Gene: Lessons from the Human Cancer Genome Databases.,https://www.ncbi.nlm.nih.gov/pubmed/30699286,Molecules and cells,2019 03 26,"Mutations in the β-catenin gene (CTNNB1) have been implicated in the pathogenesis of some cancers. The recent development of cancer genome databases has facilitated comprehensive and focused analyses on the mutation status of cancer-related genes. We have used these databases to analyze the CTNNB1 mutations assembled from different tumor types. High incidences of CTNNB1 mutations were detected in endometrial, liver, and colorectal cancers. This finding agrees with the oncogenic role of aberrantly activated β-catenin in epithelial cells. Elevated frequencies of missense mutations were found in the exon 3 of CTNNB1, which is responsible for encoding the regulatory amino acids at the N-terminal region of the protein. In the case of metastatic colorectal cancers, inframe deletions were revealed in the region spanning exon 3. Thus, exon 3 of CTNNB1 can be considered to be a mutation hotspot in these cancers. Since the N-terminal region of the β-catenin protein forms a flexible structure, many questions arise regarding the structural and functional impacts of hotspot mutations. Clinical identification of hotspot mutations could provide the mechanistic basis for an oncogenic role of mutant β-catenin proteins in cancer cells. Furthermore, a systematic understanding of tumor-driving hotspot mutations could open new avenues for precision oncology.",Anti-Inflammatory Role of TAM Family of Receptor Tyrosine Kinases Via Modulating Macrophage Function.,https://www.ncbi.nlm.nih.gov/pubmed/30699285,Molecules and cells,2019 03 26,"Macrophage is an important innate immune cell that not only initiates inflammatory responses, but also functions in tissue repair and anti-inflammatory responses. Regulating macrophage activity is thus critical to maintain immune homeostasis. Tyro3, Axl, and Mer are integral membrane proteins that constitute TAM family of receptor tyrosine kinases (RTKs). Growing evidence indicates that TAM family receptors play an important role in anti-inflammatory responses through modulating the function of macrophages. First, macrophages can recognize apoptotic bodies through interaction between TAM family receptors expressed on macrophages and their ligands attached to apoptotic bodies. Without TAM signaling, macrophages cannot clear up apoptotic cells, leading to broad inflammation due to over-activation of immune cells. Second, TAM signaling can prevent chronic activation of macrophages by attenuating inflammatory pathways through particular pattern recognition receptors and cytokine receptors. Third, TAM signaling can induce autophagy which is an important mechanism to inhibit NLRP3 inflammasome activation in macrophages. Fourth, TAM signaling can inhibit polarization of M1 macrophages. In this review, we will focus on mechanisms involved in how TAM family of RTKs can modulate function of macrophage associated with anti-inflammatory responses described above. We will also discuss several human diseases related to TAM signaling and potential therapeutic strategies of targeting TAM signaling.","Use of HPV testing in cervical cancer screening services in Mexico, 2008-2018: a nationwide database study.",https://www.ncbi.nlm.nih.gov/pubmed/30699277,Salud publica de Mexico,2019 01 30,To describe the methods of a study aimed at evaluating high risk-HPV (hrHPV)-based screening and cervical cytology as triage compared to conventional cervical cytology as primary screening in the detection of grade 2+ cervical intraepithelial neoplasia in the National Cancer Screening Program (NCSP) of Mexico.,[New strategies for the prevention and control of cervical cancer in Chile.],https://www.ncbi.nlm.nih.gov/pubmed/30699276,Salud publica de Mexico,2019 01 30,"To discuss cervical cancer (CC), Human PapillomaVirus (HPV),CC control program and propose alternatives for Chile.",Prevention and control of neoplasms associated with HPV in high-risk groups in Mexico City: The Condesa Study.,https://www.ncbi.nlm.nih.gov/pubmed/30699275,Salud publica de Mexico,2019 01 30,"To evaluate the effectiveness of a combined strategy of human papillomavirus virus (HPV) vaccination and high-risk HPV screening to reduce the occurrence of anogenital and oropharyngeal neoplasms among men who have sex with men, people with HIV, homeless people, transgender women, female sex workers and rape victims.",[Alternative HPV vaccination schedules in Latin America].,https://www.ncbi.nlm.nih.gov/pubmed/30699274,Salud publica de Mexico,2019 01 30,"En 2008, the first HPV vaccination program in Latin America started in Panama, targeting girls aged 10-11 years with a 3-dose vaccine schedule, an initiative that was to be followed by other Latin American countries after local feasibility and population acceptability evaluations were completed. A 3-dose vaccine regimen over six months was originally chosen for HPV vaccines, copying the Hepatitis B vaccine schedule (0, 1-2, 6 months). Alternative vaccine schedules have been proposed afterwards based on: i) noninferior immunogenicity or immune response levels compared to those at which clinical efficacy has been proven (i.e., those observed in a 3-dose HPV vaccine schedule in women aged 15-26), and, ii) proven efficacy in clinical trials and/or effectiveness among women who were provided less than three doses due to a lack of adherence to a 3-dose vaccine schedule. In 2014, based on the available evidence and the potential increase in coverage by expansion of vaccination target groups, particularly in low and middle income countries (LMIC), the World Health Organization recommended a 2-dose schedule with at least a 6-month interval between doses for females up to 15 years of age and a 3-dose schedule for older women.

Using enhanced green fluorescent protein as a reporter protein, monitored using flow cytometry, CA was shown to downregulate AOX1 promoter induction. Despite higher growth rates, cultures containing CA exhibited slower transition to the induced state, whereas metabolite analysis revealed that methanol consumption was reduced in the presence of CA compared with its absence. The repressive effect of CA was further confirmed by analysing the synthesis of extracellular recombinant Candida antarctica lipase under control of the AOX1 promoter. These findings highlight nitrogen source selection as an important consideration for AOX1-based protein production.",Impact of Free-Choice Diets High in Fat and Different Sugars on Metabolic Outcome and Anxiety-Like Behavior in Rats.,https://www.ncbi.nlm.nih.gov/pubmed/30699240,"Obesity (Silver Spring, Md.)",2019 02 25,"Rats were exposed to free-choice diets (fat plus one of two different sugar solutions, glucose or sucrose), and the metabolic consequences and impact on locomotor activity and anxiety-like behavior were explored.",Computational phantom study of frozen melanoma imaging at 0.45 terahertz.,https://www.ncbi.nlm.nih.gov/pubmed/30699238,Bioelectromagnetics,2019 03 04,"Terahertz radiation (THz) is highly absorbed by liquid water. This creates the possibility of medical imaging on the basis of the water content difference between normal and diseased tissue. The effective penetration of THz is limited, however, to a tissue depth of 0.2-0.3 mm at body temperature. A unique feature of the 0.1-2.0 THz frequency is that there is a high disparity between liquid water absorption and ice absorption, with ice being 100 times more permeable to the radiation than liquid water. This results in 90% of the radiation surviving to 1.0 mm in ice, permitting the imaging of frozen tissues to a depth of 5.0 mm. This method is practical as an in vivo procedure before or during surgical excision. Finite difference time domain (FDTD) computational modeling of frozen normal skin and frozen melanoma was undertaken using tissue phantoms. The study suggests that sufficient contrast exists to differentiate normal frozen skin and melanoma on the basis of the difference of water content alone. When the melanin pigment in melanomas is modeled as a significant absorber of THz, the contrast changes. Based on the modeling, further exploration of the ""THz-skin freeze"" imaging technique is justified. In the modeling, the boundary between the frozen tissue and non-frozen tissue is shown to be strongly reflective. If the reflective properties of the boundary are substantiated, the ""THz-skin freeze"" technique will have applications in other areas of skin diagnostics and therapeutics.

Although solar cells made with 2D perovskites have yet to improve their power conversion efficiencies to compete with 3D perovskite solar cells, their immense diversity offers great opportunities and avenues for research that will likely close the gap between these two. Further, 2D perovskites can have various roles within a solar cell, either as the primary light absorber, as a capping layer, passivating layer, or within a mixed 2D/3D perovskite solar cell absorber. In this Minireview, we will review the history of 2D perovskites in solar cells, the relevant properties of such materials, the different roles that they can play in a solar cell, as well as current trends and challenges.",Agent-Based Recovery Model for Seismic Resilience Evaluation of Electrified Communities.,https://www.ncbi.nlm.nih.gov/pubmed/30699236,Risk analysis : an official publication of the Society for Risk Analysis,2019 01 30,"In this article, an agent-based framework to quantify the seismic resilience of an electric power supply system (EPSS) and the community it serves is presented. Within the framework, the loss and restoration of the EPSS power generation and delivery capacity and of the power demand from the served community are used to assess the electric power deficit during the damage absorption and recovery processes. Damage to the components of the EPSS and of the community-built environment is evaluated using the seismic fragility functions. The restoration of the community electric power demand is evaluated using the seismic recovery functions. However, the postearthquake EPSS recovery process is modeled using an agent-based model with two agents, the EPSS Operator and the Community Administrator. The resilience of the EPSS-community system is quantified using direct, EPSS-related, societal, and community-related indicators. Parametric studies are carried out to quantify the influence of different seismic hazard scenarios, agent characteristics, and power dispatch strategies on the EPSS-community seismic resilience. The use of the agent-based modeling framework enabled a rational formulation of the postearthquake recovery phase and highlighted the interaction between the EPSS and the community in the recovery process not quantified in resilience models developed to date. Furthermore, it shows that the resilience of different community sectors can be enhanced by different power dispatch strategies. The proposed agent-based EPSS-community system resilience quantification framework can be used to develop better community and infrastructure system risk governance policies.",Interventions to reduce shoulder pain following gynaecological laparoscopic procedures.,https://www.ncbi.nlm.nih.gov/pubmed/30699235,The Cochrane database of systematic reviews,2019 04 10,"Laparoscopy is a common procedure used to diagnose and treat various gynaecological conditions.

Using a cross-sectional school survey conducted in one German federal state, two forms of teacher-targeted aggression were assessed: verbal (insulting, threatening, and mocking) and physical (beating and pushing) aggression. Every ninth student reported verbal aggression, while 0.5% of students reported physical aggression against teachers. Multilevel probability models showed that individual importation factors (low self-control, male gender, and exposure to severe parental violence), together with individual deprivation factors (repeated victimization by teachers and low school achievement) play a role in explaining teacher-targeted aggression. The school-level deprivation factor of negative teacher-student relationships was also relevant, whereas low teacher control and attending lower-level schools were unrelated to the perpetration of teacher-targeted aggression. The present study stresses the need to acknowledge the multilevel etiology of teacher-targeted aggression.",Diet-Induced Obesity in Cannabinoid-2 Receptor Knockout Mice and Cannabinoid Receptor 1/2 Double-Knockout Mice.,https://www.ncbi.nlm.nih.gov/pubmed/30699233,"Obesity (Silver Spring, Md.)",2019 03 29,"Evidence suggests that cannabinoid-1 receptor (CB1R) activation is associated with increased food intake and body weight gain.

In this study, an ePTFE bi-leaflet valve design for aortic valve replacement (AVR) is presented, and the performance of the proposed valve was assessed numerically and experimentally. The valve was designed using CAE software. The dynamic behavior of the newly designed bi-leaflet valve under time-varying physiological pressure loading was first investigated by using commercial finite element code. Then, in-vitro tests were performed to validate the simulation and to assess the hemodynamic performance of the proposed design. A tri-leaflet ePTFE valve was tested in-vitro under the same conditions as a reference. The maximum leaflet coaptation area of the bi-leaflet valve during diastole was 216.3 mm2. When fully closed, no leakage gap was observed and the free edges of the molded valve formed S-shaped lines. The maximum Von Mises stress during a full cardiac cycle was 4.20 MPa. The dynamic performance of the bi-leaflet valve was validated by the in-vitro test under physiological aortic pressure pulse. The effective orifice area (EOA), mean pressure gradient, regurgitant volume, leakage volume and energy loss of the proposed valve were 3.14 cm2, 8.74 mmHg, 5.93 ml/beat, 1.55 ml/beat and 98.99 mJ, respectively. This study reports a novel bi-leaflet valve design for AVR. The performance of the proposed valve was numerically and experimentally assessed. Compared with the reference valve, the proposed design exhibited better structural and hemodynamic performances, which improved valve competency. Moreover, the performance of the bi-leaflet design is comparable to commercialized valves available on the market. The results of the present study provide a viable option for the future clinical applications.",No age thresholds in the emergency department: A retrospective cohort study on age differences.,https://www.ncbi.nlm.nih.gov/pubmed/30699209,PloS one,2019 02 19,"Emergency care in elderly patients has gained attention by researchers due to high utilization rate and the importance of emergency services in elderly care. We examine if there is a clear age threshold between young and old patients at which there is a need for extra care and facilities in the emergency department. This retrospective cohort study uses emergency department (ED) data collected over the course of a year, containing information about 31,491 patient visits. The measured variables are treatment time, waiting time, number of tests, number of medical procedures, number of specialties involved and the patient's length of stay on the ED. To examine the multivariate differences between different patient groups, the data set is split into eighteen age groups and a MANOVA analysis is conducted to compare group means. The results show that older patients tend to have a longer stay on the ED. They also require more medical tests, have higher resource utilization and admission rates to the hospital. When the patients are grouped according to life stages (<18, 18-39, 40-64 and ≥65), each life stage shows significantly different characteristics across all variables. To understand where these differences start, age bins of five years are analyzed and almost none of the consecutive groups are significantly different in any variable. A significant difference between all groups is observed when age interval of the bins is increased to 10 years. This indicates that although age has an effect on the patient's treatment, a clear age threshold that identifies the group of elderly patients is not observable from emergency room variables. The results of this study show no clear age boundary between young and old patients. In other words, we could not find support for favoring the often-used age boundary of 65 over other boundaries (e.g. 60 or 70) to distinguish the group of elderly patients on the ED.",Improved phylogeny of brown algae Cystoseira (Fucales) from the Atlantic-Mediterranean region based on mitochondrial sequences.,https://www.ncbi.nlm.nih.gov/pubmed/30699208,PloS one,2019 02 19,"Cystoseira is a common brown algal genus widely distributed throughout the Atlantic and Mediterranean regions whose taxonomical assignment of specimens is often hampered by intra- and interspecific morphological variability. In this study, three mitochondrial regions, namely cytochrome oxidase subunit 1 (COI), 23S rDNA (23S), and 23S-tRNAVal intergenic spacer (mt-spacer) were used to analyse the phylogenetic relationships of 22 Cystoseira taxa (n = 93 samples). A total of 135 sequences (48 from COI, 43 from 23S and 44 from mt-spacer) were newly generated and analysed together with Cystoseira sequences (9 COI, 31 23S and 35 mt-spacer) from other authors. Phylogenetic analysis of these three markers identified 3 well-resolved clades and also corroborated the polyphyletic nature of the genus. The resolution of Cystoseira taxa within the three clades improves significantly when the inclusion of specimens of related genera was minimized. COI and mt-spacer markers resolved the phylogeny of some of the Cystoseira taxa, such as the C. baccata, C. foeniculacea and C. usneoides. Furthermore, trends between phylogeny, embryonic development and available chemotaxonomic classifications were identified, showing that phylogenetic, chemical and morphological data should be taken into account to study the evolutionary relationships among the algae currently classified as Cystoseira. The resolution of Cystoseira macroalgae into three well supported clades achieved here is relevant for a more accurate isolation and identification of natural compounds and the implementation of conservation measures for target species.",Strengths and limitations of computer assisted telephone interviews (CATI) for nutrition data collection in rural Kenya.,https://www.ncbi.nlm.nih.gov/pubmed/30699207,PloS one,2019 02 19,"Despite progress in fighting undernutrition, Africa has the highest rates of undernutrition globally, exacerbated by drought and conflict. Mobile phones are emerging as a tool for rapid, cost effective data collection at scale in Africa, as mobile phone subscriptions and phone ownership increase at the highest rates globally. To assess the feasibility and biases of collecting nutrition data via computer assisted telephone interviews (CATI) to mobile phones, we measured Minimum Dietary Diversity for Women (MDD-W) and Minimum Acceptable Diet for Infants and Young Children (MAD) using a one-week test-retest study on 1,821 households in Kenya. Accuracy and bias were assessed by comparing individual scores and population prevalence of undernutrition collected via CATI with data collected via traditional face-to-face (F2F) surveys. We were able to reach 75% (n = 1366) of study participants via CATI. Women's reported nutrition scores did not change with mode for MDD-W, but children's nutrition scores were significantly higher when measured via CATI for both the dietary diversity (mean increase of 0.45 food groups, 95% confidence interval 0.34-0.56) and meal frequency (mean increase of 0.75 meals per day, 95% confidence interval 0.53-0.96) components of MAD. This resulted in a 17% higher inferred prevalence of adequate diets for infants and young children via CATI. Women without mobile-phone access were younger and had fewer assets than women with access, but only marginally lower dietary diversity, resulting in a small non-coverage bias of 1-7% due to exclusion of participants without mobile phones. Thus, collecting nutrition data from rural women in Africa with mobile phones may result in 0% (no change) to as much as 25% higher nutrition estimates than collecting that information in face-to-face interviews.",Social dynamics modeling of chrono-nutrition.,https://www.ncbi.nlm.nih.gov/pubmed/30699206,PLoS computational biology,2019 02 28,"Gut microbiota and human relationships are strictly connected to each other. What we eat reflects our body-mind connection and synchronizes with people around us. However, how this impacts on gut microbiota and, conversely, how gut bacteria influence our dietary behaviors has not been explored yet. To quantify the complex dynamics of this interplay between gut and human behaviors we explore the ""gut-human behavior axis"" and its evolutionary dynamics in a real-world scenario represented by the social multiplex network. We consider a dual type of similarity, homophily and gut similarity, other than psychological and unconscious biases. We analyze the dynamics of social and gut microbial communities, quantifying the impact of human behaviors on diets and gut microbial composition and, backwards, through a control mechanism. Meal timing mechanisms and ""chrono-nutrition"" play a crucial role in feeding behaviors, along with the quality and quantity of food intake. Considering a population of shift workers, we explore the dynamic interplay between their eating behaviors and gut microbiota, modeling the social dynamics of chrono-nutrition in a multiplex network. Our findings allow us to quantify the relation between human behaviors and gut microbiota through the methodological introduction of gut metabolic modeling and statistical estimators, able to capture their dynamic interplay. Moreover, we find that the timing of gut microbial communities is slower than social interactions and shift-working, and the impact of shift-working on the dynamics of chrono-nutrition is a fluctuation of strategies with a major propensity for defection (e.g. high-fat meals). A deeper understanding of the relation between gut microbiota and the dietary behavioral patterns, by embedding also the related social aspects, allows improving the overall knowledge about metabolic models and their implications for human health, opening the possibility to design promising social therapeutic dietary interventions."

This adventitial layer is composed of collagen fibers, epithelioid cells, eosinophils and lymphocytes. To establish itself inside the host, the germinal layer produces the laminated layer, and to continue its life cycle, generates protoscoleces.

KSHV-encoded viral interferon regulatory factor 1 (vIRF1) is a viral oncogene but its role in KSHV-induced tumor invasiveness and motility remains unknown. Here, we report that vIRF1 promotes endothelial cell migration, invasion and proliferation by down-regulating miR-218-5p to relieve its suppression of downstream targets high mobility group box 2 (HMGB2) and cytidine/uridine monophosphate kinase 1 (CMPK1). Mechanistically, vIRF1 inhibits p53 function to increase the expression of DNA methyltransferase 1 (DNMT1) and DNA methylation of the promoter of pre-miR-218-1, a precursor of miR-218-5p, and increases the expression of a long non-coding RNA OIP5 antisense RNA 1 (lnc-OIP5-AS1), which acts as a competing endogenous RNA (ceRNA) of miR-218-5p to inhibit its function and reduce its stability. Moreover, lnc-OIP5-AS1 increases DNA methylation of the pre-miR-218-1 promoter. Finally, deletion of vIRF1 from the KSHV genome reduces the level of lnc-OIP5-AS1, increases the level of miR-218-5p, and inhibits KSHV-induced invasion. Together, these results define a novel complex lnc-OIP5-AS1/miR-218-5p network hijacked by vIRF1 to promote invasiveness and motility of KSHV-induced tumors.",A neural hallmark of auditory implicit learning is altered in older adults.,https://www.ncbi.nlm.nih.gov/pubmed/30699188,PloS one,2019 02 19,"Temporal regularities in the environment are often learned implicitly. In an auditory target-detection paradigm using EEG, Jongsma and colleagues (2006) showed that the neural response to these implicit regularities results in a reduction of the P3-N2 complex. Here, we utilized the same paradigm, this time in both young and old participants, to determine if this EEG signature of implicit learning was altered with age. Behaviorally, both groups of participants showed similar benefits for the presence of temporal regularity, with faster and more accurate responses given when the auditory targets were presented in a temporally regular vs. random pattern. In the brain, the younger adults showed the expected decrease in amplitude of this complex for regular compared to irregular trials. Older adults, in contrast, showed no difference in the amplitude of the P3-N2 complex between the irregular and regular condition. These data suggest that, although auditory implicit learning may be behaviorally spared in aging, older adults are not using the same neural substrates as younger adults to achieve this.",Bovine milk-derived exosomes enhance goblet cell activity and prevent the development of experimental necrotizing enterocolitis.,https://www.ncbi.nlm.nih.gov/pubmed/30699187,PloS one,2019 02 19,"Necrotizing enterocolitis (NEC) is characterized by intestinal injury and impaired mucin synthesis. We recently showed that breast milk exosomes from rodents promote intestinal cell viability, epithelial proliferation, and stem cell activity, but whether they also affect mucus production is unknown. Therefore, the aim of this study was to investigate the effects of bovine milk-derived exosomes on goblet cell expression in experimental NEC and delineate potential underlying mechanisms of action. Exosomes were isolated from bovine milk by ultracentrifugation and confirmed by Nanoparticle Tracking Analysis and through the detection of exosome membrane markers. To study the effect on mucin production, human colonic LS174T cells were cultured and exposed to exosomes. Compared to control, exosomes promoted goblet cell expression, as demonstrated by increased mucin production and relative expression levels of goblet cell expression markers trefoil factor 3 (TFF3) and mucin 2 (MUC2). In addition, exosome treatment enhanced the expression of glucose-regulated protein 94 (GRP94), the most abundant intraluminal endoplasmic reticulum (ER) chaperone protein that aids in protein synthesis. Furthermore, experimental NEC was induced in mouse pups by hyperosmolar formula feeding, lipopolysaccharide administration and hypoxia exposure on postnatal days 5-9. Milk exosomes were given with each gavage feed. NEC was associated with ileal morphological injury and reduction in MUC2+ goblet cells and GRP94+ cells per villus. Exosome administration to NEC pups prevented these changes. This research highlights the potential novel application of milk-derived exosomes in preventing the development of NEC in high-risk infants when breast milk is not available.",Alternative splicing of ZmCCA1 mediates drought response in tropical maize.,https://www.ncbi.nlm.nih.gov/pubmed/30699185,PloS one,2019 02 19,"The circadian clock regulates numerous biological processes in plants, especially development and stress responses. CIRCADIAN CLOCK-ASSOCIATED 1 (CCA1) is one of the core components of the day-night rhythm response and is reportedly associated with ambient temperature in Arabidopsis thaliana. However, it remains unknown if alternative splicing of ZmCCA1 is modulated by external stress in maize, such as drought stress and photoperiod. Here, we identified three ZmCCA1 splice variants in the tropical maize line CML288, which are predicted to encode three different protein isoforms, i.e., ZmCCA1.1, ZmCCA1.2, and ZmCCA1.3, which all retain the MYB domain. In maize, the expression levels of ZmCCA1 splice variants were influenced by photoperiod, tissue type, and drought stress. In transgenic A. thaliana, ZmCCA1.1 may be more effective than ZmCCA1.3 in increasing drought tolerance while ZmCCA1.2 may have only a small effect on tolerance to drought stress. Additionally, although CCA1 genes have been found in many plant species, alternative CCA1 splicing events are known to occur in species-specific ways. Our study provides new sight to explore the function of ZmCCA1 splice variants' response to abiotic stress, and clarify the linkage between circadian clock and environmental stress in maize.",Measurement of time-varying kinematics of a dolphin in burst accelerating swimming.,https://www.ncbi.nlm.nih.gov/pubmed/30699184,PloS one,2019 02 19,"Dolphins are well known as excellent swimmers for being capable of efficient cruising and sharp acceleration. While studies of the thrust production and power consumption of dolphin swimming have been the main subject for decades, time-varying acceleration process during successive fluke beats still remains poorly understood. In this study, we quantified the time-varying kinematics of a dolphin (Lagenorhynchus obliquidens) by directly recording its burst-accelerating swimming before vertical jump in an aquarium with two synchronized high-speed video cameras. We tracked the three-dimensional trajectories of its beak, body sides, and fluke. We found that dolphin could quickly accelerate from 5.0 m s-1 to 8.7 m s-1 merely by 5 strokes (i.e. 2.5 fluke beats) in 0.7 seconds. During the strokes, it was further found that the dolphin demonstrated a great acceleration in downstroke but less acceleration or even a slight deceleration in upstroke. Hydrodynamic forces and thrust power for each stroke were further estimated based on the equation of body motion and a static hydrodynamic model. The drag coefficient of the dolphin was estimated through computational fluid dynamics (CFD) modeling of the steady flows around a realistic geometric model based on 3-D scan data. The thrust and thrust power were then calculated by combining the body kinematics and the drag coefficient, resulting in a maximum stroke-averaged thrust and power-to-mass ratio of 1.3 × 103 N and 90 W kg-1 at downstroke, and 3.3 × 102 N and 19 W kg-1 at upstroke, respectively. Our results point out the importance of asymmetric kinematics in burst acceleration of dolphin, which may be a useful mechanism for biomimetic design of high-performance underwater robots.",Prognostic factors associated with survival in patients with anaplastic oligodendroglioma.,https://www.ncbi.nlm.nih.gov/pubmed/30699183,PloS one,2019 02 19,"Anaplastic oligodendroglioma is a rare disease with an inadequately understood prognosis. The aim of this study was to investigate factors associated with survival outcome in anaplastic oligodendroglioma patients. A population-based cohort study was conducted based on the Surveillance, Epidemiology, and End Results program. In total, 1899 patients with a histological diagnosis of anaplastic oligodendroglioma from 1973 to 2015 were included. Mean age at diagnosis was 49.2 years, and 56.19% were male. In our study, 62.40% of patients were married, and 87.05% were white. Most patients (90.42%) were diagnosed with anaplastic oligodendroglioma as their first malignant primary tumor, but 9.58% had a diagnosis of at least one other primary malignancy; 87.89% of patients had received cancer-directed surgery. Patients receiving surgery had a better prognosis for overall survival compared to those not receiving surgery after propensity score matching analysis (p<0.05). The overall 1-, 3-, 5-, and 10-year survival of anaplastic oligodendroglioma was 78.7%, 60%, 50.2%, and 36.2%, respectively. Kaplan-Meier analysis indicated that age, marital status, presence of multiple primary malignancies, and surgical treatment were associated with overall survival, whereas sex and race were not. Moreover, age at diagnosis of 52 years was calculated as an optimal cutoff value to distinguish better and worse overall survival. Multivariate Cox proportional hazard analysis indicated that older age (OR 1.040, 95%CI1.035-1.045), single patients (OR 1.293, 95%CI 1.103-1.515), and presence of multiple primary malignancies (OR 1.501, 95%CI 1.238-1.820) were significantly associated with worse overall survival, whereas surgery (OR 0.584, 95%CI 0.494-0.689) was associated with better overall survival. A nomogram predicting 5-, and 10-year survival probability for anaplastic oligodendroglioma was constructed based on these variables. In conclusion, age, marital status, presence of multiple primary malignancies, and surgical treatment were associated with survival of anaplastic oligodendroglioma.",Assessment of displacement ventilation systems in airborne infection risk in hospital rooms.,https://www.ncbi.nlm.nih.gov/pubmed/30699182,PloS one,2019 02 19,"Efficient ventilation in hospital airborne isolation rooms is important vis-à-vis decreasing the risk of cross infection and reducing energy consumption. This paper analyses the suitability of using a displacement ventilation strategy in airborne infection isolation rooms, focusing on health care worker exposure to pathogens exhaled by infected patients. The analysis is mainly based on numerical simulation results obtained with the support of a 3-D transient numerical model validated using experimental data. A thermal breathing manikin lying on a bed represents the source patient and another thermal breathing manikin represents the exposed individual standing beside the bed and facing the patient. A radiant wall represents an external wall exposed to solar radiation. The air change efficiency index and contaminant removal effectiveness indices and inhalation by the health care worker of contaminants exhaled by the patient are considered in a typical airborne infection isolation room set up with three air renewal rates (6 h-1, 9 h-1 and 12 h-1), two exhaust opening positions and two health care worker positions. Results show that the radiant wall significantly affects the air flow pattern and contaminant dispersion. The lockup phenomenon occurs at the inhalation height of the standing manikin. Displacement ventilation renews the air of the airborne isolation room and eliminates the exhaled pollutants efficiently, but is at a disadvantage compared to other ventilation strategies when the risk of exposure is taken into account.",A combined association mapping and t-test analysis of SNP loci and candidate genes involving in resistance to low nitrogen traits by a wheat mutant population.,https://www.ncbi.nlm.nih.gov/pubmed/30699181,PloS one,2019 02 19,"Crop productivity is highly dependent on the application of N fertilizers, but ever-increasing N application is causing serious environmental impacts. To facilitate the development of new wheat cultivars that can thrive in low N growth conditions, key loci and genes associated with wheat responses to low N must be identified. In this GWAS and t-test study of 190 M6 mutant wheat lines (Jing 411-derived) based on genotype data from the wheat 660k SNP array, we identified a total of 221 significant SNPs associated four seedling phenotypic traits that have been implicated in resistance to low N: relative root length, relative shoot length, relative root weight, and relative shoot weight. Notably, we detected large numbers of significantly associated SNP in what appear to be genomic 'hotspots' for resistance to low N on chromosomes 2A and 6B, strongly suggesting that these regions are functionally related to the resistance phenotypes that we observed in some of the mutant lines. Moreover, the candidate genes, including genes encoding high-affinity nitrate transporter 2.1, gibberellin responsive protein, were identified for resistance to low N. This study raises plausible mechanistic hypotheses that can be evaluated in future applied or basic efforts by breeders or plant biologists seeking to develop new high-NUE wheat cultivars.",The difference between horizontal-to-vertical spectra ratio and empirical transfer function as revealed by vertical arrays.,https://www.ncbi.nlm.nih.gov/pubmed/30699179,PloS one,2019 02 16,"The horizontal-to-vertical spectral ratio (HVSR) and empirical transfer function analyses were performed on the S-wave recordings from two vertical borehole strong motion arrays: the Garner Valley Downhole Array in southern California, and the KiK-net Ichinoseki-Nishi Vertical Array in West Ichinoseki, Japan. The results show that the discrepancy between the HVSR and the transfer function is mainly caused by the significant site response of the vertical component, thus, vertical incident P-waves are proposed to play an important role in the vertical amplification. The P-wave amplification is frequency-dependent. In the low-frequency range within f0 (the fundamental frequency of the site), the effect of the vertical P-wave amplification is slight, this is why HVSR and transfer function match in this frequency range. In the high-frequency range near 2 f0 or larger, the P-wave amplification is obvious, which maybe explain the discrepancy between the HVSR and the transfer function."

However, over the course of that decade, the uptake of iron and folic acid (IFA) supplementation for 100 days of pregnancy improved by only 15%. To understand demand side risk factors of anaemia specifically related to IFA intake, an in-depth survey was conducted on pregnant women (n = 436) in 50 villages and wards of Sirohi district of Rajasthan, India. At the demand side, consistent IFA consumption in the previous trimester was inversely and strongly associated with anaemia (OR: 0.26, 95% CI: 0.12, 0.55). Reasons for inconsistent consumption included not registering to antenatal clinic, not receiving IFA tablets from the health worker and perceived lack of need. At the supply side, an analysis of IFA stock data at various levels of the health care (n = 168) providers from primary to tertiary levels showed that 14 out of 52 villages surveyed did not have access to IFA tablets. The closest availability of an IFA tablet for 16 villages, was more than 5 km away. To improve the uptake of IFA supplementation and thereby reduce iron deficiency anaemia in pregnant women, a constant supply of IFA at the village or sub-centre level, where frontline workers can promote uptake, should be ensured.",Identification of qPCR reference genes suitable for normalizing gene expression in the mdx mouse model of Duchenne muscular dystrophy.,https://www.ncbi.nlm.nih.gov/pubmed/30699165,PloS one,2019 02 19,"The mdx mouse is the most widely-used animal model of the human disease Duchenne muscular dystrophy, and quantitative PCR analysis of gene expression in the muscles of this animal plays a key role in the study of pathogenesis and disease progression and in evaluation of potential therapeutic interventions. Normalization to appropriate stably-expressed reference genes is essential for accurate quantitative measurement, but determination of such genes is challenging: healthy and dystrophic muscles present very different transcriptional environments, further altering with disease progression and muscle use, raising the possibility that no single gene or combination of genes may be stable under all experimental comparative scenarios. Despite the pedigree of this animal model, this problem remains unaddressed. The aim of this work was therefore to comprehensively assess reference gene suitability in the muscles of healthy and dystrophic mice, identifying reference genes appropriate for specific experimental comparisons, and determining whether an essentially universally-applicable set of genes exists. Using a large sample collection comprising multiple muscles (including the tibialis anterior, diaphragm and heart muscles) taken from healthy and mdx mice at three disease-relevant ages, and a panel of sixteen candidate reference genes (FBXO38, FBXW2, MON2, ZFP91, HTATSF1, GAPDH, ACTB, 18S, CDC40, SDHA, RPL13a, CSNK2A2, AP3D1, PAK1IP1, B2M and HPRT1), we used the geNorm, BestKeeper and Normfinder algorithms to identify genes that were stable under multiple possible comparative scenarios. We reveal that no single gene is stable under all conditions, but a normalization factor derived from multiple genes (RPL13a, CSNK2A2, AP3D1 and the widely-used ACTB) appears suitable for normalizing gene expression in both healthy and dystrophic mouse muscle regardless of muscle type or animal age. We further show that other popular reference genes, including GAPDH, are markedly disease- or muscle-type correlated. This study demonstrates the importance of empirical reference gene identification, and should serve as a valuable resource for investigators wishing to study gene expression in mdx mice.",Assessing the level of radiation experienced by anesthesiologists during transfemoral Transcatheter Aortic Valve Implantation and protection by a lead cap.,https://www.ncbi.nlm.nih.gov/pubmed/30699164,PloS one,2019 02 19,"Transfemoral Transcatheter Aortic Valve Implantation (TAVI) has become a standard therapy for patients with aortic valve stenosis.

These events were predominantly caused by thermal anomalies, which vary widely in terms of severity and spatio-temporal distribution. Acropora corals, highly prominent contributors to the structural complexity of Pacific coral reefs, are sensitive to thermal stress. Response of Acropora corals to extremely high temperature has been well documented. However, studies on the effects of moderately high temperature on Acropora corals are limited. In the summer of 2016, a moderate coral bleaching event due to moderately high temperature was observed around Sesoko Island, Okinawa, Japan. The objective of this study was to examine thermal tolerance patterns of Acropora corals, across reefs with low to moderate thermal exposure (degree heating weeks ~2-5°C week). Field surveys on permanent plots were conducted from October 2015 to April 2017 to compare the population dynamics of adult Acropora corals 6 months before and after the bleaching events around Sesoko Island. Variability in thermal stress response was driven primarily by the degree of thermal stress. Wave action and turbidity may have mediated the thermal stress. Tabular and digitate coral morphologies were the most tolerant and susceptible to thermal stress, respectively. Growth inhibition after bleaching was more pronounced in the larger digitate and corymbose coral morphologies. This study indicates that Acropora populations around Sesoko Island can tolerate short-term, moderate thermal challenges.","Historical observations of algal blooms in Mazatlan Bay, Sinaloa, Mexico (1979-2014).",https://www.ncbi.nlm.nih.gov/pubmed/30699162,PloS one,2019 02 19,"A 35-year record of algal blooms in Mazatlan Bay is reviewed in order to register bloom-forming species and their seasonal presence, duration, degree of toxicity and environmental impact. A total of 202 algal blooms have been recorded and 25 dominant species identified: 6 toxic, 5 harmful and 14 harmless species. A harmless species, Myrionecta rubra, tended to decrease in frequency, while toxic species Gymnodinium catenatum and Margalefidinium polykrikoides showed a clear trend towards an increase in frequency. The number of discoloration days attributable to blooms was highly variable in each year, but a decadal analysis revealed a tendency to increase. The monthly distribution of algal blooms for decades showed two peaks of high frequency, the larger from February to May and the smaller from September to November. The duration of blooms varied from a few days to more than three months; the ephemeral blooms were the most frequent, but in the last decade, the frequency of the longer-lasting blooms has increased. An absence of blooms in 1983-4 and 1992-3 coincided with strong El Niño events, but this pattern was not consistent in subsequent El Niño years. Years with more or fewer discolorations days appear to be associated with cold or warm phases of the Pacific Decadal Oscillation.",Adolescent offenders' current whereabouts predict locations of their future crimes.,https://www.ncbi.nlm.nih.gov/pubmed/30699161,PloS one,2019 02 19,"Knowing where crime is likely to happen can help prevent it. Here I investigate whether two basic mechanisms of human mobility-preferential return and spatial exploration-explain and predict where offenders commit future crimes. A sample of 843 adolescents reported their hourly whereabouts during four days. In line with findings from other sources and populations, their locations were concentrated and predictable. During the subsequent four years, 70 of the 843 were apprehended for committing one or more crimes. Compared to others, these 70 future offenders had visited slightly more different locations. However, their action radius and the predictability of their whereabouts had been very similar to those who would not become offenders. The offenders perpetrated most of their crimes around places they had visited before, including places where they previously offended. These findings show that the predictability of human mobility applies to offending and to offenders as well, and helps us understand and forecast where they will commit future crimes. They may prove particularly useful in criminal investigations, as they suggest that police should generally prioritize suspects who are familiar with the location of the crime and its environs, either because of their legal routine activities or because of their prior offences.",Targeted HIV testing for male partners of HIV-positive pregnant women in a high prevalence setting in Nigeria.,https://www.ncbi.nlm.nih.gov/pubmed/30699160,PloS one,2019 02 19,"Partner HIV testing during pregnancy has remained abysmally low in sub-Saharan Africa, particularly in Nigeria.

The molecular basis of pyrethroid resistance is relatively uncharacterised in American malaria vectors, preventing the design of suitable resistance management strategies. Using whole transcriptome sequencing, we characterized the mechanisms of pyrethroid resistance in Anopheles albimanus from Peru and Guatemala. An. albimanus were phenotyped as either deltamethrin or alpha-cypermethrin resistant. RNA from 1) resistant, 2) unexposed, and 3) a susceptible laboratory strain of An. albimanus was sequenced and analyzed using RNA-Seq. Expression profiles of the three groups were compared based on the current annotation of the An. albimanus reference genome. Several candidate genes associated with pyrethroid resistance in other malaria vectors were found to be overexpressed in resistant An. albimanus. In addition, gene ontology terms related to serine-type endopeptidase activity, extracellular activity and chitin metabolic process were also commonly overexpressed in the field caught resistant and unexposed samples from both Peru and Guatemala when compared to the susceptible strain. The cytochrome P450 CYP9K1 was overexpressed 14x in deltamethrin and 8x in alpha-cypermethrin-resistant samples from Peru and 2x in deltamethrin-resistant samples from Guatemala, relative to the susceptible laboratory strain. CYP6P5 was overexpressed 68x in deltamethrin-resistant samples from Peru but not in deltamethrin-resistant samples from Guatemala. When comparing overexpressed genes between deltamethrin-resistant and alpha-cypermethrin-resistant samples from Peru, a single P450 gene, CYP4C26, was overexpressed 9.8x (p<0.05) in alpha-cypermethrin-resistant samples. In Peruvian deltamethrin-resistant samples, the knockdown resistance mutation (kdr) variant alleles at position 1014 were rare, with approximately 5% frequency, but in the alpha-cypermethrin-resistant samples, the frequency of these alleles was approximately 15-30%. Functional validation of the candidate genes and the kdr mutation as a resistance marker for alpha-cypermethrin will confirm the role of these mechanisms in conferring pyrethroid resistance.",The glycerol-3-phosphate acyltransferase PLAT2 functions in the generation of DHA-rich glycerolipids in Aurantiochytrium limacinum F26-b.,https://www.ncbi.nlm.nih.gov/pubmed/30699157,PloS one,2019 02 19,"Thraustochytrids possess docosahexaenoic acid (DHA, 22:6n-3) as acyl chain(s) of triacylglycerol (TG) and phosphatidylcholine (PC), some of which contain multiple DHAs. However, little is known about how these DHA-rich glycerolipids are produced in thraustochytrids. In this study, we identified PLAT2 in Aurantiochytrium limacinum F26-b as a glycerol-3-phosphate (G3P) acyltransferase (GPAT) by heterologous expression of the gene in budding yeast. Subsequently, we found that GPAT activity was reduced by disruption of the PLAT2 gene in A. limacinum, resulting in a decrease in DHA-containing lysophosphatidic acid (LPA 22:6). Conversely, overexpression of PLAT2 increased both GPAT activity and LPA 22:6. These results indicate that PLAT2 is a GPAT that transfers DHA to G3P in vivo as well as in vitro. Overexpression of the PLAT2 gene increased the production of a two DHA-containing diacylglycerol (DG 44:12), followed by an increase in the three DHA-containing TG (TG 66:18), two-DHA-containing TG (TG 60:12), and two DHA-containing PC (PC 44:12). However, overexpression of PLAT2 did not increase DHA-free DG (DG32:0), which was preferentially converted to three 16:0-containing TG (TG 48:0) but not two 16:0-containing PC (PC 32:0). Collectively, we revealed that DHA-rich glycerolipids are produced from a precursor, LPA 22:6, which is generated by incorporating DHA to G3P by PLAT2 in the A. limacinum."

A tool which intensively searches for the globally optimal non-sequential alignments is rarely found. We propose ALIGN-CSA which shows improvement in scores, such as DALI-score, SP-score, SO-score and TM-score over the benchmark set including 286 cases. We performed benchmarking of existing popular alignment scoring functions, where the dependence of the search algorithm was effectively eliminated by using ALIGN-CSA. For the benchmarking, we set the minimum block size to 4 to prevent much fragmented alignments where the biological relevance of small alignment blocks is hard to interpret. With this condition, globally optimal alignments were searched by ALIGN-CSA using the four scoring functions listed above, and TM-score is found to be the most effective in generating alignments with longer match lengths and smaller RMSD values. However, DALI-score is the most effective in generating alignments similar to the manually curated reference alignments, which implies that DALI-score is more biologically relevant score. Due to the high demand on computational resources of ALIGN-CSA, we also propose a relatively fast local refinement method, which can control the minimum block size and whether to allow the reverse alignment. ALIGN-CSA can be used to obtain much improved alignment at the cost of relatively more extensive computation. For faster alignment, we propose a refinement protocol that improves the score of a given alignment obtained by various external tools.

BEST Programs seek to increase trainees' knowledge, skills and confidence to explore and pursue expanded career options, as well as to increase training in new skills that enable multiple career pathways. Faculty mentors are vital to a trainee's professional development, but data about how faculty members of biomedical trainees view the value of, and the time spent on, career development are lacking. Seven BEST institutions investigated this issue by conducting faculty surveys during their BEST experiment. The survey intent was to understand faculty perceptions around professional and career development for their trainees. Two different, complementary surveys were employed, one designed by Michigan State University (MSU) and the other by Vanderbilt University. Faculty (592) across five institutions responded to the MSU survey; 225 faculty members from two institutions responded to the Vanderbilt University survey. Participating faculty were largely tenure track and male; approximately 1/3 had spent time in a professional position outside of academia. Respondents felt a sense of urgency in introducing broad career activities for trainees given a recognized shortage of tenure track positions. They reported believing career development needs are different between a graduate student and postdoctoral fellow, and they indicated that they actively mentor trainees in career development. However, faculty were uncertain as to whether they actually have the knowledge or training to do so effectively. Faculty perceived that trainees themselves lack a knowledge base of skills that are of interest to non-academic employers. Thus, there is a need for exposure and training in such skills. Faculty stated unequivocally that institutional support for career development is important and needed. BEST Programs were considered beneficial to trainees, but the awareness of local BEST Programs and the national BEST Consortium was low at the time surveys were employed at some institutions. It is our hope that the work presented here will increase the awareness of the BEST national effort and the need for further career development for biomedical trainees.",Population genetic structure of the Mediterranean horseshoe bat Rhinolophus euryale in the central Balkans.,https://www.ncbi.nlm.nih.gov/pubmed/30699143,PloS one,2019 02 19,"Migratory behaviour, sociality and roost selection have a great impact on the population structure of one species. Many bat species live in groups, and movements between summer and hibernation sites are common in temperate bats. The Mediterranean horseshoe bat Rhinolophus euryale is a cave-dwelling species that exhibits roost philopatry and undertakes seasonal movements which are usually shorter than 50 km. Its distribution in Serbia is restricted to karstic areas in western and eastern parts of the country, with a lack of known roosts between them. In this study, microsatellite markers were used to evaluate genetic variation in this species in the Central Balkans. Specifically, spatial genetic structuring between geographic regions and relatedness within different colony types were assessed. All analysed loci were polymorphic, and there was no significant inbreeding coefficient recorded. A moderate degree of genetic differentiation among the sampled colonies was found, and significant isolation by distance was recorded. Our results revealed that populations show a tendency to segregate into three clusters. Unexpectedly, populations from Montenegro and Eastern Serbia tended to group into one cluster, while populations from Western Serbia and Slovenia represented second and third cluster, respectively. The majority of variance was partitioned within colonies, and only a small but significant portion among clusters. Average relatedness within colony members was close to zero, did not differ significantly between the different colony types, and kinship is unlikely to be a major grouping mechanism in this species.",Sporosarcina pasteurii can form nanoscale calcium carbonate crystals on cell surface.,https://www.ncbi.nlm.nih.gov/pubmed/30699142,PloS one,2019 02 19,"The bacterium Sporosarcina pasteurii (SP) is known for its ability to cause the phenomenon of microbially induced calcium carbonate precipitation (MICP). We explored bacterial participation in the initial stages of the MICP process at the cellular length scale under two different growth environments (a) liquid culture (b) MICP in a soft agar (0.5%) column. In the liquid culture, ex-situ imaging of the cellular environment indicated that S. pasteurii was facilitating nucleation of nanoscale crystals of calcium carbonate on bacterial cell surface and its growth via ureolysis. During the same period, the meso-scale environment (bulk medium) was found to have overgrown calcium carbonate crystals. The effect of media components (urea, CaCl2), presence of live and dead in the growth medium were explored. The agar column method allows for in-situ visualization of the phenomena, and using this platform, we found conclusive evidence of the bacterial cell surface facilitating formation of nanoscale crystals in the microenvironment. Here also the bulk environment or the meso-scale environment was found to possess overgrown calcium carbonate crystals. Extensive elemental analysis using Energy dispersive X-ray spectroscopy (EDS) and X-ray powder diffraction (XRD), confirmed that the crystals to be calcium carbonate, and two different polymorphs (calcite and vaterite) were identified. Active participation of S. pasteurii cell surface as the site of calcium carbonate precipitation has been shown using EDS elemental mapping with Scanning transmission electron microscopy (STEM) and scanning electron microscopy (SEM).",High spatio-temporal variability in Acroporidae settlement to inshore reefs of the Great Barrier Reef.,https://www.ncbi.nlm.nih.gov/pubmed/30699141,PloS one,2019 02 19,"Recovery of coral reefs after disturbance relies heavily on replenishment through successful larval settlement and their subsequent survival. As part of an integrated study to determine the potential effects of water quality changes on the resilience of inshore coral communities, scleractinian coral settlement was monitored between 2006 and 2012 at 12 reefs within the inshore Great Barrier Reef. Settlement patterns were only analysed for the family Acroporidae, which represented the majority (84%) of settled larvae. Settlement of Acroporidae to terracotta tiles averaged 0.11 cm-2, representing 34 ± 31.01 (mean ± SD) spat per tile, indicating an abundant supply of competent larvae to the study reefs. Settlement was highly variable among reefs and between years. Differences in settlement among locations partly corresponded to the local cover of adult Acroporidae, while substantial reductions in Acroporidae cover caused by tropical cyclones and floods resulted in a clear reduction in settlement. Much of the observed variability remained unexplained, although likely included variability in both connectivity to, and the fecundity of, adult Acroporidae. The responsiveness of settlement patterns to the decline in Acroporidae cover across all four regions indicates the importance of supply and connectivity, and the vulnerability towards region-wide disturbance. High spatial and temporal variability, in addition to the resource-intensive nature of sampling with settlement tiles, highlights the logistical difficulty of determining coral settlement over large spatial and temporal scales.",Prevalence and determinant factors of unintended pregnancy among pregnant women attending antenatal clinics of Addis Zemen hospital.,https://www.ncbi.nlm.nih.gov/pubmed/30699140,PloS one,2019 02 19,Unintended pregnancy is a pregnancy which is not wanted and/or not planed at the time of conception.

Little is known however about the global spatial distribution of the actors behind tropical deforestation. Newly available maps of global cropland field size offer an opportunity to gain understanding towards the spatial distribution of tropical deforestation actors. Here we use a map of global cropland field size and combine it with maps of forest loss to study the spatial association between field size and deforestation while accounting for other anthropogenic and geographical drivers of deforestation. We then use linear mixed-effects models and bootstrapping to determine what factors affect field sizes within deforested areas across all countries in the global tropics and subtropics. We find that field size within deforested areas is largely determined by country-level effects indicating the importance of socio-economic, cultural and institutional factors on the distribution of field sizes. Typically, small field sizes appear more commonly in deforested areas in Africa and Asia while the association was with larger field sizes in Australia and the Americas. In general, we find that smaller field sizes are associated with deforestation in protected areas and large field sizes with areas with lower agricultural value, although these results have low explanatory power. Our results suggest that the spatial patterns of actors behind deforestation are aggregated geographically which could help target conservation and sustainable land-use strategies.","Efficacy assessment of commercially available natural products and antibiotics, commonly used for mitigation of pathogenic Vibrio outbreaks in Ecuadorian Penaeus (Litopenaeus) vannamei hatcheries.",https://www.ncbi.nlm.nih.gov/pubmed/30699138,PloS one,2019 02 19,"Bacterial diseases cause high mortality in Penaeus (Litopenaeus) vannamei postlarvae.

This study evaluated through in vitro analyses the antimicrobial effectiveness of commercial therapeutic products used for P. vannamei bacterial diseases and antibiotics against pathogenic Vibrio strains circulating in Ecuadorian hatcheries. Twenty strains were isolated from 31 larvae samples with high bacterial counts from 10 hatcheries collected during mortality events. The strains virulence was verified through challenge tests with Artemia franciscana nauplii and P. vannamei postlarvae. Through 16S rRNA sequence analysis, strains showed a great similarity to the Vibrio sequences reported as pathogens, with 95% belonging to the Harveyi clade. Through antibiograms and minimal inhibitory concentration (MIC) in vitro tests we found that furazolidone, ciprofloxacin, chloramphenicol, norfloxacin, nalidixic acid, florfenicol, fosfomycin and enrofloxacin inhibited the growth of all or most of the strains. Less efficient antibiotics were penicillin, oxytetracycline and tetracycline. A multiple antibiotic resistance (MAR) index of 0.23 showed some level of resistance to antibiotics, with two MAR prevalent patterns (Penicillin-Oxytetracycline and Penicillin-Oxytetracycline-Tetracycline). From a total of 16 natural products (five probiotics, nine organic acids and two essential oils), only three (one probiotic, one organic acid and one essential oil) were effective to control most of the strains.

Demographic, clinical and microbiological data were compared between ceftriaxone susceptible and non-susceptible cases. Among 92 microbiologically identified pneumococcal isolates, ceftriaxone non-susceptible pneumococci (CNSP) accounted for 32 cases (34.8%). Some of these cases also showed levofloxacin resistance (25%, 8/32 isolates) and all CNSP cases were multidrug resistant. Compared to patients with ceftriaxone susceptible pneumococci (CSP), long-term care facility residents (odds ratio [OR] 7.0, 95% confidence interval [CI] 0.8-62.1) and patients with chronic lung (OR 4.1, 95% CI 1.1-15.0) and renal diseases (OR 9.1, 95% CI 1.2-70.5) were more common among those with CNSP on multivariate analysis. PPSV23-unique serotypes not included in PCV13 were more common in CNSP than in CSP (34.4% versus 13.3%, p = 0.02). Regarding genotypes, ST320 (10 cases), ST166 (7 cases) and ST8279 (3 cases) were dominant in CNSP, and ST8279 was only detected in previous long-term care facility residents. Clonal expansion and spread of CNSP strains should be monitored among patients with chronic lung/renal diseases and residents of long-term care facilities.","Tree rings as a proxy for seasonal precipitation variability and Early Neolithic settlement dynamics in Bavaria, Germany.",https://www.ncbi.nlm.nih.gov/pubmed/30699136,PloS one,2019 02 19,"Studying the dynamic of Neolithic settlement on a local scale and its connection to climate variability is often difficult due to missing on-site climate reconstructions from natural archives. Here we bring together archaeological settlement data and a regional climate reconstruction from precipitation-sensitive trees. Both archives hold information about regional settlement dynamics and hydroclimate variability spanning the time of the first farming communities, the so called Linearbandkeramik (LBK) in Bavaria, Germany. Precipitation-sensitive tree-ring series from subfossil oak are used to develop a spring-summer precipitation reconstruction (5700-4800 B.C.E.) representative for southern Germany. Early Neolithic settlement data from Bavaria, mainly for the duration of the LBK settlement activities, are critically evaluated and compared to this unique regional hydroclimate reconstruction as well as to reconstructions of Greenland temperature, summer sea surface temperature, delta 18O and global solar irradiance to investigate the potential impact of climate on Neolithic settlers and their settlement dynamic during the LBK. Our hydroclimate reconstruction demonstrates an extraordinarily high frequency of severe dry and wet spring-summer seasons during the entire LBK, with particularly high year-to-year variability from 5400 to 5101 B.C.E. and with lower fluctuations until 4801 B.C.E. A significant influence of regional climate on the dynamic of the LBK is possible (e.g. around 4960 B.C.E.), but should be interpreted very carefully due to asynchronous trends in settlement dynamics. Thus, we conclude that even when a climate proxy such as tree rings that has excellent spatio-temporal resolution is available, it remains difficult to establish potential connections between the settlement dynamic of the LBK and climate variability."

A total of 44 sediment samples was collected during summers of 1994 and 1995 along transects (east-west direction) and between 10 and 200 m water depth. Complex statistical analyses allow us to compare the abundance and composition of the LAs and DAs in function of depth, grain-size and total organic matter in all studied stations even in those where the numbers of individuals were rare in one or both assemblages. The highest densities and diversities of the LAs are found in the middle continental shelf on gravel deposits (coarse and very coarse sands) mostly due to the substrate stability, reduced deposition of fine sedimentary particles, availability of organic matter with high quality related to oceanic primary productivity likely induced by upwelling events, and oxygenated porewaters conditions. The DAs have, in general, higher densities and diversities than the LAs. In the outer continental shelf, the dissimilarity between both assemblages is higher due to the accumulation of tests, low dilution by sedimentary particles and scarcity of living foraminifera. Based on the comparison of LAs and DAs and considering the characteristics of the study area and the species ecology, it has been possible to understand the cause of temporal deviation between the LAs and DAs of benthic foraminifera. This deviation is much more pronounced in the inner shelf where the energy of the waves and the currents induce very dynamic sedimentary processes preventing the development of large LAs and the preservation of DAs. Some deviation also occurs in the middle shelf due to the seasonal loss of empty tests. The most well-preserved time-averaged DAs were found in the outer continental shelf.",Yellow fever virus is susceptible to sofosbuvir both in vitro and in vivo.,https://www.ncbi.nlm.nih.gov/pubmed/30699122,PLoS neglected tropical diseases,2019 04 23,"Yellow fever virus (YFV) is a member of the Flaviviridae family. In Brazil, yellow fever (YF) cases have increased dramatically in sylvatic areas neighboring urban zones in the last few years. Because of the high lethality rates associated with infection and absence of any antiviral treatments, it is essential to identify therapeutic options to respond to YFV outbreaks. Repurposing of clinically approved drugs represents the fastest alternative to discover antivirals for public health emergencies. Other Flaviviruses, such as Zika (ZIKV) and dengue (DENV) viruses, are susceptible to sofosbuvir, a clinically approved drug against hepatitis C virus (HCV). Our data showed that sofosbuvir docks onto YFV RNA polymerase using conserved amino acid residues for nucleotide binding. This drug inhibited the replication of both vaccine and wild-type strains of YFV on human hepatoma cells, with EC50 values around 5 μM. Sofosbuvir protected YFV-infected neonatal Swiss mice and adult type I interferon receptor knockout mice (A129-/-) from mortality and weight loss. Because of its safety profile in humans and significant antiviral effects in vitro and in mice, Sofosbuvir may represent a novel therapeutic option for the treatment of YF.

Localization to the apical junctional membrane is critical for Dachs function, and the adapter protein Vamana/Dlish and palmitoyl transferase Approximated are required for Dachs membrane localization. However, how Dachs levels are regulated is poorly understood. Here we identify the early girl gene as playing an essential role in Fat signaling by limiting the levels of Dachs protein. early girl mutants display overgrowth of the wings and reduced cross vein spacing, hallmark features of mutations affecting Fat signaling. Genetic experiments reveal that it functions in parallel with Fat to regulate Dachs. early girl encodes an E3 ubiquitin ligase, physically interacts with Dachs, and regulates its protein stability. Concomitant loss of early girl and approximated results in accumulation of Dachs and Vamana in cytoplasmic punctae, suggesting that it also regulates their trafficking to the apical membrane. Our findings establish a crucial role for early girl in Fat signaling, involving regulation of Dachs and Vamana, two key downstream effectors of this pathway.",Integrated seroprevalence-based assessment of Wuchereria bancrofti and Onchocerca volvulus in two lymphatic filariasis evaluation units of Mali with the SD Bioline Onchocerciasis/LF IgG4 Rapid Test.,https://www.ncbi.nlm.nih.gov/pubmed/30699120,PLoS neglected tropical diseases,2019 04 23,Mali has become increasingly interested in the evaluation of transmission of both Wuchereria bancrofti and Onchocerca volvulus as prevalences of both infections move toward their respective elimination targets.

We still know little about the biological and environmental factors that influence our navigational ability. Here, we investigated the frequency and sociodemographic determinants of wayfinding and their association with vestibular function in a representative cross-sectional sample (N = 783) of the adult German-speaking population. Wayfinding was assessed using the Wayfinding Strategy Scale, a self-report scale that produces two scores for each participant representing to what degree they rely on route-based or orientation (map-based) strategies. We were interested in the following research questions: (1) the frequency and determinants of wayfinding strategies in a population-based representative sample, (2) the relationship between vestibular function and strategy choice and (3) how sociodemographic factors influence general wayfinding ability as measured using a combined score from both strategy scores. Our linear regression models showed that being male, having a higher education, higher age and lower regional urbanization increased orientation strategy scores. Vertigo/dizziness reduced the scores of both the orientation and the route strategies. Using a novel approach, we grouped participants by their combined strategy scores in a multinomial regression model, to see whether individuals prefer one strategy over the other. The majority of individuals reported using either both or no strategy, instead of preferring one strategy over the other. Young age and reduced vestibular function were indicative of using no strategy. In summary, wayfinding ability depends on both biological and environmental factors; all sociodemographic factors except income. Over a third of the population, predominantly under the age of 35, does not successfully use either strategy. This represents a change in our wayfinding skills, which may result from the technological advances in navigational aids over the last few decades.",Measuring popularity of ecological topics in a temporal dynamical knowledge network.,https://www.ncbi.nlm.nih.gov/pubmed/30699118,PloS one,2019 02 19,"As interdisciplinary branches of ecology are developing rapidly in the 21st century, contents of ecological researches have become more abundant than ever before. Along with the exponential growth of number of published literatures, it is more and more difficult for ecologists to get a clear picture of their discipline. Nevertheless, the era of big data has brought us massive information of well documented historical literature and various techniques of data processing, which greatly facilitates the implementation of bibliometric analysis on ecology. Frequency has long been used as the primary metric in keyword analysis to detect ecological hotspots, however, this method could be somewhat biased. In our study, we have suggested a method called PAFit to measure keyword popularity, which considered ecology-related topics in a large temporal dynamical knowledge network, and found out the popularity of ecological topics follows the ""rich get richer"" and ""fit get richer"" mechanism. Feasibility of network analysis and its superiority over simply using frequency had been explored and justified, and PAFit was testified by its outstanding performance of prediction on the growth of frequency and degree. In addition, our research also encourages ecologists to consider their domain knowledge in a large dynamical network, and be ready to participate in interdisciplinary collaborations when necessary.","Impact of CodY protein on metabolism, sporulation and virulence in Clostridioides difficile ribotype 027.",https://www.ncbi.nlm.nih.gov/pubmed/30699117,PloS one,2019 03 29,"Toxin synthesis and endospore formation are two of the most critical factors that determine the outcome of infection by Clostridioides difficile. The two major toxins, TcdA and TcdB, are the principal factors causing damage to the host. Spores are the infectious form of C. difficile, permit survival of the bacterium during antibiotic treatment and are the predominant cell form that leads to recurrent infection. Toxin production and sporulation have their own specific mechanisms of regulation, but they share negative regulation by the global regulatory protein CodY. Determining the extent of such regulation and its detailed mechanism is important for understanding the linkage between two apparently independent biological phenomena and raises the possibility of creating new ways of limiting infection. The work described here shows that a codY null mutant of a hypervirulent (ribotype 027) strain is even more virulent than its parent in a mouse model of infection and that the mutant expresses most sporulation genes prematurely during exponential growth phase. Moreover, examining the expression patterns of mutants producing CodY proteins with different levels of residual activity revealed that expression of the toxin genes is dependent on total CodY inactivation, whereas most sporulation genes are turned on when CodY activity is only partially diminished. These results suggest that, in wild-type cells undergoing nutrient limitation, sporulation genes can be turned on before the toxin genes.",Lysine 27 of replication-independent histone H3.3 is required for Polycomb target gene silencing but not for gene activation.,https://www.ncbi.nlm.nih.gov/pubmed/30699116,PLoS genetics,2019 05 08,"Proper determination of cell fates depends on epigenetic information that is used to preserve memory of decisions made earlier in development. Post-translational modification of histone residues is thought to be a central means by which epigenetic information is propagated. In particular, modifications of histone H3 lysine 27 (H3K27) are strongly correlated with both gene activation and gene repression. H3K27 acetylation is found at sites of active transcription, whereas H3K27 methylation is found at loci silenced by Polycomb group proteins. The histones bearing these modifications are encoded by the replication-dependent H3 genes as well as the replication-independent H3.3 genes. Owing to differential rates of nucleosome turnover, H3K27 acetylation is enriched on replication-independent H3.3 histones at active gene loci, and H3K27 methylation is enriched on replication-dependent H3 histones across silenced gene loci. Previously, we found that modification of replication-dependent H3K27 is required for Polycomb target gene silencing, but it is not required for gene activation. However, the contribution of replication-independent H3.3K27 to these functions is unknown. Here, we used CRISPR/Cas9 to mutate the endogenous replication-independent H3.3K27 to a non-modifiable residue. Surprisingly, we find that H3.3K27 is also required for Polycomb target gene silencing despite the association of H3.3 with active transcription. However, the requirement for H3.3K27 comes at a later stage of development than that found for replication-dependent H3K27, suggesting a greater reliance on replication-independent H3.3K27 in post-mitotic cells. Notably, we find no evidence of global transcriptional defects in H3.3K27 mutants, despite the strong correlation between H3.3K27 acetylation and active transcription.",Inherent versus induced protein flexibility: Comparisons within and between apo and holo structures.,https://www.ncbi.nlm.nih.gov/pubmed/30699115,PLoS computational biology,2019 06 10,"Understanding how ligand binding influences protein flexibility is important, especially in rational drug design. Protein flexibility upon ligand binding is analyzed herein using 305 proteins with 2369 crystal structures with ligands (holo) and 1679 without (apo). Each protein has at least two apo and two holo structures for analysis. The inherent variation in structures with and without ligands is first established as a baseline. This baseline is then compared to the change in conformation in going from the apo to holo states to probe induced flexibility. The inherent backbone flexibility across the apo structures is roughly the same as the variation across holo structures. The induced backbone flexibility across apo-holo pairs is larger than that of the apo or holo states, but the increase in RMSD is less than 0.5 Å. Analysis of χ1 angles revealed a distinctly different pattern with significant influences seen for ligand binding on side-chain conformations in the binding site. Within the apo and holo states themselves, the variation of the χ1 angles is the same. However, the data combining both apo and holo states show significant displacements. Upon ligand binding, χ1 angles are frequently pushed to new orientations outside the range seen in the apo states. Influences on binding-site variation could not be easily attributed to features such as ligand size or x-ray structure resolution. By combining these findings, we find that most binding site flexibility is compatible with the common practice in flexible docking, where backbones are kept rigid and side chains are allowed some degree of flexibility.",Multigene phylogeny reveals a new Iranian earthworm genus (Lumbricidae: Philomontanus) with three new species.,https://www.ncbi.nlm.nih.gov/pubmed/30699114,PloS one,2019 02 19,"Lumbricidae taxonomy is vastly restricted by the morphological simplicity of earthworms and their lack of complex appendices. This has led to confusing results in the Lumbricidae classifications, which in turn, has hindered our ability to identify and assign new and cryptic species to the family. Here we propose the addition of a new Lumbricidae genus from the Zagros and Elburz Mountains of Iran, i.e. Philomontanus gen. nov, including three new species. Our taxonomic inferences were based on the phylogenetic analysis of two nuclear gene regions (28S rDNA and 18S rDNA) and 11 mitochondrial gene regions (16S rDNA, 12S rDNA, NADH dehydrogenase I, cytochrome oxidase subunits I and II and tRNAs Asn, Asp, Val, Leu, Ala and Ser). Philomontanus gen. nov comprises the earthworm species Philomontanus sarii sp. nov., Philomontanus mahmoudi sp. nov. and Philomontanus baloutchi sp. nov. These three species are morphologically similar to each other with only a few characters separating them (e.g. size, pigmentation and position of clitellum). Our findings support the adoption of an integrative approach including molecular information (e.g., DNA sequences) to aid earthworm classification and develop a robust taxonomy."

However, it is still unclear how this network structure modulates the evolution of cellular regulation. One would expect that mutations in central and highly connected modules of a network (so-called hubs) would often result in a breakdown and therefore be an evolutionary dead end. However, a new study by Koubkova-Yu and colleagues finds that in some circumstances, altering a hub can offer a quick evolutionary advantage. Specifically, changes in a hub can induce significant phenotypic changes that allow organisms to move away from a local fitness peak, whereas the fitness defects caused by the perturbed hub can be mitigated by mutations in its interaction partners. Together, the results demonstrate how network architecture shapes and facilitates evolutionary adaptation.","Epidemiologic Investigation of Burn Patients in Sichuan Province, China.",https://www.ncbi.nlm.nih.gov/pubmed/30699102,Medical science monitor : international medical journal of experimental and clinical research,2019 04 10,"BACKGROUND We investigated the epidemiology of patients admitted to the Burn Center of West China Hospital during 2011-2016, to provide measures for burn prevention. MATERIAL AND METHODS We conducted a retrospective review of patients admitted to the Burn Center of West China Hospital during 2011-2016. We collected information on patient demographics, burn etiology, burn extent, place of injury, education level, and burn knowledge of patients. RESULTS A total of 1323 patients (1033 males and 290 females), mean age 35.4 years (range 10 days to 91 years), were admitted to our burn center. Among all patients, 214 were children aged 0-14 years, 998 were adults aged 15-59 years, and 111 were elderly adults over age 60 years. Scalds were the predominant cause of pediatric burns; however, flame burns were most common among adults and elderly patients. The injury location varied by age, with most burns occurring at work among adults; however, most children and elderly patients were burned at home. Educational levels were lower among adults from rural areas than those from urban areas, but both groups had little first aid knowledge. Furthermore, rural patients had received less vocational education and training than urban patients. CONCLUSIONS There has been a decrease in burn incidence in Sichuan Province. Flame injury should be a focus of attention in all age groups. Prevention programs for adults in the workplace are imperative. Burn prevention programs should continue to improve living conditions, especially for elderly people.",Contextualizing Work-Based Assessments of Faculty and Residents: Is There a Relationship Between the Clinical Practice Environment and Assessments of Learners and Teachers?,https://www.ncbi.nlm.nih.gov/pubmed/30699101,Academic medicine : journal of the Association of American Medical Colleges,2019 01 30,"Competence is bound to context, yet seldom is environment explicitly considered in work-based assessments.

There are 2.2 million adults incarcerated in the United States and close to 6.6 million under correctional supervision on any day. Many of these people experience health inequalities and inadequate health care both in and out of correctional facilities. These numbers are reason enough to raise alarm among health care providers and criminal justice researchers about the need to conceptualize better ways to administer health care for these individuals. Using terms like ""convict,"" ""prisoner,"" ""parolee,"" and ""offender"" to describe these individuals increases the stigma that they already face. The authors propose that employing person-first language for justice-involved individuals would help to reduce the stigma they face during incarceration and after they are released. Coordinated, dignified, and multidisciplinary care is essential for this population given the high rates of morbidity and mortality they experience both in and out of custody and the many barriers that impede their successful integration with families and communities. Academic medicine can begin to address the mistrust that formerly incarcerated individuals often have toward the health care system by using the humanizing labels recommended in this Invited Commentary.",Design of the Texas Hepatocellular Carcinoma Consortium Cohort Study.,https://www.ncbi.nlm.nih.gov/pubmed/30699099,The American journal of gastroenterology,2019 03 06,The Texas Hepatocellular Carcinoma Consortium cohort study investigates risk factors of hepatocellular carcinoma (HCC) and biomarkers for early HCC detection in patients with liver cirrhosis.,Flunarizine as prophylaxis for episodic migraine: a systematic review with meta-analysis.,https://www.ncbi.nlm.nih.gov/pubmed/30699098,Pain,2019 04 08,"Based on few clinical trials, flunarizine is considered a first-line prophylactic treatment for migraine in several guidelines. In this meta-analysis, we examined the pooled evidence for its effectiveness, tolerability, and safety. Prospective randomized controlled trials of flunarizine as a prophylaxis against migraine were identified from a systematic literature search, and risk of bias was assessed for all included studies. Reduction in mean attack frequency was estimated by calculating the mean difference (MD), and a series of secondary outcomes-including adverse events (AEs)-were also analyzed. The database search yielded 879 unique records. Twenty-five studies were included in data synthesis. We scored 31/175 risk of bias items as ""high,"" with attrition as the most frequent bias. A pooled analysis estimated that flunarizine reduces the headache frequency by 0.4 attacks per 4 weeks compared with placebo (5 trials, 249 participants: MD -0.44; 95% confidence interval -0.61 to -0.26). Analysis also revealed that the effectiveness of flunarizine prophylaxis is comparable with that of propranolol (7 trials, 1151 participants, MD -0.08; 95% confidence interval -0.34 to 0.18). Flunarizine also seems to be effective in children. The most frequent AEs were sedation and weight increase. Meta-analyses were robust and homogenous, although several of the included trials potentially suffered from high risk of bias. Unfortunately, reporting of AEs was inconsistent and limited. In conclusion, pooled analysis of data from partially outdated trials shows that 10-mg flunarizine per day is effective and well tolerated in treating episodic migraine-supporting current guideline recommendations.",Islet-cell autoantigen 69 mediates the antihyperalgesic effects of electroacupuncture on inflammatory pain by regulating spinal glutamate receptor subunit 2 phosphorylation through protein interacting with C-kinase 1 in mice.,https://www.ncbi.nlm.nih.gov/pubmed/30699097,Pain,2019 04 08,"Electroacupuncture (EA) is widely used in clinical settings to reduce inflammatory pain. Islet-cell autoantigen 69 (ICA69) has been reported to regulate long-lasting hyperalgesia in mice. ICA69 knockout led to reduced protein interacting with C-kinase 1 (PICK1) expression and increased glutamate receptor subunit 2 (GluR2) phosphorylation at Ser880 in spinal dorsal horn. In this study, we evaluated the role of ICA69 in the antihyperalgesic effects of EA and the underlying mechanism through regulation of GluR2 and PICK1 in spinal dorsal horn. Hyperalgesia was induced in mice with subcutaneous plantar injection of complete Freund adjuvant (CFA) to cause inflammatory pain. Electroacupuncture was then applied for 30 minutes every other day after CFA injection. When compared with CFA group, paw withdrawal frequency of CFA+EA group was significantly decreased. Remarkable increases in Ica1 mRNA expression and ICA69 protein levels on the ipsilateral side were detected in the CFA+EA group. ICA69 expression reached the peak value around day 3. More importantly, ICA69 deletion impaired the antihyperalgesic effects of EA on GluR2-p, but PICK1 deletion could not. Injecting ICA69 peptide into the intrathecal space of ICA69-knockout mice mimicked the effects of EA analgesic and inhibited GluR2-p. Electroacupuncture had no effects on the total protein of PICK1 and GluR2. And, EA could increase the formation of ICA69-PICK1 complexes and decrease the amount of PICK1-GluR2 complexes. Our findings indicate that ICA69 mediates the antihyperalgesic effects of EA on CFA-induced inflammatory pain by regulating spinal GluR2 through PICK1 in mice.","Recognizing, diagnosing, and treating pediatric generalized anxiety disorder.",https://www.ncbi.nlm.nih.gov/pubmed/30699096,JAAPA : official journal of the American Academy of Physician Assistants,2019 05 13,"Generalized anxiety disorder (GAD), characterized by excessive worry or apprehension, can lead to significant distress or impairment in patients' social or occupational function but commonly is overlooked by primary care providers.

The adsorption could reach equilibrium in 100 min reaction. The equilibrium data were well described by the Langmuir and Freundlich model. After five recycles, the phosphate removal capacity of CMYGs biochar retained over 50%. Moreover, the XRD and FTIR analyses showed that the phosphate sorption mechanisms involved surface electrostatic attraction, inner-sphere complexation and precipitation reactions.

The changes to the standard are based on a wide range of experience gained in recent years in Germany and Europe. For the first time ever, the standard has been officially translated and published in English. This paper summarizes the new standard for secondary treatment of domestic wastewater with classical one-stage unsaturated vertical flow (VF) wetlands, VF wetlands with lava sand for treatment of wastewater from combined sewer systems, and actively aerated VF and horizontal flow (HF) flow wetlands. Two-stage unsaturated VF wetlands treating raw wastewater (French VF wetlands), are also included in the new standard. HF wetlands are no longer described in the standard for secondary treatment of domestic wastewater. This does not exclude their application.

A series of batch adsorption experiments indicated that the removal of toxic Cd(II) ions by the as-obtained composites as adsorbents was pH-dependent, rapid, proficient, better fitted to pseudo-second-order kinetics model and Langmuir monolayer adsorption isotherm model. Compared to the naked particles, magnetic bio-polymer composites exhibited promoted adsorption capacity. Competitive adsorption studies in binary solutions illustrated preferable selectivity of adsorbents toward Cd(II) ions in the presence of co-existing cations. More importantly, CS/CoFe2O4 and CS/NiFe2O4 had a satisfactory practical application in the removal of Cd(II) from real groundwater spiked with cadmium. The exhausted adsorbents could be regenerated efficiently by 0.5 M HNO3. The results from this study support that CS/CoFe2O4 and CS/NiFe2O4 prove excellent adsorption behavior for the removal of Cd(II) ions from aqueous media.",Isolation and identification of an aerobic denitrifying phosphorus removing bacteria and analysis of the factors influencing denitrification and phosphorus removal.,https://www.ncbi.nlm.nih.gov/pubmed/30699080,Water science and technology : a journal of the International Association on Water Pollution Research,2019 05 30,"Excessive emission of plant nutrients (such as nitrogen and phosphorus) into the water body can induce eutrophication. Therefore, how to control eutrophic water efficiently and economically is very important. In the paper, highly efficient aerobic denitrifying phosphorus removing J16 bacteria was isolated from the activated sludge of an aerobic bioreactor in Taiyuan municipal wastewater treatment plant by using the blue-white spot screening method, an aerobic phosphorus absorption test, nitrate reduction test, nitrogen removal experiments, and plate coating and streaking methods. Through 16S rDNA gene homology comparison and physiological and biochemical identification, the J16 strain was preliminarily identified as Escherichia coli, with a sequence similarity of 99%. The 16S rDNA sequence of strain J16 was submitted to GenBank (accession number: MF667015). The effect of temperature, pH, percentage of inoculum and phosphate-P (PO43--P) concentration on denitrification and phosphorus removal efficiency was investigated through a single-factor experiment. The optimum conditions of the J16 strain for denitrification and phosphorus removal were as follows: 30°C, neutral or weak alkaline (pH: 7.2-8), and 3% of inoculum, respectively. The denitrification and phosphorus removal efficiency of strain J16 was the highest when PO43--P and nitrate-N(NO3--N) concentrations were 8.9 and 69.31 mg/L, and the removal were 96.03% and 94.55%, respectively. In addition, strain J16 could reduce phosphoric acid to phosphine (PH3) and remove some phosphorus under hypoxia conditions. This is the first study to report the involvement of Escherichia coli in nitrogen and phosphorus removal under aerobic and hypoxia conditions. Based on the above results, the strain J16 can effectively remove nitrogen and phosphorus, and will be utilized in enhancing treatment of nitrogen and phosphorus-containing industrial wastewater and phosphorus reclamation.",Monochloramine dissipation in storm sewer systems: field testing and model development.,https://www.ncbi.nlm.nih.gov/pubmed/30699079,Water science and technology : a journal of the International Association on Water Pollution Research,2019 05 30,"Monochloramine (NH2Cl), as the dominant disinfectant in drinking water chloramination, can provide long-term disinfection in distribution systems. However, NH2Cl can also be discharged into storm sewer systems and cause stormwater contamination through outdoor tap water uses. In storm sewer systems, NH2Cl dissipation can occur by three pathways: (i) auto-decomposition, (ii) chemical reaction with stormwater components, and (iii) biological dissipation. In this research, a field NH2Cl dissipation test was conducted with continuous tap water discharge into a storm sewer. The results showed a fast decrease of NH2Cl concentration from the discharge point to the sampling point at the beginning of the discharge period, while the rate of decrease decreased as time passed. Based on the various pathways involved in NH2Cl decay and the field testing results, a kinetic model was developed. To describe the variation of the NH2Cl dissipation rates during the field testing, a time coefficient fT was introduced, and the relationship between fT and time was determined. After calibration through the fT coefficient, the kinetic model described the field NH2Cl dissipation process well. The model developed in this research can assist in the regulation of tap water outdoor discharge and contribute to the protection of the aquatic environment.",Heat recovery during treatment of highly concentrated wastewater: economic evaluation and influencing factors.,https://www.ncbi.nlm.nih.gov/pubmed/30699078,Water science and technology : a journal of the International Association on Water Pollution Research,2019 05 30,"This paper assesses the economics of heat recovery from biological wastewater treatment plants (WWTPs) treating concentrated wastewater, as higher concentrations result in higher heat generation in the treatment basin. A heat balance model has been applied to calculate the amount of recoverable heat from the system and the effect of the heat extraction capacity on the economics of a heat pump installation, evaluated using the internal rate of return. A sensitivity analysis has been performed to evaluate the effect of several parameters on the economics of heat recovery in this type of WWTP: the electricity price, the price of the fuel substituted by heating savings, the investment costs, the coefficient of performance (COP) and the amount of heat extracted from the system. It was calculated that the heat pump capacity has to be high enough to recover a significant amount of heat, but low enough to improve the economics of the system. The economic performance of the system is very dependent on the energy prices of both electrical power to run the heat pump and the fuel (heat) cost substituted by the heat pump.",Consistent production of high quality PHA using activated sludge harvested from full scale municipal wastewater treatment - PHARIO.,https://www.ncbi.nlm.nih.gov/pubmed/30699077,Water science and technology : a journal of the International Association on Water Pollution Research,2019 05 30,"Production of polyhydroxyalkanoate (PHA) biopolymers by mixed microbial cultures concurrent to wastewater treatment is a valorization route for residual organic material. This development has been at pilot scale since 2011 using industrial and municipal organic residuals. Previous experience was the basis for a PHA production demonstration project: PHARIO. PHARIO was centred on processing surplus activated sludge biomass from the Bath full-scale municipal wastewater treatment plant in the Netherlands to produce PHA. Full-scale surplus activated sludge was fed to a pilot facility to produce PHA rich biomass using fermented volatile fatty acid (VFA) rich liquors from industry or primary sludge sources. A PHA rich biomass with on average 0.41 gPHA/gVSS was obtained with reproducible thermal properties and high thermal stability. A routine kilogram scale production was established over 10 months and the polymer material properties and market potential were evaluated. Surplus full-scale activated sludge, over four seasons of operations, was a reliable raw material to consistently and predictably produce commercial quality grades of PHA. Polymer type and properties were systematic functions of the mean co-polymer content. The mean co-polymer content was predictably determined by the fermented feedstock composition. PHARIO polymers were estimated to have a significantly lower environmental impact compared to currently available (bio)plastics.",A laboratory study to determine the use of polluted river sediment as a substrate for extensive green roofs.,https://www.ncbi.nlm.nih.gov/pubmed/30699076,Water science and technology : a journal of the International Association on Water Pollution Research,2019 05 30,"In this study, laboratory-scale green (e.g. living) roof platforms were established to assess the potential use of polluted river sediment in their substrate mixture. The mean runoff retention of the green roof platforms, which contained peat and/or river sediment, after 11 artificial rainfall events was >72%, significantly higher than traditional roofs. However, green roof platforms that had been filled with peat soil showed chemical oxygen demand (COD), total nitrogen (TN) and total phosphorus (TP) leaching. Green roofs that had used river sediment showed good leaching control for COD, TN and TP. The cumulative leaching masses from the green roofs contained 30% (COD), 42% (TN) and 47% (TP) as much as the total leaching mass from traditional roofs, and the Cu, Zn, Cd and Pb leaching risk from green roofs when river sediments are used as part of a substrate mixture was relatively low.

However, large greenhouse gas emissions have been panobserved in many cases. A novel mesh separated reactor, developed to allow continuous operation of deammonification at smaller scale without external biomass selection, was compared to a conventional single-chamber deammonification sequencing batch reactor (SBR), where both were equally-sized pilot-scale reactors. The mesh reactor consisted of an aerated and an anoxic zone separated by a mesh. The resulting differences in the structure of the microbial community were detected by next-generation sequencing. When both systems were operated in a sequencing batch mode, both systems had comparable nitrous oxide emission factors in the range of 4% to 5% of the influent nitrogen load. A significant decrease was observed after switching from sequencing batch mode to continuous operation.",Reference values of conditioned pain modulation.,https://www.ncbi.nlm.nih.gov/pubmed/30699074,Scandinavian journal of pain,2019 04 04,"Background and aims Endogenous pain modulation can be studied in humans by conditioned pain modulation (CPM): pain induced by a test stimulus is attenuated by a distantly applied noxious conditioning stimulus. The detection of impaired CPM in individual patients is of potential importance to understand the pathophysiology and predict outcomes. However, it requires the availability of reference values. Methods We determined reference values of CPM in 146 pain-free subjects. Pressure and electrical stimulation were the test stimuli. For electrical stimuli, we recorded both pain threshold and threshold for the nociceptive withdrawal reflex. Cold pressor test was the conditioning stimulus. The 5th, 10th and 25th percentiles for the three tests were computed by quantile regression analyses. Results The average thresholds increased after the conditioning stimulus for all three tests. However, a subset of subjects displayed a decrease in thresholds during the conditioning stimulus. This produced negative values for most of the computed percentiles. Conclusions This study determined percentile reference values of CPM that can be used to better phenotype patients for clinical and research purposes. The negative value of percentiles suggests that a slightly negative CPM effect can be observed in pain-free volunteers. Implications Pain facilitation rather than inhibition during the conditioning stimulus occurs in some pain-free volunteers and may not necessarily represent an abnormal finding.",Muscle stretching - the potential role of endogenous pain inhibitory modulation on stretch tolerance.,https://www.ncbi.nlm.nih.gov/pubmed/30699073,Scandinavian journal of pain,2019 04 04,"Background and aims The effect of stretching on joint range of motion is well documented and is primarily related to changes in the tolerance to stretch, but the mechanisms underlying this change are still largely unknown. The aim of this study was to investigate the influence of a remote, painful stimulus on stretch tolerance. Methods Thirty-four healthy male subjects were recruited and randomly assigned to an experimental pain group (n=17) or a control group (n=17). Passive knee extension range of motion, the activity of hamstring muscles and passive resistive torque were measured with subjects in a seated position. Three consecutive measures were performed with a 5-min interval between. A static stretch protocol was utilized in both groups to examine the effect of stretching and differences in stretch tolerance between groups. Following this, the pain-group performed a cold pressor test which is known to engage the endogenous pain inhibitory system after which measurements were repeated. Results A significant increase in knee extension range of motion was found in the pain group compared with controls (ANCOVA: p<0.05). No difference was found in muscle activity or passive resistive torque between groups (ANCOVA p>0.091). Conclusions Passive knee extension range of motion following stretching increased when following a distant, painful stimulus, potentially engaging the endogenous pain inhibitory systems. Current findings indicate a link between increased tolerance to stretch and endogenous pain inhibition. Implications The current findings may have implications for clinical practice as they indicate that a distant painful stimulus can influence range of motion in healthy individuals. This implies that the modulation of pain has significance for the efficacy of stretching which is important knowledge when prescribing stretching as part of rehabilitation.","The Oslo University Hospital Pain Registry: development of a digital chronic pain registry and baseline data from 1,712 patients.",https://www.ncbi.nlm.nih.gov/pubmed/30699072,Scandinavian journal of pain,2019 04 04,"Background and aims Chronic pain is a leading cause to years lived with disability worldwide. However, few of the interventions used in pain medicine have proven efficacy, and evidence from the existing studies may not be valid for the general pain population. Therefore, it is of utmost need that we describe chronic pain conditions in their most relevant aspects, their various guises, as well as the real world outcomes of our clinical interventions. The most obvious and crude way to make these assessments are through large registries where patient characteristics, treatment characteristics (including but not limited to what, when, how often and by whom), treatment outcomes and patient outcomes are scrutinized and recorded. Methods and results This article describes in detail the design and baseline data of the comprehensive Oslo University Hospital Pain Registry (OPR). OPR is the local registry of the largest university and interdisciplinary outpatient pain clinic in Norway. Data registration started in October 2015, and approximately 1,000 patients are assessed and treated at the clinic each year. During the first 2 years of running the OPR (through September 2017), a total of 1,712 patient baseline reports were recorded from 2,001 patients. Clinicians enter data about relevant treatments and interventions, while patients provide self-reported data on aspects related to pain and pain management. The patients complete an electronic registration immediately before their first consultation at the outpatient pain clinic. The baseline questions of the OPR cover: Basic demographics; The Modified Oswestry Disability Index to assess general function; A pain drawing to assess pain location; Questions regarding the temporal aspects of pain; Six 0-10 Numeric Rating Scales to assess pain intensity and bothersomeness; The EQ-5D-5L to measure health-related quality of life; The Hopkins Symptom Check List-25 to assess psychological distress; A single question about self-rated health; The general self-efficacy scale to assess the patient's perceived self-efficacy; The Bodily Distress Syndrome checklist to assess functional disorders; The Injustice Experience Questionnaire to assess whether the patients experience injustice; Chalder Fatigue Questionnaire to assess fatigue; The Insomnia Severity Index to assesses the levels of insomnia symptoms; The Pain Catastrophizing Scale to measure pain catastrophizing and exaggerated negative orientation toward pain stimuli and pain experience; And the SF36v2 to assess patients' self-report of generic health and wellbeing. The baseline data show that chronic pain patients have a high degree of negative impact in all aspects of their lives. Conclusions and implications The OPR is the most comprehensive pain registry for multidisciplinary and interdisciplinary outpatient pain clinics in Norway. Detailed design of the registry and key baseline data are presented. Registries are of great value in that they enable real world effectiveness outcomes for patients with chronic pain conditions. The OPR can thus serve as a model for similar initiatives elsewhere. The OPR cohort may also serve as a historical control in future studies, both with experimental and observational design."

Obesity is also associated with the dysregulation of central neurocircuits involved in the control of autonomic, metabolic, and cognitive functions. Systemic inflammation associated with diet-induced obesity (DIO) has been proposed to be responsible for the development of these comorbidities as well as the dysregulation of central neurocircuits. A growing body of evidence suggests, however, that exposure to a high-fat diet (HFD) may cause neuroinflammation and astroglial activation even before systemic inflammation develops, which may be sufficient to cause dysregulation of central neurocircuits involved in energy homeostasis before the development of obesity. The purpose of this review is to summarize the current literature exploring astroglial-dependent modulation of central circuits following exposure to HFD and DIO, including not only dysregulation of neurocircuits involved in energy homeostasis and feeding behavior, but also the dysregulation of learning, memory, mood, and reward pathways.",A Randomized Trial of E-Cigarettes versus Nicotine-Replacement Therapy.,https://www.ncbi.nlm.nih.gov/pubmed/30699054,The New England journal of medicine,2019 05 15,"E-cigarettes are commonly used in attempts to stop smoking, but evidence is limited regarding their effectiveness as compared with that of nicotine products approved as smoking-cessation treatments.",Adrenergic agonist induces rhythmic firing in quiescent cardiac preganglionic neurons in nucleus ambiguous via activation of intrinsic membrane excitability.,https://www.ncbi.nlm.nih.gov/pubmed/30699052,Journal of neurophysiology,2019 05 01,"Cholinergic vagal nerves projecting from neurons in the brain stem nucleus ambiguus (NAm) play a predominant role in cardiac parasympathetic pacemaking control. Central adrenergic signaling modulates the tone of this vagal output; however, the exact excitability mechanisms are not fully understood. We investigated responses of NAm neurons to adrenergic agonists using in vitro mouse brain stem slices. Preganglionic NAm neurons were identified by ChAT-tdTomato fluorescence in young adult transgenic mice, and their cardiac projection was confirmed by retrograde dye tracing. Juxtacellular recordings detected sparse or absent spontaneous action potentials (AP) in NAm neurons. However, bath application of epinephrine or norepinephrine strongly and reversibly activated most NAm neurons regardless of their basal firing rate. Epinephrine was more potent than norepinephrine, and this activation largely depends on α1-adrenoceptors. Interestingly, adrenergic activation of NAm neurons does not require an ionotropic synaptic mechanism, because postsynaptic excitatory or inhibitory receptor blockade did not occlude the excitatory effect, and bath-applied adrenergic agonists did not alter excitatory or inhibitory synaptic transmission. Instead, adrenergic agonists significantly elevated intrinsic membrane excitability to facilitate generation of recurrent action potentials. T-type calcium current and hyperpolarization-activated current are involved in this excitation pattern, although not required for spontaneous AP induction by epinephrine. In contrast, pharmacological blockade of persistent sodium current significantly inhibited the adrenergic effects. Our results demonstrate that central adrenergic signaling enhances the intrinsic excitability of NAm neurons and that persistent sodium current is required for this effect. This central balancing mechanism may counteract excessive peripheral cardiac excitation during increased sympathetic tone. NEW & NOTEWORTHY Cardiac preganglionic cholinergic neurons in the nucleus ambiguus (NAm) are responsible for slowing cardiac pacemaking. This study identified that adrenergic agonists can induce rhythmic action potentials in otherwise quiescent cholinergic NAm preganglionic neurons in brain stem slice preparation. The modulatory influence of adrenaline on central parasympathetic outflow may contribute to both physiological and deleterious cardiovascular regulation.",A Motor Theory of Sleep-Wake Control: Arousal-Action Circuit.,https://www.ncbi.nlm.nih.gov/pubmed/30699051,Annual review of neuroscience,2019 01 30,"Wakefulness, rapid eye movement (REM) sleep, and non-rapid eye movement (NREM) sleep are characterized by distinct electroencephalogram (EEG), electromyogram (EMG), and autonomic profiles. The circuit mechanism coordinating these changes during sleep-wake transitions remains poorly understood. The past few years have witnessed rapid progress in the identification of REM and NREM sleep neurons, which constitute highly distributed networks spanning the forebrain, midbrain, and hindbrain. Here we propose an arousal-action circuit for sleep-wake control in which wakefulness is supported by separate arousal and action neurons, while REM and NREM sleep neurons are part of the central somatic and autonomic motor circuits. This model is well supported by the currently known sleep and wake neurons. It can also account for the EEG, EMG, and autonomic profiles of wake, REM, and NREM states and several key features of their transitions. The intimate association between the sleep and autonomic/somatic motor control circuits suggests that a primary function of sleep is to suppress motor activity.

Here, we review the genes controlling the development and function of the peripheral and central auditory systems, focusing on those with demonstrated intrinsic roles in both systems and highlighting the current underappreciation of these genes.

Despite a century of study, it is yet unclear what mechanism underlies this gestalt similarity grouping. One recent proposal is that similarity grouping-for example, seeing a red, vertical, or square group-is just global selection of those features. Although parsimonious, this account makes the counterintuitive prediction that similarity grouping is strictly serial: A green group cannot be constructed at the same time as a red group. We tested this prediction with a novel measure-a grouping illusion within number-estimation tasks that should work only if participants simultaneously construct groups-and found the strongest evidence yet in favor of serial feature-based attention ( Ns = 14, 12, and 12 for Experiment 1, Experiment 2, and Experiment 3, respectively).",The adaptor protein melanophilin regulates dynamic myosin-Va:cargo interaction and dendrite development in melanocytes.,https://www.ncbi.nlm.nih.gov/pubmed/30699046,Molecular biology of the cell,2019 05 15,"The regulation of organelle transport by the cytoskeleton is fundamental for eukaryotic survival. Cytoskeleton motors are typically modular proteins with conserved motor and diverse cargo-binding domains. Motor:cargo interactions are often indirect and mediated by adaptor proteins, for example, Rab GTPases. Rab27a, via effector melanophilin (Mlph), recruits myosin-Va (MyoVa) to melanosomes and thereby disperses them into melanocyte dendrites. To better understand how adaptors regulate motor:cargo interaction, we used single melanosome fluorescence recovery after photobleaching (smFRAP) to characterize the association kinetics among MyoVa, its adaptors, and melanosomes. We found that MyoVa and Mlph rapidly recovered after smFRAP, whereas Rab27a did not, indicating that MyoVa and Mlph dynamically associate with melanosomes and Rab27a does not. This suggests that dynamic Rab27a:effector interaction rather than Rab27a melanosome:cytosol cycling regulates MyoVa:melanosome association. Accordingly, a Mlph-Rab27a fusion protein reduced MyoVa smFRAP, indicating that it stabilized melanosomal MyoVa. Finally, we tested the functional importance of dynamic MyoVa:melanosome interaction. We found that whereas a MyoVa-Rab27a fusion protein dispersed melanosomes in MyoVa-deficient cells, dendrites were significantly less elongated than in wild-type cells. Given that dendrites are the prime sites of melanosome transfer from melanocytes to keratinocytes, we suggest that dynamic MyoVa:melanosome interaction is important for pigmentation in vivo.",A method of quantifying centrosomes at the single-cell level in human normal and cancer tissue.,https://www.ncbi.nlm.nih.gov/pubmed/30699045,Molecular biology of the cell,2019 05 15,"Centrosome abnormalities are emerging hallmarks of cancer. The overproduction of centrosomes (known as centrosome amplification) has been reported in a variety of cancers and is currently being explored as a promising target for therapy. However, to understand different types of centrosome abnormalities and their impact on centrosome function during tumor progression, as well as to identify tumor subtypes that would respond to the targeting of a centrosome abnormality, a reliable method for accurately quantifying centrosomes in human tissue samples is needed. Here, we established a method of quantifying centrosomes at a single-cell level in different types of human tissue samples. We tested multiple anti-centriole and pericentriolar-material antibodies to identify bona fide centrosomes and multiplexed these with cell border markers to identify individual cells within the tissue. High-resolution microscopy was used to generate multiple Z-section images, allowing us to acquire whole cell volumes in which to scan for centrosomes. The normal cells within the tissue serve as internal positive controls. Our method provides a simple, accurate way to distinguish alterations in centrosome numbers at the level of single cells.",Effects of tonic muscle pain on fusimotor control of human muscle spindles during isometric ankle dorsiflexion.,https://www.ncbi.nlm.nih.gov/pubmed/30699044,Journal of neurophysiology,2019 03 25,"Studies on anesthetized animals have revealed that nociceptors can excite fusimotor neurons and thereby change the sensitivity of muscle spindles to stretch; such nociceptive reflexes have been suggested to underlie the mechanisms that lead to chronic musculoskeletal pain syndromes. However, the validity of the ""vicious cycle"" hypothesis in humans has yielded results contrasting with those found in animals. Given that spindle firing rates are much lower in humans than in animals, it is possible that some of the discrepancies between human experimental data and those obtained in animals could be explained by differences in background fusimotor drive when the leg muscles are relaxed. We examined the effects of tonic muscle pain during voluntary contractions of the ankle dorsiflexors. Unitary recordings were obtained from 10 fusimotor-driven muscle spindle afferents (6 primary, 4 secondary) supplying the ankle dorsiflexors via a microelectrode inserted percutaneously into the common peroneal nerve. A series of 1-min weak contractions was performed at rest and during 1 h of muscle pain induced by intramuscular infusion of 5% hypertonic saline into the tibialis anterior muscle. We did not observe any statistically significant increases in muscle spindle firing rates of six afferents followed during tonic muscle pain, although discharge variability increased slightly. Furthermore, a participant's capacity to maintain a constant level of force, while relying on proprioceptive feedback in the absence of visual feedback, was not compromised during pain. We conclude that nociceptive inputs from contracting muscle do not excite fusimotor neurons during voluntary isometric contractions in humans. NEW & NOTEWORTHY Data obtained in the cat have shown that muscle pain causes a marked increase in the firing of muscle spindles, attributed to a nociceptor-driven fusimotor reflex. However, our studies of muscle spindles in relaxed leg muscles failed to find any effect on spindle discharge. Here we showed that experimental muscle pain failed to increase the firing of muscle spindle afferents during weak voluntary contractions, when fusimotor drive sufficient to increase their firing is present."

To facilitate the adoption of multilevel interventions to reduce health disparities, we outline areas of need in filling existing operational challenges to the design and assessment of multilevel interventions. We discuss areas of development that address overarching constructs inherent in multilevel interventions, with a particular focus on their application to minority health and health disparities. Our approach will prove useful to researchers, as it allows them to integrate information related to health disparities research into the framework of broader constructs with which they are familiar. We urge researchers to prioritize building transdisciplinary teams and the skills needed to overcome the challenges in designing and assessing multilevel interventions, as even small contributions can accelerate progress toward improving minority health and reducing health disparities. To make substantial progress, however, a concerted and strategic effort, including work to advance analytic techniques and measures, is needed.",The National Institute on Minority Health and Health Disparities Research Framework.,https://www.ncbi.nlm.nih.gov/pubmed/30699025,American journal of public health,2019 02 07,"We introduce the National Institute on Minority Health and Health Disparities (NIMHD) research framework, a product that emerged from the NIMHD science visioning process. The NIMHD research framework is a multilevel, multidomain model that depicts a wide array of health determinants relevant to understanding and addressing minority health and health disparities and promoting health equity. We describe the conceptual underpinnings of the framework and define its components. We also describe how the framework can be used to assess minority health and health disparities research as well as priorities for the future. Finally, we describe how fiscal year 2015 research project grants funded by NIMHD map onto the framework, and we identify gaps and opportunities for future minority health and health disparities research.",Building the Evidence Base to Inform Planned Intervention Adaptations by Practitioners Serving Health Disparity Populations.,https://www.ncbi.nlm.nih.gov/pubmed/30699023,American journal of public health,2019 02 07,"Many evidence-based interventions (EBIs) have been developed to prevent or treat major health conditions. However, many EBIs have exhibited limited adoption, reach, and sustainability when implemented in diverse community settings. This limitation is especially pronounced in low-resource settings that serve health disparity populations. Often, practitioners identify problems with existing EBIs originally developed and tested with populations different from their target population and introduce needed adaptations to make the intervention more suitable. Although some EBIs have been extensively adapted for diverse populations and evaluated, most local adaptations to improve fit for health disparity populations are not well documented or evaluated. As a result, empirical evidence is often lacking regarding the potential effectiveness of specific adaptations practitioners may be considering. We advocate an expansion in the emphasis of adaptation research from researcher-led interventions to research that informs practitioner-led adaptations. By presenting a research vision and strategies needed to build this area of science, we aim to inform research that facilitates successful adaptation and equitable implementation and delivery of EBIs that reduce health disparities.",Life Course Approaches to the Causes of Health Disparities.,https://www.ncbi.nlm.nih.gov/pubmed/30699022,American journal of public health,2019 02 07,"Reducing health disparities requires an understanding of the mechanisms that generate disparities. Life course approaches to health disparities leverage theories that explain how socially patterned physical, environmental, and socioeconomic exposures at different stages of human development shape health within and across generations and can therefore offer substantial insight into the etiology of health disparities. Life course approaches are informed by developmental and structural perspectives. Developmental perspectives emphasize how socially patterned exposures to risk factors during sensitive life stages shift health trajectories, whereas structural perspectives emphasize how social identity and position within socially patterned environments disproportionately allocate risk factors and resources, resulting in altered health trajectories. We conclude that the science of health disparities will be advanced by integrating life course approaches into etiologic and intervention research on health disparities. The following 4 strategies are offered to guide in this process: (1) advance the understanding of multiple exposures and their interactions, (2) integrate life course approaches into the understanding of biological mechanisms, (3) explore transgenerational transmission of health disparities, and (4) integrate life course approaches into health disparities interventions.",Advancing Health Services Research to Eliminate Health Care Disparities.,https://www.ncbi.nlm.nih.gov/pubmed/30699021,American journal of public health,2019 02 07,"Findings from health services research highlight continuing health care disparities in the United States, especially in the areas of access to health care and quality of care. Although attention to health care disparities has increased, considerable knowledge gaps still exist. A better understanding of how cultural, behavioral, and health system factors converge and contribute to unequal access and differential care is needed. Research-informed approaches for reducing health care disparities that are feasible and capable of sustained implementation are needed to inform policymakers. More important, for health equity to be achieved, it is essential to create a health care system that provides access, removes barriers to care, and provides equally effective treatment to all persons living in the United States.",Structural Interventions to Reduce and Eliminate Health Disparities.,https://www.ncbi.nlm.nih.gov/pubmed/30699019,American journal of public health,2019 05 08,"Health disparities research in the United States over the past 2 decades has yielded considerable progress and contributed to a developing evidence base for interventions that tackle disparities in health status and access to care. However, health disparity interventions have focused primarily on individual and interpersonal factors, which are often limited in their ability to yield sustained improvements. Health disparities emerge and persist through complex mechanisms that include socioeconomic, environmental, and system-level factors. To accelerate the reduction of health disparities and yield enduring health outcomes requires broader approaches that intervene upon these structural determinants. Although an increasing number of innovative programs and policies have been deployed to address structural determinants, few explicitly focused on their impact on minority health and health disparities. Rigorously evaluated, evidence-based structural interventions are needed to address multilevel structural determinants that systemically lead to and perpetuate social and health inequities. This article highlights examples of structural interventions that have yielded health benefits, discusses challenges and opportunities for accelerating improvements in minority health, and proposes recommendations to foster the development of structural interventions likely to advance health disparities research.",Behavioral Interventions Using Consumer Information Technology as Tools to Advance Health Equity.,https://www.ncbi.nlm.nih.gov/pubmed/30699018,American journal of public health,2019 06 10,"The digital divide related to consumer information technologies (CITs) has diminished, thus increasing the potential to use CITs to overcome barriers of access to health interventions as well as to deliver interventions situated in the context of daily lives.

Literature and case examples are summarized to demonstrate the use of mHealth, telehealth, and social media as behavioral intervention platforms in health disparity populations, identify challenges to achieving their use, describe strategies for overcoming the challenges, and recommend future directions. The evidence base is emerging. However, challenges in design, implementation, and evaluation must be addressed for the promise to be fulfilled.

Time is fundamental to health promotion and human agency, as in having time to exercise and maintain social relationships. Further, scarcity in time is related to stress and illness. Time is also racialized, such that racial/ethnic minorities often have less free time and suffer a time penalty in multiple facets of life. Such penalties manifest in problems such as greater time in prison or more time spent accessing services. We argue that time may be a social determinant of health that is shaped by racism across the life course. We focus on three aspects: time as age, time as exposure, and time as a resource and privilege. We distinguish between chronological age, biological age, and social age. We discuss issues of accelerated aging and potential interconnections with critical periods. We also examine racial inequities in time. By more deeply considering time, we may advance our understanding of racial inequities in health.",Methodological Approaches to Understanding Causes of Health Disparities.,https://www.ncbi.nlm.nih.gov/pubmed/30699015,American journal of public health,2019 02 07,"Understanding health disparity causes is an important first step toward developing policies or interventions to eliminate disparities, but their nature makes identifying and addressing their causes challenging. Potential causal factors are often correlated, making it difficult to distinguish their effects. These factors may exist at different organizational levels (e.g., individual, family, neighborhood), each of which needs to be appropriately conceptualized and measured. The processes that generate health disparities may include complex relationships with feedback loops and dynamic properties that traditional statistical models represent poorly. Because of this complexity, identifying disparities' causes and remedies requires integrating findings from multiple methodologies. We highlight analytic methods and designs, multilevel approaches, complex systems modeling techniques, and qualitative methods that should be more broadly employed and adapted to advance health disparities research and identify approaches to mitigate them.",The Importance of Evaluating Health Disparities Research.,https://www.ncbi.nlm.nih.gov/pubmed/30699014,American journal of public health,2019 02 07,"Health disparity populations are socially disadvantaged, and the multiple levels of discrimination they often experience mean that their characteristics and attributes differ from those of the mainstream. Programs and policies targeted at reducing health disparities or improving minority health must consider these differences. Despite the importance of evaluating health disparities research to produce high-quality data that can guide decision-making, it is not yet a customary practice. Although health disparities evaluations incorporate the same scientific methods as all evaluations, they have unique components such as population characteristics, sociocultural context, and the lack of health disparity common indicators and metrics that must be considered in every phase of the research. This article describes evaluation strategies grouped into 3 components: formative (needs assessments and process), design and methodology (multilevel designs used in real-world settings), and summative (outcomes, impacts, and cost). Each section will describe the standards for each component, discuss the unique health disparity aspects, and provide strategies from the National Institute on Minority Health and Health Disparities Metrics and Measures Visioning Workshop (April 2016) to advance the evaluation of health disparities research."

The dermal route is attractive for local and systemic delivery of drugs, however; permeation, penetration, and access to deeper skin layers are restricted due to the barrier function of the stratum corneum (SC). Solid lipid nanoparticles present several benefits for topical delivery for therapeutic applications, especially via the follicular route. Hair follicles, surrounded by a close network of blood capillaries and dendritic cells, are an important target for delivery of antimicrobials and present a unique microbial nidus for endogenous infections in situations where the barrier is disrupted, such as after surgery, for example, triclosan, a broad-spectrum antimicrobial agent, was encapsulated into nanoparticles using glyceryl behenate and glyceryl palmitostearate (GP) solid lipids, and incorporating Transcutol P, a known permeation enhancer at different ratios. Optimised formulation was stable over 90 d and in vitro permeation studies using full thickness porcine ear skin showed that the lipid-based nanoparticles enhanced delivery of triclosan into the skin and could direct the agent towards hair follicles, indicating their potential as a carrier system for antiseptic dermal delivery.",The Complexity of Compliance in Sample Management: A Review of Key Issues Impacting Small-Molecule and Biological Sample Management in Early Drug Discovery.,https://www.ncbi.nlm.nih.gov/pubmed/30699001,SLAS technology,2019 05 20,"The discovery of new medicines has become increasingly more challenging and requires significant collaboration between pharma, biotech, academia, and technology to be successful.

The high level of diversity resulting from this process posed technical limitations that previously limited the comprehensive analysis of adaptive immune recognition. Advances over the last ten years have produced data and approaches allowing insights into how T cells develop, evolutionary signatures of recombination and selection, and the features of T cell receptors that mediate epitope-specific binding and T cell activation. The size and complexity of these data have necessitated the generation of novel computational and analytical approaches, which are transforming how T cell immunology is conducted.

Many types of laboratory automation exist that greatly reduce the effort needed to utilize microplates; however, there are cases where the use of such automation is not feasible or practical. In these instances, researchers must work in an environment where liquid handling operations are performed manually with handheld pipetting devices. This type of work is tedious and error-prone as it relies on researchers to manually track a significant amount of metadata, including transfer volumes, plate barcodes, well contents, and well locations. To address this challenge, we have developed an open-source, semiautomated benchtop system that facilitates manual pipetting using visual indicators. This device streamlines the process of identifying the location of wells so that the researcher can perform manual transfers in a more efficient, reliable, and accurate manner. This system utilizes a graphical user interface that allows the user to load worklists and then issues commands to illuminate wells of interest, providing a visual indicator for users to follow in real time.

After being incubated with TMVs, normal human gingival fibroblasts exhibited a phenotype switch to cancer-associated fibroblasts and underwent a degradation of caveolin 1 (CAV1) through the ERK1/2-activation pathway. CAV1 degradation further induced the metabolic switch to aerobic glycolysis in the fibroblasts. The microvesicle-activated fibroblasts absorbed more glucose and produced more lactate. The migration and invasion of oral squamous cell carcinoma (OSCC) were promoted after being cocultured with the activated fibroblasts. Fibroblast-cancer cell glycometabolic coupling ring mediated by monocarboxylate transporter (MCT) 4 and MCT1 was then proved in the tumor microenvironment. Results indicated a mechanism for tumor progression by the crosstalk between tumor cells and stromal cells through the reverse Warburg effect via TMVs, thereby identifying potential targets for OSCC prevention and treatment.-Jiang, E., Xu, Z., Wang, M., Yan, T., Huang, C., Zhou, X., Liu, Q., Wang, L., Chen, Y., Wang, H., Liu, K., Shao, Z., Shang, Z.

Cell physiology,2019 03 25,"The phosphorylation state of myosin regulatory light chain (MRLC) is central to the regulation of contractility that impacts cellular homeostasis and fate decisions. Rho-kinase (ROCK) and myosin light chain kinase (MLCK) are major kinases for MRLC documented to selectively regulate MRLC in a subcellular position-specific manner; specifically, MLCK in some nonmuscle cell types works in the cell periphery to promote migration, while ROCK does so at the central region to sustain contractility. However, it remains unclear whether or not the spatially selective regulation of the MRLC kinases is universally present in other cell types, including dedifferentiated vascular smooth muscle cells (SMCs). Here, we demonstrate the absence of the spatial regulation in dedifferentiated SMCs using both cell lines and primary cells. Thus, our work is distinct from previous reports on cells with migratory potential. We also observed that the spatial regulation is partly induced upon fibronectin stimulation and Krüppel-like factor 4 overexpression. To find clues to the mechanism, we reveal how the phosphorylation state of MRLC is determined within dedifferentiated A7r5 SMCs under the enzymatic competition among three major regulators ROCK, MLCK, and MRLC phosphatase (MLCP). We show that ROCK, but not MLCK, predominantly regulates the MRLC phosphorylation in a manner distinct from previous in vitro-based and in silico-based reports. In this ROCK-dominating cellular system, the contractility at physiological conditions was regulated at the level of MRLC diphosphorylation, because its monophosphorylation is already saturated. Thus, the present study provides insights into the molecular basis underlying the absence of spatial MRLC regulation in dedifferentiated SMCs."

Since combination therapies can significantly improve therapeutic efficacy, we constructed doxorubicin (DOX) conjugated and anti-PD-L1 targeting gold nanoparticles (PD-L1-AuNP-DOX) for the targeted chemo-photothermal therapy of CRC. DOX and anti-PD-L1 antibody were conjugated to the α-terminal end group of lipoic acid polyethylene glycol N-hydroxysuccinimide (LA-PEG-NHS) using an amide linkage, and PD-L1-AuNP-DOX was constructed by linking LA-PEG-DOX, LA-PEG-PD-L1, and a short PEG chain on the surface of AuNP using thiol-Au covalent bonds. Physicochemical characterizations and biological studies of PD-L1-AuNP-DOX were performed in the presence of near-infrared (NIR) irradiation (biologic studies were conducted using cellular uptake, apoptosis, and cell cycle assays in CT-26 cells). PD-L1-AuNP-DOX (40.0 ± 3.1 nm) was successfully constructed and facilitated the efficient intracellular uptake of DOX as evidenced by pronounced apoptotic effects (66.0%) in CT-26 cells. PD-L1-AuNP-DOX treatment plus NIR irradiation significantly and synergistically suppressed the in vitro proliferation of CT-26 cells by increasing apoptosis and cell cycle arrest. The study demonstrates that PD-L1-AuNP-DOX in combination with synergistic targeted chemo-photothermal therapy has a considerable potential for the treatment of localized CRC.",Therapeutic Potential of Plasma Proteins Derived from Umbilical Cord Blood for Acute Liver Failure.,https://www.ncbi.nlm.nih.gov/pubmed/30698974,Molecular pharmaceutics,2019 06 09,"There are very limited clinically viable treatment options for acute liver failure, a life-threatening condition that rapidly progresses to loss of liver function. In this study, we aim to evaluate the therapeutic potential of UCBP for acute liver failure induced in a rat model by D-galactosamine (GalN). F344 rats were randomly divided into two groups (control and UCBP-treated) after GalN injection. The therapeutic effects of UCBP were evaluated based on survival rate, H&E staining, TUNEL, PCNA staining, and in vivo BrdU labeling. Hepatocyte proliferation and the therapeutic mechanisms of UCBP were examined with BrdU and Western blot assay in vitro. The survival rate in the UCBP-treated group was found to be increased compared to the control group (85 vs 55%, P = 0.029). UCBP treatment significantly decreased apoptosis and increased cell proliferation. These effects may be secondary to specific bioactive molecules in UCBP. In vitro experiments revealed that adiponectin is one of the key biologically active components of UCBP in facilitating this result and promoting hepatocyte proliferation. Furthermore, this effect is mediated by p38/ERK mitogen-activated protein kinase (MAPK) signaling pathways. Therefore, this uncomplicated and clinically accessible approach may serve as effective bridge therapy for acute liver failure.",Developing Biologics Tablets: The Effects of Compression on the Structure and Stability of Bovine Serum Albumin and Lysozyme.,https://www.ncbi.nlm.nih.gov/pubmed/30698973,Molecular pharmaceutics,2019 06 09,"Oral administration is advantageous compared to the commonly used parenteral administration for local therapeutic uses of biologics or mucosal vaccines, since it can specifically target the gastrointestinal (GI) tract. It offers better patient compliance, even though the general use of such a delivery route is often limited by potential drug degradation in the GI tract and poor absorption. Using bovine serum albumin (BSA) and lysozyme as two model proteins, we studied their solid-state properties, mechanical properties, and tabletability as well as effects of compaction pressure, particle size, and humidity on protein degradation. It was found that BSA and lysozyme are highly hygroscopic, and their tablet manufacturability (powder caking, punch sticking, and tablet lamination) is sensitive to the humidity. BSA and lysozyme exhibited high plasticity and excellent tabletability and remained amorphous at high pressure and humidity. As for protein stability, lysozyme was resistant to high pressure (up to 300 MPa) and high humidity (up to 93%). In contrast, BSA underwent aggregation upon compression, an effect that was more pronounced for smaller BSA particles. High humidity accelerated the aggregation of BSA during incubation, but it did not further synergize with mechanical stress to induce protein degradation. Thus, compression can potentially induce protein aggregation, but this effect is protein-dependent. Therefore, strategies (e.g., the use of excipients, optimized manufacturing processes) to inhibit protein degradation should be explored before their tablet dosage form development.","Experimental and Computational Study of the Group 1 Metal Cation Chelates with Lysine: Bond Dissociation Energies, Structures, and Structural Trends.",https://www.ncbi.nlm.nih.gov/pubmed/30698972,The journal of physical chemistry. B,2019 03 07,"The kinetic energy dependence of the collision-induced dissociation (CID) of Group 1 metal cations (M+ = Li+, Na+, K+, Rb+, and Cs+) chelated to the amino acid lysine (Lys) was measured by threshold CID using a guided ion beam tandem mass spectrometer. The simple loss of neutral lysine is the only dissociation channel observed with the heavier alkali metal cations, whereas CID of Li+(Lys) yields other competing channels including loss of NH3 (the dominant channel at low energy) and eight other reactions. Analysis of the kinetic energy-dependent cross sections yields experimental M+(Lys) bond dissociation energies (BDEs) of 376 ± 30, 219 ± 13, 160 ± 10, 141 ± 6, and 128 ± 4 kJ/mol for Li+, Na+, K+, Rb+, and Cs+, respectively. Computational searches yielded 18 distinct, low-energy structural families related to sites of M+ binding in M+(Lys) complexes and 10 distinct, low-energy structural families for neutral lysine. Among the four levels of theory and three basis sets used, four different ground conformers of M+(Lys) and four different ground conformers of lysine were found, including a ground conformer of K+(Lys) and Cs+(Lys), [Nε,CO(OH)], and its higher energy zwitterionic analogue, [Nε,CO2-], that better explains recent infrared multiple photon dissociation action spectroscopy results.

A variety of alkylphosphonic esters could be obtained using this protocol starting from the corresponding trialkyl phosphites and even catalytic amounts of alkyl halides with very short reaction times (8.33-50 min) and excellent conversions. In general, this protocol works effectively when the alkyl halide is used in catalytic amounts as low as 5-10% only if it concerns the synthesis of homo alkylphosphonates. One equivalent and an excess of alkyl halides should be used in the reaction with alkyl phosphite if the alkyl group of the selected substrates differ. Thus, it provides a sustainable, fast alternative to the existing methods for the preparation of alkylphosphonates. The isolation of the reaction products is straightforward due to the lack of solvents and a high purity of the obtained products (conv ≥ 99%), and notably, in the catalytic procedures there are only traces of alkyl halides formed after the reaction is complete. The reactions conducted using a glass microreactor chip with an internal volume of 250 μL allow the production of 1.6-1.95 g of organophosphorus esters per hour.",Controlling the Kinetics of Self-Reproducing Micelles by Catalyst Compartmentalization in a Biphasic System.,https://www.ncbi.nlm.nih.gov/pubmed/30698970,The Journal of organic chemistry,2019 04 14,"Compartmentalization of reactions is ubiquitous in biochemistry. Self-reproducing lipids are widely studied as chemical models of compartmentalized biological systems. Here, we explore the effect of catalyst location on copper-catalyzed azide-alkyne cycloadditions which drive the self-reproduction of micelles from phase-separated components. Tuning the hydrophilicity of the copper-ligand complex, so that hydro-phobic or -philic catalysts are used in combination with hydro-philic and -phobic coupling partners, provides a wide range of reactivity patterns. Analysis of the kinetic data shows that reactions with a hydrophobic catalyst are faster than with a hydrophilic catalyst. Diffusion-ordered spectroscopy experiments suggest compartmentalization of the hydrophobic catalyst inside micelles while the hydrophilic catalyst remains in the bulk aqueous phase. The autocatalytic effects observed can be tuned by varying reactant structure and coupling a hydrophilic alkyne and hydrophobic azide results in a more pronounced autocatalytic effect. We propose and test a model that rationalizes the observations in terms of the phase behavior of the reaction components and catalysts.",Ground-State Pd Anions React with H2 Much Faster than the Excited Pd Anions.,https://www.ncbi.nlm.nih.gov/pubmed/30698969,The journal of physical chemistry letters,2019 02 28,"Recent advances in experimental techniques have made it relatively easy to prepare reactant cations in well-defined states of electronic excitation. Extensive studies on the role of excited states in the cation-neutral reactions have contributed significantly to our understanding of reaction kinetics and dynamics. The excited states are often more reactive than the ground state. However, the reactions involving the excited atomic anion are very rare because the negative ions usually have no bound excited states. In the present work, we report the state-specific reaction of Pd anions with H2. Surprisingly, we observed that the ground-state Pd anions react with H2 10 times faster than the excited Pd anions.

Complexes with n = 2-4 are observed to undergo water loss, followed by sequential water loss at higher collision energies. In addition, we find that loss of the neutral hydroxide group is competitive with the primary water loss for n = 1. Bond dissociation energies (BDEs) at 0 K are derived through modeling of the experimental cross sections after accounting for multiple collisions, kinetic shifts, and reactant internal and kinetic energy distributions. Quantum chemical calculations include geometry optimizations performed at the B3LYP/6-311+G(d,p) level of theory and then used for single point calculations at B3LYP, B3P86, MP2, and CCSD(T) levels with a 6-311+G(2d,2p) basis set. Additional geometry optimizations at the cam-B3LYP/def2-TZVP were also performed as well as empirical dispersion corrections at all levels. The various structures for the FeOH+(H2O) n complexes and their relative energies are discussed in detail. We also derive experimental BDEs for the OH loss from FeOH+(H2O) n, with n = 2-4, using the experimental BDE of n = 1 in combination with literature data for water loss from Fe+(H2O) n species. Measurements of BDEs for hydroxide and water loss from FeOH+(H2O) n ( n = 1-4) are the first such experimental measurements. Theoretically calculated BDEs are in reasonable agreement for water loss from both FeOH+(H2O) n and Fe+(H2O) n complexes and for D0(Fe+-OH) but are too low for the loss of OH from the larger hydrated complexes."

Instead of the currently prevalent solution through intratumoral oxygen supply, we put forward an ""O2-economizer"" concept by inhibiting the O2 consumption of cell respiration to spare endogenous O2 and overcome the hypoxia barrier. A nitric oxide (NO) donor responsible for respiration inhibition and a photosensitizer for photodynamic therapy (PDT) are co-loaded into poly(d,l-lactide- co-glycolide) nanovesicles to provide a PDT-specific O2 economizer. Once accumulating in tumors and subsequently responding to the locally reductive environment, the carried NO donor undergoes breakdown to produce NO for inhibiting cellular respiration, allowing more O2 in tumor cells to support the profound enhancement of PDT. Depending on the biochemical reallocation of cellular oxygen resource, this O2-economizer concept offers a way to address the important issue of hypoxia-induced tumor resistance to therapeutic interventions, including but not limited to PDT.",Copper-Promoted Functionalization of Organic Molecules: from Biologically Relevant Cu/O2 Model Systems to Organometallic Transformations.,https://www.ncbi.nlm.nih.gov/pubmed/30698952,Chemical reviews,2019 06 16,"Copper is one of the most abundant and less toxic transition metals.

The resulting double-shelled Mn-doped ZCGS (ZCGS/Mn) QDs exhibit a distinct Mn2+ 4T1-6A1 emission as a consequence of effective lattice incorporation simultaneously with host intragap states-involving emissions of free-to-bound and donor-acceptor pair recombinations. The relative contribution of Mn emission to the overall photoluminescence (PL) is consistently proportional to its concentration, resulting in tunable PL from bluish, white, to reddish white. Regardless of Mn doping and its concentration, all QDs possess high PL quantum yield levels of 74-79%. Those undoped and doped QDs are then employed as an emitting layer (EML) of all-solution-processed QD-light-emitting diodes (QLEDs) with hybrid charge transport layers and their electroluminescence (EL) is compared. Compared to undoped QDs, doped analogues give rise to a huge spectral disparity of EL versus PL, specifically showing a near-complete quenching of Mn2+ EL. This unexpected observation is rationalized primarily by considering unbalanced carrier injection to QD EML on the basis of energetic alignment of the present QLED and rapid trapping of holes injected at intragap states of QDs.",Defect and Additional Active Sites on the Basal Plane of Manganese-Doped Molybdenum Diselenide for Effective Enzyme Immobilization: In Vitro and in Vivo Real-Time Analyses of Hydrogen Peroxide Sensing.,https://www.ncbi.nlm.nih.gov/pubmed/30698948,ACS applied materials & interfaces,2019 02 28,"The defect engineering makes the new concepts and designs to further enhance the electrocatalytic activity of layered structures.

The formation of defect/distortion and effective immobilization of myoglobin (Mb) were evidently confirmed by using the transmission electron microscopy and UV-vis spectroscopy analyses, respectively. The result of electrochemical impedance spectroscopy analysis reveals that the Mn doping not only helps  to enzyme immobilization but also enhances the electronic conductivity of layered material.  Owing to the multiple signal amplification strategies, the proposed Mb-immobilized MnMoSe2 (Mb@MnMoSe2) exhibited an ultralow detection limit (0.004 μM) and a higher sensitivity (222.78 μA μM-1 cm-2) of H2O2.

While the dependence of network conductivity on the loading level of conductive additive is well understood, little is known about the loading dependence of mobility and carrier density. This is particularly important as the addition of graphene might lead to increases in the mobility of semiconducting nanosheet network transistors. Here, we use electrolytic gating to investigate the transport properties of spray-coated composite networks of graphene and WS2 nanosheets. As the graphene loading is increased, we find that both conductivity and carrier density increase in line with the percolation theory with percolation thresholds (∼8 vol %) and exponents (∼2.5) consistent with previous reporting. Perhaps surprisingly, we find the mobility increases modestly from ∼0.1 cm2/V s (for a WS2 network) to ∼0.3 cm2/V s (for a graphene network) which we attribute to the similarity between WS2-WS2 and graphene-graphene junction resistances. In addition, we find both the transistor on- and off-currents to scale with loading according to the percolation theory, changing sharply at the percolation threshold. Through fitting, we show that only the current in the WS2 network changes significantly upon gating. As a result, the on-off ratio falls sharply at the percolation threshold from ∼104 to ∼2 at higher loading. Reflecting on these results, we conclude that the addition of graphene to a semiconducting network is not a viable strategy to improve transistor performance as it reduces the on:off ratio far more than it improves the mobility.",Three-Dimensional Printing of Biodegradable Piperazine-Based Polyurethane-Urea Scaffolds with Enhanced Osteogenesis for Bone Regeneration.,https://www.ncbi.nlm.nih.gov/pubmed/30698946,ACS applied materials & interfaces,2019 06 14,"Synthetic biodegradable polymeric scaffolds with uniformly interconnected pore structure, appropriate mechanical properties, excellent biocompatibility, and even enhanced osteogenesis ability are urgently required for in situ bone regeneration. In this study, for the first time, a series of biodegradable piperazine (PP)-based polyurethane-urea (P-PUU) scaffolds with a gradient of PP contents were developed by air-driven extrusion 3D printing technology. The P-PUU ink of 60 wt % concentration was demonstrated to have appropriate viscosity for scaffold fabrication. The 3D-printed P-PUU scaffolds exhibited an interconnected porous structure of about 450 μm in macropore size and about 75% in porosity. By regulating the contents of PP in P-PUU scaffolds, their mechanical properties could be moderated, and P-PUU1.4 scaffolds with the highest PP contents exhibited the highest compressive modulus (155.9 ± 5.7 MPa) and strength (14.8 ± 1.1 MPa). Moreover, both in vitro and in vivo biological results suggested that the 3D-printed P-PUU scaffolds possessed excellent biocompatibility and osteoconductivity to facilitate new bone formation. The small molecular PP itself was confirmed for the first time to regulate osteogenesis of osteoblasts in a dose-dependent manner and the optimum concentration for osteoconductivity was about ∼0.5 mM, which suggests that PP molecules, together with the mechanical behavior, nitrogen-contents, and hydrophilicity of P-PUUs, play an important role in enhancing the osteoconductive ability of P-PUU scaffolds.

The discovery of the first intermolecular acyl-transfer reaction in molecular crystals of racemic 2,4-di- O-benzoyl- myo-inositol-1,3,5-orthoformate (DiBz) during our attempts to develop methods for the synthesis of phosphoinositols, motivated us to find other molecular crystals capable of supporting similar reactions. Small changes to the molecular structure of DiBz yielded analogues with different crystal structures which showed varying degrees of acyl transfer reactivity as compared to the crystals of DiBz. A systematic investigation of the structures, polymorphism, cocrystallization behavior, and the corresponding reactivity of these crystals allowed us to correlate the acyl transfer reactivity with their structures and inherent noncovalent interactions and provided crucial insights into the mechanism of these reactions. Polymorphs or cocrystals of these compounds exhibited dissimilar reactivities due to differences in the molecular conformation and/or arrangements in their crystals. The knowledge of phase transitions between polymorphs enabled us to control and tune the reactivity in the solid state. We could identify three conditions essential for intermolecular acyl transfer: (i) favorable relative geometry of the electrophile (ester C═O) and the nucleophile (OH), (ii) noncovalent interactions (C-H···π) between the reacting molecules which help in maintaining the facility and specificity of the reaction, and (iii) the presence of channels in the lattice which enable propagation of the reaction in the crystal. Based on this supramolecular structure-reactivity correlation, we identified other molecular crystals (composed of molecules of widely different molecular structure from that of DiBz) from a survey of the Cambridge Structural Database (CSD) and predicted their acyl transfer reactivity. The increased availability of user-friendly modern X-ray diffractometers and related software has enabled efficient collection, analysis and interpretation of single crystal X-ray diffraction data, essential for such studies. The rapidly expanding CSD facilitates the identification of crystals with similar structures and reactivity patterns. In a wider perspective, facile reactions in molecular crystals fascinate chemists because these reactions usually exhibit unique product selectivity and have the potential to be developed as sustainable green reactions. We are optimistic that similar approaches for the study of other group transfer reactions in molecular crystals would augment and widen the scope of chemical reactions in molecular crystals in particular and the solid state in general. The ability to predict the reactivity of molecules in their crystals could find applications in organic synthesis, material science and industry. Realization of the involvement of inositol derivatives in cellular processes led to the discovery of cellular signal transduction mechanisms. The ability of inositol derivatives to support facile acyl-transfer reactions in the crystalline state might well have opened a new avenue for research in the area of organic solid-state reactions.",Significant Stretchability Enhancement of a Crack-Based Strain Sensor Combined with High Sensitivity and Superior Durability for Motion Monitoring.,https://www.ncbi.nlm.nih.gov/pubmed/30698944,ACS applied materials & interfaces,2019 03 01,"Flexible strain sensors have attracted tremendous interest due to their potential application as intelligent wearable sensing devices. Among them, crack-based flexible strain sensors have been studied extensively owing to their ultrahigh sensitivity. Nevertheless, the detection range of a crack-based sensor is quite narrow, limiting its application. In this work, a stretchable strain sensor based on a designed crack structure was fabricated by spray-coating carbon nanotube (CNT) ink onto an electrospun thermoplastic polyurethane (TPU) fibrous mat and prestretching treatment to overcome the trade-off relationship. Our sensor exhibited combined features of high sensitivity in a greatly widened workable sensing range [a gauge factor of 428.5 within 100% strain, 9268.8 for a strain of 100-220%, and larger than 83982.8 for a strain of 220-300%], a fast response time (about 70 ms), superior durability (>10 000 stretching-releasing cycles), and excellent response toward bending. The microstructural evolution of CNT branches extending from two edges of the cracks and the excellent stretchability of TPU fibrous mats are mainly related to the remarkable sensing properties. Our sensor is then assembled to detect various human motions and physical vibrational signals, demonstrating its potential applications in intelligent devices, electronic skins, and wearable healthcare monitors.",Synthesis and Preliminary Evaluations of a Triazole-Cored Antagonist as a PET Imaging Probe ([18F]N2B-0518) for GluN2B Subunit in the Brain.,https://www.ncbi.nlm.nih.gov/pubmed/30698943,ACS chemical neuroscience,2019 06 10,"GluN2B is the most studied subunit of N-methyl-d-aspartate receptors (NMDARs) and implicated in the pathologies of various central nervous system disorders and neurodegenerative diseases. As pan NMDAR antagonists often produce debilitating side effects, new approaches in drug discovery have shifted to subtype-selective NMDAR modulators, especially GluN2B-selective antagonists. While positron emission tomography (PET) studies of GluN2B-selective NMDARs in the living brain would enable target engagement in drug development and improve our understanding in the NMDAR signaling pathways between normal and disease conditions, a suitable PET ligand is yet to be identified. Herein we developed an 18F-labeled potent antagonist, 2-((1-(4-[18F]fluoro-3-methylphenyl)-1 H-1,2,3-triazol-4-yl)methoxy)-5-methoxypyrimidine ([18F]13; also called [18F]N2B-0518) as a PET tracer for imaging the GluN2B subunit. The radiofluorination of [18F]13 was efficiently achieved by our spirocyclic iodonium ylide (SCIDY) method. In in vitro autoradiography studies, [18F]13 displayed highly region-specific binding in brain sections of rat and nonhuman primate, which was in accordance with the expression of GluN2B subunit. Ex vivo biodistribution in mice revealed that [18F]13 could penetrate the blood-brain barrier with moderate brain uptake (3.60% ID/g at 2 min) and rapid washout. Altogether, this work provides a GluN2B-selective PET tracer bearing a new chemical scaffold and shows high specificity to GluN2B subunit in vitro, which may pave the way for the development of a new generation of GluN2B PET ligands.",Thermally Superstable Cellulosic-Nanorod-Reinforced Transparent Substrates Featuring Microscale Surface Patterns.,https://www.ncbi.nlm.nih.gov/pubmed/30698942,ACS nano,2019 02 28,"The recent rapid expansion of thin-film, bendable, and wearable consumer (opto)electronics demands flexible and transparent substrates other than glass. Plastics are the traditional choice, but they require amelioration because of their thermal instability. Here, we report the successful conversion of a soft and thermally vulnerable polymer into a highly thermally stable transparent nanocomposite material. This is achieved by the meticulous choice of a polymer with a glass-transition temperature below 0 °C that gives stable mechanics above room temperature, reinforcing the polymer with a load-bearing hierarchical network of the incredibly strong and stable natural material: cellulose nanorods. Owing to the Pickering emulsification process, the nanocomposites inherit the self-assembled structural hierarchy from the cellulose nanorod-encapsulated resin droplets. The ameliorated nanocomposites have highly desirable high-temperature endurance (∼150-180 °C) in terms of the thermomechanical, thermodimensional, and thermo-optical performance. Any photonic nano- or microstructures can be directly molded on the surface of the nanocomposites in high precision for better light management in photonic and opto-electronic applications. The highlight of this work is the demonstration of a highly thermally stable microlens array on the ameliorated transparent nanocomposite."

In contrast to the case of p- and m-dinitrobenzene radical anions, the difference in the strength of electronic coupling (V) was not so large for the present BTA MV radical cations, although they still fall within the paradigm of strong V for para-linkage and weak V for meta-linkage. Unexpectedly, it has been found that meta-phenylenediamine radical cation has an electronic coupling comparable to those in the para-conjugated BTA-based MV species, and the ICT/IST rate exceeds the ESR time-scale. This finding is very encouraging considering that sufficient electronic communication can be ensured even when the redox-active centers are linked directly by the meta-phenylene bridge, thus broadening the selection of π-bridging units for molecule-based optoelectronics.",Controlled Fabrication of Micropatterned Supramolecular Gels by Directed Self-Assembly of Small Molecular Gelators.,https://www.ncbi.nlm.nih.gov/pubmed/30698916,"Small (Weinheim an der Bergstrasse, Germany)",2019 02 22,"Herein, the micropatterning of supramolecular gels with oriented growth direction and controllable spatial dimensions by directing the self-assembly of small molecular gelators is reported. This process is associated with an acid-catalyzed formation of gelators from two soluble precursor molecules. To control the localized formation and self-assembly of gelators, micropatterned poly(acrylic acid) (PAA) brushes are employed to create a local and controllable acidic environment. The results show that the gel formation can be well confined in the catalytic surface plane with dimensions ranging from micro- to centimeter. Furthermore, the gels show a preferential growth along the normal direction of the catalytic surface, and the thickness of the resultant gel patterns can be easily controlled by tuning the grafting density of PAA brushes. This work shows an effective ""bottom-up"" strategy toward control over the spatial organization of materials and is expected to find promising applications in, e.g., microelectronics, tissue engineering, and biomedicine.",Development and organization of the zebrafish intestinal epithelial stem cell niche.,https://www.ncbi.nlm.nih.gov/pubmed/30698914,Developmental dynamics : an official publication of the American Association of Anatomists,2019 02 18,Development of the vertebrate intestinal epithelial stem cell niche begins during embryogenesis but maturation occurs postembryonic. The intestinal mammalian crypt contains stem cells interspersed by secretory cells that play a role in regulation of proliferation. Epithelial cells are specified as either secretory or enterocytes as they migrate up the villi in mammals or fold in zebrafish. Zebrafish forms a functional intestine by the end of embryogenesis but takes another 4 weeks to develop the adult proliferation pattern.,Thermopower Modulation Clarification of the Operating Mechanism in Wide Bandgap BaSnO3 -SrSnO3 Solid-Solution Based Thin Film Transistors.,https://www.ncbi.nlm.nih.gov/pubmed/30698912,"Small (Weinheim an der Bergstrasse, Germany)",2019 02 22,"The transparent oxide semiconductor (TOS) with large bandgap (Eg ≈ 4 eV) based thin-film transistors (TFTs) showing both high carrier mobility and UV-visible transparency has attracted increasing attention as a promising component for next generation optoelectronics. Among TOSs, BaSnO3 -SrSnO3 solid-solutions (Eg = 3.5-4.2 eV) are good candidates because the single crystal shows very high mobility. However, the TFT performance has not been optimized due to the lack of fundamental knowledge especially the effective thickness (teff ) and the carrier effective mass (m*). Here, it is demonstrated that the electric field thermopower (S) modulation method addresses this problem by combining with the standard volume carrier concentration (n3D ) dependence of S measurements. By comparing the electric field accumulated sheet carrier concentration (n2D ) and n3D at same S, it is clarified that the teff (n2D /n3D ) of the conducting channel becomes thicker with increasing Sr concentration, whereas the m* becomes lighter. The former would be due to the increase of Eg and latter would be due to the enhancement of overlap population of neighboring Sn 5s orbitals. The present analyses technique is useful to experimentally clarify the teff and m*, and essentially important to realize advanced TOS-based TFTs showing both high optical transparency and high mobility.",Aggregation-Induced Electrochemiluminescence of Carboranyl Carbazoles in Aqueous Media.,https://www.ncbi.nlm.nih.gov/pubmed/30698911,Angewandte Chemie (International ed. in English),2019 02 25,"The aggregation-induced electrochemiluminescence (AIECL) of carboranyl carbazoles in aqueous media was investigated for the first time. Quantum yields, morphologies, and particle sizes were observed to determine the electrochemiluminescence (ECL) performance of these aggregated organic dots (ODs). All compounds exhibit much higher ECL stability and intensity than the carborane-free compound, demonstrating the essential role of the carboranyl motif. Moreover, the results of cyclic voltammetry (CV) suggest that oxidation/reduction reactions take place at the carboranyl motif. The excited states of ODs were proposed to be generated by the mechanism of surface state transitions. More importantly, these compounds show a reductive-oxidative mechanism in contrast to other organic materials that show oxidative-reductive mechanisms.

To explore the role of NLRP3 inflammsome activation in inflammation-related lung carcinogenesis, a cell model was set up. Human bronchial epithelial cells (BEAS-2B) were stimulated with 1 μg/mL lipopolysaccharide (LPS) for 24 hours, and then treated with 2.4 μg/mL coal tar pitch extract (CTPE) for 24 hours, after removal of LPS and CTPE, the cells were numbered passage 1 and were passaged and treated in this way until passage 30, which was called LPS + CTPE group. DMSO and Saline were used as vehicle controls. Malignant transformation of cells in passage 30 was evaluated by morphological change, platelet clone formation assay, and tumor formation in nude mice. The mRNA levels of NLRP3 and IL-1β were detected by real time-PCR. The combination of NLRP3 and caspase-1 were determined using immunofluorescence and confocal. The protein expression of NLRP3, cleaved caspase-1(p10), and cleaved IL-1β was detected using Western blot. It was shown that CTPE, LPS + CTPE-stimulated BEAS-2B cells of passage 30 changed a lot morphologically. The clone formation rates, the rates of positive cells of NLRP3 and caspase-1 combination, the mRNA levels of NLRP3 and IL-1β, the protein expression of NLRP3, cleaved caspase-1(p10) and cleaved IL-1β of cells exposed with CTPE and LPS + CTPE at passage 30 were significantly increased compared to vehicle controls. Furthermore, the ability of tumor formation in nude mice, the rates of clone formation and positive cells, mRNA and protein levels of NLRP3 inflammasome activation-related factors in LPS + CTPE-induced cells were all higher than those in cells stimulated with CTPE alone. In conclusion, the cell model of inflammation-related lung cancer is set up successfully, and NLRP3 inflammasome activation may be involved in the malignant transformation of BEAS-2B cells which induced by CTPE alone or LPS combined with CTPE.",Adhesion Anisotropy Substrate with Janus Micropillar Arrays Guides Cell Polarized Migration and Division Cycle.,https://www.ncbi.nlm.nih.gov/pubmed/30698908,Angewandte Chemie (International ed. in English),2019 03 15,"Cell migration is a ubiquitous and important cell behaviour.

This anisotropic structure was capable of influencing the focal adhesion pathway of melanoma cells as shown by transcriptome sequencing and bioinformatics analysis. This the anisotropic substrate can considerably affect the migration ability of highly invasive melanoma cells. The anisotropic structure with Janus micropillar arrays could also affect the cell division cycle.

A spatial autocorrelation analysis confirmed that river pollution was spatially uneven and clustered. While pollution of surface water was a nationwide concern, most serious water pollution happened in the Huai, Hai, Yellow, and Liao river Basins in Northern China. The results of the spatial regression analysis showed that GDP per capita, surface water stock, population, and economic structure were all significantly correlated with surface water pollution, with population having strongest impact, followed by level of economic development. By investigating the common characteristics shared by the ""hotspot"" cities where serious water pollution occurred, this study recommended a regional or basin approach to assessing water quality and controlling river pollution that cuts across jurisdiction boundaries. While China has made considerable progress in improving water productivity, there is still enormous potential in water conservation. It is also imperative to restructure local economy and develop water-efficient, less polluting industries and services.

Studies have confirmed long-term exposure to the particles could decrease the pulmonary function, induce asthma exacerbation, and chronic obstructive pulmonary disease, as well as increase the incidence and mortality of lung cancer. A clinical study has explored that the prevalence and risks of vitamin D (VD) deficiency in various chronic disease and toxins induced tissue damage. Our current study aimed to explore the mechanism and further therapeutic potential of VD administration to ameliorate fine particles exposure induced pulmonary damage in vivo and in vitro. To elucidate the effects and mechanisms of VD in particles-induced pulmonary damage, a murine model was established with fine particles intratracheal instillation along with VD intramuscular injection. Our study demonstrated that treatment with VD attenuated particles-induced pulmonary damage and promoted tissue repair by repressing of TGFβ1 signaling pathway and upregulation of MMP9 expression. VD treatment could also regulate the autophagy-related signals along with activation of Nrf2 transcription factor. Furthermore, the results from the in vitro study demonstrated that VD protected against particles-induced cells' damage through the induction of autophagy in an Nrf2-dependent manner. VD treatment caused the degradation of P62 and its bound Keap1, which decreased the Nrf2 ubiquitination and increasing its protein stability. Our work explored a novel potential mechanism in the protection of VD in particles-induced pulmonary injury and tissue repair, and could further bring insights into exploring antifine particles exposure caused inflammation among other natural products and contributes to inflammation disease medical therapies.",Origin and formation mechanism of salty water in Zuli River catchment of the Yellow River.,https://www.ncbi.nlm.nih.gov/pubmed/30698893,Water environment research : a research publication of the Water Environment Federation,2019 05 10,"The Zuli River is one of the branches of the upper Yellow River, as an inland catchment with semiarid climate in northwestern China, and the formation, evolution, and development of brackish water at such a large scale have remained unclear. This study aims to find clues about the origin and formation mechanism of salty water through multiple methods of hydrochemistry and isotope hydrology. The results show that groundwater is dominantly recharged by precipitation, and the river water was mainly recharged by groundwater discharge. The relatively high tritium content of groundwater (>5.0 TU) clearly suggests the occurrence of a modern recharge and rapid circulation. The dissolution of evaporate minerals, followed by incongruent dissolution of carbonate minerals (dolomite), constituted the main processes controlling groundwater salinization. In addition, the intense evaporation and unreasonable use of fertilizers further increase the TDS of the river, which should be the primary external mechanism of water salinization.

In a previous report, we highlighted the potential of OTA to induce apoptosis via reactive oxygen species (ROS) generation in mouse blastocysts that led to impaired preimplantation and postimplantation embryo development in vitro and in vivo. Here, we have shown that liquiritigenin (LQ), a type of flavonoid isolated from Glycyrrhiza radix, effectively protects against OTA-mediated apoptosis and inhibition of cell proliferation in mouse blastocysts. Preincubation of blastocysts with LQ clearly prevented OTA-triggered impairment of preimplantation and postimplantation embryonic development and fetal weight loss, both in vitro and in vivo. Detailed investigation of regulatory mechanisms revealed that OTA mediated apoptosis and embryotoxicity through ROS generation, loss of mitochondrial membrane potential (MMP), and activation of caspase-9 and caspase-3, which were effectively prevented by LQ. The embryotoxic effects of OTA were further validated in an animal model in vivo. Intravenous injection of dams with OTA (3 mg/kg/day) led to apoptosis of blastocysts, impairment of embryonic development from zygote to blastocyst stage and decrease in day 18 fetal weight. Notably, preinjection of dams with LQ (5 mg/kg/day) effectively prevented OTA-induced apoptosis and toxic effects on embryo development. Our collective results clearly demonstrate that OTA exposure via injection has the potential to damage preimplantation and postimplantation embryonic development against which LQ has a protective effect.",Acute exacerbations of chronic obstructive pulmonary disease (COPD) experiences among COPD patients with comorbid gastrooesophageal reflux disease.,https://www.ncbi.nlm.nih.gov/pubmed/30698890,Journal of clinical nursing,2019 05 15,To explore perceptions of experience exacerbations of chronic obstructive pulmonary disease among chronic obstructive pulmonary disease patients with comorbid gastrooesophageal reflux disease by focusing on unravelling how patients differentiate and react to symptoms of chronic obstructive pulmonary disease and gastrooesophageal reflux disease.,Understanding country-specific determinants of stillbirth using household surveys: The case of Afghanistan.,https://www.ncbi.nlm.nih.gov/pubmed/30698889,Paediatric and perinatal epidemiology,2019 02 15,Stillbirth rates in Afghanistan have declined little in the past decade with no data available on key risk factors.

PBM therapy has important clinical applications in regenerative medicine. Vitiligo is an acquired depigmentary disorder resulting from disappearance of functional melanocytes in the involved skin. Vitiligo repigmentation depends on available melanocytes derived from (a) melanocyte stem cells located in the bulge area of hair follicles and (b) the epidermis at the lesional borders, which contains a pool of functional melanocytes. Since follicular melanoblasts (MBs) are derived from the melanocyte stem cells residing at the bulge area of hair follicle, the process of vitiligo repigmentation presents a research model for studying the regenerative effect of PBM therapy. Previous reports have shown favourable response for treatment of vitiligo with a low-energy helium-neon (He-Ne) laser. This review focuses on the molecular events that took place during the repigmentation process of vitiligo triggered by He-Ne laser (632.8 nm, red light). Monochromatic radiation in the visible and infrared A (IRA) range sustains matrix metalloproteinase (MMP), improves mitochondrial function, and increases adenosine triphosphate (ATP) synthesis and O2 consumption, which lead to cellular regenerative pathways. Cytochrome c oxidase in the mitochondria was reported to be the photoacceptor upon which He-Ne laser exerts its effects. Mitochondrial retrograde signalling is responsible for the cellular events by red light. This review shows that He-Ne laser initiated mitochondrial retrograde signalling via a Ca2+ -dependent cascade. The impact on cytochrome c oxidase within the mitochondria, an event that results in activation of CREB (cyclic-AMP response element binding protein)-related cascade, is responsible for the He-Ne laser promoting functional development at different stages of MBs and boosting functional melanocytes. He-Ne laser irradiation induced (a) melanocyte stem cell differentiation; (b) immature outer root sheath MB migration; (c) differentiated outer root sheath MB melanogenesis and migration; and (d) perilesional melanocyte migration and proliferation. These photobiomodulation effects result in perifollocular and marginal repigmentation in vitiligo.",Facial distribution of squamous cell carcinoma in Japanese.,https://www.ncbi.nlm.nih.gov/pubmed/30698883,Experimental dermatology,2019 01 30,Squamous cell carcinoma (SCC) is a malignant tumor of the skin.

To achieve these same results without crosslinking, a 15-BL unmodified chitosan (CH)/PAA film, which is almost 5× thicker, must be deposited on PET.

However, its low electrical conductivity could lead to limited capacitance if applied in electrochemical devices. Herein, a new nanostructure composed of hollow carbon-MoS2 -carbon was successfully synthesized through an l-cysteine-assisted hydrothermal method by using gibbsite as a template and polydopamine as a carbon precursor. After calcination and etching of the gibbsite template, uniform hollow platelets, which were made of a sandwich-like assembly of partial graphitic carbon and two-dimensional layered MoS2 flakes, were obtained. The platelets showed excellent dispersibility and stability in water, and good electrical conductivity due to carbon provided by the calcination of polydopamine coatings. The hollow nanoplate morphology of the material provided a high specific surface area of 543 m2  g-1 , a total pore volume of 0.677 cm3  g-1 , and fairly small mesopores (≈5.3 nm). The material was applied in a symmetric supercapacitor and exhibited a specific capacitance of 248 F g-1 (0.12 F cm-2 ) at a constant current density of 0.1 A g-1 ; thus suggesting that hollow carbon-MoS2 -carbon nanoplates are promising candidate materials for supercapacitors.",Gestational diabetes and adiposity are independent risk factors for perinatal outcomes: a population based cohort study in Sweden.,https://www.ncbi.nlm.nih.gov/pubmed/30698864,Diabetic medicine : a journal of the British Diabetic Association,2019 03 13,To evaluate the interaction effects of gestational diabetes (GDM) with obesity on perinatal outcomes.,Higher rates of large-for-gestational-age newborns mediated by excess maternal weight gain in pregnancies with Type 1 diabetes and use of continuous subcutaneous insulin infusion vs multiple dose insulin injection.,https://www.ncbi.nlm.nih.gov/pubmed/30698863,Diabetic medicine : a journal of the British Diabetic Association,2019 03 13,"To compare glycaemic control, maternal and neonatal outcomes in pregnancies with Type 1 diabetes, managed either by continuous subcutaneous insulin infusion, multiple daily insulin injection or switch from multiple daily insulin injection (MDI) to continuous subcutaneous insulin infusion (CSII) in early pregnancy.",OMIC signatures to understand cancer immunosurveillance and immunoediting: Melanoma and immune cells interplay in immunotherapy.,https://www.ncbi.nlm.nih.gov/pubmed/30698862,Journal of leukocyte biology,2019 04 19,"Melanoma is the deadliest form of skin cancer. Cutaneous melanomas usually originate from exposure to the mutagenic effects of ultraviolet radiation, and as such they exhibit the highest rate of somatic mutations than any other human cancer, and an extensive expression of neoantigens concurrently with a dense infiltrate of immune cells. The coexistence of high immunogenicity and high immune cell infiltration may sound contradictory for cancers carrying a gloomy outcome. However, recent studies have unveiled a variety of immunosuppressive mechanisms that often permeate the tumor microenvironment and that are responsible for tumor escaping from immunosurveillance mechanisms. Nonetheless, this particular immune profile has opened a new window of treatments based on immunotherapy that have significantly improved the clinical outcome of melanoma patients. Still, positive and complete therapy responses have been limited, and this particular cancer continues to be a major clinical challenge. The transcriptomic signatures of those patients with clinical benefit and those with progressive disease have provided a more complete picture of the universe of interactions between the tumor and the immune system. In this review, we integrate the results of the immunotherapy clinical trials to discuss a novel understanding of the mechanisms guiding cancer immunosurveillance and immunoediting. A clear notion of the cellular and molecular processes shaping how the immune system and the tumor are continuously coevolving would result in the rational design of combinatory therapies aiming to counteract the signaling pathways and cellular processes responsible for immunoescape mechanisms and provide clinical benefit to immunotherapy nonresponsive patients.",A grid-based algorithm in conjunction with a gaussian-based model of atoms for describing molecular geometry.,https://www.ncbi.nlm.nih.gov/pubmed/30698861,Journal of computational chemistry,2019 05 10,"A novel grid-based method is presented, which in conjunction with a smooth Gaussian-based model of atoms, is used to compute molecular volume (MV) and surface area (MSA). The MV and MSA are essential for computing nonpolar component of free energies. The objective of our grid-based approach is to identify solute atom pairs that share overlapping volumes in space. Once completed, this information is used to construct a rooted tree using depth-first method to yield the final volume and SA by using the formulations of the Gaussian model described by Grant and Pickup (J. Phys Chem, 1995, 99, 3503). The method is designed to function uninterruptedly with the grid-based finite-difference method implemented in Delphi, a popular and open-source package used for solving the Poisson-Boltzmann equation (PBE). We demonstrate the time efficacy of the method while also validating its performance in terms of the effect of grid-resolution, positioning of the solute within the grid-map and accuracy in identification of overlapping atom pairs. We also explore and discuss different aspects of the Gaussian model with key emphasis on its physical meaningfulness. This development and its future release with the Delphi package are intended to provide a physically meaningful, fast, robust and comprehensive tool for MM/PBSA based free energy calculations. © 2019 Wiley Periodicals, Inc.","Differential contribution of education through KIR2DL1, KIR2DL3, and KIR3DL1 to antibody-dependent (AD) NK cell activation and ADCC.",https://www.ncbi.nlm.nih.gov/pubmed/30698860,Journal of leukocyte biology,2019 02 22,"The engagement of activating NK receptors (aNKR) stimulates NK cell activity, provided that interactions between inhibitory NK receptors (iNKR) with their HLA ligands do not override them. Abs bound to target cells can also activate NK cells by engaging the CD16 aNKR. NK cell education status is an important factor for Ab-dependent NK cell activation (ADNKA) of some NK cell subsets. However, whether NK cell education also influences Ab-dependent cellular cytotoxicity (ADCC) levels is not fully known. ADCC-GranToxiLux (GTL) assays measured ADCC activity as the frequency of granzyme B positive (%GzB+ ) target cells. Target cells were anti-HIV Immunoglobulin G (HIVIG)-opsonized CEM-NKr.CCR5 (CEM) cells. Lymphocytes and sorted single positive (SP) NKG2A+ , KIR2DL1+ , KIR2DL3+ , and KIR3DL1+ NK cells, to self- and nonself HLA, were used as effectors in ADCC-GTL assays to examine how education status influenced ADCC activity. ADNKA activity was assessed by stimulating lymphocytes with HIVIG-opsonized CEMs and measuring the frequency of NK cell populations defined by their expression of iNKRs, along with IFN-γ, CCL4, and CD107a functions. ADCC: the %GzB+ CEM cells generated by self- versus nonself HLA-specific SPiNKR did not differ. ADNKA: More NK cells educated through KIR2DL1 and KIR3DL1, but not KIR2DL3, responded to ADNKA than their uneducated counterparts. CD16 engagement induced ADCC and ADNKA activity. With the proviso that groups' sizes were small, our results support the notion that NK cell education does not influence ADCC levels but does contribute to ADNKA activity."

We explored the effects of a common herbicide (atrazine and alachlor) and fertilizer (urea) tank mixture on juvenile frog corticosterone stress levels, acetylcholinesterase (AChE) activity, and pesticide bioaccumulation. Single agrochemical or tank mixtures were applied to terrestrial microcosms, and then individual Southern leopard frog (Lithobates sphenocephala) juveniles were added to microcosms for an 8-h exposure. Afterward, frogs were transferred to aquatic microcosms for 1 h to monitor corticosterone prior to euthanasia, brain tissues were excised to evaluate AChE, and tissue homogenates were analyzed for pesticide bioconcentation with gas chromatography-mass spectrometry. Atrazine significantly increased corticosterone in frogs, particularly when combined with alachlor and urea. Atrazine increased AChE and urea decreased AChE, although no interactive effects of chemical combinations were discernible. Relative to their individual treatments, the complete tank mixture with all 3 agrochemicals resulted in 64% greater bioconcentration of atrazine and 54% greater bioconcentration of alachlor in frog tissues. Our results suggest that agrochemical mixtures as well as their active ingredients can lead to altered stress levels and impaired physiological responses in amphibians. An improved understanding of the effects of co-exposure to environmental contaminants in amphibians is important in assessing the ecological risks these compounds pose.

Instead of acid treatment, hydrolysis in aqueous ammonia solution not only readily cleaved the chemically weak Ge(Si)-O-Ge bonds located within the interlayer double four ring (D4R) units of CIT-13, but also cleaved the metastable Si-O-Si bonds therein. This led to extensive removal of the D4R units, and also generated silanol groups on adjacent silica-rich layers, which then condensed to form a novel daughter structure upon calcination. Individual oxygen bridges in the reassembled ECNU-21 replaced the germanium-rich D4R units in CIT-13, thereby eliminating the original intergrowth phenomenon along the b axis. With an ordered crystalline structure of 10-ring (R) channels as well as suitable germanium-related Lewis acid sites, ECNU-21 serves as a stable solid Lewis acid catalyst for the shape-selective hydration of ethylene oxide (EO) to ethylene glycol (EG) at greatly reduced H2 O/EO ratios and reaction temperature in comparison with the noncatalytic industrial process.",Impact of fetal brain ultrasound tutor smartphone application on normal anatomy learning.,https://www.ncbi.nlm.nih.gov/pubmed/30698846,Prenatal diagnosis,2019 03 27,"The ""Fetal Brain Tutor 4us"" (FBTApp) is a recently developed application for interactive multiplanar navigation through the normal fetal brain.

Plasma expression levels of proposed miRNAs were determined by quantitative real-time PCR. Additionally, traditional risk factors (age, blood pressure, serum lipid profile, blood glucose, and among others) associated with CVD were evaluated. Urinary 1-OHP concentrations and plasma expression levels of miR-126 and miR-155 were significantly higher (P < 0.05) in women using wood as a fuel source in their homes (indoor) compared to women from the reference group (non-exposed to biomass smoke). Besides, multivariate linear regression analyses revealed that miR-126[β = 0.61; 95% confidence interval (0.32-0.90)] and miR-155 [β = 0.45; 95% confidence interval (0.13-0.84)] expression levels were significantly associated with urinary 1-OHP concentrations after being adjusted by traditional risk factors (P < 0.05). In contrast, no significant relationship was found between miR-145 and urinary 1-OHP levels. Furthermore, miRNAs assessed in this investigation are associated with CVD events.

In particular, it is not yet understood whether these compounds can disrupt the estrogen-signaling pathway through binding to the human estrogen receptor (ER). In the present study, 21 disinfection byproducts, selected for their predicted involvement in endocrine-related diseases and their structural diversity, were individually evaluated for their binding affinity to the human ER and in silico, and then a subset of these chemicals was studied in binary mixtures with the known weak estrogen, 4-n-nonylphenol. Individually, 9 of the 21 disinfection byproducts were able to weakly bind to the ER, with affinities ranging from log median inhibitory concentration values of -3.83 to -2.19 M. In binary mixtures, the chemicals followed concentration addition, with their weak binding affinities having little contribution to the overall mixture affinity. These results demonstrate the variety of small-molecule disinfection byproduct structures that are capable of binding to the ER, and that their weak binding can still be of importance when overall human exposure to mixtures of disinfection byproducts in disinfected drinking water is considered.

We ask is this a general pattern and are other patterns possible? In addition, we ask what is the ultimate cause of this pattern and can we understand it using existing ecological theory? To accomplish this task, we assembled a global database on changes in species diversity through time in seasonal environments for different taxa and habitats and also conducted a modeling study in an attempt to replicate observed patterns. Our global database includes terrestrial and aquatic habitats, temperate, tropical, and polar environments, and taxa from disparate groups including vertebrates, insects, and plankton. We constructed nine alternative models that vary in assumptions on type of seasonal forcing, responses to that forcing, species niches, and types of species interactions. We found that most guilds of species exhibit a repeatable SDR across years. For north temperate ecosystems, active species diversity generally peaks mid-year. The peak for a guild is generally more pronounced in terrestrial habitats than aquatic habitats and more pronounced in temperate and polar regions than the tropics. We now have evidence that at least several different habitat and taxa types are likely to have multiple peaks in diversity in a year, for example, guilds of both aquatic microbes and desert vertebrates can show a bimodal or multimodal SDR. We compared all nine candidate models in their ability to explain the patterns and match their assumptions to the data. Some performed considerably better than others in being able to match the different patterns. We conclude that a model that includes both temperature niches and environmental feedbacks is necessary to explain the different SDRs. We use such a model to make predictions about how the SDR could be impacted by climate change.

By specifying that APAP metabolism, reactive metabolite formation, glutathione depletion, and mitigation of mitochondrial damage within individual hepatocytes are functions of intralobular location, an earlier virtual model mechanism provided the first concrete multiattribute explanation for how and why early necrosis occurs close to the central vein (CV). However, two characteristic features could not be simulated consistently: necrosis occurring first adjacent to the CV, and subsequent necrosis occurring primarily adjacent to hepatocytes that have already initiated necrosis. We sought parsimonious model mechanism enhancements that would manage spatiotemporal heterogeneity sufficiently to enable meeting two new target attributes and conducted virtual experiments to explore different ideas for model mechanism improvement at intrahepatocyte and multihepatocyte levels. For the latter, evidence supports intercellular communication via exosomes, gap junctions, and connexin hemichannels playing essential roles in the toxic effects of chemicals, including facilitating or counteracting cell death processes. Logic requiring hepatocytes to obtain current information about whether downstream and lateral neighbors have triggered necrosis enabled virtual hepatocytes to achieve both new target attributes. A virtual hepatocyte that is glutathione-depleted uses that information to determine if it will initiate necrosis. When a less-stressed hepatocyte is flanked by at least two neighbors that have triggered necrosis, it too will initiate necrosis. We hypothesize that the resulting intercellular communication-enabled model mechanism is analogous to the actual explanation for APAP-induced hepatotoxicity at comparable levels of granularity.",Short tandem repeat stutter model inferred from direct measurement of in vitro stutter noise.,https://www.ncbi.nlm.nih.gov/pubmed/30698816,Nucleic acids research,2019 03 29,"Short tandem repeats (STRs) are polymorphic genomic loci valuable for various applications such as research, diagnostics and forensics.

Long, mixed HNA sequences featuring the base modifications are generated. The apparent binding affinity of four of the nucleotides to the enzyme, the rate of the chemical step and of product release, plus the specificity constant for the incorporation of these modified nucleotides into a DNA duplex overhang using the HNA polymerase T6G12_I521L are determined via pre-steady-state kinetics.

Effects on gastrointestinal tract development and nutrient digestibility1.,https://www.ncbi.nlm.nih.gov/pubmed/30698799,Poultry science,2019 05 21,"The effects of feed form and dietary fiber on the development of the gastrointestinal tract (GIT) and nutrient digestibility were studied in broilers at 8 and 21 d of age. The experiment included 14 treatments arranged as a 2 × 7 factorial with 2 feed forms (mash vs. pellet) and 7 diets that consisted in a low fiber diet and 6 extra diets resulting from the combination of 3 insoluble fiber sources [oat hulls (OH), rice hulls, and sunflower hulls] and 2 levels of inclusion (2.5 and 5.0%). Pelleting decreased the relative weight (% BW) of the full GIT, and empty gizzard (P < 0.001) and the relative length (cm/kg empty BW) of the small intestine and ceca (P < 0.001) and increased full crop (P < 0.001) and liver (P < 0.05) weights. Fiber inclusion increased the empty weight and the fresh digesta content of the gizzard (P < 0.001) but had limited and inconsistent effects on the weight of the full GIT or the length of the small intestine and ceca. Gizzard pH decreased with mash feeding and fiber inclusion (P < 0.001). Pelleting decreased ether extract retention (P < 0.05) but did not affect N retention or AMEn of the diets. Fiber inclusion improved nutrient retention (P < 0.05 to P < 0.001) with more pronounced effects with OH than with sunflower hulls or rice hulls inclusion. The AMEn of the diets increased (P < 0.05) with 2.5% of fiber inclusion but no extra benefits were obtained with a further increase to 5.0%. Starch ileal digestibility increased with mash feeding (P < 0.001) and fiber supplementation (P < 0.05). In summary, pelleting increases full crop weight and gizzard pH and decreased full gizzard weight and starch ileal digestibility. Moderate amounts of insoluble fiber, especially OH, increases gizzard weight, reduces gizzard pH, and improves nutrient digestibility in young broilers.","Scientific Note: Warming Nurses, a New Worker Role Recorded for the First Time in Stingless Bees.",https://www.ncbi.nlm.nih.gov/pubmed/30698798,Journal of economic entomology,2019 05 22,"Nest temperature is a crucial variable that determines colony survival in social insects. The successful production and development of a new brood, therefore, depends on stable thermal conditions and limited temperature oscillations. Thermoregulatory processes are useful in controlling both individual activity and for the maintenance of colony temperature. We measured heat production generated by nurse bees working on brood combs of the stingless bee Melipona scutellaris (Hymenoptera, Apidae, Meliponini) in this study; our results enabled us to identify the existence of a new task performed by nurse bees, referred to here as 'hot bees' because of their higher thorax surface temperature (4°C above that of other bees within the brood area). This additional heat has been little studied in stingless bees but is likely the result of thorax muscle contractions or, indeed, the development of this musculature as these are recently emerged individuals. We hypothesize that these 'hot bees' contribute to the maintenance of warmth within the nest brood area.",Human Survival Motor Neuron genes generate a vast repertoire of circular RNAs.,https://www.ncbi.nlm.nih.gov/pubmed/30698797,Nucleic acids research,2019 04 10,"Circular RNAs (circRNAs) perform diverse functions, including the regulation of transcription, translation, peptide synthesis, macromolecular sequestration and trafficking. Inverted Alu repeats capable of forming RNA:RNA duplexes that bring splice sites together for backsplicing are known to facilitate circRNA generation. However, higher limits of circRNAs produced by a single Alu-rich gene are currently not predictable due to limitations of amplification and analyses. Here, using a tailored approach, we report a surprising diversity of exon-containing circRNAs generated by the Alu-rich Survival Motor Neuron (SMN) genes that code for SMN, an essential multifunctional protein in humans. We show that expression of the vast repertoire of SMN circRNAs is universal. Several of the identified circRNAs harbor novel exons derived from both intronic and intergenic sequences. A comparison with mouse Smn circRNAs underscored a clear impact of primate-specific Alu elements on shaping the overall repertoire of human SMN circRNAs. We show the role of DHX9, an RNA helicase, in splicing regulation of several SMN exons that are preferentially incorporated into circRNAs. Our results suggest self- and cross-regulation of biogenesis of various SMN circRNAs. These findings bring a novel perspective towards a better understanding of SMN gene function.",Structural and functional analysis of the nucleotide and DNA binding activities of the human PIF1 helicase.,https://www.ncbi.nlm.nih.gov/pubmed/30698796,Nucleic acids research,2019 04 10,"Pif1 is a multifunctional helicase and DNA processing enzyme that has roles in genome stability. The enzyme is conserved in eukaryotes and also found in some prokaryotes. The functions of human PIF1 (hPIF1) are also critical for survival of certain tumour cell lines during replication stress, making it an important target for cancer therapy. Crystal structures of hPIF1 presented here explore structural events along the chemical reaction coordinate of ATP hydrolysis at an unprecedented level of detail. The structures for the apo as well as the ground and transition states reveal conformational adjustments in defined protein segments that can trigger larger domain movements required for helicase action. Comparisons with the structures of yeast and bacterial Pif1 reveal a conserved ssDNA binding channel in hPIF1 that we show is critical for single-stranded DNA binding during unwinding, but not the binding of G quadruplex DNA. Mutational analysis suggests that while the ssDNA-binding channel is important for helicase activity, it is not used in DNA annealing. Structural differences, in particular in the DNA strand separation wedge region, highlight significant evolutionary divergence of the human PIF1 protein from bacterial and yeast orthologues.",A general review of the biomechanics of root anchorage.,https://www.ncbi.nlm.nih.gov/pubmed/30698795,Journal of experimental botany,2019 01 30,"With few exceptions, terrestrial plants are anchored to substrates by roots that experience bending and twisting forces resulting from gravity- and wind-induced forces.

Corresponding data from 42 days of follow-up revealed that 820 of 3883 patients (21.1%) had recurrent P. vivax malaria before 2010, compared with 22 of 886 (2.5%) from 2010 onward (RR, 0.117; 95% CI, .077-.177; P < .0001). This 6-fold reduction suggests a recent decline in P. vivax transmission intensity and, thus, a substantial reduction in the proportion of individuals harboring hypnozoites.",How scientists can take the lead in establishing ethical practices for social media research.,https://www.ncbi.nlm.nih.gov/pubmed/30698793,Journal of the American Medical Informatics Association : JAMIA,2019 03 06,"Social media use has become ubiquitous in the United States, providing unprecedented opportunities for research. However, the rapidly evolving research landscape has far outpaced federal regulations for the protection of human subjects. Recent highly publicized scandals have raised legitimate concerns in the media about how social media data are being used. These circumstances combined with the absence of ethical standards puts even the best intentioned scientists at risk of possible research misconduct. The scientific community may need to lead the charge in insuring the ethical use of social media data in scientific research. We propose 6 steps the scientific community can take to lead this charge. We underscore the important role of funding agencies and universities to create the necessary ethics infrastructure to allow social media research to flourish in a way that is pro-technology, pro-science, and most importantly, pro-humanity.","Evaluating Lung Cancer Screening Uptake, Outcomes, and Costs in the United States: Challenges With Existing Data and Recommendations for Improvement.",https://www.ncbi.nlm.nih.gov/pubmed/30698792,Journal of the National Cancer Institute,2019 04 05,"The National Lung Screening Trial (NLST) reported substantial reduction in lung cancer mortality among high-risk individuals screened annually with low-dose helical computed tomography (LDCT). As a result, the US Preventive Services Task Force issued a B recommendation for annual LDCT in high-risk individuals, which requires private insurers to cover it without cost-sharing. The Medicare program also covers LDCT for high-risk beneficiaries without cost-sharing. However, the NLST findings may not be generalizable to the community setting because of differences in patients, providers, and practices participating in the NLST. Thus, examining uptake of LDCT screening in community practice is critical, as is evaluating the immediate and downstream outcomes of screening, including false-positive scans, follow-up examinations and adverse events, costs, stage of disease at diagnosis, and survival. This commentary presents an overview of the landscape of the data resources currently available to evaluate the uptake, outcomes, and costs of LDCT screening in the United States. We describe the strengths and limitations of existing data sources, including administrative databases, surveys, and registries. Thereafter, we provide recommendations for improving the data infrastructure pertaining to three overarching research areas: receipt of guideline-consistent screening and follow-up, weighing benefits and harms of screening, and costs of screening."

Our institution started in 2011 a LIMS project named the Laboratory Assistant Suite with the purpose of assisting researchers throughout all of their laboratory activities, providing graphical tools to support decision-making tasks and building complex analyses on integrated data. The modular architecture of the system exploits multiple databases with different technologies. To provide an efficient and easy tool for retrieving information of interest, we developed the Multi-Dimensional Data Manager (MDDM). By means of intuitive interfaces, scientists can execute complex queries without any knowledge of query languages or database structures, and easily integrate heterogeneous data stored in multiple databases. Together with the other software modules making up the platform, the MDDM has helped improve the overall quality of the data, substantially reduced the time spent with manual data entry and retrieval and ultimately broadened the spectrum of interconnections among the data, offering novel perspectives to the biomedical analysts.",Automatic identification of relevant chemical compounds from patents.,https://www.ncbi.nlm.nih.gov/pubmed/30698776,Database : the journal of biological databases and curation,2019 06 04,"In commercial research and development projects, public disclosure of new chemical compounds often takes place in patents. Only a small proportion of these compounds are published in journals, usually a few years after the patent. Patent authorities make available the patents but do not provide systematic continuous chemical annotations. Content databases such as Elsevier's Reaxys provide such services mostly based on manual excerptions, which are time-consuming and costly. Automatic text-mining approaches help overcome some of the limitations of the manual process. Different text-mining approaches exist to extract chemical entities from patents. The majority of them have been developed using sub-sections of patent documents and focus on mentions of compounds. Less attention has been given to relevancy of a compound in a patent. Relevancy of a compound to a patent is based on the patent's context. A relevant compound plays a major role within a patent. Identification of relevant compounds reduces the size of the extracted data and improves the usefulness of patent resources (e.g. supports identifying the main compounds). Annotators of databases like Reaxys only annotate relevant compounds. In this study, we design an automated system that extracts chemical entities from patents and classifies their relevance. The gold-standard set contained 18 789 chemical entity annotations. Of these, 10% were relevant compounds, 88% were irrelevant and 2% were equivocal. Our compound recognition system was based on proprietary tools. The performance (F-score) of the system on compound recognition was 84% on the development set and 86% on the test set. The relevancy classification system had an F-score of 86% on the development set and 82% on the test set. Our system can extract chemical compounds from patents and classify their relevance with high performance. This enables the extension of the Reaxys database by means of automation.",Advancing implementation frameworks with a mixed methods case study in child behavioral health.,https://www.ncbi.nlm.nih.gov/pubmed/30698775,Translational behavioral medicine,2019 01 30,"Despite a growing policy push for the provision of services based on evidence, evidence-based treatments for children and youth with mental health challenges have poor uptake, yielding limited benefit. With a view to improving implementation in child behavioral health, we investigated a complementary implementation approach informed by three implementation frameworks in the context of implementing motivational interviewing in four child and youth behavioral health agencies: the Active Implementation Frameworks (AIF) (process), the Consolidated Framework for Implementation Research (factors), and the Implementation Outcomes Framework (evaluation). The study design was mixed methods with embedded interrupted time series and motivational interviewing (MI) fidelity was the primary outcome. Focus groups and field notes informed perspectives on the implementation approach, and a questionnaire explored the salience of Consolidated Framework for Implementation Research (CFIR) factors. Findings validate the process guidance provided by the AIF and highlight CIFR factors related to implementation success. Novel CFIR factors, not elsewhere reported in the literature, are identified that could potentially extend the framework if validated in future research. Introducing fidelity measurement in practice proved challenging and was not sustained beyond the study. A complementary implementation approach was successful in implementing MI in child behavioral health agencies. In contrast with the typical train and hope approach to implementation, practice change did not occur immediately post-training but emerged over a 7 month period of consultation and practice following a discrete interactive training period. The saliency of CFIR constructs aligned with findings from studies conducted in other contexts, demonstrating external validity and highlighting common factors that can focus planning and measurement.",Lower Fatigue in Fit and Positive Women with Fibromyalgia: The al-Ándalus Project.,https://www.ncbi.nlm.nih.gov/pubmed/30698774,"Pain medicine (Malden, Mass.)",2019 01 30,"To analyze 1) the independent association of physical fitness, positive affect, and negative affect with the different dimensions of fatigue (general fatigue, physical fatigue, reduced activity, reduced motivation, and mental fatigue) and 2) whether the interactions of physical fitness, positive affect, and negative affect were associated with fatigue over and above the independent association.",Preference for Private Sector for Vaccination of Under-Five Children in India and Its Associated Factors: Findings from a Nationally Representative Sample.,https://www.ncbi.nlm.nih.gov/pubmed/30698773,Journal of tropical pediatrics,2019 01 30,Understanding the factors associated with private sector preference for vaccination will help in understanding the barriers in seeking public facility and also the steps to improve public-private partnership (PPP) model.,"Tebuconazole and Econazole Act Synergistically in Mediating Mitochondrial Stress, Energy Imbalance, and Sequential Activation of Autophagy and Apoptosis in Mouse Sertoli TM4 Cells: Possible Role of AMPK/ULK1 Axis.",https://www.ncbi.nlm.nih.gov/pubmed/30698772,Toxicological sciences : an official journal of the Society of Toxicology,2019 05 06,"Tebuconazole and Econazole are triazole and imidazole fungicides currently used worldwide. Although their reproductive toxicity in mammals has been described, their effect on male reproductive systems has been poorly investigated. As humans may be exposed to different azole compounds simultaneously, the combinational in vitro toxicity of Tebuconazole and Econazole (MIX) in mouse Sertoli TM4 cells was investigated. This study demonstrates that Tebuconazole (40 µM) and Econazole (20 µM) act synergistically in mediating decrease of mitochondrial membrane potential (ΔΨm) and changes in mitochondrial morphology. These events were associated with ATP depletion, cell cycle arrest, and sequential activation of autophagy and apoptosis. Remarkable differences on other parameters such as AMP/ATP ratio and adenylate energy charge were observed. Pharmacological inhibition of autophagy by bafilomycin A1 leads to enhanced MIX-induced apoptosis suggesting an adaptive cytoprotective function for MIX-modulated autophagy. Finally, a possible role of AMPK/ULK1 axis in mediating adaptive signalling cascades in response to energy stress was hypothesized. Consistently, ULK1 Ser 555 phosphorylation occurred in response to AMPK (Thr 172) activation. In conclusion, Tebuconazole and Econazole combination, at concentrations relevant for dermal and clinical exposure, induces a severe mitochondrial stress in SCs. Consequently, a prolonged exposure may affect the ability of the cells to re-establish homeostasis and trigger apoptosis.",Prolotherapy vs Radial Extracorporeal Shock Wave Therapy in the Short-term Treatment of Lateral Epicondylosis: A Randomized Clinical Trial.,https://www.ncbi.nlm.nih.gov/pubmed/30698771,"Pain medicine (Malden, Mass.)",2019 01 30,The aim of this study was to compare the efficacy of prolotherapy with hypertonic dextrose and radial shock wave therapy in chronic lateral epicondilosis.,A comparison of pump-controlled retrograde trial off to arterio-venous bridging for weaning from venoarterial extracorporeal membrane oxygenation.,https://www.ncbi.nlm.nih.gov/pubmed/30698769,European journal of cardio-thoracic surgery : official journal of the European Association for Cardio-thoracic Surgery,2019 01 30,The aim of the study is to compare a technique of pump-controlled retrograde trial off (PCRTO) to insertion of an arterio-venous (AV) bridge to conduct a trial from venoarterial extracorporeal membrane oxygenation (VA ECMO).,Identification of Cell Death Genes in Sea Urchin Paracentrotus lividus and Their Expression Patterns during Embryonic Development.,https://www.ncbi.nlm.nih.gov/pubmed/30698765,Genome biology and evolution,2019 03 21,"Apoptosis and autophagy are fundamental mechanisms of programed cell death activated during protostome and deuterostome embryonic development, contributing to the creation and remodeling of different anatomical structures. Programed cell death has been investigated at morphological and biochemical levels, but there is a lack of information concerning gene expression of death factors during deuterostome embryonic development. In this study, we analyze the expression patterns of 13 genes involved in autophagy, extrinsic and intrinsic apoptosis during blastula, gastrula, and pluteus stages of the sea urchin Paracentrotus lividus embryonic development. Results suggested the occurrence of all death mechanisms investigated, highlighting the simultaneous involvement of apoptosis and autophagy during embryonic development. In particular, gastrula was the developmental stage where the majority of death genes were highly expressed. During gastrulation apoptotic processes are fundamental for tissue remodeling, such as cavity formation and removal of inner ectodermal cells. This is the first report that identifies a panel of cell death genes in the P. lividus genome and analyzes their expression variations during ontogenesis.","Membrane Lipids, Waxes and Oxylipins in the Moss Model Organism Physcomitrella patens.",https://www.ncbi.nlm.nih.gov/pubmed/30698763,Plant & cell physiology,2019 06 13,"The moss Physcomitrella patens receives increased scientific interest since its genome was sequenced a decade ago. As a bryophyte, it represents the first group of plants that evolved in a terrestrial habitat still without a vascular system that developed later in tracheophytes. It is easily transformable via homologous recombination, which enables the formation of targeted loss-of-function mutants. Even though genetics, development and life cycle in Physcomitrella are well studied nowadays, research on lipids in Physcomitrella is still underdeveloped. This review aims on presenting an overview on the state of the art of lipid research with a focus on membrane lipids, surface lipids and oxylipins. We discuss in this review that Physcomitrella possesses very interesting features regarding its membrane lipids. Here, the presence of very-long-chain polyunsaturated fatty acids (VLC-PUFA) still shows a closer similarity to marine microalgae than to vascular plants. Unlike algae, Physcomitrella has a cuticle comparable to vascular plants composed of cutin and waxes. The presence of VLC-PUFA in Physcomitrella also leads to a greater variability of signaling lipids even though the phytohormone jasmonic acid is not present in this organism, which is different to vascular plants. In summary, the research on lipids in Physcomitrella is still in its infancy, especially considering membrane lipids. We hope that this review will help to promote the further advancement of lipid research in this important model organism in the future, so we can better understand how lipids are involved in the evolution of land plants."

However, in vitro Tel1 activation by MRX requires ATP binding to Rad50, suggesting a role also for the MR subcomplex in Tel1 activation. Here we describe two separation-of-functions alleles, mre11-S499P and rad50-A78T, which we show to specifically affect Tel1 activation without impairing MRX functions in DSB repair. Both Mre11-S499P and Rad50-A78T reduce Tel1-MRX interaction leading to poor Tel1 association at DSBs and consequent loss of Tel1 activation. The Mre11-S499P variant reduces Mre11-Rad50 interaction, suggesting an important role for MR complex formation in Tel1 activation. Molecular dynamics simulations show that the wild type MR subcomplex bound to ATP lingers in a tightly 'closed' conformation, while ADP presence leads to the destabilization of Rad50 dimer and of Mre11-Rad50 association, both events being required for MR conformational transition to an open state. By contrast, MRA78T undertakes complex opening even if Rad50 is bound to ATP, indicating that defective Tel1 activation caused by MRA78T results from destabilization of the ATP-bound conformational state.",The absence of the catalytic domains of Saccharomyces cerevisiae DNA polymerase ϵ strongly reduces DNA replication fidelity.,https://www.ncbi.nlm.nih.gov/pubmed/30698744,Nucleic acids research,2019 05 02,"The four B-family DNA polymerases α, δ, ϵ and ζ cooperate to accurately replicate the eukaryotic nuclear genome.

About half of this mutagenesis disappears upon deleting the REV3 gene encoding the catalytic subunit of Pol ζ. The remaining, still strong, mutator phenotype is synergistically elevated in an msh6Δ strain and has a mutation spectrum characteristic of mistakes made by Pol δ. The results support a model wherein slow-moving replication forks caused by the lack of Pol ϵ's catalytic domains result in greater involvement of mutagenic DNA synthesis by Pol ζ as well as diminished proofreading by Pol δ during replication.",Insight into novel RNA-binding activities via large-scale analysis of lncRNA-bound proteome and IDH1-bound transcriptome.,https://www.ncbi.nlm.nih.gov/pubmed/30698743,Nucleic acids research,2019 03 29,"RNA-binding proteins (RBPs) play pivotal roles in directing RNA fate and function. Yet the current annotation of RBPs is largely limited to proteins carrying known RNA-binding domains. To systematically reveal dynamic RNA-protein interactions, we surveyed the human proteome by a protein array-based approach and identified 671 proteins with RNA-binding activity. Among these proteins, 525 lack annotated RNA-binding domains and are enriched in transcriptional and epigenetic regulators, metabolic enzymes, and small GTPases. Using an improved CLIP (crosslinking and immunoprecipitation) method, we performed genome-wide target profiling of isocitrate dehydrogenase 1 (IDH1), a novel RBP. IDH1 binds to thousands of RNA transcripts with enriched functions in transcription and chromatin regulation, cell cycle and RNA processing. Purified IDH1, but not an oncogenic mutant, binds directly to GA- or AU-rich RNA that are also enriched in IDH1 CLIP targets.

However, as changes in codon recognition from one amino acid to another are more difficult to infer, such changes might have gone unnoticed in particular lineages with high evolutionary rates that are otherwise prone to codon reassignments. To gain further insight into the evolution of the mitochondrial genetic code in green plants, we have conducted an in-depth study across mtDNAs from 51 green plants (32 chlorophytes and 19 streptophytes). Besides confirming known stop-to-sense reassignments, our study documents the first cases of sense-to-sense codon reassignments in Chlorophyta mtDNAs. In several Sphaeropleales, we report the decoding of AGG codons (normally arginine) as alanine, by tRNA(CCU) of various origins that carry the recognition signature for alanine tRNA synthetase. In Chromochloris, we identify tRNA variants decoding AGG as methionine and the synonymous codon CGG as leucine. Finally, we find strong evidence supporting the decoding of AUA codons (normally isoleucine) as methionine in Pycnococcus. Our results rely on a recently developed conceptual framework (CoreTracker) that predicts codon reassignments based on the disparity between DNA sequence (codons) and the derived protein sequence. These predictions are then validated by an evaluation of tRNA phylogeny, to identify the evolution of new tRNAs via gene duplication and loss, and structural modifications that lead to the assignment of new tRNA identities and a change in the genetic code.",The y-ome defines the 35% of Escherichia coli genes that lack experimental evidence of function.,https://www.ncbi.nlm.nih.gov/pubmed/30698741,Nucleic acids research,2019 03 29,"Experimental studies of Escherichia coli K-12 MG1655 often implicate poorly annotated genes in cellular phenotypes. However, we lack a systematic understanding of these genes. How many are there? What information is available for them? And what features do they share that could explain the gap in our understanding? Efforts to build predictive, whole-cell models of E. coli inevitably face this knowledge gap. We approached these questions systematically by assembling annotations from the knowledge bases EcoCyc, EcoGene, UniProt and RegulonDB. We identified the genes that lack experimental evidence of function (the 'y-ome') which include 1600 of 4623 unique genes (34.6%), of which 111 have absolutely no evidence of function. An additional 220 genes (4.7%) are pseudogenes or phantom genes. y-ome genes tend to have lower expression levels and are enriched in the termination region of the E. coli chromosome. Where evidence is available for y-ome genes, it most often points to them being membrane proteins and transporters. We resolve the misconception that a gene in E. coli whose primary name starts with 'y' is unannotated, and we discuss the value of the y-ome for systematic improvement of E. coli knowledge bases and its extension to other organisms.",Temporal patterns of gene regulation and upstream regulators contributing to major developmental transitions during Rhesus macaque preimplantation development.,https://www.ncbi.nlm.nih.gov/pubmed/30698740,Molecular human reproduction,2019 03 29,"The preimplantation period of life in mammals encompasses a tremendous amount of restructuring and remodeling of the embryonic genome and reprogramming of gene expression. These vast changes support metabolic activation and cellular processes that drive early cleavage divisions and enable the creation of the earliest primitive cell lineages. A major question in mammalian embryology is how such vast, sweeping changes in gene expression are orchestrated, so that changes in gene expression are exactly appropriate to meet the developmental needs of the embryo over time. Using the rhesus macaque as an experimentally tractable model species closely related to the human, we combined high quality RNA-seq libraries, in-depth sequencing and advanced systems analysis to discover the underlying mechanisms that drive major changes in gene regulation during preimplantation development. We identified the major changes in mRNA population and the biological pathways and processes impacted by those changes. Most importantly, we identified 24 key upstream regulators that are themselves modulated during development and that are associated with the regulation of over 1000 downstream genes. Through their roles in extensive gene networks, these 24 upstream regulators are situated to either drive major changes in target gene expression or modify the cellular environment in which other genes function, thereby directing major developmental transitions in the preimplantation embryo. The data presented here highlight some of the specific molecular features that likely drive preimplantation development in a nonhuman primate species and provides an extensive database for novel hypothesis-driven studies.",Residual left ventricular hypertrophy with adverse clinical outcomes in patients with severe aortic stenosis and asymmetric septal hypertrophy after aortic valve replacement.,https://www.ncbi.nlm.nih.gov/pubmed/30698739,European journal of cardio-thoracic surgery : official journal of the European Association for Cardio-thoracic Surgery,2019 01 30,The aim of this study is to describe the temporal pattern of left atrial (LA) and left ventricular (LV) reverse remodelling and to evaluate the impact of residual LV hypertrophy on the prognosis of patients with severe aortic stenosis and asymmetric septal hypertrophy undergoing aortic valve replacement (AVR).,Early neurophysiological biomarkers and spinal cord pathology in inherited prion disease.,https://www.ncbi.nlm.nih.gov/pubmed/30698738,Brain : a journal of neurology,2019 03 05,"A common presentation of inherited prion disease is Gerstmann-Sträussler-Scheinker syndrome, typically presenting with gait ataxia and painful dysaesthesiae in the legs evolving over 2-5 years. The most frequent molecular genetic diagnosis is a P102L mutation of the prion protein gene (PRNP). There is no explanation for why this clinical syndrome is so distinct from Creutzfeldt-Jakob disease, and biomarkers of the early stages of disease have not been developed. Here we aimed, first, at determining if quantitative neurophysiological assessments could predict clinical diagnosis or disability and monitor progression and, second, to determine the neuropathological basis of the initial clinical and neurophysiological findings. We investigated subjects known to carry the P102L mutation in the longitudinal observational UK National Prion Monitoring Cohort study, with serial assessments of clinical features, peripheral nerve conduction, H and F components, threshold tracking and histamine flare and itch response and neuropathological examination in some of those who died. Twenty-three subjects were studied over a period of up to 12 years, including 65 neurophysiological assessments at the same department. Six were symptomatic throughout and six became symptomatic during the study. Neurophysiological abnormalities were restricted to the lower limbs. In symptomatic patients around the time of, or shortly after, symptom onset the H-reflex was lost. Lower limb thermal thresholds were at floor/ceiling in some at presentation, in others thresholds progressively deteriorated. Itch sensation to histamine injection was lost in most symptomatic patients. In six patients with initial assessments in the asymptomatic stage of the disease, a progressive deterioration in the ability to detect warm temperatures in the feet was observed prior to clinical diagnosis and the onset of disability. All of these six patients developed objective abnormalities of either warm or cold sensation prior to the onset of significant symptoms or clinical diagnosis. Autopsy examination in five patients (including two not followed clinically) showed prion protein in the substantia gelatinosa, spinothalamic tracts, posterior columns and nuclei and in the neuropil surrounding anterior horn cells. In conclusion, sensory symptoms and loss of reflexes in Gerstmann-Sträussler-Scheinker syndrome can be explained by neuropathological changes in the spinal cord. We conclude that the sensory symptoms and loss of lower limb reflexes in Gerstmann-Sträussler-Scheinker syndrome is due to pathology in the caudal spinal cord. Neuro-physiological measures become abnormal around the time of symptom onset, prior to diagnosis, and may be of value for improved early diagnosis and for recruitment and monitoring of progression in clinical trials.",TRF2 positively regulates SULF2 expression increasing VEGF-A release and activity in tumor microenvironment.,https://www.ncbi.nlm.nih.gov/pubmed/30698737,Nucleic acids research,2019 04 23,"The telomeric protein TRF2 is overexpressed in several human malignancies and contributes to tumorigenesis even though the molecular mechanism is not completely understood. By using a high-throughput approach based on the multiplexed Luminex X-MAP technology, we demonstrated that TRF2 dramatically affects VEGF-A level in the secretome of cancer cells, promoting endothelial cell-differentiation and angiogenesis. The pro-angiogenic effect of TRF2 is independent from its role in telomere capping. Instead, TRF2 binding to a distal regulatory element promotes the expression of SULF2, an endoglucosamine-6-sulfatase that impairs the VEGF-A association to the plasma membrane by inducing post-synthetic modification of heparan sulfate proteoglycans (HSPGs). Finally, we addressed the clinical relevance of our findings showing that TRF2/SULF2 expression is a worse prognostic biomarker in colorectal cancer (CRC) patients.",Astrocyte adenosine deaminase loss increases motor neuron toxicity in amyotrophic lateral sclerosis.,https://www.ncbi.nlm.nih.gov/pubmed/30698736,Brain : a journal of neurology,2019 03 05,"As clinical evidence supports a negative impact of dysfunctional energy metabolism on the disease progression in amyotrophic lateral sclerosis, it is vital to understand how the energy metabolic pathways are altered and whether they can be restored to slow disease progression. Possible approaches include increasing or rerouting catabolism of alternative fuel sources to supplement the glycolytic and mitochondrial pathways such as glycogen, ketone bodies and nucleosides. To analyse the basis of the catabolic defect in amyotrophic lateral sclerosis we used a novel phenotypic metabolic array. We profiled fibroblasts and induced neuronal progenitor-derived human induced astrocytes from C9orf72 amyotrophic lateral sclerosis patients compared to normal controls, measuring the rates of production of reduced nicotinamide adenine dinucleotides from 91 potential energy substrates. This approach shows for the first time that C9orf72 human induced astrocytes and fibroblasts have an adenosine to inosine deamination defect caused by reduction of adenosine deaminase, which is also observed in induced astrocytes from sporadic patients. Patient-derived induced astrocyte lines were more susceptible to adenosine-induced toxicity, which could be mimicked by inhibiting adenosine deaminase in control lines. Furthermore, adenosine deaminase inhibition in control induced astrocytes led to increased motor neuron toxicity in co-cultures, similar to the levels observed with patient derived induced astrocytes. Bypassing metabolically the adenosine deaminase defect by inosine supplementation was beneficial bioenergetically in vitro, increasing glycolytic energy output and leading to an increase in motor neuron survival in co-cultures with induced astrocytes. Inosine supplementation, in combination with modulation of the level of adenosine deaminase may represent a beneficial therapeutic approach to evaluate in patients with amyotrophic lateral sclerosis."

We therefore incorporated gene-alcohol interactions into a multiancestry genome-wide association study of levels of high-density lipoprotein cholesterol, low-density lipoprotein cholesterol, and triglycerides. We included 45 studies in stage 1 (genome-wide discovery) and 66 studies in stage 2 (focused follow-up), for a total of 394,584 individuals from 5 ancestry groups. Analyses covered the period July 2014-November 2017. Genetic main effects and interaction effects were jointly assessed by means of a 2-degrees-of-freedom (df) test, and a 1-df test was used to assess the interaction effects alone. Variants at 495 loci were at least suggestively associated (P < 1 × 10-6) with lipid levels in stage 1 and were evaluated in stage 2, followed by combined analyses of stage 1 and stage 2. In the combined analysis of stages 1 and 2, a total of 147 independent loci were associated with lipid levels at P < 5 × 10-8 using 2-df tests, of which 18 were novel. No genome-wide-significant associations were found testing the interaction effect alone.

In the present study, we assessed the antimicrobial activity of 2,5-bis(1-methylethyl)-pyrazine, produced by Paenibacillus sp. AD87 during co-culture with Burkholderia sp. AD24. In addition, we were using transcriptional reporter assays in E. coli and mammalian cells to decipher the possible mode of action. Bacterial and mammalian luciferase reporter strains were deployed to elucidate antimicrobial and toxicological effects of 2,5-bis(1-methylethyl)-pyrazine. At high levels of exposure, 2,5-bis(1-methylethyl)-pyrazine exerted strong DNA damage response. At lower concentrations, cell-wall damage response was observed. The activity was corroborated by a general toxicity reporter assay in E. coli ΔampD, defective in peptidoglycan turnover. The maximum E. coli cell-wall stress activity was measured at a concentration close to the onset of the mammalian cytotoxicity, while other adverse outcome pathways, such as the activation of aryl hydrocarbon and estrogenic receptor, the p53 tumour suppressor and the oxidative stress-related Nrf2 transcription factor, were induced at elevated concentrations compared to the response of mammalian cells. Because of its broad-spectrum antimicrobial activity at lower concentrations and the relatively low mammalian toxicity, 2,5-bis(1-methylethyl)-pyrazine is a potential bio-based fumigant with possible applications in food industry, agriculture or logistics.",Borrelia burgdorferi Infection in Biglycan Knockout Mice.,https://www.ncbi.nlm.nih.gov/pubmed/30698707,The Journal of infectious diseases,2019 06 05,"Borrelia burgdorferi sensu lato spirochetes (Borrelia) causing Lyme borreliosis are able to disseminate from the initial entry site to distant organs in the host.

In particular, highly regenerative species such as planarians and cnidarians can regenerate the whole body from an amputated fragment; however, a common molecular basis, if any, among these species remains unclear. Here, we show that genes encoding Jumonji C (JmjC) domain-containing proteins are associated with high regeneration ability. We classified 132 fully sequenced metazoans into two groups with high or low regeneration abilities and identified 118 genes conserved in the high regenerative group that were lost in species in the low regeneration group during evolution. Ninety-six percent of them were JmjC domain-encoding genes. We denoted the candidate genes as high regenerative species-specific JmjC domain-encoding genes (HRJDs). We observed losses of HRJDs in Helobdella robusta, which lost its high regeneration ability during evolution based on phylogenetic analysis. By RNA sequencing analyses, we observed that HRJD orthologs were differentially expressed during regeneration in two Cnidarians, as well as Platyhelminthes and Urochordata, which are highly regenerative species. Furthermore, >50% of the head and tail parts of amputated planarians (Dugesia japonica) died during regeneration after RNA interference of HRJD orthologs. These results indicate that HRJD are strongly associated with a high regeneration ability in metazoans. HRJD paralogs regulate gene expression by histone demethylation; thus, HRJD may be related to epigenetic regulation controlling stem cell renewal and stem cell differentiation during regeneration. We propose that HRJD play a central role in epigenetic regulation during regeneration."

Oestradiol and progesterone are major drivers for breast cancer proliferation, and androgens for prostate cancer. Endocrine therapies are drugs that interfere with hormone-activated pathways to slow cancer progression. Multiple new breakthrough drugs improving overall survival have recently been developed within this class. As the use of these latter drugs grows, incidence of cardiac arrhythmias has emerged as an unappreciated complication. These changes are not surprising given that sex hormones alter ventricular repolarization. Testosterone shortens action potential duration and QT interval duration, while oestradiol has an opposite effect. In patients with breast cancer, selective oestrogen receptor modulators are associated with more reports for long QT and torsade de pointes (TdP) than aromatase inhibitors, likely through an oestradiol-like effect on the heart. Cyclin-dependent kinase 4/6 inhibitors, a new class of anticancer drugs used in combination with endocrine therapies in hormone receptor positive breast cancer, are also variably associated with drug-induced long QT, particularly with ribociclib. In prostate cancer, androgen deprivation therapy is associated with long QT and TdP, and possibly atrial fibrillation for abiraterone. In this review, we have summarized the clinical and preclinical data focusing on cardiac arrhythmia considerations of hormone cancer therapies.",Hybrid versus catheter ablation in patients with persistent and longstanding persistent atrial fibrillation: a systematic review and meta-analysis.,https://www.ncbi.nlm.nih.gov/pubmed/30698685,European journal of cardio-thoracic surgery : official journal of the European Association for Cardio-thoracic Surgery,2019 01 30,"As the mechanisms underlying persistent atrial fibrillation (AF) are still incompletely understood, a 'gold standard' strategy for ablation is lacking. The results of catheter ablation, independent of the ablation strategy applied, are disappointing. Hybrid ablation, combining a thoracoscopic epicardial and transvenous endocardial approach, has shown more favourable outcomes. To date, studies comparing both techniques are lacking. Therefore, we conducted a systematic review and meta-analysis of hybrid versus catheter ablation in patients with persistent or longstanding persistent AF. A systematic literature search of studies reporting on catheter and hybrid ablation of persistent or longstanding persistent AF was performed in the PubMed database. All identified articles were screened and checked for eligibility. A meta-analysis was performed on inter-study heterogeneity and pooled correlation between baseline characteristics, primary and secondary outcomes of hybrid and catheter studies. From the 520 articles identified by the search, 34 articles could be included in the analysis. Hybrid ablation resulted in higher freedom of atrial arrhythmias in patients with persistent and longstanding-persistent AF than catheter ablation (70.7% vs 49.9%, P < 0.001). Although hybrid ablation had a slightly higher complication rate than catheter ablation, overall morbidity and mortality were low. In conclusion, hybrid ablation is more effective than catheter ablation in maintaining the sinus rhythm in patients with persistent or longstanding persistent AF. However, data directly comparing both techniques are lacking, and small, heterogenic, single-arm studies in a random-effects model prevent definite conclusions from being drawn. Therefore, larger randomized controlled trials directly comparing both techniques are needed.",Vedolizumab Trough Levels and Histological Healing During Maintenance Therapy in Ulcerative Colitis.,https://www.ncbi.nlm.nih.gov/pubmed/30698684,Journal of Crohn's & colitis,2019 01 30,"Histological healing may be the ultimate therapeutic goal in ulcerative colitis (UC).

We found that WFA blocks autophagy flux and lysosomal proteolytic activity in breast cancer cells. WFA increases accumulation of autophagosomes, LC3B-II-conversion, expression of autophagy-related proteins and autophagosome/lysosome fusion. Autolysosomes display the characteristics of acidic compartments in WFA-treated cells; however, the protein degradation activity of lysosomes is inhibited. Blockade of autophagic flux reduces the recycling of cellular fuels leading to insufficient substrates for tricarboxylic acid (TCA) cycle and impaired oxidative phosphorylation. WFA decreases expression and phosphorylation of LDHA, the key enzyme that catalyzes pyruvate-to-lactate conversion, reduces ATP levels and increases AMPK activation. AMPK-inhibition abrogates while AMPK-activation potentiates WFA's effect. WFA and 2-deoxyglucose combination elicits synergistic inhibition of breast cancer cells. Genetic-knockout of BECN1 and ATG7 fails to rescue cells from WFA-treatment; in contrast, addition of methyl pyruvate to supplement TCA cycle protects WFA-treated cells. Together, these results implicate that WFA is a potent lysosomal inhibitor; energetic impairment is required for WFA-induced apoptosis and growth-inhibition and combining WFA and 2DG is a promising therapeutic strategy for breast cancer.",Glucose-Lowering by Leptin in the Absence of Insulin Does Not Fully Rely on the Central Melanocortin System in Male Mice.,https://www.ncbi.nlm.nih.gov/pubmed/30698681,Endocrinology,2019 03 02,"Central leptin administration can ameliorate hyperglycemia in insulin-deficient rodent models independently of insulin; however, the underlying neuronal mechanism are unclear. Here, we investigate the contribution of key elements within the central melanocortin system by examining whether central leptin injection can ameliorate hyperglycemia in total insulin-deficient mice that either lacked melanocortin 4 receptors (MC4Rs) in the whole body [knockout (KO); MC4R KO] or selectively, in single-minded homolog 1 (SIM1)-expressing neurons (SIM1ΔMC4R). We further investigated the contribution of leptin receptors (LEPRs) in agouti-related protein (AgRP)-expressing neurons (AgRP∆LEPR). Leptin injections into the cerebral ventricle attenuated mortality and elevated blood glucose in total insulin-deficient MC4R KO mice. Total insulin-deficient SIM1ΔMC4R mice exhibited the same magnitude reduction of blood glucose in response to leptin injections as MC4R KO mice, suggesting SIM1 neurons are key to MC4R-mediated, insulin-independent, glucose-lowering effects of leptin. Central leptin injection also partially rescued glucose levels in total insulin-deficient AgRP∆LEPR mice. In brain slice studies, basal discharge of AgRP neurons from mice with total insulin deficiency was increased and leptin partially reduced their firing rate without membrane potential hyperpolarization. Collectively, our findings indicate that, contrary to glucose-lowering effects of leptin in the presence of insulin or partial insulin deficiency, MC4Rs in SIM1 neurons and LEPRs in AgRP neurons are not solely responsible for glucose-lowering effects of leptin in total insulin deficiency. This indicates that the central melanocortin system operates with other neuronal systems to fully mediate glucose-lowering effects of leptin in an insulin-independent manner.",Fumarates target the metabolic-epigenetic interplay of brain-homing T cells in multiple sclerosis.,https://www.ncbi.nlm.nih.gov/pubmed/30698680,Brain : a journal of neurology,2019 06 10,"Cell-permeable formulations of metabolites, such as fumaric acid esters, have been used as highly effective immunomodulators in patients with multiple sclerosis and yet their mechanism of action remains elusive. Since fumaric acid esters are metabolites, and cell metabolism is highly intertwined with the epigenetic regulation of gene expression, we investigated whether this metabolic-epigenetic interplay could be leveraged for therapeutic purposes. To this end we recruited 47 treatment-naïve and 35 fumaric acid ester-treated patients with multiple sclerosis, as well as 16 glatiramer acetate-treated patients as a non-metabolite treatment control. Here we identify a significant immunomodulatory effect of fumaric acid esters on the expression of the brain-homing chemokine receptor CCR6 in CD4 and CD8 T cells of patients with multiple sclerosis, which include T helper-17 and T cytotoxic-17 cells. We report differences in DNA methylation of CD4 T cells isolated from untreated and treated patients with multiple sclerosis, using the Illumina EPIC 850K BeadChip. We first demonstrate that Krebs cycle intermediates, such as fumaric acid esters, have a significantly higher impact on epigenome-wide DNA methylation changes in CD4 T cells compared to amino-acid polymers such as glatiramer acetate. We then define a fumaric acid ester treatment-specific hypermethylation effect on microRNA MIR-21, which is critical for the differentiation of T helper-17 cells. This hypermethylation effect was attributed to the subpopulation of T helper-17 cells using a decomposition analysis and was further validated in an independent prospective cohort of seven patients before and after treatment with fumaric acid esters. In vitro treatment of CD4 and CD8 T cells with fumaric acid esters supported a direct and dose-dependent effect on DNA methylation at the MIR-21 promoter. Finally, the upregulation of miR-21 transcripts and CCR6 expression was inhibited if CD4 or CD8 T cells stimulated under T helper-17 or T cytotoxic-17 polarizing conditions were treated with fumaric acid esters in vitro. These data collectively define a direct link between fumaric acid ester treatment and hypermethylation of the MIR-21 locus in both CD4 and CD8 T cells and suggest that the immunomodulatory effect of fumaric acid esters in multiple sclerosis is at least in part due to the epigenetic regulation of the brain-homing CCR6+ CD4 and CD8 T cells.",Prevalence and antimicrobial resistance of Mycoplasma genitalium infection among women living with HIV in South Africa: a prospective cohort study.,https://www.ncbi.nlm.nih.gov/pubmed/30698679,Clinical infectious diseases : an official publication of the Infectious Diseases Society of America,2019 01 30,"This prospective cohort study of 622 women living with HIV from Johannesburg (2012) detected MG in 7.4%(95%CI:5.5-9.7, 46/622), with detection more likely with lower CD4 counts(AOR 1.02 per 10 cells/μL decrease, 95%CI:1.00-1.03) and higher plasma HIV-1 RNA(AOR 1.15 per log copies/mL increase, 95%CI:1.03-1.27).

Here, we utilized UVB radiation, a potent inducer of DNA damage, p53, apoptosis and skin cancer to investigate the mechanism of C/EBPβ in regulating p53-mediated apoptosis in keratinocytes and to test whether the deletion of C/EBPβ in epidermis can protect mice from UVB-induced skin cancer. UVB-treatment of C/EBPβ skin conditional knockout (CKOβ) mice increased p53 protein levels in epidermis and enhanced p53-dependent apoptotic activity 3-fold compared to UVB-treated control mice. UVB increased C/EBPβ levels through a p53-dependent pathway and stimulated the formation of a C/EBPβ-p53 protein complex; knockdown of C/EBPβ increased p53 protein stability in keratinocytes. These results suggest a p53-C/EBPβ feedback loop, whereby C/EBPβ a transcriptional target of a p53 pathway, functions as a survival factor by negatively regulating p53 apoptotic activity in response to DNA damage. RNAseq analysis of UVB-treated CKOβ epidermis unexpectedly revealed that type 1 interferon (IFN) pathway was the most highly enriched pathway. Numerous proapoptotic ISGs were up-regulated including some known to enhance p53 apoptosis. Our results indicate that p53 and IFN pathways function together in response to DNA damage to result in the activation of extrinsic apoptosis pathways and caspase 8 cleavage. Lastly, we observed CKOβ mice were resistant to UVB-induced skin cancer. Our results suggest C/EBPβ represses apoptosis through keratinocyte autonomous suppression of the type 1 IFN response and p53 to increase cell survival and susceptibility to UVB-induced skin cancer.",The CD26/DPP4-inhibitor vildagliptin suppresses lung cancer growth via macrophage-mediated NK cell activity.,https://www.ncbi.nlm.nih.gov/pubmed/30698677,Carcinogenesis,2019 04 29,"CD26/dipeptidyl peptidase 4 (DPP4) is a transmembrane protein which is expressed by various malignant cells. We found that the expression of CD26/DPP4 was significantly higher in lung adenocarcinoma samples in our own patient cohort compared to normal lung tissue. We therefore hypothesize that the inhibition of CD26/DPP4 can potentially suppress lung cancer growth. The CD26/DPP4 inhibitor vildagliptin was employed on Lewis Lung Carcinoma (LLC) cell line and a human lung adenocarcinoma (H460) cell line. Two weeks after subcutaneous injection of tumor cells into C57BL/6 and CD1/nude mice, the size of LLC and H460 tumors was significantly reduced by vildagliptin. Immunohistochemically, the number of macrophages (F4/80+) and NK cells (NKp46+) was significantly increased in vildagliptin-treated tumor samples. Mechanistically, we found in vitro that lung cancer cell lines expressed increased levels of surfactant protein upon vildagliptin treatment thereby promoting the pro-inflammatory activity of macrophages. By the depletion of macrophages with clodronate and by using NK cell deficient (IL-15-/-) mice, tumors reversed to the size of controls, suggesting that indeed macrophages and NK cells were responsible for the observed tumor-suppressing effect upon vildagliptin treatment. FACS analysis showed tumor-infiltrating NK cells to express tumor necrosis-related apoptosis-inducing ligand (TRAIL) which induced the intra-cellular stress marker γH2AX. Accordingly, we found upregulated γH2AX in vildagliptin-treated tumors and TRAIL-treated cell lines. Moreover, the effect of vildagliptin-mediated enhanced NK cell cytotoxicity could be reversed by antagonizing the TRAIL receptor. Our data provide evidence that the CD26/DPP4-inhibitor vildagliptin reduces lung cancer growth. We could demonstrate that this effect is exerted by surfactant-activated macrophages and NK cells that act against the tumor via TRAIL-mediated cytotoxicity.","Impact of tricuspid annular size reduction on right ventricular function, geometry and strain.",https://www.ncbi.nlm.nih.gov/pubmed/30698674,European journal of cardio-thoracic surgery : official journal of the European Association for Cardio-thoracic Surgery,2019 01 30,"Restrictive tricuspid annuloplasty is a clinically accepted approach to treat functional tricuspid regurgitation.

Several methods have been proposed for pairwise alignment of single molecule optical maps - called Rmaps, or for aligning optical maps to assembled reads. However, the problem of aligning an Rmap to a graph representing the sequence data of the same genome has not been studied before.

In this article, we introduce a simple two-stage estimation technique for estimation of non-linear associations between latent variables. Here both steps are based on fitting linear SEMs: first a linear model is fitted to data on the latent predictor and terms describing the non-linear effect are predicted by their conditional means. In the second step, the predictions are included in a linear model for the latent outcome variable. We show that this procedure is consistent and identifies its asymptotic distribution. We also illustrate how this framework easily allows the association between latent variables to be modeled using restricted cubic splines, and we develop a modified estimator which is robust to non-normality of the latent predictor.

Following this view, LCRs can also be defined as regions showing composition bias. In this critical review, we focus on the definition of sequence complexity of LCRs and their connection with structure. We present statistics and methodological approaches that measure low complexity (LC) and related sequence properties. Composition bias is often associated with LC and disorder, but repeats, while compositionally biased, might also induce ordered structures. We illustrate this dichotomy, and more generally the overlaps between different properties related to LCRs, using examples. We argue that statistical measures alone cannot capture all structural aspects of LCRs and recommend the combined usage of a variety of predictive tools and measurements. While the methodologies available to study LCRs are already very advanced, we foresee that a more comprehensive annotation of sequences in the databases will enable the improvement of predictions and a better understanding of the evolution and the connection between structure and function of LCRs.

MnO2 NPs were synthesized simply and quickly through an in situ redox reaction by mixing bovine serum albumin (BSA) and KMnO4, in which BSA served the dual roles of template and reductant. It was found that the MnO2 NPs served as an effective energy acceptor and quenched the fluorescence intensity of carbon dots (CDs), owing to the fluorescence resonance energy transfer (FRET) process. Further, the addition of GSH triggered the decomposition of MnO2, breaking the FRET between MnO2 NPs and CDs and thus restoring the fluorescence intensity of CDs. Based on this mechanism, quantitative determination of GSH was performed. Under optimal conditions, a satisfactory linear range of 0.05-90 μM and limit of detection of 39 nM were obtained, and GSH content in human serum samples was detected. Moreover, taking advantage of the higher levels of GSH in cancer cells than in normal cells, the MnO2 NP-CD probe was applied to distinguish SMMC-7721 cancer cells from L02 normal cells. The FRET was interrupted by GSH in cancer cells, and strong fluorescence was observed. This work provides a facile approach for synthesizing MnO2 NPs, and this rapid, low-cost method with no need for reductants makes synthesis green and convenient. The MnO2 NP-mediated fluorescent turn-on response to GSH could improve the MnO2 nanomaterial-based biochemical analysis applications.",A near-infrared C2H2/CH4 dual-gas sensor system combining off-axis integrated-cavity output spectroscopy and frequency-division-multiplexing-based wavelength modulation spectroscopy.,https://www.ncbi.nlm.nih.gov/pubmed/30698590,The Analyst,2019 03 13,"By combining frequency division multiplexing assisted wavelength modulation spectroscopy (FDM-WMS) and off-axis integrated-cavity output spectroscopy (OA-ICOS), a near-infrared (near-IR) dual-gas sensor system was demonstrated for simultaneous chemical gas-phase detection of acetylene (C2H2) and methane (CH4). Two distributed feedback (DFB) lasers modulated at the frequency of 3 kHz and 4 kHz with an emitting wavelength of 1532 and 1653 nm were used to target two absorption lines, C2H2 at 6523.88 cm-1 and CH4 at 6046.95 cm-1, respectively. A 6 cm-long cavity was fabricated, which reveals an effective path length of 9.28 m (@1532 nm, C2H2) and 8.56 m (@1653 nm, CH4), respectively. Performances of the dual-gas sensor system were experimentally evaluated using C2H2 and CH4 samples generated by an Environics gas mixing system. An Allan deviation of 700 parts-per-billion in volume (ppbv) for C2H2 with an averaging time of 200 s and 850 ppbv for CH4 with an averaging time of 150 s was achieved for these two gas species. Dynamic measurements of a C2H2/CH4 : N2 mixture were performed for monitoring both C2H2 and CH4 simultaneously.

Therefore, a direct, sensitive and specific method for detection of tumor exosomes will contribute to the diagnosis and prognosis of cancer. In this work, we take advantage of the facile adaptability of aptamers to design an exosome quantitative method, which converts an exosome capture event to nucleic acid detection. With the help of a hairpin DNA cascade reaction (HDCR) and easy accessibility of DNA dendrimer self-assembly, dual signal amplification was achieved. A CD63 aptamer linked via a DNA probe to magnetic beads acts as the capture component. In the presence of target exosomes, aptamers identify and combine with exosomes, releasing the DNA probe as a trigger to initiate the HDCR (the first signal amplification process) by opening hairpin DNA (HP1) bound to gold nanoparticles (AuNPs). Fluorescently-labeled DNA dendrimers concatenate with HP1 as the second signal amplification stage to increase the signal-to-noise ratio. Under the optimal conditions, our method achieved a good linear response for HepG2 cell-derived exosomes in a concentration range from 1.75 × 103 to 7.0 × 106 particles per μL with a detection limit of 1.16 × 103 particles per μL.

In the present study, we comparatively investigated the effects of DHA-phosphatidylcholine (PC) and the recombination of DHA-ethyl ester (EE) with egg PC on improving the dysfunction of memory and cognition in senescence-accelerated prone 8 (SAMP8) mice and illustrated the possible underlying mechanisms. Results showed that DHA-PC exhibited stronger effects than the recombination of DHA-EE with egg PC on improving the dysfunction of memory and cognition via suppressing Aβ generation, neuro-inflammation and apoptosis, and improving neurotrophins.

SAXS enables us to follow the structural rearrangements after extrusion at different distances from the spinning nozzle. The kinetics of the spinning process is examined as a function of the composition of block copolymer solutions and the spinning parameters. We studied the influence of the extrusion rate on the block copolymer microdomains and their self-assembly in weakly segregated and ordered solutions. The addition of magnesium acetate (MgAc2) leads to the ordering of micelles in the block copolymer solution already at lower polymer concentrations and shows an increased number of micelles with larger domain spacing as compared to the pristine solution. The SAXS data show the effect of shear within the spinneret on the self-assembly of block copolymers and the kinetics of phase separation after extrusion. It is observed that the ordering of micelles in solutions is decreased as indicated by the loss of crystallinity while high extrusion rates orient the structures perpendicular to the fiber direction. The structural features obtained from in situ SAXS experiments are correlated to the structure in the block copolymer solutions in the absence of shear and the morphologies in flat sheet and HF membranes obtained by ex situ SEM. This allows a systematic and comparative study of the effects varying the microdomain ordering within different block copolymer solutions and the formed membrane structures.,Atomistic insights into the dynamics of binary collisions between gaseous molecules and polycyclic aromatic hydrocarbon dimers.,https://www.ncbi.nlm.nih.gov/pubmed/30698583,Physical chemistry chemical physics : PCCP,2019 02 15,"Polycyclic aromatic hydrocarbon (PAH) dimers are important intermediates in combustion and soot formation. The scattering dynamics of gaseous molecules colliding with PAH dimers and the subsequent PAH dimer stability are investigated by performing molecular dynamics (MD) simulations. Effects of properties of the surrounding gaseous molecules and PAH dimers as well as temperature are investigated in this study. Depending on the residence time of N2 molecules trapped by the PAH dimers, two scattering types, that is, specular scattering and inelastic scattering, have been observed, which is correlated to the temperature and the type of the PAH dimer. Specifically, specular scattering preferentially takes place at high temperatures on small PAH dimers, while inelastic scattering tends to happen at low temperatures on large PAH dimers. During collision, energy transfer between the gaseous molecule and the PAH dimer changes the thermodynamic stability of the PAH dimer. Statistical analysis indicates that the decomposition rate of a PAH dimer to PAH monomers is sensitive to temperature and the PAH dimer type. Furthermore, effects of the gaseous molecule type on the PAH dimer stability are considered. The molecular mass of the colliding gaseous molecule is a key factor in determining the PAH dimer stability, as heavier gaseous molecules are more effective in promoting the PAH dimer decomposition. Results from this study indicate that collisions with gaseous molecules decrease the PAH dimer stability, while increasing the PAH dimer size and decreasing the collision temperature both decrease the decomposition rate of the PAH dimer."

The review highlights the increasing interest to this problem and converging positions of researchers from different countries, encouraged by the development of international and other classifications of mental diseases, on the terminology, classification and prevalence of ASD in children. An important feature of the present stage is to draw attention to an understudied problem of ASD in adults, including elderly, and provision of medical and social care to these patients.",[A role of inflammasomes in the pathogenesis of neurological and mental diseases].,https://www.ncbi.nlm.nih.gov/pubmed/30698567,Zhurnal nevrologii i psikhiatrii imeni S.S. Korsakova,2019 05 30,"Inflammasomes are macromolecular complexes that contain many copies of receptors recognizing molecular patterns of pathogenic agents (PAMP) and damage-associated structures (DAMP), and also include molecules of adapter protein ASC and procaspase-1. Activation of inflammasomes leads to the formation of active caspase-1 that, in turn, provides the maturation of pro-IL-1β and pro-IL-18 to IL-1β and IL-18. The latter cytokines play an important role in control of neuroinlfammation in the central nervous system contributing to the pathogenesis of a series of neurological, neurodegenerative and mental disorders. The review discusses the involvement of NLRP3 inflammasome and other their types in the development of the traumatic brain injury, ischemic and hemorrhagic stroke, brain tumors, CNS infections, Alzheimer's and Parkinson's diseases, epilepsy, amyotrophic lateral sclerosis, depressiver, and consequences of alcohol abuse. The elucidation of molecular mechanisms and signaling pathways controlled by inflammasomes will allow the development of new therapeutic measures for diseases, in which neuroinflammation plays a leading pathogenetic role.",[A role of the immune system in the pathogenesis of schizophrenia].,https://www.ncbi.nlm.nih.gov/pubmed/30698566,Zhurnal nevrologii i psikhiatrii imeni S.S. Korsakova,2019 05 30,"The review addresses immunological aspects of schizophrenia, a multifactor disease caused by genetic factors, innate disorders of the central nervous system (CNS), including the consequences of perinatal hypoxia and infections, and adverse environmental influences. Neuroinflammation as a part of the pathophysiology of schizophrenia is characterized by the higher transcription of CNS inflammatory mediators, excessive activation of microglia, inhibition of glutamatergic receptors that leads to the decrease in the number of cortical synapses and neuronal apoptosis. The authors discuss a role of genetic polymorphisms of cytokine genes, complement system components etc. The literature data on the changes in systemic immune response and imbalance in Th1/Th2 adaptive immune responses are analyzed as well. Some papers showed higher levels of proinflammatory mediators in CSF and blood of patients with schizophrenia that indicated the involvement of blood brain barrier (BBB) dysfunction. The authors present the recent data on BBB dysfunction in schizophrenia and its role in the pathogenesis of the disease, autoimmunity in patients comparing it with immune activation and genetic predisposition. An important and arguable issues about a role of parasite and viral infections in the pathogenesis of schizophrenia, initiation of immune responses and direct impacts on the brain, an influence of antipsychotic treatment on immunity are discussed. In author's opinion, conflicting results of genetic and immunological studies of schizophrenia may be explained by different methodological approaches to selection of patients and healthy controls and the differences in schizophrenia classification.",[Massive parallel sequencing for molecular-genetic diagnosis of mental retardation].,https://www.ncbi.nlm.nih.gov/pubmed/30698565,Zhurnal nevrologii i psikhiatrii imeni S.S. Korsakova,2019 05 30,"Gene mutations occur with high frequency in children with mental retardation. Standard diagnostic methods, such as TMS, Sanger's sequencing of individual genes, MLPA analysis of deletions, and investigation of methylation status in Martin-Bell syndrome are not informative in the majority of cases that hampered further diagnostic efforts. Massive parallel sequencing (MPS) allowed physicians to continue diagnostic search in previously undiagnosed cases and to find molecular causes of disease. MPS permits to discover a large number of new genes and understand the pathogenesis of mental retardation and brain development more deeply. It became possible to perform prenatal and pre-implantation diagnostics. However, big data generate big problems with their interpretation the genetic counselor faces with. This review reflects the advantages and disadvantages of MPS. Different variants of MPS, including gene panels, whole exome and whole genome sequencing as well as sequencing of trios, are described. In addition, the authors discuss the difficulties of interpretation of the results and recommendations for obtaining the most accurate results.",[Sleep-wake cycle and experimental models of Panx1 mutations].,https://www.ncbi.nlm.nih.gov/pubmed/30698564,Zhurnal nevrologii i psikhiatrii imeni S.S.

Psychopathological symptoms developed in the toxicogenic phase and continued to increase during the first days of treatment, followed by transformation into a deliberate delirium and toxic nephropathy. Comprehensive treatment, including infusion-detoxification therapy, correction of acid-base and hypoxic disorders using cytoflavin, had a positive effect on the clinical course of poisoning and allowed for a favorable outcome of acute exogenous psychosis."
