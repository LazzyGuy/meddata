Central European countries are some of the most important producers of blueberries, raspberries and strawberries in the world and organic cultivation methods for these fruits have a significant market share. Fungal pathogens are considered to be the most significant threat to organic crops of berries, causing serious economic losses and reducing yields. In order to ameliorate the harmful effects of pathogenic fungi on cultivations, the application of rapid and effective identification methods is essential.

PIU has been recently associated with autism spectrum disorder (ASD) and autistic traits. Subjects with PIU report an increased suicidal risk and the same has been demonstrated among patients with ASD. The aim of this study was to investigate putative PIU rates among students and explore the correlation between autistic traits and suicide risk. Methods: A sample of 178 high achieving university students was assessed by means of the Adult Autism Subthreshold Spectrum (AdAS Spectrum), Autism Quotient questionnaire (AQ). Suicide risk was investigated by some specific items of the Trauma and Loss Spectrum-Self Report (TALS-SR) and putative PIU was identified on the basis of a specific AdAS Spectrum item. Results: 27.5% subjects reporting putative PIU. This subgroup showed higher scores in all domains of AdAS Spectrum and AQ compared with others. Students with putative PIU showed a significant correlation between suicide risk and the non-verbal communication domain of the AdAS Spectrum and the Social skills domain of the AQ. Conclusions: We found that students with PIU show higher levels of autistic traits compared to those without PIU. A significant correlation was found between autistic traits and suicide risk.",Interventions Aimed at Increasing Dairy and/or Calcium Consumption of Preschool-Aged Children: A Systematic Literature Review.,https://www.ncbi.nlm.nih.gov/pubmed/30934755,Nutrients,2019 06 10,"Dairy product consumption is important during childhood, as dairy products provide nutrients to support growth and development. However, a high proportion of children globally are not meeting recommended daily intakes, which may have long-term health implications. Accumulating evidence suggests that interventions aimed at instilling healthy lifestyle habits are most effective when initiated during the preschool years. Therefore, the purpose of the review was to identify the characteristics of effective dairy and/or calcium interventions targeting preschool-aged children. A systematic literature review identified 14 intervention studies published between 1998⁻2018 addressing dairy/calcium intakes in the preschool population (1.5 to 5 years). Intervention reporting was assessed using intervention intensity, behavior change techniques and Workgroup for Intervention Development and Evaluation Research (WIDER), with the quality of studies evaluated using risk of bias and Grades of Recommendation, Assessment, Development and Evaluation (GRADE). Five of the 14 studies included in the review reported significant improvements in children's dairy (4/5) or calcium (1/5) intake. Characteristics that may enable intervention effectiveness include the delivery of interventions in one setting (preschool facility), using specific behavior change techniques (environmental restructuring and teach to use prompts/cues), and targeting both parent and child. Overall, the interventions assessed demonstrated variable success and highlighted the need for developing effective interventions designed to increase dairy and/or calcium intakes in preschool-aged children.",Usability and Engagement Evaluation of an Unguided Online Program for Promoting a Healthy Lifestyle and Reducing the Risk for Eating Disorders and Obesity in the School Setting.,https://www.ncbi.nlm.nih.gov/pubmed/30934754,Nutrients,2019 06 10,"Implementing integrated online prevention to reduce the risk of both obesity and eating disorders, in the school setting, is a promising approach. The challenge is to develop highly user-friendly and motivating programs, to foster adherence and effectiveness. The purpose of this study was to evaluate the usability of such a universal prevention program for students aged 14⁻19 years, and to address engagement issues. A mixed-methods approach was chosen, consisting of a think-aloud task, a semi-structured interview, and a questionnaire including items on sociodemographic characteristics and the System Usability Scale (SUS). Usability tests were conducted in two rounds, with five adolescents participating per round. Mean score in the SUS was 92.5 of 100 points (range 85⁻100), in the second round, after some adaptations from the participants' feedback. In the course of the think-aloud tasks and interviews, five major themes emerged-visual design, navigation, mode of transfer, content, and engagement conditions. Interesting headlines, gamification, and monitoring tools are crucial for engagement. Apart from the importance of using the program during school hours, the study showed that problems currently perceived as important by the target group, need to be considered and addressed, prior to offering them prevention programs, which highlights the importance of a user-centered design.",Targeting Receptor Kinases in Colorectal Cancer.,https://www.ncbi.nlm.nih.gov/pubmed/30934752,Cancers,2019 06 10,"Colorectal cancer is the third most common malignancy in men and the second most common cancer in women. Despite the success of screening programs and the development of adjuvant therapies, the global burden of colorectal cancer is expected to increase by 60% to more than 2.2 million new cases and 1.1 million deaths by 2030. In recent years, a great effort has been made to demonstrate the utility of protein kinase inhibitors for cancer treatment. Considering this heterogeneous disease is defined by mutations that activate different Receptor Tyrosine Kinases (RTKs) and affect downstream components of RTK-activated transduction pathways, in this review we analyze the potential utility of different kinase inhibitors for colorectal cancer treatment.",Co-Amended Synergistic Interactions between Arbuscular Mycorrhizal Fungi and the Organic Substrate-Induced Cucumber Yield and Fruit Quality Associated with the Regulation of the AM-Fungal Community Structure under Anthropogenic Cultivated Soil.,https://www.ncbi.nlm.nih.gov/pubmed/30934751,International journal of molecular sciences,2019 04 30,"Monotonous cucumber double-cropping systems under plastic greenhouse vegetable cultivation (PGVC) previously intensified by long-term anthropogenic activities and manipulative treatments leads to a crop productivity reduction and soil biota disturbances. In this study, the role of the indigenous arbuscular mycorrhizal strain (AM: Glomus versiforme L.) and organic substrate (GS: Garlic stalk) application were assessed for plant microbe interaction and crop productivity feedback in a greenhouse (2016⁻2018) under a cultivated Anthrosol characterized as a replanted degraded soil. We found that repetitively adding AM inocula with organic substrates (GS) improved the cucumber growth and physiology. The useful trait of AM symbiosis with C-amended organic substrates preferentially manifested as increased root colonization, hyphal density proliferation, AM sporulation, root activity, and suppressed Fusarium incidence. The post AM development further prevailed the synergistic interaction, and the co-inoculation effect resulted in an increase in fruit nutrition uptake, seasonal cucumber yield and fruit quality attributes. Illumina MiSeq analysis of the 18S rRNA gene amplicons revealed that the dominant AM genera that are particularly enriched with the Glomus taxon may be important ecological drivers associated with plant productivity and fruit quality characteristics. These results suggest that the AM-organic substrate association might be a pragmatic option for use as an economic and efficient biological resource and as a newly-sustainable plant microbe mediator to enhance the regional ecosystem services and plant productivity of the anthropogenic PGVC of this region.","COSMOS: Collaborative, Seamless and Adaptive Sentinel for the Internet of Things.",https://www.ncbi.nlm.nih.gov/pubmed/30934750,"Sensors (Basel, Switzerland)",2019 04 30,"The Internet of Things (IoT) became established during the last decade as an emerging technology with considerable potentialities and applicability. Its paradigm of everything connected together penetrated the real world, with smart devices located in several daily appliances. Such intelligent objects are able to communicate autonomously through already existing network infrastructures, thus generating a more concrete integration between real world and computer-based systems. On the downside, the great benefit carried by the IoT paradigm in our life brings simultaneously severe security issues, since the information exchanged among the objects frequently remains unprotected from malicious attackers. The paper at hand proposes COSMOS (Collaborative, Seamless and Adaptive Sentinel for the Internet of Things), a novel sentinel to protect smart environments from cyber threats. Our sentinel shields the IoT devices using multiple defensive rings, resulting in a more accurate and robust protection. Additionally, we discuss the current deployment of the sentinel on a commodity device (i.e., Raspberry Pi). Exhaustive experiments are conducted on the sentinel, demonstrating that it performs meticulously even in heavily stressing conditions. Each defensive layer is tested, reaching a remarkable performance, thus proving the applicability of COSMOS in a distributed and dynamic scenario such as IoT. With the aim of easing the enjoyment of the proposed sentinel, we further developed a friendly and ease-to-use COSMOS App, so that end-users can manage sentinel(s) directly using their own devices (e.g., smartphone).","Metagenomic Profiling of Microbial Pathogens in the Little Bighorn River, Montana.",https://www.ncbi.nlm.nih.gov/pubmed/30934749,International journal of environmental research and public health,2019 05 29,"The Little Bighorn River is the primary source of water for water treatment plants serving the local Crow Agency population, and has special significance in the spiritual and ceremonial life of the Crow tribe. Unfortunately, the watershed suffers from impaired water quality, with high counts of fecal coliform bacteria routinely measured during run-off events. A metagenomic analysis was carried out to identify potential pathogens in the river water. The Oxford Nanopore MinION platform was used to sequence DNA in near real time to identify both uncultured and a coliform-enriched culture of microbes collected from a popular summer swimming area of the Little Bighorn River. Sequences were analyzed using CosmosID bioinformatics and, in agreement with previous studies, enterohemorrhagic and enteropathogenic Escherichia coli and other E. coli pathotypes were identified. Noteworthy was detection and identification of enteroaggregative E. coli O104:H4 and Vibrio cholerae serotype O1 El Tor, however, cholera toxin genes were not identified. Other pathogenic microbes, as well as virulence genes and antimicrobial resistance markers, were also identified and characterized by metagenomic analyses. It is concluded that metagenomics provides a useful and potentially routine tool for identifying in an in-depth manner microbial contamination of waterways and, thereby, protecting public health.",The Potential Role of Insects as Feed: A Multi-Perspective Review.,https://www.ncbi.nlm.nih.gov/pubmed/30934748,Animals : an open access journal from MDPI,2019 06 10,"Recently, insects have received increased attention as an important source of sustainable raw materials for animal feed, especially in fish, poultry, and swine. In particular, the most promising species are represented by the black soldier fly (Hermetia illucens, HI), the yellow mealworm (Tenebrio molitor, TM), and the common house fly (Musca domestica, MD). Although rapid development is expected, insects remain underutilized in the animal feed industry mainly due to technical, financial, and regulatory barriers. In addition, few works have analyzed consumer and stakeholder points of view towards the use of insects as animal feed. In this article, we summarize the main findings of this body of research and provide a discussion of consumer studies regarding the consumption of animals fed with insects. Our review suggests that consumer acceptance will not be a barrier towards the development of this novel protein industry. Furthermore, we conclude that it will be of interest to understand whether the use of this more sustainable feed source might increase consumer willingness to pay for animal products fed with insects and whether the overall acceptability, from a sensory point of view, will be perceived better than conventional products. Finally, the main challenges of the feed farming industry are addressed.",A Durum Wheat Variety-Based Product Is Effective in Reducing Symptoms in Patients with Non-Celiac Gluten Sensitivity: A Double-Blind Randomized Cross-Over Trial.,https://www.ncbi.nlm.nih.gov/pubmed/30934747,Nutrients,2019 06 10,"Patients with non-celiac gluten sensitivity (NCGS) do not have celiac disease, but their symptoms improve after a gluten-free diet (GFD). However, to date, it is uncertain if gluten or other components of wheat are responsible for these symptoms. The aim of this study was to compare the effects of an organic durum wheat variety with those of standard commercial wheat in patients with known NCGS. We performed a double-blind randomized cross-over trial of 42 patients (mean age 45 years, 8 men) with NCGS diagnosed according to the Salerno criteria and adherence to GFD for at least 12 weeks from screening. Enrolled subjects were randomly assigned to one the following groups of treatment: (A) a two-week diet with Senatore Cappelli wheat variety pasta; (B) a two-week diet with standard commercial pasta. Then, after a two-week washout period on gluten-free diet, each patient crossed over to the other treatment group. Symptoms were assessed through a modified version of the Gastrointestinal Symptom Rating Scale (GSRS), tailored on NCGS. Between April 2018 and July 2018, 42 patients with NCGS were enrolled in the study (70.6% females), and 34 patients completed the study. Patients reported lower overall symptoms scores after eating Senatore Cappelli pasta than standard pasta (p = 0.03) and also significantly lower scores in several specific gastrointestinal and extra-intestinal symptoms after eating Senatore Cappelli pasta than standard pasta, specifically, bloating (p = 0.04), abdominal distention (p = 0.004), eructation (p = 0.01), flatus (p = 0.02), feeling of incomplete evacuation (p = 0.001), dermatitis (p = 0.01), and limb numbness (p = 0.03). In our study, patients with NCGS experienced lower gastrointestinal and extra-intestinal symptom scores after eating the Senatore Cappelli wheat variety than a standard commercial wheat. Should our preliminary results be confirmed by further studies, new dietary alternatives may be available to patients with NCGS, with consequent health, economic, and social benefits."

Under high-power microwave irradiation, sub bonds of the protein were broken, causing disaggregation and unfolding of the secondary structure, namely a decrease in the intermolecular aggregate structure and increase in the random coil structure, making the protein bonds susceptible to papain in the enzymolysis. On the other hand, a response surface methodology (RSM) was launched to investigate the influence of the enzymolysis process variables on the DH (degree of hydrolysis). The statistical analysis revealed that the optimized conditions were a protein substrate concentration of 15 g/L, pH of 5.5, enzymolysis temperature of 57 °C, papain amount of 0.5 g/L, and enzymolysis time of 45 min, for which the predicted value of the DH was 35.64%.

In that respect, here, the influence of different path strategies of the tool in face milling is investigated, and subsequently, the best strategy is identified following systematic optimization. The surface roughness, material removal rate and cutting time are considered as key responses, whereas the cutting speed, feed rate and depth of cut were considered as inputs (quantitative factors) beside the tool path strategy (qualitative factor) for the material Al 2024 with a torus end mill. The experimental plan, i.e., 27 runs were determined by using the Taguchi design approach. In addition, the analysis of variance is conducted to statistically identify the effects of parameters. The optimal values of process parameters have been evaluated based on Taguchi-grey relational analysis, and the reliability of this analysis has been verified with the confirmation test. It was found that the tool path strategy has a significant influence on the end outcomes of face milling. As such, the surface topography respective to different cutter path strategies and the optimal cutting strategy is discussed in detail.",Multiplexed PCR-Free Detection of MicroRNAs in Single Cancer Cells Using a DNA-Barcoded Microtrough Array Chip.,https://www.ncbi.nlm.nih.gov/pubmed/30934734,Micromachines,2019 06 10,"MicroRNAs are a class of small RNA molecules that regulate the expression of mRNAs in a wide range of biological processes and are implicated in human health and disease such as cancers. How to measure microRNA profiles in single cells with high throughput is essential to the development of cell-based assays for interrogating microRNA-mediated intratumor heterogeneity and the design of new lab tests for diagnosis and monitoring of cancers. Here, we report on an in situ hybridization barcoding workflow implemented in a sub-nanoliter microtrough array chip for high-throughput and multiplexed microRNA detection at the single cell level. The microtroughs are used to encapsulate single cells that are fixed, permeabilized, and pre-incubated with microRNA detection probes, each of which consists of a capture strand complementary to specific microRNA and a unique reporter strand that can be photocleaved in the microtroughs and subsequently detected by an array of DNA barcodes patterned on the bottom of the microtroughs. In this way, the measurement of reporter strands released from single cells is a surrogate for detecting single-cell microRNA profiles. This approach permits direct measurement of microRNAs without PCR amplification owing to the small volume (<1 nL) of microtroughs. It offers high throughput and high multiplexing capability for evaluating microRNA heterogeneity in single cells, representing a new approach toward microRNA-based diagnosis and monitoring of complex human diseases.",Influence of Work on Elevated Blood Pressure in Hispanic Adolescents in South Texas.,https://www.ncbi.nlm.nih.gov/pubmed/30934733,International journal of environmental research and public health,2019 05 29,"Literature supports an association between work and cardiovascular disease in adults. The objective of this study was to examine the relationship between current work status and elevated blood pressure in Hispanic adolescents. Participants were students in Hidalgo County, located along the Texas-Mexico border. Participants enrolled in the cohort study in ninth grade with assessments completed once a year for up to three years. Participants completed a self-report survey, while staff measured height, weight, waist circumference, blood pressure, and were screened for acanthosis nigricans. A generalized linear regression model with a logit link function was constructed to assess current work status and elevated blood pressure. Of the 508 participants, 29% had elevated blood pressure, which was associated with being male and other chronic disease indicators (e.g., acanthosis nigricans, overweight/obesity). The mean probability for elevated blood pressure was higher among currently working adolescents compared to those who were not. Findings were statistically significant (p < 0.05) at baseline. The findings illustrate that a large proportion of adolescents along the Texas-Mexico border may have elevated blood pressure and that working may be associated with it. Subsequent research is needed to confirm these findings, as well as to identify the mechanism for how work may increase hypertension in adolescents.",Exosome-Mediated Delivery of Inducible miR-423-5p Enhances Resistance of MRC-5 Cells to Rabies Virus Infection.,https://www.ncbi.nlm.nih.gov/pubmed/30934732,International journal of molecular sciences,2019 04 30,"The human diploid cell line Medical Research Council -5 (MRC-5) is commonly utilized for vaccine development. Although a rabies vaccine developed in cultured MRC-5 cells exists, the poor susceptibility of MRC-5 cells to the rabies virus (RABV) infection limits the potential yield of this vaccine. The underlying mechanism of MRC-5 cell resistance to RABV infection remains unknown. In this study, we demonstrate that viral infection increased exosomal release from MRC-5 cells; conversely, blocking exosome release promoted RABV infection in MRC-5 cells. Additionally, RABV infection up-regulated microRNA (miR)-423-5p expression in exosomes, resulting in feedback inhibition of RABV replication by abrogating the inhibitory effect of suppressor of cytokine signaling 3 (SOCS3) on type I interferon (IFN) signaling. Furthermore, intercellular delivery of miR-423-5p by exosomes inhibited RABV replication in MRC-5 cells. We also show that RABV infection increased IFN-β production in MRC-5 cells and that blocking the type I IFN receptor promoted RABV infection. In conclusion, MRC-5 cells were protected from RABV infection by the intercellular delivery of exosomal miR-423-5p and the up-regulation of IFN-β. These findings reveal novel antiviral mechanisms in MRC-5 cells against RABV infection. miR-423-5p, exosomes, and IFN signaling pathways may therefore be potential targets for improving MRC-5 cell-based rabies vaccine production.",High Levels of Prebiotic Resistant Starch in Diet Modulate Gene Expression and Metabolomic Profile in Pancreatic Cancer Xenograft Mice.,https://www.ncbi.nlm.nih.gov/pubmed/30934731,Nutrients,2019 06 10,"Cancer initiation and protection mainly derives from a systemic metabolic environment regulated by dietary patterns. Less is known about the impact of nutritional interventions in people with a diagnosis of cancer. The aim of our study was to investigate the effect of a diet rich in resistant starch (RS) on cell pathways modulation and metabolomic phenotype in pancreatic cancer xenograft mice. RNA-Seq experiments on tumor tissue showed that 25 genes resulted in dysregulated pancreatic cancer in mice fed with an RS diet, as compared to those fed with control diet. Moreover, in these two different mice groups, six serum metabolites were deregulated as detected by LC⁻MS analysis. A bioinformatic prediction analysis showed the involvement of the differentially expressed genes on insulin receptor signaling, circadian rhythm signaling, and cancer drug resistance among the three top canonical pathways, whilst cell death and survival, gene expression, and neurological disease were among the three top disease and biological functions. These findings shed light on the genomic and metabolic phenotype, contributing to the knowledge of the mechanisms through which RS may act as a potential supportive approach for enhancing the efficacy of existing cancer treatments.",Structure-Based Design of Novel Benzimidazole Derivatives as Pin1 Inhibitors.,https://www.ncbi.nlm.nih.gov/pubmed/30934730,"Molecules (Basel, Switzerland)",2019 05 01,"Peptidyl-prolyl cis/trans isomerase Pin1 plays a key role in amplifying and translating multiple oncogenic signaling pathways during oncogenesis.

Among the derivatives, compounds 6h and 13g showed the most potent Pin1 inhibitory activity with IC50 values of 0.64 and 0.37 μM, respectively. In vitro antiproliferative assay demonstrated that compounds 6d, 6g, 6h, 6n, 6o and 7c exhibited moderate antiproliferative activity against human prostate cancer PC-3 cells.

Sep/SBR nanocomposites were used as a model to study the influence of the modified sepiolite filler on the formation of immobilized rubber at the clay-rubber interface and the role of a self-assembled nanostructure in tuning the mechanical properties. A detailed investigation at the macro and nanoscale of such self-assembled structures was performed in terms of the organization and networking of Sep fibers in the rubber matrix, the nature of both the filler⁻filler and filler⁻rubber interactions, and the impact of these features on the reduced dissipative phenomena. An integrated multi-technique approach, based on dynamic measurements, nuclear magnetic resonance analysis, and morphological investigation, assessed that the macroscopic mechanical properties of clay nanocomposites can be remarkably enhanced by self-assembled filler structures, whose formation can be favored by manipulating the chemistry at the hybrid interfaces between the clay particles and the polymers.",Minimum-Throughput Maximization for Multi-UAV-Enabled Wireless-Powered Communication Networks.,https://www.ncbi.nlm.nih.gov/pubmed/30934728,"Sensors (Basel, Switzerland)",2019 04 30,"This paper considers a wireless-powered communication network (WPCN) system that uses multiple unmanned aerial vehicles (UAVs).

Even though they have existed for some time, they are only recently classified as smart materials suitable for civil, mechanical, and aerospace (CMA) engineering. There are still not many commercialized metamaterial designs suitable for CMA sensing applications. On the other hand, piezoelectric materials are one of the popular smart materials in use for about 25 years. Both these materials are non-fiber-optical in nature and are robust to withstand the rugged CMA engineering environment, if proper designs are adopted. However, no single smart material or SHM technique can ever address the complexities of CMA structures and a combination of such sensors along with popular fiber optical sensors should be encouraged. Furthermore, the global demand for miniaturization of SHM equipment, automation and portability is also on the rise as indicated by several global marketing strategists. Recently, Technavio analysts, a well-known market research company estimated the global SHM market to grow from the current US $ 1.48 billion to US $ 3.38 billion by 2023, at a compound annual growth rate (CAGR) of 17.93%. The market for metamaterial is expected to grow rapidly at a CAGR of more than 22% and the market for piezoelectric materials is expected to accelerate at a CAGR of over 13%. At the same time, the global automation and robotics market in the automotive industry is expected to post a CAGR of close to 8%. The fusion of such smart materials along with automation can increase the overall market enormously. Thus, this invited review paper presents a positive perspective of these non-fiber-optic sensors, especially those made of metamaterial designs. Additionally, our recent work related to near field setup, a portable meta setup, and their functionalities along with a novel piezoelectric catchment sensor are discussed."

In particular, colon targeted drug formulations have raised the attention of pharmaceutical scientists because of the great potential of colonic drug delivery. However, the distal bowel is still a relatively understudied part of the gastrointestinal tract. Recently, magnetic resonance imaging (MRI) has been gaining an emerging role in studying the colon. This article provides a comprehensive; contemporary review of the literature on luminal MRI of the colonic environment of the last 15 years with specific focus on colon physiological dimensions; motility; chyme and fluids; transit and luminal flow. The work reviewed provides novel physiological insight that will have a profound impact on our understanding of the colonic environment for drug delivery and absorption and will ultimately help to raise the in vitro/in vivo relevance of computer simulations and bench models.","Antioxidant Activities, Phenolic Profiles, and Organic Acid Contents of Fruit Vinegars.",https://www.ncbi.nlm.nih.gov/pubmed/30934715,"Antioxidants (Basel, Switzerland)",2019 06 10,"Fruit vinegars are popular condiments worldwide. Antioxidants and organic acids are two important components of the flavors and health benefits of fruit vinegars. This study aimed to test the antioxidant activities, phenolic profiles, and organic acid contents of 23 fruit vinegars. The results found that the 23 fruit vinegars varied in ferric-reducing antioxidant power (FRAP, 0.15⁻23.52 μmol Fe(II)/mL), Trolox equivalent antioxidant capacity (TEAC, 0.03⁻7.30 μmol Trolox/mL), total phenolic content (TPC, 29.64⁻3216.60 mg gallic acid equivalent/L), and total flavonoid content (TFC, 2.22⁻753.19 mg quercetin equivalent/L) values. Among the 23 fruit vinegars, the highest antioxidant activities were found in balsamic vinegar from Modena (Galletti), Aceto Balsamico di Modena (Monari Federzoni), red wine vinegar (Kühne), and red wine vinegar (Galletti). In addition, polyphenols and organic acids might be responsible for the antioxidant activities of fruit vinegars. The most widely detected phenolic compounds in fruit vinegars were gallic acid, protocatechuic acid, chlorogenic acid, caffeic acid, and p-coumaric acid, with tartaric acid, malic acid, lactic acid, citric acid, and succinic acid the most widely distributed organic acids. Overall, fruit vinegars are rich in polyphenols and organic acids and can be a good dietary source of antioxidants.",Dealing with Ethical Concerns in Suicide Research: A Survey of Australian Researchers.,https://www.ncbi.nlm.nih.gov/pubmed/30934714,International journal of environmental research and public health,2019 05 29,"Given the increasing trend in suicide mortality and its burden on individuals, families and communities, ethically sound research is crucial to improve the prevention of suicidal behaviour. However, few studies have looked at the experiences of researchers in obtaining ethics approval for their studies. This study addressed this gap by investigating researchers' experiences in obtaining ethics approval and how they dealt with the concerns raised by ethics committees. Respondents were recruited from September to November 2018 through the Australian Suicide Prevention Research Leaders Network, and 33 respondents (35%) completed the study survey, comprising forced-choice and open-ended questions. Respondents most commonly reported concerns from ethics committees regarding potential harm to participants and researchers' responsibilities to participants within the context of intervention and evaluation studies. Most researchers modified their ethics application and/or consulted with their ethics committee to reply to the concerns raised. Most respondents perceived the impact of the modification as positive or neutral. The study concludes that researchers may anticipate potential concerns of ethics committees. Improved understanding of how ethics committees work and dialogue between researchers and ethics committees should sustain the quality in suicide-related research.",Precise Structure and Anticoagulant Activity of Fucosylated Glycosaminoglycan from Apostichopus japonicus: Analysis of Its Depolymerized Fragments.,https://www.ncbi.nlm.nih.gov/pubmed/30934713,Marine drugs,2019 06 10,"Apostichopus japonicus is one of the most economically important species in sea cucumber aquaculture in China. Fucosylated glycosaminoglycan from A. japonicus (AjFG) has shown multiple pharmacological activities. However, results from studies on the structure of AjFG are still controversial. In this study, the deaminative depolymerization method that is glycosidic bond-selective was used to prepare the depolymerized products from AjFG (dAjFG), and then a series of purified oligosaccharide fragments such as tri-, hexa-, nona-, and dodecasaccharides were obtained from dAjFG by gel permeation chromatography. The 1D/2D NMR and ESI-MS spectrometry analyses showed that these oligosaccharides had the structural formula of l-FucS-α1,3-d-GlcA-β1,3-{d-GalNAc4S6S-β1,4-[l-FucS-α1,3-]d-GlcA-β1,3-}

-d-anTal-diol4S6S (n = 0, 1, 2, 3; FucS represents Fuc2S4S, Fuc3S4S, or Fuc4S). Thus, the unambiguous structure of native AjFG can be rationally deduced: it had the backbone of {-4-d-GlcA-β1,3-d-GalNAc4S6S-β1-}
n
, which is similar to chondroitin sulfate E, and each d-GlcA residue in the backbone was branched with a l-FucS monosaccharide at O-3.

The method first involves performing tensile tests of axisymmetric samples and then simulating these tests numerically. Simulations are performed by the finite element method in a three-dimensional state of strain, including thermal phenomena occurring in the forming zone. The elaborated method is universal and can be used for different materials. The study is performed for two steel grades, i.e., R200 railway steel and 100Cr6 bearing steel.

It requires the contribution of both the nuclear and the mitochondrial genomes and therefore cross talk between the nucleus and mitochondria. Cellular energy demand can vary by great length and it is now well known that one way to adjust adenosine triphosphate (ATP) synthesis to energy demand is through modulation of mitochondrial content in eukaryotes. The knowledge of actors and signals regulating mitochondrial biogenesis is thus of high importance.

In our study, we examined the utility of the mucosal protrusion angle in differentiating between true submucosal masses and bulges of the small bowel on video capsule endoscopy. We retrospectively reviewed video capsule endoscopies of 34 patients who had suspected small-bowel lesions between 2002 and 2017. Mucosal protrusion angles were defined as the angle between the small-bowel protruding lesion and surrounding mucosa and were measured using a protractor placed on a computer screen. We found that 25 patients were found to have true submucosal masses based on pathology and 9 patients had innocent bulges due to extrinsic compression. True submucosal masses had an average measured protrusion angle of 45.7 degrees ± 20.8 whereas innocent bulges had an average protrusion angle of 108.6 degrees ± 16.3 (p < 0.0001; unpaired t-test). Acute angle of protrusion accurately discriminated between true submucosal masses and extrinsic compression bulges on Fisher's exact test (p = 0.0001). Our findings suggest that mucosal protrusion angle is a simple and useful tool for differentiating between true masses and innocent bulges of the small bowel.","Assessment of Cholesterol, Glycemia Control and Short- and Long-Term Antihypertensive Effects of Smooth Hound Viscera Peptides in High-Salt and Fructose Diet-Fed Wistar Rats.",https://www.ncbi.nlm.nih.gov/pubmed/30934709,Marine drugs,2019 06 10,"In this study, the antihypertensive activity of Purafect®-smooth hound viscera protein hydrolysate (VPH) and its peptide fraction with molecular weight (MW) below 1 kDa (VPH-I) was investigated. In addition, the lipase inhibitory activity, as well the anticoagulant potential, in vitro, were assessed. The antihypertensive effects of VPH and VPH-I were studied during 24 h (short-term effect) and 30 days (long-term effect) using high-salt (18% NaCl) and -fructose (10%) diet (HSFD)-induced hypertension. Data showed that, 4 h post-administration of VPH and VPH-I (200 mg/kg BW), the systolic blood pressure of rats was reduced by about 6 and 9 mmHg, respectively. These effects were similar to that obtained with Captopril (~9 mmHg at t = 4 h). On the other hand, exposing the rats to daily to HSFD, coupled to the administration of viscera peptides, was found to attenuate hypertension. In addition, the proteins' treatments were able to correct lipid and glycemic disorders, by reducing the total cholesterol and triglyceride contents and resorting to the plasma glucose level, compared to the HSFD group. Overall, the present findings demonstrated the preventive effect of VPH-peptides from hypertension complications, as a result of their biological properties.",The As and Bs of HIV and Hepatitis Co-Infection.,https://www.ncbi.nlm.nih.gov/pubmed/30934708,Tropical medicine and infectious disease,2019 04 02,"Hepatitis A and B co-infection among people living with HIV are public health challenges that account for an increasing degree of morbidity and mortality.

The simulation results suggest that the melting point in CoCrFeNiMn high-entropy alloy decreases with the grain size, decreasing from 3.6 to 2.0 nm. The grain size has a significant effect on shear and Young's modulus compared to bulk modulus. The stress-strain simulation demonstrates that the ultimate tensile strength decreases with the decrease of the grain size, while the plastic deformation increases with the decrease in grain size. While the average grain size decreases to 2.0 nm, the amorphization induced by small grain size reduces plastic deformation. The common neighbor analysis shows that the face-centered cubic (FCC) composition of CoCrFeNiMn decreases gradually with decreasing grain size. For the sample with a grain size of 2.0 nm, the FCC composition is about 19% at a strain of 20%, accompanied by severe amorphization. The inverse Hall-Petch effect is observed for nanocrystalline CoCrFeNiMn high-entropy alloy in the present simulations. The atomic snapshot of CoCrFeNiMn with a grain size of 2.0 nm under the uniaxial strain confirms that the grain shape change, stacking fault formation, and amorphization are important mechanisms of plastic deformation in nanocrystalline high-entropy CoCrFeNiMn."

BLH and the four fortified BLH products dose- and time-dependently had growth inhibition on the cells in both short- and long-time experiments. These samples at dose level of 25 mg/mL could stop cell-cycle progression at the G0/G1-phase, damage mitochondrial membrane, and induce cell apoptosis. In total, the fortified BLH products had higher activities in the cells than BLH alone. Moreover, higher Cu/Mn fortification level brought higher effects, and Mn was more effective than Cu to increase these effects. In the treated cells, the apoptosis-related proteins such as Bad, Bax, p53, cytochrome c, caspase-3, and caspase-9 were up-regulated, while Bcl-2 was down-regulated. Caspase-3 activation was also evidenced using a caspase-3 inhibitor, z-VAD-fmk. Thus, Cu- and especially Mn-fortification of BLH brought health benefits such as increased anti-cancer activity in the BGC-823 cells via activating the apoptosis-related proteins to induce cell apoptosis.",Deep Convolutional Neural Network for Flood Extent Mapping Using Unmanned Aerial Vehicles Data.,https://www.ncbi.nlm.nih.gov/pubmed/30934695,"Sensors (Basel, Switzerland)",2019 04 30,"Flooding is one of the leading threats of natural disasters to human life and property, especially in densely populated urban areas. Rapid and precise extraction of the flooded areas is key to supporting emergency-response planning and providing damage assessment in both spatial and temporal measurements. Unmanned Aerial Vehicles (UAV) technology has recently been recognized as an efficient photogrammetry data acquisition platform to quickly deliver high-resolution imagery because of its cost-effectiveness, ability to fly at lower altitudes, and ability to enter a hazardous area. Different image classification methods including SVM (Support Vector Machine) have been used for flood extent mapping. In recent years, there has been a significant improvement in remote sensing image classification using Convolutional Neural Networks (CNNs). CNNs have demonstrated excellent performance on various tasks including image classification, feature extraction, and segmentation. CNNs can learn features automatically from large datasets through the organization of multi-layers of neurons and have the ability to implement nonlinear decision functions. This study investigates the potential of CNN approaches to extract flooded areas from UAV imagery. A VGG-based fully convolutional network (FCN-16s) was used in this research. The model was fine-tuned and a k-fold cross-validation was applied to estimate the performance of the model on the new UAV imagery dataset. This approach allowed FCN-16s to be trained on the datasets that contained only one hundred training samples, and resulted in a highly accurate classification. Confusion matrix was calculated to estimate the accuracy of the proposed method. The image segmentation results obtained from FCN-16s were compared from the results obtained from FCN-8s, FCN-32s and SVMs. Experimental results showed that the FCNs could extract flooded areas precisely from UAV images compared to the traditional classifiers such as SVMs. The classification accuracy achieved by FCN-16s, FCN-8s, FCN-32s, and SVM for the water class was 97.52%, 97.8%, 94.20% and 89%, respectively.",New Aluminum Alloys Specifically Designed for Laser Powder Bed Fusion: A Review.,https://www.ncbi.nlm.nih.gov/pubmed/30934694,"Materials (Basel, Switzerland)",2019 04 30,"Aluminum alloys are key materials in additive manufacturing (AM) technologies thanks to their low density that, coupled with the possibility to create complex geometries of these innovative processes, can be exploited for several applications in aerospace and automotive fields.

This study aimed to comprehensively analyze the global scientific output of MCT1 research and explore the hotspots and frontiers from the past decade. Methods: Publications and their literature information from 2008 to 2018 were retrieved from the Web of Science Core Collection database. We used Microsoft Excel 2016 to detect the trend of annual numbers of publications, and used Citespace V software as the bibliometric method to analyze the research areas, countries, institutions, authors, journals, research hotspots, and research frontiers. Results: A total of 851 publications were identified with an increasing trend. Relevant literature mainly focused on the field of oncology. The most prolific country and institution were the USA and University of Minho, respectively. Baltazar was the most productive author while Halestrap had the highest co-citations. The hottest topics in MCT1 were hypoxia, gene expression, and CD147 over the last decade. The three research frontier topics were proliferation, tumor cell, and resistance. The special role of MCT1 in human tumor cells has become the focus for scholars recently.

The peroxidase activity is unusual, as it is capable of reducing phospholipid hydroperoxides (as well as hydrogen peroxide and short chain organic peroxides). Knockout and overexpressing mice have been produced that demonstrate the effect that eliminating or overproducing Prdx6 has on the animals' physiology. In addition, mutations in various amino acids of Prdx6 have been identified that interfere with different enzymatic functions as well as protein transport. These mutations were originally characterized biochemically; subsequently, several knock-in mouse strains have been produced, each containing one mutation. These mice include the S32T knock-in that affects protein transport, the C47S knock-in that inactivates the peroxidase enzymatic activity, the D140A knock-in that inactivates the PLA₂ enzymatic activity and the H26A knock-in that inactivates the peroxidase and blocks binding to phospholipids.

We conducted an in-depth investigation of the mechanisms that give rise to fluctuations in the electrical signal, affecting the stability and sensitivity of the miRNA sensor. Firstly, surface characteristics were studied by examining the metal electrodes deposited using different metal deposition techniques. The lower surface roughness of the gold electrode improved the electrical current stability. The temperature and viscosity of the sample solution were proven to affect the electrical stability, which was attributed to reducing the effect of Brownian motion. Therefore, by controlling the test conditions, such as temperature and sample viscosity, and the surface characteristics of the metal electrodes, we can enhance the stability of the sensor. Metal electrodes deposited via sputtering and e-beam evaporator yielded the lowest signal fluctuation. When ambient temperature was reduced to 3 °C, the sensor had better noise characteristics compared to room temperature testing. Higher viscosity of samples resulted in lower signal fluctuations. Lastly, surface functionalization was demonstrated to be a critical factor in enhancing the stability and sensitivity. MiRNA sensors with higher surface ratios of immobilized DNA probes performed with higher sensitivity and stability. This study reveals methods to improve the characteristics of EDL FET biosensors to facilitate practical implementation in clinical applications.","Cell Type-Specific p38δ Targeting Reveals a Context-, Stage-, and Sex-Dependent Regulation of Skin Carcinogenesis.",https://www.ncbi.nlm.nih.gov/pubmed/30934690,International journal of molecular sciences,2019 04 30,"Activation and/or upregulated expression of p38δ are demonstrated in human skin malignancies including cutaneous squamous cell carcinoma, suggesting a role for p38δ in skin carcinogenesis. We previously reported that mice with germline deletion of the p38δ gene are significantly protected from chemical skin carcinogenesis. Here, we investigated the effects of cell-selective targeted ablation of p38δ in keratinocytes and in immune (myeloid) cells on skin tumor development in a two-stage 7,12-dimethylbenz(a)anthracene (DMBA)/12-O-tetradecanoylphorbol-13-acetate (TPA) chemical mouse skin carcinogenesis model. Conditional keratinocyte-specific p38δ ablation (p38δ-cKO∆K) did not influence the latency, incidence, or multiplicity of chemically-induced skin tumors, but led to increased tumor volume in females during the TPA promotion stage, and reduced malignant progression in males and females relative to their wild-type counterparts. In contrast, conditional myeloid cell-specific p38δ deletion (p38δ-cKO∆M) inhibited DMBA/TPA-induced skin tumorigenesis in male but not female mice. Thus, tumor onset was delayed, and tumor incidence, multiplicity, and volume were reduced in p38δ-cKO∆M males compared with control wild-type males. Moreover, the percentage of male mice with malignant tumors was decreased in the p38δ-cKO∆M group relative to their wild-type counterparts. Collectively, these results reveal that cell-specific p38δ targeting modifies susceptibility to chemical skin carcinogenesis in a context-, stage-, and sex-specific manner.",Cisplatin-Loaded Polybutylcyanoacrylate Nanoparticles with Improved Properties as an Anticancer Agent.,https://www.ncbi.nlm.nih.gov/pubmed/30934689,International journal of molecular sciences,2019 04 30,"This study aims to improve the cytotoxicity and potency of cisplatin-loaded polybutylcyanoacrylate (PBCA) nanoparticles (NPs) for the treatment of lung cancer through the modulation of temperature and polyethylene glycol (PEG) concentration as effective factors affecting the NPs' properties. The NPs were synthesized using an anionic polymerization method and were characterized in terms of size, drug loading efficiency, drug release profile, cytotoxicity effects, drug efficacy, and drug side effects. In this regard, dynamic light scattering (DLS), scanning electron microscopy (SEM), 3-(4,5-dimethylthiazol-2-yl)-2,5-diphenyl tetrazolium bromide (MTT) methods, and hematoxylin and eosin (H&amp;E) staining were used. The results showed that the size and the drug loading efficiency of the synthesized spherical NPs were 355–386 nm and 14–19%, respectively. Also, the drug release profile showed a controlled and slow drug release pattern with approximately 10% drug release over 48 h. In addition, the NPs significantly increased the cytotoxicity of the cisplatin in vitro environment by approximately 2 times and enhanced the therapeutic effects of the drug in vivo environment by increasing the survival time of lung-cancer-bearing mice by 20% compared to the standard drug receiver group. Also, the nanoformulation decreased the drug toxicity in an in vivo environment. According to the results, increasing the temperature and PEG concentration improved the properties of the drug loading efficiency, drug release profile, and cytotoxicity effect of drug-loaded NPs. Consequently, the synthesized formulation increased the survival of tumor-bearing mice and simultaneously decreased the cisplatin toxicity effects. In conclusion, the prepared nanoformulation can be considered a promising candidate for further evaluation for possible therapeutic use in the treatment of lung cancer.",Surface Modification of Ti-6Al-4V Alloy by Electrical Discharge Coating Process Using Partially Sintered Ti-Nb Electrode.,https://www.ncbi.nlm.nih.gov/pubmed/30934688,"Materials (Basel, Switzerland)",2019 04 30,"In the present research, a composite layer of TiO₂-TiC-NbO-NbC was coated on the Ti-64 alloy using two different methods (i.e., the electric discharge coating (EDC) and electric discharge machining processes) while the Nb powder were mixed in dielectric fluid. The effect produced on the machined surfaces by both processes was reported. The influence of Nb-concentration along with the EDC key parameters (Ip and Ton) on the coated surface integrity such as surface topography, micro-cracks, coating layer thickness, coating deposition, micro-hardness has been evaluated as well. It has been noticed that in the EDC process the high peak current and high Nb-powder concentration allow improvement in the material migration, and a crack-free thick layer (215 μm) on the workpiece surface is deposited. The presence of various oxides and carbides on the coated surface further enhanced the mechanical properties, especially, the wear resistance, corrosion resistance and bioactivity. The surface hardness of the coated layer is increased from 365 HV to 1465 HV. Furthermore, the coated layer reveals a higher adhesion strength (~118 N), which permits to enhance the wear resistance of the Ti-64 alloy. This proposed technology allows modification of the mechanical properties and surface characteristics according to an orthopedic implant's requirements.",Effect of Different Drying Methods on Nutrient Quality of the Yellow Mealworm (Tenebrio molitor L.).,https://www.ncbi.nlm.nih.gov/pubmed/30934687,Insects,2019 06 10,"Yellow mealworm (Tenebrio molitor L.) represents a sustainable source of proteins and fatty acids for feed and food. Industrial production of mealworms necessitates optimized processing techniques, where drying as the first postharvest procedure is of utmost importance for the quality of the final product. This study examines the nutritional quality of mealworm larvae processed by rack oven drying, vacuum drying or freeze drying, respectively. Proximate composition and fatty acid profile were comparable between the dried larvae. In contrast, larvae color impressions and volatile compound profiles were very much dependent on processing procedure. High-temperature rack oven drying caused pronounced darkening with rather low content of volatiles, pointing toward the progress of Maillard reaction. On the other hand, vacuum drying or freeze drying led to enrichment of volatile Maillard reaction and lipid oxidation intermediates, whose actual sensory relevance needs to be clarified in the future. Beyond sensory and visual importance drying intermediates have to be considered with regard to their metal ion chelating ability; in particular for essential trace elements such as Zn2+. This study found comparable total zinc contents for the differently dried mealworm samples. However, dried larvae, in particular after rack oven drying, had only low zinc accessibility, which was between 20% and 40%. Therefore, bioaccessibility rather than total zinc has to be considered when their contribution to meeting the nutritional requirements for zinc in humans and animals is evaluated."

It is of importance to consider overall effects as well as specific impact on vulnerable population groups such as outdoor workers. The agricultural and construction sectors represent two strategic occupational fields that in relatively recent years involve an increasing number of migrant workers, and therefore require a better management of cultural aspects, that may interact with and impact on heat-related health risk. For this reason, the present study evaluated heat-stress perception and management among native and immigrant workers in Europe. As part of the EU's Horizon 2020 HEAT-SHIELD project (grant agreement No. 668786), two agricultural and one construction companies, traditionally employing migrant workers, were evaluated with a questionnaire survey during the summer months of 2017. The data collected (104 case studies) were analyzed using descriptive statistics (Chi-squared tests) and the analysis of variance was performed with ANOVA test. From the results, migrant workers declared that work required greater effort than do native Italian workers (χ² = 17.1, p = 0.001) but reported less impact from heat on productivity (χ² = 10.6; p = 0.014) and thermal discomfort. In addition, migrant workers were mainly informed through written or oral communications, while native workers received information on heat-health issues through training courses. These findings are of importance for future information and mitigation actions to address socio-cultural gaps and reduce heat-stress vulnerability.",Novel Benzene-Based Carbamates for AChE/BChE Inhibition: Synthesis and Ligand/Structure-Oriented SAR Study.,https://www.ncbi.nlm.nih.gov/pubmed/30934674,International journal of molecular sciences,2019 04 30,"A series of new benzene-based derivatives was designed, synthesized and comprehensively characterized. All of the tested compounds were evaluated for their in vitro ability to potentially inhibit the acetyl- and butyrylcholinesterase enzymes. The selectivity index of individual molecules to cholinesterases was also determined. Generally, the inhibitory potency was stronger against butyryl- compared to acetylcholinesterase; however, some of the compounds showed a promising inhibition of both enzymes. In fact, two compounds (23, benzyl ethyl(1-oxo-1-phenylpropan-2-yl)carbamate and 28, benzyl (1-(3-chlorophenyl)-1-oxopropan-2-yl) (methyl)carbamate) had a very high selectivity index, while the second one (28) reached the lowest inhibitory concentration IC50 value, which corresponds quite well with galanthamine. Moreover, comparative receptor-independent and receptor-dependent structure⁻activity studies were conducted to explain the observed variations in inhibiting the potential of the investigated carbamate series. The principal objective of the ligand-based study was to comparatively analyze the molecular surface to gain insight into the electronic and/or steric factors that govern the ability to inhibit enzyme activities. The spatial distribution of potentially important steric and electrostatic factors was determined using the probability-guided pharmacophore mapping procedure, which is based on the iterative variable elimination method. Additionally, planar and spatial maps of the host⁻target interactions were created for all of the active compounds and compared with the drug molecules using the docking methodology.",Raising Children with Poor School Performance: Parenting Styles and Short- and Long-Term Consequences for Adolescent and Adult Development.,https://www.ncbi.nlm.nih.gov/pubmed/30934673,International journal of environmental research and public health,2019 05 29,"This study examines the correlates of authoritative (warmth and strictness), indulgent (warmth but not strictness), authoritarian (strictness but not warmth), and neglectful (neither warmth nor strictness) parenting with short- and long-term socialization outcomes in adolescents and adults, with and without poor school performance during adolescence. Short- and long-term socialization outcomes were captured by multidimensional self-esteem (academic/professional, emotional, and family), psychological maturity (self-competence, social competence, and empathy), and emotional maladjustment (nervousness, emotional instability, and hostility). Participants (1195 female and 874 male) consisted of a community sample of adolescents (n = 602), young adults (n = 610), middle-aged adults (n = 469) and older adults (n = 388). Design was a 4 × 3 × 2 × 4 MANOVA (parenting style × school performance × sex × age). Results indicated that the relationship between parenting styles and children's socialization outcomes does not vary as a function of school performance. The link between parenting styles and socialization outcomes shares a common short- and long- term pattern in adolescents and adults: Indulgent parenting was related to equal or even better socialization outcomes than authoritative parenting, whereas authoritarian and neglectful styles were associated with the worst socialization outcomes.",Automated Accelerometer-Based Gait Event Detection During Multiple Running Conditions.,https://www.ncbi.nlm.nih.gov/pubmed/30934672,"Sensors (Basel, Switzerland)",2019 04 30,"The identification of the initial contact (IC) and toe off (TO) events are crucial components of running gait analyses. To evaluate running gait in real-world settings, robust gait event detection algorithms that are based on signals from wearable sensors are needed. In this study, algorithms for identifying gait events were developed for accelerometers that were placed on the foot and low back and validated against a gold standard force plate gait event detection method. These algorithms were automated to enable the processing of large quantities of data by accommodating variability in running patterns. An evaluation of the accuracy of the algorithms was done by comparing the magnitude and variability of the difference between the back and foot methods in different running conditions, including different speeds, foot strike patterns, and outdoor running surfaces. The results show the magnitude and variability of the back-foot difference was consistent across running conditions, suggesting that the gait event detection algorithms can be used in a variety of settings. As wearable technology allows for running gait analyses to move outside of the laboratory, the use of automated accelerometer-based gait event detection methods may be helpful in the real-time evaluation of running patterns in real world conditions.",MicroRNA Let-7d-3p Contributes to Cardiac Protection via Targeting HMGA2.,https://www.ncbi.nlm.nih.gov/pubmed/30934671,International journal of molecular sciences,2019 04 30,"We tested the hypothesis that Let-7d-3p contributes to cardiac cell protection during hypoxic challenge. Myoblast H9c2 cells and primary neonatal rat ventricular cardiomyocytes (NRVM) were transfected with five selected miRNA mimics. Both cell lines were subjected to 0.2% oxygen hypoxia. The protective effects of these miRNAs were determined by assessment of cell metabolic activity by CCK8 assay and measurement of lactate dehydrogenase (LDH) release as a marker of cell injury. Apoptosis and autophagy flux were assessed by Annexin V/7-AAD double staining and the ratio of LC3 II/I with Baf-A1 treatment, an autophagy flux inhibitor, respectively. Luciferase-reporter assay, RT-qPCR and Western blots were performed to identify the changes of relevant gene targets. Among five miRNA mimic transfections, Let-7d-3p increased CCK8 activity, and decreased LDH release in both H9c2 and NRVM during hypoxia. Apoptosis was significantly reduced in H9c2 cells transfected with Let-7d-3p mimic. Autophagy and autophagy flux were not affected. In silico, mRNAs of HMGA2, YY1, KLF9, KLF12, and MEX3C are predicted targets for Let-7d-3p. Luciferase-reporter assay confirmed that Let-7d-3p bound directly to the 3'-UTR region of HMGA2, MEX3C, and YY1, the down-regulations of these mRNAs were verified in both H9c2 and NRVM. The protein expression of HMGA2, but not others, was downregulated in H9c2 and NRVM. It is known that HMGA2 is a strong apoptosis trigger through the blocking of DNA repair. Thus, we speculate that the anti-apoptotic effects of Let-7d-3p mimic during hypoxia challenge are due to direct targeting of HMGA2.",Resveratrol and Its Effects on the Vascular System.,https://www.ncbi.nlm.nih.gov/pubmed/30934670,International journal of molecular sciences,2019 04 30,"Resveratrol, the phenolic substance isolated initially from Veratrum grandiflorum and richly present in grapes, wine, peanuts, soy, and berries, has been attracting attention of scientists and medical doctors for many decades. Herein, we review its effects on the vascular system. Studies utilizing cell cultures and pre-clinical models showed that resveratrol alleviates oxidative stress and inflammation. Furthermore, resveratrol suppresses vascular smooth muscle cell proliferation, promotes autophagy, and has been investigated in the context of vascular senescence. Pre-clinical models unambiguously demonstrated numerous vasculoprotective effects of resveratrol. In clinical trials, resveratrol moderately diminished systolic blood pressure in hypertensive patients, as well as blood glucose in patients with diabetes mellitus. Yet, open questions remain, as exemplified by a recent report which states that the intake of resveratrol might blunt certain positive effects of exercise in older persons, and further research addressing the framework for long-term use of resveratrol as a food supplement, will stay in demand.","Comment on Gjestland, T.

However, electromagnetic coupling among neighbored optical elements decreases the diffractive efficiency and increases the noise. In this paper, a novel computational method is proposed to optimize the coupling of the metasurface. The coupled electric fields in metasurface design are decomposed into various coupling orders and then restructured to replace the whole metasurface simulation. This method is applied to optimize a metasurface that consisted of conventional nanorod plasmonic antennas as a case study. The convergence of this method in calculation is demonstrated. The electric field intensity deviation of a nanoantenna array can be reduced from 112.2% to 0.5% by the second-order coupling correction. The diffractive efficiency of a three-level phase meta-deflector is optimized from 73% to 86% by optimized coupling compensation via particle swarm optimization (PSO). This process opens a new area of metasurface design by the detailed field distribution of optical elements.",Effects of Motilin Receptor Agonists and Ghrelin in Human motilin receptor Transgenic Mice.,https://www.ncbi.nlm.nih.gov/pubmed/30934667,International journal of molecular sciences,2019 04 30,"Gastrointestinal motility is regulated by neural factors and humoral factors. Both motilin and ghrelin improve gastrointestinal motility, but many issues remain unclear. We prepared human motilin receptor transgenic (Tg) mice and performed experiments evaluating the effects of motilin, erythromycin (EM), and ghrelin. EM and ghrelin promoted gastric emptying (GE) when administered either peripherally or centrally to Tg mice. Atropine (a muscarinic receptor antagonist) counteracted GE induced by centrally administered EM, but not that induced by peripherally administered EM. The administration of EM in this model promoted the effect of mosapride (a selective serotonin 5-hydroxytryptamine 4 (5-HT4) receptor agonist), and improved loperamide (a μ-opioid receptor agonist)-induced gastroparesis. The level of acyl-ghrelin was significantly attenuated by EM administration. Thus, we have established an animal model appropriate for the evaluation of motilin receptor agonists. These data and the model are expected to facilitate the identification of novel compounds with clinical potential for relieving symptoms of dyspepsia and gastroparesis.",Asymmetric Transmission in a Mie-Based Dielectric Metamaterial with Fano Resonance.,https://www.ncbi.nlm.nih.gov/pubmed/30934666,"Materials (Basel, Switzerland)",2019 04 30,"Chiral metamaterials with asymmetric transmission can be applied as polarization-controlled devices. Here, a Mie-based dielectric metamaterial with a spacer exhibiting asymmetric transmission of linearly polarized waves at microwave frequencies was designed and demonstrated numerically. The unidirectional characteristic is attributed to the chirality of the metamolecule and the mutual excitation of the Mie resonances. Field distributions are simulated to investigate the underlying physical mechanism. Fano-type resonances emerge near the Mie resonances of the constituents and come from the destructive interference inside the structure. The near-field coupling further contributes to the asymmetric transmission. The influences of the lattice constant and the spacer thickness on the asymmetric characteristics were also analyzed by parameter sweeps. The proposed Mie-based metamaterial is of a simple structure, and it has the potential for applications in dielectric metadevices, such as high-performance polarization rotators."

This study explores whether modifications in body composition predicted changes in running speed. We included people who underwent several measurements of body composition by bioelectrical impedance analysis between 1999 and 2016, at the ""Course de l'Escalade"", taking place yearly in Geneva. Body composition was reported as a fat-free mass index (FFMI) and fat mass index (FMI). Running distances (men: 7.2 km; women: 4.8 km) and running times were used to calculate speed in km/h. We performed multivariate linear mixed regression models to determine whether modifications of body mass index, FFMI, FMI or the combination of FFMI and FMI predicted changes in running speed. The study population included 377 women (1419 observations) and 509 men (2161 observations). Changes in running speed were best predicted by the combination of FFMI and FMI. Running speed improved with a reduction of FMI in both sexes (women: ß -0.31; 95% CI -0.35 to -0.27, p < 0.001. men: ß -0.43; 95% CI -0.48 to -0.39, p < 0.001) and a reduction of FFMI in men (ß -0.20; 95% CI -0.26 to -0.15, p < 0.001). Adjusted for body composition, the decline in running performance occurred from 50 years onward, but appeared earlier with a body mass, FFMI or FMI above the median value at baseline. Changes of running speed are determined mostly by changes in FMI. The decline in running performance occurs from 50 years onward but appears earlier in people with a high body mass index, FFMI or FMI at baseline.",A Novel Modified Electrode for Detection of the Food Colorant Sunset Yellow Based on Nanohybrid of MnO₂ Nanorods-Decorated Electrochemically Reduced Graphene Oxide.,https://www.ncbi.nlm.nih.gov/pubmed/30934654,"Molecules (Basel, Switzerland)",2019 04 28,"The nanohybrid of electrochemically-reduced graphene oxide (ERGO) nanosheets decorated with MnO₂ nanorods (MnO₂ NRs) was modified on the surface of a glassy carbon electrode (GCE). Controlled potential reduction was applied for the reduction of graphene oxide (GO). The characterization was performed by scanning electron microscopy, X-ray diffraction and cyclic voltammetry. Compared with the poor electrochemical response at bare GCE, a well-defined oxidation peak of sunset yellow (SY) was observed at the MnO₂ NRs-ERGO/GCE, which was attributed to the high accumulation efficiency as well as considerable electrocatalytic activity of ERGO and MnO₂ NRs on the electrode surface. The experimental parameters for SY detection were optimized in detail. Under the optimized experiment conditions, the MnO₂ NRs-ERGO/GCE showed good linear response to SY in concentration range of 0.01⁻2.0 μM, 2.0⁻10.0 μM and 10.0⁻100.0 μM with a detection limit of 2.0 nM.

Chitin has an important role for embryogenesis in adult worms and is a component of microfilaria sheath. Human chitotriosidase (CHIT1) is a chitin-degrading enzyme which provides a protective role against chitin-containing pathogens. Here, we determined the association of CHIT1 polymorphisms with susceptibility to bancroftian filariasis (BF) in 88 individuals at the Thai⁻Myanmar border. Two common polymorphisms of CHIT1, contributing inactive CHIT protein, including 24 base pair (24 bp) duplication in exon 10, and p.

Unexpectedly, genotype frequencies of 24 bp duplication insertion homozygous (INS/INS) were significantly higher in endemic normal (EN) (40.0%) than BF patients (31.4%). In contrast, genotype frequencies of p. G102S homozygous (A/A) in BF patients (21.6%) was higher than in EN (19.0%) without statistical difference. Mutant allele frequencies of 24 bp duplication were 0.6125 (98/160) and p. G102S were 0.392 (69/176). Genotype and allele frequencies of CHIT1, 24 bp duplication, and p.

In recent times, using laser cutting to develop printed flexible sensors has become a popular technique due to advantages such as the low cost of production, easy sample preparation, the ability to process a range of raw materials, and its usability for different functionalities. Different kinds of laser cutters are now available that work on samples very precisely via the available laser parameters. Thus, laser-cutting techniques provide huge scope for the development of prototypes with a varied range of sizes and dimensions. Meanwhile, researchers have been constantly working on the types of materials that can be processed, individually or in conjugation with one another, to form samples for laser-ablation. Some of the laser-printed techniques that are commonly considered for fabricating flexible sensors, which are discussed in this paper, include nanocomposite-based, laser-ablated, and 3D-printing. The developed sensors have been used for a range of applications, such as electrochemical and strain-sensing purposes.

The European Union General Data Protection Regulation (EU GDPR) works in this context; it was passed in April 2016 and came into force in May 2018 across the European Union. This study is the first attempt to test the effectiveness of this legal reform for personal health data protection. Using the difference-in-difference (DID) approach, this study empirically examines the policy influence of the GDPR on the financial performance of hospitals across the European Union. Results show that hospitals with the digital health service suffered from financial distress after the GDPR was published in 2016. This reveals that during the transition period (2016⁻2018), hospitals across the European Union indeed made costly adjustments to meet the requirements of personal health data protection introduced by this new regulation, and thus inevitably suffered a policy shock to their financial performance in the short term. The implementation of GDPR may have achieved preliminary success.",Statistical Evaluation of Radiofrequency Exposure during Magnetic Resonant Imaging: Application of Whole-Body Individual Human Model and Body Motion in the Coil.,https://www.ncbi.nlm.nih.gov/pubmed/30934647,International journal of environmental research and public health,2019 05 06,"The accurate estimation of patient's exposure to the radiofrequency (RF) electromagnetic field of magnetic resonance imaging (MRI) significantly depends on a precise individual anatomical model. In the study, we investigated the applicability of an efficient whole-body individual modelling method for the assessment of MRI RF exposure. The individual modelling method included a deformable human model and tissue simplification techniques. Besides its remarkable efficiency, this approach utilized only a low specific absorption rate (SAR) sequence or even no MRI scan to generate the whole-body individual model. Therefore, it substantially reduced the risk of RF exposure. The dosimetric difference of the individual modelling method was evaluated using the manually segmented human models. In addition, stochastic dosimetry using a surrogate model by polynomial chaos presented SAR variability due to body misalignment and tilt in the coil, which were frequently occurred in the practical scan. In conclusion, the dosimetric equivalence of the individual models was validated by both deterministic and stochastic dosimetry. The proposed individual modelling method allowed the physicians to quantify the patient-specific SAR while the statistical results enabled them to comprehensively weigh over the exposure risk and get the benefit of imaging enhancement by using the high-intensity scanners or the high-SAR sequences.",Impact of Gender and Age on Rapid Eye Movement-Related Obstructive Sleep Apnea: A Clinical Study of 3234 Japanese OSA Patients.,https://www.ncbi.nlm.nih.gov/pubmed/30934646,International journal of environmental research and public health,2019 05 06,"Rapid eye movement (REM)-related obstructive sleep apnea (OSA) is characterized by apnea and hypopnea events due to airway collapse occurring predominantly or exclusively during REM sleep.

The objective of this study was to evaluate the effect of gender and age on REM-related OSA after adjustment for several covariates based on their established clinical relationships to gender difference in OSA. A total of 3234 Japanese patients with OSA were enrolled in this study. We confirmed that female sex is an important risk factor for REM-related OSA, as reported by previous studies. Moreover, we showed that women aged over 50 years were at a greater risk than those aged under 50 years. These results suggest that hormonal changes in women might play an important role in REM-related OSA and might reflect its unknown pathophysiological characteristics.",A Review of the Construction of Nano-Hybrids for Electrochemical Biosensing of Glucose.,https://www.ncbi.nlm.nih.gov/pubmed/30934645,Biosensors,2019 04 24,"Continuous progress in the domain of nano and material science has led to modulation of the properties of nanomaterials in a controlled and desired fashion.

Soybean protein isolates were first hydrolyzed by Prozyme and subsequently fermented with Lactobacillus rhamnosus EBD1. After fermentation, the in vitro angiotensin-converting enzyme (ACE) inhibitory activity of the product (P-SPI) increased from 60.8 ± 2.0% to 88.24 ± 3.2%, while captopril (a positive control) had an inhibitory activity of 94.20 ± 5.4%. Mass spectrometry revealed the presence of three potent and abundant ACE inhibitory peptides, PPNNNPASPSFSSSS, GPKALPII, and IIRCTGC in P-SPI. Hydrolyzing P-SPI with gastrointestinal proteases did not significantly affect its ACE inhibitory ability. Also, oral administration of P-SPI (200 mg/kg body weight) to spontaneous hypertensive rats (SHRs) for 6 weeks significantly lowered systolic blood pressure (-19 ± 4 mm Hg, p < 0.05) and controlled body weight gain relative to control SHRs that were fed with physiological saline. Overall, P-SPI could be used as an antihypertensive functional food.",Alarming and/or Alerting Device Effectiveness in Reducing Falls in Long-Term Care (LTC) Facilities? A Systematic Review.,https://www.ncbi.nlm.nih.gov/pubmed/30934633,"Healthcare (Basel, Switzerland)",2019 05 03,"Perceptions against the use of alarming devices persist in long-term care environments as they are seen as annoying, costly, and a waste of time to the staff involved. Ascertaining whether these perceptions are true or false via the literature was a focus of this study. Proper information to educate staff and to work past these perceptions can be a positive effector for resident safety. Many facilitators for the use of alarming devices were found, as well as many barriers to their use as well. New technology is changing the perceptions regarding these types of devices as time passes. Education is a key component for staff, residents, and families. There are ""traditional"" issues with the use of alarms such as alarm fatigue by caregivers, high costs of implementation, and issues with proper implementation of alarms. Alarms are perceived as intrusive and the noise from them can be a potential cause of falls. However, alarming devices can be a key intervention in the safety of those residents who are prone to falls. This requires proper implementation and education for all parties involved, and proper oversight surrounding use of the devices.",The 'Ins and Outs' of Early Preclinical Models for Brain Tumor Research: Are They Valuable and Have We Been Doing It Wrong?,https://www.ncbi.nlm.nih.gov/pubmed/30934632,Cancers,2019 04 26,"In this perspective, we congratulate the international efforts to highlight critical challenges in brain tumor research through a recent Consensus Statement. We also illustrate the importance of developing more accurate and clinically relevant early translational in vitro brain tumor models-a perspective given limited emphasis in the Consensus Statement, despite in vitro models being widely used to prioritize candidate therapeutic strategies prior to in vivo studies and subsequent clinical trials. We argue that successful translation of effective novel treatments into the clinic will require investment into the development of more predictive early pre-clinical models. It is in the interest of researchers, clinicians, and ultimately, patients that the most promising therapeutic candidates are identified and translated toward use in the clinic. Highlighting the value of early pre-clinical brain tumor models and debating how such models can be improved is of the utmost importance to the neuro-oncology research community and cancer research more broadly.",Neuroprotective Effects of an Aqueous Extract of Forsythia viridissima and Its Major Constituents on Oxaliplatin-Induced Peripheral Neuropathy.,https://www.ncbi.nlm.nih.gov/pubmed/30934631,"Molecules (Basel, Switzerland)",2019 04 28,"The dried fruits of Forsythia viridissima have been prescribed to relive fever, pain, vomiting, and nausea in traditional medicine. Oxaliplatin (LOHP) is used to treat advanced colorectal cancer; however, it frequently induces peripheral neuropathies. This study was done to evaluate the neuroprotective effects of an aqueous extract of Forsythia viridissima fruits (EFVF) and its major constituents. Chemical constituents from EFVF were characterized and quantified with the UHPLC-diode array detector method, and three major constituents were identified as arctiin, matairesinol, and arctigenin. The in vitro cytotoxicity was measured by the Ez-cytox viability assay, and the in vivo neuroprotection activity was evaluated by a von Frey test in two rodent animal models that were administered LOHP. EFVF significantly alleviated the LOHP-induced mechanical hypersensitivity in the induction model. EFVF also prevented the induction of mechanical hyperalgesia by LOHP in the pre- and co-treatment of LOHP and EFVF. Consistently, EFVF exerted protective effects against LOHP-induced neurotoxicity as well as inhibited neurite outgrowths in PC12 and dorsal root ganglion cells. Among the major components of EFVF, arctigenin and matairesinol exerted protective effects against LOHP-induced neurotoxicity. Therefore, EFVF may be useful for relieving or preventing LOHP-induced peripheral neuropathy in cancer patients undergoing chemotherapy with LOHP.",Neurocognitive Function and Quality of Life Outcomes in the ONTRAC Study for Skin Cancer Chemoprevention by Nicotinamide.,https://www.ncbi.nlm.nih.gov/pubmed/30934630,"Geriatrics (Basel, Switzerland)",2019 05 03,"Nicotinamide (vitamin B3) has photoprotective effects and reduces skin cancer incidence in high risk patients. Nicotinamide also improves cognition in animal models. As part of the ONTRAC (Oral Nicotinamide To Reduce Actinic Cancer) phase III placebo-controlled, randomized trial to assess nicotinamide's efficacy in skin cancer prevention, we included clinical neurocognitive function and patient-reported quality of life assessments at baseline and after 12 months of intervention in individuals with previous skin cancer in order to assess any effect of oral nicotinamide (500 mg po twice daily) on cognitive function and quality of life. In our sample of 310 participants who completed neurocognitive function testing at baseline and at 12 months, we were not able to detect any significant effect of oral nicotinamide on cognitive function nor on quality of life. Further studies of nicotinamide's effects on cognition in humans might include individuals with pre-existing mild cognitive impairment, and it may be that higher doses of nicotinamide are required to significantly influence cognitive function compared to doses required to reduce skin cancer.",Guide Star Selection for the Three-FOV Daytime Star Sensor.,https://www.ncbi.nlm.nih.gov/pubmed/30934629,"Sensors (Basel, Switzerland)",2019 04 28,"To realize the application of the star sensor in the all-day carrier platform, a three-field-of-view (three-FOV) star sensor in short-wave infrared (SWIR) band is considered. This new prototype employs new techniques that can improve the detection capability of the star sensor, when the huge size of star identification feature database becomes a big obstacle. Hence, a way to thin the guide star catalog for three-FOV daytime star sensor is studied. Firstly, an introduction of three-FOV star sensor and an example of three-FOV daytime star sensor with narrow FOV are presented. According to this model and the requirement of triangular star identification method, two constraints based on the number and the brightness of the stars in FOV are put forward for guide star selection. Then on the basis of these constraints, the improved spherical spiral method (ISSM) is proposed and the optimal number of reference points of ISSM is discussed. Finally, to demonstrate the performance of the ISSM, guide star catalogs are generated by ISSM, magnitude filter method (MFM), 1st order self-organizing guide star selection method (1st-SOPM) and the spherical spiral method (SSM), respectively. The results show that the guide star catalog generated by ISSM has the smallest size and the number and brightness characteristics of its guide stars are better than the other methods. ISSM is effective for the guide star selection in the three-FOV daytime star sensor.",Energy Expenditure of a Single Sit-to-Stand Movement with Slow Versus Normal Speed Using the Different Frequency Accumulation Method.,https://www.ncbi.nlm.nih.gov/pubmed/30934628,"Medicina (Kaunas, Lithuania)",2019 05 03,"Background and objectives: The purpose of this study was to compare the energy expenditures (EE) of a single sit-to-stand (STS) movements with slow and normal speeds using a multi-stage exercise test. Materials and Methods: Twelve young males, aged 21⁻27 years (age, 23.0 ± 1.7 years; height, 171.2 ± 6.1 cm; weight, 64.3 ± 5.6 kg), performed repeated 3-s stand-up and 3-s sit-down (slow) or 1-s stand-up and 1-s sit-down (normal) movement on two different days with random order. All the participants completed multi-stage tests at different STS frequencies per minute. The slope and intercept of the linear regression relationship between the EE (kcal/min) and the STS frequency were obtained, and the slope of the regression was quantified as the EE of an STS. Results: The metabolic equivalents (METs) of the STS-slow was 4.5 METs for the frequency of 10 times/min (in total 1 min), and the net EE was 5.00 ± 1.2 kcal/min. The net EE of the STS-slow was 0.37 ± 0.12 kcal, which was significantly greater than that during the STS-normal (0.26 ± 0.06 kcal). The difference between the EEs of the STS-slow and STS-normal was significantly greater in taller and heavier subjects. Conclusions: We concluded that the intensity of STS-slow movement is moderate, and the EE during an STS-slow (0.37 ± 0.12 kcal) is higher than that during an STS-normal (0.26 ± 0.06 kcal). Our study results will help exercise and/or health professionals prescribe physical activity programs using STS movement for healthy young population groups.",Highly Linear Polyethylenes Achieved Using Thermo-Stable and Efficient Cobalt Precatalysts Bearing Carbocyclic-Fused NNN-Pincer Ligand.,https://www.ncbi.nlm.nih.gov/pubmed/30934627,"Molecules (Basel, Switzerland)",2019 04 28,"Six examples of 2-(1-arylimino)ethyl-9-arylimino-5,6,7,8-tetrahydrocycloheptapyridine-cobalt(II) chloride complexes, [2-(1-ArN)C₂H₃-9-ArN-5,6,7,8-C₅H₈C₅H₃N]CoCl₂, (Ar = 2-(C₅H₉)-6-MeC₆H₃ Co1, 2-(C₆H11)-6-MeC₆H₃ Co2, 2-(C₈H15)-6-MeC₆H₃ Co3, 2-(C₅H₉)-4,6-Me₂C₆H₂ Co4, 2-(C₆H11)-4,6-Me₂C₆H₂ Co5, and 2-(C₈H15)-4,6-Me₂C₆H₂ Co6), were synthesized by the direct reaction of the corresponding ortho-cycloalkyl substituted carbocyclic-fused bis(arylimino)pyridines (L1⁻L6) and cobalt(II) chloride in ethanol with good yields. All the synthesized ligands (L1⁻L6) and their corresponding cobalt complexes (Co1⁻Co6) were fully characterized by FT-IR, ¹H/13C-NMR spectroscopy and elemental analysis. The crystal structure of Co2 and Co3 revealed that the ring puckering of both the ortho-cyclohexyl/cyclooctyl substituents and the one pyridine-fused seven-membered ring; a square-based pyramidal geometry is conferred around the metal center. On treatment with either methylaluminoxane (MAO) or modified methylaluminoxane (MMAO), all the six complexes showed high activities (up to 4.09 × 10⁶ g of PE mol-1 (Co) h-1) toward ethylene polymerization at temperatures between 20 °C and 70 °C with the catalytic activities correlating with the type of ortho-cycloalkyl substituent: Cyclopentyl (Co1 and Co4) > cyclohexyl (Co2 and Co5) > cyclooctyl (Co3 and Co6) for either R = H or Me and afforded strictly linear polyethylene (Tm > 130 °C). The narrow unimodal distributions of the resulting polymers are consistent with single-site active species for the precatalyst. Furthermore, compared to the previously reported cobalt analogues, the titled precatalysts exhibited good thermo-stability (up to 70 °C) and possessed longer lifetime along with a higher molecular weight of PE (Mw: 9.2~25.3 kg mol-1).",Insect Oil as An Alternative to Palm Oil and Poultry Fat in Broiler Chicken Nutrition.,https://www.ncbi.nlm.nih.gov/pubmed/30934626,Animals : an open access journal from MDPI,2019 04 19,"This study was conducted to evaluate the effects of Tenebrio molitor (TM) oil as a total replacement for palm oil and poultry fat in broiler chicken diets on growth performance, nutrient digestibility, pancreatic enzyme activity, selected blood parameters and the lipid fatty acid compositions of liver and breast muscle tissues. A total of 72 seven-day-old female Ross 308 broiler chickens were used. The birds were randomly distributed into three groups with 12 replicates each, using two birds per replicate for 30 days in metabolic cages. The basal diet was supplemented with 5% palm oil, poultry fat or TM oil. There was no effect (p > 0.05) caused by the dietary oil replacement on the birds' performance and apparent nutrient digestibility. Liver size (p = 0.033), the concentration of hepatic triglycerides (p = 0.049) and total cholesterol (p = 0.048) were reduced by TM oil supplementation. Furthermore, TM oil supplementation increased n-3 and n-6 fatty acids (p = 0.006; p < 0.001, respectively) in breast muscle tissue. In conclusion, the use of TM oil in broiler chickens' diets did not show any adverse effects on performance, nutrient digestibility and blood biochemical parameters. Moreover, TM oil supplementation improved the fatty acid profiles of liver and breast muscle tissues.",Ethanol-Induced Mitochondrial Damage in Sertoli Cells is Associated with Parkin Overexpression and Activation of Mitophagy.,https://www.ncbi.nlm.nih.gov/pubmed/30934625,Cells,2019 04 24,"This study was conducted to elucidate the involvement of the PINK1-Parkin pathway in ethanol-induced mitophagy among Sertoli cells (SCs). In the research, adult rats were given intraperitoneal injections of ethanol (5 gm/kg) and sacrificed at various time periods within 24 h. Transmission electron microscopy was applied to reveal enhanced mitochondrial damage in SCs of the ethanol-treated rats (ETRs) in association with a significant increase in numbers of mitophagic vacuoles (mitophagosomes and autolysosomes) in contrast to very low levels in a control group treated with phosphate-buffered saline (PBS). This enhancement was ultra-structurally verified via observation of trapped mitochondria within LC3-labeled membranes, upregulation of LC3 protein levels, colocalization of LC3 and cytochrome c, and reduced expression of mitochondrial proteins. Importantly, Parkin expression was found to be upregulated in ETR SCs, specifically in mitochondria and mitophagosomes in addition to colocalization with PINK1 and pan-cathepsin, indicating augmented mitophagy. Transcription factor EB (TFEB, a transcription factor for autophagy and mitophagy proteins) was also found to be upregulated in nuclei of ETR SCs and associated with enhanced expression of iNOS. Enhanced Parkin-related mitophagy in ETR SCs may be a protective mechanism with therapeutic implications. To the authors' knowledge, this is the first report demonstrating the ultrastructural characteristics and molecular mechanisms of Parkin-related mitophagy in ETR SCs."

In this study we successfully constructed a thermostable fusion enzyme composed of the Sulfurihydrogenibium azorense carbonic anhydrase (Saz_CA), the fastest CA discovered to date, and the chitin binding domain (ChBD) of chitinase from Bacillus circulans. Introduction of ChBD to the Saz_CA had no major impact on the effect of ions or inhibitors on the enzymatic activity. The fusion protein exhibited no negative effects up to 60 °C, whilst the fusion partner appears to protect the enzyme from negative effects of magnesium. The prepared biocatalyst appears to be thermally activated at 60 °C and could be partially purified with heat treatment. Immobilisation attempts on different kinds of chitin-based support results have shown that the fusion enzyme preferentially binds to a cheap, untreated chitin with a large crystallinity index over more processed forms of chitin. It suggests significant potential economic benefits for large-scale deployment of immobilised CA technologies such as CO₂ utilisation or mineralisation.",Mental Health and Proximal Stressors in Transgender Men and Women.,https://www.ncbi.nlm.nih.gov/pubmed/30934613,Journal of clinical medicine,2019 04 19,"This paper explores the subjective perception of some personal and interpersonal aspects of the lives of transgender people and the relationship they have with their mental health. One hundred and twenty transgender people (60 men and 60 women) participated in semi-structured interviews. Following quantitative methodology, analysis highlighted that social loneliness is the main predictor of lower levels of mental health (anxiety and depression) for both genders and recognized romantic loneliness as the strongest factor among transgender men. In both cases, higher levels of loneliness were associated with lower levels of mental health. The results have guided us to improve institutional and social responses and have provided an opportunity to promote the mental health of transgender people.",Power-Frequency Electric Field Sensing Utilizing a Twin-FBG Fabry⁻Perot Interferometer and Polyimide Tubing with Space Charge as Field Sensing Element.,https://www.ncbi.nlm.nih.gov/pubmed/30934612,"Sensors (Basel, Switzerland)",2019 04 28,"A novel fiber-optic sensor based on the alternating electric field force actions on polyimide tubing with space charge for power-frequency electric field sensing is presented. In structure, the sensor consists of a lightweight fiber cantilever beam covered with a length of electrically charged polyimide tubing as the field sensing element. A twin-FBG based Fabry⁻Perot interferometer is embedded in this fiber beam to detect the beam vibrations excited by the force of power-frequency electric field to be sensed. Space charge in polyimide tubing is formed through a dielectric charging process. The basic concept, structure, fabrication and operation principle of the sensor are introduced with detailed theoretical analyses.

Using Taiwan Biobank and the National Health Insurance Research Database (NHIRD), we examined hyperlipidemia, sex, and their relationship with gout among Taiwanese adults with the human leukocyte antigen B (HLA-B) genetic variants. Hyperlipidemia was present in 1437 patients with gout. Sex and hyperlipidemia had significant associations on gout risk, with hyperlipidemia showing a relatively stronger effect. Gout was present in men, with an odds ratio (OR) of 1.945 (95% confidence interval (CI) 1.568⁻2.411) compared to women, and in hyperlipidemic (OR = 4.032; 95% CI: 3.581⁻4.540) compared to non-hyperlipidemic patients. The interaction of sex and hyperlipidemia was significant for rs2523608 GG (p = 0.0402) and rs4713518 AA (p = 0.0003) genotypes. After stratification, hyperlipidemia remained a risk factor in women (OR = 4.735, 95% CI: 3.375⁻6.643) and men (OR = 3.640, 95% CI: 2.916⁻4.544) with rs2523608 GG genotype.

Thus, POU1F1 gene was investigated as a candidate gene for litter size and growth performance in goats. In the current study, using direct DNA sequencing, c.682G > T, c.723T > G and c.837T > C loci were genotyped in Shaanbei white cashmere (SBWC) goats (n = 609), but c.876 + 110T > C was monomorphic. Besides, the c.682G > T locus was first identified by HinfI (Haemophilus influenzae Rf) restriction endonuclease. Association analysis results showed that the c.682G > T, c.837T > C loci and diplotypes were significantly associated with goat litter size (p < 0.05). The positive genotypes were GT and TT for the two SNPs, respectively, and the optimal diplotype was H3H7 (GTTT-TTTT). On the other hand, the c.682G > T, c.723T > G and c.837T > C strongly affected growth traits and body measurement indexes in SBWC goats (p < 0.05). The positive genotypes or allele of these SNPs were GT, G and TT, respectively. Additionally, the goats with H3H7 diplotype also had a greater growth status than others (p < 0.05). Here, individuals with same genotype had both a better litter size and growth traits, showing a positive correlation between these economic traits. Meanwhile, the positive genotypes of four SNPs were combined to obtain the optimal diplotype, which was also H3H7. These SNPs, especially the diplotype, could be used for the genomic selection of excellent individuals with a greater litter size and better growth status in goat breeding.",Provision of Bilingual Dispensing Labels to Non-Native English Speakers: An Exploratory Study.,https://www.ncbi.nlm.nih.gov/pubmed/30934609,"Pharmacy (Basel, Switzerland)",2019 04 30,"Patients with limited English proficiency living in the U.K. receive prescribed medication labels in English.

This article describes a service evaluation of the use of bilingual dispensing labels to facilitate patient understanding of medicine administration instructions. Recruited patients answered two questionnaires to assess engagement with and understanding of their medicine labels. The first was completed at the point of dispensing, and the second within six weeks. Questionnaires were either self-completed or via facilitation over the telephone. A total of 151 participants completed the first questionnaire, and 130 completed the follow-up. Key findings highlighted the lack of engagement by participants with English-language labels and their reliance on asking for help from pharmacy staff, friends, or family to understand the information. However, when provided with information in their preferred language, they reported high levels of understanding and sought help less frequently from a third party. This study has shown that this service has improved understanding of labelling information in this target group.",Antidiabetic and Cardioprotective Effects of Pharmacological Inhibition of GRK2 in db/db Mice.,https://www.ncbi.nlm.nih.gov/pubmed/30934608,International journal of molecular sciences,2019 04 28,"Despite the availability of several therapies for the management of blood glucose in diabetic patients, most of the treatments do not show benefits on diabetic cardiomyopathy, while others even favor the progression of the disease. New pharmacological targets are needed that might help the management of diabetes and its cardiovascular complications at the same time. GRK2 appears a promising target, given its established role in insulin resistance and in systolic heart failure. Using a custom peptide inhibitor of GRK2, we assessed in vitro in L6 myoblasts the effects of GRK2 inhibition on glucose extraction and insulin signaling. Afterwards, we treated diabetic male mice (db/db) for 2 weeks. Glucose tolerance (IGTT) and insulin sensitivity (ITT) were ameliorated, as was skeletal muscle glucose uptake and insulin signaling. In the heart, at the same time, the GRK2 inhibitor ameliorated inflammatory and cytokine responses, reduced oxidative stress, and corrected patterns of fetal gene expression, typical of diabetic cardiomyopathy.

The aim of this study was to analyze the impact of routine locking solutions on the incidence of CRBSI and ESI, in preserving catheter function, and on the rate of all-cause mortality in patients undergoing hemodialysis. We selected publications (from inception until July 2018) with studies comparing locking solutions for hemodialysis catheters used in patients undergoing hemodialysis. A total of 21 eligible studies were included, with a total of 4832 patients and 318,769 days of catheter use. The incidence of CRBSI and ESI was significantly lower in the treated group (citrate-based regimen) than in the controls (heparin-based regimen). No significant difference in preserving catheter function and all-cause mortality was found between the two groups. Our findings demonstrated that routine locking solutions for hemodialysis catheters effectively reduce the incidence of CRBSIs and ESIs, but our findings failed to show a benefit for preserving catheter function and mortality rates. Therefore, further studies are urgently needed to conclusively evaluate the impact of routine locking solutions on preserving catheter function and improving the rates of all-cause mortality.","Prospective Evaluation of Neoadjuvant Imatinib Use in Locally Advanced Gastrointestinal Stromal Tumors: Emphasis on the Optimal Duration of Neoadjuvant Imatinib Use, Safety, and Oncological Outcome.",https://www.ncbi.nlm.nih.gov/pubmed/30934606,Cancers,2019 04 26,"Neoadjuvant imatinib therapy has been proposed for routine practice with favorable long-term results for patients with locally advanced gastrointestinal stromal tumors (GISTs).

Indocyanine green (ICG), a safe and inexpensive dye used in clinical imaging, can be activated by near-infrared in photodynamic therapy (PDT) and photothermal therapy (PTT) to effectively kill MRSA. However, how this treatment affects MRSA drug sensitivity remains unknown. The drug-sensitivity phenotypes, bacterial growth rate, and cell-wall thickness of three MRSA strains were analyzed after ICG-PDT. Drug-resistant gene expressions were determined by polymerase chain reaction (PCR) and quantitative reverse transcription (qRT)-PCR. Related protein expressions were examined with immunoblotting. Drug sensitivity was further evaluated in animal models. MRSA that survived the treatment grew faster, and the cell wall became thinner compared to parental cells. These cells became more sensitive to oxacillin, which was partly related to mecA complex gene deletion. Skin necrosis caused by ICG-PDT-treated MRSA infection was smaller and healed faster than that infected with parental cells. With oxacillin therapy, no bacteria could be isolated from mouse lung tissue infected with ICG-PDT-treated MRSA. ICG-PDT drives MRSA toward an oxacillin-sensitive phenotype. It has the potential to develop into an alternative or adjuvant clinical treatment against MRSA wound infections."

Growing reports of resistance to antifungal drugs and the emergence of new highly virulent strains, possibly acquired in the environment, prompt the design of new vaccines able to prevent and combat emerging mycotic diseases. In this study, we evaluated the protective capacity of an enolase-based vaccine and Montanide PetGel A (PGA) as an adjuvant against S. schenckii with increased virulence by exposure to toluene. The adjuvanted vaccine induced a strong specific Th1 response and protective immunity against a challenge with either wildtype or toluene-adapted S. schenckii in Balb/c mice. This study highlights the role of the adjuvant PGA driving the quality of the anti-sporothrix immunity and the key component in the vaccine efficacy.",Protective Effects of CISD2 and Influence of Curcumin on CISD2 Expression in Aged Animals and Inflammatory Cell Model.,https://www.ncbi.nlm.nih.gov/pubmed/30934593,Nutrients,2019 04 26,"Inflammation and mitochondrial dysfunction have been linked to trauma, neurodegeneration, and aging.

Currently, few immunohistochemical markers have been established to predict the prognosis of a canine MGT. However, p53 immunostaining has been variably reported to be prognostic for canine MGTs. Additionally, while p16CDK2NA protein (p16) immunostaining has been found to be prognostic for human breast cancers, this marker has never been evaluated as a prognostic marker for canine neoplasms. In the present study, the prognostic utility of p53 and p16 was evaluated in 35 canine malignant MGTs. It was observed that 19 (54%) dogs died due to their MGTs with an overall mean survival time (MST) of 882 days. Seven MGTs showed p53 immunostaining, but this was not significantly associated with death (4 of 7 vs. 15 of 28; p = 0.6) or MST (670 vs. 934 days; p = 0.57). Five dogs had MGTs with no p16 immunostaining, 28 MGTs had intermediate p16 immunostaining, and two MGTs had increased p16 immunostaining. Neither death due to MGT (4 of 5, 14 of 28, or 1 of 2; p = 0.28) nor MST (683, 927, and 307 days; p = 0.31) were significantly associated with p16 immunostaining. Interestingly, p53 immunostaining was significantly associated with an increase or loss of p16 immunostaining. This is the first time that p16 has been evaluated as a prognostic marker for canine neoplasms. While these results suggest that a proportion of canine MGTs develop by cellular mechanisms that alter both p53 and p16 expression, there was no evidence that defects in p53 or p16 alter the behavior of a MGT. Neither p53 nor p16 was found to significantly predict prognosis, although this could reflect the limited number of MGTs included in the study.",Root-growth Characteristics Contributing to Genotypic Variation in Nitrogen Efficiency of Bottle Gourd and Rootstock Potential for Watermelon.,https://www.ncbi.nlm.nih.gov/pubmed/30934590,"Plants (Basel, Switzerland)",2019 04 30,"In this study, two hydroponic experiments were conducted in nutrient solution growth system. Experiments were conducted in growth chamber of Erciyes University, Agricultural Faculty in Kayseri, Turkey. In the first experiment, 10 local Turkish bottle gourd genotypes and two commercial watermelon cultivars were screened under 2 N doses (0.3 mM and 3.0 mM N) in RBD design with three replications for six weeks. In the second experiment, four genotypes (N-efficient: 70-07 and 07-45, N-inefficient: 35-10 and 45-07) were selected and used as rootstock for grafting with N-inefficient watermelon cultivar (Crimson Sweet) under 2 N doses. The grafted N-efficient gourd genotypes (07-45 and 70-07) significantly contributed to growth and biomass production of the N-inefficient watermelon plants as compared to non-grafted control plants and thus showed a higher rootstock potential for watermelon. The N-efficiency of some gourd genotypes was associated with vigor root growth and active root system particularly at low N conditions. These traits could be useful characters to select 'N-efficient' bottle gourd rootstocks for sustainable agriculture in the future.",Reduction of Mycotoxins during Fermentation of Whole Grain Sorghum to Whole Grain Ting (a Southern African Food).,https://www.ncbi.nlm.nih.gov/pubmed/30934589,Toxins,2019 04 23,"Mycotoxins are fungal secondary metabolites that pose health risks to exposed individuals, requiring necessary measures to reduce them. Using liquid chromatography-tandem mass spectrometry (LC-MS/MS), mycotoxins were quantified in whole grain sorghum and ting subsequently derived from two sorghum varieties (high and low tannin). The whole grain (WG) ting samples were obtained by fermenting sorghum with Lactobacillus fermentum strains (FUA 3165 and FUA 3321). Naturally (spontaneously) fermented WG-ting under the same conditions were equally analysed. Among the mycotoxins investigated, fumonisin B₁ (FB₁), B₂ (FB₂), B₃ (FB₃), T-2 toxin (T-2), zearalenone (ZEA), alpha-zearalenol (α-ZOL) and beta-zearalenol (β-ZOL) were detected in sorghum. Results obtained showed that mycotoxin concentrations significantly (p ≤ 0.05) reduced after fermentation. In particular, L. fermentum FUA 3321 showed the capability to significantly (p ≤ 0.05) reduce all the mycotoxins by 98% for FB₁, 84% for T-2 and up to 82% for α-ZOL, compared to raw low tannin sorghum. Fermenting with the L. fermentum strains showed potential to effectively reduce mycotoxin contamination in whole grain ting. Thus, we recommended L. fermentum FUA 3321 in particular to be used as a potential starter culture in sorghum fermentation.",Characteristics and Potentiality of Human Adipose-Derived Stem Cells (hASCs) Obtained from Enzymatic Digestion of Fat Graft.,https://www.ncbi.nlm.nih.gov/pubmed/30934588,Cells,2019 04 24,"Human adipose-derived stem cells localize in the stromal-vascular portion, and can be ex vivo isolated using a combination of washing steps and enzymatic digestion. For this study, we undertook a histological evaluation of traditional fat graft compared with fat graft enriched with stromal vascular fraction cells isolated by the Celution™ system to assess the interactions between cells and adipose tissue before the breast injection. In addition, we reported on histological analyses of biopsies derived from fat grafted (traditional or enriched with SVFs) in the breast in order to assess the quality of the adipose tissue, fibrosis and vessels. The hASCs derived from enzymatic digestion were systematically characterized for growth features, phenotype and multi-potent differentiation potential. They fulfill the definition of mesenchymal stem cells, albeit with a higher neural phenotype profile. These cells also express genes that constitute the core circuitry of self-renewal such as OCT4, SOX2, NANOG and neurogenic lineage genes such as NEUROD1, PAX6 and SOX3. Such findings support the hypothesis that hASCs may have a potential usefulness in neurodegenerative conditions. These data can be helpful for the development of new therapeutic approaches in personalized medicine to assess safety and efficacy of the breast reconstruction.",Plasma Rich in Growth Factors (PRGF) Disrupt the Blood-Brain Barrier Integrity and Elevate Amyloid Pathology in the Brains of 5XFAD Mice.,https://www.ncbi.nlm.nih.gov/pubmed/30934587,International journal of molecular sciences,2019 04 28,"Alzheimer's disease (AD) is the most common neurodegenerative disorder affecting 5.4 million people in the United States. Currently approved pharmacologic interventions for AD are limited to symptomatic improvement, not affecting the underlying pathology. Therefore, the search for novel therapeutic strategies is ongoing. A hallmark of AD is the compromised blood-brain barrier (BBB); thus, developing drugs that target the BBB to enhance its integrity and function could be a novel approach to prevent and/or treat AD. Previous evidence has shown the beneficial effects of growth factors in the treatment of AD pathology. Based on reported positive results obtained with the product Endoret®, the objective of this study was to investigate the effect of plasma rich in growth factors (PRGF) on the BBB integrity and function, initially in a cell-based BBB model and in 5x Familial Alzheimer's Disease (5xFAD) mice. Our results showed that while PRGF demonstrated a positive effect in the cell-based BBB model with the enhanced integrity and function of the model, the in-vivo findings showed that PRGF exacerbated amyloid pathology in 5xFAD brains. At 10 and 100% doses, PRGF increased amyloid deposition associated with increased apoptosis and neuroinflammation. In conclusion, our results suggest PRGF may not provide beneficial effects against AD and the consideration to utilize growth factors should further be investigated.","Measurement and Clinical Significance of Lipid Peroxidation as a Biomarker of Oxidative Stress: Oxidative Stress in Diabetes, Atherosclerosis, and Chronic Inflammation.",https://www.ncbi.nlm.nih.gov/pubmed/30934586,"Antioxidants (Basel, Switzerland)",2019 04 19,"Endothelial dysfunction is one of the initial steps in the pathogenesis of atherosclerosis and development of cardiovascular disease in patients with diabetes mellitus. Several risk factors are associated with endothelial dysfunction and atherosclerosis, such as hypertension, dyslipidaemia, inflammation, oxidative stress, and advanced glycation-end products. Among these risk factors, oxidative stress is the largest contributor to the formation of atherosclerotic plaques. Measurement of reactive oxygen species (ROS) is still difficult, and assays for the measurement of ROS have failed to show a consistent correlation between pathological states and oxidative stress. To solve this problem, this review summarizes the current knowledge on biomarkers of oxidative stress, especially lipid peroxidation, and discusses the roles of oxidative stress, as measured by indices of lipid peroxidation, in diabetes mellitus, atherosclerosis, and chronic inflammation.",Design and Fabrication of an Artificial Compound Eye for Multi-Spectral Imaging.,https://www.ncbi.nlm.nih.gov/pubmed/30934585,Micromachines,2019 04 28,"The artificial compound eye (ACE) structure is a new type of miniaturized, lightweight and intelligent imaging system.

The proximity exposure lithography and reactive ion etching process were used to prepare the designed multi-spectral ACE structure, and the spectral splitting and multi-spectral imaging experiments were carried out to verify the multi-spectral imaging function of the structure without axial movement. Furthermore, the structure can be designed according to actual requirements, which can be applied to covert reconnaissance, camouflage identification, gas leakage or other fields.",Halogen-Substituted Triazolethioacetamides as a Potent Skeleton for the Development of Metallo-β-Lactamase Inhibitors.,https://www.ncbi.nlm.nih.gov/pubmed/30934584,"Molecules (Basel, Switzerland)",2019 04 28,"Metallo-β-lactamases (MβLs) are the target enzymes of β-lactam antibiotic resistance, and there are no effective inhibitors against MβLs available for clinic so far. In this study, thirteen halogen-substituted triazolethioacetamides were designed and synthesized as a potent skeleton of MβLs inhibitors. All the compounds displayed inhibitory activity against ImiS with an IC50 value range of 0.032⁻15.64 μM except 7. The chlorine substituted compounds (1, 2 and 3) inhibited NDM-1 with an IC50 value of less than 0.96 μM, and the fluorine substituted 12 and 13 inhibited VIM-2 with IC50 values of 38.9 and 2.8 μM, respectively. However, none of the triazolethioacetamides exhibited activity against L1 at inhibitor concentrations of up to 1 mM. Enzyme inhibition kinetics revealed that 9 and 13 are mixed inhibitors for ImiS with Ki values of 0.074 and 0.27μM using imipenem as the substrate. Docking studies showed that 1 and 9, which have the highest inhibitory activity against ImiS, fit the binding site of CphA as a replacement of ImiS via stable interactions between the triazole group bridging ASP120 and hydroxyl group bridging ASN233."

Screening of maize lines, resistant to A. flavus infection, together with a biocontrol strategy, could help minimize subsequent aflatoxin contamination. We developed a qPCR assay to measure A. flavus biomass and showed that two African maize lines, GAF4 and KDV1, had different fungal loads for the aflatoxigenic isolate (KSM014), fourteen days after infection. The qPCR assay revealed no significant variation in A. flavus biomass between diseased and non-diseased maize tissues for GAF4, while KDV1 had a significantly higher A. flavus biomass (p < 0.05) in infected shoots and roots compared to the control. The biocontrol strategy using an atoxigenic isolate (KSM012) against the toxigenic isolate (KSM014), showed aflatoxin production inhibition at the co-infection ratio, 50:50 for both maize lines (KDV1 > 99.7% and GAF ≥ 69.4%), as confirmed by bioanalytical techniques. As far as we are aware, this is the first report in Kenya where the biomass of A. flavus from maize tissue was detected and quantified using a qPCR assay. Our results suggest that maize lines, which have adequate resistance to A. flavus, together with the appropriate biocontrol strategy, could limit outbreaks of aflatoxicoses.","Propensity of Tagetes erecta L., a Medicinal Plant Commonly Used in Diabetes Management, to Accumulate Perfluoroalkyl Substances.",https://www.ncbi.nlm.nih.gov/pubmed/30934572,Toxics,2019 04 23,"It has been extensively demonstrated that plants accumulate organic substances emanating from various sources, including soil and water. This fact suggests the potentiality of contamination of certain vital bioresources, such as medicinal plants, by persistent contaminants, such as perfluorooctanoic acid (PFOA), perfluorooctane sulfonate (PFOS), and perfluorobutane sulfonate (PFBS). Hence, in this study, the propensity of Tagetes erecta L. (a commonly used medicinal plant) to accumulate PFOA, PFOS, and PFBS was determined using liquid chromatography/tandem mass spectrometry (LC⁻MS/MS-8030). From the results, PFOA, PFOS, and PFBS were detected in all the plant samples and concentration levels were found to be 94.83 ng/g, 5.03 ng/g, and 1.44 ng/g, respectively, with bioconcentration factor (BCF) ranges of 1.30 to 2.57, 13.67 to 72.33, and 0.16 to 0.31, respectively. Little evidence exists on the bioaccumulative susceptibility of medicinal plants to these persistent organic pollutants (POPs). These results suggest that these medicinal plants (in particular, Tagetes erecta L., used for the management of diabetes) are also potential conduits of PFOA, PFOS, and PFBS into humans.",Influence of PMMA on All-Inorganic Halide Perovskite CsPbBr₃ Quantum Dots Combined with Polymer Matrix.,https://www.ncbi.nlm.nih.gov/pubmed/30934571,"Materials (Basel, Switzerland)",2019 04 28,"The poor stability of CsPbX₃ quantum dots (QDs-CsPbX₃) under wet conditions is still considered to be a key issue. In order to overcome this problem, this study presents a high molecular weight polymer matrix (polymethylmethacrylate, PMMA) incorporated into the QDs-CsPbBr₃ to improve its stability and maintain its excellent optical properties. In this study, the Cs₂CO₃, PbO, Tetrabutylammonium Bromide (TOAB) powder, oleic acid, and toluene solvent were uniformly mixed and purified to prepare high-quality QDs powders. Then, hexane was used as a dispersing agent for the QD powder to complete the perovskite QDs-CsPbBr₃ solution. Finally, a solution with different proportions of quantum dots CsPbBr₃ and PMMA was prepared and discussed. In the preparation of thin films, firstly, a thin film with the structure of glass/QD-CsPbBr₃/PMMA was fabricated in a glove box using a well-developed QDs-CsPbBr₃ solution by changing the ratio of CsPbBr₃:PMMA. The material analysis of QDs-CsPbBr₃ thin films was performed with photoluminescence (PL), transmittance, absorbance, and transmission electron microscopy (TEM).

Here, the foam properties of a composite foaming agent with different dilution ratios were studied first, high-belite sulphoaluminate cement (HBSC)-based FCs (HBFCs) with 16 groups of orthogonal mix proportions were subsequently fabricated by a pre-foaming method, and physical properties (ρd, fcu, and kc) of the cured HBFC were characterized in tandem with microstructures. The optimum mix ratios for ρd, fcu, and kc properties were obtained by the range analysis and variance analysis, and the final optimization verification and economic cost of HBFC was also carried out. Orthogonal results show that foam produced by the foaming agent at a dilution ratio of 1:30 can meet the requirements of foam properties for HBFC, with the 1 h bleeding volume, 1 h settling distance, foamability, and foam density being 65.1 ± 3.5 mL, 8.0 ± 0.4 mm, 27.9 ± 0.9 times, and 45.0 ± 1.4 kg/m³, respectively. The increase of fly ash (FA) and foam dosage can effectively reduce the kc of the cured HBFC, but also leads to the decrease of fcu due to the increase in mean pore size and the connected pore amount, and the decline of pore uniformity and pore wall strength. When the dosage of FA, water, foam, and the naphthalene-based superplasticizer of the binder is 20 wt%, 0.50, 16.5 wt%, and 0.6 wt%, the cured HBFC with ρd of 293.5 ± 4.9 kg/m³, fcu of 0.58 ± 0.02 MPa and kc of 0.09234 ± 0.00142 W/m·k is achieved. In addition, the cost of HBFC is only 39.5 $/m³, which is 5.2 $ lower than that of ordinary Portland cement (OPC)-based FC. If the surface of the optimized HBFC is further treated with water repellent, it will completely meet the requirements for a prefabricated ultra-light insulation panel.",Speciation of Chromium in Alkaline Soil Extracts by an Ion-Pair Reversed Phase HPLC-ICP MS Method.,https://www.ncbi.nlm.nih.gov/pubmed/30934569,"Molecules (Basel, Switzerland)",2019 04 28,"The aim of this work was to study by a hyphenated HPLC-ICP MS technique the chromium species released during alkaline extraction of various soils collected from a contaminated area of an old tannery. An ultrasound-assisted extraction procedure using 0.1 mol L-1 Na₂CO₃ solution was developed for the release of chromium species from the soil. The chromium species in the soil extracts were separated on a C₈ column using EDTA and TBAH solution as a mobile phase. The use of an ICP-QQQ MS spectrometer in tandem mass configuration (MS/MS) combined with an octopole reaction system (ORS³) pressurized with helium allows one to eliminate spectral interferences during Cr determination in the soil extracts. The detection limit of the procedure was 0.08 µg L-1 for Cr(III) and 0.09 µg L-1 for Cr(VI) species. The trueness of the IP RP HPLC-ICP MS method was proved by an analysis of CRM 041 and CRM 060. The advantage of the proposed method is the analysis of soil extracts without their preliminary neutralization, which limits the losses of Cr(VI) due to the reduction process. The analysed soils mainly contained chromium in immobile forms (94.6⁻98.5% of the total Cr content). In all alkaline soil extracts mostly the Cr(VI) form was found, but in the extract of organic soils Cr(III) was also present. This arose from the reduction of Cr(VI) species by organic matter (humic acids) and Fe(II). The amount of formed Cr(III) species was dependent on the type of soil (content of organic matter, Mn and Fe) and its moistness. For the first time, the presence of neutral and non-polar chromium fractions in the soil extracts was also demonstrated. It was found that reliable speciation analysis results could be obtained for mineral soils.",Novel Therapies and Approaches to Relapsed/Refractory HL Beyond Chemotherapy.,https://www.ncbi.nlm.nih.gov/pubmed/30934568,Cancers,2019 04 26,"Although Hodgkin lymphoma (HL) is highly curable with first-line therapy, relapses occur in approximately 10⁻20% of patients with early stage disease and 30⁻40% of patients with advanced stage disease. The standard approach for relapsed or refractory disease is salvage therapy, followed by consolidation with high dose therapy and autologous stem cell transplant (ASCT). Patients who achieve a complete response to salvage therapy prior to ASCT have better outcomes, thus recent studies have focused on incorporating newer agents in this setting. Major challenges in the management of relapsed patients remain how to choose and sequence the many salvage therapies that are currently available and how to best incorporate novel agents in the current treatment paradigms. In this article, we will summarize the most recent advances in the management of patients with recurrent HL and will mainly focus on the role of new agents approved and under investigation. Aside from brentuximab vedotin and checkpoint inhibitors, other novel agents and therapies are showing promising early results. However, at least with some of the newest targeted strategies, it is important to recognize that we are facing new challenges in terms of toxicities, which require very close monitoring and education of both the patient and treating physician.",Application of Ultrafiltration in a Swimming Pool Water Treatment System.,https://www.ncbi.nlm.nih.gov/pubmed/30934567,Membranes,2019 04 23,"Swimming pool water was treated using an ultrafiltration process using ceramic and polymer membranes for comparison. It was determined that the efficiency of the process depended on the type of membrane used. The polymer membrane decreased the absorbance and concentration of combined chlorine in the pool water to a greater extent than the ceramic membrane. In the case of a ceramic membrane, the concentration of combined chlorine in the permeate exceeded the limit values. During the ultrafiltration process, the permeate flux decreased, causing the blockage of membrane pores. The extent of this phenomenon was similar for both tested membranes. In the case of the ceramic membrane, flushing it with water could significantly restore its initial performance. For both tested membranes, a high regeneration efficiency was observed during chemical treatment with an alkaline solution. SEM photos of the polymer membrane showed low resistance of this polymer to the chlorine present in the swimming pool water.",Artificial Intelligence Approaches for Prediction of Compressive Strength of Geopolymer Concrete.,https://www.ncbi.nlm.nih.gov/pubmed/30934566,"Materials (Basel, Switzerland)",2019 04 28,"Geopolymer concrete (GPC) has been used as a partial replacement of Portland cement concrete (PCC) in various construction applications. In this paper, two artificial intelligence approaches, namely adaptive neuro fuzzy inference (ANFIS) and artificial neural network (ANN), were used to predict the compressive strength of GPC, where coarse and fine waste steel slag were used as aggregates. The prepared mixtures contained fly ash, sodium hydroxide in solid state, sodium silicate solution, coarse and fine steel slag aggregates as well as water, in which four variables (fly ash, sodium hydroxide, sodium silicate solution, and water) were used as input parameters for modeling. A total number of 210 samples were prepared with target-specified compressive strength at standard age of 28 days of 25, 35, and 45 MPa. Such values were obtained and used as targets for the two AI prediction tools. Evaluation of the model's performance was achieved via criteria such as mean absolute error (MAE), root mean square error (RMSE), and coefficient of determination (R²). The results showed that both ANN and ANFIS models have strong potential for predicting the compressive strength of GPC but ANFIS (MAE = 1.655 MPa, RMSE = 2.265 MPa, and R² = 0.879) is better than ANN (MAE = 1.989 MPa, RMSE = 2.423 MPa, and R² = 0.851). Sensitivity analysis was then carried out, and it was found that reducing one input parameter could only make a small change to the prediction performance.",Two Approaches for Evaluating the Effects of Galangin on the Activities and mRNA Expression of Seven CYP450.,https://www.ncbi.nlm.nih.gov/pubmed/30934565,"Molecules (Basel, Switzerland)",2019 04 28,"Galangin is a marker compound of honey and Alpinia officinarum Hance that exhibits great potential for anti-microbial, anti-diabetic, anti-obesity, anti-tumour and anti-inflammatory applications. Galangin is frequently consumed in combination with common clinical drugs. Here, we evaluated the effects of galangin on cytochrome P450 (CYP)-mediated metabolism, using two different approaches, to predict drug⁻drug interactions. Male Sprague Dawley rats were administered galangin daily for 8 weeks. A ""cocktail-probes"" approach was employed to evaluate the activities of different CYP450 enzymes. Blood samples of seven probe drugs were analysed using liquid chromatography-tandem mass spectrometry in positive and negative electrospray-ionisation modes. Pharmacokinetic parameters were calculated to identify statistical differences. CYP mRNA-expression levels were investigated in real-time quantitative polymerase chain reaction experiments. The galangin-treated group showed significantly decreased AUC0⁻∞ and Cmax values for CYP1A2, and CYP2B3. The galangin-treated group showed significantly increased AUC0⁻∞ and Cmax values for CYP2C13 and CYP3A1. No significant influences were observed in the pharmacokinetic profiles of CYP2C11, CYP2D4 and CYP2E1. The mRNA-expression results were consistent with the pharmacokinetic results. Thus, CYP450 enzyme activities may be altered by long-term galangin administration, suggesting galangin to be a promising candidate molecule for enhancing oral drug bioavailability and chemoprevention and reversing multidrug resistance.","Social Determinants of Association among Diabetes Mellitus, Visual Impairment and Hearing Loss in a Middle-Aged or Old Population: Artificial-Neural-Network Analysis of the Korean Longitudinal Study of Aging (2014⁻2016).",https://www.ncbi.nlm.nih.gov/pubmed/30934564,"Geriatrics (Basel, Switzerland)",2019 05 03,"This study introduces a new framework based on an artificial neural network (ANN) for testing whether social determinants are major determinants of association among diabetes mellitus, visual impairment and hearing loss in a middle-aged or old population."

It forms an oxidation product (DBDox) with surface-enhanced Raman scattering (SERS) activity at 1605 cm-1 in the silver nanosol substrate, and a CDNAg catalytic amplification with SERS analytical platform can be structured based on aptamer (Apt) with the DBD oxidizing reaction. For example, the aptamer (Apt) of acetamiprid (ACT) can be adsorbed on the surface of CDNAg, resulting in inhibited catalytic activity, the reduced generation of DBDox, and a weakened SERS intensity. When the target molecule ACT was added, it formed a stable Apt-ACT complex and free CDNAg that restored catalytic activity and linearly enhanced the SERS signal.

Data were analyzed using 1-way ANOVA, post-hoc Scheffé, Pearson's chi-square-test and Ciba⁻Geigy table (p = 0.05). No RS differences between the tested groups were observed (p = 0.200). ASX fractured more cohesive 2 than the control group. VSC showed more cohesive 2 than adhesive 1 fractures. VS showed more adhesive 2 than mixed fractures. AS showed more cohesive 2 than adhesive 1 and more adhesive 2 than mixed fractures. ASX showed predominantly cohesive 2 fractures. RS was not affected when HA were cleaned off by 30 s of air/water spray prior to luting.

However, in many real-world Internet of Things (IoT) service scenarios, different users may have different delay requirements. How to provide reliable differentiated services has become an urgent problem. The rise of Software-Defined Networking (SDN) provides endless possibilities to improve the QoS of publish/subscribe middlewares due to its greater programmability. We can encode event topics and priorities into flow entries of SDN switches directly to meet customized requirements. In this paper, we first propose an SDN-like publish/subscribe middleware architecture and describe how to use this architecture and priority queues supported by OpenFlow switches to realize differentiated services. Then we present a machine learning method using the eXtreme Gradient Boosting (XGBoost) model to solve the difficult issue of getting the queuing delay of switches accurately. Finally, we propose a reliable differentiated services guarantee mechanism according to the queuing delay and the programmability of SDN to improve QoS, namely, a two-layer queue management mechanism. Experimental evaluations show that the delay predicted by the XGBoost method is closer to the real value; our mechanism can save end-to-end delay, reduce packet loss rate, and allocate bandwidth more reasonably.",Graphene-Based Inks for Printing of Planar Micro-Supercapacitors: A Review.,https://www.ncbi.nlm.nih.gov/pubmed/30934549,"Materials (Basel, Switzerland)",2019 04 28,"Micro-supercapacitors have recently emerged as promising microscale power sources for portable and wearable microelectronics.

The development of viable printing technologies has also provided better means for manufacturing, bringing micro-supercapacitors closer to practical applications. This review summarizes the latest advances in graphene-based planar micro-supercapacitors, with specific emphasis placed on formulation of graphene-based inks and their fabrication routes onto interdigital electrodes.

Aortic valve thickening and calcification causing left ventricular outflow obstruction is known as calcific aortic valve stenosis (CAVS). CAVS is a chronic and progressive disease which increases in incidence and severity with age. Currently, no medical treatment exists for CAVS, and the role of autophagy in the disease remains largely unexplored. To further understand the role of autophagy in the progression of CAVS, we analyzed expression of key autophagy genes in healthy, thickened, and calcified valve tissue from 55 patients, and compared them with nine patients without significant CAVS, undergoing surgery for aortic regurgitation (AR). This revealed a upregulation in autophagy exclusively in the calcified tissue of CAVS patients. This difference in autophagy between CAVS and AR was explored by LC3 lipidation in valvular interstitial cells (VICs), revealing an upregulation in autophagic flux in CAVS patients. Inhibition of autophagy by bafilomycin-A1 led to a decrease in VIC survival. Finally, treatment of VICs with high phosphate led to an increase in autophagic activity. In conclusion, our data suggests that autophagy is upregulated in the calcified tissue of CAVS, serving as a compensatory and pro-survival mechanism.",Microbe-Host Communication by Small RNAs in Extracellular Vesicles: Vehicles for Transkingdom RNA Transportation.,https://www.ncbi.nlm.nih.gov/pubmed/30934547,International journal of molecular sciences,2019 04 28,"Extracellular vesicles (EVs) are evolutionary well-conserved nano-sized membranous vesicles that are secreted by both prokaryotic and eukaryotic cells.

While research into this field is in its infancy, elucidating the mechanisms that underlie host⁻microbe interactions and communications promises to impact many fields of biological research, including human health and medicine. Thus, this review discussed the results of recent studies that have examined the ways in which EVs and sRNAs mediate 'microbe⁻host' and 'host⁻microbe' interspecies communication.",Effect of Poly-l-Lysine Polycation on the Glucose Oxidase/Ferricyanide Composite-Based Second-Generation Blood Glucose Sensors.,https://www.ncbi.nlm.nih.gov/pubmed/30934546,"Sensors (Basel, Switzerland)",2019 04 28,"Second-generation glucose biosensors are presently the mainstream commercial solution for blood glucose measurement of diabetic patients.

The αPLL modification is shown to facilitate the redox kinetics of FIC and ferrocyanide on the SPCEs. The SPCEs coated with 0.5 mM GOx, 99.5 mM FIC, and 5 mM αPLL had better sensitivity for glucose detection due to the appreciable effect of protonated αPLL on the promotion of electron transfer between GOx and FIC. Moreover, the SPCEs coated with 0.5 mM GOx, 99.5 mM FIC, and 5 mM αPLL were packaged as blood glucose testing strips for the measurement of glucose-containing human serum samples. The glucose testing strips had good linearity from 2.8 mM to 27.5 mM and a detection limit of 2.3 mM.

The aim of this study was to evaluate the anti-fatigue effects and underlying effects of aqueous extract of Sonchus arvensis L. (SA). Male C57BL/6 mice from four groups designated vehicle, exercise, exercise with low dose (250 mg/kg) or high dose of SA (500 mg/kg), were trained by swimming exercise and orally administrated with SA every other day for 28 days. The anti-fatigue activity was determined by exhaustive swimming test, as well as the muscle structure, levels of blood hemoglobin, and metabolites including lactate and urea nitrogen. SA alleviated mice fatigue behaviors by eliminating metabolites, while improving muscle structure and hemoglobin levels. Moreover, SA enhanced glycogen synthesis of liver but not muscle via increasing GCK and PEPCK gene expressions. Importantly, SA improved antioxidant enzymes expression and activities in both liver and muscle, which was possibly related to its primary components polysaccharides and the antioxidant components including chlorogenic acid, luteolin, and chicoric acid. Taken together, the anti-fatigue effects of SA could be partly explained by its antioxidant activity and mediating effects on glycogen synthesis and metabolites elimination. Therefore, SA could be a potential nutraceutical for improving exercise performance and alleviating physical fatigue.",Are the Motives for Food Choices Different in Orthorexia Nervosa and Healthy Orthorexia?,https://www.ncbi.nlm.nih.gov/pubmed/30934544,Nutrients,2019 04 26,"Recent research points to the bidimensional nature of orthorexia, with one dimension related to interest in healthy eating (healthy orthorexia) and another dimension related to a pathological preoccupation with eating healthily (orthorexia nervosa). Research was needed to provide further support for this differentiation. We examined the food-choice motives related to both aspects of orthorexia. Participants were 460 students from a Spanish university who completed the Teruel Orthorexia Scale and the Food Choice Questionnaire. By means of structural equation modeling, we analyzed the relationship between orthorexia, food-choice motives, gender, body mass index, and age. The motives predicting food choices in orthorexia nervosa and healthy orthorexia were quite different. In the case of orthorexia nervosa, the main motive was weight control, with sensorial appeal and affect regulation also showing significant associations. For healthy orthorexia, the main motive was health content, with sensorial appeal and price also showing significant associations. This supports the hypothesis that orthorexia nervosa is associated with maladaptive eating behavior motived more by weight control than by health concerns.",Bending Properties of Mg Alloy Tailored Arc-Heat-Treated Blanks.,https://www.ncbi.nlm.nih.gov/pubmed/30934543,"Materials (Basel, Switzerland)",2019 04 28,"Tailored heat-treated blank is a special kind of sheet, and the plastic forming ability can be improved. In this work, the poor room-temperature plasticity of a tailored magnesium alloy blank was address through arc heat treatment. The formability of the material was enhanced through local modification with arc pretreatment. The plasticity of the tailored arc-heat-treated blank was verified through the V-bending test. The microstructure and mechanical properties of the blank were tested, and the mechanisms underlying its improved deformability were analyzed. The bendability of the blank first increased and then decreased as heat input increased. The maximum V-bending ability of the arc-heat-treated blank increased by 88% relative to that of the untreated blank. Although springback decreased under increasing heat input, the local strength and elastic modulus of the alloy blank were equivalent to those of the base metal. This result indicated that the springback resistance of the material did not improve. The back of the blank treated under the optimal parameters comprised heat-affected zones with good plasticity. Recrystallization and grain growth occurred in the heat-affected zones. The blank exhibited reduced hardness and improved malleability. When the heat input was further increased, however, a semi-melting zone formed on the lower surface of the blank. The formation of this zone resulted in the precipitation of intermetallic compounds from the crystal phase and increased the hardness of the blank. It also decreased the plasticity and malleability of the blank."

We demonstrate this procedure on fluorescence data from mouse T cells, which reveals distinctions between how the cells respond to different drugs.

E,2019 04 29,"The spread of opinions, memes, diseases, and ""alternative facts"" in a population depends both on the details of the spreading process and on the structure of the social and communication networks on which they spread. One feature that can change spreading dynamics substantially is heterogeneous behavior among different types of individuals in a social network. In this paper, we explore how antiestablishment nodes (e.g., hipsters) influence the spreading dynamics of two competing products. We consider a model in which spreading follows a deterministic rule for updating node states (which indicate which product has been adopted) in which an adjustable probability p_{Hip} of the nodes in a network are hipsters, who choose to adopt the product that they believe is the less popular of the two. The remaining nodes are conformists, who choose which product to adopt by considering which products their immediate neighbors have adopted. We simulate our model on both synthetic and real networks, and we show that the hipsters have a major effect on the final fraction of people who adopt each product: even when only one of the two products exists at the beginning of the simulations, a small fraction of hipsters in a network can still cause the other product to eventually become the more popular one. To account for this behavior, we construct an approximation for the steady-state adoption fractions of the products on k-regular trees in the limit of few hipsters. Additionally, our simulations demonstrate that a time delay τ in the knowledge of the product distribution in a population, as compared to immediate knowledge of product adoption among nearest neighbors, can have a large effect on the final distribution of product adoptions. Using a local-tree approximation, we derive an analytical estimate of the spreading of products and obtain good agreement if a sufficiently small fraction of the population consists of hipsters. In all networks, we find that either of the two products can become the more popular one at steady state, depending on the fraction of hipsters in the network and on the amount of delay in the knowledge of the product distribution. Our simple model and analysis may help shed light on the road to success for antiestablishment choices in elections, as such success-and qualitative differences in final outcomes between competing products, political candidates, and so on-can arise rather generically in our model from a small number of antiestablishment individuals and ordinary processes of social influence on normal individuals.",Behavior of random RNA secondary structures near the glass transition.,https://www.ncbi.nlm.nih.gov/pubmed/30934369,Physical review. E,2019 04 29,"RNA forms elaborate secondary structures through intramolecular base pairing. These structures perform critical biological functions within each cell. Due to the availability of a polynomial algorithm to calculate the partition function over these structures, they are also a suitable system for the statistical physics of disordered systems. In this model, below the denaturation temperature, random RNA secondary structures exist in one of two phases: a strongly disordered, low-temperature glass phase and a weakly disordered, high-temperature molten phase. The probability of two bases to pair decays with their distance with an exponent 3/2 in the molten phase and about 4/3 in the glass phase. Inspired by previous results from a renormalized field theory of the glass transition separating the two phases, we numerically study this transition. We introduce distinct order parameters for each phase that both vanish at the critical point. We finally explore the driving mechanism behind this transition.",Signatures of motor susceptibility to forces in the dynamics of a tracer particle in an active gel.,https://www.ncbi.nlm.nih.gov/pubmed/30934368,Physical review. E,2019 04 05,"We study a model for the motion of a tracer particle inside an active gel, exposing the properties of the van Hove distribution of the particle displacements. Active events of a typical force magnitude can give rise to non-Gaussian distributions having exponential tails or side peaks. The side peaks are predicted to appear when the local bulk elasticity of the gel is large enough and few active sources are dominant. We explain the regimes of the different distributions and study the structure of the side peaks for active sources that are susceptible to the elastic stress that they cause inside the gel. We show how the van Hove distribution is altered by both the duty cycle of the active sources and their susceptibility, and suggest it as a sensitive probe to analyze microrheology data in active systems with restoring elastic forces.",Response function framework for the dynamics of meandering or large-core spiral waves and modulated traveling waves.,https://www.ncbi.nlm.nih.gov/pubmed/30934367,Physical review. E,2019 04 05,"In many oscillatory or excitable systems, dynamical patterns emerge which are stationary or periodic in a moving frame of reference. Examples include traveling waves or spiral waves in chemical systems or cardiac tissue. We present a unified theoretical framework for the drift of such patterns under small external perturbations, in terms of overlap integrals between the perturbation and the adjoint critical eigenfunctions of the linearized operator (i.e., response functions). For spiral waves, the finite radius of the spiral tip trajectory and spiral wave meander are taken into account. Different coordinate systems can be chosen, depending on whether one wants to predict the motion of the spiral-wave tip, the time-averaged tip path, or the center of the meander flower. The framework is applied to analyze the drift of a meandering spiral wave in a constant external field in different regimes.",Designing effective thermal conductivity of materials of core-shell structure: Theory and simulation.,https://www.ncbi.nlm.nih.gov/pubmed/30934366,Physical review. E,2019 04 05,"We introduce the phenomenon of golden touch from myth to thermotics. We define golden touch as extending the core property to a shell with an extremely small core fraction.

We summarize three types (A, B, and C) of golden touch in two dimensions, and only two types (A and B) of golden touch in three dimensions. We theoretically analyze the distinct properties of different types of golden touch by delicately designing the anisotropic thermal conductivity of the shell. Golden touch is also validated by finite-element simulations which echo the theoretical analyses. Golden touch has potential applications in thermal camouflage, thermal management, etc. Our work not only lays the foundation for golden touch in thermotics, but also provides guidance for exploring golden touch in other diffusive fields like electrostatic and magnetostatic fields.",Rotating polygonal depression soliton clusters on the inner surface of a liquid ring.,https://www.ncbi.nlm.nih.gov/pubmed/30934365,Physical review.

E,2019 04 05,"The evolution of self-gravitating systems, and long-range interacting systems more generally, from initial configurations far from dynamical equilibrium is often described as a simple two-phase process: a first phase of violent relaxation bringing it to a quasistationary state in a few dynamical times, followed by a slow adiabatic evolution driven by collisional processes. In this context the complex spatial structure evident, for example, in spiral galaxies is understood either in terms of instabilities of quasistationary states or as a result of dissipative nongravitational interactions. We illustrate here, using numerical simulations, that purely self-gravitating systems evolving from quite simple initial configurations can in fact give rise easily to structures of this kind, of which the lifetime can be large compared to the dynamical characteristic time but short compared to the collisional relaxation timescale. More specifically, for a broad range of nonspherical and nonuniform rotating initial conditions, gravitational relaxation gives rise quite generically to long-lived nonstationary structures of a rich variety, characterized by spiral-like arms, bars, and even ringlike structures in special cases. These structures are a feature of the intrinsically out-of-equilibrium nature of the system's collapse, associated with a part of the system's mass while the bulk is well virialized. They are characterized by predominantly radial motions in their outermost parts, but also incorporate an extended flattened region which rotates coherently about a well-virialized core of triaxial shape with an approximately isotropic velocity dispersion. We characterize the kinematical and dynamical properties of these complex velocity fields and we briefly discuss the possible relevance of these simple toy models to the observed structure of real galaxies, emphasizing the difference between dissipative and dissipationless disk formation.",Hybrid Allen-Cahn-based lattice Boltzmann model for incompressible two-phase flows: The reduction of numerical dispersion.,https://www.ncbi.nlm.nih.gov/pubmed/30934363,Physical review.

We also propose a multiple-relaxation-time lattice Boltzmann model for solving the hybrid Allen-Cahn equation. The second-order convergence rate of the present model in space is validated by simulating the diagonal translation of circular interface. Three other numerical tests, including static bubble immersed in another fluid, bubble rising under gravity, and droplet splashing on a thin liquid film, are simulated to verify the performance of the present model in reducing the numerical dispersion.

E,2019 04 05,"Active swarms, consisting of individual agents which consume energy to move or produce work, are known to generate a diverse range of collective behaviors. Many examples of active swarms are biological in nature (e.g., fish shoals and bird flocks) and have been modeled extensively by numerical simulations. Such simulations of swarms usually assume that the swarm is homogeneous; that is, every agent has exactly the same dynamical properties. However, many biological swarms are highly heterogeneous, such as multispecies communities of micro-organisms in soil, and individual species may have a wide range of different physical properties. Here we explore heterogeneity by developing a simple model for the dynamics of a swarm of motile heterogeneous rodlike bacteria in the absence of hydrodynamic effects. Using molecular dynamics simulations of active rods confined within a two-dimensional rectangular channel, we first explore the case of homogeneous swarms and show that the key parameter governing both dynamics is ratio of the motility force to the steric force. Next we explore heterogeneous or mixed swarms in which the constituent self-propelled rods have a range of motilities and steric interactions. Our results show that the confining boundaries play a strong role in driving the segregation of mixed populations."

E,2019 04 05,"We studied properties of monolayer films of n-cyanobiphenyl (with n=5,...,8) series of mesogens anchored on the surface of single walled boron nitride nanotube. In order to assess the impact of substrate polarization on the ordering effects we compare translational and reorientational dynamics of the films with the characteristics of analogous carbon and silicon carbide nanotube based systems. We observed significant increase of the ordering degree accompanied by increased thermal stability. This ordering is less selective than those induced by the silicon carbide nanotube, which were previously reported. The antiparallel orientation of the nearest neighboring mesogens is predominant, while the system does not exhibit any long-range spatial correlations which indicates that the size of the domains is constrained to this region. These features might be of potential importance in the design of novel optoelectronic devices.",1/f noise and long-term memory of coherent structures in a turbulent shear flow.,https://www.ncbi.nlm.nih.gov/pubmed/30934349,Physical review. E,2019 04 05,"A shear flow of liquid metal (Galinstan) is driven in an annular channel by counter-rotating traveling magnetic fields imposed at the end caps. When the traveling velocities are large, the flow is turbulent and its azimuthal component displays random reversals. Power spectra of the velocity field exhibit a 1/f^{α} power law on several decades and are related to power-law probability distributions P(τ)∼τ^{-β} of the waiting times between successive reversals. This 1/f type spectrum is observed only when the Reynolds number is large enough. In addition, the exponents α and β are controlled by the symmetry of the system; a continuous transition between two different types of Flicker noise is observed as the equatorial symmetry of the flow is broken, in agreement with theoretical predictions.",Local roughness exponent in the nonlinear molecular-beam-epitaxy universality class in one dimension.,https://www.ncbi.nlm.nih.gov/pubmed/30934348,Physical review. E,2019 04 05,"We report local roughness exponents, α_{loc}, for three interface growth models in one dimension which are believed to belong to the nonlinear molecular-beam-epitaxy (nMBE) universality class represented by the Villain-Lais-Das Sarma (VLDS) stochastic equation. We applied an optimum detrended fluctuation analysis (ODFA) [Luis et al., Phys. Rev. E 95, 042801 (2017)2470-004510.1103/PhysRevE.95.042801] and compared the outcomes with standard detrending methods. We observe in all investigated models that ODFA outperforms the standard methods providing exponents in the narrow interval α_{loc}^{}∈[0.96,0.98] quantitatively consistent with two-loop renormalization group predictions for the VLDS equation. In particular, these exponent values are calculated for the Clarke-Vvdensky and Das Sarma-Tamborenea models characterized by very strong corrections to the scaling, for which large deviations of these values had been reported. Our results strongly support the absence of anomalous scaling in the nMBE universality class and the existence of corrections in the form α_{loc}^{}=1-ε of the one-loop renormalization group analysis of the VLDS equation.",Turbulence and jet-driven zonal flows: Secondary circulation in rotating fluids due to asymmetric forcing.,https://www.ncbi.nlm.nih.gov/pubmed/30934347,Physical review. E,2019 04 05,"We report on experiments and modeling on a rotating confined liquid that is forced by circumferential jets coaxial with the rotation axis, wherein system-scale secondary flows are observed to emerge. The jets are evenly divided in number between inlets and outlets and have zero net mass transport. For low forcing strengths the sign of this flow depends on the sign of a sloped end cap, which simulates a planetary β plane. For increased forcing strengths the secondary flow direction is insensitive to the slope sign, and instead appears to be dominated by an asymmetry in the forcing mechanism, namely, the difference in radial divergence between the inlet and outlet jet profiles. This asymmetry yields a net radial velocity that is affected by the Coriolis force, inducing secondary zonal flow.",Numerical simulation of optical control for a soft particle in a microchannel.,https://www.ncbi.nlm.nih.gov/pubmed/30934346,Physical review. E,2019 04 05,"Technologies that use optical force to actively control particles in microchannels are a significant area of research interest in various fields. An optical force is generated by the momentum change caused by the refraction and reflection of light, which changes the particle surface as a function of the angle of incidence of light and which in turn feeds back and modifies the force on the particle. Simulating this phenomenon is a complex task. The deformation of a particle, the interaction between the surrounding fluid and the particle, and the reflection and refraction of light should be analyzed simultaneously. Herein, a deformable particle in a microchannel subjected to optical interactions is simulated using the three-dimensional lattice Boltzmann immersed-boundary method. The laser from the optical source is analyzed by dividing it into individual rays. To calculate the optical forces exerted on the particle, the intensity, momentum, and ray direction are calculated. The optical-separator problem with one optical source is analyzed by measuring the distance traveled because of the optical force. The optical-stretcher problem with two optical sources is then studied by analyzing the relation between the intensity of the optical source and particle deformation. This simulation will help the design of sorting and measuring by optical force.",Revisiting the cavity-method threshold for random 3-SAT.,https://www.ncbi.nlm.nih.gov/pubmed/30934345,Physical review. E,2019 04 05,"A detailed Monte Carlo study of the satisfiability threshold for random 3-SAT has been undertaken. In combination with a monotonicity assumption we find that the threshold for random 3-SAT satisfies α_{3}≤4.262. If the assumption is correct, this means that the actual threshold value for k=3 is lower than that given by the cavity method. In contrast the latter has recently been shown to give the correct value for large k. Our result thus indicate that there are distinct behaviors for k above and below some critical k_{c}, and the cavity method may provide a correct mean-field picture for the range above k_{c}.",Shape oscillations of a nonspherical water droplet.,https://www.ncbi.nlm.nih.gov/pubmed/30934343,Physical review. E,2019 04 05,"The dynamics of a nonspherical droplet falling in air is investigated via three-dimensional numerical simulations of the Navier-Stokes and continuity equations. The main focus of this work is to study the effects of the relative influence of surface tension force over the inertial force and the orientation of the droplet. The values of the dimensionless parameters considered in this study are similar to those of a typical falling raindrop. Our results obtained from the numerical simulations for low values of Galilei number agree well with the theoretical predictions in the microgravity condition and in the limit of creeping flow. However, in the inertia-dominated region and for high initial aspect ratio, the droplet undergoes predominant nonlinear oscillations and subsequently breaks up. To the best of our knowledge, none of the previous studies have investigated dynamics of a tilted drop and observed the behavior reported in the present study.",Shortcut-to-adiabaticity Otto engine: A twist to finite-time thermodynamics.,https://www.ncbi.nlm.nih.gov/pubmed/30934342,Physical review.

We then use the minimum allowed time for validity of STA protocol relation to establish a physically relevant bound to the efficiency at maximum power of the STA-driven cycle.",Long-range correlation properties of stationary linear models with mixed periodicities.,https://www.ncbi.nlm.nih.gov/pubmed/30934341,Physical review. E,2019 04 05,"We consider the problem of (stationary and linear) source systems which generate time series data with long-range correlations. We use the discrete Fourier transform (DFT) and build stationary linear models using artificial time series data exhibiting a 1/f spectrum, where the models can include only terms that contribute significantly to the model as assessed by information criteria. The result is that the optimal (best) model is only composed of mixed periodicities [that is, the model does not include all (continuous) periodicities] and the time series data generated by the model exhibit a clear 1/f spectrum in a wide frequency range. It is considered that as the 1/f spectrum is a consequence of the contributions of all periods, consecutive periods are indispensable to generate such data by stationary linear models. However, the results indicate that there are cases where this expectation is not always met. These results also imply that although we can know linear features of time series data using the DFT, we always cannot substantially infer the type of the source system, even if the system is stationary linear."

E,2019 04 05,"The ordering effects of driven spherocylinder-shaped rods in a colloidal suspension of small spheres confined to a two-dimensional channel geometry are observed via Brownian dynamics simulations without hydrodynamics. To describe the ordering, an order parameter and an expression for a potential of mean force of an equivalent equilibrium system are defined and analyzed. By varying the application point of the external force along the rods and thus the resulting lever, a transition from a preferred orientation parallel to the direction of the force to a preferred orientation perpendicular to the direction of the force was observed. It is shown that this effect can only be found if the spheres and multiple rods are present. Furthermore, a dependency of the order parameter on the absolute value of the force was discovered. The analysis of the potential of mean force further indicates a transition between two different phases of mean orientation. An observation of the flow equilibrium mean velocity in channel direction led to a s-shaped progression regarding the lever dependency, also marking a transition between two states linked to the mean orientation of the rods. A finite size analysis was conducted. Its results indicate that the transition between the two orientation states is a general phenomenon of the observed rod-sphere mixture.",Phase transitions and pattern formation in ensembles of phase-amplitude solitons in quasi-one-dimensional electronic systems.,https://www.ncbi.nlm.nih.gov/pubmed/30934327,Physical review. E,2019 04 05,"Most common types of symmetry breaking in quasi-one-dimensional electronic systems possess a combined manifold of states degenerate with respect to both the phase θ and the amplitude A sign of the order parameter Aexp(iθ). These degrees of freedom can be controlled or accessed independently via either the spin polarization or the charge densities. To understand statistical properties and the phase diagram in the course of cooling under the controlled parameters, we present here an analytical treatment supported by Monte Carlo simulations for a generic coarse-grained two-field model of XY-Ising type. The degeneracies give rise to two coexisting types of topologically nontrivial configurations: phase vortices and amplitude kinks, i.e., the solitons. In two- and three-dimensional states with long-range (or Berezinskii--Kosterlitz--Thouless-type) orders, the topological confinement sets in at a temperature T=T_{1} which binds together the kinks and unusual half-integer vortices. At a lower T=T_{2}, the solitons start to aggregate into walls formed as rods of amplitude kinks which are ultimately terminated by half-integer vortices. With lowering T, the walls multiply, passing sequentially across the sample. The presented results indicate a possible physical realization of a peculiar system of half-integer vortices with rods of amplitude kinks connecting their cores. Its experimental realization becomes feasible in view of recent successes in real-space observations and even manipulations of domain walls in correlated electronic systems.",Self-stresses control stiffness and stability in overconstrained disordered networks.,https://www.ncbi.nlm.nih.gov/pubmed/30934326,Physical review. E,2019 04 05,"We investigate the interplay between prestress and mechanical properties in random elastic networks. To do this in a controlled fashion, we introduce an algorithm for creating random free-standing frames that support exactly one state of self-stress. By multiplying all the bond tensions in this state of self-stress by the same number-which with the appropriate normalization corresponds to the physical prestress inside the frame-we systematically evaluate the linear mechanical response of the frame as a function of prestress. After proving that the mechanical moduli of affinely deforming frames are rigorously independent of prestress, we turn to nonaffinely deforming frames. In such frames, prestress has a profound effect on linear response: not only can it change the values of the linear modulus-an effect we demonstrate to be related to a suppressive effect of prestress on nonaffinity-but prestresses also generically trigger a bistable mechanical response. Thus, prestress can be leveraged to both augment the mechanical response of network architectures on the fly, and to actuate finite deformations. These control modalities may be of use in the design of both novel responsive materials and soft actuators.",Heterogeneity and chaos in the Peyrard-Bishop-Dauxois DNA model.,https://www.ncbi.nlm.nih.gov/pubmed/30934325,Physical review.

We also consider the effect of the alternation index, which measures the heterogeneity of the DNA chain through the number of alternations between different types (AT or GC) of base pairs, on the chaotic behavior of the system.

Predictions are compared with data from Monte Carlo simulations of the three-dimensional, XXZ Heisenberg antiferromagnet in a field in order to study the finite-size behavior on a L×L×L simple cubic lattice for the first-order ""spin-flop"" transition between the Ising-like antiferromagnetic state and the canted, XY-like state. Our theory predicts that for large linear dimension L the field dependence of all moments of the order parameters as well as the fourth-order cumulants exhibit universal intersections. Corrections to leading order should scale as the inverse volume. The values of these intersections at the spin-flop transition point can be expressed in terms of a factor q that characterizes the relative degeneracy of the ordered phases. Our theory yields q=π, and we present numerical evidence that is compatible with this prediction. The agreement between the theory and simulation implies a heretofore unknown universality can be invoked for first-order phase transitions.",Nonlinear resonances generate large-scale convection cells in phase space.,https://www.ncbi.nlm.nih.gov/pubmed/30934323,Physical review.

E,2019 04 29,"A question in evolutionary biology is why the number of males is approximately equal to that of females in many species, and Fisher's theory of equal investment answers that it is the evolutionarily stable state. The Fisherian mechanism can be given a concrete form by a genetic model based on the following assumptions: (1) Males and females mate at random. (2) An allele acts on the father to determine the expected progeny sex ratio. (3) The offspring inherits the allele from either side of the parents with equal probability. The model is known to achieve the 1:1 sex ratio due to the invasion of mutant alleles with different progeny sex ratios. In this study, however, we argue that mutation plays a more subtle role in that fluctuations caused by mutation renormalize the sex ratio and thereby keep it away from 1:1 in general. This finding shows how the sex ratio is affected by mutation in a systematic way, whereby the effective mutation rate can be estimated from an observed sex ratio.",Speeding up the study of diluted dipolar systems.,https://www.ncbi.nlm.nih.gov/pubmed/30934321,Physical review.

For odd q, below the critical temperature starts a synchronization regime which ends via a second phase transition at lower temperatures, while for even q this intermediate phase disappears. We find that interactions have no effects except below critical temperature for attractive interactions. A thermodynamic analysis reveals that the dissipated work is reduced in this regime, whose temperature range is shown to decrease as q increases. The q dependence of the power-efficiency trade-off is also analyzed.",Entropy-driven docosahedral short-range order in simple liquids and glasses.,https://www.ncbi.nlm.nih.gov/pubmed/30934319,Physical review.

However, which local structure dominates and why it is more frequent than the others remain unanswered questions. In this study, by using a recently developed structure descriptor, we show that docosahedral structures are the most favored not only in models of simple liquids and glasses but also in an experimental colloid glass. We also show that the the predominance of docosahedral structures is entropy-driven. Our findings represent a significant milestone towards comprehending mysterious phenomena such as supercooling, glass transition, and crystallization, where local structures play a key role."

E,2019 04 05,"The phenomena of diffusion in multicomponent (more than two components) mixtures are universal in both science and engineering, and from the mathematical point of view, they are usually described by the Maxwell-Stefan (MS)-theory-based diffusion equations where the molar average velocity is assumed to be zero. In this paper, we propose a multiple-relaxation-time lattice Boltzmann (LB) model for the mass diffusion in multicomponent mixtures and also perform a Chapman-Enskog analysis to show that the MS continuum equations can be correctly recovered from the developed LB model. In addition, considering the fact that the MS-theory-based diffusion equations are just a diffusion type of partial differential equations, we can also adopt much simpler lattice structures to reduce the computational cost of present LB model. We then conduct some simulations to test this model and find that the results are in good agreement with the previous work. Besides, the reverse diffusion, osmotic diffusion, and diffusion barrier phenomena are also captured. Finally, compared to the kinetic-theory-based LB models for multicomponent gas diffusion, the present model does not include any complicated interpolations, and its collision process can still be implemented locally. Therefore, the advantages of single-component LB method can also be preserved in present LB model.","Distinct dynamical behavior in Erdős-Rényi networks, regular random networks, ring lattices, and all-to-all neuronal networks.",https://www.ncbi.nlm.nih.gov/pubmed/30934305,Physical review. E,2019 04 05,"Neuronal network dynamics depends on network structure. In this paper we study how network topology underpins the emergence of different dynamical behaviors in neuronal networks. In particular, we consider neuronal network dynamics on Erdős-Rényi (ER) networks, regular random (RR) networks, ring lattices, and all-to-all networks. We solve analytically a neuronal network model with stochastic binary-state neurons in all the network topologies, except ring lattices. Given that apart from network structure, all four models are equivalent, this allows us to understand the role of network structure in neuronal network dynamics. While ER and RR networks are characterized by similar phase diagrams, we find strikingly different phase diagrams in the all-to-all network. Neuronal network dynamics is not only different within certain parameter ranges, but it also undergoes different bifurcations (with a richer repertoire of bifurcations in ER and RR compared to all-to-all networks). This suggests that local heterogeneity in the ratio between excitation and inhibition plays a crucial role on emergent dynamics. Furthermore, we also observe one subtle discrepancy between ER and RR networks, namely, ER networks undergo a neuronal activity jump at lower noise levels compared to RR networks, presumably due to the degree heterogeneity in ER networks that is absent in RR networks. Finally, a comparison between network oscillations in RR networks and ring lattices shows the importance of small-world properties in sustaining stable network oscillations.",Large deviations of random walks on random graphs.,https://www.ncbi.nlm.nih.gov/pubmed/30934304,Physical review.

Two observables are considered: the sum of the degrees visited by the random walk and the sum of their logarithm, related to the trajectory entropy. The modified random walk is used for both quantities to explain how sudden changes in degree fluctuations, similar to dynamical phase transitions, are related to localization transitions. For the second quantity, we also establish links between the large deviations of the trajectory entropy and the maximum entropy random walk.",Role of trap recharge time on the statistics of captured particles.,https://www.ncbi.nlm.nih.gov/pubmed/30934303,Physical review. E,2019 04 05,"We consider n particles diffusing freely in a domain. The boundary contains absorbing escape regions, where the particles can escape, and traps, where the particles can be captured. Modeled after biological examples such as receptors in the synaptic cleft and ambush predators waiting for prey, these traps, or capture regions, must recharge between captures. We are interested in characterizing the time courses of the number of particles remaining in the domain, the number of cumulative captures, and the number of available capture regions. We find that under certain conditions, the number of cumulative captures increases linearly in time with a slope and duration determined explicitly by the recharge rate of the capture regions. This recharge rate also determines the mean and variance of the clearance time, defined as the time it takes for all particles to leave the domain. Further, we find that while a finite recharge rate will always result in a lower number of captured particles when compared to instantaneous recharging, it can either increase or decrease the amount of variability. Lastly, we extend the model to partially absorbing traps in order to investigate the dynamics of receptor activation within an idealized synaptic cleft. We find that the width of the domain controls the amount of time that these receptors are activated, while the number of receptors controls the amplitude of activation. Our mathematical results are derived from considering this system in several ways: as a full spatial diffusion process with recharging traps, as a continuous-time Markov process on a discrete state space, and as a system of ordinary differential equations in a mean-field approximation.","Erratum: Phase diagram of the Weeks-Chandler-Andersen potential from very low to high temperatures and pressures [Phys.

We show that the transition from hot spot ignition to the onset of propagating burn occurs when the alpha heating within the hot spot has amplified the fusion yield by 15× to 25× with respect to the compression-only case without alpha energy deposition. This yield amplification corresponds to a value of the fractional alpha energy f_{α}≈1.4 (f_{α}=0.5 alpha energy/hot spot energy). The parameter f_{α} can be inferred in ICF experiments by measuring the neutron yield, hot spot size, temperature, and burn width. This ignition threshold is measurable and applicable to all ICF implosions of deuterium and tritium targets both direct and indirect drive.

As the result of this pruning the network is reduced to a subgraph which we call the Generalized k-core (Gk-core). Performing this pruning for the sequence of natural numbers k, we decompose the network into a hierarchy of progressively nested Gk-cores. We present an analytical framework for description of Gk-core percolation for undirected uncorrelated networks with arbitrary degree distributions (configuration model). To confirm our results, we also derive rate equations for the k-leaf removal algorithm which enable us to obtain the structural characteristics of the Gk-cores in another way.

Here we analyze individual modes of synchronization for a periodically forced canonical model and present a complete set of driven behaviors for all parameter regimes available in the model. Using a closed-form approximation, we show that the Arnold tongue (i.e., locking region) for k:m synchronization gets narrower as k and m increase. We find that numerical simulations of the canonical model closely follow the analysis of individual modes when forcing is weak, but they deviate at high forcing amplitudes for which oscillator dynamics are simultaneously influenced by multiple modes of synchronization.",Hidden scale invariance at high pressures in gold and five other face-centered-cubic metal crystals.,https://www.ncbi.nlm.nih.gov/pubmed/30934297,Physical review. E,2019 04 05,"Recent density functional theory simulations showed that metals have a hitherto overlooked symmetry termed ""hidden scale invariance"" [Hummel et al., Phys. Rev. B 92, 174116 (2015)PRBMDO1098-012110.1103/PhysRevB.92.174116]. This scaling property implies the existence of lines in the thermodynamic phase diagram, so-called isomorphs, along which structure and dynamics are invariant to a good approximation when given in properly reduced units. This means that the phase diagram becomes effectively one-dimensional with regard to several physical properties. This paper investigates consequences and implications of the isomorph theory in six metallic crystals: Au, Ni, Cu, Pd, Ag, and Pt. The data are obtained from molecular dynamics simulations employing many-body effective medium theory (EMT) to model the atomic interactions realistically. We test the predictions from isomorph theory for structure and dynamics by means of the radial distribution and the velocity autocorrelation functions, as well as the prediction of instantaneous equilibration after a jump between two isomorphic state points. Many properties of crystals tend to be dominated by defects, and many of the properties associated with these defects are expected to be isomorph invariant as well. This is investigated in this paper for the case of vacancy diffusion. In regard to the perfect crystal properties, we find the predicted invariance of structure and also, though less perfectly, of dynamics. We show results on the variation of the density-scaling exponent γ, which can be related to the Grüneisen parameter, for all six metals. We consider large density changes up to a factor of two, corresponding to very high pressures. Unlike systems modeled using the Lennard-Jones potential where the density-scaling exponent γ is almost constant, this quantity varies substantially when using the EMT potential and is also strongly material dependent.",Machine learning characterization of structural defects in amorphous packings of dimers and ellipses.,https://www.ncbi.nlm.nih.gov/pubmed/30934296,Physical review.

However, when particle shapes are elongated, as in the case of dimers and ellipses, we find that the standard structure functions produce imprecise softness measurements. Moreover, ellipses exhibit deformation profiles in stark contrast to circular particles. In order to account for the effects of orientation and alignment, we introduce structure functions to recover the predictive performance of softness, as well as provide physical insight into local and extended dynamics. We study a model disordered solid, a bidisperse two-dimensional granular pillar, driven by uniaxial compression and composed entirely of monomers, dimers, or ellipses. We demonstrate how the computation of softness via a support vector machine extends to dimers and ellipses with the introduction of orientational structure functions. Then we highlight the spatial extent of rearrangements and defects, as well as their cross correlation, for each particle shape. Finally, we demonstrate how an additional machine learning algorithm, recursive feature elimination, provides an avenue to better understand how softness arises from particular structural aspects. We identify the most crucial structure functions in determining softness and discuss their physical implications."

E,2019 04 05,"Superdiffusion, characterized by a spreading rate t^{1/α} of the probability density function p(x,t)=t^{-1/α}p(t^{-1/α}x,1), where t is time, may be modeled by space-fractional diffusion equations with order 1<α<2. Some applications in biophysics (calcium spark diffusion), image processing, and computational fluid dynamics utilize integer-order and fractional-order exponents beyond this range (α>2), known as high-order diffusion or hyperdiffusion. Recently, space-time duality, motivated by Zolotarev's duality law for stable densities, established a link between time-fractional and space-fractional diffusion for 1<α≤2. This paper extends space-time duality to fractional exponents 1<α≤3, and several applications are presented. In particular, it will be shown that space-fractional diffusion equations with order 2<α≤3 model subdiffusion and have a stochastic interpretation. A space-time duality for tempered fractional equations, which models transient anomalous diffusion, is also developed.",Entropy-based randomization of rating networks.,https://www.ncbi.nlm.nih.gov/pubmed/30934284,Physical review. E,2019 04 05,"In recent years, due to the great diffusion of e-commerce, online rating platforms quickly became a common tool for purchase recommendations. However, instruments for their analysis did not evolve at the same speed. Indeed, interesting information about users' habits and tastes can be recovered just considering the bipartite network of users and products, in which links represent products' purchases and have different weights due to the score assigned to the item in users' reviews. With respect to other weighted bipartite networks, in these systems we observe a maximum possible weight per link, that limits the variability of the outcomes. In the present article we propose an entropy-based randomization method for this type of networks (i.e., bipartite rating networks) by extending the configuration model framework: the randomized network satisfies the constraints of the degree per rating, i.e., the number of given ratings received by the specified product or assigned by the single user. We first show that such a null model is able to reproduce several nontrivial features of the real network better than other null models. Then, using our model as benchmark, we project the information contained in the real system on one of the layers: To provide an interpretation of the projection obtained, we run the Louvain community detection on the obtained network and discuss the observed division in clusters. We are able to detect groups of music albums due to the consumers' taste or communities of movies due to their audience. Finally, we show that our method is also able to handle the special case of categorical bipartite networks: we consider the bipartite categorical network of scientific journals recognized for the scientific qualification in economics and statistics. In the end, from the outcome of our method, the probability that each user appreciate every product can be easily recovered. Therefore, this information may be employed in future applications to implement a more detailed recommendation system that also takes into account information regarding the topology of the observed network.",Coevolution of nodes and links: Diversity-driven coexistence in cyclic competition of three species.,https://www.ncbi.nlm.nih.gov/pubmed/30934283,Physical review. E,2019 04 05,"When three species compete cyclically in a well-mixed, stochastic system of N individuals, extinction is known to typically occur at times scaling as the system size N. This happens, for example, in rock-paper-scissors games or conserved Lotka-Volterra models in which every pair of individuals can interact on a complete graph. Here we show that if the competing individuals also have a ""social temperament"" to be either introverted or extroverted, leading them to cut or add links, respectively, then long-living states in which all species coexist can occur. These nonequilibrium quasisteady states only occur when both introverts and extroverts are present, thus showing that diversity can lead to stability in complex systems. In this case, it enables a subtle balance between species competition and network dynamics to be maintained.",Nonlinear and nonlocal elasticity in coarse-grained differential-tension models of epithelia.,https://www.ncbi.nlm.nih.gov/pubmed/30934282,Physical review. E,2019 04 29,"The shapes of epithelial tissues result from a complex interplay of contractile forces in the cytoskeleta of the cells in the tissue and adhesion forces between them. A host of discrete, cell-based models describe these forces by assigning different surface tensions to the apical, basal, and lateral sides of the cells. These differential-tension models have been used to describe the deformations of epithelia in different living systems, but the underlying continuum mechanics at the scale of the epithelium are still unclear. Here, we derive a continuum theory for a simple differential-tension model of a two-dimensional epithelial monolayer and study the buckling of this epithelium under imposed compression. The analysis reveals how the cell-level properties encoded in the differential-tension model lead to linear and nonlinear elastic as well as nonlocal, nonelastic behavior at the continuum level.",Dynamics of bubble-bubble interactions experiencing viscoelastic drag.,https://www.ncbi.nlm.nih.gov/pubmed/30934281,Physical review. E,2019 04 05,"The subject of the present theoretical study is the dynamics of bubble-bubble interactions in a viscoelastic medium. First, new equations for calculating the viscoelastic drag exerted on bubbles during their translational motion in a viscoelastic medium are derived. The drag equations are incorporated in the bubble-bubble interaction model in which, thereby, both the translational and radial motions of the bubbles are affected by the viscoelastic features of the medium. Second, the derived equations are applied to investigate how the viscoelastic properties of the medium can affect the dynamics of multiple bubbles, as well as how the bubbles can affect each other. It was discovered that the bubble-bubble interaction can significantly influence the dynamics of a single bubble. As the distance between the bubbles increases, their effect on each other decreases, and at a distance of several millimeters, this effect can be neglected. Moreover, it was concluded that with increasing elasticity and viscosity of the medium, as well with decreasing relaxation time, the effects of other bubbles on the current bubble's radial motion can become negligible. The translational motion of the bubbles was investigated for different viscoelastic models. The elasticity resists the motion of bubbles in space, resulting in a dynamical steady state of the distance between the bubbles at high elasticity values. The relaxation time of the medium was also found to be important in terms of the bubbles' translational movement.",Cancellation exponents in isotropic turbulence and magnetohydrodynamic turbulence.,https://www.ncbi.nlm.nih.gov/pubmed/30934280,Physical review. E,2019 04 05,"Small-scale characteristics of turbulence such as velocity gradients and vorticity fluctuate rapidly in magnitude and oscillate in sign. Much work exists on the characterization of magnitude variations, but far less on sign oscillations. While in homogeneous turbulence averages performed on large scales tend to zero because of the oscillatory character, those performed on increasingly smaller scales will vary with the averaging scale in some characteristic way. This characteristic variation at high Reynolds numbers is captured by the so-called cancellation exponent, which measures how local averages tend to cancel out as the averaging scale increases, in space or time. Past experimental work suggests that the exponents in turbulence depend on whether one considers quantities in full three-dimensional (3D) space or uses their one- or two-dimensional cuts. We compute cancellation exponents of vorticity and longitudinal as well as transverse velocity gradients in isotropic turbulence at Taylor-scale Reynolds numbers up to 1300 on 8192^{3} grids. The 2D cuts yield the same exponents as those for full 3D, while the 1D cuts yield smaller numbers, suggesting that the results in higher dimensions are more reliable. We make the case that the presence of vortical filaments in isotropic turbulence leads to this conclusion. This effect is particularly conspicuous in magnetohydrodynamic turbulence, where an increased degree of spatial coherence develops along the direction of an imposed magnetic field.",Population size changes and extinction risk of populations driven by mutant interactors.,https://www.ncbi.nlm.nih.gov/pubmed/30934279,Physical review. E,2019 04 29,"Spontaneous random mutations are an important source of variation in populations. Many evolutionary models consider mutants with a fixed fitness, chosen from a fitness distribution without considering microscopic interactions among the residents and mutants. Here, we go beyond this and consider ""mutant interactors,"" which lead to new interactions between the residents and invading mutants that can affect the population size and the extinction risk of populations. We model microscopic interactions between individuals by using a dynamic interaction matrix, the dimension of which increases with the emergence of a new mutant and decreases with extinction. The new interaction parameters of the mutant follow a probability distribution around the payoff entries of its ancestor. These new interactions can drive the population away from the previous equilibrium and lead to changes in the population size. Thus, the population size is an evolving property rather than an externally controlled variable. We calculate the average population size of our stochastic system over time and quantify the extinction risk of the population by the mean time to extinction.",Synchronization in network geometries with finite spectral dimension.,https://www.ncbi.nlm.nih.gov/pubmed/30934278,Physical review. E,2019 04 05,"Recently there is a surge of interest in network geometry and topology. Here we show that the spectral dimension plays a fundamental role in establishing a clear relation between the topological and geometrical properties of a network and its dynamics. Specifically we explore the role of the spectral dimension in determining the synchronization properties of the Kuramoto model. We show that the synchronized phase can only be thermodynamically stable for spectral dimensions above four and that phase entrainment of the oscillators can only be found for spectral dimensions greater than two. We numerically test our analytical predictions on the recently introduced model of network geometry called complex network manifolds, which displays a tunable spectral dimension.",Effects of cosolvent partitioning on conformational transitions and chain flexibility of thermoresponsive microgels.,https://www.ncbi.nlm.nih.gov/pubmed/30934277,Physical review. E,2019 04 05,"The conformational collapse of polymers in mixtures of two individually good solvents is an intriguing yet puzzling phenomenon termed cononsolvency. In this paper, the concept of the preferential adsorption of the cosolvent is combined with mean-field approaches to elaborate the cononsolvency effect of dimethylformamide (DMF) on the thermoresponsive poly(N-isopropylacrylamide) (PNIPAM) microgels in aqueous solutions. We give a quantitative description concerning the effects of DMF preferential adsorption and partitioning on the reentrant transition of PNIPAM microgels below the lower critical solution temperature (LCST) of PNIPAM. While the DMF cononsolvency incurs the conformational collapse, the affinity of DMF molecules to PNIPAM chains becomes increasingly stronger, which reveals that the conformational collapse is decoupled from the solvent quality of DMF-water mixtures. Considering the chain elasticity, spatial constraints, and surface charge of microgels, we explore the cononsolvency effect on the persistence length quantifying the PNIPAM flexibility. Our analysis elucidates that, depending on chain length and temperature, the DMF cononsolvency-induced collapse of PNIPAM microgels leads to a remarkable increase in the persistent length below LCST, which is comparable to the experimental data regarding suspension mechanical properties of PNIPAM microgels in water above LCST.",Solution to the plateau problem in the Green-Kubo formula.,https://www.ncbi.nlm.nih.gov/pubmed/30934276,Physical review. E,2019 04 05,"Transport coefficients appearing in Markovian dynamic equations for coarse-grained variables have microscopic expressions given by Green-Kubo formulas. These formulas may suffer from the well-known plateau problem. The problem arises because the Green-Kubo running integrals decay as the correlation of the coarse-grained variables themselves. The usual solution is to resort to an extreme timescale separation, for which the plateau problem is minor. Within the context of Mori projection operator formulation, we offer an alternative expression for the transport coefficients that is given by a corrected Green-Kubo expression that has no plateau problem by construction. The only assumption is that the Markovian approximation is valid in such a way that transport coefficients can be defined, even in the case that the separation of timescales is not extreme."

E,2019 04 05,"We study the size-density and size-topology relations in random packings of dry adhesive polydisperse microspheres with Gaussian and lognormal size distributions through a geometric tessellation. We find that the dependence of the neighbor number on the centric particle size is always quasilinear, regardless of the size distribution, size span, or interparticle adhesion. The average local packing fraction as a function of normalized particle size for different size variances is well regressed on the same profile, which increases to larger values as the relative strength of adhesion decreases. The variations of the local coordination number with the particle size converge onto a single curve for all adhesive particles, but gradually transfer to another branch for nonadhesive particles. Such adhesion-induced size-density and size-topology relations are interpreted theoretically with a modified geometrical ""granocentric"" model, where the model parameters are dependent on a single dimensionless adhesion number. Our findings, together with the modified theory, provide a more unified perspective on the substantial geometry of amorphous polydisperse systems, especially those with fairly loose structures.",Model of anomalous diffusion-absorption process in a system consisting of two different media separated by a thin membrane.,https://www.ncbi.nlm.nih.gov/pubmed/30934262,Physical review. E,2019 04 05,"We present the model of a diffusion-absorption process in a system which consists of two media separated by a thin partially permeable membrane. The kind of diffusion as well as the parameters of the process may be different in both media. Based on a simple model of a particle's random walk in a membrane system we derive the Green's functions, then we find the boundary conditions at the membrane. One of the boundary conditions is rather complicated and takes a relatively simple form in terms of the Laplace transform. Assuming that particles diffuse independently of one another, the obtained boundary conditions can be used to solve differential or differential-integral equations describing the processes in multilayered systems for any initial condition. We consider normal diffusion, subdiffusion, and slow subdiffusion processes, and we also suggest how superdiffusion could be included in this model. The presented method provides the functions in terms of the Laplace transform and some useful methods of calculation of the inverse Laplace transform are shown.",Lattice Boltzmann simulation of free surface flow impact on a structure.,https://www.ncbi.nlm.nih.gov/pubmed/30934261,Physical review. E,2019 04 05,"Liquid impact on a rigid wall is a common feature in the context of marine structures, as most of them are exposed continuously to breaking waves. In the present paper, a comparison and analysis of the impact load estimates obtained from free surface lattice Boltzmann (LB) simulation with the experimental measurements from available literature have been reported. Initially, two-dimensional simulation of the dam break impact on the wall is performed with two different LB models: BGK-F1: a Bhatnagar-Gross-Krook (BGK) collision operator with the force scheme of Buick and Greated [Phys. Rev. E 61, 5307 (2000)1063-651X10.1103/PhysRevE.61.5307], and MRT-F2: a multiple relaxation time (MRT) operator with the force scheme of Guo et al. [Phys. Rev. E 65, 046308 (2002)1063-651X10.1103/PhysRevE.65.046308]. The pressure estimates obtained from BGK-F1 over MRT-F2 are closer to the measurements, though the other key parameters, such as the waterfront evolution and the free surface profile, have not shown significant variations. Furthermore, the three-dimensional dam break simulation has been performed using BGK-F1 for three test cases: (i) impact on a wall, (ii) impact on a rectangular obstacle, and (iii) impact on a tall tower. In all the test cases, the load estimates are in agreement with the experimental measurements.",Hyperuniformity of generalized random organization models.,https://www.ncbi.nlm.nih.gov/pubmed/30934260,Physical review. E,2019 04 05,"Studies of random organization models of monodisperse (i.e., identical) spherical particles have shown that a hyperuniform state is achievable when the system goes through an absorbing phase transition to a critical state. Here we investigate to what extent hyperuniformity is preserved when the model is generalized to particles with a size distribution and/or nonspherical shapes. We begin by examining binary disks in two dimensions and demonstrate that their critical states are hyperuniform as two-phase media, but not hyperuniform nor multihyperuniform as point patterns formed by the particle centroids. We further confirm the generality of our findings by studying particles with a continuous size distribution. Finally, to study the effect of rotational degrees of freedom, we extend our model to noncircular particles, namely, hard rectangles with various aspect ratios, including the hard-needle limit. Although these systems exhibit only short-range orientational order, hyperuniformity is still preserved. Our analysis reveals that the redistribution of the ""mass"" of the particles rather than the particle centroids is central to this dynamical process. The consideration of the ""active volume fraction"" of generalized random organization models may help to resolve which universality class they belong to and hence may lead to a deeper theoretical understanding of absorbing-state models. Our results suggest that general particle systems subject to random organization can be a robust way to fabricate a wide class of hyperuniform states of matter by tuning the structures via different particle-size and -shape distributions. This in turn potentially enables the creation of multifunctional hyperuniform materials with desirable optical, transport, and mechanical properties.",Gyrokinetic Landau collision operator in conservative form.,https://www.ncbi.nlm.nih.gov/pubmed/30934259,Physical review. E,2019 04 05,"A gyrokinetic linearized exact (not model) Landau collision operator is derived by transforming the symmetric and conservative Landau form. The formulation obtains the velocity-space flux density and preserves the operator's conservative form as the divergence of this flux density. The operator contains both test-particle and field-particle contributions, and finite Larmor radius effects are evaluated in either Bessel function series or gyrophase integrals. While equivalent to the gyrokinetic Fokker-Planck form with Rosenbluth potentials [B. Li and D. R. Ernst, Phys. Rev. Lett. 106, 195002 (2011)10.1103/PhysRevLett.106.195002], the gyrokinetic conservative Landau form explicitly preserves the symmetry between test-particle and field-particle contributions, which underlies the conservation laws and the H theorem, and enables discretization with a finite-volume or spectral method to preserve the conservation properties numerically, independent of resolution. The form of the exact linearized field-particle terms differs from those of widely used model operators. We show the finite Larmor radius corrections to the field-particle terms in the exact linearized operator involve Bessel functions of all orders, while present model field-particle terms involve only the first two Bessel functions. This new symmetric and conservative formulation enables the gyrokinetic exact linearized Landau operator to be implemented in gyrokinetic turbulence codes for comparison with present model operators using similar numerical methods.",Persistent spatial patterns of interacting contagions.,https://www.ncbi.nlm.nih.gov/pubmed/30934258,Physical review. E,2019 04 05,"The spread of infectious diseases, rumors, fashions, and innovations are complex contagion processes, embedded in network and spatial contexts. While the studies in the former context are intensively expanded, the latter remains largely unexplored. In this paper, we investigate the pattern formation of an interacting contagion, where two infections, A and B, interact with each other and diffuse simultaneously in space. The contagion process for each follows the classical susceptible-infected-susceptible kinetics, and their interaction introduces a potential change in the secondary infection propensity compared to the baseline reproduction number R_{0}. We show that the nontrivial spatial infection patterns arise when the susceptible individuals move faster than the infected and the interaction between the two infections is neither too competitive nor too cooperative. Interestingly, the system exhibits pattern hysteresis phenomena, i.e., quite different parameter regions for patterns exist in the direction of increasing or decreasing R_{0}. Decreasing R_{0} reveals remarkable enhancement in contagion prevalence, meaning that the eradication becomes difficult compared to the single-infection or coinfection without space. Linearization analysis supports our observations, and we have identified the required elements and dynamical mechanism, which suggests that these patterns are essentially Turing patterns. Our work thus reveals new complexities in interacting contagions and paves the way for further investigation because of its relevance to both biological and social contexts.",Fluid flow through packings of elastic shells.,https://www.ncbi.nlm.nih.gov/pubmed/30934257,Physical review. E,2019 06 10,"Fluid transport in porous materials is commonly studied in geological samples (soil, sediments, etc.) or idealized systems, but the fluid flow through compacted granular materials, consisting of substantially strained granules, remains relatively unexplored. As a step toward filling this gap, we study a model of liquid transport in packings of deformable elastic shells using finite-element and lattice-Boltzmann methods. We find that the fluid flow abruptly vanishes as the porosity of the material falls below a critical value, and the flow obstruction exhibits features of a percolation transition. We further show that the fluid flow can be captured by a simplified permeability model in which the complex porous material is replaced by a collection of disordered capillaries, which are distributed and shaped by the percolation transition. To that end, we numerically explore the divergence of hydraulic tortuosity τ_{H} and the decrease of a hydraulic radius R_{h} as the percolation threshold is approached. We interpret our results in terms of scaling predictions derived from the percolation theory applied to random packings of spheres.",Hyperuniformity order metric of Barlow packings.,https://www.ncbi.nlm.nih.gov/pubmed/30934256,Physical review. E,2019 04 05,"The concept of hyperuniformity has been a useful tool in the study of density fluctuations at large length scales in systems ranging across the natural and mathematical sciences. One can rank a large class of hyperuniform systems by their ability to suppress long-range density fluctuations through the use of a hyperuniformity order metric Λ[over ¯]. We apply this order metric to the Barlow packings, which are the infinitely degenerate densest packings of identical rigid spheres that are distinguished by their stacking geometries and include the commonly known fcc lattice and hcp crystal. The ""stealthy stacking"" theorem implies that these packings are all stealthy hyperuniform, a strong type of hyperuniformity, which involves the suppression of scattering up to a wave vector K. We describe the geometry of three classes of Barlow packings, two disordered classes and small-period packings. In addition, we compute a lower bound on K for all Barlow packings. We compute Λ[over ¯] for the aforementioned three classes of Barlow packings and find that, to a very good approximation, it is linear in the fraction of fcc-like clusters, taking values between those of least-ordered hcp and most-ordered fcc. This implies that the value of Λ[over ¯] of all Barlow packings is primarily controlled by the local cluster geometry. These results highlight the special nature of anisotropic stacking disorder, which provides impetus for future research on the development of anisotropic order metrics and hyperuniformity properties.",Some physical features of the Burr-type-XII distribution.,https://www.ncbi.nlm.nih.gov/pubmed/30934255,Physical review.

The above is shown following a variant to the procedure presented in the formulation of BCS, which consists of the incorporation of an expanded Boltzmann factor through the Mittag-Leffler function. On the other hand, maximization of Shannon-Boltzmann-Gibbs entropy and other generalized forms of entropy show that the Burr-type-XII distribution may emerge as the least informative distribution for the mentioned systems."

E,2019 04 05,"We consider a possibility to realize self-accelerating motion of interacting states with effective positive and negative masses in the form of pairs of solitons in two-component BEC loaded in an optical-lattice (OL) potential. A crucial role is played by the fact that gap solitons may feature a negative dynamical mass, keeping their mobility in the OL. First, the respective system of coupled Gross-Pitaevskii equations (GPE) is reduced to a system of equations for envelopes of the lattice wave functions. Two generic dynamical regimes are revealed by simulations of the reduced system, viz., shuttle oscillations of pairs of solitons with positive and negative masses, and splitting of the pair. The coaccelerating motion of the interacting solitons, which keeps constant separation between them, occurs at the boundary between the shuttle motion and splitting. The position of the coacceleration regime in the system's parameter space can be adjusted with the help of an additional gravity potential, which induces its own acceleration, that may offset the relative acceleration of the two solitons, while gravity masses of both solitons remain positive. The numerical findings are accurately reproduced by a variational approximation. Collisions between shuttling or coaccelerating soliton pairs do not alter the character of the dynamical regime. Finally, regimes of the shuttle motion, coacceleration, and splitting are corroborated by simulations of the original GPE system, with the explicitly present OL potential.",Infinite family of universal profiles for heat current statistics in Fourier's law.,https://www.ncbi.nlm.nih.gov/pubmed/30934242,Physical review.

E,2019 04 05,"The second law of thermodynamics requires the overall thermal current to flow from hot to cold. However, it does not forbid a local thermal current from flowing from cold to hot. By coupling a harmonic system of three masses connected by a few springs to two Langevin reservoirs at different temperatures, a local atypical thermal current is found to flow from cold to hot in the steady state while the overall thermal current is still from hot to cold. The direction of the local thermal current can be tuned by the mass, spring constant, and system-reservoir coupling. The local thermal current can vanish if the parameters are tuned to proper values. We also consider nonlinear effect from the system-substrate coupling and find that the local atypical thermal current survives in the presence of the nonlinear potential. Moreover, the local atypical thermal current is robust against asymmetry of the system-reservoir coupling, inhomogeneity of the nonlinear potential, and additions of more masses and springs. In molecular or nanomechanical systems where the setup may find its realization, the direction of the local thermal current may be controlled by mechanical or electromagnetic means, which may lead to applications in information storage.",Quantum heat distribution in thermal relaxation processes.,https://www.ncbi.nlm.nih.gov/pubmed/30934239,Physical review. E,2019 04 05,"We analyze the heat exchange distribution of open quantum systems undergoing a thermal relaxation process with a time-dependent effective temperature. We show that such processes arise, for example, if the dynamics maximizes the entropy production. Using a two-point measurement scheme, we find an expression for the heat moment generating function that depends solely on the system's partition function and on the thermalization function (i.e., the law of cooling) describing the effective temperature. Applications include the relaxation of free bosonic and fermionic modes, for which closed-form expressions for the time-dependent heat distribution function are derived. Multiple free modes with arbitrary dispersion relations are also briefly discussed. In the semiclassical limit our formula agrees with previous results of the literature for the heat distribution of an optically trapped nanoscopic particle far from equilibrium.",Void distributions reveal structural link between jammed packings and protein cores.,https://www.ncbi.nlm.nih.gov/pubmed/30934238,Physical review. E,2019 04 29,"Dense packing of hydrophobic residues in the cores of globular proteins determines their stability. Recently, we have shown that protein cores possess packing fraction ϕ≈0.56, which is the same as dense, random packing of amino-acid-shaped particles. In this article, we compare the structural properties of protein cores and jammed packings of amino-acid-shaped particles in much greater depth by measuring their local and connected void regions. We find that the distributions of surface Voronoi cell volumes and local porosities obey similar statistics in both systems. We also measure the probability that accessible, connected void regions percolate as a function of the size of a spherical probe particle and show that both systems possess the same critical probe size. We measure the critical exponent τ that characterizes the size distribution of connected void clusters at the onset of percolation. We find that the cluster size statistics are similar for void percolation in packings of amino-acid-shaped particles and randomly placed spheres, but different from that for void percolation in jammed sphere packings. We propose that the connected void regions are a defining structural feature of proteins and can be used to differentiate experimentally observed proteins from decoy structures that are generated using computational protein design software. This work emphasizes that jammed packings of amino-acid-shaped particles can serve as structural and mechanical analogs of protein cores, and could therefore be useful in modeling the response of protein cores to cavity-expanding and -reducing mutations.",Alternation of phases of regular and irregular dynamics in protein folding.,https://www.ncbi.nlm.nih.gov/pubmed/30934237,Physical review. E,2019 04 29,"The regularity of the dynamics in different phases of protein folding is investigated for a set of proteins which undergo a cooperative, two-state folding transition. To determine the degree of regularity of the dynamics, the fractal dimension of probability fluxes is calculated on the basis of simulated folding trajectories. It has been found that the phases of regular and irregular dynamics alternate as follows. In the initial (collapse) phase of folding, the dynamics are essentially regular. Then, as the protein comes to the basin of semicompact states that precedes the transition state, the dynamics become irregular. At the transition state, the dynamics are regularized again but become less regular when the nativelike states are explored. Depending on the specific conditions at which the protein folding was considered, some phases of the dynamics could not be well resolved, but no significant deviation from this general picture has been observed. The regularization of the dynamics at the transition state is discussed in relation to the recent studies of the Hamiltonian dynamics of small clusters, where both regular and chaotic dynamics were observed depending on the flatness of the energy surface at the transition state.","Promoting rotation, friction, and mixed lubrication for particles rolling on microstructured surfaces.",https://www.ncbi.nlm.nih.gov/pubmed/30934236,Physical review. E,2019 04 05,"We investigate how the aspect ratio of micropillar or microwell arrays patterned on a surface affects the rolling and slipping motion of spheres under flooded conditions at low Reynolds numbers. We study arrays of rigid microstructures with aspect ratios varying over two orders of magnitude for surface coverages ranging from 0.04 to 0.96. We investigate how the surface features (dimensions, surface coverage, and geometry) individually impact the motion of the sphere. We find that increasing microstructure height results in higher rotational velocities on all studied surfaces. We then model the motion of the spheres using two physical parameters: an effective separation and a coefficient of friction between the sphere and the incline. We find that a simple superposition of resistance functions, previously shown to accurately predict the motion of spheres for different surface coverages and geometries, indeed shows good agreement with experimental outcomes for all microstructure heights studied. We also perform separate sliding friction measurements via a force microscope to measure the coefficient of friction between the sphere and incline, under identically flooded conditions. A comparison of the sliding friction measurements at different Hersey numbers suggests that the effect of the microstructure on the coefficient of friction becomes more important as the Hersey number increases.",Equilibration of quasi-integrable systems.,https://www.ncbi.nlm.nih.gov/pubmed/30934235,Physical review. E,2019 04 05,"We study the slow relaxation of isolated quasi-integrable systems, focusing on the classical problem of Fermi-Pasta-Ulam-Tsingou (FPU) chain. It is well known that the initial energy sharing between different linear modes can be inferred by the integrable Toda chain. Using numerical simulations, we show explicitly how the relaxation of the FPU chain toward equilibration is determined by a slow drift within the space of Toda's integrals of motion. We analyze the whole spectrum of Toda modes and show how they dictate, via a generalized Gibbs ensemble, the quasistatic states along the FPU evolution. This picture is employed to devise a fast numerical integration, which can be generalized to other quasi-integrable models. In addition, we discuss how a fluctuation theorem, recently derived in Goldfriend and Kurchan [Europhys. Lett. 124, 10002 (2018)10.1209/0295-5075/124/10002], describes the large deviations as the system flows in the entropy landscape.",Coarsening dynamics in the Swift-Hohenberg equation with an external field.,https://www.ncbi.nlm.nih.gov/pubmed/30934234,Physical review. E,2019 04 05,"We study the Swift-Hohenberg equation (SHE) in the presence of an external field. The application of the field leads to a phase diagram with three phases, i.e., stripe, hexagon, and uniform. We focus on coarsening after a quench from the uniform to stripe or hexagon regions. For stripe patterns, we find that the length scale associated with the order-parameter structure factor has the same growth exponent (≃1/4) as for the SHE with zero field. The growth process is slower in the case of hexagonal patterns, with the effective growth exponent varying between 1/6 and 1/9, depending on the quench parameters. For deep quenches in the hexagonal phase, the growth process stops at late stages when defect boundaries become pinned."

E,2019 04 05,"Flow and director fields strongly couple with each other in liquid crystalline systems, and herein we discuss the coupling effect in cylindrical and spherical-cap droplets formed by nematic liquid crystal. Applying a temperature gradient to droplets dispersed in a liquid solvent, we observed a crosslike texture in the droplets moved toward the high-temperature side, indicating that the director field was deformed from equilibrium. Additionally, measurement of the flow field revealed that a convective flow was induced in the droplets under temperature gradient. These results suggested that the director deformation in the droplet was induced by convection. By designing a simplified model based on this, we theoretically analyzed the above phenomenon based on Onsager's variational principle. The results show that the phenomenon was well described by a balance of surface energy gradient with viscous and elastic forces.",Custom flow in overdamped Brownian dynamics.,https://www.ncbi.nlm.nih.gov/pubmed/30934221,Physical review. E,2019 04 05,"When an external field drives a colloidal system out of equilibrium, the ensuing colloidal response can be very complex, and obtaining a detailed physical understanding often requires case-by-case considerations. To facilitate systematic analysis, here we present a general iterative scheme for the determination of the unique external force field that yields prescribed inhomogeneous stationary or time-dependent flow in an overdamped Brownian many-body system. The computer simulation method is based on the exact one-body force balance equation and allows to specifically tailor both gradient and rotational velocity contributions, as well as to freely control the one-body density distribution. Hence, compressibility of the flow field can be fully adjusted. The practical convergence to a unique external force field demonstrates the existence of a functional map from both velocity and density to external force field, as predicted by the power functional variational framework. In equilibrium, the method allows to find the conservative force field that generates a prescribed target density profile, and hence implements the Mermin-Evans classical density functional map from density distribution to external potential. The conceptual tools developed here enable one to gain detailed physical insight into complex flow behaviour, as we demonstrate in prototypical situations.",Fluctuation-induced free energy of thin peptide films.,https://www.ncbi.nlm.nih.gov/pubmed/30934220,Physical review. E,2019 04 29,"We apply the Lifshitz theory of dispersion forces to find a contribution to the free energy of peptide films that is caused by the zero-point and thermal fluctuations of the electromagnetic field. For this purpose, using available information about the imaginary parts of the dielectric permittivity of peptides, an analytic representation for permittivity of a typical peptide along the imaginary frequency axis is devised. Numerical computations of the fluctuation-induced free energy are performed at room temperature for freestanding peptide films containing different fractions of water, and for similar films deposited on dielectric (SiO_{2}) and metallic (Au) substrates. It is shown that the free energy of a freestanding peptide film is negative and thus contributes to its stability. The magnitude of the free energy increases with increasing fraction of water and decreases with increasing thickness of a film. For peptide films deposited on a dielectric substrate, the free energy is nonmonotonous. It is negative for films thicker than 100nm, reaches the maximum value at some film thickness, but vanishes and changes its sign for films thinner than 100nm. The fluctuation-induced free energy of peptide films deposited on metallic substrate is found to be positive, which makes films less stable. In all three cases, simple analytic expressions for the free energy of sufficiently thick films are found. The obtained results may be useful to attain film stability in the next generation of organic microdevices with further reduced dimensions.",Rotational motion of a camphor disk in a circular region.,https://www.ncbi.nlm.nih.gov/pubmed/30934219,Physical review. E,2019 04 05,"In a two-dimensional axisymmetric system, the system symmetry allows rotational or oscillatory motion as stable stationary motion for a symmetric self-propelled particle. In the present paper, we studied the motion of a camphor disk confined in a two-dimensional circular region. By reducing the mathematical model describing the dynamics of the motion of a camphor disk and the concentration field of camphor molecules on a water surface, we analyzed the reduced equations around a bifurcation point where the rest state at the center of the system becomes unstable. As a result, we found that rotational motion is stably realized through the double-Hopf bifurcation from the rest state. The theoretical results were confirmed by numerical calculation and corresponded well to the experimental results.",Spin-reorientation critical dynamics in the two-dimensional XY model with a domain wall.,https://www.ncbi.nlm.nih.gov/pubmed/30934218,Physical review. E,2019 04 05,"In recent years, static and dynamic properties of non-180^{∘} domain walls in magnetic materials have attracted a great deal of interest. In this paper, spin-reorientation critical dynamics in the two-dimensional XY model is investigated with Monte Carlo simulations and theoretical analyses based on the Langevin equation. At the Kosterlitz-Thouless phase transition, the dynamic scaling behaviors of the magnetization and the two-time correlation function are carefully analyzed, and critical exponents are accurately determined. When the initial value of the angle between adjacent domains is slightly lower than π, a critical exponent is introduced to characterize the abnormal power-law increase of the magnetization in the horizontal direction inside the domain interface, which is measured to be ψ=0.0568(8). In addition, the relation ψ=η/2z is analytically deduced from the Langevin dynamics in the long-wavelength approximation, well consistent with numerical results.",Optofluidic control of the dispersion of nanoscale dumbbells.,https://www.ncbi.nlm.nih.gov/pubmed/30934217,Physical review.

We show that flexible nanoscale dumbbells (created by attaching two such gold particles by means of a polymer chain) in the same field display different types of motion depending on the chain length and field intensity. We have not disregarded the secondary optical forces due to light scattering. The dumbbells may disperse, rotate, or remain trapped. For some values of the parameters, the (enhanced) dispersion possesses a displacement distribution with exponential tails, making the motion anomalous, though Brownian.",N-break states in a chain of nonlinear oscillators.,https://www.ncbi.nlm.nih.gov/pubmed/30934216,Physical review. E,2019 04 05,"In the present work we explore a prestretched oscillator chain where the nodes interact via a pairwise Lennard-Jones potential. In addition to a homogeneous solution, we identify solutions with one or more (so-called) ""breaks,"" i.e., jumps. As a function of the canonical parameter of the system, namely, the precompression strain d, we find that the most fundamental one-break solution changes stability when the monotonicity of the Hamiltonian changes with d. We provide a proof for this (motivated by numerical computations) observation. This critical point separates stable and unstable segments of the one-break branch of solutions. We find similar branches for two- through five-break branches of solutions. Each of these higher ""excited state"" solutions possesses an additional unstable pair of eigenvalues. We thus conjecture that k-break solutions will possess at least k-1 (and at most k) pairs of unstable eigenvalues. Our stability analysis is corroborated by direct numerical computations of the evolutionary dynamics.",Scaling laws for harmonically trapped two-species mixtures at thermal equilibrium.,https://www.ncbi.nlm.nih.gov/pubmed/30934215,Physical review. E,2019 04 05,"We discuss the scaling of the interaction energy with particle numbers for a harmonically trapped two-species mixture at thermal equilibrium experiencing interactions of arbitrary strength and range. In the limit of long-range interactions and weak coupling, we recover known results for the integrable Caldeira-Leggett model in the classical limit. In the case of short-range interactions and for a balanced mixture, numerical simulations show scaling laws with exponents that depend on the interaction strength, its attractive or repulsive nature, and the dimensionality of the system. Simple analytic considerations based on equilibrium statistical mechanics and small interspecies coupling quantitatively recover the numerical results. The dependence of the scaling on interaction strength helps to identify a threshold between two distinct regimes. Our thermalization model covers both local and extended interactions, allowing for interpolation between different systems such as fully ionized gases and neutral atoms, as well as parameters describing integrable and chaotic dynamics.",Effect of network clustering on mutually cooperative coinfections.,https://www.ncbi.nlm.nih.gov/pubmed/30934214,Physical review. E,2019 04 29,"The spread of an infectious disease can be promoted by previous infections with other pathogens. This cooperative effect can give rise to violent outbreaks, reflecting the presence of an abrupt epidemic transition. As for other diffusive dynamics, the topology of the interaction pattern of the host population plays a crucial role. It was conjectured that a discontinuous transition arises when there are relatively few short loops and many long loops in the contact network. Here we focus on the role of local clustering in determining the nature of the transition. We consider two mutually cooperative pathogens diffusing in the same population: An individual already infected with one disease has an increased probability of getting infected by the other. We look at how a disease obeying the susceptible-infected-removed dynamics spreads on contact networks with tunable clustering. Using numerical simulations we show that for large cooperativity the epidemic transition is always abrupt, with the discontinuity decreasing as clustering is increased. For large clustering strong finite-size effects are present and the discontinuous nature of the transition is manifest only in large networks. We also investigate the problem of influential spreaders for cooperative infections, revealing that both cooperativity and clustering strongly enhance the dependence of the spreading influence on the degree of the initial seed.",Growth kinetics of the two-dimensional Ising model with finite cooling rates.,https://www.ncbi.nlm.nih.gov/pubmed/30934213,Physical review. E,2019 04 05,"We investigate, via spin-flip kinetic Monte Carlo simulations, the entire growth kinetic process of the two-dimensional kinetic Ising model cooled to zero temperature with finite cooling rates. A new slow dynamics, suppressed, and unseen in the instantaneous quench emerges and eventually crosses over to the asymptotic standard coarsening behavior. We present a numerical observation of the excess defect number density that provides direct information on the generated defects due to the critical slowing down. We find that the excess defect density reveals the dynamics of defect generation, which is shown to be in good agreement with the scaling theory pioneered by Kibble and Zurek (KZ). The dynamic spin correlation function reveals that the impulse regime alluded by KZ is characterized by a unique critical coarsening process with the growth law dictated by the Kibble-Zurek mechanism. We determine a new dynamic exponent governing the growth kinetics at the onset times of the zero temperature. The proposed scaling scheme for the excess defect density leads to an analytic expression for this dynamic exponent involving the KZ exponents, indicating the extended influence of the KZ mechanism even down to the kinetics at the onset times of zero temperature. We also perform dynamic simulations of critical heating with finite rates from zero temperature where the power law relaxation (with respect to the inverse cooling rates) of the magnetization can be explained clearly by the KZ exponent."

Each patient was evaluated with a detailed medical history, 12-lead resting electrocardiogram, Doppler echocardiography, and molecular genetic analysis. Results: Forty-eight of the children (83%) had a delay to diagnosis (0.7 (0.1, 2.0)years) and initially received a misdiagnosis. QT prolongation of unknown origin was found in 10 cases (17%), complex arrhythmic conditions in 27 cases (47%), myocarditis in 3 cases (5%), syncope of unknown origin in 3 cases (5%), epilepsy in 2 cases (3%), myocardial infarction in 1 case (2%), cardiomyopathy in 1 case (2%), and vasovagal syncope in 1 case (2%). Nine children presented with the positive family history of LQTS and three children had congenital nervous deafness. Twenty-one (36%) children presented with recurrent syncope, and 14 cases of whom had symptoms during physical activity and/or emotional stress. The common arrhythmias were ventricular arrhythmia (26 cases), sinus node dysfunction (18 cases), atrioventricular block (AVB) (12 cases), and atrial arrhythmia (6 cases).

Eighteen children (55%) were asymptomatic, thirteen children (39%) reported infrequent syncope, and one case (2%) died. Conclusions: LQTS in children is potentially malignant and present as phenotypic diversity and complex arrhythmias. LQTS-related pathogenic or possibly pathogenic mutations are identified in most of the children. Beta-blockers therapy is effective in reducing the risk of malignant cardiac events. Some children with LQTS should receive PM or ICD therapy.",[Influence of family integrated care on the intestinal microbiome of preterm infants in the neonatal intensive care unit].,https://www.ncbi.nlm.nih.gov/pubmed/30934198,Zhonghua er ke za zhi = Chinese journal of pediatrics,2019 04 25,"Objective: To investigate the influence of family integrated care (FICare) on the intestinal microbiome of preterm infants in neonatal intensive care unit (NICU).

A total of 44 preterm infants (23 boys, 52%) admitted to NICU of the Third Xiangya Hospital of Central South University from July, 2015 to June, 2017 were enrolled and divided into FICare, non-FICare groups. Totally 20 term infants (11 boys, 55%) were enrolled into control group, who were sent to the Pediatric Healthcare Clinic for regular health check on postnatal 28-31 days. All infants were free from probiotics after birth and on full enteral feeding. Clinical data of all infants were collected. Two fresh stool specimens of infants in FICare group were collected after 2 weeks of FICare implementation, without use of antibiotics during the prior 1 week. Stool specimens of infants in non-FICare group were collected at the meantime;while for the infants in control group, stool samples were collected at 4 weeks of age. All specimens were stored in-80 ℃ freezer, subsequently investigated by 16 S rRNA sequencing. The results were filtered by paired-end reads software based on RNA overlapping-splicing and tags calculation. Operational taxonomic units (OTU) were analyzed for intestinal microbiome richness. Intestinal microbiome diversity was measured with Shannon index. One-way ANOVA or Kruskal-Wallis H statistic analysis or Chi-square test was used for statistical analysis. Results: There were no significant differences among FICare, non-FICare and control groups in male proportion (52% (11/21) vs. 52% (12/23) vs. 55% (11/20), χ(2)=0.041, P=0.980), in-born ratio (90% (19/21) vs. 87% (20/23) vs. 85% (17/20), χ(2)=0.000, P=1.000), and percentage of infants with Apgar scores<7 at 5 minutes after birth (14% (3/21) vs. 9% (2/23) vs. 5% (1/20), χ(2)=0.120, P=0.729). Similarly, no significant differences were found between FICare and non-FICare groups in terms of gestational age ((29.7±1.8) vs. (29.9±1.7) weeks, t=0.378, P=0.707), birth weight ((1 266±310) vs. (1 326±318) g, t=0.631, P=0.531), median age of initiating feeds (4 vs. 4 days old, Z=0.666, P=0.505), and median age of achieving feeding volume of 120 ml/(kg·d)(13 vs. 11 days old, Z=1.014, P=0.310). However, the breast-feeding rate in FICare group (18/21, 86%) was significantly higher than that in non-FICare group (8/23, 35%) (t=11.780, P=0.001). The medium Shannon index was 0.72 (0.27,2.66), 0.61 (0.18,1.83), and 0.52 (0.08,1.71) in control, FICare, and non-FICare groups, respectively, without significant difference (H=1.823, P=0.402). The domain flora was Lactobacillus Firmicutes in all three groups, which was of the highest percentage in FICare group (71.6±5.4)%, followed by control group (65.4±6.6)% and non-FICare group (55.6±8.8)%, with a significant difference (F=27.919, P=0.000). Conclusions: FICare can improve the richness and diversity of intestinal microbiome, stimulate the establishment of flora close to those of normal breast-feeding infants in preemies in NICU, making its establishment being more similar to normal term breast-feeding infants. This effect might be caused by the increased skin-to-skin contact and increased fresh breast-milk-feeding in FICare.",[Incidence and risk factors of severe intraventricular hemorrhage in very low and extremely low birth weight infants: a multi-center study].,https://www.ncbi.nlm.nih.gov/pubmed/30934197,Zhonghua er ke za zhi = Chinese journal of pediatrics,2019 04 25,"Objective: To investigate the incidence and risk factors of severe intraventricular hemorrhage (IVH) in very low birth weight infants (VLBWI) and extremely low birth weight infants (ELBWI).

Conclusions: The incidence of severe IVH is still significantly high among VLBWI and ELBWI. Low gestation age, non-cesarean delivery, Apgar score ≤3 at 5 minutes, use of invasive mechanical ventilation and inotropic medications within the first week of life will increase the risk of severe IVH.",[Expert consensus on the diagnosis and management of neonatal sepsis (version 2019)].,https://www.ncbi.nlm.nih.gov/pubmed/30934196,Zhonghua er ke za zhi = Chinese journal of pediatrics,2019 05 06,,[Guideline for the clinical application of nasal intermittent positive pressure ventilation in premature infants (version 2019)].,https://www.ncbi.nlm.nih.gov/pubmed/30934195,Zhonghua er ke za zhi = Chinese journal of pediatrics,2019 05 06,,"Phytochemical, antioxidant and antimicrobial properties of Litsea angulata extracts.",https://www.ncbi.nlm.nih.gov/pubmed/30774930,F1000Research,2019 05 22,"Background:Litsea angulata is a plant species belonging to Lauraceae family that is distributed throughout Indonesia, Malaysia, and New Guinea. The seeds have been traditionally used by local people in Kalimantan, Indonesia for the treatment of boils; however, there is no information about the potency of its branch, bark and leaves yet. This study aimed to determine the antioxidant, antimicrobial activity as well as the phytochemical constituent of Litsea angulata branch, bark, and leaves. Methods: Extraction was performed by successive maceration method using n-hexane, ethyl acetate, and ethanol solvent. Antioxidant activity was evaluated by DPPH radical scavenging assay. The antimicrobial activity using the 96 well-plate microdilution broth method against Staphylococcus aureus and Streptococcus mutans. Results: Based on the phytochemical analysis, it showed that extract of L. angulata contains alkaloids, flavonoids, tannins, terpenoids, and coumarin. The results showed that all extracts of plant samples displayed the ability to inhibit DPPH free radical formation and all tested microorganisms. Conclusions:L. angulata contains secondary metabolites such as alkaloids, flavonoids, tannins, terpenoids, carotenoids, and coumarin.

Article 12 of the UN Convention on the Rights of Persons with Disabilities (CRPD) is concerned with how legal systems themselves enable and disable people as legal actors. In the view of the UN Committee on the Rights of Persons with Disabilities (‘CRPD Committee’) and many of those involved in negotiating article 12, it introduces a new paradigm of ‘universal legal capacity’, that cannot be limited on grounds of disability or mental incapacity. The CRPD Committee maintains that this requires the abolition of all forms of substitute decision making. This interpretation of article 12 is contested in the literature, but for many involved in the disability movement, ending guardianship and other forms of substitute decision making is central to wider advocacy goals of ending institutionalisation, forced treatment, and loss of fundamental citizenship rights such as the ability to vote, marry and own property."," Care in the Cage: Materializing Moral Economies of Animal Care in the Biomedical Sciences, c.1945-",https://www.ncbi.nlm.nih.gov/pubmed/30933457,,2019 05 22,"This chapter adopts a historical perspective to explore how material infrastructures have structured human–animal relationships within the biomedical “animal house,” c.1945 to the present.

Many skin-stretching devices that use gradual traction have been applied to take advantage of the viscoelastic properties of the skin. A 21-year-old female patient was seen with a burn defect on her occipital scalp leading to exposed subcutaneous tissue after chemical application of hair coloring in a salon. The dimensions of the wound were 10 cm×5 cm, and a skin graft or flap would have been necessary to close the defect. Two long transfixing K-wires (1.4 mm) and paired 3-wire threads (23 gauge), which are readily available in most hospitals, were applied over a period of 12 days for trichophytic closure of the defect. The remaining scalp scars after primary trichophytic closure with this skin-stretching method were refined with hair follicle transplantation. This skin-stretching method is simple to apply and valuable for helping to close problematic areas of skin shortage that would otherwise require more complicated procedures.

This paper examines the effect of birth endowment over time by employing a long panel of individuals born in 1983 in Cebu (Philippines) that includes relevant information on the pregnancy. We build a refined health endowment measure netted out from prenatal investments. We find that initial endowments affect trajectories both through the human capital production function and subsequent parental investment. The effect of birth endowment remains until adulthood and the fading out is very limited for health outcomes but more pronounced for educational outcomes. We also find that parents tend to reinforce initial health endowments, but the effect of this behaviour has almost no effect on final outcomes.",Determinants of fractional exhaled nitric oxide in healthy men and women from the European Community Respiratory Health Survey III.,https://www.ncbi.nlm.nih.gov/pubmed/30934155,Clinical and experimental allergy : journal of the British Society for Allergy and Clinical Immunology,2019 04 15,"The fractional exhaled nitric oxide (FE NO) is a marker for type 2 inflammation used in diagnostics and management of asthma.

The purpose of this study was to investigate the effects of LPS on the accumulation of lipid droplets (LDs), proliferation, and steroidogenesis in goat luteinized granulosa cells (LGCs). GCs isolated from the ovarian follicles were spontaneously luteinized under media with fetal bovine serum, resulting in increased progesterone and shifted shape from spherical to star with multiple prolongations. Then, LGCs were treated with LPS (0-10 μg/mL) for 0-48 hours. Oil Red O staining was performed to observe LDs accumulation and commercial kit was applied to detect intracellular triglyceride (TG) content. The cell proliferation were detected by cell counting kit-8. Expressions of cell-cycle-related genes were determined by real-time polymerase chain reaction. Estradiol (E 2 ) and progesterone (P 4 ) from cell supernatants were determined by enzyme-linked immunosorbent assay, and expressions of STAR, P450scc, 3β-hydroxysteroid dehydrogenase (3β-HSD) and CYP19A1 were detected by Western blot. Results showed that LPS treatment significantly increased LDs accumulation after 24 hours, and 5 μg/mL LPS increased TG content ( P < 0.05). LPS treatment for 24 hours stimulated the LGCs activities ( P<0.05), which was confirmed by the increases in the expressions of proliferating cell nuclear antigen (PCNA), cyclinB1 and cyclinD1, while 48 hours treatment had no effect. LPS treatment suppressed E 2 and P 4 output of LGCs ( P < 0.05). Western blot results showed that 10 μg/mL LPS decreased the protein expression of 3β-HSD in LGCs ( P < 0.05). In conclusion, LPS increased LDs accumulation and cell proliferation, and LPS-mediated P 4 reduction could be attributed to the decreased 3β-HSD protein expression, which provide new information for the regulation of ovarian function in goats.",Adenomatous polyposis coli as a predictor of environmental chemical-induced transgenerational effects related to male infertility.,https://www.ncbi.nlm.nih.gov/pubmed/30934153,Journal of biochemical and molecular toxicology,2019 04 01,"Exposure to toxic environmental chemicals during pregnancy is a ubiquitous threat to health with potentially transgenerational consequences.

Cell viability, cytotoxicity, lipid peroxidation, hydroxyl radical, hydrogen peroxide, antioxidant enzymes (superoxide dismutase, catalase, glutathione peroxidase, and glutathione-S-transferase) and expression levels of antioxidant genes (superoxide dismutase, catalase, and glutathione peroxidase) were measured in embryonic fibroblast cells. Results demonstrated that sodium arsenite directly affects antioxidant enzymes and genes in 3T3 embryonic fibroblast cells and induces oxidative damage by increasing the amount of hydrogen peroxide, hydroxyl radical, and lipid peroxidation in the cell. Furthermore, the study indicated that Cur might be a potential ameliorative antioxidant to protect the fibroblast cell toxicity induced by sodium arsenite."

In week 8, blood samples were taken, and at the end of the trial, all pigs were euthanized to collect digesta and mesenteric lymphoid tissue. Apparent total tract digestibility (ATTD) of P was greater (p < 0.05) for pigs fed the CaP+ and CFP diets than CaP- and CSB diets. The myo-inositol 1,2,3,4,5,6-hexakis (dihydrogen phosphate) (InsP6 ) concentration in jejunal digesta was higher (p < 0.05) for CaP+ than in CaP- fed pigs. In addition, caecal and faecal InsP5 isomer concentration were greater (p < 0.05) for CSB than CFP diets. In the caecum, gene copy numbers of saccharolytic bacteria, such as Eubacterium rectale and Roseburia spp., as well as SCFA concentration were higher (p < 0.05) for CaP+ than CaP- diets. In particular, innate immune cell numbers, such as natural killer cells, dendritic cells, monocytes and neutrophils, were greater (p < 0.05) for CaP+ than CaP- fed pigs. Diets high in CaP resulted in higher abundance of potential beneficial bacteria and might promote the first line of defence enhancing the activation of the cellular adaptive immune response, thereby possibly decreasing the risk for intestinal disturbances. These results strongly suggest that both, CaP supply and dietary ingredients differing in fermentability, may beneficially affect gut health through increase in SCFA-producing bacteria and/or bacteria with anti-inflammatory properties.",Evaluation of the potential predictors of embolism in patients with left atrial myxoma.,https://www.ncbi.nlm.nih.gov/pubmed/30934139,"Echocardiography (Mount Kisco, N.Y.)",2019 05 07,"Cardiac myxomas are the most common primary intracardiac tumors.

As a result, the crystals of an asymmetric diarylethene show much more drastic photosalient effects than those of the corresponding symmetric diarylethene crystals upon UV irradiation. It is also found that the crystals of diarylethene, which have not previously been reported to exhibit a photosalient effect, show photosalient phenomena upon irradiation with strong UV light.

Remarkably, under the same synthetic conditions, the zinc ions are respectively coordinated by oxalic acid (OX) and 1,2,4,5-tetrakis(imidazol-1-ylmethyl)benzene (TIMB) linkers to form two significantly different frameworks: anionic [Zn2 (OX)3 ]2- and cationic [Zn(TIMB)]2+ networks that interweave with each other to give an unprecedented interpenetrating structure with two differently-bonded open-frameworks. From the inorganic chemistry perspective, it is extremely difficult to control to which metal center the oxygen-donor linkers or/and nitrogen-donor ligands bind. A mixed Co/Zn analogue was also obtained by a similar method. The single-crystal XRD and EDS analyses indicate that the octahedral Zn ions of the anionic framework are replaced by cobalt cations, whereas the Zn ions in the tetrahedral positions of the cationic networks remain intact. This leads to the formation of the interpenetrating analogue with a mixed metal composition.

In the present study we measured total Hg (THg), methylmercury (MeHg) and selenium (Se) in muscle tissue and otolith samples from 12 species of fish collected at reference sites and sites influenced by power plant wastewater. Muscle tissue concentrations of Se were sensitive to recent wastewater exposure magnitude, stream type, trophic level, and species (P < 0.001). For Hg, concentrations in tissue and otoliths were affected only by trophic level and species. Levels of THg and Se, in muscle and otolith samples,were positively correlated for those species with a robust sample size. Some individual fish from three species (channel catfish, hybrid striped bass, freshwater drum) showed significantly increasing or decreasing lifetime concentrations of either THg or Se in otolith samples. Multiple regression analysis indicated that, for bluegill, muscle Se concentrations could be best explained using water concentrations of Se, sulfate, and molybdenum (r2 = 0.87; P < 0.001). Due to the increased cost and specialized sample processing requirements of analyzing trace elements in otolith structures, it may be prudent to limit these analyses to those species where insights into temporal trends are sought or where evidence indicates that fish move into, or out of, contaminated water bodies.

However, as natural aquifers are highly heterogeneous with unknown spatial details, reactive transport predictions on the aquifer scale require a stochastic framework for uncertainty analysis. The high computational demand of spatially explicit reactive-transport models hampers such analysis, thus motivating the search for simplified estimation tools. We suggest performing an electron balance between the reactants in the infiltrating solution and in the aquifer matrix to obtain the hypothetical time of dissolved-reactant breakthrough at a receptor if the reaction with the matrix was instantaneous. This time we denote as the advective breakthrough time for instantaneous reaction (τinst ). It depends on the amount of the reaction partner present in the matrix, the mass flux of the dissolved reactant, and the stoichiometry. While the shape of the reactive-species breakthrough curve depends on various kinetic parameters, the overall timing scales with τinst . We calculate the latter by particle tracking. The effort of computing τinst is so low that stochastic calculations become feasible. We apply the concept to a two-dimensional test case of aerobic respiration and denitrification. A detailed spatially explicit reactive-transport model includes microbial dynamics. Scaling the time of local breakthrough curves observed at individual points by τinst decreased the variability of electron-donor breakthrough curves significantly. We conclude that the advective breakthrough time for instantaneous reaction is efficient in estimating the time over which an aquifer retains its degradation potential.",The association between platelet transfusions and mortality in patients with critical illness.,https://www.ncbi.nlm.nih.gov/pubmed/30934133,Transfusion,2019 06 04,Platelet (PLT) transfusions are frequently administered in the setting of critical illness but their clinical impacts remain unknown.

Different molecular tagging technologies have been developed to enable each individual step of protein production, from expression through purification and characterization. Monitoring the entire production process requires multiple tags or molecular interactions, because no individual tag has provided the comprehensive breadth of utility. An ideal molecular tag is small and does not interrupt expression, solubility, folding or function of the protein being purified and can be used throughout the production process. We adapted and integrated a split-luciferase system (NanoBiT®, Promega ®) to perform the range of techniques essential to protein production. We developed a simple method to monitor protein expression in real time to optimize expression conditions. We constructed a novel affinity chromatography system using the split-luciferase system to enable purification. We adapted western blot analysis, enzyme-linked immunosorbent assay, and cell-based bioassay to characterize the expressed proteins. Our results demonstrate that a single-tag can fulfill all aspects needed throughout protein production.","Improvement of the acid resistance, catalytic efficiency, and thermostability of nattokinase by multisite-directed mutagenesis.",https://www.ncbi.nlm.nih.gov/pubmed/30934114,Biotechnology and bioengineering,2019 05 27,"Nattokinase (NK) is a serine protease of the subtilisin family; as a potent fibrinolytic enzyme, it is potentially useful for thrombosis therapy. For NK to be applied as an oral medicine for the treatment of cardiovascular diseases, it must overcome the extremely acidic environments of the gastrointestinal tract despite its limited acidic stability. In this study, three strategies were adopted to improve the acid resistance of NK: (a) Surface charge engineering, (b) sequence alignment, and (c) mutation based on the literature. Eleven variants were constructed and four single-point mutations were screened out for their distinctive catalytic properties: Q59E increased the specific activity; S78T improved the acid stability; Y217K enhanced the acid and thermal stabilities; and N218D improved the thermostability. Based on these observations, multipoint variants were constructed and characterized, and one variant with better acid stability, catalytic efficiency, and thermostability was obtained. Molecular dynamics simulation was carried out to clarify the molecular mechanism of the increased stability of S78T and Y217K mutants under acidic conditions. This study explored effective strategies to engineer acid resistance of NK; moreover, the NK variants with better catalytic properties found in this study have potential applications for the medical industry.",Enhancing 5-aminolevulinic acid tolerance and production by engineering the antioxidant defense system of Escherichia coli.,https://www.ncbi.nlm.nih.gov/pubmed/30934113,Biotechnology and bioengineering,2019 04 17,"5-Aminolevulinic acid (ALA) is a value-added compound with potential applications in the fields of agriculture and medicine. Although massive efforts have recently been devoted to building microbial producers of ALA through metabolic engineering, few studies focused on the cellular response and tolerance to ALA. In this study, we demonstrated that ALA caused severe cell damage and morphology change of Escherichia coli via generating reactive oxygen species (ROS), which were further determined to be mainly hydrogen peroxide and superoxide anion radical. ALA treatment activated the native antioxidant defense system by upregulating catalase (CAT) and superoxide dismutase (SOD) expression to combat ROS. Further overexpressing CAT (encoded by katG and katE) and SOD (encoded by sodA, sodB, and sodC) not only improved ALA tolerance but also its production level. Notably, coexpression of katE and sodB in an ALA synthase expressing strain enhanced the biomass and final ALA titer by 81% and 117% (11.5 g/L) in a 5 L bioreactor, respectively. This study demonstrates the importance of tolerance engineering in strain development.

However, the implementation and application of EST for regulatory embryotoxicity screening are impeded by its technical complexity, long testing period, and limited endpoint data. In this study, a high throughput embryotoxicity screening based on mouse embryonic stem cells (mESCs) expressing enhanced green fluorescent protein (EGFP) driven by a human survivin promoter and a human cytomegalovirus promoter, respectively, was developed. These EGFP expressing mESCs were cultured in three-dimensional (3D) fibrous scaffolds in microbioreactors on a multiwell plate with EGFP fluorescence signals as cell responses to chemicals monitored noninvasively in a high throughput manner. Nine chemicals with known developmental toxicity were used to validate the survivin-based embryotoxicity assay, which showed that strongly embryotoxic compounds such as 5-fluorouracil, retinoic acid, and methotrexate downregulated survivin expression by more than 50% in 3 days, while weakly embryotoxic compounds such as boric acid, methoxyacetic acid, and tetracyclin showed modest downregulation effect and nonembryotoxic saccharin, penicillin G, and acrylamide had negligible downregulation effect on survivin expression, confirming that survivin can be used as a molecular endpoint for high throughput screening of embryotoxicants.

The goal is to ensure the quality of the final product. Currently, chromatographic processes in biopharmaceutical production are predominantly monitored with UV/Vis absorbance and a direct correlation with purity and quantity is limited. In this study, a chromatographic workstation was equipped with additional online sensors, such as multi-angle light scattering, refractive index, attenuated total reflection Fourier-transform infrared, and fluorescence spectroscopy. Models to predict quantity, host cell proteins (HCP), and double-stranded DNA (dsDNA) content simultaneously were developed and exemplified by a cation exchange capture step for fibroblast growth factor 2 expressed in Escherichia coliOnline data and corresponding offline data for product quantity and co-eluting impurities, such as dsDNA and HCP, were analyzed using boosted structured additive regression. Different sensor combinations were used to achieve the best prediction performance for each quality attribute. Quantity can be adequately predicted by applying a small predictor set of the typical chromatographic workstation sensor signals with a test error of 0.85 mg/ml (range in training data: 0.1-28 mg/ml). For HCP and dsDNA additional fluorescence and/or attenuated total reflection Fourier-transform infrared spectral information was important to achieve prediction errors of 200 (2-6579 ppm) and 340 ppm (8-3773 ppm), respectively.",Effect of gene copy number and chaperone coexpression on recombinant hydrophobin HFBI biosurfactant production in Pichia pastoris.,https://www.ncbi.nlm.nih.gov/pubmed/30934110,Biotechnology and bioengineering,2019 04 16,"Hydrophobins are small highly surface-active fungal proteins with potential as biosurfactants in a wide array of applications. However, practical implementation of hydrophobins at large scale has been hindered by low recombinant yields. In this study, the effects of increasing hydrophobin gene copy number and overexpressing endoplasmic reticulum resident chaperone proteins Kar2p, Pdi1p, and Ero1p were explored as a means to enhance recombinant yields of the class II hydrophobin HFBI in the eukaryotic expression host Pichia pastoris. One-, 2-, and 3-copy-HFBI strains were attained using an in vitro multimer ligation approach, with strains displaying copy number stability following subsequent transformations as measured by quantitative polymerase chain reaction. Increasing HFBI copy number alone had no effect on increasing HFBI secretion, but increasing copy number in concert with chaperone overexpression synergistically increased HFBI secretion. Overexpression of PDI1 or ERO1 caused insignificant changes in HFBI secretion in 1- and 2-copy strains, but a statistically significant HFBI secretion increase in 3-copy strain. KAR2 overexpression consistently resulted in enhanced HFBI secretion in all copy number strains, with 3-copy-HFBI secreting 22±1.6 fold more than the 1-copy-HFBI/no chaperone strain. The highest increase was seen in 3-copy-HFBI/Ero1p overexpressing strain with 30±4.0 fold increase in HFBI secretion over 1-copy-HFBI/no chaperone strain.

Therefore, the ability to visualize ASGs specifically would allow the sequential analysis of donor cell behavior in the recipient gonads. Here we produced monoclonal antibodies that could recognize the cell surface antigens of ASGs in Pacific bluefin tuna (Thunnus orientalis), with the aim of visualizing live ASGs. We generated monoclonal antibodies by inoculating Pacific bluefin tuna testicular cells containing ASGs into mice and then screened them using cell-based enzyme-linked immunosorbent assay (ELISA), immunocytochemistry, flow cytometry (FCM), and immunohistochemistry, which resulted in the selection of two antibodies (Nos. 152 and 180) from a pool of 1152 antibodies. We directly labeled these antibodies with fluorescent dye, which allowed ASG-like cells to be visualized in a one-step procedure using immunocytochemistry. Molecular marker analyses against the FCM-sorted fluorescent cells confirmed that ASGs were highly enriched in the antibody-positive fraction. To evaluate the migratory capability of the ASGs, we transplanted visualized cells into the peritoneal cavity of nibe croaker (Nibea mitsukurii) larvae. This resulted in incorporated fluorescent cells labeled with antibody No. 152 being detected in the recipient gonads, suggesting that the visualized ASGs possessed migratory and incorporation capabilities.

Wide-angle X-ray scattering was applied to seven healthy ex-vivo human eyes. Each eye was dissected into an anterior and a posterior cup, and radial incisions were used to flatten the tissue before microstructure characterisation. A method was developed to use the microstructure data obtained for the dissected tissue to build realistic 3D maps of fibril density and orientation covering the whole eye globe. At the central cornea, 61.5±2.3% of fibrils were aligned within 45° sectors surrounding the two orthogonal directions. In contrast, more than one-third of the total fibril content was concentrated along the circumferential direction at the limbus (37.0±2.4%) and around the optic nerve head (34.8±2.1%). The insertion locations of the four recti muscles exhibited a preference in the meridional direction near the equator (38.6±3.9%). There was also a significant difference in fibril density between the limbus and other regions (ratio = 1.91±0.45, p <0.01 at the central cornea and ratio = 0.80±0.21, p <0.01 at the posterior pole). Characterisation of collagen fibril density and orientation across the whole ocular surface has been possible but required the use of a technique that involved tissue dissection and hence caused tissue damage.

Fungi adapt to fluctuations in their environment, coordinating development and metabolism accordingly. G-protein coupled receptors (GPCRs) communicate changes in the environment to intracellular G-proteins that direct the appropriate biological response, suggesting that fungal GPCR signalling may be key to virulence. Here we describe the expansion of non-classical GPCRs in the FHB causing pathogen, Fusarium graminearum, and show that class X receptors are highly expressed during wheat infection. We identify class X receptors that are required for FHB disease on wheat, and show that the absence of a GPCR can cause an enhanced host response that restricts the progression of infection. Specific receptor sub-domains are required for virulence. These non-classical receptors physically interact with intracellular G-proteins and are therefore bona fide GPCRs. Disrupting a class X receptor is shown to dysregulate the transcriptional coordination of virulence traits during infection. This amounts to enhanced wheat defensive responses, including chitinase and plant cell wall biosynthesis, resulting in apoplastic and vascular occlusions that impede infection. Our results show that GPCR signalling is important to FHB disease establishment.",Availability of specific tools to assess patient reported outcomes in hip arthroplasty in Spain.

We rigorously assessed the clinical relevance of promoter DNA methylation of Cysteine dioxygenase type 1 (CDO1) gene, a cancer-specific aberration, in human gastric cancer.",Mutational pathway maps and founder effects define the within-host spectrum of hepatitis C virus mutants resistant to drugs.,https://www.ncbi.nlm.nih.gov/pubmed/30934020,PLoS pathogens,2019 05 17,"Knowledge of the within-host frequencies of resistance-associated amino acid variants (RAVs) is important to the identification of optimal drug combinations for the treatment of hepatitis C virus (HCV) infection. Multiple RAVs may exist in infected individuals, often below detection limits, at any resistance locus, defining the diversity of accessible resistance pathways. We developed a multiscale mathematical model to estimate the pre-treatment frequencies of the entire spectrum of mutants at chosen loci. Using a codon-level description of amino acids, we performed stochastic simulations of intracellular dynamics with every possible nucleotide variant as the infecting strain and estimated the relative infectivity of each variant and the resulting distribution of variants produced. We employed these quantities in a deterministic multi-strain model of extracellular dynamics and estimated mutant frequencies. Our predictions captured database frequencies of the RAV R155K, resistant to NS3/4A protease inhibitors, presenting a successful test of our formalism. We found that mutational pathway maps, interconnecting all viable mutants, and strong founder effects determined the mutant spectrum. The spectra were vastly different for HCV genotypes 1a and 1b, underlying their differential responses to drugs. Using a fitness landscape determined recently, we estimated that 13 amino acid variants, encoded by 44 codons, exist at the residue 93 of the NS5A protein, illustrating the massive diversity of accessible resistance pathways at specific loci. Accounting for this diversity, which our model enables, would help optimize drug combinations. Our model may be applied to describe the within-host evolution of other flaviviruses and inform vaccine design strategies.",Interleukin-6 and lipoprotein-associated phospholipase A2 are associated with functional trajectories.,https://www.ncbi.nlm.nih.gov/pubmed/30934019,PloS one,2019 04 18,"Inflammatory biomarkers have been associated with stroke and mortality, but inflammation may also have detrimental effects beyond acute events.

Preventive and therapeutic strategies for such infections are greatly needed. In this study, sequence alignment analysis revealed that Outer membrane protein A (OmpA) was highly conserved among S. maltophilia strains but shared no significant similarity with human and mouse proteomes. In mice, intranasal immunization with S. maltophilia recombinant OmpA (rOmpA) without additional adjuvant induced sustained mucosal and systemic rOmpA-specific antibody responses. Treatment with rOmpA stimulated significantly higher levels of secretion of IFN-γ, IL-2, and IL-17A (All P<0.05) from the primary splenocytes isolated from rOmpA-immunized mice than from the primary splenocytes isolated from PBS-immunized mice. Furthermore, mice immunized with rOmpA showed significantly reduced bacterial burden in the lung and reduced levels of pro-inflammatory cytokines (TNF-α and IL-6) in bronchoalveolar lavage fluid (BALF) 24 hours after intranasal S. maltophilia infection, indicating that immunization with rOmpA may have protective effects against S. maltophilia challenge in mice. Our findings suggest that intranasal immunization with rOmpA may induce mucosal and systemic immune responses in mice, trigger Th1- and Th17-mediated cellular immune responses, and thus stimulate host immune defense against S. maltophilia infection. These results also demonstrate that intranasal vaccination may offer an alternative approach to current strategies since it induces a mucosal as well as a systemic immune response.",You don't have to be rich to save money: On the relationship between objective versus subjective financial situation and having savings.,https://www.ncbi.nlm.nih.gov/pubmed/30934007,PloS one,2019 04 18,"Saving is an important financial behavior that provides an individual with psychological security and boosts his/her overall sense of well-being. For this reason, scientists and practitioners have attempted to understand why some people save when others do not. One of the most common explanations for this phenomenon is that those individuals who earn more should be more willing to save their money. In line with this logic, people who have more money should be more likely to have savings. Considering the results of prior research, we expected objective financial situation (income) to be positively linked to having savings (i.e., propensity to have savings and the exact amount of savings). At the same time, however, we assumed that subjective financial situation (perception) should also be positively related to these variables. To test our assumptions, we conducted a nationwide representative survey (N = 1048) among Polish respondents, asking them about their objective and subjective financial situation. The results of a regression analysis showed that objective financial situation was indeed significantly positively related to having savings. However, subjective financial situation was also positively correlated with having savings (even when we controlled for objective financial situation and demographic variables). We discuss the implications of the links between objective versus subjective financial situations and having savings.","Reproductive differences among species, and between individuals and cohorts, in the leech genus Helobdella (Lophotrochozoa; Annelida; Clitellata; Hirudinida; Glossiphoniidae), with implications for reproductive resource allocation in hermaphrodites.",https://www.ncbi.nlm.nih.gov/pubmed/30934006,PloS one,2019 04 18,"Leeches and oligochaetes comprise a monophyletic group of annelids, the Clitellata, whose reproduction is characterized by simultaneous hermaphroditism. While most clitellate species reproduce by cross-fertilization, self-fertilization has been described within the speciose genus Helobdella. Here we document the reproductive life histories and reproductive capacities for three other Helobdella species. Under laboratory conditions, both H. robusta and H. octatestisaca exhibit uniparental reproduction, apparently reflecting self-fertility, and suggesting that this trait is ancestral for the genus. However, the third species, H. austinensis, seems incapable of reproduction by self-fertilization, so we inferred its reproductive life history by analyzing reproduction in breeding cohorts. Comparing the reproductive parameters for H. robusta reproducing in isolation and in cohorts revealed that reproduction in cohorts is dramatically delayed with respect to that of isolated individuals, and that cohorts of leeches coordinate their cocoon deposition in a manner that is not predicted from the reproductive parameters of individuals reproducing in isolation. Finally, our comparisons of reproductive capacity for individuals versus cohorts for H. robusta, and between different sizes of cohorts for H. austinensis, reveal differences in resource allocation between male and female reproductive roles that are consistent with evolutionary theory.",SLMAP3 isoform modulates cardiac gene expression and function.,https://www.ncbi.nlm.nih.gov/pubmed/30934005,PloS one,2019 04 18,"The sarcolemmal membrane associated proteins (SLMAPs) belong to the super family of tail anchored membrane proteins which serve diverse roles in biology including cell growth, protein trafficking and ion channel regulation. Mutations in human SLMAP have been linked to Brugada syndrome with putative deficits in trafficking of the sodium channel (Nav1.5) to the cell membrane resulting in aberrant electrical activity and heart function. Three main SLMAP isoforms (SLMAP1 (35 kDa), SLMAP2 (45 kDa), and SLMAP3 (91 kDa)) are expressed in myocardium but their precise role remains to be defined. Here we generated transgenic (Tg) mice with cardiac-specific expression of the SLMAP3 isoform during postnatal development which present with a significant decrease (20%) in fractional shortening and (11%) in cardiac output at 5 weeks of age. There was a lack of any notable cardiac remodeling (hypertrophy, fibrosis or fetal gene activation) in Tg hearts but the electrocardiogram indicated a significant increase (14%) in the PR interval and a decrease (43%) in the R amplitude. Western blot analysis indicated a selective and significant decrease (55%) in protein levels of Nav1.5 while 45% drop in its transcript levels were detectable by qRT-PCR. Significant decreases in the protein and transcript levels of the calcium transport system of the sarcoplasmic reticulum (SERCA2a/PLN) were also evident in Tg hearts. These data reveal a novel role for SLMAP3 in the selective regulation of important ion transport proteins at the level of gene expression and suggest that it may be a unique target in cardiovascular function and disease.",The treatment pattern and adherence to direct oral anticoagulants in patients with atrial fibrillation aged over 65.,https://www.ncbi.nlm.nih.gov/pubmed/30934004,PloS one,2019 04 18,"In this study, we aimed to assess the utilization pattern (potentially inappropriate dosing and concomitant use of contraindicated drugs) and adherence to direct oral anticoagulants (DOACs), including apixaban, dabigatran, and rivaroxaban, in patients with atrial fibrillation (AF) unsuitable for warfarin.",Investigation of somatic single nucleotide variations in human endogenous retrovirus elements and their potential association with cancer.,https://www.ncbi.nlm.nih.gov/pubmed/30934003,PloS one,2019 04 18,"Human endogenous retroviruses (HERVs) have been investigated for potential links with human cancer. However, the distribution of somatic nucleotide variations in HERV elements has not been explored in detail. This study aims to identify HERV elements with an over-representation of somatic mutations (hot spots) in cancer patients. Four HERV elements with mutation hotspots were identified that overlap with exons of four human protein coding genes. These hotspots were identified based on the significant over-representation (p<8.62e-4) of non-synonymous single-nucleotide variations (nsSNVs). These genes are TNN (HERV-9/LTR12), OR4K15 (HERV-IP10F/LTR10F), ZNF99 (HERV-W/HERV17/LTR17), and KIR2DL1 (MST/MaLR). In an effort to identify mutations that effect survival, all nsSNVs were further evaluated and it was found that kidney cancer patients with mutation C2270G in ZNF99 have a significantly lower survival rate (hazard ratio = 2.6) compared to those without it. Among HERV elements in the human non-protein coding regions, we found 788 HERVs with significantly elevated numbers of somatic single-nucleotide variations (SNVs) (p<1.60e-5). From this category the top three HERV elements with significantly over-represented SNVs are HERV-H/LTR7, HERV-9/LTR12 and HERV-L/MLT2. Majority of the SNVs in these 788 HERV elements are located in three DNA functional groups: long non-coding RNAs (lncRNAs) (60%), introns (22.2%) and transcriptional factor binding sites (TFBS) (14.8%). This study provides a list of mutational hotspots in HERVs, which could potentially be used as biomarkers and therapeutic targets.",Virulence gene profiles and phylogeny of Shiga toxin-positive Escherichia coli strains isolated from FDA regulated foods during 2010-2017.,https://www.ncbi.nlm.nih.gov/pubmed/30934002,PloS one,2019 04 18,"Illnesses caused by Shiga toxin-producing Escherichia coli (STECs) can be life threatening, such as hemolytic uremic syndrome (HUS). The STECs most frequently identified by USDA's Microbiological Data Program (MDP) carried toxin gene subtypes stx1a and/or stx2a. Here we described the genome sequences of 331 STECs isolated from foods regulated by the FDA 2010-2017, and determined their genomic identity, serotype, sequence type, virulence potential, and prevalence of antimicrobial resistance. Isolates were selected from the MDP archive, routine food testing by FDA field labs (ORA), and food testing by a contract company. Only 276 (83%) strains were confirmed as STECs by in silico analysis. Foods from which STECs were recovered included cilantro (6%), spinach (25%), lettuce (11%), and flour (9%). Phylogenetic analysis using core genome MLST revealed these STEC genomes were highly variable, with some clustering associated with ST types and serotypes. We detected 95 different sequence types (ST); several ST were previously associated with HUS: ST21 and ST29 (O26:H11), ST11 (O157:H7), ST33 (O91:H14), ST17 (O103:H2), and ST16 (O111:H-). in silico virulome analyses showed ~ 51% of these strains were potentially pathogenic [besides stx gene they also carried eae (25%) or 26% saa (26%)]. Virulence gene prevalence was also determined: stx1 only (19%); stx2 only (66%); and stx1/sxt2 (15%).

Fifty-nine men underwent a 3-week familiarization period followed by a 7-week training period. During familiarization, all participants trained four sessions of squats with a Smith machine, free weights and free weights standing on a wobble board. After week-3, participants were randomized into a low (Smith machine), medium (Free-weight) or high (Wobble board) stability RT program, and Control group. All participants were tested pre-, after week-3 and post-intervention. Ten repetition maximum (10RM), rate of force development (RFD), electromyography (EMG) and maximum voluntary isometric contraction (MVIC) were tested in all three squat conditions in addition to countermovement jump (CMJ) on stable and unstable surfaces, and muscle thickness. After familiarization, greater 10RM loads (21.8-27.3%), MVIC (7.4-13.5%), RFD (29.7-43.8%) and CMJ (4.9-8.5%) were observed in all conditions. Between week 3 and 10, the Free-weight and Wobble board groups similarly improved 10RM in all conditions. Smith machine group demonstrated greater improvement in the trained exercise than the medium and high stability exercises. All training groups showed similar improvement in muscle thickness, RFD and MVIC. There was no CMJ improvement on the stable surface, but the Wobble board group demonstrated significantly greater improvement on the unstable surface. In conclusion, low, medium or high stability RT resulted in similar improvements in trained and non-trained testing conditions except for greater CMJ on the unstable surface in the Wobble group. Greater 10RM strength in trained than non-trained exercise was only observed in low stability group. Familiarization was associated with substantial improvements in 10RM and CMJ, with greater improvement associated with higher stability requirements. These findings suggest that high stability can increase strength, muscle thickness and explosive measurements similar to training with lower stability.",Characterization of Listeria prophages in lysogenic isolates from foods and food processing environments.,https://www.ncbi.nlm.nih.gov/pubmed/30934000,PloS one,2019 04 18,"Prophages are commonly found in Listeria genomes, potentially enhancing survival or fitness of Listeria spp. Currently, there is still limited information on the distribution of prophages among Listeria isolates of different allelic types and from various sources. In this study, by using mitomycin C induction, prophages were found in 23/144 isolates (16.0%), including 13 L. monocytogenes and 10 Listeria spp. isolates, resulting in 28 and 11 induced phages, respectively. These prophage-carrying isolates (lysogens) were obtained from foods and food-related environments presenting 3 common allelic types (ATs) of L. monocytogenes (lineage I, II and IV), 4 ATs of L. innocua and 1 AT of L. welshimeri. The likelihood of prophage-carrying isolates of L. monocytogenes was 14.4 (95% CI: 4.9-35.4), and 18.5 (95% CI: 4.8-50.2) for Listeria spp. The 39 induced phages were classified into 3 lysis groups by the host range test against 9 major serotypes of L. monocytogenes and 5 species of Listeria. Most phages were host-specific with higher ability to lyse L. monocytogenes serotype 4 than other serotypes. The genome size of phages ranged from 35±2 kb to 50±2 kb and belonged to two common phage families, Myoviridae and Siphoviridae. Restriction analysis classified 19 selected phages into 16 restriction profiles, suggesting highly diverse prophages with at least 16 types. This may contribute to the variation in the genomes of Listeria. Information obtained here provides basic knowledge for further study to understand the overall role of prophages in Listeria, including roles in survival or fitness in foods and food processing environments.",Monopole antenna array design for 3 T and 7 T magnetic resonance imaging.,https://www.ncbi.nlm.nih.gov/pubmed/30933999,PloS one,2019 04 18,Ultra-high field magnetic resonance imaging poses a number of challenges for robust radio frequency coil designs.

A chapter in the series: How microbes ""jeopardize"" the modern synthesis.",https://www.ncbi.nlm.nih.gov/pubmed/30933985,PLoS genetics,2019 06 14,"Mutations drive evolution and were assumed to occur by chance: constantly, gradually, roughly uniformly in genomes, and without regard to environmental inputs, but this view is being revised by discoveries of molecular mechanisms of mutation in bacteria, now translated across the tree of life. These mechanisms reveal a picture of highly regulated mutagenesis, up-regulated temporally by stress responses and activated when cells/organisms are maladapted to their environments-when stressed-potentially accelerating adaptation. Mutation is also nonrandom in genomic space, with multiple simultaneous mutations falling in local clusters, which may allow concerted evolution-the multiple changes needed to adapt protein functions and protein machines encoded by linked genes. Molecular mechanisms of stress-inducible mutation change ideas about evolution and suggest different ways to model and address cancer development, infectious disease, and evolution generally.","A community-based knowledge, attitude, and practice survey on rabies among cattle owners in selected areas of Bhutan.",https://www.ncbi.nlm.nih.gov/pubmed/30933984,PLoS neglected tropical diseases,2019 05 05,"Rabies remains a disease of significant zoonotic and economic concern in rabies endemic areas of Bhutan. Rabies outbreaks in livestock threaten the livelihoods of subsistence farming communities and pose a potential public health threat. As a part of identifying approaches to prevent rabies in cattle, a Knowledge, Attitude, and Practice (KAP) survey was conducted among cattle owners in selected rural areas of the southern rabies high-risk zone and low-risk zone in eastern Bhutan. Between March and April 2017, 562 cattle owners (281 in the east and 281 in the south) were interviewed using a questionnaire. Eighty-eight percent of the participants had heard of rabies but only 39% of the participants who had heard of rabies had adequate knowledge about rabies. Multivariable logistic regression analysis showed that residing in the south [OR = 9.25 (95% CI: 6.01-14.53)] and having seen a rabies case [OR = 2.46 (95% CI: 1.6-3.82)] were significantly associated with having adequate knowledge about rabies. Based on our scoring criteria, 65% of the total participants who had heard of rabies had a favorable attitude towards rabies control and prevention programs. The participants residing in the east were two times more likely to have a favourable attitude than their counterparts in the south [OR = 2.08 (95% CI: 1.43-3.05)]. More than 70% of the participants reported engaging in farm activities such as examining the oral cavity of sick cattle and assisting cattle during parturition. Only 25% of the participants reported using personal protective equipment while undertaking these activities. Despite a high level of rabies awareness, we observed that there is a lack of comprehensive knowledge about rabies regarding susceptible hosts, transmission routes, the health outcome of rabies infection in humans, and appropriate health-seeking behaviours.

In the cardiovascular system, it is expressed by cardiac fibroblasts, endothelial cells, and at lower levels by ventricular cardiomyocytes. SPARC expression levels are increased upon myocardial injury and also during hypertrophy and fibrosis. We have previously shown that SPARC improves cardiac function after myocardial infarction by regulating post-synthetic procollagen processing, however whether SPARC directly affects cardiomyocyte contraction is still unknown. In this study we demonstrate a novel inotropic function for extracellular SPARC in the healthy heart as well as in the diseased state after myocarditis-induced cardiac dysfunction. We demonstrate SPARC presence on the cardiomyocyte membrane where it is co-localized with the integrin-beta1 and the integrin-linked kinase. Moreover, extracellular SPARC directly increases cardiomyocyte cell shortening ex vivo and cardiac function in vivo, both in healthy myocardium and during coxsackie virus-induced cardiac dysfunction. In conclusion, we demonstrate a novel inotropic function for SPARC in the heart, with a potential therapeutic application when myocyte contractile function is diminished such as that caused by a myocarditis-related cardiac injury.",Zebrafish Klf4 maintains the ionocyte progenitor population by regulating epidermal stem cell proliferation and lateral inhibition.,https://www.ncbi.nlm.nih.gov/pubmed/30933982,PLoS genetics,2019 05 09,"In the skin and gill epidermis of fish, ionocytes develop alongside keratinocytes and maintain body fluid ionic homeostasis that is essential for adaptation to environmental fluctuations. It is known that ionocyte progenitors in zebrafish embryos are specified from p63+ epidermal stem cells through a patterning process involving DeltaC (Dlc)-Notch-mediated lateral inhibition, which selects scattered dlc+ cells into the ionocyte progenitor fate. However, mechanisms by which the ionocyte progenitor population is modulated remain unclear. Krüppel-like factor 4 (Klf4) transcription factor was previously implicated in the terminal differentiation of mammalian skin epidermis and is known for its bifunctional regulation of cell proliferation in a tissue context-dependent manner. Here, we report novel roles for zebrafish Klf4 in the ventral ectoderm during embryonic skin development. We found that Klf4 was expressed in p63+ epidermal stem cells of the ventral ectoderm from 90% epiboly onward. Knockdown or knockout of klf4 expression reduced the proliferation rate of p63+ stem cells, resulting in decreased numbers of p63+ stem cells, dlc-p63+ keratinocyte progenitors and dlc+ p63+ ionocyte progenitor cells. These reductions subsequently led to diminished keratinocyte and ionocyte densities and resulted from upregulation of the well-known cell cycle regulators, p53 and cdkn1a/p21. Moreover, mutation analyses of the KLF motif in the dlc promoter, combined with VP16-klf4 or engrailed-klf4 mRNA overexpression analyses, showed that Klf4 can bind the dlc promoter and modulate lateral inhibition by directly repressing dlc expression. This idea was further supported by observing the lateral inhibition outcomes in klf4-overexpressing or knockdown embryos. Overall, our experiments delineate novel roles for zebrafish Klf4 in regulating the ionocyte progenitor population throughout early stem cell stage to initiation of terminal differentiation, which is dependent on Dlc-Notch-mediated lateral inhibition.",Blackflies in the ointment: O. volvulus vector biting can be significantly reduced by the skin-application of mineral oil during human landing catches.,https://www.ncbi.nlm.nih.gov/pubmed/30933979,PLoS neglected tropical diseases,2019 05 05,"Standard human landing catches (sHLCs) have historically been a key component of Onchocerca volvulus transmission monitoring, but expose health-workers to potentially hazardous vector bites.

A variety of single-stranded DNA-binding proteins (ssDBPs) and single-stranded RNA-binding proteins (ssRBPs) have evolved that bind ssDNA and ssRNA, respectively, with varying degree of affinities and specificities to form complexes. Structural studies of these complexes provide key insights into their recognition mechanism. However, computational modeling of the specific recognition process and to predict the structure of the complex is challenging, primarily due to the heterogeneity of their binding energy landscape and the greater flexibility of ssDNA or ssRNA compared with double-stranded nucleic acids. Consequently, considerably fewer computational studies have explored interactions between proteins and single-stranded nucleic acids compared with protein interactions with double-stranded nucleic acids. Here, we report a newly developed energy-based coarse-grained model to predict the structure of ssDNA-ssDBP and ssRNA-ssRBP complexes and to assess their sequence-specific interactions and stabilities. We tuned two factors that can modulate specific recognition: base-aromatic stacking strength and the flexibility of the single-stranded nucleic acid. The model was successfully applied to predict the binding conformations of 12 distinct ssDBP and ssRBP structures with their cognate ssDNA and ssRNA partners having various sequences. Estimated binding energies agreed well with the corresponding experimental binding affinities. Bound conformations from the simulation showed a funnel-shaped binding energy distribution where the native-like conformations corresponded to the energy minima. The various ssDNA-protein and ssRNA-protein complexes differed in the balance of electrostatic and aromatic energies. The lower affinity of the ssRNA-ssRBP complexes compared with the ssDNA-ssDBP complexes stems from lower flexibility of ssRNA compared to ssDNA, which results in higher rate constants for the dissociation of the complex (koff) for complexes involving the former.",Quantitative mapping of DNA phosphorothioatome reveals phosphorothioate heterogeneity of low modification frequency.,https://www.ncbi.nlm.nih.gov/pubmed/30933976,PLoS genetics,2019 05 08,"Phosphorothioate (PT) modifications of the DNA backbone, widespread in prokaryotes, are first identified in bacterial enteropathogens Escherichia coli B7A more than a decade ago. However, methods for high resolution mapping of PT modification level are still lacking. Here, we developed the PT-IC-seq technique, based on iodine-induced selective cleavage at PT sites and high-throughput next generation sequencing, as a mean to quantitatively characterizing the genomic landscape of PT modifications. Using PT-IC-seq we foud that most PT sites are partially modified at a lower PT frequency (< 5%) in E. coli B7A and Salmonella enterica serovar Cerro 87, and both show a heterogeneity pattern of PT modification similar to those of the typical methylation modification. Combining the iodine-induced cleavage and absolute quantification by droplet digital PCR, we developed the PT-IC-ddPCR technique to further measure the PT modification level. Consistent with the PT-IC-seq measurements, PT-IC-ddPCR analysis confirmed the lower PT frequency in E. coli B7A. Our study has demonstrated the heterogeneity of PT modification in the bacterial population and we also established general tools for rigorous mapping and characterization of PT modification events at whole genome level. We describe to our knowledge the first genome-wide quantitative characterization of PT landscape and provides appropriate strategies for further functional studies of PT modification."

Here, we describe a new factor mediating inflammatory pain. We show that platelet-derived growth factor (PDGF)-BB applied in vitro causes repetitive firing of dissociated nociceptor-like rat dorsal root ganglion neurons and decreased their threshold for action potential generation. Injection of PDGF-BB into the paw produced nocifensive behavior in rats and led to thermal and mechanical pain hypersensitivity. We further detailed the biophysical mechanisms of these PDGF-BB effects and show that PDGF receptor-induced inhibition of nociceptive M-current underlies PDGF-BB-mediated nociceptive hyperexcitability. Moreover, in vivo sequestration of PDGF or inhibition of the PDGF receptor attenuates acute formalin-induced inflammatory pain. Our discovery of a new pain-facilitating proinflammatory mediator, which by inhibiting M-current activates nociceptive neurons and thus contributes to inflammatory pain, improves our understanding of inflammatory pain pathophysiology and may have important clinical implications for pain treatment.",Targeting the CaVα-CaVβ interaction yields an antagonist of the N-type CaV2.2 channel with broad antinociceptive efficacy.,https://www.ncbi.nlm.nih.gov/pubmed/30933958,Pain,2019 04 01,"Inhibition of voltage-gated calcium (CaV) channels is a potential therapy for many neurological diseases including chronic pain. Neuronal CaV1/CaV2 channels are composed of α, β, γ and α2δ subunits. The β subunits of CaV channels are cytoplasmic proteins that increase the surface expression of the pore-forming α subunit of CaV. We targeted the high-affinity protein-protein interface of CaVβ's pocket within the CaVα subunit. Structure-based virtual screening of 50,000 small molecule library docked to the β subunit led to the identification of 2-(3,5-dimethylisoxazol-4-yl)-N-((4-((3-phenylpropyl)amino)quinazolin-2-yl)methyl)acetamide (IPPQ). This small molecule bound to CaVβ and inhibited its coupling with N-type voltage-gated calcium (CaV2.2) channels, leading to a reduction in CaV2.2 currents in rat dorsal root ganglion sensory neurons, decreased presynaptic localization of CaV2.2 in vivo, decreased frequency of spontaneous excitatory postsynaptic potentials and miniature excitatory postsynaptic potentials, and inhibited release of the nociceptive neurotransmitter calcitonin gene-related peptide from spinal cord. IPPQ did not target opioid receptors nor did it engage inhibitory G protein-coupled receptor signaling. IPPQ was antinociceptive in naive animals and reversed allodynia and hyperalgesia in models of acute (postsurgical) and neuropathic (spinal nerve ligation, chemotherapy- and gp120-induced peripheral neuropathy, and genome-edited neuropathy) pain. IPPQ did not cause akinesia or motor impairment, a common adverse effect of CaV2.2 targeting drugs, when injected into the brain.

In addition to the developmental level of the child, the type of pain he or she is experiencing should influence the team's approach when collaborating with the patient and the family to develop and refine pain management strategies. Understanding the categories of pain that may result from specific types of musculoskeletal injuries or orthopaedic surgeries influences the selection of medication or other most appropriate treatment. Although opioids are an important part of managing acute pain in the pediatric population, many other pharmacological and nonpharmacological therapies can be used in combination with or in place of opioids to optimize pain management.

Brachydactyly-mental retardation syndrome (BDMR) was suspected based on the phenotype; however, array CGH excluded a 2q37 deletion, but identified a deletion encompassing the SHOX gene. BDMR is characterized by cognitive impairment, skeletal abnormalities involving hands and feet, short stature, and overweight. Most affected individuals carry relatively large 2q37 deletions encompassing HDAC4. This gene encodes a histone deacetylase involved in epigenetic regulation of cell growth and differentiation, specifically during endochondral bone formation in chondrocyte hypertrophy. Since SHOX haploinsufficiency can cause skeletal defects and short stature but would not fully explain the clinical picture of this patient, exome sequencing was performed, and a heterozygous HDAC8 frameshift mutation was identified. HDAC8 is a distinct histone deacetylase involved in cohesin recycling and is responsible for an X-linked dominant Cornelia de Lange-like phenotype.

Traditionally this is done with reference type ion chambers calibrated in a beam quality Q 0 without magnetic field. To correct the ion chamber response for the application in the magnetic field, a factor needs to be applied that corrects for both beam quality Q and the presence of the magnetic field B, k Q,B. This can be expressed as the product of k Q, without magnetic field, and ion chamber magnetic field correction, k B. k B depends on the magnetic field strength and its direction, the direction of the beam and the orientation and type of the ion chamber. In this study, for the first time, both k Q and k B were measured directly for six waterproof ion chambers (3  ×  PTW 30013 and 3  ×  IBA FC65-G) in a pre-clinical 7 MV MRI-linac at 0 T and at 1.5 T. Measurements were done with the only available primary standard built for this purpose, a water calorimeter.

Condensed matter : an Institute of Physics journal,2019 05 09,"The non- and O-terminated diamond (1 1 1)-1  ×  1 surfaces, with the substitutional B (or N) dopants in different atomic layers, have been modelled in the present study. The influences of the O adsorbates, dopant and dopant position on the adsorption energy, have been studied by performing the density functional theory (DFT) calculations. Various parameters were additionally calculated in order to analyze the obtained results: bond lengths, total electron densities, bond populations, atomic charges, Fukui functions (FFs) and density-of-states. Dangling bonds on non-terminated surfaces, O adsorbates, as well as dopants within various atomic layers were all found to induce local effects. In fact, the degree of influences of the dopant on the adsorption energy of the O adsorbates, as well as on parameters like the near-surface bond lengths, total electron density, bond populations and atomic charges, were all found to be dependent on the dopant position. More generally, the deeper the dopant position, the less influence it had on the surface structures and properties. The influences by the dopant in the 1st or 2nd C atomic layer were observed to be significant, but those in the 3rd to 5th C layers were almost negligible. It was also found that the B dopant would decrease the adsorption energy of the adjacent O adsorbates, while the N dopant in the 2nd layer would increase it. Furthermore, the combination of the O adsorbates, together with the dopants within the 1st or 2nd C layer, could induce significant elongation of the bonds between neighboring atoms within the 1st and 2nd layers (i.e. C-C, C-B or C-N bonds). Moreover, all the terminating O atoms could react strongly with either the electrophilic or the nucleophilic species.",A study of inter-crystal scatter in dual-layer offset scintillator arrays for brain-dedicated PET scanners.,https://www.ncbi.nlm.nih.gov/pubmed/30933936,Physics in medicine and biology,2019 05 23,"A dual-layer offset (DLO) detector enables depth-of-interaction (DOI) through light sharing between two layers of scintillation arrays with a single-ended readout (SER) scheme. However, the SER scheme in DLO detectors may lead to a layer misassignment when inter-crystal scattering occurs. The aim of this work is to study inter-crystal scattering and evaluate the effects of layer misidentifications in DLO detectors on the performance of scanners suitable for a brain-dedicated PET insert. The influence of layer misidentification on the coincidence response functions (CRFs) of 3 different DLO detectors with total/front/back layer thicknesses of 15/6/9 mm, 20/8/12 mm, and 25/7.5/17.5 mm and a crystal width of about 3 mm was studied through Monte Carlo simulations. To overcome layer misidentification, we studied a practical DLO detector design in which each layer can be read out independently through a discrete-layer readout (DLR) scheme where light sharing between the layers is avoided. The CRFs of the mentioned DLO detectors assuming SER and DLR were analyzed. To evaluate the effects of layer misidentification on image quality, images of a Derenzo-like phantom were also reconstructed for all DLO and their equivalent single layer PET scanners. Our analysis showed that layer misassignments due to inter-crystal scatter in DLO detectors mainly has effect on the full-width at tenth maximum of the CRFs. According to the reconstructed images of the phantom, no significant improvements in the quality of the images were seen when SER was replaced with DLR. The results suggest that layer misidentification in DLO detectors does not play an important role in the quality of the PET images.","Charge, lattice and magnetism across the valence crossover in EuIr2Si2 single crystals.",https://www.ncbi.nlm.nih.gov/pubmed/30933934,Journal of physics. Condensed matter : an Institute of Physics journal,2019 06 04,"We present a detailed study of the temperature evolution of the crystal structure, specific heat, magnetic susceptibility and resistivity of single crystals of the paradigmatic valence-fluctuating compound [Formula: see text]. A comparison to stable-valent isostructural compounds [Formula: see text] (with Eu3+), and [Formula: see text], (with Eu2+) reveals an anomalously large thermal expansion indicative of the lattice softening associated to valence fluctuations. A marked broad peak at temperatures around 65-75 K is observed in specific heat, susceptibility and the derivative of resistivity, as thermal energy becomes large enough to excite Eu into a divalent state, which localizes one f electron and increases scattering of conduction electrons. In addition, the intermediate valence at low temperatures manifests in a moderately renormalized electron mass, with enhanced values of the Sommerfeld coefficient in the specific heat and a Fermi-liquid-like dependence of resistivity at low temperatures. The high residual magnetic susceptibility is mainly ascribed to a Van Vleck contribution.

The European roe deer (Careolus capreolus) pre-implantation embryo development is characterised by a 4-month period of reduced development, embryonic diapause, after which the embryo rapidly elongates and implants. We investigated the uterine fluid proteome by label-free liquid chromatography tandem mass spectrometry at four defined stages covering the phase of reduced developmental pace (early diapause, mid diapause, and late diapause) and embryo elongation. We hypothesised that embryo development during diapause is halted by the lack of signals that support progression past the blastocyst stage. Three clusters of differentially abundant proteins were identified by a self-organizing tree algorithm: 1) gradual reduction over development; 2) stable abundance during diapause, followed by a sharp rise at elongation; and 3) gradual increase over development. Proteins in the different clusters were subjected to Gene Ontology analysis. 'Cellular detoxification' in cluster 1 was represented by alcohol dehydrogenase, glutathione S-transferase, and peroxiredoxin-2. ATP-citrate synthase, nucleolin, lamin A/C, and purine phosphorylase as cell proliferation regulators were found in cluster 2, and 'cortical cytoskeleton', 'regulation of substrate adhesion-dependent cell spreading', and 'melanosome' were present in cluster 3. Cell cycle promoters were higher abundant at elongation than during diapause, and polyamines presence indicates their role in diapause regulation. This study provides a comprehensive overview of proteins in the roe deer uterine fluid during diapause, and forms a basis for studies aiming at understanding the impact of the lack of cell cycle promoters during diapause.",Effect of the Neuropeptide Phoenixin and Its Receptor GPR173 During Folliculogenesis.,https://www.ncbi.nlm.nih.gov/pubmed/30933929,"Reproduction (Cambridge, England)",2019 04 01,"Folliculogenesis is a complex process, defined by the growth and development of follicles from the primordial population. Granulosa cells (GCs) play a vital role in every stage of follicular growth through proliferation, acquisition of gonadotropic responsiveness, steroidogenesis, and production of autocrine/paracrine factors. A recently discovered hypothalamic neuropeptide phoenixin, is involved in the regulation of the reproductive system. Phoenixin acts through its receptor, G protein-coupled receptor 173 (GPR173), to activate the cAMP/PKA pathway leading to the phosphorylation of CREB (pCREB). Here, we demonstrated the expression patterns of phoenixin and GPR173 in human ovary and explored its role in folliculogenesis. Phoenixin and GPR173 were both expressed in the human ovarian follicle, with increased expression in GCs as the follicle grows. Phoenixin treatment at 100 nM for 24 h induced the proliferation of human non-luteinized granulosa cell line, HGrC1 and significantly increased the expression levels of CYP19A1, FSHR, LHR, and KITL, but decreased NPPC expression levels. These effects were suppressed by GPR173 siRNA. The expression level of CREB1, pCREB, and estradiol (E2) production in the culture medium was significantly enhanced by phoenixin treatment in a concentration-dependent manner. Phoenixin also significantly increased the follicular area in a murine ovarian tissue culture model, leading to an increased number of ovulated oocytes with a higher level of maturation. Taken together, our data demonstrate that phoenixin is an intraovarian factor that promotes follicular growth through its receptor GPR173 by accelerating proliferation of GCs, inducing E2 production, and increasing the expression of genes related to follicle development.",Persistent effects on bovine granulosa cell transcriptome after resolution of uterine disease.,https://www.ncbi.nlm.nih.gov/pubmed/30933928,"Reproduction (Cambridge, England)",2019 04 10,"Metritis is associated with reduced fertility in dairy cows, but the mechanisms are unclear because the disease resolves several weeks before insemination. One hypothesis is that metritis causes persistent changes in granulosa cells during follicle development, which might be evident in the transcriptome of granulosa cells from dominant follicles weeks after parturition. To test this hypothesis we collected follicular fluid and granulosa cells from dominant follicles 63 days post partum from cows previously diagnosed with metritis, at least 6 weeks after resolution of the disease, and from cows not diagnosed with metritis (control cows). Bacterial lipopolysaccharide was detected in follicular fluid, and concentrations were associated with follicular fluid IL-8 and glucose concentrations. Transcriptome analysis using RNAseq revealed 177 differentially expressed genes in granulosa cells collected from cows that had metritis compared with control cows. The most upregulated genes were ITLN1, NCF2, CLRN3, FSIP2 and ANKRD17, and the most downregulated genes were ACSM1, NR4A2, GHITM, CBARP and NR1I3. Pathway analysis indicated that the differentially expressed genes were involved with immune function, cell-cell communication, cell cycle and cellular metabolism. Predicted upstream regulators of the differentially expressed genes included NFκB, IL-21 and lipopolysaccharide, which are associated with infection and immunity. Our data provide evidence for a persistent effect of metritis on the transcriptome of granulosa cells in ovarian follicles after the resolution of disease."

Seeking to minimize surgical and perioperative morbidity, the authors adopted an endoscopic minimally invasive transforaminal lumbar interbody fusion (MIS-TLIF) technique performed without general anesthesia. In this report, they present data on the first 100 patients treated with this procedure.METHODSThe authors conducted a retrospective review of the first 100 patients who underwent awake endoscopic MIS-TLIF at a single institution between 2014 and 2017. Surgery was performed while the patient was sedated but without intubation or the use of general anesthetic or narcotic agents. Long-lasting (liposomal) bupivacaine was used for local analgesia. The discectomy and placement of an expandable interbody graft were performed endoscopically, followed by percutaneous pedicle screw implantation. Inclusion criteria for the procedure consisted of diagnosis of degenerative disc disease with grade I or II spondylolisthesis and evidence of spinal stenosis or nerve impingement with intractable symptomatology.RESULTSOf the first 100 patients, 56 were female and 44 were male. Single-level fusion was performed in 84 patients and two-level fusion in 16 patients. The most commonly fused level was L4-5, representing 77% of all fused levels. The mean (± standard deviation) operative time was 84.5 ± 21.7 minutes for one-level fusions and 128.1 ± 48.6 minutes for two-level procedures. The mean intraoperative blood loss was 65.4 ± 76.6 ml for one-level fusions and 74.7 ± 33.6 ml for two-level fusions. The mean length of hospital stay was 1.4 ± 1.0 days. Four deaths occurred in the 100 patients; all four of those patients died from complications unrelated to surgery. In 82% of the surviving patients, 1-year follow-up Oswestry Disability Index (ODI) data were available. The mean preoperative ODI score was 29.6 ± 15.3 and the mean postoperative ODI score was 17.2 ± 16.9, which represents a significant mean reduction in the ODI score of -12.3 using a two-tailed paired t-test (p = 0.000001). In four cases, the surgical plan was revised to include general endotracheal anesthesia intraoperatively and was successfully completed. Other complications included two cases of cage migration, one case of osteomyelitis, and one case of endplate fracture; three of these complications occurred in the first 50 cases.CONCLUSIONSThis series of the first 100 patients to undergo awake endoscopic MIS-TLIF demonstrates outcomes comparable to those reported in our earlier papers. This procedure can provide a safe and efficacious option for lumbar fusion with less morbidity than open surgery.

Multivariable logistic regression was implemented to analyze how OUD status impacted in-hospital complications, length of hospital stay, discharge disposition, and total charges by procedure type.RESULTSA total of 139,995 patients with LDD were identified, with 1280 patients (0.91%) also having a concurrent OUD diagnosis. Overall complication rates were higher in OUD patients (48.44% vs 31.01%, p < 0.0001). OUD patients had higher odds of pulmonary (p = 0.0006), infectious (p < 0.0001), and hematological (p = 0.0009) complications. Multivariate regression modeling of outcomes by procedure type showed that after ALIF, OUD patients had higher odds of nonhome discharge (p = 0.0007), extended hospitalization (p = 0.0002), and greater total charges (p = 0.0054). This analysis also revealed that OUD patients faced higher odds of complication (p = 0.0149 and p = 0.0471), extended hospitalization (p = 0.0439 and p = 0.0001), and higher total charges (p < 0.0001 and p < 0.0001) after PLIF and LLIF procedures, respectively.CONCLUSIONSObtaining a better understanding of the risks and outcomes that OUD patients face perioperatively is a necessary step toward developing more effective ERAS protocols for this vulnerable population. This study, which sought to characterize the outcome profiles for lumbar fusion procedures in OUD patients on a national level, found that this population tended to experience increased odds of complications, extended hospitalization, nonhome discharge, and higher total costs.

Patients were excluded if their physical status was classified as ASA class II-V or if they were younger than 18 years or older than 65.Groups were compared in terms of age, sex, body mass index (BMI), perioperative hemodynamics, operation time, intraoperative blood loss, intraoperative fluid administration, intraoperative opioid administration, time to first oral intake, time to first mobilization, postoperative nausea and vomiting (PONV), difference between preoperative and postoperative visual analog scale (VAS) scores, postoperative analgesic requirements, length of hospital stay, and cost of anesthesia.RESULTSThe ERAS and pre-ERAS groups were comparable with respect to age, sex, and BMI. Operation time, intraoperative blood loss, intraoperative opioid administration, and intraoperative fluid administration were all less in the ERAS group. First oral intake and first mobilization were earlier in the ERAS group. The incidence of PONV was less in the ERAS group. Postoperative analgesic requirements and postoperative VAS scores were significantly less in the ERAS group. The length of hospital stay was found to be shorter in the ERAS group. The ERAS approach was found to be cost-effective.CONCLUSIONSERAS had clinical and economic benefits and is associated with improved outcomes in lumbar microdiscectomy.",The evolution of surgical management for vertebral column tumors.,https://www.ncbi.nlm.nih.gov/pubmed/30933909,Journal of neurosurgery. Spine,2019 04 01,In BriefThere has been a significant shift in treatment paradigms for both primary and metastatic spine tumors over the last several decades. This article highlights some of the more important treatment advances that practitioners should be made aware of. It is important to not only incorporate these changes into individual practice but also appreciate the treatment trends that herald a significantly different future for spine tumor treatment.,Contemporary concepts of pain surgery.,https://www.ncbi.nlm.nih.gov/pubmed/30933905,Journal of neurosurgery,2019 04 01,"Pain surgery is one of the historic foundations of neurological surgery. The authors present a review of contemporary concepts in surgical pain management, with reference to past successes and failures, what has been learned as a subspecialty over the past 50 years, as well as a vision for current and future practice. This subspecialty confronts problems of cancer pain, nociceptive pain, and neuropathic pain. For noncancer pain, ablative procedures such as dorsal root entry zone lesions and rhizolysis for trigeminal neuralgia (TN) should continue to be practiced. Other procedures, such as medial thalamotomy, have not been proven effective and require continued study. Dorsal rhizotomy, dorsal root ganglionectomy, and neurotomy should probably be abandoned. For cancer pain, cordotomy is an important and underutilized method for pain control. Intrathecal opiate administration via an implantable system remains an important option for cancer pain management. While there are encouraging results in small case series, cingulotomy, hypophysectomy, and mesencephalotomy deserve further detailed analysis. Electrical neuromodulation is a rapidly changing discipline, and new methods such as high-frequency spinal cord stimulation (SCS), burst SCS, and dorsal root ganglion stimulation may or may not prove to be more effective than conventional SCS. Despite a history of failure, deep brain stimulation for pain may yet prove to be an effective therapy for specific pain conditions. Peripheral nerve stimulation for conditions such as occipital neuralgia and trigeminal neuropathic pain remains an option, although the quality of outcomes data is a challenge to these applications. Based on the evidence, motor cortex stimulation should be abandoned. TN is a mainstay of the surgical treatment of pain, particularly as new evidence and insights into TN emerge. Pain surgery will continue to build on this heritage, and restorative procedures will likely find a role in the armamentarium. The challenge for the future will be to acquire higher-level evidence to support the practice of surgical pain management.",Clinical experience using a dehydrated amnion/chorion membrane construct for the management of wounds.,https://www.ncbi.nlm.nih.gov/pubmed/30933904,Wounds : a compendium of clinical research and practice,2019 04 01,"Over time, acute and chronic, nonhealing wounds impose heavy financial and quality-of-life burdens on patients.

Then, a novel composite was synthesized via β-cyclodextrin (β-CD) functionalized GO-Fc by combining the advantages of GO-Fc and β-CD. An efficient chiral electrochemical sensing interface was constructed by using the rGO-Fc-CD composite as the electrode modification for the recognition of phenylalanine (Phe) enantiomers. The successful synthesis of the composites was confirmed by FTIR, XRD, TGA, SEM, and XPS results. The host-guest inclusion interaction was detected by ultraviolet spectroscopy and DPV. The recognition results demonstrated that the rGO-Fc-CD/GCE showed a higher chiral recognition capability for L-Phe than for D-Phe. The enantioselectivity coefficient (ID/IL) of the proposed sensor was 2.47. The LOD values of 27 nM and 52 nM (S/N = 3) for L-Phenylalanine and D-Phenylalanine were obtained for this electrochemical sensor. The as-synthesized material was successfully exploited for the recognition of Phe enantiomers, indicating that the developed sensor has wide application prospects.",Candida species in intact in vivo biofilm from carious lesions.,https://www.ncbi.nlm.nih.gov/pubmed/30933902,Archives of oral biology,2019 04 19,The aim of this study was to investigate the occurrence and spatial localization of Candida species in intact in vivo biofilm from caries lesions in root and occlusal surfaces.,Development of a closed-loop process for fusel alcohol production and nutrient recycling from microalgae biomass.,https://www.ncbi.nlm.nih.gov/pubmed/30933901,Bioresource technology,2019 04 14,"Improving the economic feasibility is necessary for algae-based processes to achieve commercial scales for biofuels and bioproducts production. A closed-loop system for fusel alcohol production from microalgae biomass with integrated nutrient recycling was developed, which enables the reuse of nitrogen and phosphorus for downstream application and thus reduces the operational requirement for external major nutrients. Mixed fusel alcohols, primarily isobutanol and isopentanol were produced from Microchloropsis salina hydrolysates by an engineered E. coli co-culture. During the process, cellular nitrogen from microalgae biomass was converted into ammonium, whereas cellular phosphorus was liberated by an osmotic shock treatment. The formation of struvite from the liberated ammonium and phosphate, and the subsequent utilization of struvite to support M. salina cultivation was demonstrated. The closed loop system established here should help overcome one of the identified economic barriers to scale-up of microalgae production, and enhance the sustainability of microalgae-based chemical commodities production."

Most patients are diagnosed at an advanced stage, thus making it essential to find novel curative targets for CCA. Metabolic reprogramming of the tumor cells includes metabolic abnormalities in glucose (known as the Warburg effect) and other substances such as amino acids and fats. Metabolic reprogramming produces anti-oxidant substances, reduces tumor oxidative stress, and finally promotes the proliferation of tumors. There is increasing evidence to imply that SIRT2, a histone deacetylase, and its downstream target cMYC, play metabolic regulatory roles in tumor cells. However, the role of the SIRT2/cMYC pathway in CCA is unclear. To assess the metabolic reprogramming function of the SIRT2/cMYC pathway in CCA and to determine the downstream targets as well as evaluate the therapeutic effect, the CCA RNA-Seq data were downloaded from the TCGA database. Differentially expressed genes were confirmed and KEGG pathway enrichment analysis was performed. Overall, 48 paired CCA samples were collected and subjected to immunohistochemical detection, and the clinical characteristics of participants were summarized. The CCA cells were suppressed or overexpressed with different downstream targets of SIRT2 and then subjected to apoptosis, immunoblotting, seahorse, and metabolites tracing analysis. In vivo experiments were also performed. We found that the SIRT2/cMYC pathway contributed to the proliferation of CCA cells and confirmed that the downstream target is PHDA1 and the serine synthesis pathway. The up-regulated SIRT2 and cMYC levels resulted in low levels of mitochondrial oxidative phosphorylation and increased conversion of glucose to serine and led to poor patient survival. The highly active SIRT2/cMYC pathway up-regulated the serine synthesis pathway pyruvate and increased antioxidant production, thus consequently protecting the CCA cells from oxidative stress-induced apoptosis. Our data revealed that the SIRT2/cMYC pathway plays a critical role in transforming glucose oxidative metabolism to serine anabolic metabolism, thus providing antioxidants for stress resistance. SIRT2/cMYC-induced metabolic reprogramming may represent a new therapeutic target for treating CCA.",Is marijuana use associated with lower inflammation?

With the availability of the first plant FT crystal structure from Pachysandra terminalis (PDB ID: 3UGH), computer-aided protein engineering of plant FT is now feasible. To obtain insights on the effect of specific mutations i.e. disulfide bridge introduction, wild-type and mutant FTs were subjected to a 15 μs Martini Coarse-grained Molecular Dynamics (CGMD) simulations at 303 K and 334 K. We report here the five mutants, M31C-Q49C, L144C-S193C, P34C-W300C, S219C-L226C and V470C-S498C with enhanced thermostabilities and/or activities relative to the wild type. Interestingly, M31C-Q49C, which is located within the catalytic-carrying blade of the catalytic domain, has an activity enhancement at both temperatures. At 334 K, three mutations, L144C-S193C, P34C-W300C and V470C-S498C, achieved thermostability relative to the wild type. Intriguingly, both activity and stability enhancement exhibited only at 334 K can be achieved provided that the mutation is located either on the catalytic-carrying residue blade of the catalytic domain or on the non-catalytic domain. Our results suggest that V470C-S498C and L144C-S193C are promising mutants and that domain-specific approach may be exploited to customize enzyme properties.",Revisiting aid dependency for HIV programs in Sub-Saharan Africa.,https://www.ncbi.nlm.nih.gov/pubmed/30933882,Public health,2019 06 07,"The overall increase in global domestic HIV expenditure obscures the specific performances of many sub-Saharan Africa (SSA) countries in local resourcing of their HIV programs.

An individual patient data and aggregate meta-analysis.,https://www.ncbi.nlm.nih.gov/pubmed/30933881,Sleep medicine reviews,2019 05 25,"Obstructive sleep apnea (OSA) has been linked to altered cardiovascular response to exercise. A systematic review and individual patient data (IPD) meta-analysis were conducted to assess whether OSA patients present reduced exercise capacity. PubMed, Embase and Web of Science were searched until September 2018. Studies which performed sleep recording in both OSA patients and controls and measured maximal oxygen consumption (VO2peak) via a maximal exercise test were included. IPD were provided for five trials upon the 18 eligible (N = 289) and a two-stage IPD meta-analysis model was used, allowing to standardize the apnea cutoff and adjust for confounders. IPD meta-analysis demonstrated that moderate to severe OSA patients had similar VO2peak (mean difference: -1.03 mL·kg-1 min-1; 95% CI: -3.82 to 1.76; p = 0.47) and cardiovascular response to exercise compared to mild or non-OSA patients. By contrast, aggregate data (AD) meta-analysis including the 13 trials for which IPD were unavailable (N = 605) revealed that VO2peak was reduced in OSA patients compared to controls (mean difference: -2.30 mL·kg-1 min-1; 95% CI: -3.96 to -0.63; p < 0.001) with high heterogeneity. In conclusion, IPD meta-analysis suggests that VO2peak and the cardiovascular response to exercise are preserved in moderate to severe OSA patients while AD meta-analysis suggests lower VO2peak in severe OSA.","Working the 'wise' in speech and language therapy: Evidence-based practice, biopolitics and 'pastoral labour'.",https://www.ncbi.nlm.nih.gov/pubmed/30933880,Social science & medicine (1982),2019 05 13,"This paper examines how power and knowledge are involved in the workings of speech and language therapy and in the work of speech and language therapists (SLTs). The paper draws on Foucault for its conceptual frame, with reference to his exposition of governmentality, biopolitics and pastoral power. Based on interviews with thirty-three SLTs in the UK, the findings show that evidence-based practice (EBP) is ever-present in speech and language therapy, despite its apparent absence; and that its power circulates in a multitude of ways. EBP as a process, and not an outcome, was workable. When competent practice was at risk, however, the SLTs challenged the dominance of EBP by saying it needed to 'get real' but then were troubled when it did. Working the 'wise' - those people involved with the client, including the SLTs themselves - was key to speech and language therapy; as was the making of subjects into biopolitical objects. At its most rewarding, but also most personally challenging, the work of SLTs involves mediating between different ways of being in the world and reimagining life, personhood and citizenship; to capture this complex labour process, the paper introduces the term 'pastoral labour'."

When a speech suffix is appended to the list, however, the advantage for final items is diminished. The usual interpretation is that listeners recover phonological structure from speech signals and use that structure to store items in a working memory buffer; the process of recovering phonological structure for a suffix interrupts that processing for the final list item. Although not mutually exclusive, another hypothesis suggests that perceptual grouping of list items and suffix based on common acoustic structure is necessary for the effect to occur. To evaluate these accounts as well as potential age-related differences, adults and 8-year-old children were asked to recall order of presentation for a closed set of nouns in five suffix conditions: none, auditory go, lipread go, a tone, and a colored circle. Overt articulation was prohibited, but attention to the suffix was mandated. Children's serial recall was generally poorer than that of adults, but patterns across list positions were similar for both age groups. Participants showed stronger effects for speech suffixes than for nonspeech suffixes regardless of whether suffixes were seen or heard, but effects were not restricted to final list items. And although effects of heard and lipread suffixes were similar for early list items, heard speech exerted greater effects on late list items. Outcomes suggest that some effect of heard and lipread speech suffixes arises from their shared phonological structure, but this effect is strongest when perceptual grouping occurs.",Label-free target identification in drug discovery via phenotypic screening.,https://www.ncbi.nlm.nih.gov/pubmed/30933868,Current opinion in chemical biology,2019 05 22,"Phenotypic screening has demonstrated its advantage in the discovery of first-in-class therapeutics, whereas target-based screening has showed strength for follower drugs. Owing to the unbiased nature of phenotypic screening, novel druggable proteins can be uncovered by target identification. Chemical label-free target identification methods can eliminate the functionalization step of an original bioactive compound. Herein, we summarize recent advances in the development of label-free target identification methods, which are based on changes in protein stability against proteolysis, and chemical and thermal denaturation. Owing to the increasing application of shift in thermal stability for protein analysis in live cells and tissues, we mainly focus on the cellular stability shift assay and its proteome-wide application for target identification.",Effects of Snoezelen-Multisensory environment on CARS scale in adolescents and adults with autism spectrum disorder.,https://www.ncbi.nlm.nih.gov/pubmed/30933867,Research in developmental disabilities,2019 04 27,"New classification system Diagnostic and statistical manual of mental disorders. 5th ed.(DSM - 5) includes sensory problems as one of the symptoms in diagnostic profile of Autism Spectrum Disorder (ASD).

At its core, perimetry relies on a subject pressing a button whenever they see a visual stimulus within their field of view. This sequential process then yields a 2D visual field image that is critical for clinical use. Perimetry is painfully slow however, with examinations lasting 7-8 minutes per eye. Maintaining high levels of concentration during that time is exhausting for the patient and negatively affects the acquired visual field. We introduce PASS, a novel perimetry testing strategy, based on reinforcement learning, that requires fewer locations in order to effectively estimate 2D visual fields. PASS uses a selection policy that determines what locations should be tested in order to reconstruct the complete visual field as accurately as possible, and then separately reconstructs the visual field from sparse observations. Furthermore, PASS is patient-specific and non-greedy. It adaptively selects what locations to query based on the patient's answers to previous queries, and the locations are jointly selected to maximize the quality of the final reconstruction. In our experiments, we show that PASS outperforms state-of-the-art methods, leading to more accurate reconstructions while reducing between 30% and 70% the duration of the patient examination.",From synthetic biology to human therapy: engineered mammalian cells.,https://www.ncbi.nlm.nih.gov/pubmed/30933864,Current opinion in biotechnology,2019 06 10,"Mammalian synthetic biology has evolved to become a key driver of biomedical innovation in the area of cell therapy.

The rapid in situ microwave synthesis process offers the possibility of MOFs to a large-scale application. In this study, Fe3O4@MIL-100(Fe) was rapidly prepared via microwave in 30 min using Fe3O4 as metal precursor and applied as the adsorbent and photocatalyst to remove diclofenac sodium (DCF) from water. Fe3O4@MIL-100(Fe) exhibited an excellent adsorption effect to DCF with the maximum adsorption capacities of 400 mg/L. The presence of H2O2 could promote the removal of DCF during photocatalytic process. Approximately 99.4% of the DCF was removed in Fe3O4@MIL-100(Fe)/vis/H2O2 system via adsorption removal and consequent photocatalytic degradation. The high efficiency was attributed to the large BET surface area (1244.62 m2/g) and abundant iron metal sites (Fe(III) and Fe(II)) of Fe3O4@MIL-100(Fe). The adsorptive, photocatalytic property of Fe3O4@MIL-100(Fe) and the Fenton-like reaction were the main mechanisms for DCF removal. TOC analyzer was served to assess the mineralization of solutions treated by Fe3O4@MIL-100(Fe)/vis/H2O2 in 12 h. High elimination of TOC (87.8%) was observed during the DCF mineralization process. In addition, the major products were illuminated using HPLC-Q-TOF-MS and DCF degradation pathways were also proposed.",Identification of Cr(VI) speciation in ferrous sulfate-reduced chromite ore processing residue (rCOPR) and impacts of environmental factors erosion on Cr(VI) leaching.,https://www.ncbi.nlm.nih.gov/pubmed/30933861,Journal of hazardous materials,2019 06 03,"The issue that the residual Cr(VI) in the reduced chromite ore processing residue (rCOPR) is slowly released during deposition has attracted increasing attention. However, the speciation and leaching behaviors of Cr(VI) in rCOPR are still not clear, which is essential for revealing the release mechanism of Cr(VI). In this study, ettringite was determined to be the host phase of Cr(VI) in ferrous sulfate-reduced COPR by scanning electron microscopy (SEM), microfocus X-ray fluorescence spectroscopy (μ-XRF) and aberration-corrected scanning transmission electron microscopy (Cs-STEM). This is because the channel structure of ettringite makes it relatively easy for sulfate to be replaced by chromate with similar structure and thermochemical radius. Furthermore, the investigation on the leaching behavior and mechanism of Cr(VI) in rCOPR eroded by environmental factors showed that carbonates, sulfates and acid can promote the release of Cr(VI). Among them, the erosion effect of HCl on rCOPR is weaker than that of Na2CO3 and Na2SO4 because rCOPR possesses a high buffering reserve of alkalinity. In addition, the erosion of rCOPR by Na2CO3 and Na2SO4 can change Cr(VI) speciation in rCOPR. The results implied that the environmental risk of Cr(VI) release during the deposition of rCOPR should deserve careful assessment.",Probing the photo- and electro-catalytic degradation mechanism of methylene blue dye over ZIF-derived ZnO.,https://www.ncbi.nlm.nih.gov/pubmed/30933860,Journal of hazardous materials,2019 06 03,"Due to the severe water pollution from effluent dyes, the need of the hour is to find a suitable dye degradation technology, and appropriate catalyst materials. Semiconducting ZnO was produced by pyrolysis of ZIF-8 template. The materials were well characterized with in situ and ex situ XRD and TGA, FE-SEM, HRTEM, UV-DRS, PL, and FRET. The results showed that upon calcination the body centered cubic ZIF-8 produces hexagonal primitive ZnO while retaining the truncated cubic shaped particles. The materials were screened for photo- and electro-catalytic oxidation of methylene blue. In both the different degradation technologies, ZnO synthesized from ZIF-8 outperformed the ZIF-8. The FRET dynamics showed significant spectral overlap of ZnO emission and the methylene blue absorption. It was found to be responsible for the better photocatalytic efficacy of ZnO samples than ZIF-8. The proposed reaction mechanism showed that the surface-bound reactive oxygen species produced either by light exposure or due to applied bias is key to dye degradation. The cytotoxicity of the untreated and ZnO and ZIF-8 treated dye over melanoma cells was evaluated, and it was found that the cytotoxicity of the degraded dye from ZIF-derived ZnO was less compared to that of ZIF-8 treated one.",Metal-organic frameworks-derived MnO2/Mn3O4 microcuboids with hierarchically ordered nanosheets and Ti3C2 MXene/Au NPs composites for electrochemical pesticide detection.,https://www.ncbi.nlm.nih.gov/pubmed/30933859,Journal of hazardous materials,2019 06 03,"Transition metal oxides (TMOs) derived from metal - organic frameworks (MOF) combined with two-dimensional (2D) transition metal carbides possibly pave an innovative pathway for designing promising biosensors.

Besides that, the biosensor possesses a low limit of detection (1.34 × 10-13 M), which far exceeds the maximum residue limits (MRLs) for methamidophos (0.01 mg/kg) established by European Union. Additionally, the feasibility of the proposed biosensor for detecting methamidophos in real samples has been demonstrated with excellent recoveries (95.2%-101.3%). Interestingly, the unique structures and remarkable properties of these composites make them attractive materials for various electrochemical sensors for monitoring either pesticide residuals or other environmentally deleterious chemicals."

Our data demonstrated that ambroxol has an imperative role in inhibiting the lipopolysaccharide (LPS) stimulated nitrite levels, total cellular and mitochondrial reactive oxygen species level which was determined by Griess assay, DCFDA, and MitoSOX Red staining, respectively. We found that ambroxol remarkably reduced imiquimod (IMQ) induced epidermal hyperplasia, psoriasis area and severity index (PASI) scoring, splenomegaly, skin, and ear fold thickness. In addition, the histopathological evaluation revealed that ambroxol topical and subcutaneous treatment eloquently reduced psoriasiform lesions including acanthosis. Moreover, with ambroxol intervention, the levels of antioxidants glutathione (GSH), superoxide dismutase (SOD), and IL-10 were found to be increased along with a reduction in nitrite levels in skin tissues. On the other hand, ambroxol treatment significantly reduced imiquimod-induced levels of inflammatory cytokines such as IL-1β, IL-6, IL-17, IL-22, IL-23, TGF-β, and TNF-α. Furthermore, from immunoblotting, we found a decrease in the protein expression of nitrotyrosine, iNOS, NF-κB and MAPKs signaling cascade with a concomitant increase in the expression of Nrf-2 and SOD-1 in RAW 264.7 cells and skin tissues by ambroxol. Similar findings were observed by immunofluorescence in macrophages. Moreover, ambroxol downregulated the ICAM-1 and Ki67 expression observed in skin tissues. Collectively, our results demonstrate that ambroxol may have intriguing therapeutic possibilities in attenuating psoriasis.",Ear- and hearing-related impact on quality of life in children with cleft palate: Development and pretest of a health-related quality of life (HRQOL) instrument.,https://www.ncbi.nlm.nih.gov/pubmed/30933842,International journal of pediatric otorhinolaryngology,2019 05 27,To investigate to what extent middle ear problems and associated hearing loss affect quality of life (QoL) of children born with a cleft palate.,Age of identification of sensorineural hearing loss and Characteristics of affected children: Findings from two cross-sectional studies in Saudi Arabia.,https://www.ncbi.nlm.nih.gov/pubmed/30933841,International journal of pediatric otorhinolaryngology,2019 05 27,To identify the average age of identification (AOI) and characteristics of Saudi children with sensorineural hearing loss (SNHL).,Chemically cross-linked polyacrylonitrile.

Obviously, several approaches to remedy this situation are possible. However, little progress can be made if becoming involved in such activities reduces a researcher's chances of rank and status advancement and other rewards.

This paper evaluates by finite element analysis the biomechanical response and stress distribution of a novel disc prosthesis using FGP. The kinetics of the FGP parameters is designed using experimental data issued from linear ethylene copolymers over a wide crystallinity range. The radial variation in crystallinity index within the disc prosthesis varies gradually and continuously following a special function in the aim to tailor and optimize the FGP parameters. The experimental data of a healthy human cervical spine segment are used to predict the optimal model of the FGP disc prosthesis loaded under different physiological loading conditions, i.e. rotation, lateral bending and flexion/extension. The results suggest that the FGP parameters can be tailored to control the stiffening, the non-linear behavior, the inelastic effects and the stress distribution in the aim to propose the optimal prosthesis model giving the great opportunity of patient-specific FGP prostheses via 3D printing technologies.",Torsional whole-life transformation ratchetting under pure-torsional and non-proportional multiaxial cyclic loadings of NiTi SMA at human-body temperature: Experimental observations and life-prediction model.,https://www.ncbi.nlm.nih.gov/pubmed/30933835,Journal of the mechanical behavior of biomedical materials,2019 04 19,"Torsional whole-life transformation ratchetting is investigated under pure-torsional and non-proportional multiaxial loadings of NiTi SMA micro-tubes at human-body temperature (310 K), where three paths of torsional loadings and five paths of multiaxial ones are considered. It is observed that the evolution of the torsional whole-life transformation ratchetting depends strongly on the loading paths and stress levels, and the fatigue lives of pure-torsional loadings decrease faster than that of uniaxial and multiaxial ones with the increase of peak stress. Based on the experimental investigations, a life-prediction model which depends on the applied stress levels is proposed for NiTi SMA micro-tubes, where the martensite transformation and reorientation of NiTi SMAs are considered.

Therefore, it is important to differentiate the potential contributions of ecosystems (ecosystem service supply) from the fraction of the supply that is captured or used. This is even more relevant when the supply and capture of the service occur in different locations. In this case, propagation models are needed to identify who wins and who loses when land-use policies are applied. In this study, we developed an integrated approach for the analysis of supply, propagation and capture patterns of flood-mitigation ecosystem service in rural landscapes and we illustrated how to apply it for the identification of winning and losing farmers under alternative land-use scenarios. The proposed approach allowed us to differentiate farms according to their flood mitigation capacity and to estimate how that capacity could be affected by changes in land use. It also highlights the importance of considering the propagation and capture of ecosystem services in evaluations. Reliable methodological developments are scarce. Therefore, flexible tools such as this proposal are necessary to fit the available information and the context to be analyzed.","Impacts of iron oxide and titanium dioxide nanoparticles on biogas production: Hydrogen sulfide mitigation, process stability, and prospective challenges.",https://www.ncbi.nlm.nih.gov/pubmed/30933820,Journal of environmental management,2019 04 22,"Anaerobic digestion for biogas production is one of the most used technology for bioenergy. However, the adoption of nanoparticles still needs further studies. Therefore, this study was designed to examine the effect of metal oxide nanoparticles (MONPs) at four different concentrations in two different combinations, 20 (R1) and 100 (R2) mg/L for Fe2O3, 100 (R3) and 500 (R4) mg/L for TiO2, and a mixture of Fe2O3 and TiO2 at rates of 20, 500 (R5) and 100, and 500 (R6), on hydrogen sulfide (H2S) mitigation, biogas, and methane (CH4) yield during the anaerobic digestion of cattle manure (CM) using an anaerobic batch system. The results showed that H2S production was 2.13, 2.38, 2.37, 2.51, 2.64, and 2.17 times lower than that of the control (R0), respectively, when the CM was treated by the aforementioned MONPs.

The highest specific production of biogas and CH4 was 336.25 and 192.31 mL/gVS, respectively, which was achieved by R4 supplemented with 500 mg/L TiO2 NPs, while the corresponding values in the case of R0 were 286.38 and 158.55 mL/gVS.",Hydrological modeling and field validation of a bioretention basin.,https://www.ncbi.nlm.nih.gov/pubmed/30933819,Journal of environmental management,2019 04 22,"An emerging green infrastructure, the bioretention basin, has been deployed world-wide to reduce peak flows, encourage infiltration, and treat pollutants. However, inadequate design of a basin impairs its treatment potential and necessitates the development and validation of a suitable hydrological model for design and analysis of bioretention basins. In this study, an existing numerical model, RECHARGE, has been adopted to simulate hydrological performance of a basin in the tropical climate of Singapore over a half year that included 80 storm events. Comparison of the model predictions with field observations shows that RECHARGE successfully simulates the basin hydrology of 80 events of varying rainfall characteristics with mass balance error of 5.1 ± 7.5% per event and 0.3% overall. Using the verified model, we develop new design curves that predict bioretention basin performance as a function of three basin design parameters: detention depth; ratio of drainage basin area to bioretention area; and saturated hydraulic conductivity of the basin soil media. We evaluate basin performance in terms of the percentage of water that infiltrates and is treated in the subsurface portion of the basin and define an infiltration index to measure the change in infiltrated percentage caused by unit change in the basin design parameters. The marginal improvement in basin performance drops significantly when the basin depth (hd) is increased above 40 cm, when the ratio of drainage area to bioretention area (R) is decreased below 20, or when the saturated hydraulic conductivity (Ks) is increased above 10 cm/h.",Hysteresis resulting in forestry heat storage underestimation: A case study of plantation forestry in northern China.,https://www.ncbi.nlm.nih.gov/pubmed/30933817,The Science of the total environment,2019 06 14,"Heat storage (Q) is an important component of the near-surface energy balance, and has been increasingly considered in recent energy balance studies. Studies have revealed that the hysteresis of heat storage was always been ignored, which leaded to the underestimation of heat storage proportion in energy balance. So, for further understanding the role of hysteresis effect in forestry heat storage, an observation experiment of heat storage in forestry of Pinus sylvestris var. mongolica Litv forestry - a common species in northern China - was conducted. Heat storage in the atmosphere beneath canopy, in the canopy biomass, and in the soil above a soil heat-flow plate were monitored continuously, to determine the distribution of stored heat, and solar radiation was simultaneously monitored to verify the hysteresis of heat storage versus radiation. Seasonal variations were separately analyzed to further clarify phenological effect on hysteresis. Correlation relationship was tested of lag time and underestimated energy versus climatic factors and physiological characteristics, for clarifying the reasons that resulting in hysteresis differences under different experimental day. The main results were as follows: (1) Hysteresis exists in heat storage and the lag time was 3.79 h in our study area; (2) The evaluation of hysteresis is crucial to avoid an underestimation of heat storage. Correction of lag time increases the heat storage proportion in R from 3.78% to 8.48%; (3) Increasing of air temperature and humility daily differences will enhance the underestimated energy. High radiation condition will weak the underestimation on heat storage and short the lag time. Soil moisture and leaf area index were not effect energy hysteresis significantly in sandy vegetation. Climatic factors were the main reason that resulting in the differences of hysteresis. This study helps to improve understanding energy transmitting in canopy and offering a new view in solving surface energy imbalance.",Reduction of steel slag leachate pH via humidification using water and aqueous reagents.,https://www.ncbi.nlm.nih.gov/pubmed/30933816,The Science of the total environment,2019 05 02,"A slag humidification process that aims to reduce the leachate pH of steel slag via carbonation was accomplished by simply wetting the slag and exposing it to the atmosphere for passive diffusion of atmospheric CO2. The optimization parameters of the process were studied. Results showed that by wetting the slag using various aqueous solutions (deionized water, NaCl solution and NaOH solution), such that its moisture content nearly reaches its water holding capacity, a significant reduction in leachate pH could be achieved. Pretreatment of the slag using 1 M NaOH and subsequent humidification using deionized water showed the best efficiency of 1.1 pH unit reduction among the tested conditions. Slag pretreatment could substantially enhance the carbonation degree on the slag surface, leading to conservation of the treatment effectiveness up to three times the leachate replenishment using deionized water. The benefit of the alkaline treatment to promote slag carbonation could also be achieved using a low to moderate (0.005-0.1 M) NaOH solutions for humidification without the pretreatment step. A 72.5% increase in the treatment efficiency could be achieved via a humidification treatment using 0.005 M NaOH solution compared to that using deionized water. This study shows the promise of humidification treatment as a low-cost, easily implemented, and environmentally friendly slag pH neutralization process that can be applied in the field for slag treatment prior to its use or disposal in the environment.","Quality survey and spatiotemporal variations of atrazine and desethylatrazine in drinking water in Quebec, Canada.",https://www.ncbi.nlm.nih.gov/pubmed/30933813,The Science of the total environment,2019 06 14,"The herbicide atrazine remains in use in Canada, the United States, and several other countries, while being banned since 2003 in the European Union. A comprehensive quality survey of atrazine (ATZ) and one of its metabolites, desethylatrazine (DEA), was conducted in 2015-2018 in drinking water available to consumers in Quebec, Canada. Temporal variations of ATZ and DEA were monitored in tap water from the Montreal area for 18 consecutive months (Temporal survey 2015-2016). Within this time window, the sum of ATZ and DEA in tap water samples (n = 450) varied from 40 to 250 ng L-1 (median: 98 ng L-1). ATZ was systematically detected (100%), with a concentration range of 30-195 ng L-1 (median: 49 ng L-1) while DEA was in the range of 10-187 ng L-1 (median: 36 ng L-1). Maximum ATZ concentrations remained about 25× lower than the Canadian drinking water quality guideline (5000 ng L-1), but 48% of the samples were above that of the European Union (100 ng L-1) regarding the sum of ATZ and DEA. Trends of ATZ and DEA in drinking water were also examined across southwestern Quebec (Spatial survey 2017-2018). The sum of the two triazines in this second set of samples varied from below the method detection limit (for 33 out of the 52 surveyed municipalities) to 104 ng L-1. Apart from Montreal, locations in the southern shore of the St. Lawrence showed generally higher levels of atrazine and DEA. The highest concentrations clustered in the Montérégie region, along the St. Lawrence River (e.g., Brossard, Longueuil, Saint-Constant) and/or downstream from agricultural areas. The ATZ concentrations are suggested to have decreased compared to previous surveys, which is consistent with the decrease in the sales of active ingredients in Ontario (upstream sources) and Quebec.",Prospects of thermal power plants switching from traditional fuels to coal-water slurries containing petrochemicals.,https://www.ncbi.nlm.nih.gov/pubmed/30933812,The Science of the total environment,2019 05 02,"The amount of thermal and electric energy produced by coal combustion increases nonlinearly, because the production capacities and consumption of the corresponding energy are on the rise. The prospects of excluding coal from the picture are slim, because it has been traditionally considered one of the most attractive fuels in terms of cost and heat of combustion. What we need is major changes in the energy industry towards environmentally effective use of coals and their processing wastes. In this research, we show the possibility of coal-fired thermal power plants and steam shops switching to coal-water slurries containing petrochemicals (CWSP). Extra calculations are made for fuel oil and natural gas. The scientific novelty of the research consists in the comprehensive consideration of all the possible technological modifications in the fuel feeding, storage, and preparation system. We focus on potential benefits of thermal power plants and steam shops switching from coal, gas, and fuel oil to coal-water slurries containing petrochemicals, while taking into account all the main and most important environmental, economic, and energy performance indicators. Using CWSP instead of coal is much more environmentally friendly. By varying the content of water and additives in CWSP, we can lower the proportion of sulfur and nitrogen and slow down their oxidation. It is also possible to reduce temperature in the combustion zone and improve oxide retention in the ash without its release in the form of anthropogenic emissions. Throughout the world, tens of thousands of fuel oil and coal-fired TPPs with the annual gross electric output of 1.8 TW can switch to CWSP. The integrated performance indicators of CWSP fuels are only inferior to those of natural gas but these slurries are prepared from numerous industrial wastes.",Toxicological responses of Fe3O4 nanoparticles on Eichhornia crassipes and associated plant transportation.,https://www.ncbi.nlm.nih.gov/pubmed/30933811,The Science of the total environment,2019 05 01,"This work investigated the interaction of Fe3O4 nanoparticles (NPs) with a floating water plant (Eichhornia crassipes). The effects of Fe3O4 NPs on E. crassipes physiology and root morphology as well as the migration and transformation of Fe3O4 NPs in plant were studied emphatically. Fe3O4 NPs (200 mg/L) showed significant growth inhibition on E. crassipes roots and leaves after a 21-day exposure, while dissolved Fe3+ ions and Fe3O4 bulk particles had no obvious effect on E. crassipes growth. Scanning electron microscopy showed that the roots of E. crassipes were significantly damaged, the root tips became thin and the root epidermis began to peel off after Fe3O4 NPs exposure. In addition, there was disordered cell arrangement and a destroyed elongation zone of the root tips. The physiology of E. crassipes was also affected. In particular, after exposure to Fe3O4 NPs (200 mg/L), a distinct decrease in chlorophyll content and catalase activity and an increase of malondialdehyde (MDA) content could be seen. Transmission electron microscopy and energy dispersive spectroscopy revealed that Fe3O4 NPs were present in the root epidermis, intercellular space and protoplasts, as well as in the leaf cytoplasm and chloroplasts. Vulcanization in the leaves was also found through diffraction analysis, which may be due to the small number of absorbed nanoparticles, some of which still existed in the original form in the leaves while others were reduced to FeS through interactions with plant components during translocation. These findings are helpful for better understanding the fate of NPs in aquatic plants. Moreover, it is important to evaluate the water environment safety of NPs.","Spatial distribution, source apportionment and risk assessment of antibiotics in the surface water and sediments of the Yangtze Estuary.",https://www.ncbi.nlm.nih.gov/pubmed/30933810,The Science of the total environment,2019 05 01,"The ""pseudo-durability"" of antibiotics in estuaries is gaining increasing interest, especially in the Yangtze Estuary, a vital water supply source for the Shanghai city. To clearly describe the pollution level and risk of antibiotics in this estuary, the contents of 8 typical antibiotics in the surface water and the sediment along the nearshore zone and in the estuarine channel in the estuary were comprehensively analyzed. The results revealed that sulfonamides and tetracycline are the predominant antibiotics in the surface water, while tetracyclines and fluoroquinolones are the dominant ones in the sediments. The ranges of the eight antibiotic concentrations between the nearshore zone (not detected to 7.06 ng/L for water, below LOD to 10.94 ng/g for sediment) and the estuarine channel (not detected to 8.46 ng/L for water, not detected to 14.84 ng/g for sediment) showed no notable differences, but the degree of scatter was different for each antibiotic. The spatial distribution was different for each antibiotic in the north branch and the south branch; higher values for most of the target antibiotics were observed in the south branch of the estuary. The distribution and source analysis from a GIS map using the kriging method indicated that runoff input and the antibiotic residues from aquaculture were the two major sources of the antibiotic pollution in the Yangtze Estuary. A risk assessment of the individual antibiotic exposure in the surface water showed that sulfamethoxazole, ofloxacin and ciprofloxacin, tetracycline and oxytetracycline, and sulfadiazine, roxithromycin and erythromycin in this area exhibited a medium risk, low risk and almost no risk to the selected aquatic microorganisms, respectively.",Regional discrepancies in spatiotemporal variations and driving forces of open crop residue burning emissions in China.,https://www.ncbi.nlm.nih.gov/pubmed/30933809,The Science of the total environment,2019 05 02,"As a major source of secondary organic aerosol, open crop residue burning (OCB) emits a large number of trace gases and particulates to the atmosphere. Extensive OCB is detected during harvest seasons in most regions of China. Emissions from OCB have been widely investigated in China, but few studies have focused on regional discrepancies in spatiotemporal variations with a long timescale. In this study, emissions from OCB in three typical regions of China, including Northeast China, Chengdu-Chongqing and Guangdong, from 2003 to 2016, were estimated using a combination of statistical data and the Moderate Resolution Imaging Spectroradiometer (MODIS) observations, and regional discrepancies in spatiotemporal variations and driving forces were analyzed in detail. The results showed that OCB emissions of CO and PM2.5 in 2016 were 3.63 × 106 and 6.96 × 105 tons in Northeast China, 9.77 × 105 and 1.36 × 105 tons in Chengdu-Chongqing, and 1.24 × 105 and 1.19 × 104 tons in Guangdong, respectively. The OCB emissions in Northeast China maintained an overall increasing trend, which were mainly dominated by rural economic development and agricultural modernization, with great potential for reduction. In Chengdu-Chongqing, emissions increased until 2013 and then decreased, due to the impact of policies prohibiting OCB. In Guangdong, emissions showed annual fluctuations with a slightly decreasing trend influenced by metrological conditions and related policies. The analysis of the driving forces behind the regional discrepancies among these typical regions indicated that OCB emissions in China were characterized by uneven rural economic development, control policies, and natural conditions, suggesting that region-dependent control measures are needed for reducing OCB emissions. This study provided a better understanding of OCB emission characteristics in the three typical regions and revealed the diversity of OCB emission characteristics in China."

However, models projecting phenotypic responses to future climate change typically assume populations will respond similarly across the range of a species, while local adaptation and spatial variation in environmental changes are rarely considered. In this study, among-population phenotypic variability was coupled with geographic variation in anticipated hydrologic changes to examine patterns of population-level phenotypic changes expected under future climatic change. To estimate phenotypic responses to watershed hydrology, phenotype-environment associations between body shape and contemporary streamflow were quantified among populations of six species of fishes (Cyprinidae). Future streamflow estimates (2070-2099) were then used to project body shapes within populations, assuming the same phenotype-environment relationships. All species exhibited significant associations between body shape and contemporary streamflow discharge and variability. However, these relationships were not consistent, even among species occupying similar vertical positions in the water column. When these phenotype-environment relationships were projected into future streamflow conditions, populations are not expected to respond uniformly across the species' ranges, and all but one species exhibited projected morphologies outside of the current range of morphological variation. These findings suggest local adaptation and spatial heterogeneity in environmental changes interact to influence variation in the degree of expected phenotypic responses to climate change at both the species and population level.",Quantitative microbial risk assessment of Legionella pneumophila in a drinking water supply system in Israel.,https://www.ncbi.nlm.nih.gov/pubmed/30933796,The Science of the total environment,2019 05 01,"Legionella pneumophila cause human infections via inhalation of contaminated water aerosols, resulting in severe pneumonia. Legionella spp. prevalence was monitored in a drinking-water distribution system (DWDS) in Northern Israel. Five points (toilet faucets and showers) were sampled seasonally along a three years period. Toilet faucets and shower use, both generating aerosols, are known transmission routes for this pathogen and thus, present a potential health risk. Quantitative Microbial Risk Assessment (QMRA) was applied in order to assess the health risks posed by Legionella for these two exposure scenarios, while considering Legionella seasonality. The obtained results were compared with estimated tolerable risk levels of infection and of disease set by the USEPA and WHO. Both limits were expressed as Disability-Adjusted Life Years index (DALY) being 1 × 10-4 and 1 × 10-6, respectively. The QMRA revealed that the annual risk levels for both faucets and showers use exceeded the acceptable risk of infection with an average of 5.52 × 10-4 and 2.37 × 10-3 DALY'S per person per year, respectively. Annual risk levels were stable with no significant differences between the three years. Risk levels varied significantly between seasons by up to three orders of magnitude. Risk levels were highest during summer, autumn, and lowest during winter. The highest seasonal infection risk values were found in summer for both faucets and showers, which corresponded to 8.09 × 10-4 and 2.75 × 10-3 DALY'S per person per year, respectively. In conclusion, during summer and autumn there is a significant increase of the infection risk associated with exposure to Legionella-contaminated aerosols, in the studied water system. Public health assessment and prevention measures should focus on these seasons.",Reduction of nitrate by zero valent iron (ZVI)-based materials: A review.,https://www.ncbi.nlm.nih.gov/pubmed/30933795,The Science of the total environment,2019 05 02,"Zero valent iron (ZVI) and ZVI-based materials have been widely used for the reduction of nitrate, a major contaminant commonly detected in groundwater and surface water. The reduction of nitrate by ZVI is influenced by various factors, such as the physical and chemical characteristics of ZVI and the operational parameters. There are some problems for the nitrate reduction by ZVI alone, for example, the formation of iron oxides on the surface of ZVI at high pH condition, which will inhibit the further reduction of nitrate; in addition, the end reduction product is mainly ammonium, which itself needs to be concerned. Several strategies, such as the optimization of the structure of ZVI composites and the addition of reducing assistants, have been proposed to increase the reduction efficiency and the selectivity of end product of nitrate reduction in a wide range of pH, especially under neutral pH condition. This review will mainly focus on the high efficient reduction of nitrate by ZVI-based materials. Firstly, the reduction of nitrate by ZVI alone was briefly introduced and discussed, including the influence of physical and chemical characteristics of ZVI and some operational parameters on the reduction efficiency of nitrate. Then, the strategies for enhancing the reduction efficiency and the N2 selectivity of the reductive products of nitrate were systematically analyzed and evaluated, especially the optimization of the structure of ZVI composites (e.g., doped ZVI composite, supported ZVI composite and premagnetized ZVI), and the addition of reducing assistants (e.g., metal cations, ligand, hydrogen gas and light) were highlighted. Thirdly, the mechanisms and pathways of nitrate reduction were discussed. Finally, concluding remarks and some suggestions for the future research were proposed.",Comparative adsorption of emerging contaminants in water by functional designed magnetic poly(N-isopropylacrylamide)/chitosan hydrogels.,https://www.ncbi.nlm.nih.gov/pubmed/30933794,The Science of the total environment,2019 05 02,"The magnetic poly(N-isopropylacrylamide)/chitosan hydrogel with interpenetrating network (IPN) structure was designed based on the functional groups of targeted emerging contaminants, represented by hydrophilic sulfamethoxazole (SMZ) and hydrophobic bisphenol A (BPA). The average particle size, specific surface area, and total pore volume of the hydrogel were turned out to be 103.7 μm, 60.70 m2/g and 0.0672 cm3/g, respectively. Adsorption results indicated that the maximum adsorption capacity occurred at the pH where SMZ was anionic and BPA was uncharged. When the adsorption temperature increased from 25 °C to 35 °C, the amount of adsorbed SMZ hardly changed, but that of BPA increased by two times. The adsorption capacity of the binary system (i.e., with both SMZ and BPA) was almost the same as that of the single system, indicating that simultaneous adsorption of SMZ and BPA was achieved. The adsorption equilibrium was reached quickly (within 5 min) for both SMZ and BPA. For adsorption isotherm, the Freundlich model fitted well for SMZ at 25, 35 and 45 °C. However, the adsorption of BPA exhibited the sigmoidally shaped isotherm at 25 °C with the Slips model fitting well, and both the Freundlich isotherm and the Slips isotherm fitted the data well at 35 °C and 45 °C, suggesting that the adsorption force was initially weak but greatly enhanced with an increase in adsorbate concentration or ambient temperature. The main adsorption mechanism was inferred to be electrostatic interactions for SMZ, and hydrophobic interactions as well as hydrogen bonding for BPA. The hydrogel adsorbent maintained favorable adsorption capacity for BPA after five adsorption-desorption cycles. These findings may provide a strategy for designing high performance adsorbents that can remove both hydrophilic and hydrophobic organic contaminants in the aquatic environment.",Synthesis using natural functionalization of activated carbon from pumpkin peels for decolourization of aqueous methylene blue.,https://www.ncbi.nlm.nih.gov/pubmed/30933793,The Science of the total environment,2019 05 01,"In this study, a novel approach was applied for modification and functionalization of pumpkin peels (PP) derived carbon using natural beetroot extract. PP waste biomass was carbonized at 250 (AC250), 350 (AC350), 450 (AC450) and 550 °C (AC550) and used as adsorbent for the scavenging of methylene blue (MB). The adsorption results revealed that AC250 was the most efficient material. Thereafter, AC250 was further modified with different acids and natural beetroot extract to enhance the adsorption efficiency for MB removal. Modified and functionalized carbon materials were characterized to determine the functional groups, crystalline nature and surface morphology of adsorbents using Fourier Transformed Infra-Red spectroscopy, X-ray Diffraction and Scanning Electron Microscopy. The pore size distribution measurements by non-local density functional theory (NLDFT) revealed the presence of large number of mesopores in the beetroot activated carbon (BAC) with the BET specific surface area of 3.6 m2.g-1. The adsorption studies exhibited the highest adsorption (198.15 mg.g-1) for MB using 0.5 g.L-1 of adsorbent mass at 200 mg.L-1 MB concentration and 50 °C within 180 min. Reaction kinetics analysis of the experimental data revealed that adsorption followed pseudo second order kinetic model where BAC250 showed highest reaction rate constant value of 0.0095 and correlation coefficient value of 0.9992. The equilibrium data were tested by using Freundlich and Langmuir isotherm models. For both isotherms, the characteristic parameters were determined and the adsorption behaviour was found to fit well with the Langmuir isotherm model indicating monolayer adsorption of MB.",Environmental heterogeneity influences plant resource use - A case study in a rural community of NE Brazil.,https://www.ncbi.nlm.nih.gov/pubmed/30933792,The Science of the total environment,2019 05 01,"In regions of high environmental heterogeneity, it is important to observe if different landscape units are used differently by human populations, which can have consequences for the conservation of these units. Thus, the present study seeks to answer the following questions: (1) are different native vegetation units used for different purposes by the local population? (2) is there a difference between the conservation status of native vegetation units according to the local perception? The study was implemented in the rural community of Morrão de Cima, in the municipality of São Desidério (Northeast Brazil). Data were collected through semi-structured interviews and participatory workshops. The main native vegetation units recognized by the interviewees were Brejo, Mata Seca, Serra and Chapada. The community uses the different units of native vegetation for different purposes. The extraction of medicinal resources was important in the Chapada, while the exploitation of food resources was important in the Brejo, and the collection of wood resources was more substantial in Mata Seca and in Serra. We also found differences in the perceived conservation status of the native vegetation units. Our findings indicate the need of caution when proposing conservation strategies in heterogeneous environments, since each landscape unit may be undergoing specific processes, requiring different strategies.",Algal fouling and extracellular organic matter removal in powdered activated carbon-submerged hollow fiber ultrafiltration membrane systems.,https://www.ncbi.nlm.nih.gov/pubmed/30933791,The Science of the total environment,2019 05 01,"In this work, the effect of powdered activated carbon (PAC) on fouling by algal solution during ultrafiltration using two different PAC dosing strategies: pre-depositing PAC onto the membrane surfaces or the conventional addition of PAC to the bulk feed. The addition of PAC by either mode improved the removal of extracellular organic matter (EOM) from the algal solution. However, for the pre-deposition mode, increasing the PAC amount from 0 to 2.1 g caused a steady increase in the membrane fouling rate (from 0.4 to 1.4 kPa/h), whereas the opposite result (from 0.4 down to 0.1 kPa/h) was found for the conventional PAC dosing mode. This is likely due to the differences in the initial arrangement of algal cells and PAC along the cake layer depths. The pre-deposited PAC avoided contact between cells and membranes, but aggravated the deformation of the cells and hindered their back-transport to the bulk solution. Furthermore, although the effect of PAC on the EOM fouling was marginal, there were highly synergistic effects when cells and EOM were present together in the PAC pre-deposition mode. Changes in the PAC dosing mode also altered the PAC-membrane interactions, inducing a higher cleaning efficiency of backwash for the conventionally-dosed PAC from membrane surfaces than that for the pre-deposited PAC.",Risk assessment for the sustainability of coastal communities: A preliminary study.,https://www.ncbi.nlm.nih.gov/pubmed/30933790,The Science of the total environment,2019 05 02,"With communities increasingly concentrated in coastal regions globally, governments and stakeholders call for cohesive risk assessments for future sustainability in the wake of natural hazards. This can only be achieved through risk-based decision-making and smart resources treatment. To provide a basis for such actions, we here propose a risk assessment (RA) framework focusing on the risk-resilience-sustainability nexus. In contrast to focusing on the traditional RA approach, we propose an integrative approach based on hazard, vulnerability, and resilience covering the full spectrum of RA for effective risk reduction. We further explain how the proposed framework can simultaneously provide useful input for resilience management in parallel to achieving certain Sustainable Development Goals (SDGs). We apply this framework for typhoon risk assessment (represented by a Typhoon Risk Index-TRI) of coastal counties of mainland China. Different TRIs e.g. total population, elderly population, non-adult population, and economic status are calculated for each coastal county to supplement multi-objective empirical measures for risk reduction. The RA results show a large spatial heterogeneity in typhoon risk with an increase in the risk from north to south along the coast of mainland China. The comparative results from this study are relevant to the prioritization of different regions for immediate or gradual actions, wise decision-making, and risk reduction through proper treatment of resources-related policy implications. The evaluation of the SDGs achievement status reveals that the overall performance of coastal provinces in mainland China is higher to achieve SDGs 3 and 15 followed by 13 and 8. The study shows that while Guangdong province is in the highest risk category, its achievement status for SDG-13 (climate actions, strengthening resilience) is the lowest relative to other provinces, which is critical. This study represents a major scientific contribution to mainland China's coastal risk management and calls for aligning risk-informed planning and sustainability frameworks.",Turbulence exerts nutrients uptake and assimilation of bloom-forming Dolichospermum through modulating morphological traits: Field and chemostat culture studies.,https://www.ncbi.nlm.nih.gov/pubmed/30933789,The Science of the total environment,2019 05 01,"Hydrodynamic conditions are closely related to the development and dissipation of cyanobacterial blooms. The morphological features of Dolichospermum under different hydrodynamic conditions were analysed during three blooms in Gaoyang Lake, which is part of the backwater area of the China Three Gorges Reservoir, from 2007 to 2010. The results showed that the length of filaments and the morphology of cells were different in relation to the turbulence caused by the difference in hydraulic retention times. Thus, it was hypothesized that turbulence could shape the morphology and physiology of cyanobacteria. To answer the question regarding what the morphological and physiological responses of cyanobacteria to turbulent mixing mean for these organisms, laboratory experiments in continuous cultivation under different dilution rates were conducted to analyse the effects of specific turbulence intensity on the growth, nutrient uptake and morphology of Dolichospermum flos-aquae. Increasing the turbulence intensity caused synchronous increases in the ratio of the cellular length to the width, in the specific surface area of the filament and the cell and in the nutrient uptake rate; at the same time, the average filament length decreased. These indicated that the turbulence, within the range of our experimental design, could stimulate the growth of Dolichospermum by increasing its nutrient uptake. Additionally, at a high specific growth rate, the nutrient uptake rate of Dolichospermum changed more noticeably with the increasing morphological indicators, indicating that the rapidly growing Dolichospermum was more sensitive to turbulence. These findings explain the role of morphological strategies in the dominance of Dolichospermum within a certain range of turbulence intensity, especially in the early growth stage of blooms. The results also facilitate a greater understanding of the hydrodynamic effects on cyanobacteria and will be instrumental in developing flow regulation to control cyanobacterial blooms in reservoirs.","Paenibacillus 79R4, a potential rumen probiotic to enhance nitrite detoxification and methane mitigation in nitrate-treated ruminants.",https://www.ncbi.nlm.nih.gov/pubmed/30933788,The Science of the total environment,2019 05 01,"The effects of supplemental nitrate administered alone or with a denitrifying ruminal bacterium, designated Paenibacillus 79R4 (79R4) intentionally selected for enhanced nitrate- and nitrite-metabolizing ability, on select rumen fermentation characteristics was examined in vivo. Rumen and blood samples were collected from cannulated Holstein steers one day prior to and one day after initiation of treatments applied as three consecutive intra-ruminal administrations of nitrate, to achieve the equivalent of 83 mg sodium nitrate/kg body weight day, given alone or with the nitrite-selected 79R4 (provided to achieve 106 cells/mL rumen fluid). Results revealed a day effect on methane-producing activity, with rates of methane production by ruminal microbes being more rapid when collected one day before than one day after initiation of treatments. Nitrate-metabolizing activity of the rumen microbes was unaffected by day, treatment or their interaction. A day by treatment interaction was observed on nitrite-metabolizing activity, with rates of nitrite metabolism by rumen microbes being most rapid in populations collected one day after initiation of treatment from steers treated with nitrate plus 79R4. A day by treatment interaction was also observed on plasma methemoglobin concentrations, with concentrations being lower from steers one day after initiation of treatments than from collected one day prior to treatment initiation and concentrations being lowest in steers treated with nitrate plus 79R4. A major effect of treatment was observed on accumulations of most prominent and branched chain volatile fatty acids produced and amounts of hexose fermented in the rumen of animals administered nitrate, with concentrations being decreased in steers administered nitrate alone when compared to steers treated with nitrate plus the 79R4. These results demonstrate that the nitrite-selected Paenibacillus 79R4 may help prevent nitrite toxicity in nitrate-treated ruminants while maintaining benefits of reduced methane emissions and preventing inhibition of fermentation efficiency by the microbial ecosystem."

The SEM, TEM, XPS and FT-IR were used to research the structure of the g-CNNCs. We found that the g-CNNCs showed high selective and sensitive for fluorescence enhancement detection of Pb2+ ion via covalent interaction. In addition, the g-CNNCs exhibit stable and specific concentration-dependent fluorescence intensity in the presence of Pb2+ ion in the range of 1-200 μmol·dm-3, and the limit of detection was estimated to be 0.0438 μmol·dm-3 (3S/k).

Tools to guide the resection while avoiding removal of normal brain tissues can aid surgeons in achieving optimal results. One strategy to achieve this goal is to rely upon interoperative fluorescence staining of tumor cells in vivo, that can be visualized by the surgeon during resection. Towards this goal we have designed a biodegradable fluorescent mini nano imaging agent (NIA) with high specificity for U87MG glioma cells and previously unmet high light emission. The NIA is the conjugate of polymalic acid (PMLA) with chlorotoxin for tumor targeting, indocyanine green (ICG) for NIR fluorescence and the tri-leucin peptide as fluorescence enhancer. PMLA as a multivalent platform carries several molecules of ICG and the other ligands. The NIA recognizes multiple sites on glioma cell surface, demonstrated by the effects of single and combined competitors. Systemic IV injection into xenogeneic mouse model carrying human U87MG glioblastoma indicated vivid tumor cell binding and internalization of NIA resulting in intensive and long-lasting tumor fluorescence. The NIA is shown to greatly improve tumor removal supporting its utility in clinical applications.",Dissecting hiPSC-CM pacemaker function in a cardiac organoid model.,https://www.ncbi.nlm.nih.gov/pubmed/30933775,Biomaterials,2019 04 27,"Biological pacemakers could be a promising alternative to electronic pacemakers and human induced pluripotent stem cell derived cardiomyocytes (hiPSC-CM) may represent a suitable source for implantable cells. To further unravel this potential a thorough understanding of pacemaker function with regard to coupling processes both in the physiological and in the graft-host context is required. Here we developed a 2-component cardiac organoid model with a hiPSC-CM embryoid body (EB) as trigger casted into a rat engineered heart tissue (EHT) as arrhythmic beating substrate. Contractility recordings revealed that the EB controlled the beating activity of the EHT, leading to a regular hiPSC-CM-like beating pattern instead of the irregular beating typically seen in rat EHT. Connectivity was observed with action potential (AP) measurements and calcium transients transmitting from the EB directly into the rat EHT. Immunohistochemistry and genetically labeled hiPSC-CMs demonstrated that EB-derived and rat cells intermingled and formed a transitional zone. Connexin 43 expression followed the same pattern as histological and computer models have indicated for the human sinoatrial node. In conclusion, hiPSC-CM EBs function as a biological pacemaker in a 2-component cardiac organoid model, which provides the possibility to study electrophysiological and structural coupling mechanisms underlying propagation of pacemaker activity.",Gold nanoparticles modulate the crosstalk between macrophages and periodontal ligament cells for periodontitis treatment.,https://www.ncbi.nlm.nih.gov/pubmed/30933774,Biomaterials,2019 04 27,"The regeneration of lost periodontal apparatus in periodontitis treatment remains a clinical challenge due to the limited regenerative capacity of cementum, periodontal ligament and alveolar bone in periodontitis condition. For periodontal tissue regeneration, it is essential to regulate the inflammatory response and the subsequent differentiation of periodontal cells under the condition due to the infectious nature of the disease. In this study, it was noted that 45 nm gold nanoparticles (AuNPs) could exhibit significant anti-inflammatory effect and improve the periodontal inflammatory microenvironment via regulating inflammatory and regenerative cytokine production and modulating macrophage polarization, subsequently affect the differentiation of human periodontal ligament cells (hPDLCs). With the addition of direct effects of AuNPs on hPDLCs, the periodontal tissue differentiation capacity of hPDLCs in LPS-activated inflammatory macrophage-hPDLCs coculture system was significantly enhanced by the interaction between AuNPs-conditioned macrophage and AuNPs-stimulated hPDLCs. The potential therapeutic application of AuNPs in periodontal tissue regeneration and periodontitis treatment was investigated using both rat fenestration and ligature-induced periodontitis models. It was found that the treatment of 45 AuNPs showed significantly increased newly-formed periodontal attachment, bone and cementum in periodontal defect and less tissue destruction in the progression of periodontitis. This study demonstrated that 45 nm AuNPs could not only directly modulate hPDLCs, but also regulate the early inflammatory response of periodontal tissues via the regulation of macrophage phenotypes, therefore, generate a microenvironment with constraint inflammatory cytokine levels and reparative cytokines such as bone morphogenetic protein-2 (BMP-2), leading to PDLC differentiation, periodontal tissue regeneration and the prevention of periodontitis progression.",Influence of salinity on the degradation of xenobiotic compounds in rhizospheric mangrove soil.,https://www.ncbi.nlm.nih.gov/pubmed/30933772,"Environmental pollution (Barking, Essex : 1987)",2019 05 22,"Mangroves are highly productive tropical ecosystems influenced by seasonal and daily salinity changes, often exposed to sewage contamination, oil spills and heavy metals, among others. There is limited knowledge of the influence of salinity on the ability of microorganisms to degrade xenobiotic compounds. The aim of this study were to determine the salinity influence on the degradation of xenobiotic compounds in a semi-arid mangrove in La Guajira-Colombia and establish the more abundant genes and degradation pathways. In this study, rhizospheric soil of Avicennia germinans was collected in three points with contrasting salinity (4H, 2 M and 3 L). Total DNA extraction was performed and shotgun sequenced using the Illumina HiSeq technology. We annotated 507,343 reads associated with 21 pathways and detected 193 genes associated with the degradation of xenobiotics using orthologous genes from the KEGG Orthology (KO) database, of which 16 pathways and 113 genes were influenced by salinity. The highest abundances were found in high salinity. The degradation of benzoate showed the highest abundance, followed by the metabolism of the drugs and the degradation of chloroalkane and chloroalkene. The majority of genes were associated with phase I degradation of xenobiotics. The most abundant genes were acetyl-CoA C-acetyltransferase (atoB), catalase-peroxidase (katG) and GMP synthase (glutamine-hydrolysing) (guaA). In conclusion, the metagenomic analysis detected all the degradation pathways of xenobiotics of KEGG and 59% of the genes associated with these pathways were influenced by salinity.",Predicting ground-level PM2.5 concentrations in the Beijing-Tianjin-Hebei region: A hybrid remote sensing and machine learning approach.,https://www.ncbi.nlm.nih.gov/pubmed/30933771,"Environmental pollution (Barking, Essex : 1987)",2019 05 22,"An accurate estimation of PM2.5 (fine particulate matters with diameters ≤ 2.5 μm) concentration is critical for health risk assessment and generating air pollution control strategies. In this study, a hybrid remote sensing and machine learning approach, named RSRF model is proposed to estimate daily ground-level PM2.5 concentrations, which integrates Random Forest (RF), one of machine learning (ML) models, and aerosol optical depth (AOD), one of remote sensing (RS) products. The proposed RSRF model provides an opportunity for an adequate characterization of real-time spatiotemporal PM2.5 distributions at uninhabited places and complex surfaces. It also offers advantages in handling complicated non-linear relationships among a large number of meteorological, environmental and air pollutant factors, as well as ever-increasing environmental data sets. The applicability of the proposed RSRF model is tested in the Beijing-Tianjin-Hebei region (BTH region) during 2015-2017. Deep Blue (DB) AOD from Aqua-retrieved Collection 6.1 (C_61) aerosol products of Moderate Resolution Imaging Spectroradiometer (MODIS) is validated with Aerosol Robotic Network. The validation results indicate C_61 DB AOD has a high correlation with ground based AOD in the BTH region. The proposed RSRF model performed well in characterizing spatiotemporal variations of annual and seasonal PM2.5 concentrations. It not only is useful to quantify the relationships between PM2.5 and relevant factors such as DB AOD, meteorological and air pollutant variables, but also can provide decision support for air pollution control at a regional environment during haze periods.",Dietary exposure and risk assessment of exposure to hexabromocyclododecanes in a Taiwan population.,https://www.ncbi.nlm.nih.gov/pubmed/30933770,"Environmental pollution (Barking, Essex : 1987)",2019 05 22,"Hexabromocyclododecane (HBCD) is commonly used in commercial products and factories. HBCDs can be detected in the air, bioaccumulated deposits, water, soil, sediments, and in biota and foodstuffs in the food-chain because they are not chemically bound to the polymer. We determined the levels of α-, β-, and γ-HBCDs in 270 foodstuffs and the doses of HBCDs Taiwanese are normally exposed to. We also wanted to create a strategy of risk management for HBCDs based on margins of exposure (MOE). HBCDs were frequently detectible in fish, seafood, and poultry. Their highest concentrations were in fish, oil, poultry, and livestock. The highest estimated daily intake was in 0- to 3-year-olds (1.576 ng/kg/day), and lower in 3- to 6- (1.064 ng/kg/day), 6- to 12- (0.899 ng/kg/day), and lowest in 12- to 16- (0.632 ng/kg/day) year-olds. The exposure doses to HBCDs indicated no health concern for Taiwanese. Except for fish, significant concentrations of α- and γ-HBCDs were detected in many other foodstuffs, which might indicate that exposure to HBCD is a relatively recent problem. Therefore, one goal of a management policy should be to follow-up the flow direction of HBCDs in Taiwan.",Selenium induces changes of rhizosphere bacterial characteristics and enzyme activities affecting chromium/selenium uptake by pak choi (Brassica campestris L. ssp.

The rhizosphere soil characteristics of pak choi (Brassica campestris L. ssp. Chinensis Makino) were investigated in soil contaminated with different levels and forms of Cr when supplemented with Se. Although inhibition of plant growth caused by Cr stress was not completely alleviated by Se, Cr content in plant tissues decreased in Cr(VI)120Se5 treatment (Cr(VI): 120 mg kg-1 soil; Se: 5 mg kg-1 soil) and its bioavailability in soil decreased in Cr(III)200Se5 (Cr(III): 200 mg kg-1 soil; Se: 5 mg kg-1 soil) treatment. Moreover, antagonism of Cr and Se on soil enzyme activities and bacterial communities were revealed. Notably, results of Cr(VI) reduction and Se metabolism functional profiles confirmed that bacterial communities play a critical role in regulating Cr/Se bioavailability. Additionally, the increases of Se bioavailability in Cr contaminated soil were ascribed to oxidation of Cr(VI) and reduction of Se reductases proportions, as well as the enhancing of pH in soil. These findings reveal that Se has the potential capacity to sustain the stability of microdomain in Cr contaminated soil.",Assessment of pops contaminated sites and the need for stringent soil standards for food safety for the protection of human health.,https://www.ncbi.nlm.nih.gov/pubmed/30933768,"Environmental pollution (Barking, Essex : 1987)",2019 05 22,"Persistent organic pollutants (POPs) including PCDD/Fs, PCBs and organochlorine pesticides (OCPs) are among the most important and hazardous pollutants of soil. Food producing animals such as chicken, beef, sheep and goats can take up soil while grazing or living outdoors (free-range) and this can result in contamination. In recent decades, large quantities of brominated flame retardants such as polybrominated diphenyl ethers (PBDEs), short-chain chlorinated paraffins (SCCPs) and per- and polyfluorinated alkylated substances (PFAS) have been produced and released into the environment and this has resulted in widespread contamination of soils and other environmental matrices. These POPs also bioaccumulate and can contaminate food of animal origin resulting in indirect exposure of humans. Recent assessments of chicken and beef have shown that surprisingly low concentrations of PCBs and PCDD/Fs in soil can result in exceedances of regulatory limits in food. Soil contamination limits have been established in a number of countries for PCDD/Fs but it has been shown that the contamination levels which result in regulatory limits in food (the maximum levels in the European Union) being exceeded, are below all the existing soil regulatory limits. 'Safe' soil levels are exceeded in many areas around emission sources of PCDD/Fs and PCBs. On the other hand, PCDD/F and dioxin-like PCB levels in soil in rural areas, without a contamination source, are normally safe for food producing animals housed outdoors resulting in healthy food (e.g. meat, eggs, milk). For the majority of POPs (e.g. PBDEs, PFOS, PFOA, SCCP) no regulatory limits in soils exist. There is, therefore, an urgent need to develop appropriate and protective soil standards minimising human exposure from food producing animals housed outdoors. Furthermore, there is an urgent need to eliminate POPs pollution sources for soils and to control, secure and remediate contaminated sites and reservoirs, in order to reduce exposure and guarantee food safety.",Antibiotic resistance and heavy metal tolerance in cultured bacteria from hot springs as indicators of environmental intrinsic resistance and tolerance levels.,https://www.ncbi.nlm.nih.gov/pubmed/30933767,"Environmental pollution (Barking, Essex : 1987)",2019 05 22,"Antibiotic resistance (AR) in the environment is a growing and global concern for public health, and intrinsic AR from pristine sites untouched by pharmaceutical antibiotics is not commonly studied.

Resistance to one or two antibiotics were equally found in 37.5%, while the remaining 22% showed complete sensitivity. Intermediate resistance was found for ceftriaxone (52.5%), nalidixic acid (37.5%) and carbenicillin (22.5%), while low levels of resistance were observed for streptomycin (5%) and kanamycin (2.5%), and total sensitivity towards the other antibiotics. Twenty-nine isolates were also tested against eight different heavy-metal salts (Al, Cr, Cu, Fe, Hg, Mn, Ni and Pb) at 10 and 40 mM. All isolates were tolerant and able to grow on ≥2 heavy-metal salts at both concentrations. No association was observed between AR and heavy metal tolerance (HMT). Based on the relatively low AR levels, hot spring sites are pristine environments reflecting baseline levels for comparison to other potentially contaminated groundwater sites."

PM2.5 samples covering four seasons from Jan. 2016 to Jan. 2017 were collected at six sites in Chifeng, a representative agro-pastoral transitional zone of North China focusing on the characteristics and sources of organic carbon (OC) and elemental carbon (EC). The annual averages of OC, EC were 9.00 ± 7.24 μg m-3, 1.06 ± 0.79 μg m-3 with site Songshan in coal mining region exhibited significantly enhanced levels. The residential heating emissions, air stagnation, and secondary organic formation all contributed the higher OC, EC levels in winter. Meanwhile, the impacts from open biomass burning were most intensive in spring. The retroplumes via Lagrangian model highlighted a strong seasonality of regional sources which had more impacts on EC increases. The Positive Matrix Factorization (PMF) model resolved six primary sources, namely, coal combustion, biomass burning, industrial processes, oil combustion, fugitive dust, and fireworks. Coal combustion and biomass burning comprised large fractions of OC (30.57%, 30.40%) and EC (23.26%, 38.47%) across the sites, while contributions of industrial processes and oil combustion clearly increased in the sites near industrial sources as smelters. PMF and EC tracer method gave well correlated (r=0.65) estimates of Secondary OC (SOC). The proportion of coal combustion and SOC were more enhanced along with PM2.5 elevation compared to other sources, suggesting their importances during the pollution events.",Hyperbranched polymeric nanomaterials impair the freshwater crustacean Daphnia magna.,https://www.ncbi.nlm.nih.gov/pubmed/30933755,"Environmental pollution (Barking, Essex : 1987)",2019 05 22,"Hyperbranched polymers are nanomaterials belonging to the class of dendritic architectures with increasing applications in many diverse fields. We studied the toxicity of two hyperbranched polymers to the freshwater crustacean Daphnia magna. A hyperbranched hydroxyl-terminated polyester and a commercial hyperbranched polyamidoamine, Helux-3316 were tested for the acute immobilization of daphnids, the overproduction of reactive oxygen species and the activity of the antioxidant enzymes catalase and glutathione S-transferase. The effect for D. magna immobilization was higher for the hyperbranched polyamidoamine Helux-3316, which was attributed to the presence of primary amino groups on its surface. Following exposure to both hyperbranched polymers, a clear overproduction of reactive oxygen species took place accompanied by concentration-dependent enzymatic antioxidant response. Our results showed that the overproduction of reactive oxygen species activated antioxidant defence mechanisms and was responsible for the immobilization of daphnids exposed to both hyperbranched polymers. We showed evidence of the uptake of fluorescently labelled Helux-3316 that accumulated into the gastrointestinal tract of D. magna, and its removal via excretion within fecal pellets. This is the first work reporting the internalization of hyperbranched polymers in aquatic organisms.","Determination of influencing factors on historical concentration variations of PAHs in West Taihu Lake, China.",https://www.ncbi.nlm.nih.gov/pubmed/30933754,"Environmental pollution (Barking, Essex : 1987)",2019 05 22,"The adsorption of polycyclic aromatic hydrocarbons (PAHs) by components such as elemental carbon (EC), total organic carbon (TOC), and particles is different, and EC and PAHs are good materials for reconstructing historical human activity patterns and pollution conditions. In this study, the effects of EC (soot and char), TOC and particles of different grain size on PAHs in surface sediments were quantitatively analysed, and their historical concentrations in a sediment core from western Taihu Lake were reconstructed. The contents of soot, TOC, clay, EC and char explained 57.2%, 27.6%, 26.0%, 24.0% and 16.4%, respectively, of the PAH concentrations in surface sediments. The correlation between the soot and PAH levels was significantly higher than that between the char, TOC, and clay contents and PAH levels, and PAHs were mainly affected by the local economic development and human activity, as indicated by metrics of population, highway mileage, coal burning, and industrial output. With the development of the economy of the Taihu Lake Basin, the composition of PAHs in the sediments has changed: the proportion of low-molecular-weight PAHs decreased from 42.4% to 17.5%, and that of high-molecular-weight PAHs increased from 58.7% to 82.5%. The concentration of PAHs in pore water from Taihu Lake over the past 100 years was reconstructed and ranged from 43.1 to 961.2 μg L-1, with an average of 180.7 μg L-1. After China's reform and opening up, the concentrations of various PAHs in Taihu Lake changed from safe to chronic pollution levels. The ratios of lead (Pb) isotopes and the diagnostic ratios of PAHs showed that the main sources of PAHs in western Taihu Lake sediments were human activities such as coal and petroleum combustion.",Indoor vs. outdoor airborne element array: A novel approach using moss bags to explore possible pollution sources.,https://www.ncbi.nlm.nih.gov/pubmed/30933753,"Environmental pollution (Barking, Essex : 1987)",2019 05 22,"This study investigated by the moss-bag approach the pattern of air dispersed elements in 12 coupled indoor/outdoor exposure sites, all located in urban and rural residential areas. The aims were to discriminate indoor vs. outdoor element composition in coupled exposure sites and find possible relation between moss elemental profile and specific characteristics of each exposure site. Elements were considered enriched when in 60% of the sites, post-exposure concentration exceeded pre-exposure concentration plus two folds the standard deviation. Of the 53 analyzed elements, 15 (As, B, Ca, Co, Cr, Cu, Mn, Mo, Ni, Sb, Se, Sn, Sr, V, Zn) were enriched in moss exposed outdoor, whereas a subset of 7 elements (As, B, Cr, Mo, Ni, Se, V) were enriched also in indoor moss samples. The cluster analysis of the sites based on all elements, clearly separated samples in two groups corresponding to mosses exposed indoor and outdoor, with the latter generally exceeding the first. Among outdoor sites, urban were most impacted than rural; whereas other factors (e.g., heating and cooking systems, building material, residence time and family life style) could affect element profile of indoor environments. Based on the indoor/outdoor ratio, As derived from outdoor and indoor sources, B, Mo and Se were enriched mostly in outdoor sites; Ni, Cr and V were specifically enriched in most indoor samples, supporting the presence of indoor emitting sources for these elements. A PCA of all indoor sites based on enriched elements and site characteristics showed that traffic affected indoor pollution in urban areas. The moss bag approach provided useful information for a global assessment of human exposure.",A single indicator of noxiousness for people and ecosystems exposed to stable and radioactive substances.,https://www.ncbi.nlm.nih.gov/pubmed/30933752,"Environmental pollution (Barking, Essex : 1987)",2019 05 22,"Inspired by methods used for life cycle impact assessment (LCIA), we constructed a series of indicators to appreciate the noxiousness of radioactive materials and wastes for human and ecosystem health. According to known potential human health and ecological effects of such materials, six main impact categories were considered to initiate the development of the method: human cancer and non-cancer effects vs. ecotoxicity, considering both chemotoxicity and radiotoxicity. For ecosystems, the noxiousness indicator is based on the concept of Potentially Affected Fraction (PAF), used as a damage indicator at the ecosystem level. The PAF express the toxic pressure on the environment due to one substance. It has been enlarged to mixtures of substances as multi-substances PAF (ms-PAF), and applied to a mix of stable and radioactive substances. Combining ecotoxicity data and a simplified model of exposure of fauna and flora, we proposed a chemotoxicity indicator and a radiotoxicity indicator, ultimately aggregated into a single indicator simply by addition. According to acknowledged practices in LCIA and corresponding available data, we suggested implementing to human health an approach similar to that applied to ecosystems. We produced eigth basic indicators combining effects categories (cancer and non cancer), exposure pathways (ingestion and inhlation) and substances (chemicals and radionuclides). The principle of additivity supporting the whole proposed approach allows their complete aggregation into a single indicator also for human health. Different source terms may be then easily directly compared in terms of human and ecological noxiousness. Applied to the time evolution of a High Level radioactive Waste (HLW), the method confirmed over 1 million years the dominance of the radiotoxicity in the noxiousness of the material for both humans and environment. However there is a change with time in the ranking of the most noxious substances, with stable metals contribution going progressively up. Finally, the HLW global noxiousness, integrating human health and ecological aspects, was assessed through time at three stages and showed a temporal decrease as expected from the dominance of the radiotoxicity.",Occupational exposure to volatile organic compounds and health risks in Colorado nail salons.,https://www.ncbi.nlm.nih.gov/pubmed/30933751,"Environmental pollution (Barking, Essex : 1987)",2019 05 22,"Nail salon technicians face chronic exposure to volatile organic compounds (VOCs), which can lead to adverse health outcomes including cancer. In this study, indoor levels of formaldehyde, as well as benzene, toluene, ethylbenzene and xylene, were measured in 6 Colorado nail salons. Personal exposure VOC measurements and health questionnaires (n = 20) were also performed; questionnaires included employee demographics, health symptoms experienced, and protective equipment used. Cancer slope factors from the United States Environmental Protection Agency (US EPA) and anthropometric data from the Centers for Disease Control and Prevention were then used to estimate cancer risk for workers, assuming 20-yr exposures to concentrations of benzene and formaldehyde reported here. Results show that 70% of surveyed workers experienced at least one health issue related to their employment, with many reporting multiple related symptoms. Indoor concentrations of formaldehyde ranged from 5.32 to 20.6 μg m-3, across all 6 salons. Indoor concentrations of toluene ranged from 26.7 to 816 μg m-3, followed by benzene (3.13-51.8 μg m-3), xylenes (5.16-34.6 μg m-3), and ethylbenzene (1.65-9.52 μg m-3). Formaldehyde levels measured in one salon exceeded the Recommended Exposure Limit from the National Institute for Occupational Safety and Health. Cancer risk estimates from formaldehyde exposure exceeded the US EPA de minimis risk level (1 × 10-6) for squamous cell carcinoma, nasopharyngeal cancer, Hodgkin's lymphoma, and leukemia; leukemia risk exceeded 1 × 10-4 in one salon. The average leukemia risk from benzene exposure also exceeded the US EPA de minimis risk level for all demographic categories modeled. In general, concentrations of aromatic compounds measured here were comparable to those measured in studies of oil refinery and auto garage workers.

Here, we present novel MoS2-integrated silica colloidal crystal barcode (SCCB) for multiplex microRNA (miRNA) screening. MoS2 was adsorbed on SCCBs by electrostatic interaction, and quantum dots (QDs) decorated hairpin probes were coupled on MoS2 by covalent linkage. As the MoS2 could quench the QDs of the hairpin probes, they together formed a molecular beacon (MB) structure before the detection. When used in assays, target miRNA could form a double strand with the probe and made QDs keep away from MoS2 sheets to recovery their fluorescence. Because the released QDs were positively correlated with the concentration of the hybridized nucleic acid, the target miRNAs could be quantified by measuring the fluorescence signal of the QDs on the SCCBs. In addition, by utilizing different MoS2-integrated structural color encoded SCCBs, multiplexed miRNA quantification could also be realized.

The interaction and DNA damage induced by 7ESTAC01 was electrochemically studied based on the oxidation signals of the electroactive nucleic acids on the surface of the GE by DPV. As a result, the SL-DNA/GE and dsDNA/GE were tested with the reduced 7ESTAC01, showing the voltammetric signal of guanine and adenine, increase in the presence of 7ESTAC01. Under optimum conditions, the dsDNA/GE biosensor exhibited excellent DPV response in the presence of 7ESTAC01. The bonding interaction between 7ESTAC01 and calf thymus DNA (ctDNA) was confirmed by UV-Vis absorption spectroscopy, dynamic simulations (performed to investigate the DNA structure under physiological conditions), and molecular docking. Theoretical results showed the presence of hydrogen bonding and intercalation in the minor groove of DNA, involving hydrophobic interactions.",Comparison of scapular upward rotation during arm elevation in the scapular plane in healthy volunteers and patients with rotator cuff tears pre- and post-surgery.,https://www.ncbi.nlm.nih.gov/pubmed/30933709,"Clinical biomechanics (Bristol, Avon)",2019 04 20,"Function loss caused by rotator cuff tears alters the scapular orientation, however, few prior studies have reported on scapular movements after rotator cuff repair.

Specifically, two behavioral economic tasks (delay discounting, assessing preference for smaller, immediate or larger, delayed rewards; and purchasing, assessing purchases of commodities over changes in price) have been independently associated with conditions such as overweight/obesity and problem substance use. In the present study, we examined possible shared neural regions involved in the processes of delay discounting and demand for snack foods in a prediabetic sample. Fifty-four participants completed both of these tasks. Conjunction between delay discounting and purchasing task results indicates substantial common neural substrates recruited during these two tasks, consistent with interpretations of executive control, interoception, and attention, in the prefrontal cortex, insula, and frontoparietal cortex (superior/middle frontal cortex and superior/inferior parietal lobules), respectively. Collectively, these results suggest possible neural substrates in which the two behavioral risk factors of reinforcer pathology may interact during real-world decision-making in prediabetes.","Uncertainty in location, level and fundamental frequency results in informational masking in a vowel discrimination task for young and elderly subjects.",https://www.ncbi.nlm.nih.gov/pubmed/30933706,Hearing research,2019 05 12,"Informational masking (IM) is defined as the compromised ability to perceive and analyze signals from a single sound source in a cacophony of sounds from other sources even if the excitation patterns produced by these signals in the auditory periphery are well separated from those produced by the sounds from the other sources. IM that causes an elevation of discrimination thresholds is affected by the similarity between target and masker and by stimulus uncertainty. Here, six young and six elderly subjects were asked to discriminate between sequentially presented reference and target vowels of the vowel pairs /I/-/i/, /æ/-/ε/, and /α/-/Λ/. Psychometric functions were collected characterizing the discrimination of target vowels from reference vowels. Target vowels differed from the reference by one of seven steps shifting the three formants of a reference vowel towards the formants of the corresponding target vowel. Stimulus statistics were varied, generating uncertainty by non-informative but potentially distracting location, level, and fundamental frequency changes or all three combined. Young subjects tested with distracting changes applied to the target vowels only, the reference vowels only, or the target and reference vowels showed similar amounts of IM for all three conditions. Elderly subjects were tested with distracting changes applied to target vowels only. Applying uncertainty only to the target vowels led to worse vowel discrimination thresholds for young and elderly subjects and thresholds increased most for the three distracting changes combined. Elderly subjects showed higher vowel discrimination thresholds than young subjects, but the increase in vowel discrimination thresholds due to IM did not differ between young and elderly subjects. The temporal fine structure processing of elderly subjects was degraded in comparison to young subjects, but it was only correlated with the discrimination threshold for vowel pair /I/-/i/.",Adaptation to noise in amplitude modulation detection without the medial olivocochlear reflex.,https://www.ncbi.nlm.nih.gov/pubmed/30933705,Hearing research,2019 05 12,"The detection of amplitude modulation (AM) in quiet or in noise improves when the AM carrier is preceded by noise, an effect that has been attributed to the medial olivocochlear reflex (MOCR). We investigate whether this improvement can occur without the MOCR by measuring AM sensitivity for cochlear implant (CI) users, whose MOCR effects are circumvented as a result of the electrical stimulation provided by the CI. AM detection thresholds were measured monaurally for short (50 ms) AM probes presented at the onset (early condition) or delayed by 300 ms (late condition) from the onset of a broadband noise. The noise was presented ipsilaterally, contralaterally and bilaterally to the test ear. Stimuli were processed through an experimental, time-invariant sound processing strategy. On average, thresholds were 4 dB better in the late than in the early condition and the size of the improvement was similar for the three noise lateralities. The pattern and magnitude of the improvement was broadly consistent with that for normal hearing listeners [Marrufo-Pérez et al., 2018, J Assoc Res Otolaryngol 19:147-161]. Because the electrical stimulation provided by CIs is independent from the middle-ear muscle reflex (MEMR) or the MOCR, this shows that mechanisms other than the MEMR or the MOCR can facilitate AM detection in noisy backgrounds."

Behaviorally, individuals with higher executive function indexed by higher working memory capacity (WMC) exhibit less mind wandering during cognitive tasks, but the underlying neural mechanisms are unknown. To address this problem, we recorded functional magnetic resonance imaging (fMRI) data from subjects performing a cued visual attention task, and assessed their WMC in a separate experiment. Applying machine learning and time-series analysis techniques, we showed that (1) higher WMC individuals experienced lower internal distraction through stronger suppression of posterior cingulate cortex (PCC) activity, (2) higher WMC individuals had better neural representations of attended information as evidenced by higher multivoxel decoding accuracy of cue-related activities in the dorsal attention network (DAN), (3) the positive relationship between WMC and DAN decoding accuracy was mediated by suppression of PCC activity, (4) the dorsal anterior cingulate (dACC) was a source of top-down signals that regulate PCC activity as evidenced by the negative association between Granger-causal influence dACC→PCC and PCC activity levels, and (5) higher WMC individuals exhibiting stronger dACC→PCC Granger-causal influence. These results shed light on the neural mechanisms underlying the executive suppression of internal distraction in tasks requiring externally oriented attention and provide an explanation of the individual differences in such suppression.",pH-responsive and self-targeting assembly from hyaluronic acid-based conjugate toward all-in-one chemo-photodynamic therapy.,https://www.ncbi.nlm.nih.gov/pubmed/30933691,Journal of colloid and interface science,2019 04 27,"Chemo-photodynamic therapy is an attractive strategy against cancer. However, the combination of chemotherapeutic agent and photosensitizer is usually realized by physically embedding one or two agents in the carriers. In this case, batch to batch variation of drug contents increases the risk of composition uncertainty, limiting the clinical application of currently developed chemo-photodynamic therapy. Therefore, it is highly desirable for constructing chemo-photodynamic therapy nanoplatform with precisely controllable composition and drug loading content. Here, a precise chemo-photodynamic therapy nanoplatform is reported based on the chemical conjugation of both doxorubicin (DOX) and photosensitizer chlorin e6 (Ce6) to active targeting hyaluronic acid (HA). The achieved HA-DOX-Ce6 (HDC) conjugate can self-assemble into all-in-one nanoparticles (NPs) with properties of pH-response, self-targeting delivery, near-infrared (NIR) fluorescence imaging and chemo-photodynamic combination therapy. Because HDC conjugate holds precise components, the HDC NPs have a constant composition and drug loading content, endowing a precise chemo-photodynamic therapy nanoplatform. The HDC NPs show significantly higher cellular uptake and remarkably better tumor-targeted accumulation than free drugs. Moreover, HDC NPs with the laser irradiation exhibit enhanced anticancer activities both in vitro and in vivo. This work may open the door for design of all-in-one advanced nanoplatform toward chemo-photodynamic therapy with precisely controllable composition and drug loading content.","C-doped anatase TiO2: Adsorption kinetics and photocatalytic degradation of methylene blue and phenol, and correlations with DFT estimations.",https://www.ncbi.nlm.nih.gov/pubmed/30933690,Journal of colloid and interface science,2019 04 29,"This work shows an easy and eco-friendly methodology to obtain almost pristine anatase phase of TiO2 by using furfural, a biomass-derived molecule, as a bio-template. The photocatalytic activity was studied following the degradation of methylene blue and phenol under artificial solar irradiation. Results were compared against those obtained on a commercial pristine anatase TiO2. The pseudo first-order, the second-order and the intraparticle diffusion kinetic models were verified. The textural and surface chemistry properties of the materials were correlated with the surface density of molecules adsorbed in equilibrium. The reaction-rate showed an almost perfect quadratic regression as a function of the surface density. Theoretical estimations of the density of states by DFT + U were performed showing that the total electron charge in the oxygen bonded to anatase TiO2 increased due to carbon doping in agreement with the prediction of appearance of atomic orbitals 2p from carbon atom in the hybrid material. C-doping is responsible of the red-shift from 3.14 to 2.94 eV observed for a Ti15O32C super-cell than pristine anatase Ti16O32.

Their reproductive biology comprises noteworthy characteristics, such as long-term sperm storage, delayed implantation or even delayed fetal development. The understanding of these mechanisms remains limited. Research in reproductive biology may become crucial for the conservation of endangered bat species. Indeed, the IUCN Red List of Threatened Species currently lists 76 bat species as endangered or critically endangered, for which conservation measures should be taken. The development of assisted reproductive technologies (ART) in bats would thus open new perspectives. In this context we here describe the first successful cryopreservation of bat sperm in the Seba's short-tailed bat (Carollia perspicillata). Epididymal sperm of 30 males was pooled in 6 sample sets and diluted using four different cryo-diluents: Canifreeze, modified Canifreeze, BotuCrio® and Test egg yolk extender. Glycerol and a mixture of glycerol and methylformamide were used as cryoprotectants. Best post-thaw results were achieved when sperm was diluted in Test egg yolk extender containing a mixture of glycerol and methylformamide as cryoprotectant. Post-thaw sperm motility, progressive motility and acrosome integrity of 42.0 ± 3.4%, 28.3 ± 6.3% and 87.7 ± 1.7%, respectively were superior to all other variants tested. It remains to be determined if the post-thaw quality of cryopreserved bat spermatozoa achieved in this study is sufficient for the use in artificial inseminations and produces acceptable pregnancy rates. Successful cryopreservation of spermatozoa in C. perspicillata may serve as the first model to establish gamete rescue programs and develop ART in other, critically endangered bat species.","Occurrence, genotypes and antimicrobial susceptibility of Salmonella collected from the broiler production chain within an integrated poultry company.",https://www.ncbi.nlm.nih.gov/pubmed/30933685,International journal of food microbiology,2019 05 31,"Salmonella is a common foodborne pathogen in the poultry production systems. Its presence in this food industry is determined by the fact that it can survive and pass throughout the different steps in the poultry production. In this study we aimed to study the occurrence, genotypes and antimicrobial resistance of Salmonella collected from the broiler production chain within an integrated poultry company. Three hundred fourteen samples were collected in the feeding plant, farms and the slaughterhouse. Samples were cultured for Salmonella isolation according to the ISO6579/Amd 1. Isolates were further typed by Kauffmann-White scheme and pulse field gel electrophoresis (PFGE). Antimicrobial resistance to 11 antimicrobials was studied by disk diffusion tests and sequencing of ESBL genes. From the collected samples 70 (22%) were found to be Salmonella positive. The lowest Salmonella rates were found in feed samples while in farm and slaughterhouse samples Salmonella presence ranged from 5% to 88%. S. Infantis was the most common serotype (94%, 66/70). PFGE demonstrated that isolates belonged to 11 genotypes. Some genotypes were continuously identified throughout the production chain. 97% of the isolates showed resistance to at least one antimicrobial. Moreover, all S. Infantis isolates and one auto-agglutinable isolate showed resistance to at least 6 antimicrobials. 30 and 8 isolates were positive to blaCTX-M-65 and blaCTX-M-14 genes respectively. No blaKPC resistance genes were identified in any isolate. This study highlights the predominance of S. Infantis in the integrated poultry company. Genotypes showed that cross-contamination between stages of poultry production can occur, stressing the importance of implementing good hygiene practices in every level of the production. Moreover, multidrug resistance patterns and the presence of important ESBL genes have public health implications that need to be deeply discussed with a one health approach.",Use of Advance Care Planning Billing Codes for Hospitalized Older Adults at High Risk of Dying: A National Observational Study.,https://www.ncbi.nlm.nih.gov/pubmed/30933674,Journal of hospital medicine,2019 04 04,"We analyzed advance care planning (ACP) billing for adults aged 65 years or above and who were managed by a large national physician practice that employs acute care providers in hospital medicine, emergency medicine and critical care between January 1, 2017 and March 31, 2017.

There are many precipitants to this behavior, with dissociation receiving increasing attention. The current study examined the quartile risk model for predicting deliberate self-harm, which proposes that four quadrants of dissociation (low normative, high normative, low clinical, and high clinical) represent varying levels of risk for engagement in DSH. The model posits that quadrants one and three (low normative, low clinical), protect against engagement in deliberate self-harm. Quadrants two and four (high normative, high clinical), represent an increased risk of engaging in DSH. The current study also investigated the association between shame and deliberate self-harm. College students (n = 247) completed measures assessing trait dissociation, state and trait shame, and deliberate self-harm. Results did not support the quartile risk model, rather they suggested a general increasing level of deliberate self-harm with heightened dissociation. Furthermore, trait shame was significantly associated with deliberate self-harm. Significantly more state shame was found to occur before engaging in deliberate self-harm relative to after. Results suggest shame and dissociation are related to increased DSH.","Systematic study of truffles in the genus Ruhlandiella, with the description of two new species from Patagonia.",https://www.ncbi.nlm.nih.gov/pubmed/30933659,Mycologia,2019 06 10,"Ruhlandiella is a genus of exothecial, ectomycorrhizal fungi in the order Pezizales.

Generally, this disease is considered to be caused by Claviceps purpurea, but the taxonomy of Claviceps from these areas has not been well studied. The objectives of this study were (i) to determine the phylogenetic lineages (phylogenetic species) present in agricultural areas of Canada and (ii) to develop a molecular assay that can separate the lineages on crops from other lineages. Genetic diversity of Claviceps collected from agriculture areas in Canada were investigated using multilocus sequence typing. The loci sequenced include nuc rDNA internal transcribed spacer (ITS1-5.8S-ITS2 = ITS), partial fragments of translation elongation factor 1-α (TEF1), RNA polymerase II second largest subunit (RPB2), β-tubulin (tubB), and two ergot alkaloid synthesis genes (easA, easE). Based on individual locus and concatenated alignments, phylogenetic analyses revealed seven lineages within the premolecular concept of C. purpurea, of which five corresponded with undescribed species (G2b and G4-7). Although lineages G2-7 had narrow host ranges, lineage G1 (= C. purpurea s.s.) had a broad host range that overlapped with other lineages. A molecular diagnostic quantitative polymerase chain reaction (qPCR) assay was developed and validated with 185 samples from a wide range of host plants and geographic origins, including 10 phylogenetic species in C. sect. Claviceps, 8 in C. sect. Pusillae, 1 in C. sect. Citrinae, and 1-2 species from Alternaria, Fusarium, and Penicillium.

Light detection is hypothesized to occur via photoreceptors located on sea urchin tube feet, and opsins have been detected in tube feet, spines, and the test. However, the molecular mechanisms underlying light detection are, for the most part, unknown. Individual tube feet disc cells were isolated from purple sea urchins (Strongylocentrotus purpuratus), and the electrical responses of these cells to varying levels of illumination were quantified using the patch clamp technique. No currents were observed under bright illumination, whereas under dark conditions, large, slowly activating currents were consistently observed. Two types of cells were functionally identified based on their responses to darkness. Type I cells sustained currents indefinitely in the dark, whereas Type II cell currents spontaneously decayed after several seconds. The large currents observed were composed of the summation of many smaller events that were characterized by a rapid onset and an exponentially decaying component, which may be indicative of direct vesicular release from the tube feet disc cells in response to the dark conditions.",Contrasting Metatrochal Behavior of Mollusc and Annelid Larvae and the Regulation of Feeding While Swimming.,https://www.ncbi.nlm.nih.gov/pubmed/30933637,The Biological bulletin,2019 04 16,"Molluscan veliger larvae and some annelid larvae capture particulate food between a preoral prototrochal band of long cilia that create a current for both swimming and feeding and a postoral metatrochal band of shorter cilia that beat toward the prototroch. Larvae encountering satiating or noxious particles must somehow swim without capturing particles or else reject large numbers of captured particles. Because high rates of particle capture are inferred to depend on the beat of both ciliary bands, arrest of the metatroch could be one way to swim while reducing captures. Larvae in eight families of annelids arrest metatrochal cilia frequently during prototrochal beat, often over a large part of the metatrochal band and with the arrested cilia aligned near the beginning of the effective stroke. In contrast, metatrochs of veligers of gastropods and bivalves rarely arrested while the prototroch beat, and those arrests were more localized and variable in position. This difference in metatrochal arrest was unexpected under hypotheses of either a single origin of this feeding mechanism or multiple origins within each phylum. Although different in metatrochal arrests, larvae of both phyla can separate swimming from feeding while both prototroch and metatroch beat. One hypothesis explaining low rates of capture per encounter, without metatrochal arrest, is a change in adhesion of prototrochal cilia with algae. In a few observations, part of the velar edge was retained within the veliger's shell so that exposed prototrochal cilia contributed to swimming while the adjacent metatroch and food groove were sequestered.",GABA as a Neurotransmitter in Gastropod Molluscs.,https://www.ncbi.nlm.nih.gov/pubmed/30933636,The Biological bulletin,2019 04 16,"The neurotransmitter gamma-aminobutyric acid (GABA) is widely distributed in the mammalian central nervous system, where it acts as a major mediator of synaptic inhibition. GABA also serves as a neurotransmitter in a range of invertebrate phyla, including arthropods, echinoderms, annelids, nematodes, and platyhelminthes. This article reviews evidence supporting the neurotransmitter role of GABA in gastropod molluscs, with an emphasis on its presence in identified neurons and well-characterized neural circuits. The collective findings indicate that GABAergic signaling participates in the selection and specification of motor programs, as well as the bilateral coordination of motor circuits. While relatively few in number, GABAergic neurons can influence neural circuits via inhibitory, excitatory, and modulatory synaptic actions. GABA's colocalization with peptidergic and classical neurotransmitters can broaden its integrative capacity. The functional properties of GABAergic neurons in simpler gastropod systems may provide insight into the role of this neurotransmitter phenotype in more complex brains.",Open-Ended Technological Innovation.,https://www.ncbi.nlm.nih.gov/pubmed/30933632,Artificial life,2019 04 01,"We detect ongoing innovation in empirical data about human technological innovations. Ongoing technological innovation is a form of open-ended evolution, but it occurs in a nonbiological, cultural population that consists of actual technological innovations that exist in the real world. The change over time of this population of innovations seems to be quite open-ended. We take patented inventions as a proxy for technological innovations and mine public patent records for evidence of the ongoing emergence of technological innovations, and we compare two ways to detect it. One way detects the first instances of predefined patent pigeonholes, specifically the technology classes listed in the United States Patent Classification (USPC). The second way embeds patents in a high-dimensional semantic space and detects the emergence of new patent clusters. After analyzing hundreds of years of patent records, both methods detect the emergence of new kinds of technologies, but clusters are much better at detecting innovations that are unanticipated and undetected by USPC pigeonholes. Our clustering methods generalize to detect unanticipated innovations in other evolving populations that generate ongoing streams of digital data.","Evolved Open-Endedness, Not Open-Ended Evolution.",https://www.ncbi.nlm.nih.gov/pubmed/30933631,Artificial life,2019 04 01,"Open-endedness is often considered a prerequisite property of the whole evolutionary system and its dynamical behaviors. In the actual history of evolution on Earth, however, there are many examples showing that open-endedness is rather a consequence of evolution. We suggest that this view, which we call evolved open-endedness (EOE), be incorporated more into research on open-ended evolution. This view should allow for systematic investigation of more nuanced, more concrete research questions about open-endedness and its relationship with adaptation and sustainability.",Escalation of Memory Length in Finite Populations.,https://www.ncbi.nlm.nih.gov/pubmed/30933630,Artificial life,2019 04 01,"The escalation of complexity is a commonly cited benefit of coevolutionary systems, but computational simulations generally fail to demonstrate this capacity to a satisfactory degree. We draw on a macroevolutionary theory of escalation to develop a set of criteria for coevolutionary systems to exhibit escalation of strategic complexity. By expanding on a previously developed model of the evolution of memory length for cooperative strategies by Kristian Lindgren, we resolve previously observed limitations on the escalation of memory length by extending operators of evolutionary variation. We present long-term coevolutionary simulations showing that larger population sizes tend to support greater escalation of complexity than smaller ones do. Additionally, we investigate the sensitivity of escalation during transitions of complexity. The Lindgren model has often been used to argue that the escalation of competitive coevolution has intrinsic limitations. Our simulations show that coevolutionary arms races can continue to escalate in computational simulations given sufficient population sizes.",Two Modes of Evolution: Optimization and Expansion.,https://www.ncbi.nlm.nih.gov/pubmed/30933629,Artificial life,2019 04 01,"We document and discuss two different modes of evolution across multiple systems, optimization and expansion. The former suffices in systems whose size and interactions do not change substantially over time, while the latter is a key property of open-ended evolution, where new players and interaction types enter the game. We first investigate systems from physics, biology, and engineering and argue that their evolutionary optimization dynamics is the cumulative effect of multiple independent events, or quakes, which are uniformly distributed on a logarithmic time scale and produce a decelerating fitness improvement when using the appropriate independent variable. The appropriate independent variable can be physical time for a disordered magnetic system, the number of generations for a bacterial system, or the number of produced units for a particular technological product. We then derive and discuss a simple microscopic theory that explains the nature of the involved optimization processes, and provide simulation results as illustration. Finally, we explore the evolution of human culture and technology, using empirical economic data as a proxy for human fitness. Assuming the overall dynamics is a combined optimization and expansion process, the two processes can be separated and quantified by superimposing the mathematical form of an optimization process on the empirical data and thereby transforming the independent variable. This variable turns out to increase faster than any exponential function of time, a property likely due to strong historical changes in the web of human interactions and to the associated increase in the amount of available knowledge. A microscopic theory for this time dependence remains, however, a challenging open problem.",Open-Ended Evolution and Open-Endedness: Editorial Introduction to the Open-Ended Evolution I Special Issue.,https://www.ncbi.nlm.nih.gov/pubmed/30933628,Artificial life,2019 04 01,"Nature's spectacular inventiveness, reflected in the enormous diversity of form and function displayed by the biosphere, is a feature of life that distinguishes living most strongly from nonliving. It is, therefore, not surprising that this aspect of life should become a central focus of artificial life. We have known since Darwin that the diversity is produced dynamically, through the process of evolution; this has led life's creative productivity to be called Open-Ended Evolution (OEE) in the field. This article introduces the first of two special issues on current research on OEE and on the more general concept of open-endedness. Most of the papers presented in these special issues are elaborations of work presented at the Third Workshop on Open-Ended Evolution, held in Tokyo as part of the 2018 Conference on Artificial Life.",Evolving Complexity in Prediction Games.,https://www.ncbi.nlm.nih.gov/pubmed/30933627,Artificial life,2019 04 01,"To study open-ended coevolution, we define a complexity metric over interacting finite state machines playing formal language prediction games, and study the dynamics of populations under competitive and cooperative interactions. In the past purely competitive and purely cooperative interactions have been studied extensively, but neither can successfully and continuously drive an arms race. We present quantitative results using this complexity metric and analyze the causes of varying rates of complexity growth across different types of interactions. We find that while both purely competitive and purely cooperative coevolution are able to drive complexity growth above the rate of genetic drift, mixed systems with both competitive and cooperative interactions achieve significantly higher evolved complexity.",The MODES Toolbox: Measurements of Open-Ended Dynamics in Evolving Systems.,https://www.ncbi.nlm.nih.gov/pubmed/30933626,Artificial life,2019 04 01,"Building more open-ended evolutionary systems can simultaneously advance our understanding of biology, artificial life, and evolutionary computation. In order to do so, however, we need a way to determine when we are moving closer to this goal. We propose a set of metrics that allow us to measure a system's ability to produce commonly-agreed-upon hallmarks of open-ended evolution: change potential, novelty potential, complexity potential, and ecological potential. Our goal is to make these metrics easy to incorporate into a system, and comparable across systems so that we can make coherent progress as a field. To this end, we provide detailed algorithms (including C++ implementations) for these metrics that should be easy to incorporate into existing artificial life systems. Furthermore, we expect this toolbox to continue to grow as researchers implement these metrics in new languages and as the community reaches consensus about additional hallmarks of open-ended evolution. For example, we would welcome a measurement of a system's potential to produce major transitions in individuality. To confirm that our metrics accurately measure the hallmarks we are interested in, we test them on two very different experimental systems: NK landscapes and the Avida digital evolution platform. We find that our observed results are consistent with our prior knowledge about these systems, suggesting that our proposed metrics are effective and should generalize to other systems."

We used claims data for 2014-16 to examine trends in treatment for opioid use disorder (OUD) among people enrolled in the West Virginia Medicaid expansion program under the Affordable Care Act. Expanding Medicaid could provide services to populations that may previously have had limited access to OUD treatment. We thus sought to understand trends over time in OUD diagnosis and treatment, especially with medications. About 5.5 percent of all enrollees were diagnosed with OUD per year, and the monthly prevalence of OUD diagnoses nearly tripled during this three-year period. The ratio of people filling buprenorphine to the number diagnosed with OUD was around one-third in early 2014, increasing to more than 75 percent by late 2016. Mean annual duration of filled buprenorphine increased from 161 days in 2014 to 185 days in 2016, and most people filling buprenorphine also received counseling and drug testing during the study period. The growing use of medication treatment for OUD in the West Virginia Medicaid expansion population provides an opportunity to reduce overdose deaths.",Knowledge Of Practicing Physicians About Their Legal Obligations When Caring For Patients With Disability.,https://www.ncbi.nlm.nih.gov/pubmed/30933590,Health affairs (Project Hope),2019 04 01,"Disability civil rights laws require equitable treatment of the approximately sixty-one million Americans with disability. However, federal reports and numerous research studies indicate that this diverse and growing population often experiences health care disparities. To examine one possible contributing factor, we interviewed practicing physicians to explore their knowledge of their obligations to accommodate patients with disability under federal civil rights law. Interviewees reported having had little formal training about, and demonstrated superficial or incorrect understanding of, their obligations in three potentially problematic areas: deciding which accommodations their practices should implement, refusing patients with disability, and holding patients accountable for costs of accommodations. The fact that practicing physicians might not fully understand their legal responsibilities when caring for people with disability may contribute to persisting inequity in their care, and it suggests that further education in the Americans with Disabilities Act and other disability civil rights laws may be warranted.",Assessing First Visits By Physicians To Medicare Patients Discharged To Skilled Nursing Facilities.,https://www.ncbi.nlm.nih.gov/pubmed/30933588,Health affairs (Project Hope),2019 04 01,"Although approximately one in five Medicare beneficiaries are discharged from hospital acute care to postacute care at skilled nursing facilities (SNFs), little is known about access to timely medical care for these patients after they are admitted to a SNF. Our analysis of 2,392,753 such discharges from hospitals under fee-for-service Medicare in the period January 2012-October 2014 indicated that first visits by a physician or advanced practitioner (a nurse practitioner or physician assistant) for initial medical assessment occurred within four days of SNF admission in 71.5 percent of the stays. However, there was considerable variation in days to first visit at the regional, facility, and patient levels. We estimated that in 10.4 percent of stays there was no physician or advanced practitioner visit. Understanding the underlying reasons for, and consequences of, variability in timing and receipt of initial medical assessment after admission to a SNF for postacute care may prove important for improving patient outcomes and particularly relevant to current efforts to promote value-based purchasing in postacute care.",Behavioral And Other Chronic Conditions Among Adult Medicaid Enrollees: Implications For Work Requirements.,https://www.ncbi.nlm.nih.gov/pubmed/30933585,Health affairs (Project Hope),2019 04 01,"Work requirements condition Medicaid eligibility on completing a specified number of hours of employment, work search, job training, or community service. Little is known about how behavioral health and other chronic health conditions intersect with employment status among Medicaid enrollees who may be subject to work requirements. Using data from the National Survey on Drug Use and Health for the period 2014-16, we found that people with behavioral health and other chronic health conditions were more likely to be enrolled in Medicaid and subject to work requirements than those without any identified health conditions. Furthermore, among Medicaid enrollees, those with behavioral and other health conditions were also less likely to have worked twenty hours or more in the past week (and thus be more unlikely to meet work requirements). Our findings suggest that people who may be subject to the requirements have an elevated prevalence of behavioral and other chronic health conditions. If work requirements are to be a continued piece of Medicaid policy, policy changes must also be adopted to ensure that Medicaid covers a full continuum of evidence-based behavioral health services and that Medicaid enrollees with work-limiting conditions are given reasonable accommodations and exemptions.",Patient Readmission Rates For All Insurance Types After Implementation Of The Hospital Readmissions Reduction Program.,https://www.ncbi.nlm.nih.gov/pubmed/30933582,Health affairs (Project Hope),2019 04 01,"Since the implementation of the Hospital Readmissions Reduction Program (HRRP), readmissions have declined for Medicare patients with conditions targeted by the policy (acute myocardial infarction, heart failure, and pneumonia). To understand whether HRRP implementation was associated with a readmission decline for patients across all insurance types (Medicare, Medicaid, and private), we conducted a difference-in-differences analysis using information from the Nationwide Readmissions Database. We compared how quarterly readmissions for target conditions changed before (2010-12) and after (2012-14) HRRP implementation, using nontarget conditions as the control. Our results demonstrate that readmissions declined at a significantly faster rate after HRRP implementation not just for Medicare patients but also for those with Medicaid, both in the aggregate and for individual target conditions. However, composite Medicaid readmission rates remained higher than those for Medicare. Throughout the study period privately insured patients had the lowest aggregate readmission rates, which declined at a similar rate compared to nontarget conditions. The HRRP was associated with nationwide readmission reductions beyond the Medicare patients originally targeted by the policy. Further research is needed to understand the specific mechanisms by which hospitals have achieved reductions in readmissions.","The Role Of Social, Cognitive, And Functional Risk Factors In Medicare Spending For Dual And Nondual Enrollees.",https://www.ncbi.nlm.nih.gov/pubmed/30933581,Health affairs (Project Hope),2019 04 01,"The Centers for Medicare and Medicaid Services is increasingly focused on value-based payment programs, which tie payment to performance on quality and cost measures. In this context, there is rising concern that such programs systematically disadvantage providers that care for vulnerable populations, such as the poor, by holding the providers accountable for factors beyond their control that influence patient outcomes and utilization. In this nationally representative study of Medicare beneficiaries, we found that dually enrolled Medicare beneficiaries (those also enrolled in Medicaid) had strikingly higher levels of medical, functional, and cognitive comorbidities, as well as social needs, compared to their non-dually enrolled counterparts. Dual enrollees also had significantly higher annual costs of care. Including functional, cognitive, and social factors in cost prediction, in addition to risk factors derived from medical claims, improved risk prediction and decreased differences between dual and nondual enrollees. Medicare could consider such adjustment to improve accuracy and fairness in value-based payment programs.",My Struggle To Access Lifesaving Mental Health Care.,https://www.ncbi.nlm.nih.gov/pubmed/30933580,Health affairs (Project Hope),2019 04 01,A patient must overcome systemic hurdles to stay on the only effective treatment for her depression: ketamine.,The Association Between Hospital Concentration And Insurance Premiums In ACA Marketplaces.,https://www.ncbi.nlm.nih.gov/pubmed/30933578,Health affairs (Project Hope),2019 04 01,"Keeping the Affordable Care Act's health insurance Marketplaces financially accessible is critically important to their viability. While the relationship between the number of insurers and Marketplace premiums has received widespread attention, the role of hospital market concentration on premiums has been understudied. We examined the relationship between hospital market concentration and Marketplace insurance premiums in the period 2014-17, the extent to which the number of insurers modified this relationship, and whether community-level characteristics were associated with varying levels of concentration. We found that areas with the highest levels of hospital market concentration had annual premiums that were, on average, 5 percent higher than those in the least concentrated areas. Additionally, while an increased number of insurers was independently associated with lower premiums, that was not sufficient to offset the effects of increased hospital concentration on premium costs. Communities with lower socioeconomic status (as measured by median income) were more likely to have higher hospital market concentration. However, this was not consistent across all measures of socioeconomic status, such as measures of unemployment, use of the Supplemental Nutrition Assistance Program, and education. These findings help underscore the importance of exploring antitrust policy and other efforts that may reduce hospital concentration and help keep Marketplace premiums affordable.","Multimorbidity And Health Outcomes In Older Adults In Ten European Health Systems, 2006-15.",https://www.ncbi.nlm.nih.gov/pubmed/30933577,Health affairs (Project Hope),2019 04 01,"Despite the increase in awareness of chronic disease, little is known about whether multimorbidity-defined as two or more coexisting chronic conditions-has had a diminished impact on health in Europe in the past decade. We used multiple cross-sectional data from the Survey of Health, Ageing and Retirement in Europe to estimate changes in the prevalence of multimorbidity and in its association with health outcomes in ten European countries between 2006-07 and 2015. We found that the prevalence of multimorbidity rose from 38.2 percent in 2006-07 to 41.5 percent in 2015. Over the ten-year study period we also found a marginal reduction of the impact of multimorbidity on primary care visits and functional capacity. We did not find a reduction of its impact on hospital admissions and quality of life. Austria, the Czech Republic, Germany, and Spain were the countries that showed the largest reduction in the impact of multimorbidity on health outcomes.

Given the importance of the news media as a source of health information for the public and its role in shaping knowledge about these medications, we examined reporting on OUD medication treatment amid the opioid crisis. Analyzing news media reporting can provide insight into the public dialogue around this issue. Standardized search terms were used to query high-circulation/viewership US news sources in the period 2007-16 for stories about OUD medications. News reporting about the medications increased substantially in 2015-16. Local news coverage in states with high opioid overdose rates highlighted more negative than positive consequences of OUD medication use. Fewer than 40 percent of news stories about the medications mentioned that they were underused. Although addiction experts view underuse of OUD medications as a significant barrier to combating the opioid crisis, our findings suggest that underuse has not been framed as a problem in most news media reporting on these medications. Public health and addiction experts need to develop more effective strategies for disseminating information on the value of these medications in reducing opioid-related morbidity and mortality."

B,2019 04 27,"HSPA9, the gene coding for the mitochondrial chaperone mortalin, is involved in various cellular roles such as mitochondrial protein import, folding, degradation, Fe-S cluster biogenesis, mitochondrial homeostasis, and regulation of the antiapoptotic protein p53. Mutations in the HSPA9 gene, particularly within the region coding for the nucleotide-binding domain (NBD), cause the autosomal disorder known as EVEN-PLUS syndrome. The resulting mutants R126W and Y128C are located on the surface of the mortalin-NBD near the binding interface with the interdomain linker (IDL). We used differential scanning fluorimetry (DSF), biolayer interferometry, X-ray crystallography, ATP hydrolysis assays, and Rosetta docking simulations to study the structural and functional consequences of the EVEN-PLUS syndrome-associated R126W and Y128C mutations within the mortalin-NBD. These results indicate that the surface mutations R126W and Y128C have far-reaching effects that disrupt ATP hydrolysis, interdomain linker binding, and thermostability and increase the propensity for aggregation. The structural differences observed provide insight into how the conformations of mortalin differ from other heat shock protein 70 (Hsp70) homologues. Combined, our biophysical and structural studies contribute to the understanding of the molecular basis for how disease-associated mortalin mutations affect mortalin functionality and the pathogenesis of EVEN-PLUS syndrome.",The Clinical Utility of the Genomic Prostate Score in Men with Very Low to Intermediate Risk Prostate Cancer.,https://www.ncbi.nlm.nih.gov/pubmed/30933552,The Journal of urology,2019 06 12,We retrospectively investigated the Genomic Prostate Score® assay in clinical practice at an urban tertiary care academic center.,Biological activity of Echinops spinosus on inhibition of paracetamol-induced renal inflammation.,https://www.ncbi.nlm.nih.gov/pubmed/30933551,Biochemistry and cell biology = Biochimie et biologie cellulaire,2019 04 17,"This study was designed to evaluate the possible mechanisms through which Echinops spinosus (ES) extract demonstrates nephroprotective effect on the paracetamol acetominophen (N-acetyl-p-aminophenol (APAP)) induced nephrotoxicity in rats. Twenty-four Swiss albino rats were divided into four groups (six rats each). The placebo group was orally administered sterile saline, the APAP group received APAP (200 mg·kg-1·day-1 i.p.) daily, the ES group was given ES extract orally (250 mg/kg), and the APAP + ES group received APAP as for the APAP group and administrated the ES extract as for the ES group. Pretreatment of methyl alcohol extract of ES reduced the protein expression of inflammatory parameters including cyclooxygenase-2 and nuclear factor κB in the kidney. It also reduced the mRNA gene expression of tumor necrosis factor-α and interleukin-1β. The ES extract compensated for deficits in the total antioxidant activity, suppressed lipid peroxidation, and amended the APAP-induced histopathological kidney alterations. Moreover, ES treatment restored the elevated levels of urea nitrogen in the blood and creatinine in the serum by APAP. The ES extract attenuated the APAP-induced elevations in renal nitric oxide levels. We clarified that the ES extract has the potential to defend the kidney from APAP-induced inflammation, and the protection mechanism might be through decreasing oxidative stress and regulating the inflammatory signaling pathway through modulating key signaling inflammatory biomarkers.",Realizing the potential of magnetic resonance image guided radiotherapy in gynaecological and rectal cancer.,https://www.ncbi.nlm.nih.gov/pubmed/30933550,The British journal of radiology,2019 05 28,"CT-based radiotherapy workflow is limited by poor soft tissue definition in the pelvis and reliance on rigid registration methods.

Areas covered: This narrative review discusses the safety profile of SGLT2is: initial concerns (cardiovascular safety, acute renal failure, hypoglycemia, urinary and genital infections, volume depletion, bladder cancer), further concerns (euglycemic ketoacidosis, bone fractures) and more recent concerns (lower limb amputation, Fournier's gangrene). Expert opinion: Overall, the safety profile of SGLT2is is good. The only increased adverse event that was consistently reported in clinical trials and observational studies is genital mycotic infections, with only a borderline increase in urinary tract infections. Among clinical trials, only the CANVAS program reported an unexpected increase in bone fractures and peripheral amputations. A variety of rare adverse events have been described as case reports, including ketoacidosis, amputations and Fournier gangrene, which led to specific warnings by regulatory agencies. Identifying predisposing patient's characteristics and/or precipitating clinical conditions would help prevent the most severe complications. These adverse events should not mask the overall cardiovascular and renal benefit of SGLT2is, especially in patients with type 2 diabetes at high cardiovascular risk.","Trends in the use of psychoactive substances by truck drivers in São Paulo State, Brazil: A time-series cross sectional roadside survey (2009-2016).",https://www.ncbi.nlm.nih.gov/pubmed/30933546,Traffic injury prevention,2019 06 14,"Truck drivers represent a group that is susceptible to the use of stimulant substances to reduce the symptoms of fatigue, which may be caused by a stressful and exhausting work environment.

The surge of interest in immuno-oncology stems from recent clinical approvals and successes in clinical trials with new immuno-therapeutics and parallels a global trending interest in immunology. Among the current immunotherapeutic modalities, immune checkpoint inhibitors (ICPIs) are some of the most prominent agents that strengthens the activity of our adaptive immune system, and has demonstrated success in treating different types of cancer. With significant promises in melanoma and other solid tumors, ICPIs have also been evaluated in ovarian cancer (OC). Contrary to expectations, their efficacy for treating OC is unfortunately very low. Areas covered: In this review, immunotherapy response in OC will be evaluated in the context of disease genetics and epigenetics, with a focus on checkpoint blockade. Also, novel genetic and epigenetic therapies that show synergistic potential with current immunotherapies will be examined in detail. Expert opinion: The low response rate of OC to current immune checkpoint therapies may be due to the highly immunosuppressive tumor microenvironment (TME) of the disease.

In this study, we developed a simplified in vitro screening method to evaluate P-gp substrates by unidirectional membrane transport in P-gp-overexpressing cells. The unidirectional flux ratio positively correlated with parameters of the conventional bidirectional P-gp substrate assay ( R2 = 0.941) and in vivo Kp,brain ratio (mdr1a/1b KO/WT) in mice ( R2 = 0.800). Our in vitro P-gp substrate assay had high reproducibility and required approximately half the labor of the conventional method. We also constructed regression models to predict the value of P-gp-mediated flux and three-class classification models to predict P-gp substrate potential (low-, medium-, and high-potential) using 2397 data entries with the largest data set collected under the same experimental conditions. Most compounds in the test set fell within two- and three-fold errors in the random forest regression model (71.3 and 88.5%, respectively). Furthermore, the random forest three-class classification model showed a high balanced accuracy of 0.821 and precision of 0.761 for the low-potential classes in the test set. We concluded that the simplified in vitro P-gp substrate assay was suitable for compound screening in the early stages of drug discovery and that the in silico regression model and three-class classification model using only chemical structure information could identify the transport potential of compounds including P-gp-mediated flux ratios. Our proposed method is expected to be a practical tool to optimize effective central nervous system (CNS) drugs, to avoid CNS side effects, and to improve intestinal absorption.",Ellipsoidal Artificial Melanin Particles as Building Blocks for Biomimetic Structural Coloration.,https://www.ncbi.nlm.nih.gov/pubmed/30933525,Langmuir : the ACS journal of surfaces and colloids,2019 04 23,"Inspired by the structural coloration of anisotropic materials in nature, we demonstrate the preparation of structural color materials by the assembly of anisotropic particles. Spherical artificial melanin particles consisting of a polystyrene core and polydopamine shell were stretched asymmetrically to form uniform-sized ellipsoidal particles with different aspect ratios. The aspect ratio and assembly method of the ellipsoidal particles influence the structural coloration, indicating that the particle shape is one of the important parameters for controlling the structural coloration. The discovery of a method to control the structural color using ellipsoidal particles is useful in basic research on structural colors in nature and provides flexibility in material design and extends the application range of structural color materials.",A Guideline for Tailoring Lattice Oxygen Activity in Lithium-Rich Layered Cathodes by Strain.,https://www.ncbi.nlm.nih.gov/pubmed/30933524,The journal of physical chemistry letters,2019 05 02,"Lattice oxygen activity plays a dominant role in balancing discharge capacity and performance decay of lithium-rich layered oxide cathodes (LLOs). On the basis of density functional theory (DFT) and tight-binding theory, the activity of lattice oxygen can be improved by tensile strain and suppressed by compressive strain. To verify this conclusion, LLOs with large lattice parameters (L-LLOs) were synthesized taking advantage of the lattice expansion effect in nanomaterials. Compared with conventional LLOs with small lattice parameters (S-LLOs), particles in L-LLOs are imposed by tensile strain. L-LLOs show a larger initial discharge capacity and decay faster in the prolonged cycles than S-LLOs. Actually, most of the modified methods in LLOs can come down to strain-induced changes in lattice parameters. We believe this conclusion is a useful guideline to understand and tailor the lattice oxygen activity and may be generalized to other layered oxide cathodes involving anionic redox.","Photoinitiated Cascade for Rapid Access to Pyrroloquinazolinone Core of Vasicinone, Luotonins, and Related Alkaloids.",https://www.ncbi.nlm.nih.gov/pubmed/30933523,Organic letters,2019 06 10,Furylimines of aromatic o-nitro aldehydes undergo a photoinduced cascade transformation offering rapid atom- and step-economical access to complex polyheterocyclic scaffolds possessing a privileged pyrroloquinazolinone core.,Effects of a Lead Chloride Shell on Lead Sulfide Quantum Dots.,https://www.ncbi.nlm.nih.gov/pubmed/30933522,The journal of physical chemistry letters,2019 04 26,"The size of a quantum-confined nanocrystal determines the energies of its excitonic transitions. Previous work has correlated the diameters of PbS nanocrystals to their excitonic absorption; however, we observe that PbS quantum dots synthesized in saturated dispersions of PbCl2 can deviate from the previous 1Sh-1Se energy vs diameter curve by 0.8 nm. In addition, their surface differs chemically from that of PbS quantum dots produced via other syntheses. We find that these nanocrystals are coated in a shell that is measurable in transmission electron micrographs and contains lead and chlorine, beyond the monatomic chlorine termination previously proposed. This finding has implications for understanding the growth mechanism of this reaction, the line width of these quantum dots' photoluminescence, and electronic transport within films of these nanocrystals.

Our results show that neutral arginine fragments upon ionization in the gas phase but solvation stabilizes the molecular ion, resulting in different photoionization dynamics.

These monomers and oligomers are largely disordered and can interact with transition metal ions, affecting the mechanism and kinetics of amyloid-β aggregation. Due to the disordered nature of amyloid-β, its rapid aggregation, as well as solvent and paramagnetic effects, experimental studies face challenges in the characterization of transition metal ions bound to amyloid-β monomers and oligomers. The details of the coordination chemistry between transition metals and amyloid-β obtained from experiments remain debated. Furthermore, the impact of transition metal ion binding on the monomeric or oligomeric amyloid-β structures and dynamics are still poorly understood. Computational chemistry studies can serve as an important complement to experimental studies and can provide additional knowledge on the binding between amyloid-β and transition metal ions. Many research groups conducted first-principles calculations, ab initio molecular dynamics simulations, quantum mechanics/classical mechanics simulations, and classical molecular dynamics simulations for studying the interplay between transition metal ions and amyloid-β monomers and oligomers. This review summarizes the current understanding of transition metal interactions with amyloid-β obtained from computational chemistry studies. We also emphasize the current view of the coordination chemistry between transition metal ions and amyloid-β. This information represents an important foundation for future metal ion chelator and drug design studies aiming to combat Alzheimer's disease.",Absolute Quantification of Allergen Glb33 in Rice by Liquid Chromatography-Mass Spectrometry using Two Isotope-Labeled Standard Peptides.,https://www.ncbi.nlm.nih.gov/pubmed/30933518,Journal of agricultural and food chemistry,2019 05 01,"Allergen Glb33 is an important allergen in rice that can cause allergic reactions such as asthma and atopic dermatitis. However, knowledge of the content in rice is sparse. In the present work, an absolute protein quantification method was established for allergen Glb33 in rice samples using liquid chromatography-tandem mass spectrometry. After extraction of allergen Glb33 from rice grains using salt solution, the isotope-labeled peptide internal standard was added to the extract, followed by enzymatic digestion with trypsin. The signature peptide and its isotope-labeled analogue from the tryptic hydrolysates of allergen Glb33 and the internal standard were detected by liquid chromatography-tandem mass spectrometry. The quantitative bias caused by tryptic efficiency and matrix effect was corrected by using two isotope-labeled standard peptides. The method exhibited good linearity in the range of 1-200 nM, with coefficients of determination of R2 > 0.998. A high sensitivity was observed, with a limit of quantification of 0.97 nM. Mean recoveries obtained from different rice matrices ranged from 82.7%-98.1% with precision <8.5% in intraday trials ( n = 6), while mean recoveries were from 75.1%-107.4% with precision <14.6% in interday trials ( n = 14).

Most all-atom force fields are designed for folded proteins and give too compact IDP conformations. α-Synuclein is a well-known IDP because of its relation to Parkinson's disease (PD). To understand its role in this disease at the molecular level, an efficient methodology is needed for the generation of conformational ensembles that are consistent with its known properties (in particular, with its dimensions) and that is readily extensible to post-translationally modified forms of the protein, commonly found in PD patients. Herein, we have contributed to this goal by performing explicit-solvent, microsecond-long Replica Exchange with Solute Scaling (REST2) simulations of α-synuclein with the coarse-grained force field SIRAH, finding that a 30% increase in the default strength of protein-water interactions yields a much better reproduction of its radius of gyration. Other known properties of α-synuclein, such as chemical shifts, secondary structure content, and long-range contacts, are also reproduced. Furthermore, we have simulated a glycated form of α-synuclein to suggest the extensibility of the method to its post-translationally modified forms. The computationally efficient REST2 methodology in combination with coarse-grained representations will facilitate the simulations of this relevant IDP and its modified forms, enabling a better understanding of their roles in disease and potentially leading to efficient therapies.",Importance of the Force Field Choice in Capturing Functionally Relevant Dynamics in the von Willebrand Factor.,https://www.ncbi.nlm.nih.gov/pubmed/30933516,The journal of physical chemistry letters,2019 04 26,"Whether recent updates and new releases of atomistic force fields can model the structural and dynamical properties of proteins containing both folded and partially disordered domains is still unclear. To address this fundamental question, we tested eight recently released force fields against our set of nuclear magnetic resonance (NMR) observables for a complex and medically relevant system, the major factor VIII binding region on the von Willebrand factor. This biomedically important region comprises both a folded and a partially structured domain. By using an enhanced sampling technique (temperature replica-exchange molecular dynamics simulations), we find that some force fields indeed rise to the challenge and capture the structural and dynamical features of the NMR ensemble and, therefore, are the appropriate choice for simulations of proteins with partially structured domains. What is more, we show that only such force fields can qualitatively capture the effects of a pathogenic mutation on the structural ensemble."

We used poly(ε-caprolactone) nanoencapsulation of atrazine (NC+ATZ) to develop a highly effective herbicidal formulation. Detailed structural study of interaction between the formulation and Brassica juncea plants was carried out with evaluation of the foliar uptake of nanoatrazine and structural alterations induced in the leaves. Following postemergent treatment, NC+ATZ adhered to the leaf and penetrated mesophyll tissue mainly through the hydathode regions. NC+ATZ was transported directly through the vascular tissue of the leaves and into the cells where it degraded the chloroplasts resulting in herbicidal activity. Nanocarrier systems, such as the one used in this study, have great potential for agricultural applications in terms of maintenance of herbicidal activity at low concentrations and a substantial increase in the herbicidal efficacy.",Relaxation Dynamics of Thin Matrimid 5218 Films in Organic Solvents.,https://www.ncbi.nlm.nih.gov/pubmed/30933502,The journal of physical chemistry. B,2019 05 17,"Polyimides are interesting polymer materials for organic solvent nanofiltration (OSN) applications because of their high excess free volume and high chemical and temperature resistance. However, an open challenge that remains for glassy polymer materials (i.e., polyimides) is their tendency to swell in organic solvents which can lead to a loss of performance. An understanding on how swelling influences the polymer properties and performance is then of crucial importance for assessing polyimide suitability in OSN applications. Here, the combination of in situ spectroscopic ellipsometry (iSE), broadband dielectric spectroscopy (BDS), and diffuse reflectance Fourier transform infrared spectroscopy (DRIFT-FTIR) is applied to study the molecular interaction of two organic penetrants, toluene and n-hexane, with Matrimid 5218 in detail. iSE shows that slightly cross-linked Matrimid 5218 swells approximately seven times more in toluene (swelling degree ≈ 28%) compared to in n-hexane (swelling degree ≈ 4%). Combined BDS and DRIFT-FTIR results indicate that toluene interacts with the benzene ring present in the diamine via π-π interactions, while n-hexane likely fills up the excess free volume and interacts via local van der Waals interactions. This work highlights the insights into the exact nature of the molecular interactions between the penetrant and polymer that can be gained from a combination of BDS and other techniques and how these insights can be used to estimate or understand solvent-induced swelling of polymers used in OSN applications.",Diverted Natural Lossen-type Rearrangement for Bioconjugation through in Situ Myrosinase-Triggered Isothiocyanate Synthesis.,https://www.ncbi.nlm.nih.gov/pubmed/30933500,Bioconjugate chemistry,2019 05 15,"Fluorescein isothiocyanate (FITC) is one of the most extensively used fluorescent probes for the labeling of biomolecules. The isothiocyanate function reacts with lysine residues of proteins to provide a chemically stable thiourea linkage without releasing any byproduct. However, diversification of isothiocyanate-based reagents is still hampered by the lack of mild conditions to generate isothiocyanate chemical functions, as well as by their poor stability and limited solutions available to increase water solubility, restricting the use of isothiocyanate labeling to highly water-soluble fluorophores. Inspired by plant biological processes, we report a safe and biocompatible myrosinase-assisted in situ formation of isothiocyanate conjugates from a highly water-soluble and stable glucosinolate precursor. This method was applied for the fluorescence labeling of a plasmatic protein and fluorescence imaging of living cells.",Fragment-Based Discovery of an Apolipoprotein E4 (apoE4) Stabilizer.,https://www.ncbi.nlm.nih.gov/pubmed/30933499,Journal of medicinal chemistry,2019 04 25,"Apolipoprotein E is a 299-residue lipid carrier protein produced in both the liver and the brain. The protein has three major isoforms denoted apoE2, apoE3, and apoE4 which differ at positions 112 and 158 and which occur at different frequencies in the human population. Genome-wide association studies indicate that the possession of two apoE4 alleles is a strong genetic risk factor for late-onset Alzheimer's disease (LOAD). In an attempt to identify a small molecule stabilizer of apoE4 function that may have utility as a therapy for Alzheimer's disease, we carried out an NMR-based fragment screen on the N-terminal domain of apoE4 and identified a benzyl amidine based fragment binder. In addition to NMR, binding was characterized using various other biophysical techniques, and a crystal structure of the bound core was obtained. Core elaboration ultimately yielded a compound that showed activity in an IL-6 and IL-8 cytokine release assay.","Unrecognized Intramolecular and Intermolecular Attractive Interactions between Fluorine-Containing Motifs and Ether, Carbonyl, and Amino Moieties.",https://www.ncbi.nlm.nih.gov/pubmed/30933498,The Journal of organic chemistry,2019 05 04,"In order to elucidate to what extent Coulombic and other interactions contribute to the origins of contrasteric phenomena, we have identified a significant, previously unrecognized interaction between fluorine-containing motifs and groups or molecules containing main-group heteroatoms. The axial conformers of both 2-methoxy- and 2-trifluoromethoxytetrahydropyrans preferentially adopt a rotameric arrangement in which the OCH3 and the OCF3 groups are gauche to the ring oxygen. Given that one would expect a repulsive Columbic interaction to exist between the electronegative fluorines of the CF3 group and the ring oxygen in this rotomeric orientation, this surprising result suggests that an attractive interaction exists between the CF3 group and the oxygen of the ring. The generality and origin of this interaction was examined using nonpolar CF4 to probe intermolecular interactions with systems such as dimethyl ether, trimethylamine, trimethylphosphine, and acetone. In each case there was an attractive interaction leading to formation of a complex. The attraction is not due to van der Waals forces. Rather, the fluorine lone pairs of the CF4 often act as an electron donor in these complexes leading to a transfer of charge between the reactants and formation of the complex. These previously unrecognized fluorine-heteroatom interactions likely play a significant role in the context of understanding the binding interactions of medicinally relevant molecules or pharmaceuticals possessing fluorine-containing pharmacophores with their targets.",Programming a Target-Initiated Bifunctional DNAzyme Nanodevice for Sensitive Ratiometric Electrochemical Biosensing.,https://www.ncbi.nlm.nih.gov/pubmed/30933497,Analytical chemistry,2019 05 08,"Here, a bifunctional DNAzyme nanodevice (BFDN) with two detection paths toward the same target was intelligently designed and applied to construct a ratiometric electrochemical biosensor for highly reliable and sensitive mercury ion (Hg2+) detection. In the presence of the target Hg2+, the T-Hg2+-T pair could actuate the preassembled DNA four-branched nanostructure (DNA-4B) without cleavage capability transform to the BFDN with strong cleavage capability for triggering two synchronous Hg2+ detection paths, including a ""signal-off"" path (1) that consisted of a cascade DNAzyme cleavage reaction to dramatically decrease the ferrocene (Fc) response and a ""signal-on"" path (2) that accomplished the capture of significant amounts of methylene blue (MB) on the electrode surface under the assistant of DNAzyme2 (D2) in BFDN. This strategy not only effectively avoided the false positive signal compared with traditional single paths, but also proposed a new ratiometric method to successfully circumvent the deficiency that existed in previous ratiometric electrochemical biosensors. As a result, the reliable and sensitive Hg2+ detection was achieved in the range from 0.1 pM to 200 nM with a detection limit of 23 fM. Above all, here, the assembly of the BFDN is ingeniously coupled with amplification strategy, paving a promising avenue to promote the performances of simple multifunctional DNA nanomachines and facilitate the corresponding development of DNA nanomachines in biosensor platform.",Improving Atom-Type Diversity and Sampling in Cosolvent Simulations Using λ-Dynamics.,https://www.ncbi.nlm.nih.gov/pubmed/30933496,Journal of chemical theory and computation,2019 05 15,Cosolvent molecular dynamics (MD) simulations perform MD simulations of the protein in explicit water mixed with cosolvent molecules that represent functional groups of ligands potentially binding to the protein. The competition between different probes and water molecules allows the identification of the energetic preference of functional groups in different binding site moieties including enthalpic and entropic contributions. Cosolvent MD simulations have recently been applied to a variety of different questions in structure-based drug design but still have significant shortcomings. Among those issues is the limited chemical diversity of probe molecules ignoring the chemical context of the pharmacophoric feature represented by a probe. Here we present a novel cosolvent MD simulation method based on the λ-dynamics simulation concept that significantly increases the chemical diversity of functional groups investigated during cosolvent simulations. Application to four different test cases highlights the utility of the new approach to identify binding preferences of different functional groups and to correctly rank ligand series that differ by their substitution patterns.,DNA Thermal Stability Depends on Solvent Viscosity.,https://www.ncbi.nlm.nih.gov/pubmed/30933495,The journal of physical chemistry. B,2019 05 02,"Capillary electrophoresis has been used to measure the thermal stability of small DNA hairpins in solutions containing 0.3 M cation, comparing the results observed in Na+ and NH4+ with those observed in solutions containing various tetraalkylammonium ions. The midpoint melting temperatures of the hairpins decreased nonlinearly with cation radius but linearly with solvent viscosity, suggesting that the reversible melting transition involves DNA migration through the solvent to find stable base-pairing partners. The normalized melting temperatures increased linearly with the inverse viscosity of the solvent and agreed with values calculated from literature data for another small DNA hairpin, a small RNA duplex, and sonicated calf thymus DNA in tetraalkylammonium ion solutions. The normalized melting temperatures calculated from literature data for poly(A)·poly(U) and two proteins, ribonuclease and lysozyme, in tetraalkylammonium ion solutions also increased linearly with inverse solvent viscosity. By contrast, the normalized melting temperatures calculated from literature data for DNA in solutions containing ethylene glycol or glycerol to modify the viscosity increased linearly with the logarithm of inverse solvent viscosity, not the first power of inverse solvent viscosity.",Improvement of Antifouling and Antimicrobial Abilities on Silver-Carbon Nanotube Based Membranes under Electrochemical Assistance.,https://www.ncbi.nlm.nih.gov/pubmed/30933494,Environmental science & technology,2019 05 07,"Excellent fouling resistance to various foulants is crucial to maintain the separation performance of membranes in providing potable water. Antimicrobial modification is effective for antibiofouling but fails to mitigate organic fouling. Improving surface charges can improve the resistance to charged foulants, but the lack of antimicrobial ability results in bacterial aggregation. Herein, a silver nanoparticle modified carbon nanotube (Ag-CNT)/ceramic membrane was prepared with enhanced antifouling and antimicrobial properties under electrochemical assistance. The presence of silver nanoparticles endows the composite membrane with antimicrobial ability by which biofilm formation is inhibited. Its steady-state flux is 1.9 times higher than that for an unmodified membrane in filtering bacterial suspension. Although the formation of organic fouling did weaken the biofouling resistance, the negatively charged bacteria and organic matter can be sufficiently repelled away from the cathodic membrane under electrochemical assistance. The flux loss under a low-voltage of 2.0 V decreased to <10% from >35% for the membrane alone when bacteria and organic matter coexisted in the feedwater. More importantly, silver dissolution was significantly inhibited via an in situ electroreduction process by which the Ag+ concentration in the effluent (<1.0 μg/L) was about 2 orders of magnitude lower than that without voltage. The integration of antimicrobial modification and electrochemistry offers a new prospect in the development of membranes with high fouling resistance in water treatment.",Photophysical Properties of Ir(III) Complexes Immobilized in MCM-41 via Templated Synthesis.,https://www.ncbi.nlm.nih.gov/pubmed/30933493,Inorganic chemistry,2019 04 24,"In the search for understanding and improving the luminescence of optical materials based on Ir(III) complexes, three [Ir(C∧N)2(dnbp)]+ (dnbp = 4,4'-dinonyl-2,2'-bipyridine) emitters were immobilized in MCM-41 mesoporous nanoparticles. By taking advantage of the amphiphilic nature of [Ir(C∧N)2(dnbp)]+, the complexes were mixed with an appropriate surfactant and the resulting micelles served as templates for the synthesis of mesoporous silica host materials in a one-step sol-gel route. The MCM-encapsulated [Ir(C∧N)2(dnbp)]+ complexes present intense emissions with prominent rigidochromic spectral changes that are substantially less affected by O2 as compared to methanolic solutions, with a thousand-fold decrease in quenching rate constants. These photophysical results points to a possible suitability of Ir(III)-complex-MCM-41 host-guest systems for possible future optoelectronic devices, rigidity optical sensors, or biological markers in different colors."

In this work, the rebound fraction and chemical composition of submicron particles were simultaneously measured to investigate the particle phase state and its link to chemical composition in a subtropical coastal urban city (Shenzhen, China). Submicron particles were found to be in the liquid state for most of the measurement period in spring. During the sampling time, both high relative humidity (RH, ranged from 40% to 93%) and inorganic mass fraction in particles (62.6 ± 12.4% of dry particles, on average) resulted in abundant aerosol liquid water (43 ± 6% in the wet PM1, on average), which may liquefy the particles. Considering the high frequency of ambient RH > 60% and large inorganic mass fraction in aerosol particles, we deduced that particles were in the liquid state throughout the year in coastal urban areas, where this study was performed. The liquid phase particles may accelerate the mass transfer of reactive trace gases and multiphase reactions, thereby enhanced secondary aerosol formation, further resulting in a rapid growth in aerosol mass. Our work suggested that in regions heavily impacted by SO2 and NO x emissions, especially in developing countries, the presence of inorganics could significantly impact the phase state of ambient aerosol particles, and thus the mixing state of inorganic and organic matter should be taken into account for the investigation of the aerosol phase state in urban environments.",Effect of Polymer Chain Density on Protein-Polymer Conjugate Conformation.,https://www.ncbi.nlm.nih.gov/pubmed/30933481,Biomacromolecules,2019 05 13,"Many biomedical applications employ covalent attachment to synthetic polymers to enhance the efficiency of proteins or other therapeutically active molecules.

We observed that BSA's secondary structure measured by circular dichroism is independent of the conjugation. Small-angle neutron scattering, however, reveals a change from ellipsoid to globular shape of the whole complex arising from a slight compaction of the protein core and an increase of the polymer's radius of gyration as a function of the grafting polymer density. In particular, we highlight a gradual change of the polymer conformation around the protein and elongation of the semimajor dimension of the ellipsoidal protein.

Theoretical analysis and systematic experiments prove that Se-doping enables FeOOH as an efficient and low-cost OER electrocatalyst. By optimizing the electrode structure, an industrial-level OER current output of 500 mA cm-2 is secured at a low overpotential of 348 mV. The application of such an Fe-rich OER electrode in a practical solar-driven water splitting system demonstrates a high and stable solar-to-hydrogen efficiency of 18.55%, making the strategy promising for exploring new cost-effective and highly active electrocatalysts for clean hydrogen production.",Noncoded Amino Acids in de Novo Metalloprotein Design: Controlling Coordination Number and Catalysis.,https://www.ncbi.nlm.nih.gov/pubmed/30933479,Accounts of chemical research,2019 06 10,"The relationship between structure and function has long been one of the major points of investigation in Biophysics. Understanding how much, or how little, of a protein's often complicated structure is necessary for its function can lead to directed therapeutic strategies and would allow one to design proteins for specific desired functions. Studying protein function by de novo design builds the functionality from the ground up in a completely unrelated and noncoded protein scaffold. Our lab has used this strategy to study heavy and transition metal binding within the TRI family of three stranded coiled coil (3SCC) constructs to understand coordination geometry and metalloenzyme catalytic control within a protein environment. These peptides contain hydrophobic layers within the interior of the 3SCC, which one can mutate to metal binding residues to create a minimal metal binding site, while solid phase synthesis allows our lab to easily incorporate a number of noncoded amino acids including d enantiomers of binding or secondary coordination sphere amino acids, penicillamine, or methylated versions of histidine. Our studies of Cd(II) binding to Cys3 environments have determined, largely through the use of 113Cd NMR and 111mCd PAC, that the coordination environment around a heavy metal can be controlled by incorporating noncoded amino acids in either the primary or secondary coordination spheres. We found mutating the metal binding amino acids to l-Pen can enforce trigonal Cd(II)S3 geometry exclusively compared to the mixed coordination determined for l-Cys coordination. The same result can be achieved with secondary sphere mutations as well by incorporating d-Leu above a Cys3. We hypothesize this latter effect is due to the increased steric packing above the metal binding site that occurs when the l-Leu oriented toward the N-terminus of the scaffold is mutated to d-Leu and oriented toward the C-terminus. Mutating the layer below Cys3 to d-Leu instead formed a mixed 4- and 5-coordinate Cd(II)S3(H2O) and Cd(II)S3(H2O)2 construct as steric bulk was decreased below the metal binding site. We have also applied noncoded amino acids to metalloenzyme systems by incorporating His residues that are methylated at the δ- or ε-nitrogen to enforce Cu(I) ligation to the opposite open nitrogen of His and found a 2 orders of magnitude increased catalytic efficiency for nitrite reductase activity with ε-nitrogen coordination compared to δ-nitrogen. These results exemplify the ability to tune coordination environment and catalytic efficiency within a de novo scaffold as well as the utility of noncoded amino acids to increase the chemist's toolbox. By furthering our understanding of metalloprotein design one could envision, through our use of amino acids not normally available to nature, that protein design laboratories will soon be capable of outperforming the native systems previously used as their benchmark of successful design. The ability to design proteins at this level would have far reaching and exciting benefits within various fields including medical and industrial applications.",ROS-Responsive Polymeric Micelles for Triggered Simultaneous Delivery of PLK1 Inhibitor/miR-34a and Effective Synergistic Therapy in Pancreatic Cancer.,https://www.ncbi.nlm.nih.gov/pubmed/30933478,ACS applied materials & interfaces,2019 04 24,"Ineffective drug delivery and poor prognosis are two major challenges in the treatment of pancreatic ductal adenocarcinoma (PDAC). While there is significant downregulation of tumor suppressor microRNA-34a (miR-34a), which targets many oncogenes related to proliferation, apoptosis, and invasion, high expression level of Polo-like kinase 1 (PLK1) is closely associated with short survival rates of pancreatic cancer patients. Therefore, the objective is to codeliver miR-34a mimic and small molecule PLK1 inhibitor volasertib (BI6727) using poly(ethylene glycol)-poly[aspartamidoethyl( p-boronobenzyl)diethylammonium bromide] (PEG-B-PAEBEA). This polymer could self-assemble into micelles of ∼100 nm with 10% drug loading of volasertib and form a complex with miR-34a at the N/P ratio of 18 and higher. Combination treatment of volasertib and miR-34a displayed the synergistic effect and superior antiproliferative activity along with an enhanced G2/M phase arrest and suppression of colony formation, leading to cell death due to potential c-myc targeting therapeutics. Orthotopic pancreatic tumor bearing NSG mice were scanned for fluorescence by IVIS after systemic administration of micelles encapsulating volasertib and miR-34a at doses of 5 and 1 mg/kg, respectively. Cy5.5 concentration in plasma and major organs was determined by measuring fluorescence intensity. There was significant reduction in tumor volume, and histological examination of major organs suggested negligible systemic toxicity. In conclusion, PEG-B-PAEBEA micelles carrying volasertib and miR-34a mimic have the potential to treat pancreatic cancer.",Hemoproteins Reconstituted with Artificial Metal Complexes as Biohybrid Catalysts.,https://www.ncbi.nlm.nih.gov/pubmed/30933477,Accounts of chemical research,2019 04 16,"In nature, heme cofactor-containing proteins participate not only in electron transfer and O2 storage and transport but also in biosynthesis and degradation. The simplest and representative cofactor, heme b, is bound within the heme pocket via noncovalent interaction in many hemoproteins, suggesting that the cofactor is removable from the protein, leaving a unique cavity. Since the cavity functions as a coordination sphere for heme, it is of particular interest to investigate replacement of native heme with an artificial metal complex, because the substituted metal complex will be stabilized in the heme pocket while providing alternative chemical properties. Thus, cofactor substitution has great potential for engineering of hemoproteins with alternative functions. For these studies, myoglobin has been a focus of our investigations, because it is a well-known oxygen storage hemoprotein. However, the heme pocket of myoglobin has been only arranged for stabilizing the heme-bound dioxygen, so the structure is not suitable for activation of small molecules such as H2O2 and O2 as well as for binding an external substrate. Thus, the conversion of myoglobin to an enzyme-like biocatalyst has presented significant challenges. The results of our investigations have provided useful information for chemists and biologists. Our own efforts to develop functionalized myoglobin have focused on the incorporation of a chemically modified cofactor into apomyoglobin in order to (1) construct an artificial substrate-binding site near the heme pocket, (2) increase cofactor reactivity, or (3) promote a new reaction that has never before been catalyzed by a native heme enzyme. In pursuing these objectives, we first found that myoglobin reconstituted with heme having a chemically modified heme-propionate side chain at the exit of the heme pocket has peroxidase activity with respect to oxidation of phenol derivatives. Our recent investigations have succeeded in enhancing oxidation and oxygenation activities of myoglobin as well as promoting new reactions by reconstitution of myoglobin with new porphyrinoid metal complexes. Incorporation of suitable metal porphyrinoids into the heme pocket has produced artificial enzymes capable of efficiently generating reactive high valent metal-oxo and metallocarbene intermediates to achieve the catalytic hydroxylation of C(sp3)-H bonds and cyclopropanation of olefin molecules, respectively. In other efforts, we have focused on nitrobindin, an NO-binding hemoprotein, because aponitrobindin includes a β-barrel cavity, which provides a robust structure highly similar to that of the native holoprotein. It was expected that the aponitrobindin would be suitable for development as a protein scaffold for a metal complex. Recently, it was confirmed that several organometallic complexes can bind to this scaffold and function as catalysts promoting hydrogen evolution or C-C bond formation. The hydrophobic β-barrel structure plays a significant role in substrate binding as well as controlling the stereoselectivity of the reactions. Furthermore, these catalytic activities and stereoselectivities are remarkably improved by mutation-dependent modifications of the cavity structure for the artificial cofactor. This Account demonstrates how apoproteins of hemoproteins can provide useful protein scaffolds for metal complexes. Further development of these concepts will provide a useful strategy for generation of robust and useful artificial metalloenzymes.",Impact of Gold Nanoparticles on Amyloid β-Induced Alzheimer's Disease in a Rat Animal Model: Involvement of STIM Proteins.,https://www.ncbi.nlm.nih.gov/pubmed/30933476,ACS chemical neuroscience,2019 05 15,"Alzheimer's disease (AD) is the most common type of neurodegenerative amyloid disorder causing progressive cognitive decline and memory loss. A considerable number of therapies for AD rely on inhibition/delay/dissociation of amyloid beta (Aβ) oligomers and fibrils. In this case, nanoparticles (NPs) demonstrated substantial effects on the Aβ fibrillation process; however, their effects on progressive cognitive decline and memory have been poorly investigated in vivo. In this study, acquisition and retention of spatial learning and memory are studied in a rat animal model of AD after intrahippocampal (IH) and intraperitoneal (IP) injections of a model NP, i.e., gold NPs (AuNPs). The outcomes revealed that the AuNPs could improve the acquisition and retention of spatial learning and memory in Aβ treated rats as indicated by decreased time (Aβ: 39.60 ± 3.23 s vs Aβ+AuNPs: 25.78 ± 2.80 s) and distance (Aβ: 917.98 ± 50.81 cm vs Aβ+AuNPs: 589.09 ± 65.96 cm) of finding the hidden platform during training days and by increased time spent in the target quadrant (Aβ: 19.40 ± 0.98 s vs Aβ+AuNPs: 29.36 ± 1.14 s) in the probe test in Morris water maze (MWM). Expression of brain-derived neurotrophic factor, BDNF, cAMP response element binding protein, CREB, and stromal interaction molecules, e.g., STIM1 and STIM2 was also increased, supporting improved neural survival. Our outcomes may pave a way for mechanistic insights toward the role of NPs on retrieval of the deteriorated behavioral functions in brain tissue after AD outbreak.",Particle Timing Control and Alignment in Microchannel Flow by Applying Periodic Force Control Using Dielectrophoretic Force.,https://www.ncbi.nlm.nih.gov/pubmed/30933475,Analytical chemistry,2019 05 24,"In this study, a technique for particle streamwise timing, spacing and velocity control (alignment) in microchannel flow by controlling the forces exerted on the particle in space and time, was developed. In the present technique, the timing of particles crossing a certain position in microchannel flow with a specific interval and the particle velocity are controlled by applying acceleration and deceleration forces periodically in the streamwise direction and activating them periodically. The force is produced by a dielectrophoretic force using ladder-type electrodes embedded in the microfluidic device and is turned on and off in a cycle. The timing of particles crossing a certain position can be changed by adjusting the phase of the on-off cycle, i.e., the phase of the voltage signal. In the experiment, timing and velocity were measured at the inlet and outlet of ladder-type regions for Jurkat cells and particles of some variation in size, and probability density functions for the deviation of these values from the equilibrium (aligned) state were evaluated. Further, we will discuss the motion characteristics of the particles numerically and experimentally to understand the mechanism and evaluate the performance of the particle timing control and alignment using the present technique. The results confirm that the particles randomly distributed at the inlet of ladder-type electrode regions are controlled to flow with even spacing at a specific velocity. Moreover, the timing of the particles passing a specific location in the ladder-type electrode region was synchronized with the activated/nonactivated cycle of the applied force and could be specified.",Graphene and Carbon Nanotube Heterojunction Transistors with Individual Gate Control.,https://www.ncbi.nlm.nih.gov/pubmed/30933474,ACS nano,2019 04 24,"Heterogeneously integrated nanomaterial devices show interesting characteristics for transistors and sensors due to their band diagram or steep material junctions. If these junctions and band alignments can be tuned by an electrical input bias, the device platform not only could be expanded but also could be used to explore fundamental characteristics. However, most reports on hetero-nanomaterial junctions use a global back-gate voltage, which makes it difficult to control band alignment at an interface. To explore device junctions, this study reports a laterally integrated heterojunction of graphene and a carbon nanotube (CNT) network film with individual gate electrodes to tune the band alignment corresponding to the Fermi level shift of graphene in contact with the semiconducting CNT network film. By developing the fabrication process, multiple gate structures are designed to apply a gate bias to CNTs and graphene separately. The threshold voltage shift of the CNT transistor depends on the gate voltage of graphene. Based on the thermionic emission theory, the barrier height between graphene and CNTs for both the conduction and valence band sides varies from 70 to 85 meV, with a linear change as a function of the applied gate voltage to graphene. Although the current Fermi level shift is small, this device platform may realize the exploration of fundamental properties and device concepts.",Atmosphere-Mediated Superhydrophobicity of Rationally Designed Micro/Nanostructured Surfaces.,https://www.ncbi.nlm.nih.gov/pubmed/30933473,ACS nano,2019 04 24,"Superhydrophobicity has received significant attention over the past three decades owing to its significant potential in self-cleaning, anti-icing and drag reduction surfaces, energy-harvesting devices, antibacterial coatings, and enhanced heat transfer applications. Superhydrophobicity can be obtained via the roughening of an intrinsically hydrophobic surface, the creation of a re-entrant geometry, or by the roughening of a hydrophilic surface followed by a conformal coating of a hydrophobic material. Intrinsically hydrophobic surfaces have poor thermophysical properties, such as thermal conductivity, and thus are not suitable for heat transfer applications. Re-entrant geometries, although versatile in applications where droplets are deposited, break down during spatially random nucleation and flood the surface. Chemical functionalization of rough metallic substrates, although promising, is not utilized because of the poor durability of conformal hydrophobic coatings. Here we develop a radically different approach to achieve stable superhydrophobicity. By utilizing laser processing and thermal oxidation of copper (Cu) to create a high surface energy hierarchical copper oxide (CuO), followed by repeatable and passive atmospheric adsorption of hydrophobic volatile organic compounds (VOCs), we show that stable superhydrophobicity with apparent advancing contact angles ≈160° and contact angle hysteresis as low as ≈20° can be achieved. We exploit the structure length scale and structure geometry-dependent VOC adsorption dynamics to rationally design CuO nanowires with enhanced superhydrophobicity. To gain an understanding of the VOC adsorption physics, we utilized X-ray photoelectron and ion mass spectroscopy to identify the chemical species deposited on our surfaces in two distinct locations: Urbana, IL, United States and Beijing, China. To test the stability of the atmosphere-mediated superhydrophobic surfaces during heterogeneous nucleation, we used high-speed optical microscopy to demonstrate the occurrence of dropwise condensation and stable coalescence-induced droplet jumping. Our work not only provides rational design guidelines for developing passively durable superhydrophobic surfaces with excellent flooding-resistance and self-healing capability but also sheds light on the key role played by the atmosphere in governing wetting."

Part A, Ecological and integrative physiology",2019 05 21,"Dryophytes chrysoscelis (formerly Hyla chrysoscelis, Cope's gray treefrog) is a freeze-tolerant anuran that accumulates glycerol and urea during cold acclimation and freezing. It is hypothesized that glycerol and urea function as cryoprotectants by minimizing osmotically induced cell damage during freezing and thawing, thereby improving the postfreeze viability of red blood cells (RBCs) when frozen in medium containing those solutes. To test this, erythrocytes were obtained from warm (22°C) and cold-acclimated (4°C) frogs and suspended in 280 mOsM phosphate-buffered saline (PBS). RBCs were frozen in 280 mOsM, isosmotic/isotonic, PBS, or in PBS made hyperosmotic by addition of 150 mM solutes. Postfreeze viability was determined with a hemolysis assay. Postfreeze viability of cells from warm-acclimated frogs improved from 18.9 ± 1.3% in PBS to 47.4 ± 5.2% in PBS with urea ( p < 0.01). The addition of other solutes (glycerol, glucose, NaCl, or sorbitol) had no effect.

Capacity fading resulting from imbalanced vanadium crossover is a key operating cost component. Herein, a new approach is reported to avoid this cost by balancing electrolyte transport with amphoteric bilayer Nafion/meta-polybenzimidazole membranes. Within this system, the anion- and cation-exchange capacity can be tuned in a straightforward manner by changing the thickness of the respective polymer layer to balance electrolyte transport for a given current density. At high current densities, a net migrative flux of vanadium directed towards the positive side is observed owing to the higher average charge of vanadium ions present at the negative side. The coulombic repulsion between the vanadium ions and the positive charges in the membrane counteracts this migrative transport and can reverse the direction of the net vanadium flux. For a technically relevant current density of 120 mA cm-2 , a PBI thickness of 3-4 μm is required to balance the vanadium crossover and to minimize capacity fading.",The impact of orphan drug policies in treating rare diseases.,https://www.ncbi.nlm.nih.gov/pubmed/30933412,Health information and libraries journal,2019 06 05,"This paper is based on Shalini Weerasooriya's Masters dissertation in Public Health at the University of Sheffield.

The review concludes that whilst policies have contributed positively towards improving the research and development of orphan drugs it has not exhausted its uses and must now shift its focus to facilitating greater accessibility and affordability of the treatments and that stakeholders are essential to the success of this process. Implications for practice are identified, for example the need to further update and refine the policy with changing demographics and advancing technologies and, in particular, greater collaboration and involvement through, for example, evidence based training programmes is recommended.

F.J.",Observed and modelled historical trends in the water-use efficiency of plants and ecosystems.,https://www.ncbi.nlm.nih.gov/pubmed/30933410,Global change biology,2019 06 12,"Plant water-use efficiency (WUE, the carbon gained through photosynthesis per unit of water lost through transpiration) is a tracer of the plant physiological controls on the exchange of water and carbon dioxide between terrestrial ecosystems and the atmosphere. At the leaf level, rising CO2 concentrations tend to increase carbon uptake (in the absence of other limitations) and to reduce stomatal conductance, both effects leading to an increase in leaf WUE. At the ecosystem level, indirect effects (e.g. increased leaf area index, soil water savings) may amplify or dampen the direct effect of CO2 . Thus, the extent to which changes in leaf WUE translate to changes at the ecosystem scale remains unclear. The differences in the magnitude of increase in leaf versus ecosystem WUE as reported by several studies are much larger than would be expected with current understanding of tree physiology and scaling, indicating unresolved issues. Moreover, current vegetation models produce inconsistent and often unrealistic magnitudes and patterns of variability in leaf and ecosystem WUE, calling for a better assessment of the underlying approaches. Here, we review the causes of variations in observed and modelled historical trends in WUE over the continuum of scales from leaf to ecosystem, including methodological issues, with the aim of elucidating the reasons for discrepancies observed within and across spatial scales. We emphasize that even though physiological responses to changing environmental drivers should be interpreted differently depending on the observational scale, there are large uncertainties in each data set which are often underestimated. Assumptions made by the vegetation models about the main processes influencing WUE strongly impact the modelled historical trends. We provide recommendations for improving long-term observation-based estimates of WUE that will better inform the representation of WUE in vegetation models.",Across the Board: Michael North on Carbon Dioxide Biorefinery.,https://www.ncbi.nlm.nih.gov/pubmed/30933409,ChemSusChem,2019 05 24,"In this series of articles, the board members of ChemSusChem discuss recent research articles that they consider of exceptional quality and importance for sustainability.

However, in lawns, management decisions influence interactions between planted turfgrass and weed species, leading to some uncertainty about the degree of human vs. climatic controls on lawn species distributions. We measured herbaceous plant carbon isotope ratios (δ13 C, index of C3 /C4 relative abundance) and C4 cover in residential lawns across seven U.S. cities to determine how climate, lawn plant management, or interactions between climate and plant management influenced C4 lawn cover. We also calculated theoretical C4 carbon gain predicted by a plant physiological model as an index of expected C4 cover due to growing season climatic conditions in each city. Contrary to theoretical predictions, plant δ13 C and C4 cover in urban lawns were more strongly related to mean annual temperature than to growing season temperature. Wintertime temperatures influenced the distribution of C4 lawn turf plants, contrary to natural ecosystems where growing season temperatures primarily drive C4 distributions. C4 cover in lawns was greatest in the three warmest cities, due to an interaction between climate and homeowner plant management (e.g., planting C4 turf species) in these cities. The proportion of C4 lawn species was similar to the proportion of C4 species in the regional grass flora. However, the majority of C4 species were nonnative turf grasses, and not of regional origin. While temperature was a strong control on lawn species composition across the United States, cities differed as to whether these patterns were driven by cultivated lawn grasses vs. weedy species. In some cities, biotic interactions with weedy plants appeared to dominate, while in other cities, C4 plants were predominantly imported and cultivated. Elevated CO2 and temperature in cities can influence C3 /C4 competitive outcomes; however, this study provides evidence that climate and plant management dynamics influence biogeography and ecology of C3 /C4 plants in lawns. Their differing water and nutrient use efficiency may have substantial impacts on carbon, water, energy, and nutrient budgets across cities.",Frozen sections and complete resection in oral cancer surgery.,https://www.ncbi.nlm.nih.gov/pubmed/30933401,Oral diseases,2019 04 22,"Although the reliability of frozen sections for the intraoperative assessment of complete tumour excision has been established, the best location for collection and the impact of the type of sampling are still debated.

In this study, commonly used viability assessment methods were evaluated for the detection of V. parahaemolyticus in a VBNC state. Vibrio parahaemolyticus cells exposed to nutrient deficiency at cold temperature were used for epifluorescence microscopy with SYTO9 and propidium iodide (PI) staining and real-time polymerase chain reaction (qPCR) with propidium monoazide (PMA), and its resuscitative ability was determined by a temperature upshift in freshly prepared artificial sea water (ASW; pH 7) fluids. Viable cells with intact membranes always exceeded 5·0 log CFU per ml in ASW microcosms at 4°C. After 80 days, cycle thresholds for V. parahaemolyticus ATCC 27969 were 16·15-16·69. During cold-starvation, PMA qPCR selectively excluded DNAs from heat-killed cells. However, there may be some penetration of PMA into undamaged cells that persisted in ASW for 150 days, as evidenced by their ability to resuscitate from a VBNC state after a temperature upshift (25°C); V. parahaemolyticus ATCC 33844 and V. parahaemolyticus ATCC 27969 were successfully reactivated from a VBNC state in ASW microcosms containing <5% NaCl, following enrichment in ASW medium (pH 7). SIGNIFICANCE AND IMPACT OF THE STUDY: Few studies have evaluated the characteristics of and detection methods for viable but nonculturable (VBNC) Vibrio parahaemolyticus induced by cold-starvation. Currently, VBNC cells are routinely detected by SYTO9 and propidium iodide double staining. However, viable cell counts might be overestimated by this approach, suggesting that the fluorescence dyes may be ineffective for accurately determining the viability of bacterial cells. We demonstrated that quantitative real-time polymerase chain reaction with propidium monoazide, which selectively permeates damaged cell membranes, can be used to obtain viable cell counts of V. parahaemolyticus after its evolution to a VBNC state under cold-starvation conditions.",Quality of life benefits from arrhythmia ablation: A longitudinal study using the C-CAP questionnaire and EQ5D.,https://www.ncbi.nlm.nih.gov/pubmed/30933375,Pacing and clinical electrophysiology : PACE,2019 06 01,To investigate long-term efficacy of cardiac ablation for symptomatic arrhythmia by gathering generic and arrhythmia-related quality of life data using patient-reported outcome measures before and after ablation.,Gallbladder Dyskinesia Is Associated With an Impaired Postprandial Fibroblast Growth Factor 19 Response in Critically Ill Patients.,https://www.ncbi.nlm.nih.gov/pubmed/30933374,"Hepatology (Baltimore, Md.)",2019 06 05,"Critical illness is associated with a disturbed regulation of gastrointestinal hormones resulting in functional and metabolic anomalies. Fibroblast growth factor 19 (FGF19) is an ileum-derived metabolic hormone induced by bile salts upon gallbladder emptying after enteral nutrient stimulation. Our aim was to study the nutrient-stimulated FGF19 response in 24 patients admitted to the intensive care unit (ICU) compared with 12 healthy controls. All subjects received intraduodenal high-lipid nutrient infusion for 120 minutes. Blood was collected every 30 minutes until 1 hour after infusion, and gallbladder emptying was studied by ultrasound. Serum levels of bile salts and FGF19 were assessed. ICU patients had significantly higher fasting bile salt serum levels compared with controls, whereas FGF19 serum levels were similar. In both groups, nutrient infusion elicited substantial bile salt elevations (P < 0.001), peaking at 90 minutes, albeit with a significantly lower peak in the ICU patients (P = 0.029). In controls, FGF19 was significantly elevated relative to baseline from 120 minutes onward (P < 0.001). In ICU patients, the FGF19 response was blunted, as reflected by significantly lower FGF19 elevations at 120, 150, and 180 minutes (P < 0.05) and significantly lower area under the curve (AUC) values compared with controls (P < 0.001). Gallbladder dysmotility was associated with the impaired FGF19 response in critical illness. The gallbladder ejection fraction correlated positively with FGF19 AUC values (ρ = +0.34, P = 0.045). In 10 of 24 ICU patients, gallbladder emptying was disturbed. These patients had significantly lower FGF19 AUC values (P < 0.001). Gallbladder emptying and the FGF19 response were respectively disturbed or absent in patients receiving norepinephrine. Conclusion: The nutrient-stimulated FGF19 response is impaired in ICU patients, which is mechanistically linked to gallbladder dysmotility in critical illness. This may contribute to disturbed liver metabolism in these patients and has potential as a nutritional biomarker.",Warfarin dose requirement in patients having severe thrombosis or thrombophilia.,https://www.ncbi.nlm.nih.gov/pubmed/30933373,British journal of clinical pharmacology,2019 04 01,Warfarin dose requirement varies significantly.

Hepatocyte nuclear factor 4 alpha (HNF4A), a liver-enriched TF, acts as a master controller in specification of hepatic progenitor cells by regulating a network of TFs to control onset of hepatocyte cell fate. Using analysis of genome-wide histone modifications, DNA methylation, and hydroxymethylation in mouse hepatocytes, we show that HNF4A occupies active enhancers in hepatocytes and is essential for active histone and DNA signatures, especially acetylation of lysine 27 of histone 3 (H3K27ac) and 5-hydroxymethylcytosine (5hmC). In mice lacking HNF4A protein in hepatocytes, we observed a decrease in both H3K27ac and hydroxymethylation at regions bound by HNF4A. Mechanistically, HNF4A-associated hydroxymethylation (5hmC) requires its interaction with ten-eleven translocation methylcytosine dioxygenase 3 (TET3), a protein responsible for oxidation from 5mC to 5hmC. Furthermore, HNF4A regulates TET3 expression in liver by directly binding to an enhancer region. Conclusion: In conclusion, we identified that HNF4A is required for the active epigenetic state at enhancers that amplifies transcription of genes in hepatocytes.",Pharmacokinetics of imidocarb dipropionate in white-tailed deer (Odocoileus virginianus) after single intramuscular administration.,https://www.ncbi.nlm.nih.gov/pubmed/30933371,Journal of veterinary pharmacology and therapeutics,2019 04 01,"This study was designed to investigate the pharmacokinetics of imidocarb, a carbanilide derivative, in white-tailed deer (Odocoileus virginianus).

Plasma imidocarb concentrations were determined by high-performance liquid chromatography with ultraviolet detection. The disposition of plasma imidocarb was best characterized by a two-compartment open model. The mean ± SE maximal imidocarb concentration in deer was 880.78 ± 81.12 ng/ml at 38.63 ± 5.30 min postinjection.

There is limited information on how to best monitor patients on cyclosporine therapy. Currently, pharmacokinetic and pharmacodynamic assays are available. Pharmacokinetic assays that measure the concentration of cyclosporine in the blood are used to assess if an appropriate drug concentration has been achieved; however, target blood drug concentrations have not been shown to reliably correlate with suppression of T-cell function in the dog. In human transplant recipients, therapeutic drug monitoring has shifted to include pharmacodynamic-based monitoring. Our laboratory has validated a RT-qPCR assay to measure the pharmacodynamic effects of cyclosporine in the dog. In this study, activated T-cell expression of IL-2 and IFN-γ was measured using RT-qPCR daily for 7 consecutive days in 8 healthy Walker hounds receiving oral cyclosporine at a dosage of 10 mg/kg every 12 hr. Cytokine production was found to be markedly decreased within 24 hr after the initiation of cyclosporine and remained significantly decreased for the duration of the project. Based on these results, cyclosporine causes a rapid drop in T-cell cytokine production that is sustained with continued dosing in healthy dogs. Although performed in healthy dogs, this study demonstrated a marked decrease in cytokine suppression within 24 hr of drug administration, suggesting that pharmacodynamic monitoring of cyclosporine's effects on T cells could be considered within several days of commencing therapy in dogs suffering from life-threatening immune-mediated disorders.",Pharmacokinetics of levamisole in the red-eared slider turtles (Trachemys scripta elegans).,https://www.ncbi.nlm.nih.gov/pubmed/30933367,Journal of veterinary pharmacology and therapeutics,2019 04 01,"The pharmacokinetics and bioavailability of levamisole were determined in red-eared slider turtles after single intravenous (IV), intramuscular (IM), and subcutaneous (SC) administration.

Deguelin appears to impede carcinogenesis by enhancing cell apoptosis and hindering malignant transformation and tumor cell propagation. Crucial oncogenic pathways likely targeted by deguelin include the epithelial-to-mesenchymal transition; angiogenesis-related pathways; and the phosphoinositide 3-kinase/Akt, Wnt, epidermal growth factor receptor, c-Met, and hedgehog signal transduction cascades.

We conducted a systematic review of observational studies investigating the association of rural versus urban residence with cancer survival in high-income countries. We searched the Ovid Medline, EMBASE, and CINAHL (Cumulative Index to Nursing and Allied Health Literature) databases up to May 31, 2016. Forty-five studies published between 1984 and 2016 were included. We extracted unadjusted and adjusted relative risk estimates with the corresponding 95% confidence intervals. Most studies reported worse survival for cancer patients living in rural areas than those in urban regions. The most consistent evidence, observed across several studies, was for colorectal, lung, and prostate cancer. Of the included studies, 18 did not account for socio-economic position. Lower survival for more disadvantaged patients is well documented; therefore, it could be beneficial for future research to take socio-economic factors into consideration when assessing rural/urban differences in cancer survival. Some studies cited differential stage at diagnosis and treatment modalities as major contributing factors to regional inequalities in cancer survival.

Recent work has focused on development of methods that integrate multiple streams of data to model species distributions. Combining sources of information increases spatial coverage and can improve accuracy in estimates of species distributions. However, when fusing multiple streams of data, the temporal and spatial resolutions of data sources may be mismatched. This occurs when data sources have fluctuating geographic coverage, varying spatial scales and resolutions, and differing sources of bias and sparsity. It is well documented in the spatial statistics literature that ignoring the misalignment of different data sources will result in bias in both the point estimates and uncertainty. This will ultimately lead to inaccurate predictions of species distributions. Here, we examine the issue of misaligned data as it relates specifically to integrated species distribution models. We then provide a general solution that builds off work in the statistical literature for the change-of-support problem. Specifically, we leverage spatial correlation and repeat observations at multiple scales to make statistically valid predictions at the ecologically relevant scale of inference. An added feature of the approach is that addressing differences in spatial resolution between data sets can allow for the evaluation and calibration of lesser-quality sources in many instances. Using both simulations and data examples, we highlight the utility of this modeling approach and the consequences of not reconciling misaligned spatial data. We conclude with a brief discussion of the upcoming challenges and obstacles for species distribution modeling via data fusion."

Numerical approximations are obtained by applying finite differences for space discretization and an exponential Runge-Kutta scheme for time integration. We exploit the numerical tool in order to investigate the effects that niches have on cancer development. In this respect, the numerical procedure is applied in the case when the function of cell redistribution is assumed to be spatially explicit. It allows for finding an approximate solution which is spatially inhomogeneous as time progresses. In this framework, numerical investigation may help in understanding the process of niche construction, which plays an important role in cancer population biology.",Gastric emptying in patients with well-controlled type 2 diabetes compared to non-diabetic young and older controls.,https://www.ncbi.nlm.nih.gov/pubmed/30933282,The Journal of clinical endocrinology and metabolism,2019 04 01,"Gastric emptying is a major determinant of postprandial glycaemia, and is often delayed in longstanding, complicated type 2 diabetes (T2DM).

Using a combination of optical trapping and holographic imaging we study the 3D dynamics of wall entrapment of swimming bacteria that are sequentially released towards a surfactant-covered liquid-air interface. We find that an incompressible surfactant model for the interface quantitatively accounts for the observed normal and tangential speed of bacteria as they approach the boundary.

At input powers considerably lower than the critical power, SHG efficiency increases by up to three orders of magnitude higher than the case without reflector. Moreover, SHG efficiency of 100% at critical input power, which is twice that of the previous result, can be achieved over a wide phase range.

The longitudinal coherence (LC) properties of the spatially extended monochromatic light source are systematically studied. The pseudothermal light source is generated from two different monochromatic laser sources: He-Ne (at 632 nm) and DPSS (at 532 nm). It was found that the LC length of such a light source becomes independent of the parent laser's TC length for a large source size. For the chosen lasers, the LC length becomes constant to about 30 μm for a laser source size of ≥3.3  mm. Thus, by appropriately choosing the source size, any monochromatic laser light source depending on the biological window can be utilized to obtain high axial resolution in an optical coherence tomography (OCT) system irrespective of its TC length. The axial resolution of 650 nm was obtained using a 1.2 numerical aperture objective lens at a 632 nm wavelength.

The basis is a spectral analysis of the two interfering DUV pulses, while one of the pulses is phase shifted by an unknown visible-infrared (VIS-IR) pulse via cross-phase modulation. The pulse retrieval is analytic, and the fidelity can be checked by comparing the complex-valued data trace with the retrieved trace."

Here we show that the remarkable angular dependence of these ""optical mirages"" and those of the intensity, degree of circular polarization (DoCP), and spin and orbital angular momentum of scattered photons are all linked, and fully determined, by the dimensionless ""asymmetry parameter"" g, being independent of the specific optical properties of the scatterer. Interestingly, for g≠0, the maxima of the optical mirage and angular momentum exchange take place at different scattering angles. We further show that the g parameter is exactly half of the DoCP at a right-angle scattering, which opens the possibility to infer the whole angular properties of the scattered fields by a single far-field polarization measurement.",Constructing multifunctional wave plates with stereo-metastructure arrays.,https://www.ncbi.nlm.nih.gov/pubmed/30933140,Optics letters,2019 04 09,"Driven by the development of nanophotonics and integrated optics, manipulating polarization of light with metastructures has been extensively studied in recent decades. So far there is still a high demand for more efficient ways to control the polarization state of light with extraordinary performance.

In one frequency range, the SMA can turn the polarization direction of incident linearly polarized (LP) light to its orthogonal direction, acting as a half-wave plate (HWP). In the other frequency range, it converts the LP incident light to circularly polarized (CP) light, acting as a quarter-wave plate (QWP). Such a multifunctional element is expected to possess an energy efficiency as high as 75%.

It is shown analytically that a nonlinear amplifying loop mirror in single pass configuration can transform a low power input pulse into a burst consisting of pulses with individual energy up to tens of nJ. The burst features; number of pulses; and their peak power, energy, and duration can be tuned and controlled. Numerical simulations show robustness of the technique to presence of Raman scattering and that sub-picosecond pulse duration can be achieved.

These effects and applications are closely related to nonlocal correlations inherent in these states, manifested by the violation of Bell inequalities. With previous frameworks, this violation is limited by the size of the system, which does not approach the maximum, even when the amount of entanglement approaches its maximum. Here, we propose a new version of Bell correlation operators, with which a nearly maximal violation can be obtained, as long as the associated entanglement approximates to the maximum. Consequently, the revealed nonlocality is significantly stronger than those with previous frameworks for a wide range of the system size. We present a new scheme for realizing the gate necessary for measurement of the nonlocal correlations. In addition to the use in test of quantum nonlocality, this gate is useful for quantum information processing with coherent states."

A necessary step to extending this technique to depolarized channels, such as those in a quantum networking environment, is the ability to perform phase modulation independent of photon polarization. This is also necessary to harness hyperentanglement in the polarization and frequency degrees of freedom for operations such as Bell state discrimination. However, practical phase modulators are generally sensitive to the polarization of light, and this makes them unsuited to such applications. We overcome this limitation by implementing a polarization diversity scheme to measure frequency-bin entanglement for arbitrary orientations of co- and cross-polarized time-energy entangled photon pairs.",SHG (532  nm)-induced spontaneous parametric downconversion noise in 1064-nm-pumped IR upconversion detectors.,https://www.ncbi.nlm.nih.gov/pubmed/30933118,Optics letters,2019 04 09,"As a novel technique for infrared detection, frequency upconversion has been successfully deployed in many applications.

Our experimental demonstration and theoretical analysis reveal the basic properties of this newly discovered UCD noise source, including its dependence on crystal temperature and pump power. Furthermore, the principle behind the generation of this noise source can also be applied to other UCDs, which utilize nonlinear crystals either in waveguide form or with different bulk materials. This study may also aid in developing methods to suppress the newly identified noise in future UCD designs.",Tuning the magneto-optical Kerr effect by the nanograting cross section.,https://www.ncbi.nlm.nih.gov/pubmed/30933117,Optics letters,2019 04 09,"The magneto-optical Kerr effect, especially the Kerr slope, is of great significance to magneto-optical devices.

In the calibration mode, a point object is mounted in the object plane, and the point spread intensity pattern is recorded. Following the calibration, the system is ready for imaging an arbitrary number of 2D objects.

Impulsivity is a meaningful concept because it is associated with psychiatric conditions in humans and with maladaptive behavior in non-human animals. It is believed that impulsivity is composed of separate factors. There are laboratory protocols devised to assess each of these factors using standardized automated equipment. Delay discounting is associated with the incapacity to be motivated by delayed outcomes. This factor is evaluated through intertemporal choice protocols, which consist of presenting the individual with a choice situation involving an immediate reward and a larger but delayed reward. Response inhibition deficit is associated with the incapacity to withhold prepotent responses. Differential reinforcement of low rates (DLR) and feature-negative discrimination protocols assess the response inhibition deficit factor of impulsivity. The former imposes a condition to a motivated individual in which most wait a minimum period of time for a response to be rewarded. The latter evaluates the capacity of individuals to refrain from food seeking responses when a signal of the absence of food is presented. The purpose of these protocols is to construct an objective quantitative measure of impulsivity, which serves to make cross-species comparisons, allowing the possibility of translational research.

Similar results were determined during laboratory testing of Yellow phase American Eels (113-175 mm). No mortality occurred during a 38-day holding period and there was minimal tag loss (3.8%). The presence of the tag did not have any significant effect on the swimming ability or survival of tagged eels compared to untagged controls and there was minimal tag loss.","Isolation, Propagation, and Prion Protein Expression During Neuronal Differentiation of Human Dental Pulp Stem Cells.",https://www.ncbi.nlm.nih.gov/pubmed/30933068,Journal of visualized experiments : JoVE,2019 04 01,"Bioethical issues related to the manipulation of embryonic stem cells have hindered advances in the field of medical research. For this reason, it is very important to obtain adult stem cells from different tissues such as adipose, umbilical cord, bone marrow and blood. Among the possible sources, dental pulp is particularly interesting because it is easy to obtain in respect of bioethical considerations. Indeed, human Dental Pulp Stem Cells (hDPSCs) are a type of adult stem cells able to differentiate in neuronal-like cells and can be obtained from the third molar of healthy patients (13-19 ages). In particular, the dental pulp was removed with an excavator, cut into small slices, treated with collagenase IV and cultured in a flask. To induce the neuronal differentiation, hDPSCs were stimulated with EGF/bFGF for 2 weeks. Previously, we have demonstrated that during the differentiation process the content of cellular prion Protein (PrPC) in hDPSCs increased. The cytofluorimetric analysis showed an early expression of PrPC that increased after neuronal differentiation process. Ablation of PrPC by siRNA PrP prevented neuronal differentiation induced by EGF/bFGF. In this paper, we illustrate that as we enhanced the isolation, separation and in vitro cultivation methods of hDPSCs with several easy procedures, more efficient cell clones were obtained and large-scale expansion of the mesenchymal stem cells (MSCs) was observed. We also show how the hDPSCs, obtained with methods detailed in the protocol, are an excellent experimental model to study the neuronal differentiation process of MSCs and subsequent cellular and molecular processes.",Intra-Omental Islet Transplantation Using h-Omental Matrix Islet filliNG (hOMING).,https://www.ncbi.nlm.nih.gov/pubmed/30933067,Journal of visualized experiments : JoVE,2019 04 01,"Regenerative medicine based on cell therapy represents a new hope for curing disease. Current obstacles include proper in vivo validation of the efficiency of the therapy. For transfer to the recipient body, cells often need to be combined with biomaterials, especially hydrogels. However, validation of the efficacy of such a graft requires the right environment, the right hydrogel, and the right recipient site. The omentum might be such a site. Based on the example of islet transplantation, we developed the hOMING (h-Omental Matrix Islet filliNG) technique, which consists of the injection of the graft inside the tissue, in between the omental layers, to improve islet implantation and survival. To achieve this, islets have to be embedded in a hydrogel with a viscosity that enables its injection using an atraumatic needle. Syringes are loaded with a combination of hydrogel and islets. Several injections are performed inside the omental tissue at different entry points, and the deposition of the islet/hydrogel mixture is made along a line. We tested the feasibility of this innovative approach using dextran beads. The beads were well spread throughout the omental tissue, in close proximity to blood vessels. To test the efficacy of the graft, we transplanted islets into diabetic rats and perform a metabolic follow-up over two months. The transplanted islets exhibited a high rate of re-vascularization around and inside islets, and reversed diabetes. The hOMING technique could be applicable for other types of hydrogel or cell therapy, for cells with high metabolic activity."
