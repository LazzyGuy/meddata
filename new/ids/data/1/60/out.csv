MiR-449b-5p is the target miRNA of high mobility group box 1 (HMGB1). Its role and molecular mechanism in liver I/R injury remain unidentified. In this study, we found a protective effect of miR-449b-5p against hepatic I/R injury. HMGB1 expression significantly increased, whereas miR-449b-5p dramatically decreased in patients after liver transplant and in L02 cells exposed to hypoxia/reoxygenation (H/R). A dual-luciferase reporter assay confirmed the direct interaction between miR-449b-5p and the 3' untranslated region of HMGB1 messenger RNA. We also found that overexpression of miR-449b-5p significantly promoted cell viability and inhibited cell apoptosis of L02 cells exposed to H/R. Moreover, miR-449b-5p repressed HMGB1 protein expression and nuclear factor-κB (NF-κB) pathway activation in these L02 cells. In an in vivo rat model of hepatic I/R injury, overexpression of miR-449b-5p significantly decreased alanine aminotransferase and aspartate aminotransferase and inhibited the HMGB1/NF-κB pathway. Our study thus suggests that miR-449b-5p alleviated hepatic I/R injury by targeting HMGB1 and deactivating the NF-κB pathway, which may provide a novel and promising therapeutic target for hepatic I/R injury.",Wnt1-inducible signaling protein 1 regulates laryngeal squamous cell carcinoma glycolysis and chemoresistance via the YAP1/TEAD1/GLUT1 pathway.,https://www.ncbi.nlm.nih.gov/pubmed/30805937,Journal of cellular physiology,2019 02 26,"Wnt1-inducible signaling protein 1 (WISP1) is a matricellular protein and downstream target of Wnt/β-catenin signaling. This study sought to determine the role of WISP1 in glucose metabolism and chemoresistance in laryngeal squamous cell carcinoma. WISP1 expression was silenced or upregulated in Hep-2 cells by the transfection of WISP1 siRNA or AdWISP1 vector. Ectopic WISP1 expression regulated glucose uptake and lactate production in Hep-2 cells. Subsequently, the expression of glucose transporter 1 (GLUT1) was significantly modulated by WISP1. Furthermore, WISP1 increased cell survival rates, diminished cell death rates, and suppressed ataxia-telangiectasia-mutated (ATM)-mediated DNA damage response pathway in cancer cells treated with cisplatin through GLUT1. WISP1 also promoted cancer cell tumorigenicity and growth in mice implanted with Hep-2 cells. Additionally, WISP1 activated the YAP1/TEAD1 pathway that consequently contributed to the regulation of GLUT1 expression. In summary, WISP1 regulated glucose metabolism and cisplatin resistance in laryngeal cancer by regulating GLUT1 expression. WISP1 may be used as a potential therapeutic target for laryngeal cancer.",Nickel release from metal tools in the German hairdressing trade-A current analysis.,https://www.ncbi.nlm.nih.gov/pubmed/30805936,Contact dermatitis,2019 05 08,"Nickel is one of the most common contact allergens.

Previous studies have shown that hypoxic conditions were beneficial in maintaining the physiological activities of ASCs. However, the effects of hypoxia on buffalo ASCs (bASCs) remain unclear. In this study, the effects of hypoxia on proliferation, stemness, and reprogramming into induced pluripotent stem cells (iPSCs) of bASCs were examined. The results showed that the hypoxic culture conditions (5% oxygen) enhanced the proliferation and colony formation of bASCs. The expression levels of proliferation-related genes, and secretion of basic fibroblast growth factor (bFGF) and vascular endothelial growth factor (VEGF) were significantly enhanced in hypoxia. Hypoxic culture conditions activated hypoxia-inducible factor-1α (HIF-1α), thereby contributing to the secretion of bFGF and VEGF, which in turn enhanced the expression of HIF-1α and promoted the proliferation of bASCs. Furthermore, in hypoxic culture conditions, bASCs exhibited the main characteristics of mesenchymal stem cells, and the expression levels of the pluripotent markers OCT4, NANOG, C-MYC, and the differentiation capacity of bASCs were significantly enhanced. Finally, bASCs were more efficiently and easily reprogrammed into iPSCs in hypoxic culture conditions and these iPSCs exhibited some characteristics of naïve pluripotent stem cells. These findings provide the theoretical guidance for elucidating the detailed mechanism of hypoxia on physiological activities of bASCs including proliferation, stemness maintenance, and reprogramming.",A20 overexpression exerts protective effects on podocyte injury in lupus nephritis by downregulating UCH-L1.,https://www.ncbi.nlm.nih.gov/pubmed/30805933,Journal of cellular physiology,2019 02 26,"Lupus nephritis (LN), an autoimmune kidney disease caused by systemic lupus erythematosus (SLE), is the inflammation of the kidney. Although the treatment of LN is still a therapeutic challenge for many practitioners, the present study aims to provide a new insight for the treatment and management. The study aims to explore the effect of A20 on LN in relation to the nuclear factor-kappa B (NF-κB) signaling pathway. MRL/lpr mice were used as the LN mouse model. Next, A20, UCH-L1, and NF-κB expression in LN patients and MRL/lpr mice was determined. A20 was upregulated in podocytes to assess biological functions of A20 in LN. Furthermore, to further investigate the pivotal role of the NF-κB pathway in LN, the NF-κB pathway was blocked in podocytes. Next, UCH-L1 was downregulated in MRL/lpr mice to assess biological functions of UCH-L1 in LN. A20 was downregulated, whereas UCH-L1 was upregulated in LN. Overexpressed A20 declined NF-κB, UCH-L1 expression, and the extent of p65 phosphorylation. A20 overexpression or UCH-L1 inhibition increased expression of synaptoporin and nephrin but decreased desmin expression and ubiquitin accumulation level in podocytes. Moreover, A20 overexpression or UCH-L1 inhibition increased the podocyte number but decreased protein level of cleaved caspase-3, podocyte lesion improvement, decreased foot process width, glomerulus basement membrane, and foot process fusion rate. In addition, urine protein, blood urea nitrogen, serum creatinine, and ds-DNA antibody levels decreased with elevated A20 or depleted UCH-L1. Collectively, it could be concluded that A20 protects against podocyte injury in LN via UCH-L1 by inactivating the NF-κB signaling pathway.",Identification of the molecular subgroups in coronary artery disease by gene expression profiles.,https://www.ncbi.nlm.nih.gov/pubmed/30805932,Journal of cellular physiology,2019 02 26,"Coronary artery disease (CAD) is the most common type of cardiovascular disease and becomes a leading cause of death worldwide. Aiming to uncover the underlying molecular features for different types of CAD, we classified 352 CAD cases into three subgroups based on gene expression profiles, which were retrieved from the Gene Expression Omnibus database. Also, these subgroups present different expression patterns and clinical characteristics. To uncover the transcriptomic differences between the subgroups, weighted gene co-expression analysis (WGCNA) was used and identified six subgroup-specific WGCNA modules. Characterization of the WCGNA modules revealed that lipid metabolism pathways, specifically upregulated in subgroup I, might be an indicator of increased severity. Moreover, subgroup II was considered as an early-stage of CAD because of normal-like gene expression patterns. In contrast, the mammalian target of rapamycin signaling pathway was significantly upregulated in subgroup III. Although subgroups II and III did not have a significant prognostic difference, their intrinsic biological characteristics were highly different, suggesting that the transcriptome classification may represent risk factors of both age and the intrinsic biological characteristics. In conclusion, the transcriptome classification of CAD cases revealed that cases from different subgroups may have their unique gene expression patterns, indicating that patients in each subgroup should receive more personalized treatment.",Silencing lncRNA PVT1 inhibits activation of astrocytes and increases BDNF expression in hippocampus tissues of rats with epilepsy by downregulating the Wnt signaling pathway.,https://www.ncbi.nlm.nih.gov/pubmed/30805931,Journal of cellular physiology,2019 02 26,"The aim of this study is to investigate the effects of long-chain noncoding RNA plasmacytoma variant translocation 1 (PVT1) on the activation of astrocytes and the expression of brain-derived neurotrophic factor (BDNF) in hippocampus tissues of epileptic rats. The epilepsy rat model was induced by intraperitoneal injection of lithium chloride-pilocarpine. Successfully modeled rats were grouped, and their spatial learning and memory, neuronal loss, number of TdT-mediated dUTP nick labeling (TUNEL)-positive cells, and the expression of cleaved-caspase-3, pro-caspase-3, Bax, Bcl-2, GFAP, BDNF, tumor necrosis factor-α (TNF-α), interleukin-1β (IL-1β), IL-6, axin, and cyclin D1 in hippocampus tissues were evaluated. Increased expression of PVT1 was found in hippocampus tissues of epileptic rats. Silencing of PVT1 improved spatial learning and memory, decreased neuronal loss, decreased the number of TUNEL-positive cell, decreased the expression of cleaved-caspase-3 and Bax while increased pro-caspase-3 and Bcl-2 expression, decreased the expression of GFAP, increased the expression of BDNF, decreased the expression of TNF-α, IL-1β, and IL-6, and decreased the expression of axin and cyclin D1 in hippocampus tissues in epileptic rats. Our study provides evidence that the inhibition of PVT1 may decrease the loss of neurons, inhibit the activation of astrocytes, and increase the expression of BDNF in hippocampus by downregulating the Wnt signaling pathway.",Vitamin D levels reverberate in monocytes modulation in hemodialysis patients.,https://www.ncbi.nlm.nih.gov/pubmed/30805930,Journal of cellular physiology,2019 02 26,"Patients with chronic kidney disease (CKD) have a severe vitamin D deficiency and increasing epidemiological data suggesting that this deficiency may play a role in overall morbidity and mortality associated with CKD.

Cohorts from 12 sites were followed and sampled every month or every other month from sea transfer to slaughter. PMCV was detected at all sites and in all sampled cages, and fish in six sites developed clinical CMS. The initial infection happened between 1 and 7 months post-sea transfer, and the median time from infection with PMCV until outbreak of CMS was 6.5 months. Generally, fish from sites with CMS had higher viral titre and a higher prevalence of PMCV, compared to sites that did not develop clinical CMS. The virus persisted until the point of slaughter at most (11 out of 12) of the sites. The detection of PMCV in all sites suggests that PMCV is more widespread than previously known. Screening for PMCV as a tool to monitor impending outbreaks of CMS must be supported by observations of the health status of the fish and risk factors for development of disease."

The decline in stem cell function during advanced age is associated with a reduced regenerative potential of tissues that leads to an increased frequency of diseases. Age-related changes also occur in the dental pulp  that represents a reliable model tissue, with high regenerative capability, for studying senescence mechanisms. However, little information is available concerning the effects of ageing on dental stem-cell function. In this mini-review, recent data on how the molecular and functional alterations that accumulate in stem cell populations during ageing result in modifications of dental pulp physiology are discussed. Changes that accumulate during ageing such as how reduction of pulp chamber volume, decreased vascular supply and modifications to the stem cell niches affect stem cell functions and, therefore, dental pulp regenerative potential in response to various stressful agents. Dental pulp cells from aged individuals are still metabolically active and secrete pro-inflammatory and matrix-degrading molecules. Furthermore, miRNAs and exosomes derived from dental pulp stem cells constitute an attractive source of nanovesicles for the treatment of age-related dental pathologies. Further investigation of the epigenetic alterations in dental pulp stem cells, accumulating during ageing, might reveal crucial information for potential stem cell-based therapeutic approaches in the elderly.","When Jump Height is not a Good Indicator of Lower Limb Maximal Power Output: Theoretical Demonstration, Experimental Evidence and Practical Solutions.",https://www.ncbi.nlm.nih.gov/pubmed/30805913,"Sports medicine (Auckland, N.Z.)",2019 06 10,"Lower limb external maximal power output capacity is a key physical component of performance in many sports. During squat jump and countermovement jump tests, athletes produce high amounts of mechanical work over a short duration to displace their body mass (i.e. the dimension of mechanical power). Thus, jump height has been frequently used by the sports science and medicine communities as an indicator of the power output produced during the jump and by extension, of maximal power output capacity. However, in this article, we contend that squat jump and countermovement jump height are not systematically good indicators of power output produced during the jump and maximal power output capacity. To support our opinion, we first detail why, theoretically, jump height and maximal power output capacity are not fully related. Specifically, we demonstrate that individual body mass, push-off distance, optimal loading and the force-velocity profile confound the jump height-power relationship. We also discuss the relationship between squat jump or countermovement jump height and maximal power output capacity measured with a force plate based on data reported in the literature, which added to our own experimental evidence. Finally, we discuss the limitations of existing practical solutions (regression-based estimation equations and allometric scaling), and advocate using a valid, reliable and simple field-based procedure to compute individual power output produced during the jump and maximal power output capacity directly from jump height, body mass and push-off distance. The latter may allow researchers and practitioners to reduce bias in their assessment of lower limb mechanical power output by using jump height as an input with a simple yet accurate computation method, and not as the first/only variable of interest.",Yeast Expression Systems: Overview and Recent Advances.,https://www.ncbi.nlm.nih.gov/pubmed/30805909,Molecular biotechnology,2019 04 06,"Yeasts are outstanding hosts for the production of functional recombinant proteins with industrial or medical applications.

Lipids are known to enhance oral bioavailability of poorly water-soluble drugs in multiple ways like facilitating dissolution as micellar solution, enhancing the lymphatic uptake and acting as inhibitors of efflux transporters. Lipid nanoparticles are matrix type lipid-based carrier systems which can effectively encapsulate both lipophilic and hydrophilic drugs. Lipid nanoparticles namely solid lipid nanoparticles (SLN) and nanostructured lipid carriers (NLC) are versatile drug delivery system and can be used for multiple routes of delivery like parenteral, topical, ocular, transdermal, and oral. Lipid nanoparticles are particularly attractive vehicles for peroral delivery of drugs with oral bioavailability problems as they are composed of lipid excipients which are cheap, easily available, and non-toxic; manufacturing technique is simple and readily scalable for large-scale production; the formulations provide controlled release of active components and have no stability issue. A large number of drugs have been incorporated into lipid nanoparticles with the objective of overcoming their poor oral bioavailability.

However, the exact roles of distinct PPFIA family members and ALG3 in head and neck squamous cell carcinoma (HNSCC) remain unclear. We studied the mRNA expressions of PPFIA family members and ALG3 in a variety of tumor types compared with the normal controls using the Oncomine database along with meta-analyses of their expressions in HNSCC cancer cell line. The mRNA expressions of PPFIA family members and ALG3 in laryngeal squamous cell carcinoma cell line and normal laryngeal cell line were detected by quantitative real-time polymerase chain reaction. Based on the cBioportal database, we further studied mRNA expression alterations and co-occurrence relationships of the PPFIA family members and ALG3 in HNSCC. The relationship between PPFIA1 and ALG3 mRNA expression alterations and prognoses in patients with HNSCC was explored. We found that PPFIA1 and ALG3 were distinctively overexpressed at the mRNA level in HNSCC tissues compared with normal tissues, they had a significant co-occurrence relationship, their mRNA expressions were significantly higher than other PPFIA family members in laryngeal squamous cell carcinoma cell line, and their mRNA expressions were also significantly higher in laryngeal carcinoma cell line than in normal laryngeal cell line. Patients without both PPFIA1 and ALG3 mRNA expression alterations had better overall survival and disease/progression-free survival compared with patients with both PPFIA1 and ALG3 alterations. Based on these findings, PPFIA1 and ALG3 may play roles in oncogene expression in HNSCC. Their combined overexpression is significantly associated with poor survival outcomes. The relationship between them and the mechanism of action in head and neck cancers deserve further investigation.",Whole exome sequencing identified three ABCC6 variants in two Pakistani families with pseudoxanthoma elasticum phenotype.,https://www.ncbi.nlm.nih.gov/pubmed/30805891,Molecular biology reports,2019 03 29,"Pseudoxanthoma elasticum (PXE) is an autosomal recessive disorder of ectopic mineralization and fragmentation of elastic fibers in skin, eyes, cardiovascular and digestive system. PXE is caused by sequence variants in ABCC6, which encodes multidrug resistance-associated protein 6 (MRP6, also known as the ABCC6 protein). MRP6 is an important regulator of inorganic plasma pyrophosphate that acts as an inhibitor of ectopic mineralization observed in PXE patients with low inorganic plasma pyrophosphate levels. The current study was designed to investigate underlying genetic defect in two unrelated Pakistani families affected with PXE. Whole exome sequencing followed by Sanger sequencing was performed to identify causative variants.

The staining of SA-β-galactosidase, an aging marker, was remarkably increased in the cells aged with H2O2 at 62.5 µM or more compared with young cells. The intracellular H2O2 level and melanin synthesis were also reduced in both H2O2-treated cells and senescent cells compared with young cells in DCFH-DA assay. Both the senescent cells and the H2O2-treated cells showed higher expression level of Catalase than young cells in western blot and immunofluorescence staining. Furthermore, the expression levels of TRP-1, TRP-2 and p300 were reduced in both senescent cells and the H2O2-treated cells, but that of SIRT-1 was inverted compared with young cells. In addition, H2O2 reduced the expression level of MITF but increased that of Nrf2 in nucleus.

However, it is still unclear whether the improvement is specific to the trained input modality or whether cognitive control occurs at an amodal processing level enabling transfer of set-shifting abilities to different input modalities. In this study, training and transfer was assessed for an auditory task-switching paradigm in which spoken words from different semantic categories were presented dichotically requiring participants to switch between two auditory categorization tasks. Cross-modal transfer of task-switching training was assessed in terms of the performance costs in a visual task-switching situation using tasks that were structurally similar to the trained tasks. The 4-day training significantly reduced the costs resulting from mixing the two auditory tasks, as compared to both an active (auditory single-task training) and a passive control group (no training). More importantly, the auditory task-switching training was also found to reduce the mixing costs for untrained visual tasks, indicating cross-modal transfer. This finding suggests that the improvement resulting from task-switching training is not specific to the trained stimulus modality, but it seems to be driven by a cognitive control mechanism operating at an amodal processing level. The training did not reveal any far-transfer effects to working memory, inhibition, or fluid intelligence, suggesting that the modality-independent enhancement of set-shifting does not generalize to other cognitive control functions.",β-Secretase 1 and its Naturally Occurring Anti-Sense RNA are Down-Regulated in Gastric Cancer.,https://www.ncbi.nlm.nih.gov/pubmed/30805871,Pathology oncology research : POR,2019 02 26,"β-secretase (BACE1) and its naturally occurring anti-sense RNA (BACE1-AS) have established role in the pathologic process leading to Alzheimer's disease. Their possible implication in the neoangiogenesis suggests that they might be involved in the tumorigenesis events as well. In the present study, we compared transcript levels of these genes in 30 gastric cancer samples and their adjacent non-cancerous tissues (ANCTs) to find whether their altered expression might facilitate discrimination of these two sets of samples. Expressions of both genes were associated with site of primary tumor. Both genes were significantly down-regulated in tumoral tissues compared with ANCTs. Significant correlations were detected between transcript levels of these genes in both sets of samples. Transcript levels of BACE1 and BACE1-AS had the diagnostic power of 75% based on Receiver operating characteristic curve analysis. The current study provides evidences for contribution of BACE1 and BACE1-AS in gastric cancer evolution and suggests their potential as diagnostic markers.",Drainage of Tumor-Derived DNA into Sentinel Lymph Nodes in Breast Cancer Patients.,https://www.ncbi.nlm.nih.gov/pubmed/30805870,Pathology oncology research : POR,2019 02 26,"Circulating tumor DNA (ctDNA) is released from cancer cells by apoptosis or other mechanisms, and as tumor tissue contains both blood and lymphatic vessels, ctDNA can spread to local lymph nodes (LNs). We aimed to detect the tumor-derived free DNA in metastasis-free LNs in patients with breast cancers harboring the PIK3CA-H1047R mutation. One hundred twenty-three patients were evaluated and the PIK3CA-H1047R mutation was assayed in sentinel LNs (SLNs), non-SLNs without metastasis, and serum by digital PCR. The mutant DNA was more frequent in metastasis-free SLNs (21.6%) than in metastasis-free non-SLNs (8.6%; P = 0.038), and patients with mutation-positive SLNs were more likely to be positive for serum mutant DNA. Apoptosis in primary breast tumors was determined by TUNEL assay. The apoptotic index was significantly higher (P = 0.003) in patients with mutation-positive SLNs without metastasis (mean, 1.17%) than those with mutation-negative SLNs without metastasis (mean, 0.79%). It was also significantly higher (P = 0.006) in those with mutation-positive serum (mean, 1.41%) than in those with mutation-negative serum (mean, 0.86%). Furthermore, fragment size of PIK3CA-H1047R mutant DNA in metastatic-free SLN lysate used for the one-step nucleic acid amplification (OSNA) assay was short (<500 bp). These results support the theory that DNA is released from the primary tumor via apoptotic fragmentation. In conclusion, ctDNA is detectable in metastasis-free LNs and significantly more frequent in SLNs from patients with breast tumors harboring a high apoptotic index, consistent with drainage of ctDNA from apoptotic primary tumor cells into SLNs.",Epidemiology and pathophysiology of autonomic seizures: a systematic review.,https://www.ncbi.nlm.nih.gov/pubmed/30805869,Clinical autonomic research : official journal of the Clinical Autonomic Research Society,2019 04 15,To review the epidemiology and pathophysiology of autonomic symptoms and signs during epileptic seizures.,Effects of positive personal and non-personal autobiographical stimuli on emotional regulation in older adults.,https://www.ncbi.nlm.nih.gov/pubmed/30805866,Aging clinical and experimental research,2019 02 26,"People can regulate negative emotional states using personal episodic information stored in memory. However, amongst older adults, assistance in retrieving personal memories might be needed. As such, positive personal images might better facilitate the retrieval of positive personal memories, relative to generic positive images. The present study induced older adults (N = 40; Mage = 76.28) into a negative mood state using a validated film clip (""Dead Man Walking""; Robbins et al. in Dead Man Walking [Cinta Cinematográfica]. PolyGram Filmed Entertainment, Working Title Films, Estados Unidos, 1995). Participants were then shown positive personal images (album photos) or positive non-personal images from the International Affective Picture System (IAPS) and between-group differences in their mood state and their ability to retrieve positive autobiographical memories were measured. Although participants' moods decreased after the negative mood induction, their mood then recovered after picture cuing regardless of whether images were personal or non-personal. Furthermore, the positive mood evoked by non-personal, but not personal, images was significantly positively associated with self-reported feelings of reliving of the memories evoked by those images. These results suggest that, when pictures from personal life are not available, the selection of images able to generate positive autobiographical memories with a sense of reliving, is a feasible tool for older adult's emotional regulation.",Adult vaccination as the cornerstone of successful ageing: the case of herpes zoster vaccination.

We report here the conclusions of an expert focus group convened by the European Interdisciplinary Council on Ageing (EICA). The group discussed how existing recommendations regarding HZ vaccination could be better implemented, and how compliance and coverage with HZ vaccination could be enhanced. This report proposes strategies to increase awareness of HZ and its vaccine, enhance vaccine uptake, and educate regarding the role of prevention, including immunization, as a means to ""age well"". A key strategy that could rapidly and easily be implemented at low cost is co-administration of HZ vaccine with other vaccines scheduled in the target age group. The scientific evidence surrounding the safety and efficacy of co-administration is discussed. Other strategies, such as active calls, publicity campaigns and national vaccine registries are also outlined.

The SNARC effect is one of the most thoroughly investigated phenomena in numerical cognition. However, almost all SNARC and MARC studies to date were conducted with sample sizes smaller than 100. Here we report on a study with 1,156 participants from various linguistic and cultural backgrounds performing a typical parity judgment task. We investigated whether (1) the SNARC and MARC effects can be observed in an online setup, (2) the properties of these effects observed online are similar to those observed in laboratory setups, (3) the effects are reliable, and (4) they are valid. We found robust SNARC and MARC effects. Their magnitude and reliabilities were comparable to values previously reported in in-lab studies. Furthermore, we reproduced commonly observed validity correlations of the SNARC and MARC effects. Namely, SNARC and MARC correlated with mean reaction times and intraindividual variability in reaction times. Additionally, we found interindividual differences in the SNARC and MARC effects (e.g., finger-counting routines for the SNARC and handedness for the MARC). Large-scale testing via web-based data acquisition not only produces SNARC and MARC effects and validity correlations similar to those from small, in-lab studies, but also reveals substantial insights with regard to interindividual differences that usually cannot be revealed in the offline laboratory, due to power considerations.",Dealing with missing data by EM in single-case studies.,https://www.ncbi.nlm.nih.gov/pubmed/30805863,Behavior research methods,2019 02 26,"Single-case experimental design (SCED) research plays an important role in establishing and confirming evidence-based practices. Due to multiple measures of a target behavior in such studies, missing information is common in their data. The expectation-maximization (EM) algorithm has been successfully applied to deal with missing data in between-subjects designs, but only in a handful of SCED studies. The present study extends the findings from Smith, Borckardt, and Nash (2012) and Velicer and Colby (2005b, Study 2) by systematically examining the performance of EM in a baseline-intervention (or AB) design under various missing rates, autocorrelations, intervention phase lengths, and magnitudes of effects, as well as two fitted models. Three indicators of an intervention effect (baseline slope, level shift, and slope change) were estimated. The estimates' relative bias, root-mean squared error, and relative bias of the estimated standard error were used to assess EM's performance. The findings revealed that autocorrelation impacted the estimates' qualities most profoundly. Autocorrelation interacted with missing rate in impacting the relative bias of the estimates, impacted the root-mean squared error nonlinearly, and interacted with the fitted model in impacting the relative bias of the estimated standard errors. A simpler model without autocorrelation can be used to estimate baseline slope and slope change in time-series data. EM is recommended as a principled method to handle missing data in SCED studies. Two decision trees are presented to assist researchers and practitioners in applying EM. Emerging research directions are identified for treating missing data in SCED studies.",Chinese character handwriting: A large-scale behavioral study and a database.,https://www.ncbi.nlm.nih.gov/pubmed/30805862,Behavior research methods,2019 02 26,"We report on a psycholinguistic database of Chinese character handwriting based on a large-scale study that involved 203 participants, each handwriting 200 characters randomly sampled from a cohort of 1,600 characters. Apart from collecting writing latencies, durations, and accuracy, we also compiled 14 lexical variables for each character. Regressions showed that frequency, age of acquisition, and the word context (in which a character appears) are all-around and influential predictors of orthographic access (as reflected in writing latency), motor execution of handwriting (as reflected in writing duration), and accuracy. In addition, phonological factors (phonogram status, spelling regularity, and homophone density) impacted orthographic access but not handwriting execution. Semantic factors (imageability and concreteness) only affected accuracy. These results suggest, among other things, that phonology is consulted in orthographic access while handwriting. As the first of its kind, this database can be used as a source of secondary data analyses and a tool for stimulus construction in handwriting research.",SOLID-Similar object and lure image database.,https://www.ncbi.nlm.nih.gov/pubmed/30805861,Behavior research methods,2019 02 26,"Stimulus selection is a critical part of experimental designs in the cognitive sciences. Quantifying and controlling item similarity using a unified scale provides researchers with the tools to eliminate item-dependent effects and improve reproducibility. Here we present a novel Similar Object and Lure Image Database (SOLID) that includes 201 categories of grayscale objects, with approximately 17 exemplars per set. Unlike existing databases, SOLID offers both a large number of stimuli and a considerable range of similarity levels. A common scale of dissimilarity was obtained by using the spatial-arrangement method (Exps. 1a and 1b) as well as a pairwise rating procedure to standardize the distances (Exp. 2). These dissimilarity distances were then validated in a recognition memory task, showing better performance and decreased response times as dissimilarity increased. These methods were used to produce a large stimulus database (3,498 images) with a wide range of comparable similarities, which will be useful for improving experimental control in fields such as memory, perception, and attention. Enabling this degree of control over similarity is critical for high-level studies of memory and cognition, and combining this strength with the option to use it across many trials will allow research questions to be addressed using neuroimaging techniques."

Although we have made great progress, there are still unknown mechanisms of papillary thyroid cancer. We found that UNC5B-AS1 is a potential oncogene in thyroid cancer. Therefore, our study aimed to investigate the biological functions of the lncRNA UNC5B-AS1 in papillary thyroid cancer. As a result, RNA-seq data on primary papillary thyroid cancer (PTC) in the TCGA database were obtained. RT-qPCR was performed to evaluate the expression levels in thyroid tissue. We then analysed the expression level of UNC5B-AS1 and its association with clinicopathologic characteristics in the TCGA database. We downregulated UNC5B-AS1 using small interfering RNA and carried out assays of cell proliferation, colony formation, migration and invasion to explore the function of UNC5B-AS1 in PTC cell lines (TPC1 and BCPAP). These results suggested that the lncRNA UNC5B-AS1 was significantly upregulated in both the TCGA cohort and our tissue cohort. Upregulated UNC5B-AS1 correlated with lymph node metastasis (P < 0.001), tumor size (P = 0.002) and histological type (P = 0.013). We also achieved an area under the ROC curve (AUC) of 93.2% for our validated cohort, which was consistent with the AUC of 94.5% for the TCGA cohort, for differentiating between PTC tissues and normal tissues. Downregulating UNC5B-AS1 expression at the RNA level significantly inhibited cell proliferation, colony formation, migration, and invasion in PTC cell lines (TPC1 and BCPAP). This study demonstrated that the lncRNA UNC5B-AS1 plays an important role in tumourigenesis and metastasis of PTC and may be a potential therapeutic target for PTC.","Response of neutrophilic Shewanella violacea to acid stress: growth rate, organic acid production, and gene expression.",https://www.ncbi.nlm.nih.gov/pubmed/30805846,Extremophiles : life under extreme conditions,2019 04 11,"Neutrophilic Shewanella violacea is isolated from deep-sea sediments and its response to high pressure and high salinity has been investigated. Here, the pure effects of acidic pH on S. violacea physiology were examined, aiming at further understanding of its stress response mechanism. S. violacea could grow at initial pH of 5.0-7.0 without pH adjustment during the test at atmospheric pressure, and the lowest growth rate was obtained at pH 5.0. The pH of the same growth culture with an initial pH of 5.0 rose toward a neutral pH of ~ 7.0 at the exponential growth phase, indicating that S. violacea has a mechanism for acid neutralization. When S. violacea cells were grown at the fixed pH of 5.0, about five times higher concentrations of butyric and isovaleric acids were produced than at pH 7.0. The expression level of the genes encoding three enzymes for isovaleric acid synthesis from L-leucine was also found to be upregulated in S. violacea cells grown at the fixed pH of 5.0 compared with at pH 7.0 through RNA-seq analysis. Therefore, S. violacea at least produces isovaleric acid in its response to acid stress, which further deepens our understanding of the stress response mechanism inherent in this bacterium.",Lundberg and his Waves.,https://www.ncbi.nlm.nih.gov/pubmed/30805845,Neurocritical care,2019 02 26,"This historical vignette revisits the main contributions by Nils Lundberg, a neurosurgeon, that were published in the late 1950s and early 1960s.

This research work analyzes the performance and emission characteristics of a thermal barrier coated diesel engine which used palm biodiesel. The piston and cylinder liners were coated with equal percentages of alumina (Al2O3) and yittria-stabilized zirconia (YSZ) powder using plasma spraying coating method. The piston was coated with 100 μm thickness and the two cylinder liners were coated with 150 and 200 μm thicknesses and were used to analyze the performance and emission characteristics. Test results of the thermal barrier coated engine using palm biodiesel were compared with the results derived from the base engine. The tests revealed an increase of 3.8% specific fuel consumption (SFC) as an average when neat palm biodiesel was used in the base engine. Interestingly, the palm biodiesel used in the 150- and 200-μm thick thermal barrier coated engine was responsible for a significant decrease of the SFC by an average of 4.18% and 8.05% respectively. The brake thermal efficiency was found to decrease on an average of 1.02% when tests were run using the neat palm biodiesel in the base engine. But an average proportionate increase of 0.72% and 2.19% was visible when palm biodiesel was used in the tests conducted on the 150- and 200-μm thick thermal barrier coated engine. There was also an understandable brake specific reduction of 0.991 g/kWh carbon monoxide (CO) emission and 0.025 g/kWh unburned hydrocarbon (HC) levels. The nitrogen oxide (NOx) emission was observed as 14.06 g/kWh in the 200-μm thick thermal barrier coated engine which was slightly higher when the results were compared with that of the uncoated engine. The novelty of this research investigation is based on the usage of yttrium-stabilized zirconia and alumina thermal barrier coating on the cylinder liner and piston head of engine. This is justified due to the fact that most of the previous investigations undertaken focused on the thermal barrier coating in the piston, valve, and cylinder head alone. The utility factor of the palm biodiesel (B 100) in the low heat rejection engine has also proved to be another significant and novel factor in the present investigation outlined in this paper. This is mainly due to the fact that the ongoing investigations in this realm concentrated only on blends of 20 to 30% of palm biodiesel with diesel fuel in the low heat rejection diesel engine.",Stability and uptake of methylphenidate and ritalinic acid in nine-spine stickleback (Pungitius pungitius) and water louse (Asellus aquaticus).,https://www.ncbi.nlm.nih.gov/pubmed/30805842,Environmental science and pollution research international,2019 05 10,"The presence of human pharmaceuticals in the environment has garnered significant research attention because these compounds may exert therapeutic effects on exposed wildlife. Yet, for many compounds, there is still little research documenting their stability in the water column and uptake in organism tissues. Here, we measured the uptake and stability of methylphenidate (Ritalin®, a frequently prescribed central nervous system stimulant) and its primary metabolite, ritalinic acid, in (1) water only or (2) with nine-spine stickleback and water louse. Methylphenidate degraded to ritalinic acid in both studies faster at a higher temperature (20 °C versus 10 °C), with concentrations of ritalinic acid surpassing methylphenidate after 48-100 h, depending on temperature. The concentration of methylphenidate in stickleback was highest at the first sampling point (60 min), while the concentration in water louse tissues reached comparatively higher levels and peaked after ~ 6 days. Neither stickleback nor water louse took up ritalinic acid in tissues despite being present in the water column. Our findings provide valuable data for use in future risk assessment of methylphenidate and will aid in the design of studies aimed at measuring any ecotoxicological effects on, for example, the behaviour or physiology of aquatic organisms.",Antioxidant and cytoprotective effects of N-acetylcysteine against subchronic oral glyphosate-based herbicide-induced oxidative stress in rats.,https://www.ncbi.nlm.nih.gov/pubmed/30805841,Environmental science and pollution research international,2019 06 13,"It is claimed that oxidative stress has a prominent role in the mechanism of toxic effects formed by glyphosate-based herbicide (GBH) in living systems. A strong thiol compound, N-acetylcysteine (NAC), has antioxidative and cytoprotective properties. The objective in this subchronic toxicity study was to identify the prophylactic effect of NAC over histopathological changes and oxidative stress induced by GBH in blood, renal, liver, cardiac, and brain tissues. A sum of 28 male Wistar rats were divided into four equal groups, each containing 7 rats. During the study, group I (control group) was supplied with normal rodent bait and tap water ad libitum. The applied agents were 160 mg/kg NAC to group II, 375 mg/kg as equivalent to 1/10 of lethal dose 50% (LD50) of GBH to group III, and 160 mg/kg of NAC and 375 mg/kg of GBH together once per day as oral gavage to group IV for 8 weeks. While GBH decreased the levels of GSH in blood, liver, kidney, and brain tissues, it considerably increased malondialdehyde levels. On the contrary, these parameters happened to improve in the group supplied with NAC. Besides, it was seen that NAC was observed to improve the histopathologic changes in rat tissues induced by GBH. It was concluded that NAC protects oxidative stress and tissue damage induced by GBH in blood and tissue and this prophylactic effect could be attributed to its antioxidant and free radical sweeper character.",Continuous efficient removal and inactivation mechanism of E. coli by bismuth-doped SnO2/C electrocatalytic membrane.,https://www.ncbi.nlm.nih.gov/pubmed/30805840,Environmental science and pollution research international,2019 06 13,"The Bi-SnO2/C electrocatalytic membrane was fabricated via a simple electrochemical reduction and hydrothermal method. Under the action of electric field, the Sn2+ and Bi3+ were firstly adsorbed and reduced to metallic Sn and Bi on the carbon membrane surface by cathodic reduction reaction, and the Bi-SnO2/C membrane was obtained subsequently through hydrothermal oxidation process. Confirmed by SEM, TEM, XRD, and XPS characterizations, the nano-Bi-SnO2 is homogeneously distributed on the membrane surface and is firmly attached to the carbon membrane via C-O-Sn chemical bond. Through CV, LSV, and EIS electrochemical analysis, the Bi-SnO2/C membrane possesses the higher electrocatalytic activity and stability than carbon membrane. Therefore, the Bi-SnO2/C membrane could continuously efficiently remove and inactivate Escherichia coli in water through flow-through mode. As a result, the sterilization efficiency can reach more than 99.99% under the conditions of cell voltage 4 V, flow rate 1.4 mL/min, and E. coli initial concentration 1.0 × 104 CFU/mL, owing to the synergistic effect of the membrane separation and electrocatalytic oxidation. Moreover, it was found that the oxidation groups of ⋅OH radicals generated by Bi-SnO2/C membrane play the crucial role for bactericidal performance. This work presents a low-cost, highly active, and stable electrocatalytic membrane towards continuous bacterial inactivation, which exhibits promising potential in water disinfection and is beneficial for practical large-scale applications.","Characterization and risk assessment of heavy metals in road dust from a developing city with good air quality and from Shanghai, China.",https://www.ncbi.nlm.nih.gov/pubmed/30805839,Environmental science and pollution research international,2019 06 13,"To investigate the differences in characteristics of heavy metals associated with different levels of ambient air quality, we collected road dust samples from Beihai (BH) and Shanghai (SH). The mean concentrations of Ni, Cr, Zn, and Cu in BH samples were one to four times the background concentrations in soil, whereas the concentrations of Cd, Cr, Mn, Zn, Cu, and Pb in SH were one to three times the background concentrations. The geo-accumulation index (Igeo) indicated widespread moderate contamination by Zn and high contamination near industrial areas by Ni and Cr in BH, whereas in SH was partly moderately contaminated by Pb, Cu, and Zn. The potential ecological risk index ([Formula: see text]) indicated the low risk posed by all metals in both BH and SH. However, special attention should be given to the maximal [Formula: see text] values, such as considerable risk for Hg ([Formula: see text] = 148.7) and high risk for Ni (254.1) in BH, respectively. According to the health risk assessment results, there were no non-carcinogenic or carcinogenic risks (CR) posed by heavy metals in road dust collected from BH and SH. Non-carcinogenic risks due to Cr for children in both BH (0.36) and SH (0.24) were relatively high compared to other metals, and a maximal CR value for Cr (2.7 × 10-6) was found to pose a potential carcinogenic risk near the industrial area in BH. Compared with those in developed cities, the health risks in BH related to Cu, Pb, and Zn from motor vehicle emissions were relatively low, but those related to Ni and Cr from local industrial activity in road dust were relatively high.","The effects of particulate matters on allergic rhinitis in Nanjing, China.",https://www.ncbi.nlm.nih.gov/pubmed/30805838,Environmental science and pollution research international,2019 06 13,"Particulate matter pollution is a serious environmental problem. Individuals exposed to particulate matters have an increased prevalence to diseases. In the present study, we performed an epidemiological study to investigate the effects of particulate matter less than 10 μm in aerodynamic diameter (PM10) and particulate matter less than 2.5 μm in aerodynamic diameter (PM2.5) on allergic rhinitis in Nanjing, China. Daily numbers of allergic rhinitis patients (33,063 patients), PM10, PM2.5, and weather data were collected from January 2014 to December 2016 in Nanjing, China. Generalized additive models (GAM) were used to evaluate the effects of PM10 and PM2.5 on allergic rhinitis. We found that the interquartile range (IQR) increases in PM10 (difference of estimates, 5.86%; 95% CI, 3.00-8.81%; P = 4.72 × 10-5) and PM2.5 (difference of estimates, 5.39%; 95% CI, 2.73-8.12%; P = 5.67 × 10-5) concentrations were associated with the higher increased numbers of allergic rhinitis patients with 3-day cumulative effects in single-pollutant model. In addition, we found that the IQR increase in PM10 (age ≥ 18 years: 7.37%, 3.91-10.96%, 2.14 × 10-5; 0-17 years: 0.83%, - 4.00-5.91%, 0.740) and PM2.5 (age ≥ 18 years: 7.00%, 3.78-10.32%, 1.40 × 10-5; 0-17 years: 0.40%, - 4.10-5.10%, 0.866) increased the number of allergic rhinitis patients in adults, but not in children. In summary, our findings suggested that exposure to PM10 and PM2.5 was associated with the risk of allergic rhinitis."

Diagnostic delay is associated with poorer outcomes, while a short delay between symptom onset and diagnosis is linked with preservation of function. Overcoming the barriers to early diagnosis of PsA is often difficult to achieve in the absence of well-characterized disease markers and/or a definitive screening procedure. Once a diagnosis is made, approaches to care may differ between countries, but a treat-to-target approach can be advocated, with constant patient follow-up visits and specialist monitoring and treatment of comorbidities. Adequately addressing all aspects of care can help to drive patient-centered care and encourage better adherence. Given the mounting number of therapeutic options and the complexity of management of PsA, the disease can be optimally treated by a multidisciplinary approach, and a collaborative approach between rheumatologists and dermatologists can be advocated. The need for multidisciplinary management is reinforced by consensus among experts. Patient satisfaction has emerged as a central indicator of quality, and patient-centered care must remain a central goal for the care of patients with PsA. Definition of a minimum set of standards for care will help to achieve the goal of multidisciplinary care for patients with PsA. Optimal care of PsA and greater collaboration among clinicians should always be encouraged so that patients can receive the best possible quality of care.Funding: Pfizer Italy.",Hybridization of TEDOR and NCX MAS solid-state NMR experiments for simultaneous acquisition of heteronuclear correlation spectra and distance measurements.,https://www.ncbi.nlm.nih.gov/pubmed/30805819,Journal of biomolecular NMR,2019 05 21,"Magic angle spinning (MAS) solid-state NMR (ssNMR) spectroscopy is a major technique for the characterization of the structural dynamics of biopolymers at atomic resolution. However, the intrinsic low sensitivity of this technique poses significant limitations to its routine application in structural biology. Here we achieve substantial savings in experimental time using a new subclass of Polarization Optimized Experiments (POEs) that concatenate TEDOR and SPECIFIC-CP transfers into a single pulse sequence. Specifically, we designed new 2D and 3D experiments (2D TEDOR-NCX, 3D TEDOR-NCOCX, and 3D TEDOR-NCACX) to obtain distance measurements and heteronuclear chemical shift correlations for resonance assignments using only one experiment. We successfully tested these experiments on N-Acetyl-Val-Leu dipeptide, microcrystalline U-13C,15N ubiquitin, and single- and multi-span membrane proteins reconstituted in lipid membranes. These pulse sequences can be implemented on any ssNMR spectrometer equipped with standard solid-state hardware using only one receiver. Since these new POEs speed up data acquisition considerably, we anticipate their broad application to fibrillar, microcrystalline, and membrane-bound proteins.",Generalist predator contributions to the control of Tetranychus urticae in strawberry crops documented by PCR-based gut content analysis.,https://www.ncbi.nlm.nih.gov/pubmed/30805818,Experimental & applied acarology,2019 05 16,"The contribution of generalist insect predators to the control of the two-spotted spider mite, Tetranychus urticae Koch (Acari: Tetranychidae), an herbivorous pest of many crops, is poorly understood. One of the common insect predators in strawberries is the generalist predatory bug Anthocoris nemorum L. (Hemiptera: Anthocoridae), which has the potential to contribute to the control of pest populations. The feeding of adult A. nemorum on T. urticae was assessed by sampling individuals from an organic strawberry field in Denmark, and using PCR gut content analysis to detect remains of T. urticae within their gut. In the lab, we assessed that the DNA half-life detectability was 21.5 h. Significant numbers of field-collected A. nemorum tested positive for T. urticae prey DNA, with very high numbers in June (62.8%) and August (38.8%). This study presents conclusive evidence that the generalist predator A. nemorum can contribute to the decrease of T. urticae densities in strawberry fields, although the actual contribution in the present study is probably limited because predator populations were relatively low compared to T. urticae. The abundance of T. urticae did not increase significantly during the period of sampling, suggesting that a complex of natural enemies can achieve biological control of T. urticae in protected strawberries.",A high gene flow in populations of Amblyomma ovale ticks found in distinct fragments of Brazilian Atlantic rainforest.,https://www.ncbi.nlm.nih.gov/pubmed/30805817,Experimental & applied acarology,2019 05 16,"The genetic structure of populations of the tick Amblyomma ovale from five distinct areas of the Brazilian Atlantic rainforest was evaluated via DNA sequencing and associated with the presence of domestic dogs acting as hosts at the edge of forest fragments. Ticks were collected from domestic dogs and from the environment between 2015 and 2017. Four collection areas were located in the surroundings and within the Serra do Mar State Park, São Paulo State (23°37'21""S, 45°24'43""W), where dogs were bimonthly monitored along 2 years using camera traps and GSM trackers. To determine the spatial limits of genetic structure, ticks collected upon dogs living near the Serra do Baturié, Ceará State (4°15'40""S, 38°55'54""W) were included as well. A total of 39 haplotypes of 16S rRNA and Cox 1 mitochondrial genes sequences were observed, with 27 of them coming from areas within the Serra do Mar State Park. No haplotype was shared between the Serra do Mar and the Serra do Baturié indicating isolation of tick populations at the scale of 2000 km. Although three different haplotype lineages of A. ovale occurred within the Serra do Mar State Park, no genetic structure was found across the study sites within this park, suggesting high tick gene flow across a range of 45 km. Monitoring data from domestic dogs and wild carnivores showed that these species share the same habitats at the forest edge, with dogs playing a likely limited role in tick dispersal. Our findings have important implications for understanding the genetic structure of wide spread A. ovale along Brazilian rainforest remnants, which can further be associated to tick-borne infectious agents, such as Rickettsia parkeri, and used for predicting future patterns of tick diversity in the Brazilian Atlantic rainforest.",Rickettsia raoultii and Rickettsia sibirica in ticks from the long-tailed ground squirrel near the China-Kazakhstan border.,https://www.ncbi.nlm.nih.gov/pubmed/30805816,Experimental & applied acarology,2019 04 06,"Spotted fever group (SFG) rickettsiae cause infection in humans, domestic animals and wildlife.

Tick species (identified according to morphological and molecular characteristics) included Dermacentor nuttalli, Dermacentor silvarum and Ixodes kaiseri. Based on the cytochrome c oxidase subunit I (COI) haplotype analysis, I. kaiseri from S. undulatus belongs to an ancestral. In addition, all tick samples were analyzed for the presence of rickettsiae by PCR amplification and sequencing of six genetic markers. Rickettsia raoultii and Rickettsia sibirica subsp. sibirica were shown to occur in adults and nymphs of D. nuttalli and D. silvarum. Rickettsia sibirica subsp. sibirica was also detected in an I. kaiseri adult. Dermacentor silvarum and I. kaiseri were found for the first time on S. undulatus.

The glycolytic inhibitor 2-deoxy-D-glucose (2-DG) has been reported to exert antiepileptic effects by upregulating KATP subunits (kir6.1 and kir6.2). We evaluated whether 2-DG exhibits anti-seizure effect by mediating the netrin-G1-KATP signaling pathway in epilepsy. In a mouse epilepsy model induced by lithium chloride-pilocarpine, 2-DG intervention increased the mRNA and protein expression levels of kir6.1 and kir6.2, and these increases were significantly reversed after knocking down netrin-G1 expression. Similarly, in cultured neurons with a magnesium-free medium, we found that the frequency of spontaneous postsynaptic potentials (SP) was increased, and in the meanwhile, expression levels of kir6.1 and kir6.2 were increased after pretreatment with 2DG. These effects were remarkably reversed after knocking down netrin-G1. Thus, our findings show that 2DG exhibits anti-seizure effects through the netrin-G1-KATP signaling pathway.",Behavioral flexibility of a generalist carnivore.,https://www.ncbi.nlm.nih.gov/pubmed/30805799,Animal cognition,2019 04 12,"Innovative problem solving, repeated innovation, learning, and inhibitory control are cognitive abilities commonly regarded as important components of behaviorally flexible species. Animals exhibiting these cognitive abilities may be more likely to adapt to the unique demands of living in novel and rapidly changing environments, such as urbanized landscapes. Raccoons (Procyon lotor) are an abundant, generalist species frequently found in urban habitats, and are capable of innovative problem solving, which makes them an ideal species to assess their behavioral flexibility. We gave 20 captive raccoons a multi-access puzzle box to investigate which behavioral and cognitive mechanisms enable the generation of innovative and flexible behaviors in this species. Over two-thirds of raccoons tested were not only capable of innovative problem solving, but displayed repeated innovation by solving more than one solution on the multi-access puzzle box and demonstrated that they learned multiple solutions to a novel problem. Although we found no relationship between our measure of inhibitory control and a raccoon's ability to exhibit repeated innovations, we did find a positive relationship between the diversity of behaviors that an individual exhibited when interacting with the problem and the number of solution types that they solved. We identified other predictors of problem-solving performance, including neophobia and persistence. Finally, we examine the implications of our results in the context of the cognitive-buffer hypothesis and consider whether the widespread success of an adaptive generalist carnivore could be due in part to having these cognitive and behavioral traits.",Multiple Rapid Swallows (MRS) Complements Single-Swallow (SS) Analysis for High-Resolution Esophageal Manometry (HREM).,https://www.ncbi.nlm.nih.gov/pubmed/30805798,Digestive diseases and sciences,2019 02 26,"Multiple rapid swallows (MRS) during HREM assess post-deglutitive inhibition, LES relaxation, and subsequent esophageal contraction.",Can ultrasound imaging be used for the diagnosis of carpal tunnel syndrome in diabetic patients?

Paclitaxel-loaded cationic solid lipid nanoparticles (SLNs/PTX) and doxorubicin-loaded PEGylated liposomes (Lipo/Dox) were prepared as model drug delivery particulates. After optimizing TC concentration and centrifugal conditions, DCC showed superior separation efficiency and accuracy over common ultracentrifugation and ultrafiltration methods and displayed comparable or even better separation efficiency compared with size-exclusion chromatography, as demonstrated by the determination of encapsulation efficiency, Tyndall effect, transmittance, and drug recovery. DCC was also proven to minimally impact the size distribution, surface morphology, and thermal properties of the nanoparticles and liposomes, and moreover, it did not affect the determination of drug concentrations. Together, DCC has been demonstrated as a neat and effective method for the separation of free drugs from drug-loaded SLNs and liposomes, which shall be of great benefit for the development of particulate based delivery systems.",Chronological change of renal pathological findings in the proliferative glomerulonephritis with monoclonal IgG deposits considered to have recurred early after kidney transplantation.,https://www.ncbi.nlm.nih.gov/pubmed/30805792,CEN case reports,2019 02 26,"Proliferative glomerulonephritis with monoclonal immunoglobulin G (IgG) deposits (PGNMID) is a rare disease that recently became recognized. Its pathological findings are characterized by the deposition of a single heavy chain subclass and a single light chain isotype. PGNMID has been proven to recur in renal allografts. Herein, the authors describe the case of a 46-year-old man who presented with nephrotic syndrome and progressive kidney injury following kidney transplantation. One month after transplantation, his clinical condition stabilized; however, the protocol biopsy showed depositions of IgG and complement on the glomeruli by immunofluorescence staining. Electron microscopy (EM) revealed granular electron-dense deposits (EDD) in the mesangium. Thereafter, renal biopsy was repeated because his proteinuria level increased. Proliferative glomerulonephritis, mainly in the mesangium, with IgG and complement deposits and mesangial and subendothelial EDD were observed; however, the pathological diagnosis was difficult. Renal dysfunction then became apparent, and renal biopsy was performed again 4 years and 10 months after kidney transplantation. Glomerular deposits on a single IgG subclass and a single light chain isotype (IgG3 kappa) with membranoproliferative features were observed. Abundant subendothelial EDD were detected on EM. Finally, the patient was diagnosed with PGNMID. Since it seemed that PGNMID had already developed at 1 month after transplantation, we considered recurrent PGNMID case in the allograft. The treatment for PGNMID has not been established yet, and even in this case, the graft function was eventually lost. For improving renal prognosis, early diagnosis and further investigation on the treatment are necessary.","The Combination of Lithium and ACE Inhibitors: Hazardous, Critical, Possible?",https://www.ncbi.nlm.nih.gov/pubmed/30805791,Clinical drug investigation,2019 04 26,"Lithium is a well established therapeutic agent in the treatment of uni- and bipolar affective disorders. Angiotensin-converting enzyme (ACE) inhibitors are the most frequently used class of drugs in the treatment of cardiovascular diseases. Combination therapy with both may be considered in clinical practice on occurrence of arterial hypertension after years of successful lithium therapy, yet an increased risk of lithium intoxication in combination with ACE inhibitors has been described and thus the combination has been warned against. We describe three cases in which enalapril, lisinopril or ramipril was combined with lithium. Either additional co-medication with hydrochlorothiazide or dehydration rather than co-medication with ACE inhibitors could be identified as necessary factors for lithium intoxication. These cases suggest that a combination of lithium with ACE inhibitors is possible when sufficient hydration is ensured and a combination with hydrochlorothiazide is avoided.

Our goal was to develop software to automate the conversion of image annotations in a commercial PACS to the Annotation and Image Markup (AIM) standardized format and demonstrate the utility of this conversion for automated matching of lesion measurements across time points for cancer lesion tracking. We created a software module in Java to parse the DICOM presentation state (DICOM-PS) objects (that contain the image annotations) for imaging studies exported from a commercial PACS (GE Centricity v3.x). Our software identifies line annotations encoded within the DICOM-PS objects and exports the annotations in the AIM format. A separate Python script processes the AIM annotation files to match line measurements (on lesions) across time points by tracking the 3D coordinates of annotated lesions. To validate the interoperability of our approach, we exported annotations from Centricity PACS into ePAD ( http://epad.stanford.edu ) (Rubin et al., Transl Oncol 7(1):23-35, 2014), a freely available AIM-compliant workstation, and the lesion measurement annotations were correctly linked by ePAD across sequential imaging studies. As quantitative imaging becomes more prevalent in radiology, interoperability of image annotations gains increasing importance. Our work demonstrates that image annotations in a vendor system lacking standard semantics can be automatically converted to a standardized metadata format such as AIM, enabling interoperability and potentially facilitating large-scale analysis of image annotations and the generation of high-quality labels for deep learning initiatives. This effort could be extended for use with other vendors' PACS.","Oxymatrine Inhibits Bocavirus MVC Replication, Reduces Viral Gene Expression and Decreases Apoptosis Induced by Viral Infection.",https://www.ncbi.nlm.nih.gov/pubmed/30805776,Virologica Sinica,2019 04 29,"Oxymatrine (OMT), as the main active component of Sophoraflavescens, exhibits a variety of pharmacological properties, including anti-oxidative, anti-inflammatory, anti-tumor, and anti-viral activities, and currently is extensively employed to treat viral hepatitis; however, its effects on parvovirus infection have yet to be reported. In the present study, we investigated the effects of OMT on cell viability, virus DNA replication, viral gene expression, cell cycle, and apoptosis in Walter Reed canine cells/3873D infected with minute virus of canines (MVC). OMT, at concentrations below 4 mmol/L(no cellular toxicity), was found to inhibit MVC DNA replication and reduce viral gene expression at both mRNA and protein levels, which was associated with the inhibition of cell cycle S-phase arrest in early-stage of MVC infection. Furthermore, OMT significantly increased cell viability, decreased MVC-infected cell apoptosis, and reduced the expression of activated caspase 3. Our results suggest that OMT has potential application in combating parvovirus infection.",Ultrasound-targeted microbubble destruction improved the antiangiogenic effect of Endostar in triple-negative breast carcinoma xenografts.,https://www.ncbi.nlm.nih.gov/pubmed/30805775,Journal of cancer research and clinical oncology,2019 05 06,"Ultrasound-targeted microbubble destruction (UTMD) has been reported to be a meritorious technique for drug targeting delivery.

SSeCKS is expressed in vascular endothelial cells (ECs). The atypical PKC isoform ζ (PKCζ) is a pathologic mediator of endothelial dysfunction. However, the functional significance of SSeCKS/PKCζ dimerization in the vascular endothelium remains poorly understood. Given this background, we investigated the effects of SSeCKS on endothelial dysfunction and elucidated the possible mechanism involved. Vascular endothelial dysfunction and inflammatory changes were induced by treatment with bacterial endotoxin lipopolysaccharide (LPS, a vascular endothelial toxicity inducer). LPS can increase the level of SSeCKS. However, we also found that depletion of SSeCKS aggravated the LPS-induced vascular endothelial dysfunction, upregulated pro-inflammatory proteins and phosphorylation level of PKCζ, increased ROS formation, decreased extracellular-signal-regulated kinase 5 (ERK5) transcriptional activity, and reduced eNOS expression. Further examination revealed that depletion of SSeCKS increased PKCζ/ERK5 dimerization. These findings provide preliminary evidence that the expression of SSeCKS induced by LPS, as a negative feedback mechanism, has the potential to improve endothelium-dependent relaxation in vascular disease conditions by inhibiting PKCζ-mediated reduction of ERK5 transactivation.",A retrospective study (2001-2017) of acute and chronic morbidity and mortality associated with Staphylococcus aureus bacteraemia in a tertiary neonatal intensive care unit.,https://www.ncbi.nlm.nih.gov/pubmed/30805770,Irish journal of medical science,2019 02 26,Staphylococcus aureus bacteraemia (SAB) in NICU patients can cause significant morbidity and mortality.,Antibacterial and antioxidant activities of traditional medicinal plants from the Erzurum region of Turkey.,https://www.ncbi.nlm.nih.gov/pubmed/30805769,Irish journal of medical science,2019 02 26,"In this study, 13 different extracts were investigated which are grown in the region of Erzurum.",Mapping a Syndemic of Psychosocial Risks During Pregnancy Using Network Analysis.,https://www.ncbi.nlm.nih.gov/pubmed/30805768,International journal of behavioral medicine,2019 06 10,"Psychosocial risks during pregnancy impact maternal health in resource-limited settings, and HIV-positive women often bear a heavy burden of these factors.

Heavy coronary calcification degrades the diagnostic accuracy for the detection of coronary arterial stenosis on computed tomography (CT). The aim of this study was to evaluate the value of CFVR measurement with PC-MRI for detecting significant coronary stenoses in patients with heavy coronary calcification. Sixteen patients (71 ± 8 years) with coronary calcium score above 400 who had suspected moderate coronary stenosis (50-69% diameter stenosis) on CT angiography were prospectively studied. The CFVR values, calculated as the ratio of peak flow velocity during hyperemia to the peak flow velocity at rest, were measured using breath-hold PC-MRI with 3 T system, and were compared with the results of quantitative coronary angiography (QCA). The mean coronary calcium score was 985 ± 378. CFVR was successfully determined with PC-MRI in 17/18 (94%) vessels. Using a threshold of 1.4 for CFVR, the sensitivity, specificity, and positive and negative predictive value for detecting ≥ 50% stenosis on QCA was 88% (7/8), 89% (8/9), 88% (7/8), 89% (8/9), respectively. When MRI CFVR measurements was added to CT angiography for the evaluation of coronary stenosis, the positive predictive value was 88% (7/8), while the positive predictive value of CT angiography alone was 44% (8/18). PC-MRI can provide noninvasive detection of altered CFVR caused by significant stenosis in patient. CFVR measurement by PC-MRI is useful for diagnosing physiologically significant coronary stenosis in patients with high calcium score on CT.",Evaluation of Risk Factors for Antipsychotic Polypharmacy in Inpatient Psychiatry Units of a Community Hospital: A Retrospective Analysis.,https://www.ncbi.nlm.nih.gov/pubmed/30805754,Community mental health journal,2019 02 26,"Antipsychotic polypharmacy (APP) is a common practice while treating severe mental illness but the benefits of APP over antipsychotic monotherapy is controversial.

B, Biochemical, systemic, and environmental physiology",2019 03 29,"Environmental humidity is thought to be a major determinant of evaporative cooling capacity at high air temperatures (Ta), but the technical challenges of experimentally manipulating humidity in respirometry chambers have resulted in far less being known about the effects of humidity compared to those of Ta. We tested the prediction that at Ta approaching and exceeding normothermic body temperature (Tb), high humidity would result in higher Tb, lower evaporative water loss (EWL) and/or higher resting metabolic rate (RMR) in a passerine bird, the white-browed sparrow-weaver (Plocepasser mahali). We used open-system flow-through respirometry to measure EWL, RMR and Tb in sparrow-weavers experiencing Ta = 36-44 °C and chamber humidities of 6, 13, 19 or 25 g m- 3. Increasing humidity was associated with significantly higher Tb. The strongest effect of humidity, however, involved significant increases in RMR; at Ta = 40 °C, RMR at a humidity of 25 g m- 3 was ~ 40% higher compared to a humidity of 6 g m- 3. Moreover, the interaction between Ta and humidity exerted a significant effect on the ratio of evaporative heat loss (EHL) to metabolic heat production (MHP), evident as an increasing effect of humidity with increasing Ta. Our results, when compared with those of the limited number of previous studies that involved similar ranges of Ta and humidity, reveal that the relative effects of humidity on EWL and RMR vary among avian taxa, and support the notion that the overall effect of high humidity is a reduction in maximum EHL/MHP.",Effect of pH and Ionic Strength on the Solubility of Quinoline: Back-to-Basics.,https://www.ncbi.nlm.nih.gov/pubmed/30805749,AAPS PharmSciTech,2019 04 05,"The interest of quinoline as a contaminant agent and as scaffold for the development of new therapeutic agent warrants to revisit the pH-solubility behavior of quinoline (Q) and quinoline derivatives (Q-derivatives) with possible salting-out effect. Q is a weak base with potential hazard upon exposure that may be occupational by inhalation or ingestion of or dermal exposure to particulates in certain industries; or simply by inhalation of cigarette smoke. In contrast, quinoline and its derivatives are useful in diverse therapeutic applications such as anticancer, antiseptic, antipyretic, antiviral, and antimalarial. These claims have raised the possibility of using quinoline motif for the synthesis of new drugs; however, it may act as a pollutant on soil and water as ionizable organic compounds (IOC). The solubility and partitioning behavior of Q may be a critical factor in determining the extent of inhalation and oral absorption or sorption onto soil and water. Studies on the solubility of Q have been reported; however, due to Q-derivatives distinctive usage, it is necessary to revisit and evaluate the solubility profile of Q at different pH levels and ionic strengths. This study reports a simple analytical method for determining the solubility of nitrogen heterocyclic compounds and possible salting-out effect as a function of pH, buffer concentration, and ionic strength. This information can be of value when developing Q-derivatives and to enhance understanding of Q as well as its derivatives behavior in the gastrointestinal tract or when evaluating the presence of Q as an environmental contaminant.",Ecological validity of manual grasping movements in an everyday-like grocery shopping task.,https://www.ncbi.nlm.nih.gov/pubmed/30805748,Experimental brain research,2019 06 12,"In our earlier research, kinematic and kinetic parameters of grasping differed significantly when participants grasped the same object once in a traditional laboratory paradigm, and once as part of a captivating computer game. We attributed this finding to the fact that grasping movements in the laboratory were repetitive and meaningless, while those in the computer game were embedded in complex behavior and served a meaningful purpose. In that work, we argued that grasping in the computer game is more characteristic of everyday life behavior; however, this conclusion has been criticized on the grounds that a computer game is not a typical everyday activity. The present study therefore compares grasping in a traditional laboratory paradigm to that in an indisputably everyday context: grocery shopping. Thirty-three young adults executed externally triggered arm movements to grasp nondescript objects (laboratory task, L) and place them on a tablet, or they walked through a fictitious grocery store towards a shelf to grasp grocery products and placed them into a shopping basket (everyday-like task, E). Size, shape, weight and location of to-be-grasped objects were identical in both tasks. We found that of the analyzed 16 kinematic parameters, 13 differed significantly between tasks. Specifically, grip apertures were larger, movements were slower and grip-transport coupling was more variable in E compared to L. We conclude that kinematic differences between both persist even if task is more realistic than in our earlier research. Our findings are compatible with the notion that movement planning is less stringent in E than in L.",Influence of uncemented humeral stem proximal geometry on stress distributions and torsional stability following total shoulder arthroplasty.,https://www.ncbi.nlm.nih.gov/pubmed/30805747,Journal of experimental orthopaedics,2019 03 29,"While surgeons tend to implant larger stems to improve torsional stability, numerous studies demonstrated that increasing humeral stem diameter could exacerbate stress-shielding and lead to bone resorption.

However, GA can be also affected by protein loss in urine and hemodialysis fluid. Therefore, in this study, we investigated the effect of albumin leakage induced by hemodialysis on GA. Nine patients undergoing hemodialysis with a large or small amount of albumin leakage were observed for 9 months in a crossover manner. As a result, it was shown that albumin leakage could affect GA, but the effect was practically small considering the prescription of diabetic drugs. The correlations between HbA1c and blood glucose levels and between GA and blood glucose levels were similar in our study. In conclusion, GA was a reliable indicator, even with the change of hemodialysis modality. The influence of albumin leakage induced by hemodialysis on GA was negligible practically. We should recognize that the preferable glycemic indicator in patients undergoing hemodialysis depends on the hemoglobin and albumin metabolism of each patient.",Genetic neuromuscular disorders: living the era of a therapeutic revolution.

The orally administered small-molecule risdiplam, which increases SMN protein levels similarly but also in peripheral organs, is tested in ongoing phase 2 and 3 trials. After positive results with phase 1 treatment with AAV9-SMN, the first gene therapy for SMA, a phase 3 clinical trial is ongoing. Ataluren is the first approved drug for Duchenne muscular dystrophy (DMD) patients with premature stop codon mutations and its indication has been recently extended since the age of 2 years. Exon skipping technology was and is currently tested in many phase 3 trials, and eteplirsen received a conditional approval by FDA for patients amenable to exon 51 skipping, but not by EMA. Many other compounds with different mechanisms of action are now tested in DMD by phase 2 and 3 trials, including phase 1 gene therapy. Other innovative approaches are under investigation, i.e., gene therapy in X-linked myotubular myopathy and Pompe disease, and antisense oligonucleotides in myotonic dystrophy type 1. Positive evidences are discussed about lamotrigine and ranolazine in non-dystrophic myotonias, chaperons in Pompe disease, and nucleosides in mitochondrial DNA depletion induced by thymidine kinase 2 deficiency."

The genome of AaBRV1 consists of two dsRNA segments (dsRNAs 1 and 2), 6,130 and 5,862 bp in size, respectively. The sequence contains two putative open reading frames (ORFs) which encode two polyproteins of 1,874 and 1,784 amino acids, respectively. Nucleotide sequence comparisons revealed that the two ORFs of AaBRV1 have the highest similarity 60.3% and 56.7%, respectively, with dsRNAs 1 and 2 of Botrytis porri RNA virus 1 (BpRV1). The two polyproteins encoded by dsRNA1 and dsRNA2 shared the highest amino acid identities with the cap-pol fusion protein (60.2%) and hypothetical protein (53.7%) of BpRV1, respectively.

To generate consistent estimates of broad-scale spatially continuous spring plant phenology at northern European latitudes (> 50° N) from 2000 to 2016, we used a novel vegetation index, the plant phenology index (PPI), derived from MODerate-resolution Imaging Spectroradiometer (MODIS) data. To obtain realistic and strong estimates, the phenology trends and their relationships with temperature and precipitation over the past 17 years were analyzed using a panel data method. We found that in the studied region the start of the growing season (SOS) has on average advanced by 0.30 day year-1. The SOS showed an overall advancement rate of 2.47 day °C-1 to spring warming, and 0.18 day cm-1 to decreasing precipitation in spring. The previous winter and summer temperature had important effects on the SOS but were spatially heterogeneous. Overall, the onset of SOS was delayed 0.66 day °C-1 by winter warming and 0.56 day °C-1 by preceding summer warming. The precipitation in winter and summer influenced the SOS in a relatively weak and complex manner. The findings indicate rapid recent phenological changes driven by combined seasonal climates in northern Europe. Previously unknown spatial patterns of phenological change and relationships with climate drivers are presented that improve our capacity to understand and foresee future climate effects on vegetation.",Development and validation of self- and caregiver-report of a distress screening tool for pediatric cancer survivors.,https://www.ncbi.nlm.nih.gov/pubmed/30805727,Supportive care in cancer : official journal of the Multinational Association of Supportive Care in Cancer,2019 02 26,To develop and validate the Distress Screening Tool (DST) for child and adolescent cancer survivors.,"Impact of time to antibiotic on hospital stay, intensive care unit admission, and mortality in febrile neutropenia.",https://www.ncbi.nlm.nih.gov/pubmed/30805726,Supportive care in cancer : official journal of the Multinational Association of Supportive Care in Cancer,2019 02 26,"To determine if time to antibiotics (TTA) improves outcomes of hospital length of stay, admission to the intensive care unit, and 30-day mortality in adult patients with febrile neutropenia.",Grapevine trunk diseases under thermal and water stresses.,https://www.ncbi.nlm.nih.gov/pubmed/30805725,Planta,2019 05 20,"Heat and water stresses, individually or combined, affect both the plant (development, physiology, and production) and the pathogens (growth, morphology, dissemination, distribution, and virulence). The grapevine response to combined abiotic and biotic stresses is complex and cannot be inferred from the response to each single stress. Several factors might impact the response and the recovery of the grapevine, such as the intensity, duration, and timing of the stresses. In the heat/water stress-GTDs-grapevine interaction, the nature of the pathogens, and the host, i.e., the nature of the rootstock, the cultivar and the clone, has a great importance. This review highlights the lack of studies investigating the response to combined stresses, in particular molecular studies, and the misreading of the relationship between rootstock and scion in the relationship GTDs/abiotic stresses. Grapevine trunk diseases (GTDs) are one of the biggest threats to vineyard sustainability in the next 30 years. Although many treatments and practices are used to manage GTDs, there has been an increase in the prevalence of these diseases due to several factors such as vineyard intensification, aging vineyards, or nursery practices. The ban of efficient treatments, i.e., sodium arsenite, carbendazim, and benomyl, in the early 2000s may be partly responsible for the fast spread of these diseases. However, GTD-associated fungi can act as endophytes for several years on, or inside the vine until the appearance of the first symptoms. This prompted several researchers to hypothesise that abiotic conditions, especially thermal and water stresses, were involved in the initiation of GTD symptoms. Unfortunately, the frequency of these abiotic conditions occurring is likely to increase according to the recent consensus scenario of climate change, especially in wine-growing areas. In this article, following a review on the impact of combined thermal and water stresses on grapevine physiology, we will examine (1) how this combination of stresses might influence the lifestyle of GTD pathogens, (2) learnings from grapevine field experiments and modelling aiming at studying biotic and abiotic stresses, and (3) what mechanistic concepts can be used to explain how these stresses might affect the grapevine plant status.",Coevolution pays off: Herpesviruses have the license to escape the DNA sensing pathway.,https://www.ncbi.nlm.nih.gov/pubmed/30805724,Medical microbiology and immunology,2019 02 26,"Early detection of viral invasion by pattern recognition receptors (PRR) is crucial for the induction of a rapid and efficient immune response. Cytosolic DNA sensors are the most recently described class of PRR, and induce transcription of type I interferons (IFN) and proinflammatory cytokines via the key adaptor protein stimulator of interferon genes (STING). Herpesviruses are a family of large DNA viruses widely known for their immense arsenal of proteins dedicated to manipulating and evading host immune responses. Tantamount to the significant role played by DNA sensors and STING in innate immune responses, herpesviruses have in turn evolved a range of mechanisms targeting virtually every step of this key signaling pathway. Strikingly, some herpesviruses also take advantage of this pathway to promote their own replication. In this review, we will summarize the current understanding of DNA sensing and subsequent induction of signaling and transcription, and showcase the close adaptation of herpesviruses to their host reflected by the myriad of viral proteins dedicated to modulating this critical innate immune pathway.",Which imaging modality in cochlear implant candidates?,https://www.ncbi.nlm.nih.gov/pubmed/30805723,European archives of oto-rhino-laryngology : official journal of the European Federation of Oto-Rhino-Laryngological Societies (EUFOS) : affiliated with the German Society for Oto-Rhino-Laryngology - Head and Neck Surgery,2019 06 13,"There is no guideline or consensus on preoperative radiologic imaging modality despite the fact that it has a vital importance in appropriate candidacy selection of cochlear implantation.

A systematic query of articles published from January 2010 to July 2018 was performed. The studies were assessed for patient's age, gender, body mass index, disease type, SILS procedure, surgical procedure, incision length, operation time, rates of conversion to open surgery, postoperative complications, mortality, length of hospital stay, and rates of reoperation. After an initial review, 11 reports were selected. The surgical techniques and instruments showed wide variation. The mean operation time for SILS tended to be shorter than that for multiport laparoscopic surgery (MLS). The reported rates of conversion to open surgery and postoperative complications were not very different from those reported for MLS.

However, little is known about how musicians and nonmusicians integrate auditory feedback from multiple sources to regulate their own timing or to (intentionally or unintentionally) coordinate with a partner. We examined how musical expertise modulates the role of auditory feedback in a two-person synchronization-continuation tapping task. Pairs of individuals were instructed to tap at a rate indicated by an initial metronome cue in all four auditory feedback conditions: no feedback, self-feedback (cannot hear their partner), other feedback (cannot hear themselves), or full feedback (both self and other). Participants within a pair were either both musically trained (musicians), both untrained (nonmusicians), or one musically trained and one untrained (mixed). Results demonstrated that all three pair types spontaneously synchronized with their partner when receiving other or full feedback. Moreover, all pair types were better at maintaining the metronome rate with self-feedback than with no feedback. Musician pairs better maintained the metronome rate when receiving other feedback than when receiving no feedback; in contrast, nonmusician pairs were worse when receiving other or full feedback compared to no feedback. Both members of mixed pairs maintained the metronome rate better in the other and full feedback conditions than in the no feedback condition, similar to musician pairs. Overall, nonmusicians benefited from musicians' expertise without negatively influencing musicians' ability to maintain the tapping rate. One implication is that nonmusicians may improve their beat-keeping abilities by performing tasks with musically skilled individuals.",Humans derive task expectancies from sub-second and supra-second interval durations.,https://www.ncbi.nlm.nih.gov/pubmed/30805704,Psychological research,2019 02 26,"Recent studies in the field of task switching have shown that humans can base expectancies for tasks on temporal cues. When tasks are predictable based on the duration of the preceding pre-target interval, humans implicitly adapt to this predictability, indicated by better performance in trials with validly compared to invalidly predicted tasks. Yet, it is not clear which internal timing mechanisms are involved. Previous research has suggested that intervals from the sub- and supra-second range are processed by distinct cognitive timing systems. As earlier studies on temporally predictable task switching have used predictive intervals stemming from both ranges, it was not yet clear if the time-based expectancy effect was driven by just one of the two internal timing systems. The present study used clearly sub-second intervals (10 ms and 500 ms) in Experiment 1, while clearly supra-second intervals (1500 ms and 3000 ms) were used in Experiment 2. Substantial adaptation effects were observed in both experiments, showing that sub- as well as supra-second timing systems are involved in time-based expectancies for tasks.

We aimed to determine the changes in RT distribution and corresponding antimicrobial resistance in clinical C. difficile isolates between two time points (2007 and 2017) in one tertiary care hospital in Germany. C. difficile isolates recovered in 2007 and in 2017 (80 isolates per year, respectively) from patients at a Tertiary Care University Hospital in North-Rhine Westphalia were analyzed. Isolates were characterized by ribotyping and susceptibility testing using gradient tests (metronidazole, vancomycin) and the disk diffusion method (moxifloxacin). Between 2007 and 2017, a clear switch from RT001 [18.75% (n = 15) in 2007 versus 3.75% (n = 3) in 2017 P = 0.003] to RT027 [0% in 2007 versus 21.25% (n = 17) in 2017] was evident. While minimal inhibitory concentrations (MICs) of vancomycin were stable, a significant metronidazole MIC creep was determined (MIC50 = 0.047 in 2007 versus MIC50 = 0.094 in 2017, P < 0.0001 using the Man-Whitney test). We detected one metronidazole-resistant isolate (0.6%). Interestingly, in total we encountered more isolates resistant to moxifloxacin in 2007 (42 (52.25%) than in 2017 [(30 (37.5%), P = 0.06)]). We could demonstrate that RT027 replaced RT001 in the last 10 years in our hospital. Furthermore, our data show a metronidazole MIC creep in C. difficile isolates over the last 10 years and an unexpected decrease of isolates resistant to moxifloxacin.",Deletion of the Type IV Secretion System Effector VceA Promotes Autophagy and Inhibits Apoptosis in Brucella-Infected Human Trophoblast Cells.,https://www.ncbi.nlm.nih.gov/pubmed/30805699,Current microbiology,2019 03 29,"Brucellosis is the most common zoonotic disease that caused by intracellular parasitic bacteria Brucella. The survival and replication of Brucella in the host depend on the type IV secretion system (T4SS). The T4SS system of Brucella has many components and secreted proteins. But the mechanism helped Brucella to evade the host defense is still not clear. The objective of the present study was to investigate the effects of VceA on autophagy and apoptosis in Brucella-infected embryonic trophoblast cells. We constructed the VceA mutant strain (2308ΔVceA) and complementary strain (2308ΔVceA-C) of Brucella abortus 2308 (S2308). The human trophoblast cells (HPT-8 cells) and mice were infected by S2308, 2308ΔVceA and 2308ΔVceA-C. The cell autophagy and apoptosis were detected. The Atg5, LC3-II and Bcl-2 mRNA expression were significantly increased in 2308ΔVceA group than the S2308 group, and mRNA expression of P62 and Caspase-3 were significantly decreased than the S2308 group. Western blotting, qPCR and flow cytometry analysis showed that 2308ΔVceA promoted autophagy and inhibited apoptosis. Mouse immunohistochemistry experiments showed that P62 protein was scattered coloring and Cytochrome C protein was scarcely in 2308ΔVceA group at the myometrium. These results indicated that 2308ΔVceA promoted autophagy and inhibited apoptosis in HPT-8 cells during Brucella infection.",Biogenic Gold Nanoparticle Supplementation to Plant Beneficial Pseudomonas monteilii was Found to Enhance its Plant Probiotic Effect.,https://www.ncbi.nlm.nih.gov/pubmed/30805698,Current microbiology,2019 03 29,"Rhizosphere provides unique space for intensive chemical conversation between plant and microorganisms. The common rhizobacterial mechanisms which have been demonstrated to promote plant growth include production of phytohormones, nitrogen fixation, synthesis of 1-aminocyclopropane-1-carboxylate deaminase (ACC deaminase) and phosphate solubilization. The microbially produced phytohormone indole-3-acetic acid (IAA) is considered to have significant role in interaction between plant and bacteria. Hence any substance with modulatory effect on rhizobacterial IAA production can expect to have its impact on plant-microbe interaction. With the advent of nanotechnology, nanoparticles are being used for diverse applications. However, applications of nanotechnology in agriculture have not been studied in detail. In the study, rhizospheric Pseudomonas monteilii was selected to investigate the concentration-dependent effect of biogenic gold nanoparticles (AuNPs) on its IAA production. For this, AuNPs synthesized by Bacillus subtilis SJ15 were characterized by UV-Vis spectroscopy, FT-IR, TEM and EDS. The results showed AuNPs to have spherical, hexagonal and triangular shapes with a size range of 12-32 nm and absorption peak at 545 nm. Further, various concentrations of AuNPs were used to identify its impact on IAA production by P. monteilii. From this, enhanced production of IAA by P. monteilii was found to take place in the presence of 50 µg/mL AuNPs. When Vigna unguiculata seedlings were grown in presence of 50 µg/mL of AuNPs, increased growth was observed. The results of the study thus showed the ability of AuNPs to augment the IAA-producing potential of P. monteilii.",Chocolate and risk of chronic disease: a systematic review and dose-response meta-analysis.,https://www.ncbi.nlm.nih.gov/pubmed/30805697,European journal of nutrition,2019 02 26,"Evidence for the association between chocolate intake and risk of chronic diseases is inconclusive.

Spatial distribution and temporal trend of the moss elements is discussed in this study. Different variability was found in moss metal concentrations that may reflect their spatial distribution patterns and may identify the location of the areas with high contamination of each element. Compared with the measurements of moss collected in 2010, significant differences were found in the concentrations of As, Cr, Cu, Hg, Ni, Pb, and Zn. The differences between two moss surveys may reflect changes in the bioavailability of the elements resulting from wet and dry deposition respectively during 2015 and 2010 moss biomonitoring survey. The pollution loading index that was applied to judge the content of metal contamination indicated moderate pollution throughout Albania. Examination of the potential ecological risk found that As, Cd, Cr, Hg, Ni, and Pb pose the highest potential ecological risks particularly in the areas with high metal contents. Factor analysis applied to investigate the probable sources of metals in the environment suggested that Al and Fe likely originated from natural sources.

Hippocrates and other prominent Greek (Hellenes) physicians in ancient times, Hellenistic, Roman, and Byzantine period were acute observers of disease course and of patients and were able to define many disorders. They wrote books on various aspects of medicine and these writings were the basis of medical practice and education in Europe and the Arabic world well into the seventeenth century. In 1821, Greece emerged from a long occupation by the Turks. In 1930, Adamantiades, a Greek Ophthalmologist, before Behcet of Turkey, described what is known as (Adamantiades)-Behcet disease. The first scientific Hellenic Society for Rheumatology (ERE) was established in 1960 and today ERE having been merged with the Professional Union of Greek rheumatologists (EPERE) is known as ERE-EPERE. Rheumatology is a strong specialty with 348 rheumatologists for a population of around 11 million. Greek rheumatologists have contributed to rheumatology science and practice, and are active physicians participating in the American College of Rheumatology and the EULAR annual congresses and in many educational postgraduate courses. ERE-EPERE formed therapeutic protocols for inflammatory and autoimmune rheumatic diseases which were incorporated in the electronic National prescription system. Rheumatologists are authorized to use this platform to prescribe biologicals free of charge for patients. ERE-EPERE publishes a peer-reviewed English language journal, the Mediterranean Journal of Rheumatology (MJR), an open access journal with no publication fees.

Glucocorticoid-induced osteoporosis (GIOP) develops in a time- and dose-dependent manner, but even at low doses, an increased risk of fragility fracture may be observed even within the first month of treatment. GIOP is mediated by multiple pathophysiologic mechanisms resulting in an inhibition of bone formation and an increase in bone resorption. The clinical assessment of GIOP has potential pitfalls since dual-energy X-ray absorptiometry (DXA) may underestimate the risk of fracture in patients treated with glucocorticoids. Many national organizations have developed guidelines for assessing fracture risk and treating patients with, or at risk for, GIOP. These groups advocate both antiresorptive agents and bone-forming agents based predominately on their efficacy in improving bone mineral density. Oral bisphosphonates are generally the first-line therapy for GIOP in most patients due to their proven efficacy, good safety, and low cost. For those patients at greater risk of fracture, teriparatide should be considered earlier, based on its ability to significantly reduce vertebral fractures when compared with alendronate.

However the goal-compliant implementation and long-term sustainability of such offers is often associated with major challenges.Over a period of 2.5 years, the program ""Lübeck Worlds of Movement Model"" was evaluated during its implementation in nursing homes in the city of Lübeck. The main objective was to discover promoting or inhibiting factors of the implementation process. Alongside other data collection, 52 partially structured, problem-oriented interviews were conducted with participating professionals (e.g., employees of the nursing homes, trainers). They were analyzed and structured in a topic-based manner.A number of promoting and inhibiting factors were identified. The structure of the program supports the participants' and trainers' motivation to stick to the program. However, it was not well received nor permanently adopted in all areas of the nursing homes. The lack of involvement of nursing staff and of anchoring the program in the organizational structure and culture of the facilities were two of the most important inhibiting factors. Furthermore the model is suitable only for a limited number of residents.

Despite the availability of safe and effective vaccines some people decide against vaccination, which leads to recurrent outbreaks of vaccine-preventable diseases. In order to achieve the common goals of eliminating certain infectious diseases and to protect individual health, it is necessary to understand the antecedents of (non-)vaccination.The 5C model describes five relevant psychological antecedents of vaccination: confidence, complacency (risk perceptions), constraints (barriers), calculation (extent of information search), and collective responsibility (willingness to protect the community). This contribution provides an overview of how these antecedents can be measured on an individual level and how interventions should be designed and evaluated to address the respective antecedents.Data from Germany show that structural changes to reduce practical barriers are important to improve vaccine uptake.

We further aim to calculate the 10-year ap vaccination coverage and missed vaccination opportunities as the proportion vaccinated with Td only among all Td and Tdap vaccinees (2007-2016).Within the national vaccination monitoring system KV-Impfsurveillance of the Robert Koch Institute and all Associations of Statutory Health Insurance Physicians, all persons receiving the relevant vaccinations were identified in nationwide statutory health insurance claims and related to the numbers of insured persons.The measles vaccination incidence in 2009 was 0.4%, increasing to ≥1.0% annually since 2013. It was higher in western than eastern federal states and higher among women than men. Of all measles vaccinations, 6.8% were given by pediatricians. Men received 2.6% of their vaccinations by gynecologists. The ap vaccination coverage was 32.4%. The proportion of exclusively Td vaccinated adults fell from 84% (2007) to 24% (from 2013 onwards).Since their recommendation, the KV-Impfsurveillance system shows increased uptake of measles and pertussis vaccines with regional and sex differences and is thus instrumental in their evaluation.

Meanwhile, the mechanism of PCE-induced thymopoiesis inhibition is not clear yet. Considering caffeine's pro-autophagy effects (lacking evidence in thymus) and the important role of autophagy in maintaining thymopoiesis, this study aimed to investigate whether PCE contributes to asthma susceptibility, and further explore the molecular mechanisms of thymopoiesis inhibition from the perspective of pro-autophagy effects of caffeine both in vivo and in vitro. The PCE mouse model was established by 96 mg/kg/day caffeine administration from gestational day (GD) 9-GD 18, and an asthma model was established on the offspring by ovalbumin sensitization and challenge. The results confirmed our hypothesis that PCE could suppress pulmonary CD4+T development and aggravate allergen-induced asthma symptoms in the offspring. In fetuses, PCE significantly suppressed A2AR-PKA signaling, upregulated Beclin1-LC3II autophagy, promoted Bcl10 degradation, reduced A20 expression, and inhibited CD4+T thymopoiesis. Similar results were also observed in 4 µM caffeine-treated thymocytes in vitro. Moreover, inhibiting A2AR by antagonist (SCH 58261) performed the same downstream biological effects as caffeine treatment, and autophagy inhibitor (BafilomycinA1) clearly abolished the caffeine-induced Bcl10 degradation and A20 suppression. In conclusion, our findings, for the first time, showed that PCE could attenuate CD4+T thymopoiesis and suppress pulmonary CD4+T development by directly enhancing autophagy in thymocytes, and provided a firm experimental evidence that PCE is a risk factor for postnatal asthma.",Bioengineering of microbial transglutaminase for biomedical applications.,https://www.ncbi.nlm.nih.gov/pubmed/30805670,Applied microbiology and biotechnology,2019 04 04,"Microbial transglutaminase (mTGase) is commonly known in the food industry as meat glue due to its incredible ability to ""glue"" meat proteins together.

We investigated whether older adults with stroke experience poorer sleep quality than older adults without stroke, and whether poor sleep quality attenuates cognitive performance among older adults with a history of stroke. Thirty-five age- and sex-matched older adults with stroke (age: 69.86 ± 1.13 years; 51.43% female) and without stroke (age: 69.83 ± 1.12; 51.43% female) were compared with respect to sleep quality using the MotionWatch8 (MW8) and Pittsburgh Sleep Quality Index (PSQI). Cognitive performance was indexed using the Alzheimer's Disease Assessment Scale Plus (ADAS-Cog Plus). Additionally, we examined whether poor sleep quality is associated with poorer cognitive performance among older adults with stroke. Older adults with stroke had longer MW8 measured sleep duration (27.82 ± 12.17 min; p = 0.03) and greater fragmentation (6.44 ± 2.24; p < 0.01), but did not differ in PSQI from their nonstroke peers. There was a significant group x sleep quality interaction for fragmentation (β = 0.02; p < 0.01) and efficiency (β = -0.03; p = 0.02) on ADAS-Cog Plus performance, whereby differences in cognitive performance between older adults with and without stroke were accentuated in the presence of poor sleep quality.

LC50s for adults were generated from feeding assays and ranged from 2.07 to 5.08 ppm, but grower reports indicate that onion thrips populations continue to be susceptible to spinetoram. Moreover, both regional and temporal variations in susceptibility were similar among these populations based on survival at individual concentrations tested, despite significant differences in LC50s. These results suggest some genetic heterogeneity among onion thrips populations and serve as a valuable reference for the continued monitoring of onion thrips susceptibility to spinetoram, contributing to ongoing efforts to manage insecticide resistance in this system.",Biochemical Resistance Mechanisms to Fenvalerate in Plutella xylostella (Lepidoptera: Plutellidae).,https://www.ncbi.nlm.nih.gov/pubmed/30805649,Journal of economic entomology,2019 05 22,"The diamondback moth, Plutella xylostella (Linnaeus) (Lepidoptera: Plutellidae), is one of the most important pests of cruciferous crops in Iran and is controlled mostly by fenvalerate. The susceptibility to fenvalerate was investigated for four populations of P. xylostella. Bioassay results indicated significant differences among the populations tested. The highest level of resistance to fenvalerate was obtained for the Khuzestan (Khz) population (resistance ratio = 9.5). Survival was suppressed by diethyl maleate, piperonylbutoxide, and triphenyl phosphate, which confirmed that resistance to fenvalerate is caused by glutathione S-transferases (GSTs), mixed function oxidases, and esterases, respectively. Up to 8.6-, 2-, 2.7-, and 1.75-fold increases in GSTs, esterase (α-naphthylacerate and β-naphthyl acetate as substrate), and cytochrome P450 monooxygenases activities in resistant strains when compared with the susceptible one, were observed, respectively. The expression of six GST genes of P. xylostella including GSTs1, GSTe2, GSTe4, GSTo4, GSTd4, and GSTd5 were analyzed. The quantitative PCR analysis showed that three of the PxGSTs had the highest expression levels in the Khz population. Two of the GSTs (GSTd4 and PxGSTe2) exhibited highest expression level in both Khz and Alborz (Alb) populations. Therefore, PxGST genes were involved in fenvalerate resistance in P. xylostella. Overall, the mechanisms of insecticide resistance in diamondback moth populations in four regions of Iran were related to GST, esterase, and cytochrome P450 monooxygenase activities.","Bridging the gap in outreach and compliance with mass drug administration for lymphatic filariasis elimination in an endemic district in Kerala, India: an intervention research approach.",https://www.ncbi.nlm.nih.gov/pubmed/30805648,Health education research,2019 05 10,"Lymphatic filariasis (LF), a neglected tropical disease is targeted for elimination globally by 2020. National Health Policy of India set the goal by 2017 and annual single-dose mass drug administration (MDA) with anti-filarial drugs is in operation in endemic districts since 2004. Performance and effectiveness of MDA was diverse across the nation and prevalence of infection continues above threshold level in 50% of endemic districts which requires alternative strategies. National programme aims at achieving >65% consumption for transmission control. Post 10 rounds of MDA in an endemic district of Kerala state, a three-arm study identified determinants in gap in outreach and consumption, based on which context-dependent intervention using social group work and networking (SGWN) was implemented and impact assessed. A spill over effect with overall increase in coverage and consumption rates irrespective of arms apparently is due to inclusive improvement in MDA programme whereas, significant relative improvement in intervention arm reflects effectiveness of SGWN strategy. Though reduction in microfilaria prevalence in all arms was observed, it was significant between intervention and comparison arm. This study highlights need for context-dependent communication strategy to improve MDA for accelerating LF elimination by the targeted 2020.",PIRSitePredict for protein functional site prediction using position-specific rules.,https://www.ncbi.nlm.nih.gov/pubmed/30805646,Database : the journal of biological databases and curation,2019 04 04,"Methods focused on predicting 'global' annotations for proteins (such as molecular function, biological process and presence of domains or membership in a family) have reached a relatively mature stage. Methods to provide fine-grained 'local' annotation of functional sites (at the level of individual amino acid) are now coming to the forefront, especially in light of the rapid accumulation of genetic variant data. We have developed a computational method and workflow that predicts functional sites within proteins using position-specific conditional template annotation rules (namely PIR Site Rules or PIRSRs for short). Such rules are curated through review of known protein structural and other experimental data by structural biologists and are used to generate high-quality annotations for the UniProt Knowledgebase (UniProtKB) unreviewed section. To share the PIRSR functional site prediction method with the broader scientific community, we have streamlined our workflow and developed a stand-alone Java software package named PIRSitePredict. We demonstrate the use of PIRSitePredict for functional annotation of de novo assembled genome/transcriptome by annotating uncharacterized proteins from Trinity RNA-seq assembly of embryonic transcriptomes of the following three cartilaginous fishes: Leucoraja erinacea (Little Skate), Scyliorhinus canicula (Small-spotted Catshark) and Callorhinchus milii (Elephant Shark).

We found that t(8;21) AML were extremely sensitive to THZ1, which triggered apoptosis after only 4 h. We used precision nuclear run-on transcription sequencing (PROseq) to define the global effects of THZ1 and other CDK inhibitors on RNA polymerase II dynamics. Inhibition of CDK7 using THZ1 caused wide-spread loss of promoter-proximal paused RNA polymerase. This loss of 5' pausing was associated with accumulation of polymerases in the body of a large number of genes. However, there were modest effects on genes regulated by 'super-enhancers'. At the 3' ends of genes, treatment with THZ1 suppressed RNA polymerase 'read through' at the end of the last exon, which resembled a phenotype associated with a mutant RNA polymerase with slower elongation rates. Consistent with this hypothesis, polyA site-sequencing (PolyA-seq) did not detect differences in poly A sites after THZ1 treatment. PROseq analysis after short treatments with THZ1 suggested that these 3' effects were due to altered CDK7 activity at the 5' end of long genes, and were likely to be due to slower rates of elongation.",Post-partum acute kidney injury: sorting placental and non-placental thrombotic microangiopathies using the trajectory of biomarkers.,https://www.ncbi.nlm.nih.gov/pubmed/30805631,"Nephrology, dialysis, transplantation : official publication of the European Dialysis and Transplant Association - European Renal Association",2019 02 26,"Among the severe complications of preeclampsia (PE), acute kidney injury (AKI) is problematic if features of thrombotic microangiopathy (TMA) are present.

Sometimes there is interest in whether children catch up to where they otherwise would have been had detrimental conditions not occurred, but the literature is confusing because of claims for evidence of catch-up growth based on inappropriate methods. This article examines the use of linear growth measures to evaluate intervention impact and catch-up. Focus on linear growth as a measure of impact has resulted in a lack of demonstrable intervention effects, evaluations that do not use measures responsive to nutrition-sensitive and integrated interventions, insufficient emphasis on adolescent girls and women before conception and children after the first 1000 d, and insufficient investment in developing other measures. Nutrition interventions may benefit children but may not discernibly affect linear growth deficits in immediate or intermediate periods. Interventions intended to affect one domain may have positive or negative impacts on others. Child nutrition and growth are part of early childhood development; the focus should be on improving conditions in which children grow and develop throughout childhood and adolescence because poor conditions in a population affect all children. To assess the impact of nutrition interventions, it is important to use a broad set of measures and indicators of outcomes and immediate and underlying determinants. The 4 criteria for demonstrating catch-up in growth, which are much more stringent than those for demonstrating intervention impact, require demonstration of the following: 1) an inhibiting condition and 2) reduced velocity during 1 period, 3) followed by alleviation of or compensation for the inhibiting condition, and 4) higher-than-normal velocity during a subsequent period. Partial catch-up growth is sometimes possible when constraints are removed, but whether it is beneficial to the child is not clear. Research is needed to develop, refine, and validate measures and indicators for the purposes intended.",A comparison between childhood and adult onset systemic lupus erythematosus adjusted for ethnicity from the 1000 Canadian Faces of Lupus Cohort.,https://www.ncbi.nlm.nih.gov/pubmed/30805629,"Rheumatology (Oxford, England)",2019 02 26,Childhood-onset SLE (cSLE) manifests differently than adult-onset SLE (aSLE).

A total of 1,536 day-old chicks were randomly distributed into 64 floor pens (24 chicks/pen; 0.08 m2/bird) and fed 1 of 8 dietary treatments (TRT) with 8 replicates per TRT. Experimental TRT were of either corn- (TRT 1 to 4) or wheat-based (TRT 5 to 8) origins. The 4 dietary TRT for each cereal grain source consisted of a positive control (PC) reference diet and 3 reduced AMEn diets (AMEn reduced 66 kcal/kg below PC) with supplemental xylanase at either 0 (negative control), 12,000, or 24,000 BXU/kg. Birds and feed were weighed at 1, 14, 26, and 40 d of age to determine BW gain, feed intake, and feed conversion ratio. At 26 and 40 d of age, cecal contents were collected and pooled per pen (7 birds/pen; 5 replicate pens/TRT) for VFA concentrations. No TRT differences (P > 0.05) in cumulative growth performance were observed. Likewise, no TRT differences (P > 0.05) in acetic or total VFA concentrations were observed at 26 or 40 d of age. However, cereal grain source (P < 0.05) influenced propionic, isobutyric, butyric, and isovaleric concentrations at 26 and 40 d of age with birds receiving the corn-based diets having higher (P < 0.05) cecal propionic, isobutyric, and isovaleric concentrations, and lower (P < 0.05) butyric acid concentrations than those fed the wheat-based diets. These results indicate that dietary cereal grain source may influence individual cecal VFA concentrations. However, supplemental xylanase did not affect broiler growth performance or cecal VFA concentrations. Therefore, future research evaluating factors limiting xylanase responses on broiler growth performance and cecal VFA production is warranted.",Developing a novel oral vitamin D3 intake bioassay to re-evaluate the vitamin D3 requirement for modern broiler chickens.,https://www.ncbi.nlm.nih.gov/pubmed/30805625,Poultry science,2019 02 26,"The present study was conducted to develop a non-traditional vitamin D3 (D3) intake bioassay with the objective of increasing the precision of D3 delivery to the chickens. For this purpose, newly hatched chickens (5 birds per cage) were allocated in battery brooders and randomly distributed into 8 treatments and 6 replicates per treatment. A basal corn-soy diet devoid of D3 containing calculated calcium and non-phytate phosphorus concentrations of 0.90 and 0.45%, respectively, was fed throughout a 21-D period. The first 9 D of the study served to deplete the maternal stores of D3 followed by a 12-h fasting period. From day 10 to the end of the trial, the birds were gavaged with graded levels of D3 obtained from a highly purified pharmaceutical grade D3 standard (99.8%) purchased from Sigma-Aldrich and dissolved in corn oil. Daily gavage treatments were based on estimated intake of 0, 50, 100, 200, 400, 800, 1,600, and 3,200 IU D3/kg of feed consumed over the last 12 D of the study. Precise cholecalciferol intake per kg of diet was adjusted based on actual daily feed intake per pen of birds. Performance data were evaluated from day 10 to 21. Percent tibia bone ash (TBA), tibia breaking strength (TBS), total mineral content, and total bone mineral density were obtained at day 21. The D3 treatments improved (P < 0.05) weight gain and feed efficiency. There was no linear or quadratic effect for any of the productivity performance variables. Graded levels of D3 improved (P < 0.05) TBA and TBS. Both were linearly increased (P < 0.05) in response to graded levels of D3. A quadratic response was observed for TBS only. Under the conditions of the present experiment and the average of 3 regression models, the D3 requirement for starter broilers was estimated at 285 IU D3/kg of feed when bone mineralization responses (TBA and TBS) were used as criteria to estimate the requirement.","HIV Epidemic Control in the United States-Assessment of Proposed UNAIDS Metrics, 2010-2015.",https://www.ncbi.nlm.nih.gov/pubmed/30805624,Clinical infectious diseases : an official publication of the Infectious Diseases Society of America,2019 02 26,"Epidemic control is necessary to eliminate HIV infection.

This experiment examined the effect of wheat DDGS, with and without exogenous xylanase on dietary apparent metabolizable energy (AME), total tract dry matter retention (DMR), nitrogen retention (NR), fat digestibility (FD) coefficients, feed intake (FI), bodyweight gain (BWG), eggs laid, mean egg weight, egg mass output, and egg quality characteristics including albumin height (AH), Haugh units (HU), yolk color, eggshell strength, and thickness. A total of 320 Hy-Line brown laying hens were randomly allocated to 80 enriched layer colonies (groups of 4). A total of 2 control wheat-soybean meal-based diets were formulated to contain 11.60 MJ/kg. One of the diets contained 300 g/kg wheat DDGS, while the other was DDGS free, with a respective crude protein content of 171.1 g/kg and 166.5 g/kg. Both diets were divided by 2 and half of them were supplemented with 2,500 U/kg of xylanase, resulting in 4 diets in total. Data was analyzed as a 2 × 2 factorial arrangement of treatments with analysis of variance (ANOVA). Diets were fed ad libitum from 17 to 43 wk of age and data was collected from 23 to 43 wk. The inclusion of wheat DDGS reduced (P < 0.001) dry matter retention (DMR), FI, BWG, eggs laid, mean egg weight, and egg mass. However, xylanase supplementation improved AME and NR in diets containing wheat DDGS and FD in diets without DDGS (DDGS × xylanase, P < 0.05) and tended to improve (P < 0.10) BWG and egg mass output. For egg quality measurements, the inclusion of DDGS improved (P = 0.046) HU values, eggshell strength (P < 0.001), and increased (P < 0.001) yolk color intensity. This experiment showed xylanase can be used to improve the AME and NR of DDGS-based diets.

The functional role of exosomes depends on their molecular cargo, including proteome content. Here we aimed to establish the proteome profile of exosomes released in vitro by irradiated UM-SCC6 cells derived from human head-and-neck cancer and to identify processes associated with radiation-affected proteins. Exosomes and other small extracellular vesicles were purified by size-exclusion chromatography from cell culture media collected 24 h after irradiation of cells with a single 2, 4 or 8 Gy dose, and then proteins were identified using a shotgun LC-MS/MS approach. Exosome-specific proteins encoded by 1217 unique genes were identified. There were 472 proteins whose abundance in exosomes was significantly affected by radiation (at any dose), including 425 upregulated and 47 downregulated species. The largest group of proteins affected by radiation (369 species) included those with increased abundance at all radiation doses (≥2 Gy). Several gene ontology terms were associated with radiation-affected exosome proteins. Among overrepresented processes were those involved in the response to radiation, the metabolism of radical oxygen species, DNA repair, chromatin packaging, and protein folding. Hence, the protein content of exosomes released by irradiated cells indicates their actual role in mediating the response to ionizing radiation.",Posaconazole for the treatment of allergic bronchopulmonary aspergillosis in patients with cystic fibrosis.,https://www.ncbi.nlm.nih.gov/pubmed/30805605,The Journal of antimicrobial chemotherapy,2019 05 17,Allergic bronchopulmonary aspergillosis (ABPA) can accelerate lung function decline in patients with cystic fibrosis (CF).

Better non-invasive techniques for epileptogenic zone localization are needed when MRI shows no lesion or an extensive lesion. The problem is interictal and ictal localization before propagation from the epileptogenic zone. High-density EEG (HDEEG) and magnetoencephalography (MEG) offer millisecond-order temporal resolution to address this but co-acquisition is challenging, ictal MEG studies are rare, long-term prospective studies are lacking, and fundamental questions remain. Should HDEEG-MEG discharges be assessed independently [electroencephalographic source localization (ESL), magnetoencephalographic source localization (MSL)] or combined (EMSL) for source localization? Which phase of the discharge best characterizes the epileptogenic zone (defined by intracranial EEG and surgical resection relative to outcome)? Does this differ for interictal and ictal discharges? Does MEG detect mesial temporal lobe discharges? Thirteen patients (10 non-lesional, three extensive-lesional) underwent synchronized HDEEG-MEG (72-94 channel EEG, 306-sensor MEG). Source localization (standardized low-resolution tomographic analysis with MRI patient-individualized boundary-element method) was applied to averaged interictal epileptiform discharges (IED) and ictal discharges at three phases: 'early-phase' (first latency 90% explained variance), 'mid-phase' (first of 50% rising-phase, 50% mean global field power), 'late-phase' (negative peak). 'Earliest-solution' was the first of the three early-phase solutions (ESL, MSL, EMSL). Prospective follow-up was 3-21 (median 12) months before surgery, 14-39 (median 21) months after surgery. IEDs (n = 1474) were recorded, seen in: HDEEG only, 626 (42%); MEG only, 232 (16%); and both 616 (42%). Thirty-three seizures were captured, seen in: HDEEG only, seven (21%); MEG only, one (3%); and both 25 (76%). Intracranial EEG was done in nine patients. Engel scores were I (9/13, 69%), II (2/13,15%), and III (2/13). MEG detected baso-mesial temporal lobe epileptogenic zone sources. Epileptogenic zone OR [odds ratio(s)] were significantly higher for earliest-solution versus early-phase IED-surgical resection and earliest-solution versus all mid-phase and late-phase solutions. ESL outperformed EMSL for ictal-surgical resection [OR 3.54, 95% confidence interval (CI) 1.09-11.55, P = 0.036]. MSL outperformed EMSL for IED-intracranial EEG (OR 4.67, 95% CI 1.19-18.34, P = 0.027). ESL outperformed MSL for ictal-surgical resection (OR 3.73, 95% CI 1.16-12.03, P = 0.028) but was outperformed by MSL for IED-intracranial EEG (OR 0.18, 95% CI 0.05-0.73, P = 0.017). Thus, (i) HDEEG and MEG source solutions more accurately localize the epileptogenic zone at the earliest resolvable phase of interictal and ictal discharges, not mid-phase (as is common practice) or late peak-phase (when signal-to-noise ratios are maximal); (ii) from empirical observation of the differential timing of HDEEG and MEG discharges and based on the superiority of ESL plus MSL over either modality alone and over EMSL, concurrent HDEEG-MEG signals should be assessed independently, not combined; (iii) baso-mesial temporal lobe sources are detectable by MEG; and (iv) MEG is not 'more accurate' than HDEEG-emphasis is best placed on the earliest signal (whether HDEEG or MEG) amenable to source localization.

By analyzing the geometries, electronic structures, and magnetic behaviors of two different terminations (Co2/O and FeAl/O terminations), we find that the two terminations in the interface region form anti-bonding and bonding states, reconstructing the energy gap, changing the magnetic moment of O atoms, and improving the spin-polarization (-82%). This phenomenon can be ascribed to the charge transfer and hybridization between Co/Fe 3d and O 2p states, which also results in a bowknot orbital shape of Co atoms with Co2/O termination and an ankle shape of Co atoms with FeAl/O termination far away from the interface. Moreover, there are spin-splitting transmission gaps with the Co2/O-termination around the Fermi level, while the transmission gaps with the FeAl/O-termination are closed and thus show a typical metallic character. Our findings will guide the experimental design of magneto-Seebeck devices for future spintronic applications.","Correction: A cobalt arylphosphonate MOF - superior stability, sorption and magnetism.",https://www.ncbi.nlm.nih.gov/pubmed/30805574,"Chemical communications (Cambridge, England)",2019 05 15,"Correction for 'A cobalt arylphosphonate MOF - superior stability, sorption and magnetism' by Yunus Zorlu et al., Chem.

Processes & impacts,2019 04 18,"Trifluralin and acetochlor are two nitrogen-containing current use herbicides. While both herbicides have been observed in the atmosphere and have the potential to undergo atmospheric oxidation before deposition to off-target areas, the atmospheric photooxidation chemistry of these species is poorly understood. We use an oxidative flow reactor to expose the two herbicides to increasing concentrations of OH radicals, detecting pesticides and products using an iodide chemical ionization mass spectrometer. We identify new oxidation products and propose photooxidation mechanisms for trifluralin and acetochlor. Both herbicides contain reduced organic nitrogen atoms, and their OH oxidation produces isocyanic acid. While aerosol was observed in the flow reactor only for acetochlor, our results indicate that OH oxidation of neither herbicide would contribute to secondary organic aerosol formation under typical ambient atmospheric conditions. However, high wall losses of both pesticides in the flow reactor suggests that partitioning to pre-existing aerosol may occur and enable subsequent transport in the atmosphere.",DeepSSM: A Deep Learning Framework for Statistical Shape Modeling from Raw Images.,https://www.ncbi.nlm.nih.gov/pubmed/30805572,"Shape in Medical Imaging : International Workshop, ShapeMI 2018, held in conjunction with MICCAI 2018, Granada, Spain, September 20, 2018, Proceedings. International Workshop on Shape in Medical Imaging (2018 : Granada, Spain)",2019 02 28,"Statistical shape modeling is an important tool to characterize variation in anatomical morphology. Typical shapes of interest are measured using 3D imaging and a subsequent pipeline of registration, segmentation, and some extraction of shape features or projections onto some lower-dimensional shape space, which facilitates subsequent statistical analysis. Many methods for constructing compact shape representations have been proposed, but are often impractical due to the sequence of image preprocessing operations, which involve significant parameter tuning, manual delineation, and/or quality control by the users. We propose DeepSSM: a deep learning approach to extract a low-dimensional shape representation directly from 3D images, requiring virtually no parameter tuning or user assistance. DeepSSM uses a convolutional neural network (CNN) that simultaneously localizes the biological structure of interest, establishes correspondences, and projects these points onto a low-dimensional shape representation in the form of PCA loadings within a point distribution model. To overcome the challenge of the limited availability of training images with dense correspondences, we present a novel data augmentation procedure that uses existing correspondences on a relatively small set of processed images with shape statistics to create plausible training samples with known shape parameters. In this way, we leverage the limited CT/MRI scans (40-50) into thousands of images needed to train a deep neural net. After the training, the CNN automatically produces accurate low-dimensional shape representations for unseen images. We validate DeepSSM for three different applications pertaining to modeling pediatric cranial CT for characterization of metopic craniosynostosis, femur CT scans identifying morphologic deformities of the hip due to femoroacetabular impingement, and left atrium MRI scans for atrial fibrillation recurrence prediction.",On the Evaluation and Validation of Off-the-shelf Statistical Shape Modeling Tools: A Clinical Application.,https://www.ncbi.nlm.nih.gov/pubmed/30805571,"Shape in Medical Imaging : International Workshop, ShapeMI 2018, held in conjunction with MICCAI 2018, Granada, Spain, September 20, 2018, Proceedings. International Workshop on Shape in Medical Imaging (2018 : Granada, Spain)",2019 02 28,"Statistical shape modeling (SSM) has proven useful in many areas of biology and medicine as a new generation of morphometric approaches for the quantitative analysis of anatomical shapes. Recently, the increased availability of high-resolution in vivo images of anatomy has led to the development and distribution of open-source computational tools to model anatomical shapes and their variability within populations with unprecedented detail and statistical power. Nonetheless, there is little work on the evaluation and validation of such tools as related to clinical applications that rely on morphometric quantifications for treatment planning. To address this lack of validation, we systematically assess the outcome of widely used off-the-shelf SSM tools, namely ShapeWorks, SPHARM-PDM, and Deformetrica, in the context of designing closure devices for left atrium appendage (LAA) in atrial fibrillation (AF) patients to prevent stroke, where an incomplete LAA closure may be worse than no closure. This study is motivated by the potential role of SSM in the geometric design of closure devices, which could be informed by population-level statistics, and patient-specific device selection, which is driven by anatomical measurements that could be automated by relating patient-level anatomy to population-level morphometrics. Hence, understanding the consequences of different SSM tools for the final analysis is critical for the careful choice of the tool to be deployed in real clinical scenarios. Results demonstrate that estimated measurements from ShapeWorks model are more consistent compared to models from Deformetrica and SPHARM-PDM. Furthermore, ShapeWorks and Deformetrica shape models capture clinically relevant population-level variability compared to SPHARM-PDM models.",Psychosexual Consequences of Female Genital Mutilation and the Impact of Reconstructive Surgery: A Narrative Review.,https://www.ncbi.nlm.nih.gov/pubmed/30805570,Health equity,2019 02 27,"Purpose: We aim to provide a comprehensive overview of the health consequences of female genital mutilation/cutting (FGM/C), with a particular focus on the psychosexual implications of this practice and the overall impact of reconstructive plastic surgery. Methods: A MEDLINE search through PubMed was performed to identify the best quality evidence published studies in English language on long-term health consequences of FGM/C. Results: Women with FGM/C are more likely to develop psychological disorders, such as post-traumatic stress disorder, anxiety, somatization, phobia, and low self-esteem, than those without FGM/C. Most studies showed impaired sexual function in women with FGM/C. In particular, women with FGM/C may be physiologically less capable of becoming sexually stimulated than uncut women. Reconstructive surgery could be beneficial, in terms of both enhanced sexual function and body image. However, prospective studies on the impact of reconstructive surgery are limited, and safety issues should be addressed. Conclusion: Although it is clear that FGM/C can cause devastating immediate and long-term health consequences for girls and women, high-quality data on these issues are limited. Psychosexual complications need to be further analyzed to provide evidence-based guidelines and to improve the health care of women and girls with FGM/C.

Mutations in sdh genes cause degenerative disorders and often lead to death. Therapies for such pathologies are based on a combination of vitamins and dietary supplements, and are rarely effective. In Drosophila, mutations in several of the genes encoding SDH resemble the pathology of SDH deficiency in humans, enabling the Drosophila model to be used in finding treatments for this condition. Here we show that exposure to the drug rapamycin improves the survival of sdh mutant strains, the activity of SDH and the impaired climbing associated with sdh mutations. However, the production of reactive oxygen species, the oxygen consumption of isolated mitochondria and the resistance to hyperoxia were minimally affected. Our results contribute to the current research seeking a treatment for mitochondrial disease.","A study on the prevalence of heavy metals, pesticides, and microbial contaminants and antibiotics resistance pathogens in raw salad vegetables sold in Dhaka, Bangladesh.",https://www.ncbi.nlm.nih.gov/pubmed/30805565,Heliyon,2019 03 08,"The presence of undesirable heavy metals, pesticide residues, and microbial contaminants in fresh produces is a worldwide public health concern.

Results showed the presence of heavy metals residues were within the acceptable limits of local and international standards. None of the above-mentioned pesticides were found in tomato and cucumber samples but presence of Dimethoate was noticed in 13 coriander samples (12.94-158.3 μg/kg) and 7 lettuce samples (9.6-74.8 μg/kg) exceeding the maximum permissible limit of EU guideline. The microbiological analysis showed irrespective of RSV types, total aerobic bacteria was present in higher number (4.0-7.0 log CFU/g), whereas 3.36-5.57 log CFU/g coliform count was recorded. In comparison with retail markets, lower level of total aerobic, and coliform bacterial presence was observed in the samples collected from sophisticated shops, but presence of E. coli and Salmonella spp. were evident in more than 60% samples in these shops. However, 50% and 33% samples from wholesale and retail markets respectively were noticed to be contaminated with Staphylococcus spp. Irrespective of RSV types, isolated E. coli were found resistance to 2-5 different antibiotics, where Salmonella spp. isolated from cucumber and coriander leaves showed resistance against 4-8 different antimicrobials. Therefore, the study results demonstrated that, the presence of residual pesticides, multidrug resistant E. coli and Salmonella spp. in the RSV samples posing concern when consumed raw.

Though the focus is on policies at the state-level, local government and electric utility policies are documented when they collectively cover a majority of the state׳s population or electricity customers. Data were collected first from the Alternative Fuel Database Center (AFDC), then supplemented with information taken from more than 300 government (state, city, and county) and utility websites. Nine separate EV-related policy instruments were identified, organized as capital financial incentives, operating financial incentives, preferred access incentives, and disincentives. Though most policy instruments act to support EV adoption, an increasing number of U.S. states are adopting an annual fee for EVs to support road maintenance costs. For vehicle purchase incentives, home charger subsidies, vehicle license tax or registration fees, and the annual EV fee, data was gathered on the money value of these policy instruments. For emissions inspection exemptions and high occupancy vehicle (HOV) lane access, an annual money value for each policy instrument is estimated. The other policy instruments, time-of-use (TOU) rates for electricity, designated parking and free parking, are reported as binary variables. For further discussion of EV policy instruments as well as interpretation of their values, see Wee et al. [1].

Altered Insulin Receptor (IR) signaling is a common feature of both diseases, and insulin has potent bone anabolic functions. Several previous studies have demonstrated that loss of IR in bone cells results in disrupted bone homeostasis during early post-natal growth. Here we have deleted IR in S100a4-lineage cells (IRcKOS100a4) and assessed the effects on bone homeostasis in both young (15 weeks) and older adult (48 weeks) mice. S100a4-Cre has previously been shown to target the perichondrium during bone development, and here we show that S100a4 is expressed by adult trabecular and cortical bone cells, and that S100a4-Cre effectively targets adult bone, resulting in efficient deletion of IRβ. Deletion of IRβ in S100a4-lineage cells does not affect initial bone acquisition or homeostasis with no changes in cortical, trabecular or mechanical properties at 15-weeks of age, relative to wild type (WT) littermates. However, by 48-weeks of age, IRcKOS100a4 mice display substantial declines in trabecular bone volume, bone volume fraction and torsional rigidity, relative to age-matched WT controls.

The objective of this study was to investigate the feasibility and performance of loop-mediated isothermal amplification (LAMP) in the diagnosis of pulmonary TB in county-level microscopy centers in Qingdao, Eastern China. A total of 523 presumptive TB patients were consecutively recruited between July 2017 and April 2018, and 22 patients were excluded from the analysis. Of 102 culture-positive cases, TB-LAMP identified 91 cases, demonstrating a sensitivity of 89.2%. In comparison, the sensitivity of routine smear microscopy was 69.6% (71/102), which was significantly lower than that of TB-LAMP (P=0.001). In addition, TB-LAMP sensitivities in smear-positive and smear-negative samples were 98.6% and 67.7%, respectively. In conclusion, our data demonstrate that TB-LAMP outperforms conventional smear microscopy in TB diagnosis, which could be used as an alternative method for smear microscopy in resource-limited settings in China.",Preventive Effects of Evodiamine on Dexamethasone-Induced Osteoporosis in Zebrafish.,https://www.ncbi.nlm.nih.gov/pubmed/30805367,BioMed research international,2019 06 13,"The aim of this study was to investigate the effect of evodiamine (EV) on dexamethasone-induced osteoporosis in zebrafish. Zebrafish larvae were exposed to different concentrations of dexamethasone to obtain the osteoporosis in zebrafish. Calcium, phosphorus, and alizarin red staining determination were performed to evaluate the effects of EV on bone mineralization. Alkaline phosphatase (ALP), hydroxyproline (HP), and tartrate resistant acid phosphatase (TRAP) were also measured by commercial kits. The expression of MMP3-OPN-MAPK pathway in zebrafish was measured by Western blot. RT-PCR was used to determine mRNA levels of MMP3, OPN, and MAPK. EV could significantly increase the content of calcium and phosphorus. The results of alizarin red staining showed that EV could significantly increase the calcium sink of horse fish, increasing the area of bone formation. EV could increase the content of hydroxyproline in zebrafish. EV also increased ALP and TRAP in zebrafish. Western blot and RT-PCR results showed that EV restored the MMP3-OPN-MAPK pathway in zebrafish. In conclusion, we found that EV can alleviate dexamethasone-induced osteoporosis in zebrafish. The mechanism is related to activating MMP3-OPN-MAPK pathway and then activating bone remodeling.",Translation and Initial Validation of the Chinese Version of the Action Research Arm Test in People with Stroke.,https://www.ncbi.nlm.nih.gov/pubmed/30805366,BioMed research international,2019 06 13,This study aimed to translate the English version of the Action Research Arm Test (ARAT) into Chinese and to evaluate the initial validation of the Chinese version (C-ARAT) in patients with a first stroke.,Modified Posterior Scleral Reinforcement as a Treatment for High Myopia in Children and Its Therapeutic Effect.,https://www.ncbi.nlm.nih.gov/pubmed/30805365,BioMed research international,2019 06 13,To investigate the safety and therapeutic effect of a modified posterior scleral reinforcement (PSR) in treating high myopia.,Changing Sources of Stigma against Patients with HIV/AIDS in the Rapid Expansion of Antiretroviral Treatment Services in Vietnam.,https://www.ncbi.nlm.nih.gov/pubmed/30805364,BioMed research international,2019 06 13,"Stigmatization against HIV/AIDS greatly hinders efforts to increase the accessibility and utilization of HIV/AIDS services to meet the 90-90-90 goal. This study assessed the stigmatization and discrimination experienced by people living with HIV (PLWH) across multiple social settings such as family, community, and healthcare facilities in Vietnam. A total of 1,016 patients (63.8% males, mean age = 35.4) participated in a cross-sectional study using a culturally tailored HIV stigma measure in three HIV-epidemic-concentrated cities in Vietnam. Zero-inflated Poisson models were used to examine factors associated with the number of types of stigma that patients experienced. 86.2% PLWH reported experiencing stigma against HIV/AIDS, more frequently from their community (62.8%) and family (30.2%) than from health care facilities (8%). The level of stigma from community reported by PLWH is associated with socioeconomic status (e.g., income, occupation). The poor and middle economic classes and unemployed patients reported more stigmatization and discrimination from the community. Across all settings, PLWH experienced fewer stigmatization over the course of ART indicating the benefits of rapidly expanded ART programs. PLWH reported more stigmatization and discrimination at the provincial level of the health administration. Those with the history of drug injection reported significantly less stigmatization from healthcare setting. More culturally tailored interventions to reduce stigmatization overall to improve the quality of life and health outcomes of PLWH should be warranted to achieve the 90-90-90 goal. Improving HIV-related knowledge of the general population and providing opportunities for PLWH to be reintegrated into should be considered. Using mass media with positive messages and images would also foster positive attitudes towards HIV/AIDS among the population and could potentially change social values. Continuous training of health staffs' attitude could minimize the occurrence of stigmatization and discrimination at healthcare facilities.",Can Fiber Application Affect the Fracture Strength of Endodontically Treated Teeth Restored with a Low Viscosity Bulk-Fill Composite?,https://www.ncbi.nlm.nih.gov/pubmed/30805363,BioMed research international,2019 06 13,The aim of this study is to evaluate the effects of different fiber insertion techniques and thermomechanical aging on the fracture resistance of endodontically treated mandibular premolar teeth restored using bulk-fill composites.,Impact of Deficiencies in Branched-Chain Fatty Acids and Staphyloxanthin in Staphylococcus aureus.,https://www.ncbi.nlm.nih.gov/pubmed/30805362,BioMed research international,2019 06 13,"Staphylococcus aureus is a well-known human pathogen with the ability to cause mild superficial skin infections to serious deep-tissue infections, such as osteomyelitis, pneumonia, and infective endocarditis. A key to S. aureus infections and its pathogenicity is its ability to survive in adverse environments, especially at lower temperatures, by regulation of its cell membrane. Branched-chain fatty acids (BCFAs) and staphyloxanthin have been shown to regulate membrane fluidity and staphylococcal virulence. This study was conducted with the hypothesis that the simultaneous lack of BCFAs and staphyloxanthin will have a far greater implication on environmental survival and virulence of S. aureus. Lack of a functional branched-chain α-keto acid dehydrogenase (BKD) enzyme because of a mutation in the lpdA gene led to a decrease in the production of BCFAs, membrane fluidity, slower growth, and poor in vivo survival of S. aureus. A mutation in the crtM gene eliminated the production of staphyloxanthin but it did not affect membrane BCFA levels, fluidity, growth, or in vivo survival. A crtM:lpdA double mutant showed much slower growth and attenuation compared to individual mutants. The results of this study suggest that simultaneous targeting of the BCFA and staphyloxanthin biosynthetic pathways can be a strategy to control S. aureus infections.",Diet Composition Differentially Affects Insulin Pathway Compromised and Control Flies.,https://www.ncbi.nlm.nih.gov/pubmed/30805360,BioMed research international,2019 06 13,"The insulin pathway is an anabolic pathway that controls, amongst other things, glucose homeostasis. It is an evolutionarily conserved pathway. Disruptions in insulin pathway functions can lead to diabetic states. Diabetes, a very common occurrence in modern life, afflicts a significant portion of the population of developed and developing countries worldwide. Yet, few studies have addressed the evolution of diabetic states on a long-term basis. Here, we cultured three different insulin pathway signaling compromised flies (heteroallelic mutant combinations, akin to diabetes mellitus type II) and wild type control flies, for the extent of one generation in different isocaloric diets fed at libitum, with or without extra methionine added. All fly stocks have a homogenized genetic background. We measured weight, total lipid, and carbohydrate content of adults at two different time points, and survival of adults reared in some of the different diets. Results show that, despite the fact that all diet regimes allow survival of at least a fraction of flies to adulthood, life histories are significantly different. Higher protein content diets promote better survival compared to higher percentage lipid and carbohydrate diets, and added methionine promotes survival in moderately reduced protein content diets. In mutants, survival is significantly reduced, and added methionine generally has an effect, albeit a more modest one. Our results highlight the value of higher percentage protein diets, and differences in effects in ""healthy"" versus ""diabetic"" states. They also show that added methionine, proposed as a ""sensor"" for protein content in food for flies, leads to differential effects depending on the adequacy of the diet regime."

In contrast, errors in veterinary medicine are rarely discussed, and there is little known about their nature and frequency. This study aimed to evaluate the type and severity of medical errors reported in three veterinary hospitals. The voluntary online incident reporting systems of a small animal teaching hospital, large animal teaching hospital, and small animal multi-specialty practice were reviewed. Reports were included if they were entered between February 2015 and March 2018, and involved an incident pertaining to patient safety. The reporting systems classified errors into the following categories: drug, iatrogenic, system, communication, lab, oversight, staff, or equipment errors. In addition, all incidents were classified as resulting in either a near miss, harmless hit, adverse incident, or unsafe condition. Adverse incidents were further evaluated retrospectively for error severity. A total of 560 incident reports were included for analysis. Drug errors were the most frequently reported in all three hospitals, followed by failures of communication. Errors most commonly reached patients without causing harm (45%); however, 15% of all incidents resulted in patient harm. Eight percent of patients harmed suffered permanent morbidity or death. A higher proportion of adverse incidents were reported in the small animal teaching hospital than in the other two practice settings. This study demonstrates that medical errors have a substantial impact on veterinary patients. Establishing that drug and communication errors are most frequent in a variety of hospitals is the first step toward interventions to improve patient safety and outcomes in veterinary medicine.",Long-Term Safety and Efficacy of Single or Repeated Intra-Articular Injection of Allogeneic Neonatal Mesenchymal Stromal Cells for Managing Pain and Lameness in Moderate to Severe Canine Osteoarthritis Without Anti-inflammatory Pharmacological Support: Pilot Clinical Study.,https://www.ncbi.nlm.nih.gov/pubmed/30805348,Frontiers in veterinary science,2019 02 27,"Objective: To explore the long-term safety and efficacy of canine allogeneic mesenchymal stromal cells (MSC) administered intra-articularly as single or repeated injections in appendicular joints of dogs affected by moderate to severe refractory osteoarthritis. Study Design: 22 pet dogs were recruited into a non-randomized, open and monocentric study initially administering one cellular injection. A second injection was offered after 6 months to owners if the first injection did not produce expected results. Materials and Methods: Anti-inflammatory treatment (if prescribed) was discontinued at last one week before the onset of treatment. Each injection consisted of at least 10 million viable neonatal allogeneic mesenchymal stromal cells obtained from fetal adnexa. Medical data was collected from veterinary clinical evaluations of joints up to 6 months post-injection and owner's assessment of their dog's mobility and well-being followed for a further 2 years when possible. Results: Mild, immediate self-limiting inflammatory joint reactions were observed in 5/22 joints after the first injection, and in almost all dogs having a subsequent injection. No other MSC-related adverse medical events were reported, neither during the 6 months follow up visits, nor during the long-term (2-years) safety follow up. Veterinary clinical evaluation showed a significant and durable clinical improvement (up to 6 months) following MSC administration. Eight dogs (11 joints) were re-injected 6 months apart, sustaining clinical benefits up to 1 year. Owner's global satisfaction reached 75% at 2 years post-treatment Conclusion: Our data suggest that a single or repeated intra-articular administration of neonatal MSC in dogs with moderate to severe OA is a safe procedure and confer clinical benefits over a 24-month period. When humoral response against MSC is investigated by flow cytometry, a positive mild and transient signal was detected in only one dog from the studied cohort, this dog having had a positive clinical outcome.",The Bone-Vasculature Axis: Calcium Supplementation and the Role of Vitamin K.,https://www.ncbi.nlm.nih.gov/pubmed/30805347,Frontiers in cardiovascular medicine,2019 02 27,"Calcium supplements are broadly prescribed to treat osteoporosis either as monotherapy or together with vitamin D to enhance calcium absorption. It is still unclear whether calcium supplementation significantly contributes to the reduction of bone fragility and fracture risk. Data suggest that supplementing post-menopausal women with high doses of calcium has a detrimental impact on cardiovascular morbidity and mortality. Chronic kidney disease (CKD) patients are prone to vascular calcification in part due to impaired phosphate excretion. Calcium-based phosphate binders further increase risk of vascular calcification progression. In both bone and vascular tissue, vitamin K-dependent processes play an important role in calcium homeostasis and it is tempting to speculate that vitamin K supplementation might protect from the potentially untoward effects of calcium supplementation. This review provides an update on current literature on calcium supplementation among post-menopausal women and CKD patients and discusses underlying molecular mechanisms of vascular calcification. We propose therapeutic strategies with vitamin K2 treatment to prevent or hold progression of vascular calcification as a consequence of excessive calcium intake.",DNA Uptake by Type IV Filaments.,https://www.ncbi.nlm.nih.gov/pubmed/30805346,Frontiers in molecular biosciences,2019 02 28,"Bacterial uptake of DNA through type IV filaments is an essential component of natural competence in numerous gram-positive and gram-negative species.

Most of the existing knowledge comes from registry data. Objective: This present review now reports on such findings as are available on groin hernia in women. Materials and Methods: A systematic search of the available literature was performed in September 2018 using Medline, PubMed, Google Scholar, and the Cochrane Library. For the present analysis 80 publications were identified. Results: The lifetime risk of developing a groin hernia in women is 3-5.8%. The proportion of women in the overall collective of operated groin hernias is 8.0-11.5%. In women, the proportion of femoral hernias is 16.7-37%. Risk factors for development of a groin hernia in women of high age and with a positive family history. A groin hernia during pregnancy should not be operated on. The rate of emergency procedures in women, at 14.5-17.0%, is 3 to 4-fold higher than in men and at 40.6% is even higher for femoral hernia. Therefore, watchful waiting is not indicated in women. During surgical repair of groin hernia in females the presence of a femoral hernia should always be excluded and if detected should be repaired using a laparo-endoscopic or open preperitoneal mesh technique. A higher rate of chronic postoperative inguinal pain must be expected in females.

POC, is essentially composed of water, olive pulp and olive skin, and is rich in several valuable bioactive compounds. Moreover, it still contains about 8-12% residual olive oil. We characterized the main bioactive compounds in POC from black olives (cv. Leccino and Cellina di Nardò) and also verified the biotechnological aptitude of selected yeast and lactic acid bacteria from different sources, in transforming POC into a new fermented product. The strategy of sequential inoculum of Saccharomyces cerevisiae and Leuconostoc mesenteroides was successful in driving the fermentation process. In fermented POC total levels of phenols were slightly reduced when compared with a non-fermented sample nevertheless the content of the antioxidant hydroxytyrosol showed increased results. The total levels of triterpenic acids, carotenoids, and tocochromanols results were almost unchanged among the samples. Sensory notes were significantly improved after fermentation due to the increase of superior alcohols, esters, and acids. The results reported indicate a possible valorisation of this by-product for the preparation of food products enriched in valuable healthy compounds.",Extruded Unripe Plantain Flour as an Indigestible Carbohydrate-Rich Ingredient.,https://www.ncbi.nlm.nih.gov/pubmed/30805343,Frontiers in nutrition,2019 02 27,"There is a growing interest in the development of functional ingredients, including those with high indigestible carbohydrate content. Unripe plantain flour (UPF) is a source of indigestible carbohydrates, type II resistant starch (RS) in particular. A major drawback of UPF, however, is that its RS content decreases sharply after wet heat treatment. Here, we explore the possibility of preparing an extruded UPF-based functional ingredient that retains limited starch digestibility features and high dietary fiber content. Both an unripe plantain pulp flour (UPFP) and a whole (pulp and peel) unripe plantain flour (UPFW) were prepared, extruded under identical conditions and evaluated for their gelatinization degree, total starch (TS), resistant starch (RS), and total dietary fiber (TDF) content; functional properties, such as pasting profile, water retention capacity, and solubility, and oil absorption index were also analyzed. The extruded functional ingredient was added to a yogurt and the rheological characteristics and in vitro starch digestibility of the product were evaluated. The extruded UPFW showed a lower gelatinization degree than the extruded UPFP, which may be due to the higher non-starch polysaccharide content of the former. A high TDF content was recorded in both extrudates (12.4% in UPFP and 18.5% in UPFW), including a significant RS fraction. The water retention capacity and solubility indices were higher in the extruded flours, particularly in UPFW, while only marginal differences in oil retention capacity were observed among the products. The addition of UPFP or UPFW (1.5 g TDF, w/v) to a yogurt did not alter the viscosity of the product, an important characteristic for the consumer's approval. Moreover, the composite yogurt showed a relatively low starch digestion rate. Extrusion of UPFs may be an alternative for the production of functional ingredients with important DF contents.","Effect of Molasses and Dried Orange Pulp as Sheep Dietary Supplementation on Physico-Chemical, Microbiological and Fatty Acid Profile of Comisana Ewe's Milk and Cheese.",https://www.ncbi.nlm.nih.gov/pubmed/30805342,Frontiers in nutrition,2019 02 27,"The use of agro-industrial by-products for ruminant feed represents both an economical and environmental convenient way for reducing waste discharge and waste management costs for food industries. Large amounts of waste from citrus processing industries are available in Sicily, Italy. In the present study, the effect of dried citrus pulp as sheep dietary supplementation was evaluated on physico-chemical, microbiological and fatty acid composition of resulting milk and cheese. Pelleted feed integrated with molasses and blond orange pulp, replacing cane molasses, beet pulp and part of the maize and sunflower in ration, were administrated to ewes as an experimental treatment The experiment involved sixty Comisana breed sheep divided into two groups and two feeding trials (experimental and control). Ewe's milk and cheese samples were collected from January to April and analyzed for physico-chemical, microbiological and fatty acid profile composition. Results suggested that both the experimental milk and cheese were different from the controls. In particular, an increase of experimental milk yield and fat content were registered whilst the cheese samples exhibited a significant decrease of pH values and an increase in fat and protein contents. In addition, an increase of conjugated linoleic acids as well as of the oxidative stability were observed indicating the beneficial effect of dietary supplementation. Furthermore, among the main microbial groups, the experimental and control samples, no differences were detected. However, with the exception of streptococci, which was found higher in experimental cheeses, and staphylococci, which was significantly reduced by experimental feed. Moreover, the application of culture-independent methods highlighted the dominance of Lactobacillus rhamnosus/casei group in the experimental cheese, suggesting a driving role of the dietary supplementation in the cheese microbiota composition. The present study demonstrated that the inclusion of citrus by-products in the diet of small dairy ruminants is a promising feeding, which could positively affect milk composition and cheese manufacture.",Heparins Sourced From Bovine and Porcine Mucosa Gain Exclusive Monographs in the Brazilian Pharmacopeia.,https://www.ncbi.nlm.nih.gov/pubmed/30805341,Frontiers in medicine,2019 02 27,"Most of the unfractionated heparin (UFH) consumed worldwide is manufactured using porcine mucosa as raw material (HPI); however, some countries also employ products sourced from bovine mucosa (HBI) as interchangeable versions of the gold standard HPI. Although accounted as a single UFH, HBI, and HPI have differing anticoagulant activities (~100 and 200 IU mg-1, respectively) because of their compositional dissimilarities. The concomitant use of HBI and HPI in Brazil had already provoked serious bleeding incidents, which led to the withdrawal of HBI products in 2009. In 2010, the Brazilian Pharmacopeia (BP) formed a special committee to develop two complementary monographs approaching HBI and HPI separately, as distinct active pharmaceutical ingredients (APIs). The committee has rapidly agreed on requirements concerning the composition and presence of contaminants based on nuclear magnetic resonance and anion-exchange chromatography. On the other hand, consensus on the anticoagulant activity of HBI was the subject of long and intense discussions. Nevertheless, the committee has ultimately agreed to recommend minimum anti-FIIa activities of 100 IU mg-1 for HBI and 180 IU mg-1 for HPI. Upon the approval by the Brazilian Health Authority (ANVISA), the BP published the new monographs for HPI and HBI APIs in 2016 and 2017, respectively. These pioneer monographs represent a pivotal step toward the safest use of HBI and HPI as interchangeable anticoagulants and serve as a valuable template for the reformulation of pharmacopeias of other countries willing to introduce HBI.",Psoriatic Synovitis: Singularity and Potential Clinical Implications.,https://www.ncbi.nlm.nih.gov/pubmed/30805340,Frontiers in medicine,2019 02 27,"Psoriatic arthritis (PsA) is an immuno-inflammatory disease with a heterogeneous clinical presentation as affects musculoskeletal tissues (arthritis, enthesitis, spondylitis), skin (psoriasis) and, less frequently, eye (uveitis) and bowel (inflammatory bowel disease). It has been suggested that distinct affected tissues could exhibit different immune-inflammatory pathways so complicating the understanding of the physiopathology of psoriatic disease as well as its treatment. Despite of the key pathogenic and clinical relevance that enthesitis has in PsA, peripheral arthritis is more easily perceived. At the macroscopic level, PsA synovitis has predominantly tortuous, bushy vessels, whereas rheumatoid arthritis (RA) is characterized by mainly straight, branching vessels so reflecting prominent neo-angiogenesis in PsA. Synovial biopsies have demonstrated a similar cellular and molecular picture in PsA and RA, although some differences have been reported at the group level, as higher density of vessels, CD163+ macrophages, neutrophils and mast cells in PsA. In fact, synovial IL-17+ mast cells are significantly increased in PsA and produce more IL-17A compared with RA, and a proof of concept study supports its relevant role in the synovitis of SpA, included PsA. As firstly reported in RA, synovial lymphoid neogenesis is found also in the same proportion of PsA as in RA patients, despite the lack of autoantibodies in PsA. These lymphoid structures are associated with activation of the IL-23/Th17 pathway in RA and seemly in PsA, which could be useful to stratify RA patients. Immunohistochemical and transcriptomic methodologies have still not found synovial biomarkers useful to distinguish psoriatic from rheumatoid synovitis at the patient level. However, modern methodologies, as MALDI-Mass Spectrometry Imaging, applied to the study of synovial tissue have revealed metabolic and lipid signatures which could support clinical decision-making in the diagnosis of PsA and RA and to go further toward the personalized medicine."

The change in local demography and the lack of sensitive and specific TB diagnostic and monitoring tools, especially for cases of childhood TB, leads to either missed cases or over-treatment of this group. Here we present a promising new diagnostic approach, the T cell activation marker (TAM)-TB assay, and its performance in a case of extra-pulmonary TB occurring in a 16 year old refugee from Afghanistan. This assay is based on the characterization of 3 activation markers (CD38, HLA-DR, and Ki67) and one maturation marker (CD27) on M. tuberculosis-specific CD4 T cells. It was performed at time-points T0 (10 days), T1 (1 month), T2 (6 months), and T3 (12 months) post-treatment initiation. All markers were able to detect active tuberculosis (aTB) within this patient at T0 and reverted to a healthy/LTBI phenotype at the end of treatment. Tantalizingly, there was a clear trend toward the healthy/LTBI phenotype for the markers at T1 and T2, indicating a potential role in monitoring anti-TB treatment in the future. This assay may therefore contribute to improved TB diagnostic algorithms and TB treatment monitoring, potentially allowing for individualization of TB treatment duration in the future.",3D-Printed Models for Surgical Planning in Complex Congenital Heart Diseases: A Systematic Review.,https://www.ncbi.nlm.nih.gov/pubmed/30805324,Frontiers in pediatrics,2019 02 27,"Background: 3D technology support is an emerging technology in the field of congenital heart diseases (CHD). The goals of 3D printings or models is mainly a better analysis of complex anatomies to optimize the surgical repair or intervention planning. Method: We performed a systematic review to evaluate the accuracy and reliability of CHD modelization and 3D printing, as well as the proof of concept of the benefit of 3D printing in planning interventions. Results: Correlation studies showed good results with anatomical measurements. This technique can therefore be considered reliable with the limit of the operator's subjectivity in modelizing the defect. In cases series, the benefits of the 3D technology have been shown for describing the vessels anatomy and guiding the surgical approach. For intra-cardiac complex anatomy, 3D models have been shown helpful for the planification of intracardiac repair. However, there is still lack of evidence based approach for the usefulness of 3D models in CHD in changing outcomes after surgery or interventional procedures due to the difficulty to design a prospective study with comprehensive and clinically meaningful end-points. Conclusion: 3D technology can be used to improve the understanding of anatomy of complex CHD and to guide surgical strategy.

The causes of KD remain a mystery. It is suspected that some sort of infectious agent is involved because KD has epidemicity and seasonality. That said, the incidence of the disease is high among Japanese people, so it can be speculated that the hosts may have some sort of genetic characteristic that leaves them susceptible to KD. Various theories regarding the etiology have been asserted, such as the infectious vasculitis theory, autoantigen theory, superantigen theory, and RNA virus theory; however, none of them have been able to overcome this epidemicity. Taking into consideration the knowledge gained from previous reports, the best scenario explaining the pathogenesis is ""individuals with certain genetic backgrounds are affected by microorganisms which trigger KD."" In this article, the pathogenesis of KD is discussed with a focus on the microorganisms mentioned above, along with the previous and current hypotheses as well as my own opinion.",Minimal Associations Between Clinical Data and Children's Self-Reported Health-Related Quality of Life in Children With Chronic Conditions-A Cross-Sectional Study.,https://www.ncbi.nlm.nih.gov/pubmed/30805321,Frontiers in pediatrics,2019 02 27,"Introduction: The improvement-or at least maintenance-of health-related quality of life (HRQoL) in children and adolescents is one of the main aims of chronic disease care. This study examines HRQoL of children and adolescents with three different chronic conditions (i.e., diabetes mellitus, asthma, juvenile arthritis) using the computer-adaptive test Kids-CAT, comprising five HRQoL domains: physical well-being, psychological well-being, parent relations, social support and peers, and school well-being. Further, associations between HRQoL and distinct clinical data and medical assessments are investigated to explore how much variability of the five domains can be explained by these variables. Methods: Cross-sectional data of the Kids-CAT study was analyzed. The Kids-CAT was used in two outpatient clinics in northern Germany gathering data on self-reported HRQoL in n = 309 children and adolescents aged 7-17 years. Additionally, general patient information, clinical data, and pediatrician-reported medical assessments were measured. Multiple regression analyses were conducted to explore associations between HRQoL and selected variables (i.e., disease duration, co-morbidity, disease control, overall health status). Results: Overall, self-reported HRQoL in all five domains were comparable to data of an age- and sex-matched reference population. Results of regression analyses indicated that the investigated variables only minimally explain variance in the five Kids-CAT domains. Sociodemographic, clinical data, and medical assessments explained 18.4% of the variance in physical well-being, 10.7% in psychological well-being, and < 10% of the variance in parent relations, social support and peers, and school well-being. Conclusion: Sociodemographic data, disease duration, co-morbidity, and medical assessments, such as disease control or pediatrician-assessed overall health status show low association with HRQoL of children and adolescents with chronic conditions. Data on self-reported HRQoL delivers valuable information on children's well-being and can improve healthcare professionals' understanding of the subjective well-being of their young patients. The implementation of tools like the Kids-CAT can facilitate the identification of potential problem areas, which should enable healthcare professionals to better address specific healthcare needs.

It is considered rare and geographically limited to Japan and East Asia. However, CAEBV is drawing international attention, and the number of case reported worldwide is increasing, after its classification in the EBV-positive T- or NK-cell neoplasms, in the 2016 WHO classification. In this article, I review current advances in the study of CAEBV under the new definition and show future directions. In CAEBV, EBV-infected T or NK cells clonally proliferate and infiltrate multiple organs, leading to their failure. These characteristics define CAEBV as a lymphoid neoplasm. However, the main symptom of CAEBV is inflammation. Recently, the mechanisms underlying the development of CAEBV have gradually become clearer. EBV infection of T or NK cells can occur during the acute phase of primary infection with a high EBV load in the peripheral blood. In addition, it was reported that cytotoxic T cells decreased in numbers or showed dysfunction in CAEBV. These findings suggest that undetermined immunosuppressive disorders may underlie persistent infection of T or NK cells. Furthermore, EBV itself contributes to the survival of host cells. In vitro EBV infection of T cells induced intercellular survival-promoting pathways. Constitutive activation of NF-kB and STAT3 was observed in EBV-positive T or NK cells in CAEBV, promoting not only cell survival but also CAEBV development. During the disease course, CAEBV can lead to two lethal conditions: hemophagocytic lymphohistiocytosis and chemotherapy-resistant lymphoma. It is necessary to start treatment before these conditions develop. At present, the only effective treatment strategy for eradicating EBV-infected T or NK cells is allogeneic stem cell transplantation (allo-HSCT). However, patients with an active disease, in which the condition is accompanied by fever, liver dysfunction, progressive skin lesions, vasculitis, or uveitis, had worse outcomes after allo-HSCT, than patients with an inactive disease had. Unfortunately, current chemotherapies are insufficient to improve the activity of CAEBV. Based on the molecular mechanisms for the development of the disease, the NF-kB, or JAK/STAT mediating pathways are attractive candidate targets for new treatments.",Genomic Predictors of Asthma Phenotypes and Treatment Response.,https://www.ncbi.nlm.nih.gov/pubmed/30805318,Frontiers in pediatrics,2019 02 27,"Asthma is a complex respiratory disease considered as the most common chronic condition in children. A large genetic contribution to asthma susceptibility is predicted by the clustering of asthma and allergy symptoms among relatives and the large disease heritability estimated from twin studies, ranging from 55 to 90%. Genetic basis of asthma has been extensively investigated in the past 40 years using linkage analysis and candidate-gene association studies. However, the development of dense arrays for polymorphism genotyping has enabled the transition toward genome-wide association studies (GWAS), which have led the discovery of several unanticipated asthma genes in the last 11 years. Despite this, currently known risk variants identified using many thousand samples from distinct ethnicities only explain a small proportion of asthma heritability. This review examines the main findings of the last 2 years in genomic studies of asthma using GWAS and admixture mapping studies, as well as the direction of studies fostering integrative perspectives involving omics data. Additionally, we discuss the need for assessing the whole spectrum of genetic variation in association studies of asthma susceptibility, severity, and treatment response in order to further improve our knowledge of asthma genes and predictive biomarkers. Leveraging the individual's genetic information will allow a better understanding of asthma pathogenesis and will facilitate the transition toward a more precise diagnosis and treatment.",Anterior Urethral Strictures in Children: Disease Etiology and Comparative Effectiveness of Endoscopic Treatment vs. Open Surgical Reconstruction.,https://www.ncbi.nlm.nih.gov/pubmed/30805317,Frontiers in pediatrics,2019 02 27,"Pediatric anterior urethral strictures are rare and recommendations regarding treatment strategies derive from small monocentric case series. In 2014, a collaborative effort of the Société Internationale d'Urologie and the International Consultation on Urological Diseases drafted the first systematic and evidence-based guideline for diagnosis and treatment of urethral strictures in children. Against this backdrop, we performed an updated literature review to provide a comprehensive summary of the available evidence and contemporary outcomes with a focus on comparative effectiveness of endoscopic treatment (dilation or urethrotomy) vs. open surgical reconstruction. Overall, 22 articles reporting on children with anterior urethral strictures were included into the review. Most strictures were iatrogenic (48%) and traumatic (34%), whereas congenital (13%), inflammatory (4%), or postinfectious strictures (1%) were rather rare. The cumulative success rate of endoscopic treatment and urethroplasty was 46% (range: 21-75; N = 334) and 84% (range: 25-100; N = 347), respectively. After stratifying patients according to urethroplasty technique, success rates were 82% (range: 25-100; N = 206) for excision and primary anastomosis, 94% (range: 75-100; N = 40) for graft augmentation, 97% (range: 87-100; N = 30) for flap urethroplasty, and 70% (one study; N = 20) for pull-through urethroplasty. In conclusion, endoscopic approaches are rather ineffective in the long-term and open surgical reconstruction via urethroplasty should be preferred to avoid multiple, repetitive interventions. Future research may involve multi-institutional, collaborative, and prospective studies, incorporating well-defined outcome criteria and assessing objective surgical endpoints as well as patient-reported functional outcomes.",Quality of Life in Late-Treated Patients With Disorders of Sex Development: Insights for Patient-Centered Care.,https://www.ncbi.nlm.nih.gov/pubmed/30805316,Frontiers in pediatrics,2019 02 27,"Background: Patients with a disorder of sex development (DSD) are born with atypical genitals or may develop atypical genitals and atypical body appearance, if left untreated.

Method: Comparison of 118 patients born with DSD, aged 6-41 years (60 children, 24 adolescents, and 34 adults) and 118 healthy control subjects matched for gender, age, and residential setting. HRQoL was measured using a translation of the TACQOL/TAAQOL. Results: According to parental and children's report, children with DSD reported more problems in social functioning and had less positive moods. Girls, in particular, reported problems in cognitive functioning. Adult patients reported more depressive moods, especially women, who reported more anger. No differences were found between in the adolescent groups. Conclusion: The data suggest that Indonesian children with DSD experienced more problems in social contact than non-affected Indonesian children, whereas Indonesian adults with DSD suffered from negative emotions more often than non-affected Indonesians. These findings on HRQoL are in line with findings on emotional functioning."

Recently, we have shown that interleukin 13 receptor alpha 2 (IL13Rα2) is a critical gene that is overexpressed in a subset of BLBC primary tumors associated with poor distant metastasis-free survival (DMFS) and can promote extravasation and metastasis of breast cancer cells to the lungs. However, the upstream signaling mechanisms that promote aberrant IL13Rα2 expression during tumor progression remain unknown. Driven by our previously published gene expression microarray data derived from a well-characterized cell line model for BLBC progression, we show that both Inhibin βA (INHBA) and IL13Rα2 genes exhibit similarly higher expression levels in metastatic compared to non-metastatic cells and that overexpression of both genes predicts worse metastasis-free survival of patients with high grade tumors. Activin A, a member of the TGFβ superfamily comprising two INHBA subunits, has been shown to play context-depended roles in cancer progression. Here, we demonstrate that INHBA depletion downregulates IL13Rα2 expression in metastatic breast cancer cells, whereas treatment with Activin A in non-metastatic cells increases its expression levels. We also find that Activin A predominantly induces Smad2 phosphorylation and to a lesser extent activates Smad3 and Akt. Interestingly, we also show that Activin A-mediated upregulation of IL13Rα2 is Smad2-dependent since knocking down Smad2 or using the ALK4/ALK5 inhibitors EW-7197 and SB-505124 abolishes this effect. Most importantly, our data indicate that knocking down INHBA levels in breast cancer cells delays primary tumor growth, suppresses migration in vitro and inhibits the formation of lung metastases in vivo. Conclusively, our findings presented here suggest that the development of therapeutic interventions employing small molecule inhibitors against Activin receptors or neutralizing antibodies targeting Activin A ligand, could serve as alternative approaches against breast tumors overexpressing INHBA and/or IL13Rα2.",Prognostic and Risk Stratification Value of Lesion MACC1 Expression in Colorectal Cancer Patients.,https://www.ncbi.nlm.nih.gov/pubmed/30805302,Frontiers in oncology,2019 02 27,"The up-regulated metastasis-associated in colon cancer 1 (MACC1) expression and its clinical significance has been explored in a varity of malignancies.

Data revealed the survival of patient with MACC1high is markedly worse than that of MACC1low (mean overall survival: 80.1 vs. 90.4 months; p = 0.001) and is an independent prognostic predictor (hazard ratio = 1.533; p = 0.005). More importantly, for the first time, we demonstrated that MACC1 status exhibited a significantly prognostic power for stratified clinical parameters such as patient age and gender, particular TNM status, and distinct AJCC disease stage.

Two human breast cancer cell lines, MCF7 [ER(+)] and MDA-MB-468 (triple-negative), were used as model systems. To directly address the issue of metabolic heterogeneity in cancer, we purified a new distinct sub-population of CSCs, based solely on their energetic profile. We propose the term ""energetic"" cancer stem cells (e-CSCs), to better describe this novel cellular phenotype. In a single step, we first isolated an auto-fluorescent cell sub-population, based on their high flavin-content, using flow-cytometry. Then, these cells were further subjected to a detailed phenotypic characterization. More specifically, e-CSCs were more glycolytic, with higher mitochondrial mass and showed significantly elevated oxidative metabolism. e-CSCs also demonstrated an increased capacity to undergo cell cycle progression, as well as enhanced anchorage-independent growth and ALDH-positivity. Most importantly, these e-CSCs could be effectively targeted by treatments with either (i) OXPHOS inhibitors (DPI) or (ii) a CDK4/6 inhibitor (Ribociclib). Finally, we were able to distinguish two distinct phenotypic sub-types of e-CSCs, depending on whether they were grown as 2D-monolayers or as 3D-spheroids. Remarkably, under 3D anchorage-independent growth conditions, e-CSCs were strictly dependent on oxidative mitochondrial metabolism. Unbiased proteomics analysis demonstrated the up-regulation of gene products specifically related to the anti-oxidant response, mitochondrial energy production, and mitochondrial biogenesis. Therefore, mitochondrial inhibitors should be further developed as promising anti-cancer agents, to directly target and eliminate the ""fittest"" e-CSCs. Our results have important implications for using e-CSCs, especially those derived from 3D-spheroids, (i) in tumor tissue bio-banking and (ii) as a new cellular platform for drug development.",Monitoring microbial communities' dynamics during the start-up of microbial fuel cells by high-throughput screening techniques.,https://www.ncbi.nlm.nih.gov/pubmed/30805299,"Biotechnology reports (Amsterdam, Netherlands)",2019 02 27,"Microbial Electrochemical Technologies are based on the use of electrochemically active microorganisms that can carry out extracellular electron transfer to an electrode while they are oxidizing the organic compounds. The dynamics and changes of the bacterial community in the anode biofilm and planktonic broth of an acetate fed batch single chamber air cathode MFC have been studied by combing flow-cytometry and Illumina sequencing techniques. At the beginning of the test, from 0 h to 70 h, microbial planktonic communities changed from four groups to two groups, as revealed by DNA content, and from three groups to one group based on the cell membrane polarization revealed by a DiOC6(3) probe. Between 4th day and 13th day, microbial communities changed from one group to a maximum of three groups, monitoring DNA content, and from one group to two based on the cell membrane polarization. The 16S rDNA gene profiling confirmed the shift in microbial communities, with Acinetobacter (39.34%), Azospirillum (27.66%), Arcobacter (4.17%) and Comamonas (2.62%) being the most abundant genera at the beginning of MFC activation. After 70 h the main genera detected were Azospirillum (46.42%), Acinetobacter (34.66%), Enterococcus (2.32%), Dysgonomonas (2.14%). Data obtained have shown that flow cytometry and illumina sequencing are useful tools to monitor ""online"" the changes in microbial communities during the MFCs start-up and the increase of Azospirillum and Acinetobacter genera is in good agreement with the MFC voltage generation. Moreover, monitoring planktonic populations, instead of the less accessible anode biofilm, was in good agreement with the evolution of MFC voltage.","Chemical and microbial quality of bottled drinking water in Gonabad city, Iran: Effect of time and storage conditions on microbial quality of bottled waters.",https://www.ncbi.nlm.nih.gov/pubmed/30805298,MethodsX,2019 02 27,"Reports from bottled water (BW) industries show a rapidly increasing rate of global bottled water consumption.

A major challenge lies in monitoring the blood supply to the new tissue following transplantation: the integration and neovascularization of scaffolds in vivo is critical to their functionality. Photoacoustic imaging (PAI) is a laser-generated ultrasound-based technique that is particularly well suited to visualising microvasculature due to the high optical absorption of haemoglobin. Here, we describe an early proof-of-concept study in which PAI in widefield tomography mode is used to image biological, decellularized human tracheal scaffolds. We found that PAI allowed the longitudinal tracking of scaffold integration into subcutaneous murine tissue with high spatial resolution at depth over an extended period of time. The results of the study were consistent with post-imaging histological analyses, demonstrating that PAI can be used to non-invasively monitor the extent of vascularization in biological tissue-engineered scaffolds. We propose that this technique may be a valuable tool for studies designed to test interventions aimed at improving the speed and extent of scaffold neovascularization in tissue engineering.

Given the abundance of high-quality information, ISASS can confidently advocate that there is strong support for vertebral augmentation in the treatment of symptomatic vertebral compression fractures.","Trajectories of body mass index among active-duty U.S. Army soldiers, 2011-2014.",https://www.ncbi.nlm.nih.gov/pubmed/30805278,Preventive medicine reports,2019 06 10,"Establishing the shape and determinants of trajectories of body mass index (BMI) among Soldiers is critical given the importance of weight management to military service requirements. To establish the shape and determinants of BMI trajectories among Soldiers, we aimed to (1) model the overall BMI trajectory of Soldiers, (2) find the most common trajectory groups among Soldiers, (3) investigate the relationship between BMI trajectories and sociodemographic and military-specific characteristics, and (4) determine if there were Soldiers with large fluctuations in BMI. The study population included all US Army Soldiers on active-duty between 2011 and 2014 who were age 17-62 (n = 827,126). With longitudinal data from the Stanford Military Data Repository, we used group-based trajectory modeling to identify the BMI trajectories of Soldiers and multinomial logistic regression to estimate associations between Soldier characteristics and trajectory membership. Four distinct BMI trajectory groups were found: increasing, decreasing, constant, and inconstant. The constant, increasing, and decreasing trajectories were similar in shape and percentage between men and women. The constant trajectory had the fewest Soldiers who exceeded weight standards or had duty limitations. The increasing trajectory was associated with marriage and fewer service years. The decreasing trajectory was associated with more service years and higher educational attainment. The inconstant trajectory differed in shape between men and women. Over 6% of men and 12% of women had fluctuations in BMI indicative of weight cycling. Understanding the characteristics associated with BMI trends may assist the Army in targeting resources aimed to improve Soldier health and combat readiness.",Health advice and education given to overweight patients by primary care doctors and nurses: A scoping literature review.,https://www.ncbi.nlm.nih.gov/pubmed/30805277,Preventive medicine reports,2019 06 10,"Health advice for overweight patients in primary care has been a focus of obesity guidelines. Primary care doctors and nurses are well placed to provide evidence based preventive health advice. This literature review addressed two research questions: 'When do primary care doctors and nurses provide health advice for weight management?' and 'What health advice is provided to overweight patients in primary care settings?' The study was conducted in the first half of 2018 and followed Arksey and O'Malley (2005) five stage framework to conduct a comprehensive scoping review. The following databases were searched: Emcare, Ovid, Embase, The Cochrane library, Proquest family health, Health source (nursing academic), Joanna Briggs Institute EBP database, Medline, PubMed, Rural and remote, Proquest (nursing and allied health) and TRIP using search term parameters. Two hundred and forty-eight (248) articles were located and screened by two reviewers. Twenty-three research papers met the criteria and data were analysed using a content analysis method. The results show that primary care doctors and nurses are more likely to give advice as BMI increases and often miss opportunities to discuss weight with overweight patients. Body Mass Index (BMI) is often wrongly categorised as overweight, when in fact it is in the range of obese, or not recorded and when health advice is given, it can be of poor quality. Few studies on this topic included people under 40 years, practice nurses as the focus and those with a BMI of 25-29.9 without a risk factor. A 'toolkit' approach to improve advice and adherence to evidence based guidelines should be explored in future research.",Measurement of the Spatial Distribution of S1P in Small Quantities of Tissues: Development and Application of a Highly Sensitive LC-MS/MS Method Combined with Laser Microdissection.,https://www.ncbi.nlm.nih.gov/pubmed/30805275,"Mass spectrometry (Tokyo, Japan)",2019 02 27,"Sphingosine-1-phosphate (S1P) acts as an extracellular signaling molecule with diverse biological functions. Tissues appear to have an S1P gradient, which is functionally relevant in the biological significance of S1P, although its existence has not been measured directly. Here, we report a highly sensitive method to determine the distribution of S1P, using a column-switching LC-MS/MS system combined with laser microdissection (LMD). Column switching using narrow core Capcell Pak C18 analytical and trap columns with 0.3 mm inner diameter improved the performance of the LC-MS/MS system. The calibration curve of S1P showed good linearity (r>0.999) over the range of 0.05-10 nM (1-200 fmol/injection). The accuracy of the method was confirmed by measuring S1P-spiked laser microdissected mice tissue sections. To evaluate our S1P analytical method, we quantified S1P extracted from micro-dissected mouse brain and spleen. These results show that this method can measure low S1P concentrations and determine S1P distribution in tissue microenvironments.",Mat thickness associated with Didymosphenia geminata and Cymbella spp. in the southern rivers of Chile.,https://www.ncbi.nlm.nih.gov/pubmed/30805252,PeerJ,2019 02 27,"Didymosphenia geminata is a diatom that can alter aquatic systems. Several investigations have shown as chemical, and hydraulic factors have a great influence on the proliferation of D. geminata, but the study of other microalgae that could be associated with it has been poorly addressed. The objective of this study is to evaluate the relationship between mat thickness, D. geminata and another taxon that produces mucilage, Cymbella, while also considering physical and chemical factors. For this, two samples were taken, one in the spring of 2013 and the other in the autumn of 2014, from eight rivers in central-southern Chile-South America, where the benthic community was characterized, and the thickness of the mat was measured. The results show that the mat thickness on sites with the presence of both taxa is doubled, and while sites with D. geminata presence showed mat peak on autumn, sites with Cymbella spp. presence showed on spring. Also, higher values of mat thickness associated with low cell densities of D. geminata and intermediate cell densities of Cymbella spp. Finally, physicochemical variables that better explain mat thickness are phosphorus and water temperature. An alternation process of mucilage production may explain these results by these taxa strongly related to physicochemical variables. The present study contributes evidence about the relationship between mat thickness D. geminata and other microalgae contribution, and aquatic condition for this development.",Tricin levels and expression of flavonoid biosynthetic genes in developing grains of purple and brown pericarp rice.,https://www.ncbi.nlm.nih.gov/pubmed/30805251,PeerJ,2019 04 27,"The methylated flavone tricin has been associated with numerous health benefits, including reductions in intestinal and colon cancers in animal models. Tricin is found in a wide range of plant species and in many different tissues. However, whole cereal grains, such as rice, barley, oats, and wheat, are the only food sources of tricin, which is located in the bran portion of the grain. Variation in tricin levels was found in bran from rice genotypes with light brown, brown, red, and purple pericarp color, with the purple pericarp genotypes having the highest levels of tricin. Here, we analyzed tricin and tricin derivative levels in developing pericarp and embryo samples of a purple pericarp genotype, IAC600, that had high tricin and tricin derivative levels in the bran, and a light brown pericarp genotype, Cocodrie, that had no detectable tricin or tricin derivatives in the bran. Tricin and tricin derivatives were detected in both the pericarp and embryo of IAC600 but only in the embryo of Cocodrie. The purple pericarp rice had higher total levels of free tricin plus tricin derivatives than the light brown pericarp rice. When expressed on a per grain basis, most of the tricin component of IAC600 was in the pericarp. In contrast, Cocodrie had no detectable tricin in the pericarp samples but did have detectable chrysoeriol, a precursor of tricin, in the pericarp samples. We also used RNA-Seq analysis of developing pericarp and embryo samples of the two cultivars to compare the expression of genes involved in the flavonoid biosynthetic pathway. The results presented here suggest that understanding the basis of tricin accumulation in rice pericarp may lead to an approach to increasing tricin levels in whole grain rice. From analysis of gene expression levels in the pericarp samples it appears that regulation of the flavone specific genes is independent of regulation of the anthocyanin biosynthetic genes. It therefore may be feasible to develop brown pericarp rice cultivars that accumulate tricin in the pericarp.",Potential antidiabetic effect of ethanolic and aqueous-ethanolic extracts of Ricinus communis leaves on streptozotocin-induced diabetes in rats.,https://www.ncbi.nlm.nih.gov/pubmed/30805250,PeerJ,2019 02 27,"Recently, herbal drugs and their bioactive compounds have gained popularity in the management of diabetes mellitus (DM), which has become an epidemic disease all over the world and is especially prevalent in the Kingdom of Saudi Arabia (KSA). This study aimed to investigate the antidiabetic effect of ethanolic and aqueous-ethanolic extracts of wild Ricinus communis (R. communis) leaves in streptozotocin (STZ) induced diabetic rats. Diabetic rats were administered orally with the mentioned extracts at doses of 300 and 600 mg/kg/BW for 14 days, and the obtained results of different biochemical parameters were compared with normal control, diabetic control and standard drug glibenclamide (5 mg/kg/BW). The obtained results revealed a remarkable and significantly (P < 0.05) reverse effect of the body weight loss, observed when diabetic rats were treated with ethanol and aqueous-ethanol extracts at 300 mg/kg/BW. Administration of the ethanol extract at 600 mg/kg/BW significantly (P < 0.05) reduced the blood glucose level. A significant increase in the AST, ALT and ALP levels (P < 0.05) was observed in the diabetic control and in the experimental groups with glibenclamide which was also significantly (P < 0.05) lowered after treatment with extracts at special doses. Total proteins, albumin, total bilirubin, direct bilirubin, creatinine and urea were also investigated and compared to the corresponding controls. We showed that administration of R. communis extract generally significantly (P < 0.05) ameliorated the biochemical parameters of diabetic rats. Also, the changes in serum electrolyte profile were assessed and the results demonstrate that administration of extracts at concentration of 600 mg/kg/BW generally inhibits the alteration maintain their levels. The obtained data imply the hypoglycemic effects of this plant, which may be used as a good alternative for managing DM and therefore validating its traditional usage in KSA.",Stress responses upon starvation and exposure to bacteria in the ant Formica exsecta.,https://www.ncbi.nlm.nih.gov/pubmed/30805249,PeerJ,2019 02 27,"Organisms are simultaneously exposed to multiple stresses, which requires regulation of the resistance to each stress. Starvation is one of the most severe stresses organisms encounter, yet nutritional state is also one of the most crucial conditions on which other stress resistances depend. Concomitantly, organisms often deploy lower immune defenses when deprived of resources. This indicates that the investment into starvation resistance and immune defenses is likely to be subject to trade-offs. Here, we investigated the impact of starvation and oral exposure to bacteria on survival and gene expression in the ant Formica exsecta. Of the three bacteria used in this study, only Serratia marcescens increased the mortality of the ants, whereas exposure to Escherichia coli and Pseudomonas entomophila alleviated the effects of starvation. Both exposure to bacteria and starvation induced changes in gene expression, but in different directions depending on the species of bacteria used, as well as on the nutritional state of the ants.",Mycorrhization of Quercus acutissima with Chinese black truffle significantly altered the host physiology and root-associated microbiomes.,https://www.ncbi.nlm.nih.gov/pubmed/30805248,PeerJ,2019 02 27,"Our aim was to explore how the ectomycorrhizae of an indigenous tree, Quercus acutissima, with a commercial truffle, Chinese black truffle (Tuber indicum), affects the host plant physiology and shapes the associated microbial communities in the surrounding environment during the early stage of symbiosis."

Lessons from India and South Africa.",https://www.ncbi.nlm.nih.gov/pubmed/30805207,BMJ global health,2019 02 27,"Tuberculosis (TB) remains an enormous public health concern globally. India and South Africa rank among the top 10 high TB burden countries with the highest absolute burden of TB, and the second highest rate of TB incidence, respectively. Although the primary drivers of TB transmission vary considerably between these two countries, they do indeed share common themes. In 2017, only 64% of the global estimated incident cases of TB were reported, the remaining 36% of 'missing' cases were either undiagnosed, untreated or unreported. These 'missing TB cases' have generated much hype for the challenges they present in achieving the End TB Strategy. Although India and South Africa have indeed made significant strides in TB control, analysis of the patient cascade of care clearly suggests that these 'missed' patients are not really missing-most are actively engaging the health system-the system, however, is failing to appropriately manage them. In short, quality of TB care is suboptimal and must urgently be addressed, merely focusing on coverage of TB services is no longer sufficient. While the world awaits revolutionary vaccines, drugs and diagnostics, programmatic data indicate that much can be done to accelerate the decline of TB. In this perspective, we compare and contrast these two national epidemics, and explore barriers, with a particular focus on the role of health systems in finding the missing millions.","Health systems changes after decentralisation: progress, challenges and dynamics in Pakistan.",https://www.ncbi.nlm.nih.gov/pubmed/30805206,BMJ global health,2019 02 27,"Decentralisation is widely practised but its scrutiny tends to focus on structural and authority changes or outcomes. Politics and process of devolution implementation needs to be better understood to evaluate how national governments use the enhanced decision space for bringing improvements in the health system and the underlying challenges faced. We use the example of Pakistan's radical, politically driven provincial devolution to analyse how national structures use decentralisation opportunities for improved health planning, spending and carrying out transformations to the health system. Our narrative draws on secondary data sources from the PRIMASYS study, supplemented with policy roundtable notes from Pakistan. Our analysis shows that in decentralised Pakistan, health became prioritised for increased government resources and achieved good budgetary use, major strides were made contextualised sector-wide health planning and legislations, and a proliferation seen in governance measures to improve and regulate healthcare delivery. Despite a disadvantaged and abrupt start to devolution, high ownership by politicians and bureaucracy in provincial governments led to resourcing, planning and innovations. However, effective translation remained impeded by weak institutional capacity, feeble federal-provincial coordination and vulnerability to interference by local elites. Building on this illustrative example, we propose (1) political management of decentralisation for effective national coordination, sustaining stable leadership and protecting from political interfere by local elites; (2) investment in stewardship capacity in the devolved structures as well as the central ministry to deliver on new roles.",Exploring undergraduate nursing student interactions with virtual patients to develop 'non-technical skills' through case study methodology.,https://www.ncbi.nlm.nih.gov/pubmed/30805205,"Advances in simulation (London, England)",2019 02 27,"Virtual patients are a recent addition to the educational arsenal to develop non-technical skills in undergraduate health professionals.

Diabetic retinopathy and macular degeneration are leading causes of blindness in the developed world. While current therapies for these diseases slow disease progression, stem cell and gene therapy may also reverse the effects of these, and other, degenerative retinal conditions. Novel therapies being investigated include the use of various types of stem cells in the regeneration of atrophic or damaged retinal tissue, the prolonged administration of neurotrophic factors and/or drug delivery, immunomodulation, as well as the replacement of mutant genes, and immunomodulation through viral vector delivery. This review will update the reader on aspects of stem cell and gene therapy in diabetic retinopathy, age-related macular degeneration, retinitis pigmentosa and other less common inherited retinal dystrophies. These therapies include the use of adeno-associated viral vector-based therapies for treatment of various types of retinitis pigmentosa and dry age-related macular degeneration. Other potential therapies reviewed include the use of mesenchymal stem cells in local immunomodulation, and the use of stem cells in generating structures like three-dimensional retinal sheets for transplantation into degenerative retinas. Finally, aspects of stem cell and gene therapy in diabetic retinopathy, age-related macular degeneration, retinitis pigmentosa, and other less common inherited retinal dystrophies will be reviewed.",Patient and Public Engagement in Integrated Knowledge Translation Research: Are we there yet?,https://www.ncbi.nlm.nih.gov/pubmed/30805202,Research involvement and engagement,2019 02 27,"There have been many attempts to improve how healthcare services are developed and delivered. Despite this, we know that there are many gaps and differences in practice and that these can lead to poor patient outcomes. In addition, there are also concerns that research is being undertaken that does not reflects the realities or needs of those using healthcare services, and that the use of research findings in practice is slow. As such, shared approaches to research, such as integrated knowledge translation, are being used.Integrated knowledge translation (IKT) is a research approach that brings together researchers, along with other stakeholders that have knowledge about a particular healthcare issue. Stakeholders may include healthcare providers and policy-makers. More recently, there has been a growing awareness of the need to include patients and members of the public within research processes. These collaborative and patient-oriented research approaches are seen as a way to develop research that tackles ongoing gaps in practice and reflect the insights, needs and priorities of those most affected by health research outcomes. Despite great support, little is known about how these major research approaches are connected, or how they may bring about improvements in the development and use of research evidence. In this paper, we examine how IKT and patient engagement processes are linked, as well as exploring where differences exist. Through this, we highlight opportunities for greater patient engagement in IKT research and to identify areas that need to be understood further.","Influence of temperature on development, reproduction and regeneration in the flatworm model organism, Macrostomum lignano.",https://www.ncbi.nlm.nih.gov/pubmed/30805201,Zoological letters,2019 02 27,"The free-living marine flatworm Macrostomum lignano is a powerful model organism for use in studying mechanisms of regeneration and stem cell regulation due to its combination of biological and experimental properties, including the availability of transgenesis methods, which is unique among flatworm models.

Although it is still not clear precisely when and where the outbreak began and symptom-based reports are unlikely to reveal the answer, indirect methods including phylogenetics provide important clues, and we consider whether intense influenza activity as far back as 1915 in the USA may have been caused by viral strains closely related to the 1918 one.","""We don't really know what else we can do"": Parent experiences when adolescent distress persists after the Maudsley and family-based therapies for anorexia nervosa.",https://www.ncbi.nlm.nih.gov/pubmed/30805186,Journal of eating disorders,2019 02 27,"Maudsley Family Therapy (MFT), and its manualised version, Family-Based Therapy (FBT), are the only well-established treatment interventions for adolescent anorexia nervosa (AN), with treatment efficacy primarily measured by improvements in eating behaviours and weight restoration. A crucial component of this therapy is an intensive home-based refeeding intervention that requires a substantial commitment from parents for up to one year. While this treatment works to restore weight in a proportion of adolescents, very little is known about its impacts on family distress, relationships and identity, including in the 40% of families where the adolescent experiences ongoing eating disorder (ED) symptomatology and/or psychological distress during and post-treatment. Specifically, few studies have investigated the impacts of MFT/FBT treatment on family functioning or on how parents negotiate their identities, or who they understand themselves to be, in the context of this treatment intervention. This is a significant omission, given the substantive role assigned to parents to take responsibility for their child's eating restoration in the first treatment phase.

In this study, we measured leaf nutrients along a transect across a groundwater depth gradient in the downstream Heihe River to explore the response of leaf nutrient traits to groundwater depth and soil properties. We found that leaf nutrient traits of dominant species showed different responses to groundwater depth gradient. Leaf C, leaf N, leaf P, and leaf K decreased significantly with groundwater depth, whereas patterns of leaf C/N and leaf N/P followed quadratic relationships with groundwater depth. Meanwhile, leaf C/P did not vary significantly along the groundwater depth gradient. Variations in leaf nutrient traits were associated with soil properties (e.g., soil bulk density, soil pH). Groundwater depth and soil pH jointly regulated the variation of leaf nutrient traits; however, groundwater depth explained the variation of leaf nutrient traits better than did soil pH. At the local scale in the typical desert riparian ecosystem, the dominant species was characterized by low leaf C, leaf N, and leaf P, but high leaf N/P and leaf C/P, indicating that desert riparian plants might be more limited by P than N in the growing season. Our observations will help to reveal specific adaptation patterns in relation to the groundwater depth gradient for dominant desert riparian species, provide insights into adaptive trends of leaf nutrient traits, and add information relevant to understanding the adaptive strategies of desert riparian forest vegetation to moisture gradients.","Plasma mammalian leptin analogue predicts reproductive phenology, but not reproductive output in a capital-income breeding seaduck.",https://www.ncbi.nlm.nih.gov/pubmed/30805178,Ecology and evolution,2019 02 27,"To invest in energetically demanding life history stages, individuals require a substantial amount of resources. Physiological traits, particularly those related to energetics, can be useful for examining variation in life history decisions and trade-offs because they result from individual responses to environmental variation. Leptin is a protein hormone found in mammals that is proportional to the amount of endogenous fat stores within an individual. Recently, researchers have confirmed that a mammalian leptin analogue (MLA), based on the mammalian sequence of leptin, is present with associated receptors and proteins in avian species, with an inhibitory effect on foraging and body mass gain at high circulating levels. While MLA has been both quantified and manipulated in avian species, little is currently known regarding whether plasma MLA in wild-living species and individuals is associated with key reproductive decisions. We quantified plasma MLA in wild, Arctic-nesting female common eiders (Somateria mollissima) at arrival on the breeding grounds and followed them to determine subsequent breeding propensity, and reproductive phenology, investment, and success. Common eiders are capital-income breeding birds that require the accumulation of substantial fat stores to initiate laying and successfully complete incubation. We found that females with lower plasma MLA initiated breeding earlier and in a shorter period of time. However, we found no links between plasma MLA levels and breeding propensity, clutch size, or reproductive success. Although little is still known about plasma MLA, based on these results and its role in influencing foraging behaviors and condition gain, plasma MLA appears to be closely linked to reproductive timing and is therefore likely to underlie trade-offs surrounding life history decisions."

This has been especially insightful for groups for which species hypotheses are ambiguous and have largely been based on morphological differences between certain life stages or sexes, and has added importance when taxa are a focus of conservation efforts. Here, we examine the taxonomic status of Arsapnia arapahoe, a winter stonefly in the family Capniidae that is a species of conservation concern because of its limited abundance and restricted range in northern Colorado, USA. Phylogenetic analyses of sequences of mitochondrial and nuclear genes of this and other capniid stoneflies from this region and elsewhere in western North America indicated extensive haplotype sharing, limited genetic differences, and a lack of reciprocal monophyly between A. arapahoe and the sympatric A. decepta, despite distinctive and consistent morphological differences in the sexual apparatus of males of both species. Analyses of autosomal and sex-linked single nucleotide polymorphisms detected using genotyping by sequencing indicated that all individuals of A. arapahoe consisted of F1 hybrids between female A. decepta and males of another sympatric stonefly, Capnia gracilaria. Rather than constitute a self-sustaining evolutionary lineage, A. arapahoe appears to represent the product of nonintrogressive hybridization in the limited area of syntopy between two widely distributed taxa. This offers a cautionary tale for taxonomists and conservation biologists working on the less-studied components of the global fauna.",Integrating the Rabinowitz rarity framework with a National Plant Inventory in South Korea.,https://www.ncbi.nlm.nih.gov/pubmed/30805165,Ecology and evolution,2019 02 27,"Increasingly large presence-only survey datasets are becoming available for use in conservation assessments. Potentially, these records could be used to determine spatial patterns of plant species rarity and endemism. We test the integration of a large South Korean species record database with Rabinowitz rarity classes. Rabinowitz proposed seven classes of species rarity using three variables: geographic range, habitat specificity, and local population size. We estimated the range size and local abundance of 2,215 plant species from species occurrence records and habitat specificity as the number of landcover types each species' records were found in. We classified each species into a rarity class or as common, compared species composition by class to national lists, and mapped the spatial pattern of species richness for each rarity class. Species were classed to narrow or wide geographic ranges using 315 km, the average from a range size index of all species (Dmax), based on maximum distance between observations. There were four classes each within the narrow and wide range groups, sorted using cutoffs of local abundance and habitat specificity. Nationally listed endangered species only appeared in the narrow-range classes, while nationally listed endemic species appeared in almost all classes. Species richness in most rarity classes was high in northeastern South Korea especially for species with narrow ranges. Policy implications. Large presence-only surveys may be able to estimate some classes of rarity better than others, but modification to include estimates of local abundance and habitat types, could greatly increase their utility. Application of the Rabinowitz rarity framework to such surveys can extend their utility beyond species distribution models and can identify areas that need further surveys and for conservation priority. Future studies should be aware of the subjectivity of the rarity classification and that regional scale implementations of the framework may differ.",Phenotypic plasticity closely linked to climate at origin and resulting in increased mortality under warming and frost stress in a common grass.,https://www.ncbi.nlm.nih.gov/pubmed/30805164,Ecology and evolution,2019 02 27,"Phenotypic plasticity is important for species responses to global change and species coexistence. Phenotypic plasticity differs among species and traits and changes across environments. Here, we investigated phenotypic plasticity of the widespread grass Arrhenatherum elatius in response to winter warming and frost stress by comparing phenotypic plasticity of 11 geographically and environmentally distinct populations of this species to phenotypic plasticity of populations of different species originating from a single environment. The variation in phenotypic plasticity was similar for populations of a single species from different locations compared to populations of functionally and taxonomically diverse species from one environment for the studied traits (leaf biomass production and root integrity after frost) across three indices of phenotypic plasticity (RDPI, PIN, slope of reaction norm). Phenotypic plasticity was not associated with neutral genetic diversity but closely linked to the climate of the populations' origin. Populations originating from warmer and more variable climates showed higher phenotypic plasticity. This indicates that phenotypic plasticity can itself be considered as a trait subject to local adaptation to climate. Finally, our data emphasize that high phenotypic plasticity is not per se positive for adaptation to climate change, as differences in stress responses are resulting in high phenotypic plasticity as expressed by common plasticity indices, which is likely to be related to increased mortality under stress in more plastic populations.",Near-infrared spectroscopy for metabolite quantification and species identification.,https://www.ncbi.nlm.nih.gov/pubmed/30805163,Ecology and evolution,2019 02 27,"Near-infrared (NIR) spectroscopy is a high-throughput method to analyze the near-infrared region of the electromagnetic spectrum. It detects the absorption of light by molecular bonds and can be used with live insects. In this study, we investigate the accuracy of NIR spectroscopy in determining triglyceride level and species of wild-caught Drosophila. We employ the chemometric approach to produce a multivariate calibration model. The multivariate calibration model is the mathematical relationship between the changes in NIR spectra and the property of interest as determined by the reference analytical method. Once the calibration model was developed, we used an independent set to validate the accuracy of the calibration model. The optimized calibration model for triglyceride quantification yielded coefficients of determination of 0.73 for the calibration test set and 0.70 for the independent test set. Simultaneously, we used NIR spectroscopy to discriminate two species of Drosophila. Flies from independent sets were correctly classified into Drosophila melanogaster and Drosophila simulans with accuracy higher than 80%. These results suggest that NIRS has the potential to be used as a high-throughput screening method to assess a live individual insect's triglyceride level and taxonomic status.",Species-level biodiversity assessment using marine environmental DNA metabarcoding requires protocol optimization and standardization.,https://www.ncbi.nlm.nih.gov/pubmed/30805162,Ecology and evolution,2019 02 27,"DNA extraction from environmental samples (environmental DNA; eDNA) for metabarcoding-based biodiversity studies is gaining popularity as a noninvasive, time-efficient, and cost-effective monitoring tool. The potential benefits are promising for marine conservation, as the marine biome is frequently under-surveyed due to its inaccessibility and the consequent high costs involved. With increasing numbers of eDNA-related publications have come a wide array of capture and extraction methods. Without visual species confirmation, inconsistent use of laboratory protocols hinders comparability between studies because the efficiency of target DNA isolation may vary. We determined an optimal protocol (capture and extraction) for marine eDNA research based on total DNA yield measurements by comparing commonly employed methods of seawater filtering and DNA isolation. We compared metabarcoding results of both targeted (small taxonomic group with species-level assignment) and universal (broad taxonomic group with genus/family-level assignment) approaches obtained from replicates treated with the optimal and a low-performance capture and extraction protocol to determine the impact of protocol choice and DNA yield on biodiversity detection. Filtration through cellulose-nitrate membranes and extraction with Qiagen's DNeasy Blood & Tissue Kit outperformed other combinations of capture and extraction methods, showing a ninefold improvement in DNA yield over the poorest performing methods. Use of optimized protocols resulted in a significant increase in OTU and species richness for targeted metabarcoding assays. However, changing protocols made little difference to the OTU and taxon richness obtained using universal metabarcoding assays. Our results demonstrate an increased risk of false-negative species detection for targeted eDNA approaches when protocols with poor DNA isolation efficacy are employed. Appropriate optimization is therefore essential for eDNA monitoring to remain a powerful, efficient, and relatively cheap method for biodiversity assessments. For seawater, we advocate filtration through cellulose-nitrate membranes and extraction with Qiagen's DNeasy Blood & Tissue Kit or phenol-chloroform-isoamyl for successful implementation of eDNA multi-marker metabarcoding surveys.",Winners and losers: How the elevational range of breeding birds on Alps has varied over the past four decades due to climate and habitat changes.,https://www.ncbi.nlm.nih.gov/pubmed/30805160,Ecology and evolution,2019 02 27,"Climate warming and habitat transformation are widely recognized as worrying threatening factors. Understanding the individual contribution of these two factors to the change of species distribution could be very important in order to effectively counteract the species range contraction, especially in mountains, where alpine species are strongly limited in finding new areas to be colonized at higher elevations. We proposed a method to disentangle the effects of the two drivers of range change for breeding birds in Italian Alps, in the case of co-occurring climate warming and shrub and forest encroachment. For each species, from 1982 to 2017, we related the estimated yearly elevational distribution of birds to the correspondent overall average of the daily minimum temperatures during the breeding season and the estimated amount of shrubs and forest cover. Using a hierarchical partitioning approach, we assessed the net contribution (i.e., without the shared effect) of each driver. Both temperature and shrub and forest cover showed a positive trend along the time series and resulted the most likely causes of the significant elevational displacement for 21 of the 29 investigated birds. While shrub and forest cover was found to be an important driver of the expansion of forest bird range toward higher elevations, the effect of temperature on favouring the colonization of previously climatically unsuitable forests at higher elevations was not negligible. Shrub and forest expansion resulted the main driver of the range contraction for edge and open habitat species, which suffered a distribution shrinkage at their lower elevational boundary. In light of climate warming, these results highlighted how the net range loss for edge and open habitat species, caused by shrub and forest encroachment consequent to land abandonment, should be counteracted by implementing proper conservation management strategies and promoting sustainable economic activities in rangeland areas.",The integrative effects of behavior and morphology on amphibian movement.,https://www.ncbi.nlm.nih.gov/pubmed/30805159,Ecology and evolution,2019 02 27,"Animal movement and dispersal are key factors in population dynamics and support complex ecosystem processes like cross-boundary subsidies. Juvenile dispersal is an important mechanism for many species and often involves navigation in unfamiliar habitats. For species that metamorphose, such as amphibians, this transition from aquatic to terrestrial environments involves the growth and use of new morphological traits (e.g., legs). These traits strongly impact the fundamental ability of an organism to move in novel landscapes, but innate behaviors can regulate choices that result in the realized movements expressed. By assessing the integrative role of morphology and behavior, we can improve our understanding of juvenile movement, particularly in understudied organisms like amphibians. We assessed the roles of morphological (snout-vent length and relative leg length) and performance (maximal jump distance) traits in shaping the free movement paths, measured through fluorescent powder tracking, in three anuran species, Pacific treefrog (Hyliola regilla), Western toad (Anaxyrus boreas), and Cascades frog (Rana cascadae). We standardized the measurement of these traits to compare the relative role of species' innate differences versus physical traits in shaping movement. Innate differences, captured by species identity, were the most significant factor influencing movement paths via total movement distance and path sinuosity. Relative leg length was an important contributor but significantly interacted with species identity. Maximal jump performance, which was significantly predicted by morphological traits, was not an important factor in movement behavior relative to species identity. The importance of species identity and associated behavioral differences in realized movement provide evidence for inherent species differences being central to the dispersal and movement of these species. This behavior may stem from niche partitioning of these sympatric species, yet it also calls into question assumptions generalizing anuran movement behavior. These species-level effects are important in framing differences as past research is applied in management planning.",Patterns of frugivory in the columnar cactus Pilosocereusleucocephalus.,https://www.ncbi.nlm.nih.gov/pubmed/30805158,Ecology and evolution,2019 02 27,"In the frugivory networks of many arid and semi-arid Mesoamerican ecosystems, columnar cacti act as keystone species that produce fruits with a high content of water and nutrients attractive to numerous vertebrates. The aim of this investigation was to assess the fruit removal patterns of two guilds of frugivores on the fruits of the woolly torch Pilosocereus leucocephalus. We assessed fruit pulp removal in two ways: by estimating the consumption of seeds given the amount of pulp removed per visit and by estimating the percentage of pulp removal over time. We put exclosures on unripe, intact fruits to keep frugivores from removing material. Once ripe, we removed the exclosures and tracked animal visitation of 69 fruits using camera traps. We obtained a total of 2,162 hr of footage (14:47 hours of them with effective pulp removal). The highest number of visitors is that of diurnal species (n = 12, all birds) versus only four nocturnal (three bats, one rodent). The most effective species in pulp removal are birds. Bats play a modest role in frugivory of this cactus. The significance of this work is twofold: (a) birds and bats consume the fruit pulp of this cactus and likely disperse its seeds, and (b) although bats rank high in pulp removal effectiveness, birds as a guild far outweigh their importance in this system, as they are not only more frequent but also remove more pulp and seeds. Both groups are known to be important in cacti seed dispersal, and our findings are essential in understanding the population dynamics of the woolly torch and in elucidating its seed dispersal ecology.",Responses of a legume to inbreeding and the intensity of novel and familiar stresses.,https://www.ncbi.nlm.nih.gov/pubmed/30805157,Ecology and evolution,2019 02 27,"It is often assumed that the negative effects of inbreeding on fitness (inbreeding depression, ID) are particularly strong under stressful conditions. However, ID may be relatively mild under types of stress that plant populations have experienced for a long time, because environment-specific deleterious alleles may already have been purged. We examined the performance of open- and self-pollinated progeny of the short-lived calcareous grassland plant Anthyllis vulneraria under three intensities of each of five types of stress. Drought, nutrient deficiency, and defoliation were chosen as stresses typical for the habitat of origin, while shade and waterlogging were expected to be novel, unfamiliar stresses for A. vulneraria. The stresses reduced plant biomass by up to 91%, and the responses of the plants were mostly in line with the functional equilibrium hypothesis. There was significant ID in biomass (δ = 0.17), leaf chlorophyll content, and the number of root nodules of the legume, but the magnitude of ID was independent of the stress treatments. In particular, there was no significant interaction between inbreeding and the intensity of any stress type, and ID was not higher under novel than under familiar stresses. In addition, phenotypic plasticity in biomass allocation, leaf functional traits and in root nodulation of the legume to the various stress treatments was not influenced by inbreeding. Our findings do not support the common hypothesis of stronger ID under stressful environments, not even if the stresses are novel to the plants.",Bidirectional mitochondrial introgression between Korean cobitid fish mediated by hybridogenetic hybrids.,https://www.ncbi.nlm.nih.gov/pubmed/30805156,Ecology and evolution,2019 02 27,"Genomic introgression through interspecific hybridization has been observed in some species of the freshwater fish family Cobitidae. Within this family, a Cobitis hankugensis-Iksookimia longicorpa diploid-triploid hybrid species complex on the Korean peninsula is unique in displaying hybridogenesis, a unisexual reproduction mode that allows hybrids to mediate the transfer of mitochondrial DNA (but not nuclear DNA) between the two parent species. However, populations of the parental species in the wild have never been examined for the potential effect of introgression on their genomes. To address the genetic consequences of unisexual hybridization on the parental species, we examined genetic structure of the two parental species, C. hankugensis and I. longicorpa, in three independent natural habitats where they coexist with their hybrid complex using DNA sequence data of one mitochondrial gene and three nuclear genes. We found that mitochondrial introgression between the two species was extensive in all the examined localities, while there was no evidence of nuclear introgression across the species boundary. This result indicates that the hybridogenetic individuals mediate mitochondrial introgression from one species to the other, producing mito-nuclear mosaic genomes such as C. hankugensis nuclear genomes associated with I. longicorpa mitochondrial DNA and the reverse. The direction and degree of introgression varied among the three localities, but the underlying mechanisms for this observation proved elusive. Introgression might depend on which species serves as the predominant sperm or ovum donor or the environmental conditions of the localities. The present study suggests that introgressive hybridization between pure C. hankugensis and I. longicorpa species is highly likely where the two species co-occur with hybridogenetic individuals, but the consequence of introgression could be variable due to the history and environmental characteristics of particular populations across the parental species' ranges."

Yet, little is known about the interactive effect of climate change and grazing on biodiversity and ecosystem functioning. Here, we conducted a vegetation translocation experiment (ten soil-vegetation blocks were translocated from high-altitudinal site 3,245 m to low-altitudinal site 3,045 m) combined with grazing treatment in an alpine meadow on the Tibetan Plateau. The results showed that (a) translocation induced effect of climate change from harsh, high-altitudinal site to benign, low-altitudinal site significantly promoted species richness, and density of asexual and sexual seedling, with an increase in the proportion of asexual recruitment to sexual recruitment; (b) grazing decreased the proportion of asexual seedling to sexual recruitment within community, led to a shift in the dominant plant functional groups from graminoids and legumes to forbs; and (c) grazing partly offset the increased species richness of seedling, but not seedling density, induced by climate change. These findings suggest that moderate grazing may buffer the effect of climate change on the plant community composition, and thus, functional role in alpine meadows. Further understanding the influence of climate change on grassland ecosystems needs to consider the non-additive effect of grazing and climate change to sustainability of grassland services.",No evidence of handling-induced mortality in Serengeti's African wild dog population.,https://www.ncbi.nlm.nih.gov/pubmed/30805144,Ecology and evolution,2019 02 27,"The disappearance of an endangered African wild dog population from Serengeti National Park (SNP) led to international debate centered around one question: were researchers to blame? The ""Burrows' hypothesis"" postulated that stress induced by research-related immobilization and handling reactivated a latent rabies virus, eliminating the population. Insufficient data inhibited hypothesis testing, but since wild dogs persisted alongside SNP and have been studied since 2005, the hypothesis can be tested 25 years after its proposition. To be supported, wild dog immobilization interventions should have resulted in high mortality rates. However, 87.6% of 121 handled wild dogs (2006-2016) survived >12 months post-handling. Some argued that viral reactivation would necessitate long-term stress. Following immobilization, 67 animals were captured, transported, and held in a translocation enclosure. Despite the longer-term stress, 95.5% survived >12 months. Furthermore, the stable number of wild dog packs in the ecosystem over the past decade, and lack of recolonization of SNP, strongly oppose Burrows' hypothesis. Instead, factors such as heightened levels of interspecific competition are likely to have contributed to the wild dog disappearance and subsequent avoidance of the Serengeti plains. Handling and radio telemetry are invaluable when studying elusive endangered species, yielding information pertinent to their conservation and management, and had no effect on Serengeti wild dog survival.","Effects of soil nitrogen on diploid advantage in fireweed, Chamerion angustifolium (Onagraceae).",https://www.ncbi.nlm.nih.gov/pubmed/30805143,Ecology and evolution,2019 02 27,"In many ecosystems, plant growth and reproduction are nitrogen limited. Current and predicted increases of global reactive nitrogen could alter the ecological and evolutionary trajectories of plant populations. Nitrogen is a major component of nucleic acids and cell structures, and it has been predicted that organisms with larger genomes should require more nitrogen for growth and reproduction and be more negatively affected by nitrogen scarcities than organisms with smaller genomes. In a greenhouse experiment, we tested this hypothesis by examining whether the amount of soil nitrogen supplied differentially influenced the performance (fitness, growth, and resource allocation strategies) of diploid and autotetraploid fireweed (Chamerion angustifolium). We found that soil nitrogen levels differentially impacted cytotype performance, and in general, diploids were favored under low nitrogen conditions, but this diploid advantage disappeared under nitrogen enrichment. Specifically, when nitrogen was scarce, diploids produced more seeds and allocated more biomass toward seed production relative to investment in plant biomass or total plant nitrogen than did tetraploids. As nitrogen supplied increased, such discrepancies between cytotypes disappeared. We also found that cytotype resource allocation strategies were differentially dependent on soil nitrogen, and that whereas diploids adopted resource allocation strategies that favored current season reproduction when nitrogen was limiting and future reproduction when nitrogen was more plentiful, tetraploids adopted resource allocation strategies that favored current season reproduction under nitrogen enrichment. Together these results suggest nitrogen enrichment could differentially affect cytotype performance, which could have implications for cytotypes' ecological and evolutionary dynamics under a globally changing climate.",Flooding regimes increase avian predation on wildlife prey in tidal marsh ecosystems.,https://www.ncbi.nlm.nih.gov/pubmed/30805142,Ecology and evolution,2019 02 27,"Within isolated and fragmented populations, species interactions such as predation can cause shifts in community structure and demographics in tidal marsh ecosystems. It is critical to incorporate species interactions into our understanding when evaluating the effects of sea-level rise and storm surges on tidal marshes. In this study, we hypothesize that avian predators will increase their presence and hunting activities during high tides when increased inundation makes their prey more vulnerable. We present evidence that there is a relationship between tidal inundation depth and time of day on the presence, abundance, and behavior of avian predators. We introduce predation pressure as a combined probability of predator presence related to water level. Focal surveys were conducted at four tidal marshes in the San Francisco Bay, California where tidal inundation patterns were monitored across 6 months of the winter. Sixteen avian predator species were observed. During high tide at Tolay Slough marsh, ardeids had a 29-fold increase in capture attempts and 4 times greater apparent success rate compared with low tide. Significantly fewer raptors and ardeids were found on low tides than on high tides across all sites. There were more raptors in December and January and more ardeids in January than in other months. Ardeids were more prevalent in the morning, while raptors did not exhibit a significant response to time of day. Modeling results showed that raptors had a unimodal response to water level with a peak at 0.5 m over the marsh platform, while ardeids had an increasing response with water level. We found that predation pressure is related to flooding of the marsh surface, and short-term increases in sea levels from high astronomical tides, sea-level rise, and storm surges increase vulnerability of tidal marsh wildlife.",Nitrate or ammonium: Influences of nitrogen source on the physiology of a green alga.,https://www.ncbi.nlm.nih.gov/pubmed/30805141,Ecology and evolution,2019 02 27,"In freshwaters, algal species are exposed to different inorganic nitrogen (Ni) sources whose incorporation varies in biochemical energy demand.

The amphibians of the northern Great Plains of North America present an opportunity to investigate how these factors affect colonization, migration, and current population genetic structure. This study used 11 microsatellite loci to genotype 1,230 northern leopard frogs (Rana pipiens) from 41 wetlands (30 samples/wetland) across North Dakota. Genetic structure of the sampled frogs was evaluated using Bayesian and multivariate clustering methods. All analyses produced concordant results, identifying a major east-west split between two R. pipiens population clusters separated by the Missouri River. Substructuring within the two major identified population clusters was also found. Spatial principal component analysis (sPCA) and variance partitioning analysis identified distance, river basins, and the Missouri River as the most important landscape factors differentiating R. pipiens populations across the state. Bayesian reconstruction of coalescence times suggested the major east-west split occurred ~13-18 kya during a period of glacial retreat in the northern Great Plains and substructuring largely occurred ~5-11 kya during a period of extreme drought cycles. A range-wide species distribution model (SDM) for R. pipiens was developed and applied to prehistoric climate conditions during the Last Glacial Maximum (21 kya) and the mid-Holocene (6 kya) from the CCSM4 climate model to identify potential refugia. The SDM indicated potential refugia existed in South Dakota or further south in Nebraska. The ancestral populations of R. pipiens in North Dakota may have inhabited these refugia, but more sampling outside the state is needed to reconstruct the route of colonization. Using microsatellite genotype data, this study determined that colonization from glacial refugia, drought dynamics in the northern Great Plains, and major rivers acting as barriers to gene flow were the defining forces shaping the regional population structure of R. pipiens in North Dakota.",Assessing eukaryotic biodiversity in the Florida Keys National Marine Sanctuary through environmental DNA metabarcoding.,https://www.ncbi.nlm.nih.gov/pubmed/30805138,Ecology and evolution,2019 02 27,"Environmental DNA (eDNA) is the DNA suspended in the environment (e.g., water column), which includes cells, gametes, and other material derived from but not limited to shedding of tissue, scales, mucus, and fecal matter. Amplifying and sequencing marker genes (i.e., metabarcoding) from eDNA can reveal the wide range of taxa present in an ecosystem through analysis of a single water sample. Metabarcoding of eDNA provides higher resolution data than visual surveys, aiding in assessments of ecosystem health. This study conducted eDNA metabarcoding of two molecular markers (cytochrome c oxidase I (COI) and 18S ribosomal RNA (rRNA) genes) to survey eukaryotic diversity across multiple trophic levels in surface water samples collected at three sites along the coral reef tract within the Florida Keys National Marine Sanctuary (FKNMS) during four research cruises in 2015. The 18S rRNA gene sequences recovered 785 genera while the COI gene sequences recovered 115 genera, with only 33 genera shared between the two datasets, emphasizing the complementarity of these marker genes. Community composition for both genetic markers clustered by month of sample collection, suggesting that temporal variation has a larger effect on biodiversity than spatial variability in the FKNMS surface waters. Sequences from both marker genes were dominated by copepods, but each marker recovered distinct phytoplankton groups, with 18S rRNA gene sequences dominated by dinoflagellates and COI sequences dominated by coccolithophores. Although eDNA samples were collected from surface waters, many benthic species such as sponges, crustaceans, and corals were identified. These results show the utility of eDNA metabarcoding for cataloging biodiversity to establish an ecosystem baseline against which future samples can be compared in order to monitor community changes.","A description of nesting behaviors, including factors impacting nest site selection, in black-and-white ruffed lemurs (Varecia variegata).",https://www.ncbi.nlm.nih.gov/pubmed/30805137,Ecology and evolution,2019 02 27,"Nest site selection is at once fundamental to reproduction and a poorly understood component of many organisms' reproductive investment. This study investigates the nesting behaviors of black-and-white ruffed lemurs, Varecia variegata, a litter-bearing primate from the southeastern rainforests of Madagascar. Using a combination of behavioral, geospatial, and demographic data, I test the hypotheses that environmental and social cues influence nest site selection and that these decisions ultimately impact maternal reproductive success. Gestating females built multiple large nests throughout their territories. Of these, females used only a fraction of the originally constructed nests, as well as several parking locations as infants aged. Nest construction was best predicted by environmental cues, including the size of the nesting tree and density of feeding trees within a 75 m radius of the nest, whereas nest use depended largely on the size and average distance to feeding trees within that same area. Microhabitat characteristics were unrelated to whether females built or used nests. Although unrelated to nest site selection, social cues, specifically the average distance to conspecifics' nest and park sites, were related to maternal reproductive success; mothers whose litters were parked in closer proximity to others' nests experienced higher infant survival than those whose nests were more isolated. This is likely because nesting proximity facilitated communal crèche use by neighboring females. Together, these results suggest a complex pattern of nesting behaviors that involves females strategically building nests in areas with high potential resource abundance, using nests in areas according to their realized productivity, and communally rearing infants within a network of nests distributed throughout the larger communal territory.","The role of indirect genetic effects in the evolution of interacting reproductive behaviors in the burying beetle, Nicrophorus vespilloides.",https://www.ncbi.nlm.nih.gov/pubmed/30805136,Ecology and evolution,2019 02 27,"Social interactions can give rise to indirect genetic effects (IGEs), which occur when genes expressed in one individual affect the phenotype of another individual. The evolutionary dynamics of traits can be altered when there are IGEs. Sex often involves indirect effects arising from first-order (current) or second-order (prior) social interactions, yet IGEs are infrequently quantified for reproductive behaviors. Here, we use experimental populations of burying beetles that have experienced bidirectional selection on mating rate to test for social plasticity and IGEs associated with focal males mating with a female either without (first-order effect) or with (second-order effect) prior exposure to a competitor, and resource defense behavior (first-order effect). Additive IGEs were detected for mating rate arising from (first-order) interactions with females. For resource defense behavior, a standard variance partitioning analysis provided no evidence of additive genetic variance-either direct or indirect. However, behavior was predicted by focal size relative to that of the competitor, and size is also heritable. Assuming that behavior is causally dependent on relative size, this implies that both DGEs and IGEs do occur (and may potentially interact). The relative contribution of IGEs may differ among social behaviors related to mating which has consequences for the evolutionary trajectories of multivariate traits."

B-cell lymphoma 6 (BCL6) functions as a transcriptional repressor. The present study is designed to determine the roles of BCL6 in VSMC proliferation and oxidative stress and underlying mechanism. Angiotensin (Ang) II was used to induce VSMC proliferation and oxidative stress in human VSMCs. Effects of BCL6 overexpression and knockdown were, respectively, investigated in Ang II-treated human VSMCs. Therapeutical effects of BCL6 overexpression on vascular remodeling, oxidative stress, and proliferation were determined in the aorta of spontaneously hypertensive rats (SHR). Ang II reduced BCL6 expression in human VSMCs. BCL6 overexpression attenuated while BCL6 knockdown enhanced the Ang II-induced upregulation of NADPH oxidase 4 (NOX4), production of reactive oxygen species (ROS), and proliferation of VSMCs. BCL6 expression was downregulated in SHR. BCL6 overexpression in SHR reduced NOX4 expression, ROS production, and proliferation of the aortic media of SHR. Moreover, BCL6 overexpression attenuated vascular remodeling and hypertension in SHR. However, BCL6 overexpression had no significant effects on NOX2 expression in human VSMCs or in SHR.

Each Omega point theoretically represents a different embryologic tissue layer, with a correspondence to specific physical body attributes and certain emotional developments. Maurice Verdun, MD, and René J. Bourdiol, MD, developed the use of distinguishable anthropobiometric parameters and specific psychologic tests to classify a large clinical population into 4 categories that have both somatic and emotional features. The categories were: (1) normosome (normal); (2) leptosome (willowy); (3) pycnosome (rotund); and (4) athletosome (athletic). Dr. Bourdiol hypothesized that these biopsychomorphotypologic variations resulted from subtle overexpression of one of the three embryologic tissues during embryological development. Dr. Nogier and David Alimi, MD, both theorized that the three embryologic tissue layers are represented on the external ear by the 3 different Omega points: (1) Omega; (2) Omega 1; and (3) Omega 2. The expression of these points can be found by their electrodermal potentials. The aim of this survey was to find a unifying method to determine if all the clinical assessments observed from varied disciplines and different researchers could lead to a consistent theoretical perspective on the embryologic basis for auriculotherapy. Materials and Methods: The electrodermal potential of the 3 auricular Omega points were measured on 250 patients who requested auriculotherapy since the beginning of this survey, which began in February 2010. The patients were classified as normosome, pycnosome, leptosome, athletosome, athleto-leptosome, athleto-pycnosome, and dysmorphic. Electrodermal measurements of the Omega points on individual patients were compared to the phenotypical expression related to the theoretical expression of the embryologic tissues. Results: There was a prominent concordance between overexpression of an Omega point and the morphotype of an individual patient in 90% of the cases. In particular, there was a concordance between overexpression of an Omega point and the psychoemotional type in 92.4% of the cases. Conclusions: The clinical assessments of Drs. Verdun, Bourdiol, Nogier, and Alimi were supported by the electrophysiologic measurements of auricular reflex points. The original hypothesis of Dr. Bourdiol regarding anthropobiometric qualities was in concordance with the data obtained in this research. The Omega points have not only fundamental correspondences related to anatomical and physiologic embryogenesis but also are connected to a more-abstract significance related to a person's higher-order cognitive and emotional development.",Effect of Electroacupuncture on Natural-Killer Cells and Tumor Size in Patients with Cervical Squamous-Cell Carcinoma: A Randomized Controlled Trial.,https://www.ncbi.nlm.nih.gov/pubmed/30805077,Medical acupuncture,2019 02 27,"Background: A natural-killer (NK) cell is a cytotoxic lymphocyte that responds to tumor formation. Electroacupuncture (EA) in patients with cancer, who had chemotherapy, enabled them to maintain their T-cell counts (CD3+, CD4+, and CD8+) and NK-cell activity. Objective: To evaluate NK-cell levels and tumor sizes in patients with cervical squamous-cell carcinoma (SCC) after EA on ST 36 (Zusanli). Design: This study was a randomized, experimental clinical study with a pre-post-test, control group design. Setting The study was performed in the obstetrics and gynecology department, Gynecology Oncology Division of the Rumah Sakit Dokter Soetomo General Hospital, in Surabaya, Jawa Timur, Indonesia, conducted from February 2016 until May 2016. Subjects: Patients with cervical SCC, stages IIb-IIIb (locally advanced)-determined clinically and histopathologically-all of whom had 50 mg/m2/week of cisplatin chemotherapy. The patients were divided, consecutively, into 2 groups by simple random sampling. Intervention: The controls received only received the chemotherapy, while treatment-group patients also had EA 1 day on bilateral ST 36 after each chemotherapy cycle. Outcome Measures: Primary outcomes were percent of NK cells and tumor size. Before the first treatment and after the fourth one, all patients underwent peripheral blood examinations (complete blood counts, serum creatinine and blood-urea-nitrogen levels, and flow-cytometry) to determine percentages of NK cells, and pelvic magnetic resonance imaging to measure cervical tumor sizes. Secondary outcomes were pain, nausea, vomiting, and appetite. Results: There was a significant increase in number of NK cells (P = 0.00) and a significant decrease in tumor sizes (P = 0.03) in the treatment group, compared to the control group. There was a significant increase in appetite (P = 0.00) in the treatment group, compared to baseline, but there were no significant differences in pain (P = 0.061), nausea (P = 0.399), and vomiting (P = 0.854). Conclusions: Patients with cervical SCC at stages IIb-IIIb, who received 4 cycles of chemotherapy using 50 mg/m2/week of cisplatin and EA at ST 36, had increased NK-cell percentages in their peripheral blood and had reductions in their cervical tumors.",Distinct Neuroanatomical Structures of Acupoints Kidney 1 to Kidney 8: A Cadaveric Study.,https://www.ncbi.nlm.nih.gov/pubmed/30805076,Medical acupuncture,2019 02 27,"Objective: The Systematic Classic/Zhen Jiu Jia Yi Jing (ZJJYJ, ) is considered to be the first complete acupuncture manual to detail the location and meridian assignations of 349 acupuncture points. Despite numerous transcriptions and editing changes, many traditional acupuncturists adhere to the classics and rarely question their validity. However, ushering the use of acupuncture into the modern era requires examining acupuncture point locations objectively by comparing contemporary anatomical knowledge with classical texts. The aim of this research was to examine distinct neuroanatomical targets associated with acupuncture points to: (1) standardize the precise neuroanatomical target of each acupuncture point; and (2) crossreference neuroanatomical targets with classical point locations. This was done to demonstrate ancient authors' intentions when describing acupuncture points as coordinates used to stimulate the peripheral nervous system. Materials and Methods: The unique neuroanatomical targets associated with acupuncture points on the Foot Shao Yin Kidney meridian were defined. Specifically, KI 1 through KI 8 were examined by comparing classical point locations from the ZJJYJ with modern standardized textbook locations from Chinese Acupuncture and Moxibustion, current anatomical literature, the current authors' cadaver dissection research, and electrostimulation of acupuncture points in healthy volunteers. Results: KI 1-KI 8 correlated with motor entry points as well as with nerve branches and vessels derived from the posterior tibial neurovascular bundle. Conclusions: This research demonstrated a procedure to verify and standardize the distinct neuroanatomical structures of acupuncture points.

In addition to Lactobacilli, other microorganisms populate the cervicovaginal microbiota, like Candida spp. and Gardnerella vaginalis. The overgrowth of Candida spp. or G. vaginalis, known as biofilm-producing microorganisms in the genital ecosystem, may lead to microbial dysbiosis that increases the risk of acquiring sexually transmitted infections, like Chlamydia trachomatis. C. trachomatis, the leading cause of bacterial sexually transmitted diseases, is still considered an important public health problem worldwide because of the impact of asymptomatic infections on long-term reproductive sequelae, including pelvic inflammatory disease and infertility. The aim of our study was to investigate the interaction between C. trachomatis and the biofilm produced by Candida albicans or Gardnerella vaginalis, evaluating whether the biofilm can harbor C. trachomatis and influence its survival as well as its infectious properties. In order to do so, we developed an in vitro coculture transwell-based biofilm model. Our findings proved, for the first time, that C. trachomatis, an intracellular obligate pathogen, survived, for up to 72 hours after exposure, inside the biofilm produced by C. albicans or G. vaginalis, retaining its infectious properties, as evidenced by the typical chlamydial inclusions observed in the cell monolayer (chlamydial inclusion-forming units at 72 h: 9255 ± 1139 and 9873 ± 1015, respectively). In conclusion, our results suggest that the biofilm related to Candida or Gardnerella genital infections may act as a reservoir of C. trachomatis and, thus, contribute to the transmission of the infection in the population as well as to its dissemination into the upper genital tract, increasing the risk of developing severe reproductive sequelae."

The two common diseases share several predisposing factors such as lifestyle and senescence, and inflammation and oxidative stress play an important role in their development and progression. Incidental cases of AF treated successfully by proton pump inhibitor (PPI) applied for coexisting GERD have been sporadically reported. An increasing evidence indicates that GERD induces the initiation and the perpetuation of AF. This is caused by the autonomic nerve influence, mechanical compression, and propagation of local inflammation due to proximity of left atrium (LA) and lower esophagus. Meanwhile, AF also develops GERD by mechanical and inflammatory actions of LA characterized by remodeling and inflammation. The robust association of AF with GERD is not limited to their natural interaction, i.e., pharmacological or nonpharmacological treatment of AF is reported to aggravate GERD. Many cardiac drugs (anticoagulants, calcium antagonists, and nitrates) induce esophageal mucosal damage and lower esophageal sphincter relaxation promoting acid reflux. These drugs are frequently prescribed in patients with AF for stroke prevention, rate control, and for coexisting coronary heart disease. Catheter ablation also yields both GERD and esophageal thermal injury, which is a precursor lesion of atrioesophageal fistula. The notion that AF and GERD are mutually interdependent is widely and empirically recognized. However, mechanistic link of the two common diseases and objective evaluation of PPI as an adjunctive AF treatment warrant future large-scale prospective trials.",The impact of catheter ablation for atrial fibrillation in heart failure.,https://www.ncbi.nlm.nih.gov/pubmed/30805042,Journal of arrhythmia,2019 03 29,"Atrial fibrillation (AF) commonly co-exists with systolic heart failure (SHF) and its presence is associated with a worse prognosis. Despite this, a rhythm control approach using antiarrhythmic drugs (AADs) to reduce AF burden has demonstrated no prognostic benefit. Catheter ablation (AFA) is more effective than AADs at reducing AF burden. We performed a meta-analysis to evaluate the impact of AFA on outcomes in SHF. Electronic databases were systematically searched. We included only randomized controlled trials that examined the impact of AFA on clinical outcomes in patients with SHF (LVEF <50%). We included studies with any ablation strategy that incorporated pulmonary vein isolation and any control group. Seven studies (n = 858) were included with a mean follow-up of 6-38 months. In comparison to controls, AFA was associated with significant reductions in all-cause mortality (relative risk [RR] 0.52, P = 0.0009) and unplanned or heart failure hospitalization (RR 0.58, P < 0.00001). Compared to controls, AFA was also associated with significant improvements in LVEF (mean difference 6.30%, P < 0.00001), Minnesota Living with Heart Failure Questionnaire score (mean difference 9.58, P = 0.0003), 6-minute walk distance (mean difference 31.78 m, P = 0.003) and VO 2 max (mean difference 3.17, P = 0.003). However, major procedure-related complications occurred in 2.4%-15% of ablation patients. In patients with AF and SHF, catheter ablation has significant benefits. Further work is needed to establish the role of ablation in the routine treatment of SHF patients with AF.",Implantable loop recorder in clinical practice.,https://www.ncbi.nlm.nih.gov/pubmed/30805041,Journal of arrhythmia,2019 02 27,"The implantable loop recorder (ILR), also known as insertable cardiac monitor (ICM) is a subcutaneous device used for diagnosing heart rhythm disorders. These devices have been strongly improved and miniaturized during the last years showing several reliable features along with the availability of remote monitoring which improves the diagnostic timing and the follow-up strategy with a potential reduction of costs for health care. The recent advent of injectable ILRs makes the procedure even easier and more tolerated by patients. ILR allows the investigation of unexplained recurrent syncope with uncertain diagnosis, revealing a possible relationship with cardiac arrhythmias. In addition, it has recently been equipped with sophisticated algorithms able to detect atrial fibrillation episodes. This new opportunity may provide to the physicians systematic heart rhythm screening with possible effects on patient antiarrhythmic and anticoagulant therapy management. The use of such devices will surely increase, since they may be helpful to diagnose a wide range of disorders and pathologies. Indeed, further studies should be performed in order to identify all the potentialities of these tools.",Ablation of atrial fibrillation in patients with Brugada syndrome: A systematic review of the literature.,https://www.ncbi.nlm.nih.gov/pubmed/30805040,Journal of arrhythmia,2019 02 27,"Supraventricular arrhythmias are common in Brugada syndrome (BS), and notoriously difficult to manage with medical therapy secondary to associated risks. Pulmonary vein isolation (PVI) is often utilized instead, but its outcomes in this population are not well-known. We aim to provide a holistic evaluation of interventional treatment for Atrial fibrillation (AF) in the BS population. Electronic databases Medline, Embase, Cinahl, Cochrane, and Scopus were systematically searched for publications between 01/01/1995 and 12/31/2017. Studies were screened based on predefined inclusion and exclusion criteria. A total of 49 patients with BS and AF were included. Age range from 28.8 to 64 years, and 77.5% were male. 38 patients were implanted with implantable cardioverter-defibrillators (ICD) at baseline, and of them, 39% suffered inappropriate shocks for rapid AF. 34/49 (69%) of patients achieved remission following a single PVI procedure. Of the remaining, 13 patients underwent one or more repeat ablation procedures. Overall, 45/49 (91.8%) of patients remained in remission during long-term follow-up after one or more PVI procedures in the absence of antiarrhythmic drug (AAD) therapy. Postablation, no patients suffered inappropriate ICD shock. Furthermore, no major complications secondary to PVI occurred in any patient. AF ablation achieves acute and long-term success in the vast majority of patients. It is effective in preventing inappropriate ICD therapy secondary to rapid AF. Complication rates of PVI in BS are low. Thus, in light of the risks of AADs and risk of inappropriate ICD shocks in the BS population, catheter ablation could represent an appropriate first-line therapy for paroxysmal atrial fibrillation in BS patients.",Reflections on the early invasive clinical cardiac electrophysiology era through fifty manuscripts: 1967-1992.,https://www.ncbi.nlm.nih.gov/pubmed/30805039,Journal of arrhythmia,2019 02 27,"In 1967, researchers in The Netherlands and France independently reported a new technique, later called programmed electrical stimulation. The ability to reproducibly initiate and terminate arrhythmias heralded the beginning of invasive clinical cardiac electrophysiology as a medical discipline. Over the next fifty years, insights into the pathophysiologic basis of arrhythmias would transform the field into an interventional specialty with a tremendous armamentarium of procedures. In 2015, the variety and complexity of these procedures were major reasons that led to the recommendation for an increase in the training period from one year to two years. The purpose of this manuscript is to present fifty manuscripts from the early invasive clinical cardiac electrophysiology era, between 1967 and 1992, to serve as an educational resource for current and future electrophysiologists. It is our hope that reflection on the transition from a predominantly noninvasive discipline to one where procedures are commonly utilized will lead to more thoughtful patient care today and to inspiration for innovation tomorrow.

Consequently, it has been hypothesized that dynamic monitoring of changes in these markers may predict the shrinkage or growth of colorectal cancers. To test this hypothesis, we analyzed CEA and CA19-9 serum levels in patients with advanced colorectal cancer who received cetuximab in combination with chemotherapy. These levels were evaluated at various time points to identify their potential to serve as early efficacy predictors during treatment and early predictors of disease progression.","Assessment of Dietary Patterns Represents a Potential, Yet Variable, Measure of Inflammatory Status: A Review and Update.",https://www.ncbi.nlm.nih.gov/pubmed/30805036,Disease markers,2019 06 13,"Chronic low-grade, systemic inflammation is a well-characterized risk factor in the development of chronic metabolic diseases, such as cardiovascular disease, type 2 diabetes, and metabolic syndrome. Diet could be an effective strategy for reducing inflammation associated with chronic disease. While anti-inflammatory properties of isolated dietary bioactive and functional foods have been routinely studied, the evaluation of dietary patterns on inflammation warrants further review-especially given the recent inclusion of dietary pattern recommendations into dietary guidelines and policies. Therefore, the objective of this narrative review is to examine current evidence linking diet to low-grade, systemic inflammation within the context of chronic disease. Specifically, we provide an update on the findings from human trials that have characterized anti-inflammatory properties of dietary patterns, defined by various methods and indexes. Given the complexity of interpreting results from dietary pattern analysis, we further present recent evidence on the anti-inflammatory roles of isolated bioactive nutrients and functional foods that are common components of distinct dietary patterns, in addition to considerations for interpreting dietary pattern research, population-specific dietary recommendations, and future studies. Overall, we observe a vast range of variability in the evidence from observational studies that have evaluated the relationships between healthy dietary patterns and inflammatory markers. These studies highlight the need for additional intervention studies with study designs that account for metabolic status, diversity in populations, breadth of inflammatory measurements, fasting vs. postprandial effects of diet, and control of confounding factors (e.g., genotype, microbiome profiles, and dietary adherence) in order to better understand the effect that diet has, as a whole, on inflammation. These strategies will help to strengthen diet recommendations aimed at reducing inflammation and chronic disease risk."

This is a single-centre, cross-sectional, observational, non-interventional, non-randomized trial in University based women's hospital, division of Gynecological Endocrinology and Reproductive Medicine. All participants followed a standardized, holistic battery of biopsychosocial assessments consisting of bio-functional status (BFS), bio-functional age (BFA) and the questionnaire for chronic stress exposure (TICS). 624 non-pediatric, non-geriatric subjects were recruited in the BeCS-14 cohort. The mean difference between chronological age and BFA was 7.8 ± 8.0 year equivalents. The mean stress level score assessed by SSCS was 13.2 with 45.4% being exposed to above average stress intensity. 22 BFS items (14 objective, 7 subjective) significantly correlated with chronic stress exposure (TICS-SSCS). The constructed sum score composed of SOC_L9 and complaint questionnaire (physical and emotional wellbeing) represented chronic stress exposure best (pearson-correlation value 0.564, p < 0.0001). Higher chronic stress exposure was associated with bio-functional pro-aging (less vitality) in both sexes. In conclusion, chronic stress is accepted as a major risk factor for developing non-communicable diseases (NCD).

Blood pressure of a human being is controlled by the autonomic nervous system. Heart rate variability (HRV) is an impact of the autonomic nervous system and an indicator of the balance of the cardiac sympathetic nerve and vagus nerve. HRV is a good method to recognize the severity of hypertension due to the specificity for prediction. In this paper, we proposed a novel fine-grained HRV analysis method to enhance the precision of recognition. In order to analyze the HRV of the patient, we segment the overnight electrocardiogram (ECG) into various scales. 18 HRV multidimensional features in the time, frequency, and nonlinear domain are extracted, and then the temporal pyramid pooling method is designed to reduce feature dimensions. Multifactor analysis of variance (MANOVA) is applied to filter the related features and establish the hypertension recognizing model with relevant features to efficiently recognize the patients' severity. In this paper, 139 hypertension patients' real clinical ECG data are applied, and the overall precision is 95.1%.

However, the molecular mechanism underlying its action is still unclear. The aim of this study was to determine the effect of salidroside on sodium channel current (INa) and transient outward potassium channel current (Ito) in H9C2 cardiomyocytes. H9C2 cells were subcultured under anoxic conditions to mimic myocardial hypoxia and subsequently treated with salidroside. Whole cell patch clamp was performed to determine the effect of hypoxia/reoxygenation and salidroside on myocardial electrophysiological properties. In the differentiated H9C2 cells, hypoxia/reoxygenation reduced INa and Ito amplitude, while salidroside significantly restored both and altered the INa and Ito activation/inactivation kinetics in a dose-dependent manner. Our findings demonstrate that salidroside protects myocardial cells against hypoxia-reoxygenation by restoring the function of sodium and potassium channels.",Potential Antiglycation and Hypoglycaemic Effects of Toona ciliata M.

Thereafter, their antioxidant and antiglycation potentials were spectrophotometrically determined. The cytotoxicity profiles of the extracts on C2C12 cells were determined using the MTT assay. Toona ciliata methanol extract resulted in the highest percentage yield (20.83%) and high total phenols and flavonoids content in the methanol and acetone extracts compared to S. pinnata extracts. The acetone extract of T. ciliata showed good activity in the DPPH scavenging and FRAP assays with EC50 values of 1.90 mg/ml and 5.26 mg/ml, respectively. Arbutin's antiglycation ability was outperformed by treatments with the methanol, acetone, and hexane extract of T. ciliata which resulted in 2.49%, 2.79%, and 2.56% glycation, respectively. The hexane extract of T. ciliata was less toxic to C2C12 cells as compared to the other extracts with CC50 value of 402.16 μg/ml. Only the hexane extract of S. pinnata resulted in glucose utilisation of 28.56% which was higher than that of insulin (26.06%) after 6 hours and is therefore considered as the most potent extract with hypoglycaemic potential in this study. Studies are ongoing aimed at identifying drug candidates in this extract that may be employed in the development of hypoglycaemic, antioxidant, and antiglycation agents.","Hong Kong Chinese Medicine Clinical Practice Guideline for Cancer Palliative Care: Pain, Constipation, and Insomnia.",https://www.ncbi.nlm.nih.gov/pubmed/30805017,Evidence-based complementary and alternative medicine : eCAM,2019 02 27,"It is common for patients with cancers in Hong Kong seeking Chinese Medicine (CM) therapies as supportive care during cancer treatment and to manage treatment-related side effects.

Until the emergence of induced pluripotent stem cells (iPSCs), autologous cell sources of this magnitude and with the required complexity were not available. Growing this number of cells in a traditional 2D cell culture system requires extensive time, resources, and effort and does not always meet clinical requirements. The use of a closed cell culture system is an efficient and clinically applicable method that can be used to expand cells under controlled conditions. We aimed to use the Quantum Cell Expansion System (QES) as an iPSC monolayer-based expansion system. Human iPSCs were expanded (up to 14-fold) using the QES on two different coatings (laminin 521 (LN521) and vitronectin (VN)), and a karyotype analysis was performed. The cells were characterized for spontaneous differentiation and pluripotency by RT-PCR and flow cytometry. Our results demonstrated that the QES provides the necessary environment for exponential iPSC growth, reaching 689.75 × 106 ± 86.88 × 106 in less than 7 days using the LN521 coating with a population doubling level of 3.80 ± 0.19. The same result was not observed when VN was used as a coating. The cells maintained normal karyotype (46-XX), expressed pluripotency markers (OCT4, NANOG, LIN28, SOX2, REX1, DPPA4, NODAL, TDGFb, TERT3, and GDF), and expressed high levels of OCT4, SOX2, NANOG, SSEA4, TRA1-60, and TRA1-81. Spontaneous differentiation into ectoderm (NESTIN, TUBB3, and NEFH), mesoderm (MSX1, BMP4, and T), and endoderm (GATA6, AFP, and SOX17) lineages was detected by RT-PCR with both coating systems. We conclude that the QES maintains the stemness of iPSCs and is a promising platform to provide the number of cells necessary to recellularize small human-sized organ scaffolds for clinical purposes."

Vitamin D could prevent dental caries. The goal of this study was to identify whether there is an association between hormonal therapy with growth hormone (GH), vitamin D3 supplementation, vitamin D3 levels, and the occurrence of caries among children affected by GHD. The study group consisted of patients from the Department of Endocrinology and Diabetology of the University Paediatric Hospital at the Medical University of Lublin treated with recombinant human GH for pituitary GHD. It was conducted between October 2014 and June 2015. The study group included 121 children and adolescents aged 6 to 18 years, with 56 children from rural areas and 65 from urban areas. The study group was stratified by the area of residence. We found the statistically significant impact of vitamin D3 concentration on the average value of the DMFT (decayed, missed, and filled teeth) index and its component-DT (decayed teeth), which was noted in subjects from rural areas. Among patients from urban areas, we found a statistically significant correlation between duration of therapy and the DMFT index. An increase in duration of GH therapy by 10 months leads to a mean increase in DMFT index by 0.70. Based on multiple regression analysis, we developed the following model: value of DT = 3.10 - 0.73∗category of vitamin D3 concentration - 0.07∗duration of supplementation (in months). In this model, variables with a significant impact on the value of DT in the group of patients from rural areas include time of vitamin D3 supplementation and category of vitamin D3 concentration.

The aim of this study was to investigate factors affecting the number of the adequate nodal yield in colorectal specimens subject to routine pathological assessment. We have retrospectively analysed the data of 2319 curatively resected colorectal cancer patients in San Raffaele Scientific Institute, Milan, between 1993 and 2017 (1259 colon cancer patients and 675 rectal cancer patients plus 385 rectal cancer patients who underwent neoadjuvant therapy). The factors influencing lymph node retrieval were subjected to uni- and multivariate analyses. Moreover, a survival analysis was carried out to verify the prognostic implications of nodal counts. The mean number of evaluated nodes was 24.08 ± 11.4, 20.34 ± 11.8, and 15.33 ± 9.64 in surgically treated right-sided colon cancer, left-sided colon cancer, and rectal tumors, respectively. More than 12 lymph nodes were reported in surgical specimens in 1094 (86.9%) cases in the colon cohort and in 425 (63%) cases in the rectal cohort, and patients who underwent neoadjuvant chemoradiation were analysed separately. On univariate analysis of the colon cancer group, higher LNs counts were associated with female sex, right colon cancer, emergency surgery, pT3-T4 diseases, higher tumor size, and resected specimen length. On multivariate analysis right colon tumors, larger mean size of tumor, length of specimen, pT3-T4 disease, and female sex were found to significantly affect lymph node retrieval. Colon cancer patients with 12 or more lymph nodes removed had a significantly better long-term survival than those with 11 or fewer nodes (P = 0.002, log-rank test). Rectal cancer patients with 12 or more lymph nodes removed approached but did not reach a statistically different survival (P = 0.055, log-rank test).

Parent involvement in early intervention programs seems to have positive psychosocial effects on both the child and parent. CareToy is an innovative smart system that provides an intensive individualized home-based family-centred EI in preterm infants between 3 and 9 age-corrected months. A RCT study, preceded by a pilot study, has been recently carried out to evaluate the effects of CareToy intervention on neurodevelopmental outcomes with respect to Standard Care. This study aims at evaluating the effects of CareToy early intervention on parenting stress in preterm infants. Parents (mother and father) of a subgroup of infants enrolled in the RCT filled out a self-report questionnaire on parenting stress (Parenting Stress Index-Short Form (PSI-SF)) before (T0) and after (T1) the CareToy or Standard Care period (4 weeks), according to the allocation of their preterm infant. For twins, an individual questionnaire for each one was filled out. Results obtained from mothers and fathers were separately analysed with nonparametric tests. 44 mothers and 44 fathers of 44 infants (24 CareToy/20 Standard Care) filled out the PSI-SF at T0 and at T1. CareToy intervention was mainly managed by mothers. A significant (p < 0.05) reduction in Parental Distress subscale in the CareToy group versus Standard Care was found in the mothers. No differences were found among the fathers. CareToy training seems to be effective in reducing parental distress in mothers, who spent more time on CareToy intervention. These findings confirm the importance of parental involvement in early intervention programs.

As a consequence, when administered in a favorable environment, SSRIs lead to a reduction of symptoms, but in stressful conditions, they show limited efficacy. Therefore, novel therapeutic approaches able to neutralize the influence of the stressful environment on treatment are needed. The aim of our study was to test whether, in a mouse model of depression, the combined administration of SSRI fluoxetine and metformin, a drug able to improve the metabolic profile, counteracts the limited efficacy of fluoxetine alone when administered in stressful conditions. Indeed, metabolic alterations are associated to both the onset of major depression and the antidepressant efficacy. To this goal, adult C57BL/6 male mice were exposed to stress for 6 weeks; the first two weeks was aimed at generating a mouse model of depression. During the remaining 4 weeks, mice received one of the following treatments: vehicle, fluoxetine, metformin, or a combination of fluoxetine and metformin. We measured liking- and wanting-type anhedonia as behavioral phenotypes of depression and assessed the expression levels of selected genes involved in major depressive disorder and antidepressant response in the dorsal and ventral hippocampus, which are differently involved in the depressive symptomatology. The combined treatment was more effective than fluoxetine alone in ameliorating the depressive phenotype after one week of treatment. This was associated to an increase in IGF2 mRNA expression and enhanced long-term potentiation, specifically in the dorsal hippocampus, at the end of treatment. Overall, the present results show that, when administered in stressful conditions, the combined fluoxetine and metformin treatment may represent a more effective approach than fluoxetine alone in a short term. Finally, our findings highlight the relevance of polypharmacological strategy as effective interventions to increase the efficacy of the antidepressant drugs currently available.",Immune Challenge Alters Reactivity of Hippocampal Noradrenergic System in Prenatally Stressed Aged Mice.,https://www.ncbi.nlm.nih.gov/pubmed/30804990,Neural plasticity,2019 05 13,Prenatal stress (PS) has long-term sequelae for the morphological and functional status of the central nervous system of the progeny. A PS-induced proinflammatory status of the organism may result in an impairment of both hippocampal synaptic plasticity and hippocampus-dependent memory formation in adults. We addressed here the question of how PS-induced alterations in the immune response in young and old mice may contribute to changes in hippocampal function in aging. Immune stimulation (via LPS injection) significantly affected the ability of the hippocampal CA3-CA1 synapse of PS mice to undergo long-term potentiation (LTP). Elevated corticosterone level in the blood of aged PS mice that is known to influence LTP magnitude indicates a chronic activation of the HPA axis due to the in utero stress exposure. We investigated the contribution of adrenergic receptors to the modulation of hippocampal synaptic plasticity of aged mice and found that impaired LTP in the PS-LPS group was indeed rescued by application of isoproterenol (a nonspecific noradrenergic agonist). Further exploration of the mechanisms of the observed phenomena will add to our understanding of the interaction between PS and proinflammatory immune activation and its contribution to the functional and structural integrity of the aging brain.,Electronic-Sports Experience Related to Functional Enhancement in Central Executive and Default Mode Areas.,https://www.ncbi.nlm.nih.gov/pubmed/30804989,Neural plasticity,2019 05 13,"Electronic-sports (e-sports) is a form of organized, online, multiplayer video game competition, which requires both action skills and the ability and process of forming and adapting a strategy (referred to as strategization hereafter) to achieve goals. Over the past few decades, research has shown that video gaming experience has an important impact on the plasticity of the sensorimotor, attentional, and executive brain areas. However, little research has examined the relationship between e-sports experience and the plasticity of brain networks that are related to strategization. Using resting-state fMRI data and the local functional connectivity density (lFCD) analysis, this study investigated the relationship between e-sports experience (League of Legends [LOL] in this study) and brain plasticity by comparing between top-ranking LOL players and lower-ranking (yet experienced) LOL players. Results showed that the top-ranking LOL players had superior local functional integration in the executive areas compared to lower-ranking players. Furthermore, the top-ranking players had higher lFCD in the default mode areas, which have been found related to various subprocesses (e.g., memory and planning) essential for strategization. Finally, the top-ranking players' lFCD was related to their LOL expertise rank level, as indicated by a comprehensive score assigned by the gaming software based on players' gaming experience and expertise. Thus, the result showed that the local functional connectivity in central executive and default mode brain areas was enhanced in the top-ranking e-sports players, suggesting that e-sports experience is related to the plasticity of the central executive and default mode areas.",Motor Imagery EEG Classification Based on Decision Tree Framework and Riemannian Geometry.,https://www.ncbi.nlm.nih.gov/pubmed/30804988,Computational intelligence and neuroscience,2019 04 12,"This paper proposes a novel classification framework and a novel data reduction method to distinguish multiclass motor imagery (MI) electroencephalography (EEG) for brain computer interface (BCI) based on the manifold of covariance matrices in a Riemannian perspective. For method 1, a subject-specific decision tree (SSDT) framework with filter geodesic minimum distance to Riemannian mean (FGMDRM) is designed to identify MI tasks and reduce the classification error in the nonseparable region of FGMDRM. Method 2 includes a feature extraction algorithm and a classification algorithm. The feature extraction algorithm combines semisupervised joint mutual information (semi-JMI) with general discriminate analysis (GDA), namely, SJGDA, to reduce the dimension of vectors in the Riemannian tangent plane. And the classification algorithm replaces the FGMDRM in method 1 with k-nearest neighbor (KNN), named SSDT-KNN. By applying method 2 on BCI competition IV dataset 2a, the kappa value has been improved from 0.57 to 0.607 compared to the winner of dataset 2a. And method 2 also obtains high recognition rate on the other two datasets.","Identification of Candidate Genes for the Plateau Adaptation of a Tibetan Amphipod, Gammarus lacustris, Through Integration of Genome and Transcriptome Sequencing.",https://www.ncbi.nlm.nih.gov/pubmed/30804987,Frontiers in genetics,2019 02 27,"The amphipod Gammarus lacustris has been distributing in the Tibetan region with well-known uplifts of the Tibetan plateau. It is hence considered as a good model for investigating stress adaptations of the plateau. Here, we sequenced the whole-genome and full-length transcriptome of G. lacustris, and compared the transcriptome results with its counterpart Gammarus pisinnus from a nearby plain. Our main goal was to provide a genomic resource for investigation of genetic mechanisms, by which G. lacustris adapted to living on the plateau. The final draft genome assembly of G. lacustris was 5.07 gigabases (Gb), and it contained 443,304 scaffolds (>2 kb) with an N50 of 2,578 bp. A total of 8,858 unigenes were predicted in the full-length transcriptome of G. lacustris, with an average gene length of 1,811 bp. Compared with the G. pisinnus transcriptome, 2,672 differentially expressed genes (DEGs) were up-regulated and 2,881 DEGs were down-regulated in the G. lacustris transcriptome. Along with these critical DEGs, several enriched metabolic pathways, such as oxidative phosphorylation, ribosome, cell energy homeostasis, glycolysis and gluconeogenesis, were predicted to play essential roles in the plateau adaptation. In summary, the present study provides a genomic basis for understanding the plateau adaption of G. lacustris, which lays a fundamental basis for further biological and ecological studies on other resident aquatic species in the Tibetan plateau."

It is especially frequent in hybrids and very valuable in many crops. The genus Annona belongs to the Annonaceae, a family that includes several fruit tree crops, such as cherimoya (Annona cherimola), sugar apple (Annona squamosa), their hybrid atemoya (A. cherimola × A. squamosa) or pawpaw (Asimina triloba). In this work, genome content was evaluated in several Annona species, A. triloba and atemoya. Surprisingly, while the hybrid atemoya has been reported as diploid, flow cytometry analysis of a progeny obtained from an interspecific cross between A. cherimola and A. squamosa showed an unusual ploidy variability that was also confirmed karyotype analysis. While the progeny from intraspecific crosses of A. cherimola showed polyploid genotypes that ranged from 2.5 to 33%, the hybrid atemoyas from the interspecific cross showed 35% of triploids from a total of 186 genotypes analyzed. With the aim of understanding the possible implications of the production of non-reduced gametes, pollen performance, pollen size and frequency distribution of pollen grains was quantified in the progeny of this cross and the parents. A large polymorphism in pollen grain size was found within the interspecific progeny with higher production of unreduced pollen in triploids (38%) than in diploids (29%). Moreover, using PCR amplification of selected microsatellite loci, while 13.7% of the pollen grains from the diploids showed two alleles, 41.28% of the grains from the triploids amplified two alleles and 5.63% showed up to three alleles. This suggests that the larger pollen grains could correspond to diploid and, in a lower frequency, to triploid pollen. Pollen performance was also affected with lower pollen germination in the hybrid triploids than in both diploid parents. The results confirm a higher percentage of polyploids in the interspecific cross, affecting pollen grain size and pollen performance. The occurrence of unreduced gametes in A. cherimola, A. squamosa and their interspecific progeny that may result in abnormalities of ploidy such as the triploids and tetraploids observed in this study, opens an interesting opportunity to study polyploidy in Annonaceae.",River Regulation Causes Rapid Changes in Relationships Between Floodplain Oak Growth and Environmental Variables.,https://www.ncbi.nlm.nih.gov/pubmed/30804967,Frontiers in plant science,2019 02 27,"The radial growth of pedunculate oak (Quercus robur), a species often ecologically dominating European deciduous forests, is closely tied up with local environmental variables. The oak tree-ring series usually contain a climatic and hydrologic signal that allows assessing the main drivers of tree growth in various ecosystems. Understanding the climate-growth relationship patterns in floodplains is important for providing insights into the species persistence and longevity in vulnerable riverine ecosystems experiencing human-induced hydrology alteration. Here, we use 139 years long instrumental records of local temperature, precipitation, and water levels in the Dnipro River in Kyiv to demonstrate that the implementation of river regulation has decoupled the established relationship between the radial growth of floodplain oak and local hydro-climatic conditions. Before the river flow has been altered by engineering modifications of 1965-1977, the water level in the Dnipro River was the key driver of oak radial growth, as reflected in the tree-ring width and earlywood width. The construction of two dams has altered the seasonal distribution of water level diminishing the positive effect of high water on oak growth and subsequently reversing this trend to negative, resulting from a seasonal ground water surplus. The decrease in the correlation between oak growth indices and the river's water level in April-June was unprecedentedly rapid and clearly distinguishable among other changes in the growth-to-climate relationship. Our findings further demonstrate that trees growing in areas exposed to urban development are the most susceptible to downside effects of river regulation.",Crossbreeding East African Highland Bananas: Lessons Learnt Relevant to the Botany of the Crop After 21 Years of Genetic Enhancement.,https://www.ncbi.nlm.nih.gov/pubmed/30804965,Frontiers in plant science,2019 02 27,"East African highland bananas (EAHB) were regarded as sterile. Their screening for female fertility with ""Calcutta 4"" as male parent revealed that 37 EAHB were fertile. This was the foundation for the establishment of the EAHB crossbreeding programs by the International Institute of Tropical Agriculture (IITA) and the National Agricultural Research Organization (NARO) in Uganda in the mid-1990s. The aim of this study was to assess the progress and efficiency of the EAHB breeding program at IITA, Sendusu in Uganda. Data on pollinations, seeds generated and germinated, plus hybrids selected between 1995 and 2015 were analyzed. Pollination success and seed germination percentages for different cross combinations were calculated. The month of pollination did not result in significantly different (P = 0.501) pollination success. Musa acuminata subsp. malaccensis accession 250 had the highest pollination success (66.8%), followed by the cultivar ""Rose"" (66.6%) among the diploid males. Twenty-five EAHB out of 41 studied for female fertility produced up to 305 seeds per pollinated bunch, and were therefore deemed fertile. The percentage of seed germination varied among crosses: 26% for 2x × 4x, 23% for 2x × 2x, 11% for 3x × 2x, and 7% for 4x × 2x. Twenty-seven NARITA hybrids (mostly secondary triploids ensuing from the 4x × 2x) were selected for further evaluation in the East African region. One so far -""NARITA 7""- was officially released to farmers in Uganda. Although pollination of EAHB can be conducted throughout the year, the seed set and germination is low. Thus, further research on pollination conditions and optimization of embryo culture protocols should be done to boost seed set and embryo germination, respectively. More research in floral biology and seed germination as well as other breeding strategies are required to increase the efficiency of the EAHB breeding program.",Roots and Nodules Response Differently to P Starvation in the Mediterranean-Type Legume Virgilia divaricata.,https://www.ncbi.nlm.nih.gov/pubmed/30804964,Frontiers in plant science,2019 02 27,"Virgilia divaricata is a tree legume that grows in the Cape Floristic Region (CFA) in poor nutrient soils. A comparison between high and low phosphate growth conditions between roots and nodules was conducted and evaluated for the plants ability to cope under low phosphate stress conditions in V. divaricata. We proved that the plant copes with low phosphate stress through an increased allocation of resources, reliance on BNF and enhanced enzyme activity, especially PEPC. Nodules had a lower percentage decline in P compared to roots to uphold its metabolic functions. These strategies partly explain how V. divaricata can sustain growth despite LP conditions. Although the number of nodules declined with LP, their biomass remained unchanged in spite of a plant decline in dry weight. This is achieved via the high efficiency of BNF under P stress. During LP, nodules had a lower % decline at 34% compared to the roots at 88%. We attribute this behavior to P conservation strategies in LP nodules that imply an increase in a metabolic bypass that operates at the PEP branch point in glycolysis. The enhanced activities of nodule PEPC, MDH, and ME, whilst PK declines, suggests that under LP conditions an adenylate bypass was in operation either to synthesize more organic acids or to mediate pyruvate via a non-adenylate requiring metabolic route. Both possibilities represent a P-stress adaptation route and this is the first report of its kind for legume trees that are indigenous to low P, acid soils. Although BNF declined by a small percentage during LP, this P conservation was evident in the unchanged BNF efficiency per weight, and the increase in BNF efficiency per mol of P. It appears that legumes that are indigenous to acid soils, may be able to continue their reliance on BNF via increased allocation to nodules and also due to increase their efficiency for BNF on a P basis, owing to P-saving mechanisms such as the organic acid routes.",Fine-Tuning Stomatal Movement Through Small Signaling Peptides.,https://www.ncbi.nlm.nih.gov/pubmed/30804962,Frontiers in plant science,2019 02 27,"As sessile organisms, plants are continuously exposed to a wide range of environmental stress. In addition to their crucial roles in plant growth and development, small signaling peptides are also implicated in sensing environmental stimuli. Notably, recent studies in plants have revealed that small signaling peptides are actively involved in controlling stomatal aperture to defend against biotic and abiotic stress. This review illustrates our growing knowledge of small signaling peptides in the modulation of stomatal aperture and highlights future challenges to decipher peptide signaling pathways in guard cells.",DNA Metabarcoding Authentication of Ayurvedic Herbal Products on the European Market Raises Concerns of Quality and Fidelity.,https://www.ncbi.nlm.nih.gov/pubmed/30804961,Frontiers in plant science,2019 02 27,"Ayurveda is one of the oldest systems of medicine in the world, but the growing commercial interest in Ayurveda based products has increased the incentive for adulteration and substitution within this herbal market. Fraudulent practices such as the use of undeclared fillers and use of other species of inferior quality is driven both by the increased as well as insufficient supply capacity of especially wild plant species. Developing novel strategies to exhaustively assess and monitor both the quality of raw materials and final marketed herbal products is a challenge in herbal pharmacovigilance. Seventy-nine Ayurvedic herbal products sold as tablets, capsules, powders, and extracts were randomly purchased via e-commerce and pharmacies across Europe, and DNA metabarcoding was used to assess the ability of this method to authenticate these products. Our analysis reveals that only two out of 12 single ingredient products contained only one species as labeled, eight out of 27 multiple ingredient products contained none of the species listed on the label, and the remaining 19 products contained 1 to 5 of the species listed on the label along with many other species not specified on the label. The fidelity for single ingredient products was 67%, the overall ingredient fidelity for multi ingredient products was 21%, and for all products 24%. The low level of fidelity raises concerns about the reliability of the products, and detection of threatened species raises further concerns about illegal plant trade. The study highlights the necessity for quality control of the marketed herbal products and shows that DNA metabarcoding is an effective analytical approach to authenticate complex multi ingredient herbal products. However, effort needs to be done to standardize the protocols for DNA metabarcoding before this approach can be implemented as routine analytical approaches for plant identification, and approved for use in regulated procedures.","Function of Brassica napus BnABI3 in Arabidopsis gs1, an Allele of AtABI3, in Seed Development and Stress Response.",https://www.ncbi.nlm.nih.gov/pubmed/30804960,Frontiers in plant science,2019 02 27,"Abscisic acid (ABA) has been implicated in plant adaptation to various environmental stresses in addition to the regulation of seed dormancy and leaf senescence. ABI3 is a B3 domain-containing family protein and functions in the ABA signaling pathway during seed development. To date, the ABI3 orthologous have not been studied in Brassica napus. The aim of this study is to investigate the function of BnABI3 in plant development and stress response. Here, we identified an Arabidopsis line (gs1) from a population of mutagenized seeds and showed that GS1 is a new allele of AtABI3. When the Arabidopsis gs1 mutant was transformed with the BnABI3 gene, the transformed plants produced seeds that turned yellow and acquired desiccation tolerance. Moreover, BnABI3 regulates seed coat development and mucilage secretion by directly targeting the AtMUM1 and AtGATL5 genes. In addition, we showed that BnABI3 expression rescued gs1 freezing-induced green seed coloration by targeting AtSGR1/2 in transgenic Arabidopsis. BnABI3 is also involved in lateral root development and conferred a novel interaction between ABA and auxin signaling in roots. The potential role of ABI3 protein in endoplasmic reticulum homoeostasis was also tested. Altogether, our results indicated that BnABI3 mediates both plant development and the stress response.","Association Study Reveals Genetic Loci Responsible for Arsenic, Cadmium and Lead Accumulation in Rice Grain in Contaminated Farmlands.",https://www.ncbi.nlm.nih.gov/pubmed/30804959,Frontiers in plant science,2019 02 27,"Accumulation of toxic heavy metals and metalloids (THMMs) in crop grain remarkably affects food safety and human health. Reducing the content of THMMs in grain requires the identification and manipulation of the genes regulating their accumulation. This study aimed to determine the genetic variations affecting grain THMM accumulation in rice by using association mapping. We used 276 accessions with 416 K single nucleotide polymorphisms (SNPs) and performed genome-wide association analysis of grain THMM concentrations in rice grown in heavily multi-contaminated farmlands. We detected 22, 17, and 21 quantitative trait loci (QTLs) for grain arsenic, cadmium, and lead concentrations, respectively. Both inter- and intra-subpopulation variants accounted for these QTLs. Most QTLs contained no known THMM-related genes and represented unidentified novel genes. We examined the candidate genes in qGAS1, a QTL for grain arsenic concentration with the best P-value detected for the entire population. We speculated that a transport protein of the multidrug and toxin extrusion family could be the candidate gene for this QTL. Our study suggested that the genetic regulation of grain THMM accumulation is very complex and largely unknown. The QTLs and SNPs identified in this study might help in the identification of new genes regulating THMM accumulation and aid in marker-assisted breeding of rice with low grain THMM content.",Foliar Application of Vegetal-Derived Bioactive Compounds Stimulates the Growth of Beneficial Bacteria and Enhances Microbiome Biodiversity in Lettuce.,https://www.ncbi.nlm.nih.gov/pubmed/30804958,Frontiers in plant science,2019 02 27,"Many studies on plant biostimulants and organic fertilizers have been focused on the ability of these products to increase crop productivity and ameliorate crop tolerance to abiotic stresses. However, little information is available on their effect on plant microbiota, whereas it is well known that microorganisms associated with plant play crucial roles on the health and productivity of their host. The aim of this study was to evaluate the effect of a vegetal-derived protein hydrolysate (PH), a vegetal-derived PH enriched with copper (Cu-PH), and a tropical plant extract enriched with micronutrients (PE) on shoot growth and the epiphytic bacterial population of lettuce plants and the ability of these products to enhance the growth of beneficial or harmful bacteria. The three plant-derived products enhanced shoot biomass of lettuce plants indicating a biostimulant effect of the products. Data obtained using culture-independent (Terminal Restriction Fragment Length Polymorphism and Next Generation Sequencing) and culture-dependent approaches indicated that foliar application of commercial products altered the composition of the microbial population and stimulated the growth of specific bacteria belonging to Pantoea, Pseudomonas, Acinetobacter, and Bacillus genus. Data presented in this work demonstrated that some of these strains exhibited potential plant growth-promoting properties and/or biocontrol activity against fungi and bacteria phytopathogens including Fusarium, Trichoderma, and Erwinia species. No indication of potential health risks associated to the enrichment of human or plant bacterial pathogens emerged by the analysis of the microbiota of treated and no-treated plants. Overall, the findings presented in this study indicate that the commercial organic-based products can enhance the growth of beneficial bacteria occurring in the plant microbiota and signals produced by these bacteria can act synergistically with the organic compounds to enhance plant growth and productivity.",Elastic and Irreversible Bending of Tree and Shrub Branches Under Cantilever Loads.,https://www.ncbi.nlm.nih.gov/pubmed/30804957,Frontiers in plant science,2019 02 27,"Tree and shrub branches subjected to cantilever loads such as intercepted snowfall undergo, in addition to the familiar instantaneous elastic bending, a conspicuous retarded-elastic bending, which is commonly 30-50% of their instantaneous bending and occasionally even more. The resultant bending creep that occurs after loading also often includes a slow, time-dependent irreversible bending. These phenomena occur quite generally among woody plants of different major biomes, taxonomic groups, and structural types. We give some of branch bending viscoelasticity's basic physical properties such as load dependence and stress relaxation. These properties belong to the secondary walls of branches' xylem (wood) cells; some properties differ notably from those reported for primary cell walls, a difference for which we propose explanations. A method for separating the overlapping time courses of retarded-elastic and time-dependent irreversible bending shows that multiple retarded-elastic (""Kelvin"") elements of branches span a wide range of retardation times (a retardation spectrum, approximate examples of which we calculate), and that irreversible bending can occur in different cases either only in the first few h after loading, or more extensively through 24 h, or (rarely) for several days. A separate time-independent irreversible bending, permanent set, involving a substantial yield stress, also occurs. In three species of shrubs rapid irreversible bending began only several (up to 24) h after loading, implying an unusual kind of viscoelasticity. Deductions from the dynamics of bending suggest that retarded elasticity can help protect branches against breakage by wind gusts during storms. Irreversible bending probably contributes both to the form that tree and shrub crowns develop over the long term, involving progressive increase in the downward curvature and/or inclination of branches, and also to certain other, more specialized, developmental changes."

During pregnancy, maternal immune cells are in close contact to cells of the semi-allogeneic fetus. Dysregulation of the maternal immune system leading to defective adaptation to pregnancy often plays a role in pathogenesis of abortions. Myeloid-derived suppressor cells (MDSC) are myeloid cells that suppress functions of other immune cells, especially T-cells, thereby negatively affecting diseases such as cancer, sepsis or trauma. They seem, however, also necessary for maintenance of maternal-fetal tolerance. Mechanisms regulating MDSC expansion and function during pregnancy are only incompletely understood. In tumor environment, hypoxia is crucial for MDSC accumulation and activation. Hypoxia is also important for early placenta and embryo development. Effects of hypoxia are mediated through hypoxia-inducible factor 1α (HIF-1α). In the present study we aimed to examine the role of HIF-1α in myeloid cells for MDSC accumulation and MDSC function during pregnancy and for pregnancy outcome. We therefore used a mouse model with targeted deletion of HIF-1α in myeloid cells (myeloid HIF-KO) and analyzed blood, spleens and uteri of pregnant mice at gestational day E 10.5 in comparison to non-pregnant animals and wildtype (WT) animals. Further we analyzed pregnancy success by determining rates of failed implantation and abortion in WT and myeloid HIF-KO animals. We found that myeloid HIF-KO in mice led to an abrogated MDSC accumulation in the pregnant uterus and to impaired suppressive activity of MDSC. While expression of chemokine receptors and integrins on MDSC was not affected by HIF-1α, myeloid HIF-KO led to increased apoptosis rates of MDSC in the uterus. Myeloid-HIF-KO resulted in increased proportions of non-pregnant animals after positive vaginal plug and increased abortion rates, suggesting that activation of HIF-1α dependent pathways in MDSC are important for maintenance of pregnancy.",Comparative Study of Immune Reaction Against Bacterial Infection From Transcriptome Analysis.,https://www.ncbi.nlm.nih.gov/pubmed/30804945,Frontiers in immunology,2019 02 27,"Transcriptome analysis is a powerful tool that enables a deep understanding of complicated physiological pathways, including immune responses. RNA sequencing (RNA-Seq)-based transcriptome analysis and various bioinformatics tools have also been used to study non-model animals, including aquaculture species for which reference genomes are not available. Rapid developments in these techniques have not only accelerated investigations into the process of pathogenic infection and defense strategies in fish, but also used to identify immunity-related genes in fish. These findings will contribute to fish immunotherapy for the prevention and treatment of bacterial infections through the design of more specific and effective immune stimulants, adjuvants, and vaccines. Until now, there has been little information regarding the universality and diversity of immune reactions against pathogenic infection in fish. Therefore, one of the aims of this paper is to introduce the RNA-Seq technique for examination of immune responses in pathogen-infected fish. This review also aims to highlight comparative studies of immune responses against bacteria, based on our previous findings in largemouth bass (Micropterus salmoides) against Nocardia seriolae, gray mullet (Mugil cephalus) against Lactococcus garvieae, orange-spotted grouper (Epinephelus coioides) against Vibrio harveyi, and koi carp (Cyprinus carpio) against Aeromonas sobria, using RNA-seq techniques. We demonstrated that only 39 differentially expressed genes (DEGs) were present in all species. However, the number of specific DEGs in each species was relatively higher than that of common DEGs; 493 DEGs in largemouth bass against N. seriolae, 819 DEGs in mullets against L. garvieae, 909 in groupers against V. harveyi, and 1471 in carps against A. sobria. The DEGs in different fish species were also representative of specific immune-related pathways. The results of this study will enhance our understanding of the immune responses of fish, and will aid in the development of effective vaccines, therapies, and disease-resistant strains.",The Value of a Rapid Test of Human Regulatory T Cell Function Needs to be Revised.,https://www.ncbi.nlm.nih.gov/pubmed/30804944,Frontiers in immunology,2019 02 27,"CD4+CD25+FoxP3+ human regulatory TCELLS (TREG) are promising candidates for reshaping undesired immunity/inflammation by adoptive cell transfer, yet their application is strongly dependent on robust assays testing their functionality. Several studies along with first clinical data indicate TREG to be auspicious to use for future cell therapies, e.g., to induce tolerance after solid organ transplantation. To this end, TREG suppressive capacity has to be thoroughly evaluated prior to any therapeutic application. A 7 h-protocol for the assessment of TREG function by suppression of the early activation markers CD154 and CD69 on CD4+CD25- responder TCELLS (TRESP) upon polyclonal stimulation via αCD3/28-coated activating microbeads has previously been published. Even though this assay has since been applied by various groups, the protocol comes with a critical pitfall, which is yet not corrected by the journal of its original publication. Our results demonstrate that the observed decrease in activation marker frequency on TRESP is due to competition for αCD3/28-coated microbeads as opposed to a TREG-attributable effect and therefore the protocol cannot further be used as a diagnostic test to assess suppressive TREG function.",Transcriptome Profile in Hippocampus During Acute Inflammatory Response to Surgery: Toward Early Stage of PND.,https://www.ncbi.nlm.nih.gov/pubmed/30804943,Frontiers in immunology,2019 02 27,"Perioperative neurocognitive disorders (PND) are common complications observed in surgical patients, but there are no effective treatments and the detailed mechanisms remain largely unknown. In this study, transcriptome analysis was performed to investigate the hippocampal changes after surgery and underlying molecular mechanisms of PND. Tibial fracture surgery was performed in 3-4 months old C57BL/6J mice to mimic human orthopedic surgery. We demonstrated that memory consolidation of the hippocampal-dependent trace-fear conditioning task was significantly impaired. By using ELISA, a significant elevated IL-6 was observed both in circulating system and central nervous system and peaked at 6 h post-surgery, but transiently returned to baseline thereafter. Hippocampus were collected at 6 h post-surgery then processed for RNA-Seq. A total of 268 genes were screened differentially expressed between the Surgery and Control group, including 170 up-regulated genes and 98 down-regulated genes. By functional enrichment analysis of differently expressed genes, several KEGG pathways involved in inflammatory mediator regulation of TRP channels, neuroactive ligand-receptor interaction and cholinergic synapse were overrepresented. Quantitative real-time PCR confirmed 15 dysregulated genes of interest. These results provide a comprehensive insight into global gene expression changes during the acute presence of hippocampal inflammation and a better understanding on early stage of PND.",Advances in Research on Immunoregulation of Macrophages by Plant Polysaccharides.,https://www.ncbi.nlm.nih.gov/pubmed/30804942,Frontiers in immunology,2019 02 27,"Polysaccharides are among the most important members of the biopolymer family. They are natural macromolecules composed of monosaccharides. To date, more than 300 kinds of natural polysaccharide compounds have been identified. They are present in plants, animals, and microorganisms, and they engage in a variety of physiological functions. In the 1950s, due to the discovery of their immunoregulatory and anti-tumor activities, polysaccharides became a popular topic of research in pharmacology, especially in immunopharmacology. Plants are an important source of natural polysaccharides. Pharmacological and clinical studies have shown that plant polysaccharides have many functions, such as immune regulation, anti-tumor activity, anti-inflammatory activity, anti-viral functions, anti-radiation functions, and a hypoglycaemic effect. The immunomodulatory effects of plant polysaccharides have received much attention. Polysaccharides with these effects are also referred to as biological response modifiers (BRMs), and research on them is one of the most active areas of polysaccharide research. Thus, we summarize immunomodulatory effects of botanical polysaccharides isolated from different species of plants on the macrophage. The primary effect of botanical polysaccharides is to enhance and/or activate macrophage immune responses, including increasing reactive oxygen species (ROS) production, and enhancing secretion of cytokines and chemokines. Therefore, it is believed that botanical polysaccharides have significant therapeutic potential, and represent a new method for discovery and development of novel immunomodulatory medicine.",Comparative Assessment of Aspergillosis by Virtual Infection Modeling in Murine and Human Lung.,https://www.ncbi.nlm.nih.gov/pubmed/30804941,Frontiers in immunology,2019 02 27,"Aspergillus fumigatus is a ubiquitous opportunistic fungal pathogen that can cause severe infections in immunocompromised patients. Conidia that reach the lower respiratory tract are confronted with alveolar macrophages, which are the resident phagocytic cells, constituting the first line of defense. If not efficiently removed in time, A. fumigatus conidia can germinate causing severe infections associated with high mortality rates. Mice are the most extensively used model organism in research on A. fumigatus infections. However, in addition to structural differences in the lung physiology of mice and the human host, applied infection doses in animal experiments are typically orders of magnitude larger compared to the daily inhalation doses of humans. The influence of these factors, which must be taken into account in a quantitative comparison and knowledge transfer from mice to humans, is difficult to measure since in vivo live cell imaging of the infection dynamics under physiological conditions is currently not possible. In the present study, we compare A. fumigatus infection in mice and humans by virtual infection modeling using a hybrid agent-based model that accounts for the respective lung physiology and the impact of a wide range of infection doses on the spatial infection dynamics. Our computer simulations enable comparative quantification of A. fumigatus infection clearance in the two hosts to elucidate (i) the complex interplay between alveolar morphometry and the fungal burden and (ii) the dynamics of infection clearance, which for realistic fungal burdens is found to be more efficiently realized in mice compared to humans.",Immune Responses to the Sexual Stages of Plasmodium falciparum Parasites.,https://www.ncbi.nlm.nih.gov/pubmed/30804940,Frontiers in immunology,2019 02 28,"Malaria infections remain a serious global health problem in the world, particularly among children and pregnant women in Sub-Saharan Africa.

Therefore, vaccine-based strategies are sorely needed, including those designed to interrupt disease transmission. However, a prerequisite for such a vaccine strategy is the understanding of both the human and vector immune responses to parasite developmental stages involved in parasite transmission in both man and mosquito. Here, we review the naturally acquired humoral and cellular responses to sexual stages of the parasite while in the human host and the Anopheles vector. In addition, updates on current anti-gametocyte, anti-gamete, and anti-mosquito transmission blocking vaccines are given. We conclude with our views on some important future directions of research into P. falciparum sexual stage immunity relevant to the search for the most appropriate transmission-blocking vaccine.","CAR T Cells for Solid Tumors: New Strategies for Finding, Infiltrating, and Surviving in the Tumor Microenvironment.",https://www.ncbi.nlm.nih.gov/pubmed/30804938,Frontiers in immunology,2019 02 27,"Chimeric antigen receptor (CAR) T cells, T cells that have been genetically engineered to express a receptor that recognizes a specific antigen, have given rise to breakthroughs in treating hematological malignancies. However, their success in treating solid tumors has been limited. The unique challenges posed to CAR T cell therapy by solid tumors can be described in three steps: finding, entering, and surviving in the tumor. The use of dual CAR designs that recognize multiple antigens at once and local administration of CAR T cells are both strategies that have been used to overcome the hurdle of localization to the tumor. Additionally, the immunosuppressive tumor microenvironment has implications for T cell function in terms of differentiation and exhaustion, and combining CARs with checkpoint blockade or depletion of other suppressive factors in the microenvironment has shown very promising results to mitigate the phenomenon of T cell exhaustion. Finally, identifying and overcoming mechanisms associated with dysfunction in CAR T cells is of vital importance to generating CAR T cells that can proliferate and successfully eliminate tumor cells. The structure and costimulatory domains chosen for the CAR may play an important role in the overall function of CAR T cells in the TME, and ""armored"" CARs that secrete cytokines and third- and fourth-generation CARs with multiple costimulatory domains offer ways to enhance CAR T cell function.","The Frequencies of Immunosuppressive Cells in Adipose Tissue Differ in Human, Non-human Primate, and Mouse Models.",https://www.ncbi.nlm.nih.gov/pubmed/30804937,Frontiers in immunology,2019 02 27,"Although the metabolic properties of white adipose tissue have been extensively characterized, the tissue's immune properties are now attracting renewed interest. Early experiments in a mouse model suggested that white adipose tissue contains a high density of regulatory T cells (Tregs), and so it was assumed that all adipose tissue has an immunosuppressive profile-even though the investigation was limited to visceral body fat in relatively old male mice. This observation was also corroborated by high frequencies of other cell subsets with immunoregulatory properties, such as anti-inflammatory M2 macrophages, and regulatory B cells. Many studies have since evidenced the persistence of pathogens (trypanosomes, Mycobacterium tuberculosis, HIV, etc.) in adipose tissue. However, a recent report identified adipose tissue as a reservoir of memory T cells capable of protecting animals upon rechallenge. The immune potential of lean adipose tissue thus remains to be further investigated. Here, we compared the relative proportions of immune cells (and Tregs in particular) in lean adipose tissue collected from humans, a non-human primate (the cynomolgus macaque), and three mouse models. We demonstrated that the proportion of Foxp3+ Tregs in visceral adipose tissue was low in all models other than the C57Bl/6 mouse. These low values were not linked to correspondingly low proportions of effector cells because T lymphocytes (a main target of Treg suppression) were more frequent in cynomolgus macaques than in C57Bl/6 mice and (to a lesser extent) humans. In contrast, the proportions of macrophages and B cells were lower in cynomolgus macaques than in C57Bl/6 mice. We also observed a higher proportion of CD34+CD45- cells (which predominantly correspond to mesenchymal stem cells) in C57Bl/6 mouse and cynomolgus macaques than in humans and both for subcutaneous and visceral adipose tissues. Lastly, a microscopy analysis confirmed predominant proportion of adipocytes within adipose tissue, and highlighted a marked difference in adipocyte size among the three species studied. In conclusion, our study of lean, middle-aged, male individuals showed that the immune compartment of adipose tissue differed markedly in humans vs. mice, and suggesting the presence of a more inflammatory steady-state profile in humans than mice.",Non-canonical Inflammasome-Mediated IL-1β Production by Primary Endometrial Epithelial and Stromal Fibroblast Cells Is NLRP3 and Caspase-4 Dependent.,https://www.ncbi.nlm.nih.gov/pubmed/30804935,Frontiers in immunology,2019 02 27,"Inflammation of the post-partum uterus is a normal physiological event, crucial for tissue involution and repair. However, in the bovine, some cows fail to resolve this inflammation, resulting in endometritis, which compromises fertility. Earlier work has identified upregulated expression of the potent inflammatory cytokine IL-1β early post-partum, in cows which subsequently develop endometritis. As a result, targeting IL-1β expression holds potential as a novel treatment for this disease, yet the regulatory mechanisms contributing to IL-1β expression in the bovine endometrium remain unknown. To investigate this, endometrial tissue samples were obtained 7 and 21 days post-partum (DPP) from cows that were diagnosed with endometritis at 21 DPP and cows that experienced a physiological level of inflammation throughout involution. IL-1β was measured by qPCR, ELISA, and immunohistochemistry. Seven DPP, endometrial IL-1β protein levels were significantly higher in animals that proceeded to develop endometritis at 21 DPP. IL-1β production could be detected in luminal and glandular epithelium, in underlying stromal fibroblasts as well as infiltrating immune cells. To investigate the mechanisms regulating IL-1β expression, primary endometrial epithelial cells, stromal fibroblasts and PBMCs were stimulated with LPS and the inflammasome activator nigericin. Stromal fibroblast cells were particularly potent producers of IL-1β. Basolateral LPS stimulation of polarized epithelial cells induced IL1B mRNA and a previously undescribed IL-1β protein isoform, with preferential protein secretion into the apical compartment. Key inflammasome components [nod-like receptor protein 3 (NLRP3), nima-related kinase-7 (NEK7), apoptosis speck like protein containing a CARD (ASC), and gasdermin-D] were expressed by endometrial cells following stimulation. Endometrial cell stimulation in the presence of NLRP3 receptor (MCC950) and pan-caspase (Z-VAD-FMK) inhibitors blocked IL-1β production, demonstrating its dependence on the NLRP3 inflammasome and on caspase activity. Furthermore, caspase-4 specific siRNA prevented IL-1β production, confirming that inflammasome activation in endometrial cells is caspase-4 but not caspase-1 dependent, as shown in other species. Identifying the tissue- and species-specificity of inflammasome assembly and activation has critical relevance for our understanding of inflammation and suggests new therapeutic targets to enhance the resolution of inflammatory pathologies including endometritis in cattle."

Mesenchymal stem/stromal cells from the umbilical cord tissue (UC-MSCs) have previously been proven to be immunomodulatory and more efficient than bone marrow-derived MSCs in causing remission of local and systemic arthritic manifestations in vivo. Given the paracrine nature of UC-MSC activity, their application as active substances can be replaced by their secretome, thus avoiding allogeneic rejection and safety issues related to unwanted grafting. In this work, we aimed at demonstrating the viability of applying the 3D-primed UC-MSC secretome for the amelioration of arthritic signs. A proteomic analysis was performed to both, media conditioned by UC-MSC monolayer (CM2D) and 3D cultures (CM3D). The analysis of relevant trophic factors confirmed secretome profiles with very significant differences in terms of therapeutic potential. Whereas, CM3D was characterised by a prevailing expression of anti-inflammatory cytokines such as IL-10 and LIF, along with trophic factors involved in different mechanisms leading to tissue regeneration, such as PDGF-BB, FGF-2, I-309, SCF, and GM-CSF; CM2D presented relatively higher levels of IL-6, MCP-1, and IL-21, with recognised pro-inflammatory roles in joint disease and pleiotropic effects in the progression of rheumatoid arthritis (RA). Accordingly, different motogenic effects over mouse chondrocytes and distinct capacities of inducing glycosaminoglycan synthesis in vitro were observed between CM3D and CM2D. Finally, the evaluation of arthritic manifestations in vivo, using an adjuvant-induced model for arthritis (AIA), suggested a significantly higher therapeutic potential of CM3D over CM2D and even UC-MSCs. Histological analysis confirmed a faster remission of local and systemic arthritic manifestations of CM3D-treated animals. Overall, the results show that the use of UC-MSC CM3D is a viable and better strategy than direct UC-MSC administration for counteracting AIA-related signs. This strategy represents a novel MSC-based but nonetheless cell-free treatment for arthritic conditions such as those characterising RA.",Semen Microbiome Biogeography: An Analysis Based on a Chinese Population Study.,https://www.ncbi.nlm.nih.gov/pubmed/30804923,Frontiers in microbiology,2019 02 27,"Investigating inter-subject heterogeneity (or spatial distribution) of human semen microbiome diversity is of important significance. Theoretically, the spatial distribution of biodiversity constitutes the core of microbiome biogeography. Practically, the inter-subject heterogeneity is crucial for understanding the normal (healthy) flora of semen microbiotas as well as their possible changes associated with abnormal fertility. In this article, we analyze the scaling (changes) of semen microbiome diversity across individuals with DAR (diversity-area relationship) analysis, a recent extension to classic SAR (species-area relationship) law in biogeography and ecology. Specifically, the unit of ""area"" is individual subject, and the microbial diversity in seminal fluid of an individual (area) is assessed via metagenomic DNA sequencing technique and measured in the Hill numbers. The DAR models were then fitted to the accrued diversity across different number of individuals (area size). We further tested the difference in DAR parameters among the healthy, subnormal, and abnormal microbiome samples in terms of their fertility status based on a cross-sectional study of a Chinese cohort. Given that no statistically significant differences in the DAR parameters were detected among the three groups, we built unified DAR models for semen microbiome by combining the healthy, subnormal, and abnormal groups. The model parameters were used to (i) estimate the microbiome diversity scaling in a population (cohort), and construct the so-termed DAR profile; (ii) predict/construct the maximal accrual diversity (MAD) profile in a population; (iii) estimate the pair-wise diversity overlap (PDO) between two individuals and construct the PDO profile; (iv) assess the ratio of individual diversity to population (RIP) accrual diversity. The last item (RIP) is a new concept we propose in this study, which is essentially a ratio of local diversity to regional or global diversity (LRD/LGD), applicable to general biodiversity investigation beyond human microbiome.",Biogeographic Patterns and Assembly Mechanisms of Bacterial Communities Differ Between Habitat Generalists and Specialists Across Elevational Gradients.,https://www.ncbi.nlm.nih.gov/pubmed/30804920,Frontiers in microbiology,2019 02 27,"A core issue in microbial ecology is the need to elucidate the ecological processes and underlying mechanisms involved in microbial community assembly. However, the extent to which these mechanisms differ in importance based on traits of taxa with different niche breadth is poorly understood. Here, we used high-throughput sequencing to examine the relative importance of environmental selection and stochastic processes in shaping soil bacterial sub-communities with different niche breadth (including habitat generalists, specialists and other taxa) across elevational gradients on the subalpine slope of Mount Wutai, Northern China. Our findings suggested that the composition of soil bacterial communities differed significantly different among elevational gradients. According to the niche breadth index, 10.9% of OTUs were defined as habitat generalists (B-value >8.7) and 10.0% of OTUs were defined as habitat specialists (B-value <1.5). Generalists and specialists differed distinctly in diversity and biogeographic patterns across elevational gradients. Environmental selection (deterministic processes) and spatial factors (stochastic processes) seemed to determine the assembly and biogeography of habitat generalists. However, for specialists, deterministic processes strongly influenced the distribution, while stochastic processes were not at play. Environmental drivers for generalists and specialists differed, as did their importance. Elevation, total nitrogen and pH were the main factors determining habitat generalists, and soil water content, nitrate nitrogen and pH had the strongest impacts on specialists. Moreover, variation partitioning analysis revealed that environmental selection had a much greater impact on both generalists (17.7% of pure variance was explained) and specialists (3.6%) than spatial factors. However, generalists had a much stronger response to spatial factors (2.3%) than specialists (0.3%). More importantly, null models of β-diversity suggested that specialists deviated significantly from non-neutral assembly mechanisms (relative null deviation= 0.64-0.74) relative to generalists (0.16-0.65) (P < 0.05). These results indicate that generalists and specialists are governed by different assembly mechanisms and present distinct biogeographical patterns. The large proportion of unexplained variation in specialists (93.3%) implies that very complex assembly mechanisms exist in the assembly of specialists across elevational gradients on the subalpine slope of Mount Wutai. It is essential to understand the microbial community assembly at a more refined level, and to expand the current understanding of microbial ecological mechanisms.",Significant Differences in Bacterial and Potentially Pathogenic Communities Between Sympatric Hooded Crane and Greater White-Fronted Goose.,https://www.ncbi.nlm.nih.gov/pubmed/30804919,Frontiers in microbiology,2019 02 27,"The gut microbiota of vertebrates play a crucial role in shaping the health of their hosts. However, knowledge of the avian intestinal microbiota has arguably lagged behind that of many other vertebrates. Here, we examine the intestinal bacterial communities of the hooded crane and the greater white-fronted goose at the Shengjin Lake of China, using high-throughput sequencing (Illumina Mi-Seq), and infer the potential pathogens associated with each species. Intestinal bacterial alpha-diversity in the greater white-fronted goose was significantly higher than that in hooded crane. The intestinal bacterial community compositions were significantly different between the two hosts, suggesting that host interactions with specific communities might have profound implications. In addition, potential pathogens were detected in both guts of the two hosts, suggesting that these wild birds might be at risk of disease and probably spread infectious disease to other sympatric vertebrates. The gut of hooded crane carried more potential pathogens than that of the greater white-fronted goose. The potentially pathogenic community compositions were also significantly different between the two hosts, suggesting the divergence of potentially pathogenic communities between hooded crane, and greater white-fronted goose. Finally, bacterial and potentially pathogenic structures showed strong evidence of phylogenic clustering in both hosts, further demonstrating that each host was associated with preferential and defined bacterial and potentially pathogenic communities. Our results argue that more attention should be paid to investigate avian intestinal pathogens which might increase disease risks for conspecifics and other mixed species, and even poultry and human beings.",A Periplasmic Antimicrobial Peptide-Binding Protein Is Required for Stress Survival in Vibrio cholerae.,https://www.ncbi.nlm.nih.gov/pubmed/30804918,Frontiers in microbiology,2019 02 27,"Vibrio cholerae must sense and respond appropriately to stresses encountered in the aquatic environment and the human host. One stress encountered in both environments is exposure to antimicrobial peptides (AMPs), produced as a part of the innate immune response by all multicellular organisms. Previous transcriptomic analysis demonstrated that expression of Stress-inducible protein A (SipA) (VCA0732), a hypothetical protein, was highly induced by AMP exposure and was dependent on a specific uncharacterized two-component system. In order to better understand role of this protein in stress relief, we examined whether it shared any of the phenotypes reported for its homologs. SipA is required for survival in the presence of two other stressors, cadmium chloride and hydrogen peroxide, and it localizes to the bacterial periplasm, similar to its homologs. We also found that SipA physically interacts with OmpA. Importantly, we found that SipA binds AMPs in the bacterial periplasm. This suggests a model where SipA may act as a molecular chaperone, binding AMPs that enter the periplasm and delivering them to OmpA for removal from the cell. While El Tor V. cholerae strains lacking SipA do not show a survival defect in the presence of AMPs, we found that Classical sipA mutants are less able to survive in the presence of AMPs. This phenotype is likely masked in the El Tor background due to a functional lipid A modification system that increases AMP resistance in these strains. In summary, we have identified a protein that contributes to a novel mechanism of stress relief in V. cholerae.",Mechanistic Insight Into the Interaction Between Helicobacter pylori Urease Subunit α and Its Molecular Chaperone Hsp60.,https://www.ncbi.nlm.nih.gov/pubmed/30804917,Frontiers in microbiology,2019 02 27,"Helicobacter pylori is the etiologic agent in a variety of gastroduodenal diseases. As its key pathogenic factors, both urease and Hsp60 play important roles in the pathogenesis of H. pylori. Previous studies have suggested that there is close relationship between urease and Hsp60, which implied that Hsp60 may act as a chaperone in urease stabilization and assembly. However, how these two proteins interact remains unclear. In this study, the impact of Hsp60 on urease activity of H. pylori lysate was first detected to confirm the interaction between urease and Hsp60. Pull-down assays further indicated that Hsp60 could bind to UreA subunit but not UreB. Then, the 3D structure of Hsp60 was modeled using I-TASSER to simulate the binding complex with UreA by molecular docking. The results showed that UreA is a perfect fit for the cavity of Hsp60. Analysis of the resulting model demonstrated that at least seven residues of UreA, located on two interfaces, participate in the interaction. Site-directed mutagenesis of these potential residues showed reduced affinity with Hsp60 than the wild type UreA through surface plasmon resonance (SPR) experiments, and D68 appears to have an important role in the affinity. Further analysis also showed that mutation of E25 and K26 caused a more rapid association and dissociation than with wild UreA, implying that they have roles in stabilizing the interaction complex. These affinity comparisons suggested that the interfaces predicted by molecular docking are credible. Our study indicated a direct interaction between Hsp60 and urease and revealed the binding interfaces and key residues involved in the interaction. These results provide further evidence for the chaperone activity of Hsp60 toward urease and lay a foundation to better understand the maturation mechanism of urease in H. pylori.",Comparative Metagenomics and Network Analyses Provide Novel Insights Into the Scope and Distribution of β-Lactamase Homologs in the Environment.,https://www.ncbi.nlm.nih.gov/pubmed/30804916,Frontiers in microbiology,2019 02 27,"The β-lactams are the largest group of clinically applied antibiotics, and resistance to these is primarily associated with β-lactamases. There is increasing understanding that these enzymes are ubiquitous in natural environments and henceforth, elucidating the global diversity, distribution, and mobility of β-lactamase-encoding genes is crucial for holistically understanding resistance to these antibiotics. In this study, we screened 232 shotgun metagenomes from ten different environments against a custom-designed β-lactamase database, and subsequently analyzed β-lactamase homologs with a suite of bioinformatic platforms including cluster and network analyses. Three interrelated β-lactamase clusters encompassed all of the human and bovine feces metagenomes, while β-lactamases from soil, freshwater, glacier, marine, and wastewater grouped within a separate ""environmental"" cluster that displayed high levels of inter-network connectivity. Interestingly, almost no connectivity occurred between the ""feces"" and ""environmental"" clusters. We attributed this in part to the divergence in microbial community composition (dominance of Bacteroidetes and Firmicutes vs. Proteobacteria, respectively). The β-lactamase diversity in the ""environmental"" cluster was significantly higher than in human and bovine feces microbiomes. Several class A, B, C, and D β-lactamase homologs (blaCTX-M, blaKPC, blaGES) were ubiquitous in the ""environmental"" cluster, whereas bovine and human feces metagenomes were dominated by class A (primarily cfxA) β-lactamases. Collectively, this study highlights the ubiquitous presence and broad diversity of β-lactamase gene precursors in non-clinical environments. Furthermore, it suggests that horizontal transfer of β-lactamases to human-associated bacteria may be more plausible from animals than from terrestrial and aquatic microbes, seemingly due to phylogenetic similarities.",Reduction of HIV-1 Reservoir Size and Diversity After 1 Year of cART Among Brazilian Individuals Starting Treatment During Early Stages of Acute Infection.,https://www.ncbi.nlm.nih.gov/pubmed/30804915,Frontiers in microbiology,2019 02 27,"The aim of early combined antiretroviral therapy (cART) of HIV is to limit the seeding of the viral reservoir during the initial phase of infection and, consequently, decrease intrahost viral diversity. Here, we assessed the effect of early cART on size and complexity of the proviral reservoir. Peripheral blood mononuclear cell (PBMC) and plasma samples were obtained from ten HIV-infected Brazilian individuals diagnosed at the acute phase of infection, before (PREART) and 12 months (M12ART) after suppressive cART. HIV proviral reservoir size was determined by quantitative real-time PCR; intrahost viral diversity of the env C2-V3 region was assessed by single genome amplification or next-generation sequencing in PBMC and plasma, respectively. Mean nucleotide diversity (π) and normalized Shannon entropy (HSN) were used to infer the complexity of the viral population. Compared to PREART, M12ART saw an immunological recovery with a gain of ∼200 CD4+ T cells (P = 0.008) and a normalization of the CD4/CD8 ratio [1.0 (IQR: 0.88-1.18), P = 0.016], as well as a significant decrease in HIV-1 RNA (∼4 log, P = 0.004) and DNA (∼1 log, P = 0.002) levels. The median time to achieve viral suppression was 3 months (IQR: 2.8-5.8 months). The high intermixing between sequences from both visits suggests that the HIV-1 DNA reservoir remained remarkably stable under cART. After 1 year of cART, there was a minor reduction in proviral π (PreART = 0.20 vs. M12ART = 0.10; P = 0.156) but a significant decrease in HSN (PreART = 0.41 vs. M12ART = 0.25; P = 0.019). We found no correlation between π or HSN at PreART and the rate of HIV DNA decay, T CD4+ counts, or CD4/CD8 ratio at M12ART. Based on a small cohort of Brazilian infected individuals under early cART and analyses of the env region, 1 year of follow-up suggested a reservoir size reduction, allowed a significant decrease of HIV-1 complexity, and achieved immunological restoration regardless of the initial HIV-1 plasma viral load, CD4+ T cell counts, or HIV-1 subtype. However, further studies in the Brazilian setting aiming a longer follow-up and larger cohort are required in this field.",Positive Regulation of Spoilage Potential and Biofilm Formation in Shewanella baltica OS155 via Quorum Sensing System Composed of DKP and Orphan LuxRs.,https://www.ncbi.nlm.nih.gov/pubmed/30804914,Frontiers in microbiology,2019 02 27,"The spoilage potential and biofilm formation of Shewanella baltica are reported to be regulated by Quorum sensing (QS) system from the phenotype point of view, but the specific mechanism is not fully understood. In the present study, the QS autoinducers were detected by UHPLC-MS/MS, cell density-dependent luxR-type genes were obtained through autoregulation experiments among a series of candidates in S. baltica OS155 (The SSO of large yellow croaker). The direct interaction between cyclo-(L-Pro-L-Phe) (PP) and LuxR01 as well as LuxR02 proteins was revealed via in vitro binding assay. Deletion of luxR-type genes (luxR01 and luxR02) impaired spoilage potential and biofilm formation of S. baltica OS155 in various degrees. Transcriptional analysis and qRT-PCR validation showed that spoilage and biofilm-related genes torS, speF, and pomA were down-regulated in luxR01 and luxR02 deletion strains. In addition, exogenous PP promoted spoilage potential and biofilm formation, which could be attenuated by luxR01 or luxR02 deletion. Our results revealed an explicit QS system employing PP as autoinducer and two orphan LuxRs as receptors which positively regulated spoilage capacity and biofilm formation via transcriptional regulation of corresponding genes in S. baltica OS155, which provides potential specific targets for seafood preservation involving QS system.",Reannotation of the Ribonucleotide Reductase in a Cyanophage Reveals Life History Strategies Within the Virioplankton.,https://www.ncbi.nlm.nih.gov/pubmed/30804913,Frontiers in microbiology,2019 02 28,"Ribonucleotide reductases (RNRs) are ancient enzymes that catalyze the reduction of ribonucleotides to deoxyribonucleotides. They are required for virtually all cellular life and are prominent within viral genomes. RNRs share a common ancestor and must generate a protein radical for direct ribonucleotide reduction. The mechanisms by which RNRs produce radicals are diverse and divide RNRs into three major classes and several subclasses. The diversity of radical generation methods means that cellular organisms and viruses typically contain the RNR best-suited to the environmental conditions surrounding DNA replication. However, such diversity has also fostered high rates of RNR misannotation within subject sequence databases. These misannotations have resulted in incorrect translative presumptions of RNR biochemistry and have diminished the utility of this marker gene for ecological studies of viruses. We discovered a misannotation of the RNR gene within the Prochlorococcus phage P-SSP7 genome, which caused a chain of misannotations within commonly observed RNR genes from marine virioplankton communities. These RNRs are found in marine cyanopodo- and cyanosiphoviruses and are currently misannotated as Class II RNRs, which are O2-independent and require cofactor B12. In fact, these cyanoviral RNRs are Class I enzymes that are O2-dependent and may require a di-metal cofactor made of Fe, Mn, or a combination of the two metals. The discovery of an overlooked Class I β subunit in the P-SSP7 genome, together with phylogenetic analysis of the α and β subunits confirms that the RNR from P-SSP7 is a Class I RNR. Phylogenetic and conserved residue analyses also suggest that the P-SSP7 RNR may constitute a novel Class I subclass. The reannotation of the RNR clade represented by P-SSP7 means that most lytic cyanophage contain Class I RNRs, while their hosts, B12-producing Synechococcus and Prochlorococcus, contain Class II RNRs. By using a Class I RNR, cyanophage avoid a dependence on host-produced B12, a more effective strategy for a lytic virus. The discovery of a novel RNR β subunit within cyanopodoviruses also implies that some unknown viral genes may be familiar cellular genes that are too divergent for homology-based annotation methods to identify."

Previous pol region studies (2003-2013) in 828 patients from six states from Central Western, Northern and Northeastern Brazil reported variable rates of BF1, F1CB, BC, and CF1 mosaics. In this study HIV-1 subtype diversity BF1, F1CB, BC, and CF1 recombinants in pol were analyzed. Full/near-full/partial genome sequences were generated from F1CB and BF1 recombinants. Genomic DNA extracted from whole blood was used in nested-PCR to amplify four overlapping fragments encompassing the full HIV-1 genome. Phylogenetic trees were generated using the neighbor-joining/NJ method (MEGA 6.0). The time of the most recent common ancestor (TMRCA) of F1CB and BF1 clades was estimated using a Bayesian Markov Chain Monte Carlo approach (BEAST v1.8; BEAGLE). Bootscanning was used for recombination analyses (Simplot v3.5.1); separate NJ phylogenetic analysis of fragments confirmed subtypes. The phylogenetic analyses of protease/reverse-transcriptase sequences in 828 patients revealed 76% subtype B (n = 629), 6.4% subtype C (n = 53), 4.2% subtype F1 (n = 35), 13.4% intersubtype recombinants: 10.5% BF1 (n = 87), 2.3% BC (n = 19), 0.4% F1CB (n = 3), and 0.2% CF1 (n = 2). Two full and one partial BF1C genomes allowed the characterization of the CRF81_cpx that has 9 breakpoints dividing the genome into 10 subregions. Basic Local Alignment Search Tool searches (Los Alamos HIV Sequence Database) identified six other sequences with the same recombination profile in pol, five from Brazil, and one from Italy. The estimated median TMRCA of CRF81_cpx was 1999 (1992-2003). CRF60_BC-like sequences, originally described in Italy, were also found. Two full and one near full-length BF1 genomes led to the characterization of the new CRF99_BF1 that has six recombination breakpoints dividing the genome into seven subregions. Two new URFs BF1, with six recombination breakpoints and seven subregions were also characterized. The description of the first Brazilian BF1C CRF81_cpx and of the new CRF99_BF1 corroborate the important role of CRFs in the HIV/AIDS epidemic throughout Brazil. Our data also highlight the value of HIV-1 full-genome sequence studies in order to fully reveal the complexity of the epidemic in a huge country as Brazil.",Proteomic Analysis of Paracoccidioides brasiliensis During Infection of Alveolar Macrophages Primed or Not by Interferon-Gamma.,https://www.ncbi.nlm.nih.gov/pubmed/30804901,Frontiers in microbiology,2019 02 27,"Although members of the Paracoccidioides complex are not obligate intracellular pathogens, they present the ability to survive and multiply inside epithelial cells and phagocytes of mammals, which may favor the spread of the fungus in host tissues. Macrophages resident in the lung are the first line of defense against paracoccidioidomycosis (PCM), presenting mechanisms to control the pathogen dissemination through the granuloma formation or eliminating the fungus through phagocytosis. Phagocytosis triggers an oxidative burst, in which there is an increase in the production of toxic elements, derived from oxygen and nitrogen. The interior of the phagolysosome is a harsh environment to the internalized pathogens, since in addition to the oxygen and nitrogen reactive species, microorganisms face nutrient shortages and proteases activity. Through the NanoUPLC-MS 
E
 technology, we analyzed the proteomic response of Paracoccidioides brasiliensis during the infection of alveolar macrophages primed or not by interferon gamma (IFN-γ). At 6 hs post-infection, only (IFN-γ)-primed macrophages were able to kill the fungus. We observed the regulation of amino acids degradation, tricarboxylic acid cycle, respiratory chain, ATP synthesis, glyoxylate cycle, as well as an increase in the expression of defense proteins related to oxidative stress, heat shock, and virulence factors under both conditions analyzed. However, some pathways described as essential for the survival of pathogens inside macrophages were observed only or with higher intensity in yeast cells recovered from non-primed macrophages, as phosphate pentoses pathway, methylcitrate cycle, synthesis of cell wall components, and mitochondrial activity. The data indicate that the intracellular environment of non-primed macrophages could be more permissive to the survival and multiplication of P. brasiliensis. The identification of key molecules for the establishment of infection can help the understanding of the nature of the parasite-host relationship and pathogenesis of PCM.",Potential for Prebiotics as Feed Additives to Limit Foodborne Campylobacter Establishment in the Poultry Gastrointestinal Tract.,https://www.ncbi.nlm.nih.gov/pubmed/30804900,Frontiers in microbiology,2019 02 27,"Campylobacter as an inhabitant of the poultry gastrointestinal tract has proven to be difficult to reduce with most feed additives. In-feed antibiotics have been taken out of poultry diets due to the negative reactions of consumers along with concerns regarding the generation of antibiotic resistant bacteria. Consequently, interest in alternative feed supplements to antibiotics has grown. One of these alternatives, prebiotics, has been examined as a potential animal and poultry feed additive. Prebiotics are non-digestible ingredients by host enzymes that enhance growth of indigenous gastrointestinal bacteria that elicit metabolic characteristics considered beneficial to the host and depending on the type of metabolite, antagonistic to establishment of pathogens. There are several carbohydrate polymers that qualify as prebiotics and have been fed to poultry. These include mannan-oligosaccharides and fructooligosaccharides as the most common ones marketed commercially that have been used as feed supplements in poultry. More recently, several other non-digestible oligosaccharides have also been identified as possessing prebiotic properties when implemented as feed supplements. While there is evidence that prebiotics may be effective in poultry and limit establishment of foodborne pathogens such as Salmonella in the gastrointestinal tract, less is known about their impact on Campylobacter. This review will focus on the potential of prebiotics to limit establishment of Campylobacter in the poultry gastrointestinal tract and future research directions.",Lactobacillus plantarum PFM 105 Promotes Intestinal Development Through Modulation of Gut Microbiota in Weaning Piglets.,https://www.ncbi.nlm.nih.gov/pubmed/30804899,Frontiers in microbiology,2019 02 27,"Lactobacillus plantarum is a widespread bacterial species and is commonly used as a probiotic.

L. plantarum PFM105 was identified to improve the growth of weaning piglet and promote the development of small intestinal villi. Antibiotics are often used in weaning piglet to prevent intestinal infection and promote the growth of animal. We found that weaning piglets feeding with L. plantarum PFM105 showed similar growth promotion but decreased diarrhea incidence compared with those feeding with antibiotics. High-throughput sequencing was used to analyze the gut microbiota in weaning piglets treated with L. plantarum PFM105 or antibiotics. The relative abundance of beneficial microbes Prevotellaceae and Bifidobacteriaceae were increased in colon of weaning piglet feeding L. plantarum PFM105, while antibiotics increased the relative abundance of bacteria associated with pathogenicity, such as Spirochaeta and Campylobacteraceae. L. plantarum PFM 105 increased indicators of intestinal health including serum levels of IgM, IL-10, and TGF-β, and colonic levels of SCFAs. We found strong correlations between the alterations in gut microbiota composition caused by feeding antibiotics and probiotics and the measured growth and health parameters in weaning piglets. The addition of L. plantarum PFM105 could significantly increase the relative abundance of metabolic genes which may important to intestinal microbiota maturation. Altogether, we demonstrated here that L. plantarum PFM 105 could promote intestinal development through modulation of gut microbiota in weaning piglets.",NADH Dehydrogenases in Pseudomonas aeruginosa Growth and Virulence.,https://www.ncbi.nlm.nih.gov/pubmed/30804898,Frontiers in microbiology,2019 02 28,"Pseudomonas aeruginosa is an opportunistic human pathogen with a complex respiratory chain. The bacterium is predicted to express three NADH:ubiquinone oxidoreductases (NDH-1, NDH-2 and Nqr). We created deletions strains of the predicted NADH:ubiquinone oxidoreductases alone, and in combination to determine the respective roles of the NADH dehydrogenases in growth and virulence. NDH-1 and NDH-2 were largely redundant under aerobic conditions. Aerobic NADH dehydrogenase enzymatic activity assay was lost with deletion of both NDH-1 and NDH-2. Under anaerobic conditions, NDH-1 was required for robust growth, and overexpression of NDH-2 rescued the NDH-1 anaerobic growth defect in rich media. There was not compensatory upregulation of NDH-2 under anaerobic conditions in NDH-1 deletion strains. To test which genes were required for in vivo virulence, we used both an insect and plant disease model. In the Galleria mellonella model, neither deletion of NDH-1 nor NDH-2 led to a change in median lethal dose, although death occurred more slowly in the NDH-1 deletion infections. In a lettuce model of virulence, loss of NDH-1 caused a decrease in recovered viable bacteria and a decrease in visual tissue damage. The compound deletion of NDH-1/NDH-2 causes a severe growth defect, both under aerobic and anaerobic conditions, and was avirulent in a lettuce model. Together, these results demonstrate the redundancy of the P. aeruginosa respiratory chain at the NADH dehydrogenase level in aerobic growth and virulence.",The MapZ-Mediated Methylation of Chemoreceptors Contributes to Pathogenicity of Pseudomonas aeruginosa.,https://www.ncbi.nlm.nih.gov/pubmed/30804897,Frontiers in microbiology,2019 02 28,"The pathogenic bacterium Pseudomonas aeruginosa is notorious for causing acute and chronic infections in humans. The ability to infect host by P. aeruginosa is dependent on a complex cellular signaling network, which includes a large number of chemosensory signaling pathways that rely on the methyl-accepting chemotaxis proteins (MCPs). We previously found that the second messenger c-di-GMP-binding adaptor MapZ modulates the methylation of an amino acid-detecting MCP by directly interacting with a chemotaxis methyltransferase CheR1. The current study further expands our understanding of the role of MapZ in regulating chemosensory pathways by demonstrating that MapZ suppresses the methylation of multiple MCPs in P. aeruginosa PAO1. The MCPs under the control of MapZ include five MCPs (Aer, CtpH, CptM, PctA, and PctB) for detecting oxygen/energy, inorganic phosphate, malate and amino acids, and three MCPs (PA1251, PA1608, and PA2867) for detecting unknown chemoattractant or chemorepellent. Chemotaxis assays showed that overexpression of MapZ hampered the taxis of P. aeruginosa toward chemoattractants and scratch-wounded human cells. Mouse infection experiments demonstrated that a dysfunction in MapZ regulation had a profound negative impact on the dissemination of P. aeruginosa and resulted in attenuated bacterial virulence. Together, the results imply that by controlling the methylation of various MCPs via the adaptor protein MapZ, c-di-GMP exerts a profound influence on chemotactic responses and bacterial pathogenesis.",Benefits and Inputs From Lactic Acid Bacteria and Their Bacteriocins as Alternatives to Antibiotic Growth Promoters During Food-Animal Production.,https://www.ncbi.nlm.nih.gov/pubmed/30804896,Frontiers in microbiology,2019 02 27,"Resistance to antibiotics is escalating and threatening humans and animals worldwide. Different countries have legislated or promoted the ban of antibiotics as growth promoters in livestock and aquaculture to reduce this phenomenon. Therefore, to improve animal growth and reproduction performance and to control multiple bacterial infections, there is a potential to use probiotics as non-antibiotic growth promoters. Lactic acid bacteria (LAB) offer various advantages as potential probiotics and can be considered as alternatives to antibiotics during food-animal production. LAB are safe microorganisms with abilities to produce different inhibitory compounds such as bacteriocins, organic acids as lactic acid, hydrogen peroxide, diacetyl, and carbon dioxide. LAB can inhibit harmful microorganisms with their arsenal, or through competitive exclusion mechanism based on competition for binding sites and nutrients. LAB endowed with specific enzymatic functions (amylase, protease…) can improve nutrients acquisition as well as animal immune system stimulation. This review aimed at underlining the benefits and inputs from LAB as potential alternatives to antibiotics in poultry, pigs, ruminants, and aquaculture production.",High-Level PM2.5/PM10 Exposure Is Associated With Alterations in the Human Pharyngeal Microbiota Composition.,https://www.ncbi.nlm.nih.gov/pubmed/30804895,Frontiers in microbiology,2019 02 27,"Previous studies showed that high concentration of particulate matter (PM) 2.5 and PM10 carried a large number of bacterial and archaeal species, including pathogens and opportunistic pathogens. In this study, pharyngeal swabs from 83 subjects working in an open air farmer's market were sampled before and after exposure to smog with PM2.5 and PM10 levels up to 200 and 300 μg/m3, respectively. Their microbiota were investigated using high-throughput sequencing targeting the V3-V4 regions of the 16S rRNA gene. The genus level phylotypes was increased from 649 to 767 in the post-smog pharyngeal microbiota, of which 142 were new and detected only in the post-smog microbiota. The 142 new genera were traced to sources such as soil, marine, feces, sewage sludge, freshwater, hot springs, and saline lakes. The abundance of the genera Streptococcus, Haemophilus, Moraxella, and Staphylococcus increased in the post-smog pharyngeal microbiota. All six alpha diversity indices and principal component analysis showed that the taxonomic composition of the post-smog pharyngeal microbiota was significantly different to that of the pre-smog pharyngeal microbiota. Redundancy analysis showed that the influences of PM2.5/PM10 exposure and smoking on the taxonomic composition of the pharyngeal microbiota were statistically significant (p < 0.001). Two days of exposure to high concentrations of PM2.5/PM10 changed the pharyngeal microbiota profiles, which may lead to an increase in respiratory diseases. Wearing masks could reduce the effect of high-level PM2.5/PM10 exposure on the pharyngeal microbiota.",The Type IV Secretion System of ICEAfe1: Formation of a Conjugative Pilus in Acidithiobacillus ferrooxidans.,https://www.ncbi.nlm.nih.gov/pubmed/30804894,Frontiers in microbiology,2019 02 27,"The dispersal of mobile genetic elements and their gene cargo relies on type IV secretion systems (T4SS). In this work the ICEAfe1 Tra-type T4SS nanomachine, encoded in the publicly available genome of Acidithiobacillus ferrooxidans ATCC 23270TY, was characterized in terms of its organization, conservation, expression and mating bridge formation. Twenty-one conjugative genes grouped in four genetic clusters encode the ICEAfe1 T4SS, containing all the indispensable functions for the formation and stabilization of the pili and for DNA processing. The clusters' organization resembles that of other mobile genetic elements (such as plasmids and integrative and conjugative elements-ICEs). Sequence conservation, genetic organization and distribution of the tra system in the genomes of other sequenced Acidithiobacillus spp. suggests that the ICEAfe1 T4SS could mediate the lateral gene transfer between related bacteria. All ICEAfe1 T4SS genes are transcriptionally active and expressed from four independent operons. The transcriptional levels of selected marker genes increase in response to Mitomycin C treatment, a DNA damage elicitor that has acknowledged stimulatory effects on excision rates and gene expression of other ICEs, including ICEAfe1. Using a tailor-made pilin-antiserum against ICEAfe1 T4SS TraA pilin and epifluorescence microscopy, the presence of the conjugative pili on the cell surface of A. ferrooxidans could be demonstrated. Additionally, immunodetection assays, by immunogold, allowed the identification of pili-like extracellular structures. Together, the results obtained in this work demonstrate that the ICEAfe1 T4SS is phylogenetically conserved within the taxon, is expressed at mRNA and protein levels in vivo in the A. ferrooxidans type strain, and produces a pili-like structure of extracellular and intercellular localization in this model acidophile, supporting its functionality. Additional efforts will be required to prove conjugation of the ICEAfe1 or parts of this element through the cognate T4SS.","HIV-1 Molecular Epidemiology, Transmission Clusters and Transmitted Drug Resistance Mutations in Central Brazil.",https://www.ncbi.nlm.nih.gov/pubmed/30804893,Frontiers in microbiology,2019 02 27,"We aimed to characterize HIV-1 molecular epidemiology and transmission clusters among heterosexual (HET) and men who have sex with men (MSM) individuals, as well as transmitted drug resistance mutations (TDRM) in Central-Western Brazil. This cross-sectional survey was conducted among 190 antiretroviral naïve HIV-1 infected individuals. Proviral DNA was extracted, and nested PCR amplified partial polymerase gene (PR/RT). After sequencing, subtypes were assigned, and the sequences were analyzed for the occurrence of possible transmission networks. Calibrated Population Resistance (CPR) tool from Stanford HIV Database was used to investigate the presence of TDRM. Among 150 individuals whose samples were successfully sequenced, the most prevalent HIV-1 subtype was B, followed by recombinant forms. The occurrence of twenty transmission clusters composed by at least two sequences was verified, suggesting the existence of transmission clusters among individuals from the same or distinct sexual orientations. Intermediate level of TDRM (12%) was found in the study population, and almost half of the subjects with TDRM had more than one resistance mutation. No correlations between sexual orientation and the presence of TDRM, HIV-1 subtypes/recombinants forms were verified. Taken together, the necessity of the continuous monitoring of the TDRM to verify the importance of pre-genotyping and to delineate future strategies in primary antiretroviral therapy. Likewise, the knowledge of the HIV-1 transmission networks in Brazil would allow the implementation of effective HIV-1 prevention strategies in local settings."

However, the relationship between the physiological status of sleep and subjective fatigue remains unknown. In the present study, we hypothesized that the non-recovery of fatigue at wake time due to non-restorative sleep might be ascribed to changes in specific parameters of electroencephalography (EEG) and heart rate variability (HRV) in poor sleepers. Twenty healthy female shift-working nurses participated in the study. Subjective fatigue was assessed using the visual analog scale (VAS) at bedtime and wake time. During sleep on the night between 2 consecutive day shifts, the EEG powers at the frontal pole, HRV based on electrocardiograms, and distal-proximal gradient of skin temperature were recorded and analyzed. The results indicated that the subjects with high fatigue on the VAS at wake time exhibited (1) a decrease in deep non-rapid eye movement (NREM) (stageN3) sleep duration in the first sleep cycle; (2) a decrease in REM latency; (3) a decrease in ultra-slow and delta EEG powers, particularly from 30 to 65 min after sleep onset; (4) a decrease in the total power of HRV, particularly from 0 to 30 min after sleep onset; (5) an increase in the very low frequency component of HRV; and (6) a smaller increase in the distal-proximal gradient of skin temperature, than those of the subjects with low fatigue levels. The correlational and structural equation modeling analyses of these parameters suggested that an initial decrease in the total power of HRV from 0 to 30 min after sleep onset might inhibit the recovery from fatigue during sleep (i.e., increase the VAS score at wake time) via its effects on the ultra-slow and delta powers from 30 to 65 min after sleep onset, stageN3 duration in the first sleep cycle, REM latency, and distal-proximal gradient of skin temperature. These findings suggest an important role of these physiological factors in recovery from fatigue during sleep, and that interventions to modify these physiological factors might ameliorate fatigue at wake time.","Thrombin and the Coag-Inflammatory Nexus in Neurotrauma, ALS, and Other Neurodegenerative Disorders.",https://www.ncbi.nlm.nih.gov/pubmed/30804878,Frontiers in neurology,2019 06 10,"This review details our current understanding of thrombin signaling in neurodegeneration, with a focus on amyotrophic lateral sclerosis (ALS, Lou Gehrig's disease) as well as future directions to be pursued. The key factors are multifunctional and involved in regulatory pathways, namely innate immune and the coagulation cascade activation, that are essential for normal nervous system function and health. These two major host defense systems have a long history in evolution and include elements and regulators of the coagulation pathway that have significant impacts on both the peripheral and central nervous system in health and disease. The clotting cascade responds to a variety of insults to the CNS including injury and infection. The blood brain barrier is affected by these responses and its compromise also contributes to these detrimental effects. Important molecules in signaling that contribute to or protect against neurodegeneration include thrombin, thrombomodulin (TM), protease activated receptor 1 (PAR1), damage associated molecular patterns (DAMPs), such as high mobility group box protein 1 (HMGB1) and those released from mitochondria (mtDAMPs). Each of these molecules are entangled in choices dependent upon specific signaling pathways in play. For example, the particular cleavage of PAR1 by thrombin vs. activated protein C (APC) will have downstream effects through coupled factors to result in toxicity or neuroprotection. Furthermore, numerous interactions influence these choices such as the interplay between HMGB1, thrombin, and TM. Our hope is that improved understanding of the ways that components of the coagulation cascade affect innate immune inflammatory responses and influence the course of neurodegeneration, especially after injury, will lead to effective therapeutic approaches for ALS, traumatic brain injury, and other neurodegenerative disorders.",A Systemic Review of Functional Near-Infrared Spectroscopy for Stroke: Current Application and Future Directions.,https://www.ncbi.nlm.nih.gov/pubmed/30804877,Frontiers in neurology,2019 02 27,"Background: Survivors of stroke often experience significant disability and impaired quality of life. The recovery of motor or cognitive function requires long periods. Neuroimaging could measure changes in the brain and monitor recovery process in order to offer timely treatment and assess the effects of therapy. A non-invasive neuroimaging technique near-infrared spectroscopy (NIRS) with its ambulatory, portable, low-cost nature without fixation of subjects has attracted extensive attention. Methods: We conducted a comprehensive literature review in order to review the use of NIRS in stroke or post-stroke patients in July 2018. NCBI Pubmed database, EMBASE database, Cochrane Library and ScienceDirect database were searched. Results: Overall, we reviewed 66 papers. NIRS has a wide range of application, including in monitoring upper limb, lower limb recovery, motor learning, cortical function recovery, cerebral hemodynamic changes, cerebral oxygenation, as well as in therapeutic method, clinical researches, and evaluation of the risk for stroke. Conclusions: This study provides a preliminary evidence of the application of NIRS in stroke patients as a monitoring, therapeutic, and research tool. Further studies could give more emphasize on the combination of NIRS with other techniques and its utility in the prevention of stroke.","Determinants of Developing Stroke Among Low-Income, Rural Residents: A 27-Year Population-Based, Prospective Cohort Study in Northern China.",https://www.ncbi.nlm.nih.gov/pubmed/30804876,Frontiers in neurology,2019 02 27,"Although strokes are the leading cause of death and disability in many countries, China still lacks long-term monitoring data on stroke incidence and risk factors. This study explored stroke risk factors in a low-income, rural population in China. The study population was derived from the Tianjin Brain Study, a population-based stroke monitoring study that began in 1985. This study documented the demographic characteristics, past medical histories, and personal lifestyles of the study participants. In addition, physical examinations, including measurements of blood pressure (BP), height, and weight, were performed. Hazard ratios (HRs) were estimated for the risk factors for all subtypes of stroke using multivariate Cox regression analyses. During the study with mean following-up time of 23.16 years, 3906 individuals were recruited at baseline, and during 27 years of follow-up, 638 strokes were documented. The multivariate Cox regression analyses revealed a positive correlation between age and stroke incidence. Limited education was associated with a 1.9-fold increase in stroke risk (lowest vs. highest education level). Stroke risk was higher among former smokers than among current smokers (HR, 1.8 vs. 1.6; both, P < 0.05). Moreover, stroke risk was significantly associated with sex (HR, 1.8), former alcohol drinking (HR, 2.7), baseline hypertension (HR, 3.1), and overweight (HR, 1.3). In conclusion, this study identified uncontrollable (sex and age) and controllable (education, smoking, alcohol drinking, hypertension, and overweight) risk factors for stroke in a low-income, rural population in China. Therefore, it is critical to control BP and weight effectively, advocate cessation of smoking/alcohol drinking, and enhance the education level in this population to prevent increase in the burden of stroke in China.",Apraclonidine Is Better Than Cocaine for Detection of Horner Syndrome.,https://www.ncbi.nlm.nih.gov/pubmed/30804875,Frontiers in neurology,2019 02 27,"Background: In suspected cases of Horner syndrome pharmacological confirmation is often required before embarking on further investigations. There are two drugs currently used for this purpose that are commercially available for topical administration: cocaine (2-10%) and apraclonidine (0.5-1.0%). Aims: To evaluate and compare the effects of both drugs in normal eyes and eyes with Horner syndrome Methods: This is a retrospective study looking at the outcome of 660 consecutive pharmacological tests with these two drugs in one tertiary referral center over 14 years. Eyes were categorized as ""normal"" or ""Horner syndrome"" based on non-pharmacological criteria (pupillometric and clinical evidence). Pupil diameters in the dark and in bright light were measured by pupillometry before and 40 min after administration of the test drug (either 4% cocaine or 0.5% apraclonidine). Results: Cocaine dilated the normal pupil (measured in bright light: mean +2.1 mm, range -0.4 to +3.9 mm; 95% lower limit +0.5 mm); the extent of this response was not significantly affected by patient age or pupil size, but was 50% less in brown eyes compared with blue or green eyes, and 20% less if the measurements were made in the dark. In eyes with Horner syndrome cocaine had significantly less mydriatic effect (mean +0.7 mm, range -0.7 to +2.9 mm). Apraclonidine constricted the normal pupil (measured in the dark: mean -0.4 mm, range -1.3 to +0.8 mm; 95% upper limit +0.1 mm); eye color made no difference but the response was significantly greater in younger patients and larger pupils and significantly less if measured in bright lighting conditions. In eyes with Horner syndrome apraclonidine dilated the pupil (mean +0.6, range -0.4 to +2.3 mm). Applying the 95% limits identified from my normative data, I estimate the sensitivity of each drug test for detection of Horner syndrome at 40% for cocaine (criterion for abnormal: mydriasis ≤0.5 mm when measured in the dark) compared with 93% for apraclonidine (criterion for abnormal: mydriasis ≥0.1 mm when measured in the dark). Conclusions: Apraclonidine is a more sensitive test than cocaine for detection of Horner syndrome, and should be adopted as the new gold standard in routine clinical practice. However, caution is needed when using this drug within hours of a suspected sympathetic lesion, or in infants under 1 year of age.",The Long-Term Effect of Cancer on Incident Stroke: A Nationwide Population-Based Cohort Study in Korea.,https://www.ncbi.nlm.nih.gov/pubmed/30804874,Frontiers in neurology,2019 02 27,"Background and Purpose: Despite the recent growing interest in the cancer-stroke association, the long-term effect, and organ-specific association with stroke incidence in subjects with cancer have not been clearly defined. Methods: Data were obtained from the Korean National Health Insurance Service National Sample Cohort database between 2002 and 2015. To investigate the effects of cancer on stroke incidence, subjects were classified into cancer and non-cancer groups based on the period after cancer diagnosis and origin organ of cancer. To minimize the effects of selection bias, we performed a propensity score matching analysis with covariates of demographic data, vascular risk factors, antithrombotics use and statin use. Incident stroke was diagnosed based on operational definition and classified into ischemic stroke and hemorrhagic stroke. Results: Data of 20,707 subjects with cancer and 675,594 without cancer were analyzed for 7 follow-up years. The subjects with cancer had higher risk of any stroke (subdistribution hazard ratio [SHR], 1.13; 95% confidence interval [CI], 1.02-1.26; p = 0.0181) than those without cancer. Similar trend was found for ischemic stroke (SHR, 1.17; 95% CI, 1.05-1.31; p = 0.0054), but not for hemorrhagic stroke. The risk of stroke was increased in subjects with cancer in the digestive organ, respiratory and intrathoracic organ, and ""others (such as breast and female and male reproductive organs)"" in 3 years; however, the association disappeared thereafter except those with ""others"" cancer. Chemotherapy increased the risk of ischemic stroke (SHR 1.21; 95% CI, 1.03-1.41). Conclusions: Cancer increases the risk of stroke at 3 years after the diagnosis of cancer, and the effect was maintained for 7 years. The association between cancer and stroke incidence depends on the organ from which the cancer originated and chemotherapy.",Measuring Neurobehavioral Disabilities Among Severe Brain Injury Survivors: Reports of Survivors and Proxies in the Chronic Phase.,https://www.ncbi.nlm.nih.gov/pubmed/30804873,Frontiers in neurology,2019 02 27,"Background: Neurobehavioral disability (NBD) has a major influence on long-term psychosocial outcome following acquired brain injury, as it affects not only the survivor of the brain injury, but the whole family. Objectives: To investigate (1) the frequency of NBD among survivors of severe brain injury measured by the Danish version of the St Andrew's-Swansea Neurobehavioural Outcome Scale (SASNOS) rated by patients and proxies, (2) factors associated with NBD, and (3) concordance between reports of NBD completed by patients and proxies. Methods: SASNOS was administered at an outpatient unit as a part of a follow-up assessment after discharge from intensive neurorehabilitation. SASNOS consists of five factors describing the following domains: Interpersonal Behavior, Cognition, Aggression, Inhibition and Communication, and both the patient and a proxy were asked to complete the questionnaire. Data collection was conducted over a period of 2 years, and 32 patients and 31 proxies completed the questionnaire. Mean time since injury was 19.4 months (10.0 SD). Most patients were male (68.8%), and most proxies were female (58.1%). Most of the patients had suffered a traumatic brain injury (68.8%). Results: A fourth of this patient group reported themselves below the normal range on the major domains of Interpersonal Behavior and Cognition. Significant associations between proxies' reports and time since injury, cohabitant status, and the patient's score on the Extended Glasgow Outcome Scale were found. Furthermore, significant differences were found between patient and proxy ratings. Proxies rated patients as having fewer problems on the Interpersonal Behavior domain, and more problems in relation to Cognition. Cognition was the only domain, where patients rated themselves higher indicating fewer problems, compared with their proxies. On both the Aggression and Communication domains, proxies rated patients higher indicating fewer problems than the patients themselves. Conclusion: Danish brain injury survivors experienced NBD as measured by SASNOS. Differences were found between patient and proxy ratings in relation to Cognition and Interpersonal Behavior. The NBDs identified can affect the survivor's ability to reintegrate and participate in activities of daily living, emphasizing how a systematic assessment is required.",Transcranial Direct Current Stimulation for Patients With Pharmacoresistant Epileptic Spasms: A Pilot Study.,https://www.ncbi.nlm.nih.gov/pubmed/30804872,Frontiers in neurology,2019 02 27,"Background: Epileptic spasms (ES) is a severe seizure type and lack of adequate methods for controlling of clinical attacks. Previous studies have indicated that cathodal transcranial direct current stimulation (tDCS) reduces seizure frequency for patients with epilepsy. ES are proposed to have a focal cortical origin. We hypothesized that patients with ES exhibit hyperactive network hubs in the parietal lobe, and that cathodal tDCS targeting the bilateral parietal region can reduce seizure frequency in patients with pharmacoresistant ES. Materials and Methods: The present study consisted of three basic phases: (a) a pre-treatment monitoring period for 14 days; (b) a consecutive 14-day treatment period during which patients were treated with 1 or 2 mA cathode tDCS for 40 min once per day; (c) and a follow-up period for at least 28 days. During the first 20 min of treatment, the cathode was placed over the right parietal lobe (P4) with the reference electrode over the contralateral supra-orbital area. In the second 20 min, the cathode was placed over the left parietal lobe (P3), with the reference electrode over the contralateral supra-orbital area. All patients received active tDCS treatment, and some patients underwent more than one treatment block. Patients maintained a seizure diary throughout the study. Antiepileptic drug therapy remained unchanged throughout the study. K-related samples Friedman tests and two-related samples tests were used to analyze data from all patients. Results: Seven patients with pharmacoresistant ES were included, receiving a total of eighteen 14-day blocks of tDCS treatment. We observed a significant difference in seizure frequency at the second month (p = 0.028, unadjusted), as well as a trend toward decreased seizure frequency at the fourth month (p = 0.068, unadjusted) of the first follow-up, relative to baseline. Three of seven patients (42.9%) exhibited sustained seizure reduction, while one (14.3%) experienced a short-term reduction in seizure frequency following cathodal tDCS treatment. Treatment was well tolerated in all patients. Conclusions: Repeated tDCS with the cathode placed over the bilateral parietal region is safe and may be effective for reducing seizure frequency in a subgroup of patients with pharmacoresistant ES.",Kininogen Level in the Cerebrospinal Fluid May Be a Potential Biomarker for Predicting Epileptogenesis.,https://www.ncbi.nlm.nih.gov/pubmed/30804871,Frontiers in neurology,2019 02 27,"Purpose: Epilepsy is a highly disabling neurological disorder. Brain insult is the most critical cause of epilepsy in adults. This study aimed to find reliable and efficient biomarkers for predicting secondary epilepsy. Materials and methods: The LiCl-pilocarpine (LiCl-Pilo) chronic epilepsy rat model was used, and rat cerebrospinal fluid (CSF) was collected 5 days after status epilepticus (SE). The CSF was analyzed using the label-free LC-ESI-Q-TOF-MS/MS. Differential expression of proteins was confirmed using enzyme-linked immunosorbent assay (ELISA) and Western blotting. The corresponding protein level in the CSF of patients with encephalitis in the postacute phase was determined using ELISA and compared between patients with and without symptomatic epilepsy after encephalitis during a 2-year follow-up. Results: The proteomics and ELISA results showed that the protein level of kininogen (KNG) was obviously elevated in both CSF and hippocampus, but not in serum, 5 days after the onset of SE in LiCl-Pilo chronic epilepsy model rats. In patients with encephalitis, the protein level of KNG in the CSF in the postacute phase was significantly elevated in patients with a recurrent epileptic seizure during a 2-year follow-up than in patients without a recurrent seizure. Conclusion: KNG in the CSF may serve as a potential biomarker for predicting epileptogenesis in patients with encephalitis.",Association Between Parkinson's Disease and Atrial Fibrillation: A Population-Based Study.,https://www.ncbi.nlm.nih.gov/pubmed/30804869,Frontiers in neurology,2019 02 27,"Introduction: Autonomic nervous system (ANS) dysfunction contributes to several non-motor symptoms of Parkinson's disease (PD). In addition, ANS plays a role in the genesis and maintenance of atrial fibrillation (AF). This study investigated the temporal association between PD and AF. Methods: Data were obtained from the National Health Insurance Research Database of Taiwan. In total, 15,375 patients with newly diagnosed PD were matched with four controls each based on the propensity score. This study was bidirectional. A case-control study for the odds ratio (OR) of AF before PD and within 2 years of PD diagnosis was evaluated through conditional logistic regression. Furthermore, a cohort study on the subdistribution hazard ratio (SHR) for new-onset AF 2 years after PD diagnosis was evaluated using competing risk analysis. Results: In the case-control study, PD was found to be significantly comorbid with AF (adjusted OR: 1.15, 95% confidence interval [CI]: 1.04-1.28). Subgroup analysis demonstrated that this association consistently presented in the absence of confounding factors of AF. In the cohort study, people with PD were found to have a lower risk of AF (adjusted SHR: 0.92, 95% CI: 0.86-0.98). However, a consistent association was not observed between the confounding factors of AF and PD during the subgroup analysis. Conclusions: This study demonstrated that the premotor and early stages of PD were comorbid with AF, whereas the risk of AF was lower in the later stages. Thus, AF might be a premotor predictive biomarker and comorbidity of early PD."

In Germany, these students are frequently enrolled in special schools providing specific training and support for these students. Because of their cognitive difficulties, it is unclear whether standard achievement tests that are typically administered in educational large-scale assessments (LSA) are suitable of students with SEN-L. The present study evaluated the psychometric properties of a short instrument for the assessment of reasoning abilities that was administered as part of a longitudinal LSA to German students from special schools (N = 324) and basic secondary schools (N = 338) twice within 6 years. Item response modeling demonstrated an essentially unidimensional scale for both school types. Few items exhibited systematic differential item functioning (DIF) between students with and without SEN-L, allowing for valid cross-group comparisons. However, change analyses across the two time points needed to account for longitudinal DIF among students with SEN-L. Overall, the cognitive test allowed for a valid measurement of reasoning abilities in students with SEN-L and comparative analyses regarding students without SEN-L. These results demonstrate the feasibility of incorporating students with SEN-L into educational LSAs.",Differences in the Offensive and Defensive Actions of the Goalkeepers at Women's FIFA World Cup 2011.,https://www.ncbi.nlm.nih.gov/pubmed/30804856,Frontiers in psychology,2019 02 27,"The aim of this study was to analyze the technical and tactical offensive and defensive actions of the goalkeepers and to determine the relationship between these actions and the qualifying results of their respective teams. The sample studied is made up of the goalkeepers (n = 20) of the senior national teams that participated in the FIFA Women's World Cup in Germany 2011. A descriptive analysis was developed comparing the offensive and defensive actions in competition carried out by the goalkeepers on qualified teams (pass the group stage) with the goalkeepers on unclassified teams (not pass the group stage). For the inter-group comparison, the value of the coefficient of variation was incorporated and the effect size calculated. All data were treated with a statistical significance level of p < 0.05. The results show that the goalkeepers on qualified teams have higher offensive registers, as well as a higher number of passes successfully completed in different areas of the field. The goalkeepers on unclassified teams show higher defensive records such as saves inside the area, foot stops and wrong clearances among others.",Experiencing a Severe Weather Event Increases Concern About Climate Change.,https://www.ncbi.nlm.nih.gov/pubmed/30804855,Frontiers in psychology,2019 02 27,"Climate change is primarily driven by human-caused greenhouse gas (GHG) emissions, and may therefore be mitigated by changes to human behavior (Clayton et al., 2015; IPCC, 2018). Despite efforts to raise awareness and concern about climate change, GHG emissions continue to rise (IPCC, 2018). Climate change seems to be at odds with the immediate, present threats to which humans are adapted to cope (Gifford et al., 2009; Schultz, 2014; van Vugt et al., 2014). In contrast to immediate dangers, climate change is typically abstract, large scale, slow and often unrelated to the welfare of our daily lives (e.g., Ornstein and Ehrlich, 1989; Gifford, 2011). But there are moments when the consequences of climate change are readily apparent, such as extreme weather events. In the current paper, we examine the impact of personal experience with an extreme weather event, and the impact of this experience on beliefs about climate change, and intentions to take actions that can help prepare for and mitigate the consequences of climate change.",Detecting Mind Wandering: An Objective Method via Simultaneous Control of Respiration and Fingertip Pressure.,https://www.ncbi.nlm.nih.gov/pubmed/30804854,Frontiers in psychology,2019 02 27,"Mind wandering happens when one train of thought, related to a current undertaking, is interrupted by unrelated thoughts. The detection and evaluation of mind wandering can greatly help in understanding the attention control mechanism during certain focal tasks. Subjective assessments such as random thought-probe and spontaneous self-report are the ways previous research has assessed mind wandering. Here we propose a task in which participants are asked to simultaneously control respiration and fingertip pressure. They are instructed to click a force sensor at the exact moment of inhalation and exhalation of their respiration. The temporal synchronization between the respiratory signals and the fingertip force pulses offers an objective index to detect mind wandering. Twelve participants engaged in the proposed task in which self-reports of mind wandering are compared with the proposed objective index. The results show that the participants reported significantly more mind-wandering episodes during the trials with a larger temporal synchronization than they did during those trials with a smaller temporal synchronization. The findings suggest that the temporal synchronization might be used as an objective marker of mind wandering in attention training and exploration of the attention control mechanism.",PsychoBehavioroimmunology: Connecting the Behavioral Immune System to Its Physiological Foundations.,https://www.ncbi.nlm.nih.gov/pubmed/30804853,Frontiers in psychology,2019 02 27,"Although infectious disease has posed a significant and persistent threat to human survival and welfare throughout history, only recently have the psychological and behavioral implications of disease threat become a topic of research within the behavioral sciences. This growing body of work has revealed a suite of affective and cognitive processes that motivate the avoidance of disease-causing objects and situations-a cascade of processes loosely conceptualized as a ""behavioral immune system (BIS)."" Recent BIS research has linked disease threat to a surprisingly broad set of psychological and behavioral phenomena. However, research examining how the BIS is nested within our broader physiology is only beginning to emerge. Here, we review research that has begun to elucidate the physiological foundations of the BIS-at the levels of sensory modalities, cells, and genes. We also discuss the future of this work.",Generating Causal Relations in Scientific Texts: The Long-Term Advantages of Successful Generation.,https://www.ncbi.nlm.nih.gov/pubmed/30804852,Frontiers in psychology,2019 02 27,"A high level of text comprehension can be achieved by engaging learners in processes of organization and integration while reading a cohesive text. In the present study, we investigated the impact of an innovative generative technique on learning with scientific texts. The cohesion generation was implemented by means of explicit cohesion gaps. High school students (n = 199) were randomly assigned to either receive a fully cohesive scientific text (control condition) or a scientific text that required the selection of causal connectives, such as because, although, therefore, or however (generation condition). Learners in the generation condition were required to reflect on causal relations to complete the text. All students were tested immediately (T1) and 2 weeks after the learning phase (T2). Cognitive load was measured by a dual task and self-report measure. Contrary to our expectations, no differences were found in performance on inference questions (situation model). Learners in the generation condition performed worse on text-based questions at T1 but showed less forgetting from T1 to T2. The impact of condition on the situation model was moderated by reading skills. Remarkably, the generation success was highly predictive for learning outcomes even when controlling for learners' proficiencies. Consequently, learners who succeeded to employ effortful processes to overcome the difficulty showed a superior performance on both the text-base and situation-model questions compared to students reading the cohesive text. Moreover, in these learners, generative activity led to a sustainable learning performance 2 weeks later. Poor readers especially took advantage of generative activity, despite struggling to perform the cohesion task as indicated by the cognitive load measures. The results suggest that the activity of generating causal relations can augment inferential processing in learners who are not involved in inferential processing spontaneously. To successfully apply this generative learning technique, students require considerable instructional support.",Hands Up! Atypical Defensive Reactions in Heavy Players of Violent Video Games When Exposed to Gun-Attack Pictures.,https://www.ncbi.nlm.nih.gov/pubmed/30804849,Frontiers in psychology,2019 02 27,"Threatening cues and surrounding contexts trigger specific defensive response patterns. Posturography, a technique for measuring postural strategies, has been used to evaluate motor defensive reactions in humans. When exposed to gun pointed pictures, humans were shown to exhibit an immobility reaction. Short and long-term exposure to violent video games was shown to be a causal risk factor for increased violent and aggressive behavior. Assaultive violence with a gun is a major trigger for motor defensive reactions, and post-traumatic stress disorder (PTSD) is the most characteristic psychiatric sequelae. Recent studies point to links between PTSD symptoms and emotional shortfalls in non-clinical trauma-exposed samples. The present study investigated defensive reactions to gun threat and PTSD symptoms in heavy players of violent video games compared to non-players. Male university students were screened according to use of violent video games and divided in three groups: non-players, moderate players, and heavy players. Stimuli were pictures depicting a man pointing a gun directed at the participant. In matched control pictures, non-lethal objects replaced the gun. Posturography was recorded and PTSD symptoms were assessed. When exposed to the threat pictures, non-players exhibited the expected reduction in amplitude of body sway (immobility), heavy players presented atypical augmented amplitude of body sway, and moderate players showed intermediate reactivity. Heavy players presented a significant distinct reaction compared to non-players. They also scored significantly higher in PTSD symptoms than non-players. Disadvantageous defensive reactions and higher vulnerability to PTSD symptoms, revealed in the present study, add to other shortcomings for heavy players.",A Non-mediational Approach to Emotions and Feelings.,https://www.ncbi.nlm.nih.gov/pubmed/30804848,Frontiers in psychology,2019 02 27,"The present analysis proposes a non-mediational approach to the study of affective phenomena. It starts off with the common recognition that ""emotion"" is not a technical term. Even so, researchers often treat it as if it were, confusing ordinary language with technical language. This leads to two problems: first, a referentialist bias, according to which we assume emotions to be something unapparent that one must infer and describe; and second, the nominalist fallacy, according to which we assume that emotions have causal effects on actions by the fact of naming them. I review some proposals to solve the problem, among which are some behavioral alternatives. Although these alternatives overcome many of the problems mentioned, they do not completely avoid them. I conclude that a strict non-mediational approach is possible and necessary. It supports the analytical separation of ordinary and technical language. Technical language abstracts relevant properties of ordinary language that become relevant parameters to model certain emotions, as they are referred to in ordinary language. I present some possible parameters and examples for consideration and conclude that the non-mediational approach is a plausible alternative that can stimulate research programs to find natural regularities in affective phenomena.",Mental Number Representations in 2D Space.,https://www.ncbi.nlm.nih.gov/pubmed/30804847,Frontiers in psychology,2019 02 27,"There is evidence both for mental number representations along a horizontal mental number line with larger numbers to the right of smaller numbers (for Western cultures) and a physically grounded, vertical representation where ""more is up."" Few studies have compared effects in the horizontal and vertical dimension and none so far have combined both dimensions within a single paradigm where numerical magnitude was task-irrelevant and none of the dimensions was primed by a response dimension. We now investigated number representations over both dimensions, building on findings that mental representations of numbers and space co-activate each other. In a Go/No-go experiment, participants were auditorily primed with a relatively small or large number and then visually presented with quasi-randomly distributed distractor symbols and one Arabic target number (in Go trials only). Participants pressed a central button whenever they detected the target number and elsewise refrained from responding. Responses were not more efficient when small numbers were presented to the left and large numbers to the right. However, results indicated that large numbers were associated with upper space more strongly than small numbers. This suggests that in two-dimensional space when no response dimension is given, numbers are conceptually associated with vertical, but not horizontal space.",fNIRS Responses in Professional Violinists While Playing Duets: Evidence for Distinct Leader and Follower Roles at the Brain Level.,https://www.ncbi.nlm.nih.gov/pubmed/30804846,Frontiers in psychology,2019 02 27,"Music played in ensembles is a naturalistic model to study joint action and leader-follower relationships. Recently, the investigation of the brain underpinnings of joint musical actions has gained attention; however, the cerebral correlates underlying the roles of leader and follower in music performance remain elusive. The present study addressed this question by simultaneously measuring the hemodynamic correlates of functional neural activity elicited during naturalistic violin duet performance using fNIRS. Findings revealed distinct patterns of functional brain activation when musicians played the Violin 2 (follower) than the Violin 1 part (leader) in duets, both compared to solo performance. More specifically, results indicated that musicians playing the Violin 2 part had greater oxy-Hb activation in temporo-parietal (p = 0.02) and somatomotor (p = 0.04) regions during the duo condition in relation to the solo. On the other hand, there were no significant differences in the activation of these areas between duo/solo conditions during the execution of the Violin 1 part (p's > 0.05). These findings suggest that ensemble cohesion during a musical performance may impose particular demands when musicians play the follower position, especially in brain areas associated with the processing of dynamic social information and motor simulation. This study is the first to use fNIRS hyperscanning technology to simultaneously measure the brain activity of two musicians during naturalistic music ensemble performance, opening new avenues for the investigation of brain correlates underlying joint musical actions with multiple subjects in a naturalistic environment."

A Conceptual Framework Based on Developmental Psychology and Literary Theory.,https://www.ncbi.nlm.nih.gov/pubmed/30804833,Frontiers in psychology,2019 02 27,"This conceptual paper proposes a framework for understanding the developmental mechanisms and literary characteristics that bind children's storybooks with empathy. The article begins with a taxonomy of empathy composed of three key continuous dimensions: cognitive/emotional empathy, empathy for in-group and out-group members and empathy with positive and negative consequences. Insights from developmental psychology and literary theory form the basis for an interdisciplinary framework based on three premises: (1) book-reading can support empathy if it fosters in-group/out-group identification and minimizes in-group/out-group bias; (2) identification with characters who are dissimilar from the readers is the most valuable contribution of children's storybooks to cognitive empathy; and (3) the quality of language positions children's storybooks as an exceptional, but not exclusive, empathy-building form of fictional narratives. Implications for future intervention and empirical work are provided.",Bridging the Clinic to Community: Music Performance as Social Transformation for Military Service Members.,https://www.ncbi.nlm.nih.gov/pubmed/30804832,Frontiers in psychology,2019 02 27,"The use of music performance in music therapy with military service members is discussed as a vehicle for social transformation and reintegration. The use of performance in music therapy is not without controversy primarily because therapy is considered a process, not a product, and confidentiality and privacy are essential components of therapy. However, others have argued that public performances can validate therapeutic changes in clients, give voice to their experiences, raise awareness of social issues within their communities, transform perceptions of injury, or illness in audience members, and may result in the clients gaining support and validation from their communities. We discuss the potential of music performances to contribute to individual development, reinforce rehabilitation, enhance function, and facilitate change at the community level to support reintegration of military service members. We illustrate this through two brief case reports of service members who received music therapy as part of their treatment for post-traumatic stress disorder, traumatic brain injury, and other psychological health concerns at the National Intrepid Center of Excellence, a Directorate of the Walter Reed National Military Medical Center, Bethesda, MD, United States. The service members wrote, learned, and refined songs over multiple music therapy sessions and created song introductions to share with audiences the meanings and benefits gained from integrating performance in music therapy. The case reports also include excerpts of interviews conducted with these service members several months after treatment about their experiences of performing and the perceived impact of their performances on the audience and greater community.",The Mediating Role of Cognitive Flexibility in the Influence of Counter-Stereotypes on Creativity.,https://www.ncbi.nlm.nih.gov/pubmed/30804831,Frontiers in psychology,2019 02 27,"The aim of this study is to explore the relationship between counter-stereotypes and creativity, and further explore the mechanism underlying the impact of priming counter-stereotypic information on individual creativity. More importantly, here we have proposed cognitive and emotional dual processing pathways, which may mediate the influences of counter-stereotypes on creativity. Two experiments examined how counter-stereotypes impacted creativity through the dual processing pathways. A total of 152 university students were recruited to test their creativity performance. In Experiment 1, we replicated results of past studies. Participants were randomly allocated to different priming conditions (stereotype or counter-stereotype), in which descriptions of male governors and female nurses served as priming of stereotypes, whereas descriptions of male nurses and female governors served as priming of counter-stereotypes. Measurements of creativity were based on the poster paradigm. The poster paradigm required participants to design a poster for a college fellowship party. In Experiment 2, we recruited 104 participants to examine the mediating roles of emotions and cognitive flexibility. The procedure of Experiment 2 was similar to that of Experiment 1, except for the measurement of creativity, which was Chinese idiom riddle test. Participants who selected more creative answers were more creative, based on the criteria of our experimental design. Also, we included measurements of emotions (i.e., surprise and delight) and cognitive flexibility (using the Cognitive Flexibility Scale) after priming of stereotypes and counter-stereotypes in Experiment 2. We also verified the credibility of our counter-stereotype measurements. The results of Experiment 1-which replicated previous studies-demonstrated that priming of counter-stereotypes promoted creative performance compared with priming of stereotypes in the poster paradigm. However, our proposed dual processing pathways were not fully verified by Experiment 2. The results of this experiment showed that neither surprising nor delighted emotion mediated the influence of counter-stereotypes on creativity, whereas cognitive flexibility did. In conclusion, our current study reveals a mechanism of creative performance in terms of cognitive flexibility, and further inspires us to focus on the positive influence of counter-stereotypes on creativity.",The Importance of Sensory Processing in Mental Health: A Proposed Addition to the Research Domain Criteria (RDoC) and Suggestions for RDoC 2.0.,https://www.ncbi.nlm.nih.gov/pubmed/30804830,Frontiers in psychology,2019 02 28,"The time is ripe to integrate burgeoning evidence of the important role of sensory and motor functioning in mental health within the National Institute of Mental Health's [NIMH] Research Domain Criteria [RDoC] framework (National Institute of Mental Health, n.d.a), a multi-dimensional method of characterizing mental functioning in health and disease across all neurobiological levels of analysis ranging from genetic to behavioral. As the importance of motor processing in psychopathology has been recognized (Bernard and Mittal, 2015; Garvey and Cuthbert, 2017; National Institute of Mental Health, 2019), here we focus on sensory processing. First, we review the current design of the RDoC matrix, noting sensory features missing despite their prevalence in multiple mental illnesses. We identify two missing classes of sensory symptoms that we widely define as (1) sensory processing, including sensory sensitivity and active sensing, and (2) domains of perceptual signaling, including interoception and proprioception, which are currently absent or underdeveloped in the perception construct of the cognitive systems domain. Then, we describe the neurobiological basis of these psychological constructs and examine why these sensory features are important for understanding psychopathology. Where appropriate, we examine links between sensory processing and the domains currently included in the RDoC matrix. Throughout, we emphasize how the addition of these sensory features to the RDoC matrix is important for understanding a range of mental health disorders. We conclude with the suggestion that a separate sensation and perception domain can enhance the current RDoC framework, while discussing what we see as important principles and promising directions for the future development and use of the RDoC.",The Role of Motivational Regulation in Exam Preparation: Results From a Standardized Diary Study.,https://www.ncbi.nlm.nih.gov/pubmed/30804828,Frontiers in psychology,2019 02 27,"Previous studies have shown that the use of motivational regulation strategies has the potential to sustain invested effort and persistence in the learning process. Combining different methods (questionnaires and standardized diaries), the present study aimed to determine the role of motivational regulation in an exam preparation period. Motivational regulation is differentiated in a quantitative (extent of strategy use) and a qualitative (planning, implementing, monitoring, and correcting strategy use) aspect. One hundred and fifteen university students reported the quantity and quality of their motivational regulation strategy use in a pretest and kept a standardized learning diary focused on motivational difficulties and invested effort over a 14-day period just before an exam in their studies. Exam performance was assessed afterward. Results revealed positive effects of both aspects of motivational regulation on invested effort in exam preparation and exam performance. Moreover, a high quality of motivational regulation was associated with reduced negative effects of motivational difficulties on invested effort during studying-implying that motivational regulation can buffer against specific motivational problems occurring in the learning process.",'I Just Stopped Going': A Mixed Methods Investigation Into Types of Therapy Dropout in Adolescents With Depression.,https://www.ncbi.nlm.nih.gov/pubmed/30804827,Frontiers in psychology,2019 02 27,"What does it mean to 'drop out' of therapy? Many definitions of 'dropout' have been proposed, but the most widely accepted is the client ending treatment without agreement of their therapist. However, this is in some ways an external criterion that does not take into account the client's experience of therapy, or reasons for ending it prematurely. This study aimed to identify whether there were more meaningful categories of dropout than the existing dropout definition, and to test whether this refined categorization of dropout was associated with clinical outcomes. This mixed-methods study used a subset of data from the IMPACT trial, which investigated psychological therapies for adolescent depression. Adolescents were randomly allocated to a treatment arm (Brief Psychosocial Intervention; Cognitive-Behavioral Therapy; Short-Term Psychoanalytic Psychotherapy). The sample for this study comprised 99 adolescents, aged 11-17 years. Thirty-two were classified as having dropped out of treatment and participated in post-therapy qualitative interviews about their experiences of therapy. For 26 dropout cases, the therapist was also interviewed. Sixty-seven cases classified as having completed treatment were included to compare their outcomes to dropout cases. Interview data for dropout cases were analyzed using ideal type analysis. Three types of dropout were constructed: 'dissatisfied' dropout, 'got-what-they-needed' dropout, and 'troubled' dropout. 'Dissatisfied' dropouts reported stopping therapy because they did not find it helpful. 'Got-what-they-needed' dropouts reported stopping therapy because they felt they had benefitted from therapy. 'Troubled' dropouts reported stopping therapy because of a lack of stability in their lives. The findings indicate the importance of including the perspective of clients in definitions of drop out, as otherwise there is a risk that the heterogeneity of 'dropout' cases may mask more meaningful distinctions. Clinicians should be aware of the range of issues experienced by adolescents in treatment that lead to disengagement. Our typology of dropout may provide a framework for clinical decision-making in managing different types of disengagement from treatment.","She Always Steps in the Same River: Similarity Among Long-Term Partners in Their Demographic, Physical, and Personality Characteristics.",https://www.ncbi.nlm.nih.gov/pubmed/30804826,Frontiers in psychology,2019 02 27,"In mate choice, individuals consider a wide pool of potential partners. It has been found that people have certain preferences, but intraindividual stability of mate choice over time remains little explored. We tested individual consistency of mate choice with respect to a number of demographic, physical, and personality characteristics. Only mothers were recruited for this study, because we wanted to find out not only whether women choose long-term partners with certain characteristics but also whether the father of their child(ren) differs from their other long-term (ex-)partners. Women (N = 537) of 19-45 years of age indicated the demographic, physical (by using image stimuli), and personality characteristics of all of their long-term partners (partners per respondent: mean = 2.98, SD = 1.32). Then we compared the average difference between an individual's long-term partners with the expected average difference using a permutation test. We also evaluated differences between partners who had children with the participants (fathers) and other long-term partners (non-fathers) using permutation tests and mixed-effect models. Our results revealed that women choose long-term partners consistently with respect to all types of characteristics. Although effect sizes for the individual characteristics were rather weak, maximal cumulative effect size for all characteristics together was high, which suggests that relatively low effect sizes were caused by high variability with low correlations between characteristics, and not by inconsistent mate choice. Furthermore, we found that despite some differences between partners, fathers of participants' child(ren) do fit their 'type'. These results suggest that mate choice may be guided by relatively stable but to some degree flexible preferences, which makes mate choice cognitively less demanding and less time-consuming. Further longitudinal studies are needed to confirm this conclusion.",Cognitive Restoration in Children Following Exposure to Nature: Evidence From the Attention Network Task and Mobile Eye Tracking.,https://www.ncbi.nlm.nih.gov/pubmed/30804825,Frontiers in psychology,2019 02 27,"Exposure to nature improves cognitive performance through a process of cognitive restoration. However, few studies have explored the effect in children, and no studies have explored how eye movements ""in the wild"" with mobile eye tracking technology contribute to the restoration process. Our results demonstrated that just a 30-min walk in a natural environment was sufficient to produce a faster and more stable pattern of responding on the Attention Network Task, compared with an urban environment. Exposure to the natural environment did not improve executive (directed) attention performance. This pattern of results supports suggestions that children and adults experience unique cognitive benefits from nature. Further, we provide the first evidence of a link between cognitive restoration and the allocation of eye gaze. Participants wearing a mobile eye-tracker exhibited higher fixation rates while walking in the natural environment compared to the urban environment. The data go some way in uncovering the mechanisms sub-serving the restoration effect in children and elaborate how nature may counteract the effects of mental fatigue.",Target-Response Associations Can Produce Response-Congruency Effects Without Task-Switching Costs.,https://www.ncbi.nlm.nih.gov/pubmed/30804824,Frontiers in psychology,2019 02 27,"In task-switching experiments with bivalent target stimuli, conflicts during response selection give rise to response-congruency effects. Typically, participants respond more slowly and make more errors in trials with incongruent targets that require different responses in the two tasks, compared to trials with congruent targets that are associated with the same response in both tasks. Here we investigate whether participants show response-congruency effects when task rules are not made explicit. In two experiments, we assigned task-irrelevant features to each bivalent target. When participants were instructed to apply the task rules, they showed significant task-switching costs as well as response-congruency effects. Importantly, when the same participants did not know the task rules and responded without applying the task rules, they showed response-congruency effects but no switch costs. The significant congruency effects suggest that associations between bivalent target features and responses can be formed passively, even when participants do not follow the task rules and use task-irrelevant target features to make a response.",Functional Neuroimaging Correlates of Aggression in Psychosis: A Systematic Review With Recommendations for Future Research.,https://www.ncbi.nlm.nih.gov/pubmed/30804823,Frontiers in psychiatry,2019 02 27,"Background and methods: Aggression in psychosis is clinically important. We systematically compiled the evidence on functional correlates of aggression in psychosis searching PubMed, EMBASE, ScienceDirect, and PsycINFO until September 2017. We included studies reporting functional brain imaging correlates of aggression comparing: (1) affective or non-affective psychosis groups with a history of violence or with aggression operationalized using questionnaires, (2) affective or non-affective psychosis groups with a history of violence or with aggression operationalized using questionnaires to controls, (3) affective or non-affective psychosis groups with a history of violence or with aggression operationalized using questionnaires to controls with diagnoses other than affective or non-affective psychoses. We applied no language restriction and required patients to have a DSM or ICD diagnosis of affective or non-affective psychosis. Results: Our sample consisted of 12 studies with 334 patients and 113 controls. During n-back tasks, violent (VS) as opposed to non-violent persons with schizophrenia (NVS) hypoactivated their inferior parietal lobe. When anticipating shock, VS vs. NVS hyperactivated their medial prefrontal gyrus, cuneus, middle temporal gyrus, and middle occipital gyrus. When viewing negative emotional pictures, VS vs. NVS hyperactivated the middle frontal gyrus, inferior frontal gyrus, anterior cingulate, lingual gyrus, precentral gyrus, globus pallidus, mid-cingulate, and precuneus. Limitations: Due to the small number of available studies, sample overlap, and insufficient reporting of relevant moderators we could not conduct a meta-analysis. Conclusions: We found non-systematic functional correlates of aggression in schizophrenia. Only few studies using varied paradigms and often overlapping samples have been conducted. There have been no attempts to replicate any of the observed findings in the published literature. Focusing on future directions, we recommend that authors adhere to clear definitions of aggression, measurements of psychopathology, comorbidities, and medication. In particular, replication studies would allow for a better synthesis of the findings. PROSPERO Registration Number: CRD42016048579."

It is feasible to manipulate BPH infestation on rice by inhibiting YLS using fungicide. In this study, the fungicide propiconazole was injected into the hemolymph of BPH thorax via microinjection to investigate its effect on YLS, especially the dominant species, Hypomyces chrysospermus, and their host BPH. Propiconazole markedly reduced the total number of YLS and H. chrysospermus in BPH hemolymph and fat body, thereby leading to an obvious higher mortality and lower fecundity of BPH than the negative control (PBS, phosphate buffer solution). After microinjecting propiconazole, the survival rate of BPH nymphs at the 5th instar was significantly lower than that obtained after PBS treatment. Eight days after propiconazole microinjection, the BPH survival rate dropped to 40%, only half of BPH survival rate treated with PBS microinjection. For female adults (1-day-old), there were significant differences in the survival rates between BPHs treated with propiconazole and those treated with PBS at days 5-8. The fecundity of BPH decreased significantly by microinjecting propiconazole and averaged only 229 eggs per female, which was 20% less than that of the negative control. Furthermore, we reared BPH on the susceptible variety TN1 sprayed with propiconazole to prove the feasibility manipulating field occurrence of BPH by inhibiting YLS using fungicides. The number of YLS and H. chrysospermus in BPH obviously declined. Subsequently, the survival rate and fecundity of BPH significantly decreased after feeding on rice treated with propiconazole. Meanwhile, the propiconazole residue was detected in the hemolymph and gut of BPH by HPLC analysis within 1 day of feeding. Inhibiting YLS using fungicides was a novel and effective way to control BPH infestation.",C-Reactive Protein Is Elevated Only in High Creatine Kinase Responders to Muscle Damaging Exercise.,https://www.ncbi.nlm.nih.gov/pubmed/30804809,Frontiers in physiology,2019 02 27,"The purpose of this study was to investigate if exertional rhabdomyolysis induced by an acute bout of plyometric exercise in untrained individuals was associated with histological characteristics of skeletal muscle, creatine kinase (CK) polymorphism or secondary damage. Twenty-six healthy male untrained individuals completed a bout of plyometric exercise (10 sets of 10 maximal squat jumps, with each standardized to achieve at least 95% of individual maximal jump height). Blood samples were taken, and perceived pain was scored immediately before the exercise intervention and 6 h, 1, 2, and 3 days post-intervention. Muscle biopsies were collected 9 or 4 days before (baseline) and 3 days after plyometric jumps. Subjects were divided into two groups, high (n = 10) and low responders (n = 16), based on a cut-off limit for exertional rhabdomyolysis of peak CK activity ≥ 1000 U/L in any post-exercise blood sample. Perceived pain was more severe assessed in squat than standing position. Low responders perceived more pain at 6 h and 1 day, while high responders perceived more pain than low responders on days three and four after exercise; structural (dystrophin staining) and ultra-structural (transmission electron microscopy) analysis of muscle fibers revealed no baseline pathology; damage was evident in all individuals in both groups, with no difference between high and low responders in either damage or fiber type proportion. High responders had significantly higher total white blood cell and neutrophil counts 6 h and significantly higher C-reactive protein (CRP) 6 h and days one and two after exercise compared to low responders. High responders had significantly greater muscle myeloperoxidase (MPO) levels in baseline and 3 day post-exercise biopsies compared to baseline of low responders. MLCK C49T single polymorphism was present in 26% of volunteers, whose CK responses were not higher than those with MLCK CC or CT genotype. In conclusion, perceived pain is more effectively assessed with potentially affected muscle under eccentric strain, even if static. High CK responders also have pronounced CRP responses to unaccustomed plyometric exercise intervention. Exertional rhabdomyolysis after unaccustomed eccentric exercise may be related to underlying inability to resolve intramuscular MPO.",Latitudinal Pigmentation Variation Contradicts Ultraviolet Radiation Exposure: A Case Study in Tropical Indian Drosophila melanogaster.,https://www.ncbi.nlm.nih.gov/pubmed/30804808,Frontiers in physiology,2019 02 28,"The effects of ultraviolet radiation (UV) on the animal body have been reported in many studies, and melanin has emerged as a protective mechanism. In smaller insects such as Drosophila, replicated patterns of geographical variation in pigmentation have been observed on multiple continents. Such patterns are particularly pronounced on the Indian subcontinent where several species show a parallel cline in pigmentation traits. However, the potential role of UV exposure in generating the observed patterns of pigmentation variation has not been addressed. Here, we examine the association between UV intensity and body pigmentation in D. melanogaster natural populations collected along the latitudinal gradient of the Indian subcontinent. A strong negative relationship was observed between UV intensity and body pigmentation. This analysis clearly indicates that, in the sampled populations, pigmentation variation is independent of UV exposure and related selection pressures. Patterns of pigmentation in natural populations from the Indian subcontinent are better predicted by latitude itself and temperature-related climatic variables.",Extrapolating Metabolic Savings in Running: Implications for Performance Predictions.,https://www.ncbi.nlm.nih.gov/pubmed/30804807,Frontiers in physiology,2019 02 27,"Training, footwear, nutrition, and racing strategies (i.e., drafting) have all been shown to reduce the metabolic cost of distance running (i.e., improve running economy). However, how these improvements in running economy (RE) quantitatively translate into faster running performance is less established. Here, we quantify how metabolic savings translate into faster running performance, considering both the inherent rate of oxygen uptake-velocity relation and the additional cost of overcoming air resistance when running overground. We collate and compare five existing equations for oxygen uptake-velocity relations across wide velocity ranges. Because the oxygen uptake vs. velocity relation is non-linear, for velocities slower than ∼3 m/s, the predicted percent improvement in velocity is slightly greater than the percent improvement in RE. For velocities faster than ∼3 m/s, the predicted percent improvement in velocity is less than the percent improvements in RE. At 5.5 m/s, i.e., world-class marathon pace, the predicted percent improvement in velocity is ∼2/3rds of the percent improvement in RE. For example, at 2:04 marathon pace, a 3% improvement in RE translates to a 1.97% faster velocity or 2:01:36, almost exactly equal to the recently set world record.",Reproduction Immunity Trade-Off in a Mollusk: Hemocyte Energy Metabolism Underlies Cellular and Molecular Immune Responses.,https://www.ncbi.nlm.nih.gov/pubmed/30804806,Frontiers in physiology,2019 02 27,"Immune responses, as well as reproduction, are energy-hungry processes, particularly in broadcast spawners such as scallops. Thus, we aimed to explore the potential reproduction-immunity trade-off in Argopecten purpuratus, a species with great economic importance for Chile and Peru. Hemocytes, key immunological cells in mollusks, were the center of this study, where we addressed for the first time the relation between reproductive stage, hemocyte metabolic energetics and their capacity to support immune responses at cellular and molecular levels. Hemocyte metabolic capacity was assessed by their respiration rates, mitochondrial membrane potential and citrate synthase (CS) activity. Cellular immune parameters such as the number of circulating and tissue-infiltrating hemocytes and their reactive oxygen species (ROS) production capacity were considered. Molecular immune responses were examined through the transcriptional levels of two pattern recognition receptors (ApCLec and ApTLR) and two anti-microbial effectors (ferritin and big defensin). Their expressions were measured in hemocytes from immature, matured and spawned scallops under basal, and one of the following challenges: (i) in vitro, where hemocytes were challenged with the β glucan zymosan, to determine the immune potentiality under standardized conditions; or (ii) in vivo challenge, using hemocytes from scallops injected with the pathogenic bacteria Vibrio splendidus. Results indicate a post-spawning decrease in the structural components of the immune system (hemocyte number/quality) and their potential capacity of performing immune functions (with reduced ATP-producing machinery and exhaustion of energy reserves). Both in vitro and in vivo challenges demonstrate that hemocytes from immature scallops have, in most cases, the best metabolic potential (increased CS activity) and immune performances, with for example, over threefold higher ROS production and tissue-infiltration capacity than those from mature and spawned scallops after the bacterial challenge. Agreeing with cellular responses, hemocytes from immature individuals induced the highest levels of immune receptors and antimicrobial effectors after the bacterial challenge, while spawned scallops presented the lowest values. Overall, results suggest a trade-off between resource allocation in reproduction and the immune responses in A. purpuratus, with hemocyte energy metabolic capacity potentially underlying cellular and molecular immune responses. Further research would be necessary to explore regulatory mechanisms such as signaling pleiotropy which may potentially be underlying this trade-off.",Optimization of Lead Placement in the Right Ventricle During Cardiac Resynchronization Therapy. A Simulation Study.,https://www.ncbi.nlm.nih.gov/pubmed/30804805,Frontiers in physiology,2019 02 27,"Patients suffering from heart failure and left bundle branch block show electrical ventricular dyssynchrony causing an abnormal blood pumping. Cardiac resynchronization therapy (CRT) is recommended for these patients. Patients with positive therapy response normally present QRS shortening and an increased left ventricle (LV) ejection fraction. However, around one third do not respond favorably. Therefore, optimal location of pacing leads, timing delays between leads and/or choosing related biomarkers is crucial to achieve the best possible degree of ventricular synchrony during CRT application. In this study, computational modeling is used to predict the optimal location and delay of pacing leads to improve CRT response. We use a 3D electrophysiological computational model of the heart and torso to get insight into the changes in the activation patterns obtained when the heart is paced from different regions and for different atrioventricular and interventricular delays. The model represents a heart with left bundle branch block and heart failure, and allows a detailed and accurate analysis of the electrical changes observed simultaneously in the myocardium and in the QRS complex computed in the precordial leads. Computational simulations were performed using a modified version of the O'Hara et al. action potential model, the most recent mathematical model developed for human ventricular electrophysiology. The optimal location for the pacing leads was determined by QRS maximal reduction. Additionally, the influence of Purkinje system on CRT response was assessed and correlation analysis between several parameters of the QRS was made. Simulation results showed that the right ventricle (RV) upper septum near the outflow tract is an alternative location to the RV apical lead. Furthermore, LV endocardial pacing provided better results as compared to epicardial stimulation. Finally, the time to reach the 90% of the QRS area was a good predictor of the instant at which 90% of the ventricular tissue was activated. Thus, the time to reach the 90% of the QRS area is suggested as an additional index to assess CRT effectiveness to improve biventricular synchrony.",Crosstalk Between Oxidative Stress and Endoplasmic Reticulum (ER) Stress in Endothelial Dysfunction and Aberrant Angiogenesis Associated With Diabetes: A Focus on the Protective Roles of Heme Oxygenase (HO)-1.,https://www.ncbi.nlm.nih.gov/pubmed/30804804,Frontiers in physiology,2019 02 27,"Type-2 diabetes prevalence is continuing to rise worldwide due to physical inactivity and obesity epidemic. Diabetes and fluctuations of blood sugar are related to multiple micro- and macrovascular complications, that are attributed to oxidative stress, endoplasmic reticulum (ER) activation and inflammatory processes, which lead to endothelial dysfunction characterized, among other features, by reduced availability of nitric oxide (NO) and aberrant angiogenic capacity. Several enzymatic anti-oxidant and anti-inflammatory agents have been found to play protective roles against oxidative stress and its downstream signaling pathways. Of particular interest, heme oxygenase (HO) isoforms, specifically HO-1, have attracted much attention as major cytoprotective players in conditions associated with inflammation and oxidative stress. HO operates as a key rate-limiting enzyme in the process of degradation of the iron-containing molecule, heme, yielding the following byproducts: carbon monoxide (CO), iron, and biliverdin. Because HO-1 induction was linked to pro-oxidant states, it has been regarded as a marker of oxidative stress; however, accumulating evidence has established multiple cytoprotective roles of the enzyme in metabolic and cardiovascular disorders. The cytoprotective effects of HO-1 depend on several cellular mechanisms including the generation of bilirubin, an anti-oxidant molecule, from the degradation of heme; the induction of ferritin, a strong chelator of free iron; and the release of CO, that displays multiple anti-inflammatory and anti-apoptotic actions. The current review article describes the major molecular mechanisms contributing to endothelial dysfunction and altered angiogenesis in diabetes with a special focus on the interplay between oxidative stress and ER stress response. The review summarizes the key cytoprotective roles of HO-1 against hyperglycemia-induced endothelial dysfunction and aberrant angiogenesis and discusses the major underlying cellular mechanisms associated with its protective effects.",The Relationship Between Clinical Imaging and Neurobehavioral Assessment in Posthemorrhagic Ventricular Dilation of Prematurity.,https://www.ncbi.nlm.nih.gov/pubmed/30804803,Frontiers in physiology,2019 02 28,"Introduction: Neonatal intraventricular hemorrhage (IVH) and subsequent posthemorrhagic ventricular dilation and hydrocephalus of prematurity are associated with brain injury and neurodevelopmental impairment in the preterm population. Neuroimaging assesses cerebral injury and guides neurosurgical intervention; however, the relationship of head ultrasound (HUS) and magnetic resonance imaging (MRI) parameters to neonatal exams in this group has not been well described. The NICU Network Neurobehavioral Scale (NNNS) is a reproducible, highly reliable battery with motor and cognitive domain scores. Objective: To evaluate the relationship between neonatal neurobehavioral findings on the NNNS and measures of ventricular dilation and associated brain injury on HUS and MRI. Materials and Methods: Neonates with IVH and ventricular dilatation with and without posthemorrhagic hydrocephalus were enrolled. NNNS exams were performed at approximately term age equivalent. HUS indices were measured on the last HUS before initial neurosurgical procedure or that with worst ventriculomegaly if no intervention. The posterior fossa was assessed with MRI at term. Descriptive statistics including medians, interquartile ranges, means, and percentages were performed. Correlations were estimated using Pearson's method. Results: 28 patients had NNNS and HUS, and 18 patients also had an MRI. Ventricle size measures for the cohort were significantly above normal. Motor and cognitive subscores on the NNNS exam varied from established baseline scores for postmenstrual age. Children who required neurosurgical intervention had higher ventricle/brain ratios and worse NNNS habituation scores. Ventricle sizes were modestly correlated with motor abnormalities (0.24-0.59); larger anterior horn width correlated with nonoptimal reflexes, hypertonicity and hypotonicity. Ventricle sizes were modestly correlated with cognitive scores (-0.44 to 0.27); larger ventricular index correlated with worse attention. Periventricular hemorrhagic infarction correlated with worse habituation. Conclusion: For this cohort of preterm infants with IVH, surgical intervention for posthemorrhagic hydrocephalus correlated with both larger degrees of ventriculomegaly and worse NNNS exams. Findings on both HUS and MRI correlated with motor and cognitive abnormalities on neonatal neurobehavioral exam, suggesting that larger neonatal ventricle sizes and white matter injury have detectable correlates on exam. The NNNS exam provides important additional information when assessing posthemorrhagic ventricular dilation and hydrocephalus of prematurity.",Circulating Apoptotic Signals During Acute and Chronic Exposure to High Altitude in Kyrgyz Population.,https://www.ncbi.nlm.nih.gov/pubmed/30804801,Frontiers in physiology,2019 02 27,"Background: Circulating apoptotic signals (CASs) have been described in the pathologies associated with dysregulated apoptosis, such as cancer, heart diseases, and pulmonary hypertension (PH). However, nothing is known about the expression profiles of these markers in the circulation of humans exposed to acute and chronic effects of high altitude (HA). Methods: Gene expression levels of different apoptotic signals (ASs) were analyzed in human pulmonary artery smooth muscle cells (PASMCs) upon hypoxia incubation. In addition, we measured the plasma values of relevant CAS in Kyrgyz volunteers during acute and chronic exposure to HA. Finally, we analyzed the effects of pro-apoptotic mediator Fas ligand (FasL) on apoptosis and proliferation of human PASMCs. Results: Several cellular AS were increased in PASMCs exposed to hypoxia, in comparison to normoxia condition. Among analyzed CAS, there was a prominent reduction of FasL in lowlanders exposed to HA environment. Furthermore, decreased circulatory levels of FasL were found in highlanders with HA-induced PH (HAPH), as compared to the lowland controls. Furthermore, FasL concentration in plasma negatively correlated with tricuspid regurgitant gradient values. Finally, FasL exerted pro-apoptotic and anti-proliferative effects on PASMCs. Conclusion: Our data demonstrated that circulating levels of FasL are reduced during acute and chronic exposure to HA environment. In addition, dysregulated FasL may play a role in the context of HAPH due to its relevant functions on apoptosis and proliferation of PASMCs.",ECG Imaging to Detect the Site of Ventricular Ischemia Using Torso Electrodes: A Computational Study.,https://www.ncbi.nlm.nih.gov/pubmed/30804799,Frontiers in physiology,2019 02 27,"Electrocardiography provides some information useful for ischemic diagnosis. However, more recently there has been substantial growth in the area of ECG imaging, which by solving the inverse problem of electrocardiography aims to produce high-resolution mapping of the electrical and magnetic dynamics of the heart. Most inverse studies use the full resolution of the body surface potential (BSP) to reconstruct the epicardial potentials, however using a limited number of torso electrodes to interpolate the BSP is more clinically relevant and has an important effect on the reconstruction which must be quantified. A circular ischemic lesion on the right ventricle lateral wall 27 mm in radius is reconstructed using three Tikhonov methods along with 6 different electrode configurations ranging from 32 leads to 1,024 leads. The 2nd order Tikhonov solution performed the most accurately (~80% lesion identified) followed by the 1st (~50% lesion identified) and then the 0 order Tikhonov solution performed the worst with a maximum of ~30% lesion identified regardless of how many leads were used. With an increasing number of leads the solution produces less error, and the error becomes more localised around the lesion for all three regularisation methods. In noisy conditions, the relative performance gap of the 1st and 2nd order Tikhonov solutions was reduced, and determining an accurate regularisation parameter became relatively more difficult. Lesions located on the left ventricle walls were also able to be identified but comparatively to the right ventricle lateral wall performed marginally worse with lesions located on the interventricular septum being able to be indicated by the reconstructions but not successfully identified against the error. The quality of reconstruction was found to decrease as the lesion radius decreased, with a lesion radius of <20 mm becoming difficult to correctly identify against the error even when using >512 torso electrodes."

Immunocompromission due to transplant-related therapies and malignant cancer treatments are risk factors for invasive fungal infections, but also aggressive surgery, broad-spectrum antibiotics and prosthetic devices are frequently associated with infectious diseases. Current therapy is based on the administration of antifungal drugs, but the occurrence of resistant strains to the most common molecules has become a serious health-care problem. New antifungal agents are urgently needed and it is essential to identify fungal molecular targets that could offer alternatives for development of treatments. The fungal cell wall and plasma membrane are the most important structures that offer putative new targets which can be modulated in order to fight microbial infections. The development of monoclonal antibodies against new targets is a valid therapeutic strategy, both to solve resistance problems and to support the immune response, especially in immunocompromised hosts. In this review, we summarize currently used antifungal agents and propose novel therapeutic approaches, including new fungal molecular targets to be considered for drug development.",Cognitive Enhancer Effects of Low Memantine Doses Are Facilitated by an Alpha7 Nicotinic Acetylcholine Receptor Agonist in Scopolamine-Induced Amnesia in Rats.,https://www.ncbi.nlm.nih.gov/pubmed/30804787,Frontiers in pharmacology,2019 02 27,"Alpha7 nicotinic acetylcholine receptors (nAChRs) play an important role in learning and memory and are promising targets for pharmacological cognitive enhancement. Memantine, an approved substance for Alzheimer's disease treatment, is an antagonist of the N-Methyl-D-aspartate receptor (NMDAR) and also acts as an alpha7 nAChR antagonist. Here, we tested the interaction between an alpha7 nAChR agonist (PHA-543613) and memantine. Efficacy of memantine, PHA-543613, and their co-administration were investigated on the spatial working memory of rats using the spontaneous alternation paradigm in T-maze. Scopolamine-induced transient amnesia was used to model cognitive impairment. First, the dose-response relationship was assessed for memantine, and its lowest effective dose was found to be 0.1 mg/kg. Then, co-administration treatments with subeffective doses of the alpha7 nAChR agonist PHA-543613 and different doses of memantine were tested. The co-administration of subeffective drug doses significantly improved memory performance of the rats and reversed scopolamine-induced deficits. Interestingly, a higher than effective (0.3 mg/kg) dose of memantine did not increase performance in monotreatment, only in co-administration with PHA-543613. However, the co-administration of PHA-543613 did not further increase the efficacy of the previously effective monotreatment doses of memantine. Thus, the efficacy of memantine monotreatment and its co-administration with PHA-543613 converged to create a common ceiling effect, with an additive interaction found in the behavioral effects. These results suggest that memantine and PHA-543613 may exert their cognitive enhancer effects on the same target, possibly on the alpha7 nAChRs. Results also suggest possible benefits of a combination therapy with memantine and alpha7 nAChR agonists.",Pu-erh Tea Regulates Fatty Acid Metabolism in Mice Under High-Fat Diet.,https://www.ncbi.nlm.nih.gov/pubmed/30804786,Frontiers in pharmacology,2019 04 19,"Pu-erh tea has been extensively reported to possess lipid lowering effects but the underlying mechanisms remained unclear. Free fatty acids (FFAs) are generally correlated with the development of obesity, leading to increased risk for type 2 diabetes mellitus and cardiovascular diseases. To investigate whether Pu-erh tea treatment alters FA metabolism, we treated HFD induced obese mice with Pu-erh tea for 22 weeks and analyzed FFA profiles of experimental mice using a UPLC-QTOF-MS platform. Results showed remarkable changes in metabolic phenotypes and FFA compositions in mice treated with or without Pu-erh tea. HFD induced a marked obese phenotype in mice as revealed by significantly increased body weight, liver and adipose tissue weight, lipid levels in serum and liver, and these parameters were markedly reduced by Pu-erh tea treatment. Several FFA or FFA ratios, such as DGLA, palmitoleic acid, and OA/SA ratio, were significantly increased while the levels of SA/PA and AA/DGLA were significantly reduced in HFD-induced obese mice. Interestingly, these differential FFAs or FFA ratios were previous identified as key markers in human obese subjects, and their changes observed in the HFD group were reversed by Pu-erh tea treatment. Moreover, a panel of FFA markers including C20:3 n6/C18:3 n6 and C20:3 n6/C20:2 n6, C18:3 n6/C18:2 n6, C18:3 n3/C18:2 n6 and C24:1 n9/C22:1 n9, which were previously identified as biomarkers in predicting the remission of obesity and diabetes in human subjects who underwent metabolic surgery procedures, were reversed by Pu-erh tea intervention. Pu-erh tea significantly improved glucose homeostasis and insulin tolerance compared to the HFD group. Additionally, Pu-erh tea treatment significantly decreased FFA synthesis genes and increased the expression of genes involved in FFA uptake and β-oxidation including FATP2, FATP5, PPARα, CPT1α, and ACOX-1. These finding confirmed the beneficial effects of Pu-erh tea on regulating lipid and glucose metabolism, and further validated a panel of FFA markers with diagnostic and prognostic value for obesity and diabetes.",Fibroblast Growth Factors in Depression.,https://www.ncbi.nlm.nih.gov/pubmed/30804785,Frontiers in pharmacology,2019 02 27,"Major depressive disorder (MDD) is one of the most serious diseases and now becomes a major public health problem in the world.

Fibroblast growth factors (FGFs) belong to a large family of growth factors that are involved in brain development during early periods as well as maintenance and repair throughout adulthood. In recent years, studies have found a correlation between the members of the FGF system and depression. These signaling molecules may be expected to be biomarkers for the diagnosis and prognosis of MDD, and may provide new drug targets for the treatment of depression. Here, we reviewed the correlation between some members of the FGF system and depression.",The Regulatory Effects of Paeoniflorin and Its Derivative Paeoniflorin-6'-O-Benzene Sulfonate CP-25 on Inflammation and Immune Diseases.,https://www.ncbi.nlm.nih.gov/pubmed/30804784,Frontiers in pharmacology,2019 02 27,"The plant extract ""total glucosides of peony"" (TGP) constitutes a mixture of glycosides that is isolated from the roots of the well-known traditional Chinese herb Paeonia lactiflora Pall.

Pharmacologically, Pae exhibits powerful anti-inflammatory and immune regulatory effects in some animal models of autoimmune diseases including Rheumatoid Arthritis (RA) and Systemic Lupus Erythematosus (SLE). Recently, we modified Pae with an addition of benzene sulfonate to achieve better bioavailability and higher anti-inflammatory immune regulatory effects. This review summarizes the pharmacological activities of Pae and the novel anti-inflammatory and immunomodulatory agent Paeoniflorin-6'-O-benzenesulfonate (CP-25) in various chronic inflammatory and autoimmune disorders.

Mechanism-based information derived from expression (transcriptomic) data, in combination with machine-learning methods, promises to improve the accuracy and robustness of current toxicity prediction models. Deep neural networks (DNNs) have the advantage of automatically assembling the relevant features from a large number of input features. This makes them especially suitable for modeling transcriptomic data, which typically contain thousands of features. Here, we gaged gene- and pathway-level feature selection schemes using single- and multi-task DNN approaches in predicting chemically induced liver injuries (biliary hyperplasia, fibrosis, and necrosis) from whole-genome DNA microarray data. The single-task DNN models showed high predictive accuracy and endpoint specificity, with Matthews correlation coefficients for the three endpoints on 10-fold cross validation ranging from 0.56 to 0.89, with an average of 0.74 in the best feature sets. The DNN models outperformed Random Forest models in cross validation and showed better performance than Support Vector Machine models when tested in the external validation datasets. In the cross validation studies, the effect of the feature selection scheme was negligible among the studied feature sets. Further evaluation of the models on their ability to predict the injury phenotype per se for non-chemically induced injuries revealed the robust performance of the DNN models across these additional external testing datasets. Thus, the DNN models learned features specific to the injury phenotype contained in the gene expression data.",Treating Chronic Migraine With Neuromodulation: The Role of Neurophysiological Abnormalities and Maladaptive Plasticity.,https://www.ncbi.nlm.nih.gov/pubmed/30804782,Frontiers in pharmacology,2019 02 27,"Chronic migraine (CM) is the most disabling form of migraine, because pharmacological treatments have low efficacy and cumbersome side effects. New evidence has shown that migraine is primarily a disorder of brain plasticity and migraine chronification depends on a maladaptive process favoring the development of a brain state of hyperexcitability. Due to the ability to induce plastic changes in the brain, researchers started to look at Non-Invasive Brain Stimulation (NIBS) as a possible therapeutic option in migraine field. On one side, NIBS techniques induce changes of neural plasticity that outlast the period of the stimulation (a fundamental prerequisite of a prophylactic migraine treatment, concurrently they allow targeting neurophysiological abnormalities that contribute to the transition from episodic to CM. The action may thus influence not only the cortex but also brainstem and diencephalic structures. Plus, NIBS is not burdened by serious medication side effects and drug-drug interactions. Although the majority of the studies reported somewhat beneficial effects in migraine patients, no standard intervention has been defined. This may be due to methodological differences regarding the used techniques (e.g., transcranial magnetic stimulation, transcranial direct current stimulation), the brain regions chosen as targets, and the stimulation types (e.g., the use of inhibitory and excitatory stimulations on the basis of opposite rationales), and an intrinsic variability of stimulation effect. Hence, it is difficult to draw a conclusion on the real effect of neuromodulation in migraine. In this article, we first will review the definition and mechanisms of brain plasticity, some neurophysiological hallmarks of migraine, and migraine chronification-related (dys)plasticity. Secondly, we will review available results from therapeutic and physiological studies using neuromodulation in CM. Lastly we will discuss the results obtained in these preventive trials in the light of a possible effect on brain plasticity.",The Ethanolic Extract of Caesalpinia sappan Heartwood Inhibits Cerebral Ischemia/Reperfusion Injury in a Rat Model Through a Multi-Targeted Pharmacological Mechanism.,https://www.ncbi.nlm.nih.gov/pubmed/30804781,Frontiers in pharmacology,2019 02 27,"Background:Caesalpinia sappan L. (C. sappan) is a traditional Chinese medicinal plant. The dried heartwood of C. sappan (also known as Sappan wood) has been widely used for the folkloric medical treatment of ischemic cerebral stroke in China. However, the detailed underlying pharmacological mechanism still remains largely unexplored. Methods: In this study, a middle cerebral artery occlusion (MCAO) rat model was employed to elucidate the mechanism of the anti-cerebral ischemic effects of C. sappan ethanolic extract (CEE). Moreover, systemic multi-target identification coupled with gene ontology biological process (GO BP) and reactome pathway analysis was used to investigate the potential neuroprotective mechanism. Furthermore, the presumed mechanism was confirmed through biological analysis by determining the effects of CEE on the identified signaling pathways in PC12 cells model-induced by oxygen-glucose deprivation/reperfusion (OGD/R). Results: Our study demonstrates that CEE (both through in vivo administration at a dosage of 300 mg/kg and through in vitro incubation at a dosage of 2.4 μg/mL) is a neuroprotective agent that can effectively inhibit neuronal damage, promote synaptic generation, and suppress the activation of neutrophils, microglia, and astrocytes. Moreover, the neuroprotective mechanism of CEE is mediated via regulating 150 potential target proteins, which are associated with 6 biological processes and 10 pathways, including JAK-STAT, HSP90 and DNA damage/telomere stress. Conclusion: CEE can exert neuroprotective effect through multi-target pharmacological mechanisms to prevent ischemia/reperfusion-induced cerebral injury.","Ferulic Acid Protects Hyperglycemia-Induced Kidney Damage by Regulating Oxidative Insult, Inflammation and Autophagy.",https://www.ncbi.nlm.nih.gov/pubmed/30804780,Frontiers in pharmacology,2019 02 27,"Oxidative insult, inflammation, apoptosis and autophagy play a pivotal role in the etiology of diabetic nephropathy, a global health concern. Ferulic acid, a phytochemical, is reported to protect against varied diseased conditions. However, the ameliorative role and mechanisms of ferulic acid in averting STZ-mediated nephrotoxicity largely remains unknown. For in vivo study, a single intraperitoneal injection of streptozotocin (50 mg kg-1 body wt.) was administered in experimental rats to induce diabetes. The diabetic rats exhibited a rise in blood glucose level as well as kidney to body weight ratio, a decrease in serum insulin level, severe kidney tissue damage and dysfunction. Elevation of intracellular ROS level, altered mitochondrial membrane potential and cellular redox balance impairment shown the participation of oxidative stress in hyperglycemia-triggered renal injury. Treatment with ferulic acid (50 mg kg-1 body wt., orally for 8 weeks), post-diabetic induction, could markedly ameliorate kidney injury, renal cell apoptosis, inflammation and defective autophagy in the kidneys. The underlying mechanism for such protection involved the modulation of AGEs, MAPKs (p38, JNK, and ERK 1/2), NF-κB mediated inflammatory pathways, mitochondria-dependent and -independent apoptosis as well as autophagy induction. In cultured NRK-52E cells, ferulic acid (at an optimum dose of 75 μM) could counter excessive ROS generation, induce autophagy and inhibit apoptotic death of cells under high glucose environment. Blockade of autophagy could significantly eradicate the protective effect of ferulic acid in high glucose-mediated cell death. Together, the study confirmed that ferulic acid, exhibiting hypoglycemic, antioxidant, anti-inflammatory, anti-apoptotic activities and role in autophagy, could circumvent oxidative stress-mediated renal cell damage.",Gender Differences in Outpatient Pediatric Drug Utilization: A Cohort Study From Southern Italy.,https://www.ncbi.nlm.nih.gov/pubmed/30804779,Frontiers in pharmacology,2019 02 27,"Objective: The aim of this retrospective population-based cohort study is to in-depth investigate gender-specific drug utilization pattern in pediatric outpatient population. Methods: By using a large administrative database of the Local Health Unit of Caserta (Southern Italy), a pediatric cohort from the birth to 18 years was observed over 6 years (from 1st January 2010 to 31st December 2015). Yearly prevalence of drug use per 100 inhabitants as well as the median number of prescriptions was stratifying by gender. Prevalence of acute and recurrent use of the most frequently used active substances was calculated for the year 2015. Results: A decreasing trend in prevalence of drug use (-3.2%, with a reduction of median number of drugs dispensed) was observed in children for both sexes, from 2010 to 2015. In 2015, the drug classes most commonly used among children of any age were modestly but consistently prescribed more to males than to females: systemic anti-infective drugs (M = 43.5%; F = 42.3%), respiratory tract drugs (M = 29.0%; F = 26.1%), and hormones (M = 13.1%; F = 11.3%). Irrespective of gender, beclomethasone was the most utilized active substance in the first 2 years of life, while thereafter amoxicillin/clavulanate in combination. Conclusions: In a large population of pediatric outpatients no major difference was seen between genders, although commonly used drug classes; in particular, antibiotics, respiratory tract drugs and Hormones with corticosteroids for systemic use prescribed modestly but consistently to larger extent in males than females."

A major function of the hippocampus is to form associations between individual elements of experience. However, the effect of direct hippocampal stimulation on associative memory remains largely inconclusive, with most evidence coming from studies employing non-invasive stimulation. Here, we therefore tested the hypothesis that direct electrical stimulation of the hippocampus specifically enhances hippocampal-dependent associative memory. To test this hypothesis, we recruited surgical patients with implanted subdural electrodes to perform a word pair memory task during which the hippocampus was stimulated. Our results indicate that stimulation of the hippocampus during encoding helped to build strong associative memories and enhanced recollection in subsequent trials. Moreover, stimulation significantly increased theta power in the lateral middle temporal cortex during successful memory encoding. Overall, our findings indicate that hippocampal stimulation positively impacts performance during a word pair memory task, suggesting that successful memory encoding involves the temporal cortex, which may act together with the hippocampus.",Neural Correlates of Workload Transition in Multitasking: An ACT-R Model of Hysteresis Effect.,https://www.ncbi.nlm.nih.gov/pubmed/30804767,Frontiers in human neuroscience,2019 02 28,"This study investigated the effect of task demand transitions at multiple levels of analysis including behavioral performance, subjective rating, and brain effective connectivity, while comparing human data to Adaptive Control of Thought-Rational (ACT-R) simulated data. Three stages of task demand were designed and performed sequentially (Low-High-Low) during AF-MATB tasks, and the differences in neural connectivity during workload transition were identified. The NASA Task Load Index (NASA-TLX) and the Instantaneous Self-Assessment (ISA) were used to measure the subjective mental workload that accompanies the hysteresis effect in the task demand transitions. The results found significant hysteresis effects on performance and various brain network measures such as outflow of the prefrontal cortex and connectivity magnitude. These findings would assist in clarifying the direction and strength of the Granger Causality under demand transitions. As a result, these findings involving the neural mechanisms of hysteresis effects in multitasking environments may be utilized in applications of neuroergonomics research. The ability to compare data derived from human participants to data gathered by the ACT-R model allows researchers to better account for hysteresis effects in neuro-cognitive models in the future.",Single Prolonged Stress as a Prospective Model for Posttraumatic Stress Disorder in Females.,https://www.ncbi.nlm.nih.gov/pubmed/30804766,Frontiers in behavioral neuroscience,2019 02 27,"Sex plays an important role in susceptibility to stress triggered disorders. Posttraumatic Stress disorder (PTSD), a debilitating psychiatric disorder developed after exposure to a traumatic event, is two times more prevalent in women than men. However, the vast majority of animal models of PTSD, including single prolonged stress (SPS), were performed mostly with males. Here, we evaluated SPS as an appropriate PTSD model for females in terms of anxiety, depressive symptoms and changes in gene expression in the noradrenergic system in the brain. In addition, we examined intranasal neuropeptide Y (NPY) as a possible treatment in females. Female rats were subjected to SPS and given either intranasal NPY or vehicle in two separate experiments. In the first experiment, stressed females were compared to unstressed controls on forced swim test (FST) and for levels of expression of several genes in the locus coeruleus (LC) 12 days after SPS exposure. Using a separate cohort of animals, experiment two examined stressed females and unstressed controls on the elevated plus maze (EPM) and LC gene expression 7 days after SPS stressors. SPS led to increased anxiety-like behavior on EPM and depressive-like behavior on FST. Following FST, the rats displayed elevated tyrosine hydroxylase (TH), CRHR1 and Y1R mRNA levels in the LC, consistent with increased activation of the noradrenergic system. The expression level of these mRNAs was unchanged following EPM, except Y1R. Intranasal NPY at the doses shown to be effective in males, did not prevent development of depressive or anxiety-like behavior or molecular changes in the LC. The results indicate that while SPS could be an appropriate PTSD model for females, sex differences, such as response to NPY, are important to consider.",Neonatal NR3C1 Methylation and Social-Emotional Development at 6 and 18 Months of Age.,https://www.ncbi.nlm.nih.gov/pubmed/30804765,Frontiers in behavioral neuroscience,2019 06 10,"The variation in childhood social-emotional development within at-risk populations may be attributed in part to epigenetic mechanisms such as DNA methylation (DNAm) that respond to environmental stressors. These mechanisms may partially underlie the degree of vulnerability (and resilience) to negative social-emotional development within adverse psychosocial environments. Extensive research supports an association between maternal adversity and offspring DNAm of the NR3C1 gene, which encodes the glucocorticoid receptor (GR). A gap in knowledge remains regarding the relationship between NR3C1 DNAm, measured in neonatal (1-month of age) buccal cells, and subsequent social-emotional development during infancy and early childhood. We conducted a longitudinal cohort study of n = 53 mother-child dyads (n = 30 with developmental outcomes formed the basis of current study) who were enrolled in a home visiting (HV) program. Higher mean DNAm of the NR3C1 exon 1F promoter was significantly associated with lower 6-month Ages and Stages Questionnaire: Social-Emotional (ASQ:SE) scores-more positive infant social-emotional functioning. A similar trend was observed at 18-months of age in a smaller sample (n = 12). The findings of this pilot study indicate that in a diverse and disadvantaged population, the level of neonatal NR3C1 DNAm is related to later social-emotional development. Limitations and implications for future research are discussed.",Residual Information of Previous Decision Affects Evidence Accumulation in Current Decision.,https://www.ncbi.nlm.nih.gov/pubmed/30804764,Frontiers in behavioral neuroscience,2019 02 27,"Bias in perceptual decisions can be generally defined as an effect which is controlled by factors other than the decision-relevant information (e.g., perceptual information in a perceptual task, when trials are independent). The literature on decision-making suggests two main hypotheses to account for this kind of bias: internal bias signals are derived from (a) the residual of motor signals generated to report a decision in the past, and (b) the residual of sensory information extracted from the stimulus in the past. Beside these hypotheses, this study suggests that making a decision in the past per se may bias the next decision. We demonstrate the validity of this assumption, first, by performing behavioral experiments based on the two-alternative forced-choice (TAFC) discrimination of motion direction paradigms and, then, we modified the pure drift-diffusion model (DDM) based on the accumulation-to-bound mechanism to account for the sequential effect. In both cases, the trace of the previous trial influences the current decision. Results indicate that the probability of being correct in the current decision increases if it is in line with the previously made decision even in the presence of feedback. Moreover, a modified model that keeps the previous decision information in the starting point of evidence accumulation provides a better fit to the behavioral data. Our findings suggest that the accumulated evidence in the decision-making process after crossing the bound in the previous decision can affect the parameters of information accumulation for the current decision in consecutive trials.",Multimodal Integration and Phenomenal Spatiotemporal Binding: A Perspective From the Default Space Theory.,https://www.ncbi.nlm.nih.gov/pubmed/30804763,Frontiers in integrative neuroscience,2019 02 27,"How does the integrated and unified conscious experience arise from the vastly distributed activities of the nervous system? How is the information from the many cones of the retina bound with information coming from the cochlea to create the association of sounds with objects in visual space? In this perspective article, we assert a novel viewpoint on the ""binding problem"" in which we explain a metastable operation of the brain and body that may provide insight into this problem. In our view which is a component of the Default Space Theory (DST), consciousness arises from a metastable synchronization of local computations into a global coherence by a framework of widespread slow and ultraslow oscillations coordinated by the thalamus. We reinforce a notion shared by some consciousness researchers such as Revonsuo and the Fingelkurts that a spatiotemporal matrix is the foundation of phenomenological experience and that this phenomenology is directly tied to bioelectric operations of the nervous system. Through the oscillatory binding system we describe, cognitive neuroscientists may be able to more accurately correlate bioelectric activity of the brain and body with the phenomenology of human experience.",Action Observation With Dual Task for Improving Cognitive Abilities in Parkinson's Disease: A Pilot Study.,https://www.ncbi.nlm.nih.gov/pubmed/30804762,Frontiers in systems neuroscience,2019 02 27,"Action observation therapy (AOT) has been recently proposed as a new rehabilitation approach for treatment of motor deficits in Parkinson's disease. To date, this approach has never been used to deal with cognitive deficits (e.g., deficits in working memory, attention), which are impairments that are increasingly recognized in Parkinsonian patients. Typically, patients affected by these dysfunctions have difficulty filtering out irrelevant information and tend to lose track of the task goal. In this paper, we propose that AOT may also be used to improve cognitive abilities of Parkinsonian patients if it is used within a dual task framework. We articulate our hypothesis by pivoting on recent findings and on preliminary results that were obtained through a pilot study that was designed to test the efficacy of a long-term rehabilitation program that, for the first time, uses AOT within a dual task framework for treating cognitive deficits in patients with Parkinson's disease. Ten Parkinson's disease patients underwent a 45-min treatment that consisted in watching a video of an actor performing a daily-life activity and then executing it while performing distractive tasks (AOT with dual task). The treatment was repeated three times per week for a total of 4 weeks. Patients' cognitive/motor features were evaluated through standard tests four times: 1 month before treatment, the first and the last day of treatment and 1 month after treatment. The results show that this approach may provide relevant improvements in cognitive aspects related to working memory (verbal and visuospatial memory) and attention. We discuss these results by pivoting on literature on action observation and recent literature demonstrating that the dual task method can be used to stimulate cognition and concentration. In particular, we propose that using AOT together with a dual task may train the brain systems supporting executive functions through two mechanisms: (i) stimulation of goal setting within the mirror neuron system through action observation and (ii) working memory and persistent goal maintenance through dual task stimuli.","Glomerular Organization of the Antennal Lobes of the Diamondback Moth, Plutella xylostella L.",https://www.ncbi.nlm.nih.gov/pubmed/30804761,Frontiers in neuroanatomy,2019 02 27,"The antennal lobe of the moth brain is the primary olfactory center processing information concerning pheromones and plant odors. Plutella xylostella is a major worldwide pest of cruciferous vegetables and its behavior is highly dependent on their olfactory system. However, detailed knowledge of the anatomy and function of the P. xylostella olfactory system remains limited. In the present study, we present the 3-Dimentional (3-D) map of the antennal lobe of P. xylostella, based on confocal microscopic analysis of glomerular segmentation and Neurobiotin backfills of Olfactory Receptor Neurons (ORNs). We identified 74-76 ordinary glomeruli and a macroglomerular complex (MGC) situated at the entrance of the antennal nerve in males. The MGC contained three glomeruli. The volumes of glomeruli in males ranged from 305.83 ± 129.53 to 25440.00 ± 1377.67 μm3. In females, 74-77 glomeruli were found, with the largest glomerulus ELG being situated at the entrance of the antennal nerve. The volumes of glomeruli in females ranged from 802.17 ± 95.68 to 8142.17 ± 509.46 μm3. Sexual dimorphism was observed in anomalous supernumerary, anomalous missing, shape, size, and array of several of the identified glomeruli in both sexes. All glomeruli, except one in the antennal lobe (AL), received projections of antennal ORNs. The glomeruli PV1 in both sexes received input from the labial palp nerve and was assumed as the labial pit organ glomerulus (LPOG). These results provide a foundation for better understanding of coding mechanisms of odors in this important pest insect.",DVID: Distributed Versioned Image-Oriented Dataservice.,https://www.ncbi.nlm.nih.gov/pubmed/30804760,Frontiers in neural circuits,2019 03 06,"Open-source software development has skyrocketed in part due to community tools like github.com, which allows publication of code as well as the ability to create branches and push accepted modifications back to the original repository. As the number and size of EM-based datasets increases, the connectomics community faces similar issues when we publish snapshot data corresponding to a publication. Ideally, there would be a mechanism where remote collaborators could modify branches of the data and then flexibly reintegrate results via moderated acceptance of changes. The DVID system provides a web-based connectomics API and the first steps toward such a distributed versioning approach to EM-based connectomics datasets. Through its use as the central data resource for Janelia's FlyEM team, we have integrated the concepts of distributed versioning into reconstruction workflows, allowing support for proofreader training and segmentation experiments through branched, versioned data. DVID also supports persistence to a variety of storage systems from high-speed local SSDs to cloud-based object stores, which allows its deployment on laptops as well as large servers. The tailoring of the backend storage to each type of connectomics data leads to efficient storage and fast queries.

We propose here a model of how this may be done, thanks to the unique synaptic morphology of the CL and its excitatory and inhibitory connections with most cortical areas. Using serial visual search as an example, we describe how the functional anatomy of the claustral connections can potentially execute the sequential activation of the representations of objects that are being processed serially. We also propose that cross-frequency coupling (CFC) between low frequency signals from CL and higher frequency oscillations in the cortical areas will be an efficient means of CL modulating neural activity across multiple brain regions in synchrony. This model is applicable to the wide range of functions one performs, from simple object recognition to reading and writing, listening to or performing music, etc."

Some peripherally produced cytokines, such as TNF-α, can cross the blood brain barrier and result in activation of brain microglia which produces additional TNF-α and fosters a cascade of events including decreases in markers of synaptic plasticity and increases in neurodegenerative events. This is exemplified by preclinical studies, which show that peripheral administration of pro-inflammatory cytokines can elicit depression-like behavior. Importantly, this depression-like behavior can be ameliorated by anti-cytokine therapies. Work in our laboratory suggests that TNF-α is particularly important for the development of a depressive phenotype and that TNF-α antagonists might have promise as novel antidepressant drugs. Future research should examine rates of inflammation at baseline in depressed patients and whether anti-inflammatory agents could be included as part of the treatment regimen for depressive disorders.",Following the Majority: Social Influence in Trusting Behavior.,https://www.ncbi.nlm.nih.gov/pubmed/30804747,Frontiers in neuroscience,2019 02 27,"When making decisions, people may change their behavior, sometimes against their personal preference, according to the opinions of peers. However, the effect of social influence on trust is still unknown. In our study, we used the event-related functional magnetic resonance imaging to investigate brain activity in social influence during a trust game. The behavioral results revealed that people tend to conform to others' opinions and behaviors in a trust game. Decreased activations were observed in superior temporal gyrus during processing of social influences. Moreover, brain regions supporting value processing and reward learning were activated when subjects decided to follow the majority. These regions include the ventral medial prefrontal cortex, ventral striatum, and parahippocampal gyrus. Finally, our exploratory analysis revealed an increase in functional connectivity between the prefrontal cortex and the ventral striatum during conformity in trusting behavior. These findings indicate that the neural basis of social influence in trusting behavior are similar to the mechanisms implicated in reward learning. The brain regions involved in reward learning might reflect the reward value of agreeing with others in our study.",Vagal Nerve Stimulation Attenuates Ischemia-Reperfusion Induced Retina Dysfunction in Acute Ocular Hypertension.,https://www.ncbi.nlm.nih.gov/pubmed/30804746,Frontiers in neuroscience,2019 02 27,"Purpose: The present study aimed to investigate whether cervical vagal nerve stimulation (VNS) could prevent retinal ganglion cell (RGC) loss and retinal dysfunction after ischemia/reperfusion (I/R) injury. Methods: First, rats were randomly divided into sham group (n = 4) and VNS group (n = 12). Activation of the nodose ganglia (NOG), nucleus of the solitary tract (NTS), superior salivatory nucleus (SSN), and pterygopalatine ganglion (PPG) neural circuit were evaluated by c-fos expression at 0 h after sham VNS and at 0 h (n = 4), 6 h (n = 4), 72 h (n = 4) after VNS. Secondly, rats were randomly assigned to I/R group (pressure-induced retinal ischemia for 1 h and reperfusion for 1 h in the right eye, n = 16) and I/R+VNS group (right cervical VNS for 2 h during the I/R period, n = 16). The left eye of each rat served as a control. Electroretinogram (ERG), RGC numbers, tumor necrosis factor-α (TNF-α) and vasoactive intestinal polypeptide (VIP) levels in retina were determined. Additionally, the level of VIP in PPG was evaluated. Results: In the first part of the study, compared with the sham group, the VNS group exhibited significantly increased expression of c-fos in NOG, NTS, SSN, and PPG tissues at 0, 6, and 72 h. In the second part of the study, compared with left eyes, retinal function in right eyes (as assessed by the a-wave, b-wave and the oscillatory potential amplitudes of ERG and RGC data) was significantly decreased by I/R. The decreased retinal function was attenuated by VNS. In addition, I/R induced an increase in inflammation, which was reflected by elevated TNF-α expression in the retina. VNS significantly attenuated the increase in I/R-induced inflammation. Moreover, VIP expression in the retina and PPG, which may contribute to the inhibition of the inflammatory response, was significantly increased after VNS. Conclusion: VNS could protect against retinal I/R injury by downregulating TNF-α. Upregulation of VIP expression due to activation of the NOG-NTS-SSN-PPG neural circuit may underlie to the protective effects of VNS.",Oxidative Stress Related to Iron Metabolism in Relapsing Remitting Multiple Sclerosis Patients With Low Disability.,https://www.ncbi.nlm.nih.gov/pubmed/30804745,Frontiers in neuroscience,2019 02 27,"Oxidative status may play a role in chronic inflammation and neurodegeneration which are considered critical etiopathogenetic factors in Multiple Sclerosis (MS), both in the early phase of the disease and in the progressive one. The aim of this study is to explore oxidative status related to iron metabolism in peripheral blood of stable Relapsing-Remitting MS with low disability. We studied 60 Relapsing-Remitting MS patients (age 37.2 ± 9.06, EDSS median 1.0), and 40 healthy controls (age 40.3 ± 10.86). We measured total hydroperoxides (dROMs test) and Total Antioxidant Status (TAS), along with the iron metabolism biomarkers: Iron (Fe), ferritin (Ferr), transferrin (Tf), transferrin saturation (Tfsat), and ceruloplasmin (Cp) panel biomarkers [concentration (iCp) and enzymatic activity (eCp), copper (Cu), ceruloplasmin specific activity (eCp:iCp), copper to ceruloplasmin ratio (Cu:Cp), non-ceruloplasmin copper (nCp-Cu)]. We computed also the Cp:Tf ratio as an index of oxidative stress related to iron metabolism. We found lower TAS levels in MS patients than in healthy controls (CTRL) and normal reference level and higher dROMs and Cp:Tf ratio in MS than in healthy controls. Cp and Cu were higher in MS while biomarkers of iron metabolism were not different between patients and controls. Both in controls and MS, dROMs correlated with iCp (CTRL r = 0.821, p < 0.001; MS r = 0.775 p < 0.001) and eCp (CTRL r = 0.734, p < 0.001; MS r = 0.820 p < 0.001). Moreover, only in MS group iCp correlated negatively with Tfsat (r = -0.257, p = 0.047). Dividing MS patients in ""untreated"" group and ""treated"" group, we found a significant difference in Fe values [F(2, 97) = 10.136, p < 0.001]; in particular ""MS untreated"" showed higher mean values (mean = 114.5, SD = 39.37 μg/dL) than CTRL (mean 78.6, SD = 27.55 μg/dL p = 0.001) and ""MS treated"" (mean = 72.4, SD = 38.08 μg/dL; p < 0.001). Moreover, ""MS untreated"" showed significantly higher values of Cp:Tf (mean = 10.19, SD = 1.77∗10-2; p = 0.015), than CTRL (mean = 9.03, SD = 1.46 ∗10-2). These results suggest that chronic oxidative stress is relevant also in the remitting phase of the disease in patients with low disability and short disease duration. Therefore, treatment with antioxidants may be beneficial also in the early stage of the disease to preserve neuronal reserve.",MEG/EEG Group Analysis With Brainstorm.,https://www.ncbi.nlm.nih.gov/pubmed/30804744,Frontiers in neuroscience,2019 02 28,"Brainstorm is a free, open-source Matlab and Java application for multimodal electrophysiology data analytics and source imaging [primarily MEG, EEG and depth recordings, and integration with MRI and functional near infrared spectroscopy (fNIRS)].

In particular, estimation of fingertip relative position likely involves more complex sensorimotor transformations than those underlying hand or arm position sense: the brain has to estimate where each fingertip is relative to the hand and where fingertips are relative to each other. It has been demonstrated that during grasping, feedback of digit position drives rapid adjustments of fingers force control. However, it has been shown that estimation of fingertips' relative position can be biased by digit forces. These findings raise the question of how the brain combines concurrent tactile (i.e., cutaneous mechanoreceptors afferents induced by skin pressure and stretch) and non-tactile (i.e., both descending motor command and joint/muscle receptors signals associated to muscle contraction) digit force-related inputs for fingertip distance estimation. Here we addressed this question by quantifying the contribution of tactile and non-tactile force-related inputs for the estimation of fingertip relative position. We asked subjects to match fingertip vertical distance relying only on either tactile or non-tactile inputs from the thumb and index fingertip, and compared their performance with the condition where both types of inputs were combined. We found that (a) the bias in the estimation of fingertip distance persisted when tactile inputs and non-tactile force-related signals were presented in isolation; (b) tactile signals contributed the most to the estimation of fingertip distance; (c) linear summation of the matching errors relying only on either tactile or non-tactile inputs was comparable to the matching error when both inputs were simultaneously available. These findings reveal a greater role of tactile signals for sensing fingertip distance and suggest a linear integration mechanism with non-tactile inputs for the estimation of fingertip relative position.",The anx/anx Mouse - A Valuable Resource in Anorexia Nervosa Research.,https://www.ncbi.nlm.nih.gov/pubmed/30804742,Frontiers in neuroscience,2019 02 27,"Animal models are invaluable resources in research concerning the neurobiology of anorexia nervosa (AN), to a large extent since valid clinical samples are rare. None of the existing models can capture all aspects of AN but they are able to mirror the core features of the disorder e.g., elective starvation, emaciation and premature death. The anorectic anx/anx mouse is of particular value for the understanding of the abnormal response to negative energy balance seen in AN. These mice appear normal at birth but gradually develops starvation and emaciation despite full access to food, and die prematurely around three weeks of age. Several changes in hypothalamic neuropeptidergic and -transmitter systems involved in regulating food intake and metabolism have been documented in the anx/anx mouse. These changes are accompanied by signs of inflammation and degeneration in the same hypothalamic regions; including activation of microglia cells and expression of major histocompatibility complex I by microglia and selective neuronal populations. These aberrances are likely related to the dysfunction of complex I (CI) in the oxidative phosphorylation system of the mitochondria, and subsequent increased oxidative stress, which also has been revealed in the hypothalamus of these mice. Interestingly, a similar CI dysfunction has been shown in leukocytes from patients with AN. In addition, a higher expression of the Neurotrophic Receptor Tyrosine Kinase 3 gene has been shown in the anx/anx hypothalamus. This agrees with AN being associated with specific variants of the genes for brain derived neurotrophic factor and Neurotrophic Receptor Tyrosine Kinase 2. The anx/anx mouse is also glucose intolerant and display pancreatic dysfunction related to increased levels of circulating free fatty acids (FFA) and pancreatic inflammation. An increased incidence of eating disorders has been reported for young diabetic women, and as well has increased levels of circulating FFAs in AN. Also similar to individuals with AN, the anx/anx mouse has reduced leptin and increased cholesterol levels in serum. Thus, the anx/anx mouse shares several characteristics with patients with AN, including emaciation, starvation, premature death, diabetic features, increased FFA and low leptin, and is therefore a unique resource in research on the (neuro)biology of AN.",Sex Hormones and Optic Nerve Disorders: A Review.,https://www.ncbi.nlm.nih.gov/pubmed/30804741,Frontiers in neuroscience,2019 02 27,"Aim: This review article presents a comprehensive overview of the literature on sex hormones (estrogens, androgens, progesterone) and optic nerve disorders, with a discussion of the implications for therapy and prevention. Methods: Epidemiological, pre-clinical and clinical studies were reviewed. Results: Analysis of the biological basis for a relationship between eye diseases and sex hormones showed that some types of hormones can exert a protective effect either directly on the retina and optic nerve or indirectly by modulating ocular blood flow. For example, it seems that estrogen exposure has a protective effect against glaucoma, whereas its deficit may lead to early onset of the disease. If further studies confirm the data in the literature, estrogen therapy, because of its antioxidant action, may be effective in the treatment of Leber's hereditary optic neuropathy, whereas, in the light of current studies, there does not seem to be an influence of estrogen on non-arteritic anterior ischemic optic neuritis (NAION). Conclusions: Although there is some evidence that in some optic nerve pathologies the sex hormones seem to play an important role there are still too few studies providing evidence for its wider use in clinical practice.",Dysconnectivity of Multiple Resting-State Networks Associated With Higher-Order Functions in Sensorineural Hearing Loss.,https://www.ncbi.nlm.nih.gov/pubmed/30804740,Frontiers in neuroscience,2019 02 27,"Objects: Sensorineural hearing loss (SNHL) involves wide-ranging functional reorganization, and is associated with accumulating risk of cognitive and emotional dysfunction.

Results: Using independent component analysis, 11 RSNs were identified. Relative to the healthy controls, patients with SNHL presented apparent abnormalities of intra-network FC involving right frontoparietal network, posterior temporal network, and sensory motor network. Disrupted between-network FC was also revealed in the SNHL patients across both higher-order cognitive control networks and multiple sensory networks. Eight of the eleven RSNs showed altered functional synchronization using a seed network to whole brain FC method, particularly in the ventromedial prefrontal cortex. In addition, these functional abnormalities were correlated with cognition- and emotion-related performances. Interpretations: These findings supported our hypotheses that long-term SNHL involves notable dysconnectivity of multiple RSNs. Our study provides important insights into the pathophysiological mechanisms of SNHL, and sheds lights on the neural substrates underlying the possible cognitive and emotional dysfunctions following SNHL.",Randomized Controlled Trial of Physical Exercise in Diabetic Veterans With Length-Dependent Distal Symmetric Polyneuropathy.,https://www.ncbi.nlm.nih.gov/pubmed/30804739,Frontiers in neuroscience,2019 02 28,"Rationale: Physical exercise is an essential adjunct to the management of patients with type 2 diabetes mellitus. Therapeutic interventions that improve blood flow to peripheral nerves, such as exercise, may slow the progression of neuropathy in the diabetic patient. Aims: This randomized clinical trial was conducted to determine whether a structured program of aerobic, isokinetic strength, or the combination of aerobic-isokinetic strength exercise intervention alters peripheral nerve function in glycemic-controlled diabetic patients with advanced length-dependent distal symmetric polyneuropathy. Methods: Forty-five patients with type 2 diabetes mellitus exhibiting tight glycemic control (HbA1c intergroup range 7.2-8.0%) were randomized by block design across four experimental groups: sedentary controls (n = 12), aerobic exercise (n = 11), isokinetic strength (n = 11), or the combination of aerobic-isokinetic strength training (n = 11). Patients randomized to training groups exercised 3× per week for 12 weeks, whereas patients randomized to the sedentary control group received standard of care. To minimize attention and educational bias, all patients attended a 12-session health promotion educational series. At baseline, immediately following intervention, and again at 12-week post-intervention, detailed nerve conduction studies were conducted as a primary outcome measure. At these same intervals, all patients completed as secondary measures quantitative sensory testing, symptom-limited treadmill stress tests, and a Short-Form 36-Veterans Questionnaire (SF-36V). Results: Of the 45 patients randomized into this study, 37 (82%) had absent sural nerve responses, 19 (42%) had absent median sensory nerve responses, and 17 (38%) had absent ulnar sensory nerve responses. By comparison, responses from tibial nerves were absent in only three (7%) subjects while responses from peroneal nerves were absent in five (11%) subjects. Eleven (92%) of 12 patients that had volunteered to be biopsied exhibited abnormal levels of epidermal nerve fiber densities. Exercise, regardless of type, did not alter sensory or motor nerve electrodiagnostic findings among those patients exhibiting measurable responses (ANOVA). There was, however, a modest (p = 0.01) beneficial effect of exercise on sensory nerve function (Fisher's Exact Test). Importantly, the beneficial effect of exercise on sensory nerve function was enhanced (p = 0.03) during the post-intervention interval. In addition, three of six patients that had undergone exercise intervention exhibited a marked 1.9 ± 0.3-fold improvement in epidermal nerve fiber density. By comparison, none of three sedentary patients whom agreed to be biopsied a second time showed improvement in epidermal nerve fiber density. Compared to baseline values within groups, and compared with sedentary values across groups, neither aerobic, isokinetic strength, or the combination of aerobic-isokinetic strength exercise intervention altered peak oxygen uptake. Patients that underwent aerobic or the combined aerobic-isokinetic strength exercise intervention, however, demonstrated an increase in treadmill test duration that was sustained over the 12-week post-intervention period. Conclusion: A 12-week course of physical exercise, regardless of type, does not alter sensory or motor nerve electrodiagnostic findings. In a subset of patients, a short-term structured program of aerobic exercise may selectively improve sensory nerve fiber function. Large-scale exercise lifestyle intervention trials are warranted to further evaluate the impact of aerobic exercise on sensory nerve fiber function in diabetic neuropathic patients.

Tendons act as pulleys that provide anchorage of muscle forces for joint motion and stability, as well as for fracture reduction and realignment. Patients that experience complex fractures also have concomitant soft tissue injuries, such as tendon damage or rupture. Tendon injuries that occur at the time of bone fracture have long-term ramifications on musculoskeletal health, yet these injuries are often disregarded in clinical treatment and diagnosis for patients with bone fractures as well as in basic science approaches for understanding bone repair processes. Delayed assessment of soft tissue injuries during evaluation of trauma can lead to chronic pain, dysfunction, and delayed bone healing even following successful fracture repair, highlighting the importance of identifying and treating damaged tendons early. Treatment strategies for bone repair, such as mechanical stabilization and biological therapeutics, can impact tendon healing and function. Because poor tendon healing following complex fracture can significantly impact the function of tendon during bone fracture healing, a need exists to understand the healing process of complex fractures more broadly, beyond the healing of bone. In this review, we explored the mechanical and biological interaction of bone and tendon in the context of complex fracture, as well as the relevance and potential ramifications of tendon damage following bone fracture, which has particular impact on patients that experience complex fractures, such as from combat, automobile accidents, and other trauma.",Use of complementary medicine among patients with allergic rhinitis: an Italian nationwide survey.,https://www.ncbi.nlm.nih.gov/pubmed/30804711,Clinical and molecular allergy : CMA,2019 02 27,"A growing use of complementary alternative medicine (CAM) has been found in Europe as well in Italy for chronic diseases, including the allergic rhinitis.

Prenatal HIV counseling and testing, the availability of diverse antiretroviral therapies, elective cesarean section, and the use of formula milk have significantly reduced the mother-to-infant transmission in the USA and Europe. We are presenting two cases of seroconversion during pregnancy, identified during labor and delivery, of women who received risk reduction counseling and serial HIV testing during pregnancy. Because there are no guidelines for (or easy access to) the use of pre-exposure prophylaxis (PrEP) in pregnancy, they were offered other strategies for prevention including risk reduction counseling, condoms, and serial HIV testing. These cases support the use of PrEP during pregnancy. Both infants were negative and the women are currently receiving long-term highly active antiretroviral therapy. One of them recently delivered another infant. After these two women seroconverted, we decided to offer PrEP to all pregnant women presenting for care who report having an HIV positive partner. During the period 2012-2014, we treated ten HIV negative pregnant women who were partners of HIV positive men. Since 2015, we have seen 20 pregnant women in HIV discordant relationships. Of those, seven received PrEP. No seroconversions have been observed among the pregnant women on PrEP. Although small numbers, seroconversion during pregnancy was observed in two of 13 (15%) of the pregnant women in HIV-discordant relationships seen in our clinic, excluding those treated with PrEP. Given the safety data and experience with tenofovir and emtricitabine among pregnant women living with HIV, we believe PrEP should be offered in pregnancy and that guidelines should reflect this option as an additional strategy to reduce risks during pregnancy and to further reduce infant HIV transmission risk."

Sucrose in stalk (sink) acts as signal, and sends feedback to restrain further synthesis of sucrose by regulating photosynthetic efficiency of leaves (source). Hence sucrose synthesis/accumulation is controlled by many genes and regulatory sequences including 3 invertases (SAI, CWI, NI), sucrose synthase (SuSy) and sucrose phosphate synthase (SPS). SPS and invertase play key role in enhancing sink strength which ultimately promotes greater sucrose accumulation in the sink tissues. In present study, a significant positive correlation was found between sucrose% of source and sink tissues which was greater in the top (R
2
 = 0.679) than middle (R
2
 = 0.580) and bottom (R
2
 = 0.518) internodes, depicting that sucrose accumulation in the stalk bears a direct relation with sucrose translocation efficiency from source. Results indicated an increased sucrose% with maturity, while reducing sugar content decreased with crop growth. qRT-PCR results exhibited an elevated expression of invertase in immature sink tissues depicting increased sink requirement, which declined with maturity. Similarly, increased PEP carboxylase gene expression as observed supported the fact that higher sink demand results in enhanced photosynthetic rate and thus influences the source activity. SPS was found active at initial stage of cane development indicating its role in sucrose synthesis. Thus by studying expression patterns of the different genes both, in source and sink tissues, a better understanding of the sucrose accumulation pathway in sugarcane is possible, which in turn can help in elucidating ways to enhance sucrose concentration in sink.","Studies on root anatomy, morphology and physiology of rice grown under aerobic and anaerobic conditions.",https://www.ncbi.nlm.nih.gov/pubmed/30804642,Physiology and molecular biology of plants : an international journal of functional plant biology,2019 02 27,"With the changing climate and rainfall abrasions, there is a gradual shift in the system of rice cultivation from traditional transplanted anaerobic to aerobic system. Studies on the root anatomical and morpho-physiological traits provide insights about the adaptation under aerobic conditions. We investigated the root anatomical and morpho-physiological traits in anaerobic (BPT 5204) and aerobic (CR Dhan 202) adapted rice genotypes grown under anaerobic and aerobic conditions. It was observed that the formation of fewer aerenchyma, thickened root and larger xylem area were critical anatomical traits associated with aerobic adaptation as compared to anaerobic conditions. The root length of CR Dhan 202 significantly increased under aerobic condition which may be attributed to its aerobic adaptation in terms of water acquisition. The photosynthetic rate was significantly higher in CR Dhan 202 as compared to that of BPT 5204 under the aerobic condition. The morpho-physiological results showed that the root length, total dry weight and photosynthetic rate are the key parameters for imparting aerobic adaptation. These root anatomical and morpho-physiological traits associated with the adaptation can be used as screening criteria for phenotyping and selection of genotypes suitable for aerobic system of cultivation. Such study is expected to expedite the development of rice aerobic varieties in aerobic breeding programmes.","Effects of nitrogen fertilization rate on tocopherols, tocotrienols and γ-oryzanol contents and enzymatic antioxidant activities in rice grains.",https://www.ncbi.nlm.nih.gov/pubmed/30804641,Physiology and molecular biology of plants : an international journal of functional plant biology,2019 02 27,"Tocopherols (Toc), tocotrienols (T3) and γ-oryzanol (GO), major bioactive compounds of rice, are known to possess potent antioxidant activity. In this study, the objective was to determine the effects of nitrogen fertilization rate on contents of Toc, T3 and GO, and activities of enzymatic antioxidants in rice grains. Experiments were conducted on five different levels of nitrogen fertilization. Among the different treatments, grains of 2 N (two-fold of the recommended amount of nitrogen fertilizer) treatment showed the highest total Toc, total T3, α-T3, β-Toc, γ-Toc and γ-T3 levels, whereas 0 N (no treatment) group had the highest GO content. Increasing nitrogen fertilization significantly reduced the rice grain catalase and ascorbate peroxidase, but not the superoxide dismutase activities. Under 0 N and 0.5 N (low N fertilization) treatments, malondialdehyde and H2O2 contents in rice grains were significantly higher than that of other treatments. These results suggest that a two-fold increase in nitrogen fertilization favor the accumulation of Toc and T3 but not GO in rice grains.",Physiological and yield responses of purple coneflower (Echinacea purpurea (L.)

The purpose of this study was to determine the effect of nitrogen on soluble protein, enzyme activities, carotenoids metabolism, greenness and biological yield of the Echinacea purpurea under different levels of irrigation. The experiment was conducted in a research field in Iran during 2013-2015. Irrigation treatments included irrigation after 25, 50 and 75% soil water depletion, and nitrogen sources were no nitrogen (N), nitroxin, 40 kg N ha-1, 40 kg N ha-1 + nitroxin and 80 kg N ha-1. Nitroxin is a biofertilizer including Azotobacter and Azospirillum. The activity of catalase (11.9-21.3 mmol g-1fw min-1), peroxidase (40.1-48.9 µmol g-1fw min-1), polyphenoloxidase (0.79-3.63 mmol g-1fw min-1) increased in both years under drought stress conditions. The lowest greenness (50.1-45.9) was achieved from no-application of nitrogen in the irrigation treatment after 75% water depletion. The results demonstrated the beneficial effects of nitrogen sources on physiological reactions, especially peroxidase, polyphenol oxidase and carotenoids metabolism. It is concluded that irrigation of E. purpurea based on 50% water depletion and 80 kg nitrogen as well as the combination of nitroxin and 40 kg nitrogen treatments should be an appropriate choice for 2 years.",Herbaspirillum seropedicae promotes maize growth but fails to control the maize leaf anthracnose.,https://www.ncbi.nlm.nih.gov/pubmed/30804639,Physiology and molecular biology of plants : an international journal of functional plant biology,2019 02 27,"Herbaspirillum seropedicae is an endophytic diazotrophic bacterium and a plant growth promoting bacteria.

Activity of four antioxidant enzymes i.e. superoxide dismutase, ascorbate peroxidase, catalase and glutathione reductase increased significantly as compared to the control and reached to highest level at the most stringent doses of mutagen. Ninety randomly selected irradiated plants (6 months old) and 100 control plants were inoculated with fungal conidial suspension, to screen for tolerance/resistance against powdery mildew. The severity of the disease was recorded on 0-4 scale with '0' indicating highly resistant; '1' indicating resistant; '2' indicating medium resistance; '3' indicating susceptible and '4' indicating highly susceptible. Three plants (3.33%) irradiated with 5 Gy were found to be tolerant to powdery mildew as these plants showed slight and delayed development of fungal colonies on the leaves. The random amplified polymorphic DNA characterization showed that the irradiated plants had DNA patterns that were different from the control and mother plants.",Antioxidant potential of barley genotypes inoculated with five different pathotypes of Puccinia striiformis f. sp. hordei.,https://www.ncbi.nlm.nih.gov/pubmed/30804637,Physiology and molecular biology of plants : an international journal of functional plant biology,2019 02 27,"The stripe rust caused by the fungal pathogen, Puccinia striiformis f. sp. hordei in barley (Hordeum vulgare L.) is a global problem that threatens the production of barley.

Following an acute 24-h exposure, there were no effects of AMISTAR® on photosynthetic pigments at any of the concentrations evaluated. Glutathione-S-transferase activity was significantly elevated at 1 and 10 μg/L AZX. Significant decrease of catalase and guaiacol peroxidase activities in plants exposed to 500 μg/L, and to 100 and 500 μg/L, respectively, and an increase in glycolate oxidase activity at 500 μg/L was observed. DNA damage at 100 and 500 μg/L was observed. These data indicate that although environmentally relevant levels of AMISTAR® did not result cytotoxic, this fungicide was genotoxic, affecting the physiological process of photorespiration and caused oxidative damage at high concentrations. In this sense, it is necessary to explore sub-lethal responses in non-target organisms because some effects could promote further potential long-term biological consequences in a context of repeated pulses of exposure.",Validation of reference genes for qRT-PCR data normalisation in lentil (Lens culinaris) under leaf developmental stages and abiotic stresses.,https://www.ncbi.nlm.nih.gov/pubmed/30804635,Physiology and molecular biology of plants : an international journal of functional plant biology,2019 02 27,"Lentil (Lens culinaris) is one of the most important staple food crops of developing countries.

However, there is a severe scarcity of information regarding stable reference genes in lentil, which is mandatory for qRT-PCR data normalisation. Hence, the present study was under-taken to identify the most stable reference gene(s) in lentil. Expression stability of eight candidate genes viz. ribulose 1,5-bisphosphate carboxylase large subunit (Rbcl), ribosomal protein L2 (RPL2), 18S rRNA, tubulin (Tub), elongation factor 1α (EF1α), glyceraldehydes-3-phosphate dehydrogenase (GAPDH), heat shock protein (HSP70), and Maturase (mat K) was evaluated in five varieties of lentil at three different stages of leaf development and abiotic stress conditions using qRT-PCR. The results were analysed using four types of statistical software viz., geNorm, BestKeeper, NormFinder and RefFinder; all softwares identified RPL2 as most stable under abiotic stress conditions and developmental stages followed by Tub and Rbcl; while, HSP70 was identified as least stable. Relative expression of the target genes, defensin and PR4, was evaluated under abiotic stress conditions and data normalisation was done using two stable reference genes, RPL2 and Tub, either alone or in combination and with two least stable genes, HSP70 and 18S. The present work provides a list of potential reference genes in lentil, which will help in selection of appropriate reference gene for qRT-PCR data normalization depending upon the experiment.",Analysis of bHLH coding genes of Cicer arietinum during heavy metal stress using biological network.,https://www.ncbi.nlm.nih.gov/pubmed/30804634,Physiology and molecular biology of plants : an international journal of functional plant biology,2019 02 27,bHLH family of transcription factors play important role in regulating many cellular and physiological functions in plants. These proteins are also known to be involved in response to several abiotic stress types. Cicer arietinum is an important source of protein in food across the globe. Considerable differential expression in the bHLH family of proteins during heavy metal exposure in Cicer arietinum was observed by microarray data analysis. The study aimed to construct a Pearson coefficient correlation based network of bHLH coding genes in the plant. Microarray data of Cicer arietinum recorded under cadmium and chromium stress (GSE86807) from GEO at NCBI was used for analysis. The network constructed from expression data set of the 85 bHLH coding genes revealed 10 hub genes that are connected with topological genes. These hub genes are stress responsive genes that may also be regarded as the marker genes for heavy metal response. Our analysis reported a new set of reference genes (hub genes) that have potentially significant role in development of stress tolerant crops.

DCIS can occur in its pure form or in conjunction with invasive disease, in the same lesion, in different foci, or in the contralateral breast. MRI has a high sensitivity for the detection of pure DCIS, being able to identify the non-calcified component, and its accuracy increases with the nuclear grade of the lesion. The most common pattern of presentation is non-nodular enhancement; heterogeneous internal structures; a kinetic curve showing washout or plateau enhancement; segmental distribution; and restricted diffusion. MRI plays an important role in the detection of DCIS, especially in the evaluation of its extent, contributing to more reliable surgical excision and reducing local recurrence.",Percutaneous transhepatic cholangiobiopsy.,https://www.ncbi.nlm.nih.gov/pubmed/30804614,Radiologia brasileira,2019 02 27,"Most tumors of the biliary tract are too small to have specific imaging characteristics or for percutaneous puncture to provide sufficient material for diagnosis.

Splice-disrupting mutations make up the second largest class of known disease-causing mutations. Each individual (singleton) exome harbors over 500 rare variants of unknown significance (VUS) in the splicing region. The existing relevant pathogenicity prediction tools tackle all non-coding variants as one amorphic class and/or are not calibrated for the high sensitivity required for clinical use. Here we calibrate seven such tools and devise a novel tool called Splicing Clinically Applicable Pathogenicity prediction (S-CAP) that is over twice as powerful as all previous tools, removing 41% of patient VUS at 95% sensitivity. We show that S-CAP does this by using its own features and not via meta-prediction over previous tools, and that splicing pathogenicity prediction is distinct from predicting molecular splicing changes. S-CAP is an important step on the path to deriving non-coding causal diagnoses.",Genetic landscape of chronic obstructive pulmonary disease identifies heterogeneous cell-type and phenotype associations.,https://www.ncbi.nlm.nih.gov/pubmed/30804561,Nature genetics,2019 06 13,"Chronic obstructive pulmonary disease (COPD) is the leading cause of respiratory mortality worldwide. Genetic risk loci provide new insights into disease pathogenesis. We performed a genome-wide association study in 35,735 cases and 222,076 controls from the UK Biobank and additional studies from the International COPD Genetics Consortium. We identified 82 loci associated with P < 5 × 10-8; 47 of these were previously described in association with either COPD or population-based measures of lung function. Of the remaining 35 new loci, 13 were associated with lung function in 79,055 individuals from the SpiroMeta consortium. Using gene expression and regulation data, we identified functional enrichment of COPD risk loci in lung tissue, smooth muscle, and several lung cell types. We found 14 COPD loci shared with either asthma or pulmonary fibrosis. COPD genetic risk loci clustered into groups based on associations with quantitative imaging features and comorbidities. Our analyses provide further support for the genetic susceptibility and heterogeneity of COPD.",New genetic signals for lung function highlight pathways and chronic obstructive pulmonary disease associations across multiple ancestries.,https://www.ncbi.nlm.nih.gov/pubmed/30804560,Nature genetics,2019 06 10,"Reduced lung function predicts mortality and is key to the diagnosis of chronic obstructive pulmonary disease (COPD). In a genome-wide association study in 400,102 individuals of European ancestry, we define 279 lung function signals, 139 of which are new. In combination, these variants strongly predict COPD in independent populations. Furthermore, the combined effect of these variants showed generalizability across smokers and never smokers, and across ancestral groups. We highlight biological pathways, known and potential drug targets for COPD and, in phenome-wide association studies, autoimmune-related and other pleiotropic effects of lung function-associated variants. This new genetic evidence has potential to improve future preventive and therapeutic strategies for COPD.",Genome-wide stability of the DNA replication program in single mammalian cells.,https://www.ncbi.nlm.nih.gov/pubmed/30804559,Nature genetics,2019 05 18,"Here, we report a single-cell DNA replication sequencing method, scRepli-seq, a genome-wide methodology that measures copy number differences between replicated and unreplicated DNA. Using scRepli-seq, we demonstrate that replication-domain organization is conserved among individual mouse embryonic stem cells (mESCs). Differentiated mESCs exhibited distinct profiles, which were also conserved among cells. Haplotype-resolved scRepli-seq revealed similar replication profiles of homologous autosomes, while the inactive X chromosome was clearly replicated later than its active counterpart. However, a small degree of cell-to-cell replication-timing heterogeneity was present, which was smallest at the beginning and the end of S phase. In addition, developmentally regulated domains were found to deviate from others and showed a higher degree of heterogeneity, thus suggesting a link to developmental plasticity. Moreover, allelic expression imbalance was found to strongly associate with replication-timing asynchrony. Our results form a foundation for single-cell-level understanding of DNA replication regulation and provide insights into three-dimensional genome organization.",Identification of common genetic risk variants for autism spectrum disorder.,https://www.ncbi.nlm.nih.gov/pubmed/30804558,Nature genetics,2019 06 10,"Autism spectrum disorder (ASD) is a highly heritable and heterogeneous group of neurodevelopmental phenotypes diagnosed in more than 1% of children. Common genetic variants contribute substantially to ASD susceptibility, but to date no individual variants have been robustly associated with ASD. With a marked sample-size increase from a unique Danish population resource, we report a genome-wide association meta-analysis of 18,381 individuals with ASD and 27,969 controls that identified five genome-wide-significant loci. Leveraging GWAS results from three phenotypes with significantly overlapping genetic architectures (schizophrenia, major depression, and educational attainment), we identified seven additional loci shared with other traits at equally strict significance levels. Dissecting the polygenic architecture, we found both quantitative and qualitative polygenic heterogeneity across ASD subtypes. These results highlight biological insights, particularly relating to neuronal function and corticogenesis, and establish that GWAS performed at scale will be much more productive in the near term in ASD.",Origin and evolution of the octoploid strawberry genome.,https://www.ncbi.nlm.nih.gov/pubmed/30804557,Nature genetics,2019 05 18,"Cultivated strawberry emerged from the hybridization of two wild octoploid species, both descendants from the merger of four diploid progenitor species into a single nucleus more than 1 million years ago. Here we report a near-complete chromosome-scale assembly for cultivated octoploid strawberry (Fragaria × ananassa) and uncovered the origin and evolutionary processes that shaped this complex allopolyploid. We identified the extant relatives of each diploid progenitor species and provide support for the North American origin of octoploid strawberry. We examined the dynamics among the four subgenomes in octoploid strawberry and uncovered the presence of a single dominant subgenome with significantly greater gene content, gene expression abundance, and biased exchanges between homoeologous chromosomes, as compared with the other subgenomes. Pathway analysis showed that certain metabolomic and disease-resistance traits are largely controlled by the dominant subgenome. These findings and the reference genome should serve as a powerful platform for future evolutionary studies and enable molecular breeding in strawberry.",Listeria hijacks host mitophagy through a novel mitophagy receptor to evade killing.,https://www.ncbi.nlm.nih.gov/pubmed/30804553,Nature immunology,2019 04 19,"Cells use mitophagy to remove damaged or unwanted mitochondria to maintain homeostasis. Here we report that the intracellular bacterial pathogen Listeria monocytogenes exploits host mitophagy to evade killing. We found that L. monocytogenes induced mitophagy in macrophages through the virulence factor listeriolysin O (LLO). We discovered that NLRX1, the only Nod-like receptor (NLR) family member with a mitochondrial targeting sequence, contains an LC3-interacting region (LIR) and directly associated with LC3 through the LIR. NLRX1 and its LIR motif were essential for L. monocytogenes-induced mitophagy. NLRX1 deficiency and use of a mitophagy inhibitor both increased mitochondrial production of reactive oxygen species and thereby suppressed the survival of L. monocytogenes. Mechanistically, L. monocytogenes and LLO induced oligomerization of NLRX1 to promote binding of its LIR motif to LC3 for induction of mitophagy. Our study identifies NLRX1 as a novel mitophagy receptor and discovers a previously unappreciated strategy used by pathogens to hijack a host cell homeostasis system for their survival.",One-step generation of modular CAR-T cells with AAV-Cpf1.,https://www.ncbi.nlm.nih.gov/pubmed/30804551,Nature methods,2019 05 22,"Immune-cell engineering opens new capabilities for fundamental immunology research and immunotherapy. We developed a system for efficient generation of chimeric antigen receptor (CAR)-engineered T cells (CAR-T cells) with considerably enhanced features by streamlined genome engineering. By leveraging trans-activating CRISPR (clustered regularly interspaced short palindromic repeats) RNA (tracrRNA)-independent CRISPR-Cpf1 systems with adeno-associated virus (AAV), we were able to build a stable CAR-T cell with homology-directed-repair knock-in and immune-checkpoint knockout (KIKO CAR-T cell) at high efficiency in one step. The modularity of the AAV-Cpf1 KIKO system enables flexible and highly efficient generation of double knock-in of two different CARs in the same T cell. Compared with Cas9-based methods, the AAV-Cpf1 system generates double-knock-in CAR-T cells more efficiently. CD22-specific AAV-Cpf1 KIKO CAR-T cells have potency comparable to that of Cas9 CAR-T cells in cytokine production and cancer cell killing, while expressing lower levels of exhaustion markers.

Recent efforts have identified hundreds of new RBPs that lack known RNA-binding domains, thus underscoring the complexity and diversity of RNA-protein complexes. Recent progress has expanded the number of methods for studying RNA-protein interactions in two general categories: approaches that characterize proteins bound to an RNA of interest (RNA-centric), and those that examine RNAs bound to a protein of interest (protein-centric). Each method has unique strengths and limitations, which makes it important to select optimal approaches for the biological question being addressed. Here we review methods for the study of RNA-protein interactions, with a focus on their suitability for specific applications."

Recent developments have focused on electrochemical and optical biosensors, together with advances in the noninvasive monitoring of biomarkers including metabolites, bacteria and hormones. A combination of multiplexed biosensing, microfluidic sampling and transport systems have been integrated, miniaturized and combined with flexible materials for improved wearability and ease of operation. Although wearable biosensors hold promise, a better understanding of the correlations between analyte concentrations in the blood and noninvasive biofluids is needed to improve reliability. An expanded set of on-body bioaffinity assays and more sensing strategies are needed to make more biomarkers accessible to monitoring. Large-cohort validation studies of wearable biosensor performance will be needed to underpin clinical acceptance. Accurate and reliable real-time sensing of physiological information using wearable biosensor technologies would have a broad impact on our daily lives.",NFIA is a gliogenic switch enabling rapid derivation of functional human astrocytes from pluripotent stem cells.,https://www.ncbi.nlm.nih.gov/pubmed/30804533,Nature biotechnology,2019 06 13,"The mechanistic basis of gliogenesis, which occurs late in human development, is poorly understood. Here we identify nuclear factor IA (NFIA) as a molecular switch inducing human glial competency. Transient expression of NFIA is sufficient to trigger glial competency of human pluripotent stem cell-derived neural stem cells within 5 days and to convert these cells into astrocytes in the presence of glial-promoting factors, as compared to 3-6 months using current protocols. NFIA-induced astrocytes promote synaptogenesis, exhibit neuroprotective properties, display calcium transients in response to appropriate stimuli and engraft in the adult mouse brain. Differentiation involves rapid but reversible chromatin remodeling, glial fibrillary acidic protein (GFAP) promoter demethylation and a striking lengthening of the G1 cell cycle phase. Genetic or pharmacological manipulation of G1 length partially mimics NFIA function. We used the approach to generate astrocytes with region-specific or reactive features. Our study defines key mechanisms of the gliogenic switch and enables the rapid production of human astrocytes for disease modeling and regenerative medicine.",Bidirectional modulation of HIF-2 activity through chemical ligands.,https://www.ncbi.nlm.nih.gov/pubmed/30804532,Nature chemical biology,2019 05 15,"Hypoxia-inducible factor-2 (HIF-2) is a heterodimeric transcription factor formed through dimerization between an oxygen-sensitive HIF-2α subunit and its obligate partner subunit ARNT. Enhanced HIF-2 activity drives some cancers, whereas reduced activity causes anemia in chronic kidney disease. Therefore, modulation of HIF-2 activity via direct-binding ligands could provide many new therapeutic benefits. Here, we explored HIF-2α chemical ligands using combined crystallographic, biophysical, and cell-based functional studies. We found chemically unrelated antagonists to employ the same mechanism of action. Their binding displaced residue M252 from inside the HIF-2α PAS-B pocket toward the ARNT subunit to weaken heterodimerization. We also identified first-in-class HIF-2α agonists and found that they significantly displaced pocket residue Y281. Its dramatic side chain movement increases heterodimerization stability and transcriptional activity. Our findings show that despite binding to the same HIF-2α PAS-B pocket, ligands can manifest as inhibitors versus activators by mobilizing different pocket residues to allosterically alter HIF-2α-ARNT heterodimerization.",Optimality and heuristics in perceptual neuroscience.,https://www.ncbi.nlm.nih.gov/pubmed/30804531,Nature neuroscience,2019 05 21,"The foundation for modern understanding of how we make perceptual decisions about what we see or where to look comes from considering the optimal way to perform these behaviors. While statistical computation is useful for deriving the optimal solution to a perceptual problem, optimality requires perfect knowledge of priors and often complex computation. Accumulating evidence, however, suggests that optimal perceptual goals can be achieved or approximated more simply by human observers using heuristic approaches. Perceptual neuroscientists captivated by optimal explanations of sensory behaviors will fail in their search for the neural circuits and cortical processes that implement an optimal computation whenever that behavior is actually achieved through heuristics. This article provides a cross-disciplinary review of decision-making with the aim of building perceptual theory that uses optimality to set the computational goals for perceptual behavior but, through consideration of ecological, computational, and energetic constraints, incorporates how these optimal goals can be achieved through heuristic approximation.",Unique contributions of parvalbumin and cholinergic interneurons in organizing striatal networks during movement.,https://www.ncbi.nlm.nih.gov/pubmed/30804530,Nature neuroscience,2019 05 21,"Striatal parvalbumin (PV) and cholinergic interneurons (CHIs) are poised to play major roles in behavior by coordinating the networks of medium spiny cells that relay motor output. However, the small numbers and scattered distribution of these cells have hindered direct assessment of their contribution to activity in networks of medium spiny neurons (MSNs) during behavior. Here, we build on recent improvements in single-cell calcium imaging combined with optogenetics to test the capacity of PVs and CHIs to affect MSN activity and behavior in mice engaged in voluntary locomotion. We find that PVs and CHIs have unique effects on MSN activity and dissociable roles in supporting movement. PV cells facilitate movement by refining the activation of MSN networks responsible for movement execution. CHIs, in contrast, synchronize activity within MSN networks to signal the end of a movement bout. These results provide new insights into the striatal network activity that supports movement.",Divergent medial amygdala projections regulate approach-avoidance conflict behavior.,https://www.ncbi.nlm.nih.gov/pubmed/30804529,Nature neuroscience,2019 05 21,"Avoidance of innate threats is often in conflict with motivations to engage in exploratory approach behavior. The neural pathways that mediate this approach-avoidance conflict are not well resolved. Here we isolated a population of dopamine D1 receptor (D1R)-expressing neurons within the posteroventral region of the medial amygdala (MeApv) in mice that are activated either during approach or during avoidance of an innate threat stimulus. Distinct subpopulations of MeApv-D1R neurons differentially innervate the ventromedial hypothalamus and bed nucleus of the stria terminalis, and these projections have opposing effects on investigation or avoidance of threatening stimuli. These projections are potently modulated through opposite actions of D1R signaling that bias approach behavior. These data demonstrate divergent pathways in the MeApv that can be differentially weighted toward exploration or evasion of threats.",Structure of amyloid β25-35 in lipid environment and cholesterol-dependent membrane pore formation.,https://www.ncbi.nlm.nih.gov/pubmed/30804528,Scientific reports,2019 03 01,"The amyloid β (Aβ) peptide and its shorter variants, including a highly cytotoxic Aβ25-35 peptide, exert their neurotoxic effect during Alzheimer's disease by various mechanisms, including cellular membrane permeabilization. The intrinsic polymorphism of Aβ has prevented the identification of the molecular basis of Aβ pore formation by direct structural methods, and computational studies have led to highly divergent pore models. Here, we have employed a set of biophysical techniques to directly monitor Ca2+-transporting Aβ25-35 pores in lipid membranes, to quantitatively characterize pore formation, and to identify the key structural features of the pore. Moreover, the effect of membrane cholesterol on pore formation and the structure of Aβ25-35 has been elucidated. The data suggest that the membrane-embedded peptide forms 6- or 8-stranded β-barrel like structures. The 8-stranded barrels may conduct Ca2+ ions through an inner cavity, whereas the tightly packed 6-stranded barrels need to assemble into supramolecular structures to form a central pore. Cholesterol affects Aβ25-35 pore formation by a dual mechanism, i.e., by direct interaction with the peptide and by affecting membrane structure. Collectively, our data illuminate the molecular basis of Aβ membrane pore formation, which should advance both basic and clinical research on Alzheimer's disease and membrane-associated pathologies in general.",Evidence for moiré excitons in van der Waals heterostructures.,https://www.ncbi.nlm.nih.gov/pubmed/30804527,Nature,2019 04 15,"Recent advances in the isolation and stacking of monolayers of van der Waals materials have provided approaches for the preparation of quantum materials in the ultimate two-dimensional limit1,2. In van der Waals heterostructures formed by stacking two monolayer semiconductors, lattice mismatch or rotational misalignment introduces an in-plane moiré superlattice3. It is widely recognized that the moiré superlattice can modulate the electronic band structure of the material and lead to transport properties such as unconventional superconductivity4 and insulating behaviour driven by correlations5-7; however, the influence of the moiré superlattice on optical properties has not been investigated experimentally. Here we report the observation of multiple interlayer exciton resonances with either positive or negative circularly polarized emission in a molybdenum diselenide/tungsten diselenide (MoSe2/WSe2) heterobilayer with a small twist angle. We attribute these resonances to excitonic ground and excited states confined within the moiré potential. This interpretation is supported by recombination dynamics and by the dependence of these interlayer exciton resonances on twist angle and temperature. These results suggest the feasibility of engineering artificial excitonic crystals using van der Waals heterostructures for nanophotonics and quantum information applications.",Signatures of moiré-trapped valley excitons in MoSe2/WSe2 heterobilayers.,https://www.ncbi.nlm.nih.gov/pubmed/30804526,Nature,2019 04 15,"The formation of moiré patterns in crystalline solids can be used to manipulate their electronic properties, which are fundamentally influenced by periodic potential landscapes. In two-dimensional materials, a moiré pattern with a superlattice potential can be formed by vertically stacking two layered materials with a twist and/or a difference in lattice constant. This approach has led to electronic phenomena including the fractal quantum Hall effect1-3, tunable Mott insulators4,5 and unconventional superconductivity6. In addition, theory predicts that notable effects on optical excitations could result from a moiré potential in two-dimensional valley semiconductors7-9, but these signatures have not been detected experimentally. Here we report experimental evidence of interlayer valley excitons trapped in a moiré potential in molybdenum diselenide (MoSe2)/tungsten diselenide (WSe2) heterobilayers. At low temperatures, we observe photoluminescence close to the free interlayer exciton energy but with linewidths over one hundred times narrower (around 100 microelectronvolts). The emitter g-factors are homogeneous across the same sample and take only two values, -15.9 and 6.7, in samples with approximate twist angles of 60 degrees and 0 degrees, respectively. The g-factors match those of the free interlayer exciton, which is determined by one of two possible valley-pairing configurations. At twist angles of approximately 20 degrees the emitters become two orders of magnitude dimmer; however, they possess the same g-factor as the heterobilayer at a twist angle of approximately 60 degrees. This is consistent with the umklapp recombination of interlayer excitons near the commensurate 21.8-degree twist angle7. The emitters exhibit strong circular polarization of the same helicity for a given twist angle, which suggests that the trapping potential retains three-fold rotational symmetry. Together with a characteristic dependence on power and excitation energy, these results suggest that the origin of the observed effects is interlayer excitons trapped in a smooth moiré potential with inherited valley-contrasting physics. This work presents opportunities to control two-dimensional moiré optics through variation of the twist angle.",Observation of moiré excitons in WSe2/WS2 heterostructure superlattices.,https://www.ncbi.nlm.nih.gov/pubmed/30804525,Nature,2019 03 25,"Moiré superlattices enable the generation of new quantum phenomena in two-dimensional heterostructures, in which the interactions between the atomically thin layers qualitatively change the electronic band structure of the superlattice. For example, mini-Dirac points, tunable Mott insulator states and the Hofstadter butterfly pattern can emerge in different types of graphene/boron nitride moiré superlattices, whereas correlated insulating states and superconductivity have been reported in twisted bilayer graphene moiré superlattices1-12. In addition to their pronounced effects on single-particle states, moiré superlattices have recently been predicted to host excited states such as moiré exciton bands13-15. Here we report the observation of moiré superlattice exciton states in tungsten diselenide/tungsten disulfide (WSe2/WS2) heterostructures in which the layers are closely aligned. These moiré exciton states manifest as multiple emergent peaks around the original WSe2 A exciton resonance in the absorption spectra, and they exhibit gate dependences that are distinct from that of the A exciton in WSe2 monolayers and in WSe2/WS2 heterostructures with large twist angles. These phenomena can be described by a theoretical model in which the periodic moiré potential is much stronger than the exciton kinetic energy and generates multiple flat exciton minibands. The moiré exciton bands provide an attractive platform from which to explore and control excited states of matter, such as topological excitons and a correlated exciton Hubbard model, in transition-metal dichalcogenides."

However, it is susceptible to aqueous corrosion, recognizable by the formation of surface alteration layers (SALs). Here, we report in situ fluid-cell Raman spectroscopic experiments providing real-time insights into reaction and transport processes during the aqueous corrosion of a borosilicate glass. The formation of a several-micrometre-thick water-rich zone between the SAL and the glass, interpreted as an interface solution, is detected, as well as pH gradients at the glass surface and within the SAL. By replacing the solution with a deuterated solution, it is observed that water transport through the SAL is not rate-limiting. The data support an interface-coupled dissolution-reprecipitation process for SAL formation. Fluid-cell Raman spectroscopic experiments open up new avenues for studying solid-water reactions, with the ability to in situ trace specific sub-processes in real time by using stable isotopes.",53BP1 nuclear bodies enforce replication timing at under-replicated DNA to limit heritable DNA damage.,https://www.ncbi.nlm.nih.gov/pubmed/30804506,Nature cell biology,2019 05 01,"Failure to complete DNA replication is a stochastic by-product of genome doubling in almost every cell cycle. During mitosis, under-replicated DNA (UR-DNA) is converted into DNA lesions, which are inherited by daughter cells and sequestered in 53BP1 nuclear bodies (53BP1-NBs). The fate of such cells remains unknown. Here, we show that the formation of 53BP1-NBs interrupts the chain of iterative damage intrinsically embedded in UR-DNA. Unlike clastogen-induced 53BP1 foci that are repaired throughout interphase, 53BP1-NBs restrain replication of the embedded genomic loci until late S phase, thus enabling the dedicated RAD52-mediated repair of UR-DNA lesions. The absence or malfunction of 53BP1-NBs causes premature replication of the affected loci, accompanied by genotoxic RAD51-mediated recombination. Thus, through adjusting replication timing and repair pathway choice at under-replicated loci, 53BP1-NBs enable the completion of genome duplication of inherited UR-DNA and prevent the conversion of stochastic under-replications into genome instability.",Apical-basal polarity inhibits epithelial-mesenchymal transition and tumour metastasis by PAR-complex-mediated SNAI1 degradation.,https://www.ncbi.nlm.nih.gov/pubmed/30804505,Nature cell biology,2019 06 10,"Loss of apical-basal polarity and activation of epithelial-mesenchymal transition (EMT) both contribute to carcinoma progression and metastasis. Here, we report that apical-basal polarity inhibits EMT to suppress metastatic dissemination. Using mouse and human epithelial three-dimensional organoid cultures, we show that the PAR-atypical protein kinase C (aPKC) polarity complex inhibits EMT and invasion by promoting degradation of the SNAIL family protein SNAI1. Under intact apical-basal polarity, aPKC kinases phosphorylate S249 of SNAI1, which leads to protein degradation. Loss of apical-basal polarity prevents aPKC-mediated SNAI1 phosphorylation and stabilizes the SNAI1 protein to promote EMT and invasion. In human breast tumour xenografts, inhibition of the PAR-complex-mediated SNAI1 degradation mechanism promotes tumour invasion and metastasis. Analyses of human breast tissue samples reveal negative correlations between PAR3 and SNAI1 protein levels. Our results demonstrate that apical-basal polarity functions as a critical checkpoint of EMT to precisely control epithelial-mesenchymal plasticity during tumour metastasis.",Ubiquilins regulate autophagic flux through mTOR signalling and lysosomal acidification.,https://www.ncbi.nlm.nih.gov/pubmed/30804504,Nature cell biology,2019 06 14,"Although the aetiology of amyotrophic lateral sclerosis (ALS) remains poorly understood, impaired proteostasis is a common feature of different forms of ALS. Mutations in genes encoding ubiquilins, UBQLN2 and UBQLN4, cause familial ALS. The role of ubiquilins in proteasomal degradation is well established, but their role in autophagy-lysosomal clearance is poorly defined. Here, we describe a crosstalk between endoplasmic reticulum stress, mTOR signalling and autophagic flux in Drosophila and mammalian cells lacking ubiquilins. We found that loss of ubiquilins leads to endoplasmic reticulum stress, impairs mTORC1 activity, promotes autophagy and causes the demise of neurons. We show that ubiquilin mutants display defective autophagic flux due to reduced lysosome acidification. Ubiquilins are required to maintain proper levels of the V0a/V100 subunit of the vacuolar H+-ATPase and lysosomal pH. Feeding flies acidic nanoparticles alleviates defective autophagic flux in ubiquilin mutants. Hence, our studies reveal a conserved role for ubiquilins as regulators of autophagy by controlling vacuolar H+-ATPase activity and mTOR signalling.",A microRNA-inducible CRISPR-Cas9 platform serves as a microRNA sensor and cell-type-specific genome regulation tool.,https://www.ncbi.nlm.nih.gov/pubmed/30804503,Nature cell biology,2019 05 01,"microRNAs (miRNAs) are small noncoding RNAs that play important regulatory roles in plants, animals and viruses. Measuring miRNA activity in vivo remains a big challenge. Here, using an miRNA-mediated single guide RNA (sgRNA)-releasing strategy and dCas9-VPR to drive a transgene red fluorescent protein, we create an miRNA sensor that can faithfully measure miRNA activity at cellular levels and use it to monitor differentiation status of stem cells. Furthermore, by designing sgRNAs to target endogenous loci, we adapted this system to control the expression of endogenous genes or mutate specific DNA bases upon induction by cell-type-specific miRNAs. Finally, by miRNA sensor library screening, we discover a previously undefined layer of heterogeneity associated with miR-21a activity in mouse embryonic stem cells.

HR supresses tumorigenesis1, but is restricted to the S and G2 phases of the cell cycle when a sister chromatid is present2. Breast cancer type 1 susceptibility protein (BRCA1) promotes HR by antagonizing the anti-resection factor TP53-binding protein 1(53BP1) (refs. 2-5), but it remains unknown how BRCA1 function is limited to the S and G2 phases. We show that BRCA1 recruitment requires recognition of histone H4 unmethylated at lysine 20 (H4K20me0), linking DSB repair pathway choice directly to sister chromatid availability. We identify the ankyrin repeat domain of BRCA1-associated RING domain protein 1 (BARD1)-the obligate BRCA1 binding partner3-as a reader of H4K20me0 present on new histones in post-replicative chromatin6. BARD1 ankyrin repeat domain mutations disabling H4K20me0 recognition abrogate accumulation of BRCA1 at DSBs, causing aberrant build-up of 53BP1, and allowing anti-resection activity to prevail in S and G2. Consequently, BARD1 recognition of H4K20me0 is required for HR and resistance to poly (ADP-ribose) polymerase inhibitors. Collectively, this reveals that BRCA1-BARD1 monitors the replicative state of the genome to oppose 53BP1 function, routing only DSBs within sister chromatids to HR.",A linear nonribosomal octapeptide from Fusarium graminearum facilitates cell-to-cell invasion of wheat.,https://www.ncbi.nlm.nih.gov/pubmed/30804501,Nature communications,2019 04 17,"Fusarium graminearum is a destructive wheat pathogen.

Here, we report that deletion of the putative secondary metabolite biosynthesis gene cluster fg3_54 compromises the pathogen's ability to infect wheat through cell-to-cell penetration. Ectopic expression of fgm4, a pathway-specific bANK-like regulatory gene, activates the transcription of the fg3_54 cluster in vitro. We identify a linear, C- terminally reduced and D-amino acid residue-rich octapeptide, fusaoctaxin A, as the product of the two nonribosomal peptide synthetases encoded by fg3_54. Chemically-synthesized fusaoctaxin A restores cell-to-cell invasiveness in fg3_54-deleted F. graminearum, and enables colonization of wheat coleoptiles by two Fusarium strains that lack the fg3_54 homolog and are nonpathogenic to wheat. In conclusion, our results identify fusaoctaxin A as a virulence factor required for cell-to-cell invasion of wheat by F. graminearum.",Fluorogenic D-amino acids enable real-time monitoring of peptidoglycan biosynthesis and high-throughput transpeptidation assays.,https://www.ncbi.nlm.nih.gov/pubmed/30804500,Nature chemistry,2019 04 25,"Peptidoglycan is an essential cell wall component that maintains the morphology and viability of nearly all bacteria. Its biosynthesis requires periplasmic transpeptidation reactions, which construct peptide crosslinkages between polysaccharide chains to endow mechanical strength. However, tracking the transpeptidation reaction in vivo and in vitro is challenging, mainly due to the lack of efficient, biocompatible probes. Here, we report the design, synthesis and application of rotor-fluorogenic D-amino acids (RfDAAs), enabling real-time, continuous tracking of transpeptidation reactions. These probes allow peptidoglycan biosynthesis to be monitored in real time by visualizing transpeptidase reactions in live cells, as well as real-time activity assays of D,D- and L,D-transpeptidases and sortases in vitro. The unique ability of RfDAAs to become fluorescent when incorporated into peptidoglycan provides a powerful new tool to study peptidoglycan biosynthesis with high temporal resolution and prospectively enable high-throughput screening for inhibitors of peptidoglycan biosynthesis.","Associations of maternal, perinatal and postnatal factors with the eruption timing of the first primary tooth.",https://www.ncbi.nlm.nih.gov/pubmed/30804498,Scientific reports,2019 03 01,"We recruited 1296 mothers in their first trimester from the Affiliated Obstetrics and Gynecology Hospital of Nanjing Medical University between May 2014 and September 2015 to investigate the associations of maternal, perinatal and postnatal factors with the eruption timing of the first primary tooth (ETFPT) in a Chinese population. We collected maternal demographic information and clinical data during the perinatal and postnatal period, and oral examinations of the infants were performed by a doctor at 6, 9 and 12 months of age. Multiple regression analysis was used to identify significant explanatory variables for ETFPT. The mean age at eruption of the first primary tooth for all the infants was 6.82 ± 1.90 months. After adjustment for confounders, higher maternal childbearing age (β = 0.57; 95%CI = 0.13-1.02), female sex (β = 0.26; 95%CI = 0.07-0.52), and low birth weight (β = 0.98; 95%CI = 0.20-1.76) were significantly associated with delayed eruption of the first primary tooth, while macrosomia (β = -0.79; 95%CI = -1.30--0.28) was significantly associated with earlier eruption of the first primary tooth. Maternal childbearing age, infant sex and infant birth weight were significant determinants of ETFPT.",Elevation shapes the reassembly of Anthropocene lizard communities.,https://www.ncbi.nlm.nih.gov/pubmed/30804497,Nature ecology & evolution,2019 06 13,"Human impacts, especially land-use change, are precipitating biodiversity loss. Yet anthropogenic drivers are layered atop natural biogeographic gradients. We ask whether the effects of anthropogenic habitat conversion depend on climatic context. We studied the structure of Anolis lizard communities in intact and human-modified habitats across natural climate gradients in the northern Dominican Republic. Using community-wide mark-resight methods to control for detection bias, we show that the effects of habitat conversion reverse with elevation (and thus macroclimate temperature). Deforestation reduces abundance and biomass in lowland communities but has no such effect at high elevations. In contrast, forest loss results in no compositional change in the lowlands, but complete community turnover between habitats in the highlands. These contrasting community-level patterns emerge from consistent responses of individual species based on their thermal niches. Community reorganization in the highlands stems from thermal niche tracking and habitat switching by abundant lowland species. We find no support for the hypothesis that climate generalists outperform specialists to succeed in anthropogenic habitats. Instead, warm-climate specialists dominate anthropogenic habitats, even in cool macroclimates. Human impacts interact with pre-existing environmental gradients to reorganize biodiversity. Leveraging a biogeographic perspective will provide insight into the future communities of life on Earth."

Magnetic domain walls show considerable potential as magnonic waveguides for on-chip control of the spatial extent and propagation of spin waves. However, low-loss guidance of spin waves with nanoscale wavelengths and around angled tracks remains to be shown. Here, we demonstrate spin wave control using natural anisotropic features of magnetic order in an interlayer exchange-coupled ferromagnetic bilayer. We employ scanning transmission X-ray microscopy to image the generation of spin waves and their propagation across distances exceeding multiples of the wavelength. Spin waves propagate in extended planar geometries as well as along straight or curved one-dimensional domain walls. We observe wavelengths between 1 μm and 150 nm, with excitation frequencies ranging from 250 MHz to 3 GHz. Our results show routes towards the practical implementation of magnonic waveguides in the form of domain walls in future spin wave logic and computational circuits.",HtrA4 may play a major role in inhibiting endothelial repair in pregnancy complication preeclampsia.,https://www.ncbi.nlm.nih.gov/pubmed/30804477,Scientific reports,2019 03 01,"Preeclampsia (PE) is a life-threatening complication of human pregnancy with no effective treatment other than premature delivery. It is hallmarked by systemic endothelial injury/dysfunction which is believed to be caused by abnormal levels/types of placenta-derived factors that are circulating in the maternal blood. Emerging evidence suggests that endothelial repair is also dysregulated in PE, as circulating endothelial progenitor cells (EPCs) critical for endothelial regeneration are reduced in number and functionality. However, the underlying mechanisms are poorly understood. HtrA4 is a placenta-specific protease that is secreted into the circulation and significantly elevated in early-onset PE. Here we investigated the impact of HtrA4 on endothelial proliferation and repair. We demonstrated that high levels of HtrA4 halted endothelial cell proliferation and significantly down-regulated a number of genes that are critical for cell cycle progression, including CDKN3, BIRC5, CDK1 and MKI67. Furthermore, HtrA4 significantly inhibited the proliferation of primary EPCs isolated from term human umbilical cord blood and impeded their differentiation into mature endothelial cells. Our data thus suggests that elevated levels of HtrA4 in the early-onset PE circulation may impair endothelial cell repair, not only by halting endothelial cell proliferation, but also by inhibiting the proliferation and differentiation of circulating EPCs.",The innate immune response to allotransplants: mechanisms and therapeutic potentials.,https://www.ncbi.nlm.nih.gov/pubmed/30804476,Cellular & molecular immunology,2019 04 05,"Surgical trauma and ischemia reperfusion injury (IRI) are unavoidable aspects of any solid organ transplant procedure. They trigger a multifactorial antigen-independent inflammatory process that profoundly affects both the early and long-term outcomes of the transplanted organ. The injury associated with donor organ procurement, storage, and engraftment triggers innate immune activation that inevitably results in cell death, which may occur in many different forms. Dying cells in donor grafts release damage-associated molecular patterns (DAMPs), which alert recipient innate cells, including macrophages and dendritic cells (DCs), through the activation of the complement cascade and toll-like receptors (TLRs). The long-term effect of inflammation on innate immune cells is associated with changes in cellular metabolism that skew the cells towards aerobic glycolysis, resulting in innate immune cell activation and inflammatory cytokine production. The different roles of proinflammatory cytokines in innate immune activation have been described, and these cytokines also stimulate optimal T-cell expansion during allograft rejection. Therefore, early innate immune events after organ transplantation determine the fate of the adaptive immune response. In this review, we summarize the contributions of innate immunity to allograft rejection and discuss recent studies and emerging concepts in the targeted delivery of therapeutics to modulate the innate immune system to enhance allograft survival.","Innate lymphocytes-lineage, localization and timing of differentiation.",https://www.ncbi.nlm.nih.gov/pubmed/30804475,Cellular & molecular immunology,2019 02 26,"Innate lymphocytes are a diverse population of cells that carry out specialized functions in steady-state homeostasis and during immune challenge. While circulating cytotoxic natural killer (NK) cells have been studied for decades, tissue-resident innate lymphoid cells (ILCs) have only been characterized and studied over the past few years. As ILCs have been largely viewed in the context of helper T-cell biology, models of ILC lineage and function have been founded within this perspective. Notably, tissue-resident innate lymphocytes with cytotoxic potential have been described in an array of tissues, yet whether they are derived from the NK or ILC lineage is only beginning to be elucidated. In this review, we aim to shed light on the identities of innate lymphocytes through the lenses of cell lineage, localization, and timing of differentiation.",Preserved multisensory body representations in advanced age.,https://www.ncbi.nlm.nih.gov/pubmed/30804474,Scientific reports,2019 03 01,"The internal representation of the body emerges via the integration of multisensory body cues. Sensory signal transfer and the ability to integrate multisensory information deteriorate significantly with increasing age. However, there is little empirical evidence on age-related changes in body representations based on multisensory integration. Here, we used a standard paradigm for evaluating body representations based on multisensory integration, the rubber hand illusion, and compared the amount of proprioceptive drift and changes in perceived body ownership triggered by the integration of visual, tactile, and proprioceptive cues between younger and older adults. To account for potential age-related differences in the temporal stability of the illusion, proprioceptive drift was measured at five different time points. Our results show that older adults used synchronous visuo-tactile cues similarly to younger adults to update both the position of their own hand, and their feeling of ownership over the artificial hand. Independent of visuo-tactile synchrony, older adults perceived their hand as closer to their body than younger adults did, and showed a less stable representation of this in-depth hand position. This proprioceptive bias towards the body did not correlate with the strength of the illusion. Our results indicate that the integration of visual and tactile cues is largely preserved in advanced age when used to update limb position, whereas proprioception worsens with age. This may be linked to two different pathways that underlie changes in body representations over the life span.",ING3 is required for ATM signaling and DNA repair in response to DNA double strand breaks.,https://www.ncbi.nlm.nih.gov/pubmed/30804473,Cell death and differentiation,2019 02 26,"Inhibitor of Growth 3 (ING3) is a candidate tumor suppressor gene whose expression is lost in tumors such as hepatocellular carcinoma, head and neck squamous cell carcinoma and melanoma. In the present study, we show that ING3-depleted human cells and yeast cells deleted for its ortholog YNG2 are sensitive to DNA damage suggesting a conserved role in response to such stress. In human cells, ING3 is recruited to DNA double strand breaks and is required for ATM activation. Remarkably, in response to doxorubicin, ATM activation is dependent on ING3 but not on TIP60, whose recruitment to DNA breaks also depends on ING3. These events lead to ATM-mediated phosphorylation of NBS1 and the subsequent recruitment of RNF8, RNF168, 53BP1, and BRCA1, which are major mediators of the DNA damage response. Accordingly, upon genotoxic stress, DNA repair by non-homologous end joining (NHEJ) or homologous recombination (HR) were impaired in absence of ING3. Finally, immunoglobulin class switch recombination (CSR), a physiological mechanism requiring NHEJ repair, was impaired in the absence of ING3. Since deregulation of DNA double strand break repair is associated with genomic instability, we propose a novel function of ING3 as a caretaker tumor suppressor involved in the DNA damage signaling and repair.",Ly6G+ inflammatory cells enable the conversion of cancer cells to cancer stem cells in an irradiated glioblastoma model.,https://www.ncbi.nlm.nih.gov/pubmed/30804471,Cell death and differentiation,2019 02 26,"Most glioblastomas frequently recur at sites of radiotherapy, but it is unclear if changes in the tumor microenvironment due to radiotherapy influence glioblastoma recurrence. Here, we demonstrate that radiation-induced senescent glioblastoma cells exhibit a senescence-associated secretory phenotype that functions through NFκB signaling to influence changes in the tumor microenvironment, such as recruitment of Ly6G+ inflammatory cells and vessel formation. In particular, Ly6G+ cells promote conversion of glioblastoma cells to glioblastoma stem cells (GSCs) through the NOS2-NO-ID4 regulatory axis. Specific inhibition of NFκB signaling in irradiated glioma cells using the IκBα super repressor prevents changes in the tumor microenvironment and dedifferentiation of glioblastoma cells. Treatment with Ly6G-neutralizing antibodies also reduces the number of GSCs and prolongs survival in tumor-bearing mice after radiotherapy. Clinically, a positive correlation exists between Ly6G+ cells and the NOS2-NO-ID4 regulatory axis in patients diagnosed with recurrent glioblastoma. Together, our results illustrate important roles for Ly6G+ inflammatory cells recruited by radiation-induced SASP in cancer cell dedifferentiation and tumor recurrence.",Blockade of ALK4/5 signaling suppresses cadmium- and erastin-induced cell death in renal proximal tubular epithelial cells via distinct signaling mechanisms.,https://www.ncbi.nlm.nih.gov/pubmed/30804470,Cell death and differentiation,2019 02 26,"Various types of cell death, including apoptosis, necrosis, necroptosis, and ferroptosis, are induced in renal tubular epithelial cells following exposure to environmental stresses and toxicants such as osmotic stress, ischemia/reperfusion injury, cisplatin, and cadmium. This is known to cause renal dysfunction, but the cellular events preceding stress-induced cell death in renal tubules are not fully elucidated. The activin receptor-like kinase (ALK) 4/5, also known as activin-transforming growth factor (TGF) β receptor, is involved in stress-induced renal injury. We, therefore, studied the role of ALK4/5 signaling in HK-2 human proximal tubular epithelial cell death induced by cisplatin, cadmium, hyperosmotic stress inducer, sorbitol, and the ferroptosis activator, erastin. We found that ALK4/5 signaling is involved in cadmium- and erastin-induced cell death, but not sorbitol- or cisplatin-induced apoptotic cell death. Cadmium exposure elevated the level of phosphorylated Smad3, and treatment with the ALK4/5 kinase inhibitors, SB431542 or SB505124, suppressed cadmium-induced HK-2 cell death. Cadmium-induced cell death was attenuated by siRNA-mediated ALK4 or Smad3 silencing, or by treatment with SIS3, a selective inhibitor of TGFβ1-dependent Smad3 phosphorylation. Furthermore, ALK4/5 signaling activated Akt signaling to promote cadmium-induced HK-2 cell death. In contrast, siRNA-mediated Inhibin-bA silencing or treatment with TGFβ1 or activin A had little effect on cadmium-induced HK-2 cell death. On the other hand, treatment with SB431542 or SB505124 attenuated erastin-induced ferroptosis by hyperactivating Nrf2 signaling in HK-2 cells. These results suggest that blockade of ALK4/5 signaling protects against cadmium- and erastin-induced HK-2 cell death via Akt and Nrf2 signaling pathways, respectively.","Insights into the antigenic advancement of influenza A(H3N2) viruses, 2011-2018.",https://www.ncbi.nlm.nih.gov/pubmed/30804469,Scientific reports,2019 03 01,"Influenza A(H3N2) viruses evade human immunity primarily by acquiring antigenic changes in the haemagglutinin (HA). HA receptor-binding features of contemporary A(H3N2) viruses hinder traditional antigenic characterization using haemagglutination inhibition and promote selection of HA mutants. Thus, alternative approaches are needed to reliably assess antigenic relatedness between circulating viruses and vaccines. We developed a high content imaging-based neutralization test (HINT) to reduce antigenic mischaracterization resulting from virus adaptation to cell culture. Ferret reference antisera were raised using clinical specimens containing viruses representing recent vaccine strains. Analysis of viruses circulating during 2011-2018 showed that gain of an N158-linked glycosylation in HA was a molecular determinant of antigenic distancing between A/Hong Kong/4801/2014-like (clade 3C.2a) and A/Texas/50/2012-like viruses (clade 3C.1), while multiple evolutionary HA F193S substitution were linked to antigenic distancing from A/Switzerland/97152963/2013-like (clade 3C.3a) and further antigenic distancing from A/Texas/50/2012-like viruses. Additionally, a few viruses carrying HA T135K and/or I192T showed reduced neutralization by A/Hong Kong/4801/2014-like antiserum. Notably, this technique elucidated the antigenic characteristics of clinical specimens, enabling direct characterization of viruses produced in vivo, and eliminating in vitro culture, which rapidly alters the genotype/phenotype.

However, systematic studies on the 1D character of charge carriers have not been done yet. Here, we report on systematic and comparative studies on the energy-momentum dispersion relationships of layered transition metal dichalcogenides ReS2 and ReSe2 by angle resolved photoemission. We found that the valence band maximum or the minimum energy for holes is located at the high symmetric Z-point for both materials. However, the out-of-plane ([Formula: see text]) dispersion for ReSe2 (20 meV) is found to be much smaller than that of ReS2 (150 meV). We observe that the effective mass of the hole carriers along the direction perpendicular to the chain is about 4 times larger than that along the chain direction for both ReS2 and ReSe2. Remarkably, the experimentally measured hole effective mass is about twice heavier than that from first principles calculation for ReS2 although the in-plane anisotropy values from the experiment and calculations are comparable. These observation indicate that bulk ReS2 and ReSe2 are unique semiconducting transition metal dichalcogenides having strong one-dimensional characters."

In this study, we show that the level of α-parvin is elevated in triple-negative breast cancer cells. The depletion of α-parvin from triple-negative breast cancer cells effectively inhibits breast cancer cell growth, migration, and invasion in vitro, and tumor progression and metastasis in vivo. At the molecular level, we identify Ras-GTPase-activing protein SH3-domain-binding protein 2 (G3BP2) as an α-parvin-binding protein. Knockdown of α-parvin promotes G3BP2 interaction with TWIST1, increases ubiquitination and proteasome-dependent degradation of TWIST1, and consequently reduces the cellular level of TWIST1 and its downstream signaling. Importantly, the depletion of G3BP2 reverses the reduction in the level and signaling of TWIST1 and the suppression of breast cancer progression induced by the loss of α-parvin. Furthermore, the re-expression of an α-parvin mutant in which the G3BP2-binding site is ablated, unlike that of wild-type α-parvin, in α-parvin-deficient breast cancer cells, is unable to restore the level and signaling of TWIST1 and promote breast cancer progression. Finally, we show that protein level of α-parvin is highly positively correlated with that of TWIST1 in human triple-negative breast cancer patients. Our studies reveal a novel signaling pathway consisting of α-parvin, G3BP2, and TWIST1 that regulates breast cancer progression and metastasis, and suggest that the activation of this signaling pathway is a key factor for driving the progression and poor clinical outcome of human ER-negative breast cancer.",The inflammatory cytokine IL-6 induces FRA1 deacetylation promoting colorectal cancer stem-like properties.,https://www.ncbi.nlm.nih.gov/pubmed/30804456,Oncogene,2019 02 26,"Colorectal cancer (CRC) has long been known for its tight association with chronic inflammation, thought to play a key role in tumor onset and malignant progression through the modulation of cancer stemness. However, the underlying molecular and cellular mechanisms are still largely elusive. Here we show that the IL-6/STAT3 inflammatory signaling axis induces the deacetylation of FRA1 at the Lys-116 residue located within its DNA-binding domain. The HDAC6 deacetylase underlies this key modification leading to the increase of FRA1 transcriptional activity, the subsequent transactivation of NANOG expression, and the acquisition of stem-like cellular features. As validated in a large (n = 123) CRC cohort, IL-6 secretion was invariably accompanied by increased FRA1 deacetylation at K116 and an overall increase in its protein levels, coincident with malignant progression and poor prognosis. Of note, combined treatment with the conventional cytotoxic drug 5-FU together with Tubastatin A, a HDAC6-specific inhibitor, resulted in a significant in vivo synergistic inhibitory effect on tumor growth through suppression of CRC stemness. Our results reveal a novel transcriptional and posttranslational regulatory cross-talk between inflammation and stemness signaling pathways that underlie self-renewal and maintenance of CRC stem cells and promote their malignant behavior. Combinatorial treatment aimed at the core regulatory mechanisms downstream of IL-6 may offer a novel promising approach for CRC treatment.",[18F]BODIPY-triglyceride-containing chylomicron-like particles as an imaging agent for brown adipose tissue in vivo.,https://www.ncbi.nlm.nih.gov/pubmed/30804455,Scientific reports,2019 03 01,"Brown adipose tissue (BAT) is present in human adults and the current gold standard to visualize and quantify BAT is [18F]FDG PET-CT. However, this method fails to detect BAT under insulin-resistant conditions associated with ageing and weight gain, such as type 2 diabetes. The aim of this study was to develop a novel triglyceride-based tracer for BAT. For this purpose we designed a dual-modal fluorescent/PET fatty acid tracer based on commercially available BODIPY-FL-C16, which can be esterified to its correspondent triglyceride, radiolabeled and incorporated into pre-synthesized chylomicron-like particles. BODIPY-FL-C16 was coupled to 1,2-diolein with a subsequent radiolabeling step resulting in [18F]BODIPY-C16-triglyceride that was incorporated into chylomicron-like particles. Various quality control steps using fluorescent and radioactive methods were conducted before BAT visualization was tested in mice. Triglyceride synthesis, radiolabeling and subsequent incorporation into chylomicron-like particles was carried out in decent yields. This radiotracer appeared able to visualize BAT in vivo, and the uptake of the radiotracer was stimulated by cold exposure. The here reported method can be used to incorporate radiolabeled triglycerides into pre-synthesized chylomicron-like particles. Our approach is feasible to visualize and quantify the uptake of triglyceride-derived fatty acids by BAT.","Biomolecular Interaction, Anti-Cancer and Anti-Angiogenic Properties of Cobalt(III) Schiff Base Complexes.",https://www.ncbi.nlm.nih.gov/pubmed/30804454,Scientific reports,2019 03 01,"Two cobalt(III) Schiff base complexes, trans-[Co(salen)(DA)2](ClO4) (1) and trans-[Co(salophen)(DA)2](ClO4) (2) (where salen: N,N'-bis(salicylidene)ethylenediamine, salopen: N,N'-bis(salicylidene)-1,2-phenylenediamine, DA: dodecylamine) were synthesised and characterised using various spectroscopic and analytical techniques. The binding affinity of both the complexes with CT-DNA was explored adopting UV-visible, fluorescence, circular dichroism spectroscopy and cyclic voltammetry techniques. The results revealed that both the complexes interacted with DNA via intercalation as well as notable groove binding. Protein (BSA) binding ability of these complexes was investigated by absorption and emission spectroscopy which indicate that these complexes engage in strong hydrophobic interaction with BSA. The mode of interaction between these complexes and CT-DNA/BSA was studied by molecular docking analysis. The in vitro cytotoxic property of the complexes was evaluated in A549 (human small cell lung carcinoma) and VERO (African green monkey kidney cells). The results revealed that the complexes affect viability of the cells. AO and EB staining and cell cycle analysis revealed that the mode of cell death is apoptosis. Both the complexes showed profound inhibition of angiogenesis as revealed in in-vivo chicken chorioallantoic membrane (CAM) assay. Of the two complexes, the complex 2 proved to be much more efficient in affecting the viability of lung cancer cells than complex 1. These results indicate that the cobalt(III) Schiff base complexes in this study can be potentially used for cancer chemotherapy and as inhibitor of angiogenesis, in general, and lung cancer in particular, for which there is need for substantiation at the level of signalling mechanisms and gene expressions.",Tobacco mosaic virus infection triggers an RNAi-based response in Phytophthora infestans.,https://www.ncbi.nlm.nih.gov/pubmed/30804453,Scientific reports,2019 03 01,"RNA interference (RNAi) is a sequence identity-dependent RNA degradation mechanism conserved in eukaryotic organisms. One of the roles of RNAi is as a defense system against viral infections, which has been demonstrated in filamentous fungi but not in oomycetes. We investigated the virus-RNAi interplay in the oomycete Phytophthora infestans using a crucifer-infecting strain of the plant virus tobacco mosaic virus (TMVcr) and its derivative TMVcr-Δ122 that is mutated in the sequence of the p122 replicase subunit and thus inhibited in RNA suppression activity. In this study we provide evidence that replication of TMVcr-Δ122 but not of TMVcr was impaired in P. infestans as well as in tobacco plants used as positive control. The interference was associated with induction of high transcription of dicer-like genes Pidcl2 and NtDCL2 and of RNA-dependent-RNA-polymerase Pirdr1 and NtRDR1 in P. infestans and tobacco, respectively. These high transcription levels suggest an RNAi-based response that TMVcr-Δ122 mutant was not able to suppress.

Data from the 2014 Ghana Demographic and Health Survey, a nationally representative population-based survey was analysed for this study. A total of 4751 women who had anthropometric (height and weight) data qualified for inclusion in this study. In linear regression modelling, charcoal use resulted in 3.08 kg (95% CI: 2.04, 4.12) and 0.81 kg/m2 (95%CI: 0.29, 1.33) reduction in weight and body mass index (BMI), respectively, compared to clean fuel (electricity, liquefied petroleum gas and natural gas) use.

However, Paneth cell secretory responses remain debatable and the mechanisms that regulate the secretion are not well understood. Although enteroids, three-dimensional cultures of small intestinal epithelial cells, have proven useful for analyzing intestinal epithelial cell functions including ion transport, their closed structures have imposed limitations to investigating interactions between Paneth cells and the intestinal microbiota. Here, we report that microinjection of bacteria or lipopolysaccharide (LPS) into the enteroid lumen provides an ex vivo system for studying Paneth cell secretion in real-time. The results show that Paneth cells released granules immediately when the apical surfaces of enteroid epithelial cells were exposed to LPS or live bacteria by microinjection. However, Paneth cells did not respond to LPS delivered in culture media to enteroid exterior basolateral surface, although they responded to basolateral carbamyl choline. In addition, Paneth cells replenished their granules after secretion, enabling responses to second stimulation. These findings provide new insight for apically-induced Paneth cell secretory responses in regulating the intestinal environment.",The bacterial community of Quesnel Lake sediments impacted by a catastrophic mine tailings spill differ in composition from those at undisturbed locations - two years post-spill.,https://www.ncbi.nlm.nih.gov/pubmed/30804448,Scientific reports,2019 03 01,"The West Basin of Quesnel Lake (British Columbia, Canada) suffered a catastrophic disturbance event in August 2014 when mine tailings and scoured natural material were deposited into the lake's West Basin due to an impoundment failure at the adjacent Mount Polley copper-gold mine. The deposit covered a significant portion of the West Basin floor with a thick layer of material. Since lake sediments host bacterial communities that play key roles in the geochemical cycling in lacustrine environments, it is important to understand which groups inhabit the newly deposited material and what this implies for the ecological function of the West Basin. Here we report a study conducted two years post-spill, comparing the bacterial communities from sediments of both disturbed and undisturbed sites. Our results show that sediments from disturbed sites differed in physical and chemical properties than those in undisturbed sites (e.g. higher pH, particle size and Cu concentration). Furthermore, bacterial communities from the disturbed sites appeared to be legacy communities from the tailings impoundment, with metabolic potential revolving mainly around the cycling of S and metals, whereas the ones from the undisturbed sites were associated with the cycling of N.",Quantum Fisher information of atomic system interacting with a single cavity mode in the presence of Kerr medium.,https://www.ncbi.nlm.nih.gov/pubmed/30804447,Scientific reports,2019 03 01,"The quantum Fisher information of an atomic system interacting with a single cavity mode in the presence of Kerr medium is discussed. It is shown that quantum Fisher information for an initial separable atomic system is larger than that depicted for the initial entangled atomic system. For initial vacuum state of the cavity mode, the quantum Fisher information with respect to the Kerr medium and the phase decoherence parameter is larger than that displayed for the detuning parameter. Both phase decoherence and Kerr medium have the same effect on the decay of quantum Fisher information, while they have an opposite effect on its maximum values.",Substituting the catalytic proline of 4-oxalocrotonate tautomerase with non-canonical analogues reveals a finely tuned catalytic system.,https://www.ncbi.nlm.nih.gov/pubmed/30804446,Scientific reports,2019 03 01,"The enzyme 4-oxalocrotonate tautomerase shows remarkable catalytic versatility due to the secondary amine of its N-terminal proline moiety. In this work, we incorporated a range of proline analogues into the enzyme and examined the effects on structure and activity. While the structure of the enzyme remained unperturbed, its promiscuous Michael-type activity was severely affected. This finding demonstrates how atomic changes in a biocatalytic system can abolish its activity. Our work provides a toolbox for successful generation of enzyme variants with non-canonical catalytic proline analogues."

However, their bioavailability is low. In this study, we investigated whether low concentrations in the physiological range could promote glucose uptake in L6 myotubes, as well as the underlying molecular mechanisms. We found that 0.1 nM and 1 nM quercetin or 1 nM isorhamnetin significantly increased glucose uptake via translocation of glucose transporter type 4 (GLUT4) to the plasma membrane of L6 myotubes. Quercetin principally activated the CaMKKβ/AMPK signalling pathway at these concentrations, but also activated IRS1/PI3K/Akt signalling at 10 nM. In contrast, 1 nM and 10 nM isorhamnetin principally activated the JAK/STAT pathway. Treatment with siAMPKα and siJAK2 abolished quercetin- and isorhamnetin-induced GLUT4 translocation, respectively. However, treatment with siJAK3 did not affect isorhamnetin-induced GLUT4 translocation, indicating that isorhamnetin induced GLUT4 translocation mainly through JAK2, but not JAK3, signalling. Thus, quercetin preferably activated the AMPK pathway and, accordingly, stimulated IRS1/PI3K/Akt signalling, while isorhamnetin activated the JAK2/STAT pathway. Furthermore, after oral administration of quercetin glycoside at 10 and 100 mg/kg body weight significantly induced GLUT4 translocation to the plasma membrane of skeletal muscles in mice. In the same animals, plasma concentrations of quercetin aglycone form were 4.95 and 6.80 nM, respectively. In conclusion, at low-concentration ranges, quercetin and isorhamnetin promote glucose uptake by increasing GLUT4 translocation via different signalling pathways in skeletal muscle cells; thus, these compounds may possess beneficial functions for maintaining glucose homeostasis by preventing hyperglycaemia at physiological concentrations.",Neuropeptides Substance P and Calcitonin Gene Related Peptide Accelerate the Development and Fibrogenesis of Endometriosis.,https://www.ncbi.nlm.nih.gov/pubmed/30804432,Scientific reports,2019 03 01,"Endometriotic lesions are known to be hyperinnervated, especially in lesions of deep endometriosis (DE), which are frequently in close proximity to various nerve plexuses. DE lesions typically have higher fibromuscular content than that of ovarian endometriomas (OE) lesions, but the underlying reason remains elusive. Aside from their traditional role of pain transduction, however, whether or not sensory nerves play any role in the development of endometriosis is unclear. Here, we show that, thorough their respective receptors neurokinin receptor 1 (NK1R), calcitonin receptor like receptor (CRLR), and receptor activity modifying protein 1 (RAMP-1), neuropeptides substance P (SP) and calcitonin gene related peptide (CGRP) induce epithelial-mesenchymal transition (EMT), fibroblast-to-myofibroblast transdifferentiation (FMT) and further turn stromal cells into smooth muscle cells (SMCs) in endometriotic lesions, resulting ultimately in fibrosis. We show that SP and CGRP, or the rat dorsal root ganglia (DRG) supernatant, through the induction of NK1R and CGRP/CRLR/RAMP-1 signaling pathways, promoted EMT, FMT and SMM in endometriosis, resulting in increased migratory and invasive propensity, cell contractility, production of collagen, and eventually to fibrosis. Neutralization of NK1R and/or CGRP/CRLR/RAMP-1 abrogated these processes. Extended exposure of endometriotic stromal cells to SP and/or CGRP or the DRG supernatant induced increased expression of α-SMA, desmin, oxytocin receptor, and smooth muscle myosin heavy-chain. Finally, we show that DE lesions had significantly higher nerve fiber density, increased staining levels of α-SMA, NK1R, CRLR, and RAMP-1, concomitant with higher lesional fibrotic content than that of OE lesions. The extent of lesional fibrosis correlated positively with the staining levels of NK1R, CRLR, and RAMP-1, as well as the nerve fiber density in lesions. Thus, this study provides another piece of evidence that sensory nerves play an important role in promoting the development and fibrogenesis of endometriosis. It explains as why DE frequently have higher fibromuscular content than that of OE, highlights the importance of lesional microenvironment in shaping the lesional fate, gives more credence to the idea that ectopic endometrium is fundamentally wounds that go through repeated tissue injury and repair, and should shed much needed light into the pathophysiology of endometriosis.","Water table management and fertilizer application impacts on CO2, N2O and CH4 fluxes in a corn agro-ecosystem.",https://www.ncbi.nlm.nih.gov/pubmed/30804431,Scientific reports,2019 03 01,"Water table management with controlled drainage and subsurface-irrigation (SI) has been identified as a Beneficial Management Practice (BMP) to reduce nitrate leaching in drainage water. It has also been shown to increase crop yields during dry periods of the growing season, by providing water to the crop root zone, via upward flux or capillary rise. However, by retaining nitrates in anoxic conditions within the soil profile, SI could potentially increase greenhouse gas (GHG) fluxes, particularly N2O through denitrification. This process may be further exacerbated by high precipitation and mineral N-fertilizer applications very early in the growing season. In order to investigate the effects of water table management (WTM) with nitrogen fertilization on GHG fluxes from corn (Zea mays) agro-ecosystems, we conducted a research study on a commercial farm in south-western Quebec, Canada. Water table management treatments were: free drainage (FD) and controlled drainage with subsurface-irrigation. GHG samples were taken using field-deployed, vented non-steady state gas chambers to quantify soil CO2, N2O and CH4 fluxes weekly. Our results indicate that fertilizer application timing coinciding with intense (≥24 mm) precipitation events and high temperatures (>25 °C) triggered pulses of N2O fluxes, accounting for up to 60% of cumulative N2O fluxes. Our results also suggest that splitting bulk fertilizer applications may be an effective mitigation strategy, reducing N2O fluxes by 50% in our study. In both seasons, pulse GHG fluxes mostly occurred in the early vegetative stages of the corn, prior to activation of the subsurface-irrigation. Our results suggest that proper timing of WTM mindful of seasonal climatic conditions has the potential to reduce GHG emissions.",Ezrin promotes breast cancer progression by modulating AKT signals.,https://www.ncbi.nlm.nih.gov/pubmed/30804430,British journal of cancer,2019 04 03,"Ezrin, which is known as a cytoskeleton linker protein, is closely linked with the metastatic progression of cancer and is frequently abnormally expressed in aggressive cancer types.

Dysfunction of the DCA muscle leads to arytenoid collapse during exercise, resulting in poor performance. An electrodiagnostic study including electromyography of the dorsal cricoarytenoid muscles and conduction velocity testing of the innervating recurrent laryngeal nerves (RLn) was conducted in horses with normal laryngeal function. We detected reduced nerve conduction velocity of the left RLn, compared to the right, and pathologic spontaneous activity (PSA) of myoelectrical activity within the left DCA muscle in half of this horse population and the horses with the slowest nerve conduction velocities. The findings in this group of horses are consistent with left sided demyelination and axonal loss, consistent with Recurrent Laryngeal Neuropathy (RLN), a highly prevalent degenerative disorder of the RLn in horses that predominantly affects the left side. The detection of electromyographic changes compatible with RLN in clinically unaffected horses is consistent with previous studies that identified ""subclinical"" subjects, presenting normal laryngeal function despite neuropathologic changes within nerve and muscle confirmed histologically.",MEK-ERK signaling is a therapeutic target in metastatic castration resistant prostate cancer.,https://www.ncbi.nlm.nih.gov/pubmed/30804427,Prostate cancer and prostatic diseases,2019 06 10,"Metastatic castration resistant prostate cancer (mCRPC) is incurable and progression after drugs that target the androgen receptor-signaling axis is inevitable.

The primary outcome was that transmission occurred approximately one day prior to development of visible signs of disease (posterior median 21 hours, 95% CI: 1.1-45.0). Updated disease state durations were incorporated into a simulation model to examine the importance of addressing preclinical transmission in the face of robust response measures. Simulation of FMD outbreaks in the US pig production sector demonstrated that including a preclinical infectious period of one day would result in a 40% increase in the median number of farms affected (166 additional farms and 664,912 pigs euthanized) compared to the scenario of no preclinical transmission, assuming suboptimal outbreak response.

Monsoon rains water two-thirds of India's harvest. However, the monsoon season also causes large-scale flooding, resulting in loss of human life and economic damage estimated around $7 billion annually. Beryllium-7 is a tracer that can be used to monitor the intensity of stratosphere-troposphere exchange, which varies in accordance with the annual cycle of the global atmospheric circulation (Hadley, Ferrel and Polar cells). Based on the beryllium-7 data collected globally as part of the monitoring of the Comprehensive Nuclear-Test-Ban Treaty, the presented empirical method demonstrates the possibility to predict the start, withdrawal and intensity of the Indian monsoon season. Onset can be forecasted with an unprecedented accuracy of ±3 days, 2 months in advance compared to 1-3 weeks in advance by traditional methods. Applying this new method will enable better preparation for economic and natural hazard impacts of the monsoon season in India. This method can also be extended to other regions where the movement of Hadley cells governs monsoon onset and withdrawal.","Asthma, Rhinoconjunctivitis, Eczema, and the Association with Perinatal Anthropometric Factors in Vietnamese Children.",https://www.ncbi.nlm.nih.gov/pubmed/30804411,Scientific reports,2019 03 01,"Few studies have investigated possible causative and protective factors associated with allergic diseases in resource-limited countries, Southeast Asia.

Oligoribonuclease (ORN) is a 3'-5' exoribonuclease for small RNA molecules, important in RNA degradation and re-utilisation. However, there is no structural information on the ligand-binding form of ORNs. In this study, the crystal structures of oligoribonuclease from Colwellia psychrerythraea strain 34H (CpsORN) were determined in four different forms: unliganded-structure, thymidine 5'-monophosphate p-nitrophenyl ester (pNP-TMP)-bound, two separated uridine-bound, and two linked uridine (U-U)-bound forms. The crystal structures show that CpsORN is a tight dimer, with two separated active sites and one divalent metal cation ion in each active site. These structures represent several snapshots of the enzymatic reaction process, which allowed us to suggest a possible one-metal-dependent reaction mechanism for CpsORN. Moreover, the biochemical data support our suggested mechanism and identified the key residues responsible for enzymatic catalysis of CpsORN.",Bautin bifurcations in a forest-grassland ecosystem with human-environment interactions.,https://www.ncbi.nlm.nih.gov/pubmed/30804408,Scientific reports,2019 03 01,"Ecosystems may be characterized by a complex dynamical behaviour where external disturbances and/or internal perturbations may trigger sudden/irreversible changes, called catastrophic shifts. Simple mathematical models in the form of ordinary and/or partial differential equations have been proposed to approximate in a qualitatively manner the observed complex phenomena, where catastrophic shifts are determined by bifurcation points. In this work, we show that in ecosystems, gradual/smooth changes may be transformed in sudden/catastrophic shifts as a consequence of codimension-2 bifurcations. We stress the importance of using the full arsenal of numerical bifurcation theory to systematically identify and characterize criticalities in ecological models in the 2D parameter space. For our demonstrations, we revisit the analysis of a simple model of a forest-grassland mosaic ecosystem constructing the 2D bifurcation diagram with respect to the impact of human influence and that of natural causes.

All tested Campylobacter strains showed higher survival in beef liver juice (BLJ) and chicken liver juice (CLJ) as compared to beef and chicken juices (BJ and CJ) or Mueller Hinton broth (MHB) at 4 °C. Overall, C. jejuni strains showed greater survival in retail liver and meat juices as compared to C. coli. CLJ enhanced biofilm formation of most C. coli strains and supported growth in favorable conditions. When diluted, retail liver and meat juices enhanced survival of Campylobacter strains at low temperatures and increased aerotolerance. In conclusion, beef and chicken liver juices enhanced the survival of C. jejuni and C. coli strains at low temperatures, which helps explain the high prevalence of Campylobacter spp. in retail liver products.",Angiotensin-converting enzyme inhibitors or angiotensin receptor blocker monotherapy retard deterioration of renal function in Taiwanese chronic kidney disease population.,https://www.ncbi.nlm.nih.gov/pubmed/30804406,Scientific reports,2019 03 01,"It remains unclear how different uses of angiotensin-converting inhibitors (ACEIs) or angiotensin receptor blockers (ARBs) influence the progression of chronic kidney disease (CKD).

Patients treated with ACEI or ARB for ≥90 days during a 6-mo period comprised the study group, or no treatment, comprised the control group. The study group was subdivided on the basis of treatment: ACEI monotherapy or ARB monotherapy. Progression of renal deterioration was defined by an average eGFR decline of more than 5 mL/min/1.73 m2/yr or the commencement of dialysis. With at least 1-year follow up, a progression of renal deterioration was demonstrated in 29.70% of the control group and 25.09% of the study group. Patients in the study group had significantly reduced progression of CKD with adjusted odds ratio 0.79 (95% confidence interval: 0.63-0.99). However, when ACEI monotherapy and ARB monotherapy were analyzed separately, none of their associations with CKD progression was statistically significant.

In recent years, sequencing efforts have uncovered recurrent somatic mutations within RNA splicing factors, including SF3B1, SRSF2, U2AF1 and ZRSR2. The most frequently mutated gene is SF3B1, mutated in 17% of MDS patients. While SF3B1 mutations and their effects on splicing have been well characterised, much remains to be explored about their more far-reaching effects on cellular homeostasis. Given that mRNA splicing and nuclear export are coordinated processes, we hypothesised that SF3B1 mutation might also affect export of certain mRNAs and that this may represent a targetable pathway for the treatment of SF3B1-mutant MDS. We used CRISPR/Cas9-genome editing to create isogenic cellular models. Comprehensive transcriptome and proteome profiling of these cells identified alterations in the splicing and export of components of the translational machinery, primarily tRNA synthetases, in response to the SF3B1 K700E mutation. While steady-state protein synthesis was unaffected, SF3B1 mutant cells were more sensitive to the clinically-relevant purine analogue, 8-azaguanine. In this study, we also demonstrated that 8-azaguanine affects splicing. Our results suggest that the simultaneous targeting of RNA metabolism and splicing by 8-azaguanine represents a therapeutic opportunity for SF3B1-mutant myelodysplastic syndromes.",Functionality of membrane proteins overexpressed and purified from E. coli is highly dependent upon the strain.,https://www.ncbi.nlm.nih.gov/pubmed/30804404,Scientific reports,2019 03 02,"Overexpression of correctly folded membrane proteins is a fundamental prerequisite for functional and structural studies. One of the most commonly used expression systems for the production of membrane proteins is Escherichia coli. While misfolded proteins typically aggregate and form inclusions bodies, membrane proteins that are addressed to the membrane and extractable by detergents are generally assumed to be properly folded. Accordingly, GFP fusion strategy is often used as a fluorescent proxy to monitor their expression and folding quality. Here we investigated the functionality of two different multidrug ABC transporters, the homodimer BmrA from Bacillus subtilis and the heterodimer PatA/PatB from Streptococcus pneumoniae, when produced in several E. coli strains with T7 expression system. Strikingly, while strong expression in the membrane of several strains could be achieved, we observed drastic differences in the functionality of these proteins. Moreover, we observed a general trend in which mild detergents mainly extract the population of active transporters, whereas a harsher detergent like Fos-choline 12 could solubilize transporters irrespective of their functionality. Our results suggest that the amount of T7 RNA polymerase transcripts may indirectly but notably impact the structure and activity of overexpressed membrane proteins, and advise caution when using GFP fusion strategy.","Allele specific chromatin signals, 3D interactions, and motif predictions for immune and B cell related diseases.",https://www.ncbi.nlm.nih.gov/pubmed/30804403,Scientific reports,2019 03 01,"Several Genome Wide Association Studies (GWAS) have reported variants associated to immune diseases.

ChIP-seq data for TFs and histone modifications provide snapshots of protein-DNA interactions allowing the identification of heterozygous SNPs showing significant allele specific signals (AS-SNPs). AS-SNPs can change a TF binding site resulting in altered gene regulation and are primary candidates to explain associations observed in GWAS and expression studies. We identified 17,293 unique AS-SNPs across 7 lymphoblastoid cell lines. In this set of cell lines we interrogated 85% of common genetic variants in the population for potential regulatory effect and we identified 237 AS-SNPs associated to immune GWAS traits and 714 to gene expression in B cells. To elucidate possible regulatory mechanisms we integrated long-range 3D interactions data to identify putative target genes and motif predictions to identify TFs whose binding may be affected by AS-SNPs yielding a collection of 173 AS-SNPs associated to gene expression and 60 to B cell related traits. We present a systems strategy to find functional gene regulatory variants, the TFs that bind differentially between alleles and novel strategies to detect the regulated genes."

We report here the first volcanic SO2 measurements from the hyperspectral TROPOspheric Monitoring Instrument (TROPOMI) launched in October 2017 onboard the ESA's Sentinel-5 Precursor platform. Using the operational processing algorithm, we explore the benefit of improved spatial resolution to the monitoring of global volcanic degassing. We find that TROPOMI surpasses any space nadir sensor in its ability to detect weak degassing signals and captures day-to-day changes in SO2 emissions. The detection limit of TROPOMI to SO2 emissions is a factor of 4 better than the heritage Aura/Ozone Monitoring Instrument (OMI). Here we show that TROPOMI SO2 daily observations carry a wealth of information on volcanic activity. Provided with adequate wind speed data, temporally resolved SO2 fluxes can be obtained at hourly time steps or shorter. We anticipate that TROPOMI SO2 data will help to monitor global volcanic daily degassing and better understand volcanic processes and impacts.",Computational Drug Repositioning for Gastric Cancer using Reversal Gene Expression Profiles.,https://www.ncbi.nlm.nih.gov/pubmed/30804389,Scientific reports,2019 03 01,"Treatment of gastric cancer (GC) often produces poor outcomes. Moreover, predicting which GC treatments will be effective remains challenging. Computational drug repositioning using public databases is a promising and efficient tool for discovering new uses for existing drugs. Here we used a computational reversal of gene expression approach based on effects on gene expression signatures by GC disease and drugs to explore new GC drug candidates. Gene expression profiles for individual GC tumoral and normal gastric tissue samples were downloaded from the Gene Expression Omnibus (GEO) and differentially expressed genes (DEGs) in GC were determined with a meta-signature analysis. Profiles drug activity and drug-induced gene expression were downloaded from the ChEMBL and the LINCS databases, respectively. Candidate drugs to treat GC were predicted using reversal gene expression score (RGES). Drug candidates including sorafenib, olaparib, elesclomol, tanespimycin, selumetinib, and ponatinib were predicted to be active for treatment of GC. Meanwhile, GC-related genes such as PLOD3, COL4A1, UBE2C, MIF, and PRPF5 were identified as having gene expression profiles that can be reversed by drugs. These findings support the use of a computational reversal gene expression approach to identify new drug candidates that can be used to treat GC.",The Impact of Future Fuel Consumption on Regional Air Quality in Southeast Asia.,https://www.ncbi.nlm.nih.gov/pubmed/30804388,Scientific reports,2019 03 01,"Aerosols emitted from fossil fuel burning can cause air quality and human health issues. In this sensitivity study, we examine the impact of fossil fuel aerosols on air quality in Southeast Asia under five different hypothetical fuel consumption scenarios. These scenarios reflect air pollutant outcomes of implementations of certain idealized policies in the power generation, industry, and residential sectors. Analyses based on comparison among the modeling results from these scenarios reveal the sectors that should be targeted by air pollution mitigation policy. The results reveal that in Southeast Asia, sulfate could be decreased by 25% if coal were to be replaced by natural gas in the power generation and industry sectors. Black carbon concentration would reduce 42% overall if biofuel were replaced by natural gas in the residential sector. Shipping emissions are especially critical for the urban air quality in Singapore: fine particular matters (PM2.5) could be dramatically cut by 69% in Singapore by merely eliminating shipping emissions.",Hybridization is a recurrent evolutionary stimulus in wild yeast speciation.,https://www.ncbi.nlm.nih.gov/pubmed/30804385,Nature communications,2019 05 15,"Hybridization can result in reproductively isolated and phenotypically distinct lineages that evolve as independent hybrid species. How frequently hybridization leads to speciation remains largely unknown. Here we examine the potential recurrence of hybrid speciation in the wild yeast Saccharomyces paradoxus in North America, which comprises two endemic lineages SpB and SpC, and an incipient hybrid species, SpC*. Using whole-genome sequences from more than 300 strains, we uncover the hybrid origin of another group, SpD, that emerged from hybridization between SpC* and one of its parental species, the widespread SpB. We show that SpD has the potential to evolve as a novel hybrid species, because it displays phenotypic novelties that include an intermediate transcriptome profile, and partial reproductive isolation with its most abundant sympatric parental species, SpB. Our findings show that repetitive cycles of divergence and hybridization quickly generate diversity and reproductive isolation, providing the raw material for speciation by hybridization.",Effect of sodium diffusion on the properties of CIGS solar absorbers prepared using elemental Se in a two-step process.,https://www.ncbi.nlm.nih.gov/pubmed/30804384,Scientific reports,2019 03 01,"The influence of Na diffusion from various glass substrates during a high-temperature slenization process on the microstructure and morphology of two-step formed CIGS absorber layers is investigated. In order to minimise the CIGS absorber formation time, elemental Se vapour is used to prepare the CIGS absorber. The grain sizes of the CIGS films are found to increase with increasing sodium in the glass substrates (extra clear glass, soda-lime glass, borosilicate glass). TiN and SiN thin films are used as diffusion barrier layers inserted between the glass substrate and the Mo rear conatct to tune the Na diffusion from the soda-lime glass. The interdiffusion between the In-rich CuInSe2 surface layer and the Ga-rich CuGaSe2 layer is promoted by the barrier layer, leading to larger CIGS grains. Efforts are also taken to understand the differences in Na diffusion (from the glass substrates) and their effects on the MoSe2 intermediate layer formation during the high-temperature CIGS absorber formation processes. We find that excess amounts of Na and Se are essential for the MoSe2 growth. The excessive Na in the form of Na2Sex at the CIGS/Mo interface works as a Se source and catalyses the MoSe2 formation. The Se flow in the two-step CIGS formation process must be sufficiently high to obtain high-efficiency CIGS solar cells.",By-Products of Heparin Production Provide a Diverse Source of Heparin-like and Heparan Sulfate Glycosaminoglycans.,https://www.ncbi.nlm.nih.gov/pubmed/30804383,Scientific reports,2019 03 01,"Global production of pharmaceutical heparin (Hp) is increasing, and the production process from raw mucosal material results in large amounts of waste by-products. These contain lower sulfated Hp-like and heparan sulfate (HS), as well as other glycosaminoglycans, which are bioactive entities with pharmaceutical potential. Here we describe the first purification, structural and functional characterisation of Hp-like and HS polysaccharides from the four major by-product fractions of standard heparin production. Analysis of the by-products by disaccharide composition analysis and NMR demonstrated a range of structural characteristics which differentiate them from Hp (particularly reduced sulfation and sulfated disaccharide content), and that they are each distinct. Functional properties of the purified by-products varied, each displaying distinct anticoagulant profiles in different assays, and all exhibiting significantly lower global and specific inhibition of the coagulation pathway than Hp. The by-products retained the ability to promote cell proliferation via fibroblast growth factor receptor signalling, with only minor differences between them. These collective analyses indicate that they represent an untapped and economical source of structurally-diverse Hp-like and HS polysaccharides with the potential for enhancing future structure-activity studies and uncovering new biomedical applications of these important natural products.",Differential effects of coral-giant clam assemblages on biofouling formation.,https://www.ncbi.nlm.nih.gov/pubmed/30804382,Scientific reports,2019 03 01,"To prevent the settlement and/or the growth of fouling organisms (i.e. bacteria, fungi or microalgae), benthic sessile species have developed various defense mechanisms among which the production of chemical molecules. While studies have mostly focused on the release of chemical compounds by single species, there exist limited data on multi-species assemblages. We used an integrative approach to explore the potential interactive effects of distinct assemblages of two corals species and one giant clam species on biofouling appearance and composition. Remarkably, we found distinct biofouling communities suggesting the importance of benthic sessile assemblages in biofouling control. Moreover, the assemblage of 3 species led to an inhibition of biofouling, likely through a complex of secondary metabolites. Our results highlight that through their different effect on their near environment, species assemblages might be of upmost importance for their survival and therefore, should now be taken into account for sustainable management of coral reefs.",Cholesterol bound Plasmodium falciparum co-chaperone 'PFA0660w' complexes with major virulence factor 'PfEMP1' via chaperone 'PfHsp70-x'.,https://www.ncbi.nlm.nih.gov/pubmed/30804381,Scientific reports,2019 03 01,"Lethality of Plasmodium falciparum caused malaria results from 'cytoadherence', which is mainly effected by exported Plasmodium falciparum erythrocyte membrane protein 1 (PfEMP1) family. Several exported P. falciparum proteins (exportome) including chaperones alongside cholesterol rich microdomains are crucial for PfEMP1 translocation to infected erythrocyte surface. An exported Hsp40 (heat shock protein 40) 'PFA0660w' functions as a co-chaperone of 'PfHsp70-x', and these co-localize to specialized intracellular mobile structures termed J-dots. Our studies attempt to understand the function of PFA0660w-PfHsp70-x chaperone pair using recombinant proteins. Biochemical assays reveal that N and C-terminal domains of PFA0660w and PfHsp70-x respectively are critical for their activity. We show the novel direct interaction of PfHsp70-x with the cytoplasmic tail of PfEMP1, and binding of PFA0660w with cholesterol. PFA0660w operates both as a chaperone and lipid binding molecule via its separate substrate and cholesterol binding sites. PfHsp70-x interacts with cholesterol bound PFA0660w and PfEMP1 simultaneously in vitro to form a complex. Collectively, our results and the past literature support the hypothesis that PFA0660w-PfHsp70-x chaperone pair assists PfEMP1 transport across the host erythrocyte through cholesterol containing 'J-dots'. These findings further the understanding of PfEMP1 export in malaria parasites, though their in vivo validation remains to be performed.",Passive broadband full Stokes polarimeter using a Fresnel cone.,https://www.ncbi.nlm.nih.gov/pubmed/30804380,Scientific reports,2019 03 01,"Light's polarisation contains information about its source and interactions, from distant stars to biological samples. Polarimeters can recover this information, but reliance on birefringent or rotating optical elements limits their wavelength range and stability. Here we present a static, single-shot polarimeter based on a Fresnel cone - the direct spatial analogue to the popular rotating quarter-wave plate approach. We measure the average angular accuracy to be 2.9° (3.6°) for elliptical (linear) polarization states across the visible spectrum, with the degree of polarisation determined to within 0.12 (0.08). Our broadband full Stokes polarimeter is robust, cost-effective, and could find applications in hyper-spectral polarimetry and scanning microscopy.",MAOA variants differ in oscillatory EEG & ECG activities in response to aggression-inducing stimuli.,https://www.ncbi.nlm.nih.gov/pubmed/30804379,Scientific reports,2019 03 01,"Among the genetic variations in the monoamine oxidase A (MAOA) gene, upstream variable number tandem repeats (uVNTRs) of the promoter have been associated with individual differences in human physiology and aggressive behaviour. However, the evidence for a molecular or neural link between MAOA uVNTRs and aggression remains ambiguous. Additionally, the use of inconsistent promoter constructs in previous studies has added to the confusion. Therefore, it is necessary to demonstrate the genetic function of MAOA uVNTR and its effects on multiple aspects of aggression. Here, we identified three MAOA alleles in Koreans: the predominant 3.5R and 4.5R alleles, as well as the rare 2.5R allele. There was a minor difference in transcriptional efficiency between the 3.5R and 4.5R alleles, with the greatest value for the 2.5R allele, in contrast to existing research. Psychological indices of aggression did not differ among MAOA genotypes. However, our electroencephalogram and electrocardiogram results obtained under aggression-related stimulation revealed oscillatory changes as novel phenotypes that vary with the MAOA genotype. In particular, we observed prominent changes in frontal γ power and heart rate in 4.5R carriers of men. Our findings provide genetic insights into MAOA function and offer a neurobiological basis for various socio-emotional mechanisms in healthy individuals."

The shade caused by intercropping changes plant growth traits, such as soybean leaf and dry mass, thereby reducing yields. To improve the yield and elucidate the genetic mechanism of the leaf-related traits in intercropped soybeans, we measured the F6:7-8 recombinant inbred lines (RILs) derived from the cross of 'Nandou 12' and 'Jiuyuehuang' for six leaf-related traits under monoculture and relay intercropping in 2015 and 2016. We found 6366 single-nucleotide polymorphisms (SNPs) markers that covered the whole genome of soybean distributed in 20 linkage groups, which spanned 2818.67 cM with an average interval of 0.44 cM between adjacent markers. Nineteen quantitative trait loci (QTLs) were detected in two environments in 2 years. Three candidate genes associated to leaf-related traits were found according to gene expression and GO enrichment analyses. These results revealed the susceptibility of leaf phenotype to shading and helped elucidate the mechanisms that control leaf-related traits.",In Vivo Near-Infrared Fluorescence Imaging of Atherosclerosis Using Local Delivery of Novel Targeted Molecular Probes.,https://www.ncbi.nlm.nih.gov/pubmed/30804367,Scientific reports,2019 03 01,"This study aimed to evaluate the feasibility and accuracy of a technique for atherosclerosis imaging using local delivery of relatively small quantities (0.04-0.4 mg/kg) of labeled-specific imaging tracers targeting ICAM-1 and unpolymerized type I collagen or negative controls in 13 rabbits with atheroma induced by balloon injury in the abdominal aorta and a 12-week high-cholesterol diet. Immediately after local infusion, in vivo intravascular ultrasonography (IVUS)-NIRF imaging was performed at different time-points over a 40-minute period. The in vivo peak NIRF signal was significantly higher in the molecular tracer-injected rabbits than in the control-injected animals (P < 0.05). Ex vivo peak NIRF signal was significantly higher in the ICAM-1 probe-injected rabbits than in controls (P = 0.04), but not in the collagen probe-injected group (P = 0.29). NIRF signal discrimination following dual-probe delivery was also shown to be feasible in a single animal and thus offers the possibility of combining several distinct biological imaging agents in future studies. This innovative imaging strategy using in vivo local delivery of low concentrations of labeled molecular tracers followed by IVUS-NIRF catheter-based imaging holds potential for detection of vulnerable human coronary artery plaques.",Pancreatic acinar differentiation is guided by differential laminin deposition.,https://www.ncbi.nlm.nih.gov/pubmed/30804366,Scientific reports,2019 03 01,"Endothelial cells play multiple roles during pancreas organogenesis. First, they are required to instruct endoderm-derived pancreatic progenitor cells to initiate branching morphogenesis. Later, blood vessels promote β-cell differentiation but also limit acinar development. In this work, we show how endothelial cells might signal to pancreatic progenitors and spatially regulate acinar differentiation. Using an ex vivo culture system of undifferentiated E12.5 pancreata, we demonstrate that embryonic endothelial progenitor cells and their conditioned medium prevent the expression of two members of the pro-acinar transcriptional PTF1L-complex. This effect is not mediated by SPARC, a protein abundantly released in the medium conditioned by endothelial progenitors. On the contrary, heterotrimeric laminin-α1β1γ1, also produced by endothelial progenitor cells, can repress acinar differentiation when used on its own on pancreatic explants. Lastly, we found that laminin-α1 is predominantly found in vivo around the pancreatic trunk cells, as compared to the tip cells, at E14.5. In conclusion, we propose that expression or deposition of laminin-α1β1γ1 around the trunk cells, where blood vessels are predominantly localized, prevent acinar differentiation of these cells. On the contrary, transient decreased expression or deposition of laminin-α1β1γ1 around the tip cells would allow PTF1L-complex formation and acinar differentiation.",Small Peptide Ligands for Targeting EGFR in Triple Negative Breast Cancer Cells.,https://www.ncbi.nlm.nih.gov/pubmed/30804365,Scientific reports,2019 03 01,"The efficacy of chemotherapy for cancer treatment can be increased by targeted drug delivery to the cancer cells. This is particularly important for triple negative breast cancer (TNBC) for which chemotherapy is a major form of treatment. Here we designed and screened a library of 30 peptides starting with a previously reported epidermal growth factor receptor (EGFR) targeting peptide GE11 (YHWYGYTPQNVI). A direct peptide array-whole cell binding assay, where the peptides are conjugated to a cellulose membrane, was used to identify four peptides with enhanced binding to TNBC cells. Next, the four peptides were synthesized as FITC-labelled soluble peptides to study their direct uptake by TNBC cells using flow cytometry. The results showed that peptide analogue 22 had several fold higher uptake by the TNBC cells compared to the lead peptide GE11. The specific uptake of the peptide analogue 22 was confirmed by competition experiment using pure EGF protein. Further, peptide 22 showed dose dependent uptake by the TNBC MDA-MB-231 cells (105) with uptake saturating at around 2 μM peptide concentration. Thus, peptide 22 is a promising EGFR specific TNBC cell binding peptide that can be conjugated directly to a chemotherapeutic drug or to nanoparticles for targeted drug delivery to enhance the efficacy of chemotherapy for TNBC treatment.",A mycobacterial disease is associated with the silent mass mortality of the pen shell Pinna nobilis along the Tyrrhenian coastline of Italy.,https://www.ncbi.nlm.nih.gov/pubmed/30804364,Scientific reports,2019 03 01,"Disease is an increasing threat for marine bivalves worldwide. Recently, a mass mortality event (MME) impacting the bivalve Pinna nobilis was detected across a wide geographical area of the Spanish Mediterranean Sea and linked to a haplosporidian parasite. In 2017-2018, mass mortality events affecting the pen shell Pinna nobilis were recorded in two different regions of Italy, Campania and Sicily, in the Tyrrhenian Sea (Mediterranean Sea). Histopathological and molecular examinations of specimens showed the presence of Haplosporidium sp. in only one specimen in one area. Conversely, in all of the surveyed moribund animals, strong inflammatory lesions at the level of connective tissue surrounding the digestive system and gonads and linked to the presence of intracellular Zhiel-Neelsen-positive bacteria were observed. Molecular analysis of all of the diseased specimens (13) confirmed the presence of a Mycobacterium. Blast analysis of the sequences from all of the areas revealed that they were grouped together with the human mycobacterium M. sherrisii close to the group including M. shigaense, M. lentiflavum and M. simiae. Based on pathological and molecular findings, it is proposed that a mycobacterial disease is associated with the mortality episodes of Pinna nobilis, indicating that, at this time, Haplosporidium sp. is not responsible for these events in Campanian and Sicilian waters.",Lévy like patterns in the small-scale movements of marsupials in an unfamiliar and risky environment.,https://www.ncbi.nlm.nih.gov/pubmed/30804363,Scientific reports,2019 03 01,"We investigate the movement patterns of three different Neotropical marsupials in an unfamiliar and risky environment. Animals are released in a matrix from which they try to reach a patch of forest. Their movements, performed on a small spacial scale, are best approximated by Lévy flights. Patterns of oriented and non-oriented individuals - with forest patches within or beyond their perceptual range - differ only slightly in the value of their exponents. These facts suggest that, for these species, the appearance of Lévy flights is the product of animals innate behaviour that emerges spontaneously, as a neutral characteristic proper of a default movement mode for alerted animals.",Hypochlorous-Acid-Generating Electrochemical Scaffold for Treatment of Wound Biofilms.,https://www.ncbi.nlm.nih.gov/pubmed/30804362,Scientific reports,2019 06 10,"Biofilm formation causes prolonged wound infections due to the dense biofilm structure, differential gene regulation to combat stress, and production of extracellular polymeric substances. Acinetobacter baumannii, Staphylococcus aureus, and Pseudomonas aeruginosa are three difficult-to-treat biofilm-forming bacteria frequently found in wound infections. This work describes a novel wound dressing in the form of an electrochemical scaffold (e-scaffold) that generates controlled, low concentrations of hypochlorous acid (HOCl) suitable for killing biofilm communities without substantially damaging host tissue. Production of HOCl near the e-scaffold surface was verified by measuring its concentration using needle-type microelectrodes. E-scaffolds producing 17, 10 and 7 mM HOCl completely eradicated S. aureus, A. baumannii, and P. aeruginosa biofilms after 3 hours, 2 hours, and 1 hour, respectively. Cytotoxicity and histopathological assessment showed no discernible harm to host tissues when e-scaffolds were applied to explant biofilms. The described strategy may provide a novel antibiotic-free strategy for treating persistent biofilm-associated infections, such as wound infections.",The effect of interventions on the transmission and spread of HIV in South Africa: a phylodynamic analysis.,https://www.ncbi.nlm.nih.gov/pubmed/30804361,Scientific reports,2019 03 02,"The epidemic in South Africa is characterized by high genetic diversity driven by multiple independent introductions. The bulk of these introductions occurred between 1985-2000 during which time HIV prevalence increased exponentially. Epidemic growth has stabilized in recent years with the implementation of several interventions. Here we identified distinct HIV clades from a large sequence dataset of southern African HIV sequences (n = 15,332). Each clade was characterized using phylodynamic and phylogeographic methods to infer their growth through time and space. The estimated date of origin for the 18 clades that were found, fell between 1979-1992 with strong growth during the 1990's. Phylogeographic reconstruction revealed wide dispersal of clades throughout the country with the city of Johannesburg as the focal point of viral dispersal. We found clear signs of decreasing growth rate in four of the clades since the advent of interventions, while other clades have continued to growth and expand. Our results demonstrate that interventions do not affect the HIV epidemic universally with major difference between different clades over time and space. Here we demonstrate the utility and flexibility of molecular epidemiological methods and demonstrate how they can potentially be a powerful tool in HIV epidemic monitoring in South Africa.",Low temperature-induced variation in plasma biochemical indices and aquaglyceroporin gene expression in the large yellow croaker Larimichthys crocea.,https://www.ncbi.nlm.nih.gov/pubmed/30804360,Scientific reports,2019 03 01,"Low temperature influences multiple physiological processes in fish. To explore the adaptability of the large yellow croaker (Larimichthys crocea) to low temperature, the concentrations of glycerol, blood urea nitrogen (BUN), and triglycerides (TG) in plasma, as well as the expression levels of metabolism-related genes aqp7 and aqp10, were measured after exposure to low temperature stress and during subsequent rewarming. In addition, tissue samples from the intestine and liver were histologically analyzed. We found that the concentrations of plasma glycerol, BUN, and TG, decreased under low temperature stress, suggesting the metabolism of fat and protein slowed at low temperature. The expression levels of aqp7 and aqp10 mRNA were also downregulated under exposure to low temperature. Interestingly, above plasma indices and gene expression returned to basic levels within 24 h after rewarming. Furthermore, the liver and the intestine were damaged under continuous low temperature stress, whereas they were repaired upon rewarming. From the above results, we concluded that aqp7 and aqp10 genes were sensitive to low temperature, and that the decrease in their expression levels at low temperature might reduce energy consumption by L. crocea. However, the adaptation to low temperature was limited because the key metabolic tissues were damaged under continuous exposure to low temperature. Interestingly, the metabolism of L. crocea was basically back to normal within 24 h of rewarming, showing that it has high capacity of self-recovery.",Presaccadic attention improves or impairs performance by enhancing sensitivity to higher spatial frequencies.,https://www.ncbi.nlm.nih.gov/pubmed/30804358,Scientific reports,2019 03 02,"Right before we move our eyes, visual performance and neural responses for the saccade target are enhanced. This effect, presaccadic attention, is considered to prioritize the saccade target and to enhance behavioral performance for the saccade target. Recent evidence has shown that presaccadic attention modulates the processing of feature information. Hitherto, it remains unknown whether presaccadic modulations on feature information are flexible, to improve performance for the task at hand, or automatic, so that they alter the featural representation similarly regardless of the task. Using a masking procedure, here we report that presaccadic attention can either improve or impair performance depending on the spatial frequency content of the visual input. These counterintuitive modulations were significant at a time window right before saccade onset. Furthermore, merely deploying covert attention within the same temporal interval without preparing a saccade did not affect performance. This study reveals that presaccadic attention not only prioritizes the saccade target, but also automatically modifies its featural representation."

Many mutations of TTR have been identified; most of these are pathogenic, but some offer protective effects. The molecular basis underlying the vastly different fibrillation behaviours of these TTR mutants is poorly understood. Here, on the basis of neutron crystallography, native mass spectrometry and modelling studies, we propose a mechanism whereby TTR can form amyloid fibrils via a parallel equilibrium of partially unfolded species that proceeds in favour of the amyloidogenic forms of TTR. It is suggested that unfolding events within the TTR monomer originate at the C-D loop of the protein, and that destabilising mutations in this region enhance the rate of TTR fibrillation. Furthermore, it is proposed that the binding of small molecule drugs to TTR stabilises non-amyloidogenic states of TTR in a manner similar to that occurring for the protective mutants of the protein.",The Cep57-pericentrin module organizes PCM expansion and centriole engagement.,https://www.ncbi.nlm.nih.gov/pubmed/30804344,Nature communications,2019 04 17,"Centriole duplication occurs once per cell cycle to ensure robust formation of bipolar spindles and chromosome segregation. Each newly-formed daughter centriole remains connected to its mother centriole until late mitosis. The disengagement of the centriole pair is required for centriole duplication. However, the mechanisms underlying centriole engagement remain poorly understood. Here, we show that Cep57 is required for pericentriolar material (PCM) organization that regulates centriole engagement. Depletion of Cep57 causes PCM disorganization and precocious centriole disengagement during mitosis. The disengaged daughter centrioles acquire ectopic microtubule-organizing-center activity, which results in chromosome mis-segregation. Similar defects are observed in mosaic variegated aneuploidy syndrome patient cells with cep57 mutations. We also find that Cep57 binds to the well-conserved PACT domain of pericentrin. Microcephaly osteodysplastic primordial dwarfism disease pericentrin mutations impair the Cep57-pericentrin interaction and lead to PCM disorganization.

While increased homocysteine levels can cause symptoms such as osteoporosis and eye lens dislocation, high homocysteine levels are most closely associated with cardiovascular complications. Recent advances have shown that increased plasma Hcy is also a fundamental cause of neurodegenerative diseases (including Alzheimer's disease, Parkinson's disease, and dementia), diabetes, Down syndrome, and megaloblastic anemia, among others. In recent years, increased plasma homocysteine has also been shown to be closely related to cancer. In this review, we discuss the relation between elevated plasma Hcy levels and cancer, and we conclude that disturbed homocysteine metabolism is associated with cancer. Future clinical perspectives are also discussed.",Perceptions of complementary/alternative medicine use and influence on evidence-based asthma medicine adherence in Malaysian children.,https://www.ncbi.nlm.nih.gov/pubmed/30804340,NPJ primary care respiratory medicine,2019 03 01,"Complementary and alternative medicine (CAM) is widely used especially in Asia including for childhood asthma. The use of CAM could influence adherence to evidence-based (E-B) medicine. We explored the views of carers of Malaysian children with asthma regarding the use of CAM for childhood asthma, and its relationship with self-reported adherence to E-B medicine. We used a screening questionnaire to identify children diagnosed with asthma from seven suburban primary schools in Malaysia. Informed consent was obtained prior to the interviews. We conducted the interviews using a semi-structured topic guide in participants' preferred language (Malay, Mandarin, or Tamil). All interviews were audio-recorded, transcribed verbatim and coded using Nvivo. Analysis was performed thematically, informed by the Necessity-Concerns Framework. A total of 46 carers (16 Malays, 21 Indians, 9 Chinese) contributed to 12 focus groups and one individual interview. We categorised participants' as 'Non-CAM'; 'CAM'; or 'combination' user. Cultural practices and beliefs in the efficacy of CAM resulted in widespread use of CAM. Most carers used CAM as 'complementary' to E-B medicine. Concerns about dependence on or side effects of E-B treatment influenced carers' decisions to rely on CAM as an 'alternative', with an important minority of accounts describing potentially harmful CAM-use. Healthcare professionals should discuss beliefs about the necessity for and concerns about use of both E-B medicine and CAM, and provide balanced information about effectiveness and safety. The aim is to improve adherence to regular E-B preventer medication and prevent delays in seeking medical advice and harmful practices associated with CAM.",Author Correction: Growth hormone regulates neuroendocrine responses to weight loss via AgRP neurons.,https://www.ncbi.nlm.nih.gov/pubmed/30804339,Nature communications,2019 03 23,"The original version of this Article contained an error in the spelling of the author J.

Although Ribo-T can support cell proliferation in the absence of wild type ribosomes, Ribo-T cells grow slower than those with wild type ribosomes. Here, we show that cell growth defect is likely explained primarily by slow Ribo-T assembly rather than its imperfect functionality. Ribo-T maturation is stalled at a late assembly stage. Several post-transcriptional rRNA modifications and some ribosomal proteins are underrepresented in the accumulated assembly intermediates and rRNA ends are incompletely trimmed. Ribosome profiling of Ribo-T cells shows no defects in translation elongation but reveals somewhat higher occupancy by Ribo-T of the start codons and to a lesser extent stop codons, suggesting that subunit tethering mildly affects the initiation and termination stages of translation. Understanding limitations of Ribo-T system offers ways for its future development.",Cleavage of GSDME by caspase-3 determines lobaplatin-induced pyroptosis in colon cancer cells.,https://www.ncbi.nlm.nih.gov/pubmed/30804337,Cell death & disease,2019 02 28,"Pyroptosis, a form of programmed cell death (PCD), has garnered increasing attention as it relates to innate immunity and diseases. However, the involvement of pyroptosis in the mechanism by which lobaplatin acts against colorectal cancer (CRC) is unclear. Our study revealed that treatment with lobaplatin reduced the viability of HT-29 and HCT116 cells in a dose-dependent manner. Morphologically, HT-29 and HCT116 cells treated with lobaplatin exhibited microscopic features of cell swelling and large bubbles emerging from the plasma membrane, and transmission electron microscopy (TEM) revealed multiple pores in the membrane. GSDME, rather than GSDMD, was cleaved in lobaplatin-induced pyroptosis in HT-29 and HCT116 cells due to caspase-3 activation. Knocking out GSDME switched lobaplatin-induced cell death from pyroptosis to apoptosis but did not affect lobaplatin-mediated inhibition of growth and tumour formation of HT-29 and HCT116 cells in vivo and in vitro. Further investigation indicates that lobaplatin induced reactive oxygen species (ROS) elevation and JNK phosphorylation. NAC, a ROS scavenger, completely reversed the pyroptosis of lobaplatin-treated HT-29 and HCT116 and JNK phosphorylation. Activated JNK recruited Bax to mitochondria, and thereby stimulated cytochrome c release to cytosol, followed by caspase-3/-9 cleavage and pyroptosis induction. Therefore, in colon cancer cells, GSDME mediates lobaplatin-induced pyroptosis downstream of the ROS/JNK/Bax-mitochondrial apoptotic pathway and caspase-3/-9 activation. Our study indicated that GSDME-dependent pyroptosis is an unrecognized mechanism by which lobaplatin eradicates neoplastic cells, which may have important implications for the clinical application of anticancer therapeutics.",Author Correction: Planar and van der Waals heterostructures for vertical tunnelling single electron transistors.,https://www.ncbi.nlm.nih.gov/pubmed/30804336,Nature communications,2019 03 23,"The original version of this Article contained an error in the spelling of the author Matthew Holwill, which was incorrectly given as Mathew Holwill.

However, the genome-reduced bacteria often show impaired growth under laboratory conditions that cannot be understood based on the removed genes. The unexpected phenotypes highlight our limited understanding of bacterial genomes. Here, we deploy adaptive laboratory evolution (ALE) to re-optimize growth performance of a genome-reduced strain. The basis for suboptimal growth is the imbalanced metabolism that is rewired during ALE. The metabolic rewiring is globally orchestrated by mutations in rpoD altering promoter binding of RNA polymerase. Lastly, the evolved strain has no translational buffering capacity, enabling effective translation of abundant mRNAs. Multi-omic analysis of the evolved strain reveals transcriptome- and translatome-wide remodeling that orchestrate metabolism and growth. These results reveal that failure of prediction may not be associated with understanding individual genes, but rather from insufficient understanding of the strain's systems biology."

Although impaired trophoblast invasion in early pregnancy is known to be closely associated with preeclampsia, the underlying mechanisms remain elusive. Here we revealed that lysyl oxidase (LOX) and LOX-like protein 2 (LOXL2) play a critical role in preeclampsia. Our results demonstrated that LOX and LOXL2 expression decreased in preeclamptic placentas. Moreover, knockdown of LOX or LOXL2 suppressed trophoblast cell migration and invasion. Mechanistically, collagen production was induced in LOX- or LOXL2-downregulated trophoblast cells through activation of the TGF-β1/Smad3 pathway. Notably, inhibition of the TGF-β1/Smad3 pathway could rescue the defects caused by LOX or LOXL2 knockdown, thereby underlining the significance of the TGF-β1/Smad3 pathway downstream of LOX and LOXL2 in trophoblast cells. Additionally, induced collagen production and activated TGF-β1/Smad3 were observed in clinical samples from preeclamptic placentas. Collectively, our study suggests that the downregulation of LOX and LOXL2 leading to reduced trophoblast cell migration and invasion through activation of the TGF-β1/Smad3/collagen pathway is relevant to preeclampsia. Thus, we proposed that LOX, LOXL2, and the TGF-β1/Smad3/collagen pathway can serve as potential markers and targets for clinical diagnosis and therapy for preeclampsia.",Vegetarian diets and risk of hospitalisation or death with diabetes in British adults: results from the EPIC-Oxford study.,https://www.ncbi.nlm.nih.gov/pubmed/30804320,Nutrition & diabetes,2019 03 06,The global prevalence of diabetes is high and rapidly increasing.

The exact pathogenesis of SIC is not well recognized. We present an unusual case of SIC that mimicked acute myopericarditis and discuss the effect of this masquerading presentation of SIC in recognizing pathophysiological association between myopericarditis and SIC and limitations of current diagnostic criteria. CASE REPORT A 47-year-old female presented with flu-like illness and pleuritic chest pain. An electrocardiogram (ECG) showed diffuse PR depressions and ST elevations, troponin 5 ng/mL, hemoglobin 14.2 mg/dL, leukocytosis (white blood cell count of 15.1×103/uL) and erythrocyte sedimentation rate (ESR) of 22.4 mm/hour. Echocardiogram showed reduced ejection fraction (EF) with apical ballooning. Catheterization showed non-obstructive coronary disease. The patient was given colchicine and ibuprofen for 1 day with symptom resolution over the next 2 days and repeat echocardiogram with preserved EF. Troponin trended down to 3.24 ng/mL and 0.44 ng/mL, 6 hours apart. ECG showed resolution of PR depressions and subsequent T wave inversions in 1, AVl, V1-V6 by day 3. The diagnosis of myopericarditis was favored by viral prodrome, fever, pleuritic pain, pericardial rub, ECG findings, and elevated ESR. History of emotional stress, characteristic ballooning of left ventricle apex with rapid resolution favored SIC. CONCLUSIONS This case showed that SIC and myocarditis need not be mutually exclusive and differentiating clinically between these 2 entities can be difficult. Alternatively, SIC can accompany other cardiac conditions like myocardial infarction, pericarditis, and myocarditis making diagnosis and management challenging. Clinicians need to be cautious while making this differentiation as duration and type of therapy may be significantly different. SIC can be considered a variant of regional inflammatory myocarditis wherein pericarditis may result secondary to extension of myocardial inflammation to overlying pericardium. The current Mayo Clinic criteria for diagnosis of SIC appears to be outdated, not accounting for such atypical presentations, and therefore needs to be revised.","Correlations of C-Reactive Protein (CRP), Interleukin-6 (IL-6), and Insulin Resistance with Cerebral Infarction in Hypertensive Patients.",https://www.ncbi.nlm.nih.gov/pubmed/30804318,Medical science monitor : international medical journal of experimental and clinical research,2019 04 10,"BACKGROUND The aim of this study was to investigate the correlations of C-reactive protein (CRP), interleukin-6 (IL-6), and insulin resistance (IR) with cerebral infarction in hypertensive patients. MATERIAL AND METHODS A total of 80 patients with cerebral infarction admitted to our hospital from March 2016 to November 2017 were selected and divided into 2 groups according to the diameter of cerebral infarction, namely, lacunar cerebral infarction group (n=40) and cerebral infarction group (n=40). The levels of high-sensitivity CRP (hs-CRP) and IL-6, homeostasis model assessment of IR (HOMA-IR) index and blood pressure level were compared between the 2 groups. The correlations of hs-CRP level, IL-6 level, and IR with the diameter of cerebral infarction, as well as the relationships of hs-CRP level and IR with the neurological function score after cerebral infarction were analyzed. RESULTS The levels of hs-CRP and IL-6 in the cerebral infarction group were significantly higher than those in the lacunar cerebral infarction group (P<0.05). The cerebral infarction group had a markedly higher HOMA-IR index than the lacunar cerebral infarction group (P<0.05), but it had remarkably decreased systolic blood pressure and diastolic blood pressure compared with those in the lacunar cerebral infarction group (P<0.05). There were positive correlations of hs-CRP level, IL-6 level, and IR with the diameter of cerebral infarction (P<0.05). The hs-CRP level and IR had positive correlations with the neurological function score after cerebral infarction (P<0.05).

Use of complementary and alternative medicine (CAM), especially ayurvedic medication, is widespread in CKD although accurate data on the prevalence of use are lacking. A cross-sectional study was conducted from January to June 2017 in the nephrology outpatient clinic of a medical college hospital in Mangalore, South-West India. Adult patients (>18 years) with CKD (estimated glomerular filtration rate ≤60 mL/min) were considered potentially eligible and approached to participate in the survey. A 17-item semi-structured questionnaire adapted from the National Health Interview Survey Adult CAM Supplement was used for the study. A total of 278 patients (194 males and 84 females) with a mean age of 49.04 ± 12.06 years were included in the study; 67.3% were unemployed and married (83.8%), 35.6% had primary school education, more than 2/3rd of the patients had CKD Stage 5, and 110 patients were on renal replacement therapy with hemodialysis. Comorbidities such as hypertension were present in 46.8%, whereas 36.7% of the patients were diabetic. One hundred and eighty-four patients interviewed (66.3%) reported the use of one or more types of CAM therapy in the previous six months.

It is characterized by the development of multiple cysts in the kidneys and many other extrarenal manifestations. We aimed to determine the factors that contribute to the progression of ADPKD to end-stage renal disease (ESRD). In a retrospective multicentric study, we reviewed the records of 569 patients with ADPKD, hospitalized at a nephrology department or followed up at the outpatient department of university and regional hospitals, covering the north and center of the country, during the period 1969-2016. The mean age of the study patients was 48.54 ± 13.68 years and 14% were young adults (<40 years). There were 272 female and 297 male patients (sex ratio: male/female = 1.09). A family history of ADPKD was found in 43.7% of cases. Renal symptoms were dominated by loin pain, renal failure, hypertension, and hematuria, seen in, respectively, 51.9%, 48.2%, 29.1%, and 24.6% of the patients. The median serum creatinine level was 459 μmol/L (range: 47-2454), and hypertension had preceded the onset of ADPKD in 28.8% of cases. Extrarenal manifestations consisted of urologic complications (54.6%), liver cysts (43.5%), cardiac involvement (31.9%), cerebral aneurysms (12.9%), and gastrointestinal involvement (9.4%). ESRD occurred in 43.1% after a mean follow-up of 47 months (range: 0-384).

Arteriovenous fistula (AVF) is the best type of vascular access due to its decreased rate of complications followed by arteriovenous graft (AVG) and finally, central venous catheters which are associated with increased mortality and morbidity. In this study, we aim to find out the proportion of each vascular access type used in HD patients and to evaluate the epidemiology of HD access in Palestine. Six hundred and fifty-eight patients were enrolled in this study from 10 dialysis units distributed in Palestine. The patients were divided into incident patients or prevalent patients. Data were collected by the researchers by regular visits to the units. AVFs were the most common access type (69.3%), catheters came second (27.8%) finally, AVGs (2.9%). Temporary catheters composed 59% of all catheters, followed by the permanent catheters. The subclavian vein was the most common insertion site (68.3%), internal jugular vein (26.8%), and femoral vein (4.9%). Temporary catheters were most commonly used among incident patients (41.5%) and AVFs were the most common in the prevalent patients (75%). There was no statistically significant association between the type of dialysis access use with gender, body mass index, or diabetic status. We recommend close follow-up and early AVF creation when the patients are expected to need HD. We also highly recommend decreasing the duration of temporary catheters. Finally, further prospective studies to follow-up and evaluate the progression in the vascular access status in Palestine are needed.",Steroid therapy in drug induced acute interstitial nephritis- Retrospective analysis of 83 cases.,https://www.ncbi.nlm.nih.gov/pubmed/30804277,"Saudi journal of kidney diseases and transplantation : an official publication of the Saudi Center for Organ Transplantation, Saudi Arabia",2019 02 26,"Drug-induced acute interstitial nephritis (DIAIN) is a common cause of acute deterioration of renal function. Early diagnosis and discontinuation of the offending drug usually lead to recovery of renal function. Steroid administration further hastens the recovery. However, the outcome of steroid-treated DIAIN is not well studied in the Indian scenario. We aimed to study the clinical profile and one-year renal outcome of DIAIN patients treated with steroids. We performed a retrospective study in biopsy-proven acute interstitial nephritis (AIN) and presumptive DIAIN patients who did not respond to discontinuation of the offending drug after five days of the diagnosis of AIN. Eighty-three DIAIN patients were included who were treated with 500 mg of methylprednisolone for three consecutive days followed by prednisolone of 0.5-1 mg/kg tapered over four to six weeks. We evaluated clinical profile, serum creatinine (SCr), and need of renal replacement therapy at the end of one year. We divided the patients into two groups: 1st as complete responders group (CR) when SCr is <1.5 mg/dL at the end of one year and 2nd as incomplete responders (IR) when it is ≥1.5 mg/dL and evaluated the outcome between two groups. In total, there were 39 (47%) CR and 44 (53%) were IR. Diabetes mellitus, present in a significant number of cases 27 (33%) was associated with poor response to steroids. Most common offending agents recognized were antibiotics (34%), nonsteroidal anti-inflammatory drugs (25%), herbal medications (13%), proton pump inhibitors (10%), and miscellaneous drugs (18%). There was no correlation between drug category and response to steroids. Interstitial fibrosis in renal biopsy was associated with poor response to steroids (4 cases in CR and 35 cases in IR, P ≤0.0001). Neutrophilic predominance in biopsy was associated with favorable response to steroids. Initial SCr and initial the requirement of dialysis support was not helpful in predicting the response to steroids and final recovery.",Management and outcome of latent tuberculosis in living renal transplant donors.,https://www.ncbi.nlm.nih.gov/pubmed/30804276,"Saudi journal of kidney diseases and transplantation : an official publication of the Saudi Center for Organ Transplantation, Saudi Arabia",2019 02 26,"In regions where tuberculosis (TB) is endemic, up to 15% of kidney transplant recipients develop Mycobacterium tuberculosis infections (TBI), typically with an increased risk of disseminated disease and allograft loss.

However, it is unclear whether latent TB in donors justifies routine prophylaxis of recipients. At our institution, donors and recipients with latent infection receive INH prophylaxis, and those who do not have latent infections are not routinely treated. We retrospectively analyzed the records of 269 living donor kidney transplant recipient and donor pairs in order to determine the risk of posttransplant TB in those whose kidneys were obtained from living donors with latent TB. Three recipients (1.1%) developed active TB, three, 11, and 12 months after transplantation. Neither donors nor recipients in these pairs had evidence of latent TB before transplantation. Of the 224 pairs with complete data, 24 transplant recipients with negative tuberculin skin test received organs from living donors with evidence of latent TB. None developed active TB, and kidney function one and three years later was preserved.

In addition to routine laboratory tests and renal ultrasonography (USG), CS levels were measured using pSWE. Carotid intima-media thickness (IMT) and aortic-IMT values were measured. Patients were grouped according to DKD stage (Stage I-II-III-IV-V), then the control group was added and, the six groups were compared within themselves. Renal CS values were found to be significantly higher in all stages of DKD than in the control group and were found to be increased in accordance with the increase in DKD stage (P <0.05). When receiver operating characteristic curve analysis was performed for determining patients with Stage IV-V DKD, it was found that AUC was >70% for parathyroid hormone (PTH), common and internal carotid-IMT, NT-proBNP, cortical thickness, and CS values. It was found that cortical thickness and PTH levels were independently associated with renal CS in DKD patients and independently determined the risk of increased CS (>9.0 kPa) in DKD patients (P <0.05). Renal CS is increased with increasing DKD stage and this is closely related to decreased cortical thickness and serum PTH levels. Renal CS measurement should be used during follow-up of a patient as part of the renal USG.",Tacrolimus as the first-line agent in adult-onset minimal change disease: A randomized controlled study.,https://www.ncbi.nlm.nih.gov/pubmed/30804274,"Saudi journal of kidney diseases and transplantation : an official publication of the Saudi Center for Organ Transplantation, Saudi Arabia",2019 02 26,"Steroids have been the cornerstone of first-line therapy in adult-onset minimal change disease (MCD). The period of exposure to high dose steroids may be longer in adult MCD patients and would result in higher rates of steroid-related side effects. Although tacrolimus (TAC) is known to be effective in steroid-dependent/resistant MCD as well as in nephrotic syndrome due to other causes, there are minimal data available for assessing the effectiveness of TAC as the first-line agent in adult MCD. This is a prospective, open-label, randomized controlled study conducted from April 2014 to March 2016. Patients were randomized into two groups A and B which received TAC for 12 months and oral steroids for six months, respectively. Primary outcomes were remission rates, drug resistance was measured at 6, 12,and 18 months in each group and secondary outcomes were relapse rates, sustained remission rates, dependency, and adverse effects were measured at 18 months in both groups. At six months, total response (TR, i.e., complete and partial remission) was achieved in 80% in the TAC group and 78.26% in the steroid group (P = 1.000). At 12 months, TR was 60% in the TAC group and 43.48% in the steroid group (P = 0.386). At 18 months, TR rate was 44% in the TAC group and 43.48% in the steroid group (P = 1.000). About 32% in the TAC group and 39.13% in steroid group had relapsed by 18 months. Serious adverse effects were similar in the two groups, but overall adverse effects were more in the steroid group. TAC as a primary agent is not inferior to steroids in inducing remission. TAC may be considered as an alternative agent to steroid in high-risk groups such as elderly patients, uncontrolled diabetes and young females as a primary agent in the management of adult MCD.",Study of some pulmonary function tests in Egyptian children with end-stage renal disease under regular hemodialysis in correlation with dialysis duration.,https://www.ncbi.nlm.nih.gov/pubmed/30804273,"Saudi journal of kidney diseases and transplantation : an official publication of the Saudi Center for Organ Transplantation, Saudi Arabia",2019 02 26,"Pulmonary function tests can differentiate between obstructive and restrictive lung diseases and assess the severity of the disease in children. The aim of work was to study pulmonary function tests in children with end-stage renal disease (ESRD) undergoing hemodialysis (HD) and its correlation with dialysis duration. This study was conducted on 40 patients with ESRD on regular HD for at least six months selected from the Pediatric Nephrology unit of Pediatric Department of Tanta university hospital and 40 healthy children as a control group. All participants were subjected to full history taking, thorough clinical examination, laboratory investigation: arterial blood gases and pulmonary function tests, including resting spirometry included measurement of lung volumes. There were significantly lower forced vital capacity (FVC), forced expiratory volume in 1 second (FEV1), FEV1/FVC ratio, peak expiratory flow rate, and forced expiratory flow in patients compared with controls and significant positive correlations between dialysis duration and both of FVC and FEV1 in studied patients. There were restrictive spirometric pattern in 30 patients (75%) with ESRD under regular HD and mixed obstructive and restrictive pattern in 10 patients (25%) with highly significant differences between patients and controls regarding patterns of spirometry. There was impairment of lung function in patients with chronic renal failure undergoing HD predominantly of the restrictive pattern.

The present study was carried out on 50 patients CKD with different etiologies referred to the Internal Medicine Department and Out Patient Clinic of Tanta University Hospitals and 30 apparently healthy individuals of matched age and sex as a control group. They were subjected to the following assessment: detailed history taking, careful clinical examination, and laboratory investigations, including urea, creatinine, estimated glomerular filtration rate (eGFR), serum electrolytes, urinary albumin, urinary phosphorus (U-Ph), and specific laboratory tests for: Alpha Klotho (α-klotho) and FGF-23 by using ELISA technique. The present study shows that the mean value of serum creatinine, urea, phosphorus, urinary albumin, and FGF-23 were significantly increased, whereas there was a significant decrease in the mean value of eGFR, calcium, and U-Ph in the patients with CKD when compared with control group. Plasma level of serum α-klotho is significantly decreased in all patients with CKD when compared to the control group and there was a significant positive correlation between serum α-klotho level and eGFR, serum calcium level and U-Ph level.

After a follow-up period of one year, the outcomes of both the groups were compared in terms of patient survival, graft survival, graft function, incidence of rejections, infective complications, and duration of posttransplant hospital stay. The patient survival in both the groups of patients was 96.67%. The death-censored graft survival was 96.67% in both the groups. The average serum creatinine level, estimated glomerular filtration rate, incidence of rejections, infective episodes, and posttransplant hospital stay were comparable in both the groups. The outcomes of ABOiKT were comparable with ABOcKT and as such, this modality can expand the living donor pool substantially."

However, grafts are typically used to enable a tension-free repair for moderate to large gaps, as excessive tension can cause repairs to fail and catastrophically impede recovery. In this study, we tested the hypothesis that unloading the repair interface by redistributing tension away from the site of repair is a safe and feasible strategy for end-to-end repair of larger nerve gaps. Further, we tested the hypothesis that such an approach does not adversely affect structural and functional regeneration. In this study, we used a rat sciatic nerve injury model to compare the integrity of repair and several regenerative outcomes following end-to-end repairs of nerve gaps of increasing size. In addition, we proposed the use of a novel implantable device to safely repair end-to-end repair of larger nerve gaps by redistributing tension away from the repair interface. Our data suggest that redistriubution of tension away from the site of repair enables safe end-to-end repair of larger gap sizes. In addition, structural and functional measures of regeneration were equal or enhanced in nerves repaired under tension - with or without a tension redistribution device - compared to tension-free repairs. Provided that repair integrity is maintained, end-to-end repairs under tension should be considered as a reasonable surgical strategy. All animal experiments were performed under the approval of the Institutional Animal Care and Use Committee of University of California, San Diego (Protocol S11274).",Effect of exogenous spastin combined with polyethylene glycol on sciatic nerve injury.,https://www.ncbi.nlm.nih.gov/pubmed/30804259,Neural regeneration research,2019 04 17,"Polyethylene glycol can connect the distal and proximal ends of an injured nerve at the cellular level through axonal fusion to avoid Wallerian degeneration of the injured distal nerve and promote peripheral nerve regeneration. However, this method can only prevent Wallerian degeneration in 10% of axons because the cytoskeleton is not repaired in a timely fashion. Reconstruction of the cytoskeletal trunk and microtubule network has been suggested to be the key for improving the efficiency of axonal fusion. As a microtubule-severing protein, spastin has been used to enhance cytoskeletal reconstruction. Therefore, we hypothesized that spastin combined with polyethylene glycol can more effectively promote peripheral nerve regeneration. A total of 120 male Sprague-Dawley rats were randomly divided into sham, suture, polyethylene glycol, and polyethylene glycol + spastin groups. In suture group rats, only traditional nerve anastomosis of the end-to-end suture was performed after transection of the sciatic nerve. In polyethylene glycol and polyethylene glycol + spastin groups, 50 μL of polyethylene glycol or 25 μL of polyethylene glycol + 25 μL of spastin, respectively, were injected immediately under the epineurium of the distal suture. Sensory fiber regeneration distance, which was used to assess early nerve regeneration at 1 week after surgery, was shortest in the suture group, followed by polyethylene glycol group and greatest in the polyethylene glycol + spastin group. Behavioral assessment of motor function recovery in rats showed that limb function was restored in polyethylene glycol and polyethylene glycol + spastin groups at 8 weeks after surgery. At 1, 2, 4 and 8 weeks after surgery, sciatic functional index values and percentages of gastrocnemius muscle wet weight were highest in the sham group, followed by polyethylene glycol + spastin and polyethylene glycol groups, and lowest in the suture group. Masson staining was utilized to assess the morphology of muscle tissue. Morphological changes in skeletal muscle were detectable in suture, polyethylene glycol, and polyethylene glycol + spastin groups at 1, 2, 4, and 8 weeks after surgery. Among them, muscular atrophy of the suture group was most serious, followed by polyethylene glycol and polyethylene glycol + spastin groups. Ultrastructure of distal sciatic nerve tissue, as detected by transmission electron microscopy, showed a pattern of initial destruction, subsequent disintegration, and gradual repair in suture, polyethylene glycol, and polyethylene glycol + spastin groups at 1, 2, 4, and 8 weeks after surgery. As time proceeded, axonal ultrastructure gradually recovered. Indeed, the polyethylene glycol + spastin group was similar to the sham group at 8 weeks after surgery. Our findings indicate that the combination of polyethylene glycol and spastin can promote peripheral nerve regeneration. Moreover, the effect of this combination was better than that of polyethylene glycol alone, and both were superior to the traditional neurorrhaphy.

Microarray analysis provides a new opportunity for investigating diagnosis, treatment, and prognosis of spinal cord injury. However, differentially expressed genes are not consistent among studies, and many key genes and signaling pathways have not yet been accurately studied. GSE5296 was retrieved from the Gene Expression Omnibus DataSet. Differentially expressed genes were obtained using R/Bioconductor software (expression changed at least two-fold; P < 0.05). Database for Annotation, Visualization and Integrated Discovery was used for functional annotation of differentially expressed genes and Animal Transcription Factor Database for predicting potential transcription factors. The resulting transcription regulatory protein interaction network was mapped to screen representative genes and investigate their diagnostic and therapeutic value for disease. In total, this study identified 109 genes that were upregulated and 30 that were downregulated at 0.5, 4, and 24 hours, and 3, 7, and 28 days after spinal cord injury. The number of downregulated genes was smaller than the number of upregulated genes at each time point. Database for Annotation, Visualization and Integrated Discovery analysis found that many inflammation-related pathways were upregulated in injured spinal cord. Additionally, expression levels of these inflammation-related genes were maintained for at least 28 days. Moreover, 399 regulation modes and 77 nodes were shown in the protein-protein interaction network of upregulated differentially expressed genes. Among the 10 upregulated differentially expressed genes with the highest degrees of distribution, six genes were transcription factors. Among these transcription factors, ATF3 showed the greatest change. ATF3 was upregulated within 30 minutes, and its expression levels remained high at 28 days after spinal cord injury. These key genes screened by bioinformatics tools can be used as biological markers to diagnose diseases and provide a reference for identifying therapeutic targets.",Use of ebselen as a neuroprotective agent in rat spinal cord subjected to traumatic injury.,https://www.ncbi.nlm.nih.gov/pubmed/30804257,Neural regeneration research,2019 04 17,"Spinal cord injury (SCI) causes disturbances of motor skills. Free radicals have been shown to be essential for the development of spinal cord trauma. Despite some progress, until now no effective pharmacological therapies against SCI have been verified. The purpose of our experiment was to investigate the neuroprotective effects of ebselen on experimental SCI. Twenty-two rats subjected to SCI were randomly subjected to SCI with no further treatment (n = 10) or intragastric administration of ebselen (10 mg/kg) immediately and 24 hours after SCI. Behavioral changes were assessed using the Basso, Beattie, and Bresnahan locomotor scale and footprint test during 12 weeks after SCI. Histopathological and immunohistochemical analyses of spinal cords and brains were performed at 12 weeks after SCI. Magnetic resonance imaging analysis of spinal cords was also performed at 12 weeks after SCI. Rats treated with ebselen presented only limited neurobehavioral progress as well as reduced spinal cord injuries compared with the control group, namely length of lesions (cysts/scars) visualized histopathologically in the spinal cord sections was less but cavity area was very similar. The same pattern was found in T2-weighted magnetic resonance images (cavities) and diffusion-weighted images (scars). The number of FluoroGold retrogradely labeled neurons in brain stem and motor cortex was several-fold higher in ebselen-treated rats than in the control group. The findings suggest that ebselen has only limited neuroprotective effects on injured spinal cord. All exprimental procedures were approved by the Local Animal Ethics Committee for Experiments on Animals in Katowice (Katowice, Poland) (approval No. 19/2009).","A high methionine, low folate and vitamin B6/B12 containing diet can be associated with memory loss by epigenetic silencing of netrin-1.",https://www.ncbi.nlm.nih.gov/pubmed/30804256,Neural regeneration research,2019 04 17,"Memory-epigenetics which is the loss of memory due to epigenetic modifications can be due to the silencing of genes involved in cognitive functions and this is the basis of the current study. We hypothesize that a diet containing high methionine and low vitamins can lead to memory impairment by increasing global DNA methylation and therefore, silencing the netrin-1 gene, which encodes the glycoprotein involved in neurogenesis, axonal guidance and maintenance of the synaptic plasticity. Wild type (C57BL/6J) mice were fed with a diet containing excess methionine (1.2%), low-folate (0.08 mg/kg), vitamin B6 (0.01 mg/kg), and B12 (10.4 mg/kg) for 6 weeks. Mice were examined weekly for the long-term memory function, using a passive avoidance test, which determined loss of fear-motivated long-term memory starting from the fourth week of diet. Similarly, an increase in brain %5-methyl cytosine was observed starting from the 4th week of diet in mice. Mice fed with a high methionine, low folate and vitamins containing diet showed a decrease in netrin-1 protein expression and an increase in netrin-1 gene promotor methylation, as determined by methylation-sensitive restriction enzyme-polymerase chain reaction analysis. The increase in methylation of netrin-1 gene was validated by high-resolution melting and sequencing analysis. Furthermore, the association of netrin-1 with memory was established by administering netrin that considerably restored long-term fear motivated memory. Taken together, these results suggest that a diet rich in methionine and lacking in folate and vitamin B6/B12 can induce defects in learning and memory. Furthermore, the data indicates that decrease in netrin-1 expression due to hyper-methylation of its gene can be associated with memory loss.

In this framework, electrophysiological factors are promising since are more directly related to neuroplasticity, which supports recovery in stroke patients, than neurovascular factors. In this retrospective observational study, we investigated brain neuronal activity assessed via spectral features and Higuchi's fractal dimension (HFD) of electroencephalographic signals in acute phase (2-10 days from symptom onset, T0) and sub-acute phase (2.5 months, T1) in 24 patients affected by unilateral middle cerebral artery stroke. Longitudinal assessment of the clinical deficits was performed using the National Institutes of Health Stroke Scale (NIHSS), together with the effective recovery calculated as the ratio between difference of NIHSS at T0 and T1 over the NIHSS value at T0. We observed that delta and alpha band electroencephalographic signal power changed between the two phases in both the hemispheres ipsilateral (ILH) and contralateral (CHL) to the lesion. Moreover, at T0, bilateral higher delta band power correlated with worse clinical conditions (Spearman's rs = 0.460, P = 0.027 for ILH and rs = 0.508, P = 0.013 for CLH), whereas at T1 this occurred only for delta power in ILH (rs = 0.411, P = 0.046) and not for CHL. Inter-hemispheric difference (ILH vs. CLH) of alpha power in patients was lower at T0 than at T1 (P = 0.020). HFD at T0 was lower than at T1 (P = 0.005), and at both phases, ILH HFD was lower than CLH HFD (P = 0.020). These data suggest that inter-hemispheric low band asymmetry and fractal dimension changes from the acute to the sub-acute phase are sensitive to neuroplasticity processes which subtend clinical recovery.

This study aimed to investigate the effects of early treadmill exercise on recovery from ischemic stroke and to determine whether these effects are associated with the expression levels of MIF and brain-derived neurotrophic factor (BDNF) in the ischemic area. A total of 40 male Sprague-Dawley rats were randomly assigned to the ischemia and exercise group [middle cerebral artery occlusion (MCAO)-Ex, n = 10), ischemia and sedentary group (MCAO-St, n = 10), sham-surgery and exercise group (Sham-Ex, n = 10), or sham-surgery and sedentary group (Sham-St, n = 10). The MCAO-Ex and MCAO-St groups were subjected to MCAO for 60 minutes, whereas the Sham-Ex and Sham-St groups were subjected to an identical operation without MCAO. Rats in the MCAO-Ex and Sham-Ex groups then ran on a treadmill for 30 minutes once a day for 5 consecutive days. After reperfusion, the hanging time tested by the wire hang test was longer and the relative fractional anisotropy determined by MRI was higher in the peri-infarct region of the MCAO-Ex group compared with the MCAO-St group. The expression levels of MIF and BDNF in the peri-infarct region were upregulated in the MCAO-Ex group. Increased MIF and BDNF levels were positively correlated with relative fractional anisotropy changes in the peri-infarct region. There was no significant difference in the levels of MIF and BDNF in the peri-infarct region between the Sham-Ex and Sham-St groups. Our study demonstrated that early exercise (initiated 48 hours after the MCAO) could improve motor and neuronal recovery after ischemic stroke. Furthermore, the increased levels of MIF and BDNF in the peri-infarct region (penumbra) may be one of the mechanisms of enhanced neurological function recovery. All experiments were approved by the Institutional Animal Care and Use Committee in Asan Medical Center in South Korea (2016-12-126).",GPER agonist G1 suppresses neuronal apoptosis mediated by endoplasmic reticulum stress after cerebral ischemia/reperfusion injury.,https://www.ncbi.nlm.nih.gov/pubmed/30804253,Neural regeneration research,2019 04 17,"Studies have confirmed a strong association between activation of the endoplasmic reticulum stress pathway and cerebral ischemia/reperfusion (I/R) injury. In this study, three key proteins in the endoplasmic reticulum stress pathway (glucose-regulated protein 78, caspase-12, and C/EBP homologous protein) were selected to examine the potential mechanism of endoplasmic reticulum stress in the neuroprotective effect of G protein-coupled estrogen receptor. Female Sprague-Dawley rats received ovariectomy (OVX), and then cerebral I/R rat models (OVX + I/R) were established by middle cerebral artery occlusion. Immediately after I/R, rat models were injected with 100 μg/kg E2 (OVX + I/R + E2), or 100 μg/kg G protein-coupled estrogen receptor agonist G1 (OVX + I/R + G1) in the lateral ventricle. Longa scoring was used to detect neurobehavioral changes in each group. Infarct volumes were measured by 2,3,5-triphenyltetrazolium chloride staining. Morphological changes in neurons were observed by Nissl staining. Terminal dexynucleotidyl transferase-mediated nick end-labeling staining revealed that compared with the OVX + I/R group, neurological function was remarkably improved, infarct volume was reduced, number of normal Nissl bodies was dramatically increased, and number of apoptotic neurons in the hippocampus was decreased after E2 and G1 intervention. To detect the expression and distribution of endoplasmic reticulum stress-related proteins in the endoplasmic reticulum, caspase-12 distribution and expression were detected by immunofluorescence, and mRNA and protein levels of glucose-regulated protein 78, caspase-12, and C/EBP homologous protein were determined by polymerase chain reaction and western blot assay. The results showed that compared with the OVX + I/R group, E2 and G1 treatment obviously decreased mRNA and protein expression levels of glucose-regulated protein 78, C/EBP homologous protein, and caspase-12. However, the G protein-coupled estrogen receptor antagonist G15 (OVX + I/R + E2 + G15) could eliminate the effect of E2 on cerebral I/R injury. These results confirm that E2 and G protein-coupled estrogen receptor can inhibit the expression of endoplasmic reticulum stress-related proteins and neuronal apoptosis in the hippocampus, thereby improving dysfunction caused by cerebral I/R injury.

In this review, studies that have demonstrated brain changes during recovery of impaired consciousness were reviewed. These studies used positron emission tomography, electroencephalography/transcranial magnetic stimulation, diffusion tensor tractography, and diffusion tensor tractography/electroencephalography. The majority of these studies reported on the importance of supratentorial areas or structures in the recovery of impaired consciousness. The important brain areas or structures that were identified were the prefrontal cortex, basal forebrain, anterior cingulate cortex, and parietal cortex. These results have a clinically important implication that these brain areas or structures can be target areas for neurorehabilitation or neurointervention in patients with disorders of consciousness. However, most of studies were case reports; therefore, further original studies involving larger numbers of patients with disorders of consciousness are warranted. In addition, more detailed information on the brain areas or structures that are relevant to the recovery of impaired consciousness is needed.",Toll-like receptor 4 and protease-activated receptor 2 in physiology and pathophysiology of the nervous system: more than just receptor cooperation?,https://www.ncbi.nlm.nih.gov/pubmed/30804245,Neural regeneration research,2019 04 17,"Toll-like receptor 4 (TLR4) and protease-activated receptor 2 (PAR2) play pivotal roles in the mammalian innate immune response. Notably, in addition to their involvement in detection of invading pathogens, PAR2 and TLR4 modulate the levels of cell death-induced sterile inflammation by activating pro- or anti-inflammatory downstream signaling cascades. Within the central nervous system, there is emerging evidence that both receptors are involved in synaptic transmission and brain plasticity. Furthermore, due to their prominent role in mediating neuroinflammation, PAR2 and TLR4 are associated with development and progression of neurodegenerative disorders including but not limited to Alzheimer's disease, Parkinson's disease and multiple sclerosis. In this article, we summarise the current knowledge on the cooperation between PAR2 and TLR4, discuss the potential cross-talk levels and highlight the impact of the cross-coupling on neuroinflammation."

ICH can be divided into two pathophysiological stages: an acute primary phase, including hematoma volume expansion, and a subacute secondary phase consisting of blood-brain barrier disruption and perihematomal edema expansion. To date, all major trials for ICH have targeted the primary phase with therapies designed to reduce hematoma expansion through blood pressure control, surgical evacuation, and hemostasis. However, none of these trials has resulted in improved clinical outcomes. Magnesium is a ubiquitous element that also plays roles in vasodilation, hemostasis, and blood-brain barrier preservation. Animal models have highlighted potential therapeutic roles for magnesium in neurological diseases specifically targeting these pathophysiological mechanisms. Retrospective studies have also demonstrated inverse associations between admission magnesium levels and hematoma volume, hematoma expansion, and clinical outcome in patients with ICH. These associations, coupled with the multifactorial role of magnesium that targets both primary and secondary phases of ICH, suggest that magnesium may be a viable target of study in future ICH studies.",Bridging larger gaps in peripheral nerves using neural prosthetics and physical therapeutic agents.,https://www.ncbi.nlm.nih.gov/pubmed/30804232,Neural regeneration research,2019 04 17,"Peripheral nerve injuries are relatively common and can be caused by a variety of traumatic events such as motor vehicle accidents. They can lead to long-term disability, pain, and financial burden, and contribute to poor quality of life. In this review, we systematically analyze the contemporary literature on peripheral nerve gap management using nerve prostheses in conjunction with physical therapeutic agents. The use of nerve prostheses to assist nerve regeneration across large gaps (> 30 mm) has revolutionized neural surgery. The materials used for nerve prostheses have been greatly refined, making them suitable for repairing large nerve gaps. However, research on peripheral nerve gap management using nerve prostheses reports inconsistent functional outcomes, especially when prostheses are integrated with physical therapeutic agents, and thus warrants careful investigation. This review explores the effectiveness of nerve prostheses for bridging large nerve gaps and then addresses their use in combination with physical therapeutic agents.","Fructose 1,6-bisphosphatase: getting the message across.",https://www.ncbi.nlm.nih.gov/pubmed/30804231,Bioscience reports,2019 03 10,"Fructose 1,6-bisphosphatase (FBPase) is a key enzyme in gluconeogenesis.

Thus, there is interest in both inhibiting the enzyme (for diabetes treatment) and restoring its activity (in relevant cancers). The mammalian enzyme is tetrameric, competitively inhibited by Fructose 2,6-bisphosphate and negatively allosterically regulated by AMP. This allosteric regulation requires information transmission between the AMP binding site and the active site of the enzyme. A recent paper by Topaz et al. (Bioscience Reports (2019) 39, pii:BSR20180960) has added additional detail to our understanding of this information transmission process. Two residues in the AMP binding site (Lys112 and Tyr113) were shown to be involved in initiating the message between the two sites. This tyrosine residue has recently be shown to be important with protein's interaction with the antidiabetic drug metformin. A variant designed to increase metal ion affinity (M248D) resulted in a five-fold increase in enzymatic activity. Interestingly alterations of two residues at the subunit interfaces (Tyr164 and Met177) resulted in increased responsiveness to AMP. Overall, these findings may have implications in the design of novel FBPase inhibitors or activators.",Microstructure changes in whiter matter relate to cognitive impairment in Wilson's disease.,https://www.ncbi.nlm.nih.gov/pubmed/30804230,Bioscience reports,2019 03 29,"Purpose: Wilson's disease (WD) is a genetic disorder of copper metabolism with pathological copper accumulation in the brain. The purpose of the present study was to evaluate the relationship between the damaged white matter and the impaired cognitive function in WD patients. Materials and methods: Thirty WD adolescents and thirty age- and sex-matched healthy controls (HC) were enrolled. All subjects had received brain MRI, including conventional and diffusion-tensor imaging (DTI) scans. The DTI parameter of fractional anisotropy (FA) was calculated by diffusion kurtosis estimator software. The t test was used to compare the differences between two groups. The correlation between cognitive function and whiter matter disorders were analyzed by linear regression. The results of FA parameter and MD parameter intergroup analysis were both corrected with False Discovery Rate (FDR) simulations by SPSS. Results: WD adolescents showed significantly lower scores of time-based prospective memory (TBPM) and verbal fluency test (VFT) compared with HC. We found significantly higher FA in the right thalamus, right lentiform nucleus, left thalamus, left lentiform nucleus, and brain stem in WD adolescents. Besides, WD adolescents exhibited significantly lower FA in right cerebellum and cingulum and left middle frontal lobe compared with controls (P<0.05). There were significantly negative correlations between FA in bilateral lentiform and thalamus and cognitive impairment in WD adolescents (P<0.05). Conclusion: The whiter matter of WD adolescents was impaired and mainly distributed in subcortical brain regions. The impaired cognitive function was affected by the damaged whiter matter. The present study may be helpful for recognition and understanding of WD.",miR-206 inhibits osteogenic differentiation of bone marrow mesenchymal stem cells by targetting glutaminase.,https://www.ncbi.nlm.nih.gov/pubmed/30804229,Bioscience reports,2019 03 27,"Osteoblast-mediated bone formation is a complex process involving various pathways and regulatory factors, including cytokines, growth factors, and hormones. Investigating the regulatory mechanisms behind osteoblast differentiation is important for bone regeneration therapy. miRNAs are known as important regulators, not only in a variety of cellular processes, but also in the pathogenesis of bone diseases. In the present study, we investigated the potential roles of miR-206 during osteoblast differentiation. We report that miR-206 expression was significantly down-regulated in human bone marrow mesenchymal stem cells (BMSCs) at days 7 and 14 during osteogenic induction. Furthermore, miR-206 overexpressing BMSCs showed attenuated alkaline phosphatase (ALP) activity, Alizarin Red staining, and osteocalcin secretion. The mRNA levels of osteogenic markers, Runx2 and Osteopontin (OPN), were significantly down-regulated in miR-206 overexpressing BMSCs. We observed that significantly increased glutamine uptake at days 7 and 14 during the osteogenic induction and inhibition of glutamine metabolism by knocking down glutaminase (GLS)-suppressed osteogenic differentiation of BMSCs. Here, we discover that miR-206 could directly bind to the 3'-UTR region of GLS mRNA, resulting in suppressed GLS expression and glutamine metabolism. Finally, restoration of GLS in miR-206 overexpressing BMSCs led to recovery of glutamine metabolism and osteogenic differentiation. In summary, these results reveal a new insight into the mechanisms of the miR-206-mediated osteogenesis through regulating glutamine metabolism. Our study may contribute to the development of therapeutic agents against bone diseases.",Synergistic lethality between BRCA1 and H3K9me2 loss reflects satellite derepression.,https://www.ncbi.nlm.nih.gov/pubmed/30804228,Genes & development,2019 04 22,"Caenorhabditis elegans has two histone H3 Lys9 methyltransferases, MET-2 (SETDB1 homolog) and SET-25 (G9a/SUV39H1 related). In worms, we found simple repeat sequences primarily marked by H3K9me2, while transposable elements and silent tissue-specific genes bear H3K9me3. RNA sequencing (RNA-seq) in histone methyltransferase (HMT) mutants shows that MET-2-mediated H3K9me2 is necessary for satellite repeat repression, while SET-25 silences a subset of transposable elements and tissue-specific genes through H3K9me3. A genome-wide synthetic lethality screen showed that RNA processing, nuclear RNA degradation, the BRCA1/BARD1 complex, and factors mediating replication stress survival are necessary for germline viability in worms lacking MET-2 but not SET-25. Unlike set-25 mutants, met-2-null worms accumulated satellite repeat transcripts, which form RNA:DNA hybrids on repetitive sequences, additively with the loss of BRCA1 or BARD1. BRCA1/BARD1-mediated H2A ubiquitination and MET-2 deposited H3K9me2 on satellite repeats are partially interdependent, suggesting both that the loss of silencing generates BRCA-recruiting DNA damage and that BRCA1 recruitment by damage helps silence repeats. The artificial induction of MSAT1 transcripts can itself trigger damage-induced germline lethality in a wild-type background, arguing that the synthetic sterility upon BRCA1/BARD1 and H3K9me2 loss is directly linked to the DNA damage provoked by unscheduled satellite repeat transcription.",Sfp1 regulates transcriptional networks driving cell growth and division through multiple promoter-binding modes.,https://www.ncbi.nlm.nih.gov/pubmed/30804227,Genes & development,2019 03 29,"The yeast Sfp1 protein regulates both cell division and growth but how it coordinates these processes is poorly understood. We demonstrate that Sfp1 directly controls genes required for ribosome production and many other growth-promoting processes. Remarkably, the complete set of Sfp1 target genes is revealed only by a combination of ChIP (chromatin immunoprecipitation) and ChEC (chromatin endogenous cleavage) methods, which uncover two promoter binding modes, one requiring a cofactor and the other a DNA-recognition motif. Glucose-regulated Sfp1 binding at cell cycle ""START"" genes suggests that Sfp1 controls cell size by coordinating expression of genes implicated in mass accumulation and cell division.","Resolution of human ribosomal DNA occurs in anaphase, dependent on tankyrase 1, condensin II, and topoisomerase IIα.",https://www.ncbi.nlm.nih.gov/pubmed/30804226,Genes & development,2019 03 29,"Formation of individualized sister chromatids is essential for their accurate segregation. In budding yeast, while most of the genome segregates at the metaphase to anaphase transition, resolution of the ribosomal DNA (rDNA) repeats is delayed. The timing and mechanism in human cells is unknown. Here we show that resolution of human rDNA occurs in anaphase after the bulk of the genome, dependent on tankyrase 1, condensin II, and topoisomerase IIα. Defective resolution leads to rDNA bridges, rDNA damage, and aneuploidy of an rDNA-containing acrocentric chromosome. Thus, temporal regulation of rDNA segregation is conserved between yeast and man and is essential for genome integrity.",Tissue-specific BMAL1 cistromes reveal that rhythmic transcription is associated with rhythmic enhancer-enhancer interactions.,https://www.ncbi.nlm.nih.gov/pubmed/30804225,Genes & development,2019 03 29,"The mammalian circadian clock relies on the transcription factor CLOCK:BMAL1 to coordinate the rhythmic expression of thousands of genes. Consistent with the various biological functions under clock control, rhythmic gene expression is tissue-specific despite an identical clockwork mechanism in every cell. Here we show that BMAL1 DNA binding is largely tissue-specific, likely because of differences in chromatin accessibility between tissues and cobinding of tissue-specific transcription factors. Our results also indicate that BMAL1 ability to drive tissue-specific rhythmic transcription is associated with not only the activity of BMAL1-bound enhancers but also the activity of neighboring enhancers. Characterization of physical interactions between BMAL1 enhancers and other cis-regulatory regions by RNA polymerase II chromatin interaction analysis by paired-end tag (ChIA-PET) reveals that rhythmic BMAL1 target gene expression correlates with rhythmic chromatin interactions. These data thus support that much of BMAL1 target gene transcription depends on BMAL1 capacity to rhythmically regulate a network of enhancers.","BRN2 suppresses apoptosis, reprograms DNA damage repair, and is associated with a high somatic mutation burden in melanoma.",https://www.ncbi.nlm.nih.gov/pubmed/30804224,Genes & development,2019 03 29,"Whether cell types exposed to a high level of environmental insults possess cell type-specific prosurvival mechanisms or enhanced DNA damage repair capacity is not well understood. BRN2 is a tissue-restricted POU domain transcription factor implicated in neural development and several cancers. In melanoma, BRN2 plays a key role in promoting invasion and regulating proliferation. Here we found, surprisingly, that rather than interacting with transcription cofactors, BRN2 is instead associated with DNA damage response proteins and directly binds PARP1 and Ku70/Ku80. Rapid PARP1-dependent BRN2 association with sites of DNA damage facilitates recruitment of Ku80 and reprograms DNA damage repair by promoting Ku-dependent nonhomologous end-joining (NHEJ) at the expense of homologous recombination. BRN2 also suppresses an apoptosis-associated gene expression program to protect against UVB-, chemotherapy- and vemurafenib-induced apoptosis. Remarkably, BRN2 expression also correlates with a high single-nucleotide variation prevalence in human melanomas. By promoting error-prone DNA damage repair via NHEJ and suppressing apoptosis of damaged cells, our results suggest that BRN2 contributes to the generation of melanomas with a high mutation burden. Our findings highlight a novel role for a key transcription factor in reprogramming DNA damage repair and suggest that BRN2 may impact the response to DNA-damaging agents in BRN2-expressing cancers."

Polo-like kinase 4 (PLK4) is a Ser/Thr protein kinase and the master regulator of centriole duplication, but it may play additional roles in centrosome function. To identify additional proteins regulated by PLK4, we generated an RPE-1 human cell line with a genetically engineered ""analog-sensitive"" PLK4AS, which genetically encodes chemical sensitivity to competitive inhibition via a bulky ATP analog. We used this transgenic line in an unbiased multiplex phosphoproteomic screen. Several hits were identified and validated as direct PLK4 substrates by in vitro kinase assays. Among them, we confirmed Ser-78 in centrosomal protein 131 (CEP131, also known as AZI1) as a direct substrate of PLK4. Using immunofluorescence microscopy, we observed that although PLK4-mediated phosphorylation of Ser-78 is dispensable for CEP131 localization, ciliogenesis, and centriole duplication, it is essential for maintaining the integrity of centriolar satellites. We also found that PLK4 inhibition or use of a nonphosphorylatable CEP131 variant results in dispersed centriolar satellites. Moreover, replacement of endogenous WT CEP131 with an S78D phosphomimetic variant promoted aggregation of centriolar satellites. We conclude that PLK4 phosphorylates CEP131 at Ser-78 to maintain centriolar satellite integrity.",Self-organized dynamics and the transition to turbulence of confined active nematics.,https://www.ncbi.nlm.nih.gov/pubmed/30804207,Proceedings of the National Academy of Sciences of the United States of America,2019 06 13,"We study how confinement transforms the chaotic dynamics of bulk microtubule-based active nematics into regular spatiotemporal patterns. For weak confinements in disks, multiple continuously nucleating and annihilating topological defects self-organize into persistent circular flows of either handedness. Increasing confinement strength leads to the emergence of distinct dynamics, in which the slow periodic nucleation of topological defects at the boundary is superimposed onto a fast procession of a pair of defects. A defect pair migrates toward the confinement core over multiple rotation cycles, while the associated nematic director field evolves from a distinct double spiral toward a nearly circularly symmetric configuration. The collapse of the defect orbits is punctuated by another boundary-localized nucleation event, that sets up long-term doubly periodic dynamics. Comparing experimental data to a theoretical model of an active nematic reveals that theory captures the fast procession of a pair of [Formula: see text] defects, but not the slow spiral transformation nor the periodic nucleation of defect pairs. Theory also fails to predict the emergence of circular flows in the weak confinement regime. The developed confinement methods are generalized to more complex geometries, providing a robust microfluidic platform for rationally engineering 2D autonomous flows.",Inhibition of soluble epoxide hydrolase attenuates a high-fat diet-mediated renal injury by activating PAX2 and AMPK.,https://www.ncbi.nlm.nih.gov/pubmed/30804206,Proceedings of the National Academy of Sciences of the United States of America,2019 06 13,"A high-fat diet (HFD) causes obesity-associated morbidities involved in macroautophagy and chaperone-mediated autophagy (CMA). AMPK, the mediator of macroautophage, has been reported to be inactivated in HFD-caused renal injury. However, PAX2, the mediator for CMA, has not been reported in HFD-caused renal injury. Here we report that HFD-caused renal injury involved the inactivation of Pax2 and Ampk, and the activation of soluble epoxide hydrolase (sEH), in a murine model. Specifically, mice fed on an HFD for 2, 4, and 8 wk showed time-dependent renal injury, the significant decrease in renal Pax2 and Ampk at both mRNA and protein levels, and a significant increase in renal sEH at mRNA, protein, and molecular levels. Also, administration of an sEH inhibitor, 1-trifluoromethoxyphenyl-3-(1-propionylpiperidin-4-yl)urea, significantly attenuated the HFD-caused renal injury, decreased renal sEH consistently at mRNA and protein levels, modified the renal levels of sEH-mediated epoxyeicosatrienoic acids (EETs) and dihydroxyeicosatrienoic acids (DHETs) as expected, and increased renal Pax2 and Ampk at mRNA and/or protein levels. Furthermore, palmitic acid (PA) treatment caused significant increase in Mcp-1, and decrease in both Pax2 and Ampk in murine renal mesangial cells (mRMCs) time- and dose-dependently. Also, 14(15)-EET (a major substrate of sEH), but not its sEH-mediated metabolite 14,15-DHET, significantly reversed PA-induced increase in Mcp-1, and PA-induced decrease in Pax2 and Ampk. In addition, plasmid construction revealed that Pax2 may positively regulate Ampk transcriptionally in mRMCs. This study provides insights into and therapeutic target for the HFD-mediated renal injury.",α-Difluoromethylornithine reduces gastric carcinogenesis by causing mutations in Helicobacter pylori cagY.,https://www.ncbi.nlm.nih.gov/pubmed/30804204,Proceedings of the National Academy of Sciences of the United States of America,2019 06 13,"Infection by Helicobacter pylori is the primary cause of gastric adenocarcinoma. The most potent H. pylori virulence factor is cytotoxin-associated gene A (CagA), which is translocated by a type 4 secretion system (T4SS) into gastric epithelial cells and activates oncogenic signaling pathways. The gene cagY encodes for a key component of the T4SS and can undergo gene rearrangements. We have shown that the cancer chemopreventive agent α-difluoromethylornithine (DFMO), known to inhibit the enzyme ornithine decarboxylase, reduces H. pylori-mediated gastric cancer incidence in Mongolian gerbils. In the present study, we questioned whether DFMO might directly affect H. pylori pathogenicity. We show that H. pylori output strains isolated from gerbils treated with DFMO exhibit reduced ability to translocate CagA in gastric epithelial cells. Further, we frequently detected genomic modifications in the middle repeat region of the cagY gene of output strains from DFMO-treated animals, which were associated with alterations in the CagY protein. Gerbils did not develop carcinoma when infected with a DFMO output strain containing rearranged cagY or the parental strain in which the wild-type cagY was replaced by cagY with DFMO-induced rearrangements. Lastly, we demonstrate that in vitro treatment of H. pylori by DFMO induces oxidative DNA damage, expression of the DNA repair enzyme MutS2, and mutations in cagY, demonstrating that DFMO directly affects genomic stability. Deletion of mutS2 abrogated the ability of DFMO to induce cagY rearrangements directly. In conclusion, DFMO-induced oxidative stress in H. pylori leads to genomic alterations and attenuates virulence.",Central role of G protein Gαi2 and Gαi2+ vomeronasal neurons in balancing territorial and infant-directed aggression of male mice.,https://www.ncbi.nlm.nih.gov/pubmed/30804203,Proceedings of the National Academy of Sciences of the United States of America,2019 06 13,"Aggression is controlled by the olfactory system in many animal species. In male mice, territorial and infant-directed aggression are tightly regulated by the vomeronasal organ (VNO), but how diverse subsets of sensory neurons convey pheromonal information to limbic centers is not yet known. Here, we employ genetic strategies to show that mouse vomeronasal sensory neurons expressing the G protein subunit Gαi2 regulate male-male and infant-directed aggression through distinct circuit mechanisms. Conditional ablation of Gαi2 enhances male-male aggression and increases neural activity in the medial amygdala (MeA), bed nucleus of the stria terminalis, and lateral septum. By contrast, conditional Gαi2 ablation causes reduced infant-directed aggression and decreased activity in MeA neurons during male-infant interactions. Strikingly, these mice also display enhanced parental behavior and elevated neural activity in the medial preoptic area, whereas sexual behavior remains normal. These results identify Gαi2 as the primary G protein α-subunit mediating the detection of volatile chemosignals in the apical layer of the VNO, and they show that Gαi2+ VSNs and the brain circuits activated by these neurons play a central role in orchestrating and balancing territorial and infant-directed aggression of male mice through bidirectional activation and inhibition of different targets in the limbic system.",Complex modifier landscape underlying genetic background effects.,https://www.ncbi.nlm.nih.gov/pubmed/30804202,Proceedings of the National Academy of Sciences of the United States of America,2019 05 06,"The phenotypic consequence of a given mutation can be influenced by the genetic background. For example, conditional gene essentiality occurs when the loss of function of a gene causes lethality in one genetic background but not another. Between two individual Saccharomyces cerevisiae strains, S288c and Σ1278b, ∼1% of yeast genes were previously identified as ""conditional essential."" Here, in addition to confirming that some conditional essential genes are modified by a nonchromosomal element, we show that most cases involve a complex set of genomic modifiers. From tetrad analysis of S288C/Σ1278b hybrid strains and whole-genome sequencing of viable hybrid spore progeny, we identified complex sets of multiple genomic regions underlying conditional essentiality. For a smaller subset of genes, including CYS3 and CYS4, each of which encodes components of the cysteine biosynthesis pathway, we observed a segregation pattern consistent with a single modifier associated with conditional essentiality. In natural yeast isolates, we found that the CYS3/CYS4 conditional essentiality can be caused by variation in two independent modifiers, MET1 and OPT1, each with roles associated with cellular cysteine physiology. Interestingly, the OPT1 allelic variation appears to have arisen independently from separate lineages, with rare allele frequencies below 0.5%. Thus, while conditional gene essentiality is usually driven by genetic interactions associated with complex modifier architectures, our analysis also highlights the role of functionally related, genetically independent, and rare variants.",Recovery from tachyphylaxis of TRPV1 coincides with recycling to the surface membrane.,https://www.ncbi.nlm.nih.gov/pubmed/30804201,Proceedings of the National Academy of Sciences of the United States of America,2019 06 13,"The transient receptor potential vanilloid-1 (TRPV1) ion channel is essential for sensation of thermal and chemical pain. TRPV1 activation is accompanied by Ca2+-dependent desensitization; acute desensitization reflects rapid reduction in channel activity during stimulation, whereas tachyphylaxis denotes the diminution in TRPV1 responses to repetitive stimulation. Acute desensitization has been attributed to conformational changes of the TRPV1 channel; however, the mechanisms underlying the establishment of tachyphylaxis remain to be defined. Here, we report that the degree of whole-cell TRPV1 tachyphylaxis is regulated by the strength of inducing stimulation. Using light-sheet microscopy and pH-sensitive sensor pHluorin to follow TRPV1 endocytosis and exocytosis trafficking, we provide real-time information that tachyphylaxis of different degrees concurs with TRPV1 recycling to the plasma membrane in a proportional manner. This process controls TRPV1 surface expression level thereby the whole-cell nociceptive response. We further show that activity-gated TRPV1 trafficking associates with intracellular Ca2+ signals of distinct kinetics, and recruits recycling routes mediated by synaptotagmin 1 and 7, respectively. These results suggest that activity-dependent TRPV1 recycling contributes to the establishment of tachyphylaxis.",Glial ensheathment of the somatodendritic compartment regulates sensory neuron structure and activity.,https://www.ncbi.nlm.nih.gov/pubmed/30804200,Proceedings of the National Academy of Sciences of the United States of America,2019 06 13,"Sensory neurons perceive environmental cues and are important of organismal survival. Peripheral sensory neurons interact intimately with glial cells. While the function of axonal ensheathment by glia is well studied, less is known about the functional significance of glial interaction with the somatodendritic compartment of neurons. Herein, we show that three distinct glia cell types differentially wrap around the axonal and somatodendritic surface of the polymodal dendritic arborization (da) neuron of the Drosophila peripheral nervous system for detection of thermal, mechanical, and light stimuli. We find that glial cell-specific loss of the chromatin modifier gene dATRX in the subperineurial glial layer leads to selective elimination of somatodendritic glial ensheathment, thus allowing us to investigate the function of such ensheathment. We find that somatodendritic glial ensheathment regulates the morphology of the dendritic arbor, as well as the activity of the sensory neuron, in response to sensory stimuli. Additionally, glial ensheathment of the neuronal soma influences dendritic regeneration after injury.","Limits to the world's green water resources for food, feed, fiber, timber, and bioenergy.",https://www.ncbi.nlm.nih.gov/pubmed/30804199,Proceedings of the National Academy of Sciences of the United States of America,2019 05 06,"Green water--rainfall over land that eventually flows back to the atmosphere as evapotranspiration--is the main source of water to produce food, feed, fiber, timber, and bioenergy. To understand how freshwater scarcity constrains production of these goods, we need to consider limits to the green water footprint (WFg), the green water flow allocated to human society. However, research traditionally focuses on scarcity of blue water--groundwater and surface water. Here we expand the debate on water scarcity by considering green water scarcity (WSg). At 5 × 5 arc-minute spatial resolution, we quantify WFg and the maximum sustainable level to this footprint (WFg,m), while accounting for green water requirements to support biodiversity. We then estimate WSg per country as the ratio of the national aggregate WFg to the national aggregate WFg,m We find that globally WFg amounts to 56% of WFg,m, and overshoots it in several places, for example in countries in Europe, Central America, the Middle East, and South Asia. The sustainably available green water flows in these countries are mostly or fully allocated to human activities (predominately agriculture and forestry), occasionally at the cost of green water flows earmarked for nature. By ignoring limits to the growing human WFg, we risk further loss of ecosystem values that depend on the remaining untouched green water flows. We emphasize that green water is a critical and limited resource that should explicitly be part of any assessment of water scarcity, food security, or bioenergy potential.",Redox and pH gradients drive amino acid synthesis in iron oxyhydroxide mineral systems.,https://www.ncbi.nlm.nih.gov/pubmed/30804197,Proceedings of the National Academy of Sciences of the United States of America,2019 06 13,"Iron oxyhydroxide minerals, known to be chemically reactive and significant for elemental cycling, are thought to have been abundant in early-Earth seawater, sediments, and hydrothermal systems. In the anoxic Fe2+-rich early oceans, these minerals would have been only partially oxidized and thus redox-active, perhaps able to promote prebiotic chemical reactions. We show that pyruvate, a simple organic molecule that can form in hydrothermal systems, can undergo reductive amination in the presence of mixed-valence iron oxyhydroxides to form the amino acid alanine, as well as the reduced product lactate. Furthermore, geochemical gradients of pH, redox, and temperature in iron oxyhydroxide systems affect product selectivity. The maximum yield of alanine was observed when the iron oxyhydroxide mineral contained 1:1 Fe(II):Fe(III), under alkaline conditions, and at moderately warm temperatures. These represent conditions that may be found, for example, in iron-containing sediments near an alkaline hydrothermal vent system. The partially oxidized state of the precipitate was significant in promoting amino acid formation: Purely ferrous hydroxides did not drive reductive amination but instead promoted pyruvate reduction to lactate, and ferric hydroxides did not result in any reaction. Prebiotic chemistry driven by redox-active iron hydroxide minerals on the early Earth would therefore be strongly affected by geochemical gradients of Eh, pH, and temperature, and liquid-phase products would be able to diffuse to other conditions within the sediment column to participate in further reactions."

This is one of the most hotly debated questions in ancient Mediterranean history and cultural research. In this study, we use silver to answer this question, presenting the largest dataset of chemical and isotopic analyses of silver items from silver hoards found in Phoenician homeland sites. Intertwining lead isotope analysis of silver items with precise archaeological context and chronology, we provide analytical evidence for the onset of Phoenician westward expansion. We suggest that the quest for silver instigated a long, exploratory phase, first in Anatolia (Asia Minor) and Sardinia, and subsequently in the Iberian Peninsula. This phase preceded the establishment of sustainable, flourishing Phoenician colonies in the West by over a century. In so doing, our results buttress the ""precolonization"" theory, accord it a firm chronological framework, and demonstrate that the quest for silver (and probably other metals) was an incentive for Phoenician westward expansion. Furthermore, our results show that the Phoenicians introduced innovative silver production methods to historic Europe.",Nitrogen-fixing red alder trees tap rock-derived nutrients.,https://www.ncbi.nlm.nih.gov/pubmed/30804181,Proceedings of the National Academy of Sciences of the United States of America,2019 06 13,"Symbiotic nitrogen (N)-fixing trees supply significant N inputs to forest ecosystems, leading to increased soil fertility, forest growth, and carbon storage. Rapid growth and stoichiometric constraints of N fixers also create high demands for rock-derived nutrients such as phosphorus (P), while excess fixed N can generate acidity and accelerate leaching of rock-derived nutrients such as calcium (Ca). This ability of N-fixing trees to accelerate cycles of Ca, P, and other rock-derived nutrients has fostered speculation of a direct link between N fixation and mineral weathering in terrestrial ecosystems. However, field evidence that N-fixing trees have enhanced access to rock-derived nutrients is lacking. Here we use strontium (Sr) isotopes as a tracer of nutrient sources in a mixed-species temperate rainforest to show that N-fixing trees access more rock-derived nutrients than nonfixing trees. The N-fixing tree red alder (Alnus rubra), on average, took up 8 to 18% more rock-derived Sr than five co-occurring nonfixing tree species, including two with high requirements for rock-derived nutrients. The increased access to rock-derived nutrients occurred despite spatial variation in community-wide Sr sources across the forest, and only N fixers had foliar Sr isotopes that differed significantly from soil exchangeable pools. We calculate that increased uptake of rock-derived nutrients by N-fixing alder requires a 64% increase in weathering supply of nutrients over nonfixing trees. These findings provide direct evidence that an N-fixing tree species can also accelerate nutrient inputs from rock weathering, thus increasing supplies of multiple nutrients that limit carbon uptake and storage in forest ecosystems.",Evolution of chloroplast retrograde signaling facilitates green plant adaptation to land.,https://www.ncbi.nlm.nih.gov/pubmed/30804180,Proceedings of the National Academy of Sciences of the United States of America,2019 05 06,"Chloroplast retrograde signaling networks are vital for chloroplast biogenesis, operation, and signaling, including excess light and drought stress signaling. To date, retrograde signaling has been considered in the context of land plant adaptation, but not regarding the origin and evolution of signaling cascades linking chloroplast function to stomatal regulation. We show that key elements of the chloroplast retrograde signaling process, the nucleotide phosphatase (SAL1) and 3'-phosphoadenosine-5'-phosphate (PAP) metabolism, evolved in streptophyte algae-the algal ancestors of land plants. We discover an early evolution of SAL1-PAP chloroplast retrograde signaling in stomatal regulation based on conserved gene and protein structure, function, and enzyme activity and transit peptides of SAL1s in species including flowering plants, the fern Ceratopteris richardii, and the moss Physcomitrella patens Moreover, we demonstrate that PAP regulates stomatal closure via secondary messengers and ion transport in guard cells of these diverse lineages. The origin of stomata facilitated gas exchange in the earliest land plants. Our findings suggest that the conquest of land by plants was enabled by rapid response to drought stress through the deployment of an ancestral SAL1-PAP signaling pathway, intersecting with the core abscisic acid signaling in stomatal guard cells.",Rapidly declining remarkability of temperature anomalies may obscure public perception of climate change.,https://www.ncbi.nlm.nih.gov/pubmed/30804179,Proceedings of the National Academy of Sciences of the United States of America,2019 06 13,"The changing global climate is producing increasingly unusual weather relative to preindustrial conditions. In an absolute sense, these changing conditions constitute direct evidence of anthropogenic climate change. However, human evaluation of weather as either normal or abnormal will also be influenced by a range of factors including expectations, memory limitations, and cognitive biases. Here we show that experience of weather in recent years-rather than longer historical periods-determines the climatic baseline against which current weather is evaluated, potentially obscuring public recognition of anthropogenic climate change. We employ variation in decadal trends in temperature at weekly and county resolution over the continental United States, combined with discussion of the weather drawn from over 2 billion social media posts. These data indicate that the remarkability of particular temperatures changes rapidly with repeated exposure. Using sentiment analysis tools, we provide evidence for a ""boiling frog"" effect: The declining noteworthiness of historically extreme temperatures is not accompanied by a decline in the negative sentiment that they induce, indicating that social normalization of extreme conditions rather than adaptation is driving these results. Using climate model projections we show that, despite large increases in absolute temperature, anomalies relative to our empirically estimated shifting baseline are small and not clearly distinguishable from zero throughout the 21st century.",Residential green space in childhood is associated with lower risk of psychiatric disorders from adolescence into adulthood.,https://www.ncbi.nlm.nih.gov/pubmed/30804178,Proceedings of the National Academy of Sciences of the United States of America,2019 05 06,"Urban residence is associated with a higher risk of some psychiatric disorders, but the underlying drivers remain unknown. There is increasing evidence that the level of exposure to natural environments impacts mental health, but few large-scale epidemiological studies have assessed the general existence and importance of such associations. Here, we investigate the prospective association between green space and mental health in the Danish population. Green space presence was assessed at the individual level using high-resolution satellite data to calculate the normalized difference vegetation index within a 210 × 210 m square around each person's place of residence (∼1 million people) from birth to the age of 10. We show that high levels of green space presence during childhood are associated with lower risk of a wide spectrum of psychiatric disorders later in life. Risk for subsequent mental illness for those who lived with the lowest level of green space during childhood was up to 55% higher across various disorders compared with those who lived with the highest level of green space. The association remained even after adjusting for urbanization, socioeconomic factors, parental history of mental illness, and parental age. Stronger association of cumulative green space presence during childhood compared with single-year green space presence suggests that presence throughout childhood is important. Our results show that green space during childhood is associated with better mental health, supporting efforts to better integrate natural environments into urban planning and childhood life.","Morphology, pathology, and the vertebral posture of the La Chapelle-aux-Saints Neandertal.",https://www.ncbi.nlm.nih.gov/pubmed/30804177,Proceedings of the National Academy of Sciences of the United States of America,2019 06 13,"Although the early postural reconstructions of the Neandertals as incompletely erect were rejected half a century ago, recent studies of Neandertal vertebral remains have inferred a hypolordotic, flat lower back and spinal imbalance for them, including the La Chapelle-aux-Saints 1 skeleton. These studies form part of a persistent trend to view the Neandertals as less ""human"" than ourselves despite growing evidence for little if any differences in basic functional anatomy and behavioral capabilities. We have therefore reassessed the spinal posture of La Chapelle-aux-Saints 1 using a new pelvic reconstruction to infer lumbar lordosis, interarticulation of lower lumbar (L4-S1) and cervical (C4-T2) vertebrae, and consideration of his widespread age-related osteoarthritis. La Chapelle-aux-Saints 1 exhibits a pelvic incidence (and hence lumbar lordosis) similar to modern humans, articulation of lumbar and cervical vertebrae indicating pronounced lordosis, and Baastrup disease as a product of his advanced age, osteoarthritis, and lordosis. Our findings challenge the view of generally small spinal curvatures in Neandertals. Setting aside the developmentally abnormal Kebara 2 vertebral column, La Chapelle-aux-Saints 1 is joined by other Neandertals with sufficient vertebral remains in providing them with a fully upright (and human) axial posture.",Activation of GCN2 by the ribosomal P-stalk.,https://www.ncbi.nlm.nih.gov/pubmed/30804176,Proceedings of the National Academy of Sciences of the United States of America,2019 05 06,"Cells dynamically adjust their protein translation profile to maintain homeostasis in changing environments. During nutrient stress, the kinase general control nonderepressible 2 (GCN2) phosphorylates translation initiation factor eIF2α, initiating the integrated stress response (ISR). To examine the mechanism of GCN2 activation, we have reconstituted this process in vitro, using purified components. We find that recombinant human GCN2 is potently stimulated by ribosomes and, to a lesser extent, by tRNA. Hydrogen/deuterium exchange-mass spectrometry (HDX-MS) mapped GCN2-ribosome interactions to domain II of the uL10 subunit of the ribosomal P-stalk. Using recombinant, purified P-stalk, we showed that this domain of uL10 is the principal component of binding to GCN2; however, the conserved 14-residue C-terminal tails (CTTs) in the P1 and P2 P-stalk proteins are also essential for GCN2 activation. The HisRS-like and kinase domains of GCN2 show conformational changes upon binding recombinant P-stalk complex. Given that the ribosomal P-stalk stimulates the GTPase activity of elongation factors during translation, we propose that the P-stalk could link GCN2 activation to translational stress, leading to initiation of ISR.","Geoarchaeological evidence from Angkor, Cambodia, reveals a gradual decline rather than a catastrophic 15th-century collapse.",https://www.ncbi.nlm.nih.gov/pubmed/30804175,Proceedings of the National Academy of Sciences of the United States of America,2019 04 24,"Alternative models exist for the movement of large urban populations following the 15th-century CE abandonment of Angkor, Cambodia. One model emphasizes an urban diaspora following the implosion of state control in the capital related, in part, to hydroclimatic variability. An alternative model suggests a more complex picture and a gradual rather than catastrophic demographic movement. No decisive empirical data exist to distinguish between these two competing models. Here we show that the intensity of land use within the economic and administrative core of the city began to decline more than one century before the Ayutthayan invasion that conventionally marks the end of the Angkor Period. Using paleobotanical and stratigraphic data derived from radiometrically dated sediment cores extracted from the 12th-century walled city of Angkor Thom, we show that indicia for burning, forest disturbance, and soil erosion all decline as early as the first decades of the 14th century CE, and that the moat of Angkor Thom was no longer being maintained by the end of the 14th century. These data indicate a protracted decline in occupation within the economic and administrative core of the city, rather than an abrupt demographic collapse, suggesting the focus of power began to shift to urban centers outside of the capital during the 14th century.",Coronary artery lesion risk and mediating mechanism in children with complete and incomplete Kawasaki disease.,https://www.ncbi.nlm.nih.gov/pubmed/30804174,Journal of investigative medicine : the official publication of the American Federation for Clinical Research,2019 02 26,"To compare the risk of coronary artery lesions (CAL) in children with complete and incomplete Kawasaki disease (KD) before and after immunoglobulin therapy and explore the mediation mechanisms underlying this association. All patients with KD admitted to the Wenzhou Medical University affiliated Yuying Children's Hospital were divided into complete and incomplete KD groups. The independent effect of KD type on the risk of CAL and the intermediate effect of admission time on the association between KD type and CAL were assessed. The incidence of CAL in children with incomplete KD was higher than that in children with complete KD (33.9% vs 23.0%, p<0.001), and was also higher before therapy (27.5% vs 14.8%). Among children without CAL before therapy, there was no statistical difference in the incidence of CAL after treatment between the two groups. Mediation analysis found that the mediating effect of admission time was 1.07 (95% C: 1.01 to 1.13), and the direct effect of KD type on CAL was 1.59 (95% CI 1.17 to 2.16); proportion mediated was 15.71%. In conclusion, the risk of CAL among patients with incomplete KD was higher than that for complete KD, especially before therapy. In patients without CAL before treatment, the risk of CAL after treatment was equivalent for the two groups. Delayed admission may be one of the important mediating mechanisms for the higher risk of CAL in incomplete KD children.",Defining Endodontic Residents' Clinical Experiences: A National Survey.,https://www.ncbi.nlm.nih.gov/pubmed/30804173,Journal of dental education,2019 05 13,"Endodontic residency programs across the U.S. vary in the exposure they provide to residents in procedures, protocols, and equipment. Having information on the range of clinical experiences provided in programs would be useful for program directors and for applicants who are seeking the best fit for their residency. The aim of this study was to collect information from residents in U.S. endodontic residency programs about the procedures and equipment they experienced in their programs. In January 2018, a 14-question survey was emailed to all 437 endodontic residents with an email address in the 2016-17 American Association of Endodontists Membership Directory. Survey items asked about the number of endodontic procedures, techniques employed, and products used in residents' programs. A total of 133 endodontic residents responded to all or part of the survey, for a 30% response rate. The majority reported completing 151-250 nonsurgical root canals, 26-50 nonsurgical retreatments, 0-10 surgical retreatments, and 0-10 regenerative endodontic procedures during their residencies. All respondents said they used a surgical operating microscope (SOM), and 82% reported using a multi-file rotary system for nonsurgical procedures. Respondents reported that the main instruments they used were Dentsply Sirona file systems, and the most commonly used obturation technique was warm vertical compaction/condensation, reported by 92% of respondents. These endodontic residents reported being exposed to a variety of procedures, products, and protocols during their residency. Based on information they provided, prospective endodontic residency applicants can expect to use the SOM for treatment, to gain extensive experience in primary nonsurgical endodontic treatment, and to not perform endodontic surgery during their first year of postgraduate training."
