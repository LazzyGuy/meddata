Despite the abundance of metagenomics data, the functional dynamics of gut microbiota in human health and disease remain elusive. Urolithin A (UroA), a major microbial metabolite derived from polyphenolics of berries and pomegranate fruits displays anti-inflammatory, anti-oxidative, and anti-ageing activities. Here, we show that UroA and its potent synthetic analogue (UAS03) significantly enhance gut barrier function and inhibit unwarranted inflammation. We demonstrate that UroA and UAS03 exert their barrier functions through activation of aryl hydrocarbon receptor (AhR)- nuclear factor erythroid 2-related factor 2 (Nrf2)-dependent pathways to upregulate epithelial tight junction proteins. Importantly, treatment with these compounds attenuated colitis in pre-clinical models by remedying barrier dysfunction in addition to anti-inflammatory activities. Cumulatively, the results highlight how microbial metabolites provide two-pronged beneficial activities at gut epithelium by enhancing barrier functions and reducing inflammation to protect from colonic diseases.",A tumor-specific endogenous repetitive element is induced by herpesviruses.,https://www.ncbi.nlm.nih.gov/pubmed/30626867,Nature communications,2019 04 01,"Tandem satellite repeats account for 3% of the human genome. One of them, Human Satellite II (HSATII), is highly expressed in several epithelial cancers and cancer cell lines. Here we report an acute induction of HSATII RNA in human cells infected with two herpes viruses. We show that human cytomegalovirus (HCMV) IE1 and IE2 proteins cooperate to induce HSATII RNA affecting several aspects of the HCMV replication cycle, viral titers and infected-cell processes. HSATII RNA expression in tissue from two chronic HCMV colitis patients correlates with the strength of CMV antigen staining. Thus, endogenous HSATII RNA synthesis after herpesvirus infections appears to have functionally important consequences for viral replication and may provide a novel insight into viral pathogenesis. The HSATII induction seen in both infected and cancer cells suggests possible convergence upon common HSATII-based regulatory mechanisms in these seemingly disparate diseases.",Histone H3 binding to the PHD1 domain of histone demethylase KDM5A enables active site remodeling.,https://www.ncbi.nlm.nih.gov/pubmed/30626866,Nature communications,2019 04 01,"Histone demethylase KDM5A removes methyl marks from lysine 4 of histone H3 and is often overexpressed in cancer. The in vitro demethylase activity of KDM5A is allosterically enhanced by binding of its product, unmodified H3 peptides, to its PHD1 reader domain. However, the molecular basis of this allosteric enhancement is unclear. Here we show that saturation of the PHD1 domain by the H3 N-terminal tail peptides stabilizes binding of the substrate to the catalytic domain and improves the catalytic efficiency of demethylation. When present in saturating concentrations, differently modified H3 N-terminal tail peptides have a similar effect on demethylation. However, they vary greatly in their affinity towards the PHD1 domain, suggesting that H3 modifications can tune KDM5A activity. Furthermore, hydrogen/deuterium exchange coupled with mass spectrometry (HDX-MS) experiments reveal conformational changes in the allosterically enhanced state. Our findings may enable future development of anti-cancer therapies targeting regions involved in allosteric regulation.",Single-cell microRNA-mRNA co-sequencing reveals non-genetic heterogeneity and mechanisms of microRNA regulation.,https://www.ncbi.nlm.nih.gov/pubmed/30626865,Nature communications,2019 04 01,"Measuring multiple omics profiles from the same single cell opens up the opportunity to decode molecular regulation that underlies intercellular heterogeneity in development and disease. Here, we present co-sequencing of microRNAs and mRNAs in the same single cell using a half-cell genomics approach. This method demonstrates good robustness (~95% success rate) and reproducibility (R2 = 0.93 for both microRNAs and mRNAs), yielding paired half-cell microRNA and mRNA profiles, which we can independently validate. By linking the level of microRNAs to the expression of predicted target mRNAs across 19 single cells that are phenotypically identical, we observe that the predicted targets are significantly anti-correlated with the variation of abundantly expressed microRNAs. This suggests that microRNA expression variability alone may lead to non-genetic cell-to-cell heterogeneity. Genome-scale analysis of paired microRNA-mRNA co-profiles further allows us to derive and validate regulatory relationships of cellular pathways controlling microRNA expression and intercellular variability.",Planetary-scale streak structure reproduced in high-resolution simulations of the Venus atmosphere with a low-stability layer.,https://www.ncbi.nlm.nih.gov/pubmed/30626864,Nature communications,2019 03 29,"Cloud patterns are important clues for revealing the atmospheric circulation of Venus. Recently, a planetary-scale streak structure has been discovered in middle- and lower-cloud images of Venus' night-side taken by IR2, the 2-μm camera, on board the Akatsuki orbiter. However, its formation mechanism has not been investigated. Here we succeed, for the first time, in reproducing the patterns of the observed streak structure, as regions of strong downward flows that develop in high-resolution global simulations of the Venus atmosphere. The streaks are formed in both hemispheres with equatorial symmetry, which is caused by equatorial Rossby-like and Kelvin-like waves with zonal wavenumber one. The low-stability layer that has been suggested by past observations is essential for reproducing the streak structure. The streaks of downward flow result from the interaction of the meridionally tilted phase lines of the Rossby-like waves and the characteristics of baroclinic instability produced around the low-stability layer.",Cervical isometric exercises improve dysphagia and cervical spine malalignment following stroke with hemiparesis: a randomized controlled trial.,https://www.ncbi.nlm.nih.gov/pubmed/30626863,European journal of physical and rehabilitation medicine,2019 05 16,"Hemiparesis following stroke can cause cervical spine scoliosis, kyphosis or hyperlordosis.

Anesthetic considerations for patients with this syndrome include intubation difficulties secondary to the collapse of fibro-elastic tissues in the trachea and a reported resistance to local anesthetics. CASE REPORT Our patient was a 22-year-old G4P0030 woman with a history of morbid obesity, seizures, Barrett's esophagus, hypermobility being evaluated for Ehlers-Danlos syndrome, and anaphylaxis to an unknown local anesthetic who was scheduled for cesarean delivery. She refused allergy testing. After rapid-sequence induction of general anesthesia, video laryngoscopy facilitated endotracheal intubation. Delivery and recovery were uneventful for the mother and child. CONCLUSIONS No guidelines for neuraxial or general anesthesia exist for patients with Ehlers-Danlos syndrome, hypermobility type. Increased rates of cervical spine instability and local anesthetic resistance have been reported in this population and should be considered when developing the anesthetic plan.",Prognostic Value of Quantitative Perfusion Parameters by Enhanced Ultrasound in Endometrial Cancer.,https://www.ncbi.nlm.nih.gov/pubmed/30626861,Medical science monitor : international medical journal of experimental and clinical research,2019 03 22,"BACKGROUND Tumor perfusion is significantly associated with the development and aggressiveness of endometrial cancer. The aim of this study was to assess the prognostic value of quantitative perfusion parameters measured by contrast-enhanced ultrasonography (CEUS) in endometrial cancer before surgery. MATERIAL AND METHODS A total of 223 patients with endometrial cancer were included between 1 May 1 2013 and 1 May 1 2017 for preoperative CEUS. The mean enhancement rate (ER) was calculated as enhancement intensity (EI)/rise time (RT) results from time‑intensity curve (TIC) during CEUS. After a mean follow-up of 33.5±9.9 months, the correlation of ER and postoperative overall survival (OS) and disease-free survival (DFS) was analyzed using univariate and multivariate analysis. RESULTS The optimal cutoff ER value predicting survival based on the ROC curve was 1.8 dB/s. Kaplan-Meier univariate analysis demonstrated that a patient with a high ER level had worse DFS and OS than those with a low ER (DFS, P<0.01; OS, P<0.05). In multivariate analysis, ER was confirmed as an independent predictor for both recurrence (HR, 1.68; 95% CI: 1.01-7.73) and OS (HR, 1.98; 95%CI: 1.01-7.83) for patients with endometrial cancer (both P<0.05).

During surveillance, magnetic resonance cholangiopancreatography revealed gradual enlargement of a small cyst near the MPD stenosis and contrast-enhanced computed tomography revealed locally progressive atrophic parenchyma in the pancreatic body. On endoscopic retrograde pancreatography, the MPD stenosis was more severe than it had been at diagnosis 3 years earlier. Endoscopic ultrasonography (EUS) showed a 10-mm hypoechoic mass adjacent to the MPD stenosis. The mass was pathologically diagnosed as an adenocarcinoma using EUS-guided fine needle aspiration, and distal pancreatectomy was performed. On histopathological examination, the resected specimen was found to be a moderately differentiated 9-mm invasive ductal carcinoma.

Abdominal CT and MRI revealed that the tumor comprised a mixture of cystic and solid components, and there was dilation of the bile duct. A clinical diagnosis of intraductal papillary neoplasm of the bile duct was made. Caudate and right hepatic lobectomy was performed. The pathological diagnosis of the tumor was a papillary adenocarcinoma. This case, in which the patient was followed for 6 years before curative surgical treatment, is significant, because it demonstrates the slow-growing nature of this tumor."

The PillCam Progress Indicator in the RAPID 6.5 software program graphically demonstrates the progress of the capsule endoscope through the small-bowel. This study aimed to clarify the usefulness of the PillCam Progress Indicator in choosing the initial DBE route. Methods We retrospectively examined 50 consecutive patients with 50 target lesions detected on both CE and DBE at Hiroshima University Hospital from January 2011 to February 2018. In this study, we selected antegrade DBE on the basis of % Capsule Progress <50% as a clinical trial. The association between the PillCam Progress Indicator data and the DBE route to the target lesion was analyzed. Results The target lesion was reached via the initial DBE route in 96% (48/50) of cases. The cutoff values for selecting an antegrade route for DBE were 50% for % Capsule Progress and 42% for % SB Time. At the cutoff value, the sensitivity, specificity, and positive and negative predictive values for route selection were 100%, 91%, 93%, and 100% for % Capsule Progress and 96%, 91%, 93%, and 95% for % SB Time.

The phenotype of Japanese BD has been changing over the past 20 years, and the rate of human leukocyte antigen (HLA)-B*51-positive complete type is decreasing while that of intestinal type is increasing. This phenotypical evolution may be related to changes in as-yet-unknown environmental factors, as the immigration influx in Japan is low. Mechanisms discovered by genome-wide association studies include ERAP1-mediated HLA class I antigen bounding pathway, autoinflammation, Th17 cells, natural killer cells, and polarized macrophages, a similar genetic architecture to Crohn's disease, ankylosing spondylitis, and psoriasis. As for treatments, management guidelines have been implemented, and the development of tumor necrosis factor (TNF) inhibitors is markedly improving the outcome of BD, but evidence supporting treatment for special-type BD is limited.

We evaluated the additional therapeutic effect of HCQ in Japanese patients with systemic lupus erythematosus (SLE) on maintenance therapy. Methods Patients with SLE who visited our hospital from 2015 to 2016 and were taking prednisolone (PSL) at <20 mg/day were retrospectively evaluated. All patients were divided into three groups according to their maintenance treatment regimen: PSL + immunosuppressant, PSL alone, and no treatment. We compared the changes in the SLE disease activity index (SLEDAI), PSL dose, and cumulative flare rate between patients who were and were not treated with HCQ. Results Among the 165 patients evaluated, 35 (21.2%) were treated with HCQ. The mean period of observation did not differ markedly between patients who did and did not receive HCQ (p=0.3). The SLEDAI and PSL dose were significantly reduced in patients who received HCQ, regardless of their background treatment regimen. The cumulative flare rate was lower in patients who received HCQ than in those who did not in the PSL + immunosuppressant and no maintenance treatment groups (p=0.03 and 0.05, respectively). Conclusion The addition of HCQ reduced the disease activity and allowed PSL dose reduction, regardless of background treatment, in Japanese patients with SLE.",Successful Treatment of ROS1-rearranged Lung Cancer Complicated by Hypertrophic Pulmonary Osteoarthropathy with Crizotinib Therapy.,https://www.ncbi.nlm.nih.gov/pubmed/30626830,"Internal medicine (Tokyo, Japan)",2019 05 16,"Hypertrophic pulmonary osteoarthropathy (HPO) is a paraneoplastic syndrome characterized by digital clubbing, arthritis, and periostitis.

The success rates (defined as SUA ≤6.0 mg/dL) were calculated, and a multivariate analysis was used to identify factors associated with ""therapeutic failure"" to achieve target SUA levels. Results The rate of successfully achieving the target SUA level was 37.5%. The body mass index (BMI) was significantly associated with therapeutic failure [25.0≤ Category (C) 2<27.5, adjusted odds ratio (AOR) =1.35; 27.5≤C3<30.0, AOR=1.69; C4 ≥ 30.0, AOR=1.94; relative to C1<25.0]. A significant positive association was also observed between waist circumference (WC) and therapeutic failure (85≤C2<90, OR=1.29; 90≤C3<95, OR=1.41; 95≤C4, OR=2.28; relative to C1<85.0 cm). Those with higher BMI/WC measurements were significantly more likely to have higher SUA levels than those with lower such measurements. The ongoing intake of dyslipidemia medication was identified as a protective factor against therapeutic failure. Discussion Our findings suggest a possible association between obesity and therapeutic failure, underscoring the importance of maintaining lipid profiles as part of managing SUA levels. Better management of both obesity and dyslipidemia may prevent future cardiovascular disorders by ensuring healthier SUA levels."

The aim of the present study was to examine the association between severe drug-induced hypoglycemia and seasonal variations, and to elucidate the contributing factors. Methods This retrospective, single center clinical study, analyzed the cases of 125 patients who required emergency hospitalization for severe drug-induced hypoglycemia between January 1, 2001 and December 31, 2014. The period from November to April was defined as the cold season. Results Severe hypoglycemia occurred more often in the cold season than in the warm season. In the cold season, 62 of 9,981 (0.6%) emergency department visits involved patients who required hospitalization for drug-induced hypoglycemia. In contrast, in the warm season, 27 of 8,649 (0.3%) visits involved patients who required hospitalization for drug-induced hypoglycemia (p=0.002). The proportion of patients treated with sulfonylurea (SU) in the cold season was higher than that in the warm season. Even the use of low-dose SU caused hypoglycemia in the cold season. In the SU-treated group, the proportion of patients with white blood cell and/or C-reactive protein elevation was higher in the cold season than in the warm season (p=0.04). Conclusion Severe glucose-lowering drug-induced hypoglycemia occured more frequently in the cold season than in the warm season, and was associated with an inflammatory state in patients treated with SU.",Symptoms and Upper Gastrointestinal Mucosal Injury Associated with Bisphosphonate Therapy.,https://www.ncbi.nlm.nih.gov/pubmed/30626809,"Internal medicine (Tokyo, Japan)",2019 06 13,"Objective The incidence of osteoporosis is increasing with the rapid aging of the Japanese population. Bisphosphonates are first-line agents used for the treatment of osteoporosis, but they can cause upper gastrointestinal mucosal injury. This study investigated symptoms and upper gastrointestinal mucosal injury associated with oral bisphosphonates. Methods Symptoms were evaluated using the F-scale questionnaire, and esophageal mucosal injury and gastroduodenal ulceration were assessed by endoscopy. Patients were stratified by the type of bisphosphonate (alendronate, risedronate, or minodronate), treatment schedule (once weekly or every four weeks), and the concomitant use of other medications [antithrombotic agents, nonsteroidal anti-inflammatory drugs (NSAIDs), or acid suppressants]. Patients The subjects included 221 patients treated with oral bisphosphonates for at least one month. Results The median F-scale total score was 4 (0-34), reflux score was 2 (0-20), and the mean dyspepsia score was 2 (0-16). Endoscopy showed esophageal mucosal injury of Grade A or worse (Los Angeles classification) in 22/221 patients (10.0%) and gastroduodenal ulcers in 9 patients (4.1%). The dyspepsia score in patients who took minodronate every four weeks was significantly lower (p<0.05) in comparison to patients who took other bisphosphonates. The dyspepsia score was significantly higher (p<0.05) and mucosal injury was significantly more frequent in patients who also used antithrombotic agents and NSAIDs. Conclusion Symptoms and upper gastrointestinal mucosal damage were not necessarily frequent or severe in patients treated with bisphosphonates. However, the concomitant use of bisphosphonates with antithrombotic agents and NSAIDs increased both symptoms and mucosal injury.

However, the second patient had wide-spreading cholangiocarcinoma and, despite being treated once by full coiling, developed a second rupture of PA two months after starting systemic chemotherapy. Clinicians should be aware of the possibility of PA and carefully follow stented patients after endovascular treatment.",Huge Hepatocellular Carcinoma Treated with Radical Hepatectomy after Drug-eluting Bead Transarterial Chemoembolization.,https://www.ncbi.nlm.nih.gov/pubmed/30626806,"Internal medicine (Tokyo, Japan)",2019 06 13,"We performed split drug-eluting bead transarterial chemoembolization (DEB-TACE) in a patient with huge unresectable hepatocellular carcinoma and multiple intrahepatic metastases. However, TACE was discontinued at the fourth application because the tumor was fed by the cholecystic artery. As most intrahepatic metastases disappeared following DEB-TACE, the patient was able to undergo radical hepatectomy, and has maintained a complete response. DEB-TACE enables cancer treatment without reducing the liver or renal function. However, it is associated with a risk of ischemia in other organs in patients whose arteries feed both tumors and other organs; thus appropriate selection is required.",A Computed Tomographic Assessment of Tracheostomy Tube Placement in Patients with Chronic Neurological Disorders: The Prevention of Tracheoarterial Fistula.,https://www.ncbi.nlm.nih.gov/pubmed/30626805,"Internal medicine (Tokyo, Japan)",2019 06 10,"Objective Tracheoarterial fistula (TAF) is a rare but devastating complication of tracheostomy caused by pressure necrosis from the elbow, tip, or over-inflated cuff of the tracheostomy tube. The incidence of TAF is reportedly higher in patients with neurological disorders than in those without such disorders. To evaluate the incidence of and factors contributing to the misalignment of tracheostomy tubes in bedridden patients with chronic neurological disorders. Methods We retrospectively assessed three-dimensionally reconstructed serial computed tomography (CT) images to see if the tip of the tube made contact with the tracheal wall and if the main arteries were running adjacent to the tube's elbow, tip or cuff. Results The tip of the tube was in contact with the tracheal wall in 14 of the 30 patients assessed. Among them, the tip was adjacent to the innominate artery in eight, the aortic arch in three and an aberrant right subclavian artery in one. In one patient with the tube tip adjacent to the aortic arch and the other four patients, the cuff of the tube was adjacent to the innominate artery across the tracheal wall. Patients with the tube tip in contact with the anterior tracheal wall had a significantly greater cervical lordosis angle than those without contact (p<0.05). Conclusion More than half of tracheostomized patients with chronic neurological disorders had a latent risk of TAF. The variability in the location of the innominate artery, anomalies of the aortic arch, and skeletal deformities may therefore be contributing factors.",Curcumin Down-Regulates Toll-Like Receptor-2 Gene Expression and Function in Human Cystic Fibrosis Bronchial Epithelial Cells.,https://www.ncbi.nlm.nih.gov/pubmed/30626802,Biological & pharmaceutical bulletin,2019 03 04,"Cystic fibrosis (CF), the most common lethal inherited disorder caused by mutation in the gene encoding the CF transmembrane regulator (CFTR), is characterized by chronic inflammation that ultimately leads to death from respiratory failure. In CF patients, up-regulation of toll-like receptor-2 (TLR2), a pattern recognition receptor that senses CF-pathogenic bacteria Staphylococcus aureus peptidoglycan (PGN), in airway epithelial cells is observed, and enhanced proinflammatory responses towards PGN may result in detrimental effects in CF patients. Here, we showed that curcumin, a well known anti-inflammatory agent derived from the curry spice turmeric, inhibits TLR2 expression in CF bronchial epithelial cell line, CFBE41o- cells. Strong suppression of TLR2 gene and protein expression was observed at more than 40 µM of curcumin treatment in CFBE41o- cells. Consistent with decreased expression of TLR2, PGN-dependent interleukin-8 (IL-8) gene up-regulation was markedly reduced by 40 µM of curcumin treatment. Strong reductions of TLR2 gene expression and function were also observed in primary human CF bronchial epithelial cells, but not in human non-CF primary cells. Interestingly, curcumin treatment decreased nuclear expression of transcription factor specificity protein 1 (SP1), a factor that is critical for increased basal TLR2 expression in CF cell line and primary cells. Finally, curcumin-dependent SP1 reduction was diminished by anti-oxidant N-acetylcystein (NAC) and proteasomal inhibitor MG-132, suggesting the crucial roles of oxidative and proteasomal degradation pathways. Taken together, our study shows that curcumin down-regulates TLR2 gene expression and function in CF bronchial epithelial cells possibly by accelerating SP1 degradation via an oxidative process.",Histone Deacetylase Inhibitor SAHA Treatment Prevents the Development of Heart Failure after Myocardial Infarction via an Induction of Heat-Shock Proteins in Rats.,https://www.ncbi.nlm.nih.gov/pubmed/30626801,Biological & pharmaceutical bulletin,2019 03 04,"Protein quality control (PQC) in the heart plays an important role to maintain cellular protein homeostasis. Impairment of PQC may cause the development of heart failure. It is well known that histone deacetylase 6 (HDAC6) is an essential enzyme for regulating the cellular PQC response. In this study, we aimed at examining the association between HDAC6 and the chaperone system and the effects of HDAC6 inhibition in the development of heart failure following myocardial infarction (MI). MI was induced by coronary artery ligation. Coronary artery-ligated and sham-operated rats were divided into groups that were orally administered suberoylanilide hydroxamic acid (SAHA) or vehicle from the 2nd to 8th week after the operation. The cardiac function and protein expression levels in the viable left ventricle were analyzed by echocardiography, Western blotting, and immunohistochemistry at the 2nd and 8th weeks after the operation. The deacetylase activity of HDAC6 was markedly elevated during the development of heart failure after MI. In the failing heart, a decrease in heat-shock protein (HSP) contents and an accumulation of ubiquitinated proteins were observed, indicating PQC dysfunction. Inhibition of HDAC6 activity by SAHA treatment enhanced the translocation of heat-shock transcription factor 1 to the nucleus and induced the expression of HSP, resulting in maintenance of cellular protein homeostasis. The cardiac pump function after MI was also improved by SAHA administration. Our findings suggest that inhibition of HDAC6 activity is a novel approach for the treatment of heart failure following MI.",Expression and Characterization of the Human Intestinal Bacterial Enzyme Which Cleaves the C-Glycosidic Bond in 3″-Oxo-puerarin.,https://www.ncbi.nlm.nih.gov/pubmed/30626800,Biological & pharmaceutical bulletin,2019 03 04,"Puerarin (daidzein 8-C-glucoside) is an isoflavone C-glucoside contained in the roots of Pueraria lobata OHWI. We have previously isolated the human intestinal bacterium, strain PUE, which metabolizes puerarin to daidzein, though the enzyme which cleaves C-glycosidic bond has not been clarified. Here, we identified one of the intermediates of enzymatic puerarin C-deglycosylation reaction as 3″-oxo-puerarin (1): C-3 in the glucose moiety connecting to hydroxyl is oxidized to ketone group. 1 was easily isomerized to the mixture of 1, 2″-oxo-puerarin (2a) and cyclic acetal (2b) of 2a in non-enzymatic condition. We identified the putative puerarin-metabolizing operon of strain PUE composed of 8 genes (dgpA-H). Among them, DgpB-C complex was expressed in Escherichia coli, which cleaved the C-glycosidic bond in 1 but not puerarin. These results suggested that the puerarin C-deglycosylation reaction is a two-step enzymatic reaction, including the oxidation reaction at C-3″ in puerarin to give 1, and the subsequent C-deglycosylation of 1 to provide daidzein.",[Takotsubo cardiomyopathy developing during anagrelide therapy in a patient with essential thrombocythemia].,https://www.ncbi.nlm.nih.gov/pubmed/30626797,[Rinsho ketsueki] The Japanese journal of clinical hematology,2019 03 23,"A 76-year-old woman taking anagrelide (ANA) for essential thrombocythemia (ET) was rushed to the hospital by ambulance because of severe chest pain. Echocardiography revealed apical akinesis with basal and mid-hyperkinesis, and a coronary angiography revealed no significant stenosis in the dominant coronary artery. The patient was diagnosed with takotsubo cardiomyopathy (Tako). Tako is typically believed to be caused by stress; however, no stress was detected except that related to ANA therapy. ANA is useful in treating ET and is known to have severe cardiovascular effects. We must pay careful attention to Tako during ANA therapy."

Journal of the Food Hygienic Society of Japan,2019 05 13,"Chocolate and cocoa are manufactured from cacao beans produced by the cacao tree (Theobroma cacao). These products may contain cadmium (Cd), which originates from contaminated soil. Here, we surveyed the Cd concentrations in dark chocolate, milk chocolate, white chocolate and cocoa powder products purchased at retail stores in Japan, using inductively coupled plasma mass spectrometry. The Cd concentrations in these chocolate and cocoa powder products ranged from 0.00021 to 2.3 mg/kg and from 0.015 to 1.8 mg/kg, respectively. A weak positive correlation was found between the Cd concentration and the content of cocoa solids stated on the product labels. A comparison between these results and the maximum levels (MLs) set by the European Union revealed that the Cd concentrations in chocolate and cocoa powder products on the Japanese market exceeded the MLs for eight of the 180 chocolate products and 26 of the 140 cocoa powder products.",[Determination of Insect Order by Analyzing Mitochondrial Gene ND5].,https://www.ncbi.nlm.nih.gov/pubmed/30626783,Shokuhin eiseigaku zasshi.

Journal of the Food Hygienic Society of Japan,2019 05 13,"Hepatitis A virus (HAV) is a common infectious agent that causes acute hepatitis worldwide. Since the incubation period of HAV infection is about one month, it is difficult to identify the source of infection based only on medical interviews. Molecular epidemiological analysis of HAV isolated from patients can help to reveal the infection route and to identify diffuse outbreaks caused by common food vehicles. In the present study, samples were collected from 108 cases notified to the active epidemiological investigation system in Tokyo between 2016 and 2017. Samples found to be HAV-positive by semi-nested RT-PCR were subjected to sequencing and phylogenetic analysis; the results were analyzed together with the epidemiological data. HAV was detected in 99 out of 108 cases. Phylogenetic analysis showed that the 99 HAV strains were divided into 91 of genotype IA, two of IB, and six of IIIA. The 91 HAV strains typed as IA were further divided into four main line-ages, IA-1, IA-2, IA-3, and IA-4, each with a unique epidemiological background.

The current study aimed to determine biomarkers that might predict nephrotoxicity induced by CP using serum or urinary proton nuclear magnetic resonance (1H NMR) spectral data in male Sprague-Dawley (S-D) rats. CP (0, 0.5 or 5 mg/kg) was intraperitoneally (i.p.) administered for single dose. Animals were sacrificed 2 days (D2) or 8 days (D8) after administration of CP in order to perform analysis of serum biochemistries and histopathologic examination. Urine samples were collected every 24 hr from pre-treatment to sacrifice. Serum and urinary 1H NMR spectral data revealed apparent differential clustering between control and CP-treated groups as evidenced by principal component analysis (PCA) and orthogonal projections to latent structures-discriminant analysis (OPLS-DA) in global and targeted profiling. The concentrations of endogenous serum metabolites, alanine, betaine, glucose, glutamine, lactate, and leucine were significantly increased on D2. Urinary concentrations of alanine, glucose, glycine, guanidinoacetate, acetate, and lactate were significantly elevated on D2 or D8, whereas concentrations of urinary metabolites, citrate and hippurate were significantly decreased on D2 or D8. The correlation of serum and urinary 1H NMR OPLS-DA with serum biochemistry and renal histopathologic changes suggests that 1H NMR urinalysis may be used to reliably predict or screen CP-induced nephrotoxicity. Data suggest that these altered endogenous metabolites might serve as specific biomarkers for CP-induced nephrotoxicity.",Galectin-3 regulates chemotherapy sensitivity in epithelial ovarian carcinoma via regulating mitochondrial function.,https://www.ncbi.nlm.nih.gov/pubmed/30626779,The Journal of toxicological sciences,2019 01 24,"Galectin-3 (Gal-3) is a multifunctional carbohydrate-binding protein associated with cell migration, cell proliferation, cell adhesion, and cell-cell interaction in tumor cells. It has been implied to be involved in the tumor progression and chemoresistance of epithelial ovarian cancer (EOC). However, it is unclear whether the Gal-3-mediated regulation on the EOC chemosensitivity is associated with hypoxia or mitochondrial dysfunction. In the present study, we examined the regulation by Gal-3 overexpression on cisplatin-sensitivity or cisplatin-resistance in EOC cells in vitro. We manipulated Gal-3 via plasmid transfection and RNA interference in the cisplatin-resistant EOC cells, and re-evaluated the sensitivity of the cisplatin-resistant EOC cells to cisplatin, with CCK-8 assay, colony forming assay, apoptosis analysis and mitochondrial function examination. Results demonstrated that galectin-3 overexpression downregulated the cisplatin sensitivity in EOC OVCAR-3 cell clone, resulting in an upregulated growth and a reduced apoptosis in the cisplatin-treated OVCAR-3 cells. On the other hand, the Gal-3 knockdown with Gal-3-specific siRNA transfection aggravated cisplatin-induced apoptosis in OVCAR-3 cells. In conclusion, Galectin-3 reduces the sensitivity of ovarian cancer cells to cisplatin via regulating cisplatin-induced mitochondrial dysfunction. Galectin-3 knockdown inhibits the chemo-resistance of EOC cells. It implies that Galectin-3 might be a potential target to overcome the chemo-resistance in EOC cells.","Dermal exposure to nano-TiO2 induced cardiovascular toxicity through oxidative stress, inflammation and apoptosis.",https://www.ncbi.nlm.nih.gov/pubmed/30626778,The Journal of toxicological sciences,2019 01 24,"Due to its excellent properties such as ultraviolet obscuration, chemical stability and small particle size, nano-titanium dioxide (nano-TiO2) is widely used, particularly in sunblock products. The skin is therefore a chief route for exposure. Studies have found that oral or respiratory exposure to nano-TiO2 has an adverse impact on the cardiovascular system. The relationship between dermal exposure to nano-TiO2 and cardiovascular system toxicity, particularly the causative mechanisms, remain unclear. In this study, we used Balb/c mice to evaluate cardiovascular toxicity from nano-TiO2 dermal exposure, and the underlying mechanisms associated with the human umbilical vein endothelial cells (HUVECs) were explored. Our results showed that nano-TiO2 treatment resulted in an obvious increase in reactive oxygen species and 8-hydroxy-2'-deoxyguanosine, indicating the appearance of oxidative stress. Moreover, the levels of inflammatory biomarkers, such as immunoglobulin E, soluble intercellular adhesion molecule-1, interleukin-8, and hypersensitive C-reactive protein, also increased. Exposing HUVECs to nano-TiO2 led to a decline in cell vitality, and an increase in caspase-3 levels, suggesting that nano-TiO2 exposure caused cytotoxicity and even cell apoptosis. Interestingly, neutralizing oxidative stress by administering Vitamin E was shown to reduce the inflammatory response and cytotoxicity. Our findings suggest that nano-TiO2 can injure the cardiovascular system via dermal exposure, and does this via oxidative stress-induced inflammation and cytotoxicity. Vitamin E treatment may be a strategy to mitigate the damage.",The dermal sensitization threshold (DST) approach for mixtures evaluated as negative in in vitro test methods; mixture DST.,https://www.ncbi.nlm.nih.gov/pubmed/30626777,The Journal of toxicological sciences,2019 01 24,"Cosmetic ingredients often comprise complex mixtures, such as botanical extracts, which may contain skin sensitizing constituents. In our previous study for the sensitivity of the evaluations of skin sensitizing constituents in mixtures using the binary in vitro test battery with KeratinoSensTM and h-CLAT, some sensitizers showed higher detection limits in in vitro test methods than in murine local lymph node assays (LLNA). Thus, to minimize the uncertainty associated with decreased sensitivity for these sensitizers, a risk assessment strategy was developed for mixtures with negative results from the binary test battery. Assuming that the no expected sensitization induction level of mixtures (mixture NESIL) can be derived for mixtures with negative in vitro test results, we assessed 146 sensitizers with in vitro and LLNA data according to the assumption of indeterminate constituents in mixtures. Finally, we calculated 95th percentile probabilities of mixture NESILs and derived dermal sensitization thresholds for mixtures (mixture DST) with negative in vitro test results of 6010 μg/cm2. Feasibility studies indicated that this approach was practical for risk assessments of products in the cosmetic industry. This approach would be a novel risk assessment strategy for incorporating the DST approach and information from in vitro test methods.",Sensitivity of KeratinoSensTM and h-CLAT for detecting minute amounts of sensitizers to evaluate botanical extract.,https://www.ncbi.nlm.nih.gov/pubmed/30626776,The Journal of toxicological sciences,2019 01 24,"Cosmetic ingredients are often complex mixtures from natural sources such as botanical extracts that might contain minute amounts of constituents with sensitizing potential. The sensitivity of in vitro skin sensitization test methods such as KeratinoSensTM and h-CLAT for the detection of minute amounts of sensitizer in mixtures remains unclear. In this study, we assessed the detection sensitivity of the binary test battery comprising KeratinoSensTM and h-CLAT for minute amounts of sensitizers by comparing the LLNA EC3 (estimated concentration of a substance expected to produce a stimulation index of 3) values to the minimum detection concentrations (MDCs) exceeding the positive criteria for each of the two in vitro test methods. 146 sensitizers with both sets of in vitro data and LLNA data were used. MDC values for KeratinoSensTM and h-CLAT were calculated from exposure concentrations exceeding positive criteria for each in vitro test method (EC1.5 and minimum induction thresholds, respectively). The dilution rate used to expose culture medium was also considered. For 86% of analyzed sensitizers, the in vitro test methods showed MDC values lower than LLNA EC3 values, suggesting that the binary test battery with KeratinoSensTM and h-CLAT have greater sensitivity for detection of minute amounts of sensitizer than LLNA. These results suggest the high applicability of KeratinoSensTM and h-CLAT for detecting skin sensitizing constituents present in botanical extract."

Lymph node recurrence-free, distant recurrence-free and cause-specific survivals at 15-year of high-risk group were significantly poorer than those at 15-year of intermediate-group and these survivals of intermediate-group were poorer than of low- or very-low-risk patients. In the subset analyses based on patient age (≥55 years and <55 years), we obtained the same results in both subsets. Age significantly worsen the whole prognosis of high-risk patients and cause-specific survival of intermediate-risk patients, but not the prognosis of low- or very-low-risk patients.

We scanned images of grains in the core collection, which consists of 189 accessions of Triticum aestivum, T. spelta, T. compactum, T. sphaerococcum, T. macha and T. vavilovii. From the scanned images, we recorded six metric characters (area size, perimeter length, grain length, grain width, length to width ratio and circularity) using the software package SmartGrain ver. 1.2. Statistical analyses of the collected data along with hundred-grain weight revealed that T. aestivum has the largest diversity in grain morphology. Principal component analysis of these seven characters demonstrated that two principal components (PCcore1 and PCcore2) explain more than 96% of the variation in the core collection accessions. The correlation coefficients between the principal components and characters indicate that PCcore1 is related to grain size and PCcore2 to grain shape. From a genome-wide association study, we found a total of 15 significant marker-trait associations (MTAs) for grain morphological characters. More interestingly, we found mutually exclusive MTAs for PCcore1 and PCcore2 on 18 and 13 chromosomes, respectively. The results suggest that grain morphology in hexaploid wheat is determined by two factors, grain size and grain shape, which are under the control of multiple genetic loci.",Transcriptome network analysis identifies protective role of the LXR/SREBP-1c axis in murine pulmonary fibrosis.,https://www.ncbi.nlm.nih.gov/pubmed/30626759,JCI insight,2019 05 02,"Pulmonary fibrosis (PF) is an intractable disorder with a poor prognosis. Although lung fibroblasts play a central role in PF, the key regulatory molecules involved in this process remain unknown. To address this issue, we performed a time-course transcriptome analysis on lung fibroblasts of bleomycin- and silica-treated murine lungs. We found gene modules whose expression kinetics were associated with the progression of PF and human idiopathic PF (IPF). Upstream analysis of a transcriptome network helped in identifying 55 hub transcription factors that were highly connected with PF-associated gene modules. Of these hubs, the expression of Srebf1 decreased in line with progression of PF and human IPF, suggesting its suppressive role in fibroblast activation. Consistently, adoptive transfer and genetic modification studies revealed that the hub transcription factor SREBP-1c suppressed PF-associated gene expression changes in lung fibroblasts and PF pathology in vivo. Moreover, therapeutic pharmacological activation of LXR, an SREBP-1c activator, suppressed the Srebf1-dependent activation of fibroblasts and progression of PF. Thus, SREBP-1c acts as a protective hub of lung fibroblast activation in PF. Collectively, the findings of the current study may prove to be valuable in the development of effective therapeutic strategies for PF.",Metabolic and microstructural alterations in the SLE brain correlate with cognitive impairment.,https://www.ncbi.nlm.nih.gov/pubmed/30626758,JCI insight,2019 05 02,"To address challenges in the diagnosis of cognitive dysfunction (CD) related to systemic lupus erythematosus-associated (SLE-associated) autoimmune mechanisms rather than confounding factors, we employed an integrated approach, using resting-state functional (FDG-PET) and structural (diffusion tensor imaging [DTI]) neuroimaging techniques and cognitive testing, in adult SLE patients with quiescent disease and no history of neuropsychiatric illness. We identified resting hypermetabolism in the sensorimotor cortex, occipital lobe, and temporal lobe of SLE subjects, in addition to validation of previously published resting hypermetabolism in the hippocampus, orbitofrontal cortex, and putamen/GP/thalamus. Regional hypermetabolism demonstrated abnormal interregional metabolic correlations, associated with impaired cognitive performance, and was stable over 15 months. DTI analyses demonstrated 4 clusters of decreased microstructural integrity in white matter tracts adjacent to hypermetabolic regions and significantly diminished connecting tracts in SLE subjects. Decreased microstructural integrity in the parahippocampal gyrus correlated with impaired spatial memory and increased serum titers of DNRAb, a neurotoxic autoantibody associated with neuropsychiatric lupus. These findings of regional hypermetabolism, associated with decreased microstructural integrity and poor cognitive performance and not associated with disease duration, disease activity, medications, or comorbid disease, suggest that this is a reproducible, stable marker for SLE-associated CD that may be may be used for early disease detection and to discriminate between groups, evaluate response to treatment strategies, or assess disease progression.",Immune parameters and outcomes during Ebola virus disease.,https://www.ncbi.nlm.nih.gov/pubmed/30626757,JCI insight,2019 05 02,"The West African Ebola virus epidemic from 2014-2016 highlighted the lack of knowledge about the pathogenicity of the virus and the factors responsible for outcome.

Human kidney organoids derived from pluripotent stem cells (PSCs), a potentially new model for disease and regeneration, present an opportunity to explore the transcriptional plasticity of podocytes. Here, transcriptional profiling of more than 12,000 single cells from human PSC-derived kidney organoid cultures was used to identify robust and reproducible cell lineage gene expression signatures shared with developing human kidneys based on trajectory analysis. Surprisingly, the gene expression signature characteristic of developing glomerular epithelial cells was also observed in glomerular tissue from a kidney disease cohort. This signature correlated with proteinuria and inverse eGFR, and it was confirmed in an independent podocytopathy cohort. Three genes in particular were further characterized as potentially novel components of the glomerular disease signature. We conclude that cells in human PSC-derived kidney organoids reliably recapitulate the developmental transcriptional program of podocytes and other cell lineages in the human kidney and that transcriptional profiles seen in developing podocytes are reactivated in glomerular disease. Our findings demonstrate an approach to identifying potentially novel molecular programs involved in the pathogenesis of glomerulopathies.",Benign T cells drive clinical skin inflammation in cutaneous T cell lymphoma.,https://www.ncbi.nlm.nih.gov/pubmed/30626755,JCI insight,2019 05 03,"Psoralen plus UVA (PUVA) is an effective therapy for mycosis fungoides (MF), the skin-limited variant of cutaneous T cell lymphoma (CTCL). In low-burden patients, PUVA reduced or eradicated malignant T cells and induced clonal expansion of CD8+ T cells associated with malignant T cell depletion. High-burden patients appeared to clinically improve but large numbers of malignant T cells persisted in skin. Clinical improvement was linked to turnover of benign T cell clones but not to malignant T cell reduction. Benign T cells were associated with the Th2-recruiting chemokine CCL18 before therapy and with the Th1-recruiting chemokines CXCL9, CXCL10, and CXCL11 after therapy, suggesting a switch from Th2 to Th1. Inflammation was correlated with OX40L and CD40L gene expression; immunostaining localized these receptors to CCL18-expressing c-Kit+ dendritic cells that clustered together with CD40+OX40+ benign and CD40+CD40L+ malignant T cells, creating a proinflammatory synapse in skin. Our data suggest that visible inflammation in CTCL results from the recruitment and activation of benign T cells by c-Kit+OX40L+CD40L+ dendritic cells and that this activation may provide tumorigenic signals. Targeting c-Kit, OX40, and CD40 signaling may be novel therapeutic avenues for the treatment of MF.",Registration of the extracellular matrix components constituting the fibroblastic focus in idiopathic pulmonary fibrosis.,https://www.ncbi.nlm.nih.gov/pubmed/30626754,JCI insight,2019 05 03,"The extracellular matrix (ECM) in idiopathic pulmonary fibrosis (IPF) drives fibrosis progression; however, the ECM composition of the fibroblastic focus (the hallmark lesion in IPF) and adjacent regions remains incompletely defined.

Immunostained sections were imaged, anatomically aligned, and 3D reconstructed. The myofibroblast core of the fibroblastic focus (defined by collagen I, α-smooth muscle actin, and procollagen I immunoreactivity) was associated with collagens III, IV, V, and VI; fibronectin; hyaluronan; and versican immunoreactivity. Hyaluronan immunoreactivity was also present at the fibroblastic focus perimeter and at sites where early lesions appear to be forming. Fibrinogen immunoreactivity was often observed at regions of damaged epithelium lining the airspace and the perimeter of the myofibroblast core but was absent from the myofibroblast core itself. The ECM components of the fibroblastic focus were distributed in a characteristic and reproducible manner in multiple patients. This information can inform the development of high-fidelity model systems to dissect mechanisms by which the IPF ECM drives fibrosis progression.",Variations in HPV function are associated with survival in squamous cell carcinoma.,https://www.ncbi.nlm.nih.gov/pubmed/30626753,JCI insight,2019 05 03,"Incidence of HPV+ oropharyngeal squamous cell carcinoma (OPSCC) has been increasing dramatically. Although long-term survival rates for these patients are high, they often suffer from permanent radiotherapy-related morbidity. This has prompted the development of de-escalation clinical protocols to reduce morbidity. However, a subset of patients do not respond even to standard therapy and have poor outcomes. It is unclear how to properly identify and treat the high- and low-risk HPV+ OPSCC patients. Since HPV positivity drives radiotherapy sensitivity, we hypothesized that variations in HPV biology may cause differences in treatment response and outcome. By analyzing gene expression data, we identified variations in HPV-related molecules among HPV+ OPSCC. A subset of tumors presented a molecular profile distinct from that of typical HPV+ tumors and exhibited poor treatment response, indicating molecular and clinical similarities with HPV- tumors. These molecular changes were also observed in vitro and correlated with radiation sensitivity. Finally, we developed a prognostic biomarker signature for identification of this subgroup of HPV+ OPSCC and validated it in independent cohorts of oropharyngeal and cervical carcinomas. These findings could translate to improved patient stratification for treatment deintensification and new therapeutic approaches for treatment-resistant HPV-related cancer.",Cutaneous immune responses mediated by dendritic cells and mast cells.,https://www.ncbi.nlm.nih.gov/pubmed/30626752,JCI insight,2019 05 03,"In the skin, complex cellular networks maintain barrier function and immune homeostasis. Tightly regulated multicellular cascades are required to initiate innate and adaptive immune responses. Innate immune cells, particularly DCs and mast cells, are central to these networks. Early studies evaluated the function of these cells in isolation, but recent studies clearly demonstrate that cutaneous DCs (dermal DCs and Langerhans cells) physically interact with neighboring cells and are receptive to activation signals from surrounding cells, such as mast cells. These interactions amplify immune activation. In this review, we discuss the known functions of cutaneous DC populations and mast cells and recent studies highlighting their roles within cellular networks that determine cutaneous immune responses."

However, the link between mitochondrial dysfunction and inflammation in ALI is not well understood. In this report, we demonstrate a critical role for the mitochondrial NAD+-dependent deacetylase, sirtuin-3 (SIRT3), in regulating macrophage mitochondrial bioenergetics, ROS formation, and proinflammatory responses. We found that SIRT3 expression was significantly diminished in lungs of mice subjected to LPS-induced ALI. SIRT3-deficient mice (SIRT3-/-) develop more severe ALI compared with wild-type controls (SIRT3+/+). Macrophages obtained from SIRT3-/- mice show significant alterations in mitochondrial bioenergetic and redox homeostasis, in association with a proinflammatory phenotype characterized by NLRP3 inflammasome activation. The SIRT3 activator viniferin restored macrophage bioenergetic function in LPS-treated macrophages. Viniferin also reduced NLRP3 activation and the production of proinflammatory cytokines, effects that were absent in SIRT3-/- macrophages. In-vivo administration of viniferin reduced production of inflammatory mediators TNF-α, MIP-2, IL-6, IL-1β, and HMGB1, and diminished neutrophil influx and severity of endotoxin-mediated ALI; this protective effect of vinferin was abolished in SIRT3-/- mice. Taken together, our results show that the induction/activation of SIRT3 may serve as a new therapeutic strategy in ALI by modulating cellular bioenergetics, controlling inflammatory responses, and reducing the severity of lung injury.",Combined functional genomic and chemical screens identify SETD8 as a therapeutic target in MYC-driven medulloblastoma.,https://www.ncbi.nlm.nih.gov/pubmed/30626740,JCI insight,2019 05 03,"Medulloblastoma (MB) is the most prevalent malignant brain tumor in children, accounting for 20% of all childhood brain tumors. The molecular profiling of MB into 4 major subgroups (WNT, SHH, Grp3, and Grp4) emphasizes the heterogeneity of MB and opens paths in which treatments may be targeted to molecularly aggressive and distinct tumors. Current therapeutic strategies for Group 3 MB are challenging and can be accompanied by long-term side effects from treatment. The involvement of altered epigenetic machinery in neoplastic transformation in MB has become more evident. Thus, we performed an epigenomic RNAi and chemical screen and identified SETD8/PRE-SET7/KMT5a as a critical player in maintaining proliferation and cell survival of MB cells. We have found that inhibition of SETD8 effects the migration/invasive ability of MB cells. SETD8 alters H4K20me chromatin occupancy at key genes involved in tumor invasiveness and pluripotency. Interestingly, these results link the aggressive and metastatic behavior of MYC-driven MB with SETD8 activity. Based on our results, we suggest that SETD8 has a critical role mediating Group 3 MB tumorigenesis. Establishing a role for SETD8 as a factor in MYC-driven MB has potential to lead to more effective therapies needed to improve outcomes in high-risk patients.",Exercise promotes a cardioprotective gene program in resident cardiac fibroblasts.,https://www.ncbi.nlm.nih.gov/pubmed/30626739,JCI insight,2019 06 10,"Exercise and heart disease both induce cardiac remodeling, but only disease causes fibrosis and compromises heart function. The cardioprotective benefits of exercise have been attributed to changes in cardiomyocyte physiology, but the impact of exercise on cardiac fibroblasts (CFs) is unknown. Here, RNA-sequencing reveals rapid divergence of CF transcriptional programs during exercise and disease. Among the differentially expressed programs, NRF2-dependent antioxidant genes - including metallothioneins (Mt1 and Mt2) - are induced in CFs during exercise and suppressed by TGF-β/p38 signaling in disease. In vivo, mice lacking Mt1/2 exhibit signs of cardiac dysfunction in exercise, including cardiac fibrosis, vascular rarefaction, and functional decline. Mechanistically, exogenous MTs derived from fibroblasts are taken up by cultured cardiomyocytes, reducing oxidative damage-dependent cell death. Importantly, suppression of MT expression is conserved in human heart failure. Taken together, this study defines the acute transcriptional response of CFs to exercise and disease and reveals a cardioprotective mechanism that is lost in disease.",Human PAH is characterized by a pattern of lipid-related insulin resistance.,https://www.ncbi.nlm.nih.gov/pubmed/30626738,JCI insight,2019 05 03,"Pulmonary arterial hypertension (PAH) is a deadly disease of the small pulmonary vasculature with an increased prevalence of insulin resistance (IR).

The uncommon cancers are generally sporadic and there are no pre-defined techniques/tools for the diagnosis. Identifying the diseases at an early stage can avoid the cancerous cells from metastasis to different body parts through tissue, lymph system and blood. It is very difficult for the parents to know that the child is suffering from cancer until the cancer has reached to Stage 4. The duration it takes the cancer to reach Stage 4 can depend on many factors but the fact about childhood cancer is that it is curable to some extent. Diagnoses of the cancer at an early stage, i.e. at Stage 1, from childhood to old age can increase the survival rate of the patients by 85% and also helps to come up with certain therapy.",Biochemical characterization of the respiratory syncytial virus N0-P complex in solution.,https://www.ncbi.nlm.nih.gov/pubmed/30626736,The Journal of biological chemistry,2019 05 20,"As all the viruses belonging to the Mononegavirales order, the nonsegmented negative-strand RNA genome of respiratory syncytial virus (RSV) is encapsidated by the viral nucleoprotein N. N protein polymerizes along the genomic and anti-genomic RNAs during replication. This requires the maintenance of the neosynthesized N protein in a monomeric and RNA-free form by the viral phosphoprotein P that plays the role of a chaperone protein, forming a soluble N0-P complex. We have previously demonstrated that residues 1-30 of P specifically bind to N0 Here, to isolate a stable N0-P complex suitable for structural studies, we used the N-terminal peptide of P (P40) to purify truncated forms of the N protein. We show that to purify a stable N0-P-like complex, a deletion of the first 30 N-terminal residues of N (NΔ30) is required to impair N oligomerization, whereas the presence of a full-length C-arm of N is required to inhibit RNA binding. We generated structural models of the RSV N0-P with biophysical approaches, including hydrodynamic measurements and small-angle X-ray scattering (SAXS), coupled with biochemical and functional analyses of human RSV (hRSV) NΔ30 mutants. These models suggest a strong structural homology between the hRSV and the human metapneumovirus (hMPV) N0-P complexes. In both complexes, the P40-binding sites on N0 appear to be similar, and the C-arm of N provides a high flexibility and a propensity to interact with the N RNA groove. These findings reveal two potential sites to target on N0-P for the development of RSV antivirals.",Ctp1 protein-DNA filaments promote DNA bridging and DNA double-strand break repair.,https://www.ncbi.nlm.nih.gov/pubmed/30626735,The Journal of biological chemistry,2019 05 06,"The Ctp1 protein in Schizosaccharomyces pombe is essential for DNA double-strand break (DSB) repair by homologous recombination. Fission yeast Ctp1 and its budding yeast (Sae2) and human (CtIP) homologs control Mre11-Rad50-Nbs1 nuclease complex activity and harbor DNA-binding and -bridging activities. However, the molecular basis for Ctp1-DNA transactions remains undefined. Here, we report atomic force microscopy (AFM) imaging of S. pombe Ctp1-DNA complexes revealing that Ctp1 polymerizes on dsDNA molecules and forms synaptic filaments that bridge two dsDNA strands. We observed that Ctp1 DNA filaments are typified by an average filament length of ∼180 bp of dsDNA and a Ctp1 tetramer footprint of ∼15 bp. Biochemical results characterizing Ctp1 variants with impaired DNA-binding or -bridging properties were consistent with Ctp1-mediated DNA bridging requiring the intact and correctly folded Ctp1 tetramer. Furthermore, mutations altering Ctp1 oligomerization and DNA bridging in vitro conferred cell sensitivity to DSB-producing agents. Together, these results support an important role for Ctp1-regulated DNA strand coordination required for DNA DSB repair in S. pombe.",Nutrient regulation of signaling and transcription.,https://www.ncbi.nlm.nih.gov/pubmed/30626734,The Journal of biological chemistry,2019 04 29,"In the early 1980s, while using purified glycosyltransferases to probe glycan structures on surfaces of living cells in the murine immune system, we discovered a novel form of serine/threonine protein glycosylation (O-linked β-GlcNAc; O-GlcNAc) that occurs on thousands of proteins within the nucleus, cytoplasm, and mitochondria. Prior to this discovery, it was dogma that protein glycosylation was restricted to the luminal compartments of the secretory pathway and on extracellular domains of membrane and secretory proteins. Work in the last 3 decades from several laboratories has shown that O-GlcNAc cycling serves as a nutrient sensor to regulate signaling, transcription, mitochondrial activity, and cytoskeletal functions. O-GlcNAc also has extensive cross-talk with phosphorylation, not only at the same or proximal sites on polypeptides, but also by regulating each other's enzymes that catalyze cycling of the modifications. O-GlcNAc is generally not elongated or modified. It cycles on and off polypeptides in a time scale similar to phosphorylation, and both the enzyme that adds O-GlcNAc, the O-GlcNAc transferase (OGT), and the enzyme that removes O-GlcNAc, O-GlcNAcase (OGA), are highly conserved from C. elegans to humans. Both O-GlcNAc cycling enzymes are essential in mammals and plants. Due to O-GlcNAc's fundamental roles as a nutrient and stress sensor, it plays an important role in the etiologies of chronic diseases of aging, including diabetes, cancer, and neurodegenerative disease. This review will present an overview of our current understanding of O-GlcNAc's regulation, functions, and roles in chronic diseases of aging.",Molecular chaperones and protein quality control: an introduction to the JBC Reviews thematic series.,https://www.ncbi.nlm.nih.gov/pubmed/30626733,The Journal of biological chemistry,2019 04 22,"Protein folding is a spontaneous process. However, under physiological conditions, proteins are inherently unstable, and the protein concentrations in living cells favor unspecific interactions between partially folded proteins. Thus, the cellular proteome requires the assistance of helper factors, the molecular chaperones, for quality control and the maintenance of protein homeostasis. This series of reviews delves into how these molecular machines work in the eukaryotic cell, how they convey resilience to life, how these functions have allowed expansion of the protein universe, and how we can target them for therapeutic purposes. Together, they present the progress made in recent years in our understanding of one of the most fundamental aspects of life.",The microRNAs let-7 and miR-9 down-regulate the axon-guidance genes Ntn1 and Dcc during peripheral nerve regeneration.,https://www.ncbi.nlm.nih.gov/pubmed/30626732,The Journal of biological chemistry,2019 05 20,"Axon guidance helps growing neural axons to follow precise paths to reach their target locations. It is a critical step for both the formation and regeneration of neuronal circuitry. Netrin-1 (Ntn1) and its receptor, deleted in colorectal carcinoma (Dcc) are essential factors for axon guidance, but their regulation in this process is incompletely understood. In this study, using quantitative real-time RT-PCR (qRT-PCR) and biochemical and reporter gene assays, we found that the Ntn1 and Dcc genes are both robustly up-regulated in the sciatic nerve stump after peripheral nerve injury. Moreover, we found that the microRNA (miR) let-7 directly targets the Ntn1 transcript by binding to its 3'-untranslated region (3'-UTR), represses Ntn1 expression, and reduces the secretion of Ntn1 protein in Schwann cells. We also identified miR-9 as the regulatory miRNA that directly targets Dcc and found that miR-9 down-regulates Dcc expression and suppresses the migration ability of Schwann cells by regulating Dcc abundance. Functional examination in dorsal root ganglion neurons disclosed that let-7 and miR-9 decrease the protein levels of Ntn1 and Dcc in these neurons, respectively, and reduce axon outgrowth. Moreover, we identified a potential regulatory network comprising let-7, miR-9, Ntn1, Dcc, and related molecules, including the RNA-binding protein Lin-28 homolog A (Lin28), SRC proto-oncogene nonreceptor tyrosine kinase (Src), and the transcription factor NF-κB. In summary, our findings reveal that the miRs let-7 and miR-9 are involved in regulating neuron pathfinding and extend our understanding of the regulatory pathways active during peripheral nerve regeneration."

In Drosophila, this pattern is established in embryonic myotubes, where myonuclei move via microtubules (MTs) and the MT-associated protein Ensconsin (Ens)/MAP7, to achieve their distribution. Ens regulates multiple aspects of MT biology, but little is known about how Ens itself is regulated. We find that Ens physically interacts and colocalizes with Bsg25D, the Drosophila homologue of the centrosomal protein Ninein. Bsg25D loss enhances myonuclear positioning defects in embryos sensitized by partial Ens loss. Bsg25D overexpression causes severe positioning defects in immature myotubes and fully differentiated myofibers, where it forms ectopic MT organizing centers, disrupts perinuclear MT arrays, reduces muscle stiffness, and decreases larval crawling velocity. These studies define a novel relationship between Ens and Bsg25D. At endogenous levels, Bsg25D positively regulates Ens activity during myonuclear positioning, but excess Bsg25D disrupts Ens localization and MT organization, with disastrous consequences for myonuclear positioning and muscle function.",Opioid overdose detection using smartphones.,https://www.ncbi.nlm.nih.gov/pubmed/30626717,Science translational medicine,2019 01 10,"Early detection and rapid intervention can prevent death from opioid overdose. At high doses, opioids (particularly fentanyl) can cause rapid cessation of breathing (apnea), hypoxemic/hypercarbic respiratory failure, and death, the physiologic sequence by which people commonly succumb from unintentional opioid overdose. We present algorithms that run on smartphones and unobtrusively detect opioid overdose events and their precursors. Our proof-of- concept contactless system converts the phone into a short-range active sonar using frequency shifts to identify respiratory depression, apnea, and gross motor movements associated with acute opioid toxicity. We develop algorithms and perform testing in two environments: (i) an approved supervised injection facility (SIF), where people self-inject illicit opioids, and (ii) the operating room (OR), where we simulate rapid, opioid-induced overdose events using routine induction of general anesthesia. In the SIF (n = 209), our system identified postinjection, opioid-induced central apnea with 96% sensitivity and 98% specificity and identified respiratory depression with 87% sensitivity and 89% specificity. These two key events commonly precede fatal opioid overdose. In the OR, our algorithm identified 19 of 20 simulated overdose events. Given the reliable reversibility of acute opioid toxicity, smartphone-enabled overdose detection coupled with the ability to alert naloxone-equipped friends and family or emergency medical services (EMS) could hold potential as a low-barrier, harm reduction intervention.",Loss of HDAC3 results in nonreceptive endometrium and female infertility.,https://www.ncbi.nlm.nih.gov/pubmed/30626716,Science translational medicine,2019 06 10,"Endometriosis is a disease in which tissue that normally grows inside the uterus grows outside the uterus and causes chronic pelvic pain and infertility. However, the exact mechanisms of the pathogenesis of endometriosis-associated infertility are unknown. Epigenetic dysregulation has recently been implicated in infertility. Here, we report a reduction of histone deacetylase 3 (HDAC3) protein amounts in eutopic endometrium of infertile women with endometriosis compared to a control group. To investigate the effect of HDAC3 loss in the uterus, we generated mice with conditional ablation of Hdac3 in progesterone receptor (PGR)-positive cells (Pgrcre/+Hdac3f/f ; Hdac3d/d ). Loss of Hdac3 in the uterus of mice results in infertility due to implantation failure and decidualization defect. Expression microarray and ChIP-seq analyses identified COL1A1 and COL1A2 as direct targets of HDAC3 in both mice and humans. Reduction of HDAC3 abrogated decidualization in a primary culture of human endometrial stromal cells (hESCs) similar to that observed in infertile patients with endometriosis. Whereas attenuation of HDAC3 resulted in p300 recruitment to Col1a1 and Col1a2 genes in the uterus of mice as well as hESCs, inhibition of p300 permitted hESCs to undergo decidualization. Collectively, we found attenuation of HDAC3 and overexpression of collagen type I in the eutopic endometrium of infertile patients with endometriosis. HDAC3 loss caused a defect of decidualization through the aberrant transcriptional activation of Col1a1 and Col1a2 genes in mice and COL1A1 and COL1A2 genes in humans. Our results suggest that HDAC3 is critical for endometrial receptivity and decidualization.",Reduced non-rapid eye movement sleep is associated with tau pathology in early Alzheimer's disease.,https://www.ncbi.nlm.nih.gov/pubmed/30626715,Science translational medicine,2019 04 02,"In Alzheimer's disease (AD), deposition of insoluble amyloid-β (Aβ) is followed by intracellular aggregation of tau in the neocortex and subsequent neuronal cell loss, synaptic loss, brain atrophy, and cognitive impairment. By the time even the earliest clinical symptoms are detectable, Aβ accumulation is close to reaching its peak and neocortical tau pathology is frequently already present. The period in which AD pathology is accumulating in the absence of cognitive symptoms represents a clinically relevant time window for therapeutic intervention. Sleep is increasingly recognized as a potential marker for AD pathology and future risk of cognitive impairment. Previous studies in animal models and humans have associated decreased non-rapid eye movement (NREM) sleep slow wave activity (SWA) with Aβ deposition. In this study, we analyzed cognitive performance, brain imaging, and cerebrospinal fluid (CSF) AD biomarkers in participants enrolled in longitudinal studies of aging. In addition, we monitored their sleep using a single-channel electroencephalography (EEG) device worn on the forehead. After adjusting for multiple covariates such as age and sex, we found that NREM SWA showed an inverse relationship with AD pathology, particularly tauopathy, and that this association was most evident at the lowest frequencies of NREM SWA. Given that our study participants were predominantly cognitively normal, this suggested that changes in NREM SWA, especially at 1 to 2 Hz, might be able to discriminate tau pathology and cognitive impairment either before or at the earliest stages of symptomatic AD.",Autologous tumor cell-derived microparticle-based targeted chemotherapy in lung cancer patients with malignant pleural effusion.,https://www.ncbi.nlm.nih.gov/pubmed/30626714,Science translational medicine,2019 01 10,"Cell membrane-derived microparticles (MPs), the critical mediators of intercellular communication, have gained much interest for use as natural drug delivery systems. Here, we examined the therapeutic potential of tumor cell-derived MPs (TMPs) in the context of malignant pleural effusion (MPE). TMPs packaging the chemotherapeutic drug methotrexate (TMPs-MTX) markedly restricted MPE growth and provided a survival benefit in MPE models induced by murine Lewis lung carcinoma and colon adenocarcinoma cells. On the basis of the potential benefit and minimal toxicity of TMPs-MTX, we conducted a human study of intrapleural delivery of a single dose of autologous TMPs packaging methotrexate (ATMPs-MTX) to assess their safety, immunogenicity, and clinical activity. We report our findings on 11 advanced lung cancer patients with MPE. We found that manufacturing and infusing ATMPs-MTX were feasible and safe, without evidence of toxic effects of grade 3 or higher. Evaluation of the tumor microenvironment in MPE demonstrated notable reductions in tumor cells and CD163+ macrophages in MPE after ATMP-MTX infusion, which then translated into objective clinical responses. Moreover, ATMP-MTX treatment stimulated CD4+ T cells to release IL-2 and CD8+ cells to release IFN-γ. Our initial experience with ATMPs-MTX in advanced lung cancer with MPE suggests that ATMPs targeting malignant cells and the immunosuppressive microenvironment may be a promising therapeutic platform for treating malignancies.",Challenges and strategies for developing efficacious and long-lasting malaria vaccines.,https://www.ncbi.nlm.nih.gov/pubmed/30626712,Science translational medicine,2019 01 10,"Although there has been major recent progress in malaria vaccine development, substantial challenges remain for achieving highly efficacious and durable vaccines against Plasmodium falciparum and Plasmodium vivax malaria.

It divides asymmetrically, giving a stalked cell that immediately enters S phase and a swarmer cell that stays in the G1 phase until it differentiates into a stalked cell. Its genome consists in a single circular chromosome whose replication is tightly regulated so that it happens only in stalked cells and only once per cell cycle. Imbalances in chromosomal copy numbers are the most often highly deleterious, if not lethal. This review highlights recent discoveries on pathways that control chromosome replication when Caulobacter is exposed to optimal or less optimal growth conditions. Most of these pathways target two proteins that bind directly onto the chromosomal origin: the highly conserved DnaA initiator of DNA replication and the CtrA response regulator that is found in most Alphaproteobacteria The concerted inactivation and proteolysis of CtrA during the swarmer-to-stalked cell transition license cells to enter S phase, while a replisome-associated Regulated Inactivation and proteolysis of DnaA (RIDA) process ensures that initiation starts only once per cell cycle.

Ghrelin octanoylation is catalyzed by ghrelin O-acyltransferase (GOAT), a member of the membrane-bound O-acyltransferase (MBOAT) enzyme family. From the status of ghrelin as the only substrate for GOAT in the human genome to the source and requirement for the octanoyl acyl donor, the ghrelin-GOAT system is defined by multiple unique aspects within both protein biochemistry and endocrinology.

Biochemical isolation of Pyk2-interacting proteins from brain identifies Graf1c, a RhoA GTPase-activating protein inhibited by Pyk2. Aβo-induced reductions in dendritic spine motility and chronic spine loss require both Pyk2 kinase and RhoA activation. Thus, Pyk2 functions at postsynaptic sites to modulate F-actin control by RhoA and regulate synapse maintenance of relevance to AD risk.SIGNIFICANCE STATEMENT Genetic variation at the Pyk2 locus is a risk for Alzheimer's disease. We have observed that Pyk2 is required for AD transgenic synapse loss and memory dysfunction. However, the cellular and biochemical basis for Pyk2 function related to AD is not defined. Here, we show that brain Pyk2 interacts with the RhoGAP protein Graf1 to alter dendritic spine stability via RhoA GTPase. Amyloid-β oligomer-induced dendritic spine loss requires the Pyk2/Graf1 pathway.",Signaling Incentive and Drive in the Primate Ventral Pallidum for Motivational Control of Goal-Directed Action.,https://www.ncbi.nlm.nih.gov/pubmed/30626695,The Journal of neuroscience : the official journal of the Society for Neuroscience,2019 03 10,"Processing incentive and drive is essential for control of goal-directed behavior. The limbic part of the basal ganglia has been emphasized in these processes, yet the exact neuronal mechanism has remained elusive. In this study, we examined the neuronal activity of the ventral pallidum (VP) and its upstream area, the rostromedial caudate (rmCD), while two male macaque monkeys performed an instrumental lever release task in which a visual cue indicated the forthcoming reward size. We found that the activity of some neurons in VP and rmCD reflected the expected reward size transiently following the cue. Reward size coding appeared earlier and stronger in VP than in rmCD. We also found that the activity in these areas was modulated by the satiation level of monkeys, which also occurred more frequently in VP than in rmCD. The information regarding reward size and satiation level was independently signaled in the neuronal populations of these areas. The data thus highlighted the neuronal coding of key variables for goal-directed behavior in VP. Furthermore, pharmacological inactivation of VP induced more severe deficit of goal-directed behavior than inactivation of rmCD, which was indicated by abnormal error repetition and diminished satiation effect on the performance. These results suggest that VP encodes incentive value and internal drive and plays a pivotal role in the control of motivation to promote goal-directed behavior.SIGNIFICANCE STATEMENT The limbic part of the basal ganglia has been implicated in the motivational control of goal-directed action. Here, we investigated how the ventral pallidum (VP) and the rostromedial caudate (rmCD) encode incentive value and internal drive and control goal-directed behavior. Neuronal recording and subsequent pharmacological inactivation revealed that VP had stronger coding of reward size and satiation level than rmCD. Reward size and satiation level were independently encoded in the neuronal population of these areas. Furthermore, VP inactivation impaired goal-directed behavior more severely than rmCD inactivation. These results highlight the central role of VP in the motivational control of goal-directed action.",Cutting Edge: HDAC3 Protects Double-Positive Thymocytes from P2X7 Receptor-Induced Cell Death.,https://www.ncbi.nlm.nih.gov/pubmed/30626694,"Journal of immunology (Baltimore, Md. : 1950)",2019 02 07,"Intricate life-versus-death decisions are programmed during T cell development, and the regulatory mechanisms that coordinate their activation and repression are still under investigation. In this study, HDAC3-deficient double-positive (DP) thymocytes exhibit a severe decrease in numbers. The thymic cortex is rich in ATP, which is released by macrophages that clear apoptotic DP thymocytes that fail to undergo positive selection. We demonstrate that HDAC3 is required to repress expression of the purinergic receptor P2X7 to prevent DP cell death. HDAC3-deficient DP thymocytes upregulate the P2X7 receptor, increasing sensitivity to ATP-induced cell death. P2rx7/HDAC3-double knockout mice show a partial rescue in DP cell number. HDAC3 directly binds to the P2rx7 enhancer, which is hyperacetylated in the absence of HDAC3. In addition, RORγt binds to the P2rx7 enhancer and promotes P2X7 receptor expression in the absence of HDAC3. Therefore, HDAC3 is a critical regulator of DP thymocyte survival and is required to suppress P2X7 receptor expression.",Compartmentalized Response of IL-6/STAT3 Signaling in the Colonic Mucosa Mediates Colitis Development.,https://www.ncbi.nlm.nih.gov/pubmed/30626693,"Journal of immunology (Baltimore, Md. : 1950)",2019 02 05,"A single layer of polarized epithelial cells lining the colonic mucosa create a semipermeable barrier indispensable for gut homeostasis. The role of intestinal epithelial cell (IEC) polarization in the maintenance of the epithelial homeostasis and in the development of inflammatory bowel diseases is not fully understood. In this review, now we report that IEC polarization plays an essential role in the regulation of IL-6/STAT3 signaling in the colonic mucosa. Our results demonstrate that autocrine STAT3 activation in IECs is mediated by the apical secretion of IL-6 in response to the basolateral stimulation with IFN-γ. This process relies on the presence of functional, IFN-γ-producing CD4+ T cells. In the absence of basolateral IFN-γ, the compartmentalization of the IL-6/STAT3 signaling is disrupted, and STAT3 is activated mainly in macrophages. Thus, in this study, we show that during inflammation, IFN-γ regulates IL-6/STAT3 signaling in IEC in the colonic mucosa.",Characterization of Subpopulations of Chicken Mononuclear Phagocytes That Express TIM4 and CSF1R.,https://www.ncbi.nlm.nih.gov/pubmed/30626692,"Journal of immunology (Baltimore, Md. : 1950)",2019 03 29,"The phosphatidylserine receptor TIM4, encoded by TIMD4, mediates the phagocytic uptake of apoptotic cells. We applied anti-chicken TIM4 mAbs in combination with CSF1R reporter transgenes to dissect the function of TIM4 in the chick (Gallus gallus). During development in ovo, TIM4 was present on the large majority of macrophages, but expression became more heterogeneous posthatch. Blood monocytes expressed KUL01, class II MHC, and CSF1R-mApple uniformly. Around 50% of monocytes were positive for surface TIM4. They also expressed many other monocyte-specific transcripts at a higher level than TIM4- monocytes. In liver, highly phagocytic TIM4hi cells shared many transcripts with mammalian Kupffer cells and were associated with uptake of apoptotic cells. Although they expressed CSF1R mRNA, Kupffer cells did not express the CSF1R-mApple transgene, suggesting that additional CSF1R transcriptional regulatory elements are required by these cells. By contrast, CSF1R-mApple was detected in liver TIM4lo and TIM4- cells, which were not phagocytic and were more abundant than Kupffer cells. These cells expressed CSF1R alongside high levels of FLT3, MHCII, XCR1, and other markers associated with conventional dendritic cells in mice. In bursa, TIM4 was present on the cell surface of two populations. Like Kupffer cells, bursal TIM4hi phagocytes coexpressed many receptors involved in apoptotic cell recognition. TIM4lo cells appear to be a subpopulation of bursal B cells. In overview, TIM4 is associated with phagocytes that eliminate apoptotic cells in the chick. In the liver, TIM4 and CSF1R reporters distinguished Kupffer cells from an abundant population of dendritic cell-like cells.",Histone H3K27 Demethylase Negatively Controls the Memory Formation of Antigen-Stimulated CD8+ T Cells.,https://www.ncbi.nlm.nih.gov/pubmed/30626691,"Journal of immunology (Baltimore, Md. : 1950)",2019 02 05,"Although the methylation status of histone H3K27 plays a critical role in CD4+ T cell differentiation and its function, the role of Utx histone H3K27 demethylase in the CD8+ T cell-dependent immune response remains unclear. We therefore generated T cell-specific Utxflox/flox Cd4-Cre Tg (Utx KO) mice to determine the role of Utx in CD8+ T cells. Wild-type (WT) and Utx KO mice were infected with Listeria monocytogenes expressing OVA to analyze the immune response of Ag-specific CD8+ T cells. There was no significant difference in the number of Ag-specific CD8+ T cells upon primary infection between WT and Utx KO mice. However, Utx deficiency resulted in more Ag-specific CD8+ T cells upon secondary infection. Adoptive transfer of Utx KO CD8+ T cells resulted in a larger number of memory cells in the primary response than in WT. We observed a decreased gene expression of effector-associated transcription factors, including Prdm1 encoding Blimp1, in Utx KO CD8+ T cells. We confirmed that the trimethylation level of histone H3K27 in the Prdm1 gene loci in the Utx KO cells was higher than in the WT cells. The treatment of CD8+ T cells with Utx-cofactor α-ketoglutarate hampered the memory formation, whereas Utx inhibitor GSK-J4 enhanced the memory formation in WT CD8+ T cells. These data suggest that Utx negatively controls the memory formation of Ag-stimulated CD8+ T cells by epigenetically regulating the gene expression. Based on these findings, we identified a critical link between Utx and the differentiation of Ag-stimulated CD8+ T cells.",TMPRSS2 Contributes to Virus Spread and Immunopathology in the Airways of Murine Models after Coronavirus Infection.,https://www.ncbi.nlm.nih.gov/pubmed/30626688,Journal of virology,2019 03 06,"Transmembrane serine protease TMPRSS2 activates the spike protein of highly pathogenic human coronaviruses such as severe acute respiratory syndrome-related coronavirus (SARS-CoV) and Middle East respiratory syndrome-related coronavirus (MERS-CoV). In vitro, activation induces virus-cell membrane fusion at the cell surface. However, the roles of TMPRSS2 during coronavirus infection in vivo are unclear. Here, we used animal models of SARS-CoV and MERS-CoV infection to investigate the role of TMPRSS2. Th1-prone C57BL/6 mice and TMPRSS2-knockout (KO) mice were used for SARS-CoV infection, and transgenic mice expressing the human MERS-CoV receptor DPP4 (hDPP4-Tg mice) and TMPRSS2-KO hDPP4-Tg mice were used for MERS-CoV infection. After experimental infection, TMPRSS2-deficient mouse strains showed reduced body weight loss and viral kinetics in the lungs. Lack of TMPRSS2 affected the primary sites of infection and virus spread within the airway, accompanied by less severe immunopathology. However, TMPRSS2-KO mice showed weakened inflammatory chemokine and/or cytokine responses to intranasal stimulation with poly(I·C), a Toll-like receptor 3 agonist. In conclusion, TMPRSS2 plays a crucial role in viral spread within the airway of murine models infected by SARS-CoV and MERS-CoV and in the resulting immunopathology.IMPORTANCE Broad-spectrum antiviral drugs against highly pathogenic coronaviruses and other emerging viruses are desirable to enable a rapid response to pandemic threats. Transmembrane protease serine type 2 (TMPRSS2), a protease belonging to the type II transmembrane serine protease family, cleaves the coronavirus spike protein, making it a potential therapeutic target for coronavirus infections. Here, we examined the role of TMPRSS2 using animal models of SARS-CoV and MERS-CoV infection. The results suggest that lack of TMPRSS2 in the airways reduces the severity of lung pathology after infection by SARS-CoV and MERS-CoV. Taken together, the results will facilitate development of novel targets for coronavirus therapy.",Infectious Entry of Merkel Cell Polyomavirus.,https://www.ncbi.nlm.nih.gov/pubmed/30626687,Journal of virology,2019 03 29,"Merkel cell polyomavirus (MCPyV) is a small, nonenveloped tumor virus associated with an aggressive form of skin cancer, Merkel cell carcinoma (MCC). MCPyV infections are highly prevalent in the human population, with MCPyV virions being continuously shed from human skin. However, the precise host cell tropism(s) of MCPyV remains unclear: MCPyV is able to replicate within a subset of dermal fibroblasts, but MCPyV DNA has also been detected in a variety of other tissues. However, MCPyV appears different from other polyomaviruses, as it requires sulfated polysaccharides, such as heparan sulfates and/or chondroitin sulfates, for initial attachment. Like other polyomaviruses, MCPyV engages sialic acid as a (co)receptor. To explore the infectious entry process of MCPyV, we analyzed the cell biological determinants of MCPyV entry into A549 cells, a highly transducible lung carcinoma cell line, in comparison to well-studied simian virus 40 and a number of other viruses. Our results indicate that MCPyV enters cells via caveolar/lipid raft-mediated endocytosis but not macropinocytosis, clathrin-mediated endocytosis, or glycosphingolipid-enriched carriers. The viruses were internalized in small endocytic pits that led the virus to endosomes and from there to the endoplasmic reticulum (ER). Similar to other polyomaviruses, trafficking required microtubular transport, acidification of endosomes, and a functional redox environment. To our surprise, the virus was found to acquire a membrane envelope within endosomes, a phenomenon not reported for other viruses. Only minor amounts of viruses reached the ER, while the majority was retained in endosomal compartments, suggesting that endosome-to-ER trafficking is a bottleneck during infectious entry.IMPORTANCE MCPyV is the first polyomavirus directly implicated in the development of an aggressive human cancer, Merkel cell carcinoma (MCC). Although MCPyV is constantly shed from healthy skin, the MCC incidence increases among aging and immunocompromised individuals. To date, the events connecting initial MCPyV infection and subsequent transformation still remain elusive. MCPyV differs from other known polyomaviruses concerning its cell tropism, entry receptor requirements, and infection kinetics. In this study, we examined the cellular requirements for endocytic entry as well as the subcellular localization of incoming virus particles. A thorough understanding of the determinants of the infectious entry pathway and the specific biological niche will benefit prevention of virus-derived cancers such as MCC.","Viral Replicative Capacity, Antigen Availability via Hematogenous Spread, and High TFH:TFR Ratios Drive Induction of Potent Neutralizing Antibody Responses.",https://www.ncbi.nlm.nih.gov/pubmed/30626686,Journal of virology,2019 03 29,"Live viral vaccines elicit protective, long-lived humoral immunity, but the underlying mechanisms through which this occurs are not fully elucidated. Generation of affinity matured, long-lived protective antibody responses involve close interactions between T follicular helper (TFH) cells, germinal center (GC) B cells, and T follicular regulatory (TFR) cells. We postulated that escalating concentrations of antigens from replicating viruses or live vaccines, spread through the hematogenous route, are essential for the induction and maintenance of long-lived protective antibody responses. Using replicating and poorly replicating or nonreplicating orthopox and influenza A viruses, we show that the magnitude of TFH cell, GC B cell, and neutralizing antibody responses is directly related to virus replicative capacity. Further, we have identified that both lymphoid and circulating TFH:TFR cell ratios during the peak GC response can be used as an early predictor of protective, long-lived antibody response induction. Finally, administration of poorly or nonreplicating viruses to allow hematogenous spread generates significantly stronger TFH:TFR ratios and robust TFH, GC B cell and neutralizing antibody responses.IMPORTANCE Neutralizing antibody response is the best-known correlate of long-term protective immunity for most of the currently licensed clinically effective viral vaccines. However, the host immune and viral factors that are critical for the induction of robust and durable antiviral humoral immune responses are not well understood. Our study provides insight into the dynamics of key cellular mediators of germinal center reaction during live virus infections and the influence of viral replicative capacity on the magnitude of antiviral antibody response and effector function. The significance of our study lies in two key findings. First, the systemic spread of even poorly replicating or nonreplicating viruses to mimic the spread of antigens from replicating viruses due to escalating antigen concentration is fundamental to the induction of durable antibody responses. Second, the TFH:TFR ratio may be used as an early predictor of protective antiviral humoral immune responses long before memory responses are generated.",Acute Respiratory Infection in Human Dipeptidyl Peptidase 4-Transgenic Mice Infected with Middle East Respiratory Syndrome Coronavirus.,https://www.ncbi.nlm.nih.gov/pubmed/30626685,Journal of virology,2019 03 29,"Middle East respiratory syndrome coronavirus (MERS-CoV) infection can manifest as a mild illness, acute respiratory distress, organ failure, or death. Several animal models have been established to study disease pathogenesis and to develop vaccines and therapeutic agents. Here, we developed transgenic (Tg) mice on a C57BL/6 background; these mice expressed human CD26/dipeptidyl peptidase 4 (hDPP4), a functional receptor for MERS-CoV, under the control of an endogenous hDPP4 promoter. We then characterized this mouse model of MERS-CoV. The expression profile of hDPP4 in these mice was almost equivalent to that in human tissues, including kidney and lung; however, hDPP4 was overexpressed in murine CD3-positive cells within peripheral blood and lymphoid tissues. Intranasal inoculation of young and adult Tg mice with MERS-CoV led to infection of the lower respiratory tract and pathological evidence of acute multifocal interstitial pneumonia within 7 days, with only transient loss of body weight. However, the immunopathology in young and adult Tg mice was different. On day 5 or 7 postinoculation, lungs of adult Tg mice contained higher levels of proinflammatory cytokines and chemokines associated with migration of macrophages. These results suggest that the immunopathology of MERS-CoV infection in the Tg mouse is age dependent. The mouse model described here will increase our understanding of disease pathogenesis and host mediators that protect against MERS-CoV infection.IMPORTANCE Middle East respiratory syndrome coronavirus (MERS-CoV) infections are endemic in the Middle East and a threat to public health worldwide. Rodents are not susceptible to the virus because they do not express functional receptors; therefore, we generated a new animal model of MERS-CoV infection based on transgenic mice expressing human DPP4 (hDPP4). The pattern of hDPP4 expression in this model was similar to that in human tissues (except lymphoid tissue). In addition, MERS-CoV was limited to the respiratory tract. Here, we focused on host factors involved in immunopathology in MERS-CoV infection and clarified differences in antiviral immune responses between young and adult transgenic mice. This new small-animal model could contribute to more in-depth study of the pathology of MERS-CoV infection and aid development of suitable treatments."

Three rice planthoppers, Laodelphax striatellus, Nilaparvata lugens, and Sogatella furcifera, are agriculturally important insects because they are destructive rice pests and also the vector of a number of phytopathogenic viruses. In this study, we discovered that a small region (∼300 nucleotides [nt]) of the genome of invertebrate iridescent virus 6 (IIV-6; genus Iridovirus, family Iridoviridae), a giant DNA virus that infects invertebrates but is not known to infect planthoppers, is highly homologous to the sequences present in high copy numbers in these three planthopper genomes. These sequences are related to the short interspersed nuclear elements (SINEs), a class of non-long terminal repeat (LTR) retrotransposons (retroposons), suggesting a horizontal transfer event of a transposable element from the rice planthopper genome to the IIV-6 genome. In addition, a number of planthopper transcripts mapped to these rice planthopper SINE-like sequences (RPSlSs) were identified and appear to be transcriptionally regulated along the different developmental stages of planthoppers. Small RNAs derived from these RPSlSs are predominantly 26 to 28 nt long, which is a typical characteristic of PIWI-interacting RNAs. Phylogenetic analysis suggests that IIV-6 acquires a SINE-like retrotransposon from S. furcifera after the evolutionary divergence of the three rice planthoppers. This study provides further examples of the horizontal transfer of an insect transposon to virus and suggests the association of rice planthoppers with iridoviruses in the past or present.IMPORTANCE This study provides an example of the horizontal transfer event from a rice planthopper genome to an IIV-6 genome. A small region of the IIV-6 genome (∼300 nt) is highly homologous to the sequences presented in high copy numbers of three rice planthopper genomes that are related to the SINEs, a class of retroposons. The expression of these planthopper SINE-like sequences was confirmed, and corresponding Piwi-interacting RNA-like small RNAs were identified and comprehensively characterized. Phylogenetic analysis suggests that the giant invertebrate iridovirus IIV-6 obtains this SINE-related sequence from Sogatella furcifera through a horizontal transfer event in the past. To the best of our knowledge, this is the first report of a horizontal transfer event between a planthopper and a giant DNA virus and also is the first evidence for the eukaryotic origin of genetic material in iridoviruses.",Examination and Reconstruction of Three Ancient Endogenous Parvovirus Capsid Protein Gene Remnants Found in Rodent Genomes.,https://www.ncbi.nlm.nih.gov/pubmed/30626673,Journal of virology,2019 03 29,"Parvovirus-derived endogenous viral elements (EVEs) have been found in the genomes of many different animal species, resulting from integration events that may have occurred from more than 50 million years ago to much more recently. Here, we further investigate the properties of autonomous parvovirus EVEs and describe their relationships to contemporary viruses. While we did not find any intact capsid protein open reading frames in the integrated viral sequences, we examined three EVEs that were repaired to form full-length sequences with relatively few changes. These sequences were found in the genomes of Rattus norvegicus (brown rat), Mus spretus (Algerian mouse), and Apodemus sylvaticus (wood mouse). The R. norvegicus sequence was not present in the genomes of the closely related species R. rattus, R. tanezumi, R. exulans, and R. everetti, indicating that it was less than 2 million years old, and the M. spretus and A. sylvaticus sequences were not found in the published genomes of other mouse species, also indicating relatively recent insertions. The M. spretus VP2 sequence assembled into capsids, which had high thermal stability, bound the sialic acid N-acetylneuraminic acid, and entered murine L cells. The 3.89-Å structure of the M. spretus virus-like particles (VLPs), determined using cryo-electron microscopy, showed similarities to rodent and porcine parvovirus capsids. The repaired VP2 sequences from R. norvegicus and A. sylvaticus did not assemble as first prepared, but chimeras combining capsid surface loops from R. norvegicus with canine parvovirus assembled, allowing some of that capsid's structures and functions to be examined.IMPORTANCE Parvovirus endogenous viral elements (EVEs) that have been incorporated into the genomes of different animals represent remnants of the DNA sequences of ancient viruses that infected the ancestors of those animals millions of years ago, but we know little about their properties or how they differ from currently circulating parvoviruses. By expressing the capsid proteins of different parvovirus EVEs that were found integrated into the genomes of three different rodents, we can examine their structures and functions. A VP2 (major capsid protein) EVE sequence from a mouse genome assembled into capsids that had a similar structure and biophysical properties to extant parvoviruses and also bound sialic acids and entered rodent cells. Chimeras formed from combinations of canine parvovirus and portions of the parvovirus sequences from the brown rat genome allowed us to examine the structures and functions of the surface loops of that EVE capsid.",The Human CD4+ T Cell Response against Mumps Virus Targets a Broadly Recognized Nucleoprotein Epitope.,https://www.ncbi.nlm.nih.gov/pubmed/30626672,Journal of virology,2019 03 29,"Mumps outbreaks among vaccinated young adults stress the need for a better understanding of mumps virus (MuV)-induced immunity. Antibody responses to MuV are well characterized, but studies on T cell responses are limited. We recently isolated a MuV-specific CD4+ T cell clone by stimulating peripheral blood mononuclear cells (PBMCs) from a mumps case with the viral nucleoprotein (MuV-N). In this study, we further explored the identity and relevance of the epitope recognized by the CD4+ T cell clone and ex vivo by T cells in a cohort of mumps cases. Using a two-dimensional matrix peptide pool of 15-mer peptides covering the complete MuV-N, we identified the epitope recognized by the T cell clone as MuV-N110-124 GTYRLIPNARANLTA, present in a well-conserved region of the viral protein. Upon peptide-specific stimulation, the T cell clone expressed the activation marker CD137 and produced gamma interferon, tumor necrosis factor, and interleukin-10 in a HLA-DR4-restricted manner. Moreover, the CD4+ T cells exerted a cytotoxic phenotype and specifically killed cells presenting MuV-N110-124 Furthermore, the identified peptide is widely applicable to the general population since it is predicted to bind various common HLA-DR molecules, and epitope-specific CD4+ T cells displaying cytotoxic/Th1-type properties were found in all tested mumps cases expressing different HLA-DR alleles. This first broadly recognized human MuV-specific CD4+ T cell epitope could provide a useful tool to detect and evaluate virus-specific T cell responses upon MuV infection or following vaccination.IMPORTANCE Recent outbreaks of mumps among vaccinated young adults have been reported worldwide. Humoral responses against mumps virus (MuV) are well characterized, although no correlate of protection has been elucidated, stressing the need to better understand cellular MuV-specific immunity. In this study, we identified the first MuV T cell epitope, which is derived from the viral nucleoprotein (MuV-N) and was recognized by a cytotoxic/Th1 CD4+ T cell clone that was isolated from a mumps case. Moreover, the epitope was predicted to bind a broad variety of common HLA-DRB1 alleles, which was confirmed by the epitope-specific cytotoxic/Th1 CD4+ T cell responses observed in multiple mumps cases with various HLA-DRB1 genotypes. The identified epitope is completely conserved among various mumps strains. These findings qualify this promiscuous MuV T cell epitope as a useful tool for further in-depth exploration of MuV-specific T cell immunity after natural mumps virus infection or induced by vaccination.",US3 Kinase-Mediated Phosphorylation of Tegument Protein VP8 Plays a Critical Role in the Cellular Localization of VP8 and Its Effect on the Lipid Metabolism of Bovine Herpesvirus 1-Infected Cells.,https://www.ncbi.nlm.nih.gov/pubmed/30626671,Journal of virology,2019 03 29,"Bovine herpesvirus 1 (BoHV-1) infects bovine species, causing respiratory infections, genital disorders and abortions. VP8 is the most abundant tegument protein of BoHV-1 and is critical for virus replication in cattle. In this study, the cellular transport of VP8 in BoHV-1-infected cells and its ability to alter the cellular lipid metabolism were investigated. A viral kinase, US3, was found to be involved in regulating these processes. In the early stages of infection VP8 was localized in the nucleus. Subsequently, presumably after completion of its role in the nucleus, VP8 was translocated to the cytoplasm. When US3 was deleted or the essential US3 phosphorylation site of VP8 was mutated in BoHV-1, the majority of VP8 was localized in the nuclei of infected cells. This suggests that phosphorylation by US3 may be critical for cytoplasmic localization of VP8. Eventually, the cytoplasmic VP8 was accumulated in the cis-Golgi apparatus but not in the trans-Golgi network, implying that VP8 was not involved in virion transport toward and budding from the cell membrane. VP8 caused lipid droplet (LD) formation in the nuclei of transfected cells and increased cellular cholesterol levels. Lipid droplets were not found in the nuclei of BoHV-1-infected cells when VP8 was cytoplasmic in the presence of US3. However, when US3 was deleted or phosphorylation residues in VP8 were mutated, nuclear VP8 and LDs appeared in BoHV-1-infected cells. The total cholesterol level was increased in BoHV-1-infected cells but not in ΔUL47-BoHV-1-infected cells, further supporting a role for VP8 in altering the cellular lipid metabolism during infection.IMPORTANCE Nuclear localization signals (NLSs) and nuclear export signals (NESs) are important elements directing VP8 to the desired locations in the BoHV-1-infected cell. In this study, a critical regulator that switches the nuclear and cytoplasmic localization of VP8 in BoHV-1-infected cells was identified. BoHV-1 used viral kinase US3 to regulate the cellular localization of VP8. Early during BoHV-1 infection VP8 was localized in the nucleus, where it performs various functions; once US3 was expressed, phosphorylated VP8 was cytoplasmic and ultimately accumulated in the cis-Golgi apparatus, presumably to be incorporated into virions. The Golgi localization of VP8 was only observed in virus-infected cells and not in US3-cotransfected cells, suggesting that this is mediated by other viral factors. Interestingly, VP8 was shown to cause increased cholesterol levels, which is a novel function for VP8 and a potential strategy to supply lipid for viral replication.",West Nile Virus-Inclusive Single-Cell RNA Sequencing Reveals Heterogeneity in the Type I Interferon Response within Single Cells.,https://www.ncbi.nlm.nih.gov/pubmed/30626670,Journal of virology,2019 04 06,"West Nile virus (WNV) is a neurotropic mosquito-borne flavivirus of global importance. Neuroinvasive WNV infection results in encephalitis and can lead to prolonged neurological impairment or death. Type I interferon (IFN-I) is crucial for promoting antiviral defenses through the induction of antiviral effectors, which function to restrict viral replication and spread. However, our understanding of the antiviral response to WNV infection is mostly derived from analysis of bulk cell populations. It is becoming increasingly apparent that substantial heterogeneity in cellular processes exists among individual cells, even within a seemingly homogenous cell population. Here, we present WNV-inclusive single-cell RNA sequencing (scRNA-seq), an approach to examine the transcriptional variation and viral RNA burden across single cells. We observed that only a few cells within the bulk population displayed robust transcription of IFN-β mRNA, and this did not appear to depend on viral RNA abundance within the same cell. Furthermore, we observed considerable transcriptional heterogeneity in the IFN-I response, with genes displaying high unimodal and bimodal expression patterns. Broadly, IFN-stimulated genes negatively correlated with viral RNA abundance, corresponding with a precipitous decline in expression in cells with high viral RNA levels. Altogether, we demonstrated the feasibility and utility of WNV-inclusive scRNA-seq as a high-throughput technique for single-cell transcriptomics and WNV RNA detection. This approach can be implemented in other models to provide insights into the cellular features of protective immunity and identify novel therapeutic targets.IMPORTANCE West Nile virus (WNV) is a clinically relevant pathogen responsible for recurrent epidemics of neuroinvasive disease. Type I interferon is essential for promoting an antiviral response against WNV infection; however, it is unclear how heterogeneity in the antiviral response at the single-cell level impacts viral control. Specifically, conventional approaches lack the ability to distinguish differences across cells with varying viral abundance. The significance of our research is to demonstrate a new technique for studying WNV infection at the single-cell level. We discovered extensive variation in antiviral gene expression and viral abundance across cells. This protocol can be applied to primary cells or in vivo models to better understand the underlying cellular heterogeneity following WNV infection for the development of targeted therapeutic strategies.",Natural Inhibitor of Human Cytomegalovirus in Human Seminal Plasma.,https://www.ncbi.nlm.nih.gov/pubmed/30626669,Journal of virology,2019 03 29,"Human cytomegalovirus (HCMV) is the most frequent viral cause of congenital infections that can lead to severe birth defects. Although HCMV is frequently detected in semen and thus is potentially sexually transmitted, the role of semen in HCMV transmission is largely unclear. Here we describe that human seminal plasma (SP; the cell-free supernatant of semen) inhibits HCMV infection. The inhibition of HCMV infection was dose dependent and effective for different cell types, virus strains, and semen donors. This inhibitory effect was specific for HCMV, as herpes simplex virus 2 (HSV-2) and human immunodeficiency virus type 1 (HIV-1) infections were enhanced by SP. Mechanistically, SP inhibited infection by interfering with the attachment of virions to cells most likely via an interaction with the trimeric glycoprotein complex gH/gL/gO. Together, our findings suggest that semen contains a factor that potentially limits sexual transmission of HCMV.IMPORTANCE The role of semen in sexual transmission of human cytomegalovirus (HCMV) is currently unclear. This is surprising, as HCMV is frequently detected in this body fluid and infection is of high danger for neonates and pregnant women. In this study, we found that seminal plasma (SP) dose dependently inhibited HCMV infection. The infection inhibition was specific for HCMV, as other viruses, such as human immunodeficiency virus type 1 (HIV-1) and herpes simplex virus 2 (HSV-2), were not inhibited by SP. SP must contain a soluble, heat-resistant factor that limits attachment of HCMV particles to cells, probably by interaction with the trimeric glycoprotein complex gH/gL/gO. This novel virus-host interaction could possibly limit transmission of HCMV via semen during sexual intercourse.",Geminiviral V2 Protein Suppresses Transcriptional Gene Silencing through Interaction with AGO4.,https://www.ncbi.nlm.nih.gov/pubmed/30626668,Journal of virology,2019 03 29,"In plants, RNA-directed DNA methylation (RdDM)-mediated transcriptional gene silencing (TGS) is a natural antiviral defense against geminiviruses. Several geminiviral proteins have been shown to target the enzymes related to the methyl cycle or histone modification; however, it remains largely unknown whether and by which mechanism geminiviruses directly inhibit RdDM-mediated TGS. In this study, we showed that Cotton leaf curl Multan virus (CLCuMuV) V2 directly interacts with Nicotiana benthamiana AGO4 (NbAGO4) and that the L76S mutation in V2 (V2L76S) abolishes such interaction. We further showed that V2, but not V2L76S, can suppresses RdDM and TGS. Silencing of NbAGO4 inhibits TGS, reduces the viral methylation level, and enhances CLCuMuV DNA accumulation. In contrast, the V2L76S substitution mutant attenuates CLCuMuV infection and enhances the viral methylation level. These findings reveal that CLCuMuV V2 contributes to viral infection by interaction with NbAGO4 to suppress RdDM-mediated TGS in plants.IMPORTANCE In plants, the RNA-directed DNA methylation (RdDM) pathway is a natural antiviral defense mechanism against geminiviruses. However, how geminiviruses counter RdDM-mediated defense is largely unknown. Our findings reveal that Cotton leaf curl Multan virus V2 contributes to viral infection by interaction with NbAGO4 to suppress RNA-directed DNA methylation-mediated transcriptional gene silencing in plants. Our work provides the first evidence that a geminiviral protein is able to directly target core RdDM components to counter RdDM-mediated TGS antiviral defense in plants, which extends our current understanding of viral counters to host antiviral defense.",A Minigenome Study of Hazara Nairovirus Genomic Promoters.,https://www.ncbi.nlm.nih.gov/pubmed/30626667,Journal of virology,2019 03 29,"Hazara nairovirus (HAZV) is a trisegmented RNA virus most closely related to Crimean-Congo hemorrhagic fever virus (CCHFV) in the order Bunyavirales The terminal roughly 20 nucleotides (nt) of its genome ends are highly complementary, similar to those of other segmented negative-strand RNA viruses (sNSV), and act as promoters for RNA synthesis. These promoters contain two elements: the extreme termini of both strands (promoter element 1 [PE1]) are conserved and virus specific and are found bound to separate sites on the polymerase surface in crystal structures of promoter-polymerase complexes. The following sequences (PE2) are segment specific, with the potential to form double-stranded RNA (dsRNA), and the latter aspect is also important for promoter activity. Nairovirus genome promoters differ from those of peribunyaviruses and arenaviruses in that they contain a short single-stranded region between the two regions of complementarity. Using a HAZV minigenome system, we found the single-stranded nature of this region, as well as the potential of the following sequence to form dsRNA, is essential for reporter gene expression. Most unexpectedly, the sequence of the PE2 dsRNA appears to be equally important for promoter activity. These differences in sNSV PE2 promoter elements are discussed in light of our current understanding of the initiation of RNA synthesis.IMPORTANCE A minigenome system for HAZV, closely related to CCHFV, was used to study its genome replication. HAZV genome ends, like those of other sNSV, such as peribunyaviruses and arenaviruses, are highly complementary and serve as promoters for genome synthesis. These promoters are composed of two elements: the extreme termini of both 3' and 5' strands that are initially bound to separate sites on the polymerase surface in a sequence-specific fashion and the following sequences with the potential to anneal but whose sequence is not important. Nairovirus promoters differ from the other sNSV cited in that they contain a short single-stranded RNA (ssRNA) region between the two elements. The single-stranded nature of this region is an essential element of the promoter, whereas its sequence is unimportant. The sequence of the following complementary region is unexpectedly also important, a possible rare example of sequence-specific dsRNA recognition.",RNA-Binding Motif Protein 24 (RBM24) Is Involved in Pregenomic RNA Packaging by Mediating Interaction between Hepatitis B Virus Polymerase and the Epsilon Element.,https://www.ncbi.nlm.nih.gov/pubmed/30626666,Journal of virology,2019 03 29,"Encapsidation of pregenomic RNA (pgRNA) is a crucial step in hepatitis B virus (HBV) replication. Binding by viral polymerase (Pol) to the epsilon stem-loop (ε) on the 5'-terminal region (TR) of pgRNA is required for pgRNA packaging. However, the detailed mechanism is not well understood. RNA-binding motif protein 24 (RBM24) inhibits core translation by binding to the 5'-TR of pgRNA. Here, we demonstrate that RBM24 is also involved in pgRNA packaging. RBM24 directly binds to the lower bulge of ε via RNA recognition submotifs (RNPs). RBM24 also interacts with Pol in an RNA-independent manner. The alanine-rich domain (ARD) of RBM24 and the reverse transcriptase (RT) domain of Pol are essential for binding between RBM24 and Pol. In addition, overexpression of RBM24 increases Pol-ε interaction, whereas RBM24 knockdown decreases the interaction. RBM24 was able to rescue binding between ε and mutant Pol lacking ε-binding activity, further showing that RBM24 mediates the interaction between Pol and ε by forming a Pol-RBM24-ε complex. Finally, RBM24 significantly promotes the packaging efficiency of pgRNA. In conclusion, RBM24 mediates Pol-ε interaction and formation of a Pol-RBM24-ε complex, which inhibits translation of pgRNA and results in pgRNA packing into capsids/virions for reverse transcription and DNA synthesis.IMPORTANCE Hepatitis B virus (HBV) is a ubiquitous human pathogen, and HBV infection is a major global health burden. Chronic HBV infection is associated with the development of liver diseases, including fulminant hepatitis, hepatic fibrosis, cirrhosis, and hepatocellular carcinoma. A currently approved vaccine can prevent HBV infection, and medications are able to reduce viral loads and prevent liver disease progression. However, current treatments rarely achieve a cure for chronic infection. Thus, it is important to gain insight into the mechanisms of HBV replication. In this study, we found that the host factor RBM24 is involved in pregenomic RNA (pgRNA) packaging and regulates HBV replication. These findings highlight a potential target for antiviral therapeutics of HBV infection.",Unique Transcriptional Architecture in Airway Epithelial Cells and Macrophages Shapes Distinct Responses following Influenza Virus Infection Ex Vivo.,https://www.ncbi.nlm.nih.gov/pubmed/30626665,Journal of virology,2019 03 29,"Airway epithelial cells and macrophages differ markedly in their responses to influenza A virus (IAV) infection. To investigate transcriptional responses underlying these differences, purified subsets of type II airway epithelial cells (ATII) and alveolar macrophages (AM) recovered from the lungs of mock- or IAV-infected mice at 9 h postinfection were subjected to RNA sequencing. This time point was chosen to allow for characterization of cell types first infected with the virus inoculum, prior to multicycle virus replication and the infiltration of inflammatory cells into the airways. In the absence of infection, AM predominantly expressed genes related to immunity, whereas ATII expressed genes consistent with their physiological roles in the lung. Following IAV infection, AM almost exclusively activated cell-intrinsic antiviral pathways that were dependent on interferon (IFN) regulatory factor 3/7 (IRF3/7) and/or type I IFN signaling. In contrast, IAV-infected ATII activated a broader range of physiological responses, including cell-intrinsic antiviral pathways, which were both independent of and dependent on IRF3/7 and/or type I IFN. These data suggest that transcriptional profiles hardwired during development are a major determinant underlying the different responses of ATII and AM to IAV infection.IMPORTANCE Airway epithelial cells (AEC) and airway macrophages (AM) represent major targets of influenza A virus (IAV) infection in the lung, yet the two cell types respond very differently to IAV infection. We have used RNA sequencing to define the host transcriptional responses in each cell type under steady-state conditions as well as following IAV infection. To do this, different cell subsets isolated from the lungs of mock- and IAV-infected mice were subjected to RNA sequencing. Under steady-state conditions, AM and AEC express distinct transcriptional activities, consistent with distinct physiological roles in the airways. Not surprisingly, these cells also exhibited major differences in transcriptional responses following IAV infection. These studies shed light on how the different transcriptional architectures of airway cells from two different lineages drive transcriptional responses to IAV infection."

While affected granulocytes show reduced glucose utilization, the underlying mechanism is unknown and causal therapies are lacking. Using a combination of enzymological, cell-culture, and in vivo approaches, we demonstrate that G6PT and G6PC3 collaborate to destroy 1,5-anhydroglucitol-6-phosphate (1,5AG6P), a close structural analog of glucose-6-phosphate and an inhibitor of low-KM hexokinases, which catalyze the first step in glycolysis in most tissues. We show that 1,5AG6P is made by phosphorylation of 1,5-anhydroglucitol, a compound normally present in human plasma, by side activities of ADP-glucokinase and low-KM hexokinases. Granulocytes from patients deficient in G6PC3 or G6PT accumulate 1,5AG6P to concentrations (∼3 mM) that strongly inhibit hexokinase activity. In a model of G6PC3-deficient mouse neutrophils, physiological concentrations of 1,5-anhydroglucitol caused massive accumulation of 1,5AG6P, a decrease in glucose utilization, and cell death. Treating G6PC3-deficient mice with an inhibitor of the kidney glucose transporter SGLT2 to lower their blood level of 1,5-anhydroglucitol restored a normal neutrophil count, while administration of 1,5-anhydroglucitol had the opposite effect. In conclusion, we show that the neutropenia in patients with G6PC3 or G6PT mutations is a metabolite-repair deficiency, caused by a failure to eliminate the nonclassical metabolite 1,5AG6P.",Multidrug-resistant plasmids repress chromosomally encoded T6SS to enable their dissemination.,https://www.ncbi.nlm.nih.gov/pubmed/30626645,Proceedings of the National Academy of Sciences of the United States of America,2019 03 25,"Acinetobacter baumannii (Ab) is a nosocomial pathogen with one of the highest rates of multidrug resistance (MDR). This is partially due to transmissible plasmids. Many Ab strains harbor a constitutively active type VI secretion system (T6SS) that is employed to kill nonkin bacteria. T6SS and plasmid conjugation both involve cell-to-cell contact. Paradoxically, successful conjugation requires the survival of the recipient, which is the target of the T6SS. Thus, an active T6SS in either the donor or the recipient poses a challenge to plasmid conjugation. Here, we show that large conjugative MDR plasmids heavily rely on their distinctive ability to repress the T6SS of their hosts to enable their own dissemination and the conjugation of other plasmids, contributing to the propagation of MDR among Acinetobacter isolates.",Ribosomal protein RPL26 is the principal target of UFMylation.,https://www.ncbi.nlm.nih.gov/pubmed/30626644,Proceedings of the National Academy of Sciences of the United States of America,2019 03 25,"Ubiquitin fold modifier 1 (UFM1) is a small, metazoan-specific, ubiquitin-like protein modifier that is essential for embryonic development. Although loss-of-function mutations in UFM1 conjugation are linked to endoplasmic reticulum (ER) stress, neither the biological function nor the relevant cellular targets of this protein modifier are known. Here, we show that a largely uncharacterized ribosomal protein, RPL26, is the principal target of UFM1 conjugation. RPL26 UFMylation and de-UFMylation is catalyzed by enzyme complexes tethered to the cytoplasmic surface of the ER and UFMylated RPL26 is highly enriched on ER membrane-bound ribosomes and polysomes. Biochemical analysis and structural modeling establish that UFMylated RPL26 and the UFMylation machinery are in close proximity to the SEC61 translocon, suggesting that this modification plays a direct role in cotranslational protein translocation into the ER. These data suggest that UFMylation is a ribosomal modification specialized to facilitate metazoan-specific protein biogenesis at the ER.",Structural mechanism of transcription inhibition by lasso peptides microcin J25 and capistruin.,https://www.ncbi.nlm.nih.gov/pubmed/30626643,Proceedings of the National Academy of Sciences of the United States of America,2019 03 25,"We report crystal structures of the antibacterial lasso peptides microcin J25 (MccJ25) and capistruin (Cap) bound to their natural enzymatic target, the bacterial RNA polymerase (RNAP). Both peptides bind within the RNAP secondary channel, through which NTP substrates enter the RNAP active site, and sterically block trigger-loop folding, which is essential for efficient catalysis by the RNAP. MccJ25 binds deep within the secondary channel in a manner expected to interfere with NTP substrate binding, explaining the partial competitive mechanism of inhibition with respect to NTPs found previously [Mukhopadhyay J, Sineva E, Knight J, Levy RM, Ebright RH (2004) Mol Cell 14:739-751]. The Cap binding determinant on RNAP overlaps, but is not identical to, that of MccJ25. Cap binds further from the RNAP active site and does not sterically interfere with NTP binding, and we show that Cap inhibition is partially noncompetitive with respect to NTPs. This work lays the groundwork for structure determination of other lasso peptides that target the bacterial RNAP and provides a structural foundation to guide lasso peptide antimicrobial engineering approaches.",Real-time dissection of dynamic uncoating of individual influenza viruses.,https://www.ncbi.nlm.nih.gov/pubmed/30626642,Proceedings of the National Academy of Sciences of the United States of America,2019 03 27,"Uncoating is an obligatory step in the virus life cycle that serves as an antiviral target. Unfortunately, it is challenging to study viral uncoating due to methodology limitations for detecting this transient and dynamic event. The uncoating of influenza A virus (IAV), which contains an unusual genome of eight segmented RNAs, is particularly poorly understood. Here, by encapsulating quantum dot (QD)-conjugated viral ribonucleoprotein complexes (vRNPs) within infectious IAV virions and applying single-particle imaging, we tracked the uncoating process of individual IAV virions. Approximately 30% of IAV particles were found to undergo uncoating through fusion with late endosomes in the ""around-nucleus"" region at 30 to 90 minutes postinfection. Inhibition of viral M2 proton channels and cellular endosome acidification prevented IAV uncoating. IAV vRNPs are released separately into the cytosol after virus uncoating. Then, individual vRNPs undergo a three-stage movement to the cell nucleus and display two diffusion patterns when inside the nucleus. These findings reveal IAV uncoating and vRNP trafficking mechanisms, filling a critical gap in knowledge about influenza viral infection.",Mitotic Cell Division in Caenorhabditis elegans.,https://www.ncbi.nlm.nih.gov/pubmed/30626640,Genetics,2019 03 12,"Mitotic cell divisions increase cell number while faithfully distributing the replicated genome at each division.

While type III PI4Ks have been targeted by small molecular inhibitors, thus helping decipher their importance in cellular physiology, no inhibitors are available for the type II PI4Ks, which hinders investigations into their cellular functions. Here, we describe the identification of small molecular inhibitors of PI4K type II alpha (PI4K2A) by implementing a large scale small molecule high-throughput screening.

In order to survive, Leishmania has developed several strategies to manipulate macrophage functions. Among these strategies, Leishmania as a source of bioactive lipids has been poorly explored. Herein, we assessed the biosynthesis of polyunsaturated fatty acid metabolites by infective and noninfective stages of Leishmania and further explored the role of these metabolites in macrophage polarization. The concentration of docosahexaenoic acid metabolites, precursors of proresolving lipid mediators, was increased in the infective stage of the parasite compared with the noninfective stage, and cytochrome P450-like proteins were shown to be implicated in the biosynthesis of these metabolites. The treatment of macrophages with lipids extracted from the infective forms of the parasite led to M2 macrophage polarization and blocked the differentiation into the M1 phenotype induced by IFN-γ.

Improving and fine-tuning the regulation of this process will further enhance grain yield by avoiding seed losses during crop production. In this work, we identified the loss-of-shattering mutant suppression of shattering1 (ssh1) through a screen of mutagenized wild rice (Oryza rufipogon) introgression lines with naturally high shattering. Using the MutMap approach and transformation experiments, we isolated a genetic factor for seed shattering, SSH1, which is an allele of SUPERNUMERARY BRACT (SNB), a gene encoding a plant-specific APETALA2-like transcription factor. A C-to-A point mutation in the ninth intron of SNB altered the splicing of its messenger RNA, causing the reduced shattering of the ssh1 mutant by altering the development of the abscission layer and vascular bundle at the junction between the seed and the pedicel. Our data suggest that SNB positively regulates the expression of two rice REPLUMLESS orthologs, qSH1 and SH5 In addition, the ssh1 mutant had larger seeds and a higher grain weight, resulting from its increased elongation of the glume longitudinal cells. The further identification of favorable SNB alleles will be valuable for improving rice seed shattering and grain yield using molecular breeding strategies.",Decreased Snow Cover Stimulates Under-Ice Primary Producers but Impairs Methanotrophic Capacity.,https://www.ncbi.nlm.nih.gov/pubmed/30626619,mSphere,2019 02 15,"Climate change scenarios anticipate decreased spring snow cover in boreal and subarctic regions. Forest lakes are abundant in these regions and substantial contributors of methane emissions. To investigate the effect of reduced snow cover, we experimentally removed snow from an anoxic frozen lake. We observed that the removal of snow increased light penetration through the ice, increasing water temperature and modifying microbial composition in the different depths. Chlorophyll a and b concentrations increased in the upper water column, suggesting activation of algal primary producers. At the same time, Chlorobiaceae, one of the key photosynthetic bacterial families in anoxic lakes, shifted to lower depths. Moreover, a decrease in the relative abundance of methanotrophs within the bacterial family Methylococcaceae was detected, concurrent with an increase in methane concentration in the water column. These results indicate that decreased snow cover impacts both primary production and methane production and/or consumption, which may ultimately lead to increased methane emissions after spring ice off.IMPORTANCE Small lakes are an important source of greenhouse gases in the boreal zone. These lakes are severely impacted by the winter season, when ice and snow cover obstruct gas exchange between the lake and the atmosphere and diminish light availability in the water column. Currently, climate change is resulting in reduced spring snow cover. A short-term removal of the snow from the ice stimulated algal primary producers and subsequently heterotrophic bacteria.

Accumulating evidence suggests that the ability of a few immunodominant T-cell populations to detect and kill HIV/SIV-infected cells is important in individuals with a protective major histocompatibility complex class I (MHC-I) allele. On the other hand, immunization with live(-attenuated) viruses may be effective against superinfection of virulent viral strains regardless of the host's MHC-I haplotypes, although the underlying mechanisms have not been fully documented. In this article, we propose a hypothesis that the early detection of infected cells in superinfected individuals may be partly facilitated by recognition of diverse CTL epitopes with limited expression levels. We further explain the hypothesis using simple mathematics that was written based on previous in vitro viral suppression assay results and by considering the physical contact of infected cells with CTLs.",Cross-Domain and Viral Interactions in the Microbiome.,https://www.ncbi.nlm.nih.gov/pubmed/30626617,Microbiology and molecular biology reviews : MMBR,2019 03 29,"The importance of the microbiome to human health is increasingly recognized and has become a major focus of recent research. However, much of the work has focused on a few aspects, particularly the bacterial component of the microbiome, most frequently in the gastrointestinal tract. Yet humans and other animals can be colonized by a wide array of organisms spanning all domains of life, including bacteria and archaea, unicellular eukaryotes such as fungi, multicellular eukaryotes such as helminths, and viruses. As they share the same host niches, they can compete with, synergize with, and antagonize each other, with potential impacts on their host.

The intracellular amino and carboxyl termini play significant roles in determining the time-course and regulation of channel gating-for example, the C terminus regulates recovery from the desensitized state following agonist washout. This suggests that the intracellular regions of the channel have distinct structural features. Studies on the hP2X3R have shown that the intracellular regions associate to form a cytoplasmic cap in the open state of the channel. However, intracellular features could not be resolved in the agonist-free apo and ATP-bound desensitized structures. Here we investigate the organization of the intracellular regions of hP2X1R in the apo and ATP-bound desensitized states following expression in HEK293 cells. We couple cysteine scanning mutagenesis of residues R25-G30 and H355-R360 with the use of bi-functional cysteine reactive cross-linking compounds of different lengths (MTS-2-MTS, BMB, and BM(PEG)2), which we use as molecular calipers. If two cysteine residues come into close proximity, we predict they will be cross-linked and result in ∼66% of the receptor subunits running on a Western blot as dimers. In the control construct (C349A) that removed the free cysteine C349, and some cysteine-containing mutants, cross-linker treatment does not result in dimerization. However, we detect efficient dimerization for R25C, G30C, P358C, K359C, and R360C. This selective pattern indicates that there is structural organization to these regions in the apo and desensitized states in a native membrane environment. The existence of such precap (apo) and postcap (desensitized) organization of the intracellular domains would facilitate efficient gating of the channel.",Endothelin-converting enzyme-1 regulates glucagon-like peptide-1 receptor signalling and resensitisation.,https://www.ncbi.nlm.nih.gov/pubmed/30626614,The Biochemical journal,2019 02 09,"Following nutrient ingestion, glucagon-like peptide 1 (GLP-1) is secreted from intestinal L-cells and mediates anti-diabetic effects, most notably stimulating glucose-dependent insulin release from pancreatic β-cells but also inhibiting glucagon release, promoting satiety and weight reduction and potentially enhancing or preserving β-cell mass. These effects are mediated by the GLP-1 receptor (GLP-1R), which is a therapeutic target in type 2 diabetes. Although agonism at the GLP-1R has been well studied, desensitisation and resensitisation are perhaps less well explored. An understanding of these events is important, particularly in the design and use of novel receptor ligands. Here, using either HEK293 cells expressing the recombinant human GLP-1R or the pancreatic β-cell line, INS-1E with endogenous expressesion of the GLP-1R, we demonstrate GLP-1R desensitisation and subsequent resensitisation following removal of extracellular GLP-1 7-36 amide. Resensitisation is dependent on receptor internalisation, endosomal acidification and receptor recycling. Resensitisation is also regulated by endothelin-converting enzyme-1 (ECE-1) activity, most likely through proteolysis of GLP-1 in endosomes and the facilitation of GLP-1R dephosphorylation and recycling. Inhibition of ECE-1 activity also increases GLP-1-induced activation of extracellular signal-regulated kinase and generation of cAMP, suggesting processes dependent upon the lifetime of the internalised ligand-receptor complex."

Radial growth of plant shoots and roots is a stem cell-driven process that is fundamental for the mechanical and physiological support of enlarging plant bodies. In most dicotyledonous species, the underlying stem cell niche, the cambium, generates xylem inwards and phloem outwards. Despite the importance and intriguing dynamics of the cambium, the functional characterization of its stem cells is hampered by the lack of experimental tools for accessing distinct cambium sub-domains. Here, we use the hypocotyl of Arabidopsis thaliana to map stem cell activity in the proliferating cambium. Through pulse labeling and genetically encoded lineage tracing, we find that a single bifacial stem cell generates both xylem and phloem cell lineages. This cell is characterized by a specific combination of PXY (TDR), SMXL5 and WOX4 gene activity and a high division rate in comparison with tissue-specific progenitors. Our analysis provides a cellular fate map of radial plant growth, and suggests that stem cell quiescence is not a general prerequisite for life-long tissue production.This article has an associated 'The people behind the papers' interview.",Neuronal migration in the CNS during development and disease: insights from in vivo and in vitro models.,https://www.ncbi.nlm.nih.gov/pubmed/30626593,"Development (Cambridge, England)",2019 01 10,"Neuronal migration is a fundamental process that governs embryonic brain development.

We recently found that EoE susceptibility is associated with genetic variants in the promoter of CAPN14, a gene with reported esophagus-specific expression. CAPN14 is dynamically up-regulated as a function of EoE disease activity and after exposure of epithelial cells to interleukin-13 (IL-13). Herein, we aimed to explore molecular modulation of CAPN14 expression. We identified three putative binding sites for the IL-13-activated transcription factor STAT6 in the promoter and first intron of CAPN14 Luciferase reporter assays revealed that the two most distal STAT6 elements were required for the ∼10-fold increase in promoter activity subsequent to stimulation with IL-13 or IL-4, and also for the genotype-dependent reduction in IL-13-induced promoter activity. One of the STAT6 elements in the promoter was necessary for IL-13-mediated induction of CAPN14 promoter activity while the other STAT6 promoter element was necessary for full induction. Chromatin immunoprecipitation in IL-13 stimulated esophageal epithelial cells was used to further support STAT6 binding to the promoter of CAPN14 at these STAT6 binding sites. The highest CAPN14 and calpain-14 expression occurred with IL-13 or IL-4 stimulation of esophageal epithelial cells under culture conditions that allow the cells to differentiate into a stratified epithelium. This work corroborates a candidate molecular mechanism for EoE disease etiology in which the risk variant at 2p23 dampens CAPN14 expression in differentiated esophageal epithelial cells following IL-13/STAT6 induction of CAPN14 promoter activity.",Acetyl-CoA Metabolism Supports Multistep Pancreatic Tumorigenesis.,https://www.ncbi.nlm.nih.gov/pubmed/30626590,Cancer discovery,2019 06 10,"Pancreatic ductal adenocarcinoma (PDA) has a poor prognosis, and new strategies for prevention and treatment are urgently needed. We previously reported that histone H4 acetylation is elevated in pancreatic acinar cells harboring Kras mutations prior to the appearance of premalignant lesions. Because acetyl-CoA abundance regulates global histone acetylation, we hypothesized that altered acetyl-CoA metabolism might contribute to metabolic or epigenetic alterations that promote tumorigenesis. We found that acetyl-CoA abundance is elevated in KRAS-mutant acinar cells and that its use in the mevalonate pathway supports acinar-to-ductal metaplasia (ADM). Pancreas-specific loss of the acetyl-CoA-producing enzyme ATP-citrate lyase (ACLY) accordingly suppresses ADM and tumor formation. In PDA cells, growth factors promote AKT-ACLY signaling and histone acetylation, and both cell proliferation and tumor growth can be suppressed by concurrent BET inhibition and statin treatment. Thus, KRAS-driven metabolic alterations promote acinar cell plasticity and tumor development, and targeting acetyl-CoA-dependent processes exerts anticancer effects. SIGNIFICANCE: Pancreatic cancer is among the deadliest of human malignancies. We identify a key role for the metabolic enzyme ACLY, which produces acetyl-CoA, in pancreatic carcinogenesis. The data suggest that acetyl-CoA use for histone acetylation and in the mevalonate pathway facilitates cell plasticity and proliferation, suggesting potential to target these pathways.See related commentary by Halbrook et al., p. 326.This article is highlighted in the In This Issue feature, p. 305.",Generating mouse models for biomedical research: technological advances.,https://www.ncbi.nlm.nih.gov/pubmed/30626588,Disease models & mechanisms,2019 06 10,"Over the past decade, new methods and procedures have been developed to generate genetically engineered mouse models of human disease.

Each type of model has its own distinctive characteristics arising from the nature of the introduced mutation, as well as from the specific changes to the gene of interest. Here, we review the current range of mouse models with mutations in genes causative for the human neurodegenerative disease amyotrophic lateral sclerosis. We focus on the two main types of available mutants: transgenic mice and those that express mutant genes at physiological levels from gene targeting or from chemical mutagenesis. We compare the phenotypes for genes in which the two classes of model exist, to illustrate what they can teach us about different aspects of the disease, noting that informative models may not necessarily mimic the full trajectory of the human condition. Transgenic models can greatly overexpress mutant or wild-type proteins, giving us insight into protein deposition mechanisms, whereas models expressing mutant genes at physiological levels may develop slowly progressing phenotypes but illustrate early-stage disease processes. Although no mouse models fully recapitulate the human condition, almost all help researchers to understand normal and abnormal biological processes, providing that the individual characteristics of each model type, and how these may affect the interpretation of the data generated from each model, are considered and appreciated."

Since neuropeptide FF (NPFF) receptor antagonists reversed opioid-induced hyperalgesia and analgesic tolerance, the present work was performed to synthetize two branched peptidomimetics, EKR and RKE, containing the opioid peptide endomorphin-2 (EM-2) and the NPFF receptor antagonist RF9. Our data obtained from the in vitro cyclic adenosine monophosphate experiment demonstrated that EKR functioned as a mixed mu-, delta-opioid receptors agonist and NPFF1 receptor antagonist/NPFF2 receptor partial agonist, whereas RKE acted as a multi-functional peptidomimetic with the mu-opioid agonism and the NPFF1 antagonism/NPFF2 partial agonism. Furthermore, EKR and RKE completely blocked the NPFF2 receptor-mediated neurite outgrowth of Neuro 2A cells. In vivo antinociception studies found that supraspinal administration of EKR and RKE dose-dependently produced potent antinociception via the mu-opioid receptor in the tail-flick test. In carrageenan inflammatory pain model, spinal administration of EKR and RKE induced dose-related analgesia, which was significantly reduced by the opioid antagonist naloxone and the NPFF antagonist RF9. Notably, compared with morphine, intracerebroventricular repeated administration of EKR and RKE maintained prolonged antinociceptive effectiveness. In addition, at the antinociceptive doses, these two branched peptidomimetics did not significantly inhibit gastrointestinal transit. Taken together, the present work suggest that EKR and RKE behave as multi-functional ligands with the opioid agonism and the NPFF1 antagonism/NPFF2 partial agonism, and produce prolonged antinociception with limited side effects.

Accurate patient registration is a key first step that links a patient with their historical medical profile, yet patient registration is marked by its own challenges. Registration errors are deviations from standard operating procedures that occur during the process of patient registration. A frequent consequence of registration errors is the obfuscation of historical information and patient misidentification. Through duplicate registrations, patient information can be spread across multiple records and through hybrid registrations information from multiple patients can be combined into a single record. Patients with the same core identifiers, and the misuse of health insurance information also pose a threat to accurate registration. In the context of transfusion, this can lead to ABO discrepancies, failing to match for previously identified alloantibodies, and redundant serological investigations. Other consequences include missed billing opportunities and the inadvertent sharing of medical information. Reducing the occurrence of registration errors can be achieved through a multifaceted approach combining targeted educational efforts with technological improvements to the registration system. A recent development being the use of biometric identifiers. Despite their frequency, published reports on the occurrence and underlying cause of registration errors are rare. Most reports are found within articles on general medical errors or misidentification events and consequently, the true rate of registration errors among health information systems is not known. Here we summarize literature pertaining to how and why registration errors occur and their implications in the context of blood transfusion.",Up-regulated mRNA expression of some anti-inflammatory mediators in bovine oviduct epithelial cells by urea in vitro: Cellular pathways by Reactome analysis.,https://www.ncbi.nlm.nih.gov/pubmed/30626534,Reproductive biology,2019 04 20,"Increased urea concentration is a major cause of low fertility in dairy cows fed high-protein diets. A strong correlation exists between the urea concentration in the blood and oviduct fluid of dairy cows. In this study, bovine oviduct epithelial cells (BOECs) were incubated with varying concentrations of urea (0, 20, 40, and 80 mg/dL) in the absence of ovarian sex steroids (estradiol and progesterone) and luteinizing hormone. The 80 mg/dL urea reduced the cell viability, and thus was excluded in further analysis. Compared to the control (U0), the 20 mg/dL urea (U20) increased the mRNA expression of Toll-like receptor (TLR) 4, interleukin (IL) 10, IL4, and prostaglandin (PG) E synthase (mPGES) but decreased the mRNA expression of tumor necrosis factor α (TNFA). Compared to U0, the 40 mg/dL urea (U40) decreased the mRNA expression of TNFA and increased alpha-1-acid glycoprotein (AGP). U40 also increased TLR2, IL10, and IL4 mRNA expression compared to U0. In addition, compared to U20, the U40 decreased the mRNA expression of TLR4 and IL1B but increased that of AGP and TLR2. Subsequently, the mRNA expression data were then projected into the Reactome database. The Reactome analysis showed that pathways, including cytokine signaling in the immune system (i.e., TNFs bind their physiological receptors) and death receptor signaling (i.e., TNF signaling), were down-regulated in the presence of urea compared to the U0 group. These in vitro data implied that high urea level can alter the balance between pro- and anti-inflammatory responses in BOECs, thus providing a suboptimal environment for the early reproductive events or a weakened innate immune system, predisposing the oviduct to infections.",A multilevel analysis of factors influencing the inaccuracy of parental reports of adolescent HPV vaccination status.,https://www.ncbi.nlm.nih.gov/pubmed/30626532,Vaccine,2019 01 30,"Parental reports are commonly used for adolescent HPV vaccination status but may be subjected to bias.

Adding a new parenteral IRV to the current schedule of childhood immunizations would be more acceptable if it could be combined with another injectable vaccine such as inactivated polio vaccine (IPV). Current plans for polio eradication call for phasing out oral polio vaccine (OPV) and transitioning to IPV, initially in LMICs as a single dose booster after two doses of OPV and ultimately as a two dose schedule. Today in many LMICs, IPV is administered as a standalone vaccine, which involves a separate cold chain and is relatively costly. We therefore tested in two animal models formulations of IPV with IRV to determine whether co-administration might interfere with the immune response to each product and spare antigen dose for both vaccines. Our results demonstrate that IRV when adjuvanted with alum and administered alone or in combination with IPV did not impair the immune responses to either rotavirus or poliovirus serotypes 1, 2 and 3. Similarly, IPV when formulated and administered alone or together with IRV induced comparable levels of neutralizing antibody to poliovirus type 1, 2 and 3. Furthermore, comparable antibody titers were observed in animals vaccinated with low, middle or high dose of IPV or IRV in combination. This dose sparing and the lack of interference between IPV and IRV administered together represent another step to support the further development of this novel combination vaccine for children.",The views of key stakeholders around mandatory influenza vaccination of hospital and aged care staff: Examining the current climate in Australia.,https://www.ncbi.nlm.nih.gov/pubmed/30626529,Vaccine,2019 01 22,"Healthcare worker (HCW) vaccination against seasonal influenza is considered a key preventative measure within hospitals and aged-care facilities (ACFs) to reduce the risk of transmission and related disease.

Previous studies have shown that GL targets NF-κB and STAT3 pathways and induces G2/M cell cycle arrest in androgen-insensitive prostate cancer cells. In this study, we show that GL-induced cell cycle arrest is independent of the NF-κB and STAT3 pathways in DU145 and PC-3 cells, and also that GL did not affect cell cycling in androgen-sensitive prostate cancer cells such as LNCaP and 22Rv1 cells. In addition, we showed confluence resistance to GL in DU145 cells. Using a SWATH proteomic approach we identified a down-regulation of Nucleolar and spindle associated protein 1 (NUSAP1) under DU145 confluence. Moreover the expression of NUSAP1 in LNCaP cells is low compared to DU145 cells. The inhibition of NUSAP1 by siRNAs induced resistance to GL in DU145 cells, suggesting that NUSAP1 may be a target for GL and could be useful as a biomarker for the responsiveness of the antitumor activity of GL. Altogether, our finding shed light to the potential of GL to be developed as a novel treatment of castration resistance prostate cancer."

A novel high-throughput ultra-high performance liquid chromatography tandem mass spectrometry (UHPLC-MS/MS) method was established to quantify the levels of 19 flavonoids and 15 other phenolic compounds, including acids, aldehydes, and alcohols. The chromatographic separation was performed in 10 min, allowing for the resolution of isomers such as 3-, 4-, and 5-chlorogenic acids, 4-hydroxybenzoic and salicylic acids, isoorientin and orientin, and luteolin and kaempferol. The linearity range for each compound was found to be in the low fmol to the high pmol. Furthermore, this UHPLC-MS/MS approach was shown to be very sensitive with limits of detection between 1.5 amol to 300 fmol, and limits of quantification between 5 amol to 1000 fmol. Extracts from maize seedlings were used to assess the robustness of the method in terms of recovery efficiency, matrix effect, and accuracy. The biological matrix did not suppress the signal for 32 out of the 34 metabolites under investigation. Additionally, the majority of the analytes were recovered from the biological samples with an efficiency above 75%. All flavonoids and other phenolic compounds had an intra- and inter-day accuracy within a ±20% range, except for coniferyl alcohol and vanillic acid. Finally, the quantification of flavonoids, free and cell wall-bound phenolics in seedlings from two maize lines with contrasting phenolic content was successfully achieved using this methodology."

Interestingly, he left behind an autobiography (1972) which provides information not only about pathology in the Third Reich and in post-war Germany, but above all about his own life and work. His memoirs primarily served the purpose of recording his life's work for posterity and of retaining it in collective memory. This article focuses specifically on Hamperl's description of the Third Reich. The overriding aim of the paper is to elaborate on his political role and his relationship to National Socialism, which has hardly been investigated to date. Hamperl's autobiographical statements on this very question are therefore compared with the historical facts and - where necessary - contrasted and corrected. The same applies to the image that Hamperl draws of those pathologists who were part of his professional and personal network. The study is partly based on previously unevaluated archive sources and on a reanalysis of the relevant research literature. The paper concludes that Hamperl practised pronounced ""self-fashioning"": His memoirs give the impression of being formally and linguistically smoothened out and are clearly misleading in terms of content. They are characterised by omissions, ornamentation, and embellishments. Thus Hamperl makes false statements on the question of his NSDAP membership and depicts himself as a politically uninvolved university teacher.

While there is a consensus around the notion that the anti-osteoclastogenic factor, osteoprotegerin, is a driver of this effect, how connexin43 regulates osteoprotegerin gene expression is unclear. Here, we show that loss of connexin43 decreased osteoprotegerin gene expression and reduced ERK1/2 activation. Conversely, overexpression of connexin43 increased osteoprotegerin expression and enhanced ERK1/2 activation. This increase in phospho-ERK1/2 is required for connexin43 to induce transcription from the osteoprotegerin proximal promoter. Connexin43 increased promoter activity via a specific 200 base pair region of the osteoprotegerin promoter located at -1486 to -1286 with respect to the transcriptional start site, a region which includes four Sp1 binding elements. Further, activation of this promoter region required an intact functional connexin43, as hypomorphic or dominant negative connexin43 mutant constructs, including one with increased hemichannel activity, were unable to stimulate osteoprotegerin expression as strongly as wild type connexin43. Using chromatin immunoprecipitations, we show that connexin43 expression enhanced the recruitment of Sp1, but not Runx2, to the osteoprotegerin proximal promoter. In total, these data show that connexin43-dependent gap junctional communication among osteoblast cells permits efficient ERK1/2 activation. ERK1/2 signaling promotes the recruitment of the potent transcriptional activator, Sp1, to the osteoprotegerin proximal promoter, resulting in robust transcription of anti-osteoclastogenic factor, osteoprotegerin.",How bacteria arrange their organelles.,https://www.ncbi.nlm.nih.gov/pubmed/30626481,eLife,2019 01 13,The structures responsible for photosynthesis in bacteria use the nucleoid and two unique proteins as a scaffold to position themselves.,[Preparation and identification of monoclonal antibodies against African horse sickness virus VP7].,https://www.ncbi.nlm.nih.gov/pubmed/30626480,Xi bao yu fen zi mian yi xue za zhi = Chinese journal of cellular and molecular immunology,2019 03 23,"Objective To prepare the monoclonal antibody (mAb) against the African horsefever virus (AHSV) VP7 protein and to identify it.

Conclusion APS combined with DDP could significantly inhibit the growth and metastasis of Lewis lung cancer cells, which might be associated with the reduced expression of CD44, CD62P and OPN.",[Comparison of biological characteristics of bone marrow mesenchymal stem cells cultured in vitro from SD rats and BALB/c mice].,https://www.ncbi.nlm.nih.gov/pubmed/30626476,Xi bao yu fen zi mian yi xue za zhi = Chinese journal of cellular and molecular immunology,2019 03 23,"Objective To assess the biological characteristics of bone marrow mesenchymal stem cells (BMMSCs) cultured in vitro from SD rats and BALB/c mice. Methods BMMSCs derived from the bone marrow of SD rats or BALB/c mice were separated and purified by whole bone marrow culture and differential adherence methods, and then the cells were expanded by subculture successively. The growth and morphology of the primary and third-passage BMMSCs were observed by inverted phase-contrast microscopy and HE staining, the growth curve of the third-passage cells was drawn by cell counting. The cell surface antigen makers CD29, CD44, CD34, and CD45 on the third-passage BMMSCs were detected by flow cytometry. The third-passage BMMSCs were induced to differentiate into osteoblasts after exposed to bone-inducing media for 3 weeks, and then were identified by alizarin red staining. Results The primary bone marrow cells from SD rats formed the colony earlier than those from BALB/c mice. The primary and third-passage SD-BMMSCs were spindle-shaped, uniform in size and more in flocks, while the morphology of BALB/c-BMMSCs was more complex, being round, triangular or spindle-shaped, smaller, fewer and frost-like. HE staining showed the colony of the third-passage SD-BMMSCs was more typical than that of BALB/c-BMMSCs, and the cell morphology was more homogeneous. The growth curves of the third-passage BMMSCs of the 2 species presented a similar ""S"" shape, however, SD-BMMSCs had better growth vigor. Their differentiation into osteocytes was observed and both of the third-passage BMMSCs could differentiate into osteoblasts, but the mineralized nodules formed by SD-BMMSCs were more obvious. Flow cytometry revealed that the CD29 and CD44 expression levels in both of the third-passage BMMSCs were high and the CD34 level was low. The CD45 expression level in the SD-BMMSCs was low, while that was high in the BALB/c-BMMSCs. Conclusion The bone marrow of SD rats and BALB/c mice are suitable sources for BMMSCs, and the BMMSCs isolated and purified by whole bone marrow culture and differential adherence methods have typical morphology, immunophenotype and differentiation capacities of MSCs. However, the BMMSCs from SD rats can be separated and cultured more easily, have a higher purity and grow faster as compared with the ones from BALB/c mice.",[Overexpression of miR-451a inhibits cell proliferation by targeted macrophage migration inhibitory factor in HepG2 cells].,https://www.ncbi.nlm.nih.gov/pubmed/30626475,Xi bao yu fen zi mian yi xue za zhi = Chinese journal of cellular and molecular immunology,2019 03 23,"Objective To investigate the regulatory effect of miR-451a on macrophage migration inhibitory factor (MIF) and its effect on the proliferation of hepatocellular carcinoma HepG2 cells. Methods Real-time quantitative PCR was utilized to detect the expression of miR-451a and MIF mRNA in clinical liver cancer tissues. The luciferase reporter system was used to validate the regulatory relationship between miR-451a and MIF. The lentivirus overexpression vector of miR-451a was packaged to infect HepG2 cells. The expression of miR-451a and MIF mRNA was detected by real-time quantitative PCR. MIF protein level was detected by Western blotting. Cell proliferation was examined by MTT assay. Cell colony formation rate was tested by flat-plate colony formation experiment. Results The level of miR-451a was low and MIF mRNA was higher in liver cancer tissues. The luciferase reporter system showed that the intensity of the fluorescent signal was clearly weaker in MIF 3'UTR wild-type co-transfected cells with miR-451a mimics as compared with the other transfection groups. When HepG2 cells were infected with the lentivirus over-expressing miR-451a, the expression of miR-451a significantly increased; the expression of MIF significantly decreased; the cell proliferation and colony formation ability were weakened. Conclusion Overexpression of miR-451a can inhibit cell proliferation and colony formation by inhibiting MIF expression in HepG2 cells."

Breastfeeding has a special importance since it takes place at a critical period of growth and development of the newborn. We aimed to analyze if an appropriate lactation protects the offspring against mammary carcinogenesis during adult life and explore the mechanisms involved in the protective effect. One-day-old Sprague-Dawley female rats were randomly distributed in litters of three (L3), eight (L8) or 12 (L12) pups per dam, to induce a differential consumption of breast milk. At 55 days of age, the animals were treated with a single dose of dimethylbenzanthracene to study tumor latency, incidence and progression. Histological, immunohistochemical and Western blot studies were performed. We observed lower incidence and higher latency in L3 compared to the other groups. The mitotic index and expression of proliferating cell nuclear antigen (PCNA) was significantly augmented in tumors of L12 rats compared to L3 and L8, while the apoptotic index was augmented in tumors of L3 v. L12. Cleaved caspase 8 was significantly higher in tumors from L3 compared to L12. Tumors developed in L3 have a greater number of apoptotic bodies and a greater expression of caspase 8. These results demonstrate that the animals that maintained a higher intake of maternal milk (L3) presented lower incidence and greater tumor latency. Lower consumption of breast milk (L12) would increase tumor mitosis and the expression of PCNA, explaining the higher tumor incidence observed in this group.",Ontario's Retirement Homes and Long-Term Care Homes: A Comparison of Care Services and Funding Regimes.,https://www.ncbi.nlm.nih.gov/pubmed/30626461,Canadian journal on aging = La revue canadienne du vieillissement,2019 04 26,"ABSTRACTGrowing demand for beds in government-subsidized long-term care (LTC) homes in Ontario is causing long waitlists, which must be absorbed by other residential alternatives, including unsubsidized retirement homes. This study compares Ontario's LTC homes and retirement homes for care services provided, funding regimes, and implications of differential funding for seniors. Descriptive data for both types of homes were collected from public and proprietary sources regarding service offerings, availability, costs, and funding. Overlaps exist in the services of both LTC and retirement homes, particularly at higher levels of care. Although both sectors charge residents for accommodation, most care costs in LTC homes are publicly funded, whereas residents in retirement homes generally cover these expenses personally. Given waitlists in Ontario's LTC homes, many seniors must find residential care elsewhere, including in retirement homes. Several policy alternatives exist that may serve to improve equity of access to seniors' residential care.",Ethics and Floods: A Systematic Review.,https://www.ncbi.nlm.nih.gov/pubmed/30626460,Disaster medicine and public health preparedness,2019 01 10,"Disaster ethics is a developing field of inquiry recognizing the wide variety of ethical issues confronting various professionals involved in planning for and responding to different types of disasters. This article explores how ethical issues related to floods are addressed in academic literature. The review involved analysis of publications on ethics and floods identified in a systematic literature search of electronic databases that included sociological, biomedical, and geophysical sources. The review methods were guided by the PRISMA Statement on systematic reviews, adapted to this topic area, and followed by a qualitative analysis of the included publications. All articles were analyzed using NVivo software version 11. The qualitative analysis showed that further research is needed on the ethical issues involved in flood disasters. Ethical guidelines are needed for flood planners and responders that are based on the consistent application of well-established ethical principles, values, and virtues to the specific circumstances arising with each flood. Flexibility is required in applying such approaches. The results suggest that interdisciplinary collaboration (sociological, biomedical, geophysical, engineering, and ethical) could contribute significantly to the development of ethics in floods.

Previous research has also neglected the dimensional effects of psychological control on child bullying development. This study examined two psychological control dimensions, love withdrawal and guilt induction, and their effects on children's bullying aggressive behavior using a longitudinal design. Participants were first-generation Chinese American mothers (N = 133; mean age [Mage] = 37.82) and their preschool children (Mage = 4.48). Chinese immigrant mothers reported their psychologically controlling parenting and teachers rated children's bullying aggressive behaviors in the school setting. Confirmatory factor analyses were conducted to establish the psychometric properties and cross-wave measurement equivalence of the study constructs. Cross-lagged structural equation modeling analysis indicated that maternal love withdrawal prospectively predicted more bullying aggressive behavior, whereas guilt induction predicted less bullying aggressive behavior in children 6 months later. These results held after controlling for the initial level of children's problem behaviors and demographic variables (child age, gender, and maternal education). For child effects, child bullying aggressive behavior predicted more maternal guilt induction over time but not love withdrawal. Our findings highlight the importance of construct specificity and cultural context in understanding associations between parenting and child development.","Distinguishing differential susceptibility, diathesis-stress, and vantage sensitivity: Beyond the single gene and environment model.",https://www.ncbi.nlm.nih.gov/pubmed/30626458,Development and psychopathology,2019 01 10,"Currently, two main approaches exist to distinguish differential susceptibility from diathesis-stress and vantage sensitivity in Genotype × Environment interaction (G × E) research: regions of significance (RoS) and competitive-confirmatory approaches. Each is limited by its single-gene/single-environment foci given that most phenotypes are the product of multiple interacting genetic and environmental factors. We thus addressed these two concerns in a recently developed R package (LEGIT) for constructing G × E interaction models with latent genetic and environmental scores using alternating optimization. Herein we test, by means of computer simulation, diverse G × E models in the context of both single and multiple genes and environments. Results indicate that the RoS and competitive-confirmatory approaches were highly accurate when the sample size was large, whereas the latter performed better in small samples and for small effect sizes. The competitive-confirmatory approach generally had good accuracy (a) when effect size was moderate and N ≥ 500 and (b) when effect size was large and N ≥ 250, whereas RoS performed poorly. Computational tools to determine the type of G × E of multiple genes and environments are provided as extensions in our LEGIT R package.",Soluble urokinase plasminogen activator receptor is linearly associated with dietary quality and predicts mortality.,https://www.ncbi.nlm.nih.gov/pubmed/30626457,The British journal of nutrition,2019 03 26,"Chronic inflammation is associated with disease risk and mortality in the general population. Soluble urokinase plasminogen activator receptor (suPAR) is a stable marker of chronic inflammation, and a higher serum-concentration of suPAR is found in individuals with an unhealthy lifestyle such as smoking. This article investigates the association between suPAR and dietary quality measured with the dietary quality score (DQS). The DQS is an index of the overall quality of an individual's dietary habits assessed through a self-administered FFQ. Furthermore, this article investigates the association of both suPAR and the DQS with CVD risk and mortality in the general Danish population. We analysed 5347 individuals aged 30-60 years from the Danish Inter99 study cohort. Multiple linear regression analyses showed a linear inverse association between the DQS and suPAR (P=0·0005). Cox regression analyses showed an 18 (95 % CI 9, 26) % increase in the risk of death from any cause with each 1 ng/ml increase in suPAR. We found no significant association between the DQS and the mortality (hazard ratio: 1·16, 95 % CI 0·79, 1·69). All analyses were adjusted for demographics and lifestyle factors. The association between the DQS and suPAR on the one hand and suPAR and mortality on the other supports the argument that low dietary quality may constitute a health risk through its influence on chronic inflammation. Future research should examine whether suPAR is modifiable through changes in dietary habits.",Causal role of group B Streptococcus-induced acute chorioamnionitis in intrauterine growth retardation and cerebral palsy-like impairments.,https://www.ncbi.nlm.nih.gov/pubmed/30626456,Journal of developmental origins of health and disease,2019 01 10,"Chorioamnionitis and intrauterine growth retardation (IUGR) are risk factors for cerebral palsy (CP). Common bacteria isolated in chorioamnionitis include group B Streptococcus (GBS) serotypes Ia and III. Little is known about the impact of placental inflammation induced by different bacteria, including different GBS strains. We aimed to test the impact of chorioamnionitis induced by two common GBS serotypes (GBSIa and GBSIII) on growth and neuromotor outcomes in the progeny. Dams were exposed at the end of gestation to either saline, inactivated GBSIa or GBSIII. Inactivated GBS bacteria invaded placentas and triggered a chorioamnionitis featured by massive polymorphonuclear cell infiltrations. Offspring exposed to GBSIII - but not to GBSIa - developed IUGR, persisting beyond adolescent age. Male rats in utero exposed to GBSIII traveled a lower distance in the Open Field test, which was correlating with their level of IUGR. GBSIII-exposed rats presented decreased startle responses to acoustic stimuli beyond adolescent age. GBS-exposed rats displayed a dysmyelinated white matter in the corpus callosum adjacent to thinner primary motor cortices. A decreased density of microglial cells was detected in the mature corpus callosum of GBSIII-exposed males - but not females - which was correlating positively with the primary motor cortex thickness. Altogether, our results demonstrate a causal link between pathogen-induced acute chorioamnionitis and (1) IUGR, (2) serotype- and sex-specific neuromotor impairments and (3) abnormal development of primary motor cortices, dysmyelinated white matter and decreased density of microglial cells.",Recent Canadian efforts to develop population-level pregnancy intervention studies to mitigate effects of natural disasters and other tragedies.,https://www.ncbi.nlm.nih.gov/pubmed/30626455,Journal of developmental origins of health and disease,2019 03 28,"The preconception, pregnancy and immediate postpartum and newborn periods are times for mothers and their offspring when they are especially vulnerable to major stressors - those that are sudden and unexpected and those that are chronic.

Considerable evidence has accumulated demonstrating the adverse effects of natural disasters on pregnancy outcomes and developmental trajectories. However, beyond tracking outcomes, the time has arrived for gathering more information related to identifying mechanisms, predicting risk and developing stress-reducing and resilience-building interventions to improve outcomes.

This scoping review aimed to summarize the existing qualitative literature focused on provider experiences in the MAiD process. Key themes emerged across the literature that were related to the complexity of the MAiD process, the importance of relationships and communication, interprofessional roles and dynamics, and the coping process. The results of this review demonstrate the need for further investigation into the experiences of diverse MAiD providers, especially within the Canadian context."

In particular, recombinant vaccinia viruses (VV) hold great promise as interventional agents. In this article, we first summarize the current understanding of virus biology and viral genes involved in host-virus interactions to further improve the utility of these agents in therapeutic applications. We then discuss recent findings from basic and clinical studies using VV as cancer vaccines and oncolytic immunotherapies. Despite encouraging results gleaned from translational studies in animal models, clinical trials implementing VV vectors alone as cancer vaccines have yielded largely disappointing results. However, the combination of VV vaccines with alternate forms of standard therapies has resulted in superior clinical efficacy. For instance, combination regimens using TG4010 (MVA-MUC1-IL2) with first-line chemotherapy in advanced-stage non-small cell lung cancer or combining PANVAC with docetaxel in the setting of metastatic breast cancer have clearly provided enhanced clinical benefits to patients. Another novel cancer vaccine approach is to stimulate anti-tumor immunity via STING activation in Batf3-dependent dendritic cells (DC) through the use of replication-attenuated VV vectors. Oncolytic VVs have now been engineered for improved safety and superior therapeutic efficacy by arming them with immune-stimulatory genes or pro-apoptotic molecules to facilitate tumor immunogenic cell death, leading to enhanced DC-mediated cross-priming of T cells recognizing tumor antigens, including neoantigens. Encouraging translational and early phase clinical results with Pexa-Vec have matured into an ongoing global phase III trial for patients with hepatocellular carcinoma. Combinatorial approaches, most notably those using immune checkpoint blockade, have produced exciting pre-clinical results and warrant the development of innovative clinical studies. Finally, we discuss major hurdles that remain in the field and offer some perspectives regarding the development of next generation VV vectors for use as cancer therapeutics.",Effectiveness of architectural separation of septic and aseptic operating theatres for improving process quality and patient outcomes: a systematic review.,https://www.ncbi.nlm.nih.gov/pubmed/30626433,Systematic reviews,2019 01 13,"Architectural division of aseptic and septic operating theatres is a distinct structural feature of surgical departments in Germany.

In recent years, blood biomarkers have emerged as a realistic prospect to highlight accumulating pathology for secondary prevention trials. Neurofilament light chain (NfL), a marker of axonal degeneration, is robustly elevated in the blood of many neurological and neurodegenerative conditions, including AD. A strong relationship with cerebrospinal fluid (CSF) NfL suggests that these biomarker modalities reflect the same pathological process. Yet, the connection between blood NfL and brain tissue pathology has not been directly compared. In this study, longitudinal plasma NfL from cognitively healthy controls (n = 12) and AD participants (n = 57) were quantified by the Simoa platform. On reaching post-mortem, neuropathological assessment was performed on all participants, with additional frozen and paraffin-embedded tissue acquired from 26 participants for further biochemical (Aβ1-42, Aβ1-40, tau) and histological (NfL) evaluation. Plasma NfL concentrations were significantly increased in AD and correlated with cognitive decline, independent of age. Retrospective stratification based on Braak staging revealed that baseline plasma NfL concentrations were associated with higher neurofibrillary tangle pathology at post-mortem. Longitudinal increases in plasma NfL were observed in all Braak groupings; a significant negative association, however, was found between plasma NfL at time point 1 and both its rate of change and annual percentage increase. Immunohistochemical evaluation of NfL in the medial temporal gyrus (MTG) demonstrated an inverse relationship between Braak stages and NfL staining. Importantly, a significant negative correlation was found between the plasma NfL measurement closest to death and the level of NfL staining in the MTG at post-mortem. For the first time, we demonstrate that plasma NfL associates with the severity of neurofibrillary tangle pathology and neurodegeneration in the post-mortem brain.",Doyne honeycomb retinal dystrophy - functional improvement following subthreshold nanopulse laser treatment: a case report.,https://www.ncbi.nlm.nih.gov/pubmed/30626431,Journal of medical case reports,2019 05 01,"Based on phenotypic similarities between age-related macular degeneration and the autosomal disorder Doyne honeycomb retinal dystrophy, we report on a single nanolaser treatment of a patient with genotype Doyne honeycomb retinal dystrophy confirmation and evidence of disease progression over 12 months.

As a basis to generate criticisms and offer recommendations, the analysis used the shared themes of two sets of standards recently published by Globalization and Health (GH) and the American College of Physicians (ACP). These standards respectively address the ethical responsibilities of organizations and of physicians in the conduct of STGHCE. Information used in the original quality analysis and quality improvement consultation for SYP was gathered from interviews, medical committee minutes, output statistics, and observations in the course of a real-time trip. This case study describes how the standards served as a useful lens to assess SYP and as a platform from which to make recommendations for improved compliance with global conventions. Additionally, the standards provide SYP a body of consensus wisdom for holding itself accountable to patients, host communities, volunteers, and the donor community on a continuing basis. While the shared themes of these standards are intentionally broad and require context in their application, NGOs that support STGHCE may find it instructive to benchmark them to assure their own compliance with global standards for both the organization and their volunteer physicians.","Wild edible plants used by communities in and around selected forest reserves of Teso-Karamoja region, Uganda.",https://www.ncbi.nlm.nih.gov/pubmed/30626418,Journal of ethnobiology and ethnomedicine,2019 05 30,"The consumption of wild plants is an ancient tradition which serves multiple purposes.

However, the Kingdom of Saudi Arabia (henceforth abbreviated into KSA) has a wide range of flora, consisting of different species of trees, herbs, and shrubs and containing numerous edible and medicinal plants. The KSA is characterized by its vast area of diverse geographical landscapes and climates. Consequently, there is enormous variation in the distribution of plants across the Kingdom. The traditional use of ethnomedical plants in the KSA represents a strong interconnection among familiar remedies, health, diet, and traditional healing practices characterized by specific cultures. The present paper reviews a collection of medicinal plants in KSA used in ethnomedicine. This review might be useful in developing strategies for the sustainable use of medicinal plants which are among the threatened important natural resources in folk medicine in the KSA. The present study reports 309 genera which cover 471 species from a total of 2253 known species belonging to 89 families. The most dominating families are Asteraceae, Fabaceae, Lamiaceae, Euphorbiaceae, Solanaceae, Apiaceae, Brassicaceae, Chenopodiaceae, Poaceae, Amaranthaceae, Boraginaceae, Apocynaceae, Convolvoulaceae, Asclepiadaceae, Capparaceae, Polygonaceae, and Zygophyllaceae.",In-vitro and in-vivo evaluation of a novel bioprosthetic pulmonary valve for use in congenital heart surgery.,https://www.ncbi.nlm.nih.gov/pubmed/30626416,Journal of cardiothoracic surgery,2019 03 05,"Management of congenital malformations of the pulmonary artery and valve can be challenging.

Current recommended therapy forms provide psychotherapeutic interventions that are intended to train the patient how to deal with the tinnitus sound. Pharmaceutical managements are used to reduce secondary effects of the tinnitus sound such as sleep deprivation, emotional and concentration difficulties, but these treatments do not cure the tinnitus. Recent studies have shown that Tinnitus Retraining Therapy (TRT) significantly improves the quality of life for tinnitus patients. Furthermore, several studies have reported that cognitive behavioral therapy (CBT) relieves a substantial amount of distress by changing dysfunctional cognitions. However, when the tinnitus causes great interference with daily functioning, these treatment methods are not always sufficiently effective. Recent insights show that Eye Movement Desensitization Reprocessing (EMDR) is a highly effective therapy for medically unexplained symptoms such as chronic pain and phantom pain. In scientific research, tinnitus is compared to phantom limb pain. Starting from tinnitus as a phantom percept we therefore aim to demonstrate that the operating mechanisms of EMDR may also be an effective treatment method for patients with subjective tinnitus. The aim of this randomized controlled study with blind evaluator is to examine the effect of EMDR compared to CBT in chronic tinnitus patients. To our knowledge, there are no other studies that evaluate both methods simultaneously.","Study protocol: developing, disseminating, and implementing a core outcome set for selective fetal growth restriction in monochorionic twin pregnancies.",https://www.ncbi.nlm.nih.gov/pubmed/30626413,Trials,2019 05 07,"Selective fetal growth restriction in monochorionic twin pregnancies is associated with an increased risk of perinatal mortality and morbidity and represents a clinical dilemma. Interventions include expectant management with early preterm delivery if there are signs of fetal compromise, selective termination of the compromised twin, fetoscopic laser coagulation of the communicating placental vessels or termination of the whole pregnancy. Previous studies evaluating interventions have reported many different outcomes and outcome measures. Such variation makes comparing, contrasting, and combining results challenging, limiting ongoing research on this uncommon condition to inform clinical practice.

Phenotypic resistance to pyrethroids dominates in Ae. aegypti, and it has been partially explained by mutations in the voltage-gated sodium channel gene. Here, we assess community-level patterns of four knockdown resistance (kdr) haplotypes (C1534/I1016, F1534/I1016, C1534/V1016 and F1534/V1016) in Ae. aegypti in 24 randomly chosen city blocks from a city in Yucatán State, Mexico, during both the dry and wet season and over two years."

However, the specific roles of these cells and the timing of critical changes in their function are not well understood. Minocycline can protect against ischemic damage and promote recovery. These effects are usually attributed, at least partially, to the ability of this drug to suppress microglial activation.

There was a 14% increase in the overall AEFI reporting rate in 2016 compared with 2015. This increase in reported adverse events in 2016, compared to the previous year, was mainly attributable to introduction of the booster dose of the diphtheria, tetanus, and acellular pertussis-containing vaccine (DTPa) at 18 months of age in March 2016 and the zoster vaccine for those aged 70-79 years in November 2016. AEFI reporting rates for most other individual vaccines in 2016 were similar to 2015. The most commonly reported reactions were injection site reaction (29%), pyrexia (19%), rash (17%), vomiting (8%) and headache (7%).

The aim of AESOP 2015 was to determine the proportion of enterococcal bacteraemia isolates in Australia that were antimicrobial resistant, and to characterise the molecular epidemiology of the Enterococcus faecium isolates. Of the 1,009 unique episodes of bacteraemia investigated, 95.4% were caused by either E. faecalis (55.7%) or E. faecium (39.6%). Ampicillin resistance was detected in 0.2% of E. faecalis and in 86.0% of E. faecium. Vancomycin non-susceptibility was reported in 0.4% and 50.1% of E. faecalis and E. faecium respectively. Overall 56.2% of E. faecium harboured vanA or vanB genes. For the vanA/B positive E. faecium isolates, 61.0% harboured vanB genes and 36.8% vanA genes. The percentage of E. faecium bacteraemia isolates resistant to vancomycin in Australia is significantly higher than that seen in most European countries. E. faecium consisted of 49 multilocus sequence types (STs) of which 85.6% of isolates were classified into 11 major STs containing five or more isolates. All major STs belong to clonal cluster 17, a major hospital-adapted polyclonal E. faecium cluster. Four of the five predominant STs (ST796, ST555, ST203, and ST80) were found across most regions of Australia. The second most predominant clone was non-typable by multilocus sequence typing and found only in NSW and the ACT. Overall 73.9% of isolates belonging to the five predominant STs harboured vanA or vanB genes.

A total of 2,540 S.aureus bacteraemia episodes were reported, of which 19.7% were methicillin-resistant. The 30-day all-cause mortality associated with methicillin-resistant SAB was 23.1%, which was significantly higher than the 15.3% mortality associated with methicillin-susceptible SAB. With the exception of the β-lactams and erythromycin, antimicrobial-resistance in methicillin-susceptible S.aureus (MSSA) was rare. However, in addition to the β-lactams approximately 45% of methicillin-resistant S.aureus (MRSA) were resistant to erythromycin and ciprofloxacin and approximately 14% resistant to co-trimoxazole, tetracycline and gentamicin. When applying the EUCAST breakpoints, teicoplanin resistance was detected in two S.aureus isolates. Resistance was not detected for vancomycin and linezolid. Resistance to non-beta-lactam antimicrobials was largely attributable to 2 healthcare associated MRSA clones; ST22-IV [2B] (EMRSA-15) and ST239-III [3A] (Aus-2/3 EMRSA). ST22-IV [2B] (EMRSA-15) is the predominant healthcare associated clone in Australia. Seventy two percent of methicillin-resistant SAB were due to community associated clones.

We conducted literature and document reviews; key informant interviews; an online stakeholder survey; and descriptive analyses of a subset of surveillance data. The program is complex, but has proved useful for detecting serotype replacement in response to the national infant vaccination program-informing a change to the recommended vaccine in 2011. The program is less useful for monitoring targeted programs in other high-risk groups, because complete data for cases aged between five and 50 years are not routinely collected in the largest jurisdictions and data collection is hampered by the absence of accessible electronic health records. Lack of support for reference laboratories for antimicrobial susceptibility testing, and data entry and transmission problems in some jurisdictions, have reduced the utility of the program for surveillance of antimicrobial resistance (AMR). Priority recommendations to the EIPDSWG focus on collecting complete data for all cases, to allow matching of serotypes to vaccines and surveillance of vaccine failures, while ensuring stakeholders can easily access useful surveillance data at the level of detail they require.

Toxins are produced during harmful algal blooms, which occur most years on the east coast of Tasmania. Contaminated seafood looks and tastes normal and toxins are not destroyed by cooking or freezing. Commercial shellfish farms are monitored for harmful algae and shellfish toxins, but wild shellfish are not and pose a potential public health risk. A case of PSP was documented in Tasmania in 2011, and we are aware of anecdotal reports of cases in the 1980s and 1990s. We are not aware of cases elsewhere in Australia but harmful algal blooms have been detected in Victoria, South Australia and New South Wales. Routine monitoring of commercial shellfish in 2015 detected a large bloom of Alexandrium tamarense on the east coast of Tasmania, which can cause PSP. Between 2 and 12 October 2015, four cases of PSP were identified. All were adults who ate wild mussels from the east coast of Tasmania and had onset of numbness or tingling of the face and muscle weakness from 30 minutes to 12 hours later. Two cases were briefly hospitalised, both recovered. Since the outbreak, permanent signage at locations where shellfish are frequently recreationally foraged has been erected. Additional alerts are released during high risk periods based on surveillance of commercial sites by the Tasmanian Shellfish Quality Assurance Program. Several states in Australia are at risk of cases of PSP.

However, behaviour change theories apply to individuals not groups and behavioural interventions ultimately aim to achieve within-person rather than between-group change. Within-person methodology, such as N-of-1 (also known as single case design), can circumvent this issue, though has multiple design-specific challenges. This paper provides a conceptual review of the challenges and potential solutions for undertaking N-of-1 studies in health psychology. Key challenges identified include participant adherence to within-person protocols, carry-over and slow onset effects, suitability of behaviour change techniques for evaluation in N-of-1 experimental studies, optimal allocation sequencing and blinding, calculating power/sample size, and choosing the most suitable analysis approach. Key solutions include involving users in study design, employing recent technologies for unobtrusive data collection and problem solving by design. Within-person designs share common methodological requirements with conventional between-person designs but require specific methodological considerations. N-of-1 evaluation designs are appropriate for many though not all types of interventions. A greater understanding of patterns of behaviours and factors influencing behaviour change at the within-person level is required to progress health psychology into a precision science.

Yeast strains suitable for sake fermentation were subsequently isolated from sake brewers and distributed as Kyokai yeast strains. Sake yeast strains that produce characteristic flavors have been bred in response to various market demands and individual preferences. Interestingly, both genetic and morphological studies have indicated that sake yeast used during the Meiji era differs from new sake yeasts derived from Kyokai Strain No. 7 lineage. Here, we discuss the history of sake yeast breeding, from the discovery of sake yeast to the present day, to highlight the achievements of great Japanese scientists and engineers.",The State of Theory in LGBTQ Aging: Implications for Gerontological Scholarship.,https://www.ncbi.nlm.nih.gov/pubmed/30626272,Research on aging,2019 06 10,"Social research in lesbian, gay, bisexual, transgender, and queer (LGBTQ) aging is a rapidly growing field, but an examination of the use of theory has not yet been conducted for its impact on the field's direction. We conducted a systematic review of empirical articles published in LGBTQ aging in the years 2009-2017 ( N = 102). Using a typology of theory use in scholarly articles, we analyzed these articles for the types of theories being used, the degree to which theories were used in each article, and the analytical function they served. We found that 52% of articles consistently applied theory, 23% implied or partially applied theory, and 25% presented as atheoretical. A wide range of theories were used and served multiple analytical functions such as concept development and explanation of findings. We discuss the strengths and weaknesses of theory use in this body of literature, especially with respect to implications for future knowledge development in the field.",A virtual centralized cytotoxic preparation unit simulation to evaluate the pharmacy staff knowledge.,https://www.ncbi.nlm.nih.gov/pubmed/30626271,Journal of oncology pharmacy practice : official publication of the International Society of Oncology Pharmacy Practitioners,2019 05 13,The risk of medication errors related to drug preparation unit cannot be totally avoided because of human interference.

Recent Evidence From the Korea-U.S. Free Trade Agreement in Korea.,https://www.ncbi.nlm.nih.gov/pubmed/30626258,"International journal of health services : planning, administration, evaluation",2019 03 18,"This study evaluated the effect of the patent linkage system, fully introduced by the Korea-U.S. Free Trade Agreement in 2015, on patent challenges and the effective market exclusivity of new medicines in Korea. We used pharmaceutical approval data and pharmaceutical litigation data to detect new medicines and their counterparts, to collect patent challenges against new medicines, and to calculate effective market exclusivity for new medicines. Then, a nonparametric event history model was applied to statistically explain the duration of the market exclusivity of new medicines. Between 2007 and 2011, a total of 94 new medicines, consisting of 82 new chemical entities and 12 new biologics, were approved. The patent linkage system encouraged patent litigations to occur sooner, with a race to challenge the patents by various generic applicants. However, it was difficult to conclude that patent challenges had a significant impact on the prolongation of effective market exclusivity. The patent linkage system had a neutral effect on the effective market exclusivity of new medicines and encouraged patent challenges without abbreviating effective market exclusivity. In addition, this study highlights an important issue regarding biologics that has not been the subject of market competition, even for patent challenges.",Physical Activity and Risk of Cesarean Delivery in Hispanic Women.,https://www.ncbi.nlm.nih.gov/pubmed/30626257,Journal of physical activity & health,2019 01 24,"Rates of cesarean delivery continue to increase among Hispanics, the largest minority group in the United States.

The life of Giovanni Francesco Barbieri, ""il Guercino"" - the squinter.",https://www.ncbi.nlm.nih.gov/pubmed/30626256,Strabismus,2019 05 21,"To be cross-eyed is a wide-spread dysfunction of the eye and squinting is currently regarded as unattractive. However, in ancient times, societies saw squinting as a sign of piety or even beauty. Even Venus was depicted heterophoric quite often. The most famous artist who was cross-eyed was Giovanni Francesco Barbieri (*08.02.1591; †22.12.1666, both Italy). His nickname was ""Il Guercino"" which means ""the squinter."" This article reflects on vision and art from the perspective of a cross-eyed person.",Clodronate-Loaded Liposome Treatment Has Site-Specific Skeletal Effects.,https://www.ncbi.nlm.nih.gov/pubmed/30626255,Journal of dental research,2019 06 10,"Ineffective oral wound healing is detrimental to patients' oral health-related quality of life. Delineating the cellular mechanisms involved in optimal healing will elicit better approaches to treating patients with compromised healing. Osteal macrophages have recently emerged as important positive regulators of bone turnover. The contributions of macrophages to long bone healing have been studied, but their role in oral osseous wound healing following tooth extraction is less clear. Clodronate-loaded liposomes were used as a tool to deplete macrophages in C57BL/6J mice and assess oral osseous bone fill after extraction. In addition to macrophage ablation, osteoclast ablation occurred. Interestingly, depletion of macrophages and osteoclasts via clodronate treatment had differential effects based on skeletal location. In the nonwounded tibiae, clodronate treatment significantly increased CD68+ cells and decreased F4/80+ cells in the marrow, which correlated with increased trabecular bone volume fraction after 7 and 14 d. Serum formation and resorptive markers P1NP and TRAcP 5b were decreased as were tibial TRAP+ osteoclasts. In healing extraction sockets, clodronate treatment increased extraction socket trabecular bone thickness at 14 d, which correlated with decreased TRAP+ osteoclasts and F4/80+ macrophages. Conversely, nonwounded maxillary interseptal bone was unaffected by clodronate treatment. Furthermore, the increase in extraction socket bone fill with clodronate was less than the large increase in trabecular bone observed in a nonwounded long bone. These data suggest a temporal and spatial specificity in the roles of macrophages and osteoclasts in normal turnover and healing.",Multi-platform analysis of methylation-regulated genes in human lung adenocarcinoma.,https://www.ncbi.nlm.nih.gov/pubmed/30626254,Journal of toxicology and environmental health. Part A,2019 02 26,"Lung adenocarcinoma (LUAD) is the most frequent pathological type of lung cancer that has a poor prognosis and high mortality rate. DNA methylation plays a critical role in various biological processes during development, while dysregulation results in pathological consequences. Thus, this study aimed to identify DNA methylation-regulated genes involved in LUAD occurrence. Initially, 300 downregulated and 168 upregulated mRNA expression levels were identified in two databases: Gene Expression Omnibus (GEO) and The Cancer Genome Atlas. In addition, GEO was utilized to detect 243 DNA hyper-methylated sites. Based on our observations, it was possible to correlate downregulation of mRNA expression and DNA hyper-methylation of six genes (ABCA3, COX7A1, HOXA5, SLIT3, SOX17, and SPARCL1). Functional analysis of the six genes indicated that these genes are predominantly enriched in cancer-related pathways and may promote carcinogenesis by regulating epithelialmesenchymal transition processes. In conclusion, our study identified a panel of DNA methylation-regulated genes involved in LUAD and may serve as potential epigenetic markers for this type of carcinoma.",Plasma asparaginase activity and asparagine depletion in acute lymphoblastic leukemia patients treated with pegaspargase on Children's Oncology Group AALL07P4.,https://www.ncbi.nlm.nih.gov/pubmed/30626253,Leukemia & lymphoma,2019 02 05,"The efficacy of asparaginase in acute lymphoblastic leukemia (ALL) is dependent on depletion of asparagine, an essential amino acid for ALL cells. The target level of plasma asparaginase activity to achieve asparagine depletion has been between 0.05 and 0.4 IU/mL. COG AALL07P4 examined the asparaginase activity and plasma and CSF asparagine concentration of pegaspargase when given intravenously in the treatment of NCI high risk ALL. Matched plasma asparaginase/asparagine levels of the clearance of 54 doses of pegaspargase given in induction or consolidation demonstrated that all patients who had a plasma asparaginase level >0.02 IU/mL had undetectable plasma asparagine. No difference was observed in CSF asparagine levels associated with matched plasma asparaginase levels of 0.02-0.049 versus 0.05-0.22 IU/mL (p = .25). Our data suggest that a plasma asparaginase activity level of 0.02 IU/mL can effectively deplete plasma asparagine. The data also indicate that the 95% CI for plasma asparagine depletion after a pegaspargase dose is 22-29 days.

Thirty patients were treated with the study regimen, consisting of alemtuzumab on day 1 of a 21 day cycle with standard dosing of DA-EPOCH for 6-8 cycles. Alemtuzumab 30 mg IV was used for the phase 2 component. Of 30 treated patients, 17 had a complete response (CR) and eight had a partial response (83.3% overall response rate). The median overall survival and progression-free survival were 20.2 and 6.6 months, respectively. There were five treatment-related deaths on study mainly due to infectious complications, including one case each of disseminated toxoplasmosis and pneumonia and two cases of sepsis. Alemtuzumab with DA-EPOCH is of limited clinical utility due to unacceptable toxicity, despite the high rate of CR.",Increased incidence of obstetric and perinatal complications in pregnancies achieved using donor oocytes and single embryo transfer in young and healthy women. A prospective hospital-based matched cohort study.,https://www.ncbi.nlm.nih.gov/pubmed/30626251,Gynecological endocrinology : the official journal of the International Society of Gynecological Endocrinology,2019 04 22,"In this single-center matched-cohort study, women who underwent IVF/ICSI with donor oocytes between 2007 and 2014 (n = 259) were compared to women undergoing autologous cycles during the same time period (n = 515). The matching (1:2) took into consideration the women's age, type of treatment (IVF/ICSI), and year of embryo transfer. All women were healthy and below 40 years of age at the time of IVF/ICSI, and the treatments were performed using a strict policy of single embryo transfer. Multiple logistic regression analysis, adjusted for body mass index (BMI), smoking, and parity, showed a four times increased risk of gestational hypertensive disorders (adjusted odds ratio, AOR 4.25; 95% confidence interval (CI), 2.61-6.92) and pre-eclampsia (AOR 3.99; 95% CI 2.27-7.00) in pregnancies achieved with donor oocytes. There was also a higher rate of cesarean section in women who gave birth after oocyte donation (AOR 1.69; 95% CI 1.22-2.35) and a higher risk of postpartum hemorrhage >1000 mL (AOR 1.59; 95% CI, 1.11-2.27). After further adjustment for preeclampsia in the logistic regression analysis, no additional increased perinatal risks were found.

Using deep next-generation sequencing we analyzed the mutual composition of ATM and TP53 mutations in 72 MCL patients, and assessed their impact on progression-free survival (PFS) and overall survival (OS). Mutated ATM and TP53 alleles were found in 51% (37/72) and 22% (16/72) of the cases examined, respectively, with only three patients harboring mutations in both genes. Only a mutated TP53 gene was associated with the significantly reduced PFS and OS and the same output was observed when ATM and TP53 defective groups included also sole deletions 11q and 17p, respectively. Determining the exact ATM/p53 pathway dysfunction may influence the selection of MCL patients for innovative therapies based on the targeted inhibition of selected proteins."

A proposal and review.,https://www.ncbi.nlm.nih.gov/pubmed/30626237,Expert review of anti-infective therapy,2019 01 10,"Melioidosis is a significant health problem within endemic areas such as Southeast Asia and Northern Australia. The varied presentation of melioidosis and the intrinsic antibiotic resistance of Burkholderia pseudomallei, the causative organism, make melioidosis a difficult infection to manage. Often prolonged courses of antibiotic treatments are required with no guarantee of clinical success. Areas covered: B. pseudomallei is able to enter phagocytic cells, affect immune function, and replicate, via manipulation of the caspase system. An examination of this mechanism, and a look at other factors in the pathogenesis of melioidosis, shows that there are multiple potential points of therapeutic intervention, some of which may be complementary. These include the directed use of antimicrobial compounds, blocking virulence mechanisms, balancing or modulating cytokine responses, and ameliorating sepsis. Expert commentary: There may be therapeutic options derived from drugs in clinical use for unrelated conditions that may have benefit in melioidosis. Key compounds of interest primarily affect the disequilibrium of the cytokine response, and further preclinical work is needed to explore the utility of this approach and encourage the clinical research needed to bring these into beneficial use.",β-Thalassemia Mutations in Jamaica: Geographic Variation in Small Communities.,https://www.ncbi.nlm.nih.gov/pubmed/30626236,Hemoglobin,2019 05 14,"Over the last 43 years, surveys of over 200,000 subjects in Jamaica have identified β-thalassemia (β-thal) mutations. In most, these genes were detected at birth in patients with sickle cell-β-thal and so the prevalence and distribution would not be influenced by subsequent clinical course. There were two newborn populations, 100,000 deliveries in the corporate area between 1973-1981 and 84,940 in south and western Jamaica between 2008-2016. A third population, which derived from the Manchester Project in central Jamaica, screened 16,612 secondary school children, aged predominantly 15-19 years, and identified 150 students with the β-thal trait and 11 with sickle cell [Hb S (HBB: c.20A>T)]- or Hb C (HBB: c.19G>A)-β-thal. The latter patients may have been subject to symptomatic selection, but this should not have affected those with β-thal trait. Of the 24 different molecular mutations, β0-thal genes accounted for 10.0-27.0% of these groups and most common was IVS-II-849 (A>G) (HBB: c.316-2A>G). Of the β+ mutations, seven subjects had severe genes with low levels of β chain synthesis but the majority were benign mutations in the promoter region. The -29 (A>G) (HBB: c.-79A>G) mutation dominated in the newborn study in Kingston, similar to experiences in Guadeloupe and African Americans but the -88 (C>T) (HBB: c.-138C>T) mutation was more common among school students in central Jamaica. Caribbean populations are genetically heterogeneous but variations within different parts of Jamaica is of potential importance for prenatal diagnosis and genetic counseling. This information may also be useful among the large Jamaican diaspora.",Neurodevelopmental disorders in children exposed in utero to synthetic progestins: analysis from the national cohort of the Hhorages Association.,https://www.ncbi.nlm.nih.gov/pubmed/30626235,Gynecological endocrinology : the official journal of the International Society of Gynecological Endocrinology,2019 03 26,"The medical and scientific communities have not yet fully acknowledged the undesirable effects of the synthetic hormones that have been administered to pregnant women for decades. The somatic effects of in utero exposure to diethylstilbestrol (DES), such as genital malformations, infertility, and cancer, have long been recognized but this has not been the case concerning psychiatric disorders. The progestins used in contraception and hormone replacement therapy are known to affect the adult brain, but no data exist on their effects due to in utero exposure of children. The Hhorages Association, a national patient support group, has assembled a cohort of 1200 women who took synthetic hormones during pregnancy. These women had a combined 1934 children. We obtained full questionnaire responses from 46 women treated with progestins only - and not an estrogenic cocktail - who gave birth to 115 children. Three groups were observed: Group 1 (n = 18): firstborn unexposed children, Group 2 (n = 62): children exposed in utero to synthetic progestins, and Group 3 (n = 35): children born after a previous pregnancy treated with progestins. No psychiatric disorders were reported in Group 1 and the incidence of psychiatric disorders was drastically elevated in Group 2. Our work shows a striking increase in psychiatric disorders among children exposed in utero to progestins and strongly suggests that prenatal exposure is associated with a high risk of psychiatric disorders in adolescence and adulthood, whether accompanied or not by disorders of sex development.",Oxidation of fish oil supplements in Australia.,https://www.ncbi.nlm.nih.gov/pubmed/30626234,International journal of food sciences and nutrition,2019 06 03,"Fish oils oxidise readily, forming primary and secondary oxidation products, which may be harmful for humans.

Areas covered: The Middle East (ME) region is significantly behind in generating and using RWE in health policy decisions due to several factors that shaped the health sector over the past few decades. The trend, however, is changing due to several factors that are shaping the future of the healthcare industry in the region. Among other factors, rising healthcare cost, changing population and disease demographics, increased focus on the quality of healthcare, digitization of medical data, increased demand for local clinical and economic data, and overall greater influence of global trends in the healthcare industry. For the region to realize the benefit of RWE in healthcare decisions, it needs to overcome several challenges including embracing the value that RWE brings to healthcare decisions, building trust between stakeholders, establishing reliability and validity of databases used to generate RWE, enhancing technical capabilities, investing in local data generation, and conducting high-quality RWE studies while maintaining patients' confidentiality. Expert commentary: We believe that the next decade will witness significant increase in RWE generation in the region, and will play a key role in driving efficiency in healthcare delivery.",The effect of myoinositol on ovarian blood flows in women with polycystic ovary syndrome.,https://www.ncbi.nlm.nih.gov/pubmed/30626230,Gynecological endocrinology : the official journal of the International Society of Gynecological Endocrinology,2019 03 26,"To evaluate whether 4 gram myoinositol and 400 mcg folic acid(MYO) therapy has any effects on ovarian stromal blood flow by using pulsed and color Doppler at 3 months follow-up period in polycystic ovary syndrome (PCOS).

Pre-designed PCR/Sanger or Sequencing Primer and TaqMan® SNP Genotyping Assays were used for the SNP genotyping of the GPR30 gene. Immunohistochemical staining was performed to confirm the GPR30 expression. Differences in genotype and allele frequencies between the two groups were calculated using Fisher's exact test. The rs3802141 CT genotype was more common in the control group (p = .02), and the rs4266553 CC genotype was more common in the adenomyosis group (p = .02). The C allele of the SNP rs4266553 was more common in the adenomyosis group (p = .02). GPR30 expression was confirmed in 69 individuals in both groups.

A 21-year old female sickle cell disease patient [Hb S (HBB: c.20A>T)/β-thalassemia (β-thal)] presented at our Adult Thalassaemia Unit, Hippokration General Hospital of Thessaloniki, Thessaloniki, Greece, with headaches, perioral numbness and pain in both antibrachia. The patient was admitted with the diagnosis of vaso-occlussive crisis (VOC) and treated symptomatically. On her third day of admission, due to hemoglobin (Hb) value of 6.9 g/dL with increase in reticulocytes, the patient was transfused with one unit of compatible leukodepleted red blood cells (RBC). The following day, hemolytic parameters increased, although Coombs, panel antibodies and screening tests were negative. Five days later, she again received a unit of RBCs, resulting in another increase of hemolytic parameters. During the following 2 days, there was a dramatic decrease of Hb levels to 5.4 g/dL with reticulocytes at 6.0%, negative Coombs testing and negative alloantibodies. Based on these findings, we recognized the syndrome of DHTR with hyperhemolysis.

To determine whether such symptoms can be treated with herbal medication containing black cohosh in the form of isopropanolic Cimicifuga racemosa extract (iCR) alone or in fixed combination with St John's wort (Hypericum perforatum [HP]) (iCR + HP), a systematic literature search was conducted. Results were viewed in relation to experimental data and metabolism of endocrine therapies. Most breast cancer survivors receiving endocrine therapy experienced reductions in climacteric symptoms under iCR/iCR + HP. Tamoxifen's interference potential may be countered by using higher iCR doses or iCR + HP. No estrogen-like effects at the breast or on hormones were seen. After breast cancer, even if receiving tamoxifen, patients using iCR/iCR + HP had significantly increased recurrence-free survival rates compared to non-users. These results are substantiated by experimental data demonstrating antiproliferative and anti-invasive effects of iCR in breast cancer cells and enhancement of the antineoplastic effects of tamoxifen. There are no known clinical interactions for iCR and HP with endocrine therapies. The HP extract used in iCR + HP did not exhibit any clinically relevant interaction potential. In conclusion, with its positive benefit-risk profile, iCR/iCR + HP may offer a safe non-hormonal therapeutic option for breast cancer survivors receiving endocrine therapy.",Measuring Treatment Response in Pharmacological and Lifestyle Interventions Using Electroencephalography in ADHD: A Review.,https://www.ncbi.nlm.nih.gov/pubmed/30626211,Clinical EEG and neuroscience,2019 05 31,"Attention-deficit/hyperactivity disorder (ADHD) is a neurodevelopmental disorder characterized by inattention, hyperactivity, and/or impulsivity with associations to short- and long-term aversive life events.

Quantitative electroencephalography (EEG) has been proposed as a potential way to differentiate those with ADHD from typically developing controls; however, the data on the diagnostic utility of this approach have been variable. Quantitative EEG has been employed in prognostic ways to assess differences in baseline spectral power profiles and pharmacological and nonpharmacological treatment effects on electrocortical activity within the ADHD population.

Approach and Results- Metabonomic screen of eEVs from cigarette-smoking human subjects reveals prominent elevation of spermine-a polyamine metabolite with potent agonist activity for the extracellular CaSR (calcium-sensing receptor). CaSR inhibition with the negative allosteric modulator Calhex231 or CaSR knockdown attenuates cigarette smoke-induced pulmonary hypertension in rats without emphysematous changes in lungs or chronic hypoxemia. Cigarette smoke exposure increases the generation of spermine-positive eEVs and their spermine content. Immunocytochemical staining and immunogold electron microscopy recognize the spermine enrichment not only within the cytosol but also on the outer surface of eEV membrane. The repression of spermine synthesis, the inhibitory analog of spermine, N1-dansyl-spermine, Calhex231, or CaSR knockdown profoundly suppresses eEV exposure-mobilized cytosolic calcium signaling, pulmonary artery constriction, and smooth muscle cell proliferation. Confocal imaging of immunohistochemical staining demonstrates the migration of spermine-positive eEVs from endothelium into smooth muscle cells in pulmonary arteries of cigarette smoke-exposed rats. The repression of spermine synthesis or CaSR knockout results in attenuated development of pulmonary hypertension induced by an intravascular administration of eEVs. Conclusions- Cigarette smoke enhances eEV generation with spermine enrichment at their outer surface and cytosol, which activates CaSR and subsequently causes smooth muscle cell constriction and proliferation, therefore, directly leading to the development of pulmonary hypertension.",TLR2 Promotes Vascular Smooth Muscle Cell Chondrogenic Differentiation and Consequent Calcification via the Concerted Actions of Osteoprotegerin Suppression and IL-6-Mediated RANKL Induction.,https://www.ncbi.nlm.nih.gov/pubmed/30626205,"Arteriosclerosis, thrombosis, and vascular biology",2019 02 27,"Objective- Vascular smooth muscle cell (VSMC) transformation to an osteochondrogenic phenotype is an initial step toward arterial calcification, which is highly correlated with cardiovascular disease-related morbidity and mortality. TLR2 (Toll-like receptor 2) plays a pathogenic role in the development of vascular diseases, but its regulation in calcification of arteries and VSMCs remains unclear. We postulate that TLR2-mediated inflammation participates in mediating atherosclerotic arterial calcification and VSMC calcification. Approach and Results- We found that ApoE-/- Tlr2-/- genotype in mice suppressed high-fat diet-induced atherosclerotic plaques formation during initiation but progressively lost its preventative capacity, compared with ApoE-/- mice. However, TLR2 deficiency prohibited high-fat diet-induced advanced atherosclerotic calcification, chondrogenic metaplasia, and OPG (osteoprotegerin) downregulation in the calcified lesions. Incubation of VSMCs in a calcifying medium revealed that TLR2 agonists significantly increased VSMC calcification and chondrogenic differentiation. Furthermore, TLR2 deficiency suppressed TLR2 agonist-mediated VSMC chondrogenic differentiation and consequent calcification, which were triggered via the concerted actions of IL (interleukin)-6-mediated RANKL (receptor activator of nuclear factor κB ligand) induction and OPG suppression. Inhibition experiments with pharmacological inhibitors demonstrated that IL-6-mediated RANKL induction is signaled by p38 and ERK1/2 (extracellular signal-regulated kinase 1/2) pathways, whereas the OPG is suppressed via NF-κB (nuclear factor κB) dependent signaling mediated by ERK1/2. Conclusions- We concluded that on ligand binding, TLR2 activates p38 and ERK1/2 signaling to selectively modulate the upregulation of IL-6-mediated RANKL and downregulation of OPG. These signaling pathways act in concert to induce chondrogenic transdifferentiation of VSMCs, which in turn leads to vascular calcification during the pathogenesis of atherosclerosis."

However, undertaking Master's level education can be challenging, particularly when this is undertaken alongside full-time work and family/domestic commitments. To illuminate this student experience further, this paper takes a case study approach to explore the experiences of three students who have successfully completed a Master's programme in dementia care in the North West of England. Their individual and collective experiences highlight the challenges of juggling competing demands and the dynamic processes of navigating the student journey and continually negotiating supports in order to successfully complete the course.

It is unclear, however, how the effects of such interventions are maintained when interventions are withdrawn. We explored resiliency of people living with HIV in coping with adherence to antiretroviral therapy (ART) after withdrawing an adherence support intervention of real-time adherence monitors linked to SMS text messages at study closure. This is a qualitative study conducted with former participants of a pilot randomized controlled trial after study closure. Between April 2016 and November 2016, we used convenient sampling to interview 28 of the 62 participants from the pilot trial, which was conducted in rural Uganda. Interviews elicited information on experiences of taking ART in the absence of the intervention, coping strategies, and changes in social support interactions. Data were analyzed inductively using content analysis. Most participants demonstrated resilience through learning adherence from the intervention; and internalizing the habit of medication adherence. They seemed to have a sense of self-esteem, positive thinking, and access to supportive relationships. Other participants employed adaptive coping strategies, such as using alternative cues (e.g., alarms), accessing spiritual support, and adjusting their medication time to their routine. A few participants lacked resiliency, lost the habit and struggled with adherence. They were dependent on the intervention, appeared isolated and psychologically stressed, and were unable to overcome challenges associated with poor social support systems. Intervention-related benefits may or may not persist after the intervention is withdrawn. Contingent on individuals"" underlying characteristics and relationships, participants manifested resiliency through learning and internalization, as well as using alternative coping strategies. Such resiliency could facilitate the use of short-term interventions, which are particularly important for resource-limited settings. Participants should be referred to available additional support at study closure when needed.",Synthesis of Mesoporous/Macroporous Microparticles Using Three-Dimensional Assembly of Chitosan-Functionalized Halloysite Nanotubes and Their Performance in the Adsorptive Removal of Oil Droplets from Water.,https://www.ncbi.nlm.nih.gov/pubmed/30626190,Langmuir : the ACS journal of surfaces and colloids,2019 02 12,"Halloysite nanotubes (HNTs) were assembled into mesoporous/macroporous microparticles (c-g-HNTs MPs) using Pickering template-assisted approach. To unravel the stabilization mechanism in Pickering emulsion form, several emulsions and microparticles were prepared at various conditions and visualized using confocal laser scanning microscopy. The prepared c-g-HNTs MPs were used to treat emulsified oil solutions resulting in a maximum removal efficiency of 94.47%. The kinetics data of oil adsorption onto c-g-HNTs MPs was best fitted by the pseudo-second-order kinetic model ( R2 = 0.9983). The maximum monolayer adsorption capacity of oil onto c-g-HNTs MPs as predicted by the multilayer Brunauer-Emmett-Teller model was found to be 788 mg/g. Compared with pristine HNTs, c-g-HNTs MPs exhibited higher self-settleability rates in aqueous solutions as well as in emulsified oil solutions, demonstrating their candidacy for practical water treatment applications. The c-g-HNTs MPs were repeatedly used for five adsorption-desorption cycles with minimal losses noticed in their performance.",Microfluidic Formation of Hydrogel Microcapsules with a Single Aqueous Core by Spontaneous Cross-Linking in Aqueous Two-Phase System Droplets.,https://www.ncbi.nlm.nih.gov/pubmed/30626189,Langmuir : the ACS journal of surfaces and colloids,2019 02 12,"We report a simple process to fabricate monodisperse tetra-arm poly(ethylene glycol) (tetra-PEG) hydrogel microcapsules with an aqueous core and a semipermeable hydrogel shell through the formation of aqueous two-phase system (ATPS) droplets consisting of a dextran-rich core and a tetra-PEG macromonomer-rich shell, followed by a spontaneous cross-end coupling reaction of tetra-PEG macromonomers in the shell. Different from conventional techniques, this process enables for the continuous production of hydrogel microcapsules from water-in-oil emulsion droplets under mild conditions in the absence of radical initiators and external stimuli such as heating and ultraviolet light irradiation. We find that rapid cross-end coupling reaction of tetra-PEG macromonomers in ATPS droplets in the range of pH from 7.4 to 7.8 gives hydrogel microcapsules with a kinetically arrested core-shell structure. The diameter and core-shell ratio of the microcapsules can be easily controlled by adjusting flow rates and ATPS compositions. On the other hand, the slow cross-end coupling reaction of tetra-PEG macromonomers in ATPS droplets at pH 7.0 and lower induces structural change from core-shell to Janus during the reaction, which eventually forms hydrogel microparticles with a thermodynamically stable crescent structure. We believe that these hydrogel microparticles with controlled structures can be used in biomedical fields such as cell encapsulation, biosensors, and drug delivery carriers for sensitive biomolecules.",Steric and Electronic Effects of Electrochemically Generated Aryl Radicals on Grafting of the Graphite Surface.,https://www.ncbi.nlm.nih.gov/pubmed/30626188,Langmuir : the ACS journal of surfaces and colloids,2019 02 12,"Grafting of aryl radicals generated by electrochemical reduction of aryldiazonium salts has been extensively studied on various surfaces. However, there exists two unclear aspects; the first one is the generality of the blocking ability of simple functional groups toward multilayer growth, and the second one is the electronic impact of substituent groups of aryl radicals on grafting efficiency. To address these aspects, we have studied the electrochemical functionalization of graphite using aryldiazonium salts having electron-donating or electron-withdrawing groups at the 3,4,5-positions. Atomic force microscopy investigation of the functionalized surfaces revealed the formation of monolayers for all aryldiazonium salts, and thus, nitro, carboxy, ester, methyl, and methoxy groups at the 3,4,5-positions of the benzene ring suppress polyaryl growth. The degree of grafting estimated by scanning tunneling microscopy imaging and Raman spectroscopy of the functionalized surfaces depends on the electronic state of the aryl radicals, in which the radicals with electron-donating groups show a high degree of functionalization, whereas those with electron-withdrawing groups exhibit a low degree of functionalization. We discuss several possibilities that affect grafting density. Though there are several factors, we hypothesize that one factor to explain the observed reactivity trend is the electronic property of the aryl radicals, namely, the relative position of the singly occupied molecular orbital energy levels of the aryl radicals with respect to the graphite Fermi energy level.",Giant-Shell CdSe/CdS Nanocrystals: Exciton Coupling to Shell Phonons Investigated by Resonant Raman Spectroscopy.,https://www.ncbi.nlm.nih.gov/pubmed/30626187,The journal of physical chemistry letters,2019 02 15,"The interaction between excitons and phonons in semiconductor nanocrystals plays a crucial role in the exciton energy spectrum and dynamics, and thus in their optical properties. We investigate the exciton-phonon coupling in giant-shell CdSe/CdS core-shell nanocrystals via resonant Raman spectroscopy. The Huang-Rhys parameter is evaluated by the intensity ratio of the longitudinal-optical (LO) phonon of CdS with its first multiscattering (2LO) replica. We used four different excitation wavelengths in the range from the onset of the CdS shell absorption to well above the CdS shell band edge to get insight into resonance effects of the CdS LO phonon with high-energy excitonic transitions. The isotropic spherical giant-shell nanocrystals show consistently stronger exciton-phonon coupling as compared to the anisotropic rod-shaped dot-in-rod (DiR) architecture, and the 2LO/LO intensity ratio decreases for excitation wavelengths approaching the CdS band edge. The strong exciton-phonon coupling in the spherical giant-shell nanocrystals can be related to the delocalization of the electronic wave functions. Furthermore, we observe the radial breathing modes of the GS nanocrystals and their overtones by ultralow frequency Raman spectroscopy with nonresonant excitation, using laser energies well below the band gap of the heteronanocrystals, and highlight the differences between higher-order optical and acoustic phonon modes.",Graded-Index Fluoropolymer Antireflection Coatings for Invisible Plastic Optics.,https://www.ncbi.nlm.nih.gov/pubmed/30626186,Nano letters,2019 03 19,"Plastic optics are used in an ever-expanding range of applications and yet a durable, high performance antireflection (AR) coating remains elusive for this material class. Here, we introduce a sacrificial porogen approach to produce ultralow refractive index nanoporous fluoropolymer AR coatings via thermal coevaporation of Teflon AF and the small molecule N, N'-bis(3-methylphenyl)- N, N'-diphenylbenzidine (NPD). Using this approach, we demonstrate a five-layer, step-graded AR coating that reduces the solar spectrum-averaged (400 < λ < 2000 nm) reflectance of acrylic plastic to <0.5% for incidence angles up to 40° and withstands over 3 months of outdoor rooftop exposure with minimal degradation. A trilayer coating optimized for the visible range yields luminous reflectivity down to ∼0.1%, effectively rendering double-side coated acrylic plastic invisible under room lighting conditions. Strong adhesion to most optical plastics, an outstanding combination of mechanical, chemical, and environmental durability, and compatibility with commercial vacuum coating systems should enable this AR technology to find widespread practical use.","Secondary Organic Aerosol Formation from Aromatic Alkene Ozonolysis: Influence of the Precursor Structure on Yield, Chemical Composition, and Mechanism.",https://www.ncbi.nlm.nih.gov/pubmed/30626185,The journal of physical chemistry. A,2019 02 25,"The influence of the precursor chemical structure on secondary organic aerosol (SOA) formation was investigated through the study of the ozonolysis of two anthropogenic aromatic alkenes: 2-methylstyrene and indene. Experiments were carried out in three different simulation chambers: ICARE 7300L FEP Teflon chamber (ICARE, Orléans, France), EUPHORE FEP Teflon chamber (CEAM, Valencia, Spain), and CESAM evacuable stainless steel chamber (LISA, Créteil, France). For both precursors, SOA yield and growth were studied on a large range of initial concentrations (from ∼60 ppbv to 1.9 ppmv) and the chemical composition of both gaseous and particulate phases was investigated at a molecular level. Gas phase was described using FTIR spectroscopy and online gas chromatography coupled to mass spectrometry, and particulate chemical composition was analyzed (i) online by thermo-desorption coupled to chemical ionization mass spectrometry and (ii) offline by supercritical fluid extraction coupled to gas chromatography and mass spectrometry. The results obtained from a large set of experiments performed in three different chambers and using several complementary analytical techniques were in very good agreement. SOA yield was up to 10 times higher for indene ozonolysis than for 2-methylstyrene ozonolysis at the same reaction advancement. For 2-methylstyrene ozonolysis, formaldehyde and o-tolualdehyde were the two main gaseous phase products while o-toluic acid was the most abundant among six products detected within the particulate phase. For indene ozonolysis, traces of formic and phthalic acids as well as 11 species were detected in the gaseous phase and 11 other products were quantified in the particulate phase, where phthaldialdehyde was the main product. On the basis of the identified products, reaction mechanisms were proposed that highlight specific pathways due to the precursor chemical structure. These mechanisms were finally compared and discussed regarding SOA formation. In the case of 2-methylstyrene ozonolysis, ozone adds mainly on the external and monosubstituted double bond, yielding only one C8- and monofunctionalized Criegee intermediate and hence more volatile products as well as lower SOA mass than indene ozonolysis in similar experimental conditions. In the case of indene, ozone adds mainly on the five-carbon-ring and disubstituted C═C double bond, leading to the formation of two C9- and bifunctionalized Criegee intermediates, which then evolve via different pathways including the hydroperoxide channel and form highly condensable first-generation products."

In addition to attitudes, subjective norms and perceived behavioral control, the model included risk perception, trust, and actual purchases. Using a structural equation model, our results provided support to the hypothesis that consumer perceptions of risk negatively impacted their purchase behaviors and suggested that increasing Italians' trust in government information could reduce their perceived risk and, consequently, increase their intention to purchase regional food.","PM2.5-Bound Toxic Elements in an Urban City in East China: Concentrations, Sources, and Health Risks.",https://www.ncbi.nlm.nih.gov/pubmed/30626168,International journal of environmental research and public health,2019 05 22,"Concentrations of PM2.5-bound trace elements have increased in China, with increasing anthropogenic emissions. In this study, long-term measurements of PM2.5-bound trace elements were conducted from January 2014 to January 2015 in the urban city of Jinan, east China. A positive matrix factorization model (PMF) and health risk assessment were used to evaluate the sources and health risks of these elements, respectively. Compared with most Chinese megacities, there were higher levels of arsenic, manganese, lead, chromium, and zinc in this city. Coal combustion, the smelting industry, vehicle emission, and soil dust were identified as the primary sources of all the measured elements. Heating activities during the heating period led to a factor of 1.3⁻2.8 higher concentrations for PM2.5 and all measured elements than those during the non-heating period.

Recently published works on the mechanochemical synthesis of LDH were first introduced to provide a comprehensive summary on the preparation of the materials. Ensuing discussion provided an overview of recent research on the applications of M-LDH products as adsorbents and catalysts. The excellent adsorption performance and fast adsorption rate of the precursor of LDH produced by dry milling of raw materials was identified. The catalytic performances of M-LDH as catalysts, mainly photocatalysts, were then introduced. It is foreseeable that by rational utilization of mechanochemical processes and the unique chemical properties of M-LDH, increasing numbers of applications using M-LDH could be expected.","Dietary Protein Intake, Protein Energy Wasting, and the Progression of Chronic Kidney Disease: Analysis from the KNOW-CKD Study.",https://www.ncbi.nlm.nih.gov/pubmed/30626166,Nutrients,2019 03 20,"Studies on the effect of dietary protein intake (DPI) on chronic kidney disease (CKD) progression, along with the potential hazard of protein-energy wasting (PEW), are scarce. We evaluated the association between DPI and kidney function both cross-sectionally and longitudinally, particularly emphasizing the role of PEW, in a large-scale, observational, multicenter, prospective study. We enrolled 1572 patients with non-dialysis CKD between 2011 and 2016. CKD progression was defined by a >50% estimated glomerular filtration rate (eGFR) decrease, serum creatinine doubling, or dialysis initiation. A Cox proportional hazard regression analysis was conducted. During the mean follow-up period of 41.6 months, CKD progression was observed in 296 patients. Cross-sectionally, increased DPI was significantly associated with increased eGFR. Similarly, increased DPI tertile was significantly associated with increased renal survival in a Kaplan⁻Meier curve analysis. In the multivariate Cox proportional hazard regression analysis, the statistical significance of the DPI tertile group in CKD progression was lost when PEW-related variables were added as covariates. In penalized spline curve analysis, the adjusted odds ratio of PEW significantly increased as DPI decreased. DPI, per se was not a major determinant of CKD progression. An intimate association between reduced DPI and PEW may be a more important predictor of CKD progression than DPI.",Higher-Order Thermo-Elastic Analysis of FG-CNTRC Cylindrical Vessels Surrounded by a Pasternak Foundation.,https://www.ncbi.nlm.nih.gov/pubmed/30626165,"Nanomaterials (Basel, Switzerland)",2019 02 07,"This study analyses the two-dimensional thermo-elastic response of functionally graded carbon nanotube-reinforced composite (FG-CNTRC) cylindrical pressure vessels, by applying the third-order shear deformation theory (TSDT). The effective properties of FG-CNTRC cylindrical pressure vessels are computed for different patterns of reinforcement, according to the rule of mixture. The governing equations of the problem are derived from the principle of virtual works and are solved as a classical eigenproblem under the assumption of clamped supported boundary conditions. A large parametric investigation aims at showing the influence of some meaningful parameters on the thermo-elastic response, such as the type of pattern, the volume fraction of CNTs, and the Pasternak coefficients related to the elastic foundation.",Pro-Degradant Activity of Naturally Occurring Compounds on Polyethylene in Accelerate Weathering Conditions.,https://www.ncbi.nlm.nih.gov/pubmed/30626164,"Materials (Basel, Switzerland)",2019 01 23,"In this work, naturally occurring compounds, such as Vitamin E (VE) and Ferulic Acid (FA), at high concentrations, have been considered as pro-degradant agents for Low Density Polyethylene (PE). However, all obtained results using the naturally occurring molecules as pro-oxidant agents for PE have been compared with the results achieved using a classical pro-oxidant agent, such as calcium stearate (Ca stearate) and with neat PE. The preliminary characterization, through rheological, mechanical and thermal analysis, of the PE-based systems highlights that the used naturally occurring molecules are able to exert a slight plasticizing action on PE and subsequently the PE rigidity and crystallinity slightly decrease, while the ductility increases. To assess the pro-degradant activity of the considered naturally occurring compounds, thin films of neat PE and PE-based systems containing 2 and 3 wt.% Ca stearate, VE and FA have been produced and subjected to accelerated weathering upon UVB light exposure. All obtained results point out that the VE and FA, at these high concentrations, exert a clear pro-oxidant activity in PE and this pro-oxidant activity is very similar to that exerted by Ca stearate. Moreover, the VE and FA at high concentrations can be considered as suitable eco-friendly pro-degradant additives for PE, also in order to control the polyolefin degradation times.",Factors Affecting Vitamin D Status in Infants.,https://www.ncbi.nlm.nih.gov/pubmed/30626163,"Children (Basel, Switzerland)",2019 02 03,"Vitamin D is critical to children's skeletal development and health. Despite this, the factors which determine vitamin D concentrations during infancy remain incompletely understood. This article reviews the literature assessing the factors which can affect vitamin D status in infancy, including antenatal and postnatal vitamin D supplementation. Observational data supports that dietary intake of vitamin D, UV exposure, and geographic factors contribute significantly to infants' vitamin D status, but the relationship is unclear regarding genetic variation, ethnicity, and maternal vitamin D status. Randomised controlled trials have compared higher versus lower doses of infant vitamin D supplementation, but no studies have compared infant vitamin D supplementation to placebo and eliminated external sources of vitamin D to fully quantify its effect on vitamin D status. Knowledge gaps remain regarding the factors associated with optimal vitamin D concentrations in infants-including key factors such as ethnicity and genetic variation-and further studies are needed.",Implicit Calibration Using Probable Fixation Targets.,https://www.ncbi.nlm.nih.gov/pubmed/30626162,"Sensors (Basel, Switzerland)",2019 01 24,"Proper calibration of eye movement signal registered by an eye tracker seems to be one of the main challenges in popularizing eye trackers as yet another user-input device. Classic calibration methods taking time and imposing unnatural behavior on eyes must be replaced by intelligent methods that are able to calibrate the signal without conscious cooperation by the user. Such an implicit calibration requires some knowledge about the stimulus a user is looking at and takes into account this information to predict probable gaze targets. This paper describes a possible method to perform implicit calibration: it starts with finding probable fixation targets (PFTs), then it uses these targets to build a mapping-probable gaze path. Various algorithms that may be used for finding PFTs and mappings are presented in the paper and errors are calculated using two datasets registered with two different types of eye trackers. The results show that although for now the implicit calibration provides results worse than the classic one, it may be comparable with it and sufficient for some applications.",Pulmonary Metastasectomy in Pediatric Solid Tumors.,https://www.ncbi.nlm.nih.gov/pubmed/30626161,"Children (Basel, Switzerland)",2019 02 03,"Metastatic disease and the complications of treating metastatic disease are the primary causes of mortality in children with solid malignancies. Nearly 25% of children with solid tumors have metastatic disease at initial diagnosis and another 20% develop metastases during or after treatment. The most common location of these metastases is the lung. The role of surgery in metastatic disease depends greatly on the histology of the primary. In general, tumors that are refractory to adjuvant therapies are most appropriate for pulmonary metastasectomy. This article will summarize the indications for metastasectomy in pediatric solid tumors and discuss the ongoing debate over the technique of metastasectomy in osteosarcoma."

We hypothesized that inherent characteristics of the eater (constitutive factors) also play a role. The aim of this proof-of-concept study was to determine the role of gender, as an individual constitutive factor, on the meal-related experience. Randomized parallel trial in 10 women and 10 men, comparing the sensations before, during, and after stepwise ingestion of a comfort meal up to full satiation. Comparisons were performed by repeated Analysis of Covariance (ANCOVA) measures. During stepwise ingestion, satisfaction initially increased up to a peak, and later decreased down to a nadir at the point of full satiation. Interestingly, the amount of food consumed at the well-being peak was lower, and induced significantly less fullness in women than in men. Hence, men required a larger meal load and stronger homeostatic sensations to achieve satisfaction. The same pattern was observed at the level of full satiation: men ate more and still experienced positive well-being, whereas in women, well-being scores dropped below pre-meal level. The effect of gender on the ingestion experience suggests that other constitutive factors of the eater may also influence responses to meals.",Decoupling of Airborne Dynamic Bending Deformation Angle and Its Application in the High-Accuracy Transfer Alignment Process.,https://www.ncbi.nlm.nih.gov/pubmed/30626146,"Sensors (Basel, Switzerland)",2019 01 24,"In the traditional airborne distributed position and orientation system (DPOS) transfer alignment process, the coupling angle between the dynamic deformation and body angular motion is not estimated or compensated, which causes the process to have low precision and long convergence time. To achieve high-precision transfer alignment, a decoupling method for the airborne dynamic deformation angle is proposed in this paper. The model of the coupling angle is established through mathematical derivation. Then, taking the coupling angle into consideration, angular velocity error and velocity error between the master INS and slave IMU are corrected. Based on this, a novel 27-state Kalman filter model is established. Simulation results demonstrate that, compared with the traditional transfer alignment model, the model proposed in this paper has faster convergence time and higher accuracy.",The Controversial Role of Homocysteine in Neurology: From Labs to Clinical Practice.,https://www.ncbi.nlm.nih.gov/pubmed/30626145,International journal of molecular sciences,2019 04 26,"Homocysteine (Hcy) is a sulfur-containing amino acid that is generated during methionine metabolism. Physiologic Hcy levels are determined primarily by dietary intake and vitamin status. Elevated plasma levels of Hcy can be caused by deficiency of either vitamin B12 or folate. Hyperhomocysteinemia (HHcy) can be responsible of different systemic and neurological disease. Actually, HHcy has been considered as a risk factor for systemic atherosclerosis and cardiovascular disease (CVD) and HHcy has been reported in many neurologic disorders including cognitive impairment and stroke, independent of long-recognized factors such as hyperlipidemia, hypertension, diabetes mellitus, and smoking. HHcy is typically defined as levels >15 micromol/L. Treatment of hyperhomocysteinemia with folic acid and B vitamins seems to be effective in the prevention of the development of atherosclerosis, CVD, and strokes. However, data from literature show controversial results regarding the significance of homocysteine as a risk factor for CVD and stroke and whether patients should be routinely screened for homocysteine. HHcy-induced oxidative stress, endothelial dysfunction, inflammation, smooth muscle cell proliferation, and endoplasmic reticulum (ER) stress have been considered to play an important role in the pathogenesis of several diseases including atherosclerosis and stroke. The aim of our research is to review the possible role of HHcy in neurodegenerative disease and stroke and to understand its pathogenesis.",Extended Multiple Aperture Mapdrift-Based Doppler Parameter Estimation and Compensation for Very-High-Squint Airborne SAR Imaging.,https://www.ncbi.nlm.nih.gov/pubmed/30626144,"Sensors (Basel, Switzerland)",2019 01 24,"Doppler parameter estimation and compensation (DPEC) is an important technique for airborne SAR imaging due to the unpredictable disturbance of real aircraft trajectory. Traditional DPEC methods can be only applied for broadside, small- or medium-squint geometries, as they at most consider the spatial variance of the second-order Doppler phase. To implement the DPEC in very-high-squint geometries, we propose an extended multiple aperture mapdrift (EMAM) method in this paper for better accuracy. This advantage is achieved by further estimating and compensating the spatial variation of the third-order Doppler phase, i.e., the derivative of the Doppler rate. The main procedures of the EMAM, including the steps of sub-view image generation, sliding-window-based cross-correlation, and image-offset-based Doppler parameter estimation, are derived in detail, followed by the analyses for the EMAM performance. The presented approach is evaluated by both computer simulations and real airborne data.",Does a Good Firm Breed Good Organizational Citizens? The Moderating Role of Perspective Taking.,https://www.ncbi.nlm.nih.gov/pubmed/30626143,International journal of environmental research and public health,2019 05 22,"Although some previous studies have examined the impact of corporate social responsibility (CSR) on employees in an organization, they have mainly focused on employees' perceptions or attitudes rather than behaviors. However, in that employees' behaviors are the direct outcome of the perceptions or attitudes and critically affect organizational outcomes, we need to investigate the impact of CSR on employees' behaviors. Based on the context-attitude-behavior framework, we investigate the underlying process of the association between CSR and employees' behavior with a moderated mediation model. Specifically, we hypothesize (1) the intermediating effect of organizational commitment (OC) in the association between CSR and organizational citizenship behavior (OCB) and (2) the contingent role of employees' perspective taking ability (PT) in the CSR-OC link. Using three-wave survey data from 301 currently working employees in Korea, we found that OC mediates the association between CSR and OCB and that PT can positively moderate the CSR-OC link. Our findings suggest that OC (as an intermediating process) and PT (as a contingent factor) function as important underlying mechanisms to elaborately describe the CSR-OCB link.","Monitoring Antifungal Agents of Artemisia annua against Fusarium oxysporum and Fusarium solani, Associated with Panax notoginseng Root-Rot Disease.",https://www.ncbi.nlm.nih.gov/pubmed/30626142,"Molecules (Basel, Switzerland)",2019 03 21,"Root rot of Panax notoginseng has received great attention due to its threat on the plantation and sustainable utilization of P. notoginseng.

In this study, we found that the methanol extract from Artemisia annua leaves has strong antifungal effects on the growth of Fusarium oxysporum and Fusarium solani resulting into root-rot disease. Essential oil (EO) thereof was found to be the most active. GC-MS analysis revealed 58 ingredients and camphor, camphene, β-caryophyllene, and germacrene D were identified as the major ingredients. Further antifungal assays showed that the main compounds exhibit various degrees of inhibition against all the fungi tested. In addition, synergistic effects between A. annua EO and chemical fungicides were examined. Finally, in vivo experiments were conducted and disclosed that P. notoginseng root rot could be largely inhibited by the petroleum ether extract from A. annua, indicating that A. annua could be a good source for controlling P. notoginseng root-rot.",Genetic Dissection of Grain Nutritional Traits and Leaf Blight Resistance in Rice.,https://www.ncbi.nlm.nih.gov/pubmed/30626141,Genes,2019 02 05,"Colored rice is rich in nutrition and also a good source of valuable genes/quantitative trait loci (QTL) for nutrition, grain quality, and pest and disease resistance traits for use in rice breeding. Genome-wide association analysis using high-density single nucleotide polymorphism (SNP) is useful in precisely detecting QTLs and genes. We carried out genome-wide association analysis in 152 colored rice accessions, using 22,112 SNPs to map QTLs for nutritional, agronomic, and bacterial leaf blight (BLB) resistance traits. Wide variations and normal frequency distributions were observed for most of the traits except anthocyanin content and BLB resistance. The structural and principal component analysis revealed two subgroups. The linkage disequilibrium (LD) analysis showed 74.3% of the marker pairs in complete LD, with an average LD distance of 1000 kb and, interestingly, 36% of the LD pairs were less than 5 Kb, indicating high recombination in the panel. In total, 57 QTLs were identified for ten traits at p < 0.0001, and the phenotypic variance explained (PVE) by these QTLs varied from 9% to 18%. Interestingly, 30 (53%) QTLs were co-located with known or functionally-related genes. Some of the important candidate genes for grain Zinc (Zn) and BLB resistance were OsHMA9, OsMAPK6, OsNRAMP7, OsMADS13, and OsZFP252, and Xa1, Xa3, xa5, xa13 and xa26, respectively. Red rice genotype, Sayllebon, which is high in both Zn and anthocyanin content, could be a valuable material for a breeding program for nutritious rice. Overall, the QTLs identified in our study can be used for QTL pyramiding as well as genomic selection. Some of the novel QTLs can be further validated by fine mapping and functional characterization. The results show that pigmented rice is a valuable resource for mineral elements and antioxidant compounds; it can also provide novel alleles for disease resistance as well as for yield component traits. Therefore, large opportunities exist to further explore and exploit more colored rice accessions for use in breeding.",Synthesis of Cu₂O/CuO Nanocrystals and Their Application to H₂S Sensing.,https://www.ncbi.nlm.nih.gov/pubmed/30626139,"Sensors (Basel, Switzerland)",2019 01 24,"Semiconducting metal oxide nanocrystals are an important class of materials that have versatile applications because of their useful properties and high stability. Here, we developed a simple route to synthesize nanocrystals (NCs) of copper oxides such as Cu₂O and CuO using a hot-soap method, and applied them to H₂S sensing. Cu₂O NCs were synthesized by simply heating a copper precursor in oleylamine in the presence of diol at 160 °C under an Ar flow. X-ray diffractometry (XRD), dynamic light scattering (DLS), and transmission electron microscopy (TEM) results indicated the formation of monodispersed Cu₂O NCs having approximately 5 nm in crystallite size and 12 nm in colloidal size. The conversion of the Cu₂O NCs to CuO NCs was undertaken by straightforward air oxidation at room temperature, as confirmed by XRD and UV-vis analyses. A thin film Cu₂O NC sensor fabricated by spin coating showed responses to H₂S in dilute concentrations (1⁻8 ppm) at 50⁻150 °C, but the stability was poor because of the formation of metallic Cu₂S in a H₂S atmosphere. We found that Pd loading improved the stability of the sensor response. The Pd-loaded Cu₂O NC sensor exhibited reproducible responses to H₂S at 200 °C. Based on the gas sensing mechanism, it is suggested that Pd loading facilitates the reaction of adsorbed oxygen with H₂S and suppresses the irreversible formation of Cu₂S.",Metabolic Syndrome Knowledge among Adults with Cardiometabolic Risk Factors: A Cross-Sectional Study.,https://www.ncbi.nlm.nih.gov/pubmed/30626137,International journal of environmental research and public health,2019 05 22,"Metabolic syndrome (MetS) is a cluster of cardiometabolic risk factors. Many people may be unaware of their risk for MetS. A cross-sectional, descriptive study was conducted among hospitalized patients with at least one cardiometabolic risk factor in Mainland China. This study assessed the MetS knowledgelevel(through MetS Knowledge Scale, MSKS) and examined the potential predictors by regression analysis. A total of 204 patients aged 58.5 ± 10.1 years (55% males) participated in this study. The majority of participants had no history of hypertension (54%), dyslipidemia (79%), or diabetes (85%). However, 56% of these participants had at least three cardiometabolic risk factors, indicating the presence of MetS. The average MSKS was very low (mean = 36.7±18.8, possible range = 0⁻100), indicating the urgent needs of MetS education in current practice. Predictors of better MetS knowledge included higher educational level, history of dyslipidemia, and normal high-density lipoprotein cholesterol (F (8, 195) = 9.39, adjusted R² = 0.192, p< 0.001). In conclusion, adults with cardiometabolic risk factors are at risk of developing MetS, but with a low level of knowledge. Specific health education on MetS should be provided, particularly for those with limited formal education or inadequate lipid management.","Morniga-G, a T/Tn-Specific Lectin, Induces Leukemic Cell Death via Caspase and DR5 Receptor-Dependent Pathways.",https://www.ncbi.nlm.nih.gov/pubmed/30626136,International journal of molecular sciences,2019 04 26,"Morniga-G, the Gal-specific black mulberry (Morus nigra) lectin, displays high affinity for T (CD176) and Tn (CD175) antigens, frequently expressed at the cancer cell surface. The effects of Morniga-G were investigated on a Tn-positive leukemic Jurkat cell line. The lectin, used in a concentration range between 5⁻20 μg/mL, induced cell death in leukemic Jurkat cells. Microscopic and cytofluorometric analyses indicated that Jurkat cell death was essentially apoptotic, associated with an increase in the ceramide content and a depolarization of the mitochondrial transmembrane potential. This lectin-mediated cell death was inhibited by the pan caspase-inhibitor zVAD. In addition, cleavage of caspases 8, 9, and 3 was observed in Morniga-G-treated Jurkat cells whereas Jurkat cell lines that are deficient in caspase 8⁻10, caspase 9, or FADD, survived to the lectin-mediated toxicity. Furthermore, in the presence of TRAIL- or DR5-blocking mononoclonal antibodies, Jurkat cells became resistant to Morniga-G, suggesting that the lectin triggers cell death via the TRAIL/DR5 pathway. In silico computer simulations suggest that Morniga-G might facilitate both the DR5 dimerization and the building of TRAIL/DR5 complexes. Finally, upon treatment of Jurkat cells with benzyl-GalNAc, an O-glycosylation inhibitor, a decrease in Tn antigen expression associating with a reduced Morniga-G toxicity, was observed. Taken together, these results suggest that Morniga-G induces the cell death of Tn-positive leukemic cells via concomitant O-glycosylation-, caspase-, and TRAIL/DR5-dependent pathways."

Aggressive dosing of these therapies is significantly hampered by side effects due to normal tissue toxicity. Selenium represents an adjuvant that selectively sensitizes cancer cells to these treatments modalities, potentially by inducing lipid peroxidation (LPO). This study investigated whether one such selenium compound, methylseleninic acid (MSA), induces LPO and radiation sensitivity in HNSCC cells. Results from 4,4-difluoro-4-bora-3a,4a-diaza-S-indacene (BODIPY) C11 oxidation and ferric thiocyanate assays revealed that MSA induced LPO in cells rapidly and persistently. Propidium iodide (PI) exclusion assay found that MSA was more toxic to cancer cells than other related selenium compounds; this toxicity was abrogated by treatment with α-tocopherol, an LPO inhibitor. MSA exhibited no toxicity to normal fibroblasts at similar doses. MSA also sensitized HNSCC cells to radiation as determined by clonogenic assay. Intracellular glutathione in cancer cells was depleted following MSA treatment, and supplementation of the intracellular glutathione pool with N-acetylcysteine sensitized cells to MSA. The addition of MSA to a cell-free solution of glutathione resulted in an increase in oxygen consumption, which was abrogated by catalase, suggesting the formation of H₂O₂. Results from this study identify MSA as an inducer of LPO, and reveal its capability to sensitize HNSCC to radiation. MSA may represent a potent adjuvant to radiation therapy in HNSCC.",A GIS-Based Artificial Neural Network Model for Spatial Distribution of Tuberculosis across the Continental United States.,https://www.ncbi.nlm.nih.gov/pubmed/30626123,International journal of environmental research and public health,2019 05 22,"Despite the usefulness of artificial neural networks (ANNs) in the study of various complex problems, ANNs have not been applied for modeling the geographic distribution of tuberculosis (TB) in the US. Likewise, ecological level researches on TB incidence rate at the national level are inadequate for epidemiologic inferences. We collected 278 exploratory variables including environmental and a broad range of socio-economic features for modeling the disease across the continental US. The spatial pattern of the disease distribution was statistically evaluated using the global Moran's I, Getis⁻Ord General G, and local Gi* statistics. Next, we investigated the applicability of multilayer perceptron (MLP) ANN for predicting the disease incidence. To avoid overfitting, L1 regularization was used before developing the models. Predictive performance of the MLP was compared with linear regression for test dataset using root mean square error, mean absolute error, and correlations between model output and ground truth. Results of clustering analysis showed that there is a significant spatial clustering of smoothed TB incidence rate (p < 0.05) and the hotspots were mainly located in the southern and southeastern parts of the country. Among the developed models, single hidden layer MLP had the best test accuracy. Sensitivity analysis of the MLP model showed that immigrant population (proportion), underserved segments of the population, and minimum temperature were among the factors with the strongest contributions. The findings of this study can provide useful insight to health authorities on prioritizing resource allocation to risk-prone areas.",Unique Biological Activity and Potential Role of Monomeric Laminin-γ2 as a Novel Biomarker for Hepatocellular Carcinoma: A Review.,https://www.ncbi.nlm.nih.gov/pubmed/30626121,International journal of molecular sciences,2019 04 26,"Laminin (Ln)-332 consists of α3, β3, and γ2 chains, which mediate epithelial cell adhesion to the basement membrane. Ln-γ2, a component of Ln-332, is frequently expressed as a monomer in the invasion front of several types of malignant tissues without simultaneous expression of Ln-α3 and/or Ln-β3 chains. Moreover, monomeric Ln-γ2 induces tumor cell proliferation and migration in vitro. These unique biological activities indicate that monomeric Ln-γ2 could be a candidate biomarker for early cancer surveillance. However, the present immune method for monomeric Ln-γ2 detection can only predict its expression, since no antibody that specifically reacts with monomeric γ2, but not with heterotrimeric γ2 chain, is commercially available. We have, therefore, developed monoclonal antibodies to specifically detect monomeric Ln-γ2, and devised a highly sensitive method to measure serum monomeric Ln-γ2 levels using a fully automated chemiluminescent immunoassay (CLIA). We evaluated its diagnostic value in sera from patients with several digestive cancers, including hepatocellular carcinoma (HCC), and found serum monomeric Ln-γ2 to be a clinically available biomarker for HCC surveillance. The combination of monomeric Ln-γ2 and prothrombin induced by Vitamin K Absence II (PIVKA-II) may be more sensitive for clinical diagnosis of HCC than any currently used combination.",The Role of Routine Culture in the Treatment of Chronic Suppurative Otitis Media: Implications for the Standard of Care in Rural Areas of South Africa.,https://www.ncbi.nlm.nih.gov/pubmed/30626120,Tropical medicine and infectious disease,2019 04 30,"Chronic Suppurative Otitis Media (CSOM) is a widely prevalent disease, which is a leading cause of acquired deafness worldwide, and is associated with complications with significant mortality and morbidity. It often responds poorly to standard of care therapy and places a disproportionate burden on at-risk populations. The microbiology and antibiotic resistance of CSOM varies based on local factors, including health care access, comorbidities, and antibiotic prescribing practices. We evaluated the role and feasibility of using routine culture for the treatment of CSOM in rural areas as a means of improving treatment of CSOM. More than 400 patients were screened in a rural clinic in South Africa over six weeks, and 14 met study criteria and consented for participation. Gram-negative organisms predominated overall, although Staphylococcus aureus was the most commonly isolated single species. A majority of the pathogens were relatively sensitive to commonly prescribed antibiotics, but two cases of methicillin resistant Staphylococcus aureus were cultured, and one patient grew a Scedosporium species. Treatment on follow-up was able to be directed by culture results, suggesting routine culture at the initial point of contact with the health care system may play a pivotal role in addressing this widely prevalent and devastating disease.",Molecular Dynamics Simulations of Wild Type and Mutants of SAPAP in Complexed with Shank3.,https://www.ncbi.nlm.nih.gov/pubmed/30626119,International journal of molecular sciences,2019 04 26,"Specific interactions between scaffold protein SH3 and multiple ankyrin repeat domains protein 3 (Shank3) and synapse-associated protein 90/postsynaptic density-95⁻associated protein (SAPAP) are essential for excitatory synapse development and plasticity. In a bunch of human neurological diseases, mutations on Shank3 or SAPAP are detected. To investigate the dynamical and thermodynamic properties of the specific binding between the N-terminal extended PDZ (Post-synaptic density-95/Discs large/Zonaoccludens-1) domain (N-PDZ) of Shank3 and the extended PDZ binding motif (E-PBM) of SAPAP, molecular dynamics simulation approaches were used to study the complex of N-PDZ with wild type and mutated E-PBM peptides. To compare with the experimental data, 974QTRL977 and 966IEIYI970 of E-PBM peptide were mutated to prolines to obtain the M4P and M5P system, respectively. Conformational analysis shows that the canonical PDZ domain is stable while the βN extension presents high flexibility in all systems, especially for M5P. The high flexibility of βN extension seems to set up a barrier for the non-specific binding in this area and provide the basis for specific molecular recognition between Shank3 and SAPAP. The wild type E-PBM tightly binds to N-PDZ during the simulation while loss of binding is observed in different segments of the mutated E-PBM peptides. Energy decomposition and hydrogen bonds analysis show that M4P mutations only disrupt the interactions with canonical PDZ domain, but the interactions with βN1' remain. In M5P system, although the interactions with βN1' are abolished, the binding between peptide and the canonical PDZ domain is not affected. The results indicate that the interactions in the two-binding site, the canonical PDZ domain and the βN1' extension, contribute to the binding between E-PBM and N-PDZ independently. The binding free energies calculated by MM/GBSA (Molecular Mechanics/Generalized Born Surface Area) are in agreement with the experimental binding affinities. Most of the residues on E-PBM contribute considerably favorable energies to the binding except A963 and D964 in the N-terminal. The study provides information to understand the molecular basis of specific binding between Shank3 and SAPAP, as well as clues for design of peptide inhibitors.",Characteristics of the Water- and Alkali-Soluble Hemicelluloses Fractionated by Sequential Acidification and Graded-Ethanol from Sweet Maize Stems.,https://www.ncbi.nlm.nih.gov/pubmed/30626118,"Molecules (Basel, Switzerland)",2019 03 21,"Sweet maize stems were treated with hot water and potassium hydroxide to fractionate hemicellulosic polymers. The results showed that the water-soluble hemicelluloses were mainly composed of glucose (27.83%), xylose (27.32%), and galactose (16.81%). In comparison, alkali-soluble hemicelluloses fractionated by acidification and a graded ethanol solution (10%, 20%, 35%, 50%, 65%, and 80%) were mainly composed of xylose (69.73 to 88.62%) and arabinose (5.41 to 16.20%). More highly branched hemicelluloses tended to be precipitated in a higher concentration of ethanol solution, as revealed by the decreasing xylose to arabinose ratio from 16.43 to 4.21. Structural characterizations indicated that alkali-soluble hemicelluloses fractionated from sweet maize stems were mainly arabinoxylans. The results provided fundamental information on hemicelluloses composition and structure and their potential utilization in the fields of biofuels, biochemicals, and biomaterials.",Role of Dietary Lipids in Modulating Inflammation through the Gut Microbiota.,https://www.ncbi.nlm.nih.gov/pubmed/30626117,Nutrients,2019 03 20,"Inflammation and its resolution is a tenuous balance that is under constant contest. Though several regulatory mechanisms are employed to maintain homeostasis, disruptions in the regulation of inflammation can lead to detrimental effects for the host. Of note, the gut and microbial dysbiosis are implicated in the pathology of systemic chronic low-grade inflammation which has been linked to several metabolic diseases. What remains to be described is the extent to which dietary fat and concomitant changes in the gut microbiota contribute to, or arise from, the onset of metabolic disorders. The present review will highlight the role of microorganisms in host energy regulation and several mechanisms that contribute to inflammatory pathways. This review will also discuss the immunomodulatory effects of the endocannabinoid system and its link with the gut microbiota. Finally, a brief discussion arguing for improved taxonomic resolution (at the species and strain level) is needed to deepen our current knowledge of the microbiota and host inflammatory state.",Molecular Evidence for Precursors of Sjögren's Foci in Histologically Normal Lacrimal Glands.,https://www.ncbi.nlm.nih.gov/pubmed/30626116,International journal of molecular sciences,2019 04 26,"Understanding the formation of Sjogren's lymphocytic infiltrates could permit earlier diagnosis and better outcomes. We submitted gene transcript abundances in histologically normal rabbit lacrimal glands to principal component analysis. The analysis identified a cluster of transcripts associated with Sjögren's foci, including messenger RNAs (mRNAs) for C⁻X⁻C motif chemokine ligand 13 (CXCL13) and B-cell activating factor (BAFF), which dominated the major principal component. We interpreted the transcript cluster as the signature of a cluster of integrally functioning cells. Pregnancy and dryness increased the likelihood that the cluster would develop to high levels, but responses were subject to high levels of stochasticity. Analyzing microdissected samples from high- and low-cluster-level glands, we found that certain transcripts, including mRNAs for C⁻C motif chemokine ligand 21 (CCL21), CXCL13, cluster of differentiation 4 (CD4), CD28, CD25, BAFF, and interleukin 18 (IL-18) were significantly more abundant in immune cell clusters (ICs) from the high-cluster-level gland; mRNAs for CCL2, CD25, and IL-1RA were significantly more abundant in acinus-duct axis samples; mRNAs for CCL4, BAFF, IL-6, and IL-10 were more abundant in some acinus-duct samples; cells with high prolactin immunoreactivity were more frequent in interacinar spaces. In conclusion, integrated functional networks comprising Sjögren's infiltrates, such as ICs, acinar cells, ductal cells, and interacinar cells, can form in histologically normal glands, and it is feasible to detect their molecular signatures.",Relative Dose Intensity of Induction-Phase Pazopanib Treatment of Soft Tissue Sarcoma: Its Relationship with Prognoses of Pazopanib Responders.,https://www.ncbi.nlm.nih.gov/pubmed/30626115,Journal of clinical medicine,2019 02 03,"The approved standard dose of pazopanib is 800 mg per day, but the appropriate dose of pazopanib to treat soft tissue sarcoma (STS) patients in real-world practice is controversial. Of 124 STS patients treated with pazopanib, we retrospectively analyzed the cases of STS patients who achieved progression-free survival at 12 weeks by pazopanib treatment as pazopanib responders, and we evaluated their relative dose intensity (RDI) in the initial 12 weeks (12W-RDI). We enrolled 78 STS patients in the analyses as pazopanib responders, and 54 patients of the 78 pazopanib responders (69%) were able to maintain 12W-RDI ≥80%. In landmark analyses, patients with 12W-RDI of 80% ≥80% had significantly longer progression-free survival compared to those with 12W-RDI <80% (30.7 weeks vs. 22.0 weeks, hazard ratio [HR]: 0.56 [95%CI: 0.33⁻0.94], p = 0.026). The most frequently observed reasons of treatment interruption and/or dose reduction of pazopanib during the initial 12 weeks were anorexia and liver function disorders. Liver toxicity was the adverse event most frequently observed in the 12W-RDI <80% patients throughout the treatment periods. Based on our results, it appears that maintaining as high a dose intensity as possible that is tolerable-at least during the initial 12 weeks-is likely to be the better option in pazopanib treatment for STS patients.",Reduced Efficiency Roll-Off in White Phosphorescent Organic Light-Emitting Diodes Based on Double Emission Layers.,https://www.ncbi.nlm.nih.gov/pubmed/30626114,"Molecules (Basel, Switzerland)",2019 03 21,"We demonstrate high-efficiency white phosphorescent organic light-emitting diodes with low efficiency roll-off.

The resulting white device with the optimized doping concentration shows a maximum efficiency of 31.0 cd/A with extremely low efficiency roll-off of 30.7 cd/A at 1000 cd/m², 27.2 cd/A at 5000 cd/m², and 25.5 cd/A at 10,000 cd/m², respectively, without any outcoupling structures. This is enabled by the balanced charge carrier transport in EMLs, leading to broader exciton recombination zone."

Neuroimaging represents a gold standard and clinically translatable technique to identify neuropathological changes in epileptogenesis and longitudinally monitor its progression after a precipitating injury. Neuroimaging studies, along with molecular studies from animal models, have greatly improved our understanding of the neuropathology of epilepsy, such as the hallmark hippocampus sclerosis. Animal models are effective for differentiating the different stages of epileptogenesis. Neuroimaging in experimental epilepsy provides unique information about anatomic, functional, and metabolic alterations linked to epileptogenesis. Recently, several in vivo biomarkers for epileptogenesis have been investigated for characterizing neuronal loss, inflammation, blood-brain barrier alterations, changes in neurotransmitter density, neurovascular coupling, cerebral blood flow and volume, network connectivity, and metabolic activity in the brain. Magnetic resonance imaging (MRI) is a sensitive method for detecting structural and functional changes in the brain, especially to identify region-specific neuronal damage patterns in epilepsy. Positron emission tomography (PET) and single-photon emission computerized tomography are helpful to elucidate key functional alterations, especially in areas of brain metabolism and molecular patterns, and can help monitor pathology of epileptic disorders. Multimodal procedures such as PET-MRI integrated systems are desired for refractory epilepsy. Validated biomarkers are warranted for early identification of people at risk for epilepsy and monitoring of the progression of medical interventions.",A Multiscale Denoising Framework Using Detection Theory with Application to Images from CMOS/CCD Sensors.,https://www.ncbi.nlm.nih.gov/pubmed/30626102,"Sensors (Basel, Switzerland)",2019 01 24,"Output from imaging sensors based on CMOS and CCD devices is prone to noise due to inherent electronic fluctuations and low photon count. The resulting noise in the acquired image could be effectively modelled as signal-dependent Poisson noise or as a mixture of Poisson and Gaussian noise. To that end, we propose a generalized framework based on detection theory and hypothesis testing coupled with the variance stability transformation (VST) for Poisson or Poisson⁻Gaussian denoising. VST transforms signal-dependent Poisson noise to a signal independent Gaussian noise with stable variance. Subsequently, multiscale transforms are employed on the noisy image to segregate signal and noise into separate coefficients. That facilitates the application of local binary hypothesis testing on multiple scales using empirical distribution function (EDF) for the purpose of detection and removal of noise. We demonstrate the effectiveness of the proposed framework with different multiscale transforms and on a wide variety of input datasets.",Salinity and Temperature Influence Growth and Pigment Production in the Marine-Derived Fungal Strain Talaromyces albobiverticillius 30548.,https://www.ncbi.nlm.nih.gov/pubmed/30626101,Microorganisms,2019 02 03,"Marine-derived fungi that inhabit severe changing environments have gained increasing interest for their ability to produce structurally unique natural products. Fungi belonging to the Talaromyces and the close Penicillium genera are among the most promising microbes for bioactive compound production, including colored metabolites. Coupling pigment producing capability with bioactive effectiveness would be a valuable challenge in some specific fields such as dyeing, cosmeceutical, or food industries. In this sense, Talaromyces albobiverticillius 30548, a red pigment producing strain, has been isolated from the marine environment of Reunion Island, Indian Ocean. In this research, we analyzed the effect of temperatures (21⁻27 °C) and salinity levels (0⁻9%) on fungal growth and pigment production. Maximum pigment yield was obtained in non-salted media, when cultured at 27 °C after 10 days of submerged fermentation in PDB. However, maximum dry biomass production was achieved at stressed condition with 9% sea salts concentrated media at the same temperature. The results indicate that salinity of the culture media positively influences the growth of the biomass. Inversely, pigment production decreases with increase in salinity over 6%. Color coordinates of secreted pigments were expressed in CIELAB color system. The hue angles (h°) ranged from red to yellow colors. This indicated that the color distribution of fungal pigments depends on the salinity in the culture media. This study emphasizes the impact of abiotic stress (salt and temperature) on the growth and metabolome of marine-derived fungal strains.",m6A-Dependent RNA Dynamics in T Cell Differentiation.,https://www.ncbi.nlm.nih.gov/pubmed/30626100,Genes,2019 02 05,"N6-methyladenosine (m6A) is the most abundant RNA modification. It has been involved in the regulation of RNA metabolism, including degradation and translation, in both physiological and disease conditions. A recent study showed that m6A-mediated degradation of key transcripts also plays a role in the control of T cells homeostasis and IL-7 induced differentiation. We re-analyzed the omics data from that study and, through the integrative analysis of total and nascent RNA-seq data, we were able to comprehensively quantify T cells RNA dynamics and how these are affected by m6A depletion. In addition to the expected impact on RNA degradation, we revealed a broader effect of m6A on RNA dynamics, which included the alteration of RNA synthesis and processing. Altogether, the combined action of m6A on all major steps of the RNA life-cycle closely re-capitulated the observed changes in the abundance of premature and mature RNA species. Ultimately, our re-analysis extended the findings of the initial study, focused on RNA stability, and proposed a yet unappreciated role for m6A in RNA synthesis and processing dynamics.",Utility of the Neonatal Calf Model for Testing Vaccines and Intervention Strategies for Use against Human RSV Infection.,https://www.ncbi.nlm.nih.gov/pubmed/30626099,Vaccines,2019 04 19,"Respiratory syncytial virus (RSV) is a significant cause of pediatric respiratory tract infections. It is estimated that two-thirds of infants are infected with RSV during the first year of life and it is one of the leading causes of death in this age group worldwide. Similarly, bovine RSV is a primary viral pathogen in cases of pneumonia in young calves and plays a significant role in bovine respiratory disease complex. Importantly, naturally occurring infection of calves with bovine RSV shares many features in common with human RSV infection. Herein, we update our current understanding of RSV infection in cattle, with particular focus on similarities between the calf and human infection, and the recent reports in which the neonatal calf has been employed for the development and testing of vaccines and therapeutics which may be applied to hRSV infection in humans.","Acute Myeloid Leukemia Affects Mouse Sperm Parameters, Spontaneous Acrosome Reaction, and Fertility Capacity.",https://www.ncbi.nlm.nih.gov/pubmed/30626098,International journal of molecular sciences,2019 04 26,"Leukemia is one of the most common cancers in patients of reproductive age. It is well known that chemotherapy, used as anti-cancer therapy, adversely affects male fertility. Moreover, the negative effect of leukemia on sperm quality, even before chemotherapy treatment, has been reported. However, the mechanisms behind this disease's effect on sperm quality remains unknown. In this study, we examine the direct effect of leukemia and chemotherapy alone and in combination on sperm parameters and male fertility. For this, we developed an acute myeloid leukemia (AML) mouse model (mice were treated with AML cells C1498 and developed leukemia); these mice then received cytarabine chemotherapy. Our findings reveal a significant reduction in sperm concentration and motility and a significant increase in abnormal morphology and spontaneous acrosome reaction of the sperm following AML and chemotherapy treatment, alone and in combination. We also found a reduction in male fertility and the number of delivered offspring. Our results support previous findings that AML impairs sperm parameters and show for the first time that AML increases spontaneous acrosome reaction and decreases male fertility capacity and number of offspring.",Bring It to an End: Does Telomeres Size Matter?,https://www.ncbi.nlm.nih.gov/pubmed/30626097,Cells,2019 02 07,"Telomeres are unique nucleoprotein structures. Found at the edge of each chromosome, their main purpose is to mask DNA ends from the DNA-repair machinery by formation of protective loops. Through life and cell divisions, telomeres shorten and bring cells closer to either cell proliferation crisis or senescence. Beyond this mitotic clock role attributed to the need for telomere to be maintained over a critical length, the very tip of our DNA has been shown to impact transcription by position effect. TPE and a long-reach counterpart, TPE-OLD, are mechanisms recently described in human biology. Still in infancy, the mechanism of action of these processes and their respective genome wide impact remain to be resolved. In this review, we will discuss recent findings on telomere dynamics, TPE, TPE-OLD, and lessons learnt from model organisms.",18F-FDOPA PET/CT Combined with MRI for Gross Tumor Volume Delineation in Patients with Skull Base Paraganglioma.,https://www.ncbi.nlm.nih.gov/pubmed/30626096,Cancers,2019 02 06,"In this simulation study, we assessed differences in gross tumor volume (GTV) in a series of skull base paragangliomas (SBPGLs) using magnetic resonance imaging (MRI), 18F-dihydroxyphenylalanine (18F-FDOPA) combined positron emission tomography/computed tomography (PET/CT), and 18F-FDOPA PET/MRI images obtained by rigid alignment of PET and MRI. GTV was delineated in 16 patients with SBPGLs on MRI (GTVMRI), 18F-FDOPA PET/CT (GTVPET), and combined PET/MRI (GTVPET/MRI). GTVPET/MRI was the union of GTVMRI and GTVPET after visual adjustment. Three observers delineated GTVMRI and GTVPET/MRI independently. Excellent interobserver reproducibility was found for both GTVMRI and GTVPET/MRI. GTVPET and GTVMRI were not significantly different. However, there was some spatial difference between the locations of GTVMRI, GTVPET, and GTVPET/MRI. The Dice similarity coefficient median value was 0.4 between PET/CT and MRI, and 0.8 between MRI and PET/MRI. The combined use of PET/MRI produced a larger GTV than MRI alone. Nevertheless, both the target-delivered dose and organs-at-risk conservancy were respected when treatment was planned on the PET/MRI-matched data set. Future integration of 18F-FDOPA PET/CT into clinical practice will be necessary to evaluate the influence of this diagnostic modality on SBPGL therapeutic management. If the clinical utility of 18F-FDOPA PET/CT and/or PET/MRI is confirmed, GTVPET/MRI should be considered for tailored radiotherapy planning in patients with SBPGL.",Whole Body Protein Oxidation Unaffected after a Protein Restricted Diet in Healthy Young Males.,https://www.ncbi.nlm.nih.gov/pubmed/30626095,Nutrients,2019 03 20,"Protein oxidation may play a role in the balance between anabolism and catabolism. We assessed the effect of a protein restricted diet on protein oxidation as a possible reflection of whole body protein metabolism. Sixteen healthy males (23 ± 3 years) were instructed to use a 4-day isocaloric protein restricted diet (0.25 g protein/kg body weight/day). Their habitual dietary intake was assessed by a 4-day food diary. After an overnight fast, a 30 g 13C-milk protein test drink was administered, followed by 330 min breath sample collection. Protein oxidation was measured by Isotope Ratio Mass Spectrometry. To assess actual change in protein intake from 24-h urea excretion, 24-h urine was collected. During the 4-day protein restricted diet, the urinary urea:creatinine ratio decreased by 56 ± 9%, which is comparable to a protein intake of ~0.65 g protein/kg body weight/day. After the protein restricted diet, 30.5 ± 7.3% of the 30 g 13C-milk protein was oxidized over 330 min, compared to 31.5 ± 6.4% (NS) after the subject's habitual diet (1.3 ± 0.3 g protein/kg body weight/day). A large range in the effect of the diet on protein oxidation (-43.2% vs. +44.0%) was observed. The residual standard deviation of the measurements was very small (0.601 ± 0.167). This suggests that in healthy males, protein oxidation is unaffected after a protein restricted diet. It is uncertain how important the role of fluctuations in short-term protein oxidation is within whole body protein metabolism.",Biocompatible Polymer Nanoparticles for Drug Delivery Applications in Cancer and Neurodegenerative Disorder Therapies.,https://www.ncbi.nlm.nih.gov/pubmed/30626094,Journal of functional biomaterials,2019 04 19,"Polymer nanoparticles (NPs) represent one of the most innovative non-invasive approaches for drug delivery applications.

Many polymers are used for the synthesis of NPs and among the currently most employed materials several biocompatible synthetic polymers, namely polylactic acid (PLA), poly lactic-co-glycolic acid (PLGA), and polyethylene glycol (PEG), can be cited. These molecules are made of simple monomers which are naturally present in the body and therefore easily excreted without being toxic. The present review addresses the different approaches that are most commonly adopted to synthetize biocompatible NPs to date, as well as the experimental strategies designed to load them with therapeutic agents. In fact, drugs may be internalized in the NPs or physically dispersed therein. In this paper the various types of biodegradable polymer NPs will be discussed with emphasis on their applications in drug delivery. Close attention will be devoted to the treatment of cancer, where both active and passive targeting is used to enhance efficacy and reduce systemic toxicity, and to diseases affecting the central nervous system, inasmuch as NPs can be modified to target specific cells or cross membrane barriers."

However, its pathogenic mechanism remains unclear. The cathepsin L-like cysteine proteinase (CPL) genes are multifunctional genes related to the parasitic abilities of plant-parasitic nematodes, but their functions in PWN remain unclear. We cloned three cpl genes of PWN (Bx-cpls) by rapid amplification of cDNA ends (RACE) and analyzed their characteristics using bioinformatic methods. The tissue specificity of cpl gene of PWN (Bx-cpl) was studied using in situ mRNA hybridization (ISH). The functions of Bx-cpls in development and pathogenicity were investigated using real-time quantitative PCR (qPCR) and RNA interference (RNAi). The results showed that the full-length cDNAs of Bx-cpl-1, Bx-cpl-2, and Bx-cpl-3 were 1163 bp, 1305 bp, and 1302 bp, respectively. Bx-cpls could accumulate specifically in the egg, intestine, and genital system of PWN. During different developmental stages of PWN, the expression of Bx-cpls in the egg stage was highest. After infection, the expression levels of Bx-cpls increased and reached their highest at the initial stage of PWD, then declined gradually. The silencing of Bx-cpl could reduce the feeding, reproduction, and pathogenicity of PWN. These results revealed that Bx-cpls play multiple roles in the development and pathogenic processes of PWN.",Energy Transfer between Tm-Doped Upconverting Nanoparticles and a Small Organic Dye with Large Stokes Shift.,https://www.ncbi.nlm.nih.gov/pubmed/30626081,Biosensors,2019 04 29,"Lanthanide-doped upconverting nanoparticles (UCNP) are being extensively studied for bioapplications due to their unique photoluminescence properties and low toxicity. Interest in RET applications involving UCNP is also increasing, but due to factors such as large sizes, ion emission distributions within the particles, and complicated energy transfer processes within the UCNP, there are still many questions to be answered. In this study, four types of core and core-shell NaYF₄-based UCNP co-doped with Yb3+ and Tm3+ as sensitizer and activator, respectively, were investigated as donors for the Methyl 5-(8-decanoylbenzo[1,2-d:4,5-d']bis([1,3]dioxole)-4-yl)-5-oxopentanoate (DBD-6) dye. The possibility of resonance energy transfer (RET) between UCNP and the DBD-6 attached to their surface was demonstrated based on the comparison of luminescence intensities, band ratios, and decay kinetics. The architecture of UCNP influenced both the luminescence properties and the energy transfer to the dye: UCNP with an inert shell were the brightest, but their RET efficiency was the lowest (17%). Nanoparticles with Tm3+ only in the shell have revealed the highest RET efficiencies (up to 51%) despite the compromised luminescence due to surface quenching.",Three-Dimensional Stable Alginate-Nanocellulose Gels for Biomedical Applications: Towards Tunable Mechanical Properties and Cell Growing.,https://www.ncbi.nlm.nih.gov/pubmed/30626080,"Nanomaterials (Basel, Switzerland)",2019 02 07,"Hydrogels have been studied as promising materials in different biomedical applications such as cell culture in tissue engineering or in wound healing.

The nanocelluloses and the gels were characterized by different techniques such as Fourier-transform infrared spectroscopy (FTIR), scanning electron microscopy (SEM), transmission electron microscopy (TEM), thermogravimetric analysis (TGA), and dynamic mechanical thermal analysis (DMTA), while the biological features were characterized by cytotoxicity and cell growth assays. The addition of CNCTs or CNFTs in alginate gels contributed to the formation of porous structure (diameter of pores in the range between 40 and 150 μm). TEMPO-oxidized cellulose nanofibers have proven to play a crucial role in improving the dimensional stability of the samples when compared to the pure alginate gels, mainly after a thermal post-treatment of these gels containing 50 wt % of CNFT, which significantly increased the Ca2+ crosslinking density in the gel structure. The morphological characteristics, the mechanical properties, and the non-cytotoxic behavior of the CNFT-alginate gels improved bioadhesion, growth, and proliferation of the cells onto the gels. Thus, the alginate-nanocellulose gels might find applications in tissue engineering field, as for instance, in tissue repair or wound healing applications.",Recipient ADAMTS13 Single-Nucleotide Polymorphism Predicts Relapse after Unrelated Bone Marrow Transplantation for Hematologic Malignancy.,https://www.ncbi.nlm.nih.gov/pubmed/30626079,International journal of molecular sciences,2019 04 26,"Relapse remains a major obstacle to the survival of patients with hematologic malignancies after allogeneic hematopoietic stem cell transplantation. A disintegrin-like and metalloprotease with a thrombospondin type 1 motif (ADMATS13), which cleaves von Willebrand factor multimers into less active fragments, is encoded by the ADAMTS13 gene and has a functional single-nucleotide polymorphism (SNP) rs2285489 (C > T). We retrospectively examined whether ADAMTS13 rs2285489 affected the transplant outcomes in a cohort of 281 patients who underwent unrelated human leukocyte antigen (HLA)-matched bone marrow transplantation for hematologic malignancies. The recipient ADAMTS13 C/C genotype, which putatively has low inducibility, was associated with an increased relapse rate (hazard ratio [HR], 3.12; 95% confidence interval [CI], 1.25⁻7.77; P = 0.015), resulting in a lower disease-free survival rate in the patients with a recipient C/C genotype (HR, 1.64; 95% CI, 1.01⁻2.67; P = 0.045). Therefore, ADAMTS13 rs2285489 genotyping in transplant recipients may be a useful tool for evaluating pretransplantation risks.",Coach Competences to Induce Positive Affective Reactions in Sport and Exercise-A Qualitative Study.,https://www.ncbi.nlm.nih.gov/pubmed/30626078,"Sports (Basel, Switzerland)",2019 02 12,"Positive affective reactions are a crucial aspect in physical activity maintenance. Affective reactions to sport and exercise were found to be important factors of physical activity. Coaches could be an important medium to induce positive affective reactions of participants in sport and exercise. Understanding how coaches trigger positive affective reactions (AR) during physical activity is a crucial aspect for increasing maintenance in sport and exercise. The aim of this study is to identify the competences of the coaches which are associated with perceived positive AR of participants during sport and exercise. To identify these factors, semistructured in-depth interviews were conducted with 18 participants, who take part in sport and exercise (nine female and nine male) of heterogeneous age (mean age 42.6; SD = 19.25; under 30 years, 30 to 60 years, 60 years and above) and who have different athletic backgrounds (individual sports, team sports, and gym classes). Four key coach competence factors were identified and used to design an integrated model. Three general competences: context sensitivity, social⁻emotional competences, professional competences, and the specific competences in the behaviour-related competences.",Antihistamines for Allergic Rhinitis Treatment from the Viewpoint of Nonsedative Properties.,https://www.ncbi.nlm.nih.gov/pubmed/30626077,International journal of molecular sciences,2019 04 26,"Antihistamines targeting the histamine H₁ receptor play an important role in improving and maintaining the quality of life of patients with allergic rhinitis. For more effective and safer use of second-generation drugs, which are recommended by various guidelines, a classification based on their detailed characteristics is necessary. Antihistamines for first-line therapy should not have central depressant/sedative activities. Sedative properties (drowsiness and impaired performance) are associated with the inhibition of central histamine neurons. Brain H₁ receptor occupancy (H₁RO) is a useful index shown to be correlated with indices based on clinical findings. Antihistamines are classified into non-sedating (<20%), less-sedating (20⁻50%), and sedating (≥50%) groups based on H₁RO. Among the non-sedating group, fexofenadine and bilastine are classified into ""non-brain-penetrating antihistamines"" based on the H₁RO. These two drugs have many common chemical properties. However, bilastine has more potent binding affinity to the H₁ receptor, and its action tends to last longer. In well-controlled studies using objective indices, bilastine does not affect psychomotor or driving performance even at twice the usual dose (20 mg). Upon selecting antihistamines for allergic rhinitis, various situations should be taken into our consideration. This review summarizes that the non-brain-penetrating antihistamines should be chosen for the first-line therapy of mild allergic rhinitis.",Hepatotoxicity: Molecular Mechanisms and Pathophysiology.,https://www.ncbi.nlm.nih.gov/pubmed/30626076,International journal of molecular sciences,2019 04 26,"The current Special Issue is devoted to the broad spectrum of hepatotoxicity with its molecular mechanisms and pathophysiology, presented in eight publications [...].",Perspective on Plasma Polymers for Applied Biomaterials Nanoengineering and the Recent Rise of Oxazolines.,https://www.ncbi.nlm.nih.gov/pubmed/30626075,"Materials (Basel, Switzerland)",2019 01 23,"Plasma polymers are unconventional organic thin films which only partially share the properties traditionally attributed to polymeric materials. For instance, they do not consist of repeating monomer units but rather present a highly crosslinked structure resembling the chemistry of the precursor used for deposition. Due to the complex nature of the deposition process, plasma polymers have historically been produced with little control over the chemistry of the plasma phase which is still poorly understood. Yet, plasma polymer research is thriving, in par with the commercialisation of innumerable products using this technology, in fields ranging from biomedical to green energy industries. Here, we briefly summarise the principles at the basis of plasma deposition and highlight recent progress made in understanding the unique chemistry and reactivity of these films. We then demonstrate how carefully designed plasma polymer films can serve the purpose of fundamental research and biomedical applications. We finish the review with a focus on a relatively new class of plasma polymers which are derived from oxazoline-based precursors. This type of coating has attracted significant attention recently due to its unique properties.",Pilot Studies on Two Complementary Bath Products for Atopic Dermatitis Children: Pine-Tar and Tea.,https://www.ncbi.nlm.nih.gov/pubmed/30626074,"Medicines (Basel, Switzerland)",2019 05 01,"Background: Few standardized bath product clinical trials were performed for atopic dermatitis patients. Pine-tar and green tea extracts are plant-derived products that have been described as having anti-allergic effects which may reduce AD disease severity. Methods: The efficacy of two complementary bath products was studied and compared. Efficacy and acceptability of the bath products were measured by patient general acceptability of treatment (GAT: very, good, fair or poor), disease severity (SCORAD: SCoring Atopic Dermatitis), quality of life (CDLQI: Children Dermatology Life Quality Index), and pertinent clinical parameters were measured before and after four weeks of treatment. Sample size calculations for further clinical trials were performed. In one group, nine AD patients were subjected to bathing with a pine-tar bath oil for 10⁻15 min daily for four weeks. In another group, 20 AD subjects bathed with a teabag containing green tea extracts for four weeks. Results: Significant improvements in clinical- and patient-orientated parameters were found in the pine-tar bathing group, but not the tea-bag bathing group. Both groups reported very good/good GAT on the studied products. Teabag bathing was considered not efficacious for further clinical trials. Conclusions: The pilot studies provided preliminary data on the efficacy of pine tar bath oil. We do not document a significant efficacy for bathing with tea extracts. Bathing with pine-tar is potentially a complementary topical treatment with good patient acceptance and adherence, but further evidence-based research for its recommendations is needed.","Use of a Modified DANP-mV Model to Improve Quality of Life in Rural Residents: The Empirical Case of Xingshisi Village, China.",https://www.ncbi.nlm.nih.gov/pubmed/30626073,International journal of environmental research and public health,2019 05 22,"Climate change-related anomalies have increased public concern regarding environmental protection. This has opened newer rural development avenues. In this regard, livability of villages is crucial; it can be evaluated based on the villagers' quality of life (QoL). The WHOQOL-BREF, a comprehensive cross-cultural and cross-disciplinary scale proposed by the World Health Organization to assess QoL, has aided in assessing and improving QoL in different regions. However, the factors of this instrument are mutually influential, necessitating an improvement strategy considering the entire system. This problem may be resolved using the DANP-mV model. However, the traditional DANP-mV model includes many items and responding to all of them is difficult for experts. Therefore, by using the case of Xingshisi Village in China, this study proposed a modified DANP-mV model to provide additional suggestions for systematic improvement of the QoL and livability in the village. Xingshisi is a model village built according to an aspirational benchmark; however, different from the traditional definition of a benchmark, this village exhibits room for improvement. Although the modified model reduces the number of questions from 650 to 168, its effect remains similar to that of the traditional model. Moreover, in the modified model, physical capacity (D₁) presented the largest dimensional gap. The interaction among the factors indicated that considering the effect of the environment (D₄) and developing a systematic improvement strategy are necessary to improve the livability of villages facing limited resources."

Therefore, we adopt the phosphoproteomic analysis, physiological measurement and ultrastructure observation to illustrate the responsive mechanism of J. curcas seedling under chilling (4 °C) stress. After chilling for 6 h, 308 significantly changed phosphoproteins were detected. Prolonged the chilling treatment for 24 h, obvious physiological injury can be observed and a total of 332 phosphoproteins were examined to be significantly changed. After recovery (28 °C) for 24 h, 291 phosphoproteins were varied at the phosphorylation level. GO analysis showed that significantly changed phosphoproteins were mainly responsible for cellular protein modification process, transport, cellular component organization and signal transduction at the chilling and recovery periods. On the basis of protein-protein interaction network analysis, phosphorylation of several protein kinases, such as SnRK2, MEKK1, EDR1, CDPK, EIN2, EIN4, PI4K and 14-3-3 were possibly responsible for cross-talk between ABA, Ca2+, ethylene and phosphoinositide mediated signaling pathways. We also highlighted the phosphorylation of HOS1, APX and PIP2 might be associated with response to chilling stress in J. curcas seedling. These results will be valuable for further study from the molecular breeding perspective.",Which Factors Influence Attentional Functions? Attention Assessed by KiTAP in 105 6-to-10-Year-Old Children.,https://www.ncbi.nlm.nih.gov/pubmed/30626060,"Behavioral sciences (Basel, Switzerland)",2019 02 10,"This research revealed the children with difficulties in attentional functions among healthy children attending primary school and aimed to identify the possible sociodemographic factors, such as the child's age, gender, and school grade, that could influence attentive performance. The participants were 105 children aged 6⁻10 years (M age = 8.6; SD = 1.04), attending primary schools. Family economic condition was mostly at a medium level (63.5%), and parents most frequently had 13 years of schooling. The computerized test KiTAP was administered to children to assess their attentional functions. Results showed a higher frequency of omissions and false alarms and a reduced speed in alertness, go/no-go, and sustained attention tasks compared to Italian norms. Hierarchical regression analyses were run with school grade, gender, and current age as independent variables and mean reaction times (and standard deviation), number of omissions, and false alarms as dependent ones. The results showed that male gender and attending a lower grade impacted on lower attentional performance in several subtests. Girls showed the best performances in tests of distractibility and impulsive reaction tendencies, while higher school grade positively influenced divided and sustained attention. These results could be useful to identify children with major attentional difficulties, and some recommendations for future studies and the implementation of attention empowerment programmes are proposed.",Bisphenol A Exposure and Sperm ACHE Hydroxymethylation in Men.,https://www.ncbi.nlm.nih.gov/pubmed/30626059,International journal of environmental research and public health,2019 05 08,"Exposure to bisphenol A (BPA) has been shown to impact human sperm quality. The epigenetic mechanisms underlying the effect remain unknown. The acetylcholinesterase (ACHE) gene is a sperm-expressed gene encoding the acetylcholine hydrolyzing enzyme acetylcholinesterase and participates in the apoptosis of cells, including sperm. This study aimed to examine whether BPA exposure is associated with the hydroxymethylation level of the sperm ACHE gene. A total of 157 male factory workers were studied, among whom 74 had BPA exposure in the workplace (BPA exposure group) and 83 had no BPA exposure in the workplace (control group). Urine samples were collected for BPA measurement and semen samples were collected to assay for ACHE hydroxymethylation. Sperm ACHE hydroxymethylation level was higher in the BPA exposure group (p = 0.041) compared to the control group. When subjects were categorized according to tertiles of detected BPA level, higher ACHE hydroxymethylation levels were observed for the lowest, middle, and top tertiles compared to those with BPA below the limit of detection (LOD). In a linear regression analysis adjusted for confounders, a positive linear association between urine BPA concentration and 5-hydroxymethylcytosine (5hmC) rate of the sperm ACHE gene was observed, although the association did not reach statistical significance in all categories after being stratified by the BPA tertile. In conclusion, 5hmC of the sperm ACHE gene was positively associated with BPA exposure, which may provide supportive evidence for BPA's effects on male fertility or other health endpoints.",Tail Posture as an Indicator of Tail Biting in Undocked Finishing Pigs.,https://www.ncbi.nlm.nih.gov/pubmed/30626058,Animals : an open access journal from MDPI,2019 02 06,"Tail posture (i.e., hanging or curled) has been suggested to be an indicator of tail biting, and hanging tails predisposed to damage. The aim of this study was to investigate if tail posture was feasible as a tail damage indicator in a commercial setting. The study was carried out on one batch of 459 undocked finishing pigs (30⁻120 kg in weight). Weekly scoring of tail posture was combined with the scoring of tail lesions. Tail posture was observed at feeding to facilitate the usage of the method in commercial settings. A curly tail was observed in 94% of the observations. Pigs with tails scored with ""wound"" were 4.15 (p < 0.0001) times more likely to have hanging tails, and pigs scored with ""inflamed wounds"" were 14.24 (p < 0.0001) times more likely to have hanging tails, compared to pigs with nondamaged tails. Tail posture correctly classified tails with ""wound"" or ""inflamed wound"" 67.5% of the time, with 55.2% sensitivity and 79.7% specificity, respectively. The method of observing the tail position at feeding seems useful as a complement to normal inspection for detecting tail biting before tail wounds are visible to the caretaker.","New 1,2,4-Oxadiazole Nortopsentin Derivatives with Cytotoxic Activity.",https://www.ncbi.nlm.nih.gov/pubmed/30626057,Marine drugs,2019 05 08,"New analogs of nortopsentin, a natural 2,4-bis(3'-indolyl)imidazole alkaloid, in which the central imidazole ring of the natural lead was replaced by a 1,2,4-oxadiazole moiety, and in which a 7-azaindole portion substituted the original indole moiety, were efficiently synthesized. Among all derivatives, prescreened against the HCT-116 colon rectal carcinoma cell line, the two most active compounds were selected and further investigated in different human tumor cells showing IC50 values in the micromolar and submicromolar range. Flow cytometric analysis of propidium iodide-stained MCF-7 cells demonstrated that both the active derivatives caused cell cycle arrest in the G0⁻G1 phase. The cell death mechanism induced by the compounds was considered to be apoptotic by measuring the exposure of phosphatidylserine to the outer membrane and observed morphological evaluation using acridine orange/ethidium bromide double staining. Moreover, further tested on intestinal normal-like differentiated Caco-2 cell line, they exhibited preferential toxicity towards cancer cells.","Erubescensoic Acid, a New Polyketide and a Xanthonopyrone SPF-3059-26 from the Culture of the Marine Sponge-Associated Fungus Penicillium erubescens KUFA 0220 and Antibacterial Activity Evaluation of Some of Its Constituents.",https://www.ncbi.nlm.nih.gov/pubmed/30626056,"Molecules (Basel, Switzerland)",2019 03 21,"A new polyketide erubescensoic acid (1), and the previously reported xanthonopyrone, SPF-3059-26 (2), were isolated from the uninvestigated fractions of the ethyl acetate crude extract of the marine sponge-associated fungus Penicillium erubescens KUFA0220.

Urine, spleen, and other organs collected from the R. aegyptiacus population within South Africa were tested with a hemi-nested RT-PCR assay targeting a partial polymerase gene region of viruses from the Avula- and Rubulavirus genera. Urine was collected over a 14-month period to study the temporal dynamics of viral excretion. Diverse rubulaviruses, including viruses related to human mumps and parainfluenza virus 2, were detected. Active excretion was identified during two peak periods coinciding with the host reproductive cycle. Analysis of additional organs indicated co-infection of individual bats with a number of different putative rubulaviruses, highlighting the limitations of using a single sample type when determining viral presence and diversity. Our findings suggest that R. aegyptiacus can harbor a range of Rubula- and related viruses, some of which are related to known human pathogens.

The corrosion behavior of these inhibitors is investigated using electrochemical and computational techniques. Open circuit potential results reveal predominant cathodic character for the mechanism of aluminum corrosion inhibition by the inhibitors. Inhibition efficiency values from potentiodynamic polarization measurements increase from 46.9 to 70.8% for BTThio and 59.7 to 81.0% for ClGaBTThioPc within the concentration range of 2 to 10 μM. Scanning electron microscopy (SEM) measurements reveal protection of the metal surface from acid attack, in the presence of the inhibitors and energy dispersive X-ray (EDX) measurements show that the most probable way by which the inhibitors protect the metal surface would be by shielding it from the corrosion attacks of Cl- from the acid.

The properties of the composite films, including water absorption, air permeability, and cumulative release rate, were tested. In addition, their hemostatic performance was evaluated. The results showed that the appearance of the films with good adhesion was smooth and porous. FTIR showed that chemical crosslinking between carboxymethyl chitosan and sodium alginate was successful. The excellent cumulative release of tranexamic acid in the composite films (60⁻80%) gives the films a significant procoagulant effect.

Generally, a single element, which is mainly the promoter, is deduced from the resulting gene clusters and employed to construct a new expression vector. However, expression patterns of target proteins under the incorporated promoter are often inconsistent with those shown in clones harboring plasmids with gene clusters. These results suggest that the integrated set of gene clusters with diverse cis- and trans-acting elements is evolutionarily tuned as a complete set for gene expression, and is an expression module with all the components for the expression of a nested open reading frame (ORF). This possibility is further supported by truncation and/or serial deletion analysis of this module in which the expression of the nested ORF is highly fluctuated or reduced frequently, despite being supported by plentiful cis-acting elements in the spanning regions around the ORF such as the promoter, ribosome binding site (RBS), terminator, and 3'-/5'-UTRs for gene expression. Here, we examined whether an innate module with a naturally overexpressed gene could be considered as a scaffold for an expression system. For a proof-of-principle study, we mined a complete expression module with an innately overexpressed ORF in E. coli from a metagenomics DNA library, and incorporated it into a vector that had no regulatory element for expressing the insert. We obtained successful expression of several inserts such as MBP, GFPuv, β-glucosidase, and esterase using this simple construct without tuning and codon optimization of the target insert."

In this study, CO₂-CH₄ mixtures were sorbed at 35 °C in 4,4'-(hexafluoroisopropylidene)diphthalic dianhydride (6FDA)-m-phenylenediamine (mPDA)-a polyimide of remarkable performance. The existence of a linear trend for all data of mixed-gas CO₂ versus CH₄ solubility coefficients-regardless of mixture concentration-was observed for 6FDA-mPDA and other polymeric films; the slope of this trend was identified as the ratio of gas solubilities at infinite dilution. The CO₂/CH₄ mixed-gas solubility selectivity of 6FDA-mPDA and previously reported polymers was higher than the equimolar pure-gas value and increased with pressure from the infinite dilution value. The analysis of CO₂-CH₄ mixed-gas concentration-averaged effective diffusion coefficients of equimolar feeds showed that CO₂ diffusivity was not affected by CH₄. Our data indicate that the decrease of CO₂/CH₄ mixed-gas diffusion, and permeability selectivity from the pure-gas values, resulted from an increase in the methane diffusion coefficient in mixtures. This effect was the result of an alteration of the size sieving properties of 6FDA-mPDA as a consequence of CO₂ presence in the 6FDA-mPDA film matrix.",Compound and Dose-Dependent Effects of Two Neonicotinoid Pesticides on Honey Bee (Apis mellifera) Metabolic Physiology.,https://www.ncbi.nlm.nih.gov/pubmed/30626039,Insects,2019 02 13,"Use of neonicotinoid pesticides is now ubiquitous, and consequently non-targeted arthropods are exposed to their residues at sub-lethal doses. Exposure to these neurotoxins may be a major contributor to poor honey bee colony health. Few studies have explored how sub lethal exposure to neonicotinoids affects honey bee metabolic physiology, including nutritional and energetic homeostasis, both of which are important for maintaining colony health. Reported here are results from a study of chronic oral exposure of honey bees to two sub lethal concentrations of clothianidin and imidacloprid. Neonicotinoids altered important aspects of honey bee nutritional and metabolic physiology in a compound and dose-dependent manner; both compounds at low doses reduced honey bee body weight. Low-dose clothianidin exposure resulted in bees having protein, lipids, carbohydrates, and glycogen levels similar to newly emerged bees. High-dose clothianidin exposure lowered lipids and glycogen content of bees. High-dose imidacloprid exposure resulted in bees having depressed metabolic rate. Low-dose imidacloprid exposure resulted in bees consuming low and high levels of protein and carbohydrate rich foods, respectively. Results suggest neonicotinoids interfere with honey bee endocrine neurophysiological pathways.

We used Israeli acute paralysis virus (IAPV) as an experimental pathogen because it is relevant to bee health but is not omnipresent. Queens were observed spending 50% of their time with healthy workers, 32% with infected workers, and 18% without interaction. However, the overall bias toward healthy workers was not statistically significant, and there was considerable individual to individual variability. We found that physical contact between infected workers and queens leads to high queen infection in some cases, suggesting that IAPV infections also spread through close bodily contact. Across experiments, queens exhibited lower IAPV titers than surrounding workers. Thus, our results indicate that honey bee queens are better protected by individual and social immunity, but this protection is insufficient to prevent IAPV infections completely.",Termite Communities along A Disturbance Gradient in a West African Savanna.,https://www.ncbi.nlm.nih.gov/pubmed/30626037,Insects,2019 02 13,"(1) Background: Termites are important ecosystem engineers, crucial for the maintenance of tropical biodiversity and ecosystem functioning. But they are also pests which cause billions of dollars in damage annually to humans. Currently, our understanding of the mechanisms influencing species occurrences is limited and we do not know what distinguishes pest from non-pest species. (2) Method: We analyzed how anthropogenic disturbance (agriculture) affects species occurrences. We tested the hypothesis that strong disturbance functions as a habitat filter and selects for a subset of species which are major pests of crop. Using a cross-sectional approach, we studied termite assemblage composition along a disturbance gradient from fields to 12-year-old fallows in a West African savanna. (3) Results: We reliably identified 19 species using genetic markers with a mean of about 10 species-many of them from the same feeding type-co-occurring locally. Supporting our hypothesis, disturbance was associated with environmental filtering of termites from the regional species pool, maybe via its effect on vegetation type. The most heavily disturbed sites were characterized by a subset of termite species which are well-known pests of crop. (4) Conclusion: These results are in line with the idea that strong anthropogenic disturbance selects for termite pest species.",In-Fiber Mach-Zehnder Interferometer Based on Three-Core Fiber for Measurement of Directional Bending.,https://www.ncbi.nlm.nih.gov/pubmed/30626036,"Sensors (Basel, Switzerland)",2019 01 24,"A highly sensitive directional bending sensor based on a three-core fiber (TCF) Mach-Zehnder interferometer (MZI) is presented in this study. This MZI-based bending sensor was fabricated by fusion-splicing a section of TCF between two single-mode fibers (SMF) with core-offset. Due to the location of the core in the TCF, a bend applied to the TCF-based MZI led to an elongation or shortening of the core, which makes the sensor suitable for directional bending measurement. To analyze the bending characteristics, two types of TCF-based sensors, with the fusion-spliced core located at different positions between the SMFs, were investigated. A swept source was employed in the measurement technique. The experimental results showed that, for the two types of sensors in this setup, the bending sensitivities of the two sensors were 15.36 nm/m-1 and 3.11 nm/m-1 at the bending direction of 0°, and -20.48 nm/m-1 and -5.29 nm/m-1 at the bending direction of 180°. The temperature sensitivities of the two sensors were 0.043 nm/°C and 0.041 nm/°C, respectively. The proposed sensors are compact, versatile, inexpensive to fabricate, and are expected to have potential applications in biomedical sensing.",The Impact of Dietary Grape Seed Meal on Healthy and Aflatoxin B1 Afflicted Microbiota of Pigs after Weaning.,https://www.ncbi.nlm.nih.gov/pubmed/30626035,Toxins,2019 02 06,"The study investigated the effect of grape seed (GS) meal, aflatoxin (AFB1), or their combination on the large intestine microbiota of weanling piglets. Twenty-four piglets were allocated into four groups based on diet composition: (1) Control group; (2) AFB1 (320 g/kg feed) group; (3) GS group (8% inclusion in the diet); (4) AFB1 + GS group. After 30 days of experiment, the colon content was used for microbiota analyses; after isolation of total bacterial genomic DNA, V3/V4 regions of the 16S rRNA amplicons were sequenced using the Illumina MiSeq platform. The raw sequences were analyzed using the v.1.9.1 QIIME pipeline software. 157 numbers of OTUs were identified among all four dietary groups with 26 of them being prevalent above 0.05% in the total relative abundance. GS and AFB1 increase the relative abundance of phylum Bacteroidetes and Proteobacteria, while decreasing the Firmicutes abundance in a synergic manner as compared with the individual treatments. An additive or synergistic action of the two treatments was identified for Lactobacillus, Prevotella and Campylobacter, while rather an antagonistic effect was observed on Lachnospira. The action mechanisms of aflatoxin B1 and grape seed meal that drive the large intestine microbiota to these changes are not known and need further investigations.",A Simple and Fast Method to Synthesize Cubic Iridium Nanoparticles with Clean Surface Free from Surfactants.,https://www.ncbi.nlm.nih.gov/pubmed/30626034,"Nanomaterials (Basel, Switzerland)",2019 02 07,"Cubic Iridium nanoparticles without any surfactants on the surface have been synthesized successfully in this work. The process of synthesis was quite simple by just injecting one drop of 400 µL solution containing Iridium precursor onto Cu foil (1 cm × 1 cm), and through galvanic reaction between the Ir precursor and Cu foil, the cubic Iridium nanoparticle could be obtained quite quickly (<30 s). The Cu foil played the roles of both reducing agent and substrate. This method could also be employed to synthesize cubic nanoparticles of other Pt-group metals such as Rh. By employing this method, cubic metal nanoparticles with surfactant-free surfaces could be produced economically and efficiently, and as a result, a realistic relationship between structure and catalytic activity could be established.","The Dynamics of Deformed Wing Virus Concentration and Host Defensive Gene Expression after Varroa Mite Parasitism in Honey Bees, Apis mellifera.",https://www.ncbi.nlm.nih.gov/pubmed/30626033,Insects,2019 02 13,"The synergistic interactions between the ectoparasitic mite Varroa destructor and Deformed wing virus (DWV) lead to the reduction in lifespan of the European honey bee Apis mellifera and often have been implicated in colony losses worldwide. However, to date, the underlying processes and mechanisms that form the multipartite interaction between the bee, mite, and virus have not been fully explained. To gain a better understanding of honey bees' defense response to Varroa mite infestation and DWV infection, the DWV titers and transcription profiles of genes originating from RNAi, immunity, wound response, and homeostatic signaling pathways were monitored over a period of eight days. With respect to DWV, we observed low viral titers at early timepoints that coincided with high levels of Toll pathway transcription factor Dorsal, and its downstream immune effector molecules Hymenoptaecin, Apidaecin, Abaecin, and Defensin 1. However, we observed a striking increase in viral titers beginning after two days that coincided with a decrease in Dorsal levels and its corresponding immune effector molecules, and the small ubiquitin-like modifier (SUMO) ligase repressor of Dorsal, PIAS3. We observed a similar expression pattern for genes expressing transcripts for the RNA interference (Dicer/Argonaute), wound/homeostatic (Janus Kinase), and tissue growth (Map kinase/Wnt) pathways. Our results demonstrate that on a whole, honey bees are able to mount an immediate, albeit, temporally limited, immune and homeostatic response to Varroa and DWV infections, after which downregulation of these pathways leaves the bee vulnerable to expansive viral replication. The critical insights into the defense response upon Varroa and DWV challenges generated in this study may serve as a solid base for future research on the development of effective and efficient disease management strategies in honey bees.",Modulation of RAB7A Protein Expression Determines Resistance to Cisplatin through Late Endocytic Pathway Impairment and Extracellular Vesicular Secretion.,https://www.ncbi.nlm.nih.gov/pubmed/30626032,Cancers,2019 02 06,"Cisplatin (CDDP) is widely used in treatment of cancer, yet patients often develop resistance with consequent therapeutical failure.

ETEC possess several virulence factors to infect its host, including colonization factors and enterotoxins. Production of heat-stable enterotoxins (STs) by most ETEC plays an essential role in triggering diarrhea and ETEC pathogenesis. In this review, we summarize the heat-stable enterotoxins of ETEC strains from different species as well as the molecular mechanisms used by these heat-stable enterotoxins to trigger diarrhea. As recently described, intestinal epithelial cells are important modulators of the intestinal immune system. Thus, we also discuss the impact of the heat-stable enterotoxins on this role of the intestinal epithelium and how these enterotoxins might affect intestinal immune cells. Finally, the latest developments in vaccination strategies to protect against infections with ST secreting ETEC strains are discussed. This review might inform and guide future research on heat-stable enterotoxins to further unravel their molecular pathogenesis, as well as to accelerate vaccine design."

Although lichens have remarkable potential in natural product research and industry, the molecular mechanisms underlying the biosynthesis of lichen metabolites are poorly understood. Here we use genome mining and comparative genomics to assess biosynthetic gene clusters and their putative regulators in the genomes of two lichen-forming fungi, which have substantial commercial value in the perfume industry, Evernia prunastri and Pseudevernia furfuracea. We report a total of 80 biosynthetic gene clusters (polyketide synthases (PKS), non-ribosomal peptide synthetases and terpene synthases) in E. prunastri and 51 in P. furfuracea. We present an in-depth comparison of 11 clusters, which show high homology between the two species. A ketosynthase (KS) phylogeny shows that biosynthetic gene clusters from E. prunastri and P. furfuracea are widespread across the Fungi. The phylogeny includes 15 genomes of lichenized fungi and all fungal PKSs with known functions from the MIBiG database. Phylogenetically closely related KS domains predict not only similar PKS architecture but also similar cluster architecture.

The chemical composition appeared homogeneous and characterized by the occurrence of four derivatives which exhibited a conjugated alkene dialkyne moiety. They were identified for the first time in an essential oil from S. africana. The collective oil sample exhibited moderate antimicrobial and antioxidant activities whereas the anti-inflammatory activity presented a real potential.

Few studies examine how built environment interventions increase physical activity (PA). Active design (AD) utilizes strategies in affordable housing to improve resident health. We assessed how AD housing affects PA among low-income families in Brooklyn, New York. Participants were recruited at lease signings in 2016 from a new AD apartment complex and two recently renovated comparison buildings without AD features. Eligibility included age ≥18 years with no contraindications to exercise. Anthropometric data were collected. PA was self-reported using the Recent and Global Physical Activity Questionnaires. Smartphone users shared their tracked step. Data collection was repeated one year after move-in. All data were analyzed using SPSS. Eighty-eight eligible participants completed the initial questionnaire (36 AD and 52 from 2 comparison buildings) at baseline (T0). There were no differences between AD and comparison cohorts in: stair use, PA, sitting time or, mean waist-to-hip ratio (WHR) at T0. However, the AD cohort had a lower baseline BMI (27.6 vs. 31.0, p = 0.019). At one-year follow-up (T1), 75 participants completed our survey including a 64% retention rate among those who previously completed the T0 questionnaire. Among T0 questionnaire respondents, mean daily steps increased at T1 among AD participants who moved from an elevator building (∆6782, p = 0.051) and in the comparison group (∆2960, p = 0.023). Aggregate moderate work-related activity was higher at T1 in the AD building (746 vs. 401, p = 0.031). AD building women reported more work-related PA overall but AD men engaged in more moderate recreational PA. Living in an AD building can enhance low-income residents' PA.

Recently, however, an allegedly more general theoretical foundation for multitarget tracking has been proposed. In it, the constituent components of FISST have been systematically replaced by mathematically more complicated concepts-and, especially, by the very measure theory and measure-theoretic p.p.'s that FISST eschews. It is shown that this proposed alternative is actually a mathematical paraphrase of part of FISST that does not correctly address the technical idiosyncrasies of the multitarget tracking application.",Tributyrin in Inflammation: Does White Adipose Tissue Affect Colorectal Cancer?,https://www.ncbi.nlm.nih.gov/pubmed/30626010,Nutrients,2019 03 20,"Colorectal cancer affects the large intestine, leading to loss of white adipose tissue (WAT) and alterations in adipokine secretion. Lower incidence of colorectal cancer is associated with increased fibre intake. Fructooligosaccharides (FOS) are fibres that increase production of butyrate by the intestinal microbiota. Tributyrin, a prodrug of butyric acid, exerts beneficial anti-inflammatory effects on colorectal cancer. Our aim was to characterise the effects of diets rich in FOS and tributyrin within the context of a colon carcinogenesis model, and characterise possible support of tumorigenesis by WAT. C57/BL6 male mice were divided into four groups: a control group (CT) fed with chow diet and three colon carcinogenesis-induced groups fed either with chow diet (CA), tributyrin-supplemented diet (BUT), or with FOS-supplemented diet. Colon carcinogenesis decreased adipose mass in subcutaneous, epididymal, and retroperitoneal tissues, while also reducing serum glucose and leptin concentrations. However, it did not alter the concentrations of adiponectin, interleukin (IL)-6, IL-10, and tumour necrosis factor alpha (TNF)-α in WAT. Additionally, the supplements did not revert the colon cancer affected parameters. The BUT group exhibited even higher glucose tolerance and levels of IL-6, VEGF, and TNF-α in WAT. To conclude our study, FOS and butyrate supplements were not beneficial. In addition, butyrate worsened adipose tissue inflammation.",A Triple Amino Acid Substitution at Position 88/94/95 in Glycoprotein GP2a of Type 1 Porcine Reproductive and Respiratory Syndrome Virus (PRRSV1) Is Responsible for Adaptation to MARC-145 Cells.,https://www.ncbi.nlm.nih.gov/pubmed/30626009,Viruses,2019 05 16,"The Meat Animal Research Center-145 (MARC-145) cell line has been proven to be valuable for viral attenuation regarding vaccine development and production. Cell-adaptation is necessary for the efficient replication of porcine reproductive and respiratory syndrome virus (PRRSV) in these cells. Multiple sequence analysis revealed consistent amino acid substitutions in GP2a (V88F, M94I, F95L) of MARC-145 cell-adapted strains. To investigate the putative effect of these substitutions, mutations at either position 88, 94, 95, and their combinations were introduced into two PRRSV1 (13V091 and IVI-1173) infectious clones followed by the recovery of viable recombinants. When comparing the replication kinetics in MARC-145 cells, a strongly positive effect on the growth characteristics of the 13V091 strain (+2.1 log10) and the IVI-1173 strain (+1.7 log10) compared to wild-type (WT) virus was only observed upon triple amino acid substitution at positions 88 (V88F), 94 (M94I), and 95 (F95L) of GP2a, suggesting that the triple mutation is a determining factor in PRRSV1 adaptation to MARC-145 cells.",Structural Elucidation of a Novel Lipooligosaccharide from the Antarctic Bacterium OMVs Producer Shewanella sp.

This strain biosynthesizes a single major cargo protein in the OMVs, a fact that makes Shewanella sp. HM13 a good candidate for the production of extracellular recombinant proteins. Therefore, the structural characterization of the components of the vesicles, such as lipopolysaccharides, takes on a fundamental role for understanding the mechanism of biogenesis of the OMVs and their applications. The aim of this study was to investigate the structure of the oligosaccharide (OS) isolated from Shewanella sp. HM13 cells as the first step for a comparison with that from the vesicles. The lipooligosaccharide (LOS) was isolated from dry cells, purified, and hydrolyzed by alkaline treatment. The obtained OS was analyzed completely, and the composition of fatty acids was obtained by chemical methods. In particular, the OS was investigated in detail by ¹H and 13C NMR spectroscopy and MALDI-TOF mass spectrometry. The oligosaccharide was characterized by the presence of a residue of 8-amino-3,8-dideoxy-manno-oct-2-ulosonic acid (Kdo8N) and of a d,d-heptose, with both residues being identified in other oligosaccharides from Shewanella species.","Endothelial Protein C Receptor (EPCR), Protease Activated Receptor-1 (PAR-1) and Their Interplay in Cancer Growth and Metastatic Dissemination.",https://www.ncbi.nlm.nih.gov/pubmed/30626007,Cancers,2019 02 06,"Endothelial protein C receptor (EPCR) and protease activated receptor 1 (PAR-1) by themselves play important role in cancer growth and dissemination. Moreover, interactions between the two receptors are essential for tumor progression. EPCR is a cell surface transmembrane glycoprotein localized predominantly on endothelial cells (ECs). It is a vital component of the activated protein C (APC)-mediated anticoagulant and cytoprotective signaling cascade. PAR-1, which belongs to a family of G protein⁻coupled cell surface receptors, is also widely distributed on endothelial and blood cells, where it plays a critical role in hemostasis. Both EPCR and PAR-1, generally considered coagulation-related receptors, are implicated in carcinogenesis and dissemination of diverse tumor types, and their expression correlates with clinical outcome of cancer patients. Existing data explain some mechanisms by which EPCR/PAR-1 affects cancer growth and metastasis; however, the exact molecular basis of cancer invasion associated with the signaling is still obscure. Here, we discuss the role of EPCR and PAR-1 reciprocal interactions in cancer progression as well as potential therapeutic options targeted specifically to interact with EPCR/PAR-1-induced signaling in cancer patients."

Therefore, this short review discusses the advantages and disadvantages of the three main categories of stem cells: embryonic stem cells, mesenchymal stem cells and induced pluripotent stem cells in the context of bone regeneration for dentistry-associated conditions. Importantly, when deciding upon the right strategy, the selection needs to be made in concordance with the morbidity and the life-threatening level of the condition in discussion.

To study disease pathogenesis and to develop efficient and safe therapies, the use of an appropriate animal model is a critical concern. Adult mice with gene knockouts of the interferon α/β (IFN-α/β) receptor (IFNAR(-/-)) have been described as a model of arbovirus infections. Studies with the natural hosts of these viruses are limited by financial and ethical issues, and in some cases, the need to have facilities with a biosafety level 3 with sufficient space to accommodate large animals. Moreover, the number of animals in the experiments must provide results with statistical significance. Recent advances in animal models in the last decade among other gaps in knowledge have contributed to the better understanding of arbovirus infections. A tremendous advantage of the IFNAR(-/-) mouse model is the availability of a wide variety of reagents that can be used to study many aspects of the immune response to the virus. Although extrapolation of findings in mice to natural hosts must be done with care due to differences in the biology between mouse and humans, experimental infections of IFNAR(-/-) mice with several studied arboviruses closely mimics hallmarks of these viruses in their natural host. Therefore, IFNAR(-/-) mice are a good model to facilitate studies on arbovirus transmission, pathogenesis, virulence, and the protective efficacy of new vaccines. In this review article, the most important arboviruses that have been studied using the IFNAR(-/-) mouse model will be reviewed.",Detection of Low-Frequency Mutations and Identification of Heat-Induced Artifactual Mutations Using Duplex Sequencing.,https://www.ncbi.nlm.nih.gov/pubmed/30625989,International journal of molecular sciences,2019 04 26,"We present a genome-wide comparative and comprehensive analysis of three different sequencing methods (conventional next generation sequencing (NGS), tag-based single strand sequencing (e.g., SSCS), and Duplex Sequencing for investigating mitochondrial mutations in human breast epithelial cells. Duplex Sequencing produces a single strand consensus sequence (SSCS) and a duplex consensus sequence (DCS) analysis, respectively. Our study validates that although high-frequency mutations are detectable by all the three sequencing methods with the similar accuracy and reproducibility, rare (low-frequency) mutations are not accurately detectable by NGS and SSCS. Even with conservative bioinformatical modification to overcome the high error rate of NGS, the NGS frequency of rare mutations is 7.0 × 10-4. The frequency is reduced to 1.3 × 10-4 with SSCS and is further reduced to 1.0 × 10-5 using DCS. Rare mutation context spectra obtained from NGS significantly vary across independent experiments, and it is not possible to identify a dominant mutation context. In contrast, rare mutation context spectra are consistently similar in all independent DCS experiments. We have systematically identified heat-induced artifactual variants and corrected the artifacts using Duplex Sequencing. Specific sequence contexts were analyzed to examine the effects of neighboring bases on the accumulation of heat-induced artifactual variants. All of these artifacts are stochastically occurring rare mutations. C > A/G > T, a signature of oxidative damage, is the most increased (170-fold) heat-induced artifactual mutation type. Our results strongly support the claim that Duplex Sequencing accurately detects low-frequency mutations and identifies and corrects artifactual mutations introduced by heating during DNA preparation.",Analysis of Sleep Macrostructure in Patients Diagnosed with Parkinson's Disease.,https://www.ncbi.nlm.nih.gov/pubmed/30625988,"Behavioral sciences (Basel, Switzerland)",2019 02 10,"Patients diagnosed with Parkinson's disease present sleep disorders with a higher frequency than the general population. The sleep architecture in these patients shows variations with respect to the normal population, so in this work it was decided to investigate the characteristics of the macroarchitecture of sleep in patients diagnosed with Parkinson's disease. A polysomnographic study was carried out on 77 patients diagnosed with Parkinson's disease. All the studies were processed according to the AASM Manual for the Scoring of Sleep and Associated Events v.2.2, and to the criteria of the International Classification of Sleep Disorders 3rd ed. (2014). Processing was carried out using descriptive statistics, as well as non-parametric analysis for comparison between cases and controls. The group of patients showed significant reductions of the N2, N3, and REM sleep stages when compared with a control group, as well as a significant increase in intra-sleep wakefulness. The number of REM⁻NoREM sleep cycles and sleep efficiency showed marked reduction compared to the control group. There was a statistically significant difference in the macroarchitecture of sleep between patients diagnosed with Parkinson's disease and healthy controls.",In Silico Analysis of Pacific Oyster (Crassostrea gigas) Transcriptome over Developmental Stages Reveals Candidate Genes for Larval Settlement.,https://www.ncbi.nlm.nih.gov/pubmed/30625986,International journal of molecular sciences,2019 04 26,"Following their planktonic phase, the larvae of benthic marine organisms must locate a suitable habitat to settle and metamorphose. For oysters, larval adhesion occurs at the pediveliger stage with the secretion of a proteinaceous bioadhesive produced by the foot, a specialized and ephemeral organ. Oyster bioadhesive is highly resistant to proteomic extraction and is only produced in very low quantities, which explains why it has been very little examined in larvae to date. In silico analysis of nucleic acid databases could help to identify genes of interest implicated in settlement. In this work, the publicly available transcriptome of Pacific oyster Crassostrea gigas over its developmental stages was mined to select genes highly expressed at the pediveliger stage. Our analysis revealed 59 sequences potentially implicated in adhesion of C. gigas larvae. Some related proteins contain conserved domains already described in other bioadhesives. We propose a hypothetic composition of C. gigas bioadhesive in which the protein constituent is probably composed of collagen and the von Willebrand Factor domain could play a role in adhesive cohesion. Genes coding for enzymes implicated in DOPA chemistry were also detected, indicating that this modification is also potentially present in the adhesive of pediveliger larvae.",Fish Collagen Surgical Compress Repairing Characteristics on Wound Healing Process In Vivo.,https://www.ncbi.nlm.nih.gov/pubmed/30625985,Marine drugs,2019 05 08,"The development of biomaterials with the potential to accelerate wound healing is a great challenge in biomedicine. In this study, four types of samples including pepsin soluble collagen sponge (PCS), acid soluble collagen sponge (ACS), bovine collagen electrospun I (BCE I) and bovine collagen electrospun II (BCE II) were used as wound dressing materials. We showed that the PCS, ACS, BCE I and BCE II treated rats increased the percentage of wound contraction, reduced the inflammatory infiltration, and accelerated the epithelization and healing. PCS, ACS, BCE I, and BCE II significantly enhanced the total protein and hydroxyproline level in rats. ACS could induce more fibroblasts proliferation and differentiation than PCS, however, both PCS and ACS had a lower effect than BCE I and BCE II. PCS, ACS, BCE I, and BCE II could regulate deposition of collagen, which led to excellent alignment in the wound healing process. There were similar effects on inducing the level of cytokines including EGF, FGF, and vascular endothelial marker CD31 among these four groups. Accordingly, this study disclosed that collagens (PCS and ACS) from tilapia skin and bovine collagen electrospun (BCE I and BCE II) have significant bioactivity and could accelerate wound healing rapidly and effectively in rat model.",Increasing the TRPM2 Channel Expression in Human Neuroblastoma SH-SY5Y Cells Augments the Susceptibility to ROS-Induced Cell Death.,https://www.ncbi.nlm.nih.gov/pubmed/30625984,Cells,2019 02 07,"Human neuroblastoma SH-SY5Y cells are a widely-used human neuronal cell model in the study of neurodegeneration. A recent study shows that, 1-methyl-4-phenylpyridine ion (MPP), which selectively causes dopaminergic neuronal death leading to Parkinson's disease-like symptoms, can reduce SH-SY5Y cell viability by inducing H₂O₂ generation and subsequent TRPM2 channel activation. MPP-induced cell death is enhanced by increasing the TRPM2 expression. By contrast, increasing the TRPM2 expression has also been reported to support SH-SY5Y cell survival after exposure to H₂O₂, leading to the suggestion of a protective role for the TRPM2 channel. To clarify the role of reactive oxygen species (ROS)-induced TRPM2 channel activation in SH-SY5Y cells, we generated a stable SH-SY5Y cell line overexpressing the human TRPM2 channel and examined cell death and cell viability after exposure to H₂O₂ in the wild-type and TRPM2-overexpressing SH-SY5Y cells. Exposure to H₂O₂ resulted in concentration-dependent cell death and reduction in cell viability in both cell types. TRPM2 overexpression remarkably augmented H₂O₂-induced cell death and reduction in cell viability. Furthermore, H₂O₂-induced cell death in both the wild-type and TRPM2-overexpressing cells was prevented by 2-APB, a TRPM2 inhibitor, and also by PJ34 and DPQ, poly(ADP-ribose) polymerase (PARP) inhibitors. Collectively, our results show that increasing the TRPM2 expression renders SH-SY5Y cells to be more susceptible to ROS-induced cell death and reinforce the notion that the TRPM2 channel plays a critical role in conferring ROS-induced cell death. It is anticipated that SH-SY5Y cells can be useful for better understanding the molecular and signaling mechanisms for ROS-induced TRPM2-mediated neurodegeneration in the pathogenesis of neurodegenerative diseases.","Evaluation of Reliability of the Recomputed Nutrient Intake Data in the National Heart, Lung, and Blood Institute Twin Study.",https://www.ncbi.nlm.nih.gov/pubmed/30625983,Nutrients,2019 03 20,"The nutrient intake dataset is crucial in epidemiological studies. The latest version of the food composition database includes more types of nutrients than previous ones and can be used to obtain data on nutrient intake that could not be estimated before. Usual food consumption data were collected among 910 twins between 1969 and 1973 through dietary history interviews, and then used to calculate intake of eight types of nutrients (energy intake, carbohydrate, protein, cholesterol, total fat, and saturated, monounsaturated, and polyunsaturated fatty acids) in the National Heart, Lung, and Blood Institute Twin Study. We recalculated intakes using the food composition database updated in 2008. Several different statistical methods were used to evaluate the validity and the reliability of the recalculated intake data. Intra-class correlation coefficients between recalculated and original intake values were above 0.99 for all nutrients. R² values for regression models were above 0.90 for all nutrients except polyunsaturated fatty acids (R² = 0.63). In Bland⁻Altman plots, the percentage of scattering points that outlay the mean plus or minus two standard deviations lines was less than 5% for all nutrients. The arithmetic mean percentage of quintile agreement was 78.5% and that of the extreme quintile disagreement was 0.1% for all nutrients between the two datasets. Recalculated nutrient intake data is in strong agreement with the original one, supporting the reliability of the recalculated data. It is also implied that recalculation is a cost-efficient approach to obtain the intake of nutrients unavailable at baseline.",Assessing the Impact of Vehicle Speed Limits and Fleet Composition on Air Quality Near a School.,https://www.ncbi.nlm.nih.gov/pubmed/30625982,International journal of environmental research and public health,2019 05 08,"Traffic is a major source of urban air pollution that affects health, especially among children. As lower speed limits are commonly applied near schools in many cities, and different governments have different policies on vehicle fleet composition, this research estimated how different speed limits and fleet emissions affect air quality near a primary school. Based on data of traffic, weather, and background air quality records in Dublin from 2013, traffic, emission, and dispersion models were developed to assess the impact of different speed limits and fleet composition changes against current conditions. Outside the school, hypothetical speed limit changes from 30 km/h to 50 km/h could reduce the concentration of NO₂ and PM10 by 3% and 2%; shifts in the fleet from diesel to petrol vehicles could reduce these pollutants by 4% and 3% but would increase the traffic-induced concentrations of CO and Benzene by 63% and 35%. These changes had significantly larger impacts on air quality on streets with higher pollutant concentrations. Findings suggest that both road safety and air quality should be considered when determining speed limits. Furthermore, fleet composition has different impacts on different pollutants and there are no clear benefits associated with incentivising either diesel or petrol engine vehicles."

In 2016, severe PM2.5 pollution (PM2.5 > 250 μg/m3) lasted over 6 days and affected over 23 million people. A major challenge in dealing with this issue is the uncertainty regarding the influence of individual meteorological factors to the overall PM2.5 concentration in Beijing. Thus, applying an empirical regression method to long-term ground-based PM2.5 data and meteorological sounding measurements, we attempted to analyze the influence of individual meteorological factors on PM2.5 pollution during winters in Beijing. We found that horizontal dilution and vertical aggregation plays a major role in PM2.5 pollution during the winter of 2016. The impact of horizontal wind on PM2.5 concentration in Beijing was mainly from its dilution, the dilution of northerly wind contributed 27.8% in 2016, far below its contribution in 2015 (32.2%). The contribution from the growing vertical aggregation observed in 2016 was mainly the result of both the lower height of the planetary boundary layer and the greater depth of the temperature inversion. The dilution of the planetary boundary layer height contributed 9.8% to PM2.5 pollution in 2016, 5.4% lower than that in 2017. Compared with the temperature difference of the inversion layer, the temperature inversion depth better reflects the aggregated impact of temperature inversions to PM2.5, which was 10.9% in 2015, and the ratio rose to 14.3% in 2016. Relative humidity is also an important impacting factor, which contributed 41.0%, far higher than the ratio in 2017 (26.7%). Such results imply that we should focus on not only local emission control, but also horizontal atmospheric transport and meteorological conditions in order to provide a more accurate analysis of pollution mechanisms, conductive to air pollution governance in Beijing.",Impact of biochar application on yield-scaled greenhouse gas intensity: A meta-analysis.,https://www.ncbi.nlm.nih.gov/pubmed/30625683,The Science of the total environment,2019 02 21,"The application of biochar to agricultural ecosystems is a potential solution to mitigate climate change and guarantee food security. However, the impacts of biochar on greenhouse gas emissions and crop yield are usually evaluated separately and the results are contradictory in individual studies. In this study, a meta-analysis was conducted based on data from 28 peer-reviewed studies to quantify the impacts of biochar application on greenhouse gas emissions and crop yield using yield-scaled greenhouse gas intensity (GHGI). Potential factors (experimental conditions and properties of soil and biochar) influencing the effect of biochar on yield-scaled GHGI were explored. The results showed that overall, biochar significantly reduced yield-scaled GHGI by 29%. The reductions in yield-scaled GHGI induced by biochar varied with different experimental conditions and properties of soil and biochar. However, the difference was only significant between the two cropping systems, with significantly greater reduction being observed in dry lands (-41%) than in paddy fields (-17%). Therefore, it is suggested that biochar amendment in dry lands may bring more environmental and agronomic benefits than that in paddy fields. The response of crop yield to biochar application further implied that biochar made from crop residue, biochar produced at low pyrolysis temperatures (≤400 °C), and biochar with high pH (>9.0) might contribute to save the production cost of biochar while promoting crop yield in agricultural ecosystems. Long-term field trials are required to elucidate the persistence of the impact of biochar on reducing yield-scaled GHGI and to clarify the underlying mechanisms. The balance between the price of biochar production and the benefits brought by biochar should also be focused in further studies.",Acetate promotes microbial reductive debromination of tetrabromobisphenol A during the startup phase of anaerobic wastewater sludge bioreactors.,https://www.ncbi.nlm.nih.gov/pubmed/30625682,The Science of the total environment,2019 04 26,"The detection of increasing concentrations of tetrabromobisphenol A (TBBPA) in wastewater treatment plants is raising concerns as TBBPA has been identified as a potentially toxic flame retardant. The objectives of this study were to evaluate the effect of acetate biostimulation on TBBPA microbial reductive debromination, and the response of anaerobic sludge associated microbial communities repeatedly exposed to TBBPA. Results indicate that the bulk of the microbial community did not experience significant shifts as a result of TBBPA exposure, and that only a small fraction of the community responded to the presence of TBBPA. Taxa most likely responsible for TBBPA transformation affiliated to Clostridiales and the wastewater sludge group Blvii28. The biostimulating effect of acetate was only observed during reactor startup, when acetogenesis was likely not yet occurring. However, when acetate likely started to be microbially generated in the reactor, acetate addition resulted in a slight but significant inhibiting effect on TBBPA transformation. A significant increase of hydrogenotrophic methanogens in the TBBPA-spiked reactor overtime implies that TBBPA degraders were not in direct competition with methanogens for H2. These results strongly suggest that TBBPA degrading taxa might have been primarily using acetate as an electron donor for the reductive debromination of TBBPA.","Natural iron fertilization of the coastal ocean by ""blackwater rivers"".",https://www.ncbi.nlm.nih.gov/pubmed/30625681,The Science of the total environment,2019 02 21,"The present study elucidates the role of natural iron fertilization of the coastal ocean by so-called ""blackwater rivers"". Areas of marsh, fen, peatland, boreal forest etc. are characterized by organic-rich soils. From those soils, humic substances (humic and fulvic acids) are leached to the aquatic system resulting in river water that is low in pH and dark-brown in color. The point is that ""blackwater rivers"" tend to be rich in dissolved iron due to the unique chelating properties of humic and fulvic acids which bind Fe(III) and keep it in solution. We performed algal physiological (growth rate) experiments under conditions of iron deficiency with the marine unicellular phytoplankton algae Chlorella salina and Diacronema lutheri in 0.2 μm cut-off filtered mixtures of natural ""blackwater river"" water and synthetic seawater. Our results demonstrate that the iron naturally present in ""blackwater rivers"" is readily bioavailable to both marine algal species. Furthermore, the humic and fulvic acids exert an additional stimulatory effect on the marine algae. Both algae thrive much better in the presence of natural humic and fulvic acids as compared to a medium where EDTA is used as an iron-chelating agent. Our results indicate that ""blackwater rivers"", in sharp contrast to other types of rivers, are excellent sources of bioavailable iron to marine phytoplankton. This natural iron fertilization may give rise to photosynthesis-driven sequestration of CO2 from the atmosphere to the sea, as can be seen from the visualization of CO2 surface concentrations by NASA (NASA GEOS-5 model) which shows the global sources and sinks of CO2 localized in time and space. The results by NASA suggest that strong marine CO2 sinks in coastal waters tend to occur close to ""blackwater river"" estuaries. It is thus evident that ""blackwater rivers"" act as important sources of a limiting nutrient (iron) to the ocean.","Occurrence, distribution and ecological risks of antibiotics and pesticides in coastal waters around Liaodong Peninsula, China.",https://www.ncbi.nlm.nih.gov/pubmed/30625680,The Science of the total environment,2019 02 21,"Mariculture activities and river inputs can lead to pollution of micropollutants (e.g., antibiotics and pesticides) in coastal seawater which is the base of the most dynamic ecosystems due to its hosting some of the highest biodiversity and biological production in the world. It is thus of importance to investigate the occurrence and risks of organic micropollutants in coastal waters. In this study, 13 antibiotics and 15 pesticides were screened in coastal waters around the Liaodong Peninsula, China. Among the targets, thirteen were detected with concentrations up to 64.8 ng L-1. Simazine, atrazine and triadimenol were found to be the predominant pesticides with detection frequencies of 100%, and sulfamethoxazole was the predominant antibiotic with a detection frequency of 62.5%. The total level of the pollutants in the Bohai Sea was generally higher than that in the Yellow Sea, and a seaward decreasing trend of the pollutants was observed. Terrestrial inputs and mariculture were distinguished as main pollution sources by principal component analysis. Finally, ecological risk quotients were calculated and atrazine and acetochlor showed relatively higher risks to aquatic organisms.",Combined experimental and theoretical studies on adsorption mechanisms of gaseous mercury(II) by calcium-based sorbents: The effect of unsaturated oxygen sites.,https://www.ncbi.nlm.nih.gov/pubmed/30625679,The Science of the total environment,2019 01 31,"Accurate mercury speciation measurements are critical for developing methods for mercury removal from flue gas, but the lack of reliable adsorbents has made Hg2+ selective retention challenging. Calcium oxide (CaO) loaded on porous support is promising for HgCl2 selective adsorption because of its porosity and alkaline nature. The main hypothesis investigated in this paper is if the capacity of CaO sorbent for HgCl2 selective adsorption is attributed to its basic sites, then this will be drastically impacted by the calcium precursors. We synthesized a suite of CaO/SiO2 sorbents from different precursors, including hydrated calcium oxide (CaO-HS), calcium nitrate tetrahydrate (CaO-NS), and calcium acetate monohydrate (CaO-AcS), to investigate their performance on HgCl2 selective adsorption in a fixed-bed reactor. Compared with CaO-HS and CaO-NS, CaO-AcS was demonstrated to have the strongest affinity for HgCl2 and almost complete breakthrough for Hg0. Advanced porosity and surface basicity of CaO-AcS were confirmed by characterization analysis. CaO (001) and CaO (011) facet as well as surface defects that have different unsaturated O sites were observed using the high resolution transmission electron microscope (HRTEM). Combined theoretical and experimental methods were used to study the interaction mechanisms between HgCl2 and basic sites on CaO-AcS surfaces. Density functional theory (DFT) calculations indicated all CaO surfaces weakly interact with Hg0, while four robust bonding states of HgCl2 were predicted on different basic sites with the intensity in increasing order: Monodentate < Tridendate < Bidentate < Bridging. This was consistent with HgCl2-TPD experiments that demonstrated that the four HgCl2 adsorption configurations on CaO-AcS were attributed to different unsaturated O sites. The findings in this work highlight the application potential of CaO-AcS for gaseous Hg2+ sampling and measurement from coal-fired flue gas.","Isolation, identification and biodiversity of antiscalant degrading seawater bacteria using MALDI-TOF-MS and multivariate analysis.",https://www.ncbi.nlm.nih.gov/pubmed/30625677,The Science of the total environment,2019 02 21,"Seawater reverse osmosis (SWRO) is a commonly used desalination technique owing to its lesser environmental and economic impacts as compared to thermal desalination techniques. Antiscalants are used in SWRO to reduce membrane scaling caused by the supersaturation of salts present in feed water. However, to remain effective in reducing membrane scaling, antiscalants should be highly stable and resistant to biological degradation by seawater microorganisms. In this research, several bacteria from Qatar's seawater were isolated and screened for their ability to use antiscalants as a carbon and energy source. The biodiversity of antiscalant degrading seawater bacteria was demonstrated through combining the techniques of MALDI-TOF MS and principle component analysis. It was found that the bacteria isolated from Qatar's seawater such as H. aquamarina, H. elongata, P. fragi, P. stutzeri and others can degrade antiscalants and use them as a carbon and energy source. It was observed that the growth rates varied based on the type of antiscalant and the bacteria used. Among the tested strains, H. aquamarina, which is also known for its potential to cause biofouling, demonstrated the highest growth rates in antiscalants media. Thus, it was concluded that there is wide variety of bacteria in Qatar's seawater that can biodegrade the antiscalants; reducing their efficiency to combat membrane scaling. Since, these antiscalants will be used as a source of carbon and energy, microbial growth will increase resulting in enhanced membrane biofouling in SWRO.",Nutrients recovery from treated secondary mainstream in an urban wastewater treatment plant: A financial assessment case study.,https://www.ncbi.nlm.nih.gov/pubmed/30625676,The Science of the total environment,2019 01 31,"This study presents the financial assessment for implementing an ammonium and phosphate simultaneous recovery process based on the use of calcium activated synthetic zeolites in a large urban Waste Water Treatment Plant (WWTP) located in the Metropolitan Area of Barcelona. A calcium activated synthetic zeolites was selected, after a benchmarking analysis, as it reported capability for simultaneously recover ammonium and phosphate by a combined mechanism of ion exchange for ammonium and formation of insoluble mineral phase for phosphate. The loaded sorbent, rich in ammonium and phosphate, can be used as slow-release fertilizer. Financial indexes such as the net present value, the internal return rate, the return of investment and the payback period were calculated concluding that the integration of a zeolite-based sorption treatment stage in the main stream is economically feasible, with a reasonable payback period. The need, to achieve low-levels of P and N on the discharged waters and the need to develop more sustainable WWTP facilities indicate that the deployment of nutrient recovery solutions will be encouraged. The sensitivity analysis carried out to define the critical parameters of the economic performance of the technology allows concluding that the main variable in the viability of the nutrient recovery unit is related to the nutrients sorbent, both in the cost of purchase and in the market for the sorbent loaded with nutrients.",Spatiotemporal patterns and climatic drivers of severe dengue in Thailand.,https://www.ncbi.nlm.nih.gov/pubmed/30625675,The Science of the total environment,2019 02 21,"The burden of dengue fever in Thailand is considerable, yet there are few large-scale studies exploring the drivers of transmission.

The PAHs and AHs used as traditional anthropogenic markers showed a mixture between natural and anthropogenic sources, related mainly to inputs from higher plants, phytoplankton and both, biomass and petroleum combustion. Rural activities linked to agricultural pest control are the predominant source of pesticides, although minor inputs from pesticides used in urban public health campaigns and household activities were also detected. Synthetic hormones levels are two to three orders of magnitude greater than natural hormones levels and no correlations were observed between the main sewage markers and synthetic hormone concentrations, rural activities such as animal husbandry, which use drugs in management, may be the predominant anthropogenic sources of these compounds in the region. Traditional markers failed to detect ecological risks in rural areas, where synthetic substances (e.g. pesticides and hormones) are widely used and introduced in the environment."

However, the toxicological role of AA exposure in the cardiac development remains largely unknown. Here we showed the cardiotoxicity of AA and its role in cardiomyocyte interactions in zebrafish embryos during ventricular morphogenesis. Using the embryo model of transgenic zebrafish Tg(Tp1:d2GFP;myl7:mCherry), we found AA interfered the dynamics of Notch signaling in the endocardium during early cardiogenesis. Prolonged exposure to AA thickened the chamber wall and prevented the trabeculae from extending into the lumen of ventricular chamber. As a result, AA reduced the ventricular shortening fraction and spatial dimension via excessively activating the Notch signal in myocardium during cardiac maturation. Moreover, exposure to AA inhibited the re-distribution of N‑cadherin and failed to coordinate cardiomyocyte interactions between the myocardium layers due to the lack of delaminated cardiomyocytes. Therefore, AA-treated embryos exhibited subcellular pathological states including disarrayed myofibrils and abnormal morphology of mitochondria despite normal proliferation of cardiomyocytes. In addition, we found overexpression of some cardiac-specific transcription factors, such as hand2 and nkx2.5, in hearts of AA-treated embryos compared with those in control group. Our study provided the evidence that the period of ventricular chamber morphogenesis might be a vulnerable window in zebrafish, and revealed new insights into how AA might exert cardiac developmental toxicity.",Modeling multi-decadal mangrove leaf area index in response to drought along the semi-arid southern coasts of Iran.,https://www.ncbi.nlm.nih.gov/pubmed/30625661,The Science of the total environment,2019 02 21,"Leaf Area Index (LAI; as an indicator of the health) of the mangrove ecosystems on the northern coasts of the Persian Gulf and the Gulf of Oman was measured in the field and modeled in response to observed (1986-2017) and predicted (2018-2100) drought occurrences (quantified using the Standardized Precipitation Index [SPI]). The relationship of LAI with the normalized difference vegetation index (NDVI) obtained from satellite images was quantified, the LAI between 1986 and 2017 retrospectively estimated, and a relationship between LAI and SPI developed for the same period. Long-term climate data were used as input in the RCP8.5 climate change scenario to reconstruct recent and forecast future drought intensities. Both the NDVI and the SPI were strongly related with the LAI, indicating that realistic LAI values were derived from historic satellite data to portray annual changes of LAI in response to changes in SPI. Our findings show that projected future drought intensities modeled by the RCP8.5 scenario increase more and future LAIs decreased more on the coasts of the Gulf of Oman than the coasts of the Persian Gulf in the coming decades. The year 1998 was the most significant change-point for mean annual rainfall amounts and drought occurrences as well as for LAIs and at no time between 1998 and 2017 or between 2018 and 2100 are SPI and LAI values expected to return to pre-1998 values. LAI and SPI are projected to decline sharply around 2030, reach their lowest levels between 2040 and 2070, and increase and stabilize during the late decades of the 21st century at values similar to the present time. Overall, this study provides a comprehensive picture of the responses of mangroves to fluctuating future drought conditions, facilitating the development of management plans for these vulnerable habitats in the face of future climate change.",Modeling of radon exhalation from soil influenced by environmental parameters.,https://www.ncbi.nlm.nih.gov/pubmed/30625659,The Science of the total environment,2019 01 31,"Atmospheric radioactive noble gas radon (Rn-222) originates from soil gas exhaled in the atmospheric surface layer. Radon exhalation rates from soil as well as corresponding meteorological and soil parameters were recorded for two subsequent years. Based on long-term field data, a statistical regression model for the radon exhalation and the most important influencing parameters soil water content, temperature of soil and air, air pressure and autocorrelation of the exhalation rate was established. The fitting result showed that the multivariate model can explain up to 61% of the variation of the exhalation rate. First, the exhalation rate increases up to 80 Bq m-2 h-1 with increasing soil water content. Later, at water content >10%, increasing soil wetness suppressed the exhalation rate: at values higher than 24% to approximately one third. The air temperature had a distinct positive effect while the soil temperature had a strong negative effect on the exhalation rate, indicating their different influencing-mechanisms on the exhalation. The air pressure was negligible. The lagged values of radon exhalation had to be included in the model, as the variable shows strong autocorrelation.",Inventory and distribution of tritium in the oceans in 2016.,https://www.ncbi.nlm.nih.gov/pubmed/30625658,The Science of the total environment,2019 01 31,"Tritium concentrations in oceans were compiled from the literature, online databases and original measurements in order to determine the global distribution of tritium concentrations according to latitude and depth in all oceans. The total inventory of tritium decay corrected in 2016 has been estimated using evaluation of the natural and artificial contributions in 23 spatial subdivisions of the total ocean. It is determined equal to 26.8 ± 14 kg including 3.8 kg of cosmogenic tritium. That is in agreement with the total atmospheric input of tritium from nuclear bomb tests and the natural inventory at steady-state estimated from natural production rates in the literature (27.8-29.3 kg in the Earth). We confirm the global increase in tritium according to latitude observed in the Northern hemisphere since 1967 with a maximum in the Arctic Ocean. The minimum tritium concentrations observed in the Southern Ocean were close to steady-state with known natural tritium deposition. We focused on the temporal evolution of surface (0 to 500 m) tritium concentrations in a selected area of the North Atlantic Ocean (30°N-60°N) where we found the 2016 concentration to be 0.60 ± 0.10 TU (1σ). Results showed that in that area, between 1988 and 2013, tritium concentrations: i) decreased faster than the sole radioactive decay, due to a mixing with lower and lateral less concentrated waters, and ii) decreased towards an apparent steady state concentration. The half-time mixing rate of surface waters and the steady state concentration were respectively calculated to be 23 ± 5 years (1σ) and 0.38 ± 0.07 TU (1σ). This apparent steady-state concentration in the North Atlantic Ocean implies a mean tritium deposition of 1870 ± 345 Bq·m-2 (1σ), five folds higher than the known inputs (natural, nuclear tests fallout and industrial releases, ~367 Bq·m-2) in this area.","Food quality matters: Interplay among food quality, food quantity and temperature affecting life history traits of Aurelia aurita (Cnidaria: Scyphozoa) polyps.",https://www.ncbi.nlm.nih.gov/pubmed/30625657,The Science of the total environment,2019 02 21,"Understanding the interaction between organisms' life history traits and environmental factors is an essential task in ecology. In spite of the increasing appreciation of jellyfish as an important component in marine ecosystem, there are still considerable gaps in understanding how the phase transition from the benthic polyp to the pelagic medusa stage is influenced by multiple environmental factors, including nutrition. To investigate survival, growth, and phase transition of Aurelia aurita polyps, we designed a factorial experiment manipulating food quantity (20μg C, 5μg C and 1.5μg C polyp-1 every other day), food quality (Artemia salina and two dietary manipulated Acartia tonsa), and temperature (13°C, 20°C, and 27°C). Temperature was the key factor determining phase transition of polyps and negatively affecting their survival rate and growth at 27°C, which reflected a summer heatwave scenario. Furthermore, at polyps' optimum tolerance temperature (20°C) in our study, budding reproduction benefits from high food concentrations. Interestingly, polyps fed with food containing high level highly unsaturated fatty acid (HUFA) were able to compensate for physiological stress caused by the extreme temperature, and could enhance budding reproduction at optimum temperature. Moreover, benthic-pelagic coupling (strobilation) was determined by temperature but affected significantly by food conditions. Mild temperature together with optimum food conditions contributes to inducing more polyps, which may potentially bring about great ephyrae recruitments during overwintering. In contrast, heatwave events can potentially regulate plankton community structure accompanied by changes of nutritional conditions of primary and secondary producers and thus, negatively affect the population dynamics of polyps. We suggest a novel polyp tolerance curve, which can help to understand jellyfish population dynamics in different seasons and ecosystems. This sets up a baseline for understanding how anticipated global warming and food conditions may affect the population size of benthic polyps and consequently pelagic medusae.",Seasonal changes in carbonaceous aerosols over a tropical coastal location in response to meteorological processes.,https://www.ncbi.nlm.nih.gov/pubmed/30625656,The Science of the total environment,2019 01 31,"Near-surface atmospheric aerosols (PM10) collected from a tropical coastal location in south-west peninsular Indian region for a duration of 6 years (2012-18) (N = 461) were analysed for carbonaceous aerosol components, the less studied aerosol species. Organic carbon (OC), its water soluble-insoluble (WSOC and WIOC) components, primary-secondary (POC and SOC) fractions and elemental carbon (EC) were examined for understanding the annual, seasonal, day-night variations in abundance pattern along with associated physical and meteorological processes. Total carbonaceous aerosols accounting for 36% of the collected aerosol mass with 31.5% organic matter (OM) and 4.5% EC respectively, exhibited consistent seasonal pattern throughout the study period with high concentration during winter followed by post-monsoon, pre-monsoon and monsoon. Delineation of marine and continental components of carbonaceous species based on their relative dominance during different air-mass periods, shows that while marine aerosols were a combination of natural sources comprising of volatile, semi-volatile species and secondary organics (from marine VOC precursors); the continental aerosols were composed of anthropogenic combustion sources (fossil fuel, biomass emissions etc). Based on the measurements of OC and EC during 2005-09 and 2012-18, their long term trends (for more than a decade) were investigated. Although OC showed an increasing tendency, EC exhibited a decrease with the total carbonaceous aerosols exhibiting a gradual decreasing trend over the years, indicating that they do not strictly reverberate the reported increasing trend observed over north-central parts of India. This can be presumed to be due to the reduced anthropogenic inputs over the location owing to the control measures and policies. The strong convective activity and large scale monsoon phenomena also helps in the effective dispersion of pollutants. Making use of comprehensive measurement of carbonaceous aerosols and the previous measurements of other aerosol components, an improved chemical composition model is presented.",Fate of wastewater contaminants in rivers: Using conservative-tracer based transfer functions to assess reactive transport.,https://www.ncbi.nlm.nih.gov/pubmed/30625655,The Science of the total environment,2019 01 31,"Interpreting the fate of wastewater contaminants in streams is difficult because their inputs vary in time and several processes synchronously affect reactive transport. We present a method to disentangle the various influences by performing a conservative-tracer test while sampling a stream section at various locations for chemical analysis of micropollutants. By comparing the outflow concentrations of contaminants with the tracer signal convoluted by the inflow time series, we estimated reaction rate coefficients and calculated the contaminant removal along a river section. The method was tested at River Steinlach, Germany, where 38 contaminants were monitored. Comparing day-time and night-time experiments allowed distinguishing photo-dependent degradation from other elimination processes. While photo-dependent degradation showed to be highly efficient for the removal of metroprolol, bisoprolol, and venlafaxine, its impact on contaminant removal was on a similar scale to the photo-independent processes when averaged over 24 h. For a selection of compounds analyzed in the present study, bio- and photodegradation were higher than in previous field studies. In the Steinlach study, we observed extraordinarily effective removal processes that may be due to the higher proportion of treated wastewater, temperature, DOC and nitrate concentrations, but also a higher surface to volume ratio from low flow conditions that favorizes photodegradation through the shallow water column and a larger transient storage than observed in comparable studies.",Effects of 25 thyroid hormone disruptors on zebrafish embryos: A literature review of potential biomarkers.,https://www.ncbi.nlm.nih.gov/pubmed/30625654,The Science of the total environment,2019 02 21,"It is estimated that many organic compounds found in our environment can interfere with the thyroid system and act as thyroid hormone (TH) disruptor. Despite that, there is a clear lack of assays to identify TH disruptors. Recently zebrafish embryos were suggested as screening tool to identify compounds which impact thyroid synthesis. Effects on hormone level, gene transcript expression, eye development and swim bladder inflation are suggested as potential biomarker for TH disruptors. In order to assess the applicability of these biomarkers we performed a literature review. The effects of 25 known TH disrupting compounds were compared between studies. The studies were limited to exposures with embryos prior 7 days of development. The different study designs and the lack of standardized methods complicated the comparison of the results. The most common responses were morphological alterations and gene transcript expression changes, but no specific biomarker for TH disruption could be identified. In studies addressing TH disruption behavioral effects were more commonly monitored than in studies not mentioning the TH pathway. TH disruption in developing zebrafish embryos might be caused by different modes of action e.g. disruption of follicle development, binding of TH, activation of TH receptors causing different effects. Timing of developmental processes in combination with exposure duration might also play a role. On the other side compound characteristics (uptake, stability, metabolization) could also cause differences between substances. Further studies are necessary to gain better understanding into the mechanisms of TH disruption in early zebrafish development.",Water residence time (age) and flow path exert synchronous effects on annual characteristics of dissolved organic carbon in terrestrial runoff.,https://www.ncbi.nlm.nih.gov/pubmed/30625653,The Science of the total environment,2019 01 31,"Catchment hydro-physical controls on the interannual variability of dissolved organic carbon (DOC) in terrestrial watershed runoff, important for water quality, ecosystem structure, and foodweb dynamics, are not well understood. To address this, we simulated water residence time (""age"") and flow path of terrestrial runoff and analyzed their mediating effect on relationships between annual runoff volume, DOC concentration, and DOC age. We applied this analysis to a snow-influenced watershed in California's Sierra Nevada (USA) across a range of soil types, elevations (90-4210 m), and years (1950-1999). Simulated increases in annual runoff volume were accompanied by younger ages (r2 = 0.53-0.63) of DOC in quickflow, comprised of surface runoff and lateral flow through soil. Increases in annual runoff volume were also accompanied by gentler relationships between intra-annual (weekly) values of DOC concentration and runoff volume, regression-slopes of which followed a power-law relationship to annual runoff (r2 = 0.12-0.92) for approximately 70% of the watershed. Simulations including dynamics of water age and soil temperature produced annual ages of quickflow DOC ranging from 1 to 70 days over all soil types and water years. Similarity of this range to an observed, 1-69 day range in half-lives of relatively labile DOC in previous studies suggests substantial interannual and spatial variability in the biodegradability of DOC in terrestrial runoff. Simulations excluding dynamics of water age and soil temperature predicted order-of-magnitude less interannual variability in age of quickflow DOC, demonstrating the important effect of interannual variability in soil-water interaction times. These findings suggest that the distribution of DOC bioprocessing along transitions between terrestrial and aquatic systems may be strongly influenced by year-to-year variability in age of water.",Groundwater diffuse pollution in functional urban areas: The need to define anthropogenic diffuse pollution background levels.,https://www.ncbi.nlm.nih.gov/pubmed/30625652,The Science of the total environment,2019 01 31,"Groundwater status in highly urbanized areas is particularly affected by anthropogenic influence due to diffuse pollution deriving from many sources. This makes very often challenging to determine whether the observed groundwater conditions are the result of localized pollutant sources (PS-Point Sources). In the EU legislative framework it is accepted that, when Natural Background Levels (NBLs) of undesirable elements are proven to be higher than specific Groundwater Quality Standards (GQSs), NBLs should be assumed as GQSs. No procedure is instead defined when anthropogenic Diffuse Pollution Background levels (DBPLs) are higher than GQSs and make unfeasible any remediation strategy. Among the many contaminants affecting groundwater, the chlorinated solvents, tetrachloroethylene (PCE), trichloroethylene (TCE) and trichloromethane (TCM) among the organics and hexavalent chromium, among the inorganics, having been widely used in several industries all over Europe, are very often the most prevalent contaminants in soil and groundwater. Aim of this paper is to discuss a multivariate statistical approach to address the issue of identification of anthropogenic Diffuse Pollution Background Levels. With such aim, an area of about 1600 km2, including the Functional Urban Area of Milan, was considered and 10 independent geochemical datasets, provided by local and regional agencies, and covering the period 2003-2014 were merged into a single database after homogenization and multiple quality checks. A total of 618,258 chemical analyses from 3477 sampling wells were considered, being all samples collected and analyzed through internally consistent protocols. The analysis enabled to identify five main clusters, having specific hydrogeological characteristics, different temporal profiles and pollutant background concentration levels, which were also found to respond differently to meteo-climatic changes. This study offers a robust knowledge basis for drafting a diffuse pollution management plan of the area."

In this work we hypothesized that P. edulis has adaptive responses to oxidative stress that enable it to tolerate ozone damage based on its capacity to grow under a diversity of environmental conditions and to dominate disturbed areas. We exposed seedlings to three levels of ozone in a Free-Air Controlled Exposure (FACE) system (22, 41 and 58 ppb h AOT40 and 13.52, 17.24 and 20.62 mmol m-2 POD0, over 97 days) for identifying its tolerance mechanisms. Anatomical (leaf blade structure and fluorescence emission of chloroplast metabolites), physiological (leaf gas exchange, growth rate and biomass production) and biochemical (pigments, total sugars, starch, enzymatic and non-enzymatic antioxidant metabolites, reactive oxygen species and lipid peroxidation derivatives) responses were assessed. Ozone caused decreased total number of leaves, hyperplasia and hypertrophy of the mesophyll cells, and accelerated leaf senescence. However, O3 did not affect carbohydrates content, net photosynthetic rate, or total biomass production, indicating that the carboxylation efficiency and associated physiological processes were not affected. In addition, P. edulis showed higher leaf contents of ascorbic acid, glutathione (as well high ratio between their reduced and total forms), carotenoids, and flavonoids located in the chloroplast outer envelope membrane. Our results indicate that P. edulis is an O3-tolerant species due to morphological acclimation responses and an effective antioxidant defense system represented by non-enzymatic antioxidants, which maintained the cellular redox balance under ozone.",New insights into the effect of thermal treatment on sludge dewaterability.,https://www.ncbi.nlm.nih.gov/pubmed/30625640,The Science of the total environment,2019 02 21,"The changes of the sludge dewaterability in different thermal treatments and the factors influencing these changes were examined in this study. The experimental results showed that the sludge dewaterability deteriorated by the thermal pretreatment with temperature range from 20 to 170 °C, but the deterioration decreased above a certain temperature threshold (120-150 °C). The factors which affected the dewaterability of thermal-treated sludge in two temperature ranges (20-105 °C and 105-170 °C) were different. The dewaterability of thermal-treated sludge was influenced by the protein, humic acid, and polysaccharide contents of different extracellular polymeric substance fractions and the molecular distribution and fluorescence intensity of tightly bound extracellular polymeric substance in the range from 20 to 105 °C. From 105 to 170 °C, while, the thermal-treated sludge dewaterability was influenced mainly by the α-helix of protein in soluble extracellular polymeric substance. These experimental results provide a new insight into the effect of thermal treatment on sludge dewaterability, which will help guide subsequent research.","Recent patterns of anthropogenic reactive nitrogen emissions with urbanization in China: Dynamics, major problems, and potential solutions.",https://www.ncbi.nlm.nih.gov/pubmed/30625639,The Science of the total environment,2019 01 31,"Anthropogenic emissions of reactive nitrogen (Nr) result in adverse impacts on the ecosystems. Nowhere has that threat been more challenging than in rapidly urbanized China, the world's largest anthropogenic Nr producer. The Nanjing Declaration in 2004 called for global reductions in Nr emissions. To assess China's progress, multisource Nr emissions were evaluated with a quantitative method from 2004 to 2014. The results showed that national Nr emissions had increased with fluctuation over this period, 55-59% of the total Nr emissions were emitted to the atmosphere, and that agricultural production still was the biggest contributor (62-69%). The hotspots were mainly located in the developed and coastal regions that also have high population densities. Urbanization was associated with overall decreases in agricultural Nr emission and increases in industrial and residential Nr emissions. The overall increase in residential Nr emission per capita played a large role in driving the growth of national Nr emission. Continuing urbanization poses a significant challenge to future Nr mitigation for ecosystem sustainability and a range of strategies, covering improvement of N-use efficiency, slowdown of Western China's urbanization, and promotion of low N intensive lifestyle, are proposed that can promote Chinese low-nitrogen development.",A comparison of trichloromethane formation from two algae species during two pre-oxidation-coagulation-chlorination processes.,https://www.ncbi.nlm.nih.gov/pubmed/30625638,The Science of the total environment,2019 02 21,"Microcystis aeruginosa (M. aeruginosa) commonly blooms in summer while Cyclotella meneghiniana (C. meneghiniana) outbreaks in fall in water reservoirs of Southeast China. Pre-oxidation has been demonstrated to enhance the algae removal from chemical coagulation processes. However, excessive dosage of pre-oxidant can increase the disinfection by-products formation potential (DBPsFP). Additionally, the DBPs formation mechanisms from algae during the pre-oxidation-coagulation-chlorination processes have not well elucidated. In this study, the objectives were to investigate the trichloromethane (TCM) formation, the changes of water quality indexes, and the morphology changes of algal cells from M. aeruginosa or C. meneghiniana contaminated water during potassium permanganate (KMnO4) or chlorine (Cl2) pre-oxidation-coagulation-chlorination disinfection. The results showed that the TCM yield for two algal species decreased with the dosage increase of KMnO4 pre-oxidation, but increased with the dosage increase of pre-chlorination. Therefore, the 2.0 mg/L KMnO4 or 0.5 mg/L Cl2 was proposed as the optimal dosage for preventing both M. aeruginosa blooms in summer and for C. meneghiniana outbreaks in fall. M. aeruginosa exhibited a slightly higher TCM yield than C. meneghiniana in these treatment processes. Based on the release of potassium (K) ion and SEM analysis, KMnO4 had less damage on cell integrity than Cl2 at the dosage ≤2.0 mg/L. In addition, C. meneghiniana was easier to be disrupted by both pre-oxidants than M. aeruginosa, combining with subsequent coagulation led to different value of dissolved organic carbon (DOC), UV-visible absorbance (UV254) and turbidity.",A novel approach to evaluate the lung cancer risk of airborne particles emitted in a city.,https://www.ncbi.nlm.nih.gov/pubmed/30625635,The Science of the total environment,2019 02 21,"Air quality still represents a main threat to human health in cities. Even in developed countries, decades of air pollution control not yet allowed to reduce pollutant concentrations in urban areas adequately. Indeed, high airborne particle concentrations are measured in several European cities; this is a main issue since particles represent a carrier for carcinogenic compounds. Numerous researches measuring the exposure to the different aerosol metrics in urban areas were recently performed, nonetheless, few data on the lung cancer risk in such environments are available. In the present paper a novel approach to evaluate the lung cancer risk related to the airborne particles emitted by the different sources located in a city is proposed and applied to a pilot case-study (i.e. an Italian city). In particular, an existing lung cancer risk model was modified and applied to assess the particle-related lung cancer ""emitted"" by the different sources of the city using pollutant emission factors provided by accredited emission inventory databases. Therefore, the average toxicity of the particles emitted by the city (i.e. lung cancer slope factor) and the lung cancer risk globally emitted by the city, expressed as new cases of lung cancer, were evaluated. The proposed emission inventory also allowed to identify and localize the main contributors to the overall risk emitted in a city. As an example, for the city under investigation, the research revealed that the main contributor, amongst the sources considered, is the vehicular traffic which is characterized by a lower mass fraction of carcinogenic compounds but a much higher sub-micron particle emission with respect to the other sources.",PestLCI 2.0 sensitivity to soil variations for the evaluation of pesticide distribution in Life Cycle Assessment studies.,https://www.ncbi.nlm.nih.gov/pubmed/30625634,The Science of the total environment,2019 01 31,"Pesticides are commonly applied in conventional agricultural systems, but they can lead to serious environmental contamination. The calculation of on-field pesticide emissions in Life Cycle Assessment (LCA) studies is challenging, because of the difficulty in the calculation of the fate of pesticides and, therefore, several literature approaches based on different dispersion models have been developed. PestLCI 2.0 model can provide simultaneous assessment of the emission fractions of a pesticide to air, surface water and groundwater based on many parameters. The goal of this study is to exploit the extent of PestLCI 2.0 sensitivity to soil variations, with the ultimate goal of increasing the robustness of the modelling of pesticide emissions in LCA studies. The model was applied to maize cultivation in an experimental farm in Northern Italy, considering three tests, which evaluated the distribution of pesticides among environmental compartments obtained considering different soil types. Results show that small variations in soil characteristics lead to great variation of PestLCI 2.0, with a significance that depends on the type of environmental compartment. The compartment most affected by soil variations was groundwater, whereas surface waters were dominated by meteorological conditions, pesticides' physical and chemical properties and wind drift, which are independent from soil characteristics. Therefore, the use of specific soil data in PestLCI 2.0 results in the availability of a comprehensive set of emission data in the different compartments, which represents a relevant input for the inventory phase of LCA studies and can increase their robustness. Nevertheless, PestLCI 2.0 requires a great effort for the data collection and a specific expertise in soil science for interpreting the results. Moreover, characterization factors for pesticide groundwater emissions should be developed, in order to exploit these detailed results in the impact assessment phase, Finally, the study provides further insights into future improvement of PestLCI 2.0.",Novel photocatalytic system Fe-complex/TiO2 for efficient degradation of phenol and norfloxacin in water.,https://www.ncbi.nlm.nih.gov/pubmed/30625633,The Science of the total environment,2019 02 21,"Photocatalysis is one of the effective strategies to eliminate various organic pollutants in water body. In this paper we have prepared a series of new composite photocatalysts to degrade phenol and norfloxacin under visible light irradiation. They were [FeII(dpbpy)2(H2O)2]/TiO2, [FeII(dpbpy)(phen)2]/TiO2 and [FeII(dpbpy)(bpy)2]/TiO2 (dpbpy: 2,2'-bipyridine-4,4'-diphosphoric acid, phen: 1,10-phenanthroline, bpy: 2,2-bipyridyl). The results show that their photocatalytic performance and cyclic stability are much better than that of pure TiO2 or P25. Phenol can be degraded almost completely and the active groups or substituents of norfloxacin (NOR) can be destroyed also, which greatly reduced the biological toxicity of phenol and norfloxacin in water. The possible mechanisms of improving the photocatalytic activity and stability of TiO2 by using Fe-complex are proposed based on free radical capture test and density functional theory calculation. It is clearly that the interfacial interaction between Fe-complex and titanium dioxide directly affects the photocatalytic activity and stability of the composite photocatalyst. The conjugated structure of the complexes plays a crucial role.",Naked eye detection of an amplified gene using metal particle-based DNA transport within functionalized porous interfaces.,https://www.ncbi.nlm.nih.gov/pubmed/30625632,Talanta,2019 02 21,"The current study focuses on developing a system for visually detecting an amplified bacterial (Escherichia coli O157:H7) gene using a heavy metal particle (MP) and functionalized porous sepharose gel. To functionalize DNA-specificity to the MP, an avidin-modified MP was employed in combination with a biotin-conjugated primer. The porous sepharose matrix was functionalized with an amine-reactive group, such as N-hydroxysuccinimide (NHS), to achieve separation upon binding of the amplified gene. The pristine avidin-MPs strongly react with NHS-sepharose via imide bonds owing to the exposure of the amine group on the avidin-MP surface. Conversely, together with the amplified gene, the avidin-MPs are relatively less interactive toward the sepharose gel by steric hindrance of the amplified gene toward the imide bond between NHS and the amine groups. Owing to the higher molecular mass of the MP, those metal particles complexed with the amplified gene pass through the sepharose matrix when centrifugal force is applied. The MPs that are thus separated can be easily visualized by the naked eye owing to their inherent reddish-brown color. A polymerase chain reaction (PCR) product of E. coli O157:H7, present in concentrations ranging from 1.0 × 101 to 1.0 × 106 colony forming units (CFU), in actual food sample was evaluated with high sensitivity and reproducibility.

According to WHO even 10% of counterfeit medicines can be exact copies of genuine medicines: they have exactly the same quantitative and qualitative composition in terms of both API and excipients. Thus, the identification of such drugs using chemical analysis methods can be very difficult or even impossible. The aim of this study was to verify the effectiveness of using computed microtomography in the identification of counterfeit medicines. The General Electric v|tome|x s microtomography system was used in the study. The recorded microtomographic scans were subjected to analysis and image processing. The following parameters of image analysis and processing were identified: mean brightness, homogeneity, contrast, quadratic tree decomposition. The original and falsified 100-mg Viagra® tablets (Pfizer) were compared. 8 original Viagra® tablets (hereinafter referred to as T) and 8 falsified tablets (hereinafter referred to as F1-F8) were tested. The range of variation for the genuine medicines against fake products was: brightness: 90.9-117.1 vs 33.8, 50.1, homogeneity: 0.84-0.92 vs 0.94-1.01 and quadratic tree decomposition for the 1 × 1 mask: 55768-58792 vs 0-439. The proposed method of microtomographic image analysis and processing enables to identify solid dosage forms, including those that are an accurate chemical copy, with high sensitivity and specificity, 94.5% and 97%, respectively. The advantage of the μCT method is its high efficiency and speed, whereas the disadvantages include the possibility of using only solid dosage forms and high equipment costs.",In-line monitoring of Ibuprofen during and after tablet compression using near-infrared spectroscopy.,https://www.ncbi.nlm.nih.gov/pubmed/30625630,Talanta,2019 02 21,"Near infrared spectroscopy (NIRS) used as process analytical technology tool to monitor Active Pharmaceutical Ingredient concentrations during tablet manufacturing has been reported to enhance overall product quality assurance. NIRS applications in different manufacturing stages are facilitated by their ability to handle different sample presentations - be it solids, liquids, gels or powders. The present study evaluates NIRS suitability for monitoring Ibuprofen concentrations (coated pellets form) inside the feed frame of a tableting press as well as in output tablets. Process monitoring was undertaken with quantitative chemometric analysis. NIRS-based predictions of concentrations both inside the feed frame and in tablets were compared to ultraviolet (UV) spectroscopy assays of temporally stratified tablet samples. Process dynamics were also compared in terms of concurrent concentrations change kinetics in the feed frame and in output tablets. NIRS showed good sensitivity to Ibuprofen concentrations despite the use of coated pellets. Ibuprofen contents as low as 1.7% w/w were detected effectively. NIRS-based quantitative predictions in the feed frame and in tablets closely matched the UV assay values of sampled tablets. As anticipated from the 2-wheel feed frame geometry, upon the addition of each consecutive blend, results show that the predicted concentration inside the feed frame were delayed compared with that of the tablets exiting the tablet press. For these tests, the delay was estimated to be 1.25 min. This finding highlights the importance of NIRS probe position inside the feed frame as a function of its geometry. Successive feed frame and tablet monitoring by NIRS could prove beneficial for real time release testing of tablet formulations."

The gadget is based on a simple magnetic disk that permits the stir bar to be placed at the top of the sample vial. The complete surface of the coated stir bar is exposed to the headspace atmosphere, and the movement of the bar caused by the magnetic stirrer in the liquid sample facilitates the sorption process. The final consequence is increased sensitivity and repeatability when compared with a glass-made comercial device for the same purpose.

In this proposed method, a magnetic effervescent tablet, containing CO2 sources, ionic liquids and Fe3S4 magnetic nanoparticles (MNPs), combines extractant dispersion and magnetic recovery into one-step. Fe3S4 was synthesized, characterized and applied it for the first time to the newly developed method, and its extraction recoveries (ERs) for PBDEs were 20.8-32.0% higher than those of conventional Fe3O4 MNPs. The increased ERs of Fe3S4 resulted from its larger specific surface area and pore size. Some important parameters were rigorously optimized, such as kinds of magnetic nanoparticles, effervescent agents, extraction solvents and their volumes, elution solvents, extraction temperature and salt addition. Under the optimized conditions, the META-IL-DLLME method combined with HPLC-DAD analysis gave the linear ranges of 0.1-0.5-100 µg L-1 with correlation coefficients of > 0.9990. The ERs ranged from 80.7% to 99.3%, and the limits of detection and quantitation were 0.012-0.078 µg L-1 and 0.04-0.26 µg L-1, respectively. The intra- and inter-day precisions, expressed as relative standard deviations (RSD, n = 6), were 1.32-4.83% and 1.99-4.25%, respectively. To evaluate its matrix effect, the relative recoveries of PBDEs from tap and river water, skim and whole milk, pregnant women and women serum samples at three fortification levels (2.0, 5.0 and 20.0 µg L-1) were in the range of 77.3-106.7%. Overall, the commercial Fe3O4 MNPs can only be used for magnetic separation in microextraction procedures, while Fe3S4 MNPs gave the higher adsorption and extraction efficiency for organic analytes besides the convenient magnetic separation. Therefore, the results obtained in this study provide a superior alternative for the conventional magnetic separation and adsorbent material. Also, this newly developed method has a great potential in routine monitoring of liquid matrix samples.",Spectrophotometric determination of manganese in acidified matrices from (pore)waters and from sequential leaching of sediments.,https://www.ncbi.nlm.nih.gov/pubmed/30625617,Talanta,2019 02 15,"Manganese (Mn) is a major redox reactive element in marine sediments and it plays an important role in the biogeochemical cycles of carbon, nitrogen, phosphorus, or trace metals. Mn cycle in marine sediments is characterized by an alternation of oxidation and reduction processes depending on physicochemical and biological conditions: assessing the quantification and the speciation of Mn is thus an essential issue to understand redox reaction-transport processes in sedimentary deposits. Solid Mn phases can be determined through chemical extractions techniques that permits selective leaching of operationally defined Mn fractions. Mn oxides and oxyhydroxides are extracted with an ascorbate leaching solution, while the whole Mn (oxyhydr-)oxides and Mn associated to carbonates is extracted with HCl. An existing spectrophotometric method allows to quantify Mn dissolved in (sea) water. We present here a modified version, which permits to measure Mn in acidified matrices, including ascorbate and HCl solutions. A metallic substitution occurs between a Cd-TCPP complex and Mn at pH 7.5-8.0, with imidazole as catalyst. We propose here to use a NaHCO3 solution to dilute the samples in order to be in the necessary pH range to perform the metal substitution. Using this method, Mn(II,III) concentrations were determined in standard solutions with a precision of 3% within a concentration range of 0.5-80 μM. The procedure was successfully applied to determine Mn in acidified pore waters and in ascorbate and HCl sequential extractions from muddy sediments of the Bay of Biscay. Spectrophotometric results agreed closely with results from atomic absorption spectrometry, validating the proposed method.",Development of a selective chloride sensing platform using a screen-printed platinum electrode.,https://www.ncbi.nlm.nih.gov/pubmed/30625616,Talanta,2019 02 15,"A new and selective voltammetric method for chloride determination is proposed, based on platinum and chloride interactions. A screen-printed platinum electrode (SPPtE) functions as a sensing platform, which promotes the formation of chloro-adsorbed species on the electrode surface, acting as an effective means of anion-determination in several matrices. The pretreatment of the SPPtE and careful control of the cathodic stripping voltammetric parameters yielded a well-defined electrochemical signal. This cathodic peak was due to the adsorption of chlorine, which had previously been oxidized from chloride anions in the initial anodic deposition step. It offers a simple, low-cost, fast, reproducible (RSD < 6%) and precise method for selective chloride determination, with limit of detection of 0.76 mM, and a sensitivity of - 24.147 µA mM -1 for a broad determination range of up to 150 mM.

However, to date most assays are based on the targeted investigation of a limited number of steroid hormones, thus preventing in-depth mechanistic interpretation with respect to steroidogenesis. In that context, analytical strategies coupling liquid chromatography and high-resolution mass spectrometry (LC-HRMS) have been reported as promising methods for an extended monitoring of steroid metabolites. However, unwanted sources of variability occurring during the acquisition process, including batch effects, may prevent relevant biochemical information to be properly highlighted. Dedicated data mining strategies are therefore needed to overcome these limitations, and extract relevant extended steroidomic profiles. The present study combines an untargeted LC-HRMS acquisition strategy with automated steroid metabolite annotation based on accurate mass and isotopic patterns, and a chemometric tool allowing the different sources of variability to be decomposed based on experimental design. This workflow was applied to the extended monitoring of steroidogenic dysregulations due to endocrine disrupting chemicals (EDCs) exposure in H295R cell cultures. A series of six chemicals, including acetyl tributylcitrate, octyl methoxycinnamate, torcetrapib, forskolin, linuron, and octocrylene, and dimethylsulfoxide as solvent control, were investigated through the simultaneous monitoring of 130 potential steroid metabolites, repeating the whole experiment independently three times. A stratified subsampling strategy was carried out to remove efficiently systematic batch variations and highlight subgroups of chemicals with similar steroid patterns. The proposed approach was reported as a potent screening strategy, as it allowed specific alterations of the steroid hormone biosynthesis and metabolism related to distinct mechanisms of action to be distinguished.",Paper-based immunocapture for targeted protein analysis.,https://www.ncbi.nlm.nih.gov/pubmed/30625614,Talanta,2019 03 20,"A novel sampling concept for mass spectrometric bottom-up targeted protein analysis is here demonstrated with polymeric sampling spots integrated with instant immunocapture for analysis of dried matrix spots.

From performance characterization, the pHEMA-VDM had the best performance. The sampling spots demonstrated fast and easy sampling and preparation of human serum spiked with the biomarker human chorionic gonadotropin. The sampling spots enabled a detection limit of 1 ng/mL (26.4 pM) within a five point concentration curve from 1 ng/mL to 20 ng/mL (R2 = 0.97). The detection limit was demonstrated to be two times lower than previously demonstrated with standard DMPK-C sampling cards.

A test, named alarm-LFIA, has an essentially new function that consists in notice (signaling the danger) about the presence at least one target from the controlled list without identification. The design of the alarm-LFIA assumes one test zone, which contains a mixture of antibodies, and multi-specific conjugate that binds the several targets. The alarm test is based on the novel conjugate with broaden specificity due to the immobilisation of a mix of antibodies, specific to several structurally different targets, on the surface of gold nanoparticles. For proof of concept, multi-specific conjugate to five important potato viruses (potato virus X, -M, -S, -Y and potato leaf roll virus) was fabricated using five antibodies with different specificity. The alarm-LFIA was developed for rapid detection of the total infection caused by up to five viruses. Detection limits of the viruses in potato leaf extracts are from 10 to 30 ng/mL. The alarm-LFIA was successfully used for viruses' detection in potato leaves; results were confirmed by enzyme-linked immunosorbent assay. The proposed approach of alarm-LFIA shows great potential for the various cases when different targets of interest can occur simultaneously or separately in samples."

The rise in NGAL concentration, both in urine or plasma, appears earlier than for other classical renal function markers such as serum creatinine, thus making it a suitable marker for early pathology detection. The aim of this study was to develop a method involving tryptic digestion, solid phase extraction and LC-MS/MS analysis to analyze NGAL in plasma medium using an isotope labeled surrogate protein, containing NGAL signature tags, as internal standard (QPrEST). The method was validated for the analysis of NGAL in an analytical range from 50 to 1250 ng/mL using two different proteotypic peptides. The method was further used to quantify the NGAL in human plasma samples for whom elevated NGAL values were expected. NGAL values were between 190.8 and 242.6 ng/mL for control group and between 228.1 and 3526.2 ng/mL for patient group. This study proved that the selection of the right internal standard is of utmost importance in targeted proteomics studies as the digestion steps might cause high variability. This study also confirmed that, although NGAL is highly resistant to proteases such as trypsin, the method could be fully validated according to FDA guidelines and subsequently used to assess NGAL levels in patient plasma with high analytical confidence.",Qualitative and quantitative analysis of counterfeit fluconazole capsules: A non-invasive approach using NIR spectroscopy and chemometrics.,https://www.ncbi.nlm.nih.gov/pubmed/30625598,Talanta,2019 02 15,"The ultimate goal of the study is to present a method of authentication of hard-shell capsules of medicines packed in polyvinylchloride (PVC) blisters without damaging the primary packaging.

Firstly, this is done by visual inspection of spectra of the sample, its interfering layers and main pharmaceutical ingredients. Secondly, three regression models for quantification of active pharmaceutical ingredient (API) are built. The possibility of calibration and prediction of API through several nuisance layers using NIR spectroscopy is demonstrated.

It is necessary to develop confidential method for specific and sensitive 3-NT detection. In this paper, on the basis of anti-3-NT specific antibody, we developed a label-free indirect competitive surface plasmon resonance (SPR) immunosensor and ELISA for the detection of 3-NT.

Different solvent systems have been used for the extraction of multiple lipid classes from CSF but no comparative study of the effectiveness of these protocols has been carried out. To optimize CSF lipid extraction for lipidomic measurements by untargeted ultra-high performance liquid chromatography - mass spectrometry, we evaluate and compare two sample preparation protocols, one involving protein precipitation with isopropanol (IPA) and other consisting of a liquid-liquid extraction with chloroform-methanol. For that purpose, human CSF from neurologically healthy and normolipidemic volunteers was used. The criteria established to compare these two methods were based on four critical aspects of sample preparation: simplicity, lipid coverage, reproducibility and recovery efficiencies. We found that both methods were highly reproducible techniques (>75% of the lipids with coefficient of variation (CV) <30%). In terms of recovery, the single-step IPA procedure yielded better values for most of the lipid classes and it was less toxic and simpler than the liquid-liquid extraction method. In relation to lipid coverage, variation in selectivity was observed between methods, providing evidence that IPA was more selective for polar lipids. Overall, IPA precipitation provides excellent results in terms of simplicity of execution, lipid coverage, reproducibility and recovery.

Current research gaps include risks of instrumental matrix effects due to the complexity of post-oxidation extracts, potential reproducibility issues during TOP itself, and limited information for zwitterionic and cationic pre-PFAAs. We first investigated a suitable method for the analysis of groundwater samples, using liquid chromatography high-resolution mass spectrometry (UHPLC-HRMS). Initial sample pre-treatment through filtration could affect the dissolved PFAS concentrations and was therefore avoided. Amending the postoxidation samples with methanol allowed for improved precision and low instrumental matrix effects. We also documented the oxidation yields of 23 anionic, neutral, zwitterionic, and cationic precursor compounds of PFAAs. These precursor compounds were amenable to TOP conversion. The total oxidative yield of 6:2 fluorotelomer sulfonamidoalkyl betaine (6:2 FTAB), for instance, was 80 mol%, with C3-C5 PFCAs as major oxidation products (minor: C6-C7 PFCAs). The method was applied to determine a wide range of PFAS (n = 41) without oxidation as well as ΔPFCA via persulfate oxidation in AFFF-impacted groundwater samples from fire-equipment testing sites in Ontario and Newfoundland, Canada. Summed PFAS concentrations as high as 5 mg L-1 were reported before oxidation, and post-oxidation increases of PFCAs up to + 2300% were observed. A significant contribution of increases in individual PFCAs was attributed to precursors such as 6:2 FTAB, fluorotelomer sulfonates (6:2 FtS, 8:2 FtS), perfluorooctane sulfonamidoalkyl amine (PFOSAm), and perfluorohexane sulfonamide (FHxSA) at the active firefighting training site.",Design of a redox-active surface for ultrasensitive redox capacitive aptasensing of aflatoxin M1 in milk.,https://www.ncbi.nlm.nih.gov/pubmed/30625578,Talanta,2019 03 20,"Herein, we report the design of a novel label-free aptasensor based on ferrocene and silicon nanoparticles (SiNPs) for ultrasensitive detection of aflatoxin M1 (AFM1) in milk. Given that silicon nanomaterials stand out by their high capacitive power, we used them to develop a novel capacitive transduction system based on electrochemical capacitance spectroscopy (ECS). This strategy relies on the changes of the redox capacitance signal owed to the surface-tethered ferrocene film, by performing electrochemical impedance spectroscopy (EIS) measurements without using an external redox probe. The redox capacitance variation was found to correlate well with the increasing concentrations of AFM1 in the linear range from 10 to 500 fmol⋅L-1 with a sensitivity of 0.46 μF*fM-1*cm - 2. Furthermore, the aptasensor allowed to reach very low limits of detection and quantification equal to 4.53 fM and 14.95 fM, respectively.

The fabrication of Au@AgNAs involved using spherical Au nanocrystals of 32 nm in diameter as the seeds, and ascorbic acid was used as the reductant. The thickness of the Ag shell deposited onto the Au surface was finely tuned from 3 to 13 nm by changing the amount of AgNO3 precursor.

Pb2+ ions were bound to 8-17DNAzyme to break the cleavage substrate. The limit of detection (LOD) of Hg2+ is 0.1 nmol L-1 and Pb2+ is 1.0 nmol L-1, which is far below the limit of 10.0 ppb (31 nmol L-1) and 10.0 ppm (3.02 × 104 nmol L-1) for drinking water stipulated by the World Health Organization.

Five suspect samples of Plavix® were investigated, and their XRF spectra were studied using chemometrics (Principal Component Analysis and Soft Independent Modelling of Class Analogies). A classification model was validated with positive and negative samples, and four suspect samples were identified as being falsified, whilst the fifth was concluded as an authentic medicine. ED-XRF spectroscopy was also applied on another medicine, a food supplement and three cosmetic samples, and high level of zinc was detected in the second sample and mercury was identified in the last.

An ingenious test of ascorbic acid (AA) and sodium nitrite (NaNO2) was carried out based on the dual properties of Eu-SiMoW in solutions. First, the redox reaction of Eu-SiMoW and AA generated the blue reduced Eu-SiMoW, accompanied by fluorescence quenching; then the redox reaction of the reduced Eu-SiMoW and NaNO2 made Eu-SiMoW back to its original pale yellow state with red luminescence. Accordingly, the content of AA and NaNO2 could be measured by the reversible change of color and luminescence of Eu-SiMoW. This bi-directional detection method is first discovered and proven to be a simple and effective method for the detection of AA and NaNO2.

Deflagration of black powder results in residues the chemical analysis of which presents limitations and has been performed with several techniques until today; nevertheless, Gas Chromatography-Mass Spectrometry (GC-MS) has never been used. In this study, a simple experimental protocol has been developed towards black powder residues identification, using GC-MS. The sample preparation does not require specialized equipment. Derivatization of thiocyanates coming from BP deflagration and identification of the relative derivative (PBF-SCN) was achieved by monitoring ions m/z 239, 181 and 161. This characteristic derivative was used as a marker to indicate BP usage. The protocol was optimized by investigating individually all experimental parameters and it was evaluated for false positives and negatives. Repeatability and limit of detection were calculated to be %RSD 7.67 and < 1 mg, respectively. No interference coming from other ingredients that might co-exist in BP residues was observed. This protocol may be applied directly and without previous preparation to evidence coming from cases of explosions, thus practically contributing in BP residues identification."

Herein, we reported an ultrasensitive homogeneous aptasensor based on fluorescence resonance energy transfer (FRET) between upconversion nanoparticles (UCNPs) and graphene oxide (GO) for CEA detection. The CEA aptamer modified UCNPs can bind to the surface of GO through π-π stacking interaction, resulting in fluorescence quenching due to the energy transfer from UCNPs to GO. After the introduction of CEA, the CEA aptamer preferentially combined with CEA to form three-dimensional structure which made UCNPs-aptamer dissociate from the GO, blocking the energy transfer process. The fluorescence of UCNPs was accordingly restored in a CEA concentration-dependent manner both aqueous solution and human serum samples. The aptasensor could monitor CEA level directly in human serum and the results were strongly correlated with commercial chemiluminescence kits.

Herein, we have proposed a sensitive UDG assay based on the terminal deoxynucleotidyl transferase (TdT)-assisted formation of fluorescent copper nanoclusters (CuNCs). In this study, a uracil-containing stem-loop DNA substrate is rationally designed with its 3'-end blocked with 2', 3'-dideoxycytosine (ddC). UDG can remove the uracil in the DNA substrate to generate an apurinic/apyrimidinic (AP) site, which can then be specifically cleaved by endonuclease IV (Endo IV) to expose a 3'-OH terminus. TdT will initiate the template-free DNA extension along the exposed 3'-OH terminus to produce a quite long poly(T) tail, which will perfectly template the production of fluorescent CuNCs. By recording the fluorescence of the CuNCs, the UDG activity can be faithfully detected. In contrast, if UDG is absent, the 3'-ddC terminus of the DNA substrate cannot be recognized by TdT and thus no TdT-based extension and formation of CuNCs will occur. The use of ddC as a 3'-end blocker can greatly decrease the nonspecific DNA extension and improve the signal-to-noise ratio. Furthermore, TdT is a template-free and sequence-independent DNA polymerase, which can effectively catalyze the tailing process up to a maximum of thousands of thymines, and each tail can form many fluorescent CuNCs. Therefore, an ultrahigh sensitivity is achieved and as low as 0.00005 U/mL of UDG can be clearly detected. Moreover, with an additional AP site-contained poly(A) oligonucleotide during TdT-mediated extension, a branched amplification mechanism is also preliminarily devised, which can further push the detection limit of UDG to an extremely low level of 0.000002 U/mL.",Detection of Salmonella from chicken rinsate with visible/near-infrared hyperspectral microscope imaging compared against RT-PCR.,https://www.ncbi.nlm.nih.gov/pubmed/30625548,Talanta,2019 02 21,"Salmonella is an organism of importance to the poultry industry with increasingly stringent government regulatory standards. Real-time polymerase chain reaction (RT-PCR) and plating procedures on nutrient enriched growth media have been the standard detection methods of Salmonella from broiler chicken carcasses for years. These methods are proven, but offer disadvantages in the amount of time or reoccurring sample cost. Here, we propose the use of a hyperspectral microscope imaging system (HMI) for comparison to standard detection methods. Broiler chicken carcasses were rinsed and plated on Salmonella selective agar. Colonies from plates were picked and RT-PCR was used as a confirmation test to verify plating results, while HMI was collected from the same colonies. Spectral signatures of cells were extracted between 450 and 800 nm from HMI collected with 100x objective. A quadratic discriminant analysis (QDA) was used to classify cells as either Salmonella positive or negative (n = 341).

Efficient extractions have been found when using a pancreatin/lipase mixture at pH 7.4 and 37 °C for 12 h under continuous stirring. The proposed sample pre-treatment procedure has been found not to change TiO2 NPs size distribution, therefore guaranteeing TiO2 NPs integrity. TiO2 NPs determination (TiO2 NPs concentration) and TiO2 NPs characterization (size distribution) were assessed by single-particle inductively coupled plasma mass spectrometry (sp-ICP-MS) working with dwell times in the microsecond range (high frequency of data acquisition). Method validation was performed for TiO2 NPs concentrations and TiO2 NPs sizes. Good repeatability (25% and 8% for TiO2 NPs concentration and TiO2 NPs most frequent size), and sensitivity (limit of detection of 5.28 × 105 NPs g-1for TiO2 NPs concentrations, and 31.3-37.1 nm for TiO2 NPs size) were obtained. Accuracy, calculated through analytical recovery was adequate. Recoveries for TiO2 NPs standards of 50 and 100 nm were 108 ± 5 and 105 ± 4%, respectively. The proposed methodology was applied to several surimi samples for assessing TiO2 NPs concentrations and size distribution. Some surimi samples were found to contain TiO2 NPs (concentrations from 1.40 × 107 to 1.19 × 109 NPs g-1). TiO2 NPs size distributions were very different among the samples, and some of them showed wide size ranges (the most frequent size varied from 53.8 to 62.1 nm; whereas, the mean size values were within the 73.4-217.5 nm range).",A novel spot test based on digital images for determination of methanol in biodiesel.,https://www.ncbi.nlm.nih.gov/pubmed/30625536,Talanta,2019 02 15,"Methanol is used in transesterification reaction for biodiesel production, being an important quality parameter to evaluate the purity of the final product. Methanol concentrations higher than 0.20% (m/m) reduce the biofuel efficiency. The Brazilian, United States, and European standards recommend the reference method based on gas chromatography with flame ionization detection, which involves a time-consuming procedure and requires high-cost equipment. In this work, it is proposed a simple and low cost spot test based on digital images acquired with a smartphone camera for the determination of methanol in biodiesel. The procedure was based on the oxidation of methanol to formaldehyde and subsequent reaction with Schiff reagent, resulting in a violet product. Analytical signals were based on the reflected radiation measured on the G channel (RGB system), which refers to the complementary color of the reaction product. Linear responses were obtained within 20-500 mg kg-1 and 500-2000 mg kg-1 methanol for 600 and 150 µL of sample aqueous extracts, respectively. The coefficient of variation (n = 10) and the limit of detection (99.7% confidence level) were estimated as 4.8% and 10 mg kg-1 (600 µL of sample), respectively. The procedure requires only 75 µg of potassium permanganate, 6 mg of oxalic acid, and 1.5 mg of p-rosaniline and generates ca. 1.2 mL of residue per determination. The results agreed with those obtained by the reference procedure at the 95% confidence level, demonstrating that the proposed method is an alternative for routine analysis of the biofuel.",A simple strategy to improve the sensitivity of probe molecules on SERS substrates.,https://www.ncbi.nlm.nih.gov/pubmed/30625535,Talanta,2019 02 15,"In this work, we report a simple strategy to improve the detection sensitivity as well as the spectral quality of probe molecules on surface-enhanced Raman scattering (SERS) substrates. On normal SERS substrates, due to the decreased absorption capacity and changes in the molecule orientations, SERS signals disappear when the analyte molecule concentrations reach a limit value. To solve this problem, the molecular template reagent (MTR) technique, a simple strategy based on SERS surface selection rules, is considered. By choosing the best MTR according to different samples, the effect of adjusting the molecular orientations of samples can be studied. In this process, 1-butanethiol, 1-hexanethiol, 1-octanethiol, 1-decanethiol, and 1-dodecanethiol, which are MTRs, are used to adjust the orientations of probe molecules under optimized conditions. The use of the MTR technique indicated that the limit of detection (LOD) of the probe molecules of p-aminobenzenethiol and 4-mercaptobenzoic acid on noble metal substrates showed an increase of one order of magnitude over the LOD of the pure probing molecule systems. Hence, the proposed method introduces a way to detect the molecules with an improved sensitivity at extremely low concentrations. The study corresponds to a proof-of-concept study of MTR-assisted SERS for SERS-based applications in ultrasensitive analyses.",MALDI-ToF mass spectrometry detection of intramolecular composition gradient in copolymers.,https://www.ncbi.nlm.nih.gov/pubmed/30625534,Talanta,2019 02 15,"Since their addition to the polymer-architecture portfolio, gradient copolymers have attracted significant attention. Up to now, however, the existence of the intramolecular composition gradient must have been ascertained by sampling during living copolymerization because a reliable method for the detection of the composition gradient in the finalized copolymer had not been established yet. Here we show that MALDI-ToF mass spectrometry not only identifies imperfect, i.e. prematurely terminated copolymers but these copolymers can be used as ""time capsules"" which provide information on composition evolution and the intramolecular composition gradient.",Essential oils in nanostructured systems: Challenges in preparation and analytical methods.,https://www.ncbi.nlm.nih.gov/pubmed/30625533,Talanta,2019 02 15,"Essential oils are natural products extracted from plants that present volatile and thermolabile characteristics. Essential oils have become products of interest in many fields, including the pharmaceutical, due to their medicinal properties. In recent years, the interest in the encapsulation of essential oils in nanometric systems for therapeutic approaches has risen and a number of studies have been published. This review intended to set a panorama on the research within this field through a data survey and identify the organic nanostructured systems, the preparation techniques and analytical quantification methods employed. Many techniques used to prepare nanosystems loaded with essential oils involve heating or solvent evaporation steps that may damage their composition. In this context, the quantification of essential oil on the final nanosystems is impaired. However, in more than half of the research papers, the quantification is ignored or an indirect quantification is performed, assuming no volatilisation upon formulation processes. Analytical methods used to assess essential oil encapsulation efficiency were discussed regarding their suitability.","Single microbead-based fluorescence ""turn on"" detection of biothiols by flow cytometry.",https://www.ncbi.nlm.nih.gov/pubmed/30625532,Talanta,2019 02 21,"Biological thiols (biothiols), such as glutathione (GSH), cysteine (Cys) and homocysteine (Hcy), play a vital role in the process of reversible redox reactions in physiological systems. In this work, flow cytometry-based fluorescent sensor is for the first time developed for the detection of biothiols in a fluorescence ""turn on"" manner. The probe which we name ""Polystyrene/Quantum Dots/Gold Nanoparticles"" or (PS/QDs/Au) is constructed by immobilizing QDs onto the surface of PS microbeads to obtain fluorescent microbeads. The probe (PS/QDs/Au) is constructed by immobilizing QDs onto the surface of PS microbeads to obtain fluorescent microbeads, followed by gold NPs absorption through electrostatic interaction to quench their fluorescence. In the presence of biothiols, the fluorescence of our probe can be restored in less than 5 min, and the detection limits for GSH, Cys and Hcy are 0.5 μM, 0.1 μM and 0.3 μM, respectively. Most importantly, the fluorescence signal of each of our probe microbeads can be collected individually by flow cytometry, realizing single microbead-based biothiols detection for the first time. Moreover, the probe is successfully applied to imaging of intracellular biothiols in A549 cells, demonstrating its potential in biological application.",Rapid and mild fabrication of protein membrane coated capillary based on supramolecular assemble for chiral separation in capillary electrochromatography.,https://www.ncbi.nlm.nih.gov/pubmed/30625531,Talanta,2019 02 21,"Exploration of the simple and stable coating methods is of great significance in capillary electrochromatography (CEC). In this work, a lysozyme assemble supramolecular membrane coated capillary column was developed for CEC chiral separation. Taking advantage of phase transformation of lysozyme, the coating process was achieved within 1.0 h thus to a large extent reduced the capillary preparation time and simplified the coating procedure. The successful fabrication of the supramolecular membrane coated capillary was verified by scanning electron microscopy (SEM), Fourier transform-infrared spectroscopy (FT-IR), fluorescence imaging, and electroosmotic flow (EOF). The separation capacity of the coated capillary was evaluated by analysis of different chiral analytes, including chiral amine drug and neurotransmitters, and good enantioseparation efficiency was achieved for the three pairs of enantiomers. For three consecutive runs, the relative standard deviations (RSD) for the migration time of the analytes for intra-day (n = 3), inter-day (n = 3) and column-to-column (n = 3) were in the range of 0.7-1.5%, 2.7-3.6%, and 4.5-5.8%, respectively.

The aim of this research is to exploit the complementary information obtained by means of EE and ET sensing systems using different data fusion strategies, in order to develop an integrated device able to quickly and easily quantify the physico-chemical parameters that are used to assess phenolic ripeness. To this purpose, both low-level and mid-level data fusion approaches were investigated. Partial Least Squares (PLS) regression was applied to the fused data, with the aim of relating the information brought by the two sensors with twelve physico-chemical parameters measured on the must samples by standard analytical methods. The results achieved with mid-level data fusion outperformed those obtained using EE and ET separately, and highlighted that both the artificial sensors have made a significant contribution to the prediction of each one of the considered physico-chemical parameters.",Speciation analysis of chromium by carboxylic group functionalized mesoporous silica with inductively coupled plasma mass spectrometry.,https://www.ncbi.nlm.nih.gov/pubmed/30625529,Talanta,2019 02 15,"Carboxyl-group functionalized mesoporous silica (CFMS) prepared by one-pot co-condensation method was employed for the solid phase extraction (SPE) of chromium species for the first time. A new approach of SPE coupled to inductively coupled plasma mass spectrometry (ICP-MS) was thus established for the speciation of chromium in environmental water samples. The influences of pH, volume of sample, extraction time, amount of adsorbent, elution conditions, co-existing ions and adsorption capacity were investigated on adsorption or elution of chromium species. Cr(VI) was not retained on the CFMS material in the pH range of 1.0-9.0, while Cr(III) was quantitatively adsorbed at pH 5.0-9.0. The captured Cr(III) was enriched by using 1.5 mol L-1 HNO3 as elution solvent and detected by ICP-MS. Under the optimized SPE conditions, the maximum adsorption capacity of the CFMS for Cr(III) was 57.67 mg g-1 and the enrichment factor was 25, with the detection limit (LOD) of 0.02 μg L-1. The proposed protocol has been successfully applied to chromium speciation in rain, lake and river water samples, which exhibited a prospect in field separation and enrichment of chromium species in environmental waters.",Rapid characterization of structure-dependency gas-phase ion/ion reaction via accumulative tandem MS.,https://www.ncbi.nlm.nih.gov/pubmed/30625528,Talanta,2019 02 15,"To enable the rapid detection of biomolecule reactivity and reaction sites, we developed a method based on gas-phase ion/ion reaction and accumulative tandem mass spectrometry (MS). Structure-dependency reactions in gas-phase were performed between biomolecule ions and their reaction partner ions with opposite polarities in a quadrupole ion trap. Gas-phase peptide bioconjugation with pyridoxal-5-phosphate (PLP) was chosen as a proof-of-principle example. It is found that the Coulomb attraction force holds reaction partners close together, which increasing the reaction probability. Post reaction, reaction sites were identified by the consequent accumulative tandem MS method, in which informative product ions in low abundance were enriched by more than 100 times in another quadrupole ion trap. With enough product ions, tandem MS was performed, and reaction sites could be identified unambiguously. Since those reactions are normally biomolecular structure dependent, density functional theory (DFT) calculations were also carried out to understand the reaction mechanism. The method allows for rapid characterization of structure dependent reactivity of a biomolecule, and opens a new avenue for drug development and biomolecule structure analyses."

Methods: Dental plaque and unstimulated saliva samples were taken from 30 subjects aged 3-5 years old, half with (n=15, dmft > 4) and half without (n=15) ECC. The abundance of C. albicans and S. mutans and relative to total bacteria load were quantify by real-time PCR (qPCR). This method was also employed to investigate the mRNA expression of glycosyltransferase ( gtfB) gene in dental plaque. Student's t-test and Pearson's correlation were used to perform statistical analysis. Results: Within the ECC group, the quantity of both microorganisms were higher in the saliva than in dental plaque. The ratio of C. albicans to total bacteria was higher in saliva than in plaque samples (p < 0.05). We observed the opposite for S. mutans (p < 0.05). The different value of C. albicans and S. mutans in saliva was positively correlated, and negatively correlated in dental plaque. Transcription level of S. mutans gtfB showed a positive correlation with C. albicans concentration in dental plaque.  Conclusion:C. albicans has a positive correlation with cariogenic traits of S. mutans in ECC-related biofilm of young children.",Association between intensity of STI screening and development of antimicrobial resistance in N. gonorrhoeae in 12 cities in the USA: An ecological study.,https://www.ncbi.nlm.nih.gov/pubmed/30443344,F1000Research,2019 05 21,"In this study, we assessed if there was a city-level association between sexually transmitted infection (STI) screening intensity in men who have sex with men and antimicrobial sensitivity in Neisseria gonorrhoeae in the United States, 2007 to 2013.  We found positive associations between STI screening intensity and increases in minimum inhibitory concentrations for certain antimicrobials. Not all positive associations were statistically significant and the associations found to be statistically significant varied between the different analyses.

Homologous recombination is a DNA repair process that often breaks down as a prelude to developing cancer. Conversely, homologous recombination can be the Achilles' heel in common anti-cancer therapies, which are effective by inducing irreparable DNA damage. Here, we review recent structural and functional studies of RAD51, the protein that catalyzes the defining step of homologous recombination: homology recognition and DNA strand exchange. Specific mutations can be linked to structural changes and known essential functions. Additional RAD51 interactions and functions may be revealed. The identification of viable mutations in this essential protein may help define the range of activity and interactions needed. All of this information provides opportunities to fine-tune existing therapies based on homologous recombination status, guide diagnosis, and hopefully develop new clinical tools.",Using zebrafish to study the function of nephronophthisis and related ciliopathy genes.,https://www.ncbi.nlm.nih.gov/pubmed/30254740,F1000Research,2019 05 21,"Zebrafish are a valuable vertebrate model in which to study development and characterize genes involved in cystic kidney disease.

Up until now, little was known about its distribution in relation to the native Aedes aegypti and how the invasion will modify the epidemiology of arboviral diseases. Here, we assessed the current distribution of Ae. albopictus and Ae. aegypti in the Republic of the Congo and explored the genetic diversity of the invading species, Ae. albopictus. Methods: Immature stages of Aedes were collected in nine locations in the Republic of the Congo in 2017 following a north-south transect and reared to adult stage. Adults were morphologically identified, counted and grouped according to species and location. Genetic diversity of Ae. albopictus was assessed by analyzing the cytochrome oxidase I ( COI) gene. Results:Ae.albopictus and Ae. aegypti were found together across the country in all the locations investigated. The invasive species is predominant over the native species in all locations except Brazzaville, suggesting that Ae. albopictus is displacing Ae. aegypti across Congo. When comparing the species distributions across the two largest cities, Brazzaville and Pointe Noire, Ae. albopictus was more prevalent than Ae. aegypti in the suburbs whereas the opposite situation was reported in the city centre. Mitochondrial DNA analysis revealed very low genetic diversity of Ae. albopictus with only three haplotypes recorded across the country supporting the recent introduction of this species in the Republic of the Congo. Phylogenetic tree analysis revealed that Ae. albopictus from Congo originated from other tropical Asian countries such as China, likely as a result of increasing trade links. Conclusion: These findings are important for the implementation of vector control strategies and can serve as a foundation for further research on these vectors in the country.",The challenges of designing a benchmark strategy for bioinformatics pipelines in the identification of antimicrobial resistance determinants using next generation sequencing technologies.,https://www.ncbi.nlm.nih.gov/pubmed/30026930,F1000Research,2019 04 01,"Next-Generation Sequencing (NGS) technologies are expected to play a crucial role in the surveillance of infectious diseases, with their unprecedented capabilities for the characterisation of genetic information underlying the virulence and antimicrobial resistance (AMR) properties of microorganisms.  In the implementation of any novel technology for regulatory purposes, important considerations such as harmonisation, validation and quality assurance need to be addressed.  NGS technologies pose unique challenges in these regards, in part due to their reliance on bioinformatics for the processing and proper interpretation of the data produced.  Well-designed benchmark resources are thus needed to evaluate, validate and ensure continued quality control over the bioinformatics component of the process.  This concept was explored as part of a workshop on ""Next-generation sequencing technologies and antimicrobial resistance"" held October 4-5 2017.   Challenges involved in the development of such a benchmark resource, with a specific focus on identifying the molecular determinants of AMR, were identified.

Originally developed in an industrial process control setting, the CUSUM statistic is typically reset to zero once a process is discovered to be out of control since the industrial process is then recalibrated to be in control. The CUSUM method is also used to detect disease outbreaks in prospective disease surveillance, with a disease outbreak coinciding with an out-of-control process. In a disease surveillance setting, resetting the CUSUM statistic is unrealistic, and a nonrestarting CUSUM chart is used instead. In practice, the nonrestarting CUSUM provides more information but suffers from a high false alarm rate following the end of an outbreak. In this paper, we propose a modified hypothesis test for use with the nonrestarting CUSUM when testing whether a process is out of control. By simulating statistics conditional on the presence of an out-of-control process in recent time periods, we are able to retain the CUSUM's power to detect an out-of-control process while controlling the post-out-of-control false alarm rate at the desired level. We demonstrate this method using data on a Salmonella Newport outbreak that occurred in Germany in 2011. We find that in 7 out of 8 states where the outbreak was detected, the outbreak was detected at the same speed as an unmodified nonrestarting CUSUM while controlling the postoutbreak rate of false alarms at the desired level.",Society for Maternal-Fetal Medicine's Fellow Research Series 2018: Manuscripts of the Year.,https://www.ncbi.nlm.nih.gov/pubmed/30625510,American journal of perinatology,2019 01 09,,Microvascular Thrombosis and Ischaemic Limb Losses in Critically Ill Patients.,https://www.ncbi.nlm.nih.gov/pubmed/30625509,Hamostaseologie,2019 02 18,"Relatively little scientific attention has been given to the small subset of critically ill patients with circulatory shock who develop ischaemic limb losses (symmetrical peripheral gangrene [SPG]). The clinical picture consists of acral (distal extremity) tissue necrosis involving lower limbs in a largely symmetrical fashion and with detectable arterial pulses; in one-third of patients the upper extremities are also affected (potential for four-limb amputations). The laboratory picture includes thrombocytopenia, coagulopathy, and normoblastemia (circulating nucleated red blood cells). The explanation for limb losses is microvascular thrombosis caused by disseminated intravascular coagulation usually secondary to cardiogenic or septic shock. A common myth is that vasopressors cause the ischaemic limb injury. However, the more likely explanation is failure of the natural anticoagulant systems (protein C and antithrombin) to downregulate thrombin generation in the microvasculature. This is because more than 90% of patients with SPG have preceding 'shock liver', which occurs 2 to 5 days (median, 3 days) prior to ischaemic limb injury, with impaired hepatic production of protein C and antithrombin."

Colonic diverticular bleeding can result in hemorrhagic shock requiring blood transfusion, and it carries a high risk of recurrence within 1 year. Colonic diverticulitis can cause abscess, fistula formation, and perforation of the colon that may require surgery, and it often recurs. As a result, patients with colonic diverticular disease are often bothered by required frequent examinations, re-hospitalization, and a consequent decrease in quality of life. However, the management of diverticular disease differs between Japan and Western countries. For example, computed tomography (CT) is readily accessible at Japanese hospitals, so urgent CT may be selected as the first diagnostic procedure for suspected diverticular disease. Endoscopic clipping or band ligation may be preferred as the first endoscopic procedure for diverticular bleeding. Administration of antibiotics and complete bowel rest may be considered as first-line therapy for colonic diverticulitis. In addition, diverticula occur mainly in the sigmoid colon in Western countries, whereas the right side or bilateral of the colon is more commonly involved in Japan. As such, diverticular disease in the right-side colon is more prevalent in Japan than in Western countries. Against this background, concern is growing about the management of colonic diverticular disease in Japan and there is currently no practice guideline available. To address this situation, the Japanese Gastroenterological Association decided to create a clinical guideline for colonic diverticular bleeding and colonic diverticulitis in collaboration with the Japanese Society of Gastroenterology, Japan Gastroenterological Endoscopy Society, and Japanese Society of Interventional Radiology. The steps taken to establish this guideline involved incorporating the concept of the GRADE system for rating clinical guidelines, developing clinical questions (CQs), accumulating evidence through a literature search and review, and developing the Statement and Explanation sections. This guideline includes 2CQs for colonic diverticulosis, 24 CQs for colonic diverticular bleeding, and 17 CQs for diverticulitis.",Rapidly and Slowly Growing Lineages in Chromosomal Instability-Type Gland-Forming Gastric Carcinomas as Revealed by Multisampling Analysis of DNA Copy-Number Profile.,https://www.ncbi.nlm.nih.gov/pubmed/30625481,"Pathobiology : journal of immunopathology, molecular and cellular biology",2019 06 06,"To examine whether gastric carcinoma (GC) with chromosomal instability (CIN-type GC), the largest category in the Cancer Genome Atlas classification, consists of a single genetic lineage, we conducted a multisampling analysis of genomic DNA copy-number profile.",Ensuring Basic Competence in Thoracentesis.,https://www.ncbi.nlm.nih.gov/pubmed/30625480,Respiration; international review of thoracic diseases,2019 05 26,Trocar pigtail catheter thoracentesis (TPCT) is a common procedure often performed by junior physicians.

To achieve 3D information during treatment, patient-specific motion models can be considered the most viable solution. However, conventional global motion models are built using a single motion surrogate, independently from the anatomical location. In this work, we present a novel motion model based on regions of interest (ROIs) established on 4D computed tomography (4DCT) and 2D cine-MRI, aiming at accurately compensating for changes during treatment. In the planning phase, a motion model is built on a 4DCT dataset, through 3D deformable image registration (DIR). ROIs are then defined and correlated with motion fields derived by 2D DIR between CT slices centered in the tumor. In the treatment phase, the model is applied to in-room cine-MRI data to compensate for organ motion in a multi-modal framework, aiming at estimating a time-resolved 3DCT. The method is validated on a digital phantom and tested on two lung patients. Analysis is performed by considering different anatomical planes (coronal, sagittal and a combination of the two) and evaluating the performance of the method on tumor and diaphragm. For the phantom study, the ROI-based model results in a uniform median error on both diaphragm and tumor below 1.5 mm. For what concerns patients, median errors on both diaphragm and tumor are around 2 mm (maximum patient resolution), confirming the capability of the method to regionally compensate for motion. A novel ROI-based motion model is proposed as an integral part of an envisioned clinical MRI-guided workflow aiming at enhanced image guidance compared to conventional strategies.",Characterization of nanowire light-emitting diodes grown by selective-area metal-organic vapor-phase epitaxy.,https://www.ncbi.nlm.nih.gov/pubmed/30625458,Nanotechnology,2019 02 15,"We report a systematic study on the current injection and radiative carrier recombination in InP nanowire (NW) light-emitting diodes (LEDs). The InP NWs with axial p-n structures, grown by selective-area metal organic vapor-phase epitaxy, had mixed crystal structures between those of zincblende and wurtzite, mainly in the p-regions. The temperature dependence of the current-voltage (I-V), electroluminescence (EL), and current-light output (I-L) characteristics was investigated. The temperature dependence of the I-V characteristics revealed that tunneling was the main mechanism of carrier transport through the p-n junction in the present NW-LEDs. The temperature and bias voltage dependences of EL showed a complex but systematic behavior, where peaks exhibiting bias-dependent and independent energy positions coexisted and the relative intensity showed a transition with increasing temperature. The external quantum efficiency showed a droop at low temperatures, indicating a reduced injection efficiency at low temperatures. These observations were explained by the radiative and nonradiative tunneling, and suggested a strong effect of the nonradiative tunneling at low temperatures.",Programmable higher-order biofabrication of self-locking microencapsulation.,https://www.ncbi.nlm.nih.gov/pubmed/30625457,Biofabrication,2019 05 08,"Three-dimensional (3D) hydrogel microcapsules offer great potential in a wide variety of biomedical and tissue engineering applications for their promising biodegradability and customizable geometry. Although recent advances in microfluidics and electrospray techniques have achieved high-throughput production of droplet microcapsules, they are still faced with the intractable challenge of obtaining programmable shape-engineered microcapsules with complex spatial architecture. Herein, a programmable light-induced biofabrication strategy is proposed to construct higher-order microcapsule architectures by developing a microencapsulation microchip. Such a method not only enables one to prepare various 2D Ca-alginate hydrogel sheets with well-tailored shapes and sizes, but also forms 3D perfectly matched microcapsule components by taking advantage of shrinkage and swelling phenomena. The proposed biofabrication method overcomes the drawback of conventional monotonous microencapsulation and allows us to fabricate sophisticated microcapsules with higher-order and biomimicking joints, such as a self-locking architecture. It can provide wide applications in biomedicine and would offer many unprecedented possibilities of artificial tissue engineering.",Role of electron-magnon interaction in non-Fermi liquid behavior of SrRuO3.,https://www.ncbi.nlm.nih.gov/pubmed/30625456,Journal of physics.

In this study, magnetic, transport (electrical and thermal) properties and x-ray photoemission spectra have been used to understand the role of quasiparticle interactions in the SrRuO3 bulk system. At the Fermi level, the hybridization of Ru4dt 2g   ↓  and O2p  bands form a typical two band system. In order to explain the problems as mentioned, our present work reveals that there must be an impurity band that couples with the bands around Fermi level and serves as a charge reservoir. In the present case, the impurity is attributed to the Ru vacancies. As a result, the conduction electrons scatter strongly with the Ru vacancies and couple with the Ru magnons to give rise to a dominant electron-magnon coupling that overwhelms the electron-phonon coupling in the temperature range of 90-150 K."

However, multilayer Ti3C2T x material could only deliver a moderate capacity in sodium ion battery cells, below the requirement of commercial applications. Herein, we decorated multilayer MXene (Ti3C2T x ) with Sb nanoparticles (NPs) via a facile solution-phase method, in which Sb NPs with a diameter of about 5-10 nm are absorbed on the surface of MXene layers by the electrostatic attraction action. The hybrid material Ti3C2T x @Sb-0.5 delivers a higher reversible capacity of 200 mA h g-1 at 0.1 A g-1 than that of pure Ti3C2T x (90 mA h g-1), and shows a much better capacity retention of nearly 98% after 500 cycles compared with Sb NPs. Also, it achieves superior rate performance (remaining a capacity of 127 mA h g-1 at 2 A g-1) and excellent long-term stability (a capacity retention of almost 92.3% after 8000 cycles). These results indicate that Ti3C2T x @Sb-0.5 possess a potential for high-performance sodium ion batteries anodes.",Passive acoustic mapping of extravasation following ultrasound-enhanced drug delivery.,https://www.ncbi.nlm.nih.gov/pubmed/30625444,Physics in medicine and biology,2019 02 06,"The amount and distribution of chemotherapeutic agents delivered to tumours can vary significantly due to tumour heterogeneity, even under focussed ultrasound (FUS) assisted drug delivery regimes. The ability to non-invasively localise cavitation nuclei of a similar size to therapeutic drugs, both within the vasculature and tumour tissue, may provide a useful marker of ultrasound-enhanced drug delivery and extravasation. Solid polymer based nanoscale cavitation nuclei, under FUS excitation, have previously been shown to extravasate into tissue-mimicking phantoms, and to increase drug delivery in murine tumour models in vivo. Here we show in a tissue-mimicking material that these nuclei, once extravasated under FUS excitation, are still acoustically active and can be non-invasively localised using passive acoustic mapping (PAM). By using a high resolution dual linear array setup in conjunction with adaptive beamformers, we demonstrate that the average 'maximum distance' of a PAM pixel to an extravasated particle across experiments is [Formula: see text] mm. Although the primary objective of the paper is to show that extravascular cavitation can be used as evidence of successful drug extravasation in a tissue-mimicking phantom, we also recognise the physical and computational limitations of using a high resolution dual array setup with adaptive beamformers. Thus as a secondary objective, we evaluate tradeoffs between adaptive and non-adaptive beamformers, as well as between dual and single array geometries. When compared to a conventional beamformer, adaptive beamformers reduce the maximum distance of PAM pixels to extravasated particles from an average of [Formula: see text] mm to [Formula: see text] mm in the single array case. The distance is further reduced to [Formula: see text] mm using the dual array configuration, thereby demonstrating that increasing the solid angle spanned by the PAM array aperture significantly improves drug delivery localisation. Future work will test the applicability of PAM-based monitoring of ultrasound-enhanced drug delivery in vivo.","Nontrivial topology of bulk HgSe from the study of cyclotron effective mass, electron mobility and phase shift of Shubnikov-de Haas oscillations.",https://www.ncbi.nlm.nih.gov/pubmed/30625443,Journal of physics.

Condensed matter : an Institute of Physics journal,2019 01 28,"Solvated electrons are known to be the lowest energy charge transfer pathways at oxide/aqueous interface and the understanding of the electron transfer dynamics at the interface is fundamental for photochemical and photocatalytic processes. Taking anatase TiO2/H2O interface as a prototypical system, we perform time-dependent ab initio nonadiabatic molecular dynamics calculations to study the charge transfer dynamics of solvated electrons. For the static electronic properties, we find that the dangling H atoms can stabilize solvated electrons. A solvated electron band can be formed with one monolayer H2O adsorption. The energies of the solvated electron band minimum (SEBM) decrease when H2O adsorbs dissociatively. Moreover, the surface oxygen vacancies are also helpful for stabilizing the solvated electron band. For the dynamics behaviour, we find that the ultrafast charge transfer from SEBM to anatase TiO2 (1 0 1) surface at 100 K is mainly contributed by nonadiabatic mechanism. Comparing with rutile TiO2 (1 1 0) surface, the lifetime of solvated electron on anatase TiO2 (1 0 1) surface is longer, suggesting a better photocatalytic properties.

Using exact diagonalization, we have calculated the conductivity and related quantities for cyclic ladders of up to 13 rungs. In agreement with results of an early study by Hayward and coworkers (Hayward et al 1996 Phys. Rev. B 53 8863) we find that [Formula: see text] consists of a Drude peak at zero frequency and an absorption band in the infrared region that is separated from the former by a pseudogap. The width of the pseudogap [Formula: see text] increases with increasing J/t, in parallel with an increase of the magnitude [Formula: see text] of the gap in the quasiparticle excitation spectra. Our central finding is that [Formula: see text], where [Formula: see text] is the magnitude of the gap in the spin excitation spectra. We demonstrate that this approximate relation can be understood in terms of a phenomenological model involving a superconducting ladder and a coupling between charged quasiparticles and spin excitations.

Alternatively, the bias-induced circular current can also be determined from the magnetic response of the ring junction to an external flux in the zero-flux limit. This leads to determination of bias-induced circular current without actually calculating the bond currents.

Condensed matter : an Institute of Physics journal,2019 01 23,"Hidden order may arise in strongly correlated systems even if there is an apparent lack of long-range order as measured by local order parameters. This phenomenon has been essentially associated with topological order in quantum systems. Here, we demonstrate the emergence of hidden order in a 1D non-linear classical mechanical system that supports rotational degrees of freedom. The potential energy of the model system creates a bistable system for which hidden order emerges with the introduction of a biquadratic term. To our surprise, we discover that varying the strength of the biquadratic term leads to four distinct phases quantified by the behaviors of the Néel and string order parameters. Three of these phases are locally disordered. Hidden order is identified by a string order parameter that shows correlations with significantly longer range than the Néel order parameter. The hidden order correlation length diverges as the kinetic energy of the system is lowered with a critical exponent ~0.5. The observation of hidden order in a mechanical system reveals that instability and non-linearity may play critical roles in the generation of nonlocal long-range correlations in apparently locally disordered systems.",Three-dimensional structure of antiphase domains in GaP on Si(0 0 1).,https://www.ncbi.nlm.nih.gov/pubmed/30625435,Journal of physics.

In this work, we first investigate the interface between GaP and Si itself by cross-sectional scanning tunneling microscopy (XSTM) to reveal possible intermixing within an 8 monolayers wide region. Furthermore, we present an extensive analysis combining transmission electron microscopy and XSTM to elucidate the shape of antiphase domains in GaP. To create a true-to-scale, three-dimensional model of an antiphase domain, firstly, plan-view transmission electron microscopy images are drawn on. Subsequently, the progression of many antiphase boundaries through the GaP crystal as viewed from the (1 1 0) and (1 [Formula: see text] 0) cleavage planes is analyzed all the way down to the atomic level by means of XSTM.

Such a valley mixing effect with a strong scattering strength has been found observable and studied thoroughly in this paper by using a Bloch-wave expansion approach and a projected [Formula: see text] effective Hamiltonian including interlayer effective mass, interlayer coupling and asymmetrical on-site energies due to a vertically-applied electric field. For bilayer graphene, we find two important characteristics, i.e. mixing and interference of intervalley scatterings in the presence of a scatter array, as well as a perpendicular-field induced site-energy asymmetry which deforms severely or even destroys completely the Hofstadter-type band structures due to the dependence of Bloch-wave expansion coefficients on the applied electric field.","Using first principles calculations to interpret XANES experiments: extracting the size-dependence of the (p , T) phase diagram of sub-nanometer Cu clusters in an O2 environment.",https://www.ncbi.nlm.nih.gov/pubmed/30625421,Journal of physics.

We obtain (p , T) phase diagrams: these differ notably for the nanoclusters compared to the bulk. Both the theory and experiment suggest that in the presence of oxygen, the cluster will oxidize from its elemental state to the oxidized state as the temperature decreases. We obtain a clear trend for the transition of Cu n   →  Cu n O n/2: we see that the smaller the cluster, the greater is the tendency toward oxidation. However, we do not see a monotonic size-dependent trend for the transition of Cu n O n/2  →  Cu n O n .

The TiO2 nanoparticles with an average edge length of ∼10.1 nm were uniformly distributed on the crystal surface of a Cu2O cube {100}. The photocatalytic performance of the composite was effectively tuned by controlling the amount of TiO2. The Cu2O/TiO2 (60 wt%, labeled as CT-60) exhibits the highest enhanced photocatalytic activity in hydrogen production with H2 evolution of 3002.5 μmol g-1. The yield remained around 92.6% after three cycles. Hydrogen production of the CT-60 is 103 and 8.5 fold higher than the cubic Cu2O and TiO2 nanoparticles, respectively. The improvement in photocatalytic performance could be attributed to the formation of p-n heterojunction. Furthermore, the interface effect of Cu2O and TiO2 caused a broader absorbance in the visible-light region and the lower recombination of photogenerated electron-hole pairs. It is believed that the Cu2O/TiO2 p-n heterojunction composites could provide an alternative method to design highly efficient photocatalysts for solar energy.",Improved charge separation of NiS nanoparticles modified defect-engineered black TiO2 hollow nanotubes for boosting solar-driven photocatalytic H2 evolution.,https://www.ncbi.nlm.nih.gov/pubmed/30625419,Nanotechnology,2019 02 15,"NiS nanoparticles modified black TiO2 hollow nanotubes (NBTNs) are successfully synthesized via surface hydrogenation and the facile solvothermal method. The unique structure with intensified surface and interface characteristics endow NBTNs with more catalytic sites, and increase charge carrier separation efficiency with an extended charge lifetime, overwhelmingly promoting its photocatalytic performance. The resultant NBTNs possess a relatively high surface area and pore size of ∼89 m2 g-1 and ∼9.8 nm, respectively. The resultant NBTNs exhibit an excellent solar-driven photocatalytic hydrogen rate (3.17 mmol h-1 g-1), which is almost as high as that of Pt as cocatalyst, in which the apparent quantum yield of 5.4% (420 nm) is recorded for the NBTNs sample. Moreover, the turnover number can be up to 116 000 within 48 h and the turnover frequency is 2400 for NiS. This novel strategy could provide a better understanding of cocatalyst photocatalytic mechanisms, and a scheme simultaneously regulating the morphology and structure of photocatalysts for promoting H2 generation.",Revelation of spin glass behavior in Ru doped MnNiGe: experiment and theory.,https://www.ncbi.nlm.nih.gov/pubmed/30625418,Journal of physics.

Timolol loading by the conventional soaking method does not significantly alter the critical properties of the contact lens. However, there are challenges of low drug loading and high burst release. This research work aimed to investigate the effect of gold nanoparticles (GNPs) on loading and its release kinetics from the contact lens using the soaking method. In one approach, GNPs were loaded into the timolol soaking solution (GNPs-SS), and in another approach, GNPs were incorporated into the contact lenses (GNPs-CL) during fabrication. The contact lenses were soaked at two different concentrations of timolol (i.e., 2 mg/ml and 4 mg/ml). Swelling and optical transmittance were not significantly affected by the presence of GNPs in the contact lenses. A significant uptake/loading of timolol using the GNPs in both the approaches was observed. The in vitro flux data showed no significant improvement in the release rate profiles of timolol when using both approaches. However, the in vivo study in the rabbit tear fluid showed high timolol concentration with the GNPs-laden contact lens at all timepoints in comparison to the soaked contact lenses without GNPs. The in vivo pharmacodynamic study in rabbits showed a 2 mmHg average fall in intraocular pressure (72 h) using the GNPs-laden contact lenses, while the soaked contact lenses without GNPs and eye drops solution (0.5 %w/v) showed 2 mmHg. The drug distribution study in the ocular tissue showed a significant improvement in the drug deposition with the GNPs-laden contact lenses in the ciliary muscle and conjunctiva. This study successfully demonstrated the potential of GNPs to enhance the uptake of drug from the drug soaking solution to treat glaucoma without compromising the critical properties of contact lens. STATEMENT OF SIGNIFICANCE: In this study, we have overcome the limitation of the conventional soaking method of low drug loading and high burst release from the contact lenses. We have investigated the effect of gold nanoparticles (GNPs) on the timolol loading and its release kinetics from the contact lenses. The study revealed the potential of GNPs to enhance the uptake of timolol from the timolol soaking solution to treat glaucoma without compromising the critical lens properties.","The hypervirulent Coxiella burnetii Guiana strain compared in silico, in vitro and in vivo to the Nine Mile and the German strain.",https://www.ncbi.nlm.nih.gov/pubmed/30625413,Clinical microbiology and infection : the official publication of the European Society of Clinical Microbiology and Infectious Diseases,2019 01 28,"Q fever epidemic outbreaks have been reported in French Guiana and in The Netherlands.

However, there is still scarce evidence of the build-up of these predictions during sentence comprehension. Using event-related brain potentials, we investigated sustained processes associated to semantic prediction during online sentence comprehension. To address this, participants read sentences with varying levels of contextual constraint one word at a time. A 1000 ms interval preceded the final word, which could be congruent or incongruent. A slow sustained negativity developed gradually over the course of sentences, showing differences across conditions, with increasingly larger amplitudes for high than low levels of constraint. The effect was maximal in the interval preceding the closing word. This interval elicited a left-dominant slow negative potential with a graded amplitude modulation to contextual constraint, replicating previous results in speech comprehension. We argue that these slow potentials index the engagement of cognitive operations associated to semantic prediction. In addition, we replicated the finding of an earlier onset of the N400 effect (incongruent minus congruent) for high relative to low contextual constraint, suggesting facilitated processing for contextually-supported and highly expected words. Altogether, these results are consistent with prediction-based models of language comprehension and they also strengthen the value of investigating slow components as potential indices of mechanisms linked to language prediction.",Unbiased age-specific structural brain atlases for Chinese pediatric population.,https://www.ncbi.nlm.nih.gov/pubmed/30625395,NeuroImage,2019 06 14,"In magnetic resonance (MR) imaging studies of child brain development, structural brain atlases usually serve as important references for the pediatric population, in which individual images are spatially normalized into a common or standard stereotactic space. However, the popular existing pediatric brain atlases (e.g., National Institutes of Health pediatric atlases, NIH-PD) are mostly based on MR images obtained from Caucasian populations and thus are not ideal for the characterization of the brains of Chinese children due to neuroanatomical differences related to genetic and environmental factors. Here, we use an unbiased template construction algorithm to create a set of age-specific Chinese pediatric (CHN-PD) atlases based on high-quality T1-and T2-weighted MR images from 328 cognitively normal Chinese children aged 6-12 years. The CHN-PD brain atlases include asymmetric and symmetric templates, sex-specific templates and tissue probability templates, and contain multiple age-specific templates at one-year intervals. A direct comparison of the CHN-PD and NIH-PD atlases reveals dramatic anatomical differences mainly in the bilateral frontal and parietal regions. After applying the CHN-PD and NIH-PD atlases to two independent Chinese pediatric datasets (N = 114 and N = 71), we find that the CHN-PD atlases result in significantly higher accuracy than the NIH-PD atlases in both predicting ""brain age"" and guiding brain tissue segmentation. These results suggest that the CHN-PD brain atlases are necessary for studies of the typical and atypical development of the Chinese pediatric population. These CHN-PD atlases have been released on the Neuroimaging Informatics Tools and Resources Clearinghouse (NITRC) website (https://www.nitrc.org/projects/chn-pd).",The redox biology of redox-inert zinc ions.,https://www.ncbi.nlm.nih.gov/pubmed/30625394,Free radical biology & medicine,2019 04 08,"Zinc(II) ions are redox-inert in biology. Yet, their interaction with sulfur of cysteine in cellular proteins can confer ligand-centered redox activity on zinc coordination sites, control protein functions, and generate signalling zinc ions as potent effectors of many cellular processes. The specificity and relative high affinity of binding sites for zinc allow regulation in redox biology, free radical biology, and the biology of reactive species. Understanding the role of zinc in these areas of biology requires an understanding of how cellular Zn2+ is homeostatically controlled and can serve as a regulatory ion in addition to Ca2+, albeit at much lower concentrations. A rather complex system of dozens of transporters and metallothioneins buffer the relatively high (hundreds of micromolar) total cellular zinc concentrations in such a way that the available zinc ion concentrations are only picomolar but can fluctuate in signalling. The proteins targeted by Zn2+ transients include enzymes controlling phosphorylation and redox signalling pathways. Networks of regulatory functions of zinc integrate gene expression and metabolic and signalling pathways at several hierarchical levels. They affect enzymatic catalysis, protein structure and protein-protein/biomolecular interactions and add to the already impressive number of catalytic and structural functions of zinc in an estimated three thousand human zinc proteins. The effects of zinc on redox biology have adduced evidence that zinc is an antioxidant. Without further qualifications, this notion is misleading and prevents a true understanding of the roles of zinc in biology. Its antioxidant-like effects are indirect and expressed only in certain conditions because a lack of zinc and too much zinc have pro-oxidant effects. Teasing apart these functions based on quantitative considerations of homeostatic control of cellular zinc is critical because opposite consequences are observed depending on the concentrations of zinc: pro- or anti-apoptotic, pro- or anti-inflammatory and cytoprotective or cytotoxic. The article provides a biochemical basis for the links between redox and zinc biology and discusses why zinc has pleiotropic functions. Perturbation of zinc metabolism is a consequence of conditions of redox stress. Zinc deficiency, either nutritional or conditioned, and cellular zinc overload cause oxidative stress. Thus, there is causation in the relationship between zinc metabolism and the many diseases associated with oxidative stress.",Regulation of mitochondrial function as a promising target in platelet activation-related diseases.,https://www.ncbi.nlm.nih.gov/pubmed/30625393,Free radical biology & medicine,2019 04 29,"Platelets are anucleated cell elements produced by fragmentation of the cytoplasm of megakaryocytes and have a unique metabolic phenotype compared with circulating leukocytes, exhibiting a high coupling efficiency to mitochondrial adenosine triphosphate production with reduced respiratory reserve capacity. Platelet mitochondria are well suited for ex vivo analysis of different diseases. Even some diseases induce mitochondrial changes in platelets without reflecting them in other organs. During platelet activation, an integrated participation of glycolysis and oxidative phosphorylation is mediated by oxidative stress production-dependent signaling. The platelet activation-dependent procoagulant activity mediated by collagen, thrombin and hyperglycemia induce mitochondrial dysfunction to promote thrombosis in oxidative stress-associated pathological conditions. Interestingly, some compounds exhibit a protective action on platelet mitochondrial dysfunction through control of mitochondrial oxidative stress production or inhibition of respiratory complexes. They can be grouped in a) Natural source-derived compounds (e.g. Xanthohumol, Salvianoloc acid A and Sila-amide derivatives of NAC), b) TPP+-linked small molecules (e.g. mitoTEMPO and mitoQuinone) and c) FDA-approved drugs (e.g. metformin and statins), illustrating the wide range of molecular structures capable of effectively interacting with platelet mitochondria.

However, there is limited data regarding the prognostic utility of genetic profiling in MF patients undergoing allogeneic hematopoietic stem cell transplantation (allo-HCT). We performed high-throughput sequencing of 585 genes on pre-transplant samples from 101 patients with MF who underwent allo-HCT and evaluated the association of mutations and clinical variables with transplantation outcomes. Overall survival (OS) at 5 years post-transplantation was 52%, and relapse-free survival (RFS) was 51.1 % for this cohort. Nonrelapse mortality (NRM) accounted for most deaths. Patient's age, donor's age, donor type, and Dynamic International Prognostic Scoring System score at diagnosis did not predict for outcomes. Mutations known to be associated with increased risk of disease progression, such as ASXL1, SRSF2, IDH1/2, EZH2, and TP53, did not impact OS or RFS. The presence of U2AF1 (P = .007) or DNMT3A (P = .034) mutations was associated with worse OS. A Mutation-Enhanced International Prognostic Scoring System 70 score was available for 80 patients (79%), and there were no differences in outcomes between patients with high risk scores and those with intermediate and low risk scores. Collectively, these data identify mutational predictors of outcome in MF patients undergoing allo-HCT. These genetic biomarkers in conjunction with clinical variables may have important utility in guiding transplantation decision making.",Increased Health Care Utilization and Costs during Allogeneic Hematopoietic Cell Transplantation for Acute Leukemia and Myelodysplastic Syndromes in Adolescents and Young Adults Compared with Children: A Multicenter Study.,https://www.ncbi.nlm.nih.gov/pubmed/30625391,Biology of blood and marrow transplantation : journal of the American Society for Blood and Marrow Transplantation,2019 05 11,"Allogeneic hematopoietic cell transplantation (HCT) is a curative option for patients with acute leukemia and myelodysplastic syndromes (MDS) but is associated with significant cost. Compared with children (age <15 years), adolescents and young adults (AYA; age 15 to 39 years) undergoing HCT have an increased risk for transplantation-related complications. However, whether such complications translate into increased resource utilization and costs during HCT remains unknown. Therefore, we conducted a multicenter database study using the Pediatric Health Information System database, an administrative database containing resource utilization data from 49 US tertiary children's hospitals to compare inpatient costs and resource utilization in children and AYA undergoing HCT for acute leukemia and MDS. The International Classification of Diseases, Ninth Revision, Clinical Modification codes were used to identify HCT recipients and transplantation-related complications occurring up to 1 year post-HCT. We identified 1693 HCT recipients at pediatric centers between January 2010 and September 2014. Eighty percent of the total costs (from admission for HCT up to 1 year post-HCT) occurred during the initial transplantation admission. During initial admission, although AYA and children had a similar median length of stay (LOS) of 43 days, AYA incurred significantly greater adjusted costs ($338,458 versus $275,723; P < .001) and costs per hospital day ($7122 versus $5838; P < .001). Median total costs and costs per day during subsequent time periods post-HCT were also significantly greater in the AYA group. In multivariable analysis, increasing age at HCT, LOS, use of cord blood or an unrelated donor, occurrence of any graft-versus-host disease, infection, and use of dialysis or mechanical ventilation were significant drivers of increased cost at initial admission. In conclusion, allogeneic HCT for acute leukemia and MDS is associated with higher costs in AYA recipients than in children. Therefore, directing efforts and resources aimed at reducing HCT-related costs may be advantageous in this high-risk group.",Hematopoietic Cell Transplantation and Utilization of Fertility Preservation Services.,https://www.ncbi.nlm.nih.gov/pubmed/30625390,Biology of blood and marrow transplantation : journal of the American Society for Blood and Marrow Transplantation,2019 05 11,"Conditioning regimens for hematopoietic cell transplantation (HCT) are harmful to reproductive function, but national utilization of fertility preservation (FP) before HCT has not been studied.

Key dates, procedures codes, and diagnosis codes were extracted from administrative and health services commercial claims data, which were obtained from FAIR Health's national claims database, to construct 29 patient-specific clinical journey timelines detailing the time from diagnosis to FP and to HCT. Patient characteristics studied include sex, age, HCT type (autologous and allogeneic), and census region. Key findings from primary and secondary analyses were that 7% of the HCT cohort had claims for FP services, FP utilization before HCT decreased with increasing age, there were 102 days (median) between FP and HCT procedure date, and 7 of 29 patients who received FP services had a nonmalignant primary indication for HCT.

In its acute form (aGVHD), GVHD involves the skin, liver, and gastrointestinal (GI) tract, with GI involvement most strongly associated with poor prognosis. This retrospective cohort study used US healthcare claims data for 2008 to 2015 to identify patients who developed GI aGVHD after allo-HCT performed as curative treatment for hematologic malignancy and compared them with patients who did not develop aGVHD in terms of outcomes related to survival, infections, healthcare resource utilization (HRU), and costs. Whereas the patients without aGVHD saw a 66% improvement in 1-year survival between 2009 and 2015, this effect was not observed in patients with GI aGVHD. Compared with patients without evidence of aGVHD, patients with GI aGVHD were 3.9-fold more likely to develop an infection in the year after allo-HCT. Similarly, patients who developed GI aGVHD were 4.3-fold more likely to have an inpatient admission after allo-HCT discharge, and such an admission cost on average 47% more than an admission for patients without aGVHD. Our findings confirm that GI involvement in aGVHD is associated with higher mortality, risk of infection, HRU, and cost compared with absence of aGVHD.",Monocyte Subpopulation Recovery as Predictors of Hematopoietic Cell Transplantation Outcomes.,https://www.ncbi.nlm.nih.gov/pubmed/30625388,Biology of blood and marrow transplantation : journal of the American Society for Blood and Marrow Transplantation,2019 05 14,"Monocyte recovery after hematopoietic cell transplantation (HCT) has been correlated with overall survival (OS). However, monocytes are heterogeneous and consist of classic (CD14++CD16-), intermediate (CD14+CD16+), and nonclassic (CD14+CD16++) subpopulations, with unique functional properties. We hypothesized that monocyte subpopulation reconstitution would vary based on allogeneic stem cell source and would be associated with outcomes. We studied monocyte subpopulation recovery at days 28, 60, 100, 180, and 365 post-HCT among 202 patients with hematologic malignancy. Significant differences in absolute monocyte count (AMC) and monocyte subpopulation counts at days 60 and 100 were identified based on stem cell source (all P < .01), with more robust recovery in umbilical cord blood (UCB) recipients. Using 2-fold cross-validation, optimal cutpoints were calculated for day 28 AMC and monocyte subpopulations based on OS. These were used to calculate hazard ratios for OS, disease-free survival (DFS), relapse, transplant-related mortality (TRM), and acute and chronic graft-versus-host disease. OS and DFS were superior when AMC and classic monocyte recovery were above optimal cutpoints (all P < .03). Relapse was reduced for those with AMC (P < .01) and classic (P = .05) monocyte counts above optimal cutpoints. TRM was also reduced when classic (P = .02) monocyte count exceeded optimal cutpoints. Intermediate and nonclassic monocyte recovery were not associated with outcomes. In summary, hematopoietic cell source is associated with monocyte subpopulation recovery, with the early robust recovery in UCB recipients. Recovery of AMC and classic monocytes were prognostic for survival, relapse, and TRM. These indicators may identify patients at increased risk for post-HCT failure and guide therapeutic interventions.",Immune Cytopenias after Ex Vivo CD34+-Selected Allogeneic Hematopoietic Cell Transplantation.,https://www.ncbi.nlm.nih.gov/pubmed/30625387,Biology of blood and marrow transplantation : journal of the American Society for Blood and Marrow Transplantation,2019 06 13,"Immune-mediated cytopenias (ICs), such as immune thrombocytopenia and immune hemolytic anemia, are among the adverse events after allogeneic hematopoietic cell transplantation (allo-HCT). Previous reports suggest that in vivo T cell depletion may increase the incidence of IC after allo-HCT. We evaluated whether a strategy that reduces functional donor T cells via ex vivo CD34+-selection associates with the development of IC in a cohort of 408 patients who underwent allo-HCT for hematologic malignancy. The cumulative incidence of IC at 6, 12, and 36 months after the 30-day landmark post-HCT was 3.4%, 4.9%, and 5.8%, respectively. Among 23 patients who developed IC, 7 died of relapse-related mortality and 4 of nonrelapse mortality. A median 2 types of treatment (range, 1 to 5) was required to resolve IC, and there was considerable heterogeneity in the therapies used. In univariable analyses, a hematologic malignancy Disease Risk Index (DRI) score of 3 was significantly associated with an increased risk of IC compared with a DRI of 1 or 2 (hazard ratio [HR], 4.12; P = .003), and IC (HR, 2.4; P = .03) was associated with increased risk of relapse. In a multivariable analysis that included DRI, IC remained significantly associated with increased risk of relapse (HR, 2.4; P = .03). Our findings show that IC events occur with relatively similar frequency in patients after ex vivo CD34+-selected allo-HCT compared with unmodified allo-HCT, suggesting that reduced donor T cell immunity is not causative of IC. Moreover, we noted a possible link between its development and/or treatment and increased risk of relapse."

In this study, an enzyme-based assay was developed in 1536-well plates using recombinant human AChE combined with human or rat liver microsomes. The AChE activity was measured by two methods with different readouts: colorimetric and fluorescent. The assay exhibited exceptional performance characteristics including large assay signal window, low well-to-well variability and high reproducibility. The performance of the assays with microsomes was characterized by testing a group of known AChE inhibitors including parent compounds and their metabolites. Large potency differences between the parent compounds and the metabolites were observed in the assay with microsome addition. Both assay readouts were required for maximal sensitivity.

Each ommatidium has the typical cellular arrangement present also in the eyes of larger staphyliniform beetles, but strongly curved lenses, short cones, reduced pigment cells, a high density of pigment granules and certain modifications of the rhabdom seem typical of ptiliid eyes. Allometric analyses show that as body size decreases, the number of facets drops more steeply than their average size does.",STRONG-D: Strength training regimen for normal weight diabetics: Rationale and design.,https://www.ncbi.nlm.nih.gov/pubmed/30625372,Contemporary clinical trials,2019 02 24,"Currently, there is a lack of data on effective lifestyle recommendations for normal-weight diabetics (NWD), who can represent up to 1 in 5 individuals with Type II Diabetes Mellitus (T2DM). NWD is especially prevalent in Asian populations and the elderly. Specific exercise treatment recommendations are needed for patients with normal-weight diabetes (NWD), as those in this category face higher mortality rates than overweight and obese diabetics. Standard T2DM treatment recommends aerobic training; however, performing aerobic training alone may not be appropriate for NWD and strength training may be a more effective treatment recommendation.",Endoplasmic reticulum stress induced autophagy in 6-OHDA-induced Parkinsonian rats.,https://www.ncbi.nlm.nih.gov/pubmed/30625371,Brain research bulletin,2019 02 16,"Both endoplasmic reticulum (ER) stress and autophagy involve in the pathological process of Parkinson's disease (PD). But the relationship between them is not clear in PD. A 6-OHDA-induced parkinsonian rat is recognized as a standard model for many years, and it can be used in experimental study. The glucose regulated protein 78 (GRP78) is a master regulator of ER stress, and the C/EBP homologous binding protein (CHOP) is an indicator of the UPR signaling. Besides, the Beclin-1 is also well known as a regulator of autophagy, and P62 is a speciﬁc marker to monitor autophagy. Therefore, we investigated the expressions of GRP78, CHOP, Beclin-1 and P62 in 6-OHDA-induced parkinsonian rat. Unilateral 6-OHDA injection into medial forebrain bundle was used except sham-operated rats. The rats were randomly divided into 6 groups: a sham-operated group; a model group; a 3-methyladenine (3-MA) group, administered 3-MA---autophagy inhibitor; a rapamycin group, administered rapamycin---autophagy inducer; a 4-phenylbutyric acids (4-PBA) group, administered 4-PBA---ER stress inhibitor; a tunicamycin (TM) group, administered TM---ER stress inducer. The results showed that the expressions of GRP78, CHOP and Beclin-1 increased, P62 decreased in model group; the expressions of GRP78 and CHOP were unchanged in 3-MA group and rapamycin group; but the expression of Beclin-1 decreased and P62 increased in 4-PBA group, while the expression of Beclin-1 increased and P62 decreased in TM group. These data suggest that ER stress and autophagy occurred in 6-OHDA-induced parkinsonian rat, and ER stress might induce autophagy. The result is important for the pathological mechanism of PD.",Extracellular cardiolipin regulates select immune functions of microglia and microglia-like cells.,https://www.ncbi.nlm.nih.gov/pubmed/30625370,Brain research bulletin,2019 02 16,"Cardiolipin is a mitochondrial membrane phospholipid with several well-defined metabolic roles. Cardiolipin can be released extracellularly by damaged cells and has been shown to affect peripheral immune functions. We hypothesized that extracellular cardiolipin can also regulate functions of microglia, the resident immune cells of the central nervous system (CNS). We demonstrate that extracellular cardiolipin increases microglial phagocytosis and neurotrophic factor expression, as well as decreases the release of inflammatory mediators and cytotoxins by activated microglia-like cells. These results identify extracellular cardiolipin as a potential CNS intercellular signaling molecule that can regulate key microglial immune functions associated with neurodegenerative diseases.",Xenopus slc7a5 is essential for notochord function and eye development.,https://www.ncbi.nlm.nih.gov/pubmed/30625369,Mechanisms of development,2019 06 03,"slc7a5 (also known as LAT1), largely accepted as an amino acid transporter, has been shown to play important roles in cancer and developmental processes. Because knockout mice of Slc7a5 are embryonically lethal due to placental defects, it is difficult to evaluate its role in early development. In this study, expression and function of slc7a5 were evaluated in Xenopus laevis embryos that develop without a placenta. Expression of slc7a5 was detected in the notochord and in the eye and it was not co-localized with slc3a2, which helps slc7a5 to localize at the plasma membrane, before the late neurula stage. Loss-of-function experiment with a morpholino antisense oligonucleotide led to defect of neural and non-neural patterning, inhibition of primary neurogenesis, and disruption of eye development. Disruption of neural development and primary neurogenesis was likely due to impaired notochord development as sonic hedgehog (shh) signaling pathway was compromised in slc7a5-inhibited embryos. These results suggest that slc7a5 is required for notochord development and subsequent primary neurogenesis via shh/gli signaling and for eye development. These novel developmental roles of slc7a5 appeared to be independent of transport function at least before the late neurula stage.",L-type amino acid transporter 1 utilizing prodrugs of ferulic acid revealed structural features supporting the design of prodrugs for brain delivery.,https://www.ncbi.nlm.nih.gov/pubmed/30625368,European journal of pharmaceutical sciences : official journal of the European Federation for Pharmaceutical Sciences,2019 05 09,"Ferulic acid (FA), a natural antioxidant, has displayed some potential benefits against Alzheimer's disease. However, due to its poor blood-brain barrier (BBB) permeation and low bioavailability, the clinical use of FA for the treatment of Alzheimer's disease has been limited. In the present study, we applied an L-type amino acid transporter (LAT1) - mediated prodrug approach to deliver FA into the mouse brain and synthetized three novel LAT1-utilizing prodrugs of FA. We used a previously proposed methodology for the development of transporter-utilizing prodrugs and investigated their cellular uptake via LAT1 in vitro in ARPE-19 cells, BBB permeation using in situ perfusion in mice and pharmacokinetics after a single i.p. injection in mice; and compared the findings to our previous structure-pharmacokinetics relationship analysis of LAT1-utilizing prodrugs. In addition, we evaluated interspecies differences in the bioconversion rate of the ester-based prodrug in mouse and human plasma and liver S9 subcellular fraction. It was found that amide-based prodrugs with an aromatic ring in the promoiety were effectively bound to LAT1 and utilized the transporter for cellular uptake in vitro and crossed the BBB after in situ perfusion in mice. In addition, the amide prodrug with the promoiety directly conjugated in the meta-position to FA was bioconverted to the parent drug in mouse brain. Importantly, the study showed that the analogous ester-based prodrug did bind to LAT1 but did not utilize the transporter for cellular uptake in ARPE-19 cells. However, the presence of an ester linker between the prodrug and the parent drug promoted favorable bioconversion properties in human in comparison to mouse tissues in vitro i.e. the ester prodrug showed higher stability in human plasma (75% of intact prodrug in 5 h) and liver S9 subcellular fraction (181 min) in comparison to mouse plasma (t½ 2.6 min) and liver S9 fraction (t½ 23.3 min), suggesting that ester-based prodrugs may offer potential benefits in humans. In conclusion, switching from an amide to ester linker between the promoiety and the parent drug can affect the bioconversion rate of prodrugs in different species as well as influencing their cellular uptake mechanism. Furthermore, the results demonstrated the effective application of structure-pharmacokinetic relationships and screening methodology for developing LAT1-utilizing prodrugs and highlighted the importance of evaluating the biotransformation of parent drug and prodrugs in different species.",Beta-glucan and arabinogalactan-based xerogels for abuse-deterrent opioid formulations.,https://www.ncbi.nlm.nih.gov/pubmed/30625367,European journal of pharmaceutical sciences : official journal of the European Federation for Pharmaceutical Sciences,2019 05 09,"Novel polysaccharide hydrogels based on Methocel and beta-glucan or arabinogalactan and corresponding xerogels were prepared and described. Phase stability of hydrogels was confirmed over multiple freeze-thaw cycles. Binary beta-glucan:Methocel hydrogels showed the highest freeze-thaw stability in terms of their syneresis. The viscosity of binary hydrogels was further increased by adding water-soluble resin. Freeze drying of polysaccharide gels yields xerogels suitable as abuse-deterrent vehicles for opioid delivery. The xerogels were characterized by infrared spectroscopy, X-ray diffraction, differential scanning calorimetry, scanning electron microscopy and by their swelling behavior. As a model opioid, tramadol hydrochloride formulations were prepared with various xerogel matrices and dissolution-release profiles were determined. The xerogel matrix acts as a functional excipient that forms a viscous gel barrier with decreased rate of tramadol release. Moreover, slower drug release with no dose dumping is observed in the presence of ethanol. The release kinetics demonstrated that hydrophilic gels with beta-glucan or arabinogalactan are effective for controlling and prolonging the drug release for 12 h which could reduce the required number of administrations."

Est903 displayed moderate similarities to two lipolytic enzymes from Rhodopirellula islandica and contained a distinctive pentapeptide motif (GFSAG) that differed from those of all known fourteen families of bacterial lipolytic enzymes. Est903 was regarded as from a new bacterial lipolytic enzyme family through multiple sequence alignment and phylogenetic analysis. The recombinant Est903 showed the highest activity for ρ-nitrophenol butyrate. The pH optimum and temperature optimum of the recombinant enzyme was 9.0 and 51 °C, respectively. Also, this enzyme displayed moderate thermostability, high activity under alkaline conditions, and good tolerance against several organic solvents. In addition, the compatibility test and washing performance analysis revealed that Est903 had good compatibility with commercial laundry detergent and high cleaning ability of oil stains. These good properties make Est903 a potential candidate in organic synthesis or detergent industry.",Rice starch citrates and lactates: A comparative study on hot water and cold water swelling starches.,https://www.ncbi.nlm.nih.gov/pubmed/30625355,International journal of biological macromolecules,2019 03 02,"In the present study, modifications were done by varying concentration of citric and lactic acid (20 g and 40 g) to produce starch citrates (SC20, SC40) and lactates (LA20, LA40), followed by alcoholic alkaline treatment to produce cold water swelling modified starches (CWS). These modified starches were then compared to their native hot water swelling (HWS) counterparts in terms of functional properties. The CWS starches demonstrated instant viscosity even at room temperature and thus eliminate the need of heating assembly. The CWS (SC40) showed the highest swelling power and water binding capacity among all samples. Morphological characteristics revealed enlargement and roughening of granules after alcoholic alkaline treatment. Absence of 1047 cm-1 peak in FTIR spectra of CWS samples verified the loss of crystalline structure. The least percent retrogradation of 31.33% was exhibited by HWS SC40. Percent increase in hardness of gels after 7 days' storage showed remarkable decline in retrogradation tendency of CWS samples. Absence of gelatinization peak and high initial viscosity of CWS samples confirmed gelatinization due to alcoholic alkaline treatment.",Graphene oxide containing chitosan scaffolds for cartilage tissue engineering.,https://www.ncbi.nlm.nih.gov/pubmed/30625354,International journal of biological macromolecules,2019 03 02,"Enhancement of physical and mechanical properties of the scaffolds is achieved via various methods including cross-linking and incorporation of nano particles. In the present research chitosan-based scaffolds firstly were reinforced with the incorporation of the graphene oxide (GO) nanoparticles. The GO nanoparticles were synthesized from graphite successfully and were identified by TGA, XRD, SEM and FTIR analytical methods. Nanocomposite scaffolds based on chitosan with different percentages of the GO were prepared. The chitosan-GO nanocomposite scaffolds were then simultaneously sterilized and cross-linked in an autoclave and comprehensively characterized. In XRD measurements, the absence of the peak at 10° related to GO, is evidence that the GO layers are exfoliated. With increasing the GO concentration from 0 to 0.1, 0.2 and 0.3%, physical and mechanical properties were improved, considerably. Seeding of the human articular chondrocytes on the nanocomposite scaffolds showed an increased proliferation with augmentation of the GO percentage particularly in prolonged cultivation periods (14 days). Investigation of the human articular chondrocyte morphology revealed a more spherical morphology of the cells on the cross-linked scaffolds for 21 days of culture in vitro.","Structural and enzymatic characterization of Peruvianin‑I, the first germin-like protein with proteolytic activity.",https://www.ncbi.nlm.nih.gov/pubmed/30625353,International journal of biological macromolecules,2019 05 31,"The germin-like protein (GLP) purified from Thevetia peruviana, Peruvianin-I, is the only one described as having proteolytic activity. Therefore, the goal of this study was to investigate the structural features responsible for its enzymatic activity. Although the amino acid sequence of Peruvianin-I showed high identity with other GLPs, it exhibited punctual mutations, which were responsible for the absence of oxalate oxidase activity. The phylogenetic analysis showed that Peruvianin-I does not belong to any classification of GLP subfamilies. Moreover, Peruvianin-I contains a catalytic triad found in all plant cysteine peptidases. Molecular docking simulations confirmed the role of the catalytic triad in its proteolytic activity. Synchrotron radiation circular dichroism assays confirmed that Peruvianin-I was stable at pH ranging from 5.0 to 8.0 and that it presented significant structural changes only above 60 °C. The addition of iodoacetamide caused changes in its native conformation, but only a slight effect was observed after adding a reducing agent. This study reports an unusual protein with germin-like structure, lacking typical oxalate oxidase activity. Instead, the proteolytic activity observed suggests that the protein is a cysteine peptidase. These structural peculiarities make Peruvianin‑I an interesting model for further understanding of the action of laticifer fluids in plant defense.",Mechanism of the anti-inflammatory activity by a polysaccharide from Dictyophora indusiata in lipopolysaccharide-stimulated macrophages.,https://www.ncbi.nlm.nih.gov/pubmed/30625352,International journal of biological macromolecules,2019 05 31,"Dictyophora indusiata polysaccharides (DIP) shows antioxidant, anti-tumor and immunostimulatory activities. However, the anti-inflammatory roles of DIP in NLRP3 inflammasome in LPS-stimulated macrophages are still not well defined. In this study, we investigated the mechanism of the anti-inflammatory activity of DIP in LPS-primed RAW264.7 macrophages. Our data showed that DIP inhibited NF-κB signal pathway via modulating TLR4 expression, phosphorylation of IκBα and nuclear translocation of NF-κB-p65 subunit. Meanwhile, DIP reduced inflammasome activation via decreasing NLRP3 expression in cytoplasmic pools, limiting self-assembly of NLRP3 inflammasome, as well as the subsequent activation of caspase-1 and the secretion of IL-1β and IL-18. For the first time, we show that the anti-inflammatory activity of DIP is mediated by inhibiting TLR4/NF-κB signal pathway and NLRP3 inflammasome activation during LPS-induced acute inflammation in RAW264.7 macrophages.",Hyaluronic acid and hyaluronic acid: Sucrose nanogels for hydrophobic cancer drug delivery.,https://www.ncbi.nlm.nih.gov/pubmed/30625351,International journal of biological macromolecules,2019 05 31,"Porous and biodegradable hyaluronic acid (HA) nanogel and their copolymeric forms with sucrose (Suc), HA:Sucrose (HA:Suc) nanogels, were synthesized by employing glycerol diglycidyl ether (GDE) as crosslinker with a single step reaction in surfactant-free medium. The size of the nanogels was determined as 150 ± 50 nm in dried state from SEM images and found to increase to about 540 ± 47 nm in DI water measured with DLS measurements. The surface areas of HA and HA:Suc nanogels were measured as 18.07 ± 2.4 and 32.30 ± 6.1 m2/g with porosities of 3.58 ± 1.8, and 9.44 ± 3.1 nm via BET analysis, respectively. The zeta potentials for HA and HA:Suc nanogels were measured as -33 ± 1.4 and - 30 ± 1.2 mV, respectively. The thermal degradation of both types of nanogels revealed similar trends, while hydrolytic degradation of the nanogels was about 22.7 ± 0.2 wt% in 15 days. Both HA and HA:Suc nanogels were stable in blood up to 250 μg/mL concentration with approximately 0.5 ± 0.1% hemolysis ratio and 76 ± 12% blood clotting indices, respectively.

The physical properties, structure, antioxidant and Al3+-sensing abilities of CMCS-quercetin composite films were investigated. Results showed CMCS-quercetin composite films presented a dark yellowish color. When compared with CMCS film, CMCS-quercetin composite films containing 5 and 7.5 wt% of quercetin on CMCS basis exhibited higher thicknesses, opacity and thermal stability; however, presented lower moisture contents, UV-vis light transmittance and elongation at break. Besides, the incorporation of quercetin could not significantly change the water solubility and water vapor barrier property of CMCS film. Morphological observation showed the surface of CMCS-quercetin composite film became coarse when 7.5 wt% of quercetin was incorporated. Infrared spectra and X-ray diffraction patterns of CMCS-quercetin composite films further indicated quercetin was compatible with CMCS. Importantly, CMCS-quercetin composite films could sustainably release antioxidant ability into aqueous and fatty food stimulants. Moreover, CMCS-quercetin composite films were sensitive to Al3+. The color and UV-vis absorption patterns of CMCS-quercetin composite films were changed by the addition of Al3+. Results suggested that CMCS-quercetin composite films could be used as novel antioxidant and intelligent Al3+-sensing materials in food packaging.",A decade of diverse microglial-neuronal physical interactions in the brain (2008-2018).,https://www.ncbi.nlm.nih.gov/pubmed/30625349,Neuroscience letters,2019 05 30,"Microglia are unique cells of the central nervous system (CNS) with a distinct ontogeny and molecular profile.

Additionally, patients with pathological pain and brain dysfunction typically present with movement disorders, including diminished voluntary control and increased variability in bimanual movement performance. In healthy subjects, SMI leads to dysesthesia and bimanual movement motor dysfunction. However, the brain localization of this activity remains unclear, particularly in SMI-induced dysesthesia and decrease in movement accuracy. In this study, 17 healthy participants were asked to perform repetitive flexion/extension exercises with their wrists in a congruent/incongruent position while viewing the activity in a mirror. Indeed, SMI induced dysesthesia and decreased bimanual movement accuracy. Moreover, beta band activities of the bilateral presupplementary (P < 0.01) and bilateral cingulate (P < 0.05) motor areas were decreased. Collectively, our findings indicate that SMI induces dysesthesia and movement disorders and reduces beta band activities in motor-related areas.","Doublecortin X (DCX) serine 28 phosphorylation is a regulatory switch, modulating association of DCX with microtubules and actin filaments.",https://www.ncbi.nlm.nih.gov/pubmed/30625347,Biochimica et biophysica acta. Molecular cell research,2019 02 11,"Doublecortin X (DCX) plays essential roles in neuronal development via its regulation of cytoskeleton dynamics. This is mediated through direct interactions between its doublecortin (DC) domains (DC1 and DC2) with microtubules (MTs) and indirect association with actin filaments (F-ACT). While the regulatory role of the DCX C-terminus following DC2 (i.e. DCX residues 275-366) has been established, less is known of the possible contributions made by the DCX N-terminus preceding DC1 (i.e. DCX residues 1-44). Here, we assessed the influence of DCX Ser28 within the DCX N-terminus, on the association of DCX with MTs and F-ACT. We compared the cytoskeletal interactions of the DCX S28E phosphomimetic and DCX S28A phospho-resistant mutants and wild-type DCX. Immunoprecipitation and colocalisation analyses indicated increased association of DCX S28E with F-ACT but decreased interaction with MTs, and conversely enhanced DCX S28A association with MTs but decreased association with F-ACT. To evaluate the impact of DCX mutants on cytoskeletal filaments we performed fluorescence recovery after photobleaching (FRAP) studies on SiR-tubulin and β-actin-mCherry and observed comparable tubulin and actin exchange rates in the presence of DCX WT and DCX S28A. However, we observed faster tubulin exchange rates but slower actin exchange rates in the presence of DCX S28E. Moreover, DCX S28E enhanced the association with the actin-binding protein spinophilin (Spn) suggesting the shift to favour association with both F-ACT and Spn in the presence of DCX S28E. Taken together, our results highlight a new role for DCX S28 as a regulatory switch for cytoskeletal organisation."

However, the absorption of light energy by the human scalp and skull may limit the utility of transcranial PBM in clinical contexts. We have previously shown that targeting light at peripheral tissues (i.e. ""remote PBM"") also provides protection of the brain in an MPTP mouse model of Parkinson's disease, suggesting remote PBM might be a viable alternative strategy for overcoming penetration issues associated with transcranial PBM. This present study aimed to determine an effective pre-conditioning regimen of remote PBM for inducing neuroprotection and elucidate the molecular mechanisms by which remote PBM enhances the resilience of brain tissue. Balb/c mice were irradiated with 670-nm light (4 J/cm2 per day) targeting dorsum and hindlimbs for 2, 5 or 10 days, followed by injection of the parkinsonian neurotoxin MPTP (50 mg/kg) over two consecutive days. Despite no direct irradiation of the head, 10 days of pre-conditioning with remote PBM significantly attenuated MPTP-induced loss of midbrain tyrosine hydroxylase-positive dopaminergic cells and mitigated the increase in FOS-positive neurons in the caudate-putamen complex. Interrogation of the midbrain transcriptome by RNA microarray and pathway enrichment analysis suggested upregulation of cell signaling and migration (including CXCR4+ stem cell and adipocytokine signaling), oxidative stress response pathways and modulation of the blood-brain barrier following remote PBM. These findings establish remote PBM preconditioning as a viable neuroprotective intervention and provide insights into the mechanisms underlying this phenomenon.",Hippocampal Dentate Gyrus Atrophy Predicts Pattern Separation Impairment in Patients with LGI1 Encephalitis.,https://www.ncbi.nlm.nih.gov/pubmed/30625332,Neuroscience,2019 05 15,"Day-to-day life involves the perception of events that resemble one another. For the sufficient encoding and correct retrieval of similar information, the hippocampus provides two essential cognitive processes. Pattern separation refers to the differentiation of similar input information, whereas pattern completion reactivates memory representations based on noisy or degraded stimuli. It has been shown that pattern separation specifically relies on the hippocampal dentate gyrus (DG), whereas pattern completion is performed within CA3 networks. Lesions to these hippocampal networks emerging in the course of neurological disorders may thus affect both processes. In anti-leucine-rich, glioma-inactivated 1 (LGI1) encephalitis it has been shown in animal models and human imaging studies that hippocampal DG and CA3 are preferentially involved in the pathophysiology process. Thus, in order to elucidate the structure-function relationship and contribution of hippocampal subfields to pattern separation, we examined patients (n = 15, age range: 36-77 years) with the rare LGI1 encephalitis showing lesions to hippocampal subfields. Patients were tested 3.53 ± 0.65 years after the acute phase of the disease. Structural sequelae were determined by hippocampal subfield volumetry for the DG, CA1, and CA2/3. Patients showed an overall memory deficit including a significant reduction in pattern separation performance (p = 0.016). In volumetry, we found a global hippocampal volume reduction. The deficits in pattern separation performance were best predicted by the DG (p = 0.029), whereas CA1 was highly predictive of recognition memory deficits (p < 0.001). These results corroborate the framework of a regional specialization of hippocampal functions involved in cognitive processing.",Characterization of Tumor-Suppressor Gene Inactivation Events in 33 Cancer Types.,https://www.ncbi.nlm.nih.gov/pubmed/30625331,Cell reports,2019 01 09,"We systematically investigated the landscape of tumor-suppressor gene (TSG) inactivation events in 33 cancer types by quantitatively measuring their global and local genomic features and their transcriptional and signaling footprints. Using The Cancer Genome Atlas data, we identified with high confidence 337 TSG × cancer events in 30 cancer types, of which 277 were unique events. The majority (91.0%) of these events had a significant downstream impact measured by reduced expression of the TSG itself (cis-effect), disturbance of the transcriptome (trans-effect), or combinatorial effects. Importantly, the transcriptomic changes associated with TSG inactivation events were stronger than the cancer lineage difference, and the same TSGs inactivated in different cancer types tended to cluster together. Several TSGs (e.g., RB1, TP53, and CDKN2A) involved in the regulation of the cell-cycle-formed clusters. Finally, we constructed subnetworks of the TSG × cancer inactivation events, including the local genes frequently disturbed upon the inactivation events.",An Allosteric Interaction Network Promotes Conformation State-Dependent Eviction of the Nas6 Assembly Chaperone from Nascent 26S Proteasomes.,https://www.ncbi.nlm.nih.gov/pubmed/30625330,Cell reports,2019 01 24,"The 26S proteasome is the central ATP-dependent protease in eukaryotes and is essential for organismal health. Proteasome assembly is mediated by several dedicated, evolutionarily conserved chaperone proteins. These chaperones associate transiently with assembly intermediates but are absent from mature proteasomes. Chaperone eviction upon completion of proteasome assembly is necessary for normal proteasome function, but how they are released remains unresolved. Here, we demonstrate that the Nas6 assembly chaperone, homolog of the human oncogene gankyrin, is evicted from nascent proteasomes during completion of assembly via a conformation-specific allosteric interaction of the Rpn5 subunit with the proteasomal ATPase ring. Subsequent ATP binding by the ATPase subunit Rpt3 promotes conformational remodeling of the ATPase ring that evicts Nas6 from the nascent proteasome. Our study demonstrates how assembly-coupled allosteric signals promote chaperone eviction and provides a framework for understanding the eviction of other chaperones from this biomedically important molecular machine.",A Persistence Detector for Metabolic Network Rewiring in an Animal.,https://www.ncbi.nlm.nih.gov/pubmed/30625328,Cell reports,2019 02 13,"Biological systems must possess mechanisms that prevent inappropriate responses to spurious environmental inputs. Caenorhabditis elegans has two breakdown pathways for the short-chain fatty acid propionate: a canonical, vitamin B12-dependent pathway and a propionate shunt that is used when vitamin B12 levels are low. The shunt pathway is kept off when there is sufficient flux through the canonical pathway, likely to avoid generating shunt-specific toxic intermediates. Here, we discovered a transcriptional regulatory circuit that activates shunt gene expression upon propionate buildup. Nuclear hormone receptor 10 (NHR-10) and NHR-68 function together as a ""persistence detector"" in a type 1, coherent feed-forward loop with an AND-logic gate to delay shunt activation upon propionate accumulation and to avoid spurious shunt activation in response to a non-sustained pulse of propionate. Together, our findings identify a persistence detector in an animal, which transcriptionally rewires propionate metabolism to maintain homeostasis.",Structural Differences between Pri-miRNA Paralogs Promote Alternative Drosha Cleavage and Expand Target Repertoires.,https://www.ncbi.nlm.nih.gov/pubmed/30625327,Cell reports,2019 02 13,"MicroRNA (miRNA) processing begins with Drosha cleavage, the fidelity of which is critical for downstream processing and mature miRNA target specificity. To understand how pri-miRNA sequence and structure influence Drosha cleavage, we studied the maturation of three pri-miR-9 paralogs, which encode the same mature miRNA but differ in the surrounding scaffold. We show that pri-miR-9-1 has a unique Drosha cleavage profile due to its distorted and flexible stem structure. Cleavage of pri-miR-9-1, but not pri-miR-9-2 or pri-miR-9-3, generates an alternative miR-9 with a shifted seed sequence that expands the scope of its target RNAs. Analyses of low-grade glioma patient samples indicate that the alternative-miR-9 has a potential role in tumor progression. Furthermore, we provide evidence that distortion of pri-miRNA stems induced by asymmetric internal loops correlates with Drosha cleavage at non-canonical sites. Our studies reveal that pri-miRNA paralogs can have distinct functions via differential Drosha processing.",Double Lock of a Human Neutralizing and Protective Monoclonal Antibody Targeting the Yellow Fever Virus Envelope.,https://www.ncbi.nlm.nih.gov/pubmed/30625326,Cell reports,2019 01 09,"Yellow fever virus (YFV), a deadly human pathogen, is the prototype of the genus Flavivirus. Recently, YFV re-emerged in Africa and Brazil, leading to hundreds of deaths, with some cases imported to China. Prophylactic or therapeutic countermeasures are urgently needed. Previously, several human monoclonal antibodies against YFV were screened out by phage display. Here, we find that one of them, 5A, exhibits high neutralizing potency and good protection. Crystallographic analysis of the YFV envelope (E) protein in its pre- and post-fusion states shows conformations similar to those observed in other E proteins of flaviviruses. Furthermore, the structures of 5A in complex with the E protein in both states are resolved, revealing an invariant recognition site. Structural analysis and functional data suggest that 5A has high neutralization potency because it interferes with virus entry by preventing both virus attachment and fusion. These findings will be instrumental for immunogen or inhibitor design.",Leishmania Lipophosphoglycan Triggers Caspase-11 and the Non-canonical Activation of the NLRP3 Inflammasome.,https://www.ncbi.nlm.nih.gov/pubmed/30625325,Cell reports,2019 01 09,"Activation of the NLRP3 inflammasome by Leishmania parasites is critical for the outcome of leishmaniasis, a disease that affects millions of people worldwide. We investigate the mechanisms involved in NLRP3 activation and demonstrate that caspase-11 (CASP11) is activated in response to infection by Leishmania species and triggers the non-canonical activation of NLRP3. This process accounts for host resistance to infection in macrophages and in vivo. We identify the parasite membrane glycoconjugate lipophosphoglycan (LPG) as the molecule involved in CASP11 activation. Cytosolic delivery of LPG in macrophages triggers CASP11 activation, and infections performed with Lpg1-/- parasites reduce CASP11/NLRP3 activation. Unlike bacterial LPS, purified LPG does not activate mouse CASP11 (or human Casp4) in vitro, suggesting the participation of additional molecules for LPG-mediated CASP11 activation. Our data identify a parasite molecule involved in CASP11 activation, thereby establishing the mechanisms underlying inflammasome activation in response to Leishmania species.",The Wnt-Driven Mll1 Epigenome Regulates Salivary Gland and Head and Neck Cancer.,https://www.ncbi.nlm.nih.gov/pubmed/30625324,Cell reports,2019 01 09,"We identified a regulatory system that acts downstream of Wnt/β-catenin signaling in salivary gland and head and neck carcinomas.

Null mutations of Mll1 in tumor mice and in xenotransplanted human head and neck tumors resulted in loss of self-renewal of tumor-propagating cells and in block of tumor formation but did not alter normal tissue homeostasis. CRISPR/Cas9 mutagenesis and pharmacological interference of Mll1 at sequences that inhibit essential protein-protein interactions or the SET enzyme active site also blocked the self-renewal of mouse and human tumor-propagating cells. Our work provides strong genetic evidence for a crucial role of Mll1 in solid tumors. Moreover, inhibitors targeting specific Mll1 interactions might offer additional directions for therapies to treat these aggressive tumors.",Derivation of Mouse Haploid Trophoblast Stem Cells.,https://www.ncbi.nlm.nih.gov/pubmed/30625323,Cell reports,2019 01 09,"Trophoblast stem (TS) cells are increasingly used as a model system for studying placentation and placental disorders.

The resulting haTSCs have 20 chromosomes, exhibit typical expression features of TS cells, possess the multipotency to differentiate into specialized trophoblast cell types, and can chimerize E13.5 and term placentas. We also demonstrate the capability of the haTSCs to undergo genetic manipulation and facilitate genome-wide screening in the trophoblast lineage. We expect that haTSCs will offer a powerful tool for studying functional genomics and placental biology."

However, the direct relationship between H3R17/26me and its causal role in mouse embryo development remains largely unclear. Here, we use rAPOBEC1-XTEN-Cas9n-UGI (BE3) to efficiently introduce a point mutation (R17H) at multiple Hist1/2H3 loci and a premature-stop codon into the catalytic domain of CARM1 in mouse embryos, resulting in remarkable downregulation of H3R17me levels and developmental defects in pre-implantation and fetal embryos. Transcriptomic analysis reveals that Yap1 and cell cycle signaling pathways are dysregulated in Carm1 truncation and H3R17H substitution embryos, and Yap1 overexpression could rescue the base-editing-elicited defects.

Although the asymmetric distribution of cortical polarity proteins works in a functioning equilibrium, it also retains plasticity to accommodate cell division, during which the basolateral determinant Lgl is released from the cortex. Here, we investigated how Lgl restores its cortical localization to maintain the integrity of dividing epithelia. We show that cytoplasmic Lgl is reloaded to the cortex at mitotic exit in Drosophila epithelia. Lgl cortical localization depends on protein phosphatase 1, which dephosphorylates Lgl on the serines phosphorylated by aPKC and Aurora A kinases through a mechanism that relies on the regulatory subunit Sds22 and a PP1-interacting RVxF motif of Lgl. This mechanism maintains epithelial polarity and is of particular importance at mitotic exit to couple Lgl cortical reloading with the polarization of the apical domain. Hence, PP1-mediated dephosphorylation of Lgl preserves the apical-basal organization of proliferative epithelia.",Moving beyond GWAS and eQTL Analysis to Validated Hits in Chronic Kidney Disease.,https://www.ncbi.nlm.nih.gov/pubmed/30625310,Cell metabolism,2019 01 09,"Genome-wide association studies (GWAS) have identified multiple chronic kidney disease (CKD)-associated single-nucleotide polymorphisms (SNPs) mainly localized to non-coding genomic regions.

Here, we show that PolD1 shuttles between the nucleus and the cytoplasm. PolD1 harbors two nuclear localization signals that mediate the active transport of PolD1 to the nucleus; conversely, PolD1 is exported from the nucleus by the exportin CRM1-dependent mechanism, a major nuclear-export pathway that mediates the export of various cargos.

Cellular stress is a prerequisite in the development of pancreatic pathologies such as acute pancreatitis (AP).

We studied the effects of insulin and glucose (related to DM) alone and in combination with cerulein (CER)-induced stress (mimicking AP) on ER-stress unfolded protein response (UPR) in pancreatic acinar cells. Exocrine pancreas cells (AR42J) were exposed to high glucose (Glu, 25 mM) and insulin (Ins, 100 nM) levels with or without CER (10 nM). ER-stress UPR activation was analyzed at the transcript, protein, immunocytochemistry, western blotting, quantitative RT-PCR and XBP1 splicing, including; XBP1, sXBP1, ATF6, cleaved ATF6, IRE1-p, CHOP, Caspase-12 and Bax. Exocrine acinar cells exposed to high Ins or Ins+Glu concentrations (but not Glu alone) exhibited ER-stress UPR, demonstrated by significant increase of transcript and protein levels of downstream markers in the ATF6 and IRE1 transduction arms, including: sXBP1, cleaved ATF6, XBP1, CHOP, IRE1-p and caspase-12. UPR activation resulted in IRE1-p aggregation and nuclear trans-localization of cleaved activated ATF6 and sXBP1. Ins further aggravated UPR when cells were co-challenged with CER-induced stress, exacerbating the effects of CER alone. High Ins levels, typical to type-2-DM, activate the ER-stress UPR in pancreatic acinar cells, through the ATF6 and IRE1 pathways. This effect of Ins in naïve acinar cells further augments CER-induced UPR.

Isothermal calorimetry and luminescence assay reveal that the designed XIAP domains can bind strongly with the Smac peptides but do not significantly inhibit the caspase-9 proteolytic activity in vitro compared with the wild-type XIAP protein. Detailed mutation assay experiments suggest that the binding specificity in the designs is essentially determined by the interplay of structural profile and physical interactions, which demonstrates the potential to modify apoptosis pathways through computational design.",Evolution of viviparity in mammals: what genomic imprinting tells us about mammalian placental evolution.,https://www.ncbi.nlm.nih.gov/pubmed/30625287,"Reproduction, fertility, and development",2019 01 09,"Genomic imprinting is an epigenetic mechanism of regulating parent-of-origin-specific monoallelic expression of imprinted genes in viviparous therian mammals such as eutherians and marsupials. In this review we discuss several issues concerning the relationship between mammalian viviparity and genomic imprinting, as well as the domestication of essential placental genes: why has the genomic imprinting mechanism been so widely conserved despite the evident developmental disadvantages originating from monoallelic expression? How have genomic imprinted regions been established in the course of mammalian evolution? What drove the evolution of mammalian viviparity and how have genomic imprinting and domesticated genes contributed to this process? In considering the regulatory mechanism of imprinted genes, reciprocal expression of paternally and maternally expressed genes (PEGs and MEGs respectively) and the presence of several essential imprinted genes for placental formation and maintenance, it is likely that complementary, thereby monoallelic, expression of PEGs and MEGs is an evolutionary trade-off for survival. The innovation in novel imprinted regions was associated with the emergence of imprinting control regions, suggesting that genomic imprinting arose as a genome defence mechanism against the insertion of exogenous DNA. Mammalian viviparity emerged in the period when the atmospheric oxygen concentration was the lowest (~12%) during the last 550 million years (the Phanerozoic eon), implying this low oxygen concentration was a key factor in promoting mammalian viviparity as a response to a major evolutionary pressure. Because genomic imprinting and gene domestication from retrotransposons or retroviruses are effective measures of changing genomic function in therian mammals, they are likely to play critical roles in the emergence of viviparity for longer gestation periods.","Emerging Pharmacological Targets for the Treatment of Nonalcoholic Fatty Liver Disease, Insulin Resistance, and Type 2 Diabetes.",https://www.ncbi.nlm.nih.gov/pubmed/30625285,Annual review of pharmacology and toxicology,2019 01 09,"Type 2 diabetes (T2D) is characterized by persistent hyperglycemia despite hyperinsulinemia, affects more than 400 million people worldwide, and is a major cause of morbidity and mortality.

Estradiol levels decline sharply around the time of follicle formation. In the present study, we hypothesized that FGF10 and FGF18, which inhibit estradiol secretion from granulosa cells of antral follicles, also regulate fetal ovarian steroid production. Fetuses were collected at local abattoirs, and age determined by crown-rump length measurements. Real-time polymerase chain reaction assays with RNA extracted from whole ovaries revealed that the abundance of CYP19A1 messenger RNA (mRNA) decreased from 60 to 90 days of gestation, which is consistent with the decline in estradiol secretion previously observed. Immunohistochemistry revealed the presence of FGF18 in ovigerous cords in early gestation and in oocytes later in fetal age (≥150 days). The abundance of FGF18 mRNA increased after Day 90 gestation. Addition of recombinant FGF18 to fetal ovarian pieces inhibited estradiol and progesterone secretion in vitro, whereas FGF10 was without effect. Consistent with these results, FGF18 decreased levels of mRNA for CYP19A1 and CYP11A1 in ovarian pieces in vitro. These data suggest that FGF18 may be an intraovarian factor that regulates steroidogenesis in fetal ovaries.",Progression of Structural Damage in the Sacroiliac Joints in Patients With Early Axial Spondyloarthritis During Long-Term Anti-Tumor Necrosis Factor Treatment: Six-Year Results of Continuous Treatment With Etanercept.,https://www.ncbi.nlm.nih.gov/pubmed/30625261,"Arthritis & rheumatology (Hoboken, N.J.)",2019 04 25,To evaluate radiographic progression in the sacroiliac (SI) joints and to identify its predictors during long-term treatment (up to 6 years) with the tumor necrosis factor (TNF) inhibitor etanercept in patients with early axial spondyloarthritis (SpA).,Cell-Membrane Penetration of Tat-Conjugated Polymeric Micelles: Effect of Tat Coating Density.,https://www.ncbi.nlm.nih.gov/pubmed/30625260,Macromolecular bioscience,2019 06 02,"Considerable efforts have been devoted to enhancing the cell penetration of nanoparticles by coating cell-penetrating peptides (CPPs) on the surface. However, the internalization mechanism for a CPP at different concentrations varies a lot. It is acknowledged that the mechanism is restricted to endocytic pathway at relatively low concentrations; however, direct translocation becomes dominant at high concentrations. This raises an interesting question on how the surface Tat coating density of the nanoparticles would influence their cell-membrane interaction and the consequent internalization behavior. This study systematically investigates the effect of Tat peptides on the internalization behavior of polymeric micelles by tuning surface Tat coating density, incubation concentrations, incubation time, and other factors using poly(ethylene glycol)-poly(ε-caprolactone) copolymer (PEG-PCL) micelles. It is found that both energy-dependent and energy-independent pathways are involved in the cellular uptake process, and the Tat-conjugated polymeric micelles strongly accumulated on the cell surface at initial stage. The membrane-anchoring and internalization rate increase with the increasing Tat coating density. Furthermore, the increasing of Tat coating density accelerates the energy-independent pathway. It is envisioned that this finding will further shed light on the surface modification of nanoparticles for enhanced cell penetration and direct translocation into cell cytoplasm.",Variable-Temperature Resonance Raman Studies to Probe Interchain Ordering for Semiconducting Conjugated Polymers with Different Chain Curvature.,https://www.ncbi.nlm.nih.gov/pubmed/30625259,"Chemistry, an Asian journal",2019 04 17,"The morphology and crystallinity of the polymers used to fabricate bulk heterojuction (BHJ) solar cells significantly influences the efficiency of the cells. We have used variable-temperature (VT) spectroscopy techniques, namely VT emission and VT resonance Raman spectroscopy (VT-RRS), to examine how the backbone linearity of a conducting polymer affects its electronic response to temperature and variations in solution behavior. We have studied two types of donor-acceptor polymers used in BHJ cells with differing backbone structures; they are poly-{5,6-bis(tetradecyloxy)-4-(thiophen-2-yl)benzo[c]-1,2,5-thiadiazole} (PTBT) which has a curved backbone and poly-{5,6-bis(tetradecyloxy)-4-(thieno[3,2-b]-thiophen-2-yl)benzo[c]-1,2,5-thiadiazole} (PTTBT) which has a linear chain structure. Time-dependent density functional theory (TD-DFT) calculations and resonance Raman spectra (RRS) of PTTBT revealed the presence of three electronic transitions, with character that varies between π to π*, mixed π to π*/charge transfer and pure charge transfer in nature. Emission spectra of PTTBT showed spectral changes at 650 and 710 nm with varied temperature (-10 to 60 °C). Variable-temperature RRS was measured in resonance with the lowest and highest energy electronic transitions. The changes were interpreted using two-dimensional correlation spectroscopy (2DCOS) analysis. PTTBT showed gradual shifts to lower wavenumbers of modes at around 1425, 1450 and 1500 cm-1 . For PTBT larger and more rapid spectral changes are observed at 1440 and 1460 cm-1 consistent with greater variation in the electronic nature upon heating. Further study into the influence of polymer linearity on crystallinity and long range order was carried out using low-frequency Raman (LFR) to examine drop cast films under a variety of different conditions. LFR spectra showed that PTTBT has a band at 73 cm-1 . This is observed under a variety of film-forming conditions. PTBT does not show distinct low frequency modes, consistent with its low crystallinity.",Chronic opioid use after coronary bypass surgery.,https://www.ncbi.nlm.nih.gov/pubmed/30625257,Journal of cardiac surgery,2019 03 28,Opioid dependence has become a major health care issue.

Without crossover formation, faithful meiotic chromosome segregation and sexual reproduction cannot occur. Crossover formation is initiated by the programmed, meiosis-specific introduction of numerous DNA double-strand breaks, after which specific repair pathways promote recombination between homologous chromosomes. Despite its crucial nature, meiotic recombination is fraud with danger: When positioned or repaired inappropriately, DNA breaks can have catastrophic consequences on genome stability of the resulting gametes. As such, DNA break formation and repair needs to be carefully controlled. Within centromeres and surrounding regions (i.e., pericentromeres), meiotic crossover recombination is repressed in organisms ranging from yeast to humans, and a failure to do so is implicated in chromosome missegregation and developmental aneuploidy. (Peri)centromere sequence identity and organization diverge considerably across eukaryotes, yet suppression of meiotic DNA break formation and repair appear universal. Here, we discuss emerging work that has used budding and fission yeast systems to study the mechanisms underlying pericentromeric suppression of DNA break formation and repair. We particularly highlight a role for the kinetochore, a universally conserved, centromere-associated structure essential for chromosome segregation, in suppressing (peri)centromeric DNA break formation and repair. We discuss the current understanding of kinetochore-associated and chromosomal factors involved in this regulation and suggest future avenues of research."

There is little evidence of resistance to plant allelochemicals; it is likely that their efficacy varies between genetically diverse populations, which may lead to the development of resistance in the future. This study evaluated the response of Anopheles gambiae (larvae and adults) from spatially different populations to acetone extracts of two botanicals, Piper guineense and Eugenia aromatica. Mosquito samples from 10 locations within Akure metropolis in Southwest Nigeria were tested for variation in susceptibility to the toxic effect of botanical extracts. The spatial distribution of the tolerance magnitude (T.M.) of the mosquito populations to the botanicals was also mapped. The populations of An. gambiae manifested significant differences in their level of tolerance to the botanicals. The centre of the metropolis was the hot spot of tolerance to the botanicals. There was a significant positive correlation between the adulticidal activities of both botanicals and initial knockdown. Hence, knockdown by these botanicals could be a predictor of their subsequent mortality. In revealing variation in response to botanical pesticides, our work has demonstrated that any future use of botanicals as alternative environmentally friendly vector control chemicals needs to be closely monitored to ensure that resistance does not develop.","Accurate, robust and harmonized implementation of morpho-functional imaging in treatment planning for personalized radiotherapy.",https://www.ncbi.nlm.nih.gov/pubmed/30625230,PloS one,2019 01 20,"In this work we present a methodology able to use harmonized PET/CT imaging in dose painting by number (DPBN) approach by means of a robust and accurate treatment planning system. Image processing and treatment planning were performed by using a Matlab-based platform, called CARMEN, in which a full Monte Carlo simulation is included. Linear programming formulation was developed for a voxel-by-voxel robust optimization and a specific direct aperture optimization was designed for an efficient adaptive radiotherapy implementation. DPBN approach with our methodology was tested to reduce the uncertainties associated with both, the absolute value and the relative value of the information in the functional image. For the same H&N case, a single robust treatment was planned for dose prescription maps corresponding to standardized uptake value distributions from two different image reconstruction protocols: One to fulfill EARL accreditation for harmonization of [18F]FDG PET/CT image, and the other one to use the highest available spatial resolution. Also, a robust treatment was planned to fulfill dose prescription maps corresponding to both approaches, the dose painting by contour based on volumes and our voxel-by-voxel DPBN. Adaptive planning was also carried out to check the suitability of our proposal. Different plans showed robustness to cover a range of scenarios for implementation of harmonizing strategies by using the highest available resolution. Also, robustness associated to discretization level of dose prescription according to the use of contours or numbers was achieved. All plans showed excellent quality index histogram and quality factors below 2%. Efficient solution for adaptive radiotherapy based directly on changes in functional image was obtained. We proved that by using voxel-by-voxel DPBN approach it is possible to overcome typical drawbacks linked to PET/CT images, providing to the clinical specialist confidence enough for routinely implementation of functional imaging for personalized radiotherapy.",Recruitment of Vps34 PI3K and enrichment of PI3P phosphoinositide in the viral replication compartment is crucial for replication of a positive-strand RNA virus.,https://www.ncbi.nlm.nih.gov/pubmed/30625229,PLoS pathogens,2019 03 18,"Tombusviruses depend on subversions of multiple host factors and retarget cellular pathways to support viral replication. In this work, we demonstrate that tomato bushy stunt virus (TBSV) and the closely-related carnation Italian ringspot virus (CIRV) recruit the cellular Vps34 phosphatidylinositol 3-kinase (PI3K) into the large viral replication compartment. The kinase function of Vps34 is critical for TBSV replication, suggesting that PI(3)P phosphoinositide is utilized by TBSV for building of the replication compartment. We also observed increased expression of Vps34 and the higher abundance of PI(3)P in the presence of the tombusviral replication proteins, which likely leads to more efficient tombusvirus replication. Accordingly, overexpression of PI(3)P phosphatase in yeast or plants inhibited TBSV replication on the peroxisomal membranes and CIRV replication on the mitochondrial membranes. Moreover, the purified PI(3)P phosphatase reduced TBSV replicase assembly in a cell-free system. Detection of PI(3)P with antibody or a bioprobe revealed the enrichment of PI(3)P in the replication compartment. Vps34 is directly recruited into the replication compartment through interaction with p33 replication protein. Gene deletion analysis in surrogate yeast host unraveled that TBSV replication requires the vesicle transport function of Vps34. In the absence of Vps34, TBSV cannot efficiently recruit the Rab5-positive early endosomes, which provide PE-rich membranes for membrane biogenesis of the TBSV replication compartment. We found that Vps34 and PI(3)P needed for the stability of the p33 replication protein, which is degraded by the 26S proteasome when PI(3)P abundance was decreased by an inhibitor of Vps34. In summary, Vps34 and PI(3)P are needed for providing the optimal microenvironment for the replication of the peroxisomal TBSV and the mitochondrial CIRV.",A high-throughput screen to identify novel small molecule inhibitors of the Werner Syndrome Helicase-Nuclease (WRN).,https://www.ncbi.nlm.nih.gov/pubmed/30625228,PloS one,2019 01 20,"Werner syndrome (WS), an autosomal recessive genetic disorder, displays accelerated clinical symptoms of aging leading to a mean lifespan less than 50 years. The WS helicase-nuclease (WRN) is involved in many important pathways including DNA replication, recombination and repair. Replicating cells are dependent on helicase activity, leading to the pursuit of human helicases as potential therapeutic targets for cancer treatment. Small molecule inhibitors of DNA helicases can be used to induce synthetic lethality, which attempts to target helicase-dependent compensatory DNA repair pathways in tumor cells that are already genetically deficient in a specific pathway of DNA repair. Alternatively, helicase inhibitors may be useful as tools to study the specialized roles of helicases in replication and DNA repair. In this study, approximately 350,000 small molecules were screened based on their ability to inhibit duplex DNA unwinding by a catalytically active WRN helicase domain fragment in a high-throughput fluorometric assay to discover new non-covalent small molecule inhibitors of the WRN helicase. Select compounds were screened to exclude ones that inhibited DNA unwinding by other helicases in the screen, bound non-specifically to DNA, acted as irreversible inhibitors, or possessed unfavorable chemical properties. Several compounds were tested for their ability to impair proliferation of cultured tumor cells. We observed that two of the newly identified WRN helicase inhibitors inhibited proliferation of cancer cells in a lineage-dependent manner. These studies represent the first high-throughput screen for WRN helicase inhibitors and the results have implications for anti-cancer strategies targeting WRN in different cancer cells and genetic backgrounds."

Comparisons between population-normalized geographic regions of Germany show different serotype distributions after program implementation, particularly in non-vaccine serotypes. The prior distinct differences in serotype distribution in children between the former East and former West German federal states have vanished. Children under six remain a vulnerable group, but the occurrence of vaccine-type (VT) invasive pneumococcal disease (IPD) in children correctly vaccinated (using a three-dose primary series plus one booster dose) with PCV13 was low (9 out of 374 cases, 2.4%). However, only 18.4% of children in Germany with IPD were correctly vaccinated with PCV13 according to the recommended schedule.

Therefore, a long-term negative effect is expected on the vegetation, with increasing drought and areas burnt by fires. The strawberry tree (Arbutus unedo L.) is particularly used in Portugal to produce a spirit by processing its fruits and is the main income for forestry owners. Other applications are possible due to the fruit and leaves' anti-oxidant properties and bioactive compounds production, with a potential for clinical and food uses. It is a sclerophyllous plant, dry-adapted and fire resistant, enduring the Mediterranean climate, and recently considered as a possibility for afforestation, to intensify forest discontinuity where pines and eucalypts monoculture dominate the region. To improve our knowledge about the species' spatial distribution we used 318 plots (the centroid of a 1 km2 square grid) measuring the species presence and nine environmental attributes. The seven bioclimatic variables most impacting on the species distribution and two topographic features, slope and altitude, were used. The past, current and future climate data were obtained through WorldClim. Finally, the vulnerability of the strawberry tree to the effects of global climate change was examined in the face of two emission scenarios (RCP 4.5 and 8.5), to predict distribution changes in the years 2050 and 2070, using a species distribution models (MaxEnt). The reduction of suitable habitat for this species is significant in the southern regions, considering the future scenarios of global warming. Central and northern mountainous regions are putative predicted refuges for this species. Forest policy and management should reflect the impact of climate change on the usable areas for forestry, particularly considering species adapted to the Mediterranean regions and wildfires, such as the strawberry tree. The distribution of the species in the Last Glacial Maximum (LGM) and Mid-Holocene (MH) agrees with previous genetic and paleontological studies in the region, which support putative refuges for the species. Two in the southern and coastal-central regions, since the LGM, and one in the east-central mountainous region, considered as cryptic refugia.","Efficacy, safety, and resistance profile of osimertinib in T790M mutation-positive non-small cell lung cancer in real-world practice.",https://www.ncbi.nlm.nih.gov/pubmed/30625213,PloS one,2019 01 20,"The efficacy and safety of osimertinib were demonstrated in clinical trials; however, real-world clinical data, particularly the resistance profile, are limited. Here, we investigated the efficacy, safety, and resistance profile of osimertinib in real-world practice. We reviewed medical records of T790M mutation-positive lung cancer patients who started osimertinib between February 2016 and June 2017. Molecular pathologic data of biopsy samples obtained after acquisition of resistance to osimertinib were also analyzed. The study included 23 patients with a median age of 59 years. The median follow-up duration was 11.9 months (IQR, 4.7-15.8). Objective response was achieved in 17 (73.9%) patients, and the disease was controlled in 22 (95.7%) patients. Median progression-free survival (PFS) was 7.4 months (95% CI, 3.6-11.0). Adverse events were minimal except for one case of pneumonitis. Of 14 patients experiencing disease progression, 10 underwent re-biopsy. The T790M mutation disappeared in seven patients (70%), and one showed wild-type conversion. PFS was shorter in the T790M-loss group than in the T790M-persistent group (4.4 vs. 7.7 months). Two patients with small cell transformation responded well to subsequent chemotherapy. One patient developed a C797S mutation that became undetectable after two cycles of gemcitabine and cisplatin followed by six cycles of pembrolizumab, after which the patient responded well to osimertinib. In conclusion, osimertinib showed favorable efficacy and safety in real-world practice comparable to those observed in clinical trials.

Neither the long-term tolerability nor the effectiveness of raltegravir or other integrase strand transfer inhibitors in Japan is known. This study reports on the long-term tolerability and effectiveness of raltegravir in Japanese clinical practice using data collected through approximately 9 years of post-marketing surveillance. This observational survey used data on human immunodeficiency virus (HIV) infected patients initiated treatment with raltegravir between 2008 and 2017 in the HIV-related drug (HRD) cooperative survey to assess the safety and effectiveness of raltegravir in real world clinical practice. There were totally 1,303 patients prescribed raltegravir across 30 institutions; 1,293 patients and 1,178 patients were included for the safety and effectiveness analyses, respectively. The overall risk of adverse drug reaction was 17.25%, with abnormal hepatic function and hyperlipidaemia (<1.5%) having the highest proportion. Median HIV-1 RNA viral loads rapidly decreased below 40 copies/mL after 3 months of raltegravir use in treatment-naïve patients, and consistently sustained below 40 copies/mL after the start of raltegravir use in treatment-experienced patients. Among the patients who were treated for 7 years, 92.00% (95% CI: 73.97-99.02) maintained HIV-1 RNA viral load below 50 copies/mL. Additionally, CD4+ cell counts exceeded >500 cells/μL in treatment-naïve and treatment-experienced patients after 3 years and 4 years of treatment, respectively. In Japanese HIV patients, long-term treatment with raltegravir is well-tolerated and effective at viral suppression as measured by HIV-1 RNA levels and subsequent change in CD4+ cell counts.

In the face of predicted large-scale coral degradation over the coming decades, the importance of long-term monitoring of stress-induced ecosystem changes has been widely recognised. In areas where sustained funding is unavailable, citizen science monitoring has the potential to be a powerful alternative to conventional monitoring programmes. In this study we used data collected by volunteers in Southeast Sulawesi (Indonesia), to demonstrate the potential of marine citizen science programmes to provide scientifically sound information necessary for detecting ecosystem changes in areas where no alternative data are available. Data were collected annually between 2002 and 2012 and consisted of percent benthic biotic and abiotic cover and fish counts. Analyses revealed long-term coral reef ecosystem change. We observed a continuous decline of hard coral, which in turn had a significant effect on the associated fishes, at community, family and species levels. We provide evidence of the importance of marine citizen science programmes in detecting long-term ecosystem change as an effective way of delivering conservation data to local government and national agencies. This is particularly true for areas where funding for monitoring is unavailable, resulting in an absence of ecological data. For citizen science data to contribute to ecological monitoring and local decision-making, the data collection protocols need to adhere to sound scientific standards, and protocols for data evaluation need to be available to local stakeholders. Here, we describe the monitoring design, data treatment and statistical analyses to be used as potential guidelines in future marine citizen science projects."

The objective of this study is to quantify the loss of information incurred by using a discrete set of doses to estimate the maximum tolerated dose (MTD) in phase I trials, instead of a continuous dose support. Escalation With Overdose Control and Continuous Reassessment Method were used because they are model-based designs where dose can be specified either as continuous or as a set of discrete levels. Five equally spaced sets of doses with different interval lengths and three sample sizes with sixteen scenarios were evaluated to compare the operating characteristics between continuous and discrete dose designs by Monte Carlo simulation. Loss of information was quantified by safety and efficiency measures. We conclude that if there is insufficient knowledge about the true MTD value, as commonly happens in phase I clinical trials, a continuous dose scheme minimizes information loss. If one is required to implement a design using discrete doses, then a scheme with 9 to 11 doses may yield similar results to the continuous dose scheme.",Rubber and plantain intercropping: Effects of different planting densities on soil characteristics.,https://www.ncbi.nlm.nih.gov/pubmed/30625193,PloS one,2019 01 20,"Two field experiments were conducted at Ellembelle and Jomoro districts in the Western region of Ghana where rubber cultivation is a predominant farming activity. The objective of the study was to assess the effect of rubber and plantain intercropping systems on selected soil properties. The experiment was arranged in a randomized complete block design (RCBD) with 3 replications. The treatments were the sole crop rubber (R), sole crop plantain (P) and three intercrop systems comprising an additive series of plantain: one row of plantain to one row of rubber (PR), two rows of plantain to one row of rubber (PPR) and three rows of plantain to one row of rubber (PPPR). Generally, agroforestry systems improved the soil hydraulic properties considerably, with the highest cumulative infiltration rates of 5.16 and 8.68 cm/min observed under the PPPR systems at the Ellembelle and Jomoro sites, respectively. Microbial biomass C (Cmic), N (Nmic) and P (Pmic) was significantly improved (P < 0.05) under the agroforestry than the monocrop systems. The Cmic, Nmic and Pmic values were highest under the PPPR system at both Ellembelle (Cmic, = 139.9 mg/kg; Nmic = 36.26 mg/kg and Pmic = 87.6 mg/kg) and Jomoro (Cmic = 78.7 mg/kg; Nmic = 80.3 mg/kg and Pmic = 3.45 mg/kg) sites.","Seabird and pinniped shape soil bacterial communities of their settlements in Cape Shirreff, Antarctica.",https://www.ncbi.nlm.nih.gov/pubmed/30625192,PloS one,2019 01 20,"Seabirds and pinnipeds play an important role in biogeochemical cycling by transferring nutrients from aquatic to terrestrial environments. Indeed, soils rich in animal depositions have generally high organic carbon, nitrogen and phosphorus contents. Several studies have assessed bacterial diversity in Antarctic soils influenced by marine animals; however most have been conducted in areas with significant human impact. Thus, we chose Cape Shirreff, Livingston Island, an Antarctic Specially Protected Area designated mainly to protect the diversity of marine vertebrate fauna, and selected sampling sites with different types of animals coexisting in a relatively small space, and where human presence and impact are negligible. Using 16S rRNA gene analyses through massive sequencing, we assessed the influence of animal concentrations, via their modification of edaphic characteristics, on soil bacterial diversity and composition. The nutrient composition of soils impacted by Antarctic fur seals and kelp gulls was more similar to that of control soils (i.e. soils without visible presence of plants or animals), which may be due to the more active behaviour of these marine animals compared to other species. Conversely, the soils from concentrations of southern elephant seals and penguins showed greater differences in soil nutrients compared to the control. In agreement with this, the bacterial communities of the soils associated with these animals were most different from those of the control soils, with the soils of penguin colonies also possessing the lowest bacterial diversity. However, all the soils influenced by the presence of marine animals were dominated by bacteria belonging to Gammaproteobacteria, particularly those of the genus Rhodanobacter. Therefore, we conclude that the modification of soil nutrient composition by marine vertebrates promotes specific groups of bacteria, which could play an important role in the recycling of nutrients in terrestrial Antarctic ecosystems.",An analysis of network brokerage and geographic location in fifteenth-century AD Northern Iroquoia.,https://www.ncbi.nlm.nih.gov/pubmed/30625191,PloS one,2019 01 20,"Iroquoian villagers living in present-day Jefferson County, New York, at the headwaters of the St. Lawrence River and the east shore of Lake Ontario, played important roles in regional interactions during the fifteenth century AD, as brokers linking populations on the north shore of Lake Ontario with populations in eastern New York. This study employs a social network analysis and least cost path analysis to assess the degree to which geographical location may have facilitated the brokerage positions of site clusters within pan-Iroquoian social networks. The results indicate that location was a significant factor in determining brokerage. In the sixteenth century AD, when Jefferson County was abandoned, measurable increases in social distance between other Iroquoian populations obtained. These results add to our understandings of the dynamic social landscape of fifteenth and sixteenth century AD northern Iroquoia, complementing recent analyses elsewhere of the roles played in regional interaction networks by populations located along geopolitical frontiers.","Clinical indicators for common paediatric conditions: Processes, provenance and products of the CareTrack Kids study.",https://www.ncbi.nlm.nih.gov/pubmed/30625190,PloS one,2019 01 20,"In order to determine the extent to which care delivered to children is appropriate (in line with evidence-based care and/or clinical practice guidelines (CPGs)) in Australia, we developed a set of clinical indicators for 21 common paediatric medical conditions for use across a range of primary, secondary and tertiary healthcare practice facilities.",Pilot study of probiotic/colostrum supplementation on gut function in children with autism and gastrointestinal symptoms.,https://www.ncbi.nlm.nih.gov/pubmed/30625189,PloS one,2019 06 10,"Over half of all children with autism spectrum disorders (ASD) have gastrointestinal (GI) co-morbidities including chronic constipation, diarrhea, and irritable bowel syndrome. The severity of these symptoms has been correlated with the degree of GI microbial dysbiosis. The study objective was to assess tolerability of a probiotic (Bifidobacterium infantis) in combination with a bovine colostrum product (BCP) as a source of prebiotic oligosaccharides and to evaluate GI, microbiome and immune factors in children with ASD and GI co-morbidities. This pilot study is a randomized, double blind, controlled trial of combination treatment (BCP + B. infantis) vs. BCP alone in a cross-over study in children ages 2-11 with ASD and GI co-morbidities (n = 8). This 12-week study included 5 weeks of probiotic-prebiotic supplementation, followed by a two-week washout period, and 5 weeks of prebiotic only supplementation. The primary outcome of tolerability was assessed using validated questionnaires of GI function and atypical behaviors, along with side effects. Results suggest that the combination treatment is well-tolerated in this cohort. The most common side effect was mild gassiness. Some participants on both treatments saw a reduction in the frequency of certain GI symptoms, as well as reduced occurrence of particular aberrant behaviors. Improvement may be explained by a reduction in IL-13 and TNF-α production in some participants. Although limited conclusions can be drawn from this small pilot study, the results support the need for further research into the efficacy of these treatments.","Extra-pulmonary tuberculosis: A retrospective study of patients in Accra, Ghana.",https://www.ncbi.nlm.nih.gov/pubmed/30625188,PloS one,2019 01 20,"Information on extrapulmonary TB (EPTB) patients is limited in many African countries including Ghana.

Flocking species are sensitive to habitat disturbance, but we are only beginning to understand how species-specific responses to habitat disturbance affect interspecific associations in these flocks. Here we demonstrate the effects of human-induced habitat disturbance on flocking species' behavior, demography, and individual condition within a remnant network of temperate deciduous forest patches in Indiana, USA. Specifically, we characterized the following properties of two core species, Carolina chickadees (Poecile carolinensis) and tufted titmice (Baeolophus bicolor), across a secondary-forest disturbance gradient: foraging time budgets, home range size, fat scores, fledgling counts, survival rates, and abundance. We also report fat scores for two satellite species that flock with the core study species: white-breasted nuthatches (Sitta carolinensis) and downy woodpeckers (Dryobates pubescens). Finally, we assess mixed-species flock sizes and composition, in addition to avian predator call rates, across the disturbance gradient. Foraging time budgets and home range size were highest and fat scores were lowest for core species in the most-disturbed site. Fat scores of two satellite species followed the same pattern. Additionally, the number of tufted titmice fledglings and winter survival rate of Carolina chickadees were lowest at the most-disturbed site. These results suggest that core species in the most-disturbed site experienced energetic deficits. Moreover, cumulative calling rate of raptors was lowest at the most-disturbed site, and none of the individual raptor species call rates were higher at the most-disturbed site-suggesting that perception of predation risk does not contribute to these patterns. Surprisingly, the satellites continued associating with mixed species flocks through the breeding season at the most-disturbed site. Total flock size and interspecific association patterns were otherwise consistent across the gradient. The fact that satellites continued to flock with core species during the breeding season suggests foraging niche expansion resulting from mixed-species flocking is important in disturbed sites even beyond the winter season. Our study reveals mechanisms underlying flock composition of birds surviving in remnant forest and links the mechanisms to degradation of foraging habitat. These findings offer important insight into the relative impact potential of forest disturbance on mixed-species flocks in the North Temperate Zone."

Reduced feed intake partially explains some of the consequences of heat stress, but metabolic changes in the mammary tissue and liver associated with milk synthesis have not been thoroughly evaluated. In the current study, changes of protein abundance in the mammary tissue and liver between heat-stressed cows with ad libitum intake and pair-fed thermal neutral cows were investigated using the iTRAQ proteomic approach. Most of the differentially expressed proteins from mammary tissue and liver between heat-stressed and pair-fed cows were involved in Gene Ontology category of protein metabolic process. Pathway analysis indicated that differentially expressed proteins in the mammary tissue were related to pyruvate, glyoxylate and dicarboxylate metabolism pathways, while those in the liver participated in oxidative phosphorylation and antigen processing and presentation pathways. Several heat shock proteins directly interact with each other and were considered as central ""hubs"" in the protein interaction network. These findings provide new insights to understand the turnover of protein biosynthesis pathways within hepatic and mammary tissue that likely contribute to changes in milk composition from heat-stressed cows.",Flows of people in villages and large centres in Bronze Age Italy through strontium and oxygen isotopes.,https://www.ncbi.nlm.nih.gov/pubmed/30625174,PloS one,2019 01 20,"This study investigates to what extent Bronze Age societies in Northern Italy were permeable accepting and integrating non-local individuals, as well as importing a wide range of raw materials, commodities, and ideas from networks spanning continental Europe and the Mediterranean. During the second millennium BC, the communities of Northern Italy engaged in a progressive stabilization of settlements, culminating in the large polities of the end of the Middle/beginning of the Late Bronze Age pivoted around large defended centres (the Terramare). Although a wide range of exotic archaeological materials indicates that the inhabitants of the Po plain increasingly took part in the networks of Continental European and the Eastern Mediterranean, we should not overlook the fact that the dynamics of interaction were also extremely active on local and regional levels. Mobility patterns have been explored for three key-sites, spanning the Early to Late Bronze Age (1900-1100 BC), namely Sant'Eurosia, Casinalbo and Fondo Paviani, through strontium and oxygen isotope analysis on a large sample size (more than 100 individuals). The results, integrated with osteological and archaeological data, document for the first time in this area that movements of people occurred mostly within a territorial radius of 50 km, but also that larger nodes in the settlement system (such as Fondo Paviani) included individuals from more distant areas. This suggests that, from a demographic perspective, the process towards a more complex socio-political system in Bronze Age Northern Italy was triggered by a largely, but not completely, internal process, stemming from the dynamics of intra-polity networks and local/regional power relationships.",Structure and belonging: Pathways to success for underrepresented minority and women PhD students in STEM fields.,https://www.ncbi.nlm.nih.gov/pubmed/30625173,PloS one,2019 01 20,"The advancement of underrepresented minority and women PhD students to elite postdoctoral and faculty positions in the STEM fields continues to lag that of majority males, despite decades of efforts to mitigate bias and increase opportunities for students from diverse backgrounds. In 2015, the National Science Foundation Alliance for Graduate Education and the Professoriate (NSF AGEP) California Alliance (Berkeley, Caltech, Stanford, UCLA) conducted a wide-ranging survey of graduate students across the mathematical, physical, engineering, and computer sciences in order to identify levers to improve the success of PhD students, and, in time, improve diversity in STEM leadership positions, especially the professoriate. The survey data were interpreted via path analysis, a method that identifies significant relationships, both direct and indirect, among various factors and outcomes of interest. We investigated two important outcomes: publication rates, which largely determine a new PhD student's competitiveness in the academic marketplace, and subjective well-being. Women and minority students who perceived that they were well-prepared for their graduate courses and accepted by their colleagues (faculty and fellow students), and who experienced well-articulated and structured PhD programs, were most likely to publish at rates comparable to their male majority peers. Women PhD students experienced significantly higher levels of distress than their male peers, both majority and minority, while both women and minority student distress levels were mitigated by clearly-articulated expectations, perceiving that they were well-prepared for graduate level courses, and feeling accepted by their colleagues. It is unclear whether higher levels of distress in women students is related directly to their experiences in their STEM PhD programs. The findings suggest that mitigating factors that negatively affect diversity should not, in principle, require the investment of large resources, but rather requires attention to the local culture and structure of individual STEM PhD programs.",Calanoid copepod zooplankton density is positively associated with water residence time across the continental United States.,https://www.ncbi.nlm.nih.gov/pubmed/30625172,PloS one,2019 01 20,"Inherent differences between naturally-formed lakes and human-made reservoirs may play an important role in shaping zooplankton community structure. For example, because many reservoirs are created by impounding and managing lotic systems for specific human purposes, zooplankton communities may be affected by factors that are unique to reservoirs, such as shorter water residence times and a reservoir's management regime, compared to natural lakes. However, the environmental factors that structure zooplankton communities in natural lakes vs. reservoirs may vary at the continental scale and remain largely unknown. We analyzed data from the 2007 U.S. Environmental Protection Agency's National Lakes Assessment and the U.S. Army Corps of Engineers' National Inventory of Dams to compare large-bodied crustacean zooplankton communities (defined here as individuals retained by 0.243 mm mesh size) in natural lakes and reservoirs across the continental U.S. using multiple linear regressions and regression tree analyses. We found that large-bodied crustacean zooplankton density was overall higher in natural lakes compared to reservoirs when the effect of latitude was controlled. The difference between waterbody types was driven by calanoid copepods, which were also more likely to be dominant in the >0.243 mm zooplankton community in natural lakes than in reservoirs. Regression tree analyses revealed that water residence time was not a major driver of calanoid copepod density in natural lakes but was one of the most important drivers of calanoid copepod density in reservoirs, which had on average 0.5-year shorter water residence times than natural lakes. Reservoirs managed for purposes that resulted in shorter residence times (e.g., hydroelectric power) had lower zooplankton densities than reservoirs managed for purposes that resulted in longer residence times (e.g., irrigation). Consequently, our results indicate that water residence time may be an important characteristic driving differing large-bodied zooplankton dynamics between reservoirs and natural lakes.",Cooperative predation in the social amoebae Dictyostelium discoideum.,https://www.ncbi.nlm.nih.gov/pubmed/30625171,PloS one,2019 01 20,"The eukaryotic amoeba Dictyostelium discoideum is commonly used to study sociality.

Here we show that Dictyostelium are cooperative predators. Using mutants that grow poorly on Gram-negative bacteria but grow well on Gram-positive bacteria, we show that growth depends on cell-density and on prey type. We also found synergy, by showing that pairwise mixes of different mutants grow well on live Gram-negative bacteria. Moreover, wild-type amoebae produce diffusible factors that facilitate mutant growth and some mutants exploit the wild type in mixed cultures.

An enriched source of HuBChE is Cohn fraction IV-4 from pooled human plasma. For the past 40 years, purification of HuBChE has included affinity chromatography on procainamide-Sepharose. The present report supports a new affinity sorbent, Hupresin, for purification of HuBChE from Cohn fraction IV-4. Nine batches of 70-80 kg frozen Cohn fraction were extracted with water, filtered, and chromatographed on 30 L of Q-Ceramic ion exchange sorbent at pH 4.5. The 4% pure Q-eluent was pumped onto 4.2 L Hupresin, where contaminants were washed off with 0.3 M NaCl in 20 mM sodium phosphate pH 8.0, before 99% pure HuBChE was eluted with 0.1 M tetramethylammonium bromide. The average yield was 1.5 g of HuBChE from 80 kg Cohn paste. Recovery of HuBChE was reduced by 90% when the paste was stored at -20°C for 1 year, and reduced 100% when stored at 4°C for 24h. No reduction in HuBChE recovery occurred when paste was stored at -80°C for 3 months or 3 years. Hupresin and procainamide-Sepharose were equally effective at purifying HuBChE from Cohn fraction. HuBChE in Cohn fraction required 1000-fold purification to attain 99% purity, but 15,000-fold purification when the starting material was plasma.

Two scorpion species, Vaejovis smithi and Centruroides limpidus, were found to harbor two different Mollicutes phylotypes: a Scorpion Mycoplasma Clade (SMC) and Scorpion Group 1 (SG1). Here we investigated, using a targeted gene sequencing strategy, whether these Mollicutes were present in 23 scorpion morphospecies belonging to the Vaejovidae, Carboctonidae, Euscorpiidae, Diplocentridae, and Buthidae families. Our results revealed that SMC is found in a species-specific association with Vaejovidae and Buthidae, whereas SG1 is uniquely found in Vaejovidae. SMC and SG1 co-occur only in Vaejovis smithi where 43% of the individuals host both phylotypes. A phylogenetic analysis of Mollicutes 16S rRNA showed that SMC and SG1 constitute well-delineated phylotypes. Additionally, we found that SMC and scorpion phylogenies are significantly congruent, supporting the observation that a cospeciation process may have occurred. This study highlights the phylogenetic diversity of the scorpion associated Mollicutes through different species revealing a possible cospeciation pattern.",Sensory sensitivity and its relationship with adult attachment and parenting styles.,https://www.ncbi.nlm.nih.gov/pubmed/30625166,PloS one,2019 01 20,"Parenting styles vary in levels of both warmth and control, with evidence that type of parenting behavior is linked with social-emotional and other developmental outcomes for children. There are well-established associations between adult attachment and parenting styles. Given emerging evidence that people with different attachment patterns vary in how they receive and modulate sensory information, there are potential implications for parenting which have rarely received research attention. This cross-sectional study investigates the links between parenting style and parental sensory sensitivity, and the possible mediating role of parental sensory sensitivity in the relationship between adult attachment and parenting styles. A convenience sample of 155 parents of children aged 4-12 years old completed an online survey measuring: adult attachment (Experiences in Close Relationships-Modified 16-item Scale), sensory sensitivity (Highly Sensitive Persons Scale-Shortened Version), and parenting styles (Parenting Styles and Dimensions Questionnaire). Correlation, regression and mediation analyses were conducted. Analyses revealed that parents who reported more attachment insecurity also reported higher levels of parental sensory sensitivity, and more authoritarian and/or permissive (non-optimal) parenting styles. Parental sensory sensitivity was found to fully mediate the relationship between attachment avoidance and permissive parenting, and to partially mediate the relationship between attachment anxiety and both authoritarian and permissive parenting. This study represents the first quantitative evidence for associations between parental sensory sensitivity and parenting styles, and the mediating effect of parental sensory sensitivity on the known relationship between attachment insecurity and parenting. Awareness of a parent's level of sensory sensitivity, in addition to his/her attachment style, may assist in developing effective strategies to meet both the parent's and child's needs and support the parent-child relationship."

Groups of three fish with EMG (electromyogram) radio transmitters were monitored for two weeks via video recording. Plasma levels of cortisol, glucose, lactate and lysozyme as well as haematological parameters such as haemoglobin, haematocrit and RBCC (red blood cell count) were measured at the beginning and end of the experiments. Behaviour and muscle activity were monitored daily. The results highlighted that the social hierarchic order was established after one to two days, and it was maintained throughout the experimental period. Dominant and subordinate fish (ß and γ) showed significant differences in muscle activity, hormonal profile (cortisol), aspecific immunity (lysozyme), carbohydrate metabolism (lactate) and behavioural patterns (food order and aggressiveness). This holistic approach helps to provide insights into the physiological status of the subordinate (ß and γ) and dominant individuals.

Women were administered a questionnaire to ascertain risk factors for PPH, defined as a blood loss of 1,000 ml or more assessed using a calibrated under-buttocks drape and collection vessel at childbirth. We analyzed 1,068 transvaginal deliveries of singleton pregnancies. The incidence of PPH was 8.7%, and of severe PPH (1,500 ml blood loss or more) was 2.1%. Risk factors for postpartum hemorrhage among the deliveries were: fetal macrosomia (over 4000 g); pregnancy-induced hypertension; pregnancy generated by assisted reproductive technology; severe vaginal or perineal lacerations; and weight gain over 15 kg during pregnancy. Such high weight gain significantly increased the incidence of PPH compared with women showing less than 10 kg weight gain during pregnancy.

We identified a T-DNA architecture that usually results in stable (i.e. homozygous) mutations in the first generation after transformation.

Differential expression from the two gene copies in diploid cells could potentially contribute, yet our ability to measure from which gene copy individual RNAs originated remains limited, particularly in the context of tissues. Here, we demonstrate quantitative, single molecule allele-specific RNA FISH adapted for use on tissue sections, allowing us to determine the chromosome of origin of individual RNA molecules in formaldehyde-fixed tissues. We used this method to visualize the allele-specific expression of Xist and multiple autosomal genes in mouse kidney. By combining these data with mathematical modeling, we evaluated models for allele-specific heterogeneity, in particular demonstrating that apparent expression from only one of the alleles in single cells can arise as a consequence of low-level mRNA abundance and transcriptional bursting.","Modeling effects of crop production, energy development and conservation-grassland loss on avian habitat.",https://www.ncbi.nlm.nih.gov/pubmed/30625148,PloS one,2019 01 20,"Birds are essential components of most ecosystems and provide many services valued by society. However, many populations have undergone striking declines as their habitats have been lost or degraded by human activities. Terrestrial grasslands are vital habitat for birds in the North American Prairie Pothole Region (PPR), but grassland conversion and fragmentation from agriculture and energy-production activities have destroyed or degraded millions of hectares. Conservation grasslands can provide alternate habitat. In the United States, the Conservation Reserve Program (CRP) is the largest program maintaining conservation grasslands on agricultural lands, but conservation grasslands in the PPR have declined by over 1 million ha since the program's zenith in 2007. We used an ecosystem-services model (InVEST) parameterized for the PPR to quantify grassland-bird habitat remaining in 2014 and to assess the degradation status of the remaining grassland-bird habitat as influenced by crop and energy (i.e., oil, natural gas, and wind) production. We compared our resultant habitat-quality ratings to grassland-bird abundance data from the North American Breeding Bird Survey to confirm that ratings were related to grassland-bird abundance. Of the grassland-bird habitat remaining in 2014, about 19% was degraded by crop production that occurred within 0.1 km of grassland habitats, whereas energy production degraded an additional 16%. We further quantified the changes in availability of grassland-bird habitat under various land-cover scenarios representing incremental losses (10%, 25%, 50%, 75%, and 100%) of CRP grasslands from 2014 levels. Our model identified 1 million ha (9%) of remaining grassland-bird habitat in the PPR that would be lost or degraded if all CRP conservation grasslands were returned to crop production. Grassland regions world-wide face similar challenges in maintaining avian habitat in the face of increasing commodity and energy production to sate the food and energy needs of a growing world population. Identifying ways to model the impacts of the tradeoff between food and energy production and wildlife production is an important step in creating solutions.",Two-dimensional local Fourier image reconstruction via domain decomposition Fourier continuation method.,https://www.ncbi.nlm.nih.gov/pubmed/30625147,PloS one,2019 01 21,"The MRI image is obtained in the spatial domain from the given Fourier coefficients in the frequency domain. It is costly to obtain the high resolution image because it requires higher frequency Fourier data while the lower frequency Fourier data is less costly and effective if the image is smooth. However, the Gibbs ringing, if existent, prevails with the lower frequency Fourier data. We propose an efficient and accurate local reconstruction method with the lower frequency Fourier data that yields sharp image profile near the local edge. The proposed method utilizes only the small number of image data in the local area. Thus the method is efficient. Furthermore the method is accurate because it minimizes the global effects on the reconstruction near the weak edges shown in many other global methods for which all the image data is used for the reconstruction. To utilize the Fourier method locally based on the local non-periodic data, the proposed method is based on the Fourier continuation method. This work is an extension of our previous 1D Fourier domain decomposition method to 2D Fourier data. The proposed method first divides the MRI image in the spatial domain into many subdomains and applies the Fourier continuation method for the smooth periodic extension of the subdomain of interest. Then the proposed method reconstructs the local image based on L2 minimization regularized by the L1 norm of edge sparsity to sharpen the image near edges. Our numerical results suggest that the proposed method should be utilized in dimension-by-dimension manner instead of in a global manner for both the quality of the reconstruction and computational efficiency. The numerical results show that the proposed method is effective when the local reconstruction is sought and that the solution is free of Gibbs oscillations.",Impact of adversity on early childhood growth & development in rural India: Findings from the early life stress sub-study of the SPRING cluster randomised controlled trial (SPRING-ELS).,https://www.ncbi.nlm.nih.gov/pubmed/30625145,PloS one,2019 01 20,"Early childhood development is key to achieving the Sustainable Development Goals and can be negatively influenced by many different adversities including violence in the home, neglect, abuse and parental ill-health.

The model has a five-year concordance index of 0.724 (in comparison, the concordance index is 0.697 for the Estimated Post Transplant Survival model, the state of the art currently in use). It combines predictions from random survival forests with a Cox proportional hazards model. The rankings of importance for the model's variables differ by transplant recipient age.

MATERIAL AND METHODS Serum samples were collected from age-matched healthy control women, and from female CC patients before and after surgery. Serum biomarkers were selected by comparing serum peptides profiles among the 3 groups by magnetic bead-based weak cation - exchange chromatography fractionation combined with matrix-assisted laser desorption/ionization-time of flight mass spectrometry. Probable serum biomarkers for cervical cancer were then further identified by liquid chromatography-electrospray ionization-tandem mass spectrometry system and the identified proteins were verified by enzyme-linked immunosorbent assay (ELISA). RESULTS Three peptide biomarkers were identified for distinguishing CC patients from normal individuals, and distinguishing preoperative CC patients from postoperative CC patients. Of these 3 identified protein peptide regions, 2 peptide regions - TKT (Peak 2, 2435.63 m/z, 499-524) and FGA (Peak 4, 2761.79 m/z, 603-629) - were identified as upregulated markers, and peptide region of APOA1 (Peak 9, 2575.3 m/z, 245-260) was identified as a downregulated biomarker in preoperative CC patients compared with healthy women. CONCLUSIONS The present study provides a new method for identifying potential serum biomarkers for CC patients.","Coping, Mood, Quality of Life, and Outcomes in Recipients of Left Ventricular Assist Devices: A Cluster Analysis.",https://www.ncbi.nlm.nih.gov/pubmed/30625121,Psychosomatic medicine,2019 01 31,Left ventricular assist devices (LVADs) are increasingly used for temporary circulatory support until transplant or as destination therapy for patients with end-stage heart failure.

The E. coli-based PURE (protein synthesis using recombinant elements) system offers the basic protein synthesis factory in a prospective minimal cell relying on extant molecules. However, there is an urgent need to improve the system's performance and to build a mechanistic computational model that can help interpret and predict gene expression dynamics. Herein, we utilized all three commercially available PURE system variants: PURExpress, PUREfrex and PUREfrex2.0. We monitored apparent kinetics of mRNA and protein synthesis by fluorescence spectroscopy at different concentrations of DNA template. Analysis of polysome distributions by atomic force microscopy, combined with a stochastic model of translation, revealed inefficient usage of ribosomes, consistent with the idea that translation initiation is a limiting step. This preliminary dataset was used to formulate hypotheses regarding possible mechanisms impeding robust gene expression. Next, we challenged these hypotheses by devising targeted experiments aimed to alleviate the current limitations of PUREfrex. We identified depletion of key initiation factors (IFs) by translationally inactive mRNA as a possible inhibitory mechanism. This adverse process could partly be remedied by targeted mRNA degradation, whereas addition of more IFs and of the hrpA RNA helicase had no substantial effects. Moreover, the depletion of tRNAs as peptidyl-tRNAs can become limiting in PUREfrex (but not in PURExpress), which can be alleviated by addition of peptidyl-tRNA-hydrolase (PTH). We attempted to build a new model for PURE system dynamics integrating all experimental observations. Although a satisfying global fit can be obtained in specific conditions (with PTH), a unifying system's level model is still missing.",Nrf2 represses the onset of type 1 diabetes in non-obese diabetic mice.,https://www.ncbi.nlm.nih.gov/pubmed/30625116,The Journal of endocrinology,2019 01 18,"The transcription factor Nrf2 (NF-E2-related factor 2) plays a critical role in oxidative stress responses. While activation of Nrf2 signaling is known to exert anti-inflammatory effects, Nrf2 function in inflammation-mediated autoimmune disorders, such as type 1 diabetes, is not well established. To address the roles of Nrf2 in protection against autoreactive T-cell-induced type 1 diabetes, we used non-obese diabetic (NOD) mice, a polygenic model of human type 1 diabetes, to generate a genetic model that allowed us to assess the contribution of Nrf2 activation to preventing and/or treating type 1 diabetes. As Keap1 negatively regulates Nrf2, we used Keap1 gene knockdown driven by either hypomorphic or knockout alleles of Keap1,which enhances Nrf2 signaling to moderate and excess levels, respectively. We found that Nrf2 activation in NOD::Keap1FA/- mice inhibited T-cell infiltration within or near the islets, ameliorated impairment of insulin secretion, and prevented development of diabetes mellitus in the NOD mice. Notably, Nrf2 activation decreased both plasma interferon-γ (IFN-γ) levels and IFN-γ-positive cell numbers in the pancreatic islets. These findings were also observed in mice with two hypomorphic Keap1 alleles (Keap1FA/FA). Both NOD::Keap1FA/- and NOD::Keap1FA/FA mice had decreased incidence of diabetes mellitus, demonstrating that the activation of Nrf2 signaling prevents the onset of type 1 diabetes mellitus in NOD mice. Thus, Nrf2 appears to be a potential target for preventing and treating type 1 diabetes."

Clinically relevant improvement of a number of parameters of metabolism occurred after 3 months of the study (in particular, lowering of levels of total and low-density lipoprotein cholesterol [-8.6 and - 11.4 %, respectively], triglycerides [-12,1 %], fasting blood glucose [-6.6 %]). Thus, results of the PETRA study confirmed 24-hour long antihypertensive efficacy of triple fixed dose combination of perindopril, indapamide, and amlodipine. This drug combination can present novel possibility in treatment of patients with AH who have not achieved target BP values on preceding dual combination therapy and fully corresponds with the single pill concept for formation of adherence to therapy.",,https://www.ncbi.nlm.nih.gov/pubmed/30625077,Kardiologiia,2019 05 20,"This review includes main positions of the revision of diagnostic criteria of ""J-wave syndromes in the J-Wave Syndromes Expert Consensus Conference Report: Emerging Concepts and Gaps in Knowledge"" (2016).

Molecular genetic testing is recommended for the detection of monogenic diseases with a high risk of developing IHD, such as familial hypercholesterolemia. In majority ofyoung patients, the first manifestation of IHD is an acute coronary syndrome. Young patients with IHD more often have normal coronary arteries or single-vessel coronary disease, and in up to 20% of them cause of myocardial ischemia is not related to atherosclerosis. In general, young patients with IHD have better prognosis. However, there are sex differences in IHD outcomes the prognosis of patients with premature IHD and reason for this is still unclear."

Maturation of DS is accompanied by a change in actin architecture from linear to branched filamentous structures. Presumably, the underlying cause of this is a switch in a mode of actin assembly from formin-driven to Arp2/3-mediated via an undefined mechanism. Here we present data suggesting that neuron-specific actin-binding drebrin A may be a part of such a switch. It is well documented that DS are highly enriched in drebrin A, which is critical for their plasticity and function. At the same time, mDia2 is known to mediate the formation of filopodia-type (immature) spines. We found that neuronal drebrin A directly interacts with mDia2 formin. Drebrin inhibits formin-mediated nucleation of actin and abolishes mDia2-induced actin bundling. Using truncated protein constructs we identified the domain requirements for drebrin-mDia2 interaction. We hypothesize that accumulation of drebrin A in DS (that coincides with spine maturation) leads to inhibition of mDia2-driven actin polymerization and, therefore, may contribute to a change in actin architecture from linear to branched filaments.",Overlooked and Invisible: Everyday Experiences of Microaggressions for LGBTQ Adolescents.,https://www.ncbi.nlm.nih.gov/pubmed/30625037,Journal of homosexuality,2019 01 09,"Lesbian, gay, bisexual, transgender, and queer (LGBTQ) adolescents face a number of challenges in their lives related to heterosexism and cissexism.

TorA localizes within the lumen of the nuclear envelope/endoplasmic reticulum and binds to a membrane-spanning cofactor, lamina associated polypeptide 1 (LAP1) or lumenal domain like LAP1 (LULL1), to form an ATPase; the substrate(s) of TorA remains ill-defined. Here we use budding yeast, which lack Torsins, to interrogate TorA function. We show that TorA accumulates at nuclear envelope-embedded spindle pole bodies (SPBs) in a way that requires its oligomerization and the SUN (Sad1 and UNc-84)-domain protein, Mps3. We further show that TorA physically interacts with human SUN1/2 within this system, supporting the physiological relevance of these interactions. Consistent with the idea that TorA acts on a SPB substrate, its binding to SPBs is modulated by the ATPase-stimulating activity of LAP1. TorA and TorA-ΔE reduce the fitness of cells expressing mps3 alleles, whereas TorA alone inhibits growth of cells lacking Pom152, a component of the nuclear pore complex. This genetic specificity is mirrored biochemically as TorA, but not TorA-ΔE, binds Pom152. Thus, TorA-nucleoporin interactions might be abrogated by TorA-ΔE, suggesting new experimental avenues to interrogate the molecular basis behind nuclear envelope herniations seen in mammalian cells lacking TorA function.",Resources Matter: Combined Influence of Job Demands and Job Control on Creative Process Engagement.,https://www.ncbi.nlm.nih.gov/pubmed/30625034,The Journal of psychology,2019 04 30,"Considerable research has been conducted on employee creativity, but it has generally focused on creative outcomes and rarely paid attention to employees' engagement in creative processes, that is, creative process engagement. Further, job characteristics as antecedents are little understood. Drawing on the job demands-resources model and the conservation of resources theory, this study examines the relationship between challenge-hindrance demands and creative process engagement at different levels of job control. In total, 572 questionnaires from China were used to test our proposed model through hierarchical regression analysis. The results show that when job control is high, the effect of challenge demands on creative process engagement is U-shaped, while that of hindrance demands is negative. When job control is low, both challenge and hindrance demands are not related to creative process engagement."
