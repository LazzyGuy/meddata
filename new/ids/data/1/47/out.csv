Successful vaccination against intracellular pathogens requires T cell priming by antigen presenting cells (APCs) that bridge innate and adaptive immunity. However, the evidence on immunological mechanisms that underscore E. ictaluri pathogenesis and the protective role of live attenuated vaccines (LAVs) is scarce. We assessed the expression of immune genes related to antigen presentation by real-time PCR and the distribution patterns of Langerhans-like (L/CD207+) cells by immunohistochemistry in the immune-related tissues of channel catfish challenged with two novel E. ictaluri LAVs, EiΔevpB, and ESC-NDKL1 and wild type (WT) strain. Our results indicated significantly elevated expression of IFN-γ gene in the anterior kidney (AK) and spleen of vaccinated catfish at the early stages of exposure, which correlated with increased numbers of L/CD207+ cells. In general, the ESC-NDKL1-induced IFN-γ gene expression patterns in the AK resembled that of the patterns induced by EiΔevpB. However the MHCII gene expression patterns differed between the strains with significant increases at 6 h post-challenge (pc) with the EiΔevpB and at 7 d pc with the ESC-NDKL1 strains, respectively. Significant increases in activity of T helper type polarization genes such as IFN-γ and T cell co-receptors after exposure to ESC-NDKL1, in combination with elevated numbers of L/CD207+ cells at 7 d pc with both LAVs compared to uninfected and the WT-exposed counterparts, were documented in the spleen. The dominant pro-inflammatory environment with dramatically overexpressed inflammatory genes in the AK and 7 d pc in the spleen in response to E. ictaluri was found in exposed catfish. In general, the pro-inflammatory gene expression profiles in the ESC-NDKL1 pc showed more similarities to the WT strain-induced gene profiles compared to the EiΔevpB counterpart. In addition, E. ictaluri WT significantly decreased the numbers of Langerhans-like L/CD207+ cells in the AK and spleen at 3 and 7 days pc. In conclusion, we report the differential framework of initiation of innate and adaptive immune responses between E. ictaluri strains with both LAVs having a potential of satisfying the stringent requirements for successful vaccines.",Altered Th17/Treg Ratio in Peripheral Blood of Systemic Lupus Erythematosus but Not Primary Antiphospholipid Syndrome.,https://www.ncbi.nlm.nih.gov/pubmed/30894863,Frontiers in immunology,2019 03 29,"Introduction: The role of the immune response in the pathogenesis of antiphospholipid syndrome (APS) remains elusive. It is possible that differences in the frequencies of Th17 cells and/or defects in the immunoregulatory mechanisms are involved in the pathogenesis of APS. Our aim was to determine the peripheral blood Th cells phenotype and the circulating cytokine profile in patients with primary APS (pAPS) and compare it with systemic lupus erythemathosus (SLE) as disease control group. Methods: The frequencies of circulating regulatory T cells (Tregs) were determined in PBMCs from 36 patients with pAPS by flow cytometry. As control groups we included 21 age- and gender-matched healthy controls (HC) and 11 patients with SLE. The suppressive capacity of Tregs was evaluated in vitro by coculture assay. On the other hand, intracellular cytokine production was assessed in Th1, Th2, and Th17 cells and circulating IL-6, IL-10, and IL-35 were measured by Cytometric Bead Array and ELISA. The quantification of Th master gene expression levels was performed by real time quantitative PCR. Results: pAPS patients and SLE patients did not show differences in the percentage or number of Tregs compared to HC. The suppressive capacity of Tregs was also similar in the three study group. Instead, we found higher FoxP3·mRNA expression levels in pAPS patients and HC than SLE patients. Regarding the Th17 response, patients with pAPS and HC showed a significantly lower frequency of circulating Th17 cells than SLE. However, no differences were observed in the Th1 response between patients and controls. Thus, increased Th17/Th1 and Th17/Treg ratios were found in SLE patients but not in pAPS patients. pAPS and SLE patients had higher serum IL-6 levels than HC but there was not difference between both disease groups. Besides, a significant increase in the immunosuppressive cytokine levels was observed only in pAPS as compared to HC. Conclusions: Our data demonstrate an increased inflammatory profile of peripheral blood CD4+ T cells from SLE as compared with pAPS mostly due to an increased Th17 response. In conclusion, there seems not to be a direct pathogenic role for Th cells in pAPS but in SLE.",Chemokines and Chemokine Receptors: New Targets for Cancer Immunotherapy.,https://www.ncbi.nlm.nih.gov/pubmed/30894861,Frontiers in immunology,2019 03 29,"Immunotherapy is a clinically validated treatment for many cancers to boost the immune system against tumor growth and dissemination. Several strategies are used to harness immune cells: monoclonal antibodies against tumor antigens, immune checkpoint inhibitors, vaccination, adoptive cell therapies (e.g., CAR-T cells) and cytokine administration. In the last decades, it is emerging that the chemokine system represents a potential target for immunotherapy. Chemokines, a large family of cytokines with chemotactic activity, and their cognate receptors are expressed by both cancer and stromal cells. Their altered expression in malignancies dictates leukocyte recruitment and activation, angiogenesis, cancer cell proliferation, and metastasis in all the stages of the disease. Here, we review first attempts to inhibit the chemokine system in cancer as a monotherapy or in combination with canonical or immuno-mediated therapies. We also provide recent findings about the role in cancer of atypical chemokine receptors that could become future targets for immunotherapy.",Tolerogenic Role of Myeloid Suppressor Cells in Organ Transplantation.,https://www.ncbi.nlm.nih.gov/pubmed/30894860,Frontiers in immunology,2019 03 29,"Myeloid-derived suppressor cells (MDSC) are a heterogeneous population of immature cells of myeloid origin with a specific immune inhibitory function that negatively regulates the adaptive immune response. Since MDSC participate in the promotion of tolerance in the context of organ transplantation, therapeutic strategies that regulate the induction and development of MDSC have been the center of scientist attention. Here we review literature regarding induction of MDSC with demonstrated suppressive function among different types of allografts and their mechanism of action. While manipulation of MDSC represents a potential therapeutic approach for the promotion of donor specific tolerance in solid organ transplantation, further characterization of their specific phenotype, which distinguishes MDSC from non-suppressive myeloid cells, and detailed evaluation of the inhibitory mechanism that determines their suppressive function, is necessary for the realistic application of MDSC as biomarkers in health and disease and their potential use as immune cell therapy in organ transplantation.",Mechanisms of Immune Control of Mucosal HSV Infection: A Guide to Rational Vaccine Design.,https://www.ncbi.nlm.nih.gov/pubmed/30894859,Frontiers in immunology,2019 03 29,"Herpes Simplex Virus (HSV) is a highly prevalent sexually transmitted infection that aside from causing cold sores and genital lesions, causes complications in the immunocompromised and has facilitated a large proportion of HIV acquisition globally. Despite decades of research, there is no prophylactic HSV vaccine ready for use in humans, leaving many questioning whether a prophylactic vaccine is an achievable goal. A previous HSV vaccine trial did have partial success in decreasing acquisition of HSV2-promising evidence that vaccines can prevent acquisition. However, there is still an incomplete understanding of the immune response pathways elicited by HSV after initial mucosal infection and how best to replicate these responses with a vaccine, such that acquisition and colonization of the dorsal root ganglia could be prevented. Another factor to consider in the rational design of an HSV vaccine is adjuvant choice. Understanding the immune responses elicited by different adjuvants and whether lasting humoral and cell-mediated responses are induced is important, especially when studies of past trial vaccines found that a sufficiently protective cell-mediated response was lacking. In this review, we discuss what is known of the immune control involved in initial herpes lesions and reactivation, including the importance of CD4 and CD8 T cells, and the interplay between innate and adaptive immunity in response to primary infection, specifically focusing on the viral relay involved. Additionally, a summary of previous and current vaccine trials, including the components used, immune responses elicited and the feasibility of prophylactic vaccines looking forward, will also be discussed.",A Soluble Immune Effector Binds Both Fungi and Bacteria via Separate Functional Domains.,https://www.ncbi.nlm.nih.gov/pubmed/30894858,Frontiers in immunology,2019 03 29,"The gut microbiome of animals consists of diverse microorganisms that include both prokaryotes and eukaryotes. Complex interactions occur among these inhabitants, as well as with the immune system of the host, and profoundly influence the overall health of both the host and its microbial symbionts. Despite the enormous importance for the host to regulate its gut microbiome, the extent to which animals generate immune-related molecules with the capacity to directly influence polymicrobial interactions remains unclear. The urochordate, Ciona robusta, is a model organism that has been adapted to experimental studies of host/microbiome interactions. Ciona variable-region containing chitin-binding proteins (VCBPs) are innate immune effectors, composed of immunoglobulin (Ig) variable regions and a chitin-binding domain (CBD) and are expressed in high abundance in the gut. It was previously shown that VCBP-C binds bacteria and influences both phagocytosis by granular amoebocytes and biofilm formation via its Ig domains. We show here that the CBD of VCBP-C independently recognizes chitin molecules present in the cell walls, sporangia (spore-forming bodies), and spores of a diverse set of filamentous fungi isolated from the gut of Ciona. To our knowledge, this is the first description of a secreted Ig-containing immune molecule with the capacity to directly promote transkingdom interactions through simultaneous binding by independent structural domains and could have broad implications in modulating the establishment, succession, and homeostasis of gut microbiomes.","Cross-Talk Between Antigen Presenting Cells and T Cells Impacts Intestinal Homeostasis, Bacterial Infections, and Tumorigenesis.",https://www.ncbi.nlm.nih.gov/pubmed/30894857,Frontiers in immunology,2019 03 29,"Innate immunity is maintained in part by antigen presenting cells (APCs) including dendritic cells, macrophages, and B cells. APCs interact with T cells to link innate and adaptive immune responses. By displaying bacterial and tumorigenic antigens on their surface via major histocompatibility complexes, APCs can directly influence the differentiation of T cells. Likewise, T cell activation, differentiation, and effector functions are modulated by APCs utilizing multiple mechanisms. The objective of this review is to describe how APCs interact with and influence the activation of T cells to maintain innate immunity during exposure to microbial infection and malignant cells. How bacteria and cancer cells take advantage of some of these interactions for their own benefit will also be discussed. While this review will cover a broad range of topics, a general focus will be held around pathogens, cancers, and interactions that typically occur within the gastrointestinal tract.",Naive and Stem Cell Memory T Cell Subset Recovery Reveals Opposing Reconstitution Patterns in CD4 and CD8 T Cells in Chronic Graft vs. Host Disease.,https://www.ncbi.nlm.nih.gov/pubmed/30894856,Frontiers in immunology,2019 03 29,"The success of allogeneic hematopoietic stem cell transplantation (allo-HSCT) in the treatment of hematological malignancies remains hampered by life-threatening chronic graft vs. host disease (cGVHD). Although multifactorial in nature, cGVHD has been associated with imbalances between effector and regulatory T cells (Treg). To further elucidate this issue, we performed a prospective analysis of patients undergoing unrelated donor allo-HSCT after a reduced intensity conditioning (RIC) regimen containing anti-thymocyte globulin (ATG) and the same GVHD prophylaxis, at a single institution. We studied T cell subset homeostasis over a 24-month follow-up after HSCT in a comparative analysis of patients with and without cGVHD. We also quantified naive and memory T cell subsets, proliferation and expression of the apoptosis-related proteins Bcl-2 and CD95. Finally, we assessed thymic function by T cell receptor excision circle (TREC) quantification and T cell receptor (TCR) diversity by TCRVβ spectratyping. While the total number of conventional CD4 (Tcon) and CD8 T cells was similar between patient groups, Treg were decreased in cGVHD patients. Interestingly, we also observed divergent patterns of Naive and Stem Cell Memory (SCM) subset recovery in Treg and Tcon compared to CD8. Patients with cGVHD showed impaired recovery of Naive and SCM Tcon and Treg, but significantly increased frequencies and absolute numbers of Naive and SCM were observed in the CD8 pool. Markedly increased EMRA CD8 T cells were also noted in cGVHD. Taken together, these results suggest that Naive, SCM and EMRA CD8 play a role in the emergence of cGHVD. Reduced Naive and recent thymic emigrant Tcon and Treg in cGVHD was likely due to impaired thymic output, as it was accompanied by decreased CD4 TREC and TCR diversity. On the other hand, CD8 TCR diversity was similar between patient groups. Furthermore, no correlation was observed between CD8 TREC content and Naive CD8 numbers, suggesting limited thymic production of Naive CD8 T cells in patients after transplant, especially in those developing cGVHD. The mechanisms behind the opposing patterns of CD4 and CD8 subset cell recovery in cGVHD remain elusive, but may be linked to thymic damage associated with the conditioning regimen and/or acute GVHD.",Fish Cholesterol 25-Hydroxylase Inhibits Virus Replication via Regulating Interferon Immune Response or Affecting Virus Entry.,https://www.ncbi.nlm.nih.gov/pubmed/30894855,Frontiers in immunology,2019 03 29,"Cholesterol 25-hydroxylase (CH25H) is an interferon (IFN)-induced gene that catalyzes the oxidation of cholesterol to 25-hydroxycholesterol (25HC), which exerts broad-spectrum antiviral function. To investigate the roles of fish CH25H in Singapore grouper iridovirus (SGIV) and red-spotted grouper nervous necrosis virus (RGNNV) infection, we cloned and characterized a CH25H homolog from orange-spotted grouper (Epinephelus coioides) (EcCH25H). EcCH25H encoded a 271-amino-acid polypeptide, with 86 and 59% homology with yellow croaker (Larimichthys crocea) and humans, respectively. EcCH25H contained a conserved fatty acid (FA) hydroxylase domain and an ERG3 domain. EcCH25H expression was induced by RGNNV or SGIV infection, lipopolysaccharide (LPS) or poly (I:C) treatment in vitro. Subcellular localization showed that EcCH25H and mutant EcCH25H-M were distributed in the cytoplasm and partly colocalized with the endoplasmic reticulum. SGIV and RGNNV replication was decreased by EcCH25H overexpression, which was reflected in the reduced severity of the cytopathic effect and a decrease in viral gene transcription, but replication of both viruses was increased by knockdown of EcCH25H. Besides, the antiviral activity was dependent on its enzymatic activity. Treatment with 25HC significantly inhibited replication of SGIV and RGNNV. EcCH25H overexpression positively regulated the IFN-related molecules and proinflammatory cytokines, and increased both IFN and ISRE promoter activities. Moreover, 25HC treatment significantly suppressed SGIV and RGNNV entry into host cells. The similar inhibitory effect on SGIV entry was observed in EcCH25H overexpression cells. Taken together, our findings demonstrated that EcCH25H inhibited SGIV and RGNNV infection by regulating IFN signaling molecules, and might also influence viral entry via an effect on cholesterol.",Differential Elimination of Anti-Thymocyte Globulin of Fresenius and Genzyme Impacts T-Cell Reconstitution After Hematopoietic Stem Cell Transplantation.,https://www.ncbi.nlm.nih.gov/pubmed/30894854,Frontiers in immunology,2019 03 29,"Anti-thymocyte globulin (ATG) is a lymphocyte depleting agent applied in hematopoietic stem cell transplantation (HSCT) to prevent rejection and Graft-vs.-Host Disease (GvHD). In this study, we compared two rabbit ATG products, ATG-Genzyme (ATG-GENZ), and ATG-Fresenius (ATG-FRES), with respect to dosing, clearance of the active lymphocyte binding component, post-HSCT immune reconstitution and clinical outcome. Fifty-eigth pediatric acute leukemia patients (n = 42 ATG-GENZ, n = 16 ATG-FRES), who received a non-depleted bone marrow or peripheral blood stem cell graft from an unrelated donor were included. ATG-GENZ was given at a dosage of 6-10 mg/kg; ATG-FRES at 45-60 mg/kg. The active component of ATG from both products was cleared at different rates. Within the ATG-FRES dose range no differences were found in clearance of active ATG or T-cell re-appearance. However, the high dosage of ATG-GENZ (10 mg/kg), in contrast to the low dosage (6-8 mg/kg), correlated with prolonged persistence of active ATG and delayed T-cell reconstitution. Occurrence of serious acute GvHD (grade III-IV) was highest in the ATG-GENZ-low dosage group. These results imply that dosing of ATG-GENZ is more critical than dosing of ATG-FRES due to the difference in clearance of active ATG. This should be taken into account when designing clinical protocols."

The endonuclease active site in the N-terminal region, the basic amino acid cluster in the C-terminal PA-X-specific region, and N-terminal acetylation of PA-X by NatB are important for the shutoff activity of PA-X. Here, we focused on the shutoff activity of PA-X derived from the A/California/04/2009 and A/WSN/33 viruses because these two PA-X proteins differ in their shutoff activity. Mutagenesis analysis revealed that proline and serine at positions 28 and 65, respectively, play a central role in this difference. Furthermore, we found that P28 and S65 also affect the shutoff activity of PA-X derived from other influenza virus subtypes. These data demonstrate that P28 and S65 contribute to enhanced shutoff activity of PA-X.",Shear Stress Affects Biofilm Structure and Consequently Current Generation of Bioanode in Microbial Electrochemical Systems (MESs).,https://www.ncbi.nlm.nih.gov/pubmed/30894842,Frontiers in microbiology,2019 03 29,"Shear stress is an important factor that affects the formation and structure of anode biofilms, which are strongly related to the extracellular electron transfer phenomena and bioelectric performance of bioanodes. Here, we show that using nitrogen sparging to induce shear stress during anode biofilm formation increases the linear sweep voltammetry peak current density of the mature anode biofilm from 2.37 ± 0.15 to 4.05 ± 0.25 A/m2. Electrochemical impedance spectroscopy results revealed that the shear-stress-enriched anode biofilm had a low charge transfer resistance of 46.34 Ω compared to that of the unperturbed enriched anode biofilm (72.2 Ω). Confocal laser scanning microscopy observations showed that the shear-stress-enriched biofilms were entirely viable, whereas the unperturbed enriched anode biofilm consisted of a live outer layer covering a dead inner-core layer. Based on biomass and community analyses, the shear-stress-enriched biofilm had four times the biofilm density (136.0 vs. 27.50 μg DNA/cm3) and twice the relative abundance of Geobacteraceae (over 80 vs. 40%) in comparison with those of the unperturbed enriched anode biofilm. These results show that applying high shear stress during anode biofilm enrichment can result in an entirely viable and dense biofilm with a high relative abundance of exoelectrogens and, consequently, better performance.",Tetracycline Gene Transfer in Staphylococcus xylosus in situ During Sausage Fermentation.,https://www.ncbi.nlm.nih.gov/pubmed/30894841,Frontiers in microbiology,2019 03 29,"The presence of determinants of resistance to antibiotics can constitute a possible safety hazard in coagulase-negative staphylococci (CNS), which are widely present in food of animal origin. Among CNS, S. xylosus is a species frequently isolated from fermented meat products. Resistance to tetracycline was found to be one of the most distributed resistances occurring in S. xylosus strains isolated from fermented sausages. We evaluated the transfer of tetracycline resistance in vitro and in situ between S. xylosus strains. We selected three strains isolated from dry fermented sausages, resistant to tetracycline but not to minocycline, their resistance occurring by a mechanism of active efflux encoded by the tetK gene. Only one strain was able to transfer its tetracycline resistance to a recipient strain initially susceptible and plasmid-free using a filter mating procedure. Transfer of tetracycline resistance was observed at very low frequencies of 3.4 × 10-9 per recipient. To further investigate the transferability of this tetracycline resistance, the donor and recipient strains were tested in pilot-scale fermented sausage production. This transfer was possible but at a low rate, 1.4 × 10-7, and only under conditions of a high inoculation level of 108 CFU/g of meat. The tetK gene is located on a small mobilizable plasmid close to Staphylococcus aureus pT181 plasmid. In conclusion, the transfer of tetracycline resistance between strains of S. xylosus is possible, but at a really low frequency in vitro and in situ in fermented sausages. Even if this represents a very moderate risk, it should be taken into account as required by the European approach of Qualified Presumption of Safety (QPS) and AFSSA safety recommendations, advising that strains used as starter cultures should not carry any transferable antibiotic resistance.",High-Throughput Proteomics Identifies Proteins With Importance to Postantibiotic Recovery in Depolarized Persister Cells.,https://www.ncbi.nlm.nih.gov/pubmed/30894840,Frontiers in microbiology,2019 03 29,"Bacterial populations produce phenotypic variants called persisters to survive harmful conditions. Persisters are highly tolerant to antibiotics and repopulate environments after the stress has vanished. In order to resume growth, persisters have to recover from the persistent state, but the processes behind recovery remain mostly elusive. Deciphering these processes is an essential step toward understanding the persister phenomenon in its entirety. High-throughput proteomics by mass spectrometry is a valuable tool to assess persister physiology during any stage of the persister life cycle, and is expected to considerably contribute to our understanding of the recovery process. In the present study, an Escherichia coli strain, that overproduces the membrane-depolarizing toxin TisB, was established as a model for persistence by the use of high-throughput proteomics. Labeling of TisB persisters with stable isotope-containing amino acids (pulsed-SILAC) revealed an active translational response to ampicillin, including several RpoS-dependent proteins. Subsequent investigation of the persister proteome during postantibiotic recovery by label-free quantitative proteomics identified proteins with importance to the recovery process. Among them, AhpF, a component of alkyl hydroperoxide reductase, and the outer membrane porin OmpF were found to affect the persistence time of TisB persisters. Assessing the role of AhpF and OmpF in TisB-independent persisters demonstrated that the importance of a particular protein for the recovery process strongly depends on the physiological condition of a persister cell. Our study provides important insights into persister physiology and the processes behind recovery of depolarized cells.",Validation of a Bioinformatics Workflow for Routine Analysis of Whole-Genome Sequencing Data and Related Challenges for Pathogen Typing in a European National Reference Center: Neisseria meningitidis as a Proof-of-Concept.,https://www.ncbi.nlm.nih.gov/pubmed/30894839,Frontiers in microbiology,2019 03 29,"Despite being a well-established research method, the use of whole-genome sequencing (WGS) for routine molecular typing and pathogen characterization remains a substantial challenge due to the required bioinformatics resources and/or expertise. Moreover, many national reference laboratories and centers, as well as other laboratories working under a quality system, require extensive validation to demonstrate that employed methods are ""fit-for-purpose"" and provide high-quality results. A harmonized framework with guidelines for the validation of WGS workflows does currently, however, not exist yet, despite several recent case studies highlighting the urgent need thereof. We present a validation strategy focusing specifically on the exhaustive characterization of the bioinformatics analysis of a WGS workflow designed to replace conventionally employed molecular typing methods for microbial isolates in a representative small-scale laboratory, using the pathogen Neisseria meningitidis as a proof-of-concept. We adapted several classically employed performance metrics specifically toward three different bioinformatics assays: resistance gene characterization (based on the ARG-ANNOT, ResFinder, CARD, and NDARO databases), several commonly employed typing schemas (including, among others, core genome multilocus sequence typing), and serogroup determination. We analyzed a core validation dataset of 67 well-characterized samples typed by means of classical genotypic and/or phenotypic methods that were sequenced in-house, allowing to evaluate repeatability, reproducibility, accuracy, precision, sensitivity, and specificity of the different bioinformatics assays. We also analyzed an extended validation dataset composed of publicly available WGS data for 64 samples by comparing results of the different bioinformatics assays against results obtained from commonly used bioinformatics tools. We demonstrate high performance, with values for all performance metrics >87%, >97%, and >90% for the resistance gene characterization, sequence typing, and serogroup determination assays, respectively, for both validation datasets. Our WGS workflow has been made publicly available as a ""push-button"" pipeline for Illumina data at https://galaxy.sciensano.be to showcase its implementation for non-profit and/or academic usage. Our validation strategy can be adapted to other WGS workflows for other pathogens of interest and demonstrates the added value and feasibility of employing WGS with the aim of being integrated into routine use in an applied public health setting.",Characterization of a Species-Specific Insulinase-Like Protease in Cryptosporidium parvum.,https://www.ncbi.nlm.nih.gov/pubmed/30894838,Frontiers in microbiology,2019 03 29,"Cryptosporidium parvum is an intracellular protozoan that can cause severe diarrhea in humans and various mammals. Results of a comparative genomic analysis indicated that genes encoding two C. parvum-specific insulinase-like proteases (INS19 and INS20), cgd6_5510 and cgd6_5520, are lost in many Cryptosporidium species. In this study, we provided evidence indicating that cgd6_5510 and cgd6_5520 are fragments of a full gene (cgd6_5520-5510) encoding one insulinase-like protease (INS20-19) that is similar in structure to classic insulinases. We expressed cgd6_5510 in Escherichia coli for antiserum preparation and found the protein (INS19) that was partially degraded. A ~180 kDa protein of INS20-19 was specifically recognized by the polyclonal anti-INS19 antiserum in sporozoite lysate. We observed that INS20-19 is likely a protein with high expression in the apical region of sporozoites, and neutralization of the protein led to a partial reduction of parasite load in HCT-8 and MDBK cell cultures at 24 h. Taken together, our findings support the involvement of INS20-19 in the invasion or early developmental process of C. parvum.",Wolbachia Horizontal Transmission Events in Ants: What Do We Know and What Can We Learn?,https://www.ncbi.nlm.nih.gov/pubmed/30894837,Frontiers in microbiology,2019 03 29,"While strict vertical transmission insures the durability of intracellular symbioses, phylogenetic incongruences between hosts and endosymbionts suggest horizontal transmission must also occur. These horizontal acquisitions can have important implications for the biology of the host. Wolbachia is one of the most ecologically successful prokaryotes in arthropods, infecting an estimated 50-70% of all insect species. Much of this success is likely due to the fact that, in arthropods, Wolbachia is notorious for manipulating host reproduction to favor transmission through the female germline. However, its natural potential for horizontal transmission remains poorly understood. Here we evaluate the fundamental prerequisites for successful horizontal transfer, including necessary environmental conditions, genetic potential of bacterial strains, and means of mediating transfers. Furthermore, we revisit the relatedness of Wolbachia strains infecting the Panamanian leaf-cutting ant, Acromyrmex echinatior, and its inquiline social parasite, Acromyrmex insinuator, and compare our results to a study published more than 15 years ago by Van Borm et al. (2003). The results of this pilot study prompt us to reevaluate previous notions that obligate social parasitism reliably facilitates horizontal transfer and suggest that not all Wolbachia strains associated with ants have the same genetic potential for horizontal transmission.",Palliative Care for Stroke Patients and Their Families: Barriers for Implementation.,https://www.ncbi.nlm.nih.gov/pubmed/30894836,Frontiers in neurology,2019 03 29,"Stroke is a leading cause of death, disability and is a symptom burden worldwide. It impacts patients and their families in various ways, including physical, emotional, social, and spiritual aspects. As stroke is potentially lethal and causes severe symptom burden, a palliative care (PC) approach is indicated in accordance with the definition of PC published by the WHO in 2002. Stroke patients can benefit from a structured approach to palliative care needs (PCN) and the amelioration of symptom burden. Stroke outcome is uncertain and outlook may change rapidly. Regarding these challenges, core competencies of PC include the critical appraisal of various treatment options, and openly and respectfully discussing therapeutic goals with patients, families, and caregivers. Nevertheless, PC in stroke has to date mainly been restricted to short care periods for dying patients after life-limiting complications. There is currently no integrated concept for PC in stroke care addressing the appropriate moment to initiate PC for stroke patients, and the question of how to screen for symptoms remains unanswered. Therefore, PC for stroke patients is often perceived as a stopgap in cases of unfavorable prognosis and very short survival times. In contrast, PC can provide much more for stroke patients and support a holistic approach, improve quality of life and ensure treatment according to the patient's wishes and values. In this short review we identify key aspects of PC in stroke care and current barriers to implementation. Additionally, we provide insights into our approach to PC in stroke care.",Reciprocal Relationships Between Moral Competence and Externalizing Behavior in Junior Secondary Students: A Longitudinal Study in Hong Kong.,https://www.ncbi.nlm.nih.gov/pubmed/30894835,Frontiers in psychology,2019 03 29,"Defining moral competence using a virtue approach, this longitudinal study examined the prospective relationships between moral competence and externalizing behavior indexed by delinquency and intention to engage in problem behavior in a large and representative sample of Hong Kong Chinese adolescents. Starting from the 2009-2010 academic year, Grade 7 students in 28 randomly selected secondary schools in Hong Kong were invited to join a longitudinal study, which surveyed participating students annually during the high school years. The current study used data collected in the first 3 years (Wave 1 to Wave 3) across junior secondary school stage (Grades 7-9) with a sample of 3,328 students (Age = 12.59 ± 0.74 years and 52.1% boys at Wave 1). Cross-lagged panel path analyses were conducted to compare four models involving different hypothesized patterns of relationships between moral competence and externalizing behavior. Results revealed that the reciprocal effects model best fit the data, supporting reciprocal causal relationships between moral competence and externalizing behavior measures. Specifically, a higher level of moral competence significantly predicted a lower level of delinquency and problem behavioral intention over time. At the same time, a higher level of externalizing behavior also significantly predicted a lower level of moral competence 1 year later. As the magnitudes of the significant findings were not high, replications in different Chinese communities are needed. Nevertheless, the present findings provide important theoretical insights on how moral competence and externalizing behavior in adolescents are associated with each other. Practically speaking, the findings suggest that it is promising to reduce adolescent externalizing behavior by promoting their virtues through moral education programs, and guiding adolescents to behave in a good manner would help promote the development of their virtues.",Perceived Duration: The Interplay of Top-Down Attention and Task-Relevant Information.,https://www.ncbi.nlm.nih.gov/pubmed/30894834,Frontiers in psychology,2019 03 29,"Perception of time is susceptible to distortions; among other factors, it has been suggested that the perceived duration of a stimulus is affected by the observer's expectations. It has been hypothesized that the duration of an oddball stimulus is overestimated because it is unexpected, whereas repeated stimuli have a shorter perceived duration because they are expected. However, recent findings suggest instead that fulfilled expectations about a stimulus elicit an increase in perceived duration, and that the oddball effect occurs because the oddball is a target stimulus, not because it is unexpected. Therefore, it has been suggested that top-down attention is sometimes sufficient to explain this effect, and sometimes only necessary, with an additional contribution from saliency. However, how the expectedness of a target stimulus and its salient features affect its perceived duration is still an open question. In the present study, participants' expectations about and the saliency of target stimuli were orthogonally manipulated with stimuli presented on a short (Experiment 1) or long (Experiment 2) temporal scale. Four repetitive standard stimuli preceded each target stimulus in a task in which participants judged whether the target was longer or shorter in duration than the standards. Engagement of top-down attention to target stimuli increased their perceived duration to the same extent irrespective of their expectedness. A small but significant additional contribution to this effect from the saliency of target stimuli was dependent on the temporal scale of stimulus presentation. In Experiment 1, saliency only significantly increased perceived duration in the case of expected target stimuli. In contrast, in Experiment 2, saliency exerted a significant effect on the overestimation elicited by unexpected target stimuli, but the contribution of this variable was eliminated in the case of expected target stimuli. These findings point to top-down attention as the primary cognitive mechanism underlying the perceptual extraction and processing of task-relevant information, which may be strongly correlated with perceived duration. Furthermore, the scalar properties of timing were observed, favoring the pacemaker-accumulator model of timing as the underlying timing mechanism."

Mindfulness-Based Positive Behavior Support (MBPBS) is a customized mindfulness program that enables parents and other caregivers to reduce their perceived psychological stress to normative levels through mindfulness procedures and to support children with ASD or ID to self-manage their challenging behaviors through positive behavior support (PBS). In this study, we evaluated whether MBPBS would have differential effects on the stress levels of mothers of adolescents with ASD (n = 47) or with ID (n = 45) and the effects of the program on the aggressive, disruptive, and compliance behaviors of their children. Both groups of mothers participated in the 40-week study (10 weeks control and 30 weeks MBPBS program), rated their own stress levels, and collected daily observational data on the adolescents' behavior. Results showed significant reductions in the level of stress in both groups of mothers, but no differential effects on mothers of children with ASD or with ID. In addition, significant reductions in aggression and disruptive behavior and increases in compliance behaviors were observed in the adolescents in both groups. The results suggest that MBPBS is equally beneficial for mothers of adolescents with ASD or ID. In the present study, although the mothers of children with ID had slightly higher levels of stress at baseline and mothers of children with ASD had lower levels of stress following the MBPBS program, the program can be considered equally effective in reducing the stress levels of both groups of mothers. This suggests that the program may be effective regardless of baseline levels of mothers' stress.",Novel ERP Evidence for Processing Differences Between Negative and Positive Polarity Items in German.,https://www.ncbi.nlm.nih.gov/pubmed/30894822,Frontiers in psychology,2019 03 29,"One unresolved question about polarity sensitivity in theoretical linguistics concerns whether and to what extent negative and positive polarity items are parallel. Using event-related brain potentials (ERPs), previous studies found N400 and/or P600 components for negative and positive polarity violations with inconsistent results. We report on an ERP study of German polarity items. Both negative and positive polarity violations elicited biphasic N400/P600 effects relative to correct polarity conditions. Furthermore, negative polarity violations elicited a P600-only effect relative to positive polarity violations. The lack of a graded N400 effect indicates that both kinds of violations involve similar semantic processing costs. We attribute the increase in P600 amplitude of negative polarity violations relative to positive polarity violations to their different nature: the former are syntactic anomalies triggering structural reanalysis, whereas the latter are pragmatic oddities inducing discourse reanalysis. We conclude that negative and positive polarity violations involve at least partly distinct mechanisms.","Pilot-Testing of ""Healthy Body Healthy Mind"": An Integrative Lifestyle Program for Patients With a Mental Illness and Co-morbid Metabolic Syndrome.",https://www.ncbi.nlm.nih.gov/pubmed/30894821,Frontiers in psychiatry,2019 03 29,"Background: Metabolic syndrome and co-morbid physical health conditions are highly prevalent in people with a mental illness. Modifiable lifestyle factors have been targeted to improve health outcomes. Healthy Body Healthy Mind (HBHM) program was developed to provide an integrated evidence-based program incorporating practical diet and exercise instruction; alongside meditation and mindfulness strategies, and comprehensive psychoeducation, to improve the physical and mental health of those with a mental illness. Methods: We report on two data points: (1) Qualitative data derived from the first HBHM program (version 1) exploring its utility and acceptance according to patient feedback; (2) Biometric and mental health data collected on the modified and enhanced 12-week HBHM program (version 2) involving a pilot of 10 participants. Mental and physical health outcomes, weight, abdominal circumference, fasting glucose, cholesterol, and triglycerides were measured at program entry and completion. Results: Qualitative data from HBHM version 1 provided valuable feedback to redevelop and enhance the program. At the end of the HBHM (version 2) 12-week program, a significant mean weight loss of 2 kg was achieved, p = 0.023. There was also a significant reduction in abdominal circumference (mean = 2.55 cm) and a decrease in BMI of almost one point (mean = 0.96 kg/m2), p = 0.046 and p = 0.019, respectively. There were no significant changes in mental health measures or on any other biometrics. Conclusion: Pilot data from the HBHM program found significant reductions in weight and abdominal obesity. The HBHM program could benefit from further modifications, and study replication is required using a controlled design in a larger sample.",Housing Temperature Modulates the Impact of Diet-Induced Rise in Fat Mass on Adipose Tissue Before and During Pregnancy in Rats.,https://www.ncbi.nlm.nih.gov/pubmed/30894820,Frontiers in physiology,2019 03 29,"Aim: To investigate whether housing temperature influences rat adiposity, and the extent it is modified by diet and/or pregnancy. Housing temperature impacts on brown adipose tissue, that possess a unique uncoupling protein (UCP) 1, which, when activated by reduced ambient temperature, enables rapid heat generation. Methods: We, therefore, examined whether the effects of dietary induced rise in fat mass on interscapular brown fat in female rats were dependent on housing temperature, and whether pregnancy further modulates the response. Four week old rats were either maintained at thermoneutrality (27°C) or at a ""standard"" cool temperature (20°C), and fed either a control or obesogenic (high in fat and sugar) diet until 10 weeks old. They were then either tissue sampled or mated with a male maintained under the same conditions. The remaining dams were tissue sampled at either 10 or 19 days gestation. Results: Diet had the greatest effect on fat mass at thermoneutrality although, by 19 days gestation, fat weight was similar between groups. Prior to mating, the abundance of UCP1 was higher at 20°C, but was similar between groups during pregnancy. UCP1 mRNA followed a similar pattern, with expression declining to a greater extent in the animals maintained at 20°C. Conclusion: Housing temperature has a marked influence on the effect of dietary induced rise in fat deposition that was modified through gestation. This maybe mediated by the reduction in UCP1 with housing at thermoneutrality prior to pregnancy and could subsequently impact on growth and development of the offspring.",Repeated Sprint Ability and Muscular Responses According to the Age Category in Elite Youth Soccer Players.,https://www.ncbi.nlm.nih.gov/pubmed/30894819,Frontiers in physiology,2019 03 29,"The aim of this study was to analyse the influence of age category on the performance and muscle response after a Repeated Sprint Ability (RSA) test in elite youth soccer players. 62 soccer players from three different age categories (Under 14 [n = 21], Under 16 [n = 20], and Under 18 [n = 21]) were selected to participate in this study. Players completed an RSA test (7 × 30 m) with a 20-s recovery between sprints. The muscular response to an electrical stimulus before and after the test of both the biceps femoris (BF) and the rectus femoris (RF) were evaluated using tensiomyography. A two-way ANOVA was used to analyse the differences in RSA parameters in each of the four distance-intervals (0-5; 5-25; 25-30; 0-30 m) between sprint and age category. The U14 age category (5.30 ± 0.30 s) showed higher mean sprint times than U16 (4.62 ± 0.20 s) and U18 (4.46 ± 0.17 s) throughout the entire test (p < 0.01). U16 players revealed a worse best sprints time (RSABEST) than U18 players (+0.12 s, CI95%: to 0.01 to 0.24; ES: 1.09, p = 0.03). The muscular contractile properties were similar in the three age categories analyzed (p > 0.05), although the delay time (Td) of the muscle was significantly lower after the RSA test in U16 players (-1.53 ms, CI95%: -2.607 to -0.452; ES: 0.38) and U18 players (-1.11 ms, CI95%: -2.10 to -0.12; ES: 0.22). In conclusion, this study revealed an increase in physical performance and muscle response variability after a repeated sprint ability test in the U16's and over. The fatigue induced by the RSA test did not show differences depending on the age of the players, although muscle mechanical properties were altered after the RSA test in U16 and U18 soccer players. Physical performance and muscle response can be complementary variables in managing fatigue according to the age category in soccer players.",Acaricidal Mechanism of Scopoletin Against Tetranychus cinnabarinus.,https://www.ncbi.nlm.nih.gov/pubmed/30894818,Frontiers in physiology,2019 03 29,"Scopoletin is a promising acaricidal botanical natural compound against Tetranychus cinnabarinus, and its acaricidal mechanism maybe involve calcium overload according to our previous study. To seek potential candidate target genes of calcium overload induced by scopoletin in T. cinnabarinus, RNA-seq was utilized to detect changes in transcription levels. 24 and 48 h after treatment, 70 and 102 differentially expressed genes were obtained, respectively. Target genes included 3 signal transduction genes, 4 cell apoptosis genes, 4 energy metabolism genes, and 2 transcription factor genes. The role of 3 calcium signaling pathway-related genes, namely, G-protein-coupled neuropeptide receptor, Bcl-2 protein and guanylate kinase (designated TcGPCR, TcBAG, and TcGUK, respectively) in the calcium overload were investigated in this study. RT-qPCR detection showed that scopoletin treatment upregulated the expression level of TcGPCR and downregulated the expression level of TcBAG and TcGUK. The result of RNAi indicated that downregulation of TcGPCR decreased susceptibility to scopoletin, and downregulation of TcBAG and TcGUK enhanced susceptibility to scopoletin. Functional expression in Chinese hamster ovary cells showed that scopoletin induced a significant increase in intracellular free calcium [Ca2+]i levels by activating TcGPCR. These results demonstrated that the acaricidal mechanism of scopoletin was via disrupting intracellular Ca2+ homeostasis and calcium signaling pathway mediated by GPCR, BAG, and GUK.",The Anti-depression Effect of Angelicae Sinensis Radix Is Related to the Pharmacological Activity of Modulating the Hematological Anomalies.,https://www.ncbi.nlm.nih.gov/pubmed/30894817,Frontiers in pharmacology,2019 03 29,"Angelicae Sinensis Radix (AS), a well-known herb in traditional Chinese medicine (TCM), has been wildly used for replenishing the blood and promoting circulation, in Asia for thousands of years. It has been confirmed that AS also possesses the pharmacological activity of anti-depression. At the same time, recent studies suggested that depression is associated with anemia, and depression could be ameliorated via modulating the blood system. However, it is still unknown whether the anti-depression effect of AS is related to its pharmacological activity of modulating the blood system. In the current study, hematological examination and metabonomic techniques were performed to explore potential anti-depression mechanisms of AS, related to the function of modulating the blood system in a chronic unpredictable mild stress (CUMS) model. The results demonstrated that AS could significantly improve CUMS-induced depressive symptom, hematological anomalies, and hypoxia symptoms. The analysis of metabonomics demonstrated that 26 potential biomarkers in depression could be regulated by the administration of AS. Among them, eight biomarkers participate in the metabolic pathways of amino acid and sphingolipid, and energy metabolism could also be regulated in an anemia model through the administration of AS, as reported in previous literatures. Further results proved that AS modulated energy metabolism in depression through the inhibition of the expression of pyruvate dehydrogenase lipoamide kinase isozyme 1 (PDK-1) and lactate dehydrogenase A (LDHA). These results suggested that the modulation of the blood system was involved in the anti-depression effect of AS. The mechanism may be associated with the promotion of the body's energy metabolism, the stabilization of cell membranes, the promotion of serum protein synthesis, and the enhancement of immunity.",Sishen Wan® Ameliorated Trinitrobenzene-Sulfonic-Acid-Induced Chronic Colitis via NEMO/NLK Signaling Pathway.,https://www.ncbi.nlm.nih.gov/pubmed/30894816,Frontiers in pharmacology,2019 03 29,"The nuclear factor (NF)-κB signaling pathway plays an important role in the initialization and development phase of inflammatory injuries, including inflammatory bowel disease (IBD). Sishen Wan (SSW) is a classic Chinese patent medicine listed in the Chinese Pharmacopoeia, which is usually used to treat chronic colitis; however, it is unclear whether SSW can treat IBD via the NF-κB signaling pathway. In the present study, the therapeutic effect of SSW was demonstrated by the decreased index of colonic weight, macroscopic and microscopic score, and pathological observation in chronic colitis induced by trinitrobenzene sulfonic acid. In colonic mucosa of rats with chronic colitis, SSW reduced the levels of calprotectin and eliminated oxidative lesions; downregulated expression of interferon-γ, interleukin (IL)-1β and IL-17; increased expression of IL-4; and suppressed expression of NF-κB p65, and NF-κB essential modulator (NEMO)-like kinase (NLK). Furthermore, SSW inhibited ubiquitinated NEMO, ubiquitin-activated enzyme, and E2i activation, and phosphorylation of downstream proteins (cylindromatosis protein, transforming growth factor-β-activated kinase and P38). These results show that the therapeutic effects of SSW in chronic colitis were mediated by inhibiting the NEMO/NLK signaling pathway to suppress NF-κB activation.",Can Positive Framing Reduce Nocebo Side Effects? Current Evidence and Recommendation for Future Research.,https://www.ncbi.nlm.nih.gov/pubmed/30894815,Frontiers in pharmacology,2019 03 29,"Although critical for informed consent, side effect warnings can contribute directly to poorer patient outcomes because they often induce negative expectations that trigger nocebo side effects. Communication strategies that reduce the development of nocebo side effects whilst maintaining informed consent are therefore of considerable interest. We reviewed theoretical and empirical evidence for the use of framing strategies to achieve this. Framing refers to the way in which information about the likelihood or significance of side effects is presented (e.g., negative frame: 30% will experience headache vs. positive frame: 70% will not experience headache), with the rationale that positively framing such information could diminish nocebo side effects. Relatively few empirical studies (k = 6) have tested whether framing strategies can reduce nocebo side effects. Of these, four used attribute framing and two message framing. All but one of the studies found a significant framing effect on at least one aspect of side effects (e.g., experience, attribution, threat), suggesting that framing is a promising strategy for reducing nocebo effects. However, our review also revealed some important open questions regarding these types of framing effects, including, the best method of communicating side effects (written, oral, pictorial), optimal statistical presentation (e.g., frequencies vs. percentages), whether framing affects perceived absolute risk of side effects, and what psychological mechanisms underlie framing effects. Future research that addresses these open questions will be vital for understanding the circumstances in which framing are most likely to be effective.",Therapeutic Potential of Targeting ß-Arrestin.,https://www.ncbi.nlm.nih.gov/pubmed/30894814,Frontiers in pharmacology,2019 03 29,"ß-arrestins are multifunctional proteins that modulate heptahelical 7 transmembrane receptors, also known as G protein-coupled receptors (GPCRs), a superfamily of receptors that regulate most physiological processes. ß-arrestin modulation of GPCR function includes termination of G protein-dependent signaling, initiation of ß-arrestin-dependent signaling, receptor trafficking to degradative or recycling pathways, receptor transactivation, transcriptional regulation, and localization of second messenger regulators. The pleiotropic influence ß-arrestins exert on these receptors regulates a breadth of physiological functions, and additionally, ß-arrestins are involved in the pathophysiology of numerous and wide-ranging diseases, making them prime therapeutic targets. In this review, we briefly describe the mechanisms by which ß-arrestins regulate GPCR signaling, including the functional cellular mechanisms modulated by ß-arrestins and relate this to observed pathophysiological responses associated with ß-arrestins. We focus on the role for ß-arrestins in transducing cell signaling; a pathway that is complementary to the classical G protein-coupling pathway. The existence of these GPCR dual signaling pathways offers an immense therapeutic opportunity through selective targeting of one signaling pathway over the other. Finally, we will consider several mechanisms by which the potential of dual signaling pathway regulation can be harnessed and the implications for improved disease treatments."

Pioneering work has identified the different cell types involved in energy production and use. Recent evidence has demonstrated a key role of L-Lactate in brain energy metabolism, producing a paradigm-shift in our understanding of the neuronal energy metabolism. At the center of this shift, is the identification of a central role of astrocytes in neuroenergetics. Thanks to their morphological characteristics, they are poised to take up glucose from the circulation and deliver energy substrates to neurons. Astrocyte neuron lactate shuttle (ANLS) model, has shown that the main energy substrate that astrocytes deliver to neurons is L-Lactate, to sustain neuronal oxidative metabolism. L-Lactate can also be produced from glycogen, the storage form of glucose, which is exclusively localized in astrocytes. Inhibition of glycogen metabolism and the ensuing inhibition of L-Lactate production leads to cognitive dysfunction. Experimental evidence indicates that the role of lactate in cognitive function relates not only to its role as a metabolic substrate for neurons but also as a signaling molecule for synaptic plasticity. Interestingly, a similar metabolic uncoupling appears to exist in peripheral tissues plasma, whereby glucose provides L-Lactate as the substrate for cellular oxidative metabolism. In this perspective article, we review the known information on the distribution of glycogen and lactate within brain cells, and how this distribution relates to the energy regime of glial vs. neuronal cells.",Loss of Pax6 Causes Regional Changes in Dll1 Expression in Developing Cerebral Cortex.,https://www.ncbi.nlm.nih.gov/pubmed/30894800,Frontiers in cellular neuroscience,2019 03 29,"The transcription factor Pax6 controls multiple aspects of forebrain development. Conditional deletion of Pax6 in embryonic mouse cortex causes increased proliferation of cortical progenitor cells and a concomitant decrease in neural differentiation. Notch signaling regulates the balance between proliferation and differentiation of cortical progenitor cells, suggesting a possible connection between Pax6 and Notch signaling. We investigated how expression of the Notch ligand delta-like 1 (Dll1) is altered by loss of Pax6. Acute cortex-specific deletion of Pax6 resulted in a widespread decrease in the density of Dll1+ cells at embryonic days 12.5 and 13.5 (E12.5 and E13.5). In constitutive loss-of-function mutants, decreases in the densities of Dll1+ cells were more limited both spatially and temporally. Controlled over-expression of Pax6 had no detectable effect on Dll1 expression. The proneural transcription factor Neurog2 is a target of Pax6 that can activate Dll1 expression and we found clear co-expression of Neurog2 and Dll1 in radial glial progenitors, suggesting that Pax6's effect on Dll1 could be mediated through Neurog2. However, we found no change in Dll1+ cells in Neurog2-/- cortex suggesting either that Neurog2 is not directly involved, or that its loss of function in embryonic cortex can be compensated for.",Immunity Against Bacterial Infection of the Central Nervous System: An Astrocyte Perspective.,https://www.ncbi.nlm.nih.gov/pubmed/30894799,Frontiers in molecular neuroscience,2019 03 29,"Bacterial infection of the central nervous system (CNS) is a severe and life-threatening condition with high mortality, and it may lead to permanent neurological deficits in survivors. Increasing evidence indicates that astrocytes, as the most abundant CNS glial cell population, regulate innate and adaptive immune responses in the CNS under pathological conditions in addition to their role in the maintenance of CNS homeostasis and neuronal function. Following antigen recognition, astrocytes participate in the initiation of innate immune responses, and prompt an adaptive immune response to recruit peripheral immune cells. Investigations have been conducted to understand the immunological role of astrocytes in CNS disease and injury, however, their part in bacterial infections of the CNS has not been fully evaluated. A better understanding will permit the identification of successful therapeutic targets for an improved prognosis and disease outcome.",Psychophysical Evaluation of Visual Functions of Ex-Alcoholic Subjects After Prolonged Abstinence.,https://www.ncbi.nlm.nih.gov/pubmed/30894798,Frontiers in neuroscience,2019 03 29,"Chronic alcohol abuse can lead to a brain damages, and the health status of alcoholics even after a long-term alcohol abstinence is a public health concern. The present study investigated the color vision and spatial luminance contrast sensitivity of a group of 17 ex-alcoholics (46.3 ± 6.7 years old) in long-term alcohol abstinence after having been previously under alcohol dependence for many years. We also investigated the association of impaired psychophysical performance in different tests we applied. The mean time of alcohol consumption was 16.9 ± 5.1 years and the mean abstinence period was 12.4 ± 8.5 years. Achromatic vision of all subjects was evaluated using spatial luminance contrast sensitivity function (CSF) test and color vision was evaluated using Mollon-Reffin color discrimination test (MR) and the Farnsworth-Munsell 100 hue arrangement test (FM100). Relative to controls, the spatial luminance contrast sensitivity was lower in 10/17 of the ex-alcoholic subjects. In the color vision tests, 11/16 ex-alcoholic subjects had impaired results compared to controls in the FM100 test and 13/14 subjects had color vision deficits measured in the MR test. Fourteen subjects performed all visual tests, three subjects had impaired results for all tests, seven subjects had impaired results in two tests, three subjects had visual deficit in one test, and one had normal results for all tests. The results showed the existence of functional deficits in achromatic and chromatic vision of subjects with history of chronic alcoholism after long abstinence. Most subjects had altered result in more than one test, especially in the color vision tests. The present investigation suggests that the damage in visual functions produced by abusive alcohol consumption is not reversed after long term alcohol abstinence.",In Praise of Artifice Reloaded: Caution With Natural Image Databases in Modeling Vision.,https://www.ncbi.nlm.nih.gov/pubmed/30894796,Frontiers in neuroscience,2019 03 29,"Subjective image quality databases are a major source of raw data on how the visual system works in naturalistic environments. These databases describe the sensitivity of many observers to a wide range of distortions of different nature and intensity seen on top of a variety of natural images. Data of this kind seems to open a number of possibilities for the vision scientist to check the models in realistic scenarios. However, while these natural databases are great benchmarks for models developed in some other way (e.g., by using the well-controlled artificial stimuli of traditional psychophysics), they should be carefully used when trying to fit vision models. Given the high dimensionality of the image space, it is very likely that some basic phenomena are under-represented in the database. Therefore, a model fitted on these large-scale natural databases will not reproduce these under-represented basic phenomena that could otherwise be easily illustrated with well selected artificial stimuli. In this work we study a specific example of the above statement. A standard cortical model using wavelets and divisive normalization tuned to reproduce subjective opinion on a large image quality dataset fails to reproduce basic cross-masking. Here we outline a solution for this problem by using artificial stimuli and by proposing a modification that makes the model easier to tune. Then, we show that the modified model is still competitive in the large-scale database. Our simulations with these artificial stimuli show that when using steerable wavelets, the conventional unit norm Gaussian kernels in divisive normalization should be multiplied by high-pass filters to reproduce basic trends in masking. Basic visual phenomena may be misrepresented in large natural image datasets but this can be solved with model-interpretable stimuli. This is an additional argument in praise of artifice in line with Rust and Movshon (2005).",Antierythropoietin Antibody Production Is Not Associated with Malaria and Malaria-Related Anaemia in Humans.,https://www.ncbi.nlm.nih.gov/pubmed/30894794,TheScientificWorldJournal,2019 06 13,"The pathophysiology of malaria-related anaemia is not fully understood although increased destruction of parasitized and nonparasitized erythrocytes, as well as inadequate erythropoiesis, has been proposed.

Hospital care for mothers and infants should be family-centred, with healthy mothers and infants remaining together and going home at the same time. The specific length of stay for newborn infants depends on the health of their mother, infant health and stability, the mother's ability to care for her infant, support at home, and access to follow-up care. Many mother-infant dyads are ready to go home 24 h after birth. Parent or guardian education and assessment of discharge readiness are important components of discharge planning. Each infant must have an appropriate discharge plan, including identification of the infant's primary health care provider and assessment by a health care provider 24 h to 72 h after discharge.",HIV Care Continuum among Postpartum Women Living with HIV in Atlanta.,https://www.ncbi.nlm.nih.gov/pubmed/30894788,Infectious diseases in obstetrics and gynecology,2019 06 11,"While increased healthcare engagement and antiretroviral therapy (ART) adherence occurs during pregnancy, women living with HIV (WLWH) are often lost to follow-up after delivery.

To characterize the religiosity and spirituality of final year pharmacy students and examine the impact on performance in pharmacy school and future practice. Methods. An electronic survey was sent to 308 students in their final year of pharmacy school at four universities (two private and two public institutions). Results. There were 141 respondents to the survey for a response rate of 46%. Key findings are religiosity/spirituality did not impact academic performance, students felt supported in their spiritual/religious beliefs, religiosity/spirituality had a positive impact on students' emotional/mental well-being, attending pharmacy school decreased organized religion, less than half of the students would work for a pharmacy not allowing the ""right to refuse to dispense,"" students felt religiosity/spirituality could affect health/medication adherence, and most students were not familiar with how to conduct a spiritual assessment. Conclusion. Pharmacy schools should find ways to acknowledge and support religiosity/spirituality for pharmacy students and for promoting holistic patient well-being.",Relationships Between Myers-Briggs Type Indicators and NAPLEX Performances.,https://www.ncbi.nlm.nih.gov/pubmed/30894769,American journal of pharmaceutical education,2019 03 29,"Objective. To examine the relationships between pharmacy students' Myers-Briggs Type Indicators (MBTIs) and their first-attempt NAPLEX scores within an accelerated, dual campus curriculum. Methods. Data from the MBTIs and NAPLEX findings were retrieved from a single cohort of the Columbia, SC and Savannah, GA campuses of South University School of Pharmacy. A multiple linear regression technique was performed to assess the degree of variability in first-attempt NAPLEX scores that could be accounted for by MBTIs, campus of enrollment, and gender. Results. Of the 134 student data samples collected, 119 (86%) were included for study analysis. Campus of enrollment and MBTIs were predictive of first-attempt NAPLEX scores. Introversion personality types scored 9.5 points higher on the NAPLEX than extroversion types; feeling personality types scored 6.0 points higher than thinking types; students enrolled at the Savannah, GA campus scored 5.7 points higher than their Columbia, SC campus counterparts. Conclusion. Certain personality types were shown to have predictive value with regard to first-attempt NAPLEX score achievements. These results offer plausible insights into pharmacy student tendencies that can affect success on high-stakes standardized examinations. Additional research into sociological aspects of pharmacy students' composition may assist with optimizing performances on licensure examinations as prerequisites to proficient careers within the pharmacy profession.",Lessons Learned from Evaluating a Process for Systematic Curriculum Review.,https://www.ncbi.nlm.nih.gov/pubmed/30894768,American journal of pharmaceutical education,2019 03 29,"Objective. To describe an evaluation of and improvements made to a process of systematic curriculum review. Methods. The systematic curriculum review process was developed with the goal of continuous curriculum assessment and improvement. Information on impact and feedback on the processes were collected from curriculum committee experience and an anonymous web-based survey sent to instructors of courses offered by the pharmacy school, and current and past curriculum committee members. Results. Thirty (88%) participants completed the survey with 72% reporting course changes due to systematic curriculum review, such as changes to programmatic outcomes covered (77%), assessment strategies/grading (46%), course outcomes (38%), and content (38%). Based on feedback received, revisions were made to the process: changing the frequency of course review (from every 3 years to 4 years), including experiential and elective courses (supported by 63% of faculty), and streamlining the logistics of course review and presentation to the curriculum committee. Conclusion. The development of the systematic curriculum review process resulted in course improvements and a system to keep curricular mapping current. It was valuable in the most recent preparation of the self-study and could be readily transferred to other institutions.",A Longitudinal Evidence-Based Medicine Curriculum and Its Impact on the Attitudes and Perceptions of Student Pharmacists.,https://www.ncbi.nlm.nih.gov/pubmed/30894767,American journal of pharmaceutical education,2019 03 29,"Objective. To describe a longitudinal evidence-based medicine (EBM) curriculum and to evaluate its impact on the attitudes and perceptions of student pharmacists toward EBM. Methods. Western University of Health Sciences has had a structured, longitudinal, EBM curriculum for more than 10 years, spanning the first to third years, including the introductory experiential experiences. A survey was administered prior to the main EBM course and at the completion of the course at three time periods to assess student pharmacists' attitudes and perceptions of EBM and interactive pedagogical methods. Student pharmacists at Western University of Health Sciences voluntarily participated in the self-administered survey. The three time periods examined included: directly after completion of the EBM course, after completion of the didactic curriculum, and after completion of the advanced pharmacy practice experiences (APPE). Results. The response rates were: pre-survey 94% and post-survey 53%. The three classes surveyed had similar baseline characteristics. Students' perceptions of EBM skills and attitudes improved at all time periods post-course. Students felt strongly both before and after exposure to the EBM course and the longitudinal EBM curriculum about learning new EBM skills and that all pharmacists should have these skills. Significantly more students appreciated all the interactive pedagogical methods after APPE completion (>85% of students), as compared with over 74% of students directly after the EBM course, and over 79% of students after didactic completion. Conclusion. The attitudes and perceptions of student pharmacists toward EBM improved after exposure to a longitudinal EBM curriculum.",An Integrated Dyspepsia Module for First-year Pharmacy Students.,https://www.ncbi.nlm.nih.gov/pubmed/30894766,American journal of pharmaceutical education,2019 03 29,"Objective. To design an integrated dyspepsia module for first year pharmacy students that combines clinical and professional practice with fundamental sciences in five different science subject areas. Methods. The approaches used in designing this module are described with emphasis on strategies adopted to integrate science and practice, and the new ways of working adopted by the design team. Students' views and experiences of the module and its integration were explored using questionnaires. Results. A high proportion of students reported positive views and experiences of the module, the integration and its impact (as self-reported) on their learning and practice. The assessment of student performance indicated learning and attainment was at an appropriate level for a first-year module. Both the student grades and research results indicate a positive student learning experience. Conclusion. The dyspepsia module provides a flexible and effective template for the integration of science and practice in theme-based modules, with students reporting positively about the integration, including their perception of its contribution to improving their learning and understanding. New and more collaborative ways of working are required when designing integrated modules.",Teaching History of Pharmacy in U.S. Pharmacy Schools.,https://www.ncbi.nlm.nih.gov/pubmed/30894765,American journal of pharmaceutical education,2019 03 21,"Objective. To determine how the standards for teaching pharmacy history were met by U.S. pharmacy schools, whether schools wanted to expand their commitment to pharmacy history, what pedagogical assistance, if any, was desired, and whether elective courses were offered. Methods. There were 133 school deans who were asked to identify the responsible faculty for teaching pharmacy history. A 10-question online survey instrument was designed and emailed to these faculty or the dean if no faculty were identified. Follow-up emails were sent at 2-week intervals. If they were non-responsive after three attempts, then telephone solicitation was attempted. Results. There were 100 schools (75%) that responded. Fifty-three percent were public and 47% were private; with 50% having class sizes of 100 or less, 41% with 101-250, and 9% having over 250. Eighty-six percent of respondents meet the ACPE requirement within a required course. Seventy-two percent devote only one to five hours of instruction to meet the requirement. Sixty-eight percent use no supporting literature, and among those who do, there was no common textbook. Interestingly, 21% wanted more teaching time, and 91% desired pedagogical assistance, varying from a packaged course (26%) to a syllabus with assignments and assessment banks (23%). Conclusion. Since no time or material guidelines were established to fulfill the ACPE pharmacy history educational requirements, these results provide a starting point to judge what is adequate and/or preferred. With the development of teaching guidelines and adoptable teaching materials, the pedagogical solution to this ACPE standard may become more complete and consistent.","Impact of Students' Strengths, Critical Thinking Skills and Disposition on Academic Success in the First Year of a PharmD Program.",https://www.ncbi.nlm.nih.gov/pubmed/30894764,American journal of pharmaceutical education,2019 03 29,"Objective. To determine the critical thinking skills, critical thinking disposition, and personal strengths that contribute to student success and excellence in the first year of a doctor of pharmacy (PharmD) program. Methods. Student pharmacists from three cohorts completed the Health Sciences Reasoning Test (HSRT) to assess their critical thinking skills, the California Critical Thinking Disposition Inventory (CCTDI) to assess their critical thinking disposition, and the StrengthsFinder 2.0 assessment to determine their top five Signature Themes. HSRT overall categories, CCTDI subcategories, and top five Signature Themes were analyzed to determine both independent predictors and a logistic regression model of success and excellence. Results. HSRT and the Signature Theme of Consistency were independently associated with both success and excellence. CCTDI Open-mindedness and the Signature Themes of Achiever and Learner were also independent predictors of excellence. Age and several Signature Themes were negative independent predictors of success. In a multiple logistic regression model, HSRT overall category and the absence of Signature Themes Command and Woo predicted success and HSRT overall category predicted excellence. Conclusion. This is the first model to determine performance in the first year of PharmD program using Signature Themes. Critical thinking skills, the critical thinking disposition of Open-mindedness and the Signature Themes of Achiever, Consistency, and Learner are associated with the highest student performance.",Association Between Prerequisites and Academic Success at a Canadian University's Pharmacy Program.,https://www.ncbi.nlm.nih.gov/pubmed/30894763,American journal of pharmaceutical education,2019 03 29,"Objective. To identify pharmacy prerequisites associated with academic success in the current Bachelor of Science in Pharmacy (BSP) program and anticipated success in the planned Doctor of Pharmacy (PharmD) program at the University of Saskatchewan. Methods. Statistical analysis was conducted on retrospective data of the grades of 1,236 pharmacy students admitted from 2002 to 2015. BSP success was calculated using a weighted average of all required courses within the BSP program. Anticipated success in the PharmD program was calculated from the BSP grades after excluding PharmD prerequisites currently part of the BSP. Models of BSP and PharmD prerequisites and demographic variables associated with pharmacy program success were constructed using stepwise and forced linear regression. Results. For the current BSP program, modelling explained more than half of academic success in year 1. Explicable variance declined each year, explaining less than 20% in year 4. After removing PharmD prerequisites from the program, the BSP prerequisites associated with success were the same as the first model but explained less of the variance in years 1 and 2. Using both BSP and the new PharmD prerequisites explained nearly three-quarters of the variance in year 1 for the remaining pharmacy courses. Explicable variance increased slightly in year 2, declined to approximately two-thirds in year 3 and just over one-half in year 4. Conclusion. Consistency of instructor and course content, along with instructional design and higher-level learning, may explain these stronger associations for the PharmD prerequisites.",A Thematic Analysis of Pharmacy Students' Experiences of the Undergraduate Pharmacy Degree in Ireland and the Role of Mindfulness.,https://www.ncbi.nlm.nih.gov/pubmed/30894762,American journal of pharmaceutical education,2019 03 29,"Objective. To determine pharmacy students' experiences of stress as part of the current pharmacy degree, and to explore the potential of incorporating the principles of mindfulness into course work in the undergraduate degree. Methods. Undergraduate pharmacy students from the five pharmacy schools in Ireland were invited to participate in focus groups between February and November 2016. Recruitment occurred via emails sent by a school's academic or administrative member. Focus groups were audio recorded, anonymized and transcribed by the corresponding author. Transcripts were analyzed using the Braun and Clarke method of thematic analysis and coded. Results. Twenty pharmacy students (60% female) representing all years of study from three of the five pharmacy schools participated across five focus groups. The five key themes that emerged were: so much to do, so little time; the role of lecturers; we are smart people, we want to do well; learning by doing; and mindfulness as a coping tool. Conclusion. The findings of this study support the hypothesis that students experience stress and would welcome mindfulness-based interventions as a management option in the degree. Specifically, the emphasis that mindfulness places on experiential learning would be well-received by students.",Impact of Diabetes Simulation on Empathy in Pharmacy Students.,https://www.ncbi.nlm.nih.gov/pubmed/30894761,American journal of pharmaceutical education,2019 03 29,"Objective. To assess the impact of a diabetes simulation activity on empathy in pharmacy students. Methods. Students enrolled in an elective diabetes course were required to complete a 3-day diabetes simulation. Pre- and post-activity survey questions were administered to assess the effect of the simulation activity on empathy. Students maintained daily logs of their actual blood glucose readings (tested twice a day), pre-meal simulated blood glucose readings, and simulated insulin doses. Students were required to take a placebo oral medication and to respond (and document their approach) to a simulated hypo- or hyperglycemic event. Results. The pre- and post-activity survey results indicated statistically significant changes in responses regarding empathy. Conclusion. This 3-day diabetes simulation increased student empathy and confidence in managing select aspects of diabetes."

The seven lipopolysaccharide transport (Lpt) proteins A-G move lipopolysaccharide from the inner to the outer membrane. The ATP-binding cassette transporter LptB2FG, which tightly associates with LptC, extracts lipopolysaccharide out of the inner membrane. The mechanism of the LptB2FG-LptC complex (LptB2FGC) and the role of LptC in lipopolysaccharide transport are poorly understood. Here we characterize the structures of LptB2FG and LptB2FGC in nucleotide-free and vanadate-trapped states, using single-particle cryo-electron microscopy. These structures resolve the bound lipopolysaccharide, reveal transporter-lipopolysaccharide interactions with side-chain details and uncover how the capture and extrusion of lipopolysaccharide are coupled to conformational rearrangements of LptB2FGC. LptC inserts its transmembrane helix between the two transmembrane domains of LptB2FG, which represents a previously unknown regulatory mechanism for ATP-binding cassette transporters. Our results suggest a role for LptC in achieving efficient lipopolysaccharide transport, by coordinating the action of LptB2FG in the inner membrane and Lpt protein interactions in the periplasm.",A potassium channel β-subunit couples mitochondrial electron transport to sleep.,https://www.ncbi.nlm.nih.gov/pubmed/30894743,Nature,2019 06 10,"The essential but enigmatic functions of sleep1,2 must be reflected in molecular changes sensed by the brain's sleep-control systems. In the fruitfly Drosophila, about two dozen sleep-inducing neurons3 with projections to the dorsal fan-shaped body (dFB) adjust their electrical output to sleep need4, via the antagonistic regulation of two potassium conductances: the leak channel Sandman imposes silence during waking, whereas increased A-type currents through Shaker support tonic firing during sleep5. Here we show that oxidative byproducts of mitochondrial electron transport6,7 regulate the activity of dFB neurons through a nicotinamide adenine dinucleotide phosphate (NADPH) cofactor bound to the oxidoreductase domain8,9 of Shaker's KVβ subunit, Hyperkinetic10,11. Sleep loss elevates mitochondrial reactive oxygen species in dFB neurons, which register this rise by converting Hyperkinetic to the NADP+-bound form. The oxidation of the cofactor slows the inactivation of the A-type current and boosts the frequency of action potentials, thereby promoting sleep. Energy metabolism, oxidative stress, and sleep-three processes implicated independently in lifespan, ageing, and degenerative disease6,12-14-are thus mechanistically connected. KVβ substrates8,15,16 or inhibitors that alter the ratio of bound NADPH to NADP+ (and hence the record of sleep debt or waking time) represent prototypes of potential sleep-regulatory drugs.",An X-ray chimney extending hundreds of parsecs above and below the Galactic Centre.,https://www.ncbi.nlm.nih.gov/pubmed/30894726,Nature,2019 03 21,"Evidence has mounted in recent decades that outflows of matter and energy from the central few parsecs of our Galaxy have shaped the observed structure of the Milky Way on a variety of larger scales1. On scales of 15 parsecs, the Galactic Centre has bipolar lobes that can be seen in both the X-ray and radio parts of the spectrum2,3, indicating broadly collimated outflows from the centre, directed perpendicular to the Galactic plane. On larger scales, approaching the size of the Galaxy itself, γ-ray observations have revealed the so-called 'Fermi bubble' features4, implying that our Galactic Centre has had a period of active energy release leading to the production of relativistic particles that now populate huge cavities on both sides of the Galactic plane. The X-ray maps from the ROSAT all-sky survey show that the edges of these cavities close to the Galactic plane are bright in X-rays4-6. At intermediate scales (about 150 parsecs), radio astronomers have observed the Galactic Centre lobe, an apparent bubble of emission seen only at positive Galactic latitudes7,8, but again indicative of energy injection from near the Galactic Centre. Here we report prominent X-ray structures on these intermediate scales (hundreds of parsecs) above and below the plane, which appear to connect the Galactic Centre region to the Fermi bubbles. We propose that these structures, which we term the Galactic Centre 'chimneys', constitute exhaust channels through which energy and mass, injected by a quasi-continuous train of episodic events at the Galactic Centre, are transported from the central few parsecs to the base of the Fermi bubbles4.",Diverse and robust molecular algorithms using reprogrammable DNA self-assembly.,https://www.ncbi.nlm.nih.gov/pubmed/30894725,Nature,2019 03 21,"Molecular biology provides an inspiring proof-of-principle that chemical systems can store and process information to direct molecular activities such as the fabrication of complex structures from molecular components. To develop information-based chemistry as a technology for programming matter to function in ways not seen in biological systems, it is necessary to understand how molecular interactions can encode and execute algorithms. The self-assembly of relatively simple units into complex products1 is particularly well suited for such investigations. Theory that combines mathematical tiling and statistical-mechanical models of molecular crystallization has shown that algorithmic behaviour can be embedded within molecular self-assembly processes2,3, and this has been experimentally demonstrated using DNA nanotechnology4 with up to 22 tile types5-11. However, many information technologies exhibit a complexity threshold-such as the minimum transistor count needed for a general-purpose computer-beyond which the power of a reprogrammable system increases qualitatively, and it has been unclear whether the biophysics of DNA self-assembly allows that threshold to be exceeded. Here we report the design and experimental validation of a DNA tile set that contains 355 single-stranded tiles and can, through simple tile selection, be reprogrammed to implement a wide variety of 6-bit algorithms. We use this set to construct 21 circuits that execute algorithms including copying, sorting, recognizing palindromes and multiples of 3, random walking, obtaining an unbiased choice from a biased random source, electing a leader, simulating cellular automata, generating deterministic and randomized patterns, and counting to 63, with an overall per-tile error rate of less than 1 in 3,000. These findings suggest that molecular self-assembly could be a reliable algorithmic component within programmable chemical systems. The development of molecular machines that are reprogrammable-at a high level of abstraction and thus without requiring knowledge of the underlying physics-will establish a creative space in which molecular programmers can flourish.",Deep electrical imaging of the ultraslow-spreading Mohns Ridge.,https://www.ncbi.nlm.nih.gov/pubmed/30894724,Nature,2019 03 21,"More than a third of mid-ocean ridges have a spreading rate of less than 20 millimetres a year1. The lack of deep imaging data means that factors controlling melting and mantle upwelling2,3, the depth to the lithosphere-asthenosphere boundary (LAB)4,5, crustal thickness6-9 and hydrothermal venting are not well understood for ultraslow-spreading ridges10,11. Modern electromagnetic data have greatly improved our understanding of fast-spreading ridges12,13, but have not been available for the ultraslow-spreading ridges. Here we present a detailed 120-kilometre-deep electromagnetic joint inversion model for the ultraslow-spreading Mohns Ridge, combining controlled source electromagnetic and magnetotelluric data. Inversion images show mantle upwelling focused along a narrow, oblique and strongly asymmetric zone coinciding with asymmetric surface uplift. Although the upwelling pattern shows several of the characteristics of a dynamic system3,12-14, it probably reflects passive upwelling controlled by slow and asymmetric plate movements instead. Upwelling asthenosphere and melt can be traced to the inferred depth of the Mohorovičić discontinuity and are enveloped by the resistivity (100 ohm metres) contour denoted the electrical LAB (eLAB). The eLAB may represent a rheological boundary defined by a minimum melt content. We also find that neither the melt-suppression model7 nor the inhibited-migration model15, which explain the correlation between spreading rate and crustal thickness6,16-19, can explain the thin crust below the ridge. A model in which crustal thickness is directly controlled by the melt-producing rock volumes created by the separating plates is more likely. Active melt emplacement into oceanic crust about three kilometres thick culminates in an inferred crustal magma chamber draped by fluid convection cells emanating at the Loki's Castle hydrothermal black smoker field. Fluid convection extends for long lateral distances, exploiting high porosity at mid-crustal levels. The magnitude and long-lived nature of such plumbing systems could promote venting at ultraslow-spreading ridges.",Van der Waals integration before and beyond two-dimensional materials.,https://www.ncbi.nlm.nih.gov/pubmed/30894723,Nature,2019 03 21,"Material integration strategies, such as epitaxial growth, usually involve strong chemical bonds and are typically limited to materials with strict structure matching and processing compatibility. Van der Waals integration, in which pre-fabricated building blocks are physically assembled together through weak van der Waals interactions, offers an alternative bond-free integration strategy without lattice and processing limitations, as exemplified by two-dimensional van der Waals heterostructures. Here we review the development, challenges and opportunities of this emerging approach, generalizing it for flexible integration of diverse material systems beyond two dimensions, and discuss its potential for creating artificial heterostructures or superlattices beyond the reach of existing materials.",Particle robotics based on statistical mechanics of loosely coupled components.,https://www.ncbi.nlm.nih.gov/pubmed/30894722,Nature,2019 03 21,"Biological organisms achieve robust high-level behaviours by combining and coordinating stochastic low-level components1-3. By contrast, most current robotic systems comprise either monolithic mechanisms4,5 or modular units with coordinated motions6,7. Such robots require explicit control of individual components to perform specific functions, and the failure of one component typically renders the entire robot inoperable. Here we demonstrate a robotic system whose overall behaviour can be successfully controlled by exploiting statistical mechanics phenomena. We achieve this by incorporating many loosely coupled 'particles', which are incapable of independent locomotion and do not possess individual identity or addressable position. In the proposed system, each particle is permitted to perform only uniform volumetric oscillations that are phase-modulated by a global signal. Despite the stochastic motion of the robot and lack of direct control of its individual components, we demonstrate physical robots composed of up to two dozen particles and simulated robots with up to 100,000 particles capable of robust locomotion, object transport and phototaxis (movement towards a light stimulus). Locomotion is maintained even when 20 per cent of the particles malfunction.

At the single-cell level, atomic force microscopy (AFM) techniques have enabled the quantification of adhesive forces between bacteria and substrata. However, conventional techniques depend on the irreversible immobilization of cells onto cantilevers, thus hampering throughput. Here, we developed a modular AFM method to reversibly immobilize functionalized beads as surface mimic and to probe adhesion of individual bacteria. We performed single-cell force spectroscopies with phylogenetically diverse leaf isolates of various size and morphology. Adhesion measurement of 28 bacterial strains revealed large differences in hydrophobic interactions of about three orders of magnitude. The highest adhesion forces of up to 50 nN were recorded for members of the Gammaproteobacteria. The hydrophobicity of the different isolates correlated positively with the retention of bacteria observed in planta and might provide a basis for successful leaf colonization and potentially disease outbreaks of pathogens.",Diversity-disease relationships and shared species analyses for human microbiome-associated diseases.,https://www.ncbi.nlm.nih.gov/pubmed/30894688,The ISME journal,2019 03 21,"Diversity indices have been routinely computed in the study of human microbiome-associated diseases (MADs). However, it is still unclear whether there is a consistent diversity-disease relationship (DDR) for the human MADs, and whether there are consistent differences in the taxonomic composition of microbiomes sampled from healthy versus diseased individuals. Here we reanalyzed raw data and used a meta-analysis to compare the microbiome diversity and composition of healthy versus diseased individuals in 41 comparisons extracted from 27 previously published studies of human MADs. In the DDR analysis, the average effect size across studies did not differ from zero for a comparison of healthy versus diseased individuals. In 30 of 41 comparisons (73%) there was no significant difference in microbiome diversity of healthy versus diseased individuals, or of different disease classes. For the species composition analysis (shared species analysis), the effect sizes were significantly different from zero. In 33 of 41 comparisons (80%), there were fewer OTUs (operational taxonomic units) shared between healthy and diseased individuals than expected by chance, but with 49% (20 of 41 comparisons) statistically significant. These results imply that the taxonomic composition of disease-associated microbiomes is often distinct from that of healthy individuals.

However, the molecular mechanism underlying the infiltration of TAMs into HCC microenvironment is largely unclear. Recent studies have reported that alteration of mitochondrial nucleoid structures induces mitochondrial DNA (mtDNA) release into the cytosol, which is recognized as mtDNA stress, and consequently regulates innate immunity. Here we aimed to investigate whether mitochondrial fission induces mtDNA stress and then promotes TAM infiltration and HCC progression. Confocal microscopy and real-time PCR were used to detect cytosolic mtDNA content in HCC cells. The relationship between the expression of mitochondrial fission key regulator dynamin-related protein 1 (Drp1) and the percentage of CD163 (a marker of TAMs)-positive cells was investigated in HCC tissues using immunohistochemistry. Finally, the effect of Drp1 overexpression in HCC cells on recruitment and polarization of TAMs was investigated. Our data showed that increased Drp1 expression was positively correlated with the infiltration of TAMs into HCC tissues. Drp1-mediated mitochondrial fission induced the cytosolic mtDNA stress to enhance the CCL2 secretion from HCC cells by TLR9-mediated NF-κB signaling pathway, and thus promoted the TAM recruitment and polarization. Depleting cytosolic mtDNA using DNase I or blocking TLR9 pathway by TLR9 antagonist, siRNA for TLR9 or p65 in HCC cells with Drp1 overexpression significantly decreased the recruitment and polarization of TAMs. Blocking CCR2 by antagonist significantly reduced TAM infiltration and suppressed HCC progression in mouse model. In conclusion, our findings reveal a novel mechanism of TAM infiltration in HCC by mitochondrial fission-induced mtDNA stress.",AKT drives SOX2 overexpression and cancer cell stemness in esophageal cancer by protecting SOX2 from UBR5-mediated degradation.,https://www.ncbi.nlm.nih.gov/pubmed/30894683,Oncogene,2019 03 21,"As a transcription factor critical for embryonic and adult stem cell self-renewal and function, SOX2 gene amplification has been recognized as a driving factor for various cancers including esophageal cancer. SOX2 overexpression occurs more broadly in cancer than gene amplification, but the mechanism is poorly understood. Here we showed that in esophageal cancer cell lines the levels of SOX2 proteins are not directly correlated to the copy numbers of SOX2 genes and are strongly influenced by proteostasis. We showed that AKT is a major determinant for SOX2 overexpression and does so by protecting SOX2 from ubiquitin-dependent protein degradation. We identified UBR5 as a major ubiquitin E3 ligase that induces SOX2 degradation through ubiquitinating SOX2 at lysine 115. Phosphorylation of SOX2 at threonine 116 by AKT inhibits the interaction of UBR5 with SOX2 and thus stabilizes SOX2. We provided evidence that AKT inhibitor can effectively downregulate SOX2 and suppress esopheageal cancer cell proliferation and stemness. Taken together, our study provides new insight into the mechanism of SOX2 overexpression in cancer and evidence for targeting AKT as a potential therapeutic strategy for SOX2-positive cancers.",ROR1-CAVIN3 interaction required for caveolae-dependent endocytosis and pro-survival signaling in lung adenocarcinoma.,https://www.ncbi.nlm.nih.gov/pubmed/30894682,Oncogene,2019 03 21,"The receptor tyrosine kinase-like orphan receptor 1 (ROR1) is a transcriptional target of the lineage-survival oncogene NKX2-1/TTF-1 in lung adenocarcinomas. In addition to its kinase-dependent role, ROR1 functions as a scaffold protein to facilitate interaction between caveolin-1 (CAV1) and CAVIN1, and consequently maintains caveolae formation, which in turn sustains pro-survival signaling toward AKT from multiple receptor tyrosine kinases (RTKs), including epidermal growth factor receptor (EGFR), MET (proto-oncogene, receptor tyrosine kinase), and IGF-IR (insulin-like growth factor receptor 1). Therefore, ROR1 is an attractive target for overcoming EGFR-TKI resistance due to various mechanisms such as EGFR T790M double mutation and bypass signaling from other RTKs. Here, we report that ROR1 possesses a novel scaffold function indispensable for efficient caveolae-dependent endocytosis. CAVIN3 was found to bind with ROR1 at a site distinct from sites for CAV1 and CAVIN1, a novel function required for proper CAVIN3 subcellular localization and caveolae-dependent endocytosis, but not caveolae formation itself. Furthermore, evidence of a mechanistic link between ROR1-CAVIN3 interaction and consequential caveolae trafficking, which was found to utilize a binding site distinct from those for ROR1 interactions with CAV1 and CAVIN1, with RTK-mediated pro-survival signaling towards AKT in early endosomes in lung adenocarcinoma cells was also obtained. The present findings warrant future study to enable development of novel therapeutic strategies for inhibiting the multifaceted scaffold functions of ROR1 in order to reduce the intolerable death toll from this devastating cancer.",Publisher Correction: CRISPR target prediction remains blunt tool for clinical applications.,https://www.ncbi.nlm.nih.gov/pubmed/30894681,Nature biotechnology,2019 04 12,"In the version of this article initially published, we reported that Sangamo's SB-318 had failed to change baseline leukocyte α-L-iduronidase in a phase 1/2 trial.

Because immediate load implants are suitable only for certain categories of implant patients, it has value to develop a novel method to facilitate the implant-bone osseointegration process. Cylindrical titanium implants were implanted in the tooth sockets of beagles, and microelectrode stimulation of the sympathetic nerves in the infraorbital nerve was performed after implantation for 1 week. The authors found that one-sided nerve stimulation was shown to evoke consistent electric potential changes in both sides of the infraorbital nerves. Moreover, after 4 weeks of implantation, more new bone was clearly observed around the implants in the beagles that received electrical stimulation treatment than was observed in the control animals. Furthermore, a higher mineralization density was measured in the new peri-implant bone tissues of the stimulated beagles when compared to controls. These results demonstrate that the simple and safe physical method of microelectrode stimulation to sympathetic nerves can promote the formation of new bone and the osseointegration of implants. This technique is worth promoting and has the potential to reduce the healing time of dental implantation in future clinical cases.",Biology and prognostic impact of clonal plasmacytoid dendritic cells in chronic myelomonocytic leukemia.,https://www.ncbi.nlm.nih.gov/pubmed/30894665,Leukemia,2019 03 21,"Islands of CD123high cells have been commonly described in the bone marrow of patients with chronic myelomonocytic leukemia (CMML). Using a multiparameter flow cytometry assay, we detected an excess of CD123+ mononucleated cells that are lineage-negative, CD45+, CD11c-, CD33-, HLA-DR+, BDCA-2+, BDCA-4+ in the bone marrow of 32/159 (20%) patients. Conventional and electron microscopy, flow cytometry detection of cell surface markers, gene expression analyses, and the ability to synthesize interferon alpha in response to Toll-like receptor agonists identified these cells as bona fide plasmacytoid dendritic cells (pDCs). Whole-exome sequencing of sorted monocytes and pDCs identified somatic mutations in genes of the oncogenic RAS pathway in the two cell types of every patient. CD34+ cells could generate high amount of pDCs in the absence of FMS-like tyrosine kinase 3-ligand (FLT3L). Finally, an excess of pDCs correlates with regulatory T cell accumulation and an increased risk of acute leukemia transformation. These results demonstrate the FLT3L-independent accumulation of clonal pDCs in the bone marrow of CMML patients with mutations affecting the RAS pathway, which is associated with a higher risk of disease progression.",Genetic divergence of native palms of Oenocarpus distichus considering biometric fruit variables.,https://www.ncbi.nlm.nih.gov/pubmed/30894664,Scientific reports,2019 03 29,"Oenocarpus distichus presents economic, ecological, and dietary potential for pulp market processed in natura. Germplasm conservation and genetic improvement depend on genetic divergence studies. The objective was to quantify genetic divergence in a native population of O. distichus genotypes based on fruit biometrics. The fruit length and width, fruit mass, pulp and seed, pulp and almond thickness, and pulp yield per fruit were evaluated. All fruit biometric characteristics of O. distichus palms show genetic variability. Genetic variations among genotypes are essential for predicting heredity and heterosis, which are essential for improving O. distichus production. Pulp yield and seed mass were negatively correlated. Almond thickness and pulp, seed mass and transverse diameter were positively correlated. Genetic distances between pair of genotypes ranged from 0.07 to 48.10 with three genetically distinct groups. The seed mass, almond thickness and transverse diameter contributed to genetic divergence. Heritability estimates the genetic control that can be obtained from O. distichus germplasm. Correlations between the variable pair reduce the evaluation effort and the resources to measure the genotype allocations in heterogeneous groups presenting high genetic variability. This makes it possible to select individuals for hybridization programs with F1 generation gains. Correlation and relative contribution networks, based on relationships graphical between fruit biometric characteristics, allow the variables selection with less effort and fewer measurements. O. distichus fruit biometric characters are efficient to quantify genetic divergence between genotypes.",Neurobiology of rapid-acting antidepressants: convergent effects on GluA1-synaptic function.,https://www.ncbi.nlm.nih.gov/pubmed/30894661,Molecular psychiatry,2019 03 29,"Efforts to develop efficacious antidepressant agents with novel mechanisms have been largely unsuccessful since the 1950's until the discovery of ketamine, an N-methyl-D-aspartate (NMDA) receptor antagonist that produces rapid and sustained antidepressant actions even in treatment-resistant patients. This finding has ushered in a new era for the development of novel rapid-acting antidepressants that act at the NMDA receptor complex, but without dissociative and psychotomimetic side effects of ketamine. Here, we review the current state of rapid-acting antidepressant drug development, including NMDA channel blockers, glycine site agents, and allosteric modulators, as well as ketamine stereoisomers and metabolites. In addition, we focus on the neurobiological mechanisms underlying the actions of these diverse agents and discuss evidence of convergent mechanisms including increased brain-derived neurotrophic factor signaling, increased synthesis of synaptic proteins, and most notably increased GluR1 and synaptic connectivity in the medial prefrontal cortex. These convergent mechanisms provide insight for potential additional novel targets for drug development (e.g., agents that increase synaptic protein synthesis and plasticity). Importantly, the convergent effects on synapse formation and plasticity also reverse the well-documented neuronal and synaptic deficits associated with stress and depression, and thereby target the underlying pathophysiology of major depressive disorder.",River Metabolism along a Latitudinal Gradient across Japan and in a global scale.,https://www.ncbi.nlm.nih.gov/pubmed/30894660,Scientific reports,2019 03 29,"Since temperature is a key factor affecting photosynthetic and respiration rates, the rates of gross primary production (GPP) and ecosystem respiration (ER) are expected to be lower for rivers at higher latitudes, while the net ecosystem production (NEP) rate likely decrease in rivers at lower latitude due to higher sensitivity of ER to temperature compared with GPP. To examine these possibilities, we estimated the ecosystem metabolism of 30 rivers located from 43.03°N to 32.38°N in Japan during summer using a Bayesian model with hourly changes in dissolved oxygen concentrations. In addition, we examined latitudinal trends of GPP, ER and NEP in a global scale by compiling and analyzing river metabolic data estimated in previous studies. Our analysis showed that both GPP and ER tended to increase with latitude, although these rates were positively related to water temperature in Japanese rivers. Global dataset of GPP and ER also showed increasing trend towards higher latitude. In addition, contrary to our initial expectations, NEP decreased with latitude and most rivers were net heterotrophic at both regional (Japanese rivers) and global scales. These results imply that the latitudinal temperature effect on river metabolism is masked by other factors not examined in this study, such as land use in the watershed, which play pivotal roles in explaining the latitudinal variation of river metabolism.",pH effects on plant calcium fluxes: lessons from acidification-mediated calcium elevation induced by the γ-glutamyl-leucine dipeptide identified from Phytophthora infestans.,https://www.ncbi.nlm.nih.gov/pubmed/30894659,Scientific reports,2019 03 29,"Cytosolic Ca2+ ([Ca2+]cyt) elevation is an early signaling response upon exposure to pathogen-derived molecules (so-called microbe-associated molecular patterns, MAMPs) and has been successfully used as a quantitative read-out in genetic screens to identify MAMP receptors or their associated components. Here, we isolated and identified by mass spectrometry the dipeptide γ-Glu-Leu as a component of a Phytophthora infestans mycelium extract that induces [Ca2+]cyt elevation. Treatment of Arabidopsis seedlings with synthetic γ-Glu-Leu revealed stimulatory effects on defense signaling, including a weak enhancement of the expression of some MAMP-inducible genes or affecting the refractory period to a second MAMP elicitation. However, γ-Glu-Leu is not a classical MAMP since pH adjustment abolished these activities and importantly, the observed effects of γ-Glu-Leu could be recapitulated by mimicking extracellular acidification. Thus, although γ-Glu-Leu can act as a direct agonist of calcium sensing receptors in animal systems, the Ca2+-mobilizing activity in plants reported here is due to acidification. Low pH also shapes the Ca2+ signature of well-studied MAMPs (e.g. flg22) or excitatory amino acids such as glutamate. Overall, this work serves as a cautionary reminder that in defense signaling studies where Ca2+ flux measurements are concerned, it is important to monitor and consider the effects of pH.",Blood pressure variability and outcome in acute ischemic and hemorrhagic stroke: a post hoc analysis of the HeadPoST study.,https://www.ncbi.nlm.nih.gov/pubmed/30894658,Journal of human hypertension,2019 06 10,"The Head Positioning in Acute Stroke Trial (HeadPoST) is a pragmatic, international, cluster crossover randomized trial of 11,093 patients with acute stroke assigned to a lying-flat (0°) or sitting-up (head elevated ≥30°) position. This post hoc analysis aimed to determine the association between blood pressure variability (BPV) and outcomes for patients from a wide range of international clinical settings and how the association was modified by randomized head position. BPV was defined according to the standard criteria, with the key parameter considered the coefficient of variation (CV) of systolic BP (SBP) over 24 h. Outcome was ordinal 90-day Modified Rankin Scale (mRS) score. The association was analyzed by ordinal, logistic regression, hierarchical, mixed models with fixed intervention (lying flat vs. sitting up), and fixed period, random cluster, and random cluster-period, effects. Nine thousand one hundred and fifty six (8324 acute ischemic stroke and 817 intracerebral hemorrhage; mean age 68.1 years; 39.2% women) were included in the analysis. CV of SBP had a significant linear association with unfavorable shift of mRS at 90 days (adjusted odds ratio 1.06, 95% confidence interval 1.02-1.11; P = 0.01). There was no heterogeneity of the association by randomized head positioning. In addition, CV of diastolic BP (DBP) (1.08, 1.03-1.12; P = 0.001) over 24 h post stroke was significantly associated with 3-month poor outcome. The association was more apparent in sitting-up position (1.12, 1.06-1.19) compared with lying-flat position (1.03, 0.98-1.09) (P interaction = 0.005). BPV was associated with adverse stroke outcome, and the magnitude of the association was greater with sitting-up head positioning in terms of DBP variability.",Oligomeric self-association contributes to E2A-PBX1-mediated oncogenesis.,https://www.ncbi.nlm.nih.gov/pubmed/30894657,Scientific reports,2019 04 01,"The PBX1 homeodomain transcription factor is converted by t(1;19) chromosomal translocations in acute leukemia into the chimeric E2A-PBX1 oncoprotein. Fusion with E2A confers potent transcriptional activation and constitutive nuclear localization, bypassing the need for dimerization with protein partners that normally stabilize and regulate import of PBX1 into the nucleus, but the mechanisms underlying its oncogenic activation are incompletely defined. We demonstrate here that E2A-PBX1 self-associates through the PBX1 PBC-B domain of the chimeric protein to form higher-order oligomers in t(1;19) human leukemia cells, and that this property is required for oncogenic activity. Structural and functional studies indicate that self-association facilitates the binding of E2A-PBX1 to DNA. Mutants unable to self-associate are transformation defective, however their oncogenic activity is rescued by the synthetic oligomerization domain of FKBP, which confers conditional transformation properties on E2A-PBX1. In contrast to self-association, PBX1 protein domains that mediate interactions with HOX DNA-binding partners are dispensable. These studies suggest that oligomeric self-association may compensate for the inability of monomeric E2A-PBX1 to stably bind DNA and circumvents protein interactions that otherwise modulate PBX1 stability, nuclear localization, DNA binding, and transcriptional activity. The unique dependence on self-association for E2A-PBX1 oncogenic activity suggests potential approaches for mechanism-based targeted therapies.",New insights into the origin and evolution of α-amylase genes in green plants.,https://www.ncbi.nlm.nih.gov/pubmed/30894656,Scientific reports,2019 03 29,"Gene duplication is a source of genetic materials and evolutionary changes, and has been associated with gene family expansion. Functional divergence of duplicated genes is strongly directed by natural selections such as organism diversification and novel feature acquisition. We show that, plant α-amylase gene family (AMY) is comprised of six subfamilies (AMY1-AMY6) that fell into two ancient phylogenetic lineages (AMY3 and AMY4). Both AMY1 and AMY2 are grass-specific and share a single-copy ancestor, which is derived from grass AMY3 genes that have undergone massive tandem and whole-genome duplications during evolution. Ancestral features of AMY4 and AMY5/AMY6 genes have been retained among four green algal sequences (Chrein_08.g362450, Vocart_0021s0194, Dusali_0430s00012 and Monegl_16464), suggesting a gene duplication event following Chlorophyceae diversification. The observed horizontal gene transfers between plant and bacterial AMYs, and chromosomal locations of AMY3 and AMY4 genes in the most ancestral green body (C. reinhardtii), provide evidences for the monophyletic origin of plant AMYs. Despite subfamily-specific sequence divergence driven by natural selections, the active site and SBS1 are well-conserved across different AMY isoforms. The differentiated electrostatic potentials and hydrogen bands-forming residue polymorphisms, further imply variable digestive abilities for a broad substrates in particular tissues or subcellular localizations.",Descriptive Epidemiology of New Zealand's Highest Mortality Earthquake: Hawke's Bay in 1931.,https://www.ncbi.nlm.nih.gov/pubmed/30894655,Scientific reports,2019 03 29,"In this study we aimed to produce the first detailed analysis of the epidemiology of the severe injury and mortality impacts of the 1931 Hawke's Bay earthquake in New Zealand (NZ). This involved the compilation and analysis of archival data (hospitalisations and deaths) including the examination of 324 death certificates. We found that there were 662 people for whom some hospitalisation data were available at four weeks post-earthquake: 54% were still in hospital, 4% were still classified as ""serious"", and 5% had died (n = 28). Our classification of death certificate data indicated 256 earthquake-attributable deaths and for another five deaths the earthquake was estimated to have played an indirect role. There were 15 buildings associated with three or more deaths each (accounting for 58% of deaths with a known location). Many of these buildings were multi-storey and involved unreinforced masonry - with some of this falling into the street and killing people there (19% of deaths). In contrast, deaths in homes, which were typically of wood construction and single stories, comprised only 3% of deaths. In conclusion, this earthquake had a relatively high injury impact that appears partly related to the lack of regulations for building construction that would mitigate earthquake-related risk. Such regulations continue to be of relevance for New Zealand and for other countries in earthquake zones."

Here we show the first evidence of social deprivation in subsocial decapod crustaceans, based on analysis of video-recorded agonistic encounters of juvenile red swamp crayfish (Procambarus clarkii, Girard). In comparison with maternally incubated juveniles, isolated crayfish had altered repertoires, numbers and frequency of agonistic interactions similar to those described in vertebrates. Our results support the view on the syndrome of social deprivation as a ubiquitous trait in species with developed maternal care across diverse taxa.",Huge decrease of frost frequency in the Mont-Blanc Massif under climate change.,https://www.ncbi.nlm.nih.gov/pubmed/30894642,Scientific reports,2019 03 29,"Mountains are a sensitive indicator of climate change and these areas are an early glimpse of what could happen in lowland environments. Peaking at 4808 m asl, the Mont-Blanc summit, at the boundary between France and Italy, is the highest of the Alps, in Western Europe. Its Massif is world-famous for outdoor and extreme sport activities, especially since the 1924 Olympic games held in Chamonix. Here, we use a novel statistical downscaling approach to regionalize current and future climate change over the Mont-Blanc Massif at an unequalled spatial resolution of 200 m. The algorithm is applied to daily minimum and maximum temperature derived from global climate models used in the fifth assessment report of the International Panel on Climate Change (IPCC). This new high-resolution database allows for a precise quantification of frost occurrence and its evolution until 2100. In the winter season and by the end of the 21st century, under a pessimistic scenario (RCP8.5), frost frequency in the morning could decrease by 30-35 percentage points in the valley of Chamonix, and in the afternoon, similar changes could occur for elevations comprised between 2000 and 3000 m. In summertime, changes are even larger, reaching a huge drop of 45-50 points in the afternoon between 3500 and 4500 m. These changes are much reduced under an optimistic scenario. They could have huge impacts on the environment (glacier shrinking, permafrost degradation, floods, changes in the distribution of species and ecosystems) and societies (summer tourism for climbing and hiking, and winter tourism for skiing).",Electrophysiological correlates of top-down attentional modulation in olfaction.,https://www.ncbi.nlm.nih.gov/pubmed/30894641,Scientific reports,2019 03 29,"The capacity to pay attention is important for the cognitive ability, for example, evaluating an object for its qualities. Attention can selectively prioritize the neural processes that are relevant to a given task. Neuroimaging investigations on human attention are primarily focused on vision to the exclusion of other sensory systems, particularly olfaction. Neural underpinnings of human olfactory attention are still not clearly understood. Here, we combined electroencephalographic measurements of olfactory event related potential with electrical neuroimaging to investigate how the neural responses after inhaling the same odor differ between conditions with varying levels of attention, and, in which brain areas. We examined the neural responses when participants attended to a rose-like odor of phenylethyl alcohol for evaluating its pleasantness versus its passive inhalation. Our results gathered significant evidence for attentional modulation of the olfactory neural response. The most prominent effect was found for the late positive component, P3, of olfactory event related potential within a second from the odor onset. The source reconstruction of this data revealed activations in a distributed network of brain regions predominantly in inferior frontal cortex, insula, and  inferior temporal gyrus. These results suggest that the neuronal modulations from attention to olfactory pleasantness may be subserved by this network.",Glycosaminoglycans influence enzyme activity of MMP2 and MMP2/TIMP3 complex formation - Insights at cellular and molecular level.,https://www.ncbi.nlm.nih.gov/pubmed/30894640,Scientific reports,2019 03 29,"The extracellular matrix (ECM) is a highly dynamic network constantly remodeled by a fine-tuned protein formation and degradation balance. Matrix metalloproteinases (MMPs) constitute key orchestrators of ECM degradation. Their activity is controlled by tissue inhibitors of metalloproteinases (TIMPs) and glycosaminoglycans (GAG). Here, we investigated the molecular interplay of MMP2 with different GAG (chondroitin sulfate, hyaluronan (HA), sulfated hyaluronan (SH) and heparin (HE)) and the impact of GAG on MMP2/TIMP3 complex formation using in vitro-experiments with human bone marrow stromal cells, in silico docking and molecular dynamics simulations. SH and HE influenced MMP2 and TIMP3 protein levels and MMP2 activity. Only SH supported the alignment of both proteins in fibrillar-like structures, which, based on our molecular models, would be due to a stabilization of the interactions between MMP2-hemopexin domain and TIMP3-C-terminal tail. Dependent on the temporal sequential order in which the final ternary complex was formed, our models indicated that SH and HA can affect TIMP3-induced MMP2 inhibition through precluding or supporting their interactions, respectively. Our combined experimental and theoretical approach provides valuable new insights on how GAG interfere with MMP2 activity and MMP2/TIMP3 complex formation. The results obtained evidence GAG as promising molecules for fine-balanced intervention of ECM remodeling.",Extensive use of Fish Aggregating Devices together with environmental change influenced the spatial distribution of a tropical affinity fish.,https://www.ncbi.nlm.nih.gov/pubmed/30894639,Scientific reports,2019 03 29,"Since the early 1990s of last century the spread of Caranx crysos a thermophilic fish species in the Mediterranean Sea has increased due to sea warming.

Here we used a multidisciplinary approach to investigate the influence of environmental change and FAD presence on the spatial distribution of the tropical affinity fish species Caranx crysos across the Mediterranean Sea. Data suggested that the presence of C. crysos has increased progressively since 1990 towards the northwest side of the Mediterranean Sea, with the greatest number of recent findings occurring in zones with higher densities of FADs. The spatial distribution models show how the extensive use of FADs in combination with changes in environmental conditions may have indirectly facilitated the spread of the thermophillic C. crysos population across the Mediterranean Sea.",What is the most effective local anesthesia for transrectal ultrasonography-guided biopsy of the prostate? A systematic review and network meta-analysis of 47 randomized clinical trials.,https://www.ncbi.nlm.nih.gov/pubmed/30894638,Scientific reports,2019 03 29,"We aimed to compare the effectiveness of various local anesthetic methods for controlling prostate biopsy (PBx) related pain using network meta-analysis. Literature searches were performed on PubMed/Medline, Embase, and Cochrane Library up to March 2018. Forty-seven randomized controlled trials, in which the effectiveness of PBx-related pain was investigated using a visual analogue scale after various local anesthetic methods, were included. The local anesthetic methods included intraprostatic local anesthesia (IPLA), intrarectal local anesthesia (IRLA), intravenous sedation (IVS), periprostatic nerve block (PNB), pelvic plexus block (PPB), and spinal anesthesia (SPA). Eight pairwise meta-analyses and network meta-analyses with 21 comparisons were performed. All modalities, except single use of IPLA and IRLA, were more effective than placebo. Our results demonstrate that PNB + IVS (rank 1) and SPA (rank 2) were the most effective methods for pain control. The followings are in order of PPB + IRLA, PNB + IPLA, PPB, PNB + IRLA, IVS, and PNB. In conclusion, the most effective way to alleviate PBx-related pain appears to be PNB + IVS and SPA. However, a potential increase in medical cost and additional risk of morbidities should be considered. In the current outpatient setting, PPB + IRLA, PNB + IPLA, PPB, PNB + IRLA, and PNB methods are potentially more acceptable options.",Plasma ATG5 is increased in Alzheimer's disease.,https://www.ncbi.nlm.nih.gov/pubmed/30894637,Scientific reports,2019 03 29,"Alzheimer's disease (AD) is a major cause of dementia. Growing evidence suggests that dysregulation of autophagy, a cellular mechanism essential for self-digestion of damaged proteins and organelles, is involved in neurological degenerative diseases including AD. Previously, we reported that autophagosomes are increased in the brains of AD mouse model. However, the plasma levels of autophagic markers have not yet been investigated in patients with AD. In this study, we investigated the expression of autophagy-related genes 5 and 12 (ATG5 and ATG12, respectively) in cells in vitro upon amyloid-beta (Aβ) treatment and in the plasma of AD patients. ATG5-ATG12 complex levels were increased in primary rat cortical neurons and human umbilical vein endothelial cells after Aβ treatment. Furthermore, we compared plasma from 69 patients with dementia, 82 patients with mild cognitive impairment (MCI), and 127 cognitively normal control participants. Plasma levels of ATG5 were significantly elevated in patients with dementia (149.3 ± 7.5 ng/mL) or MCI (152.9 ± 6.9 ng/mL) compared with the control subjects (129.0 ± 4.1 ng/mL) (p = 0.034, p = 0.016, respectively). Our results indicate that alterations in the plasma ATG5 levels might be a potential biomarker in patients at risk for AD.",Automated segmentation of the corneal endothelium in a large set of 'real-world' specular microscopy images using the U-Net architecture.,https://www.ncbi.nlm.nih.gov/pubmed/30894636,Scientific reports,2019 03 29,"Monitoring the density of corneal endothelial cells (CEC) is essential in the management of corneal diseases. Its manual calculation is time consuming and prone to errors. U-Net, a neural network for biomedical image segmentation, has shown promising results in the automated segmentation of images of healthy corneas and good quality. The purpose of this study was to assess its performance in ""real-world"" CEC images (variable quality, different ophthalmologic diseases). The outcome measures were: precision and recall of the extraction of CEC, correctness of CEC density estimation, detection of ungradable images. A classical approach based on grayscale morphology and water shedding was pursued for comparison. There was good agreement between the automated image analysis and the manual annotation from the U-Net. R-square from Pearson's correlation was 0.96. Recall of CEC averaged 0.34 and precision 0.84. The U-Net correctly predicted the CEC density in a large set of images of healthy and diseased corneas, including images of poor quality. It robustly ignored image regions with poor visibility of CEC. The classical approach, however, did not provide acceptable results. R-square from Pearson's correlation with the ground truth was as low as 0.35.",Dietary Sargassum fusiforme improves memory and reduces amyloid plaque load in an Alzheimer's disease mouse model.,https://www.ncbi.nlm.nih.gov/pubmed/30894635,Scientific reports,2019 03 29,"Activation of liver X receptors (LXRs) by synthetic agonists was found to improve cognition in Alzheimer's disease (AD) mice. However, these LXR agonists induce hypertriglyceridemia and hepatic steatosis, hampering their use in the clinic. We hypothesized that phytosterols as LXR agonists enhance cognition in AD without affecting plasma and hepatic triglycerides. Phytosterols previously reported to activate LXRs were tested in a luciferase-based LXR reporter assay. Using this assay, we found that phytosterols commonly present in a Western type diet in physiological concentrations do not activate LXRs. However, a lipid extract of the 24(S)-Saringosterol-containing seaweed Sargassum fusiforme did potently activate LXRβ. Dietary supplementation of crude Sargassum fusiforme or a Sargassum fusiforme-derived lipid extract to AD mice significantly improved short-term memory and reduced hippocampal Aβ plaque load by 81%. Notably, none of the side effects typically induced by full synthetic LXR agonists were observed. In contrast, administration of the synthetic LXRα activator, AZ876, did not improve cognition and resulted in the accumulation of lipid droplets in the liver. Administration of Sargassum fusiforme-derived 24(S)-Saringosterol to cultured neurons reduced the secretion of Aβ42. Moreover, conditioned medium from 24(S)-Saringosterol-treated astrocytes added to microglia increased phagocytosis of Aβ. Our data show that Sargassum fusiforme improves cognition and alleviates AD pathology. This may be explained at least partly by 24(S)-Saringosterol-mediated LXRβ activation."

However, there are considerable uncertainties in future drought projections. Here, we focus on agricultural drought by analyzing surface soil moisture outputs from CMIP5 multi-model ensembles (MMEs) under RCP2.6, RCP4.5, RCP6.0, and RCP8.5 scenarios. First, the annual mean soil moisture by the end of the 21st century shows statistically significant large-scale drying and limited areas of wetting for all scenarios, with stronger drying as the strength of radiative forcing increases. Second, the MME mean spatial extent of severe drought is projected to increase for all regions and all future RCP scenarios, and most notably in Central America (CAM), Europe and Mediterranean (EUM), Tropical South America (TSA), and South Africa (SAF). Third, the model uncertainty presents the largest source of uncertainty (over 80%) across the entire 21st century among the three sources of uncertainty: internal variability, model uncertainty, and scenario uncertainty. Finally, we find that the spatial pattern and magnitude of annual and seasonal signal to noise (S/N) in soil moisture anomalies do not change significantly by lead time, indicating that the spreads of uncertainties become larger as the signals become stronger.",In vitro micro-physiological model of the inflamed human adipose tissue for immune-metabolic analysis in type II diabetes.,https://www.ncbi.nlm.nih.gov/pubmed/30894623,Scientific reports,2019 03 29,"Chronic inflammation mediated by the interaction of immune cells and adipocytes is a key underlying factor in obesity-associated type 2 diabetes mellitus (T2DM). Therefore, methods to investigate adipocyte-immune cells interaction and their immuno-metabolic status in obese/T2DM subjects not only serve as an early indicator of disease development but also provide an insight into disease mechanism. A microfluidic-based in vitro model of the human adipose that is interfaced with a co-culture of immune cell has been developed for in vitro immune-metabolic analysis. This miniaturized system integrates a biologically active in vitro cellular system within a perfusion-based microfluidic device for mimicking the major processes that characterize the interaction of adipose tissue with immune cells. A viable immune competent model of the adipocytes/PBMCs co-culture has been demonstrated and characterized. Our testing results showed that the inflammatory cytokine profile obtained from the on-chip culture agrees with those from static transwell based co-culture with more intense responses observed in the chip-based system. The microfluidic chip also allows time-resolved measurement of cytokines that provide reliable data and detailed mechanisms of inflammation. In addition, glucose uptake by the adipocytes from the chip-based cultures showed correlated insulin responsivity/resistivity to the expression of the cytokine profile in different dynamic culture conditions. Testing of the known diabetic drug, metformin, and neutraceutical compound, omega-3, on-chip show agreeable results as compared to the previously reported data. This organotypic culture system offers a physiologically relevant model that exhibits a key characteristic of type 2 diabetic adipose tissues and can be used to study the T2DM mechanisms and diabetic drug screening.",Non-canonical WNT-signaling controls differentiation of lymphatics and extension lymphangiogenesis via RAC and JNK signaling.,https://www.ncbi.nlm.nih.gov/pubmed/30894622,Scientific reports,2019 03 29,"Development of lymphatics takes place during embryogenesis, wound healing, inflammation, and cancer. We previously showed that Wnt5a is an essential regulator of lymphatic development in the dermis of mice, however, the mechanisms of action remained unclear. Here, whole-mount immunostaining shows that embryonic day (ED) 18.5 Wnt5a-null mice possess non-functional, cyst-like and often blood-filled lymphatics, in contrast to slender, interconnected lymphatic networks of Wnt5a+/- and wild-type (wt) mice. We then compared lymphatic endothelial cell (LEC) proliferation during ED 12.5, 14.5, 16.5 and 18.5 between Wnt5a-/-, Wnt5a+/- and wt-mice. We did not observe any differences, clearly showing that Wnt5a acts independently of proliferation. Transmission electron microscopy revealed multiple defects of LECs in Wnt5a-null mice, such as malformed inter-endothelial junctions, ruffled cell membrane, intra-luminal bulging of nuclei and cytoplasmic processes. Application of WNT5A protein to ex vivo cultures of dorsal thoracic dermis from ED 15.5 Wnt5a-null mice induced flow-independent development of slender, elongated lymphatic networks after 2 days, in contrast to controls showing an immature lymphatic plexus. Reversely, the application of the WNT-secretion inhibitor LGK974 on ED 15.5 wt-mouse dermis significantly prevented lymphatic network elongation. Correspondingly, tube formation assays with human dermal LECs in vitro revealed increased tube length after WNT5A application. To study the intracellular signaling of WNT5A we used LEC scratch assays. Thereby, inhibition of autocrine WNTs suppressed horizontal migration, whereas application of WNT5A to inhibitor-treated LECs promoted migration. Inhibition of the RHO-GTPase RAC, or the c-Jun N-terminal kinase JNK significantly reduced migration, whereas inhibitors of the protein kinase ROCK did not. WNT5A induced transient phosphorylation of JNK in LECs, which could be inhibited by RAC- and JNK-inhibitors. Our data show that WNT5A induces formation of elongated lymphatic networks through proliferation-independent WNT-signaling via RAC and JNK. Non-canonical WNT-signaling is a major mechanism of extension lymphangiogenesis, and also controls differentiation of lymphatics.",Unveiling high specific energy supercapacitor from layer-by-layer assembled polypyrrole/graphene oxide|polypyrrole/manganese oxide electrode material.,https://www.ncbi.nlm.nih.gov/pubmed/30894621,Scientific reports,2019 03 29,"A novel layer-by-layer (LBL) based electrode material for supercapacitor consists of polypyrrole/graphene oxide and polypyrrole/manganese oxide (PPy/GO|PPy/MnO2) has prepared by electrochemical deposition. The formation of LBL assembled nanocomposite is confirmed by Fourier transform infrared spectroscopy, Raman spectroscopy and X-ray diffraction. The field emission scanning electron microscopy images clearly showed that PPy/MnO2 was uniformly coated on PPy/GO. The PPy/GO|PPy/MnO2 symmetrical supercapacitor has revealed outstanding supercapacitive performance with a high specific capacitance of 786.6 F/g, an exceptionally high specific energy of 52.3 Wh/kg at a specific power of 1392.9 W/kg and preserve a good cycling stability over 1000 cycles. It is certain that PPy/GO|PPy/MnO2 has an extraordinary perspective as an electrode for future supercapacitor developments. This finding contributes to a significant impact on the evolution of electrochemical supercapacitor.",Epitope mapping of diverse influenza Hemagglutinin drug candidates using HDX-MS.,https://www.ncbi.nlm.nih.gov/pubmed/30894620,Scientific reports,2019 03 29,"Epitope characterization is critical for elucidating the mechanism of action of drug candidates. However, traditional high-resolution epitope mapping techniques are not well suited for screening numerous drug candidates recognizing a similar target. Here, we use Hydrogen-Deuterium Exchange Mass Spectrometry (HDX-MS) to explore the conformational impact of diverse drug molecules binding on Hemagglutinin (HA), the major surface antigen of influenza viruses. We optimized a semi-automated HDX-MS workflow to systematically probe distantly related HA subtypes in complex with 4 different drug candidates, ranging from a monoclonal antibody to a small synthetic peptide. This fast, cost-effective HDX-MS epitope mapping approach accurately determined the main antigenic site in all cases. Moreover, our studies reveal distinct changes in the local conformational dynamics of HA associated to the molecular mechanism of neutralization, establishing a marker for broad anti-HA activity. Taken together, these findings highlight the potential for HDX-MS epitope mapping-based screening to identify promising candidates against HA at early stages of drug discovery.",Honey bee colony performance and health are enhanced by apiary proximity to US Conservation Reserve Program (CRP) lands.,https://www.ncbi.nlm.nih.gov/pubmed/30894619,Scientific reports,2019 03 29,"Honey bee colony performance and health are intimately linked to the foraging environment. Recent evidence suggests that the US Conservation Reserve Program (CRP) has a positive impact on environmental suitability for supporting honey bee apiaries. However, relatively little is known about the influence of habitat conservation efforts on honey bee colony health. Identifying specific factors that influence bee health at the colony level incorporates longitudinal monitoring of physiology across diverse environments. Using a pooled-sampling method to overcome individual variation, we monitored colony-level molecular biomarkers during critical pre- and post-winter time points. Major categories of colony health (nutrition, oxidative stress resistance, and immunity) were impacted by apiary site. In general, apiaries within foraging distance of CRP lands showed improved performance and higher gene expression of vitellogenin (vg), a nutritionally regulated protein with central storage and regulatory functions. Mirroring vg levels, gene transcripts encoding antioxidant enzymes and immune-related proteins were typically higher in colonies exposed to CRP environments. Our study highlights the potential of CRP lands to improve pollinator health and the utility of colony-level molecular diagnostics to assess environmental suitability for honey bees.",Repeat decompression and fusions following posterolateral fusion versus posterior/transforaminal lumbar interbody fusion for lumbar spondylosis: a national database study.,https://www.ncbi.nlm.nih.gov/pubmed/30894618,Scientific reports,2019 03 29,"There is a low incidence of reoperation after surgery. It is difficult to detect statistical differences between reoperation rates of different lumbar fusion surgeries. National population-based databases provide large, longitudinally followed cohorts that may help overcome this challenge. The purpose is to compare the repeat decompression and fusion rate after surgery for degenerative lumbar diseases according to different surgical fusion procedures based on national population-based databases and elucidate the risk factor for repeat decompression and fusions. The Korean Health Insurance Review & Assessment Service database was used. Patients diagnosed with degenerative lumbar diseases and who underwent single-level fusion surgeries between January 1, 2011, and June 30, 2016, were included. They were divided into two groups based on procedure codes: posterolateral fusion or posterior/transforaminal lumbar interbody fusion. The primary endpoint was repeat decompression and fusion. Age, sex, the presence of diabetes, osteoporosis, associated comorbidities, and hospital types were considered potential confounding factors. The repeat decompression and fusion rate was not different between the patients who underwent posterolateral fusion and those who underwent posterior/transforaminal lumbar interbody fusion. Old age, male sex, and hospital type were noted to be risk factors. The incidence of repeat decompression and fusion was independent on the fusion method.",Anti-alcohol abuse drug disulfiram inhibits human PHGDH via disruption of its active tetrameric form through a specific cysteine oxidation.,https://www.ncbi.nlm.nih.gov/pubmed/30894617,Scientific reports,2019 03 29,"Due to rising costs and the difficulty to identify new targets, drug repurposing appears as a viable strategy for the development of new anti-cancer treatments. Although the interest of disulfiram (DSF), an anti-alcohol drug, to treat cancer was reported for many years, it is only very recently that one anticancer mechanism-of-action was highlighted. This would involve the inhibition of the p97 segregase adaptor NPL4, which is essential for the turnover of proteins involved in multiple regulatory and stress-response intracellular pathways. However, recently DSF was also reported as one of the first phosphoglycerate dehydrogenase (PHGDH) inhibitors, a tetrameric enzyme catalyzing the initial step of the serine synthetic pathway that is highly expressed in numerous cancer types. Here, we investigated the structure-activity relationships (SAR) of PHGDH inhibition by disulfiram analogues as well as the mechanism of action of DSF on PHGDH via enzymatic and cell-based evaluation, mass spectrometric and mutagenesis experiments.",The use of Leaf Surface Contact Cues During Oviposition Explains Field Preferences in the Willow Sawfly Nematus Oligospilus.,https://www.ncbi.nlm.nih.gov/pubmed/30894616,Scientific reports,2019 03 29,"After an insect herbivore has reached its host plant, contact cues from the leaf surface often determine host acceptance. We studied contact cues during oviposition behavior of a willow pest, the sawfly Nematus oligospilus (Hymenoptera: Tenthredinidae), a specialist feeder on Salix (Salicaceae) trees, and how it determines oviposition preference in lab and field conditions. We described the sequence of behaviors that lead to egg laying on the most and least preferred willow species. Then we studied the morphology of chemosensory structures present on the female antenna, cerci and ovipositor. Since phenolic glycosides (PGs) are the main secondary metabolites present in Salicaceae species, we investigated their role in host acceptance. We quantified these compounds in different willow species and correlated PG content with oviposition preference under lab and natural field conditions. We demonstrated a major role for contact cues in triggering N. oligospilus egg laying on the leaf surface of preferred willow genotypes. Firstly cues are sensed by antennae, determining to leave or stay on the leaf. After that, sensing is performed by abdominal cerci, which finally triggers egg laying. The lack of PGs in non-preferred species and the significant correlation observed between PGs, natural damage and oviposition preference suggest a role for these compounds in host selection. Our study suggests that in specialist feeders, secondary compounds normally acting as defenses can actually act as a susceptibility factor by triggering specific insect behavior for oviposition. These defensive compounds could be selected against to increase resistance.",The VQ motif-containing proteins in the diploid and octoploid strawberry.,https://www.ncbi.nlm.nih.gov/pubmed/30894615,Scientific reports,2019 03 29,"The plant VQ motif-containing proteins are a recently discovered class of plant regulatory proteins interacting with WRKY transcription factors capable of modulate their activity as transcriptional regulators. The short VQ motif (FxxhVQxhTG) is the main element in the WRKY-VQ interaction, whereas a newly identified variable upstream amino acid motif appears to be determinant for the WRKY specificity. The VQ family has been studied in several species and seems to play important roles in a variety of biological processes, including response to biotic and abiotic stresses. Here, we present a systematic study of the VQ family in both diploid (Fragaria vesca) and octoploid (Fragaria x ananassa) strawberry species. Thus, twenty-five VQ-encoding genes were identified and twenty-three were further confirmed by gene expression analysis in different tissues and fruit ripening stages. Their expression profiles were also studied in F. ananassa fruits affected by anthracnose, caused by the ascomycete fungus Colletotrichum, a major pathogen of strawberry, and in response to the phytohormones salicylic acid and methyl-jasmonate, which are well established as central stress signals to regulate defence responses to pathogens. This comprehensive analysis sheds light for a better understanding of putative implications of members of the VQ family in the defence mechanisms against this major pathogen in strawberry."

In particular, previous genetic studies of patients with nephrotic syndrome identified mutations in Nup107 that impaired the expression or the localization of its direct partner at nuclear pores, Nup133. In the present study, we characterized the zebrafish nup133 orthologous gene and its expression pattern during larval development. Using a morpholino-mediated gene knockdown, we show that partial depletion of Nup133 in zebrafish larvae leads to the formation of kidney cysts, a phenotype that can be rescued by co-injection of wild type mRNA. Analysis of different markers for tubular and glomerular development shows that the overall kidney development is not affected by nup133 knockdown. Likewise, no gross defect in nuclear pore complex assembly was observed in these nup133 morphants. On the other hand, nup133 downregulation results in proteinuria and moderate foot process effacement, mimicking some of the abnormalities typically featured by patients with nephrotic syndrome. These data indicate that nup133 is a new gene required for proper glomerular structure and function in zebrafish.",Autaptic cultures of human induced neurons as a versatile platform for studying synaptic function and neuronal morphology.,https://www.ncbi.nlm.nih.gov/pubmed/30894602,Scientific reports,2019 03 29,"Recently developed technology to differentiate induced pluripotent stem cells (iPSCs) into human induced neurons (iNs) provides an exciting opportunity to study the function of human neurons. However, functional characterisations of iNs have been hampered by the reliance on mass culturing protocols which do not allow assessment of synaptic release characteristics and neuronal morphology at the individual cell level with quantitative precision. Here, we have developed for the first time a protocol to generate autaptic cultures of iPSC-derived iNs. We show that our method efficiently generates mature, autaptic iNs with robust spontaneous and action potential-driven synaptic transmission. The synaptic responses are sensitive to modulation by metabotropic receptor agonists as well as potentiation by acute phorbol ester application. Finally, we demonstrate loss of evoked and spontaneous release by Unc13A knockdown. This culture system provides a versatile platform allowing for quantitative and integrative assessment of morphophysiological and molecular parameters underlying human synaptic transmission.",Eco-physiological responses of copepods and pteropods to ocean warming and acidification.,https://www.ncbi.nlm.nih.gov/pubmed/30894601,Scientific reports,2019 03 29,"We compare physiological responses of the crustacean copepod Calanus pacificus and pelagic pteropod mollusk Limacina helicina to ocean temperatures and pH by measuring biomarkers of oxidative stress, antioxidant defences, and the activity of the respiratory electron transport system in organisms collected on the 2016 West Coast Ocean Acidification cruise in the California Current System. Copepods and pteropods exhibited strong but divergent responses in the same habitat; copepods had higher oxygen-reactive absorbance capacity, glutathione-S-transferase, and total glutathione content. The ratio between reduced to oxidised glutathione was higher in copepods than in pteropods, indicating lower oxidative stress in copepods. Pteropods showed higher activities of glutathione reductase, catalase, and lipid peroxidation, indicating increased antioxidant defences and oxidative stress. Thus, the antioxidant defence system of the copepods has a greater capacity to respond to oxidative stress, while pteropods already face severe stress and show limited capacity to deal with further changes. The results suggest that copepods have higher adaptive potential, owing to their stronger vertical migration behaviour and efficient glutathione metabolism, whereas pteropods run the risk of oxidative stress and mortality under high CO2 conditions. Our results provide a unique dataset and evidence of stress-inducing mechanisms behind pteropod ocean acidification responses.",Optimization and evaluation of a non-invasive tool for peste des petits ruminants surveillance and control.,https://www.ncbi.nlm.nih.gov/pubmed/30894600,Scientific reports,2019 03 29,"Peste des petits ruminants (PPR) is a highly contagious and devastating viral disease affecting mainly sheep and goats, but also a large number of wild species within the order Artiodactyla. A better understanding of PPR transmission dynamics in multi-host systems is necessary to efficiently control the disease, in particular where wildlife and livestock co-occur. Notably, the role of wildlife in PPR epidemiology is still not clearly understood. Non-invasive strategies to detect PPR infection without the need for animal handling could greatly facilitate research on PPR epidemiology and management of the disease in atypical hosts and in complex field situations. Here, we describe optimized methods for the direct detection of PPR virus genetic material and antigen in fecal samples. We use these methods to determine the detection window of PPR in fecal samples, and compare the sensitivity of these methods to standard invasive sampling and PPR diagnostic methods using field samples collected at a wildlife-livestock interface in Africa. Our results show that quantitative reverse transcription PCR (RT-QPCR) amplification of PPRV from fecal swabs has good sensitivity in comparison to ocular swabs. Animals infected by PPRV could be identified relatively early on and during the whole course of infection based on fecal samples using RT-QPCR. Partial gene sequences could also be retrieved in some cases, from both fecal and ocular samples, providing important information about virus origin and relatedness to other PPRV strains. Non-invasive strategies for PPRV surveillance could provide important data to fill major gaps in our knowledge of the multi-host PPR epidemiology.",Global Variation of Nutritional Status in Children Undergoing Chronic Peritoneal Dialysis: A Longitudinal Study of the International Pediatric Peritoneal Dialysis Network.,https://www.ncbi.nlm.nih.gov/pubmed/30894599,Scientific reports,2019 03 29,"While children approaching end-stage kidney disease (ESKD) are considered at risk of uremic anorexia and underweight they are also exposed to the global obesity epidemic. We sought to investigate the variation of nutritional status in children undergoing chronic peritoneal dialysis (CPD) around the globe. The distribution and course of body mass index (BMI) standard deviation score over time was examined prospectively in 1001 children and adolescents from 35 countries starting CPD who were followed in the International Pediatric PD Network (IPPN) Registry. The overall prevalence of underweight, and overweight/obesity at start of CPD was 8.9% and 19.7%, respectively. Underweight was most prevalent in South and Southeast Asia (20%), Central Europe (16.7%) and Turkey (15.2%), whereas overweight and obesity were most common in the Middle East (40%) and the US (33%). BMI SDS at PD initiation was associated positively with current eGFR and gastrostomy feeding prior to PD start. Over the course of PD BMI SDS tended to increase on CPD in underweight and normal weight children, whereas it decreased in initially overweight patients. In infancy, mortality risk was amplified by obesity, whereas in older children mortality was markedly increased in association with underweight. Both underweight and overweight are prevalent in pediatric ESKD, with the prevalence varying across the globe. Late dialysis start is associated with underweight, while enteral feeding can lead to obesity. Nutritional abnormalities tend to attenuate with time on dialysis. Mortality risk appears increased with obesity in infants and with underweight in older children.",Compact Localized States in Engineered Flat-Band [Formula: see text] Metamaterials.,https://www.ncbi.nlm.nih.gov/pubmed/30894598,Scientific reports,2019 03 29,"The conditions leading to flat dispersionless frequency bands in truly one-dimensional parity-time ([Formula: see text]) symmetric metamaterials comprised of split-ring resonators (SRRs) arranged in a binary pattern are obtained analytically.

For sets of parameters which values are tailored to flatten the upper band of the spectrum, the solution of the corresponding quadratic eigenvalue problem reveals the existence of compact, two-site localized eigenmodes.

To our knowledge, however, little information is available on the composition, diversity, and interaction of endophytic bacterial communities in plants struggling for existence in the extreme environments of Chile, such as the Atacama Desert (AD) and Patagonia (PAT). The main objective of the present study was to analyze and compare the composition of endophytic bacterial communities associated with roots and leaves of representative plants growing in Chilean extreme environments. The plants sampled were: Distichlis spicate and Pluchea absinthioides from the AD, and Gaultheria mucronata and Hieracium pilosella from PAT. The abundance and composition of their endophytic bacterial communities was determined by quantitative PCR and high-throughput sequencing of 16S rRNA, respectively. Results indicated that there was a greater abundance of 16S rRNA genes in plants from PAT (1013 to 1014 copies g-1 DNA), compared with those from AD (1010 to 1012 copies g-1 DNA). In the AD, a greater bacterial diversity, as estimated by Shannon index, was found in P. absinthioides, compared with D. spicata. In both ecosystems, the greater relative abundances of endophytes were mainly attributed to members of the phyla Proteobacteria (14% to 68%), Firmicutes (26% to 41%), Actinobacteria (6 to 23%) and Bacteroidetes (1% to 21%). Our observations revealed that most of operational taxonomic units (OTUs) were not shared between tissue samples of different plant species in both locations, suggesting the effect of the plant genotype (species) on the bacterial endophyte communities in Chilean extreme environments, where Bacillaceae and Enterobacteriacea could serve as keystone taxa as revealed our linear discriminant analysis.",Carbohydrate Metabolic Compensation Coupled to High Tolerance to Oxidative Stress in Ticks.,https://www.ncbi.nlm.nih.gov/pubmed/30894596,Scientific reports,2019 03 29,"Reactive oxygen species (ROS) are natural byproducts of metabolism that have toxic effects well documented in mammals. In hematophagous arthropods, however, these processes are not largely understood. Here, we describe that Rhipicephalus microplus ticks and embryonic cell line (BME26) employ an adaptive metabolic compensation mechanism that confers tolerance to hydrogen peroxide (H2O2) at concentrations too high for others organisms. Tick survival and reproduction are not affected by H2O2 exposure, while BME26 cells morphology was only mildly altered by the treatment. Furthermore, H2O2-tolerant BME26 cells maintained their proliferative capacity unchanged. We evaluated several genes involved in gluconeogenesis, glycolysis, and pentose phosphate pathway, major pathways for carbohydrate catabolism and anabolism, describing a metabolic mechanism that explains such tolerance. Genetic and catalytic control of the genes and enzymes associated with these pathways are modulated by glucose uptake and energy resource availability. Transient increase in ROS levels, oxygen consumption, and ROS-scavenger enzymes, as well as decreased mitochondrial superoxide levels, were indicative of cell adaptation to high H2O2 exposure, and suggested a tolerance strategy developed by BME26 cells to cope with oxidative stress. Moreover, NADPH levels increased upon H2O2 challenge, and this phenomenon was sustained mainly by G6PDH activity. Interestingly, G6PDH knockdown in BME26 cells did not impair H2O2 tolerance, but generated an increase in NADP-ICDH transcription. In agreement with the hypothesis of a compensatory NADPH production in these cells, NADP-ICDH knockdown increased G6PDH relative transcript level. The present study unveils the first metabolic evidence of an adaptive mechanism to cope with high H2O2 exposure and maintain redox balance in ticks.",Human herpesvirus infections and dementia or mild cognitive impairment: a systematic review and meta-analysis.,https://www.ncbi.nlm.nih.gov/pubmed/30894595,Scientific reports,2019 04 01,"Interest is growing in the role of infectious agents in the pathogenesis of dementia, but current evidence is limited. We conducted a systematic review and meta-analysis to investigate the effect of any of eight human herpesviruses on development of dementia or mild cognitive impairment (MCI). We searched the Cochrane Library, Embase, Global Health, Medline, PsycINFO, Scopus, Web of Science, clinical trials registers and grey literature sources from inception to December 2017 for observational studies with cohort, case control or self-controlled designs, or randomised controlled trials of interventions against herpesviruses. Pooled effect estimates and 95% confidence intervals (CIs) were generated through random effects meta-analyses across studies with the same design, outcome, and virus type, method and site of measurement. We included 57 studies across various geographic settings. Past infection with herpesviruses, measured by IgG seropositivity, was generally not associated with dementia risk. A single cohort study rated moderate quality showed an association between varicella zoster virus reactivation (ophthalmic zoster) and incident dementia (HR 2.97; 95%CI, 1.89 to 4.66). Recent infection with, or reactivation of, herpes simplex virus type 1 or type 1/2 unspecified, cytomegalovirus and human herpes virus-6 measured by serum IgM, high titre IgG or clinical disease may be associated with dementia or MCI, though results were inconsistent across studies and overall evidence rated very low quality. Longitudinal population studies with robust repeated virus measurements taken sufficiently proximal to dementia onset are needed to establish whether, when and among whom herpesviruses affect dementia risk.","Calcium electroporation and electrochemotherapy for cancer treatment: Importance of cell membrane composition investigated by lipidomics, calorimetry and in vitro efficacy.",https://www.ncbi.nlm.nih.gov/pubmed/30894594,Scientific reports,2019 03 29,"Calcium electroporation is a novel anti-cancer treatment investigated in clinical trials. We explored cell sensitivity to calcium electroporation and electroporation with bleomycin, using viability assays at different time and temperature points, as well as heat calorimetry, lipidomics, and flow cytometry. Three cell lines: HT29 (colon cancer), MDA-MB231 (breast cancer), and HDF-n (normal fibroblasts) were investigated for; (a) cell survival dependent on time of addition of drug relative to electroporation (1.2 kV/cm, 8 pulses, 99 µs, 1 Hz), at different temperatures (37 °C, 27 °C, 17 °C); (b) heat capacity profiles obtained by differential scanning calorimetry without added calcium; (c) lipid composition by mass spectrometry; (d) phosphatidylserine in the plasma membrane outer leaflet using flow cytometry. Temperature as well as time of drug administration affected treatment efficacy in HT29 and HDF-n cells, but not MDA-MB231 cells. Interestingly the HT29 cell line displayed a higher phase transition temperature (approximately 20 °C) versus 14 °C (HDF-n) and 15 °C (MDA-MB231). Furthermore the HT29 cell membranes had a higher ratio of ethers to esters, and a higher expression of phosphatidylserine in the outer leaflet. In conclusion, lipid composition and heat capacity of the membrane might influence permeabilisation of cells and thereby the effect of calcium electroporation and electrochemotherapy."

Their contribution, however, to a wider understanding of the evolution of the trochozoans (encompassing the annelids as well as such groups as the brachiopods and molluscs) remains limited. Thus the early annelids had been linked to a variety of cataphract Cambrian metazoans, notably Wiwaxia and the halkieriids, but recent work assigns such fossils to stem-group molluscs. Here we report two new annelids from the Lower Cambrian Chengjiang Lagerstätte, South China. Ipoliknus avitus n. gen., n. sp. is biramous with neurochaetae and notochaetae, but significantly also bears dorsal spinose sclerites and dorso-lateral dentate sclerites. Adelochaeta sinensis n. gen., n. sp. is unique amongst Cambrian polychaetes in possessing the rod-like supports of the parapodia known as aciculae. This supports phylogenetic placement of Adelochaeta as sister to some more derived aciculate Palaeozoic taxa, but in contrast Ipoliknus is recovered as the most basal of the stem-group annelids. Sclerites and chaetae of I. avitus are interpreted respectively as the remnants and derivatives of a once more extensive cataphract covering that was a characteristic of more primitive trochozoans. The two sets of chaetae (noto- and neurochaetae) and two sets of sclerites (spinose and dentate) suggest that in a pre-annelid an earlier and more complete scleritome may have consisted of four zones of sclerites. Other cataphract taxa from the Lower Palaeozoic show a variety of scleritome configurations but establishing direct links with such basal annelids as Ipoliknus at present must remain conjectural.",Noninvasive Self-diagnostic Device for Tear Collection and Glucose Measurement.,https://www.ncbi.nlm.nih.gov/pubmed/30894582,Scientific reports,2019 03 29,"We propose a noninvasive, self-diagnostic device that enables safe tear collection and glucose measurement. The device described herein was manufactured by tight assembly of a lid for tear collection in conjunction with a strip-type glucose sensor. The lid was designed to be in contact with the inferior palpebral conjunctiva for tear collection and was thus designed to possess a proper contact area and rounded boundaries to avoid eye tissue damage. For the strip-type glucose sensor, we employed a commercially available electrochemical sensor (Accu-Chek test strips), which was modified to reduce the volume of the reaction chamber (0.4 μl) for a small amount of collected tear fluid. When tested with in vivo animal models, the device was able to collect tear fluid in a relatively short time (<2 s) without causing eye tissue damage, and the device allowed the collected tear fluid to be delivered to the sensor for measurement of tear glucose concentrations. The blood glucose concentrations estimated with the tear glucose concentrations obtained with the device exhibited a high correlation with those actually measured with a clinically available glucometer (R2 = 0.9617).",mtDNA analysis confirms the endangered Kashmir musk deer extends its range to Nepal.,https://www.ncbi.nlm.nih.gov/pubmed/30894581,Scientific reports,2019 03 29,"Musk deer Moschus spp. are endemic to the high mountain forests of central Asia. The taxonomic status of musk deer in the central and western Himalayas is poorly understood. We investigated the phylogenetic relationship of musk deer from the central and western Himalayas based on mitochondrial genomic data of Cytochrome b (380 bps) and D-loop (1000 bps). Our results distinguished two divergent lineages using higher bootstrap support (bs) values from the Maximum likelihood and Bayesian posterior probabilities (bpp). Both the Manang and Kaski lineages from central Nepal are confirmed as Himalayan musk deer Moschus leucogaster and represent a species complex widespread throughout the central and eastern Himalayan region. The musk deer Mustang lineage was confirmed as Kashmir musk deer Moschus cupreus and has wide distribution in the western Himalayas (from central Nepal to Afghanistan). Our analysis validates that Kashmir musk deer is a genetically distinct species and it clarifies that Himalayan musk deer and Kashmir musk deer are confirmed instead of Alpine musk deer Moschus chrysogaster which has been previously described from the southern parts of Himalayas of Nepal, India and Pakistan.",Structure and Diversity of Soil Bacterial Communities in Offshore Islands.,https://www.ncbi.nlm.nih.gov/pubmed/30894580,Scientific reports,2019 03 29,"The effects of biogeographical separation and parent material differences in soil bacterial structure and diversity in offshore islands remain poorly understood. In the current study, we used next-generation sequencing to characterize the differences in soil bacterial communities in five offshore subtropical granite islands (Matsu Islets, MI) of mainland China and two offshore tropical andesite islands (Orchid [OI] and Green Islands [GI]) of Taiwan. The soils of OI and GI were more acidic and had higher organic carbon and total nitrogen content than MI soils. The bacterial communities were dominated by Acidobacteria and Proteobacteria but had different relative abundance because soils were derived from different parent material and because of geographic distance. Non-metric multi-dimensional scaling revealed that the communities formed different clusters among different parent material and geographically distributed soils. The alpha-diversity in bacterial communities was higher in tropical than subtropical soils. Mantel test and redundancy analysis indicated that bacterial diversity and compositions of OI and GI soils, respectively, were positively correlated with soil pH, organic carbon, total nitrogen, microbial biomass carbon and nitrogen. These results suggest that variations in soil properties of offshore islands could result from differences in soil parent material. Distinct soils derived from different parent material and geographic distance could in turn alter the bacterial communities.",A new approach for analyzing an adhesive bacterial protein in the mouse gastrointestinal tract using optical tissue clearing.,https://www.ncbi.nlm.nih.gov/pubmed/30894579,Scientific reports,2019 03 29,"Several bacterial moonlighting proteins act as adhesion factors, which are important for bacterial colonization of the gastrointestinal (GI) tract. However, little is known about the adherence properties of moonlighting proteins in the GI tract. Here, we describe a new approach for visualizing the localization of moonlighting protein-coated fluorescent microbeads in the whole GI tract by using a tissue optical clearing method, using elongation factor Tu (EF-Tu) as an example. As a bacterial cell surface-localized protein mimic, recombinant EF-Tu from Lactobacillus reuteri was immobilized on microbeads. EF-Tu-coating promoted the interaction of the microbeads with a Caco-2 cell monolayer. Next, the microbeads were orally administered to mice. GI whole tissues were cleared in aqueous fructose solutions of increasing concentrations. At 1 h after administration, the microbeads were diffused from the stomach up to the cecum, and after 3 h, they were diffused throughout the intestinal tract. In the lower digestive tract, EF-Tu-beads were significantly more abundant than non-coated control beads, suggesting that EF-Tu plays an important role in the persistence of the microbeads in the GI tract. The new approach will help in evaluating how moonlighting proteins mediate bacterial colonization.",Inflammatory disease and C-reactive protein in relation to therapeutic ionising radiation exposure in the US Radiologic Technologists.,https://www.ncbi.nlm.nih.gov/pubmed/30894578,Scientific reports,2019 03 29,"Chronic inflammation underlies many autoimmune diseases, including hypothyroidism, hyperthyroidism, and rheumatoid arthritis, also type-2 diabetes and osteoarthritis. Associations have been suggested of high-dose ionising radiation exposure with type-2 diabetes and elevated levels of C-reactive protein, a marker of chronic inflammation. In this analysis we used a proportional hazards model to assess effects of radiotherapy on risks of subsequent inflammatory disease morbidity in 110,368 US radiologic technologists followed from a baseline survey (1983-1989/1994-1998) through 2008. We used a linear model to assess log-transformed C-reactive protein concentration following radiotherapy in 1326 technologists. Relative risk of diabetes increased following radiotherapy (p < 0.001), and there was a borderline significant increasing trend per treatment (p = 0.092). For osteoarthritis there was increased relative risk associated with prior radiotherapy on all questionnaires (p = 0.005), and a significant increasing trend per previous treatment (p = 0.024). No consistent increases were observed for other types of inflammatory disease (hypothyroidism, hyperthyroidism, rheumatoid arthritis) associated with radiotherapy. There was a borderline significant (p = 0.059) increasing trend with dose for C-reactive protein with numbers of prior radiotherapy treatments. Our results suggest that radiotherapy is associated with subsequent increased risk of certain inflammatory conditions, which is reinforced by our finding of elevated levels of C-reactive protein.",Revealing Dissociable Attention Biases in Chronic Smokers Through an Individual-Differences Approach.,https://www.ncbi.nlm.nih.gov/pubmed/30894577,Scientific reports,2019 03 29,"Addiction is accompanied by attentional biases (AB), wherein drug-related cues grab attention independently of their perceptual salience. AB have emerged in different flavours depending on the experimental approach, and their clinical relevance is still debated. In chronic smokers we sought evidence for dissociable attention abnormalities that may play distinct roles in the clinical manifestations of the disorder. Fifty smokers performed a modified visual probe-task measuring two forms of AB and their temporal dynamics, and data on their personality traits and smoking history/status were collected. Two fully dissociable AB effects were found: A Global effect, reflecting the overall impact of smoke cues on attention, and a Location-specific effect, indexing the impact of smoke cues on visuospatial orienting. Importantly, the two effects could be neatly separated from one another as they: (i) unfolded with dissimilar temporal dynamics, (ii) were accounted for by different sets of predictors associated with personality traits and smoking history and (iii) were not correlated with one another. Importantly, the relevance of each of these two components in the single individual depends on a complex blend of personality traits and smoking habits, a result that future efforts addressing the clinical relevance of addiction-related AB should take into careful consideration.",Interlayer exchange coupling in ferromagnetic semiconductor trilayers with out-of-plane magnetic anisotropy.,https://www.ncbi.nlm.nih.gov/pubmed/30894576,Scientific reports,2019 03 29,"We report the observation of ferromagnetic (FM) and antiferromagnetic (AFM) interlayer exchange coupling (IEC) in GaMnAsP-based trilayer structures with out-of-plane magnetic anisotropy. Magnetization and anomalous Hall effect (AHE) measurements show well-resolved magnetization transitions corresponding to the two GaMnAsP layers. Minor loop measurements reveal a characteristic shift caused by IEC in all trilayer samples investigated. Interestingly, the FM IEC changes to AFM IEC for a trilayer with the thinnest (7 nm) top GaMnAsP layer as the temperature increases. The observation of temperature-induced transition of FM and AFM IEC in the same sample suggests the possibility of device applications by controlling the type of IEC in such GaMnAsP-based multilayers.",Perspectives on the clonal persistence of presumed 'ghost' genomes in unisexual or allopolyploid taxa arising via hybridization.,https://www.ncbi.nlm.nih.gov/pubmed/30894575,Scientific reports,2019 03 29,"Although hybridization between non-sibling species rarely results in viable or fertile offspring, it occasionally produces self-perpetuating or sexually-parasitic lineages in which ancestral genomes are inherited clonally and thus may persist as 'ghost species' after ancestor extinction. Ghost species have been detected in animals and plants, for polyploid and diploid organisms, and across clonal, semi-clonal, and even sexual reproductive modes. Here we use a detailed investigation of the evolutionary and taxonomic status of a newly-discovered, putative ghost lineage (HX) in the fish genus Hypseleotris to provide perspectives on several important issues not previously explored by other studies on ghost species, but relevant to ongoing discussions about their detection, conservation, and artificial re-creation. Our comprehensive genetic (allozymes, mtDNA) and genomic (SNPs) datasets successfully identified a threatened sexual population of HX in one tiny portion of the extensive distribution displayed by two hemi-clonal HX-containing lineages. We also discuss what confidence should be placed on any assertion that an ancestral species is actually extinct, and how to assess whether any putative sexual ancestor represents a pure remnant, as shown here, or a naturally-occurring resurrection via the crossing of compatible clones or hemi-clones.",Diminished apoptosis in hypoxic porcine retina explant cultures through hypothermia.,https://www.ncbi.nlm.nih.gov/pubmed/30894574,Scientific reports,2019 03 29,"Simulation of hypoxic processes in vitro can be achieved through cobalt chloride (CoCl2), which induces strong neurodegeneration. Hypoxia plays an important role in the progression of several retinal diseases. Thus, we investigated whether hypoxia can be reduced by hypothermia. Porcine retinal explants were cultivated for four and eight days and hypoxia was mimicked by adding 300 µM CoCl2 from day one to day three. Hypothermia treatment (30 °C) was applied simultaneously. Retinal ganglion, bipolar and amacrine cells, as well as microglia were evaluated via immunohistological and western blot analysis. Furthermore, quantitative real-time PCR was performed to analyze cellular stress and apoptosis. In addition, the expression of specific marker for the previously described cell types were investigated. A reduction of ROS and stress markers HSP70, iNOS, HIF-1α was achieved via hypothermia. In accordance, an inhibition of apoptotic proteins (caspase 3, caspase 8) and the cell cycle arrest gene p21 was found in hypothermia treated retinae. Furthermore, neurons of the inner retina were protected by hypothermia. In this study, we demonstrate that hypothermia lowers hypoxic processes and cellular stress. Additionally, hypothermia inhibits apoptosis and protects neurons. Hence, this seems to be a promising treatment for retinal neurodegeneration."

We analysed the clinical and glycemic profiles of two cohorts of patients treated according to the same guidelines in France and Canada. To investigate incidence differences in phenotypic and glucose abnormalities and to explore the evolution over a 4-year follow-up period, two cohorts of 224 Canadian and 147 French adult CF patients (≥18 years) without treated CF-related diabetes (CFRD) were followed over a 4 year period. In each of these groups, we investigated the longitudinal relationship between glucose tolerance and pulmonary function. An annual 2-hour oral glucose tolerance test was performed: fasting blood glucose (G0) and 2-h blood glucose (G2) were measured. Patients were classified at inclusion according to their glucose tolerance status: Normal glucose tolerant, abnormal glucose tolerant or de novo CFRD. Age, sex ratio and proportion of F508del homozygous patients were not statistically different between both cohorts. Canadian patients had better pulmonary function (median %FEV1 (IQR): 71.0 (55.0-82.0) vs. 64.0 (40.0-78.0), p < 0.001) and greater body mass index (BMI; median BMI in kg/m2) (IQR) 21.1 (19.5-22.8) vs. 19.9 (18.4-21.4), p < 0.001). Glucose values: G0 (5.4 (5.0-5.9) vs. 4.8 (4.5-5.1) mmol/L, p < 0.001) and G2 (7.6 (5.8-9.7) vs. 6.5 (5.2-8.5) mmol/L, p = 0.001) were higher in the Canadian cohort translating into a higher incidence of de novo CFRD diagnosis (19.2 vs. 9.8%, p = 0.003). Decline in FEV1 over time was not different between patients according to glucose tolerance groups. Despite higher glucose levels and incidence of de novo CFRD, Canadian CF patients have a better lung function and a higher BMI than French patients. In spite of these differences between the cohorts, the decline in FEV1 in patients with abnormal glucose tolerance is similar between these groups.",Extensive epigenetic and transcriptomic variability between genetically identical human B-lymphoblastoid cells with implications in pharmacogenomics research.,https://www.ncbi.nlm.nih.gov/pubmed/30894562,Scientific reports,2019 03 29,"Genotyped human B-lymphoblastoid cell lines (LCLs) are widely used models in mapping quantitative trait loci for chromatin features, gene expression, and drug response. The extent of genotype-independent functional genomic variability of the LCL model, although largely overlooked, may inform association study design. In this study, we use flow cytometry, chromatin immunoprecipitation sequencing and mRNA sequencing to study surface marker patterns, quantify genome-wide chromatin changes (H3K27ac) and transcriptome variability, respectively, among five isogenic LCLs derived from the same individual. Most of the studied LCLs were non-monoclonal and had mature B cell phenotypes. Strikingly, nearly one-fourth of active gene regulatory regions showed significantly variable H3K27ac levels, especially enhancers, among which several were classified as clustered enhancers. Large, contiguous genomic regions showed signs of coordinated activity change. Regulatory differences were mirrored by mRNA expression changes, preferentially affecting hundreds of genes involved in specialized cellular processes including immune and drug response pathways. Differential expression of DPYD, an enzyme involved in 5-fluorouracil (5-FU) catabolism, was associated with variable LCL growth inhibition mediated by 5-FU. The extent of genotype-independent functional genomic variability might highlight the need to revisit study design strategies for LCLs in pharmacogenomics.",Crystal structure and epitope analysis of house dust mite allergen Der f 21.,https://www.ncbi.nlm.nih.gov/pubmed/30894561,Scientific reports,2019 04 01,"Group 21 and 5 allergens are homologous house dust mite proteins known as mid-tier allergens. To reveal the biological function of group 21 allergens and to understand better the allergenicity of the rDer f 21 allergen, we determined the 1.5 Å crystal structure of rDer f 21 allergen from Dermatophagoides farinae. The rDer f 21 protein consists of a three helical bundle, similar to available structures of group 21 and homologous group 5 allergens. The rDer f 21 dimer forms a hydrophobic binding pocket similar to the one in the Der p 5 allergen, which indicates that both of the homologous groups could share a similar function. By performing structure-guided mutagenesis, we mutated all 38 surface-exposed polar residues of the rDer f 21 allergen and carried out immuno-dot blot assays using 24 atopic sera. Six residues, K10, K26, K42, E43, K46, and K48, which are located in the region between the N-terminus and the loop 1 of rDer f 21 were identified as the major IgE epitopes of rDer f 21. Epitope mapping of all potential IgE epitopes on the surface of the rDer f 21 crystal structure revealed heterogeneity in the sIgE recognition of the allergen epitopes in atopic individuals. The higher the allergen-sIgE level of an individual, the higher the number of epitope residues that are found in the allergen. The results illustrate the clear correlation between the number of specific major epitope residues in an allergen and the sIgE level of the atopic population.",Metabolic phenotypes and the gut microbiota in response to dietary resistant starch type 2 in normal-weight subjects: a randomized crossover trial.,https://www.ncbi.nlm.nih.gov/pubmed/30894560,Scientific reports,2019 03 29,"Resistant starch (RS) has been reported to reduce body fat in obese mice. However, this effect has not been demonstrated in humans. In this study, we tested the effects of RS in 19 volunteers with normal body weights. A randomized, double-blinded and crossover design clinical trial was conducted. The study subjects were given either 40 g high amylose RS2 or energy-matched control starch with three identical diets per day throughout the study. The effect of RS was evaluated by monitoring body fat, glucose metabolism, gut hormones, gut microbiota, short-chain fatty acids (SCFAs) and metabolites. The visceral and subcutaneous fat areas were significantly reduced following RS intake. Acetate and early-phase insulin, C-peptide and glucagon-like peptide-1 (GLP-1) secretion were increased, and the low-density lipoprotein cholesterol (LDL-C) and blood urea nitrogen (BUN) levels were decreased after the RS intervention. Based on 16S rRNA sequencing, certain gut microbes were significantly decreased after RS supplementation, whereas the genus Ruminococcaceae_UCG-005 showed an increase in abundance. Other potential signatures of the RS intervention included Akkermansia, Ruminococcus_2, Victivallis, and Comamonas. Moreover, the baseline abundance of the genera Streptococcus, Ruminococcus_torques_group, Eubacterium_hallii_group, and Eubacterium_eligens_group was significantly associated with the hormonal and metabolic effects of RS. These observations suggest that a daily intake of 40 g of RS is effective in modulating body fat, SCFAs, early-phase insulin and GLP-1 secretion and the gut microbiota in normal-weight subjects.",Twenty-eight-day mortality in lung cancer patients with metastasis who initiated mechanical ventilation in the emergency department.,https://www.ncbi.nlm.nih.gov/pubmed/30894559,Scientific reports,2019 03 29,"Few data are available regarding treatment outcomes in lung cancer patients with metastasis who initiated mechanical ventilation in the emergency department (ED). We aimed to evaluate 28-day mortality in lung cancer patients with metastasis who initiated mechanical ventilation in the ED. Patients with solid malignancy who initiated mechanical ventilation in the ED of a tertiary hospital were retrospectively identified and stratified into four groups according to the presence of lung cancer and metastasis. Among 212 included patients, the mortality rates by the 28th hospital day were as follows: 44.2% (19/43) in non-lung cancer patients without metastasis, 63.2% (43/68) in non-lung cancer patients with metastasis, 52.4% (11/21) in lung cancer patients without metastasis, and 66.2% (53/80) in lung cancer patients with metastasis. In multivariable analysis, lung cancer patients with metastasis had significantly higher odds ratio for 28-day mortality than non-lung cancer patients without metastasis (adjusted odds ratio [OR] = 7.17, 95% confidence interval [CI] = 2.14-24.01). Sepsis-related respiratory failure (adjusted OR = 2.60, 95% CI = 1.16-5.84) and cardiopulmonary resuscitation (adjusted OR = 13.34, 95% CI = 4.45-39.95) over respiratory failure without sepsis and acute organ dysfunction process measured by sequential organ failure assessment (SOFA) score (adjusted OR = 1.15, 95% CI = 1.05-12.6) were independently associated with an increase in mortality rate. In conclusion, the treatment outcomes in lung cancer patients with metastasis who initiated mechanical ventilation in the ED were poor. Aggressive resuscitation versus end-of-life care in advance of an unexpected medical crisis should be considered in lung cancer patients with metastasis via a multidisciplinary approach with a consideration of underlying comorbid illnesses in the acute organ dysfunction processes.",The EEG signature of sensory evidence accumulation during decision formation closely tracks subjective perceptual experience.,https://www.ncbi.nlm.nih.gov/pubmed/30894558,Scientific reports,2019 04 01,"How neural representations of low-level visual information are accessed by higher-order processes to inform decisions and give rise to conscious experience is a longstanding question. Research on perceptual decision making has revealed a late event-related EEG potential (the Centro-Parietal Positivity, CPP) to be a correlate of the accumulation of sensory evidence. We tested how this evidence accumulation signal relates to externally presented (physical) and internally experienced (subjective) sensory evidence. Our results show that the known relationship between the physical strength of the external evidence and the evidence accumulation signal (reflected in the CPP amplitude) is mediated by the level of subjective experience of stimulus strength. This shows that the CPP closely tracks the subjective perceptual evidence, over and above the physically presented evidence. We conclude that a remarkably close relationship exists between the evidence accumulation process (i.e. CPP) and subjective perceptual experience, suggesting that neural decision processes and components of conscious experience are tightly linked.",Estimating Natural Mortality of Atlantic Bluefin Tuna Using Acoustic Telemetry.,https://www.ncbi.nlm.nih.gov/pubmed/30894557,Scientific reports,2019 03 29,"Atlantic bluefin tuna (Thunnus thynnus) are highly migratory fish with a contemporary range spanning the North Atlantic Ocean. Bluefin tuna populations have undergone severe decline and the status of the fish within each population remains uncertain. Improved biological knowledge, particularly of natural mortality and rates of mixing of the western (GOM) and eastern (Mediterranean) populations, is key to resolving the current status of the Atlantic bluefin tuna. We evaluated the potential for acoustic tags to yield empirical estimates of mortality and migration rates for long-lived, highly migratory species such as Atlantic bluefin tuna. Bluefin tuna tagged in the Gulf of St. Lawrence (GSL) foraging ground (2009-2016) exhibited high detection rates post release, with 91% crossing receiver lines one year post tagging, 61% detected after year two at large, with detections up to ~1700 days post deployment. Acoustic detections per individual fish ranged from 3 to 4759 receptions. A spatially-structured Bayesian mark recapture model was applied to the acoustic detection data for Atlantic bluefin tuna electronically tagged in the GSL to estimate the rate of instantaneous annual natural mortality. We report a median estimate of 0.10 yr-1 for this experiment. Our results demonstrate that acoustic tags can provide vital fisheries independent estimates for life history parameters critical for improving stock assessment models.",Pitx2 cholinergic interneurons are the source of C bouton synapses on brainstem motor neurons.,https://www.ncbi.nlm.nih.gov/pubmed/30894556,Scientific reports,2019 03 29,"Cholinergic neuromodulation has been described throughout the brain and has been implicated in various functions including attention, food intake and response to stress. Cholinergic modulation is also thought to be important for regulating motor systems, as revealed by studies of large cholinergic synapses on spinal motor neurons, called C boutons, which seem to control motor neuron excitability in a task-dependent manner. C boutons on spinal motor neurons stem from spinal interneurons that express the transcription factor Pitx2. C boutons have also been identified on the motor neurons of specific cranial nuclei. However, the source and roles of cranial C boutons are less clear. Previous studies suggest that they originate from Pitx2+ and Pitx2- neurons, in contrast to spinal cord C boutons that originate solely from Pitx2 neurons. Here, we address this controversy using mouse genetics, and demonstrate that brainstem C boutons are Pitx2+ derived. We also identify new Pitx2 populations and map the cholinergic Pitx2 neurons of the mouse brain. Taken together, our data present important new information about the anatomical organization of cholinergic systems which impact motor systems of the brainstem. These findings will enable further analyses of the specific roles of cholinergic modulation in motor control.",micro-RNAs dependent regulation of DNMT and HIF1α gene expression in thrombotic disorders.,https://www.ncbi.nlm.nih.gov/pubmed/30894555,Scientific reports,2019 03 29,"MicroRNAs (miRNAs) are involved in a wide variety of cellular processes and post-transcriptionally regulate several mechanism and diseases. However, contribution of miRNAs functioning during hypoxia and DNA methylation together is less understood. The current study was aimed to find a shared miRNAs signature upstream to hypoxia (via HIF gene family members) and methylation (via DNMT gene family members). This was followed by the global validation of the hypoxia related miRNA signature using miRNA microarray meta-analysis of the hypoxia induced human samples. We further concluded the study by looking into thrombosis related terms and pathways enriched during protein-protein interaction (PPI) network analysis of these two sets of gene family. Network prioritization of these shared miRNAs reveals miR-129, miR-19band miR-23b as top regulatory miRNAs. A comprehensive meta-analysis of microarray datasets of hypoxia samples revealed 29 differentially expressed miRNAs. GSEA of the interacting genes in the DNMT-HIF PPI network indicated thrombosis associated pathways including ""Hemostasis"", ""TPO signaling pathway"" and ""angiogenesis"". Interestingly, the study has generated a novel database of candidate miRNA signatures shared between hypoxia and methylation, and their relation to thrombotic pathways, which might aid in the development of potential therapeutic biomarkers.",Benefits of a Bacillus probiotic to larval fish survival and transport stress resistance.,https://www.ncbi.nlm.nih.gov/pubmed/30894554,Scientific reports,2019 03 29,"The need for sustainable bacterial management approaches in aquaculture is crucial for advancement of the industry. Probiotics are a promising strategy as evidenced by benefits demonstrated in intensive larviculture of various marine fish species. In this study we investigate the effects of a mixed Bacillus species (B. licheniformis and B. amyloliquefaciens) probiotic on rearing of larval common snook (Centropomus undecimalis). Experimental treatments included (1) probiotics supplemented to the water and live feed, (2) probiotics supplemented to the water only, and (3) no probiotic controls. Data from two separate trials indicated up to 2.5 times higher survival with probiotic addition, as well as 20% higher survival 7 days following a transport event. These benefits were not explained by faster growth, measured water quality parameters, or innate immune enzyme activities. Microbiota analysis indicated the importance of system stabilization prior to larval stocking to improve rearing success and probiotic performance. ied Potential probiotic benefits include accelerated gastrointestinal tract development, enhanced immunity, inhibition of opportunistic bacteria, and improvements to water quality parameters. Results suggest this probiotic should be tested in other marine fish species in order to reduce larval rearing bottlenecks."

Here we assembled a dataset of >100,000 tree species lists from the 19th century across a broad region (>130,000km2) in temperate eastern Canada, as well as recent forest inventories, to test the effects of changes in anthropogenic disturbance, temperature and moisture on forest dynamics. We evaluate changes in forest composition using four indices quantifying the affinities of co-occurring tree species with temperature, drought, light and disturbance. Land-use driven shifts favouring more disturbance-adapted tree species are far stronger than any effects ascribable to climate change, although the responses of species to disturbance are correlated with their expected responses to climate change. As such, anthropogenic and natural disturbances are expected to have large direct effects on forests and also indirect effects via altered responses to future climate change.",Optogenetic stimulation of Gs-signaling in the heart with high spatio-temporal precision.,https://www.ncbi.nlm.nih.gov/pubmed/30894542,Nature communications,2019 04 03,"The standard technique for investigating adrenergic effects on heart function is perfusion with pharmaceutical agonists, which does not provide high temporal or spatial precision. Herein we demonstrate that the light sensitive Gs-protein coupled receptor JellyOp enables optogenetic stimulation of Gs-signaling in cardiomyocytes and the whole heart. Illumination of transgenic embryonic stem cell-derived cardiomyocytes or of the right atrium of mice expressing JellyOp elevates cAMP levels and instantaneously accelerates spontaneous beating rates similar to pharmacological β-adrenergic stimulation. Light application to the dorsal left atrium instead leads to supraventricular extrabeats, indicating adverse effects of localized Gs-signaling. In isolated ventricular cardiomyocytes from JellyOp mice, we find increased Ca2+ currents, fractional cell shortening and relaxation rates after illumination enabling the analysis of differential Gs-signaling with high temporal precision. Thus, JellyOp expression allows localized and time-restricted Gs stimulation and will provide mechanistic insights into different effects of site-specific, long-lasting and pulsatile Gs activation.",Multiple ABCB1 transcriptional fusions in drug resistant high-grade serous ovarian and breast cancer.,https://www.ncbi.nlm.nih.gov/pubmed/30894541,Nature communications,2019 04 05,"ABCB1 encodes Multidrug Resistance protein (MDR1), an ATP-binding cassette member involved in the cellular efflux of chemotherapeutic drugs. Here we report that ovarian and breast samples from chemotherapy treated patients are positive for multiple transcriptional fusions involving ABCB1, placing it under the control of a strong promoter while leaving its open reading frame intact. We identified 15 different transcriptional fusion partners involving ABCB1, as well as patients with multiple distinct fusion events. The partner gene selected depended on its structure, promoter strength, and chromosomal proximity to ABCB1. Fusion positivity was strongly associated with the number of lines of MDR1-substrate chemotherapy given. MDR1 inhibition in a fusion positive ovarian cancer cell line increased sensitivity to paclitaxel more than 50-fold. Convergent evolution of ABCB1 fusion is therefore frequent in chemotherapy resistant recurrent ovarian cancer. As most currently approved PARP inhibitors (PARPi) are MDR1 substrates, prior chemotherapy may precondition resistance to PARPi.",Gfi1b regulates the level of Wnt/β-catenin signaling in hematopoietic stem cells and megakaryocytes.,https://www.ncbi.nlm.nih.gov/pubmed/30894540,Nature communications,2019 04 03,"Gfi1b is a transcriptional repressor expressed in hematopoietic stem cells (HSCs) and megakaryocytes (MKs). Gfi1b deficiency leads to expansion of both cell types and abrogates the ability of MKs to respond to integrin. Here we show that Gfi1b forms complexes with β-catenin, its co-factors Pontin52, CHD8, TLE3 and CtBP1 and regulates Wnt/β-catenin-dependent gene expression. In reporter assays, Gfi1b can activate TCF-dependent transcription and Wnt3a treatment enhances this activation. This requires interaction between Gfi1b and LSD1 and suggests that a tripartite β-catenin/Gfi1b/LSD1 complex exists, which regulates Wnt/β-catenin target genes. Consistently, numerous canonical Wnt/β-catenin target genes, co-occupied by Gfi1b, β-catenin and LSD1, have their expression deregulated in Gfi1b-deficient cells. When Gfi1b-deficient cells are treated with Wnt3a, their normal cellularity is restored and Gfi1b-deficient MKs regained their ability to spread on integrin substrates. This indicates that Gfi1b controls both the cellularity and functional integrity of HSCs and MKs by regulating Wnt/β-catenin signaling pathway.",Cascade anchoring strategy for general mass production of high-loading single-atomic metal-nitrogen catalysts.,https://www.ncbi.nlm.nih.gov/pubmed/30894539,Nature communications,2019 03 29,"Although single-atomically dispersed metal-Nx on carbon support (M-NC) has great potential in heterogeneous catalysis, the scalable synthesis of such single-atom catalysts (SACs) with high-loading metal-Nx is greatly challenging since the loading and single-atomic dispersion have to be balanced at high temperature for forming metal-Nx. Herein, we develop a general cascade anchoring strategy for the mass production of a series of M-NC SACs with a metal loading up to 12.1 wt%. Systematic investigation reveals that the chelation of metal ions, physical isolation of chelate complex upon high loading, and the binding with N-species at elevated temperature are essential to achieving high-loading M-NC SACs. As a demonstration, high-loading Fe-NC SAC shows superior electrocatalytic performance for O2 reduction and Ni-NC SAC exhibits high electrocatalytic activity for CO2 reduction. The strategy paves a universal way to produce stable M-NC SAC with high-density metal-Nx sites for diverse high-performance applications.",The conserved NxNNWHW motif in Aha-type co-chaperones modulates the kinetics of Hsp90 ATPase stimulation.,https://www.ncbi.nlm.nih.gov/pubmed/30894538,Nature communications,2019 04 03,"Hsp90 is a dimeric molecular chaperone that is essential for the folding and activation of hundreds of client proteins. Co-chaperone proteins regulate the ATP-driven Hsp90 client activation cycle. Aha-type co-chaperones are the most potent stimulators of the Hsp90 ATPase activity but the relationship between ATPase regulation and in vivo activity is poorly understood. We report here that the most strongly conserved region of Aha-type co-chaperones, the N terminal NxNNWHW motif, modulates the apparent affinity of Hsp90 for nucleotide substrates. The ability of yeast Aha-type co-chaperones to act in vivo is ablated when the N terminal NxNNWHW motif is removed. This work suggests that nucleotide exchange during the Hsp90 functional cycle may be more important than rate of catalysis.",Computational geometry analysis of dendritic spines by structured illumination microscopy.,https://www.ncbi.nlm.nih.gov/pubmed/30894537,Nature communications,2019 04 03,"Dendritic spines are the postsynaptic sites that receive most of the excitatory synaptic inputs, and thus provide the structural basis for synaptic function. Here, we describe an accurate method for measurement and analysis of spine morphology based on structured illumination microscopy (SIM) and computational geometry in cultured neurons. Surface mesh data converted from SIM images were comparable to data reconstructed from electron microscopic images. Dimensional reduction and machine learning applied to large data sets enabled identification of spine phenotypes caused by genetic mutations in key signal transduction molecules. This method, combined with time-lapse live imaging and glutamate uncaging, could detect plasticity-related changes in spine head curvature. The results suggested that the concave surfaces of spines are important for the long-term structural stabilization of spines by synaptic adhesion molecules.",Coming together to define membrane contact sites.,https://www.ncbi.nlm.nih.gov/pubmed/30894536,Nature communications,2019 04 03,"Close proximities between organelles have been described for decades.

The diversity of approaches warrants a unified vocabulary for the field. Such definitions would facilitate laying the foundations of this field, streamlining communication and resolving semantic controversies. This opinion, written by a panel of experts in the field, aims to provide this burgeoning area with guidelines for the experimental definition and analysis of contact sites. It also includes suggestions on how to operationally and tractably measure and analyze them with the hope of ultimately facilitating knowledge production and dissemination within and outside the field of contact-site research.",Axial shielding of Pd(II) complexes enables perfect stereoretention in Suzuki-Miyaura cross-coupling of Csp3 boronic acids.,https://www.ncbi.nlm.nih.gov/pubmed/30894535,Nature communications,2019 04 03,"Stereocontrolled Csp3 cross-coupling can fundamentally change the types of chemical structures that can be mined for molecular functions. Although considerable progress in achieving the targeted chemical reactivity has been made, controlling stereochemistry in Csp3 cross-coupling remains challenging. Here we report that ligand-based axial shielding of Pd(II) complexes enables Suzuki-Miyaura cross-coupling of unactivated Csp3 boronic acids with perfect stereoretention. This approach leverages key differences in spatial orientation between competing pathways for stereoretentive and stereoinvertive transmetalation of Csp3 boronic acids to Pd(II). We show that axial shielding enables perfectly stereoretentive cross-coupling with a range of unactivated secondary Csp3 boronic acids, as well as the stereocontrolled synthesis of xylarinic acid B and all of its Csp3 stereoisomers. We expect these ligand design principles will broadly enable the continued search for practical and effective methods for stereospecific Csp3 cross-coupling.",A global analysis of coral bleaching over the past two decades.,https://www.ncbi.nlm.nih.gov/pubmed/30894534,Nature communications,2019 04 03,"Thermal-stress events associated with climate change cause coral bleaching and mortality that threatens coral reefs globally. Yet coral bleaching patterns vary spatially and temporally. Here we synthesize field observations of coral bleaching at 3351 sites in 81 countries from 1998 to 2017 and use a suite of environmental covariates and temperature metrics to analyze bleaching patterns. Coral bleaching was most common in localities experiencing high intensity and high frequency thermal-stress anomalies. However, coral bleaching was significantly less common in localities with a high variance in sea-surface temperature (SST) anomalies. Geographically, the highest probability of coral bleaching occurred at tropical mid-latitude sites (15-20 degrees north and south of the Equator), despite similar thermal stress levels at equatorial sites. In the last decade, the onset of coral bleaching has occurred at significantly higher SSTs (∼0.5 °C) than in the previous decade, suggesting that thermally susceptible genotypes may have declined and/or adapted such that the remaining coral populations now have a higher thermal threshold for bleaching."

However, quantitative treatment of SR data remains challenging due to its complex dependence on a manifold of experimental parameters. Among the different SR variants, DNA-PAINT is relatively straightforward to implement, since it achieves the necessary 'blinking' without the use of rather complex optical or chemical activation schemes. However, it still suffers from image and quantification artifacts caused by inhomogeneous optical excitation. Here we demonstrate that several experimental challenges can be alleviated by introducing a segment-wise analysis approach and ultimately overcome by implementing a flat-top illumination profile for TIRF microscopy using a commercially-available beam-shaping device. The improvements with regards to homogeneous spatial resolution and precise kinetic information over the whole field-of-view were quantitatively assayed using DNA origami and cell samples.

The helical fibrils are composed of a single protofilament, showing typical 4.9 Å stacking and cross-β architecture. Two distinct polypeptide stretches (total of 77 residues) from the LC variable domain (Vl) fit the fibril density. Despite Vl high sequence variability, residues stabilizing the fibril core are conserved through different cardiotoxic Vl, highlighting structural motifs that may be common to misfolding-prone LCs. Our data shed light on the architecture of LC amyloids, correlate amino acid sequences with fibril assembly, providing the grounds for development of innovative medicines.",Sperm-inherited H3K27me3 impacts offspring transcription and development in C. elegans.,https://www.ncbi.nlm.nih.gov/pubmed/30894520,Nature communications,2019 04 14,"Paternal epigenetic inheritance is gaining attention for its growing medical relevance. However, the form in which paternal epigenetic information is transmitted to offspring and how it influences offspring development remain poorly understood. Here we show that in C. elegans, sperm-inherited chromatin states transmitted to the primordial germ cells in offspring influence germline transcription and development. We show that sperm chromosomes inherited lacking the repressive histone modification H3K27me3 are maintained in that state by H3K36me3 antagonism. Inheritance of H3K27me3-lacking sperm chromosomes results in derepression in the germline of somatic genes, especially neuronal genes, predominantly from sperm-inherited alleles. This results in germ cells primed for losing their germ cell identity and adopting a neuronal fate. These data demonstrate that histone modifications are one mechanism through which epigenetic information from a father can shape offspring gene expression and development.",Synthetic control over orientational degeneracy of spacer cations enhances solar cell efficiency in two-dimensional perovskites.,https://www.ncbi.nlm.nih.gov/pubmed/30894519,Nature communications,2019 03 29,"Two-dimensional perovskites have emerged as more intrinsically stable materials for solar cells. Chemical tuning of spacer organic cations has attracted great interest due to their additional functionalities. However, how the chemical nature of the organic cations affects the properties of two-dimensional perovskites and devices is rarely reported. Here we demonstrate that the selection of spacer cations (i.e., selective fluorination of phenethylammonium) affects the film properties of two-dimensional perovskites, leading to different device performance of two-dimensional perovskite solar cells (average n = 4). Structural analysis reveals that different packing arrangements and orientational disorder of the spacer cations result in orientational degeneracy and different formation energies, largely explaining the difference in film properties. This work provides key missing information on how spacer cations exert influence on desirable electronic properties and device performance of two-dimensional perovskites via the weak and cooperative interactions of these cations in the crystal lattice.",Loss of the androgen receptor suppresses intrarenal calcium oxalate crystals deposition via altering macrophage recruitment/M2 polarization with change of the miR-185-5p/CSF-1 signals.,https://www.ncbi.nlm.nih.gov/pubmed/30894518,Cell death & disease,2019 03 29,"Crystals can trigger a wide range of kidney injuries that may link to the development of kidney stones. Infiltrating macrophages may influence hyperoxaluria-induced intrarenal calcium oxalate (CaOx) crystals deposition, yet their linkage to sex hormones remains unclear. Here we demonstrated that suppressing the androgen receptor (AR) expression in renal tubular epithelial cells increased the macrophage recruitment/M2 polarization that may result in enhancing the phagocytosis of intrarenal CaOx crystals. Mechanism dissection suggested that AR can suppress macrophage colony-stimulating factor 1 (CSF-1) expression via increasing miRNA-185-5p expression to suppress the M2 macrophage polarization-mediated intrarenal CaOx crystals phagocytosis. The preclinical study using glyoxylate-induced intrarenal CaOx crystals deposition mouse model revealed that renal tubule-specific AR knockout mice have less intrarenal CaOx crystals deposition with more recruited M2 macrophages in the kidney compared with the wild-type mice. Results from the in vivo rat model using hydroxy-L-proline-induced CaOx crystals deposition also demonstrated that targeting the AR with ASC-J9® suppressed the intrarenal CaOx crystals deposition via increasing the renal macrophage recruitment/M2 polarization. Together, results from multiple preclinical studies using multiple in vitro cell lines and in vivo mouse/rat models all demonstrated that targeting the AR with a small molecule ASC-J9® may function via altering macrophage recruitment/M2 polarization to decrease the intrarenal CaOx crystals deposition, a key phenotype seen in many kidney stone disease patients with hyperoxaluria.",Direct reprogramming of epidermal cells toward sweat gland-like cells by defined factors.,https://www.ncbi.nlm.nih.gov/pubmed/30894517,Cell death & disease,2019 03 29,"Several studies have reported inducing adult cells into sweat gland-like cells; however, slow transition and low efficiency limit the potential for cell-based treatment.

The iSGCs expressing secreting-related genes, had a global gene expression profile between fetal SGCs (P5) and adult SGCs (P28). Moreover, iSGCs transplanted into the burn mice model facilitated wound repair and sweat gland regeneration. We further demonstrated that the Foxc1 upregulated BMP5 transcription and BMP5 is responsible for the cell-type transition. Collectively, this study shows that lineage reprogramming of epidermal cells into iSGCs provides an excellent cell source and a promising regenerative strategy for anhidrosis and hypohidrosis.",Treatment of patients with multiple myeloma progressing on frontline-therapy with lenalidomide.,https://www.ncbi.nlm.nih.gov/pubmed/30894516,Blood cancer journal,2019 03 29,"Over the last years, there has been great progress in the treatment of multiple myeloma with many new agents and combinations having been approved and being now routinely incorporated into treatment strategies. As a result, patients are experiencing benefits in terms of survival and better tolerance. However, the multitude of treatment options also presents a challenge to select the best options tailored to the specific patient situation. Lenalidomide is increasingly being used as part of frontline therapy in newly diagnosed multiple myeloma. This agent is typically administered until disease progression. It is currently unclear, how to best manage patients, who relapse while receiving lenalidomide as part of their frontline treatment. We conducted a review to summarize the available evidence in this setting. Our summary shows that there are very few data from current trials testing new combinations based on carfilzomib, pomalidomide, or daratumumab that address this specific patient population. Our review is aimed to summarize the available evidence to assist treatment decision making and to raise awareness of this lack of data to encourage further analyses and the incorporation of sequencing questions in future trial designs.","Antibody-drug conjugate, GSK2857916, in relapsed/refractory multiple myeloma: an update on safety and efficacy from dose expansion phase I study.",https://www.ncbi.nlm.nih.gov/pubmed/30894515,Blood cancer journal,2019 05 04,"Interim analyses of a phase I study with GSK2857916, an antibody-drug conjugate against B cell maturation antigen, have previously reported a 60% overall response and 7.9 months progression-free survival in relapsed/refractory multiple myeloma (MM). We provide updated safety and efficacy results of the BMA117159 trial following an additional 14 months' follow-up. This open-label, first-in-human, phase I study was conducted at nine centres in the USA, Canada and the UK, and included adults with MM and progressive disease after stem cell transplantation, alkylators, proteasome inhibitors, and immunomodulators. In part 1, the recommended dose of 3.4 mg/kg was identified; in part 2, patients received GSK2857916 3.4 mg/kg once every 3 weeks. Selected part 2 safety/tolerability and efficacy endpoints are reported. Twenty-one (60.0%; 95% confidence interval (CI) 42.1-76.1) of 35 patients achieved partial response or better, including two stringent complete responses and three complete responses. The median progression-free survival was 12 months and median duration of response was 14.3 months. Thrombocytopenia and corneal events were commonly reported; no new safety signals were identified. GSK2857916 was well tolerated and demonstrated a rapid, deep and durable response in heavily pre-treated patients with relapsed/refractory MM, consolidating the interim analyses conclusions that GSK2857916 is a promising treatment for these patients.",Resveratrol inhibits decidualization by accelerating downregulation of the CRABP2-RAR pathway in differentiating human endometrial stromal cells.,https://www.ncbi.nlm.nih.gov/pubmed/30894514,Cell death & disease,2019 03 29,"Pregnancy critically depends on the transformation of the human endometrium into a decidual matrix that controls embryo implantation and placenta formation, a process driven foremost by differentiation and polarization of endometrial stromal cells into mature and senescent decidual cells. Perturbations in the decidual process underpin a spectrum of prevalent reproductive disorders, including implantation failure and early pregnancy loss, emphasizing the need for new therapeutic interventions. Resveratrol is a naturally occurring polyphenol, widely used for its antioxidant and anti-inflammatory properties. Using primary human endometrial stromal cell (HESC) cultures, we demonstrate that resveratrol has anti-deciduogenic properties, repressing not only the induction of the decidual marker genes PRL and IGFBP1 but also abrogating decidual senescence. Knockdown of Sirtuin 1, a histone deacetylase activated by resveratrol, restored the expression of IGFBP1 but not the induction of PRL or senescence markers in decidualizing HESCs, suggesting involvement of other pathways. We demonstrate that resveratrol interferes with the reprogramming of the retinoic acid signaling pathway in decidualizing HESCs by accelerating down-regulation of cellular retinoic acid-binding protein 2 (CRABP2) and retinoic acid receptor (RAR). Notably, knockdown of CRABP2 or RAR in HESCs was sufficient to recapitulate the anti-deciduogenic effects of resveratrol. Thus, while resveratrol has been advanced as a potential fertility drug, our results indicate it may have detrimental effects on embryo implantation by interfering with decidual remodeling of the endometrium.",Berberine downregulates CDC6 and inhibits proliferation via targeting JAK-STAT3 signaling in keratinocytes.,https://www.ncbi.nlm.nih.gov/pubmed/30894513,Cell death & disease,2019 03 29,"Psoriasis is a chronic skin disease characterized by hyperproliferation and impaired differentiation of epidermal keratinocytes accompanied by increased inflammation, suggesting that molecules with antiproliferation and anti-inflammatory abilities may be effective for its treatment. One of the key steps in regulating cell proliferation is DNA replication initiation, which relies on prereplication complex (pre-RC) assembly on chromatin. CDC6 is an essential regulator of pre-RC assembly and DNA replication in eukaryotic cells, but its role in proliferation of keratinocytes and psoriasis is unknown. Here we examined CDC6 expression in psoriatic skin and evaluated its function in the proliferation of human keratinocytes. CDC6 expression is upregulated in epidermal cells in psoriatic lesions and it could be induced by IL-22/STAT3 signaling, a key signaling pathway involved in the pathogenesis of psoriasis, in keratinocytes. Depletion of CDC6 leads to decreased proliferation of keratinocytes. We also revealed that berberine (BBR) could inhibit CDK4/6-RB-CDC6 signaling in keratinocytes, leading to reduced proliferation of keratinocytes. The mechanism of antiproliferation effects of BBR is through the repression of JAK1, JAK2, and TYK2, which in turn inhibits activation of STAT3. Finally, we demonstrated that BBR could inhibit imiquimod-induced psoriasis-like skin lesions and upregulation of CDC6 and p-STAT3 in mice.

Thus, BBR may serve as a potential therapeutic option for patients with psoriasis."

Currently, there are no approved treatments for these disorders. Mutations in the phosphoinositide 3-phosphatase myotubularin (MTM1) are responsible for X-linked CNM (XLCNM), also called myotubular myopathy, whereas mutations in the membrane remodeling Bin/amphiphysin/Rvs protein amphiphysin 2 [bridging integrator 1 (BIN1)] are responsible for an autosomal form of the disease. Here, we investigated the functional relationship between MTM1 and BIN1 in healthy skeletal muscle and in the physiopathology of CNM. Genetic overexpression of human BIN1 efficiently rescued the muscle weakness and life span in a mouse model of XLCNM. Exogenous human BIN1 expression with adeno-associated virus after birth also prevented the progression of the disease, suggesting that human BIN1 overexpression can compensate for the lack of MTM1 expression in this mouse model. Our results showed that MTM1 controls cell adhesion and integrin localization in mammalian muscle. Alterations in this pathway in Mtm1-/y mice were associated with defects in myofiber shape and size. BIN1 expression rescued integrin and laminin alterations and restored myofiber integrity, supporting the idea that MTM1 and BIN1 are functionally linked and necessary for focal adhesions in skeletal muscle. The results suggest that BIN1 modulation might be an effective strategy for treating XLCNM.",Delta-like protein 3 expression and therapeutic targeting in neuroendocrine prostate cancer.,https://www.ncbi.nlm.nih.gov/pubmed/30894499,Science translational medicine,2019 05 21,"Histologic transformation to small cell neuroendocrine prostate cancer occurs in a subset of patients with advanced prostate cancer as a mechanism of treatment resistance. Rovalpituzumab tesirine (SC16LD6.5) is an antibody-drug conjugate that targets delta-like protein 3 (DLL3) and was initially developed for small cell lung cancer. We found that DLL3 is expressed in most of the castration-resistant neuroendocrine prostate cancer (CRPC-NE) (36 of 47, 76.6%) and in a subset of castration-resistant prostate adenocarcinomas (7 of 56, 12.5%). It shows minimal to no expression in localized prostate cancer (1 of 194) and benign prostate (0 of 103). DLL3 expression correlates with neuroendocrine marker expression, RB1 loss, and aggressive clinical features. DLL3 in circulating tumor cells was concordant with matched metastatic biopsy (87%). Treatment of DLL3-expressing prostate cancer xenografts with a single dose of SC16LD6.5 resulted in complete and durable responses, whereas DLL3-negative models were insensitive. We highlight a patient with neuroendocrine prostate cancer with a meaningful clinical and radiologic response to SC16LD6.5 when treated on a phase 1 trial. Overall, our findings indicate that DLL3 is preferentially expressed in CRPC-NE and provide rationale for targeting DLL3 in patients with DLL3-positive metastatic prostate cancer.",OR14I1 is a receptor for the human cytomegalovirus pentameric complex and defines viral epithelial cell tropism.,https://www.ncbi.nlm.nih.gov/pubmed/30894498,Proceedings of the National Academy of Sciences of the United States of America,2019 05 21,"A human cytomegalovirus (HCMV) pentameric glycoprotein complex (PC), gH-gL-UL128-UL130-UL131A, is necessary for viral infection of clinically relevant cell types, including epithelial cells, which are important for interhost transmission and disease. We performed genome-wide CRISPR/Cas9 screens of different cell types in parallel to identify host genes specifically required for HCMV infection of epithelial cells. This effort identified a multipass membrane protein, OR14I1, as a receptor for HCMV infection. This olfactory receptor family member is required for HCMV attachment, entry, and infection of epithelial cells and is dependent on the presence of viral PC. OR14I1 is required for AKT activation and mediates endocytosis entry of HCMV. We further found that HCMV infection of epithelial cells is blocked by a synthetic OR14I1 peptide and inhibitors of adenylate cyclase and protein kinase A (PKA) signaling. Identification of OR14I1 as a PC-dependent HCMV host receptor associated with epithelial tropism and the role of the adenylate cyclase/PKA/AKT-mediated signaling pathway in HCMV infection reveal previously unappreciated targets for the development of vaccines and antiviral therapies.",Development of highly potent glucocorticoids for steroid-resistant severe asthma.,https://www.ncbi.nlm.nih.gov/pubmed/30894497,Proceedings of the National Academy of Sciences of the United States of America,2019 05 21,"Clinical application of inhaled glucocorticoids (GCs) has been hampered in the case of steroid-resistant severe asthma. To overcome this limitation, we have developed a series of highly potent GCs, including VSGC12, VSG158, and VSG159 based on the structural insight into the glucocorticoid receptor (GR). Particularly, VSG158 exhibits a maximal repression of lung inflammation and is 10 times more potent than the currently most potent clinical GC, Fluticasone Furoate (FF), in a murine model of asthma. More importantly, VSG158 displays a unique property to reduce neutrophilic inflammation in a steroid-resistant airway inflammation model, which is refractory to clinically available GCs, including dexamethasone and FF. VSG158 and VSG159 are able to deliver effective treatments with reduced off-target and side effects. In addition, these GCs also display pharmacokinetic properties that are suitable for the inhalation delivery method for asthma treatment. Taken together, the excellent therapeutic and side-effect profile of these highly potent GCs holds promise for treating steroid-resistant severe asthma.",Cryo-EM structures of Helicobacter pylori vacuolating cytotoxin A oligomeric assemblies at near-atomic resolution.,https://www.ncbi.nlm.nih.gov/pubmed/30894496,Proceedings of the National Academy of Sciences of the United States of America,2019 06 10,"Human gastric pathogen Helicobacter pylori (H. pylori) is the primary risk factor for gastric cancer and is one of the most prevalent carcinogenic infectious agents. Vacuolating cytotoxin A (VacA) is a key virulence factor secreted by H. pylori and induces multiple cellular responses. Although structural and functional studies of VacA have been extensively performed, the high-resolution structure of a full-length VacA protomer and the molecular basis of its oligomerization are still unknown. Here, we use cryoelectron microscopy to resolve 10 structures of VacA assemblies, including monolayer (hexamer and heptamer) and bilayer (dodecamer, tridecamer, and tetradecamer) oligomers. The models of the 88-kDa full-length VacA protomer derived from the near-atomic resolution maps are highly conserved among different oligomers and show a continuous right-handed β-helix made up of two domains with extensive domain-domain interactions. The specific interactions between adjacent protomers in the same layer stabilizing the oligomers are well resolved. For double-layer oligomers, we found short- and/or long-range hydrophobic interactions between protomers across the two layers. Our structures and other previous observations lead to a mechanistic model wherein VacA hexamer would correspond to the prepore-forming state, and the N-terminal region of VacA responsible for the membrane insertion would undergo a large conformational change to bring the hydrophobic transmembrane region to the center of the oligomer for the membrane channel formation.","Genome of Crucihimalaya himalaica, a close relative of Arabidopsis, shows ecological adaptation to high altitude.",https://www.ncbi.nlm.nih.gov/pubmed/30894495,Proceedings of the National Academy of Sciences of the United States of America,2019 05 16,"Crucihimalaya himalaica, a close relative of Arabidopsis and Capsella, grows on the Qinghai-Tibet Plateau (QTP) about 4,000 m above sea level and represents an attractive model system for studying speciation and ecological adaptation in extreme environments. We assembled a draft genome sequence of 234.72 Mb encoding 27,019 genes and investigated its origin and adaptive evolutionary mechanisms. Phylogenomic analyses based on 4,586 single-copy genes revealed that C. himalaica is most closely related to Capsella (estimated divergence 8.8 to 12.2 Mya), whereas both species form a sister clade to Arabidopsis thaliana and Arabidopsis lyrata, from which they diverged between 12.7 and 17.2 Mya. LTR retrotransposons in C. himalaica proliferated shortly after the dramatic uplift and climatic change of the Himalayas from the Late Pliocene to Pleistocene. Compared with closely related species, C. himalaica showed significant contraction and pseudogenization in gene families associated with disease resistance and also significant expansion in gene families associated with ubiquitin-mediated proteolysis and DNA repair. We identified hundreds of genes involved in DNA repair, ubiquitin-mediated proteolysis, and reproductive processes with signs of positive selection. Gene families showing dramatic changes in size and genes showing signs of positive selection are likely candidates for C. himalaica's adaptation to intense radiation, low temperature, and pathogen-depauperate environments in the QTP. Loss of function at the S-locus, the reason for the transition to self-fertilization of C. himalaica, might have enabled its QTP occupation. Overall, the genome sequence of C. himalaica provides insights into the mechanisms of plant adaptation to extreme environments.",Communities and regularities in the behavior of investment fund managers.,https://www.ncbi.nlm.nih.gov/pubmed/30894494,Proceedings of the National Academy of Sciences of the United States of America,2019 05 16,"We analyze a large microlevel dataset on the full daily portfolio holdings and exposures of 22 complex investment funds to shed light on the behavior of professional investment fund managers. We introduce a set of quantitative attributes that capture essential distinctive features of manager allocation strategies and behaviors. These characteristics include turnover, attitude toward hedging, portfolio concentration, and reaction to external events, such as changes in market conditions and flows of funds. We find the existence and stability of three main investment attitude profiles: conservative, reactive, and proactive. The conservative profile shows low turnover and resilience against external shocks; the reactive one is more prone to respond to market condition changes; and members of the proactive profile frequently adjust their portfolio allocations, but their behavior is less affected by market conditions. We find that exogenous shocks temporarily alter this configuration, but communities return to their original state once these external shocks have been absorbed and their effects vanish.","Structure-guided design fine-tunes pharmacokinetics, tolerability, and antitumor profile of multispecific frizzled antibodies.",https://www.ncbi.nlm.nih.gov/pubmed/30894493,Proceedings of the National Academy of Sciences of the United States of America,2019 05 21,"Aberrant activation of Wnt/β-catenin signaling occurs frequently in cancer. However, therapeutic targeting of this pathway is complicated by the role of Wnt in stem cell maintenance and tissue homeostasis. Here, we evaluated antibodies blocking 6 of the 10 human Wnt/Frizzled (FZD) receptors as potential therapeutics. Crystal structures revealed a common binding site for these monoclonal antibodies (mAbs) on FZD, blocking the interaction with the Wnt palmitoleic acid moiety. However, these mAbs displayed gastrointestinal toxicity or poor plasma exposure in vivo. Structure-guided engineering was used to refine the binding of each mAb for FZD receptors, resulting in antibody variants with improved in vivo tolerability and developability. Importantly, the lead variant mAb significantly inhibited tumor growth in the HPAF-II pancreatic tumor xenograft model. Taken together, our data demonstrate that anti-FZD cancer therapeutic antibodies with broad specificity can be fine-tuned to navigate in vivo exposure and tolerability while driving therapeutic efficacy.",Limited oxygen production in the Mesoarchean ocean.,https://www.ncbi.nlm.nih.gov/pubmed/30894492,Proceedings of the National Academy of Sciences of the United States of America,2019 05 16,"The Archean Eon was a time of predominantly anoxic Earth surface conditions, where anaerobic processes controlled bioessential element cycles. In contrast to ""oxygen oases"" well documented for the Neoarchean [2.8 to 2.5 billion years ago (Ga)], the magnitude, spatial extent, and underlying causes of possible Mesoarchean (3.2 to 2.8 Ga) surface-ocean oxygenation remain controversial. Here, we report δ15N and δ13C values coupled with local seawater redox data for Mesoarchean shales of the Mozaan Group (Pongola Supergroup, South Africa) that were deposited during an episode of enhanced Mn (oxyhydr)oxide precipitation between ∼2.95 and 2.85 Ga. Iron and Mn redox systematics are consistent with an oxygen oasis in the Mesoarchean anoxic ocean, but δ15N data indicate a Mo-based diazotrophic biosphere with no compelling evidence for a significant aerobic nitrogen cycle. We propose that in contrast to the Neoarchean, dissolved O2 levels were either too low or too limited in extent to develop a large and stable nitrate reservoir in the Mesoarchean ocean. Since biological N2 fixation was evidently active in this environment, the growth and proliferation of O2-producing organisms were likely suppressed by nutrients other than nitrogen (e.g., phosphorus), which would have limited the expansion of oxygenated conditions during the Mesoarchean.",Gliogenesis in the outer subventricular zone promotes enlargement and gyrification of the primate cerebrum.,https://www.ncbi.nlm.nih.gov/pubmed/30894491,Proceedings of the National Academy of Sciences of the United States of America,2019 05 16,"The primate cerebrum is characterized by a large expansion of cortical surface area, the formation of convolutions, and extraordinarily voluminous subcortical white matter. It was recently proposed that this expansion is primarily driven by increased production of superficial neurons in the dramatically enlarged outer subventricular zone (oSVZ). Here, we examined the development of the parietal cerebrum in macaque monkey and found that, indeed, the oSVZ initially adds neurons to the superficial layers II and III, increasing their thickness. However, as the oSVZ grows in size, its output changes to production of astrocytes and oligodendrocytes, which in primates outnumber cerebral neurons by a factor of three. After the completion of neurogenesis around embryonic day (E) 90, when the cerebrum is still lissencephalic, the oSVZ enlarges and contains Pax6+/Hopx+ outer (basal) radial glial cells producing astrocytes and oligodendrocytes until after E125. Our data indicate that oSVZ gliogenesis, rather than neurogenesis, correlates with rapid enlargement of the cerebrum and development of convolutions, which occur concomitantly with the formation of cortical connections via the underlying white matter, in addition to neuronal growth, elaboration of dendrites, and amplification of neuropil in the cortex, which are primary factors in the formation of cerebral convolutions in primates."

Due to the absence of a highly effective cell culture system, there are few reports about the interaction between avian HEV and host cells. In this study, organic anion-transporting polypeptide 1A2 (OATP1A2) from chicken liver cells was identified to interact with ap237, a truncated avian HEV capsid protein spanning amino acids 313 to 549, by a glutathione S-transferase (GST) pulldown assay. GST pulldown and indirect enzyme-linked immunosorbent assays (ELISAs) further confirmed that the extracellular domain of OATP1A2 directly binds with ap237. The expression levels of OATP1A2 in host cells are positively correlated with the amounts of ap237 attachment and virus infection. The distribution of OATP1A2 in different tissues is consistent with avian HEV infection in vivo Finally, when the functions of OATP1A2 in cells are inhibited by its substrates or an inhibitor or blocked by ap237 or anti-OATP1A2 sera, attachment to and infection of host cells by avian HEV are significantly reduced. Collectively, these results displayed for the first time that OATP1A2 interacts with the avian HEV capsid protein and can influence viral infection in host cells. The present study provides new insight to understand the process of avian HEV infection of host cells.IMPORTANCE The process of viral infection is centered around the interaction between the virus and host cells. Due to the lack of a highly effective cell culture system in vitro, there is little understanding about the interaction between avian HEV and its host cells. In this study, a total of seven host proteins were screened in chicken liver cells by a truncated avian HEV capsid protein (ap237) in which the host protein OATP1A2 interacted with ap237. Overexpression of OATP1A2 in the cells can promote ap237 adsorption as well as avian HEV adsorption and infection of the cells. When the function of OATP1A2 in cells was inhibited by substrates or inhibitors, attachment and infection by avian HEV significantly decreased. The distribution of OATP1A2 in different chicken tissues corresponded with that in tissues during avian HEV infection. This is the first finding that OATP1A2 is involved in viral infection of host cells.",An Immunodominant and Conserved B-Cell Epitope in the Envelope of Simian Foamy Virus Recognized by Humans Infected with Zoonotic Strains from Apes.,https://www.ncbi.nlm.nih.gov/pubmed/30894477,Journal of virology,2019 06 10,"Cross-species transmission of simian foamy viruses (SFVs) from nonhuman primates (NHPs) to humans is currently ongoing. These zoonotic retroviruses establish lifelong persistent infection in their human hosts. SFV are apparently nonpathogenic in vivo, with ubiquitous in vitro tropism. Here, we aimed to identify envelope B-cell epitopes that are recognized following a zoonotic SFV infection. We screened a library of 169 peptides covering the external portion of the envelope from the prototype foamy virus (SFVpsc_huHSRV.13) for recognition by samples from 52 Central African hunters (16 uninfected and 36 infected with chimpanzee, gorilla, or Cercopithecus SFV). We demonstrate the specific recognition of peptide N96-V110 located in the leader peptide, gp18LP Forty-three variant peptides with truncations, alanine substitutions, or amino acid changes found in other SFV species were tested. We mapped the epitope between positions 98 and 108 and defined six amino acids essential for recognition. Most plasma samples from SFV-infected humans cross-reacted with sequences from apes and Old World monkey SFV species. The magnitude of binding to peptide N96-V110 was significantly higher for samples of individuals infected with a chimpanzee or gorilla SFV than those infected with a Cercopithecus SFV. In conclusion, we have been the first to define an immunodominant B-cell epitope recognized by humans following zoonotic SFV infection.IMPORTANCE Foamy viruses are the oldest known retroviruses and have been mostly described to be nonpathogenic in their natural animal hosts. SFVs can be transmitted to humans, in whom they establish persistent infection, like the simian lenti- and deltaviruses that led to the emergence of two major human pathogens, human immunodeficiency virus type 1 and human T-lymphotropic virus type 1. This is the first identification of an SFV-specific B-cell epitope recognized by human plasma samples. The immunodominant epitope lies in gp18LP, probably at the base of the envelope trimers. The NHP species the most genetically related to humans transmitted SFV strains that induced the strongest antibody responses. Importantly, this epitope is well conserved across SFV species that infect African and Asian NHPs.",A Novel Murine Model Expressing a Chimeric mSCARB2/hSCARB2 Receptor Is Highly Susceptible to Oral Infection with Clinical Isolates of Enterovirus 71.,https://www.ncbi.nlm.nih.gov/pubmed/30894476,Journal of virology,2019 06 10,"Enterovirus 71 (EV71) infection is generally associated with hand-foot-and-mouth disease (HFMD) and may cause severe neurological disorders and even death. An effective murine oral infection model for studying the pathogenesis of various clinical EV71 isolates is lacking. We developed a transgenic (Tg) mouse that expresses an EV71 receptor, that is, human scavenger receptor class B member 2 (hSCARB2), in a pattern highly similar to that of endogenous murine SCARB2 (mSCARB2) protein. A FLAG-tagged SCARB2 cDNA fragment composed of exons 3 to 12 was inserted into a murine Scarb2 gene-containing bacterial artificial chromosome (BAC) clone, and the resulting transgene was used for establishment of chimeric receptor-expressing Tg mice. Tg mice intragastrically (i.g.) infected with clinical isolates of EV71 showed neurological symptoms, such as ataxia and paralysis, and fatality. There was an age-dependent decrease in susceptibility to viral infection. Pathological characteristics of the infected Tg mice resembled those of encephalomyelitis in human patients. Viral infection was accompanied by microglial activation. Clodronate treatment of the brain slices from Tg mice enhanced viral replication, while lipopolysaccharide treatment significantly inhibited it, suggesting an antiviral role for microglia during EV71 infection. Taken together, this Tg mouse provides a model that closely mimics natural infection for studying EV71 pathogenesis and for evaluating the efficacy of vaccines or other antiviral drugs.IMPORTANCE The availability of a murine model of EV71 infection is beneficial for the understanding of pathogenic mechanisms and the development and assessment of vaccines and antiviral drugs. However, the lack of a murine oral infection model thwarted the study of pathogenesis induced by clinically relevant EV71 strains that are transmitted via the oral-oral or oral-fecal route. Our Tg mice could be intragastrically infected with clinically relevant EV71 strains in an efficient way and developed neurological symptoms and pathological changes strikingly resembling those of human infection. Moreover, these mice showed an age-dependent change in susceptibility that is similar to the human case. This Tg mouse, when combined with the use of other genetically modified mice, potentially contributes to studying the relationship between developmental changes in immunity and susceptibility to virus.",Conformational Engineering of HIV-1 Env Based on Mutational Tolerance in the CD4 and PG16 Bound States.,https://www.ncbi.nlm.nih.gov/pubmed/30894475,Journal of virology,2019 06 10,"HIV-1 infection is initiated by viral Env engaging the host receptor CD4, triggering Env to transition from a ""closed"" to ""open"" conformation during the early events of virus-cell membrane fusion. To understand how Env sequence accommodates this conformational change, mutational landscapes decoupled from virus replication were determined for Env from BaL (clade B) and DU422 (clade C) isolates interacting with CD4 or antibody PG16 that preferentially recognizes closed trimers. Sequence features uniquely important to each bound state were identified, including glycosylation and binding sites. Notably, the Env apical domain and trimerization interface are under selective pressure for PG16 binding. Based on this key observation, mutations were found that increase presentation of quaternary epitopes associated with properly conformed trimers when Env is expressed at the plasma membrane. Many mutations reduce electrostatic repulsion at the Env apex and increase PG16 recognition of Env sequences from clades A and B. Other mutations increase hydrophobic packing at the gp120 inner-outer domain interface and were broadly applicable for engineering Env from diverse strains spanning tiers 1, 2, and 3 across clades A, B, C, and BC recombinants. Core mutations predicted to introduce steric strain in the open state show markedly reduced CD4 interactions. Finally, we demonstrate how our methodology can be adapted to interrogate interactions between membrane-associated Env and the matrix domain of Gag. These findings and methods may assist vaccine design.IMPORTANCE HIV-1 Env is dynamic and undergoes large conformational changes that drive fusion of virus and host cell membranes. Three Env proteins in a trimer contact each other at their apical tips to form a closed conformation that presents epitopes recognized by broadly neutralizing antibodies. The apical tips separate, among other changes, to form an open conformation that binds tightly to host receptors. Understanding how Env sequence facilitates these structural changes can inform the biophysical mechanism and aid immunogen design. Using deep mutational scans decoupled from virus replication, we report mutational landscapes for Env from two strains interacting with conformation-dependent binding proteins. Residues in the Env trimer interface and apical domains are preferentially conserved in the closed conformation, and conformational diversity is facilitated by electrostatic repulsion and an underpacked core between domains. Specific mutations are described that enhance presentation of the trimeric closed conformation across diverse HIV-1 strains.",Antibody-Induced Internalization of HIV-1 Env Proteins Limits Surface Expression of the Closed Conformation of Env.,https://www.ncbi.nlm.nih.gov/pubmed/30894474,Journal of virology,2019 06 10,"To minimize immune responses against infected cells, HIV-1 limits the surface expression of its envelope glycoprotein (Env). Here, we demonstrate that this mechanism is specific for the Env conformation and affects the efficiency of antibody-dependent cellular cytotoxicity (ADCC). Using flow cytometry and confocal microscopy, we show that broadly neutralizing antibodies (bNAbs) targeting the ""closed"" conformation of Env induce its internalization from the surface. In contrast, non-neutralizing antibodies (nNAbs) are displayed on the cell surface for prolonged period of times. The bNAb-induced Env internalization can be decreased by blocking dynamin function, which translates into higher susceptibilities of infected cells to ADCC. Our results suggest that antibody-mediated Env internalization is a mechanism used by HIV-1 to evade immune responses against the ""closed"" conformation of Env expressed on HIV-1-infected cells.IMPORTANCE HIV-1 has evolved to acquire several strategies to limit the exposure of its envelope glycoproteins (Env) on the surface of infected cells. In this study, we show that antibody-induced Env internalization is conformation specific and reduces the susceptibility of infected cells to antibody-dependent cellular cytotoxicity (ADCC). Thus, a better understanding of this mechanism might help develop antibodies with improved capacities to mediate ADCC.",Foot-and-Mouth Disease Virus Antagonizes NOD2-Mediated Antiviral Effects by Inhibiting NOD2 Protein Expression.,https://www.ncbi.nlm.nih.gov/pubmed/30894473,Journal of virology,2019 06 10,"The role of nucleotide-binding oligomerization domain 2 (NOD2) in foot-and-mouth disease virus (FMDV)-infected cells remains unknown. Here, we showed that FMDV infection activated NOD2-mediated beta interferon (IFN-β) and nuclear factor-κB (NF-ĸB) signaling pathways. NOD2 inhibited FMDV replication in the infected cells. FMDV infection triggered NOD2 transcription, while it reduced the abundance of NOD2 protein. Our results revealed that FMDV 2B, 2C, and 3C proteinase (3Cpro) were responsible for the decrease in NOD2 protein levels. 3Cpro is a viral proteinase that can cleave multiple host proteins and limit protein synthesis. Our previous studies determined that FMDV 2B suppressed protein expression of RIG-I and LGP2. Here, we found that 3Cpro and 2B also decreased NOD2 expression. However, this is the first report that 2C induced the reduction of NOD2 protein levels. We determined that both 2B- and 2C-induced decreases in NOD2 were independent of the cleavage of host eukaryotic translation initiation factor 4 gamma (eIF4G), induction of cellular apoptosis, or proteasome, lysosome, and caspase pathways. The interactions between NOD2 and 2B or 2C were observed in the context of viral infection. The carboxyl-terminal amino acids 105 to 114 and 135 to 144 of 2B were essential for the reduction of NOD2, while the residues 105 to 114 were required for the interaction. Amino acids 116 to 260 of the carboxyl terminus of 2C were essential for the interaction, while truncated 2C mutants did not reduce NOD2. These data suggested novel antagonistic mechanisms of FMDV that were mediated by 2B, 2C, and 3Cpro proteins.IMPORTANCE NOD2 was identified as a cytoplasmic viral pattern recognition receptor in 2009. Subsequently, many viruses were reported to activate NOD2-mediated signaling pathways. This study demonstrated that FMDV infection activated NOD2-mediated IFN-β and NF-ĸB signaling pathways. Host cells have developed multiple strategies against viral infection; however, viruses have evolved many strategies to escape host defenses. FMDV has evolved multiple mechanisms to inhibit host type I IFN production. Here, we showed that NOD2 suppressed FMDV replication during viral infection. FMDV 2B, 2C, and 3Cpro decreased NOD2 protein expression by different mechanisms to promote viral replication. This study provided new insight into the immune evasion mechanisms mediated by FMDV and identified 2B, 2C, and 3Cpro as antagonistic factors for FMDV to evade host antiviral responses.",Antarctic Penguins as Reservoirs of Diversity for Avian Avulaviruses.,https://www.ncbi.nlm.nih.gov/pubmed/30894472,Journal of virology,2019 06 10,"Wild birds harbor a huge diversity of avian avulaviruses (formerly avian paramyxoviruses). Antarctic penguin species have been screened for avian avulaviruses since the 1980s and, as such, are known hosts of these viruses. In this study, we screened three penguin species from the South Shetland Islands and the Antarctic Peninsula for avian avulaviruses. We show that Adelie penguins (Pygoscelis adeliae) are hosts for four different avian avulavirus species, the recently described avian avulaviruses 17 to 19 and avian avulavirus 10-like, never before isolated in Antarctica. A total of 24 viruses were isolated and sequenced; avian avulavirus 17 was the most common, and phylogenetic analysis demonstrated patterns of occurrence, with different genetic clusters corresponding to penguin age and location. Following infection in specific-pathogen-free (SPF) chickens, all four avian avulavirus species were shed from the oral cavity for up to 7 days postinfection. There was limited shedding from the cloaca in a proportion of infected chickens, and all but one bird seroconverted by day 21. No clinical signs were observed. Taken together, we propose that penguin species, including Antarctic penguins, may be the central reservoir for a diversity of avian avulavirus species and that these viruses have the potential to infect other avian hosts.IMPORTANCE Approximately 99% of all viruses are still to be described, and in our changing world, any one of these unknown viruses could potentially expand their host range and cause epidemic disease in wildlife, agricultural animals, or humans. Avian avulavirus 1 causes outbreaks in wild birds and poultry and is thus well described. However, for many avulavirus species, only a single specimen has been described, and their viral ecology and epidemiology are unknown. Through the detection of avian avulaviruses in penguins from Antarctica, we have been able to expand upon our understanding of three avian avulavirus species (avian avulaviruses 17 to 19) and report a potentially novel avulavirus species. Importantly, we show that penguins appear to play a key role in the epidemiology of avian avulaviruses, and we encourage additional sampling of this avian group.","Mutations That Increase the Stability of the Postfusion gp41 Conformation of the HIV-1 Envelope Glycoprotein Are Selected by both an X4 and R5 HIV-1 Virus To Escape Fusion Inhibitors Corresponding to Heptad Repeat 1 of gp41, but the gp120 Adaptive Mutations Differ between the Two Viruses.",https://www.ncbi.nlm.nih.gov/pubmed/30894471,Journal of virology,2019 06 10,"Binding of the gp120 surface subunit of the envelope glycoprotein (Env) of HIV-1 to CD4 and chemokine receptors on target cells triggers refolding of the gp41 transmembrane subunit into a six-helix bundle (6HB) that promotes fusion between virus and host cell membranes. To elucidate details of Env entry and potential differences between viruses that use CXCR4 (X4) or CCR5 (R5) coreceptors, we generated viruses that are resistant to peptide fusion inhibitors corresponding to the first heptad repeat region (HR1) of gp41 that target fusion-intermediate conformations of Env. Previously we reported that an R5 virus selected two resistance pathways, each defined by an early gp41 resistance mutation in either HR1 or the second heptad repeat (HR2), to escape inhibition by an HR1 peptide, but preferentially selected the HR1 pathway to escape inhibition by a trimer-stabilized HR1 peptide. Here, we report that an X4 virus selected the same HR1 and HR2 resistance pathways as the R5 virus to escape inhibition by the HR1 peptide. However, in contrast to the R5 virus, the X4 virus selected a unique mutation in HR2 to escape inhibition by the trimer-stabilized peptide. Significantly, both of these X4 and R5 viruses acquired gp41 resistance mutations that improved the thermostability of the six-helix bundle, but they selected different gp120 adaptive mutations. These findings show that these X4 and R5 viruses use a similar resistance mechanism to escape from HR1 peptide inhibition but different gp120-gp41 interactions to regulate Env conformational changes.IMPORTANCE HIV-1 fuses with cells when the gp41 subunit of Env refolds into a 6HB after binding to cellular receptors. Peptides corresponding to HR1 or HR2 interrupt gp41 refolding and inhibit HIV infection. Previously, we found that a CCR5 coreceptor-tropic HIV-1 acquired a key HR1 or HR2 resistance mutation to escape HR1 peptide inhibitors but only the key HR1 mutation to escape a trimer-stabilized HR1 peptide inhibitor. Here, we report that a CXCR4 coreceptor-tropic HIV-1 selected the same key HR1 or HR2 mutations to escape inhibition by the HR1 peptide but different combinations of HR1 and HR2 mutations to escape the trimer-stabilized HR1 peptide. All gp41 mutations enhance 6HB stability to outcompete inhibitors, but gp120 adaptive mutations differed between these R5 and X4 viruses, providing new insights into gp120-gp41 functional interactions affecting Env refolding during HIV entry.",The Membrane-Spanning Peptide and Acidic Cluster Dileucine Sorting Motif of UL138 Are Required To Downregulate MRP1 Drug Transporter Function in Human Cytomegalovirus-Infected Cells.,https://www.ncbi.nlm.nih.gov/pubmed/30894470,Journal of virology,2019 06 10,"The human cytomegalovirus (HCMV) UL138 protein downregulates the cell surface expression of the multidrug resistance-associated protein 1 (MRP1) transporter. We examined the genetic requirements within UL138 for MRP1 downregulation. We determined that the acidic cluster dileucine motif is essential for UL138-mediated downregulation of MRP1 steady-state levels and inhibition of MRP1 efflux activity. We also discovered that the naturally occurring UL138 protein isoforms, the full-length long isoform of UL138 and a short isoform missing the N-terminal membrane-spanning domain, have different abilities to inhibit MRP1 function. Cells expressing the long isoform of UL138 show decreased MRP1 steady-state levels and fail to efflux an MRP1 substrate. Cells expressing the short isoform of UL138 also show decreased MRP1 levels, but the magnitude of the decrease is not the same, and they continue to efficiently efflux an MRP1 substrate. Thus, the membrane-spanning domain, while dispensable for a UL138-mediated decrease in MRP1 protein levels, is necessary for a functional inhibition of MRP1 activity. Our work defines the genetic requirements for UL138-mediated MRP1 downregulation and anticipates the possible evolution of viral escape mutants during the use of therapies targeting this function of UL138.IMPORTANCE HCMV UL138 curtails the activity of the MRP1 drug transporter by reducing its steady-state levels, leaving cells susceptible to killing by cytotoxic agents normally exported by MRP1. It has been suggested in the literature that capitalizing on this UL138-induced vulnerability could be a potential antiviral strategy against virally infected cells, particularly those harboring a latent infection during which UL138 is one of the few viral proteins expressed. Therefore, identifying the regions of UL138 required for MRP1 downregulation and predicting genetic variants that may be selected upon UL138-targeted chemotherapy are important ventures. Here we present the first structure-function examination of UL138 activity and determine that its transmembrane domain and acidic cluster dileucine Golgi sorting motif are required for functional MRP1 downregulation.",Herpes Simplex Virus 2 in Autonomic Ganglia: Evidence for Spontaneous Reactivation.,https://www.ncbi.nlm.nih.gov/pubmed/30894469,Journal of virology,2019 06 10,"Herpes simplex virus 2 (HSV-2) can be transmitted in the presence or absence of lesions, allowing efficient spread among the general population. Recurrent HSV genital lesions are thought to arise from reactivated latent virus in sensory cell bodies of the dorsal root ganglia (DRG). However, HSV-2 has also been found latent in autonomic ganglia. Spontaneous reactivation or a low level of chronic infection could theoretically also occur in these peripheral nervous tissues, contributing to the presence of infectious virus in the periphery and to viral transmission. Use of a recently described, optimized virus with a monomeric mNeonGreen protein fused to viral capsid protein 26 (VP26) permitted detection of reactivating virus in explanted ganglia and cryosections of DRG and the sacral sympathetic ganglia (SSG) from latently infected guinea pigs. Immediate early, early, and late gene expression were quantified by droplet digital reverse transcription-PCR (ddRT-PCR), providing further evidence of viral reactivation not only in the expected DRG but also in the sympathetic SSG. These findings indicate that viral reactivation from autonomic ganglia is a feature of latent viral infection and that these reactivations likely contribute to viral pathogenesis.IMPORTANCE HSV-2 is a ubiquitous important human pathogen that causes recurrent infections for the life of its host. We hypothesized that the autonomic ganglia have important roles in viral reactivation, and this study sought to determine whether this is correct in the clinically relevant guinea pig vaginal infection model. Our findings indicate that sympathetic ganglia are sources of reactivating virus, helping explain how the virus causes lifelong recurrent disease."

Important cytoprotective mechanisms activated by oxidative inflammatory conditions are mediated by nitrated fatty acids that covalently modify proteins to limit inflammation and oxidant stress. In the present study, we evaluated the effects of chronic treatment with CXA-10 (10-nitro-9(E)-octadec-9-enoic acid) in the uninephrectomized deoxycorticosterone acetate-high-salt mouse model of CKD. After 4 weeks of treatment, CXA-10 [2.5 millligrams per kilogram (mpk), p.o.] significantly attenuated increases in plasma cholesterol, heart weight, and kidney weight observed in the model without impacting systemic arterial blood pressure. CXA-10 also reduced albuminuria, nephrinuria, glomerular hypertrophy, and glomerulosclerosis in the model. Inflammatory MCP-1 and fibrosis (collagen, fibronectin, plasminogen activator inhibitor-1, and osteopontin) renal biomarkers were significantly reduced in the CXA-10 (2.5 mpk) group. The anti-inflammatory and antifibrotic effects, as well as glomerular protection, were not observed in the enalapril-treated group. Also, CXA-10 appears to exhibit hormesis as all protective effects observed in the low-dose group were absent in the high-dose group (12.5 mpk). Taken together, these findings demonstrate that, at the appropriate dose, the nitrated fatty acid CXA-10 exhibits anti-inflammatory and antifibrotic effects in the kidney and limits renal injury in a model of CKD.","Effects of Tegoprazan, a Novel Potassium-Competitive Acid Blocker, on Rat Models of Gastric Acid-Related Disease.",https://www.ncbi.nlm.nih.gov/pubmed/30894456,The Journal of pharmacology and experimental therapeutics,2019 05 09,"Tegoprazan, a novel potassium-competitive acid blocker (P-CAB), is a next-generation therapeutics developed for the treatment of acid-related gastrointestinal diseases such as gastroesophageal reflux disease (GERD) and peptic ulcers. In the present study, the in vitro and in vivo pharmacological properties of tegoprazan were compared with those of esomeprazole, a representative proton pump inhibitor. In vitro enzyme assays were performed using ion-leaky vesicles containing gastric H+/K+-ATPases isolated from pigs. The in vivo efficacies of tegoprazan were evaluated in rat models of GERD and peptic ulcer. Tegoprazan inhibited the activity of porcine H+/K+-ATPase with an IC50 value of 0.53 μM in a reversible manner, whereas esomeprazole showed weak and irreversible inhibition with an IC50 value of 42.52 μM. In a GERD model, tegoprazan showed dose-dependent efficacy in inhibiting esophageal injury and gastric acid secretion with an ED50 of 2.0 mg/kg, which was 15-fold more potent than that of esomeprazole. In peptic ulcer models, tegoprazan exhibited superior antiulcer activity compared with esomeprazole. The ED50 of tegoprazan in the naproxen-, ethanol-, and water-immersion restraint stress-induced peptic ulcer models were 0.1, 1.4, and 0.1 mg/kg, respectively. In the acetic acid-induced peptic ulcer model, the curative ratio of tegoprazan at 10 mg/kg was higher than that of esomeprazole at 30 mg/kg (44.2% vs. 32.7%, respectively), after 5 days of repeated oral administration. Thus, tegoprazan is a novel P-CAB that shows potent and reversible inhibition of gastric H+/K+-ATPase and may provide stronger efficacy compared with previous proton pump inhibitors.",Colony-Stimulating Factor-1 Antibody Lacnotuzumab in a Phase 1 Healthy Volunteer Study and Mechanistic Investigation of Safety Outcomes.,https://www.ncbi.nlm.nih.gov/pubmed/30894455,The Journal of pharmacology and experimental therapeutics,2019 05 09,"The colony-stimulating factor-1 (CSF-1) receptor pathway has been implicated in a variety of diseases, and CSF-1-dependent mechanisms are also involved in bloodborne protein clearance. Lacnotuzumab is a novel, high-affinity, humanized, anti-CSF-1 monoclonal antibody that prevents CSF-1-mediated receptor activation. This phase 1, two-part, double-blind study in healthy volunteers assessed the safety and tolerability of lacnotuzumab and its pharmacokinetics (PK) and pharmacodynamic properties. Part A (n = 36) was a single, ascending-dose assessment of eight lacnotuzumab doses (0.01-20 mg/kg); in part B (n = 16), lacnotuzumab was administered at either 5 or 10 mg/kg. In each study cohort, individuals were randomized 3:1 to lacnotuzumab or placebo. Lacnotuzumab was generally well tolerated. At higher doses (10 and 20 mg/kg), creatine kinase (CK) elevations (>5× the upper limit of normal, but asymptomatic and reversible) and mild transient periorbital swelling were reported. Most adverse events (AEs) were low-grade, no unexpected or novel AEs were observed, and there were no discontinuations for AEs. Free, unbound lacnotuzumab serum concentration-time profiles showed nonlinear PK across doses from 0.01 to 20 mg/kg, with faster apparent elimination at lower doses or concentrations; this finding was consistent with apparent target-mediated drug disposition. Lacnotuzumab also showed dose-dependent, on-target effects on multiple downstream biomarkers. Preclinical investigations of the CK elevation and periorbital swelling observed after lacnotuzumab administration suggest that these are reversible, nonpathological events linked to inhibition of the CSF-1 pathway. These data support further evaluation of lacnotuzumab in clinical studies.",HSB-1 Inhibition and HSF-1 Overexpression Trigger Overlapping Transcriptional Changes To Promote Longevity in Caenorhabditis elegans.,https://www.ncbi.nlm.nih.gov/pubmed/30894454,"G3 (Bethesda, Md.)",2019 06 10,"Heat shock factor 1 (HSF-1) is a component of the heat shock response pathway that is induced by cytoplasmic proteotoxic stress. In addition to its role in stress response, HSF-1 also acts as a key regulator of the rate of organismal aging. Overexpression of HSF-1 promotes longevity in C. elegans via mechanisms that remain less understood. Moreover, genetic ablation of a negative regulator of HSF-1, termed as heat shock factor binding protein 1 (HSB-1), results in hsf-1-dependent life span extension in animals. Here we show that in the absence of HSB-1, HSF-1 acquires increased DNA binding activity to its genomic target sequence. Using RNA-Seq to compare the gene expression profiles of the hsb-1 mutant and hsf-1 overexpression strains, we found that while more than 1,500 transcripts show ≥1.5-fold upregulation due to HSF-1 overexpression, HSB-1 inhibition alters the expression of less than 500 genes in C. elegans Roughly half of the differentially regulated transcripts in the hsb-1 mutant have altered expression also in hsf-1 overexpressing animals, with a strongly correlated fold-expression pattern between the two strains. In addition, genes that are upregulated via both HSB-1 inhibition and HSF-1 overexpression include numerous DAF-16 targets that have known functions in longevity regulation. This study identifies how HSB-1 acts as a specific regulator of the transactivation potential of HSF-1 in non-stressed conditions, thus providing a detailed understanding of the role of HSB-1/HSF-1 signaling pathway in transcriptional regulation and longevity in C. elegans.",BGData - A Suite of R Packages for Genomic Analysis with Big Data.,https://www.ncbi.nlm.nih.gov/pubmed/30894453,"G3 (Bethesda, Md.)",2019 06 10,"We created a suite of packages to enable analysis of extremely large genomic data sets (potentially millions of individuals and millions of molecular markers) within the R environment.

Unlike heterosis, extreme phenotypes caused by transgressive segregation are heritably stable. We examined transgressive phenotypes of flowering time in rice, and revealed transgressive segregation in F2 populations derived from a cross between parents with similar (proximal) days to heading (DTH). The DTH phenotypes of the A58 × Kitaake F2 progenies were frequently more extreme than those of either parent. These transgressive phenotypes were maintained in the F3 and F4 populations. Both A58 and Kitaake are japonica rice cultivars adapted to Hokkaido, Japan, which is a high-latitude region, and have a short DTH. Among the four known loci required for a short DTH, three loci had common alleles in A58 and Kitaake, implying there is a similar genetic basis for DTH between the two varieties. A genome-wide single nucleotide polymorphism (SNP) analysis based on the F4 population identified five new quantitative trait loci (QTL) associated with transgressive DTH phenotypes. Each of these QTL had different degrees of additive effects on DTH, and two QTL had an epistatic effect on each other. Thus, a genome-wide SNP analysis facilitated the detection of genetic loci associated with extreme DTH phenotypes, and revealed that the transgressive phenotypes were produced by exchanging the complementary alleles of a few minor QTL in the similar parental phenotypes.",Immune myopathy with large histiocyte-related myofiber necrosis.,https://www.ncbi.nlm.nih.gov/pubmed/30894448,Neurology,2019 06 10,"To describe the features of a new, pathologically distinctive, acquired myopathy with an unusual pattern of scattered necrotic muscle fibers that are neighbored, surrounded, or invaded, by large, often multinucleated, histiocytic cells.",Visibility and representation of women in multiple sclerosis research.,https://www.ncbi.nlm.nih.gov/pubmed/30894447,Neurology,2019 06 10,"To establish the gender distribution of multiple sclerosis (MS) researchers across high-impact neurologic publications, MS-specific journals, and the European Committee for Treatment and Research in MS (ECTRIMS).",Progressive parkinsonism in older adults is related to the burden of mixed brain pathologies.,https://www.ncbi.nlm.nih.gov/pubmed/30894446,Neurology,2019 04 16,To examine whether indices of Parkinson disease (PD) pathology and other brain pathologies are associated with the progression of parkinsonism in older adults.,New onset refractory status epilepticus research: What is on the horizon?,https://www.ncbi.nlm.nih.gov/pubmed/30894443,Neurology,2019 04 23,"New-onset refractory status epilepticus (NORSE) is a clinical presentation, not a specific diagnosis, in a patient without active epilepsy or other preexisting relevant neurologic disorder, with new onset of refractory status epilepticus (RSE) that does not resolve after 2 or more rescue medications, without a clear acute or active structural, toxic, or metabolic cause.

In an attempt to improve the protocols used for EV isolation, we explored a model of vesicle production after growth of Cryptococcus gattii and Cryptococcus neoformans on solid media. Nanoparticle tracking analysis in combination with transmission electron microscopy revealed that C. gattii and C. neoformans produced EVs in solid media. The properties of cryptococcal vesicles varied according to the culture medium used and the EV-producing species. EV detection was reproduced with an acapsular mutant of C. neoformans, as well as with isolates of Candida albicans, Histoplasma capsulatum, and Saccharomyces cerevisiae Cryptococcal EVs produced in solid media were biologically active and contained regular vesicular components, including the major polysaccharide glucuronoxylomannan (GXM) and RNA. Since the protocol had higher yields and was much faster than the regular methods used for the isolation of fungal EVs, we asked if it would be applicable to address fundamental questions related to cryptococcal secretion. On the basis that polysaccharide export in Cryptococcus requires highly organized membrane traffic culminating with EV release, we analyzed the participation of a putative scramblase (Aim25; CNBG_3981) in EV-mediated GXM export and capsule formation in C. gattii EVs from a C. gattiiaim25Δ strain differed from those obtained from wild-type (WT) cells in physical-chemical properties and cargo. In a model of surface coating of an acapsular cryptococcal strain with vesicular GXM, EVs obtained from the aim25Δ mutant were more efficiently used as a source of capsular polysaccharides. Lack of the Aim25 scramblase resulted in disorganized membranes and increased capsular dimensions. These results associate the description of a novel protocol for the isolation of fungal EVs with the identification of a previously unknown regulator of polysaccharide release.IMPORTANCE Extracellular vesicles (EVs) are fundamental components of the physiology of cells from all kingdoms. In pathogenic fungi, they participate in important mechanisms of transfer of antifungal resistance and virulence, as well as in immune stimulation and prion transmission. However, studies on the functions of fungal EVs are still limited by the lack of efficient methods for isolation of these compartments. In this study, we developed an alternative protocol for isolation of fungal EVs and demonstrated an application of this new methodology in the study of the physiology of the fungal pathogen Cryptococcus gattii Our results describe a fast and reliable method for the study of fungal EVs and reveal the participation of scramblase, a phospholipid-translocating enzyme, in secretory processes of C. gattii.",CRISPR Interference for Rapid Knockdown of Essential Cell Cycle Genes in Lactobacillus plantarum.,https://www.ncbi.nlm.nih.gov/pubmed/30894429,mSphere,2019 05 20,"Studies of essential genes in bacteria are often hampered by the lack of accessible genetic tools.

We utilized the CRISPRi system to gain initial insights into the functions of key cell cycle genes in L. plantarum As a proof of concept, we investigated the phenotypes resulting from knockdowns of the cell wall hydrolase-encoding acm2 gene and of the DNA replication initiator gene dnaA and of ezrA, which encodes an early cell division protein. Furthermore, we studied the phenotypes of three cell division genes which have recently been functionally characterized in ovococcal bacteria but whose functions have not yet been investigated in rod-shaped bacteria. We show that the transmembrane CozE proteins do not seem to play any major role in cell division in L. plantarum On the other hand, RNA-binding proteins KhpA and EloR are critical for proper cell elongation in this bacterium.IMPORTANCEL. plantarum is an important bacterium for applications in food and health. Deep insights into the biology and physiology of this species are therefore necessary for further strain optimization and exploitation; however, the functions of essential genes in the bacterium are mainly unknown due to the lack of accessible genetic tools.

Signaling pathways triggered by B. abortus involves stimulator of IFN genes (STING), which leads to production of type I IFNs. In this study, we evaluated the pathway linking the unfolded protein response (UPR) and the endoplasmic reticulum-resident transmembrane molecule STING, during B. abortus infection. We demonstrated that B. abortus infection induces the expression of the UPR target gene BiP and XBP1 in murine macrophages through a STING-dependent pathway. Additionally, we also observed that STING activation was dependent on the bacterial second messenger cyclic dimeric GMP. Furthermore, the Brucella-induced UPR is crucial for induction of multiple molecules linked to type I IFN signaling pathway, such as IFN-β, IFN regulatory factor 1, and guanylate-binding proteins. Furthermore, IFN-β is also important for the UPR induction during B. abortus infection. Indeed, IFN-β shows a synergistic effect in inducing the IRE1 axis of the UPR. In addition, priming cells with IFN-β favors B. abortus survival in macrophages. Moreover, Brucella-induced UPR facilitates bacterial replication in vitro and in vivo. Finally, these results suggest that B. abortus-induced UPR is triggered by bacterial cyclic dimeric GMP, in a STING-dependent manner, and that this response supports bacterial replication. In summary, association of STING and IFN-β signaling pathways with Brucella-induced UPR unravels a novel link between innate immunity and endoplasmic reticulum stress that is crucial for bacterial infection outcome.",Expanded CD14hiCD16- Immunosuppressive Monocytes Predict Disease Severity in Patients with Acute Pancreatitis.,https://www.ncbi.nlm.nih.gov/pubmed/30894427,"Journal of immunology (Baltimore, Md. : 1950)",2019 04 23,"Mild acute pancreatitis (AP) is a self-limiting disease, whereas severe AP has high mortality because of enhanced systemic inflammation and multiple organ failure. In experimental models of AP, infiltration of monocytes and activation of monocyte-derived macrophages largely determine the severity of the disease. Our previous studies have shown that CD11b+Ly-6Chi inflammatory monocytes were mobilized from bone marrow into peripheral blood and inflamed pancreas during the early stage of AP. However, the phenotype and characteristics of circulating monocytes in patients with AP are not well defined. Fifty patients with AP and nine age- and sex-matched healthy volunteers were enrolled in this study. Compared with those of healthy volunteers, the proportion of CD14hiCD16- monocytes and the level of myeloid-related cytokines/chemokines were increased in AP patients within 48 h after disease onset, especially in patients with a severe disease course. Moreover, the increased monocyte proportions were associated with decreased HLA-DR expression and a reduced T cell count. Notably, dynamic changes in circulating CD14hiCD16- monocytes and their HLA-DR expression, as well as in CD4+ T cells, were obviously different between moderate severe AP and severe AP. Last, area under the receiver operating characteristic analysis showed that the combination of CD14hiCD16- monocyte proportions with their HLA-DR level had higher accuracy for predicting the severity of AP.

This implies the existence of an alternate receptor, whose identity we sought to pinpoint. We found that blockage of integrin β1 selectively hampered binding of mIgG3 to macrophages and mIgG3-mediated phagocytosis. Manganese, an integrin activator, increased mIgG3 binding to macrophages. Blockage of FcγRI or Itgb1 inhibited binding of different mIgG3 Abs to variable extents. Our results are consistent with the notion that Itgb1 functions as part of an IgG receptor complex. Given the more ancient origin of integrins in comparison with FcγR, this observation could have far-ranging implications for our understanding of the evolution of Ab-mediated immunity as well as in immunity to microorganisms, pathogenesis of autoimmune diseases, and Ab engineering.",Associations of screen work with neck and upper extremity symptoms: a systematic review with meta-analysis.,https://www.ncbi.nlm.nih.gov/pubmed/30894425,Occupational and environmental medicine,2019 06 14,"It has often been suggested that screen work (ie, work on desktop, laptop, notebook or tablet computers) is a risk factor for neck and upper extremity symptoms.

The actin cytoskeleton is known to be the main driving force for myoblast fusion; however, how actin is organized to direct intercellular fusion remains unclear. Here we show that an actin- and dynamin-2-enriched protrusive structure, the invadosome, is required for the fusion process of myogenesis. Upon differentiation, myoblasts acquire the ability to form invadosomes through isoform switching of a critical invadosome scaffold protein, Tks5. Tks5 directly interacts with and recruits dynamin-2 to the invadosome and regulates its assembly around actin filaments to strengthen the stiffness of dynamin-actin bundles and invadosomes. These findings provide a mechanistic framework for the acquisition of myogenic fusion machinery during myogenesis and reveal a novel structural function for Tks5 and dynamin-2 in organizing actin filaments in the invadosome to drive membrane fusion.",Designing a rigorous microscopy experiment: Validating methods and avoiding bias.,https://www.ncbi.nlm.nih.gov/pubmed/30894402,The Journal of cell biology,2019 06 10,"Images generated by a microscope are never a perfect representation of the biological specimen. Microscopes and specimen preparation methods are prone to error and can impart images with unintended attributes that might be misconstrued as belonging to the biological specimen. In addition, our brains are wired to quickly interpret what we see, and with an unconscious bias toward that which makes the most sense to us based on our current understanding. Unaddressed errors in microscopy images combined with the bias we bring to visual interpretation of images can lead to false conclusions and irreproducible imaging data. Here we review important aspects of designing a rigorous light microscopy experiment: validation of methods used to prepare samples and of imaging system performance, identification and correction of errors, and strategies for avoiding bias in the acquisition and analysis of images.","Prosthesis and the engineered imagination: reading augmentation and disability across cultural theory, representation and product design.",https://www.ncbi.nlm.nih.gov/pubmed/30894401,Medical humanities,2019 03 21,"This article argues for the value of considering the interaction of literary/cultural studies, disability studies and engineering/design studies in the ongoing development of a critical medical humanities research frame. With a specific focus on prosthesis, but also considerations of embodiment, technology and augmentation as concepts in both cultural/disability theory and engineering/design, we note how the shifting and plastic ideas of 'the prosthetic' as used within cultural studies have never been in conversation with scholars who work on prostheses in engineering design or the processes through which such technologies are produced. Additionally, we show that the increased use of systems engineering in the design and construction of prostheses creates fractured ideas of disabled bodies that frequently ignore both the cultural meaning and lived experience of technology use. In design and engineering, prostheses are literal objects, often made to order for a diverse range of clients and produced across different working platforms; in cultural studies, the word creates multiple resonances around both augmented bodies and non-embodied states increasingly understood in terms of assemblage and supplementarity. Working from this, we outline how questions of metaphor, materiality and systems weave through the different disciplines. The article claims that a critical dialogue between the working methods of literary/cultural studies and engineering/design, for all their obvious differences, possesses the potential to create informed and sophisticated accounts of disability embodiment. Our conclusion brings the strands of the enquiry together and points to the merits of engineering the imagination, and imagining engineering, as both a subject and method in future medical humanities research.",Comprehensive Analysis of Individual Variation in the Urinary Proteome Revealed Significant Gender Differences.,https://www.ncbi.nlm.nih.gov/pubmed/30894400,Molecular & cellular proteomics : MCP,2019 06 02,"Disease biomarkers are the measurable changes associated with a pathophysiological process. Without homeostatic control, urine accumulates systematic changes in the body. Thus, urine is an attractive biological material for the discovery of disease biomarkers. One of the major bottlenecks in urinary biomarker discovery is that the concentration and composition of urinary proteins are influenced by many physiological factors. To elucidate the individual variation and related factors influencing the urinary proteome, we comprehensively analyzed the urine samples from healthy adult donors (aged 20-69 years). Co-expression network analysis revealed protein clusters representing the metabolic status, gender-related differences and age-related differences in urinary proteins. In particular, we demonstrated that gender is a crucial factor contributing to individual variation. Proteins that were increased in the male urine samples include prostate-secreted proteins and TIMP1, a protein whose abundance alters under various cancers and renal diseases; however, the proteins that were increased in the female urine samples have known functions in the immune system. Nine gender-related proteins were validated on 85 independent samples by multiple reaction monitoring. Five of these proteins were further used to build a model that could accurately distinguish male and female urine samples with an area under curve value of 0.94. Based on the above results, we strongly suggest that future biomarker investigations should consider gender as a crucial factor in experimental design and data analysis. Finally, reference intervals of each urinary protein were estimated, providing a baseline for the discovery of abnormalities.",Parent Perceptions of Real-time Access to Their Hospitalized Child's Medical Records Using an Inpatient Portal: A Qualitative Study.,https://www.ncbi.nlm.nih.gov/pubmed/30894398,Hospital pediatrics,2019 06 13,"Engaging with parents in care improves pediatric care quality and patient safety; however, parents of hospitalized children often lack the information necessary to effectively participate.

To date, this diversity has largely been uncovered using short-read whole-genome sequencing. However, these short-read approaches fail to give a complete picture of a genome. They struggle to identify structural events, cannot access repetitive regions, and fail to resolve the human genome into haplotypes. Here, we describe an approach that retains long range information while maintaining the advantages of short reads. Starting from ∼1 ng of high molecular weight DNA, we produce barcoded short-read libraries. Novel informatic approaches allow for the barcoded short reads to be associated with their original long molecules producing a novel data type known as ""Linked-Reads"". This approach allows for simultaneous detection of small and large variants from a single library. In this manuscript, we show the advantages of Linked-Reads over standard short-read approaches for reference-based analysis. Linked-Reads allow mapping to 38 Mb of sequence not accessible to short reads, adding sequence in 423 difficult-to-sequence genes including disease-relevant genes STRC, SMN1, and SMN2 Both Linked-Read whole-genome and whole-exome sequencing identify complex structural variations, including balanced events and single exon deletions and duplications. Further, Linked-Reads extend the region of high-confidence calls by 68.9 Mb. The data presented here show that Linked-Reads provide a scalable approach for comprehensive genome analysis that is not possible using short reads alone.",Factors Affecting Continued Use of Subcutaneous Depot Medroxyprogesterone Acetate (DMPA-SC): A Secondary Analysis of a 1-Year Randomized Trial in Malawi.,https://www.ncbi.nlm.nih.gov/pubmed/30894394,"Global health, science and practice",2019 04 03,To assess the supply- and demand-side factors influencing continued use of the injectable contraceptive subcutaneous depot medroxyprogesterone acetate (DMPA-SC).,Ambulatory Blood Pressure Reduction With SGLT-2 Inhibitors: Dose-Response Meta-analysis and Comparative Evaluation With Low-Dose Hydrochlorothiazide.,https://www.ncbi.nlm.nih.gov/pubmed/30894383,Diabetes care,2019 04 07,"Sodium-glucose cotransporter (SGLT)-2 inhibitors lower clinic and ambulatory blood pressure (BP), possibly through their natriuretic action.

These studies revealed stage-dependent T- and B-cell functional and immune phenotypes; namely, early features that differentiate autoantibody-positive at-risk first-degree relatives (FDRs) from autoantibody-negative FDRs and persisted through clinical diagnosis; late features that arose at or near T1D diagnosis; and dynamic features that were enhanced early and blunted at later disease stages, indicating evolving responses along the continuum of T1D.

Most current usage is off-label, and the endovascular community is nearer the beginning than the end of the learning curve, given the number of devices in development. A comprehensive overview of technical specifications alongside key outcome data is essential both for clinical decision-making and to direct further investigations. Most-studied has been the Pipeline Embolization Device, which has undergone a transition to the Pipeline Flex for which outcome data are sparse or heterogeneous. Alternative endoluminal devices do not appear to be outperforming the Pipeline Embolization Device to date, though prospective studies and long-term data mostly are lacking, and between-study comparisons must be treated with caution. Nominal technical specifications may be unrelated to in situ performance, emphasizing the importance of correct radiologic sizing and device placement. Devices designed specifically for bifurcation aneurysms also lack long-term outcome data or have only recently become available for clinical use. There are no major studies directly comparing a flow-diverting device with standard coiling or microsurgical clipping. Data on flow-diverting stents are too limited in terms of long-term outcomes to reliably inform clinical decision-making. The best available evidence supports using a single endoluminal device for most indications. Recommendations on the suitability and choice of a device for bifurcation or ruptured aneurysms or for anatomically complex lesions cannot be made on the basis of current evidence.

We report on a patient with holoprosencephaly caused by a rare ZIC2 mutation presenting a bifid nose associated with a nasal fistula and an epidermal cyst, besides hypernatremia. The patient was a 1 year and 4 months old girl that developed an important neuropsychomotor delay. Currently, she uses a wheelchair to move around and only emits sounds. Computed tomography (CT) scan revealed a semilobar holoprosencephaly and a Dandy-Walker variant. Head magnetic resonance imaging also disclosed corpus callosum agenesis and prefrontal subarachnoid space enlargement. On physical examination at 1 year and 4 months of age, we verified growth retardation, microcephaly, bilateral epicantic fold, upslanting palpebral fissures, bifid nose, and limbs spasticity secondary to hypertonia. Later, she began to present hypernatremia; however, its precise cause was not identified. At 6 years and 10 months of age, a nasal fistula was suspected. Facial CT scan showed an epidermal cyst at cartilaginous portion of the nasal septum. High resolution GTG-Banding karyotype was normal.

However, extracellular production of pullulanase from recombinant Bacillus subtilis is limited and the loss of plasmids during fermentation of B. subtilis recombinants seriously affects the expression of the foreign protein, especially in large-scale production. In this study, a universal integrated plasmid was conducted harboring the pul cassette that included the pul gene encoding Bacillus naganoensis pullulanase (PUL), a constitutive promoter, PHpaII, and an extracellular signaling peptide, LipA. This cassette was inserted into the genomes of B. subtilis WB800 and B. subtilis WB600 by double homologous recombination. The pullulanase activity of up to 30.32 U/ml and 18.83 U/ml was achieved for B. subtilis WB800-PHpaII-pul and B. subtilis WB600-PHpaII-pul, respectively, under primary conditions. To further enhance the yield of PUL, the effects of four important factors (inoculum size, incubation temperature, shaking speed, and initial pH) on the expression of PUL in shake flask fermentation were evaluated by ""one-factor-at-a-time"" technique for B. subtilis WB800-PHpaII-pul. Consequently, the extracellular production of PUL was signiﬁcantly enhanced, resulting in an activity of 60.85 U/ml.",Beef tenderness and intramuscular fat proteomic biomarkers: Effect of gender and rearing practices.,https://www.ncbi.nlm.nih.gov/pubmed/30894324,Journal of proteomics,2019 04 22,"This study analyzed the effect of gender on the abundances of 20 protein biomarkers of tenderness and/or intramuscular fat content in five muscles: Longissimus thoracis, previously identified as biomarkers of tenderness and/or intramuscular Semimembranosus, Rectus abdominis, Triceps brachii and Semitendinosus, from cows and steers of the Protected Designation Origin Maine Anjou. The protein abundances were quantified using Reverse Phase Protein Array with specific validated antibodies. Among the 20 studied proteins, the abundance of 8 biomarkers involved in energetic metabolism, contraction and cellular stress, was different according to gender. The gender effect was different depending on the muscle type with greater abundances in Semitendinosus, Rectus abdominis and Longissimus thoracis muscles. On the basis of animal characteristics and rearing factors, three rearing practices classes were identified for cows. Among the factors, fattening duration modified the abundance of 12 proteins mainly in Triceps brachii muscle. A positive correlation between the abundance of the small HSP20 and slaughter age was observed in the 5 muscles. Two proteins, Four and a half LIM domains 1 (FHL1) and Glycogen phosphorylase (PYGB) appeared to be muscle, gender and rearing practices independent. These results constitute valuable data to understand how to manage beef quality by controlling these different factors. SIGNIFICANCE: This study is the first to compare the relative abundance of 20 proteins previously identified as biomarkers of tenderness and/or intramuscular fat (IMF) content of beef meat between cows and steers among 5 different muscles. Its originality is in the use of Reverse Phase Protein Array for fast quantification of the proteins and the integration of data from rearing factors, carcass characteristics and biomarkers of meat qualities. The findings provide evidence for modulating biomarker levels by controlling the choice of animal type and rearing factors according to the type of muscle that would produce animals with the desired meat qualities.",Differential induction of nuclear factor-like 2 signature genes with toll-like receptor stimulation.,https://www.ncbi.nlm.nih.gov/pubmed/30894323,Free radical biology & medicine,2019 04 29,"Inflammation is associated with production of reactive oxygen species (ROS) and results in the induction of thioredoxin (TXN) and peroxiredoxins (PRDXs) and activation of nuclear factor-like 2 (Nrf2). In this study we have used the mouse RAW 264.7 macrophage and the human THP-1 monocyte cell line to investigate the pattern of expression of three Nrf2 target genes, PRDX1, TXN reductase (TXNRD1) and heme oxygenase (HMOX1), by activation of different Toll-like receptors (TLRs). We found that, while the TLR4 agonist lipopolysaccharide (LPS) induces all three genes, the pattern of induction with agonists for TLR1/2, TLR3, TLR2/6 and TLR7/8 differs depending on the gene and the cell line. In all cases, the extent of induction was HMOX1>TXNRD1>PRDX1. Since LPS was a good inducer of all genes in both cell lines, we studied the mechanisms mediating LPS induction of the three genes using mouse RAW 264.7 cells. To assess the role of ROS we used the antioxidant N-acetylcysteine (NAC). Only LPS induction of HMOX1 was inhibited by NAC while that of TXNRD1 and PRDX1 was unaffected. These three genes were also induced by phorbol myristate acetate (PMA), a ROS-inducer acting by activation of protein kinase C (PKC). The protein kinase inhibitor staurosporine inhibited the induction of all three genes by PMA but only that of HMOX1 by LPS. This indicates that activation of these genes by inflammatory agents is regulated by different mechanisms involving either ROS or protein kinases, or both.",Sustained release of exendin-4 from tannic acid/Fe (III) nanoparticles prolongs blood glycemic control in a mouse model of type II diabetes.,https://www.ncbi.nlm.nih.gov/pubmed/30894322,Journal of controlled release : official journal of the Controlled Release Society,2019 05 04,"Exendin-4 has been clinically adopted as an effective drug for treating type 2 diabetes (T2D), but its short circulation half-life in the blood requires two injections per day to maintain effective glycemic control. This significantly limits its clinical application. In this study, we developed a tannic acid/exendin-4/Fe3+ ternary nanoparticle system to provide sustained release of exendin-4 in vivo. The formation of these nanoparticles relies on TA/exendin-4 complexation and stabilization through TA-Fe3+ coordination, where the rapid reaction kinetics can benefit from efficient mixing of all three components. Adapting our recently developed flash nanocomplexation (FNC) method, we formulated nanoparticles with high encapsulation efficiency (~ 100%) of exendin-4, high payload capacity, and high degrees of uniformity and stability because the rapid turbulent mixing facilitated a homogeneous distribution of all three components in the complexation process. Intraperitoneal injection in mice showed that exendin-4 released from the nanoparticles had an AUC 7.2-fold higher than the free exendin-4 injection. Efficacy study in a T2D mouse model showed that the optimized formulation achieved a rapid reduction of the blood glucose level to the normal range within <12 h and maintained the same level for 72 h following a single intraperitoneal dose. The blood glucose level was maintained to below the therapeutic level (< 15 mmol/L) for 6 days, and the treatment led to reduced body weight with pathological and functional improvements in the kidney and liver. This tannic acid/exendin-4/Fe3+ ternary nanoparticle system holds translational potential in treating T2D, due to its improved treatment outcomes in terms of extended release of exendin-4, prolonged control of blood glucose level, reduced dosing frequency, and improved pathological indicators.","U.S. prescribing trends of fentanyl, opioids, and other pain medications in outpatient and emergency department visits from 2006 to 2015.",https://www.ncbi.nlm.nih.gov/pubmed/30894321,Preventive medicine,2019 06 10,"The United States is currently facing an epidemic of opioid-related deaths, increasingly associated with fentanyl use.

The proportion of all outpatient visits in which any pain medication was prescribed increased from 15.0% in 2006-2007 to 20.5% in 2014-2015 (p < 0.001). The proportion of all outpatient visits in which any fentanyl product was prescribed remained stable at 0.3% and 0.4% (p = 0.32), but increased among ED visits from 0.5% to 1.1% (p = 0.006). In contrast, the proportion of all outpatient visits in which any opioid product was prescribed increased from 6.6% to 9.7% (p < 0.001), but remained relatively stable among ED visits from 26.2% to 24.4% (p = 0.07). Non-opioid pain medication prescription increased in both settings, from 9.7% to 13.7% (p < 0.001) in the outpatient setting and from 25.6% to 27.6% (p = 0.02) in the ED setting between 2006-2007 and 2014-2015, respectively. To address current opioid crisis, both clinical and public health interventions are needed, such as targeted education outreach on evidence-based opioid prescribing and non-opioid alternatives.",The evolution of collective infectious units in viruses.,https://www.ncbi.nlm.nih.gov/pubmed/30894320,Virus research,2019 05 01,"Viruses frequently spread among cells or hosts in groups, with multiple viral genomes inside the same infectious unit. These collective infectious units can consist of multiple viral genomes inside the same virion, or multiple virions inside a larger structure such as a vesicle. Collective infectious units deliver multiple viral genomes to the same cell simultaneously, which can have important implications for viral pathogenesis, antiviral resistance, and social evolution. However, little is known about why some viruses transmit in collective infectious units, whereas others do not. We used a simple evolutionary approach to model the potential costs and benefits of transmitting in a collective infectious unit. We found that collective infectious units could be favoured if cells infected by multiple viral genomes were significantly more productive than cells infected by just one viral genome, and especially if there were also efficiency benefits to packaging multiple viral genomes inside the same infectious unit. We also found that if some viral sequences are defective, then collective infectious units could evolve to become very large, but that if these defective sequences interfered with wild-type virus replication, then collective infectious units were disfavoured.",Sonothrombolysis in ST-Segment Elevation Myocardial Infarction Treated With Primary Percutaneous Coronary Intervention.,https://www.ncbi.nlm.nih.gov/pubmed/30894317,Journal of the American College of Cardiology,2019 06 07,Preclinical studies have demonstrated that high mechanical index (MI) impulses from a diagnostic ultrasound transducer during an intravenous microbubble infusion (sonothrombolysis) can restore epicardial and microvascular flow in acute ST-segment elevation myocardial infarction (STEMI).,Inhibition of Drp1 after traumatic brain injury provides brain protection and improves behavioral performance in rats.,https://www.ncbi.nlm.nih.gov/pubmed/30894316,Chemico-biological interactions,2019 05 13,"The imbalance between mitochondrial fusion and fission has been implicated in cerebral ischemia and several neurodegenerative diseases. However, the role of mitochondrial fission in traumatic brain injury (TBI) remains poorly understood. Mitochondrial fission is mediated by dynamin-related protein 1 (Drp1), which is highly expressed in the nervous system. In the present study, we investigated the changes in Drp1 expression in the ipsilateral hippocampus of rats after TBI and the effects of Mdivi-1 (a selective inhibitor of Drp1) as a post-insult treatment for TBI. Our findings showed that the protein levels of Drp1 were increased at 6 h and peaked at 12 h post-TBI, but we did not observe Drp1 phosphorylation at Ser616, Ser637, Ser40 or Ser44 during this process. We examined the effect of Mdivi-1 on trauma-induced brain damage in both vitro and vivo. In cells, Mdivi-1 significantly attenuated H2O2-induced mitochondrial membrane potential (MMP) dissipation in PC-12 cells. Three days of Mdivi-1 treatment significantly reduced the cortical lesion volume, blood-brain barrier permeability, brain edema and oxidative stress. Mdivi-1 reduced activated caspase-3 release in the cortical border zone and hippocampal dentate gyrus three days after TBI. Furthermore, treatment with Mdivi-1 for 4 weeks rescued neurogenesis in DG and attenuated hippocampal atrophy. Regarding behavioral outcomes, Mdivi-1-treated TBI rats showed a significant improvement in water maze acquisition and retention compared with the saline-treated TBI rats. Moreover, Mdivi-1 treatment reduced anxiety-like behavior in an open-field test. Our results support the notion that Mdivi-1 provides brain protection and improves the behavioral performance in TBI rats.",Erythropoietin attenuates high glucose-induced oxidative stress and inhibition of osteogenic differentiation in periodontal ligament stem cell (PDLSCs).,https://www.ncbi.nlm.nih.gov/pubmed/30894315,Chemico-biological interactions,2019 05 10,"Diabetes mellitus and periodontitis have long been considered to be biologically linked. Erythropoietin (EPO) has multiple biological functions, such as stimulating the proliferation and differentiation of erythroid progenitor cells and reducing glucose-induced oxidative stress via different mechanisms, acting as a direct antioxidant. The purposes of the study to examine the anti-oxidative effect of EPO on reducing high glucose-induced oxidative stress of hPDLSCs and provide a better understanding of the mechanism of these processes. PDLSCs were induced by highglucose (HG, 30 mM) in the presence or absence of EPO. Cell proliferation was measured by MTT assay. The reactiveoxygen species (ROS) level, malondialdehyde (MDA) level and superoxide dismutase (SOD) activity were detected to evaluate oxidative stress. qRT-PCR and western blot analysis were used to examine the expression of osteogenic related genes and protein (Runx2 and Osterix). Alizarin Red-S staining was used to detect mineralized nodule formation. The results showed that EPO promote the proliferation of PDLSCs, which was suppressed by high glucose (30 mM). Moreover, EPO attenuated high glucose (30 mM) induced oxidative stress by reducing the levels of ROS and MDA, and increasing the SOD activity. Furthermore,EPO alleviate high glucose(30 mM) induced suppression of osteogenic differentiation ability in PDLSCs, as evidenced by the up-regulated mRNA and protein expression of Runx2 and Osterix and increased ALP activity. In conclusion, EPO attenuates high glucose-induced oxidative stress, inhibitory effect of proliferation and inhibition of osteogenic differentiation in periodontal ligament stem cell (PDLSCs)."

Clinical endocrinology & metabolism,2019 03 21,"Acromegaly is a rare disease, associated with multiple organs and systems damage. Thanks to implementation of registries, systematic data gathering, knowledge sharing and standardizing medical practices for optimal care greatly improved. Data concerning 19 national acromegaly registries are available, involving more than 16,000 patients. The weighted mean age of diagnosis is 45.2 years and seems stable over time. A macroadenoma is found in 75% of the cases. The proportion of patients operated (>80%) did not change along time. By contrast, use of radiotherapy has decreased while use of medical therapy increased. If judged on IGF-I levels, acromegaly is controlled in 61.3% of the patients. The disease control rate has improved over time. This is likely due to the development of medical treatment strategies. The collection of data about comorbidities in national registries is much less comprehensive than those about epidemiology, disease control or treatment strategies. The most reported comorbidities are arterial hypertension and diabetes. Data concerning mortality trends are controversial. It seems that cancer has become a leading cause of death in acromegaly patients in the last decade, period in which life expectancy improved, while cardiovascular mortality decreased. In conclusion, acromegaly registries offer a global view of the disease with no ""a priori"" assumptions. This is of outmost importance, because of the large amount of data and the huge number of associated comorbidities. This will help to establish guidelines for management of this rare disease.",Incorporation of Transcranial Doppler into the ED for the neurocritical care patient.,https://www.ncbi.nlm.nih.gov/pubmed/30894296,The American journal of emergency medicine,2019 06 08,"In the catastrophic neurologic emergency, a complete neurological exam is not always possible or feasible given the time-sensitive nature of the underlying disease process, or if emergent airway management is indicated. As the neurologic exam may be limited in some patients, the emergency physician is reliant on the assessment of brainstem structures to determine neurological function. Physicians thus routinely depend on advanced imaging modalities to further investigate for potential catastrophic diagnoses. Acquiring these tests introduces the risks of transport as well as delays in managing time-sensitive neurologic processes. A more immediate, non-invasive bedside approach complementing these modalities has evolved: Transcranial Doppler (TCD).",Patterns of impaired social cognition in children and adolescents with epilepsy: The borders between different epilepsy phenotypes.,https://www.ncbi.nlm.nih.gov/pubmed/30894295,Epilepsy & behavior : E&B,2019 03 21,"Over the past decade, a growing number of studies have shown that children and adolescents with focal and generalized epilepsies have marked impairments in social cognition, including deficits in facial emotion perception (FEP) and Theory of Mind (ToM). At present, it remains unclear whether FEP and ToM impairments are comparable in children with focal and generalized epilepsies or whether distinct syndrome-specific deficits have emerged. This question of whether unique or overlapping social cognitive profiles exist in epilepsy is of interest, given that the revised International League Against Epilepsy (ILAE) classification guidelines propose that seizures arise from a diseased network (i.e., network account), rather than being confined to discrete regions near the site of seizure foci (i.e., localization account). The purpose of this review was as follows: (1) to summarize studies examining FEP and ToM in pediatric patients with epilepsy, (2) to examine epilepsy and psychosocial correlates of these difficulties, and (3) to determine whether patterns of sociocognitive impairment better support a localization or neural network account of epilepsy. Twelve studies were reviewed examining FEP (N = 5) and/or ToM (N = 8). Findings revealed significant FEP and ToM impairments across the studied subgroups with epilepsy, which did not differ between children with generalized and focal (localization-related) epilepsies nor among children with different subtypes of localization-related epilepsy. Similarly, other epilepsy variables (i.e., seizure frequency, side of seizure focus, number of antiepileptic drugs (AEDs) or surgical status) were not related to FEP or ToM, with the exception of younger age at seizure onset and longer duration of epilepsy. Several studies documented a significant relationship between impaired ToM and reduced social competence in pediatric patients with epilepsy, whereas evidence for a relationship between FEP and psychosocial functioning is currently weak. In conclusion, findings suggest that social cognitive impairments represent a shared feature of epilepsy in childhood. The results support a neural network account of epilepsy, in which a shared neural network of dysfunction may be underlying social cognitive deficits in this group. Further research is needed to examine the functional correlates of social cognitive impairments, as well as to evaluate screening tools and treatment methods to identify and address significant social and emotional difficulties in this patient group.

Using biochemical approaches, we show this arises due to both slower template unwinding following helicase-polymerase uncoupling and establishment of prolonged stalled fork structures. Fork slowing and stalling occur at structurally distinct lesions, are always associated with continued lagging-strand synthesis, are observed when either Pol ε or Pol δ stalls at leading-strand damage, and do not require specific helicase-polymerase coupling factors. Hence, the key trigger for these replisome-intrinsic responses is cessation of leading-strand polymerization, revealing this as a crucial driver of normal replication fork rates. We propose that this helps balance the need for sufficient uncoupling to activate the DNA replication checkpoint with excessive destabilizing single-stranded DNA exposure in eukaryotes.",The three-dimensional landscape of the genome in human brain tissue unveils regulatory mechanisms leading to schizophrenia risk.,https://www.ncbi.nlm.nih.gov/pubmed/30894290,Schizophrenia research,2019 04 14,"Recent advances in our understanding of the genetic architecture of schizophrenia have shed light on the schizophrenia etiology. While common variation is one of the major genetic contributors, the majority of common variation reside in non-coding genome, posing a significant challenge in understanding the functional impact of this class of genetic variation. Functional genomic datasets that range from expression quantitative trait loci (eQTL) to chromatin interactions are critical to identify the potential target genes and functional consequences of non-coding variation. In this review, we discuss how three-dimensional chromatin landscape, identified by a technique called Hi-C, has facilitated the identification of potential target genes impacting schizophrenia risk. We outline key steps for Hi-C driven gene mapping, and compare Hi-C defined schizophrenia risk genes defined across developmental epochs and cell types, which offer rich insights into the temporal window and cellular etiology of schizophrenia. In contrast with a neurodevelopmental hypothesis in schizophrenia, Hi-C defined schizophrenia risk genes are postnatally enriched, suggesting that postnatal development is also important for schizophrenia pathogenesis. Moreover, Hi-C defined schizophrenia risk genes are highly expressed in excitatory neurons, highlighting excitatory neurons as a central cell type for schizophrenia. Further characterization of Hi-C defined schizophrenia risk genes demonstrated enrichment for genes that harbor loss-of-function variation in neurodevelopmental disorders, suggesting a shared genetic etiology between schizophrenia and neurodevelopmental disorders. Collectively, moving the search space from risk variants to the target genes lays a foundation to understand the neurobiological basis of schizophrenia.",Peri-urban black rats host a rich assembly of ticks and healthier rats have more ticks.,https://www.ncbi.nlm.nih.gov/pubmed/30894289,Ticks and tick-borne diseases,2019 05 24,"The black rat Rattus rattus has a distribution that includes much of Earth's terrestrial surface, and has adapted to exploit both habitats extensively modified by humans and rural habitats. Despite the fact that R. rattus are nearly ubiquitous, few studies have investigated urban or peri-urban R. rattus as potential hosts for ticks. In this study, we identified the species of ticks that parasitize R. rattus in a remnant bush area within Sydney, Australia. We then examined the relationship between ticks and R. rattus by testing several rat body characteristics as predictors of tick abundance. We show that larva and nymphs of five species of native Australian tick parasitize R. rattus in urban Australia. The most abundance species was Ixodes holocyclus, a tick of veterinary and human health concern. We found that ticks were more abundant on R. rattus in better condition, for larva and nymphs of I. holocyclus and I. tasmani. Rattus rattus supports a rich assembly of ticks in a remnant forest in urban Australia, and as the R. rattus in best condition have the most ticks, tick parasitism at the levels observed does not appear to negatively impact R. rattus. Our findings illustrate that R. rattus, and other human commensal species, may be important hosts for ticks in human modified environments."

UVC irradiation synchronized the biological clock system and induced time-dependent expression of clock genes including Clock, Cry1, and Per1. The rhythmic expression of clock genes is also followed by time-dependent mRNA degradation or non-canonical translation initiation of clock genes. Furthermore, we show a translocation of PERIOD1 (PER1) protein after UVC irradiation, which mediates the rhythmic feedback loop of clock genes. Our results suggest that UVC can synchronize the circadian clock system, and induces rhythmic expression of clock genes via time-dependent transcription, post-transcription, and post-translational modification.",CD8 T cell-derived perforin aggravates secondary spinal cord injury through destroying the blood-spinal cord barrier.,https://www.ncbi.nlm.nih.gov/pubmed/30894275,Biochemical and biophysical research communications,2019 04 16,"Perforin plays an important role in autoimmune and infectious diseases, but its function in immune inflammatory responses after spinal cord injury (SCI) has received insufficient attention. The goal of this study is to determine the influence of perforin after spinal cord injury (SCI) on secondary inflammation. Compared recovery from SCI in perforin knockout (Prf1-/-) and wild-type(WT)mice, WT mice had significantly lower the Basso mouse score (BMS), CatWalk XT, and motor-evoked potentials (MEPs) than Prf1-/- mice. Spinal cord lesions were also more obvious through glial fibrillary acidic protein (GFAP), Nissl, and terminal deoxynucleotidyl transferase-mediated dUTP-biotin nick end labeling (TUNEL) staining. Furthermore, the blood-spinal cord barrier (BSCB) disruption was more severe and inflammatory cytokine levels were higher. Flow cytometry indicated that perforin mainly originated from CD8 T cells. With flow cytometry and enzyme-linked immunosorbent assay (ELISA), human cerebrospinal fluid (CSF) yielded similar results. Together, this study firstly demonstrated that CD8 T cell-derived perforin is detrimental to SCI recovery in the mouse model. Mechanistically, this effect occurs because perforin increases BSCB permeability, causing inflammatory cells and related cytokines to infiltrate and disrupt the nervous system.",Animal models of chronic pain increase spontaneous glutamatergic transmission in adult rat spinal dorsal horn in vitro and in vivo.,https://www.ncbi.nlm.nih.gov/pubmed/30894274,Biochemical and biophysical research communications,2019 04 16,"The ability to detect noxious stimulation is essential to an organism's survival and wellbeing. Chronic pain is characterized by abnormal sensitivity to normal stimulation coupled with a feeling of unpleasantness. This condition afflicts people worldwide and severely impacts their quality of life and has become an escalating health problem. The spinal cord dorsal horn is critically involved in nociception and chronic pain. Especially, the substantia gelatinosa (SG) neurons of lamina II, which receives nociceptive inputs from primary afferents. Two major models are used to study chronic pain in animals, including nerve injury and the injection of a complete Freund's adjuvant (CFA) into the hind paw. However, how these models induce glutamatergic synaptic plasticity in the spinal cord is not fully understood. Here, we studied synaptic plasticity on excitatory transmissions in the adult rat SG neurons. Using in vitro and in vivo whole-cell patch-clamp recording methods, we analyzed spontaneous excitatory postsynaptic currents (sEPSCs) 2 weeks following nerve injury and 1 week following CFA injection. In the spinal slice preparation, these models increased both the frequency and amplitude of sEPSCs in SG neurons. The frequency and amplitude of sEPSCs in the nerve injury and the CFA group were reduced by the presence of tetrodotoxin (TTX). By contrast, TTX did not reduce the sEPSCs compared with miniature EPSCs in naïve rats. Next, we analyzed the active electrophysiological properties of neurons, which included; resting membrane potentials (RMPs) and the generation of action potentials (APs) in vitro. Interestingly, about 20% of recorded SG neurons in this group elicited spontaneous APs (sAPs) without changing the RMPs. Furthermore, we performed in vivo whole-cell patch-clamp recording in SG neurons to analyze active electrophysiological properties under physiological conditions. Importantly, in vivo SG neurons generated sAPs without affecting RMP in the nerve injury and the CFA group. Our study describes how animal models of chronic pain influence both passive and active electrophysiological properties of spinal SG neurons.","Retrospective study of a 16 year cohort of BRCA1 and BRCA2 carriers presenting for RRSO: Prevalence of invasive and in-situ carcinoma, with follow-up.",https://www.ncbi.nlm.nih.gov/pubmed/30894273,Gynecologic oncology,2019 04 27,"Carriers of BRCA1 and BRCA2 mutations are at increased risk of high grade serous carcinoma and are therefore offered risk-reducing salpingo-oophorectomy (RRSO) by 40-45 years.

Patients received cyclophosphamide (Day - 7), fludarabine (Days - 6 through - 2), and subcutaneous interleukin-2 (Days - 1, 1, 3, 5, 7, and 9). Purified, unmanipulated NK cells were infused on Day 0, and NK cell chimerism and phenotyping from peripheral blood were performed on Days 7, 14, 21, and 28. As primary endpoint, the event-free survival was compared to a cohort of 55 patients who completed chemotherapy and were in first complete remission but did not receive NK cells. Donor NK cell kinetics were determined as secondary endpoints. Twenty-one patients (median age at diagnosis, 6.0 years [range, 0.1-15.3 years]) received a median of 12.5 × 106 NK cells/kg (range, 3.6-62.2 × 106 cells/kg) without major side effects.

Within the LVA subgroup, Cav3.2 T-type Ca2+ channels seem to be of special importance as qPCR revealed a steady increase in Cav3.2 transcript levels over age, e.g. in the cochlea and spiral ganglion neurons (SGN). Furthermore, pharmacological studies suggested an association between Cav3.2 expression and both age-related and noise-induced hearing loss. Given the potential functional relevance of Cav3.2 VGGCs in sensorineural hearing loss, we recorded gender specific auditory evoked brainstem responses (ABRs) upon both click and tone burst presentation.

Due to the infections caused by the various bacterial ureases found in infectious agents such as Bacillus pasteurii, Brucella abortus, H. pylori, H. mustelae, Klebsiella aerogenes, Klebsiella tuberculosis, Mycobacterium tuberculosis, Pseudomonas putida, Sporosarcina pasteurii and Yersinia enterocolitica, it has been a current topic of today's research.

Indeed, lack of data regarding infant risk during breastfeeding far too often results in discontinuation of breastfeeding and subsequent loss of all the associated benefits to the breastfed infant. In the absence of age-specific toxicity data, human lactation data alone are considered insufficient to rapidly generate the required evidence regarding risks associated with medication use during lactation.","Pharmacokinetics, Placental and Breastmilk Transfer of Antiretroviral Drugs in Pregnant and Lactating Women Living with HIV.",https://www.ncbi.nlm.nih.gov/pubmed/30894103,Current pharmaceutical design,2019 03 21,"Remarkable progress has been achieved in the identification of HIV infection in pregnant women and prevention of vertical HIV transmission through maternal antiretroviral treatment (ART) and neonatal antiretroviral drug (ARV) prophylaxis in the last two decades.

Traditional spectroscopic methods of free sulfhydryl detection, such as Ellman's reagent, generally require a relatively large amount of sample, preventing their use for the analysis of biotherapeutics early in the development cycle. These spectroscopic methods also cannot accurately determine the location of the free sulfhydryl, further limiting their utility. Mass spectrometry was used to detect free sulfhydryl residues in intact proteins after labeling with Maleimide-PEG2-Biotin. As little as 2% cysteine residues with free sulfhydryls (0.02 mol SH per mol protein) could be detected by this method. Following reduction, the free sulfhydryl abundance on antibody heavy and light chains could be measured. To determine free sulfhydryl location at peptide-level resolution, free sulfhydryls and cysteines involved in disulfide bonds were differentially labeled with N-ethylmaleimide and d5-N-ethylmaleimide, respectively. Following enzymatic digestion and nanoLC-MS, the abundance of free sulfhydryls at individual cysteine residues was quantified down to 2%. The method was optimized to avoid non-specific labeling, disulfide bond scrambling, and maleimide exchange and hydrolysis.

Dried blood spots were collected from patients suspected of malaria visiting a hospital and two private laboratories in district Bannu and processed for species-specific PCR (rRNA). Patients were also screened for malaria through microscopy and RDT. A well-structured questionnaire was used to collect patient information to assess risk factors for malaria. Of 2033 individuals recruited, 21.1% (N = 429) were positive for malaria by at least one method. Overall, positivity detected by PCR was 30.5% (95/311) followed by 17.7% by microscopy (359/2033) and 16.4% by RDT (266/1618). Plasmodium vivax (16.9%, N = 343) was detected as the dominant species followed by Plasmodium falciparum (2.3%, N = 47) and mixed infections (1.2%, N = 39). Microscopy and RDT (Cohen's kappa k = 0.968, p = <0.0001, McNemar test p = 0.069) displayed significant agreement with each other. Satisfactory health, sleeping indoors, presence of health-care facility in vicinity (at an accessible range from home), living in upper middle class and in concrete houses significantly reduced malaria risk; whereas, low literacy level, presence of domestic animals indoors and malaria diagnosis recommended by clinician increased the disease risk. Overall, findings from the study provide reasonable basis for use of RDT as a cost-effective screening tool in field and for clinicians who can proceed with timely treatment of malaria patients.

Since exercise hemodynamics are increasingly recognized as important clinical information in patients with PH, our goal was to review the literature in this field to provide a basis for clinical use, further studies, and future recommendations. We identified 69 studies (published since 1968) reporting RHC data in 2819 patients with COPD, of whom 2561 underwent exercise testing. Few studies simultaneously measured gas exchange during exercise. Overall, these studies showed large variations in the patient populations and research questions studied and the methods and definitions employed. Despite these limitations, the data consistently demonstrated the presence of precapillary PH at rest in up to 38% of patients with COPD. With exercise, a relevant proportion of patients developed an abnormal hemodynamic response, depending on the definition used. Furthermore, some studies assessed right ventricular function during exercise and showed a blunted increase in right ventricular ejection fraction. Drug effects and the impact of interventional procedures were also studied. Again, due to large variations in the patients studied and the methods used, firm conclusions are difficult to derive. Despite the limitations of this dataset, several recommendations with respect to technical aspects (body position, exercise protocol, and data acquisition) can be inferred for this challenging patient population and may be helpful for further studies or recommendations.",Bacterial Colonization in COPD Patients Admitted to a Rehabilitation Respiratory Unit and Impact on Length of Stay: A Real-Life Study.,https://www.ncbi.nlm.nih.gov/pubmed/30894078,COPD,2019 03 21,"Bacterial colonization is a well-known phenomenon in acute care, but scant information is available regarding the rehabilitation setting.

We also compared hospital admissions (HA) with versus without positive cultures and with versus without MDR and investigated which baseline variables may predict length of stay (LOS) > 30 days. Of 286 COPD admissions (involving 269 patients, age 71 ± 11 years, males 66%), culture samples were requested in 62 (22%). The rate of colonization and of MDR organisms was 61 and 39%, respectively. Patients with a positive culture had a worse clinical condition and disability, and were more frequently tracheostomized, on invasive mechanical ventilation (MV) and admitted from/discharged to acute care. Patients with MDR cultures showed a lower exercise tolerance. Factors predicting LOS > 30 days were the presence of comorbidities, invasive MV, age > 65 years, and lower functional status, but not a positive culture or MDR presence. To our knowledge, this is the first real-life Italian study investigating the epidemiology of colonization and the association between colonization and LOS in a respiratory rehabilitation setting.

The onset of the disease is often unnoticed in case of glaucoma, the effect of which is felt only at a later stage. Diagnosis of such degenerative diseases warrants early diagnosis and treatment. In this work, performance of statistical and textural features in retinal vessel segmentation is evaluated through classifiers like extreme learning machine, support vector machine and Random Forest. The fundus images are initially preprocessed for any noise reduction, image enhancement and contrast adjustment. The two-dimensional Gabor Wavelets and Partition Clustering is employed on the preprocessed image to extract the blood vessels. Finally, the combined hybrid features comprising statistical textural, intensity and vessel morphological features, extracted from the image, are used to detect glaucomatous abnormality through the classifiers. A crisp decision can be taken depending on the classifying rates of the classifiers. Public databases RIM-ONE and high-resolution fundus and local datasets are used for evaluation with threefold cross validation. The evaluation is based on performance metrics through accuracy, sensitivity and specificity. The evaluation of hybrid features obtained an overall accuracy of 97% when tested using classifiers. The support vector machine classifier is able to achieve an accuracy of 93.33% on high-resolution fundus, 93.8% on RIM-ONE dataset and 95.3% on local dataset. For extreme learning machine classifier, the accuracy is 95.1% on high-resolution fundus, 97.8% on RIM-ONE and 96.8% on local dataset. An accuracy of 94.5% on high-resolution fundus 92.5% on RIM-ONE and 94.2% on local dataset is obtained for the random forest classifier. Validation of the experiment results indicate that the hybrid features can be deployed in supervised classifiers to discriminate retinal abnormalities effectively.",Do Doppler Changes Reflect Pathology of Placental Vascular Lesions in IUGR Pregnancies?,https://www.ncbi.nlm.nih.gov/pubmed/30894076,Pediatric and developmental pathology : the official journal of the Society for Pediatric Pathology and the Paediatric Pathology Society,2019 03 21,"Doppler assessment of uteroplacental (UP) and fetoplacental (FP) circulation detects abnormal waveforms in intrauterine growth-restricted (IUGR) pregnancies.

This could be an inherent and adaptive characteristic of inferential learning allowing rapid and prolonged retention while maintaining a hypothesis status for easy abandonment in case of new evidence suggesting erroneous inference. These characteristics dictate boundary conditions for learning through FM that are best investigated by examining memory dynamics rather than memory quantity and necessitate more nuanced interpretations than recent reviews of FM in children and adults offer.,Sensory sensitivity in autism mostly depends on contextual predictions.,https://www.ncbi.nlm.nih.gov/pubmed/30894074,Cognitive neuroscience,2019 05 23,"A signal detection theory was elaborated in order to account for three types of sensory sensitivity (subjective, behavioral and neural) in neurotypical individuals and in autism. Here, we argue that the predictive coding framework could better account for the atypical pattern of sensory sensitivity in autism. We review the idea that sensory sensitivity should be considered as mostly depending on contextual predictions and that these account for the heterogeneous pattern of neural responses.",Loss of MIEF1/MiD51 confers susceptibility to BAX-mediated cell death and PINK1-PRKN-dependent mitophagy.,https://www.ncbi.nlm.nih.gov/pubmed/30894073,Autophagy,2019 03 29,"Mitochondrial dynamics is highly implicated in a plethora of cellular processes including apoptosis and mitophagy. However, little is known about the scope and precise functions of mitochondrial dynamics proteins for mitochondrial quality control and cellular homeostasis. Whether mitochondrial dynamics proteins serve in cellular processes reliant on mitochondrial fission-fusion is still not fully explored. MIEF1/MiD51 (mitochondrial elongation factor 1) is known to promote mitochondrial fission via the recruitment of GTPase protein DNM1L/DRP1 (dynamin 1 like), but the fundamental understandings of MIEF1 for mitochondrial-dependent cellular processes are largely elusive. Here, we report novel roles of MIEF1 in responding to apoptotic stimuli and mitochondrial damage. Given our result that staurosporine (STS) treatment induced the degradation of MIEF1 via the ubiquitin-proteasome system (UPS), we are motivated to explore the role of MIEF1 in apoptosis. MIEF1 loss triggered the imbalance of BCL2 family members on the mitochondria, consequently initiating the translocation of BAX onto the mitochondria, catalyzing the decrease of mitochondrial membrane potential and promoting the release of DIABLO/SMAC (diablo IAP-binding mitochondrial protein) and CYCS (cytochrome c, somatic). We further demonstrate that MIEF1 deficiency impaired mitochondrial respiration and induced mitochondrial oxidative stress, sensitizing cells to PINK1-PRKN-mediated mitophagy. The recruitment of PRKN to depolarized mitochondria modulated the UPS-dependent degradation of MFN2 (mitofusin 2) and FIS1 (fission, mitochondrial 1) specifically, to further promote mitophagy. Our findings uncover a bridging role of MIEF1 integrating cell death and mitophagy, unlikely dependent on mitochondrial dynamics, implying new insights to mechanisms determining cellular fate.

This study aims to evaluate the effect of posterior tibial slope on restoring adequate knee stability and flexion after UKA in patients with ACLD. A total of 15 fresh cadaveric knees were divided into three groups: intact ACL, partial ACLD, and complete ACLD. Fixed-bearing UKAs including 3-D-printed tibial inserts with the slopes ranging from 3° to 12° were performed using computer-assisted navigation. Blinded evaluation of knee motion and anterior knee translation with knees flexed 20° and 90° was conducted using KT-arthrometry and stress radiography. A 1° slope increase translated the knees anteriorly by 0.85 mm and 0.76 mm in 20° and 90° of knee flexion for a complete ACLD ( R = 0.7 and 0.8, respectively, p < 0.001) compared to 0.5-0.6 mm for the normal and partial ACLD groups, respectively. Setting a slope of 5-8° of UKA for an intact ACL maintained both the stability and the motion of native knees. No significant changes of knee translation and flexion ability were observed after leveling the slopes at 5-7° and 5-6° for partial and complete ACLD, respectively ( p > 0.05 for all comparisons). In conclusion, UKA in complete ACLD knees is challenging since 1° of slope change nearly doubles the degree of knee translation compared to ACL-intact knees. The optimum posterior tibial slopes for fixed-bearing UKA patients with partial and complete ACLD are 5-7° and 5-6°, respectively.",Little evidence for fast mapping in adults with developmental amnesia.,https://www.ncbi.nlm.nih.gov/pubmed/30894071,Cognitive neuroscience,2019 04 23,"Cooper, Greve, and Henson (this issue) conclude that hippocampal-independent learning, as operationalised by 'fast mapping' (FM), is unlikely to facilitate learning in adults. We provide evidence from patients with Developmental Amnesia (DA), who acquire language and semantic knowledge despite early hippocampal pathology. We administered an FM paradigm to three patients with DA and controls. Patients showed no benefit of FM compared to explicit encoding. These data support the conclusion that FM is unlikely to facilitate learning in amnesia, regardless of age at onset. Hippocampal-independent learning may be possible in adults with DA, but such learning requires a prolonged consolidation period."

The decision for surgical fixation usually depends on the amount of displacement of the individual fractures. However, the optimal surgical approach or technique for open reduction and internal fixation has not been agreed upon. We present three original case reports and analyse them together with all other known cases in the English literature. We discuss how to avoid missing these combined fractures and propose a treatment algorithm based on the different permutations of the fracture displacement.

We examined gut microbiota composition and functions in patients with alcohol overconsumption for >10 years, compared to a control group of patients with a history of no or low alcohol intake. Faecal microbiota composition was assessed by 16S rRNA sequencing. Gut microbiota functions were evaluated by quantification of short-chain fatty acids (SCFAs) and predictive metagenome profiling (PICRUSt). Twenty-four patients, mean age 64.8 years (19 males), with alcohol overconsumption, and 18 control patients, mean age 58.2 years (14 males) were included. The two groups were comparable regarding basic clinical variables. Nutritional assessment revealed lower total score on the screening tool Mini Nutritional Assessment, lower muscle mass as assessed by handgrip strength, and lower plasma vitamin C levels in the alcohol overconsumption group. Bacteria from phylum Proteobacteria were found in higher relative abundance, while bacteria from genus Faecalibacterium were found in lower relative abundance in the group of alcohol overconsumers. The group also had higher levels of the genera Sutterella, Holdemania and Clostridium, and lower concentration and percentage of butyric acid. When applying PICRUSt to predict the metagenomic composition, we found that genes related to invasion of epithelial cells were more common in the group of alcohol overconsumers. We conclude that gut microbiota composition and functions in patients with alcohol overconsumption differ from patients with low consumption of alcohol, and seem to be skewed into a putative pro-inflammatory direction.",KLF2 (kruppel like factor 2 [lung]) regulates osteoclastogenesis by modulating autophagy.,https://www.ncbi.nlm.nih.gov/pubmed/30894058,Autophagy,2019 05 08,"Macroautophagy/autophagy is involved in myeloid cellular repair, destruction, and osteoclast differentiation; conversely, KLF2 (kruppel-like factor 2 [lung]) regulates myeloid cell activation and differentiation. To investigate the specific role of KLF2 in autophagy, osteoclastic differentiation was induced in monocytes in presence or absence of the autophagy inhibitor 3-methyladenine (3-MA), KLF2 inducer geranylgeranyl transferase inhibitor (GGTI298), and adenoviral overexpression of KLF2. We found that the number of autophagic cells and multinucleated osteoclasts were significantly decreased in presence of 3-MA, GGTI298, and KLF2 overexpressed cells indicating involvement of KLF2 in these processes. In addition, autophagy-related protein molecules were significantly decreased after induction of KLF2 during the course of osteoclastic differentiation. Furthermore, induction of arthritis in mice reduced the level of Klf2 in monocytes, and enhanced autophagy during osteoclastic differentiation. Mechanistically, knocking down of KLF2 increased the level of Beclin1 (BECN1) expression, and conversely, KLF2 over-expression reduced the level of BECN1 in monocytes. Moreover, 3-MA and GGTI298 both reduced myeloid cell proliferation concomitantly upregulating senescence-related molecules (CDKN1A/p21 and CDKN1B/p27kip1). We further confirmed epigenetic regulation of Becn1 by modulating Klf2; knocking down of Klf2 increased the levels of histone activation marks H3K9 and H4K8 acetylation in the promoter region of Becn1; and overexpression of Klf2 decreased the levels of H4K8 and H3K9 acetylation. In addition, osteoclastic differentiation also increased levels of H3K9 and H4K8 acetylation in the promoter region of Becn1. Together these findings for the first time revealed that Klf2 critically regulates Becn1-mediated autophagy process during osteoclastogenesis.

The purpose of this study was to evaluate the result of the transfer of an injured index finger for the traumatic loss of the thumb. A patient had a traumatic amputation at the first metacarpal level with the bone defect of the second metacarpal and proximal part of index finger. She was treated with a pedicled transfer of the injured index finger to the ipsilateral thumb. Postoperative evaluations included thumb range of motion, opposition and pinch function, grasp and pinch strength, sensation, and a patient-rated appearance of the thumb and hand. In result, the blood supply of the transferred traumatic index fingers was normal, and the transferred index fingers survived without complications. The range of motion of the first metacarpophalangeal joint and interphalangeal joint was almost the same as that of a normal thumb. The opposition and pinch function of the thumb was also normal. The patient is able to complete activities of daily living with the new thumb. Nevertheless, the sensation has not yet been completely restored. In conclusion, it is feasible to treat traumatic thumb amputation with the transfer of injured index finger.","Autophagy-dependent secretion: mechanism, factors secreted, and disease implications.",https://www.ncbi.nlm.nih.gov/pubmed/30894055,Autophagy,2019 04 15,"Although best understood as a degradative pathway, recent evidence demonstrates pronounced involvement of the macroautophagic/autophagic molecular machinery in cellular secretion. With either overexpression or inhibition of autophagy mediators, dramatic alterations in the cellular secretory profile occur. This affects secretion of a plethora of factors ranging from cytokines, to granule contents, and even viral particles. Encompassing a wide range of secreted factors, autophagy-dependent secretion is implicated in diseases ranging from cancer to neurodegeneration. With a growing body of evidence shedding light onto the molecular mediators, this review delineates the molecular machinery involved in selective targeting of the autophagosome for either degradation or secretion. In addition, we summarize the current understanding of factors and cargo secreted through this unconventional route, and describe the implications of this pathway in both health and disease.

We studied the mechanism whereby intestinal epithelial HMGB1 contributes to host defense, using cell culture, colonoids, conditional intestinal epithelial HMGB1-knockout mice with Salmonella-colitis, il10-/- mice, and human samples. We report that intestinal HMGB1 is an important contributor to host protection from inflammation and infection. We identified a physical interaction between HMGB1 and STAT3. Lacking intestinal epithelial HMGB1 led to redistribution of STAT3 and activation of STAT3 post bacterial infection. Indeed, Salmonella-infected HMGB1-deficient cells exhibited less macroautophagy/autophagy due to decreased expression of autophagy proteins and transcriptional repression by activated STAT3. Then, increased p-STAT3 and extranuclear STAT3 reduced autophagic responses and increased inflammation. STAT3 inhibition restored autophagic responses and reduced bacterial invasion in vitro and in vivo. Moreover, low level of HMGB1 was correlated with reduced nuclear STAT3 and enhanced p-STAT3 in inflamed intestine of il10-/- mice and inflammatory bowel disease (IBD) patients. We revealed that colonic epithelial HMGB1 was directly involved in the suppression of STAT3 activation and the protection of intestine from bacterial infection and injury.

Macroautophagy/autophagy is one of the important mechanisms for clearance of both intracellular and extracellular Aβ. Here, through screening, we identified alborixin, an ionophore, as a potent inducer of autophagy. We found that autophagy induced by alborixin substantially cleared Aβ in microglia and primary neuronal cells. Induction of autophagy was accompanied by up regulation of autophagy proteins BECN1/Beclin 1, ATG5, ATG7 and increased lysosomal activities. Autophagy induced by alborixin was associated with inhibition of the phosphoinositide 3-kinase (PI3K)-AKT pathway. A knock down of PTEN and consistent, constitutive activation of AKT inhibited alborixin-induced autophagy and consequent clearance of Aβ. Furthermore, clearance of Aβ by alborixin led to significant reduction of Aβ-mediated cytotoxicity in primary neurons and differentiated N2a cells.

Approximately, 20% of Medicare beneficiaries are readmitted within 30 days of discharge. Many strategies such as the hospital readmission reduction program have been proposed and implemented to reduce readmission rates. Prior research has shown that coordination of care could play a significant role in lowering readmissions. Although having a hospital-based skilled nursing facility (HBSNF) in a hospital could help in improving care for patients needing short-term skilled nursing or rehabilitation services, little is known about HBSNFs' association with hospitals' readmission rates. This study seeks to examine the association between HBSNFs and hospitals' readmission rates. Data sources included 2007-2012 American Hospital Association Annual Survey, Area Health Resources Files, the Centers for Medicare and Medicaid Services (CMS) Medicare cost reports, and CMS Hospital Compare. The dependent variables were 30-day risk-adjusted readmission rates for acute myocardial infarction (AMI), congestive heart failure, and pneumonia. The independent variable was the presence of HBSNF in a hospital (1 = yes, 0 = no). Control variables included organizational and market factors that could affect hospitals' readmission rates. Data were analyzed using generalized estimating equation (GEE) models with state and year fixed effects and standard errors corrected for clustering of hospitals over time. Propensity score weights were used to control for potential selection bias of hospitals having a skilled nursing facility (SNF). GEE models showed that the presence of HBSNFs was associated with lower readmission rates for AMI and pneumonia.

Nasalance was assessed in 62 individuals, aged 6-10 years (n = 20), 11-17 years (n = 20) and 18-35 years (n = 22), using a nasometer II model 6450 (KayPENTAX), during production of one sequence of nine oral words (pipa, bis, burro, tatu, pilha, cuca, gui, fila, luz) and of sequences of isolated syllables (e.g. pa, pa, pa, pa, pa, pa) composed of plosive, fricative, liquid and nasal consonants with high and low vowels. In order to validate the new nasalance stimuli, nasalance scores for traditional oral and nasal stimuli were also obtained. Differences were analyzed at a significance level of 0.01. Mean nasalance scores (±SD) during the production of the sequence of words were 18 ± 5% (children), 18 ± 7% (adolescents) and 21 ± 5% (adults). Differences between age groups were not significant. During the production of syllables, adults had the highest mean nasalance scores (except for syllable /mi/); significant differences between age groups were observed only for /pa/ ,/sa/ and /la/. Nasalance scores were significantly higher in oral and nasal syllables with high vowels than with low vowels, and in nasal syllables than in oral syllables with high and low vowels. The nasalance scores obtained for the sentences were comparable to previously established norms. In conclusion, the nasalance scores defined for Brazilian Portuguese speakers, in different stimuli, may be adopted as normative values for local and cross-language comparisons in the identification of hypernasality related to conditions such as cleft palate, neurogenic disorders and syndromes.",Sacubitril/valsartan effect on left ventricular remodeling: the case of a super-responder.,https://www.ncbi.nlm.nih.gov/pubmed/30894032,Current medical research and opinion,2019 05 07,"Sacubitril/valsartan has been shown to improve clinical outcomes in patients with heart failure and reduced ejection fraction (HFrEF), but its effects on left ventricular (LV) systolic function and reverse remodeling parameters remain to be established. We hereby describe the case of a 41 year old man with HFrEF and severe reduction of left ventricular ejection fraction (LVEF). The patient was first treated with triple HF therapy (beta-blocker, angiotensin converting enzyme inhibitor and mineralocorticoid antagonist), but after three months he was still symptomatic and with an LVEF firmly low. In consideration of poor response to therapy, we switched angiotensin converting enzyme inhibitor to sacubitril/valsartan to the maximum tolerated dose (49/51 mg bid) with a marked improvement in LV systolic function and reduction in LV volumes at follow-up. In light of the almost normalized LVEF the patient was also removed from the list for the implantation of a cardiac resynchronization therapy defibrillator. In conclusion, our case showed a strong beneficial effect of sacubitril/valsartan on reverse remodeling and LVEF beyond the benefits of concomitant optimal medical therapy. This result is particular noteworthy because it was obtained although the patient wasn't able to reach the full dose of the drug. Physicians should always consider this drug effect when more demanding therapeutic strategies are needed for their HF patients.",Name agreement and naming latencies for typed picture naming in aging adults.,https://www.ncbi.nlm.nih.gov/pubmed/30894031,Clinical linguistics & phonetics,2019 03 21,"This baseline study aimed to create a coherent set of images that can be used to describe language decline found in healthy elderly and to compare this to the language change found in the early stages of Alzheimer's disease. To this extend, a typed picture naming task was created, in which visual complexity, age-of-acquisition, frequency and name agreement were controlled for. 76 healthy elderly participated in the test; their data will be used in follow-up studies to compare with cognitively impaired patients. The entire typing process was logged with keystroke logging tools Inputlog and Scriptlog; the obtained results were analysed in light of the typing product (name agreement and object recognition) and the writing process (naming latencies and interkey latencies). Results showed that the latencies increased with age and that the older participants had longer latencies for images with a lower frequency and higher age-of-acquisition.

FAK and Pyk2 are also expressed in megakaryocytes and platelets and are activated by soluble agonists and on adhesion to the subendothelial matrix. Despite high sequence homology and similar molecular organization, FAK and Pyk2 play different roles in platelet function. Whereas FAK serves mostly as a traditional focal adhesion kinase activated downstream of integrins, Pyk2 coordinates multiple signals from different receptors. FAK, but not Pyk2, is involved in megakaryocyte maturation and platelet production. In circulating platelets, FAK is recruited by integrin αIIbβ3 to regulate hemostasis, whereas it plays minimal roles in thrombosis. By contrast, Pyk2 is implicated in platelet activation and is an important regulator of thrombosis. The direct activation of Pyk2 by calcium ions provides a connection between GPCRs (G-protein coupled receptors) and Src family kinases. In this review, we provide the comprehensive overview of >20 years of investigations on the role and regulation of focal adhesion kinases in blood platelets, highlighting common and distinctive features of FAK and Pyk2 in hemostasis and thrombosis.",Recombinant LCAT (Lecithin:Cholesterol Acyltransferase) Rescues Defective HDL (High-Density Lipoprotein)-Mediated Endothelial Protection in Acute Coronary Syndrome.,https://www.ncbi.nlm.nih.gov/pubmed/30894011,"Arteriosclerosis, thrombosis, and vascular biology",2019 04 24,"Objective- Aim of this study was to evaluate changes in LCAT (lecithin:cholesterol acyltransferase) concentration and activity in patients with an acute coronary syndrome, to investigate if these changes are related to the compromised capacity of HDL (high-density lipoprotein) to promote endothelial nitric oxide (NO) production, and to assess if rhLCAT (recombinant human LCAT) can rescue the defective vasoprotective HDL function. Approach and Results- Thirty ST-segment-elevation myocardial infarction (STEMI) patients were enrolled, and plasma was collected at hospital admission, 48 and 72 hours thereafter, at hospital discharge, and at 30-day follow-up. Plasma LCAT concentration and activity were measured and related to the capacity of HDL to promote NO production in cultured endothelial cells. In vitro studies were performed in which STEMI patients' plasma was added with rhLCAT and HDL vasoprotective activity assessed by measuring NO production in endothelial cells. The plasma concentration of the LCAT enzyme significantly decreases during STEMI with a parallel significant reduction in LCAT activity. HDL isolated from STEMI patients progressively lose the capacity to promote NO production by endothelial cells, and the reduction is related to decreased LCAT concentration. In vitro incubation of STEMI patients' plasma with rhLCAT restores HDL ability to promote endothelial NO production, possibly related to significant modification in HDL phospholipid classes. Conclusions- Impairment of cholesterol esterification may be a major factor in the HDL dysfunction observed during acute coronary syndrome. rhLCAT is able to restore HDL-mediated NO production in vitro, suggesting LCAT as potential therapeutic target for restoring HDL functionality in acute coronary syndrome.","Association between substance use and concurrent sexual relationships among urban slum dwellers in Nairobi, Kenya.",https://www.ncbi.nlm.nih.gov/pubmed/30894010,AIDS care,2019 03 21,"While the overall incidence and prevalence of HIV/AIDS are declining in Africa, substance use-related HIV/AIDS is on the rise. The main objectives of this study were to elicit the types of commonly used substances and to examine the association between substance use and concurrent sexual relationships among slum dwellers in Kenya. Freelisting elicitation techniques were used to identify the most commonly used substances using 53 key informants. This was followed by a self-administered, structured questionnaire using a convenience sample of 506 participants. Findings from our freelisting analysis produced 27 substances that were used in the community. Analysis of the survey data shows that participants who reported using substances in the past three months were more likely to be involved in concurrent sexual relationships than those who did not (86.2% vs. 74.0%; p = .002). In the multivariable model, the odds of ever having concurrent sexual relationships were higher among participants who used any substance in the past three months (aOR 2.46; 95% CI 1.37-4.42, p < .01).

Compared to standard radiotherapy techniques, SBRT allows, due to its precision, significantly higher doses to be applied to the target with less damage to surrounding healthy tissues. If dose constraints are not exceeded, the risk of damage to tissues and organs around the irradiated volume is reduced to minimum. The principle of SBRT is the application of ablative doses of radiation that cause necrosis of the irradiated tissue."

Migrant seasonal workers manually harvest apples throughout the U.S. using ladders and buckets due to the care required for prevention of bruises and other physical damage. The motions associated with hand harvest have potential to cause musculoskeletal disorders of the neck, shoulder, and back/trunk. A prototype harvest platform was developed, aimed at alleviating occupational injuries and increasing harvest productivity by replacing ladders for reaching high apples. This study evaluated the activities of three harvest methods, i.e., conventional harvest (using ladders and buckets), harvest platform (for high apples only), and combined method (conventional harvest for low and middle apples and harvest platform for high apples) using the Rapid Upper Limb Assessment (RULA) method performed by trained researchers. Postures/activities with RULA grand scores > 5 were categorized as awkward (causing occupational injuries); otherwise, they were considered comfortable (not leading to health issues). Experimental results demonstrated that awkward activities in conventional harvest were mainly related to the use of ladders. Activities with the harvest platform were comfortable due to the elimination of ladders and buckets. The combined method significantly decreased the workers' time spent in awkward postures (from 64% with conventional harvest to 30% with the combined method) by eliminating awkward activities and increased the overall harvest productivity by approximately 40%. Apple growers and workers are therefore suggested to use the combined method to replace conventional harvest.",Barriers and Motivators for Tractor ROPS Retrofitting in Iowa.,https://www.ncbi.nlm.nih.gov/pubmed/30893976,Journal of agricultural safety and health,2019 05 31,"Iowa State University Extension and Outreach conducted an assessment of Iowa farm operators' perceptions of the barriers and motivators when considering retrofitting tractors with rollover protective structures (ROPS).

In dromedary camels, the virus only causes a mild infection but it spreads efficiently between animals. Differences in the behavior of the virus observed between individuals, as well as between humans and dromedary camels, highlight the role of host factors in MERS-CoV pathogenesis and transmission. One of these host factors, the MERS-CoV receptor dipeptidyl peptidase-4 (DPP4), may be a critical determinant because it is variably expressed in MERS-CoV-susceptible species as well as in humans. This could partially explain inter- and intraspecies differences in the tropism, pathogenesis, and transmissibility of MERS-CoV.

First, a finite element (FE) model of the PZT interface mounted on a plate structure is established. The impedance responses of the PZT interface are numerically simulated under different damage locations inflicted in the plate domain. The impedance features are extracted from the impedance signatures to analyze the sensing distance and the damage detectability of the PZT interface. Next, the splice plate of a bolted connection is selected as a practical plate-like structure for the experimental examination of the PZT interface's sensing region on a limited plate domain. The damage sensitivity behavior of the PZT interface is analyzed with respect to the damage location on the splice plate. An FE analysis of the corresponding PZT interface-splice plate system is also conducted to support the experimental results.",Environmental Justice in Industrially Contaminated Sites. A Review of Scientific Evidence in the WHO European Region.,https://www.ncbi.nlm.nih.gov/pubmed/30893943,International journal of environmental research and public health,2019 05 06,"In the WHO European Region the topic of contaminated sites is considered a priority among environment and health themes. Communities living in or close to contaminated sites tend to be characterized by a high prevalence of ethnic minorities and by an unfavorable socioeconomic status so rising issues of environmental justice. A structured review was undertaken to describe the contents of original scientific studies analyzing distributive and procedural justice in industrially contaminated sites carried out in the WHO European Region in the period 2010⁻2017. A systematic search of the literature was performed. In total, 14 articles were identified. Wherever assessments on environmental inequalities were carried out, an overburden of socioeconomic deprivation or vulnerability, with very few exemptions, was observed. The combined effects of environmental and socioeconomic pressures on health were rarely addressed. Results show that the studies on environmental and health inequalities and mechanisms of their generation in areas affected by industrially contaminated sites in the WHO European Region are in their early stages, with exemption of UK. Future efforts should be directed to improve study strategies with national and local assessments in order to provide evidence for equity-oriented interventions to reduce environmental exposure and related health risks caused by industrial contamination.",The Study of Buckling and Post-Buckling of a Step-Variable FGM Box.,https://www.ncbi.nlm.nih.gov/pubmed/30893942,"Materials (Basel, Switzerland)",2019 04 28,"This work concerns the analysis of a thin-walled box made of ceramic and step-variable functionally graded material (FGM) subjected to compression. The components of the box taken into account were pure alumina and aluminium-alumina graded material. The problem was solved on the basis of a finite element method and Koiter's asymptotic theory using a semi-analytical method (SAM). It analysed both the buckling state and the post-buckling state of the box. In addition, three conditions were considered: The presence of alumina outside or inside of the box and a mixed case. The obtained results were presented and discussed.",A Study on Noise Reduction of Gear Pumps of Wheel Loaders Based on the ICA Model.,https://www.ncbi.nlm.nih.gov/pubmed/30893941,International journal of environmental research and public health,2019 05 06,"In order to reduce the noise level of wheel loaders caused by gear pumps and realize environmentally sustainable development, the noise generation mechanism of a gear pump was studied, and the influence of flow pulsation and gear impact on noise was analyzed. In order to reduce the interference of other noise sources on the noise level of the gear pump, a noise test rig was established. The mixed noise signals obtained from the rig test were separated using the ICA model. The ICA model includes the following algorithms: The fast Fourier transform (FFT), independent component analysis (ICA) and inverse fast Fourier transform (IFFT). Some theories about the influence of the teeth number and teeth profile on noise were analyzed by theory and simulation. A noise reduction strategy was proposed by increasing the teeth numbers and modifying the teeth profile of the gear pump. The tests results showed that the noise values of the external and the driver's ear of the wheel loader were reduced to 1 and 2.2 dB (A), respectively. This proves the effectiveness of the optimization scheme of gear pump noise reduction.",Development of a DNA Barcoding-Like Approach to Detect Mustard Allergens in Wheat Flours.,https://www.ncbi.nlm.nih.gov/pubmed/30893940,Genes,2019 04 28,"The spread of food allergens is a topic of global importance due to its impact on public health. National and International regulations ask food producers and manufacturers to declare product compositions on the label, especially in case of processed raw materials. Wheat flour (Triticum aestivum) can be contaminated by a wide range of species belonging to the Brassicaceae in the field or during grain harvests, storage, and processing. Among them, mustards (Brassica nigra, Brassica juncea and Sinapis alba) are well known allergenic species. Often, food quality laboratories adopt an ELISA approach to detect the presence of mustard species. However, this approach shows cross-reactivity with other non-allergenic species such as Brassica napus (rapeseed). In the last few years, DNA barcoding was proposed as a valid identification method, and it is now commonly used in the authentication of food products. This study aims to set up an easy and rapid DNA-based tool to detect mustard allergenic species. DNA barcoding (matK and ITS2) and chromosome markers (A6, B, C1 genome regions) were selected, and specific primers were validated on incurred reference food matrices. The developed test was proven to be able to distinguish mustard from rapeseed and wheat, overcoming cross-reactivity with Brassica napus.",Immunohistochemical Expression of Autophagy-Related Proteins in Advanced Tubular Gastric Adenocarcinomas and Its Implications.,https://www.ncbi.nlm.nih.gov/pubmed/30893939,Cancers,2019 04 26,"In neoplastic conditions, autophagy may act as a tumor suppressor avoiding the accumulation of damaged proteins and organelles or as a mechanism of cell survival promoting the tumor growth. Although ultrastructural analysis has been considered the traditional method to identify autophagy, some proteins such as microtubule-associated protein 1 light chain 3 (LC3A/B), Beclin-1 and activating molecule in Beclin-1-regulated autophagy protein-1 (AMBRA-1) may be considered as markers of autophagy-assisted cancerogenesis. Herein, we analyzed a cohort of advanced tubular gastric adenocarcinomas by the abovementioned immunohistochemical antisera; through immunohistochemistry, autophagy (A-IHC) is diagnosed when at least two out of the three proteins are positive in the samples. Immunostaining for LC3A/B, Beclin-1, and AMBRA-1 was exclusively found in neoplastic elements, but not in surrounding stromal cells. In detail, LC3A/B and Beclin 1 were expressed both in the cytoplasm and in the nucleus of the cancer cells, while AMBRA-1 was preferentially localized in the nucleus, mainly in high grade cases. LC3A/B, Beclin 1, and AMBRA-1 expression were positive in 18 (56.2%), 17 (53.1%), and 12 (37.5%) cases, respectively. The sensibility and specificity of LC3A/B and Beclin-1 ranged from 81.25% to 93.75%, with high efficiency (90.63%) for Beclin-1. Moreover, the ultrastructural autophagic index (AI) was also available in all cases. All high-grade cases documented a Ki-67 labelling index (LI) ≥ 30%, even if three low-grade cases revealed a high Ki-67 value; p53 positivity was encountered in 21/32 (65.62%) of cases, independently of the tumor grade. A statistically significant correlation among A-IHC and clinicopathological parameters such as grade, stage, clinical course, Ki-67 LI and AI was revealed. Univariate analysis documented a significant p-value for the same autophagic variables. Additionally, multivariate survival analysis identified the grade, AI and A-IHC as independent significant variables. Finally, the overall survival curves of all cases of gastric tubular adenocarcinoma were greatly dependent on A-IHC. Therefore, we suggest that autophagic-related proteins might be considered promising predictive prognostic factors of advanced gastric cancer. Further investigations may be required to determine whether new targeted therapies should be addressed to autophagy-related proteins.",Effect of Antifreeze Glycoproteins on Organoid Survival during and after Hypothermic Storage.,https://www.ncbi.nlm.nih.gov/pubmed/30893938,Biomolecules,2019 04 26,"We study the effect of antifreeze glycoproteins (AFGPs) on the survival of organoids under hypothermic conditions. We find that the survival of organoids in cold conditions depends on their developmental stage. Mature organoids die within 24 h when being stored at 4 °C, while cystic organoids can survive up to 48 h. We find that in the presence of AFGPs, the organoid survival is prolonged up to 72 h, irrespective of their developmental stage. Fluorescence microscopy experiments reveal that the AFGPs predominately localize at the cell surface and cover the cell membranes. Our findings support a mechanism in which the positive effect of AFGPs on cell survival during hypothermic storage involves the direct interaction of AFGPs with the cell membrane. Our research highlights organoids as an attractive multicellular model system for studying the action of AFGPs that bridges the gap between single-cell and whole-organ studies.",The Patchy Distribution of Restriction⁻Modification System Genes and the Conservation of Orphan Methyltransferases in Halobacteria.,https://www.ncbi.nlm.nih.gov/pubmed/30893937,Genes,2019 04 28,"Restriction⁻modification (RM) systems in bacteria are implicated in multiple biological roles ranging from defense against parasitic genetic elements, to selfish addiction cassettes, and barriers to gene transfer and lineage homogenization. In bacteria, DNA-methylation without cognate restriction also plays important roles in DNA replication, mismatch repair, protein expression, and in biasing DNA uptake. Little is known about archaeal RM systems and DNA methylation. To elucidate further understanding for the role of RM systems and DNA methylation in Archaea, we undertook a survey of the presence of RM system genes and related genes, including orphan DNA methylases, in the halophilic archaeal class Halobacteria. Our results reveal that some orphan DNA methyltransferase genes were highly conserved among lineages indicating an important functional constraint, whereas RM systems demonstrated patchy patterns of presence and absence. This irregular distribution is due to frequent horizontal gene transfer and gene loss, a finding suggesting that the evolution and life cycle of RM systems may be best described as that of a selfish genetic element. A putative target motif (CTAG) of one of the orphan methylases was underrepresented in all of the analyzed genomes, whereas another motif (GATC) was overrepresented in most of the haloarchaeal genomes, particularly in those that encoded the cognate orphan methylase."

We conducted a prospective study among 26 infants with congenital CMV infections from 2009 to 2018. Oral VGCV (32 mg/kg/day) was administered for 6 weeks (November 2009 to June 2015; n = 20) or 6 months (July 2015 to March 2018, n = 6). Hearing function was evaluated by measuring the auditory brainstem response before VGCV treatment and at 6 months. Hearing dysfunction, defined as a V-wave threshold >40 dB, was categorized into: most severe, ≥91 dB; severe, 61⁻90 dB; and moderate, 41⁻60 dB. Hearing improvement was defined as a decrease of ≥20 dB from the pretreatment V-wave threshold. Of 52 ears in 26 infants with congenital CMV infection, 29 (56%) had hearing dysfunction, and of 29 ears, 16 (55%) improved after VGCV treatment. Although, 16 (84%) of 19 ears with moderate or severe hearing dysfunction improved after treatment (p < 0.001), 10 ears with the most severe form did not. In conclusion, VGCV treatment is effective in improving moderate and severe hearing dysfunction in infants with congenital CMV infection.",Database of Shear Experiments on Steel Fiber Reinforced Concrete Beams without Stirrups.,https://www.ncbi.nlm.nih.gov/pubmed/30893925,"Materials (Basel, Switzerland)",2019 04 28,"Adding steel fibers to concrete improves the capacity in tension-driven failure modes. An example is the shear capacity in steel fiber reinforced concrete (SFRC) beams with longitudinal reinforcement and without shear reinforcement. Since no mechanical models exist that can fully describe the behavior of SFRC beams without shear reinforcement failing in shear, a number of empirical equations have been suggested in the past. This paper compiles the existing empirical equations and code provisions for the prediction of the shear capacity of SFRC beams failing in shear as well as a database of 488 experiments reported in the literature. The experimental shear capacities from the database are then compared to the prediction equations. This comparison shows a large scatter on the ratio of experimental to predicted values. The practice of defining the tensile strength of SFRC based on different experiments internationally makes the comparison difficult. For design purposes, the code prediction methods based on the Eurocode shear expression provide reasonable results (with coefficients of variation on the ratio tested/predicted shear capacities of 27⁻29%). None of the currently available methods properly describe the behavior of SFRC beams failing in shear. As such, this work shows the need for studies that address the different shear-carrying mechanisms in SFRC and its crack kinematics.",Measuring and Visualizing Solar UV for a Wide Range of Atmospheric Conditions on Hawai'i Island.,https://www.ncbi.nlm.nih.gov/pubmed/30893924,International journal of environmental research and public health,2019 05 06,": Hawai'i Island often receives extreme (UV Index ≥ 11) solar ultraviolet radiation (UVR). While the UV Index (UVI) has been measured since 1997 at Hawai'i's high-altitude Mauna Loa Observatory (MLO), measurements where people live and recreate are rare. We measured UVI on the face of a rotating mannequin head with UVR sensors at its eyes, ears and cheeks while simultaneously measuring the UVI with a zenith-facing sensor at MLO and seven sites at or near sea level from 19 July to 14 August 2018. The mannequin sensors received higher UVR at midmorning and midafternoon than at noon. For example, at sea level the peak UVI at the left cheek was 5.2 at midmorning and 2.9 at noon, while the horizontal UVI at noon was 12.7. Our measurements were supplemented with wide-angle (190° and 360°) sky photographs and UV images of the mannequin head. Because the UVI applies to horizontal surfaces, people in tropical and temperate latitudes should be informed that their face may be more vulnerable to UVR at midmorning and midafternoon than at noon. Finally, our instruments provided opportunities to measure unexpected UVR-altering events, including rare biomass smoke over MLO and spectroscopic measurements of substantial UVR-absorbing sulfur dioxide in the eruption plume of the Kilauea volcano.",Characterization and Function of Two Short Peptidoglycan Recognition Proteins Involved in the Immunity of Bactrocera dorsalis (Hendel).,https://www.ncbi.nlm.nih.gov/pubmed/30893923,Insects,2019 04 23,"Peptidoglycans (PGNs) are major bacterial components recognized by the immune systems of insects and mammals. PGN recognition proteins (PGRPs) are widely distributed and highly conserved in vertebrates and invertebrates. PGRPs are a family of pattern recognition receptors that recognize peptidoglycan and regulate immune responses. In this study, we cloned two PGRP genes (BdPGRP-SA and BdPGRP-SD) from Bactrocera dorsalis (Hendel), which encode 192 and 196 amino acid residues, respectively. Both genes were highly expressed in adults, especially in the fat body and midgut. These two genes were up-regulated when challenged by the immune triggers, PGN-EB (Escherichiacoli O111:B4) and PGN-SA (Staphylococcus aureus). The suppression of transcriptional expression of either gene by RNA interference (RNAi) resulted in increased sensitivities to Gram-negative E. coli and Gram-positive S. aureus PGNs. Suppression of BdPGRP-SA and -SD expression by RNAi resulted in weak expressions of four antimicrobial peptides (AMPs) upon injected with E. coli or S. aureus. BdPGRP-SA and -SD are involved in recognizing both Gram-negative and Gram-positive bacteria independently to activate the downstream AMP's response to bacterial infection.",Interleukin-3 Polymorphism is Associated with Miscarriage of Fresh in Vitro Fertilization Cycles.,https://www.ncbi.nlm.nih.gov/pubmed/30893922,International journal of environmental research and public health,2019 05 06,"The aim of this study was to examine the association between interleukin (IL) genes polymorphisms and in vitro fertilization (IVF) outcome. A prospective cohort analysis was performed at a Women's Hospital IVF centre of 1015 female patients undergoing fresh non-donor IVF cycles. The effects of the following six single nucleotide polymorphisms (SNPs) in five IL genes on IVF outcomes were explored: IL-1α (rs1800587 C/T), IL-3 (rs40401 C/T), IL-6 (rs1800795 C/G), IL-15 (rs3806798 A/T), IL-18 (rs187238 C/G) and IL-18 (rs1946518 G/T). The main outcome measures included clinical pregnancy, embryo implantation, abortion and live birth rates. There were no statistically significant differences in clinical pregnancy, embryo implantation and live birth rates in the analysis of 1015 patients attempting their first cycle of IVF. Infertile women with IL-3 homozygous major genotype had a higher abortion rate than those with heterozygous and homozygous minor genotype (16.5% vs. 7.9%, P = 0.025). In conclusion, our results indicated that the IL-3 rs40401 polymorphism is associated with increased risk of abortion of IVF patients. Future studies with inclusion of other ethnic populations must be conducted to confirm the findings of this study.",Structure-Specific Endonucleases and the Resolution of Chromosome Underreplication.,https://www.ncbi.nlm.nih.gov/pubmed/30893921,Genes,2019 04 28,"Complete genome duplication in every cell cycle is fundamental for genome stability and cell survival. However, chromosome replication is frequently challenged by obstacles that impede DNA replication fork (RF) progression, which subsequently causes replication stress (RS). Cells have evolved pathways of RF protection and restart that mitigate the consequences of RS and promote the completion of DNA synthesis prior to mitotic chromosome segregation. If there is entry into mitosis with underreplicated chromosomes, this results in sister-chromatid entanglements, chromosome breakage and rearrangements and aneuploidy in daughter cells. Here, we focus on the resolution of persistent replication intermediates by the structure-specific endonucleases (SSEs) MUS81, SLX1-SLX4 and GEN1. Their actions and a recently discovered pathway of mitotic DNA repair synthesis have emerged as important facilitators of replication completion and sister chromatid detachment in mitosis. As RS is induced by oncogene activation and is a common feature of cancer cells, any advances in our understanding of the molecular mechanisms related to chromosome underreplication have important biomedical implications.",Optimization of Polyaluminum Chloride-Chitosan Flocculant for Treating Pig Biogas Slurry Using the Box⁻Behnken Response Surface Method.,https://www.ncbi.nlm.nih.gov/pubmed/30893920,International journal of environmental research and public health,2019 05 06,"Flocculation can remove large amounts of nitrogen and phosphorus from wastewater, and the resulting nitrogen- and phosphorus-rich floc can be used to produce organic fertilizer. For biogas slurries containing high levels of nitrogen and phosphorus, ordinary flocculants can no longer meet the flocculation requirements. In this study, to fully utilize the advantages of the two flocculants and achieve efficient removal rates of nitrogen and phosphorus from a biogas slurry, chitosan (CTS) and polyaluminum chloride (PAC) were used as a composite flocculation agent to flocculate pig biogas slurries. The response surface method was used to study the effect of PAC added (PACadded) to the composite flocculant (CF), composite flocculant added (CFadded) to the biogas slurry and the pH on flocculation performance, and optimize these three parameters. In the tests, when the PACadded was 6.79 g·100 mL-1CF, the CFadded was 20.05 mL·L-1 biogas slurry and the pH was 7.50, the flocculation performance was the best, with an absorbance of 0.132 at a wavelength of 420 nm. The total phosphorus (TP) concentration was reduced from 214.10 mg·L-1 to 1.38 mg·L-1 for a removal rate of 99.4%. The total ammonia nitrogen (TAN) concentration was reduced from 1568.25 mg·L-1 to 150.27 mg·L-1 for a removal rate of 90.4%. The results showed that the CF could form larger flocs, and had greater adsorption capacity and more stable flocculation performance than ordinary flocculants. Furthermore, the CF could exhibit better chelation, electrical neutralization and bridge adsorption.","Bidirectional, Bimodal Ultrasonic Lamb Wave Sensing in a Composite Plate Using a Polarization-Maintaining Fiber Bragg Grating.",https://www.ncbi.nlm.nih.gov/pubmed/30893919,"Sensors (Basel, Switzerland)",2019 04 28,"Lamb wave (LW) is well suited for structural health monitoring (SHM) in advanced composites. However, characteristic differences between the symmetric modes and the anti-symmetric modes often add complexity to SHM systems. The anisotropic nature of composite materials, on the other hand, necessitates direction-sensitive sensing. In this paper we report the experimental demonstration of bidirectional (0° and 90°), bimodal (S0 and A0) LW measurement within the frequency range of 20⁻140 kHz using a polarization-maintaining fiber Bragg grating (PM-FBG) sensor attached to a composite laminated plate. By selectively interrogating the fast and/or the slow axis of the PM-FBG, we show that not only can the sensor respond to LWs propagating along both directions, but the response can also be used to differentiate the two directions. Moreover, the fast axis of the sensor is able to respond to both the S0 and the A0 modes when the sensor is aligned with the wave propagation direction, whereas single S0 mode response can be achieved with the slow axis operating perpendicularly to the wave propagation direction. Such diverse responses indicate the potential of PM-FBGs as versatile multi-parameter SHM detectors, which can effectively address the challenges posed by material anisotropicity and LW mode diversity.",Recent Studies on DNA Adducts Resulting from Human Exposure to Tobacco Smoke.,https://www.ncbi.nlm.nih.gov/pubmed/30893918,Toxics,2019 04 23,"DNA adducts are believed to play a central role in the induction of cancer in cigarette smokers and are proposed as being potential biomarkers of cancer risk.

A variety of DNA adducts derived from various classes of carcinogens, including aromatic amines, polycyclic aromatic hydrocarbons, tobacco-specific nitrosamines, alkylating agents, aldehydes, volatile carcinogens, as well as oxidative damage have been reported. The results are discussed with particular attention to the analytical methods used in those studies. Mass spectrometry-based methods that have higher selectivity and specificity compared to 32P-postlabeling or immunochemical approaches are preferred. Multiple DNA adducts specific to tobacco constituents have also been characterized for the first time in vitro or detected in vivo since 2012, and descriptions of those adducts are included. We also discuss common issues related to measuring DNA adducts in humans, including the development and validation of analytical methods and prevention of artifact formation.",Knowledge of Stakeholders in the Livestock Industries of East and Southeast Asia about Welfare during Transport and Slaughter and Its Relation to Their Attitudes to Improving Animal Welfare.,https://www.ncbi.nlm.nih.gov/pubmed/30893917,Animals : an open access journal from MDPI,2019 04 19,"The World Organisation for Animal Health (OIE) sets standards and guidelines for international animal welfare for the international livestock trade. The growing economic advancement in the East and Southeast Asian region suggested the potential benefit of a research study to examine stakeholders' understanding of animal welfare during the transport and slaughter of livestock. A survey of stakeholders' knowledge of livestock welfare in the transport and slaughter industries was conducted in four Southeast Asian countries, Malaysia, China, Vietnam and Thailand, in association with trainer and stakeholder workshops conducted in each country. The attitudes of participants towards animal welfare during slaughter and transport were also identified. Knowledge scores were in accordance with the respondents' assessment of their own knowledge level. The biggest knowledge improvement was among Thai respondents, who tended to be younger and less experienced than in other countries. The respondents with the biggest improvement in knowledge scores were most likely to be involved in the dairy industry and least likely to be involved in the sheep and goat industries, with meat processors and those involved in pig or poultry production intermediate. The respondents who obtained their knowledge from multiple sources had most knowledge, but it increased the least after training. Connections between attitudes to improving animal welfare and knowledge were limited, being mainly confined to ambivalent responses about their attitudes. The study suggests that knowledge can be improved in animal welfare training programs focused on livestock welfare around transport and slaughter, but that local cultural backgrounds must be considered in designing the program."

This type of perception must be made with little information, very often based solely on facial cues. Although people are capable of accurately predicting others' preferences from facial cues, we do not yet know how such inferences are made by crossmodal correspondence (arbitrary sensory associations) between facial cues and inferred attributes. The crossmodal correspondence literature implies the existence of sensory associations between shapes and tastes, and people consistently match roundness and angularity to sweet and sour foods, respectively. Given that peoples' faces have dimensions characterized by roundness and angularity, it may be plausible that people infer others' preferences by relying on the correspondence between facial roundness and taste. Based on a crossmodal correspondence framework, this study aimed to reveal the role of shape⁻taste correspondences in social perception. We investigated whether Japanese participants infer others' taste (sweet/sour) preferences based on facial shapes (roundness/angularity). The results showed that participants reliably inferred that round-faced (vs. angular-faced) individuals preferred sweet foods (Study 1). Round-faced individuals and sweet foods were well matched, and the matching mediated the inference of other person's preferences (Study 2). An association between facial roundness and inference of sweet taste preferences was observed in more natural faces, and perceived obesity mediated this association (Study 3). These findings advance the applicability of crossmodal correspondences in social perception, and imply the pervasiveness of prejudicial bias in the marketplace.",Influence of Tea Consumption on the Development of Second Esophageal Neoplasm in Patients with Head and Neck Cancer.,https://www.ncbi.nlm.nih.gov/pubmed/30893904,Cancers,2019 04 26,"Alcohol is an important risk factor for the development of second esophageal squamous-cell carcinoma (ESCC) in head and neck squamous-cell carcinoma (HNSCC) patients. However, the influence of tea consumption is uncertain. We prospectively performed endoscopic screening in incident HNSCC patients to identify synchronous esophageal neoplasm. In total, 987 patients enrolled between October 2008 and December 2017 and were analyzed. In vitro studies were conducted to investigate the effect of epigallocatechin gallate (EGCG) on the betel alkaloid, arecoline-stimulated carcinogenesis in two ESCC cell lines. There were 151 patients (15.3%) diagnosed to have synchronous esophageal neoplasm, including 88 low-grade dysplasia, 30 high-grade dysplasia and 33 squamous-cell carcinoma (SCC). Tea consumption was associated with a significantly lower risk of having esophageal high-grade dysplasia or SCC in HNSCC patients, especially those who were betel nut chewers, alcohol drinkers or cigarette smokers (all adjusted odds ratio were 0.5; p-values: 0.045, 0.045 and 0.049 respectively). In vitro studies indicated that EGCG suppressed arecoline-induced ESCC cell proliferation and colony formation through the inhibition of the Akt and ERK1/2 pathway in a reactive oxygen species-independent manner. In conclusion, tea consumption may protect against the development of second esophageal neoplasms among HNSCC patients, especially those who regularly consume betel nuts, alcohol and cigarettes.",Cholic Acid-Conjugated Methylcellulose-Polyethylenimine Nano-Aggregates for Drug Delivery Systems.,https://www.ncbi.nlm.nih.gov/pubmed/30893903,"Nanomaterials (Basel, Switzerland)",2019 05 05,"Cholic acid-conjugated methylcellulose-polyethylenimines (MCPEI-CAs) were synthesized and characterized for drug delivery systems.

It was found that MCPEI-CAs could form positively charged (>30 mV Zeta-potential) and spherical nano-aggregates (~250 nm Z-average size) by hydrophobic interaction of CA moieties. Critical aggregation concentration of MCPEI-CA10 was measured as 7.2 × 10-3 mg/mL. MCPEI-CA10 could encapsulate the anticancer drug doxorubicin (Dox) with 58.0% of drug loading content and 23.2% of drug loading efficiency and its release was facilitated in acidic condition. Cytotoxicity of MCPEI-CAs was increased with the increase of cholic acid (CA) graft degrees, probably due to the cellular membrane disruption by interaction with specific molecular structure of amphiphilic MCPEI-CA nano-aggregates. MCPEI-CA10/Dox nano-aggregates showed concentration-dependent anticancer activity, which could overcome the multidrug resistance of cancer cells. In this work, molecular conformation change of MC derivatives by chemical modification and a potential of MCPEI-CA10/Dox nano-aggregates for drug delivery systems were revealed.",Perceived Needs of The Family Caregivers of People with Dementia in a Mediterranean Setting: A Qualitative Study.,https://www.ncbi.nlm.nih.gov/pubmed/30893902,International journal of environmental research and public health,2019 05 06,"The purpose of this study was to identify, classify and analyze the perceived needs of caregivers of elderly people with dementia during the care process. A descriptive phenomenological qualitative study using seven focus groups was conducted in different primary health care centers in the province of Jaén (Spain) between July 2012 and February 2013. Eighty-two family caregivers who were caring for people with dementia in different stages of the disease were selected by purposeful maximum variation sampling. Data were analyzed and organized thematically, considering the semantic and pragmatic content and field notes. Two main categories of the perceived needs of caregivers were identified. The first was related to the management of caring for a relative with dementia, and the second was related to the management of the caregivers' own care. Our findings support the provision of comprehensive interventions for the improvement of caregivers' emotional health that encompass more than one care need. This is where psycho-educational interventions aimed at managing the various aspects of dementia and self-care in caregivers can be accommodated. In addition, proactive interventions to develop important skills to care for a relative with dementia, which are not perceived as needs by the caregivers, are needed. These include skills in family negotiation, planning and searching for resources outside the family.",Advantages of the Application of the Temper Bead Welding Technique During Wet Welding.,https://www.ncbi.nlm.nih.gov/pubmed/30893901,"Materials (Basel, Switzerland)",2019 04 28,"Thermo-mechanically rolled S460ML steel was chosen for welding in underwater wet welding conditions by covered electrodes. The main aim of this study was to check the weldability for fillet welds in a water environment by controlled thermal severity (CTS) tests and to check the influence of temper bead welding (TBW) on the weldability of the investigated steel. Non-destructive and destructive tests showed that S460ML steel has a high susceptibility to cold cracking. In all joints, hardness in the heat-affected zone (HAZ) was extended to the 400 HV10 values. Microscopic testing showed the presence of microcracks in the HAZ of all welded joints. TBW was chosen as the method to improve the weldability of the investigated steel. This technique allows for the reduction of the maximum hardness in the HAZ below the critical value of 380 HV10, as stated by the EN-ISO 15614-1:2017. It was determined that for S460ML steel, from the point of view of weldability, the pitch between two beads should be in the range 75%⁻100%. Also, if the pitch between two beads increases, the hardness, grain size, and number of cracks decreases. In all specimens where the hardness of the HAZ was below 380 HV10, there were no microcracks.",Oxidation Resistance and Microstructure Evaluation of a Polymer Derived Ceramic (PDC) Composite Coating Applied onto Sintered Steel.,https://www.ncbi.nlm.nih.gov/pubmed/30893900,"Materials (Basel, Switzerland)",2019 04 28,"Powder metallurgy is a competitive technology to produce ferrous near net shape parts for diverse engineering applications. However, their inherent porosity increases the susceptibility to oxidation and sealing their surface is mandatory to avoid premature degradation. Alongside, polymer derived ceramics (PDCs), such as silicon-carbonitride, have drawn attention concerning their high temperature and chemical stability. However, PDCs undergo volume shrinkage during ceramization that leads to defect formation. The shrinkage can be compensated by the addition of fillers, which are also capable of tailoring the ceramic resulting properties. This work evaluates the processing of PDC-based coatings loaded with ZrO₂ and glass fillers to compensate for the shrinkage, densify the coating and seal the sintered steel surface. Therefore, polymeric slurries were sprayed onto sintered steel substrates, which were pyrolyzed at different temperatures for microstructural and oxidation resistance evaluation. Microstructural modifications caused by the enhanced glass viscous flow during pyrolysis at 800 °C resulted in more homogeneous, dense and protective coatings, which reduced the mass gain up to 40 wt% after 100 h of oxidation at 450 °C in air in comparison to the uncoated substrate. Moreover, no macrocracks or spallation were detected, confirming the feasibility of PDC composite barrier coatings for sintered steels.",Overview of the Manufacturing Methods of Solid Dispersion Technology for Improving the Solubility of Poorly Water-Soluble Drugs and Application to Anticancer Drugs.,https://www.ncbi.nlm.nih.gov/pubmed/30893899,Pharmaceutics,2019 04 28,"Approximately 40% of new chemical entities (NCEs), including anticancer drugs, have been reported as poorly water-soluble compounds. Anticancer drugs are classified into biologic drugs (monoclonal antibodies) and small molecule drugs (nonbiologic anticancer drugs) based on effectiveness and safety profile. Biologic drugs are administered by intravenous (IV) injection due to their large molecular weight, while small molecule drugs are preferentially administered by gastrointestinal route. Even though IV injection is the fastest route of administration and ensures complete bioavailability, this route of administration causes patient inconvenience to visit a hospital for anticancer treatments. In addition, IV administration can cause several side effects such as severe hypersensitivity, myelosuppression, neutropenia, and neurotoxicity. Oral administration is the preferred route for drug delivery due to several advantages such as low cost, pain avoidance, and safety. The main problem of NCEs is a limited aqueous solubility, resulting in poor absorption and low bioavailability. Therefore, improving oral bioavailability of poorly water-soluble drugs is a great challenge in the development of pharmaceutical dosage forms. Several methods such as solid dispersion, complexation, lipid-based systems, micronization, nanonization, and co-crystals were developed to improve the solubility of hydrophobic drugs. Recently, solid dispersion is one of the most widely used and successful techniques in formulation development. This review mainly discusses classification, methods for preparation of solid dispersions, and use of solid dispersion for improving solubility of poorly soluble anticancer drugs.",Development and Characterization of a Pilot-Scale Model Cocoa Fermentation System Suitable for Studying the Impact of Fermentation on Putative Bioactive Compounds and Bioactivity of Cocoa.,https://www.ncbi.nlm.nih.gov/pubmed/30893898,"Foods (Basel, Switzerland)",2019 04 17,"Cocoa is a concentrated source of dietary flavanols-putative bioactive compounds associated with health benefits. It is known that fermentation and roasting reduce levels of native flavonoids in cocoa, and it is generally thought that this loss translates to reduced bioactivity. However, the mechanisms of these losses are poorly understood, and little data exist to support this paradigm that flavonoid loss results in reduced health benefits. To further facilitate large-scale studies of the impact of fermentation on cocoa flavanols, a controlled laboratory fermentation model system was increased in scale to a large (pilot) scale system. Raw cocoa beans (15 kg) were fermented in 16 L of a simulated pulp media in duplicate for 168 h. The temperature of the fermentation was increased from 25⁻55 °C at a rate of 5 °C/24 h. As expected, total polyphenols and flavanol levels decreased as fermentation progressed (a loss of 18.3% total polyphenols and 14.4% loss of total flavanols during fermentation) but some increases were observed in the final timepoints (120⁻168 h). Fermentation substrates, metabolites and putative cocoa bioactive compounds were monitored and found to follow typical trends for on-farm cocoa heap fermentations. For example, sucrose levels in pulp declined from >40 mg/mL to undetectable at 96 h. This model system provides a controlled environment for further investigation into the potential for optimizing fermentation parameters to enhance the flavanol composition and the potential health benefits of the resultant cocoa beans.","Nutritional Regulation of Gene Expression: Carbohydrate-, Fat- and Amino Acid-Dependent Modulation of Transcriptional Activity.",https://www.ncbi.nlm.nih.gov/pubmed/30893897,International journal of molecular sciences,2019 04 28,"The ability to detect changes in nutrient levels and generate an adequate response to these changes is essential for the proper functioning of living organisms. Adaptation to the high degree of variability in nutrient intake requires precise control of metabolic pathways. Mammals have developed different mechanisms to detect the abundance of nutrients such as sugars, lipids and amino acids and provide an integrated response. These mechanisms include the control of gene expression (from transcription to translation). This review reports the main molecular mechanisms that connect nutrients' levels, gene expression and metabolism in health. The manuscript is focused on sugars' signaling through the carbohydrate-responsive element binding protein (ChREBP), the role of peroxisome proliferator-activated receptors (PPARs) in the response to fat and GCN2/activating transcription factor 4 (ATF4) and mTORC1 pathways that sense amino acid concentrations. Frequently, alterations in these pathways underlie the onset of several metabolic pathologies such as obesity, insulin resistance, type 2 diabetes, cardiovascular diseases or cancer. In this context, the complete understanding of these mechanisms may improve our knowledge of metabolic diseases and may offer new therapeutic approaches based on nutritional interventions and individual genetic makeup.",Radiosensitivity of Cancer Cells Is Regulated by Translationally Controlled Tumor Protein.,https://www.ncbi.nlm.nih.gov/pubmed/30893896,Cancers,2019 04 26,"Translationally controlled tumor protein (TCTP) is a ubiquitous multifunctional protein that is essential for cell survival. This study reveals that the regulation of radiosensitivity of cancer cells is yet another function of TCTP. The relationship between endogenous TCTP levels and sensitivity to radiation was examined in breast cancer cell lines (T47D, MDA-MB-231, and MCF7) and lung cancer cells lines (A549, H1299, and H460). Cancer cells with high expression levels of TCTP were more resistant to radiation. TCTP overexpression inhibited radiation-induced cell death, while silencing TCTP led to an increase in radiosensitivity. DNA damage in the irradiated TCTP-silenced A549 cells was greater than in irradiated control shRNA-transfected A549 cells. p53, a well-known reciprocal regulator of TCTP, was increased in irradiated TCTP down-regulated A549 cells. Moreover, introduction of p53 siRNA in TCTP knocked-down A549 cells abrogated the increased radiosensitivity induced by TCTP knockdown. An in vivo xenograft study also confirmed enhanced radiosensitivity in TCTP down-regulated A549 cells. These findings suggest that TCTP has the potential to serve as a therapeutic target to overcome radiation resistance in cancer, a major problem for the effective treatment of cancers."

The Center for Disease Control and Prevention has issued guidelines reminding healthcare workers about the importance of taking steps to prevent the spread of Zika virus, how to test and isolate patients suspected of carrying the Zika virus, and how to protect themselves from infection. Therefore, it is of utmost importance for healthcare professionals to be fully aware of Zika virus preparedness, and response measures should an outbreak occur in Malaysia in order to quickly and efficiently contain the outbreak, ensure the safety of individual or healthcare personnel safety, as well as to prevent further spreading of the disease. This research aims to show how prepared Malaysian healthcare professionals are against Zika virus and how well can they respond during an outbreak. In total, 504 healthcare professionals (128 general practitioners, 215 community pharmacists, 161 nurses) from private health clinics were the target population of the four states of Malaysia where Zika cases suspected. The sample size of each category was calculated by using a formula for estimating the population proportion. An additional 10% of the calculated sample size was added to compensate the non-response rate. The Center For Disease Control and Prevention and World Health Organisation provided a checklist to assess how prepared healthcare professionals are for an Zika outbreak. This checklist was modified to a questionnaire in order to assess health care professionals' preparedness and response to the Zika outbreak. Community pharmacists are still lacking in their preparedness and perceived response to the Zika outbreak compared to the general practitioners in the private sector. Hence community pharmacists should attend training given by the Ministry of Health Malaysia as a continuing education, which may help them to respond during a Zika outbreak.","Weight Perception, Weight Control Intentions, and Dietary Intakes among Adolescents Ages 10⁻15 Years in the United States.",https://www.ncbi.nlm.nih.gov/pubmed/30893884,International journal of environmental research and public health,2019 05 06,To examine associations of adolescents' weight status perception and weight control intentions with dietary intakes.,Light-Induced Control of the Spin Distribution on Cu⁻Dithiolene Complexes: A Correlated Ab Initio Study.,https://www.ncbi.nlm.nih.gov/pubmed/30893883,"Molecules (Basel, Switzerland)",2019 04 28,"Metal dithiolene complexes-M(dmit)₂-are key building blocks for magnetic, conducting, and optical molecular materials, with singular electronic structures resulting from the mixing of the metal and dmit ligand orbitals. Their use in the design of magnetic and conducting materials is linked to the control of the unpaired electrons and their localized/delocalized nature. It has been recently found that UV⁻Vis light can control the spin distribution of some [Cu(dmit)₂]-2 salts in a direct and reversible way. In this work, we study the optical response of these salts and the origin of the differences observed in the EPR spectra under UV⁻Vis irradiation by means of wave function-based quantum chemistry methods. The low-lying states of the complex have been characterized and the electronic transitions with a non-negligible oscillator strength have been identified. The population of the corresponding excited states promoted by the UV⁻Vis absorption produces significant changes in the spin distribution, and could explain the changes observed in the system upon illumination. The interaction between neighbor [Cu(dmit)₂]-2 complexes is weakly ferromagnetic, consistent with the relative orientation of the magnetic orbitals and the crystal packing, but in disagreement with previous assignments. Our results put in evidence the complex electronic structure of the [Cu(dmit)₂]-2 radical and the relevance of a multideterminantal approach for an adequate analysis of their properties.",BACE-1 and γ-Secretase as Therapeutic Targets for Alzheimer's Disease.,https://www.ncbi.nlm.nih.gov/pubmed/30893882,"Pharmaceuticals (Basel, Switzerland)",2019 04 26,"Alzheimer's disease (AD) is a growing global health concern with a massive impact on affected individuals and society. Despite the considerable advances achieved in the understanding of AD pathogenesis, researchers have not been successful in fully identifying the mechanisms involved in disease progression. The amyloid hypothesis, currently the prevalent theory for AD, defends the deposition of β-amyloid protein (Aβ) aggregates as the trigger of a series of events leading to neuronal dysfunction and dementia. Hence, several research and development (R&amp;D) programs have been led by the pharmaceutical industry in an effort to discover effective and safety anti-amyloid agents as disease modifying agents for AD. Among 19 drug candidates identified in the AD pipeline, nine have their mechanism of action centered in the activity of β or γ-secretase proteases, covering almost 50% of the identified agents. These drug candidates must fulfill the general rigid prerequisites for a drug aimed for central nervous system (CNS) penetration and selectivity toward different aspartyl proteases. This review presents the classes of γ-secretase and beta-site APP cleaving enzyme 1 (BACE-1) inhibitors under development, highlighting their structure-activity relationship, among other physical-chemistry aspects important for the successful development of new anti-AD pharmacological agents.",Physical Stability and Viscoelastic Properties of Co-Amorphous Ezetimibe/Simvastatin System.,https://www.ncbi.nlm.nih.gov/pubmed/30893881,"Pharmaceuticals (Basel, Switzerland)",2019 04 26,"The purpose of this paper is to examine the physical stability as well as viscoelastic properties of the binary amorphous ezetimibe⁻simvastatin system. According to our knowledge, this is the first time that such an amorphous composition is prepared and investigated. The tendency toward re-crystallization of the amorphous ezetimibe⁻simvastatin system, at both standard storage and elevated temperature conditions, have been studied by means of X-ray diffraction (XRD). Our investigations have revealed that simvastatin remarkably improves the physical stability of ezetimibe, despite the fact that it works as a plasticizer. Pure amorphous ezetimibe, when stored at room temperature, begins to re-crystallize after 14 days after amorphization. On the other hand, the ezetimibe-simvastatin binary mixture (at the same storage conditions) is physically stable for at least 1 year. However, the devitrification of the binary amorphous composition was observed at elevated temperature conditions (T = 373 K). Therefore, we used a third compound to hinder the re-crystallization. Finally, both the physical stability as well as viscoelastic properties of the ternary systems containing different concentrations of the latter component have been thoroughly investigated.",Antibiotic Resistance in Pacific Island Countries and Territories: A Systematic Scoping Review.,https://www.ncbi.nlm.nih.gov/pubmed/30893880,"Antibiotics (Basel, Switzerland)",2019 04 19,"Several studies have investigated antimicrobial resistance in low- and middle-income countries, but to date little attention has been paid to the Pacific Islands Countries and Territories (PICTs). This study aims to review the literature on antibiotic resistance (ABR) in healthcare settings in PICTs to inform further research and future policy development for the region. Following the PRISMA-ScR checklist health databases and grey literature sources were searched. Three reviewers independently screened the literature for inclusion, data was extracted using a charting tool and the results were described and synthesised. Sixty-five studies about ABR in PICTs were identified and these are primarily about New Caledonia, Fiji and Papua New Guinea. Ten PICTs contributed the remaining 21 studies and nine PICTs were not represented. The predominant gram-positive pathogen reported was community-acquired methicillin resistant S. aureus and the rates of resistance ranged widely (>50% to <20%). Resistance reported in gram-negative pathogens was mainly associated with healthcare-associated infections (HCAIs). Extended spectrum beta-lactamase (ESBL) producing K. pneumoniae isolates were reported in New Caledonia (3.4%) and Fiji (22%) and carbapenem resistant A. baumannii (CR-ab) isolates in the French Territories (24.8%). ABR is a problem in the PICTs, but the epidemiology requires further characterisation. Action on strengthening surveillance in PICTs needs to be prioritised so strategies to contain ABR can be fully realised.","Evaluation of Black Soldier Fly (Hermetia illucens) Larvae and Pre-Pupae Raised on Household Organic Waste, as Potential Ingredients for Poultry Feed.",https://www.ncbi.nlm.nih.gov/pubmed/30893879,Animals : an open access journal from MDPI,2019 04 19,"Black soldier fly (BSF) larvae and pre-pupae could be satisfactorily raised on household organic waste and used as poultry feed, offering a potential sustainable way to recycle untapped resources of waste. The present study was conducted to determine if whole (non-defatted) BSF larvae and pre-pupae raised on experimental household waste could substitute soybean meal and oil as ingredients for laying hen diets. While no significant differences in feed intake and the egg-laying rate of hens were observed throughout the experiment, egg weight and eggshell thickness were greater in the pre-pupae-fed group than in the other groups. Moreover, although diversity of the cecal microbiota was significantly higher in the pre-pupae-fed than in the control group, no significant differences in bacterial genera known to cause food poisoning were observed when comparing the treatment groups. Nonetheless, Lactobacillus and Bifidobacterium populations were significantly lower in the treatment than in the control group. Fat content in BSF was possibly related with the changes in the cecal microbiota. Hence, since BSF fat was deficient in essential fatty acids, special attention should be paid to the fat content and its fatty acid composition in the case of regular inclusion of BSF larvae and pre-pupae oil as an ingredient in poultry diets.",Versatile Multi-Functional Block Copolymers Made by Atom Transfer Radical Polymerization and Post-Synthetic Modification: Switching from Volatile Organic Compound Sensors to Polymeric Surfactants for Water Rheology Control via Hydrolysis.,https://www.ncbi.nlm.nih.gov/pubmed/30893878,"Nanomaterials (Basel, Switzerland)",2019 05 05,"Novel, multipurpose terpolymers based on styrene (PS), tert-butyl methacrylate (tBMA) and glycidyl methacrylate (GMA), have been synthesized via Atom Transfer Radical Polymerization (ATRP).

To improve the photoactivity of TiO₂, vanadium-doped TiO₂ (VTiO₂) samples were obtained starting from different amount of vanadyl sulphate as a dopant source. The samples were centrifuged, washed and finally dried at room temperature, and no calcination step was carried out. The prepared photocatalysts were characterized by different techniques (X-ray powder diffraction (XRD), specific surface area (SSA), ultraviolet-visible diffuse reflectance spectra (UV-vis DRS) and Raman). VTiO₂ photocatalysts were tested in the photocatalytic removal of aqueous solutions containing caffeine. The photocatalytic tests were carried out in a recirculating batch cylindrical photoreactor irradiated by a UV LEDs strip (nominal power of 12 W and wavelength emission peak at about 365 nm) surrounding the external surface of the reactor. The optimized VTiO₂ photocatalyst was able to reach a caffeine degradation of about 96% after 360 min of UV light irradiation with a total organic carbon (TOC) removal of 72%.",Perilipin 5 and Lipocalin 2 Expression in Hepatocellular Carcinoma.,https://www.ncbi.nlm.nih.gov/pubmed/30893876,Cancers,2019 04 24,"Hepatocellular carcinoma (HCC) is one of the most prevalent and deadly cancers worldwide. Therefore, current global research focuses on molecular tools for early diagnosis of HCC, which can lead to effective treatment at an early stage. Perilipin 5 (PLIN5) has been studied as one of the main proteins of the perilipin family, whose role is to maintain lipid homeostasis by inhibiting lipolysis. In this study, we show for the first time that PLIN5 is strongly expressed in tumors of human patients with HCC as well as in mouse livers, in which HCC was genetically or experimentally induced by treatment with the genotoxic agent diethylnitrosamine. Moreover, the secreted acute phase glycoprotein Lipocalin 2 (LCN2) established as a biomarker of acute kidney injury, is also proven to indicate liver injury with upregulated expression in numerous cases of hepatic damage, including steatohepatitis. LCN2 has been studied in various cancers, and it has been assigned roles in multiple cellular processes such as the suppression of the invasion of HCC cells and their metastatic abilities. The presence of this protein in blood and urine, in combination with the presence of α -Fetoprotein (AFP), is hypothesized to serve as a biomarker of early stages of HCC. In the current study, we show in humans and mice that LCN2 is secreted into the serum from liver cancer tissue. We also show that AFP-positive hepatocytes represent the main source for the massive expression of LCN2 in tumoral tissue. Thus, the strong presence of PLIN5 and LCN2 in HCC and understanding their roles could establish them as markers for diagnosis or as treatment targets against HCC."

The antioxidant properties were evaluated by DPPH, TEAC, FRAP and lipoperoxidation inhibition in erythrocytes methods, and the antibacterial activity was evaluated according to the Clinical and Laboratory Standards Institute (CLSI) guidelines. The BLD showed a moderate free radical scavenging activity in the DPPH (EC50 = 106 µg/mL) and lipid peroxidation in erythrocytes assays (67%, at 250 µg/mL). However, the BLD had the highest gastroprotective effect at a dose of 750 mg/kg with a ninety-three percent inhibition of damage through a mechanism that involve NO and prostaglandins using the ethanol-induced gastric damage in a standard rat model. On the other hand, BLD does not induce cytotoxic changes on human tumor and no-tumor cell lines at the concentrations assayed. Regarding the metabolomic analysis, thirty-one compounds were detected and 30 identified based on UHPLC-OT-MS including twelve flavonoids, eleven cinnamic acid derivatives, one coumarin, one stilbene and two other different phenolic compounds.

In this study, the hygiene status of beef carcasses sampled in eight Brazilian slaughterhouses was assessed by enumeration of different hygiene indicator microorganisms, and a model to establish potential associations among these counts was proposed. The carcasses (n = 464) were surface sampled at four slaughtering steps (step 1: Hide after bleeding; step 2: Carcass after hide removal; step 3: Carcass after evisceration; step 4: Carcass after end washing) and subjected to a counting of mesophilic aerobes (MA), Enterobacteriaceae (EB), total coliforms (TC), and Escherichia coli (EC) using Petrifilm™ plates. Among the sampled beef carcasses (step 4), 32 (6.9%) and 71 (15.3%) presented counts above the microbiological criteria established by (EC) No. 1441/2007 for MA and EB, respectively. Thus, indicating that improvements in slaughter hygiene and a review of process controls are demanded in some of the studied slaughterhouses. The log count differences of EC, TC, and EB from MA were considered as response variables as a function of the slaughtering steps. Differential log counts changed consistently with the steps. The measurements, including the patterns in their inherently random variability, were fairly predictable from steps 1 and 4. The results indicated that differential log counts for TC and EC are not relevant, as their concentrations and random pattern can be inferred from counts of MA and EB. The proposed model can be used as a valuable tool for the design and adoption of feasible quality control programs in beef industries.

Although MOM phenomena have been reported in different areas, the characteristics of different reservoirs are greatly different, and few comprehensive studies have been published regarding MOM in Chinese drinking water source reservoirs. The DO distribution along water depth was determined and the detailed reasons were clarified by two-years of field monitoring. In addition the effect of water lifting aerators (WLAs) on DO improvement was investigated in the Lijiahe Reservoir in Northwest China. A typical S-type DO distribution with two anaerobic water layers, below the epilimnion (10⁻25 m water depth) and above the sediment (bottom water), was observed derived from the decomposition of dead algae or organic matter and the restriction of DO vertical exchange. Moreover, after WLAs' operation since 10 June 2018, the water body was completely mixed and DO was rich and uniform along water depth by eliminating the water stratification and inhibiting algae growth. The deep understanding of the DO distribution in a deep canyon-shaped reservoir and the technical support for reservoir restoration are meaningful for optimizing reservoir management.","Identifying Areas with Disproportionate Local Health Department Services Relative to Opioid Overdose, HIV and Hepatitis C Diagnosis Rates: A Study of Rural Illinois.",https://www.ncbi.nlm.nih.gov/pubmed/30893862,International journal of environmental research and public health,2019 06 10,"Background: U.S. rural populations have been disproportionately affected by the syndemic of opioid-use disorder (OUD) and the associated increase in overdoses and risk of hepatitis C virus (HCV) and human immunodeficiency virus (HIV) transmission. Local health departments (LHDs) can play a critical role in the response to this syndemic. We utilized two geospatial approaches to identify areas of discordance between LHD service availability and disease burden to inform service prioritization in rural settings. Methods: We surveyed rural Illinois LHDs to assess their OUD-related services, and calculated county-level opioid overdose, HIV, and hepatitis C diagnosis rates. Bivariate choropleth maps were created to display LHD service provision relative to disease burden in rural Illinois counties. Results: Most rural LHDs provided limited OUD-related services, although many LHDs provided HIV and HCV testing. Bivariate mapping showed rural counties with limited OUD treatment and HIV services and with corresponding higher outcome/disease rates to be dispersed throughout Illinois. Additionally, rural counties with limited LHD-offered hepatitis C services and high hepatitis C diagnosis rates were geographically concentrated in southern Illinois. Conclusions: Bivariate mapping can enable geographic targeting of resources to address the opioid crisis and related infectious disease by identifying areas with low LHD services relative to high disease burden.",Relay Positions Considering Interference from Other Sub-Channels in OFDMA-Based D2D Group-Casting Systems.,https://www.ncbi.nlm.nih.gov/pubmed/30893861,"Sensors (Basel, Switzerland)",2019 04 27,"Device-to-device (D2D) communication is a technique for direct communication between devices without going through a base station or other infrastructure. D2D communication technology has the advantages of improving spectrum efficiency and reducing transmission delay and transmission power. In D2D communication systems, orthogonal frequency-division multiple access (OFDMA) is widely used to maintain similarities with cellular communication systems and to secure transmission distance. OFDMA allows flexible and efficient use of frequency resources by allocating sub-channels independent to each user. In this paper, we consider a D2D overlay system that uses different sub-channels for cellular and D2D communications. In theory, the signals on different sub-channels of an OFDMA system are orthogonal and not interfered with each other. However, in a D2D communication system, which operates in a distributed manner, there is non-negligible interference from other sub-channels because of in-band emissions. In this paper, we address the performance degradation resulting from the interference from other sub-channels for OFDMA-based D2D group-casting systems. We consider three different scenarios of D2D relay, and we find the relay position that minimizes the outage probability. The simulation and analytical results show that the optimal location of a relay can be considerably different according to the source location and the target scenario.",Protease Activity Profiling of Snake Venoms Using High-Throughput Peptide Screening.,https://www.ncbi.nlm.nih.gov/pubmed/30893860,Toxins,2019 04 23,"Snake venom metalloproteinases (SVMPs) and snake venom serine proteinases (SVSPs) are among the most abundant enzymes in many snake venoms, particularly among viperids. These proteinases are responsible for some of the clinical manifestations classically seen in viperid envenomings, including hemorrhage, necrosis, and coagulopathies. The objective of this study was to investigate the enzymatic activities of these proteins using a high-throughput peptide library to screen for the proteinase targets of the venoms of five viperid (Echis carinatus, Bothrops asper, Daboia russelii, Bitis arietans, Bitis gabonica) and one elapid (Naja nigricollis) species of high medical importance. The proteinase activities of these venoms were each tested against 360 peptide substrates, yielding 2160 activity profiles. A nonlinear regression model that accurately described the observed enzymatic activities was fitted to the experimental data, allowing for the comparison of cleavage rates across species. In this study, previously unknown protein targets of snake venom proteinases were identified, potentially implicating novel human and animal proteins that may be involved in the pathophysiology of viper envenomings. The functional relevance of these targets was further evaluated and discussed. These new findings may contribute to our understanding of the clinical manifestations and underlying biochemical mechanisms of snakebite envenoming by viperid species.",The Self-Assembly Phenomenon of Poloxamers and Its Effect on the Dissolution of a Poorly Soluble Drug from Solid Dispersions Obtained by Solvent Methods.,https://www.ncbi.nlm.nih.gov/pubmed/30893859,Pharmaceutics,2019 04 28,"The self-assembly phenomenon of amphiphiles has attracted particular attention in recent years due to its wide range of applications. The formation of nanoassemblies able to solubilize sparingly water-soluble drugs was found to be a strategy to solve the problem of poor solubility of active pharmaceutical ingredients. Binary and ternary solid dispersions containing Biopharmaceutics Classification System (BCS) class II drug bicalutamide and either Poloxamer®188 or Poloxamer®407 as the surface active agents were obtained by either spray drying or solvent evaporation under reduced pressure. Both processes led to morphological changes and a reduction of particle size, as confirmed by scanning electron microscopy and laser diffraction measurements. The increase in powder wettability was confirmed by means of contact angle measurements. The effect of an alteration of the crystal structure was followed by powder X-ray diffractometry while thermal properties were determined using differential scanning calorimetry. Interestingly, bicalutamide exhibited a polymorph transition after spray drying with the poloxamer and polyvinylpyrrolidone (PVP), while the poloxamer underwent partial amorphization. Moreover, due to the surface activity of the carrier, the solid dispersions formed nanoaggregates in water, as confirmed using dynamic light scattering measurements. The aggregates measuring 200⁻300 nm in diameter were able to solubilize bicalutamide inside the hydrophobic inner parts. The self-assembly of binary systems was found to improve the amount of dissolved bicalutamide by 4- to 8-fold in comparison to untreated drug. The improvement in drug dissolution was correlated with the solubilization of poorly soluble molecules by macromolecules, as assessed using emission spectroscopy.","A Novel Orthohepadnavirus Identified in a Dead Maxwell's Duiker (Philantomba maxwellii) in Taï National Park, Côte d'Ivoire.",https://www.ncbi.nlm.nih.gov/pubmed/30893858,Viruses,2019 04 19,"New technologies enable viral discovery in a diversity of hosts, providing insights into viral evolution. We used one such approach, the virome capture sequencing for vertebrate viruses (VirCapSeq-VERT) platform, on 21 samples originating from six dead Maxwell's duikers (Philantomba maxwellii) from Taï National Park, Côte d'Ivoire. We detected the presence of an orthohepadnavirus in one animal and characterized its 3128 bp genome. The highest viral copy numbers were detected in the spleen, followed by the lung, blood, and liver, with the lowest copy numbers in the kidney and heart; the virus was not detected in the jejunum. Viral copy numbers in the blood were in the range known from humans with active chronic infections leading to liver histolytic damage, suggesting this virus could be pathogenic in duikers, though many orthohepadnaviruses appear to be apathogenic in other hosts, precluding a formal test of this hypothesis. The virus was not detected in 29 other dead duiker samples from the Côte d'Ivoire and Central African Republic, suggesting either a spillover event or a low prevalence in these populations. Phylogenetic analysis placed the virus as a divergent member of the mammalian clade of orthohepadnaviruses, though its relationship to other orthohepadnaviruses remains uncertain. This represents the first orthohepadnavirus described in an artiodactyl. We have tentatively named this new member of the genus Orthohepadnavirus (family Hepadnaviridae), Taï Forest hepadnavirus. Further studies are needed to determine whether it, or some close relatives, are present in a broader range of artiodactyls, including livestock.","Correlation of BRAF Variant V595E, Breed, Histological Grade and Cyclooxygenase-2 Expression in Canine Transitional Cell Carcinomas.",https://www.ncbi.nlm.nih.gov/pubmed/30893857,Veterinary sciences,2019 04 21,"The presence of BRAF variant V595E, as well as an increased cyclooxygenase-2 (COX-2) expression in canine transitional cell carcinoma (TCC) are well-described in the literature. The aim of the present study was to investigate the correlation between breed (terrier versus non-terrier dogs), histological grade, COX-2 expression, and BRAF mutation in canine TCC. Therefore, transmural TCC biopsies from 65 dogs (15 terriers, 50 non-terriers) were graded histologically into low- and high-grade. Immunohistochemical evaluation of the intensity of COX-2 expression was performed using an immunoreactive score (IRS). Exon 15 of chromosome 16 was examined for the BRAF variant c.1799T>A by TaqMan® SNP assay. TCC was low-grade in 20 cases (one terrier, 19 non-terriers) and high-grade in 45 cases (14 terriers, 31 non-terriers). Contrary to humans, histological grade was not significantly correlated to the intensity of COX-2 expression. BRAF mutation was detected in 11/15 (73%) TCC of terriers and in 18/50 (36%) TCC of non-terriers. Histological grade and BRAF mutation were not correlated significantly (p = 0.2912). Terriers had a considerably higher prevalence of high-grade tumors (p < 0.0001), as well as of BRAF mutation (p ≤ 0.05) compared to non-terriers. In non-terriers, neoplasms with BRAF mutation showed a significantly higher intensity of COX-2 expression than those without BRAF mutation (p ≤ 0.05). In conclusion, in contrast to humans, testing for BRAF mutation in canine TCC is a sensitive diagnostic method especially in terriers (73%) and may be recommended as a screening test. However, evidence of BRAF mutation in canine TCC is not a predictor for the histological grade. Moreover, a positive correlation between histological grade and the intensity of COX-2 expression was not found. Further studies are necessary to clarify the clinical and prognostic relevance of the elevated intensity of COX-2 expression of TCC with BRAF mutation detected in non-terriers.",Neutrophil Cell Shape Change: Mechanism and Signalling during Cell Spreading and Phagocytosis.,https://www.ncbi.nlm.nih.gov/pubmed/30893856,International journal of molecular sciences,2019 04 28,"Perhaps the most important feature of neutrophils is their ability to rapidly change shape. In the bloodstream, the neutrophils circulate as almost spherical cells, with the ability to deform in order to pass along narrower capillaries. Upon receiving the signal to extravasate, they are able to transform their morphology and flatten onto the endothelium surface. This transition, from a spherical to a flattened morphology, is the first key step which neutrophils undergo before moving out of the blood and into the extravascular tissue space. Once they have migrated through tissues towards sites of infection, neutrophils carry out their primary role-killing infecting microbes by performing phagocytosis and producing toxic reactive oxygen species within the microbe-containing phagosome. Phagocytosis involves the second key morphology change that neutrophils undergo, with the formation of pseudopodia which capture the microbe within an internal vesicle. Both the spherical to flattened stage and the phagocytic capture stage are rapid, each being completed within 100 s. Knowing how these rapid cell shape changes occur in neutrophils is thus fundamental to understanding neutrophil behaviour. This article will discuss advances in our current knowledge of this process, and also identify an important regulated molecular event which may represent an important target for anti-inflammatory therapy."

Traditional (chemical) methods have been restricted to ensure public health and to limit the occurrence of resistant strains. Bacteriophages could be a sustainable alternative. A major hurdle towards the commercial implementation of phage-based biocontrol strategies concerns aspects of regulation and intellectual property protection. Within this study, two datasets have been composed to analyze both scientific publications and patent documents and to get an idea on the focus of research and development (R&D) by means of an abstract and claim analysis. A total of 137 papers and 49 patent families were found from searching public databases, with their numbers increasing over time. Within this dataset, the majority of the patent documents were filed by non-profit organizations in Asia. There seems to be a good correlation between the papers and patent documents in terms of targeted bacterial genera. Furthermore, granted patents seem to claim rather broad and cover methods of treatment. This review shows that there is indeed growing publishing and patenting activity concerning phage biocontrol. Targeted research is needed to further stimulate the exploration of phages within integrated pest management strategies and to deal with bacterial infections in crop production.",Integration and Exploitation of Sensor Data in Smart Cities through Event-Driven Applications.,https://www.ncbi.nlm.nih.gov/pubmed/30893843,"Sensors (Basel, Switzerland)",2019 04 28,"Smart cities are urban environments where Internet of Things (IoT) devices provide a continuous source of data about urban phenomena such as traffic and air pollution. The exploitation of the spatial properties of data enables situation and context awareness. However, the integration and analysis of data from IoT sensing devices remain a crucial challenge for the development of IoT applications in smart cities. Existing approaches provide no or limited ability to perform spatial data analysis, even when spatial information plays a significant role in decision making across many disciplines. This work proposes a generic approach to enabling spatiotemporal capabilities in information services for smart cities. We adopted a multidisciplinary approach to achieving data integration and real-time processing, and developed a reference architecture for the development of event-driven applications. This type of applications seamlessly integrates IoT sensing devices, complex event processing, and spatiotemporal analytics through a processing workflow for the detection of geographic events. Through the implementation and testing of a system prototype, built upon an existing sensor network, we demonstrated the feasibility, performance, and scalability of event-driven applications to achieve real-time processing capabilities and detect geographic events.",The Digital Pharmacies Era: How 3D Printing Technology Using Fused Deposition Modeling Can Become a Reality.,https://www.ncbi.nlm.nih.gov/pubmed/30893842,Pharmaceutics,2019 04 28,"The pharmaceutical industry is set to join the fourth industrial revolution with the 3D printing of medicines. The application of 3D printers in compounding pharmacies will turn them into digital pharmacies, wrapping up the telemedicine care cycle and definitively modifying the pharmacotherapeutic treatment of patients. Fused deposition modeling 3D printing technology melts extruded drug-loaded filaments into any dosage form; and allows the obtainment of flexible dosages with different shapes, multiple active pharmaceutical ingredients and modulated drug release kinetics-in other words, offering customized medicine. This work aimed to present an update on this technology, discussing its challenges. The co-participation of the pharmaceutical industry and compounding pharmacies seems to be the best way to turn this technology into reality. The pharmaceutical industry can produce drug-loaded filaments on a large scale with the necessary quality and safety guarantees; while digital pharmacies can transform the filaments into personalized medicine according to specific prescriptions. For this to occur, adaptations in commercial 3D printers will need to meet health requirements for drug products preparation, and it will be necessary to make advances in regulatory gaps and discussions on patent protection. Thus, despite the conservatism of the sector, 3D drug printing has the potential to become the biggest technological leap ever seen in the pharmaceutical segment, and according to the most optimistic prognostics, it will soon be within reach.","Increased Hunger, Food Cravings, Food Reward, and Portion Size Selection after Sleep Curtailment in Women Without Obesity.",https://www.ncbi.nlm.nih.gov/pubmed/30893841,Nutrients,2019 04 26,"This study examined the effects of one night of sleep curtailment on hunger, food cravings, food reward, and portion size selection. Women who reported habitually sleeping 7⁻9 h per night, were aged 18⁻55, were not obese, and had no sleep disorders were recruited. Sleep conditions in this randomized crossover study consisted of a normal night (NN) and a curtailed night (CN) where time in bed was reduced by 33%. Hunger, tiredness, sleep quality, sleepiness, and food cravings were measured. A progressive ratio task using chocolates assessed the food reward. Participants selected portions of various foods that reflected how much they wanted to eat at that time. The sleep duration was measured using a single-channel electroencephalograph. Twenty-four participants completed the study. The total sleep time was shorter during the CN (p < 0.001). Participants reported increased hunger (p = 0.013), tiredness (p < 0.001), sleepiness (p < 0.001), and food cravings (p = 0.002) after the CN. More chocolate was consumed after the CN (p = 0.004). Larger portion sizes selected after the CN resulted in increased energy plated for lunch (p = 0.034). In conclusion, the present study observed increased hunger, food cravings, food reward, and portion sizes of food after a night of modest sleep curtailment. These maladaptive responses could lead to higher energy intake and, ultimately, weight gain.",Influence of Root System Characteristics on Black Spruce Seedling Responses to Limiting Conditions.,https://www.ncbi.nlm.nih.gov/pubmed/30893840,"Plants (Basel, Switzerland)",2019 04 30,"Roots directly affect planted seedling adaptation to new growing conditions at reforestation sites. To test the influence of root characteristics on the short-term response of seedlings to limiting resources (water, nutrient, or oxygen), we conducted two experiments. We compared (1) the growth and physiology of three types of four-year-old black spruce (Picea mariana (Mill.) BSP) seedlings (Containerized, highly developed initial roots restricted to a plug; bareroot, less developed but unrestricted initial roots; deeply-planted containerized, restricted initial and adventitious roots) to different combinations of irrigation and fertilization. We also investigated (2) the cellular plasticity of adventitious and initial roots to three irrigation regimes including flooding. Bareroot seedlings had better relative growth rates in height than containerized seedlings, probably due to their larger initial size. On the other hand, containerized seedlings took better advantage of fertilization, as shown by a higher relative growth rate in diameter compared to bareroot seedlings and were less affected by water limitation, possibly due to the root plug acting as an additional water reserve capacity. For containerized seedlings, the presence of adventitious roots was beneficial to height growth and physiological performances compared to seedlings with initial roots only. Adventitious roots showed great cell plasticity, particularly under flooding conditions.",Methods and Challenges of Using the Greater Wax Moth (Galleria mellonella) as a Model Organism in Antimicrobial Compound Discovery.,https://www.ncbi.nlm.nih.gov/pubmed/30893839,Microorganisms,2019 04 23,"Among non-mammalian infection model organisms, the larvae of the greater wax moth Galleria mellonella have seen increasing popularity in recent years. Unlike other invertebrate models, these larvae can be incubated at 37 °C and can be dosed relatively precisely. Despite the increasing number of publications describing the use of this model organism, there is a high variability with regard to how the model is produced in different laboratories, with respect to larva size, age, origin, storage, and rest periods, as well as dosing for infection and treatment. Here, we provide suggestions regarding how some of these factors can be approached, to facilitate the comparability of studies between different laboratories. We introduce a linear regression curve correlating the total larva weight to the liquid volume in order to estimate the in vivo concentration of pathogens and the administered drug concentration. Finally, we discuss several other aspects, including in vivo antibiotic stability in larvae, the infection doses for different pathogens and suggest guidelines for larvae selection.","Binary Oxides Prepared by Microwave-Assisted Solution Combustion: Synthesis, Characterization and Catalytic Activity.",https://www.ncbi.nlm.nih.gov/pubmed/30893838,"Materials (Basel, Switzerland)",2019 04 28,"Three different alumina-based Ni, Cu, Co oxide catalysts with metal loading of 10 wt %, and labeled 10Ni⁻Al, 10Co⁻Al and 10Cu⁻Al, were prepared by microwave-assisted solution combustion.

Finally, the three materials were tested in CO oxidation used as test reaction for comparing their catalytic performance. The 10Cu⁻Al catalyst was constituted of copper oxide phase, while the 10Ni⁻Al and 10Co⁻Al catalysts showed the presence of ""spinels"" phases on the surface. The well-crystallized copper oxide phase in the 10Cu⁻Al catalyst, obtained by microwave synthesis, allowed for obtaining very high catalytic activity.

However, this standard UKF shows unstable performance whenever the noise covariance mismatches. Furthermore, in consideration of the deficiencies of the current adaptive UKF algorithm, this paper proposes a new adaptive UKF scheme for the time-varying noise covariance problems. First of all, the cross-correlation between the innovation and residual sequences is given and proven. On this basis, a linear matrix equation deduced from the innovation and residual sequences is applied to resolve the process noise covariance in real time. Using the redundant measurements, an improved measurement-based adaptive Kalman filtering algorithm is applied to estimate the measurement noise covariance, which is entirely immune to the state estimation. The results of the simulation indicate that under the condition of time-varying noise covariances, the proposed adaptive UKF outperforms the standard UKF and the current adaptive UKF algorithm, hence improving tracking accuracy and stability.",Functional Interaction among KCa and TRP Channels for Cardiovascular Physiology: Modern Perspectives on Aging and Chronic Disease.,https://www.ncbi.nlm.nih.gov/pubmed/30893836,International journal of molecular sciences,2019 06 10,"Effective delivery of oxygen and essential nutrients to vital organs and tissues throughout the body requires adequate blood flow supplied through resistance vessels. The intimate relationship between intracellular calcium ([Ca2+]i) and regulation of membrane potential (Vm) is indispensable for maintaining blood flow regulation. In particular, Ca2+-activated K⁺ (KCa) channels were ascertained as transducers of elevated [Ca2+]i signals into hyperpolarization of Vm as a pathway for decreasing vascular resistance, thereby enhancing blood flow. Recent evidence also supports the reverse role for KCa channels, in which they facilitate Ca2+ influx into the cell interior through open non-selective cation (e.g., transient receptor potential; TRP) channels in accord with robust electrical (hyperpolarization) and concentration (~20,000-fold) transmembrane gradients for Ca2+. Such an arrangement supports a feed-forward activation of Vm hyperpolarization while potentially boosting production of nitric oxide. Furthermore, in vascular types expressing TRP channels but deficient in functional KCa channels (e.g., collecting lymphatic endothelium), there are profound alterations such as downstream depolarizing ionic fluxes and the absence of dynamic hyperpolarizing events. Altogether, this review is a refined set of evidence-based perspectives focused on the role of the endothelial KCa and TRP channels throughout multiple experimental animal models and vascular types. We discuss the diverse interactions among KCa and TRP channels to integrate Ca2+, oxidative, and electrical signaling in the context of cardiovascular physiology and pathology.

Using real-time monitoring of PM2.5 data in 338 Chinese cities during 2014⁻2017, this study employed multi-temporal and multi-spatial scale statistical analysis to reveal the temporal and spatial characteristics of PM2.5 patterns and a spatial econometric model to quantify the socio-economic driving factors of PM2.5 concentration changes. The results are as follows: (1) The annual average value of PM2.5 concentration decreased year by year and the monthly average showed a U-shaped curve from January to December. The daily mean value of PM2.5 concentration had the characteristics of pulse-type fluctuation and the hourly variation presented a bimodal curve. (2) During 2014⁻2017, the overall PM2.5 pollution reduced significantly, but that of more than two-thirds of cities still exceeded the standard value (35 μg/m³) regulated by Chinese government. PM2.5 pollution patterns showed high values in central and eastern Chinese cities and low values in peripheral areas, with the distinction evident along the same line that delineates China's uneven population distribution. (3) Population agglomeration, industrial development, foreign investment, transportation, and pollution emissions contributed to the increase of PM2.5 concentration. Urban population density contributed most significantly while economic development and technological progress reduced PM2.5 concentration. The results also suggest that China in general remains a ""pollution shelter"" for foreign-funded enterprises."

FcRn expression was studied in an air⁻liquid interface (ALI) primary culture model of human nasal epithelial cells (HNEC) from polyps. FcRn expression was characterized by quantitative RT-PCR, western blot, and immunolabeling. The ability of HNECs to support mAb transcytosis via FcRn was assessed by transcytosis assay. This study demonstrates the expression of FcRn mRNA and protein in HNEC. We report a high expression of FcRn in the cytosol of ciliated, mucus, and basal cells by immunohistochemistry with a higher level of FcRn proteins in differentiated HNEC. We also proved in vitro transepithelial delivery of an IgG1 therapeutic mAb with a dose⁻response curve.

A similar potentiation of clotting was demonstrated for MSC-derived extracellular vesicles (EVs). To offer approaches to avoid unwanted effects, we studied the impact of a heparin supplement on MSC procoagulative properties. However, MSCs still retained procoagulant activity toward blood from children receiving a therapeutic dose of unfractionated heparin. An analysis of the mechanisms responsible for the procoagulant effect of MSCs/EVs revealed the presence of tissue factor and other proteins involved in coagulation-associated pathways. Also, we found that some MSCs and EVs were positive for annexin V, which implies the presence of phosphatidylserine on their surfaces, which can potentiate clot formation. Thus, we revealed procoagulant activity of MSCs/EVs associated with the presence of phosphatidylserine and tissue factor, which requires further analysis to avoid adverse effects of MSC therapy in patients with a risk of thrombosis.","Intracellular Water Content in Lean Mass is Associated with Muscle Strength, Functional Capacity, and Frailty in Community-Dwelling Elderly Individuals. A Cross-Sectional Study.",https://www.ncbi.nlm.nih.gov/pubmed/30893821,Nutrients,2019 04 26,"High intracellular water (ICW) content has been associated with better functional performance and a lower frailty risk in elderly people. However, it is not clear if the protective effect of high ICW is due to greater muscle mass or better muscle quality and cell hydration. We aimed to assess the relationship between ICW content in lean mass (LM) and muscle strength, functional performance, frailty, and other clinical characteristics in elderly people. In an observational cross-sectional study of community-dwelling subjects aged ≥75 years, ICW and LM were estimated by bioelectrical impedance, and the ICW/LM ratio (mL/kg) calculated. Muscle strength was measured as hand grip, frailty status was assessed according to Fried criteria, and functional status was assessed by Barthel score. For 324 recruited subjects (mean age 80 years), mean (SD) ICW/LM ratio was 408 (29.3) mL/kg. The ICW/LM ratio was negatively correlated with age (rs = -0.249; p < 0.001). A higher ICW/LM ratio was associated with greater muscle strength, better functional capacity, and a lower frailty risk, even when adjusted by age, sex, nº of co-morbidities, and LM. ICW content in LM (including the muscle) may influence muscle strength, functional capacity and frailty. However, further studies are needed to confirm this hypothesis.","Synthesis, In Vitro Antimicrobial and Cytotoxic Activities of Some New Pyrazolo[1,5-a]pyrimidine Derivatives.",https://www.ncbi.nlm.nih.gov/pubmed/30893820,"Molecules (Basel, Switzerland)",2019 04 28,"A new series of pyrazole 4⁻7 and pyrazolo[1,5-a]pyrimidine 8⁻13 were synthesized by using a simple, efficient procedure, and screened for their in-vitro antimicrobial and antitumor activities. Symmetrical and asymmetrical 3,6-diarylazo-2,5,7-triaminopyrazolo[1,5-a]pyrimidine were synthesized by the conventional method and also subjected to microwave irradiation and under ultrasound conditions. The biological results revealed that most of the tested compounds proved to be active as antibacterial and antifungal agents. The antitumor activity of the synthesized compounds was evaluated against human cancer cell lines, MCF-7, HCT-116, and HepG-2, as compared with Doxorubicin as a control.",Measurement of the Chair Rise Performance of Older People Based on Force Plates and IMUs.,https://www.ncbi.nlm.nih.gov/pubmed/30893819,"Sensors (Basel, Switzerland)",2019 04 28,"An early detection of functional decline with age is important to start interventions at an early state and to prolong the functional fitness. In order to assure such an early detection, functional assessments must be conducted on a frequent and regular basis. Since the five time chair rise test (5CRT) is a well-established test in the geriatric field, this test should be supported by technology. We introduce an approach that automatically detects the execution of the chair rise test via an inertial sensor integrated into a belt. The system's suitability was evaluated via 20 subjects aged 72⁻89 years (78.2 ± 4.6 years) and was measured by a stopwatch, the inertial measurement unit (IMU), a Kinect® camera and a force plate. A Multilayer Perceptrons-based classifier detects transitions in the IMU data with an F1-Score of around 94.8%. Valid executions of the 5CRT are detected based on the correct occurrence of sequential movements via a rule-based model. The results of the automatically calculated test durations are in good agreement with the stopwatch measurements (correlation coefficient r = 0.93 (p < 0.001)). The analysis of the duration of single test cycles indicates a beginning fatigue at the end of the test. The comparison of the movement pattern within one person shows similar movement patterns, which differ only slightly in form and duration, whereby different subjects indicate variations regarding their performance strategies.","Nanocomplexes of Graphene Oxide and Platinum Nanoparticles against Colorectal Cancer Colo205, HT-29, HTC-116, SW480, Liver Cancer HepG2, Human Breast Cancer MCF-7, and Adenocarcinoma LNCaP and Human Cervical Hela B Cell Lines.",https://www.ncbi.nlm.nih.gov/pubmed/30893818,"Materials (Basel, Switzerland)",2019 04 28,"Inefficient drug administration into cancer cells is related to the chemoresistance of cancer cells caused by genetic mutations including genes involved in drug transport, enzyme metabolism, and/or DNA damage repair. The objective of the present study was to evaluate the properties of platinum (NP-Pt), graphene oxide (GO), and the nanocomplex of GO functionalized with platinum nanoparticles (GO-NP-Pt) against several genetically, phenotypically, and metabolically different cancer cell lines: Colo205, HT-29, HTC-116, SW480, HepG2, MCF-7, LNCaP, and Hela B. The anticancer effects toward the cancer cell lines were evaluated by 2,3-bis-(2-methoxy-4-nitro-5-sulfophenyl)-2H-tetrazolium-5-carboxyanilide salt (XTT) and bromodeoxyuridine (BrdU) assays and measurements of cell apoptosis and morphology deformations. The NP-Pt and GO could effectively be introduced to cancer cells, but more effective delivery was observed after GO-NP-Pt treatment. The delivery of the GO-NP-Pt nanocomplex significantly decreased the viability of Colo 205 and HepG2 cells, but did not increase the cytotoxicity of other investigated cancer cells. The nanocomplex GO-NP-Pt also significantly increased the apoptosis of Colo 205 and HepG2 cancer cells. The obtained results suggest that the nanocomplex GO-NP-Pt is a remarkable nanostructure that can improve the delivery of Pt nanoparticles into cancer cells and has potential anticancer applications.",G-Quadruplexes as An Alternative Recognition Element in Disease-Related Target Sensing.,https://www.ncbi.nlm.nih.gov/pubmed/30893817,"Molecules (Basel, Switzerland)",2019 04 28,"G-quadruplexes are made up of guanine-rich RNA and DNA sequences capable of forming noncanonical nucleic acid secondary structures. The base-specific sterical configuration of G-quadruplexes allows the stacked G-tetrads to bind certain planar molecules like hemin (iron (III)-protoporphyrin IX) to regulate enzymatic-like functions such as peroxidase-mimicking activity, hence the use of the term DNAzyme/RNAzyme. This ability has been widely touted as a suitable substitute to conventional enzymatic reporter systems in diagnostics. This review will provide a brief overview of the G-quadruplex architecture as well as the many forms of reporter systems ranging from absorbance to luminescence readouts in various platforms. Furthermore, some challenges and improvements that have been introduced to improve the application of G-quadruplex in diagnostics will be highlighted. As the field of diagnostics has evolved to apply different detection systems, the need for alternative reporter systems such as G-quadruplexes is also paramount.",CuDDI: A CUDA-Based Application for Extracting Drug-Drug Interaction Related Substance Terms from PubMed Literature.,https://www.ncbi.nlm.nih.gov/pubmed/30893816,"Molecules (Basel, Switzerland)",2019 04 28,"Drug-drug interaction (DDI) is becoming a serious issue in clinical pharmacy as the use of multiple medications is more common. The PubMed database is one of the biggest literature resources for DDI studies. It contains over 150,000 journal articles related to DDI and is still expanding at a rapid pace. The extraction of DDI-related information, including compounds and proteins from PubMed, is an essential step for DDI research. In this paper, we introduce a tool, CuDDI (compute unified device architecture-based DDI searching), for identification of DDI-related terms (including compounds and proteins) from PubMed. There are three modules in this application, including the automatic retrieval of substances from PubMed, the identification of DDI-related terms, and the display of relationship of DDI-related terms. For DDI term identification, a speedup of 30⁻105 times was observed for the compute unified device architecture (CUDA)-based version compared with the implementation with a CPU-based Python version. CuDDI can be used to discover DDI-related terms and relationships of these terms, which has the potential to help clinicians and pharmacists better understand the mechanism of DDIs.

With the teleost Medaka (Oryzias latipes), which now has a significant following, and over 30,000 other fish species worldwide, there is great potential to study the biology of environmental adaptation using teleosts. Zebrafish are primarily used for research on developmental biology, for obvious reasons. However, fish in general have also contributed to our understanding of circadian clock biology in the broadest sense. In this review, we will discuss selected areas where this contribution seems most unique. This will include a discussion of the issue of central versus peripheral clocks, in which zebrafish played an early role; the global nature of light sensitivity; and the critical role played by light in regulating cell biology. In addition, we also discuss the importance of the clock in controlling the timing of fundamental aspects of cell biology, such as the temporal control of the cell cycle. Many of these findings are applicable to the majority of vertebrate species. However, some reflect the unique manner in which ""fish"" can solve biological problems, in an evolutionary context. Genome duplication events simply mean that many fish species have more gene copies to ""throw at a problem"", and evolution seems to have taken advantage of this ""gene abundance"". How this relates to their poor cousins, the mammals, remains to be seen.",Molecular Analysis of HLA-G in Women with High-Risk Pregnancy and Their Partners with Regard to Possible Complications.,https://www.ncbi.nlm.nih.gov/pubmed/30893814,International journal of environmental research and public health,2019 05 06,"The understanding of the molecular and biochemical characteristics of the human leukocyte antigen-G (HLA-G) is important because of the diverse influence of this antigen's polymorphisms on the course of a pregnancy. The aim of our study was to assess how the variation of the HLA-G allele and the HLA-G 14-bp ins/del polymorphism influence predisposition to a complicated pregnancy. The clinical material consisted of parental pairs with complicated pregnancies (210 women; 190 men). The control group included parental pairs without complications during pregnancy (89 women; 86 men). The study involved isolation of genome DNA from peripheral blood leukocytes, sequencing, and analysis of the 14-bp ins/del polymorphism in the 3'-untranslated region (3'-UTR) of the HLA-G gene based on polymerase chain reaction (PCR). The most common HLA-G allele in the group of women with complicated pregnancies was the HLA-G 10101 allele. There were no statistically significant differences in the frequencies of the 14-bp ins/del polymorphism in the 3'UTR of the HLA-G gene between the groups. Our results suggest that the risk of complications in pregnancy is influenced by the HLA-G 10101, HLA-G 10108, and HLA-G 10106 alleles and is not influenced by the 14-bp ins/del polymorphism in the 3'UTR of the HLA-G gene."

In this study, we report a sizable increase in carcinogenic properties of the mixture when a suspension containing calcium carbonate nanoparticles was added to it. This technique allowed us to reduce both the number of the carcinogen administrations from twelve to two and the time to the cancer induction from six to four months. Although the induced tumors were represented by the intramucosal carcinomas, they were characterized by the extensive invasion of individual tumor cells and their clusters into the muscle layer and serosa as well as into the omentum and blood vessels. Considering that the invasive tumor cells were positive for vimentin, Snail and TGF-β2, we concluded that their invasion was the result of the activation of epithelial⁻mesenchymal transition (EMT) mechanisms. Thus, taking into account the data obtained, it can be assumed that under the conditions of inflammation or carcinogenesis, the calcium carbonate nanoparticles may affect the activation of EMT mechanisms.",The Relationship between Food Insecurity and Symptoms of Attention-Deficit Hyperactivity Disorder in Children: A Summary of the Literature.,https://www.ncbi.nlm.nih.gov/pubmed/30893802,Nutrients,2019 04 26,"Food insecurity is a major public health concern characterized by an individual or household lacking access to adequate food to support a healthy lifestyle. Food insecurity has been associated with predisposing or exacerbating mental health symptoms in children. However, the evidence is scarce with regards to Attention-Deficit Hyperactivity Disorder (ADHD) symptoms in children. The purpose of this review is to summarize and identify gaps in the existing literature, as well as to explore associations between food insecurity and symptoms of childhood ADHD. Literature for this review was pulled from Ovid MEDLINE and PubMed library databases, with a focus on food insecurity, food insufficiency, hunger, and ADHD symptoms such as inattention, hyperactivity, and impulsivity in children. The limited evidence to date shows a predictive and inverse relationship between childhood experience of food insecurity and symptoms of ADHD, with lasting impacts into adulthood. Evidence exists to hypothesize that childhood food insecurity is associated with predisposing or exacerbating ADHD symptoms in children, yet the literature needed to confirm this relationship is scarce and utilizes inconsistent methodology. Future research is needed to further characterize this complex relationship and inspire community or public health interventions addressing food insecurity in children with ADHD. Additionally, it may be clinically useful to routinely screen for food insecurity when assessing pediatric ADHD symptoms.",Biological Activity and In Silico Study of 3-Modified Derivatives of Betulin and Betulinic Aldehyde.,https://www.ncbi.nlm.nih.gov/pubmed/30893801,International journal of molecular sciences,2019 04 28,"A series of 3-substituted derivatives of betulin and betulinic aldehyde were synthesized as promising anticancer agents.

The compound 9 showed towards Du-145, MCF-7 and Hs294T cells significant antiproliferative activity with IC50 ranging from 7.3 to 10.6 μM. The evaluation of ADME properties of all compounds also includes their pharmacokinetic profile. The calculated TPSA values for synthetized derivatives are in the range between 43.38 Å² and 55.77 Å² suggesting high oral bioavailability.

The here presented comprehensive analysis of the venom gland transcriptome and proteome of Cupiennius salei focusses on proteins and cysteine-containing peptides and offers new insight into the structure and function of spider venom, here described as the dual prey-inactivation strategy. After venom injection, many enzymes and proteins, dominated by α-amylase, angiotensin-converting enzyme, and cysteine-rich secretory proteins, interact with main metabolic pathways, leading to a major disturbance of the cellular homeostasis. Hyaluronidase and cytolytic peptides destroy tissue and membranes, thus supporting the spread of other venom compounds. We detected 81 transcripts of neurotoxins from 13 peptide families, whereof two families comprise 93.7% of all cysteine-containing peptides. This raises the question of the importance of the other low-expressed peptide families. The identification of a venom gland-specific defensin-like peptide and an aga-toxin-like peptide in the hemocytes offers an important clue on the recruitment and neofunctionalization of body proteins and peptides as the origin of toxins.",An Energy Efficient Synchronization Protocol for Target Tracking in Wireless Sensor Array Networks.,https://www.ncbi.nlm.nih.gov/pubmed/30893799,"Sensors (Basel, Switzerland)",2019 04 28,"Time synchronization is an important middleware function that supports the Quality of Service (QoS) of systems in wireless sensor array networks. Instead of providing high synchronization accuracy for all application scenarios, we argue that synchronization protocols should be application specific. In this paper, we exploit the synchronization requirements of target-tracking systems in wireless sensor array networks and propose an energy-efficient Sensor Array Synchronization Protocol (SASP), which provides the required synchronization accuracy to guarantee the QoS. Specifically, when no target appears, to guarantee system lifetime, coarse synchronization is achieved with little overhead by piggybacking time information onto periodical network maintenance packets. Once targets appear, SASP achieves high inter-array and relatively higher intra-array synchronization accuracy rather than the traditional network-wide high accuracy on average. In this way, it guarantees reliable communication and accurate data fusion, while reducing energy consumption. Theoretical analysis and extensive evaluations show the effectiveness of the proposed protocol.",Simultaneous Determination and Risk Assessment of Pyrrolizidine Alkaloids in Artemisia capillaris Thunb. by UPLC-MS/MS Together with Chemometrics.,https://www.ncbi.nlm.nih.gov/pubmed/30893797,"Molecules (Basel, Switzerland)",2019 04 28,"Pyrrolizidine alkaloids (PAs) are natural toxins found in some genera of the family Asteraceae.

The purpose of this study was to establish a sensitive and rapid UPLC-MS/MS method together with chemometrics analysis for simultaneous determination and risk assessment of PAs in A. capillaris. The developed UPLC-MS/MS method was validated and was confirmed to display desirable high selectivity, precision and accuracy. Risk assessment was conducted according to the European Medicines Agency (EMA) guideline. Chemometrics analysis was performed with hierarchical clustering analysis and principal component analysis to characterize the differences between PAs of A. capillaris. Finally, PAs were found in 29 out of 30 samples and at least two were detected in each sample, besides, more than half of the samples exceeded the EMA baseline. Nevertheless, the chemometrics results suggested that the PAs contents of A. capillaris from different sources varied significantly. The method was successfully applied to the detection and risk evaluation of PAs-containing A. capillaris for the first time.

Local delivery of biologics directly to the inflamed mucosa via rectal enema administration addresses the problems associated with systemic administration. Hydrogels are potentially useful delivery vehicles enabling rectal administration of biologics. Here, we prepared a hydrogel system based on methylcellulose (MC) and hyaluronic acid (HA), which possesses mucosal healing properties, incorporating a model macromolecular drug, namely (fluorescently-labeled) bovine serum albumin (BSA). The BSA-loaded MCHA hydrogel showed temperature-dependent gelation (liquid-like at 20 °C and gel-like at 37 °C) and shear thinning behavior, with these being important and desirable characteristics for rectal application (enabling easy application and retention). BSA release from the MCHA system at 37 °C was linear, with 50% of the loaded drug released within 2 h. The system demonstrated acceptable toxicity towards intestinal (colon) Caco-2 epithelial cells, even at high concentrations. Importantly, application of the BSA-loaded MCHA hydrogel to polarized Caco-2 monolayers, with or without an exemplar absorption enhancer, resulted in transintestinal permeability of BSA. The study therefore indicates that the MCHA hydrogel shows potential for topical (rectal) delivery of biologics in IBD.",Selective Detection of Human Lung Adenocarcinoma Cells Based on the Aptamer-Conjugated Self-Assembled Monolayer of Gold Nanoparticles.,https://www.ncbi.nlm.nih.gov/pubmed/30893795,Micromachines,2019 04 28,"This study established a microfluidic chip for the capture of A549 human lung circulating tumor cells via the aptamer-conjugated self-assembled monolayer (SAM) of gold nanoparticles (AuNPs) in the channel.

Accumulating studies have revealed that transcription factors, including GATA-3, Bcl11b, Gfi1, RORα, and Ets-1, play a role in ILC2 differentiation. Recent reports have further revealed that the characteristics and functions of ILC2 are influenced by the physiological state of the tissues. Specifically, the type of inflammation strongly affects the ILC2 phenotype in tissues. Inhibitory ILC2s, memory-like ILC2s, and ex-ILC2s with ILC1 features acquire their characteristic properties following exposure to their specific inflammatory environment. We have recently reported a new ILC2 population, designated as exhausted-like ILC2s, which emerges after a severe allergic inflammation. Exhausted-like ILC2s are featured with low reactivity and high expression of inhibitory receptors. Therefore, for a more comprehensive understanding of ILC2 function and differentiation, we review the recent knowledge of transcriptional regulation of ILC2 differentiation and discuss the roles of the Runx transcription factor in controlling the emergence of exhausted-like ILC2s.

Methods: Secondary analysis of how YLDs from conditions likely benefiting from physical rehabilitation have evolved from 1990 to 2017, for the world and across countries of varying income levels. Linear regression analyses were used. Results: A 66.2% growth was found in estimated YLD Counts germane to physical rehabilitation: a significant and linear growth of more than 5.1 billion YLDs per year (99% CI: 4.8⁻5.4; r² = 0.99). Low-income countries more than doubled (111.5% growth) their YLD Counts likely benefiting from physical rehabilitation since 1990. YLD Rates per 100,000 people and the percentage of YLDs likley benefiting from physical rehabilitation also grew significantly over time, across locations (all p > 0.05). Finally, only in high-income countries did Age-standardized YLD Rates significantly decrease (p < 0.01; r² = 0.86). Conclusions: Physical rehabilitation needs have been growing significantly in absolute, per-capita and in percentage of total YLDs. This growth was found globally and across countries of varying income level. In absolute terms, growths were higher in lower income countries, wherein rehabilitation is under-resourced, thereby highlighting important unmet needs."

In this systematic review and meta-analysis, we assessed the association of focal NED in conventional PC with oncological outcomes after RP. A literature search using PubMed, Scopus, Web of Science, and Cochrane Library was conducted on December 2018 to find relevant studies according to the Preferred Reporting Items for Systematic Review and Meta-Analysis (PRISMA) guidelines. We used a fixed-effect model to analyze the impact of focal NED in RP specimen on progression-free survival defined by biochemical recurrence (BCR). A total of 16 studies with the outcomes of disease progression and survival were eligible. No patient in these studies received androgen deprivation therapy prior to RP. Eleven studies found no significant correlation between focal NED and outcomes of interest, while five studies reported a significant association of focal NED assessed by immunohistochemical chromogranin A or serotonin staining with BCR or survival. Focal NED was associated with higher BCR rates after RP with a pooled HR of 1.39 (95% CI 1.07‒1.81) in five studies. No heterogeneity was reported in this analysis (I² = 21.7%, p = 0.276). In conclusion, focal NED in conventional PC is associated with worse prognosis after RP.

The markets for these products are generally very distant, and any damage caused to the fruit during harvesting will be expressed in its shelf life. The first step to understanding the harvesting process is to identify what happens to the harvest baskets in each stage (picking, wait-full, transport-full, freezing tunnel, emptying and transport-empty), allowing variables that can affect the shelf life to be identified. This article proposes the use of Smartbins, intelligent harvest baskets with sensors to collect weight, temperature, and vibration data. Combined analysis of the variables collected, using machine learning algorithms, allows the system to estimate which stage the basket is at with an accuracy of 80%, and to assess whether the fruit has been exposed to situations that could affect its shelf life. Due to imbalance characteristics of the data collected, the best results were obtained in longer stages (picking and wait-full stages with 89% and 86% respectively).",Steroids from the Deep-Sea-Derived Fungus Penicilliumgranulatum MCCC 3A00475 Induced Apoptosis via Retinoid X Receptor (RXR)-α Pathway.,https://www.ncbi.nlm.nih.gov/pubmed/30893778,Marine drugs,2019 04 28,"Five new ergostanes, penicisteroids D-H (1-5), were isolated from the liquid culture of the deep-sea-derived fungus Penicillium granulatum MCCC 3A00475, along with 27 known compounds. The structures of the new steroids were established mainly on the basis of extensive analysis of 1D and 2D NMR as well as HRESIMS data. Moreover, the absolute configurations of 1 were confirmed unambiguously by the single-crystal X-ray crystallography. Compounds 2 and 4⁻7 showed moderate antiproliferative effects selectively against 12 different cancer cell lines with IC50 values of around 5 μM. Compounds 2 and 6, potent RXRα binders with Kd values of 13.8 and 12.9 μM, respectively, could induce apoptosis by a Retinoid X Receptor (RXR)-α-dependent mechanism by regulating RXRα transcriptional expression and promoting the poly-ADP-ribose polymerase (PARP) cleavage. Moreover, they could inhibit proliferation by cell cycle arrest at the G0/G1 phase.",Association between CMV and Invasive Fungal Infections After Autologous Stem Cell Transplant in Lymphoproliferative Malignancies: Opportunistic Partnership or Cause-Effect Relationship?,https://www.ncbi.nlm.nih.gov/pubmed/30893777,International journal of molecular sciences,2019 04 28,"Unlike allogeneic transplant, autologous stem cell transplantation (ASCT) represents a procedure with a low-risk of cytomegalovirus (CMV) symptomatic reactivation-infection/end-organ disease (CMV complications) and invasive fungal disease (IFD). However, novel drugs for the treatment of lymphoproliferative malignancies could cause an increase of such opportunistic infections, even after ASCT. To the best of our knowledge, there are no published data demonstrating an association between CMV and IFD in the autologous setting, while this association has been widely reported in allogeneic transplantation. We have reviewed our series of 347 ASCT in myeloma and lymphoma patients performed over a period of 14 years with the aim of investigating the descriptive and analytical epidemiology of bacterial, CMV and IFD complications, focusing on the association between CMV and IFD. Patients with myeloma have significantly fewer bacterial infections and IFD than patients with lymphoma, but a similar rate of CMV complications. Descriptive epidemiological data are consistent with the literature, indicating an overall incidence of 36%, 3.5% and 15.5% for bacterial infections, IFD and CMV complications, with a case mortality rate of 4%, 16.7% and 3.7%, respectively. A strong correlation between CMV and IFD exists, with 8 cases of IFD out of a total of 12 presenting a CMV complication. At multivariate analysis, a diagnosis of lymphoma, ≥3 previous treatment lines and age ≥60 years were found to be independent risk factors for IFD. Duration of neutropenia (ANC < 500/mm³) ≥7 days represents an independent risk factor for CMV complications, where neutropenia most likely represents a crude surrogate biomarker indicating a deeper and longer state of overall immunosuppression. From our data we conclude that (1) myeloma patients are at lower risk of bacterial infections and IFD as compared with lymphoma patients but are at equal risk of CMV complications, most likely as a consequence of a selective impact of bortezomib on Herpes Viruses infection control; (2) a significant association exists between CMV and IFD, although a possible cause-effect relationship remains to be determined; (3) IFD is a rare complication after ASCT but burdened by a mortality rate of about 17%, with peak rates in older lymphoma patients who underwent more intensive therapeutic regimens.",Contribution of Anoctamins to Cell Survival and Cell Death.,https://www.ncbi.nlm.nih.gov/pubmed/30893776,Cancers,2019 04 26,"Before anoctamins (TMEM16 proteins) were identified as a family of Ca2+-activated chloride channels and phospholipid scramblases, the founding member anoctamin 1 (ANO1, TMEM16A) was known as DOG1, a marker protein for gastrointestinal stromal tumors (GIST). Meanwhile, ANO1 has been examined in more detail, and the role of ANO1 in cell proliferation and the development of different types of malignomas is now well established. While ANO5, ANO7, and ANO9 may also be relevant for growth of cancers, evidence has been provided for a role of ANO6 (TMEM16F) in regulated cell death. The cellular mechanisms by which anoctamins control cell proliferation and cell death, respectively, are just emerging; however, the pronounced effects of anoctamins on intracellular Ca2+ levels are likely to play a significant role. Recent results suggest that some anoctamins control membrane exocytosis by setting Ca2+i levels near the plasma membrane, and/or by controlling the intracellular Cl- concentration. Exocytosis and increased membrane trafficking induced by ANO1 and ANO6 may enhance membrane expression of other chloride channels, such as CFTR and volume activated chloride channels (VRAC). Notably, ANO6-induced phospholipid scrambling with exposure of phosphatidylserine is pivotal for the sheddase function of disintegrin and metalloproteinase (ADAM). This may support cell death and tumorigenic activity of IL-6 by inducing IL-6 trans-signaling. The reported anticancer effects of the anthelminthic drug niclosamide are probably related to the potent inhibitory effect on ANO1, apart from inducing cell cycle arrest through the Let-7d/CDC34 axis. On the contrary, pronounced activation of ANO6 due to a large increase in intracellular calcium, activation of phospholipase A2 or lipid peroxidation, can lead to ferroptotic death of cancer cells. It therefore appears reasonable to search for both inhibitors and potent activators of TMEM16 in order to interfere with cancer growth and metastasis.",Suppression of the Ubiquitin Pathway by Small Molecule Binding to Ubiquitin Enhances Doxorubicin Sensitivity of the Cancer Cells.,https://www.ncbi.nlm.nih.gov/pubmed/30893775,"Molecules (Basel, Switzerland)",2019 04 28,"Development of inhibitors for ubiquitin pathway has been suggested as a promising strategy to treat several types of cancers, which has been showcased by recent success of a series of novel anticancer drugs based on inhibition of ubiquitin pathways. Although the druggability of enzymes in ubiquitin pathways has been demonstrated, ubiquitin itself, the main agent of the pathway, has not been targeted. Whereas conventional enzyme inhibitors are used to silence the ubiquitination or reverse it, they cannot disrupt the binding activity of ubiquitin. Herein, we report that the scaffolds of sulfonated aryl diazo compounds, particularly Congo red, could disrupt the binding activity of ubiquitin, resulting in the activity equivalent to inhibition of ubiquitination. NMR mapping assay demonstrated that the chemical directly binds to the recognition site for ubiquitin processing enzymes on the surface of ubiquitin, and thereby blocks the binding of ubiquitin to its cognate receptors. As a proof of concept for the druggability of the ubiquitin molecule, we demonstrated that Congo red acted as an intracellular inhibitor of ubiquitin recognition and binding, which led to inhibition of ubiquitination, and thereby, could be used as a sensitizer for conventional anticancer drugs, doxorubicin.",Ebola Virus Entry: From Molecular Characterization to Drug Discovery.,https://www.ncbi.nlm.nih.gov/pubmed/30893774,Viruses,2019 04 19,"Ebola Virus Disease (EVD) is one of the most lethal transmissible infections, characterized by a high fatality rate, and caused by a member of the Filoviridae family. The recent large outbreak of EVD in Western Africa (2013⁻2016) highlighted the worldwide threat represented by the disease and its impact on global public health and the economy. The development of highly needed anti-Ebola virus antivirals has been so far hampered by the shortage of tools to study their life cycle in vitro, allowing to screen for potential active compounds outside a biosafety level-4 (BSL-4) containment. Importantly, the development of surrogate models to study Ebola virus entry in a BSL-2 setting, such as viral pseudotypes and Ebola virus-like particles, tremendously boosted both our knowledge of the viral life cycle and the identification of promising antiviral compounds interfering with viral entry. In this context, the combination of such surrogate systems with large-scale small molecule compounds and haploid genetic screenings, as well as rational drug design and drug repurposing approaches will prove priceless in our quest for the development of a treatment for EVD.","Monitoring the Degradation of Island Permafrost Using Time-Series InSAR Technique: A Case Study of Heihe, China.",https://www.ncbi.nlm.nih.gov/pubmed/30893773,"Sensors (Basel, Switzerland)",2019 04 28,"In the context of global warming, the air temperature of the Heihe basin in Northeast China has increased significantly, resulting in the degradation of the island permafrost. In this paper, we used an elaborated time-series Interferometric Synthetic Aperture Radar (InSAR) strategy to monitor the ground deformation in the Heihe area (Heilongjiang Province, China) and then analyzed the permafrost deformation characteristics from June 2007 to December 2010. The results showed that the region presented island permafrost surface deformation, and the deformation rate along the line of sight mainly varied from ⁻70 to 70 mm/a. Based on the analysis of remote sensing and topological measurements, we found that the deformation area generally occurred at lower altitudes and on shady slopes, which is consistent with the distribution characteristics of permafrost islands. Additionally, the deformation of permafrost is highly correlated with the increase of annual minimum temperature, with an average correlation value of ⁻0.80. The accelerated degradation of permafrost in the study area led to the settlement, threatening the infrastructure safety. Our results reveal accelerated degradation characteristics for the island permafrost under the background of rising air temperature, and provide a reference for future relevant research.",Peroxiporins in Cancer.,https://www.ncbi.nlm.nih.gov/pubmed/30893772,International journal of molecular sciences,2019 04 28,"The transport of H₂O₂ across membranes by specific aquaporins (AQPs) has been considered the last milestone in the timeline of hydrogen peroxide discoveries in biochemistry. According to its concentration and localization, H₂O₂ can be dangerous or acts as a signaling molecule in various cellular processes as either a paracrine (intercellular) and/or an autocrine (intracellular) signal. In this review, we investigate and critically examine the available information on AQP isoforms able to facilitate H₂O₂ across biological membranes (""peroxiporins""), focusing in particular on their role in cancer. Moreover, the ability of natural compounds to modulate expression and/or activity of peroxiporins is schematically reported and discussed."

Medicago sativa subsp. falcata (L.) Arcang. (hereafter M. falcata) is a forage legume with a higher cold tolerance than Medicago truncatula, a model legume. Cold acclimation treatment resulted in increased cold tolerance in both M. falcata and M. truncatula, which was suppressed by pretreatment with tungstate, an inhibitor of nitrate reductase (NR), and 2-phenyl-4,4,5,5-tetramethylimidazoline-1-oxyl 3-oxide (PTIO), a scavenger of NO. Likely, NITRATE REDUCTASE 1 (NIA1), but not NIA2 transcript, NR activity, and NO production were increased after cold treatment. Treatments with exogenous NO donors resulted in increased cold tolerance in both species. Superoxide dismutase (SOD), catalase (CAT), and ascorbate-peroxidase (APX) activities and Cu,Zn-SOD2, Cu,Zn-SOD3, cytosolic APX1 (cAPX1), cAPX3 and chloroplastic APX1 (cpAPX1) transcript levels were induced in both species after cold treatment, which was suppressed by tungstate and 2-phenyl-4,4,5,5-tetramethylimidazoline-1-oxyl 3-oxide (PTIO). Treatment with exogenous NO resulted in enhanced activities of SOD, CAT, and APX. Moreover, higher levels of NIA1 transcript, NR activity, NO production, and antioxidant enzyme activities and transcripts were observed in M. falcata as compared with M. truncatula after cold treatment. The results suggest that NR-derived NO production and upregulated antioxidant defense are involved in cold acclimation in both species, while the higher levels of NO production and its derived antioxidant enzymes are associated with the higher cold tolerance in M. falcata as compared with M. truncatula.",Mycosporine-Like Amino Acids (MAAs) in Time-Series of Lichen Specimens from Natural History Collections.,https://www.ncbi.nlm.nih.gov/pubmed/30893758,"Molecules (Basel, Switzerland)",2019 04 28,"Mycosporine-like amino acids (MAAs) were quantified in fresh and preserved material of the chlorolichen Dermatocarponluridum var. luridum (Verrucariaceae/Ascomycota). The analyzed samples represented a time-series of over 150 years. An HPLC coupled with a diode array detector (HPLC-DAD) in hydrophilic interaction liquid chromatography (HILIC) mode method was developed and validated for the quantitative determination of MAAs. We found evidence for substance specific differences in the quality of preservation of two MAAs (mycosporine glutamicol, mycosporine glutaminol) in Natural History Collections. We found no change in average mycosporine glutamicol concentrations over time. Mycosporine glutaminol concentrations instead decreased rapidly with no trace of this substance detectable in collections older than nine years. Our data predict that a screening for MAAs in organism samples from Natural History Collections can deliver results that are comparable to those obtained from fresh collections only for some MAAs (e.g., mycosporine glutamicol). For other MAAs, misleading, biased, or even false negative results will occur as a result of the storage sensitivity of substances such as mycosporine glutaminol. Our study demonstrates the value of pilot studies with time-series based on model taxa with a rich representation in the Natural History Collections.",In Vitro Induction of T Helper 17 Cells by Synergistic Activation of Human Monocyte-Derived Langerhans Cell-Like Cells with Bacterial Agonists.,https://www.ncbi.nlm.nih.gov/pubmed/30893757,International journal of molecular sciences,2019 04 28,"In the case of epidermal barrier disruption, pathogens encounter skin-resident Langerhans cells (LCs) and are recognized by pathogen recognition receptors such as Toll-like receptors (TLRs). As the majority of microorganisms exhibit more than one TLR ligand, the mechanisms of subsequent T cell differentiation are complex and far from clear. In this study, we investigated combinatory effects on Th cell polarization by bacterial cell wall compounds peptidoglycan (PGN) and lipopolysaccharide (LPS) and by bacterial nucleic acid (DNA). Expression of maturation markers CD40, CD80, HLA-DR and CCR7 and the release of IL-1β, IL-6 and IL-23 was strongly enhanced by simultaneous exposure to PGN, LPS and DNA in LCs. As all these factors were potential Th17 driving cytokines, we investigated the potency of combinatory TLR stimuli to induce Th17 cells via LC activation. High amounts of IL-17A and IL-22, key cytokines of Th17 cells, were detected. By intracellular costaining of IL-17⁺T cells, IL-22- (Th17) and IL-22⁺ (immature Th17) cells were identified. Interestingly, one population of LPS stimulated cells skewed into IL-9⁺Th cells, and LPS synergized with PGN while inducing high IL-22. In conclusion, our data indicates that when mediated by a fine-tuned signal integration via LCs, bacterial TLR agonists synergize and induce Th17 differentiation.",Tissue-Resident Innate and Innate-Like Lymphocyte Responses to Viral Infection.,https://www.ncbi.nlm.nih.gov/pubmed/30893756,Viruses,2019 04 19,"Infection is restrained by the concerted activation of tissue-resident and circulating immune cells. Recent discoveries have demonstrated that tissue-resident lymphocyte subsets, comprised of innate lymphoid cells (ILCs) and unconventional T cells, have vital roles in the initiation of primary antiviral responses. Via direct and indirect mechanisms, ILCs and unconventional T cell subsets play a critical role in the ability of the immune system to mount an effective antiviral response through potent early cytokine production. In this review, we will summarize the current knowledge of tissue-resident lymphocytes during initial viral infection and evaluate their redundant or nonredundant contributions to host protection or virus-induced pathology.",In vivo actions of Bisphenol F on the reproductive neuroendocrine system after long-term exposure in zebrafish.,https://www.ncbi.nlm.nih.gov/pubmed/30893755,The Science of the total environment,2019 04 16,"Although Bisphenol F (BPF), a bisphenol A (BPA) analogue with a similar chemical structure to that of BPA, is widely used in commercial products, little is known about its potential toxic effects on the reproductive neuroendocrine system in vivo. The present study aimed to comprehensively evaluate the effects of BPF on the reproductive neuroendocrine system in zebrafish and to assess the potential mechanisms underlying its association with estrogen receptor (ER) and aromatase (AROM) pathways. Long-term exposure to environmentally relevant and low levels of BPF led to increased expression of reproductive neuroendocrine-related genes (kiss1, kiss1r, gnrh3, lhβ, and fshβ) in the zebrafish brain, as well as increased levels of adrenocorticotropic, gonadotropin-releasing, luteinizing, and follicle-stimulating hormones in the zebrafish brain and vitellogenin in the zebrafish liver. In addition, these effects were associated with an increase in erα, erβ, cyp19a, and cyp19b activity. Meanwhile, ER and AROM antagonists, alone or in combination, significantly attenuated the stimulation of kiss1, lhβ, vtg, and gnrh3 expression, thereby suggesting that chronic BPF exposure affects the regulation of the reproductive neuroendocrine system through activation of the ER and AROM pathways. Moreover, since BPF and bisphenol S induced toxic and reproductive neuroendocrine effects similar to those of BPA, the current accepted usage of BPA and its analogs should be reconsidered in the future.",Impact of ski piste management on mountain grassland ecosystems in the Southern Alps.,https://www.ncbi.nlm.nih.gov/pubmed/30893754,The Science of the total environment,2019 04 16,"In the Southern Alps, climate warming induced the use of artificial snow since two decades. In this area, two different ski piste management practices prevail: (1) large and medium ski resorts (M), which guarantee a ski season of four to five months using artificial snow, whereas (2) in the small, local ski resorts (S) it usually lasts two or three months. Our research addresses two main questions: 1) what is the impact of the ski pistes on the physico-chemical properties of the snow, on the soil and on the vegetation of mountain grassland ecosystems and 2) does the impact on the mountain grassland ecosystems change between medium and small ski resorts? Our experimental approach follows a pairwise design of plots on mountain grasslands of the ski pistes and control plots on mountain grasslands outside the pistes, where we examined the snow and soil properties and the vegetation composition. Under the long ski-season management (M) we found a significantly lower soil temperature below the snow cover of the ski pistes than the one below the natural snowpack, but this difference was limited to the period of natural snow cover. Only in M, pistes showed a lower biomass production and species richness in the mountain grassland plant communities compared to the controls, while there was no effect in S. The proportions of plant functional groups' cover changed in both ski resort types between piste and control. The most important factors affecting the observed differences in vegetation between pistes and controls were snow duration, snow and soil chemical properties, with more marked differences in the soil properties in M respect to S. The study concludes that reducing the ski season's length, therefore limiting the artificial snow's input, as in S, is more adequate to minimize the environmental impact in a changing climate.",Skin permeation of oxides of nitrogen and sulfur from short-term exposure scenarios relevant to hazardous material incidents.,https://www.ncbi.nlm.nih.gov/pubmed/30893753,The Science of the total environment,2019 04 16,"Permeation of oxides of nitrogen and sulfur gases through skin and the consequences of dermal exposure are still poorly understood. We measured the penetration profile of three common industrial gases through skin, for short-term exposures relevant to HAZMAT scenarios. Time variations of gas concentration, clothing effects, temperature and humidity on epidermal absorption and penetration were assessed. Fabric off-gassing profiles were also investigated. The results show oxides of nitrogen (NO and NO2) at airborne concentrations up to lethal inhalation levels (e.g. 3000 ppm) have little skin penetration ability. Skin absorption and reservoir effects were noted. Skin exposed to SO2 (3000 ppm/30 min) shows negligible skin absorption or penetration. Fabric on skin marginally increased SO2 absorption and subsequent ventilation did not reduce the absorbed fraction. Increased temperature and humidity had limited additional effect on skin penetration. Importantly, clothing demonstrated sink properties, especially for SO2. Short-term skin exposure relevant to accidents will not significantly contribute to body burden. The greatest concern will likely be off-gassing of chemical-laden fabric for asthma suffers. The risk-based management approach is to avoid potential secondary inhalation from fabric off-gassing by removal of outer layer of bulky clothing. Decontamination and moving into an area of enhanced ventilation may also be advised.",Tracing nitrogen sources fueling coastal green tides off a volcanic island using radon and nitrogen isotopic tracers.,https://www.ncbi.nlm.nih.gov/pubmed/30893751,The Science of the total environment,2019 04 16,"The main sources of nutrients fueling coastal green tides off a volcanic island surrounded by an oligotrophic ocean are obscure, although they result in many societal and ecosystem problems. In this study, we attempted to trace the source inputs of nutrients in coastal waters off a volcanic island, Jeju, Korea, where the formation of green tides is perennial, using a radioisotope (222Rn) and stable isotopes (δ15N and δ18O) as tracers. Sampling of groundwater, seawater, fish-farm water, and Ulva spp. was performed during April and July 2015. The contribution of submarine fresh groundwater discharge (SFGD) to the dissolved inorganic nitrogen input was >70%, with additional inputs from aqua-cultural activities and bottom sediments. The δ15N-NO3 and δ18O-NO3 values in the coastal seawater and groundwater indicate that the main source of NO3- is fertilizer, rather than other potential sources, such as aquacultural wastewater, sewage/manure contamination, or precipitation, in this region. The δ15N value (+7.3-+7.7‰) in Ulva spp. also indicates the same source. Thus, our results suggest that the rapid infiltration of land N-fertilizer and subsequent leakage into the coastal ocean through submarine groundwater discharge (SGD) results in green tide massive occurrence in coastal waters off a high-permeability volcanic island.","Organophosphate flame retardants in college dormitory dust of northern Chinese cities: Occurrence, human exposure and risk assessment.",https://www.ncbi.nlm.nih.gov/pubmed/30893750,The Science of the total environment,2019 04 16,"Organophosphate flame retardants (OPFRs) are widely added to consumer products and building materials, which may pose potential health risk to humans. But information on their contamination and human exposure in the indoor environment especially dormitories in northern China is rare. In this study, twelve OPFRs were investigated in college dormitory dust that collected from Harbin, Shenyang, and Baoding, in northern China. Indoor dust samples were also collected from homes and public microenvironments (PMEs) in Harbin for comparison. The median ∑OPFR concentrations in dormitory dust in Shenyang samples (8690 ng/g) were higher than those in Baoding (6540 ng/g) and Harbin (6190 ng/g). The median ∑OPFR concentrations in home dust (7150 ng/g) were higher than in dormitory and PME dust (5340 ng/g) in Harbin. Tris(2‑chloroethyl) phosphate (TCEP) and tris (2-chloroisopropyl) phosphate (TCIPP) were the most abundant chlorinated OPFRs, while triphenyl phosphate (TPHP) and tris(2‑butoxyethyl) phosphate (TBOEP) were the dominant non-chlorinated OPFRs. The daily intakes of ∑OPFR were estimated, with the median values for female students (2.45 ng/kg-day) higher than those for male students (2.15 ng/kg-day) while were similar to adults (2.45 ng/kg-day) in homes. The estimated daily intakes (EDI) of these OPFRs from indoor dust in Harbin were all below the recommended values. The calculated non-carcinogenic hazard quotients (10-8-10-3) from OPFRs were much lower than the theoretical risk threshold. Meanwhile, carcinogenic risk (CR) of tri‑n‑butyl phosphate (TNBP), TCEP, tris(2‑ethylhexyl) phosphate (TEHP), and tris(1,3‑dichloroisopropyl) phosphate (TDCIPP) were also estimated. The highest carcinogenic risk of TCEP for gender-specific and age-specific category range from 1.75 × 10-7 to 2.46 × 10-7 from exposure to indoor dust indicated a low potential carcinogenic risk for human exposure.",The effects of multiyear and seasonal weather factors on incidence of Lyme disease and its vector in New York State.,https://www.ncbi.nlm.nih.gov/pubmed/30893749,The Science of the total environment,2019 04 16,"More frequent extreme weather and warmer weather due to climate change might change the spatiotemporal distributions of vector-borne diseases, including Lyme disease.

These assessments are often limited by data, however, a gap with tremendous potential to be filled through Earth observations (EO), which produce a variety of data across spatial and temporal extents and resolutions. Despite widespread recognition of this potential, in practice few ecosystem service studies use EO. Here, we identify challenges and opportunities to using EO in ecosystem service modeling and assessment. Some challenges are technical, related to data awareness, processing, and access. These challenges require systematic investment in model platforms and data management. Other challenges are more conceptual but still systemic; they are byproducts of the structure of existing ecosystem service models and addressing them requires scientific investment in solutions and tools applicable to a wide range of models and approaches. We also highlight new ways in which EO can be leveraged for ecosystem service assessments, identifying promising new areas of research. More widespread use of EO for ecosystem service assessment will only be achieved if all of these types of challenges are addressed. This will require non-traditional funding and partnering opportunities from private and public agencies to promote data exploration, sharing, and archiving. Investing in this integration will be reflected in better and more accurate ecosystem service assessments worldwide.",Phylogenetically informed spatial planning as a tool to prioritise areas for threatened plant conservation within a Mediterranean biodiversity hotspot.,https://www.ncbi.nlm.nih.gov/pubmed/30893736,The Science of the total environment,2019 04 16,"Global plant diversity is at risk due to anthropogenic changes to ecosystems, but given severely limited conservation resources, a reliable prioritisation strategy for species and sites is needed. Our objective was to identify key areas for conserving the phylogenetic diversity (PD) of threatened vascular plants in Italy, one of the most species-rich regions in the Mediterranean Basin. We used spatial data and the conservation status of 995 threatened vascular plants and applied a phylogenetically informed spatial planning to minimize conservation costs. We then determined the degree of overlap with existing protected areas and evaluated whether this PD-based prioritisation of areas provides adequate protection for threatened phylogenetically distinctive species (EDGE). The cost-effective procedure identified as priority for conservation 12% of the study territory, while achieving over 90% of conservation targets (total PD). We showed that priority areas and protected areas are moderately spatially mismatched. We also showed that not all top-EDGE species were met by the procedure applied, hence we conclude that the PD-based model indicated key areas for protection, but nevertheless additional attention is needed to protect top-EDGE species. This study represents one of the most comprehensive analyses, to date, for the conservation of the native flora in the Mediterranean, incorporating both spatial distribution and evolutionary relationships. Our work on the prioritisation of threatened plant species across Italy can serve as a guide for future conservation applications.",Development of a novel aerosol generation system for conducting inhalation exposures to ambient particulate matter (PM).,https://www.ncbi.nlm.nih.gov/pubmed/30893735,The Science of the total environment,2019 04 16,"In this study, we developed a novel method for generating aerosols that are representative of real-world ambient particulate matter (PM) in terms of both physical and chemical characteristics, with the ultimate objective of using them for inhalation exposure studies. The protocol included collection of ambient PM on filters using a high-volume sampler, which were then extracted with ultrapure Milli-Q water using vortexing and sonication. As an alternative approach for collection, ambient particles were directly captured into aqueous slurry samples using the versatile aerosol concentration enrichment system (VACES)/aerosol-into-liquid collector tandem technology. The aqueous samples from both collection protocols were then re-aerosolized using commercially available nebulizers. The physical characteristics (i.e., particle size distribution) of the generated aerosols were examined by the means of a scanning mobility particle sizer (SMPS) connected to a condensation particle counter (CPC) at different compressed air pressures of the nebulizer, and dilution air flow rates. In addition, the collected PM samples (both ambient and re-aerosolized) were chemically analyzed for water-soluble organic carbon (WSOC), elemental and organic carbon (EC/OC), inorganic ions, polycyclic aromatic hydrocarbons (PAHs), and metals and trace elements. Using the aqueous filter extracts, we were able to effectively recover the water-soluble components of ambient PM (e.g., water-soluble organic matter, and water-soluble inorganic ions); however, this method was deficient in recovering some of the important insoluble components such as EC, PAHs, and many of the redox-active trace elements and metals. In contrast, using the VACES/aerosol-into-liquid collector tandem technology for collecting ambient PM directly into water slurry, we were able to preserve the water-soluble and water-insoluble components very effectively. These results illustrate the superiority of the VACES/aerosol-into liquid collector tandem technology to be used in conjunction with the re-aerosolization setup to create aerosols that fully represent ambient PM, making it an attractive choice for application in inhalation exposure studies.","Occurrence and health risk of perfluoroalkyl acids (PFAAs) in seafood from Yellow Sea, China.",https://www.ncbi.nlm.nih.gov/pubmed/30893734,The Science of the total environment,2019 04 16,"PFAAs have emerged as persistent organic pollutants (POPs) in a variety of environmental matrixes and biota, posing potential hazards for wildlife and humans. Diet has been considered as an important source for human exposure to PFAAs and seafood accounts for a relatively large proportion in human diets, especially for coastal residents. In an effort to clarify the impact of PFAAs in seafood on human health, 17 PFAAs were determined in 42 pooled seafood samples (14 species) from the Yellow Sea areas, China. The concentrations of total PFAAs (sum of 17 PFAAs, ∑PFAAs) were in the range of 1.10-1067 ng/g dry weight (dw), with the highest concentration found in swimming crab (Portunus trituberculatus) and the lowest in silvery pomfret (Pampus argenteus). Concentrations and composition profiles of PFAAs varied significantly among different species, suggesting that bioaccumulation potential of PFAAs differed from species to species. The distinct spatial distribution of PFAAs in four categories of seafood could be mainly attributed to the contamination patterns of PFAAs in three nearby cities. PFBA was presented as the most abundant PFAA in this study, which was different from the findings in many other studies where PFOS was the predominant compound. Furthermore, the human health risk assessment suggested that a comprehensive action plan is needed to protect people from high exposure to PFAAs through seafood consumption.","Carbon emissions, energy consumption and economic growth: Evidence from the agricultural sector of China's main grain-producing areas.",https://www.ncbi.nlm.nih.gov/pubmed/30893733,The Science of the total environment,2019 03 22,"China is currently the world's largest carbon emitter. As a large agricultural country, understanding the relationship between carbon emissions, economic growth and energy consumption in the agricultural sector can contribute to achieving the sustainable development of agriculture. Hence, this paper aims to investigate the relationship between carbon emissions, energy consumption and economic growth in the agricultural sector using a time series of data from China's main grain-producing areas during the period between 1996 and 2015. We first estimate the agricultural carbon emissions. And then based on the estimated results, we employ the autoregressive distributed lag (ARDL) model, the Granger causality test based on the vector error correction model (VECM), and impulse response and variance decomposition to test the relationship between carbon emissions, energy consumption and economic growth in the agricultural sector. The estimated results support the environmental Kuznets curve (EKC) hypothesis for agricultural carbon emissions in China's main grain-producing areas. Furthermore, agricultural energy consumption has both the short-run and the long-run negative impacts on agricultural carbon emissions. In addition, we find that there is a bidirectional causality between agricultural carbon emissions and agricultural economic growth in both the short-run and the long-run, and the unidirectional causalities are found to exist from agricultural energy consumption to agricultural carbon emissions and agricultural economic growth. Finally, several policy recommendations are offered to promote the sustainable development of agriculture in China's main grain-producing areas.",Regional and seasonal variations of outdoor thermal comfort in China from 1966 to 2016.,https://www.ncbi.nlm.nih.gov/pubmed/30893732,The Science of the total environment,2019 03 22,"The optimized design of outdoor environment is of utmost importance due to its impact on human health, urban livability and energy consumption inside buildings. The outdoor thermal comfort and its spatiotemporal variations were assessed using Universal Thermal Climate Index (UTCI). Annual and seasonal UTCI were calculated using the daily dataset collected from 591 stations in China between 1966 and 2016. A REOF-cluster-EOF hybrid model was developed to optimize regionalization and assess regional-scale variations for UTCI. The results showed the following: (1) UTCI values decreased due to the increase of the latitude in China except for the Qinghai-Tibet Plateau. 69.5% of the total area of China experienced ""no thermal stress"" conditions in summer, whereas it was only 7.7% in winter. Additionally, the outdoor environment in summer had a wider ""thermal comfort zone"" than that in other seasons. (2) China was divided into a small number of regions with coherent UTCI changes using REOF analysis and K-means clustering algorithm. Eight homogeneous regions were obtained for annual UTCI. From spring to winter, the numbers of homogeneous regions were eight, nine, ten and seven, respectively. (3) Using EOF analysis, dominant patterns of UTCI in each region were extracted by the first two EOF modes, which accounted for >60% of the total variance. In the first mode, the significant upward trends of UTCI were detected in each region, suggesting the stronger outdoor heat stress. In the second mode, UTCI showed fluctuation between the cold and warm periods with different turning points between regions. Overall, the outdoor thermal comfort seemed to be improved more in high-latitude regions than that in low-latitude regions.",[An epidemiologic study of pelvic organ prolapse in urban Chinese women: a population-based sample in China].,https://www.ncbi.nlm.nih.gov/pubmed/30893731,Zhonghua yi xue za zhi,2019 04 23,"Objective: This study aimed to assess the prevalence and factors associated with pelvic organ prolapse (POP) in a representative sample of Chinese urban women. Methods: A total of 29613 Chinese urban women were recruited to this cross-sectional study between February 2014 and March 2016. The prevalence of POP, defined as any stage Ⅱ or higher POP resulting in symptoms, was assessed using questionnaires and physical examinations. Multivariable logistic regression was used to assess factors associated with POP. Results: 2 864 of 29 613 women (9.67%) had POP. The prevalence of POP increased with age ranging from 1.23% (82/6 646) of women aged between 20 and 29 years to 26.11% (727/2 784) for those aged 70 years or older (P<0.000 1). Overweight and obese women were more likely to have POP than normal weight women [AOR=1.56, 95%CI 1.42-1.72 vs AOR=1.74, 95%CI 1.48-2.03]. In the multivariate analysis, the independent risk factors were cough (AOR=1.70, 95%CI 1.44-2.02), constipation (AOR=2.05, 95%CI 1.82-2.32), physical disease (AOR=1.27, 95%CI 1.15-1.41), and gynecological diseases (AOR=2.08, 95%CI 1.89-2.29). Nulliparous (AOR=0.12, 95%CI 0.06-0.22) and caesarean section (CS) (AOR=0.55, 95%CI 0.47-0.64) were protective factors for POP. Conclusions: POP affects nearly 10% of women in Chinese urban region. The prevalence of POP increases significantly with age. The independent risk factors for POP are body mass index, cough, constipation, physical disease and gynecological diseases. Nulliparous and CS are protective factors for POP.","[Influence of low dose perfluorooctanoate acid exposure to the cell proliferation, migration and invasion of the human muscle rhabdomyosarcoma cell line].",https://www.ncbi.nlm.nih.gov/pubmed/30893730,Zhonghua yi xue za zhi,2019 04 23,"Objective: This study aimed to explore the effect of perfluorooctanoate acid (PFOA) on the proliferation, migration and invasion of the human muscle rhabdomyosarcoma RD cell line and its related mechanisms. Methods: RD cells were cultured and exposed to PFOA of different concentrations with 6-72 hours. The cell viability was assessed by cell counting kit-8 (CCK-8) assay. Wound healing and transwell filter assay were used to evaluated the migration and invasion ability of the RD cells respectively. The cell cycles were detected by Flow cytometry. Quantitative real-time PCR and Western blot were used to quantify the mRNA and protein expression difference of related genes, respectively. Results: CCK-8 assay showed that, after treated the RD cell with different dose of PFOA for 72 h, low dose PFOA (1,10,50, 100 μmol/L) promotes the proliferation of RD cells while high dose PFOA (250, 500 mol/L) inhibits the proliferation (P<0.001). Flow cytometry showed that compared with the control group, there was no significant difference in G0/G1 phase, while cells in S phase deceased and G2/M phase cells increased after treated with PFOA (50 μmol/L) for 72 h. The relative proportions of S and G2/M were significantly different between the two groups (P<0.01). The results of qPCR showed that the mRNA relative expression of CDK2 of the control group and the PFOA (50 μmol/L) group were 0.97±0.07 and 2.64±0.11 respectively, and there was a significant difference (t=12.60, P<0.001); The mRNA relative expression of cyclin E2 of the control group and the PFOA (50 μmol/L) group were 1.33±0.17 and 3.35±0.22 respectively, and there was a significant difference (t=7.42, P<0.001); The results of Western blot showed that the protein relative expression of CDK2 of the control group and the PFOA (50 μmol/L) group were 0.35±0.01 and 0.84±0.03 respectively, and there was a significant difference (t=14.60, P<0.001); The protein relative expression of cyclin E2 of the control group and the PFOA (50 μmol/L) group were 0.67±0.04 and 0.86±0.01 respectively, and there was a significant difference (t=4.88, P<0.01); There was no significant difference in the mRNA and protein expression of p21 and p53 between the PFOA and control group (P>0.05). The wound healing rate of the PFOA (50 μmol/L) group was faster than that of the control group, and the relative migration area of the PFOA group was larger accordingly (P<0.001). After PFOA (50 μmol/L) treated, the number of the cell through the membranes was much more than the control group (t=54.40, P<0.001), which means PFOA significantly stimulated the invasion ability of the RD cells. The results of qPCR showed that the mRNA relative expression of vimentin of the control group and the PFOA (50 μmol/L) group were 0.71±0.03 and 2.53±0.16 respectively, and there was a significant difference (t=11.00, P<0.001); The mRNA relative expression of MMP2 of the control group and the PFOA (50 μmol/L) group were 1.09±0.04 and 10.73±1.20 respectively, and there was a significant difference (t=8.04, P<0.001).

The protein relative expression of cyclin E2 of the control group and the PFOA (50 μmol/L) group were 0.64±0.04 and 1.03±0.13 respectively, and there was a significant difference (t=2.94, P<0.05). Conclusions: Low dose PFOA (50 μmol/L) exposure promotes cell proliferation, migration and invasion in the human muscle rhabdomyosarcoma cell line through inducing the expressions of MMP2, vimentin and cell cycle related genes.",[Impact of hypoxia-reoxygenation environment on autophagy level of osteoblasts].,https://www.ncbi.nlm.nih.gov/pubmed/30893729,Zhonghua yi xue za zhi,2019 04 23,"Objective: To investigate the impact of hypoxia-reoxygenation environment on the level of autophagy in osteoblasts. Methods: Osteoblasts were purified from the skulls of newborn SD rats within 24-48 hours by tissue block adherence culture and differential centrifugation. The osteoblasts were identified by alizarin red staining and alkaline phosphatase staining. The third generation osteoblasts were cultured in normal state and randomly divided into four groups: group A was cultured under normal condition for 36 hours; group B was cultured under normal condition for 18 hours, then under hypoxia for 18 hours; group C was cultured under hypoxia for 36 hours; group D was cultured under hypoxia for 18 hours, and then under normal condition for 18 hours. The ability to form calcium nodules of osteoblasts in the four groups was observed after culture. The proliferation activity of osteoblasts was detected by CCK-8 assay. The expressions of autophagy specified gene Beclin 1, microtubule-associated protein light chain 3(LC3) and collagen Ⅰ(COL-Ⅰ), bone morphogenetic protein 2 (BMP-2) genes were detected by real time polymerase chain reaction (RT-PCR), and the protein expressions of Beclin 1, LC3-Ⅰ,LC3-Ⅱ and P62 were detected by immunoblotting. Results: Alizarin red staining showed that osteoblasts in group A had the strongest calcification ability, and calcification ability of osteoblasts in group B,C and D lowered gradually, and it was lowest in group D. The proliferative activity under the CCK-8 detection in group A, B, C and D was 98%±8%, 90%±8%,82%±9%,76%±8%, respectively (F=35.764, P=0.000).

Zeitschrift fur Augenheilkunde,2019 03 28,"We aimed to correlate the visual function and structural characteristics of the retina and choroid in advanced retinitis pigmentosa (RP) patients. A cross-sectional, retrospective review was conducted of medical records of 149 RP patients who reported visual field constriction on a central 30-2 Humphrey visual field chart. Using spectral domain-optical coherence tomography, central foveal thickness (CFT), ellipsoid zone (EZ) length, macular volume (MV), and submacular choroidal thickness (SMChT) were measured. A control cohort (68 eyes of 68 patients) was included for comparing the macular structure. Quantitative correlations between visual function indices [visual field index (VFI) and best-corrected visual acuity (BCVA)] and structural indices (CFT, EZ length, and SMChT) were evaluated. Mean age was 46.3 ± 15.5 years; mean illness duration was 60.7 ± 60.0 months. SMChT was thinner than that in normal controls. Per Pearson's correlation, BCVA and VFI exhibited a progressive worsening related to age and disease duration. In multivariate linear regression, BCVA and VFI were significantly correlated with CFT, EZ length, and MV at the central 1-mm area. Among RP patients with visual field constriction within 30°, VFI and BCVA closely correlate with the degree of retinal structural change, including the CFT, EZ length, and MV.

Condensed matter : an Institute of Physics journal,2019 04 25,"Previous luminescence and absorption experiments in Co-doped ZnO revealed two ionization and one intrashell transition of [Formula: see text] electrons. Those optical properties are analyzed within the generalized gradient approximation to the density functional theory. The two ionization channels involve electron excitations from the two [Formula: see text] gap states, the [Formula: see text] triplet and the [Formula: see text] doublet, to the conduction band. The third possible ionization channel, in which an electron is excited from the valence band to the [Formula: see text] level, requires energy in excess of 4 eV, and cannot lead to absorption below the ZnO band gap, contrary to earlier suggestions. We also consider two recombination channels, the direct recombination and a two-step process, in which a photoelectron is captured by [Formula: see text] and then recombines via the internal transition. Finally, the observed increase the band gap with the Co concentration is well reproduced by theory. The accurate description of ZnO:Co is achieved after including  +U corrections to the relevant orbitals of Zn, O, and Co. The [Formula: see text] value was calculated by the linear response approach, and independently was obtained by fitting the calculated transition energies to the optical data. The respective values, 3.4 and 3.0 eV, agree well. Ionization of Co induces large energy shifts of the gap levels, driven by the varying Coulomb coupling between the [Formula: see text] electrons, and by large lattice relaxations around Co ions. In turn, over  ∼1 eV changes of [Formula: see text] levels induced by the internal transition are mainly caused by the occupation-dependent [Formula: see text] corrections.","A stealth emulsion based on natural rubber latex, core-shell ferrofluid/carbon black in the S and X bands.",https://www.ncbi.nlm.nih.gov/pubmed/30893663,Nanotechnology,2019 05 07,"A lossy dielectric with an appropriate magnetic property is one of the requirements of a stealth material. The thickness of the absorber and the corresponding bandwidth of absorption are also other deciding factors that determine the choice of the material as microwave absorbers. A stable emulsion, which is lossy as well as magnetic, is promising, since it can be coated on surfaces with required thickness in the desired band. A magnetic nanofluidic emulsion serves the purpose. A microwave absorbing emulsion based on natural rubber latex with core-shell magnetic nanoparticles, based on superparamagnetic iron oxide nanoparticles (SPIONs), was developed. The effect of additives like carbon black on the bandwidth of absorption was also studied as a function of weight percentage of carbon black. The complex dielectric permittivity and magnetic permeability were evaluated using a vector network analyser in the S and X bands. Furthermore, these results were modelled using surface impedance equations. These investigations revealed that the incorporation of carbon black enhances the bandwidth of absorption and an emulsion with the required dielectric permittivity and magnetic permeability can be tailored for stealth applications.","Theoretical modelling of exciton binding energy, steady-state and transient optical response of GaN/InGaN/GaN and AlGaN/GaN/AlGaN core-shell nanostructures.",https://www.ncbi.nlm.nih.gov/pubmed/30893662,Nanotechnology,2019 04 17,"Here, we present an efficient 1D model to describe carrier confinement in GaN/InGaN/GaN and AlGaN/GaN/AlGaN core-shell nanostructures (CSNs) within the effective mass framework. A self-consistent procedure combined with hydrogenic model is implemented to estimate exciton binding energy in these CSNs, as a function of CSN dimensions, polarization charge and alloy composition. A 3-fold higher exciton binding energy in these CSNs than that in planar counterparts is attributed to an increased electron-hole overlap. The trend exhibited by the exciton binding energy with polarization charge and alloy composition in the two types of CSNs is significantly different, owing to a drastic difference in the piezoelectric polarizations. A detailed investigation of the steady-state and transient optical response from these CSNs suggests that GaN/InGaN/GaN CSNs emit a wide spectrum. However, that is not the case with AlGaN/GaN/AlGaN CSNs owing to a relatively weaker quantum confined Stark effect.

Different types of patterns-bumps, cracked bumps, and trenches-were obtained and characterized using four shape descriptors-pattern width, pattern height, cut width and cut depth. With an increase in write bias the obtained pattern type varied from bumps to cracked bumps to trenches. The use of a bias above 7.25 V resulted in trenches with increased variability in shape descriptor values. Similarly, an increase in write speed demonstrated a transition from trenches to cracked bumps to bumps. An increase in write force from 75 to 150 nN showed a shift in the threshold voltage from 4.25 V to just under 3.75 V and formed cracked bumps instead of bumps. These findings help solve the mystery of why bumps were not reported at threshold voltages before 2008.

Beam gating, where irradiation only occurs in certain breathing phases in which the gating conditions are fulfilled, may be an option to reduce the interplay effect between tumor motion and the scanning beam. This study aims to, first, determine suitable gating windows with respect to effectiveness (low interplay effect) and efficiency (high duty cycles). Second, it investigates whether beam gating allows for a better mitigation of the interplay effect along the treatment course than free-breathing irradiations. Based on synthetic 4D-CTs, generated by warping 3D-CTs with vector fields extracted from time-resolved magnetic resonance imaging (4D-MRI) for 8 pancreatic cancer patients, 4D dose calculations (4DDC) were performed to analyze the duty cycle and homogeneity index HI  =  d5/d95 for four different gating scenarios. These were based on either fixed threshold values of CTV (clinical target volume) mean or maximum motion amplitudes (5 mm), relative CTV motion amplitudes (30%) or CTV overlap criteria (95%), respectively. 4DDC for 28-fractions treatment courses were performed with fixed and variable initial breathing phases to investigate the fractionation-induced mitigation of the interplay effect. Gating criteria, based on patient-specific relative 30% CTV motion amplitudes, showed the significantly best HI values with sufficient duty cycles, in contrast to inferior results by either fixed gating thresholds or overlap criteria. For gated treatments with 28 fractions, less fractionation-induced mitigation of the interplay effect was observed for gating criteria with gating windows  ⩾30%, compared to free-breathing treatments. The gating effectiveness for multiple fractions was improved by allowing a variable initial breathing phase. Gating with relative amplitude thresholds are effective for proton therapy of pancreatic cancer. By combining beam gating with variable initial breathing phases, a pronounced mitigation of the interplay effect by fractionation can be achieved.",Intercrystal scatter studies for a 1 mm3 resolution clinical PET system prototype.,https://www.ncbi.nlm.nih.gov/pubmed/30893659,Physics in medicine and biology,2019 05 03,"Positron emission tomography (PET) systems designed with multiplexed readout do not usually have the capability to resolve individual intercrystal scatter (ICS) interactions, leading to interaction mispositioning that degrades spatial resolution and contrast.

Incorporating ICS events increases photon sensitivity by 51.5% compared to using only photoelectric events. A Compton scatter angle error minimization algorithm is used to estimate the first ICS interaction location for accurate line-of-response pairing of coincident photons. An optimal scatter angle error threshold of 15 degrees is used to discard ICS events with a high mismatch between energy-derived and position-derived intercrystal scatter angles. Finally, positioning rather than rejecting ICS events boosts peak contrast to noise ratio by 8.1%, and allows for an equivalent dose reduction of 12% while maintaining equivalent image quality.",Magnetostructural behavior in the non-centrosymmetric compound Nd7Pd3.,https://www.ncbi.nlm.nih.gov/pubmed/30893658,Journal of physics.

Antiferromagnetic transition is observed at T N  =  37 K, which is followed by ferromagnetic transformation at T C  =  33 K. The first-order magnetic transition at T C is magnetoelastic: it involves a change of crystal symmetry from P63 mc to Cmc21 and leads to anisotropic changes of the unit cell parameters. While the antiferromagnetic structure is symmetry allowed in P63 mc, the ferromagnetic structure with magnetic moments along the a-direction of the original hexagonal unit cell induces the first order transition to Cmc21.

Condensed matter : an Institute of Physics journal,2019 05 09,"Room temperature optical absorption spectroscopy (OAS) and Raman spectroscopy measurements have been carried out in order to understand the effect of structural disorder on the electronic and phononic states. For this purpose, polycrystalline samples of Cr doped PrFeO3 have been prepared via wet chemical route. OAS analysis suggests the systematic scaling of electronic disorder with Cr doping; whereas, shifting in Raman line shapes and an increase in Raman line width has been observed with Cr doping. X-ray diffraction analysis clearly suggests the increase in structural disorders in the form of crystallographic strain with Cr doping, which is consistent with the broadening in Raman line shapes. The major contribution to Raman line width has been understood in terms of temperature independent terms i.e. structural disorder induced by doping. The generation of a new phonon mode at ~510 cm-1 has been observed and understood as a disorder phonon mode due to strain induced structural disorder. Moreover, a systematic correlation between crystallographic strain, Raman line width, disordered parameter (σ) and Urbach energy has been observed, which implies that structural disorder affects phononic as well as electronic states of the system.

MS-275, as a class I-specific histone deacetylase (HDAC) inhibitor, has also been reported to affect energy metabolism. In this current study, we investigated the effects of MS-275 on hepatic FGF21 expression in vitro and in vivo, and explored whether cAMP-responsive element-binding protein H（CREBH） was involved in the action of MS-275. Our results showed that MS-275 stimulated hepatic FGF21 mRNA and protein expressions in a dose- and time-dependent manner, as well as FGF21 secretion in primary mouse hepatocytes. Serum concentration and hepatic expression of FGF21 were elevated after injection of MS-275, along with increased expressions of genes involved in fatty acid oxidation and ketogenic production (Peroxisome proliferator-activated receptor gammacoactivator1α,PGC-1α; Carnitine palmitoyl-transferase 1a,CPT1a;3-hydroxy-3-methylglutaryl-CoA synthase 2,Hmgcs2) as well as improved blood lipid profile. As a proved transcription factor of FGF21, the expression of CREBH was initiated by MS-275, with increased Histone H3 Lysine 18 acetylation(H3K18ac) signals and hepatocyte nuclear factor 4 alpha (HNF-4α) recruitment in CREBH promoter. Adenovirus-mediated knockdown of CREBH abolished MS-275-induced hepatic FGF21 and lipid metabolism-related gene expressions.These results suggest that MS-275 induces hepatic FGF21 by H3K18ac-mediated CREBH expression.",Does stress echocardiography still have a role in the rapid access chest pain clinic post NICE CG95?,https://www.ncbi.nlm.nih.gov/pubmed/30893640,Echo research and practice,2019 04 26,The 2016 NICE clinical guideline 95 (CG95) demoted functional imaging to a second line test following computed tomography coronary angiography (CTCA).

Transthoracic echocardiography (TTE) revealed normal left ventricular size with impaired systolic function and severe MR. No MV prolapse was seen. The admitting doctor informed the patient that mitral valve surgery was the likely outcome. However, after senior review, the patient was commenced on rate-control, diuretic and anticoagulant medications. He was discharged and returned six weeks later for direct current cardioversion, which successfully restored sinus rhythm. TTE two months later showed normal LV function and trivial MR. This case highlights the importance of understanding the mechanism underlying MV dysfunction. The mitral annulus is a thin fibrofatty ring that geometrically resembles a parabola; its sphincteric contraction reduces MV annular area by ∼25% during the cardiac cycle, facilitating normal leaflet coaptation. Consequently, the onset of atrial flutter - and loss of annular contraction - resulted in MR and this was exacerbated by the rapid heart rate, which reduces the normal ventricular closing forces on the valve leading to incomplete mitral leaflet coaptation. Clinicians are reminded that atrial arrhythmias with high heart rates can disrupt normal MV function, producing MR which can be resolved by treating the underlying abnormality (i.e. atrial arrhythmia) and thus avoiding unnecessary cardiac surgery.",Comparison of indoor air quality during sleep in smokers and non-smokers' bedrooms: A preliminary study.,https://www.ncbi.nlm.nih.gov/pubmed/30893637,"Environmental pollution (Barking, Essex : 1987)",2019 05 22,"People spend one third of their life sleeping, but the bedroom, as a specific micro-environment, is often neglected when assessing human exposure to air pollutants. However, exposure during sleep may be significant in the long-term to the integrated individual exposure. This study aimed to assess the exposure during sleep, focusing on a multi-pollutant approach (comfort parameters, carbon dioxide - CO2, carbon monoxide - CO, formaldehyde (CH2O), total volatile organic compounds (VOCs), particulate matter - PM2.5 and PM10 - and ultrafine particles, particle number concentrations - PNC - and lung deposited surface area - LDSA). For that, the air quality during sleep (in real conditions) was monitored using real-time devices in 12 bedrooms of urban (Lisbon and Vila Franca de Xira) and rural (Ponte de Sor) areas of Portugal for one night. Volunteers were smokers and non-smokers. Considering the Portuguese legislation for indoor air quality (IAQ), 67% of the bedrooms registered CO2 levels above the limit value, while CH2O, VOC, PM10 and PM2.5 thresholds were exceeded in 30, 100, 36, and 45% of cases, respectively. Regarding ultrafine parameters, LDSA and PNC ranged from 7.3 to 95.2 μm2/cm3 and from 0.6 to 4.8 × 103/cm3, respectively. Even with no smoking indoors, smokers' bedrooms were found to have significant higher levels of CO, CH2O, PM2.5, PM10 and LDSA than non-smokers' bedrooms, showing the effect of thirdhand smoke, exhalation of pollutants after smoking and infiltration on the degradation of the air quality in the bedroom. A recent new model of real-time monitor was also used for a wide set of IAQ parameters. Its performance to measure PM2.5 and CO2 was assessed, showing its applicability in real conditions. Although often neglected, these micro-environments should be considered in the integrated individual exposure to air pollutants and further studied.

PPP residues have been found in various bee-related matrices, resulting in governmental bodies worldwide releasing guidance documents on methods for the assessment of the overall risk of PPPs to different bee species. An essential part of these risk assessments are PPP residues found in pollen and nectar, as they represent a key route of exposure. However, PPP residue values in these matrices exhibit large variations and are not available for many PPPs and crop species combinations, which results in inaccurate estimations and uncertainties in risk evaluation. Additionally, residue studies on pollen and nectar are expensive and practically challenging. An extrapolation between different cropping scenarios and PPPs is not yet justified, as the behaviour of PPPs in pollen and nectar is poorly understood. Therefore, this review aims to contribute to a better knowledge and understanding of the fate of PPP residues in pollen and nectar and to outline knowledge gaps and future research needs. The literature suggests that four primary factors, the crop type, the application method, the physicochemical properties of a compound and the environmental conditions have the greatest influence on PPP residues in pollen and nectar. However, these factors consist of many sub-factors and initial effects may be disguised by different sampling methodologies, impeding their exact characterisation. Moreover, knowledge about these factors is ambiguous and restricted to a few compounds and plant species. We propose that future research should concentrate on identifying relationships and common features amongst various PPP applications and crops, as well as an overall quantification of the described parameters; in order to enable a reliable estimation of PPP residues in pollen, nectar and other bee matrices.",Nutrient burial and environmental changes in the Yangtze Delta in response to recent river basin human activities.,https://www.ncbi.nlm.nih.gov/pubmed/30893635,"Environmental pollution (Barking, Essex : 1987)",2019 05 22,"High resolution sediment records in the Yangtze Delta front were constructed to reveal recent environmental changes in response to river basin human activities. Increases in nutrient and organic C influxes that began in the 1950s, together with elevated primary productivity and increased chemical fertilizer application, suggested a shift toward anthropogenic-predominated environmental changes during this period. The depletion of total organic C (TOC), total N (TN), and biogenic Si (BSi), along with the decline in sedimentation rate and coarsening of sediment coincided with the development of hydrological engineering in the river basin from the 1980s. Reservoir Si retention substantially altered river mouth primary productivity community composition from diatoms to non-diatoms, thereby changing the BSi/TOC molar ratio in the sediment profile. Estimation of biogenic component burial fluxes was conducted to assess the variation and potential impacts. A recent dramatic decline in biogenic component burial in the delta area suggested a low nutrient removal efficiency in this region, due to the decrease in sediment discharge. Consequently, more nutrients have been further transported to the inner shelf and open waters instead of being buried in the delta sediment, thereby increasing the environmental pressure in the Yangtze Delta and adjoining coastal area.","Multi-generational impacts of organic contaminated stream water on Daphnia magna: A combined proteomics, epigenetics and ecotoxicity approach.",https://www.ncbi.nlm.nih.gov/pubmed/30893634,"Environmental pollution (Barking, Essex : 1987)",2019 05 22,"The present study aimed to elucidate the mechanisms of organismal sensitivity and/or physiological adaptation in the contaminated water environment. Multigenerational cultures (F0, F1, F2) of Daphnia magna in collected stream water (OCSW), contaminated with high fecal coliform, altered the reproductive scenario (changes in first brood size timing, clutch numbers, clutch size etc.), compromised fitness (increase hemoglobin, alteration in behavior), and affected global DNA methylation (hypermethylation) without affecting survival. Using proteomics approach, we found 288 proteins in F0 and 139 proteins in F2 that were significantly differentially upregulated after OCSW exposure. The individual protein expressions, biological processes and molecular functions were mainly related to metabolic processes, development and reproduction, transport (protein/lipid/oxygen), antioxidant activity, increased globin and S-adenosylmethionine synthase protein level etc., which was further found to be connected to phenotype-dependent endpoints. The proteomics pathway analysis evoked proteasome, chaperone family proteins, neuronal disease pathways (such as, Parkinson's disease) and apoptosis signaling pathways in OCSW-F0, which might be the cause of behavioral and developmental alterations in OCSW-F0. Finally, chronic multigenerational exposure to OCSW exhibited slow physiological adaptation in most of the measured effects, including proteomics analysis, from the F0 to F2 generations. The common upregulated proteins in both generations (F0 & F2), such as, globin, vitellinogen, lipid transport proteins etc., were possibly play the pivotal role in the organism's physiological adaptation. Taken together, our results, obtained with a multilevel approach, provide new insight of the molecular mechanism in fecal coliform-induced phenotypic plasticity in Daphnia magna.",Apportionment of sources of heavy metals to agricultural soils using isotope fingerprints and multivariate statistical analyses.,https://www.ncbi.nlm.nih.gov/pubmed/30893633,"Environmental pollution (Barking, Essex : 1987)",2019 05 22,"Apportioning sources of environmental pollutants is key to controlling pollution. In this study, the sources of heavy metals to 234 agricultural soils from the Jianghan Plain (JHP) (∼22454 km2) in central China were discriminated between using Cd and Pb isotope compositions and multivariate statistical analyses. Concentrations of some metals in JHP soils (0.48 ± 0.2, 48.2 ± 15.9, 0.12 ± 0.23, 48.8 ± 16.4, 36.5 ± 9.8, and 96.8 ± 42.2 mg kg-1 for Cd, Cu, Hg, Ni, Pb, and Zn, respectively) were higher than background concentrations in Chinese soil. The Cd isotope compositions for the JHP soils (δ114/110Cd values -0.76‰ to -0.25‰) were similar to Cd isotope compositions found for smelter dust and incinerator fly ash, indicating Cd was supplied to the JHP soils by ore smelting and/or refining processes. The Pb isotope compositions for the JHP soils (206Pb/207Pb 1.182-1.195 and 208Pb/206Pb 2.078-2.124) were between the Pb isotope compositions found for Chinese coal and natural sources, which a binary isotope mixing model indicated contributed 52% and 48%, respectively, of the Pb in JHP soils. Cluster analysis and positive matrix factorization indicated that the sources of heavy metals in JHP soils may consist of smelting and/or refining activities, coal combustion, agricultural activities, and natural sources (including Han River sediment and soil parent materials). The isotope fingerprints and multivariate statistical analyses together indicated that coal combustion and smelting and/or refining activities were the main anthropogenic sources of heavy metals polluting JHP soils.",Chemotherapy Modulates Endocrine Therapy-Related Resistance Mutations in Metastatic Breast Cancer.,https://www.ncbi.nlm.nih.gov/pubmed/30893632,Translational oncology,2019 04 11,"Accumulation of PIK3CA, ESR1, and GATA3 mutations results in resistance to endocrine therapy in breast cancer patients; however, the response of these genes to chemotherapy is unclear.

The AsO4 substitution in natroalunite increased when the [AsO4/(AsO4 + SO4)]aq molar ratios of the initial aqueous solutions increased and the maximum substitution reached ~67% molar for the [AsO4/(AsO4 + SO4)]aq = 0.26. The XRD analysis confirmed that all hydrothermal synthetical solids for the [AsO4/(AsO4 + SO4)]aq ≤ 0.26 were characteristic of natroalunite-type phases. The AsO4 substitution in the natroalunites increased the c lattice parameters, owing to the difference between the SO distance and the AsO distance in the crystal structures. For the [AsO4/(AsO4 + SO4)]aq = 0.28 at 200 °C and pH of 4, a mixture of natroalunite, amorphous arsenate phase and Na2SO4 was formed. The crystals of the arsenate-substituted natroalunites were regular ditrigonal scalenohedron (pseudo-octahedron). The Raman spectra were characterized by two bands centered upon 899-917 cm-1 and 981-997 cm-1, which represented the symmetric stretching vibration v1(AsO4) and the antisymmetric stretching vibration v3(AsO4), respectively. The infrared bands around 868-897 cm-1 were assigned to the symmetric stretching vibration v1(AsO4). The thermal decomposition of the arsenate-substituted natroalunites showed three separated endothermic steps, namely the loss of H3O+, the loss of OH- and the loss of SO3 + (As2O3 + O2). The solubility products [Ksp] and the Gibbs free energies of formation [ΔGfo] for the arsenate-substituted natroalunites decreased from 10-81.21 to 10-109.16 and from -4714.49 kJ/mol to -5352.95 kJ/mol with the increase of the AsO4 substitution from 0% to 67%, respectively."

With the growing accumulation of microplastics in soils, a better understanding of the impact of microplastics on soil physical properties is crucial to conserve and manage soil quality. This study explored the effects of polyester microfiber (PMF) concentrations (0, 0.1% and 0.3%) on bulk density, porosity, aggregation and hydraulic conductivity of a clayey soil from a field experiment (1 year) and a pot experiment (6 wet-dry cycles). Polyester microfibers significantly increased the volume of >30 μm pores and reduced the volume of <30 μm pores compared to the control treatment. However, there were no detectable changes in the soil bulk density and saturated hydraulic conductivity between the PMF treatments and the control treatment. Interestingly, we observed that polyester microfibers significantly increased the contents of water stable large macroaggregates (>2 mm) in the 0.3% PMF (44%) and 0.1% PMF (39%) treatments compared to the control treatment (31%) in the pot experiment, but this was not true in the field experiment. The efficient interaction between polyester microfibers and fine soil particles and the frequent wet-dry cycles enhanced the formation and stability of macro-aggregates induced by polyester microfibers in the pot experiment. Overall, our results provide valuable evidence for microplastic influences on soil physical properties. Because microplastics are long-term anthropogenic contaminants, it is necessary to further study the impacts of microplastics on soil quality for terrestrial ecosystem sustainability.",Dependency of the Cancer-Specific Transcriptional Regulation Circuitry on the Promoter DNA Methylome.,https://www.ncbi.nlm.nih.gov/pubmed/30893615,Cell reports,2019 03 20,"Dynamic dysregulation of the promoter DNA methylome is a signature of cancer. However, comprehensive understandings about how the DNA methylome is incorporated in the transcriptional regulation circuitry and involved in regulating the gene expression abnormality in cancers are still missing. We introduce an integrative analysis pipeline based on mutual information theory and tailored for the multi-omics profiling data in The Cancer Genome Atlas (TCGA) to systematically find dependencies of transcriptional regulation circuits on promoter CpG methylation profiles for each of 21 cancer types. By coupling transcription factors with CpG sites, this cancer type-specific transcriptional regulation circuitry recovers a significant layer of expression regulation for many cancer-related genes. The coupled CpG sites and transcription factors also serve as markers for classifications of cancer subtypes with different prognoses, suggesting physiological relevance of such regulation machinery recapitulated here. Our results therefore generate a resource for further studies of the epigenetic scheme in gene expression dysregulations in cancers.",Expanded Expression Landscape and Prioritization of Circular RNAs in Mammals.,https://www.ncbi.nlm.nih.gov/pubmed/30893614,Cell reports,2019 03 20,"Circular RNAs (circRNAs) are emerging as essential regulators of various biological and disease processes. To comprehensively understand the diversity of circRNAs and prioritize their importance, we present a large-scale study of circRNA repertoires from multiple tissues from human, macaque, and mouse. We discovered totals of 104,388, 96,675, and 82,321 circRNAs from the three species, respectively, with an average of 72.6% being successfully assembled into full-length transcripts for each species. Using these full-length circRNAs, we identified thousands of evolutionarily conserved circRNAs that were valuable for functional screening and prioritization. By constructing both species-specific and conserved gene co-expression networks, we inferred circRNA functions on a global scale and prioritized promising functional candidates. To illustrate how well-established prior knowledge facilitates to screen functional candidates, we used the circRNA co-expression networks to prioritize circRNAs that may be involved in liver tumorigenesis and experimentally validated their functions.",Multi-dimensional Transcriptional Remodeling by Physiological Insulin In Vivo.,https://www.ncbi.nlm.nih.gov/pubmed/30893613,Cell reports,2019 06 10,"Regulation of gene expression is an important aspect of insulin action but in vivo is intertwined with changing levels of glucose and counter-regulatory hormones. Here we demonstrate that under euglycemic clamp conditions, physiological levels of insulin regulate interrelated networks of more than 1,000 transcripts in muscle and liver. These include expected pathways related to glucose and lipid utilization, mitochondrial function, and autophagy, as well as unexpected pathways, such as chromatin remodeling, mRNA splicing, and Notch signaling. These acutely regulated pathways extend beyond those dysregulated in mice with chronic insulin deficiency or insulin resistance and involve a broad network of transcription factors. More than 150 non-coding RNAs were regulated by insulin, many of which also responded to fasting and refeeding. Pathway analysis and RNAi knockdown revealed a role for lncRNA Gm15441 in regulating fatty acid oxidation in hepatocytes. Altogether, these changes in coding and non-coding RNAs provide an integrated transcriptional network underlying the complexity of insulin action.",Oxidative Stress Triggers Selective tRNA Retrograde Transport in Human Cells during the Integrated Stress Response.,https://www.ncbi.nlm.nih.gov/pubmed/30893612,Cell reports,2019 04 03,"In eukaryotes, tRNAs are transcribed in the nucleus and exported to the cytosol, where they deliver amino acids to ribosomes for protein translation. This nuclear-cytoplasmic movement was believed to be unidirectional. However, active shuttling of tRNAs, named tRNA retrograde transport, between the cytosol and nucleus has been discovered. This pathway is conserved in eukaryotes, suggesting a fundamental function; however, little is known about its role in human cells. Here we report that, in human cells, oxidative stress triggers tRNA retrograde transport, which is rapid, reversible, and selective for certain tRNA species, mostly with shorter 3' ends. Retrograde transport of tRNASeC, which promotes translation of selenoproteins required to maintain homeostatic redox levels in cells, is highly efficient. tRNA retrograde transport is regulated by the integrated stress response pathway via the PERK-REDD1-mTOR axis. Thus, we propose that tRNA retrograde transport is part of the cellular response to oxidative stress.",Sequential Ubiquitination of Ribosomal Protein uS3 Triggers the Degradation of Non-functional 18S rRNA.,https://www.ncbi.nlm.nih.gov/pubmed/30893611,Cell reports,2019 03 20,"18S non-functional rRNA decay (NRD) eliminates non-functional 18S rRNA with deleterious mutations in the decoding center. Dissociation of the non-functional 80S ribosome into 40S and 60S subunits is a prerequisite step for degradation of the non-functional 18S rRNA. However, the mechanisms by which the non-functional ribosome is recognized and dissociated into subunits remain elusive. Here, we report that the sequential ubiquitination of non-functional ribosomes is crucial for subunit dissociation. 18S NRD requires Mag2-mediated monoubiquitination followed by Hel2- and Rsp5-mediated K63-linked polyubiquitination of uS3 at the 212th lysine residue. Determination of the aberrant 18S rRNA levels in sucrose gradient fractions revealed that the subunit dissociation of stalled ribosomes requires sequential ubiquitination of uS3 by E3 ligases and ATPase activity of Slh1 (Rqt2), as well as Asc1 and Dom34. We propose that sequential uS3 ubiquitination of the non-functional 80S ribosome induces subunit dissociation by Slh1, leading to degradation of the non-functional 18S rRNA.",Alterations in Phosphorylation of Hepatocyte Ribosomal Protein S6 Control Plasmodium Liver Stage Infection.,https://www.ncbi.nlm.nih.gov/pubmed/30893610,Cell reports,2019 04 06,"Plasmodium parasites are highly selective when infecting hepatocytes and induce many changes within the host cell upon infection.

Here, we describe a role for phosphorylated ribosomal protein S6 (Ser235/236) (p-RPS6) in Plasmodium yoelii-infected hepatocytes. Blocking RPS6 phosphorylation prior to infection decreases the number of liver stage parasites within 24 h. Infected hepatocytes exhibit elevated levels of p-RPS6 while simultaneously abrogating the induction of phosphorylation of RPS6 in response to insulin stimulation. This is in contrast with the regulation of p-RPS6 by Toxoplasma gondii, which elevates levels of p-RPS6 after infection but does not alter the response to insulin. Our data support a model in which RPS6 phosphorylation is uncoupled from canonical regulators in Plasmodium-infected hepatocytes and is relied on by the parasite to maintain infection."

Peri-sinusoidal stromal (PSS) cells are the main source of IL-7, but their characterization as a pro-B cell niche remains limited. Here, we characterize pro-B cell supporting stromal cells and decipher the interaction network allowing pro-B cell retention. Preferential contacts are found between pro-B cells and PSS cells, which homogeneously express HSC and B cell niche genes. Furthermore, pro-B cells are frequently located in the vicinity of HSCs in the same niche. Using an interactome bioinformatics pipeline, we identify Nidogen-1 as essential for pro-B cell retention in the peri-sinusoidal niche as confirmed in Nidogen-1-/- mice. Finally, human pro-B cells and hematopoietic progenitors are observed close to similar IL-7+ stromal cells.

Enhanced tryptophan metabolism toward the kynurenine pathway has been associated with myelodysplastic syndromes (MDSs), which are preleukemic clonal diseases characterized by dysplastic bone marrow and cytopenias. Here, we reveal a fundamental role for tryptophan metabolized along the serotonin pathway in normal erythropoiesis and in the physiopathology of MDS-related anemia. We identify, both in human and murine erythroid progenitors, a functional cell-autonomous serotonergic network with pro-survival and proliferative functions. In vivo studies demonstrate that pharmacological increase of serotonin levels using fluoxetine, a common antidepressant, has the potential to become an important therapeutic strategy in low-risk MDS anemia refractory to erythropoietin.",In Vivo Generation of Post-infarct Human Cardiac Muscle by Laminin-Promoted Cardiovascular Progenitors.,https://www.ncbi.nlm.nih.gov/pubmed/30893597,Cell reports,2019 03 20,"Regeneration of injured human heart muscle is limited and an unmet clinical need. There are no methods for the reproducible generation of clinical-quality stem cell-derived cardiovascular progenitors (CVPs). We identified laminin-221 (LN-221) as the most likely expressed cardiac laminin. We produced it as human recombinant protein and showed that LN-221 promotes differentiation of pluripotent human embryonic stem cells (hESCs) toward cardiomyocyte lineage and downregulates pluripotency and teratoma-associated genes. We developed a chemically defined, xeno-free laminin-based differentiation protocol to generate CVPs. We show high reproducibility of the differentiation protocol using time-course bulk RNA sequencing developed from different hESC lines. Single-cell RNA sequencing of CVPs derived from hESC lines supported reproducibility and identified three main progenitor subpopulations. These CVPs were transplanted into myocardial infarction mice, where heart function was measured by echocardiogram and human heart muscle bundle formation was identified histologically. This method may provide clinical-quality cells for use in regenerative cardiology.",Prolyl Isomerase Pin1 Suppresses Thermogenic Programs in Adipocytes by Promoting Degradation of Transcriptional Co-activator PRDM16.,https://www.ncbi.nlm.nih.gov/pubmed/30893596,Cell reports,2019 03 20,"Non-shivering thermogenesis in adipocytes provides defense against low temperatures and obesity development, but the underlying regulatory mechanism remains to be fully clarified. Based on both markedly increased Pin1 expression in states of excess nutrition and resistance to obesity development in Pin1 null mice, we speculated that adipocyte Pin1 may play a role in thermogenic programs. Adipose-specific Pin1 knockout (adPin1 KO) mice showed enhanced transcription of thermogenic genes and tolerance to hypothermia when exposed to cold. In addition, adPin1 KO mice were resistant to high-fat diet-induced obesity and glucose intolerance. A series of experiments revealed that Pin1 binds to PRDM16 and thereby promotes its degradation through the ubiquitin-proteasome system. Consistent with these results, Pin1 deletion in differentiated adipocytes showed enhancement of thermogenic programs in response to the β3 agonist CL316243 through the upregulation of PRDM16 proteins. These observations indicate that Pin1 is a negative regulator of non-shivering thermogenesis.",Entosis Controls a Developmental Cell Clearance in C. elegans.,https://www.ncbi.nlm.nih.gov/pubmed/30893595,Cell reports,2019 04 24,"Metazoan cell death mechanisms are diverse and include numerous non-apoptotic programs. One program called entosis involves the invasion of live cells into their neighbors and is known to occur in cancers. Here, we identify a developmental function for entosis: to clear the male-specific linker cell in C. elegans. The linker cell leads migration to shape the gonad and is removed to facilitate fusion of the gonad to the cloaca. We find that the linker cell is cleared in a manner involving cell-cell adhesions and cell-autonomous control of uptake through linker cell actin. Linker cell entosis generates a lobe structure that is deposited at the site of gonad-to-cloaca fusion and is removed during mating. Inhibition of lobe scission inhibits linker cell death, demonstrating that the linker cell invades its host while alive. Our findings demonstrate a developmental function for entosis: to eliminate a migrating cell and facilitate gonad-to-cloaca fusion, which is required for fertility.",Modeling Patient-Derived Glioblastoma with Cerebral Organoids.,https://www.ncbi.nlm.nih.gov/pubmed/30893594,Cell reports,2019 03 20,"The prognosis of patients with glioblastoma (GBM) remains dismal, with a median survival of approximately 15 months. Current preclinical GBM models are limited by the lack of a ""normal"" human microenvironment and the inability of many tumor cell lines to accurately reproduce GBM biology. To address these limitations, we have established a model system whereby we can retro-engineer patient-specific GBMs using patient-derived glioma stem cells (GSCs) and human embryonic stem cell (hESC)-derived cerebral organoids. Our cerebral organoid glioma (GLICO) model shows that GSCs home toward the human cerebral organoid and deeply invade and proliferate within the host tissue, forming tumors that closely phenocopy patient GBMs. Furthermore, cerebral organoid tumors form rapidly and are supported by an interconnected network of tumor microtubes that aids in the invasion of normal host tissue. Our GLICO model provides a system for modeling primary human GBM ex vivo and for high-throughput drug screening.",SOX2-Dependent Transcription in Clock Neurons Promotes the Robustness of the Central Circadian Pacemaker.,https://www.ncbi.nlm.nih.gov/pubmed/30893593,Cell reports,2019 03 20,"Clock neurons within the mammalian suprachiasmatic nuclei (SCN) encode circadian time using interlocked transcription-translation feedback loops (TTFLs) that drive rhythmic gene expression. However, the contributions of other transcription factors outside of the circadian TTFLs to the functionality of the SCN remain obscure. Here, we report that the stem and progenitor cell transcription factor, sex-determining region Y-box 2 (SOX2), is expressed in adult SCN neurons and positively regulates transcription of the core clock gene, Period2. Mice lacking SOX2 selectively in SCN neurons display imprecise, poorly consolidated behavioral rhythms that do not entrain efficiently to environmental light cycles and that are highly susceptible to constant light-induced arrhythmicity. RNA sequencing revealed that Sox2 deficiency alters the SCN transcriptome, reducing the expression of core clock genes and neuropeptide-receptor systems. By defining the transcriptional landscape within SCN neurons, SOX2 enables the generation of robust, entrainable circadian rhythms that accurately reflect environmental time.",A Protein Disulfide Isomerase Controls Neuronal Migration through Regulation of Wnt Secretion.,https://www.ncbi.nlm.nih.gov/pubmed/30893592,Cell reports,2019 03 20,"Appropriate Wnt morphogen secretion is required to control animal development and homeostasis. Although correct Wnt globular structure is essential for secretion, proteins that directly mediate Wnt folding and maturation remain uncharacterized. Here, we report that protein disulfide isomerase-1 (PDI-1), a protein-folding catalyst and chaperone, controls secretion of the Caenorhabditis elegans Wnt ortholog EGL-20. We find that PDI-1 function is required to correctly form an anteroposterior EGL-20/Wnt gradient during embryonic development. Furthermore, PDI-1 performs this role in EGL-20/Wnt-producing epidermal cells to cell-non-autonomously control EGL-20/Wnt-dependent neuronal migration. Using pharmacological inhibition, we further show that PDI function is required in human cells for Wnt3a secretion, revealing a conserved role for disulfide isomerases. Together, these results demonstrate a critical role for PDIs within Wnt-producing cells to control long-range developmental events that are dependent on Wnt secretion.",Treg-Cell Control of a CXCL5-IL-17 Inflammatory Axis Promotes Hair-Follicle-Stem-Cell Differentiation During Skin-Barrier Repair.,https://www.ncbi.nlm.nih.gov/pubmed/30893588,Immunity,2019 05 11,"Restoration of barrier-tissue integrity after injury is dependent on the function of immune cells and stem cells (SCs) residing in the tissue. In response to skin injury, hair-follicle stem cells (HFSCs), normally poised for hair generation, are recruited to the site of injury and differentiate into cells that repair damaged epithelium. We used a SC fate-mapping approach to examine the contribution of regulatory T (Treg) cells to epidermal-barrier repair after injury. Depletion of Treg cells impaired skin-barrier regeneration and was associated with a Th17 inflammatory response and failed HFSC differentiation. In this setting, damaged epithelial cells preferentially expressed the neutrophil chemoattractant CXCL5, and blockade of CXCL5 or neutrophil depletion restored barrier function and SC differentiation after epidermal injury. Thus, Treg-cell regulation of localized inflammation enables HFSC differentiation and, thereby, skin-barrier regeneration, with implications for the maintenance and repair of other barrier tissues.","Viral DNA Binding to NLRC3, an Inhibitory Nucleic Acid Sensor, Unleashes STING, a Cyclic Dinucleotide Receptor that Activates Type I Interferon.",https://www.ncbi.nlm.nih.gov/pubmed/30893587,Immunity,2019 04 18,"Immune suppression is a crucial component of immunoregulation and a subgroup of nucleotide-binding domain (NBD), leucine-rich repeat (LRR)-containing proteins (NLRs) attenuate innate immunity. How this inhibitory function is controlled is unknown. A key question is whether microbial ligands can regulate this inhibition. NLRC3 is a negative regulator that attenuates type I interferon (IFN-I) response by sequestering and attenuating stimulator of interferon genes (STING) activation. Here, we report that NLRC3 binds viral DNA and other nucleic acids through its LRR domain. DNA binding to NLRC3 increases its ATPase activity, and ATP-binding by NLRC3 diminishes its interaction with STING, thus licensing an IFN-I response. This work uncovers a mechanism wherein viral nucleic acid binding releases an inhibitory innate receptor from its target."

The individual NEFA showed the same response curve except LA and some very long chain saturated fatty acids (VLCSFA, ≥ 20 carbon chain length) that markedly increased shortly after the meal intake. The similarities and dissimilarities in lipid profiles between study subjects at different time points were visualized using non-metric multidimensional scaling (NMDS). Overall, the results indicate that postprandial levels of LA and VLCSFA either as NEFA or TG were most affected by the test meal, which might provide an explanation for the health effects of this dietary lifestyle characterized by high intake of mixed meals rich in n-6 PUFA.",Osteopontin plays important roles in pulmonary arterial hypertension induced by systemic-to-pulmonary shunt.,https://www.ncbi.nlm.nih.gov/pubmed/30893567,FASEB journal : official publication of the Federation of American Societies for Experimental Biology,2019 05 30,"Recent studies indicated that osteopontin (OPN) was involved in the genesis and progression of pulmonary arterial hypertension (PAH); however, its role in congenital heart disease-associated PAH (CHD/PAH) remains unknown. Our results showed that OPN was increased in lungs and plasma of patients with Eisenmenger syndrome; moreover, OPN and αVβ3-integrin expression levels were augmented in rat lungs exposed to systemic-to-pulmonary shunt. Cell culture assay demonstrated that distal pulmonary arterial smooth muscle cells (PASMCs) from rat lungs suffering from volume and pressure overload exhibited enhanced proliferation compared with those from healthy rats. Mechanical stretch (20% at 1 Hz) increased OPN expression and activated ERK1/2 and protein kinase B (Akt) signal pathway in distal PASMCs from healthy rats. Interestingly, OPN enhanced the proliferation and migration of PASMCs while blocking αVβ3-integrin with neutralizing antibody LM609 or Arg-Gly-Asp peptidomimetic antagonist cyclo(Ala-Arg-Gly-Asp-3-aminomethylbenzoyl) (XJ735), rectified the proliferative and migratory effects of OPN, which were partially mediated via ERK1/2 and Akt signaling pathways. Furthermore, surgical correction of systemic-to-pulmonary shunt, particularly XJ735 supplementation after surgical correction of systemic-to-pulmonary shunt, significantly alleviated the pulmonary hypertensive status in terms of pulmonary hemodynamic indices, pulmonary vasculopathy, and right ventricular hypertrophy. In summary, OPN alteration in lungs exposed to systemic-to-pulmonary shunt exerts a deteriorative role in pulmonary vascular remodeling through modulating the proliferation and migration of PASMCs, at least in part, via ανβ3-ERK1/2 and ανβ3-Akt signaling pathways. Antagonizing OPN receptor ανβ3-integrin accelerated the regression of pulmonary vasculopathy after surgical correction of systemic-to-pulmonary shunt, indicating a potential therapeutic strategy for patients with CHD/PAH.-Meng, L., Liu, X., Teng, X., Gu, H., Yuan, W., Meng, J., Li, J., Zheng, Z., Wei, Y., Hu, S.

To clarify it, we constructed a noninvasive in vivo calcium-imaging model of zebrafish Mauthner cells and monitored subcellular calcium dynamics during axonal regeneration. Using the calcium indicator GCamp6f, we observed that the regenerative length correlated with the peak amplitude of the evoked calcium response before axotomy, which suggested that the evoked calcium response might serve as a useful indicator of evoked neuronal activity and axonal regenerative capacity. To investigate this possibility, we overexpressed an inward rectifying potassium channel protein, Kir2.1a, to decrease the Mauthner neuronal activity and found that the inhibition of the calcium response correlated with decreased axonal regeneration. In contrast, treatment of pentylenetetrazol and knockout of the sodium voltage-gated channel α subunit 1 gene increased the calcium response and thus enhanced axonal regeneration. Our results therefore increased the understanding of the correlation between the neural activity and the vertebrate axonal regeneration.-Chen, M., Huang, R.-C., Yang, L.-Q., Ren, D.-L., Hu, B.

Thus, hMSCs are both a source of and target for 1α,25(OH)2D3. Megalin is a transmembrane receptor for serum d-binding protein (DBP) in kidney cells and is required for uptake of the 25(OH)D3-DBP complex. We tested the hypothesis that megalin is required for D actions in hMSCs with cells from surgically discarded marrow for RT-PCR, for effects of 25(OH)D3 and 1α,25(OH)2D3, for 1α,25(OH)2D3 biosynthesis, for osteoblastogenesis, and for small interfering RNA for megalin (si-Meg) and control (si-Ctr). In hMSCs with high constitutive megalin expression, both 1α,25(OH)2D3 and 25(OH)D3 stimulated osteoblastogenesis (P < 0.05), but only 1α,25(OH)2D3 did so in hMSCs with lower megalin (lo-Meg, P < 0.001) or in si-Meg cells (P < 0.05). In addition, 1α,25(OH)2D3 biosynthesis was significantly lower in lo-Meg (46%, P = 0.034) and in si-Meg (23%, P < 0.001) than each control. Leptin significantly stimulated megalin expression 2.1-fold in lo-Meg cells (P < 0.01). These studies show that megalin is expressed in hMSCs and is required for the biosynthesis of 1α,25(OH)2D3 and for the 25(OH)D3/DBP complex to stimulate vitamin D receptor targets and osteoblastogenesis.-Gao, Y., Zhou, S., Luu, S., Glowacki, J.

PTE has been the subject of multiple enzyme evolution attempts, which have been highly successful against specific insecticides and the G-type nerve agents. Similar attempts targeting the V-type nerve agents have failed to achieve the same degree of success. Enzyme evolution is an inherently complex problem, which is complicated by synergistic effects, the need to use analogues in high-throughput screening, and a lack of quantitative data to direct future efforts. Previous evolution experiments with PTE have assumed an absence of synergy and minimally screened large libraries, which provides no quantitative information about the effects of individual mutations. Here a systemic approach has been applied to a 28800-member six-site PTE library. The library is screened against multiple V-agent analogues, and a combination of sequence and quantitative activity analysis is used to extract data about the effects of individual mutations. We demonstrate that synergistic relationships dominate the evolutionary landscape of PTE and that analogue activity profiles can be used to identify variants with high activity for substrates. Using these approaches, multiple variants with kcat/ Km values for the hydrolysis of VX that were improved >1500-fold were identified, including one variant that is improved 9200-fold relative to wild-type PTE and is specific for the SP enantiomer of VX. Multiple variants that were highly active for ( SP)-VR were identified, the best of which has a kcat/ Km values that is improved 13400-fold relative to that of wild-type PTE.","Cu(OTf)2-Promoted 1,4-Addition of Alkyl Bromides to Dehydroalanine.",https://www.ncbi.nlm.nih.gov/pubmed/30893548,The Journal of organic chemistry,2019 04 05,Zn/Cu(OTf)2-mediated addition of alkyl bromides to dehydroalanine (Dha) derivatives including dipeptides and tripeptides in good to high yields under an aqueous medium was developed.

Embelin has the anti-inflammatory property. It also got anti-tumorigenic and antioxidant properties. In this research, we analyzed the actions of embelin on nephrotoxicity triggered by cisplatin and vital actions by which it increases antioxidant actions and corrects the inflammation after embelin administration during nephrotoxicity triggered by cisplatin. Kidney function markers including blood urea nitrogen; serum creatinine; the markers of oxidative stress like malondialdehyde (MDA), antioxidant systems like glutathione, superoxide dismutase, glutathione S-transferase, catalase, and glutathione reductase; inflammation markers like nuclear factor-κB (NF-κB), tumor necrosis factor-α (TNF-α), and interleukin-1 beta (IL-1β); and the extent of nuclear factor-erythroid-2 p45-related factor-2 (Nrf2) and heme oxygenase-1 (HO-1) were determined. Histopathology studies of kidneys were also used to analyze nephrotoxicity induced by cisplatin. Treatment with embelin (25 and 50 mg/kg) upgrades the function of kidneys, by elevating antioxidant levels and reducing the MDA level in cisplatin-administered rats. Embelin treatment demonstrated a significant curtailment of oxidative stress as well as increased the activities of antioxidant enzymes, endogenously. Cisplatin upregulates cytokines (i.e., TNF-α and IL-1β) and NF-κB, and downregulates Nrf2 and HO-1. Embelin treatment also reduced the infiltration of neutrophils in the renal tubules and thus reduced the level of histological impairment. The outcome of this study implements that the signaling pathway of Nrf2/HO-1 may be the principal mechanism of embelin for protection from nephrotoxicity triggered by cisplatin, and thus, embelin diminishes oxidative stress and inflammation by impeding NF-κB. © 2019 BioFactors, 45(3):471-478, 2019.",Halogen Bonds of Halotetrafluoropyridines in Crystals and Co-crystals with Benzene and Pyridine.,https://www.ncbi.nlm.nih.gov/pubmed/30893505,"Chemistry (Weinheim an der Bergstrasse, Germany)",2019 05 29,"The structures of the three para-substituted halotetrafluoropyridines with chlorine, bromine, and iodine have been determined in the solid state (X-ray diffraction).

An analysis and assessment approach for multiple hazard spatiotemporal resilience of interdependent infrastructure systems is developed using network theory and a numerical analysis. First, we define multiple hazard resilience and present a quantitative probabilistic metric based on the expansion of a single hazard deterministic resilience model. Second, we define a multiple hazard relationship analysis model with a focus on the impact of hazards on an infrastructure. Subsequently, a relationship matrix is constructed with temporal and spatial dimensions. Further, a general method for the evaluation of direct impacts on an individual infrastructure under multiple hazards is proposed. Third, we present an analysis of indirect multiple hazard impacts on interdependent infrastructures and a joint restoration model of an infrastructure system. Finally, a simplified two-layer interdependent infrastructure network is used as a case study for illustrating the proposed methodology.

The crystal structure of plant rhamnosyltransferase UGT89C1 from Arabidopsis thaliana was determined, and the structures of UGT89C1 in complexes with UDP-β-l-rhamnose and acceptor quercetin revealed the detailed interactions between the enzyme and its substrates. Structural and mutational analysis indicated that Asp356, His357, Pro147 and Ile148 are key residues for sugar donor recognition and specificity for UDP-β-l-rhamnose. The mutant H357Q exhibited activity with both UDP-β-l-rhamnose and UDP-glucose. Structural comparison and mutagenesis confirmed that His21 is a key residue as the catalytic base and the only catalytic residue involved in catalysis independently as UGT89C1 lacks the other catalytic Asp that is highly conserved in other reported UGTs and forms a hydrogen bond with the catalytic base His. Ser124 is located in the corresponding position of the catalytic Asp in other UGTs and is not able to form a hydrogen bond with His21. Mutagenesis further showed that Ser124 may not be important in its catalysis, suggesting that His21 and acceptor may form an acceptor-His dyad and UGT89C1 utilizes a catalytic dyad in catalysis instead of catalytic triad.

However, these models have often been found to be sensitive to the model parameterization, as well as the specifics of the data set used. The Bayesian salmonella source attribution model presented here was developed to be generally applicable with small and sparse annual data sets obtained over several years. The full Bayesian model was modularized into three parts (an exposure model, a subtype distribution model, and an epidemiological model) in order to separately estimate unknown parameters in each module. The proposed model takes advantage of the consumption and overall salmonella prevalence of the studied sources, as well as bacteria typing results from adjacent years. The latter were used for a smoothed estimation of the annual relative proportions of different salmonella subtypes in each of the sources. The source-specific effects and the salmonella subtype-specific effects were included in the epidemiological model to describe the differences between sources and between subtypes in their ability to infect humans. The estimation of these parameters was based on data from multiple years. Finally, the model combines the total evidence from different modules to proportion human salmonellosis cases according to their sources.

Dead and moribund fish had severe skin and muscle ulcers, often 2-6 cm wide, particularly caudal to the pectoral fins. Microscopic examination of smears from ulcers and head kidney identified long, slender Gram-negative rods. Histopathological analysis revealed abundance of long, slender Tenacibaculum-like bacteria in ulcers and affected fins. Genetic characterization using multilocus sequence analysis (MLSA) of seven housekeeping genes, including atpA, dnaK, glyA, gyrB, infB, rlmN and tgt, revealed that the isolates obtained during the outbreak were all clustered with the Tenacibaculum dicentrarchi-type strain (USC39/09T ) from Spain. Two bath challenge experiments with Atlantic salmon and an isolate of T. dicentrarchi from the outbreak were performed. No disease or mortality was observed in the first trial. In the second trial with a higher challenge dose of T. dicentrarchi and longer challenge time, we got 100% mortality within 48 hr. This is the first reported outbreak of disease caused by T. dicentrarchi in Norwegian farmed Atlantic salmon.","Communicating with the Public About Marauding Terrorist Firearms Attacks: Results from a Survey Experiment on Factors Influencing Intention to ""Run, Hide, Tell"" in the United Kingdom and Denmark.",https://www.ncbi.nlm.nih.gov/pubmed/30893483,Risk analysis : an official publication of the Society for Risk Analysis,2019 03 20,"Effective risk communication is an integral part of responding to terrorism, but until recently, there has been very little pre-event communication in a European context to provide advice to the public on how to protect themselves during an attack. Following terrorist attacks involving mass shootings in Paris, France, in November 2015, the U.K. National Police Chiefs' Council released a Stay Safe film and leaflet that advises the public to ""run,"" ""hide,"" and ""tell"" in the event of a firearms or weapons attack. However, other countries, including Denmark, do not provide preparedness information of this kind, in large part because of concern about scaring the public. In this survey experiment, 3,003 U.K. and Danish participants were randomly assigned to one of three conditions: no information, a leaflet intervention, and a film intervention to examine the impact of ""Run, Hide, Tell"" advice on perceptions about terrorism, the security services, and intended responses to a hypothetical terrorist firearms attack. Results demonstrate important benefits of pre-event communication in relation to enhancing trust, encouraging protective health behaviors, and discouraging potentially dangerous actions.

Viola philippica is a well-known medicinal plant, and the application of V. philippica aqueous extracts against GIV infection was assessed by different methods in this study. The results showed that the working concentration of V. philippica aqueous extracts was 10 mg/ml. V. philippica aqueous extracts below 10 mg/ml have no significant cytotoxic effects on cell viability, while extracts over 15 mg/ml decreased cell viability and showed cytotoxic activity. V. philippica aqueous extracts had excellent inhibitory effects against GIV infection in vitro and in vivo. The possible antiviral mechanism of V. philippica was further analysed, which indicated that V. philippica did no damages to GIV particles, but it could disturb GIV binding, entry and replication in host cells. V. philippica had the best inhibitory effects against GIV during viral infection stage of binding and replication in host cells. Overall, the results suggest that appropriate concentration of V. philippica aqueous extracts has great antiviral effects, making it an interesting candidate for developing effective medicines for preventing and controlling GIV infection in farmed groupers.","Combined DNA Typing and Protein Identification from Unfired Brass Cartridges,,.",https://www.ncbi.nlm.nih.gov/pubmed/30893480,Journal of forensic sciences,2019 03 20,"Biological evidence analysis from contact traces is adversely affected by low quantity and quality of DNA.

Total phenolic content (TPC) was used to find the optimal VI parameters. Sliced potatoes were fried under vacuum at 110, 120, or 140 °C from 20 to 720 s to test the thermal degradability of the TPC. Three frying systems were also compared: vacuum frying (VF), dual-step (DS) frying, and atmospheric frying (AF). Green tea concentration of 5%, vacuum time of 10 min, and a pressure of 80 kPa gave the maximum TPC of 196.11 ± 15.41 mg GAE/100 g of dry matter. Samples fried at 120 °C showed an overall greater phenolic retention capacity compared to the chips fried at 140 and 110 °C. Using the optimal VI and VF parameters (140 °C, 100 s), the three frying systems were then compared. Samples fried using the AF system contained twice as much the oil content as those fried using the VF or DS systems. VF chips had the highest percentage in TPC increase (209%) while AF chips had the lowest (163%). A consumer panel found the samples fried under AF more acceptable and were given the highest scores for all quality. VI had a negative effect on the color scoring of the participants (they were dark). Overall, VI is a suitable precursor of VF to create potato chips with a high phenolic content. PRACTICAL APPLICATION: Vacuum impregnated potato chips with green tea extract have potential for manufacture of functional snacks that may influence the public into consuming phenol-rich fruit and vegetable snack.",Super-recognizers: From the lab to the world and back again.,https://www.ncbi.nlm.nih.gov/pubmed/30893478,"British journal of psychology (London, England : 1953)",2019 03 20,"The recent discovery of individuals with superior face processing ability has sparked considerable interest amongst cognitive scientists and practitioners alike. These 'Super-recognizers' (SRs) offer clues to the underlying processes responsible for high levels of face processing ability. It has been claimed that they can help make societies safer and fairer by improving accuracy of facial identity processing in real-world tasks, for example when identifying suspects from Closed Circuit Television or performing security-critical identity verification tasks. Here, we argue that the current understanding of superior face processing does not justify widespread interest in SR deployment: There are relatively few studies of SRs and no evidence that high accuracy on laboratory-based tests translates directly to operational deployment. Using simulated data, we show that modest accuracy benefits can be expected from deploying SRs on the basis of ideally calibrated laboratory tests. Attaining more substantial benefits will require greater levels of communication and collaboration between psychologists and practitioners. We propose that translational and reverse-translational approaches to knowledge development are critical to advance current understanding and to enable optimal deployment of SRs in society. Finally, we outline knowledge gaps that this approach can help address.",Quantitative assessment of breast density using transmission ultrasound tomography.,https://www.ncbi.nlm.nih.gov/pubmed/30893476,Medical physics,2019 06 12,"Breast density is important in the evaluation of breast cancer risk.

Therefore, B lymphocytes and antibody-secreting cells are considered relevant targets for therapies. However, isolation and characterisation of auto-reactive specific B lymphocytes are limited, primarily due to technical issues. In this work, we purified extractable nuclear antigen-specific and citrullinated peptide-specific auto-reactive B lymphocytes by magnetic selection with ENA- and citrullinated peptide-bound immunobeads. We obtained blood auto-reactive B lymphocytes from most patients. Their nature was primarily naïve B cells, some of them in an active status, with low levels of somatic hypermutations in the immunoglobulin heavy-chain variable regions. Their presence correlated with serum levels of autoAb. Auto-reactive B lymphocytes were able to differentiate into auto-reactive antibody-secreting cells under conditions of stimulation. In addition, based on the presence of circulating auto-reactive B cells and/or antibody-secreting cells, four different profiles were described in lupus patients. Thus, tracking auto-reactive B cells and/or antibody-secreting cells in patient blood could represent a biomarker for deciding whether to use therapies blocking either B cells, plasma cells or both, as well as a new tool for monitoring minimal residual autoimmune disease in patients."

Allosteric ligands are known to interact within the transmembrane domain, yet a complete view of receptor activation remains elusive. By combining site-directed mutagenesis with computational modeling, we investigate the structure and dynamics of the allosteric binding pocket of the T1R3 sweet-taste receptor in its apo form, and in the presence of an allosteric ligand, cyclamate. A novel positively charged residue at the extracellular loop 2 is shown to interact with the ligand. Molecular dynamics simulations capture significant differences in the behavior of a network of conserved residues with and without cyclamate, although they do not directly interact with the allosteric ligand. Structural models show that they adopt alternate conformations, associated with a conformational change in the transmembrane region. Site-directed mutagenesis confirms that these residues are unequivocally involved in the receptor function and the allosteric signaling mechanism of the sweet-taste receptor. Similar to a large portion of the transmembrane domain, they are highly conserved among mammals, suggesting an activation mechanism that is evolutionarily conserved. This work provides a structural basis for describing the dynamics of the receptor, and for the rational design of new sweet-taste modulators.",Respiratory Management in Smoke Inhalation Injury.,https://www.ncbi.nlm.nih.gov/pubmed/30893426,Journal of burn care & research : official publication of the American Burn Association,2019 03 20,"Smoke inhalation injury is a major morbidity and cause of mortality in patients with burns.

For burn patients that develop infections, it is critical to rapidly identify the etiology so that an appropriate treatment can be administered. Current clinical standards rely heavily on culture-based methods for local and systemic infection testing, which can often take days to complete. While more advanced methods (i.e. MALDI or NAAT) have improved turnaround times, they may still suffer from either the need for pure culture or sensitivity and specificity issues. PNA-FISH offers a way to reduce this time from days to hours and provide species-specific identification. While PNA-FISH has had great utility in research, its use in clinical microbiology diagnostics has been minimal (including burn wound diagnostics). This work describes a non-culture based identification technique using commercial available U.S. FDA-approved PNA-FISH probes for the identification of common clinical pathogens, Pseudomonas aeruginosa and Staphylococcus aureus, present in burn wound infections. Additionally, calcofluor white was included for identification of Candida albicans. All three pathogens were identified from a tri-species infected deep-partial thickness rat burn wound model. These species were clearly identifiable in swab and tissue samples that were collected, with minimal auto-fluorescence from any species.

Regulatory T cells (Tregs) are the cells responsible for suppressing immune responses and can be activated in secondary lymphatic tissues, where they subsequently regulate effector T cell and dendritic cell activation. Recently, Tregs that reside in non-lymphoid tissues, called tissue Tregs, have been shown to exhibit tissue-specific functions that contribute to the maintenance of tissue homeostasis and repair. Unlike other tissue Tregs, the role of Tregs in the brain has not been well elucidated because the number of brain Tregs is very small under normal conditions. However, we found that Tregs accumulate in the brain at the chronic phase of ischemic brain injury and control astrogliosis through secretion of a cytokine, amphiregulin (Areg). Brain Tregs resemble other tissue Tregs in many ways but, unlike the other tissue Tregs, brain Tregs express neural-cell-specific genes such as the serotonin receptor (Htr7) and respond to serotonin. Administering serotonin or selective serotonin reuptake inhibitors (SSRIs) in an experimental mouse model of stroke increases the number of brain Tregs and ameliorates neurological symptoms.

Insight into the evolution of orthologs, paralogs and xenologs in the yeast pan-genome can help bridge these genotypes; however, existing phylogenomic databases do not span diverse yeasts, and sometimes cannot distinguish between these homologs. To help understand the molecular evolution of these traits in yeasts, we created Analyzing Yeasts by Reconstructing Ancestry of Homologs (AYbRAH), an open-source database of predicted and manually curated ortholog groups for 33 diverse fungi and yeasts in Dikarya, spanning 600 million years of evolution. OrthoMCL and OrthoDB were used to cluster protein sequence into ortholog and homolog groups, respectively; MAFFT and PhyML reconstructed the phylogeny of all homolog groups. Ortholog assignments for enzymes and small metabolite transporters were compared to their phylogenetic reconstruction, and curated to resolve any discrepancies. Information on homolog and ortholog groups can be viewed in the AYbRAH web portal (https://lmse.github.io/aybrah/), including functional annotations, predictions for mitochondrial localization and transmembrane domains, literature references and phylogenetic reconstructions. Ortholog assignments in AYbRAH were compared to HOGENOM, KEGG Orthology, OMA, eggNOG and PANTHER. PANTHER and OMA had the most congruent ortholog groups with AYbRAH, while the other phylogenomic databases had greater amounts of under-clustering, over-clustering or no ortholog annotations for proteins. Future plans are discussed for AYbRAH, and recommendations are made for other research communities seeking to create curated ortholog databases.","Measurement of Diacetyl and 2,3-Pentanedione in the Coffee Industry Using Thermal Desorption Tubes and Gas Chromatography-Mass Spectrometry.",https://www.ncbi.nlm.nih.gov/pubmed/30893419,Annals of work exposures and health,2019 04 19,"Diacetyl is a potentially harmful chemical that is used as an artificial flavouring in the food industry and may also be generated during processing of some natural products including coffee. In Europe, an 8-h time weighted average occupational exposure limit (TWA-OEL) of 20 ppb has been adopted for diacetyl, together with a short-term exposure limit (STEL) of 100 ppb. A new measurement method involving sampling on thermal desorption tubes and analysis by gas chromatography-mass spectrometry has been used to investigate potential exposure to diacetyl, and the related compound 2,3-pentanedione, at eight companies involved in the coffee industry including large- and small-scale manufacturers and coffee shops. A total of 124 static and personal samples were collected. In the majority of personal samples airborne concentrations of diacetyl were <5 ppb, with those at coffee shops generally <1 ppb. However, diacetyl concentrations in ~40% of the long-term personal samples, mainly originating from one site, were found to be in excess of the newly adopted European TWA-OEL of 20 ppb. Diacetyl concentrations up to 400 ppb were detected on the static samples, with the highest values occurring during grinding of roasted coffee beans. 2,3-Pentanedione was also detected in most of the samples at airborne concentrations around half of those for diacetyl. A significant number of other volatile organic compounds (VOCs) were also detected at sub-ppm concentrations, including acetoin, aliphatic carboxylic acids, aldehydes, ketones and esters, methylfuran, furfural and furfuryl-based alcohols and ketones, and nitrogen containing compounds, such as pyridines and pyrazines. In laboratory tests, diacetyl emissions generated during heating of whole beans were found to be significantly lower than those from heating the same beans after grinding.

The objective of our study was to investigate the safety and efficacy of once-daily halobetasol propionate (HP) lotion 0.01% in moderate to severe plaque psoriasis through 2 multicenter, randomized, double-blind, vehicle-controlled phase 3 studies (N=430). Participants were randomized (2:1) to HP lotion 0.01% or vehicle once daily for 8 weeks, followed by 4 weeks of follow-up. The primary efficacy assessment was treatment success (at least a 2-grade improvement in baseline investigator global assessment [IGA] score and a score of 0 [clear] or 1 [almost clear]). Additional assessments included improvement in psoriasis signs and symptoms, body surface area (BSA), and a composite score of IGA×BSA.

Such populations are vital for studies investigating the functional capacity of B-cells, as the presence of other cell types may have indirect effects on B-cell function through cell-cell interactions or by secretion of several soluble molecules. B-cells can be isolated by two main approaches: 1) Negative selection-in which B-cells remain ""untouched"" in their native state; this is advantageous as it is likely that B-cells remain functionally unaltered by this process. 2) Positive selection-in which B-cells are labelled and actively removed from the sample. We used three Negative B-cell isolation kits as well as the Positive B-cell isolation kit from Miltenyi and compared the purity of each of the resulting B-cells fractions. Contamination of isolated B-cell fractions with platelets was the conclusive finding for all of the isolation techniques tested. These results illustrate the inefficiency of current available MACS B-cell isolation kits to produce pure B-cell populations, from which concrete findings can be made. As such we suggest cell sorting as the preferred method for isolating pure B-cells to be used for downstream functional assays.",Analysis of clinical parameters and echocardiography as predictors of fatal pediatric myocarditis.,https://www.ncbi.nlm.nih.gov/pubmed/30893383,PloS one,2019 04 02,"Pediatric myocarditis symptoms can be mild or as extreme as sudden cardiac arrest. Early identification of the severity of illness and timely provision of critical care is helpful; however, the risk factors associated with mortality remain unclear and controversial. We undertook a retrospective review of the medical records of pediatric patients with myocarditis in a tertiary care referral hospital for over 12 years to identify the predictive factors of mortality. Demographics, presentation, laboratory test results, echocardiography findings, and treatment outcomes were obtained. Regression analyses revealed the clinical parameters for predicting mortality. During the 12-year period, 94 patients with myocarditis were included. Of these, 16 (17%) patients died, with 12 succumbing in the first 72 hours after admission. Fatal cases more commonly presented with arrhythmia, hypotension, acidosis, gastrointestinal symptoms, decreased left ventricular ejection fraction, and elevated isoenzyme of creatine kinase and troponin I levels than nonfatal cases. In multivariate analysis, troponin I > 45 ng/mL and left ventricular ejection fraction < 42% were significantly associated with mortality. Pediatric myocarditis had a high mortality rate, much of which was concentrated in the first 72 hours after hospitalization. Children with very high troponin levels or reduced ejection fraction in the first 24 hours were at higher risk of mortality, and targeting these individuals for more intensive therapies may be warranted.",Validation of Polish version of the Basel Extent of Rationing of Nursing Care revised questionnaire.,https://www.ncbi.nlm.nih.gov/pubmed/30893382,PloS one,2019 04 02,"Development of simple, valid and reliable instruments to determine nursing care rationing is a subject of ongoing research. One such instrument, which is gaining popularity worldwide and has significant research applicability, is the Basel Extent of Rationing of Nursing Care (BERNCA) and its revised version, the BERNCA-R. The aim of this study was to translate and adapt the BERNCA-R into a Polish-language version and to assess its reliability and validity in evaluating the level of implicit rationing of nursing care in Poland. Standard methodological requirements were followed during translation and cultural adaptation of the English version of the BERNCA-R questionnaire into Polish. The cross-sectional validation study was conducted between May and September 2017, which included 175 nurses undergoing specialisation and qualification courses at the European Postgraduate Education Centre in Wrocław, Poland. Cronbach's alpha and inter-item correlations were used to analyse the internal consistency of the Polish BERNCA-R questionnaire. The mean total BERNCA-R score was 1.9 points (SD = 0.74) on a scale of 0-4. Cronbach's alpha for the unidimensional scale was 0.96. The mean inter-item correlation was 0.4 (range 0.1-0.84), which indicates high internal consistency. A single-factor solution demonstrated stable loadings above 0.5 for almost all items of the Polish BERNCA-R questionnaire. The study using the Polish BERNCA-R questionnaire demonstrated that the instrument is valid and reliable for use in investigating care rationing in groups of Polish nurses.",Review of disease-related complications and management in adult patients with thalassemia: A multi-center study in Thailand.,https://www.ncbi.nlm.nih.gov/pubmed/30893381,PloS one,2019 04 02,"Disease-related complications and management are different among patients with thalassemia.

A multicenter cross-sectional study was conducted in patients with thalassemia aged ≥ 18 years old. Thalassemia-related complications and management were reviewed. The clinical parameters significantly associated with the complications were analyzed by logistic regression methods. The prevalence of thalassemia-related complications was 100% in patients with transfusion-dependent thalassemia (TDT) and 58.8% in patients with non-transfusion-dependent thalassemia (NTDT). Advanced age was statistically associated with extramedullary hematopoiesis in both TDT and NTDT patients. Splenectomy was a significant risk factor for pulmonary hypertension in both groups of patients. Severe iron overload started earlier in patients with TDT than NTDT and was associated with diabetes mellitus (adjusted odds ratio (AOR) = 6.2, p-value = 0.02). Disease-related complications are more prevalent in patients with TDT than patients with NTDT. Splenectomy and advanced age were important risk factors for developing major complications in both groups. Early screening and management for specific disease-related complications should be considered in patients with thalassemia according to their clinical risk factors."

Local adaptation of resident hosts and parasites should lead to increase parasite infectivity/virulence (higher compatibility) when infecting hosts from the same location (in sympatry) than from a foreign location (in allopatry). Analysis of geographic variations in compatibility phenotypes is the most common proxy used to infer local adaptation. However, in some cases, allopatric host-parasite systems demonstrate similar or greater compatibility than in sympatry. In such cases, the potential for local adaptation remains unclear. Here, we study the interaction between Schistosoma and its vector snail Biomphalaria in which such discrepancy in local versus foreign compatibility phenotype has been reported. Herein, we aim at bridging this gap of knowledge by comparing life history traits (immune cellular response, host mortality, and parasite growth) and molecular responses in highly compatible sympatric and allopatric Schistosoma/Biomphalaria interactions originating from different geographic localities (Brazil, Venezuela and Burundi). We found that despite displaying similar prevalence phenotypes, sympatric schistosomes triggered a rapid immune suppression (dual-RNAseq analyses) in the snails within 24h post infection, whereas infection by allopatric schistosomes (regardless of the species) was associated with immune cell proliferation and triggered a non-specific generalized immune response after 96h. We observed that, sympatric schistosomes grow more rapidly. Finally, we identify miRNAs differentially expressed by Schistosoma mansoni that target host immune genes and could be responsible for hijacking the host immune response during the sympatric interaction. We show that despite having similar prevalence phenotypes, sympatric and allopatric snail-Schistosoma interactions displayed strong differences in their immunobiological molecular dialogue. Understanding the mechanisms allowing parasites to adapt rapidly and efficiently to new hosts is critical to control disease emergence and risks of Schistosomiasis outbreaks.",Parenting practices that may encourage and discourage physical activity in preschool-age children of Brazilian immigrant families: A qualitative study.,https://www.ncbi.nlm.nih.gov/pubmed/30893366,PloS one,2019 04 02,"Brazilians are a rapidly increasing Latino immigrant group in the United States (US), yet little research has examined factors influencing physical activity (PA) levels and behaviors of children growing up in Brazilian immigrant families. This information is needed to develop culturally sensitive interventions tailored to this population. Therefore, this qualitative study explored PA parenting practices used by Brazilian immigrant mothers living in the US. Thirty-seven Brazilian immigrant mothers with at least one child between the ages of 2 and 5 years participated in 1of 7 focus group discussions. Thematic analysis identified seven parenting practices that mothers employ that may encourage or facilitate physical activity their preschool-aged children's PA including: 1) modeling PA; 2) engaging and being physically active with child; 3) providing logistic support; 4) encouraging, praising, and offering motivational support; 5) watching, supervising, and teaching children how to engage in PA; 6) monitoring and setting limits to child's screen time; and 7) prompting child to be physically active. In addition, analysis identified four parenting practices that may discourage or inhibit children's PA including: 1) modeling of sedentary behaviors; 2) having rules and restrictions due to safety- and weather-related concerns; 3) limiting child's outdoor time due to parental time constraints; and 4) restricting child's outdoor and play time as punishment. Furthermore, analyses demonstrated that social contextual factors (e.g., income, housing, neighborhood safety, etc.) influence mothers' PA parenting practices and consequently, their children's PA. This is the first qualitative study, to our knowledge, to explore PA parenting practices of Brazilian-born immigrant mothers living in the US. Future research should further explore PA parenting practices of Brazilian immigrant parents including quantifying PA parenting practices that encourage and discourage PA, as well as examining the influence of fathers' PA parenting practices on young children's PA.","Comparative histopathologic and viral immunohistochemical studies on CeMV infection among Western Mediterranean, Northeast-Central, and Southwestern Atlantic cetaceans.",https://www.ncbi.nlm.nih.gov/pubmed/30893365,PloS one,2019 04 02,"Cetacean morbillivirus (CeMV) is a major natural cause of morbidity and mortality in cetaceans worldwide and results in epidemic and endemic fatalities. The pathogenesis of CeMV has not been fully elucidated, and questions remain regarding tissue tropism and the mechanisms of immunosuppression. We compared the histopathologic and viral immunohistochemical features in molecularly confirmed CeMV-infected Guiana dolphins (Sotalia guianensis) from the Southwestern Atlantic (Brazil) and striped dolphins (Stenella coeruleoalba) and bottlenose dolphins (Tursiops truncatus) from the Northeast-Central Atlantic (Canary Islands, Spain) and the Western Mediterranean Sea (Italy). Major emphasis was placed on the central nervous system (CNS), including neuroanatomical distribution of lesions, and the lymphoid system and lung were also examined. Eleven Guiana dolphins, 13 striped dolphins, and 3 bottlenose dolphins were selected by defined criteria. CeMV infections showed a remarkable neurotropism in striped dolphins and bottlenose dolphins, while this was a rare feature in CeMV-infected Guiana dolphins. Neuroanatomical distribution of lesions in dolphins stranded in the Canary Islands revealed a consistent involvement of the cerebrum, thalamus, and cerebellum, followed by caudal brainstem and spinal cord. In most cases, Guiana dolphins had more severe lung lesions. The lymphoid system was involved in all three species, with consistent lymphoid depletion. Multinucleate giant cells/syncytia and characteristic viral inclusion bodies were variably observed in these organs. Overall, there was widespread lymphohistiocytic, epithelial, and neuronal/neuroglial viral antigen immunolabeling with some individual, host species, and CeMV strain differences. Preexisting and opportunistic infections were common, particularly endoparasitism, followed by bacterial, fungal, and viral infections. These results contribute to understanding CeMV infections in susceptible cetacean hosts in relation to factors such as CeMV strains and geographic locations, thereby establishing the basis for future neuro- and immunopathological comparative investigations.",Gendered perceptions of fairness in housework and shared expenses: Implications for relationship satisfaction and sex frequency.,https://www.ncbi.nlm.nih.gov/pubmed/30893363,PloS one,2019 04 02,"There is a demonstrated relationship between couples' division of household chores-and, to a lesser extent, the division of shared expenses-and their relationship quality. Less is known, however, about whether and how individuals' perceived fairness of these arrangements is associated with couples' relationships in different ways. Using a gendered equity framework, and drawing on 10,236 responses collected via an online national news website, this study examines how equity evaluations of housework and shared expenses are related to relationship satisfaction and sex frequency among different-gender household partners. Consistent with previous findings, the results indicate that evaluations of unfairness to oneself are a stronger predictor of relationship quality than perceived unfairness to one's partner. Additionally, fairness evaluations over shared expenses are a stronger predictor of relationship quality than perceived equity in housework. Incorporating notions about traditional gender norms and expectations into the justice framework, the results point to some variation in relationship outcomes based on men's and women's differential equity evaluations.",Effects of ethanol and ethanol metabolites on intrinsic function of mesenteric resistance arteries.,https://www.ncbi.nlm.nih.gov/pubmed/30893362,PloS one,2019 04 04,"Evidence suggests that ethanol-induced hypertension is associated with increased cardiovascular responsiveness to vasopressors in vivo and enhanced reactivity of isolated arteries to vasopressors ex vivo. The underlying mechanisms are not well understood and the contribution of ethanol metabolites to vascular effects induced by ethanol consumption are unclear. Mesenteric resistance arteries were harvested from Sprague-Dawley rats. Pressure myography was utilized to test effects of ethanol, acetaldehyde and phosphatidylethanol on myogenic tone and on vasoconstriction induced by phenylephrine, arginine vasopressin (aVP), endothelin-1 and KCl. Ethanol, acetaldehyde and phosphatidylethanol concentrations were monitored during the experiments. Ethanol concentrations in the vessel bath decreased with a half-life of 25min; acetaldehyde and phosphatidylethanol concentrations remained constant. Pretreatment with ethanol dose-dependently increased the potency of phenylephrine to induce vasoconstriction 4-fold (p<0.01). These effects were comparable when arteries were pre-treated with a single dose of ethanol for 30min and when ethanol concentrations were kept constant during 30min and 60min of pretreatment. While ethanol also dose-dependently increased the potency of aVP to induce vasoconstriction 1.7-fold (p<0.05), it did not affect vasoconstriction induced by endothelin-1 or KCl. Acetaldehyde pre-treatment (30 min) dose-dependently increased the potency of phenylephrine to induce vasoconstriction 2.7-fold (p<0.01) but did not affect other vasoconstrictor responses. Phosphatidylethanol did not affect any vasoconstrictor responses. Ethanol and its metabolites did not affect myogenic tone. These data suggest that ethanol and acetaldehyde selectively sensitize intrinsic constrictor responses upon activation of vascular α1-adrenergic and/or vasopressin receptors at clinically relevant concentrations. Our findings support the concept that enhanced vasoreactivity to vasoactive hormones contributes to the development of hypertension induced by ethanol consumption. Ex vivo exposure of resistance arteries to ethanol and acetaldehyde resembles effects of chronic ethanol consumption on intrinsic vascular function, and thus could serve as test platform to evaluate interventions aimed to mitigate vascular effects associated with ethanol consumption.","Relationship among school socioeconomic status, teacher-student relationship, and middle school students' academic achievement in China: Using the multilevel mediation model.",https://www.ncbi.nlm.nih.gov/pubmed/30893361,PloS one,2019 04 02,"School socioeconomic status (SES) is studied primarily as a variable to explain academic achievement; however, few previous studies have investigated how SES can influence individual student's academic achievement. The present study used a national representative sample of 10,784 grade 7 to 9 students (53.2% boys and 46.8% girls) in mainland China to examine the links between school SES and students' math and Chinese achievements, including the math and Chinese teacher-student relationships as mediating factors. The parents provided family socioeconomic information and the students reported on their teacher-student relationships. Achievements in math and Chinese were assessed using standardized tests. Multilevel mediation analyses revealed that school SES was positively related to students' math and Chinese achievements. Moreover, the link between school SES and students' math achievement was partially mediated by students' perception of the math teacher-student relationship. The Chinese teacher-student relationship had no mediating effect. This study indicated that school SES can influence individual student's academic achievement via their perception of teacher-student relationship. The poverty and lack of resources is obvious, yet low SES schools could make efforts in improving teacher-student relationship's quality to promote students' academic performance. Meanwhile, low SES schools should receive more attention from policymakers to improve teaching quality and school climate. Furthermore, the study findings could be used for future research on the gap between low and high SES schools.",Exploring the unintended consequences of learning a new language at a South African university.,https://www.ncbi.nlm.nih.gov/pubmed/30893358,PloS one,2019 04 02,"This paper uses regression adjustment and entropy matching to achieve an appropriate balance between the two groups.

The virus shares homology with Hepaciviruses and therefore may be a cause of hepatitis. We sought to characterize ZIKV replication in hepatocyte-derived cell lines. Huh7.5 and HepG2 cells were infected with ZIKV and replication potential was evaluated by multiple methods including plaque assay, qRT-PCR, negative-strand ZIKV RNA production, and ZIKV NS1 protein production. Growth curves in cells and supernatant were compared to replicative capacity in Vero cells. Overall, viral replication in both hepatocyte lines approximated that observed in the Vero cells. Cell cytopathology was observed after 3 days of infection and apoptosis markers increased. Transmission electron microscopy revealed evidence of viral capsids in cells and negative staining revealed ZIKV particles in the supernatant. Conclusions: Hepatocyte-derived cell lines are permissive for ZIKV replication and produce an overt cytopathic effect consistent with development of an acute viral hepatitis. Further evaluation of replication and injury is warranted.","Incidence of community acquired pneumonia in children aged 2-59 months of age in Uttar Pradesh and Bihar, India, in 2016: An indirect estimation.",https://www.ncbi.nlm.nih.gov/pubmed/30893356,PloS one,2019 04 02,"Community Acquired Pneumonia (CAP) is the leading cause of mortality in children younger than five years of age in developing countries, including India.

The goal of this study is to propose an experimental design to analyze five emotions (disgust, fear, happiness, sadness and surprise) from facial thermal images of typically developing (TD) children aged 7-11 years using emissivity variation, as recorded by IRTI. For the emotion analysis, a dataset considered emotional dimensions (valence and arousal), facial bilateral sides and emotion classification accuracy. The results evidence the efficiency of the experimental design with interesting findings, such as the correlation between the valence and the thermal decrement in nose; disgust and happiness as potent triggers of facial emissivity variations; and significant emissivity variations in nose, cheeks and periorbital regions associated with different emotions. Moreover, facial thermal asymmetry was revealed with a distinct thermal tendency in the cheeks, and classification accuracy reached a mean value greater than 85%. From the results, the emissivity variations were an efficient marker to analyze emotions in facial thermal images, and IRTI was confirmed to be an outstanding technique to study emotions.

SSCs represent less than 1% of the total testicular cell population in adults, but must achieve a stable balance between self-renewal and differentiation. Once differentiation has occurred, the newly formed and highly proliferative spermatogonia must then enter the meiotic program in which DNA content is doubled, then halved twice to create haploid gametes. While much is known about the critical cellular processes that take place during the specialized cell division that is meiosis, much less is known about how the spermatocytes in the ""first-wave"" in juveniles compare to those that contribute to long-term, ""steady-state"" spermatogenesis in adults. Given the strictly-defined developmental process of spermatogenesis, this study explored the transcriptional profiles of developmental cell stages during testis maturation. Using a combination of comprehensive germ cell sampling with high-resolution, single-cell-mRNA-sequencing, we have generated a reference dataset of germ cell gene expression. We show that discrete developmental stages of spermatogenesis possess significant differences in the transcriptional profiles from neonates compared to juveniles and adults. Importantly, these gene expression dynamics are also reflected at the protein level in their respective cell types. We also show differential utilization of many biological pathways with age in both spermatogonia and spermatocytes, demonstrating significantly different underlying gene regulatory programs in these cell types over the course of testis development and spermatogenic waves. This dataset represents the first unbiased sampling of spermatogonia and spermatocytes during testis maturation, at high-resolution, single-cell depth. Not only does this analysis reveal previously unknown transcriptional dynamics of a highly transitional cell population, it has also begun to reveal critical differences in biological pathway utilization in developing spermatogonia and spermatocytes, including response to DNA damage and double-strand breaks.",Does opportunistic testing bias cognitive performance in primates? Learning from drop-outs.,https://www.ncbi.nlm.nih.gov/pubmed/30893340,PloS one,2019 04 02,"Dropouts are a common issue in cognitive tests with non-human primates. One main reason for dropouts is that researchers often face a trade-off between obtaining a sufficiently large sample size and logistic restrictions, such as limited access to testing facilities. The commonly-used opportunistic testing approach deals with this trade-off by only testing those individuals who readily participate and complete the cognitive tasks within a given time frame. All other individuals are excluded from further testing and data analysis. However, it is unknown if this approach merely excludes subjects who are not consistently motivated to participate, or if these dropouts systematically differ in cognitive ability. If the latter holds, the selection bias resulting from opportunistic testing would systematically affect performance scores and thus comparisons between individuals and species. We assessed the potential effects of opportunistic testing on cognitive performance in common marmosets (Callithrix jacchus) and squirrel monkeys (Saimiri sciureus) with a test battery consisting of six cognitive tests: two inhibition tasks (Detour Reaching and A-not-B), one cognitive flexibility task (Reversal Learning), one quantity discrimination task, and two memory tasks. Importantly, we used a full testing approach in which subjects were given as much time as they required to complete each task. For each task, we then compared the performance of subjects who completed the task within the expected number of testing days with those subjects who needed more testing time. We found that the two groups did not differ in task performance, and therefore opportunistic testing would have been justified without risking biased results. If our findings generalise to other species, maximising sample sizes by only testing consistently motivated subjects will be a valid alternative whenever full testing is not feasible.",Annual nitrification dynamics in a seasonally ice-covered lake.,https://www.ncbi.nlm.nih.gov/pubmed/30893339,PloS one,2019 04 02,"We investigated the variability in ammonia oxidation (AO) rates and the presence of ammonia-oxidizing archaea and bacteria (AOB and AOA) over an annual cycle in the water column of a small, seasonnally ice covered, temperate shield lake. AO, the first step of nitrification, was measured in situ using 15N-labelled ammonium (NH4+) at 1% and 10% of photosynthetic active radiation during day and at the same depths during night. AO was active across seasons and light levels, ranging from undetectable to 333 nmol L-1 d-1 with peak activity in winter under ice cover. NH4+ concentration was the single most important positive predictor of AO rates. High NH4+ concentrations and reduced chlorophyll a concentrations under ice, which favoured AO, were coherent with high nitrate concentrations and super saturation in nitrous oxide. When targeting the ammonia monooxygenase (amoA) gene in samples from the photic zone, we found AOA to be omnipresent throughout the year while AOB were observed predominantly during winter. Our results demonstrate that AO is an ongoing process in sunlit surface waters of temperate lakes and at all seasons with pronounced nitrification activity observed during winter under ice. The combination of high NH4+ concentrations due to fall overturn, reduced light availability that limited phytoplankton competition, and the presence of AOB together with AOA apparently favoured these elevated rates under ice. We suggest that lake ice could be a control point for nitrification in oligotrophic temperate shield lakes, characterized as a moment and place that exerts disproportionate influence on the biogeochemical behaviour of ecosystems.",In vitro larval rearing protocol for the stingless bee species Melipona scutellaris for toxicological studies.,https://www.ncbi.nlm.nih.gov/pubmed/30893338,PloS one,2019 04 02,"Brazil has the highest biodiversity of native stingless bees in the world. However, Brazilian regulations are based on protocols standardized by the Organization for Economic Cooperation and Development (OECD), which uses Apis mellifera as a model organism. The safety of the use of an exotic species as a substitute for a native species is a problem that concerns members of the academy and the government agencies responsible for studies of this nature in the neotropical regions where there are occurrences of stingless bee species. Regarding the exposure of larvae to pesticides, several indicators suggest that the same rearing method for A. mellifera cannot be applied to stingless bees, mainly because of their different feeding systems. Thus, it is necessary to establish an in vitro rearing method for native social bees. We developed a larval rearing method for the stingless bee species Melipona scutellaris and evaluated parameters such as the defecation rate, pupation, emergence, mortality and morphometry of the newly emerged workers. The control was represented by the morphometry of individuals that emerged from natural combs (in vivo). In addition, we determined the average lethal concentration (LC50) of the insecticide dimethoate, the standard active ingredient used for the validation of toxicity tests. Procedures conducted prior to the in vitro bioassays allowed us to obtain the actual dimensions of the rearing cells for making acrylic plates for use in establishing how much each larva consumes during its development, that is, determining how much larval food should be placed in every artificial cell. Tests performed with M. scutellaris indicated an average of 80.2% emergence of individuals relative to the larvae, 92.61% relative to the pupae and a mean of 7.42% larval mortality. The mean of the intertegular distance, head width and wing asymmetry parameters were not significantly different between individuals from the in vitro and in vivo rearing methods. The LC50 value determined was 27.48 ng dimethoate / μL diet. The method described for M. scutellaris showed development rates above OECD standards, which requires at least 75% emergence, and produced newly emerged workers with similar dimensions to those produced under natural conditions; thus these results enable their use as a rearing protocol for this species (or genus) and, consequently, their use in toxicity tests. The results produced with M. scutellaris are the first steps for a proposed toxicity test protocol for stingless bee larvae that can be standardized and included as a protocol in the OECD.",A cross-sectional survey on patient safety culture in secondary hospitals of Northeast China.,https://www.ncbi.nlm.nih.gov/pubmed/30893337,PloS one,2019 04 02,"This study aims to investigate patient safety culture in secondary hospitals of Heilongjiang, Northeast China, and explore the implications of patient safety culture and practices through the perspectives of various healthcare workers.","Epidemiologic profile of measles in Central African Republic: A nine year survey, 2007-2015.",https://www.ncbi.nlm.nih.gov/pubmed/30893336,PloS one,2019 04 02,"Measles remains a major public health problem in many developing countries in which vaccination coverage is poor, as is the case in the Central African Republic (CAR). At the beginning of the 2000s, a surveillance system was established in the country, and samples from suspected cases are regularly tested in the laboratory for serological confirmation. Since 2007, when case-by-case monitoring with standardized laboratory databases and monitoring, was set up, no assessment have been performed. Therfore, 9 years later it seemed appropriate to make a first assessment. The aim of the study reported here was to describe the epidemiology of measles in the CAR on the basis of surveillance and laboratory data.",Optimal regulation of blood glucose level in Type I diabetes using insulin and glucagon.,https://www.ncbi.nlm.nih.gov/pubmed/30893335,PloS one,2019 04 02,"The Glucose-Insulin-Glucagon nonlinear model accurately describes how the body responds to exogenously supplied insulin and glucagon in patients affected by Type I diabetes. Based on this model, we design infusion rates of either insulin (monotherapy) or insulin and glucagon (dual therapy) that can optimally maintain the blood glucose level within desired limits after consumption of a meal and prevent the onset of both hypoglycemia and hyperglycemia. This problem is formulated as a nonlinear optimal control problem, which we solve using the numerical optimal control package [Formula: see text]. Interestingly, in the case of monotherapy, we find the optimal solution is close to the standard method of insulin based glucose regulation, which is to assume a variable amount of insulin half an hour before each meal. We also find that the optimal dual therapy (that uses both insulin and glucagon) is better able to regulate glucose as compared to using insulin alone. We also propose an ad-hoc rule for both the dosage and the time of delivery of insulin and glucagon."

Two case studies: The skulls of Beremendia fissidens and Dolinasorex glyphodon.,https://www.ncbi.nlm.nih.gov/pubmed/30893322,PloS one,2019 04 02,"We have developed a protocol for reconstructing 3D models of the skulls of extinct species of small mammals. For the first time, the reconstruction uses fragments of fossils from a mixture of different specimens and from related extant species. We use free software and commercial computers to make the process reproducible and usable for the scientific community. We present a semi-quantitative protocol to face the problem of making 3D reconstructions of fossil species that are incomplete in the fossil record and/or represented by a mixture of different individuals, as usually occurs with small vertebrates. Therefore this approach is useful when no complete skull is available. The protocol combines the use of microCT scan technology with a subsequent computer treatment using different software tools for 3D reconstruction from microCT and 3D design and printing (e.g. Fiji, SPIERS, Meshlab, Meshmixer) in a defined order. This kind of free and relatively simple software, plus the detailed description, makes this protocol practicable for researchers who do not necessarily have great deal of experience in working with 3D. As an example, we have performed virtual reconstructions of the skulls of two species of insectivore small mammals (Eulipotyphla): Beremendia fissidens and Dolinasorex glyphodon. The resulting skulls, plus models of the extant shrews Blarina brevicauda, Neomys fodiens, Crocidura russula and Sorex coronatus, make it possible to compare characteristics that can only be observed by means of microCT 3D reconstructions, and given the characteristics of the material, using this protocol. Among the characters we can compare are the position of the mandibles, the spatial relations among all the teeth, the shape of the snout and, in general, all parameters related with the anatomy of the rostrum. Moreover, these reconstructions can be used in different types of context: for anatomical purposes, especially to see internal features or characteristics at whole-skull scale, for bioengineering, animation, or other techniques that need a digital model.",Yield performance of early-season rice cultivars grown in the late season of double-season crop production under machine-transplanted conditions.,https://www.ncbi.nlm.nih.gov/pubmed/30893321,PloS one,2019 04 02,"In order to solve the problem of labor shortage in double-season rice production areas, machine transplanting, as opposed to manual transplanting, has become the more popular alternative method in rice cultivation. However, the most existing late rice cultivars are not suitable for machine double-season rice cultivation due to their long duration of growth. Therefore, based on the previous studies we chose early season rice cultivars to meet the needs of machine double-season rice cultivation. In this study, field experiments were conducted during the late season in 2015 and 2016 in Liuyang County, Hunan Province, China. Grain yield and yield-related traits were compared among eight early-season cultivars (Liangyou 6, Lingliangyou 211, Lingliangyou 268, Zhuliangyou 819, Xiangzaoxian 32, Xiangzaoxian 42, Zhongjiazao 17, and Zhongzao 39) in 2015 and four cultivars (Lingliangyou 268, Zhuliangyou 819, Zhongjiazao 17, and Zhongzao 39) in 2016, selected from the highest yielding cultivars grown in 2015. Lingliangyou 268 produced 8-44% higher grain yield than did the other cultivars except Zhongjiazao17 in 2015. This higher grain yield was driven by grain weight and aboveground biomass. The greater aboveground biomass in Lingliangyou 268 was mainly attributed to higher apparent radiation use efficiency (aboveground biomass/incident solar radiation). Our study suggests that improvement in grain weight and apparent radiation use efficiency were critical to the high grain yield of early-season rice cultivars grown in late season under machine transplanting conditions.",The role of specialized hospital units in infection and mortality risk reduction among patients with hematological cancers.,https://www.ncbi.nlm.nih.gov/pubmed/30893320,PloS one,2019 04 02,Patients with hematological malignancies are susceptible to life-threatening infections after chemotherapy.

In Myanmar, the country met only 62% of its target for the maternal mortality rate (130 per 100,000 live birth) even though proportion of skilled birth attendant (SBA) and antenatal care (ANC) coverage was 80% in 2015. Despite the estimated large maternal complications, most maternal healthcare program ignored the burden of those morbidity because of limited understanding of the incidence and prevalence of morbidity conditions and cost of those morbidity burdens on society. The present study provides a general idea of the scope of obstetric complication, incidence of obstetric complication, and cost of those morbidity burdens on society. We conducted a retrospective incidence-based cost of illness study related to obstetric complication from the healthcare system perspective at 25 bedded township hospital in Yedashae during the fiscal year of 2015-2016. For the cost of obstetric complication, average treatment cost was 26.83 USD (±8.59). When looking by disease category, average treatment cost for incomplete abortion was 35.45 USD (±1.75); pelvic inflammatory disease (PID) was 16.01 USD; pregnancy-induced hypertension (PIH) was 21.02 USD (±4.68); ante-partum hemorrhage (APH) was 14.24(± 0.25); post-partum hemorrhage (PPH) was 27.04 USD (±1.56); prolonged labor was 37.55 USD (±0.42); and septicemia was 16.51 USD (±2.15). Significant predicting variables in obstetric complication cost model were incomplete abortion, prolonged labor, post-partum hemorrhage (PPH), pregnancy induced hypertension (PIH), patient age and septicemia. From this study, we can summarize the most frequently occurred obstetric complication in that township area, actual cost burden of those complications and obstetric complication cost model which can be useful for hospital financial management. This study can be considered as a starting point for cost of illness analysis in Myanmar to prioritize and target specific health problem at a country level for policy maker to set priorities for health care intervention.",Perceived stressors and coping mechanisms of female migrant domestic workers in Singapore.,https://www.ncbi.nlm.nih.gov/pubmed/30893317,PloS one,2019 04 02,"Worldwide, there are between 50-67 million migrant domestic workers, the majority of whom are women.

These women may be at risk of occupational and social stressors, including exploitation and abuse, which may negatively impact on their quality of life, including psychological health. Research examining the occupational, social, and psychological needs of FMDWs from a public health perspective is critical to guide the development of policies which ensure wellbeing, prevent abuse, and align with international priorities to improve population health. Though there have been a number of high-profile incidents of exploitation and abuse, there has been limited research on the stressors experienced by these communities, their perceived impact, or coping mechanisms.",Mitogenomes illuminate the origin and migration patterns of the indigenous people of the Canary Islands.,https://www.ncbi.nlm.nih.gov/pubmed/30893316,PloS one,2019 04 02,"The Canary Islands' indigenous people have been the subject of substantial archaeological, anthropological, linguistic and genetic research pointing to a most probable North African Berber source. However, neither agreement about the exact point of origin nor a model for the indigenous colonization of the islands has been established. To shed light on these questions, we analyzed 48 ancient mitogenomes from 25 archaeological sites from the seven main islands. Most lineages observed in the ancient samples have a Mediterranean distribution, and belong to lineages associated with the Neolithic expansion in the Near East and Europe (T2c, J2a, X3a…). This phylogeographic analysis of Canarian ancient mitogenomes, the first of its kind, shows that some lineages are restricted to Central North Africa (H1cf, J2a2d and T2c1d3), while others have a wider distribution, including both West and Central North Africa, and, in some cases, Europe and the Near East (U6a1a1, U6a7a1, U6b, X3a, U6c1). In addition, we identify four new Canarian-specific lineages (H1e1a9, H4a1e, J2a2d1a and L3b1a12) whose coalescence dates correlate with the estimated time for the colonization of the islands (1st millennia CE). Additionally, we observe an asymmetrical distribution of mtDNA haplogroups in the ancient population, with certain haplogroups appearing more frequently in the islands closer to the continent. This reinforces results based on modern mtDNA and Y-chromosome data, and archaeological evidence suggesting the existence of two distinct migrations. Comparisons between insular populations show that some populations had high genetic diversity, while others were probably affected by genetic drift and/or bottlenecks. In spite of observing interinsular differences in the survival of indigenous lineages, modern populations, with the sole exception of La Gomera, are homogenous across the islands, supporting the theory of extensive human mobility after the European conquest.",Deletion of Cdkn1b in ACI rats leads to increased proliferation and pregnancy-associated changes in the mammary gland due to perturbed systemic endocrine environment.,https://www.ncbi.nlm.nih.gov/pubmed/30893315,PLoS genetics,2019 04 29,"Mammary epithelial progenitors are the normal cell-of-origin of breast cancer. We previously defined a population of p27+ quiescent hormone-responsive progenitor cells in the normal human breast whose frequency associates with breast cancer risk. Here, we describe that deletion of the Cdkn1b gene encoding the p27 cyclin-dependent kinase inhibitor in the estrogen-induced mammary tumor-susceptible ACI rat strain leads to a decrease in the relative frequencies of Cd49b+ mammary luminal epithelial progenitors and pregnancy-related differentiation. We show by comprehensive gene expression profiling of purified progenitor and differentiated mammary epithelial cell populations that p27 deletion has the most pronounced effects on luminal progenitors. Cdkn1b-/- females have decreased fertility, but rats that are able to get pregnant had normal litter size and were able to nurse their pups implying that loss of p27 in ACI rats does not completely abrogate ovarian function and lactation. Reciprocal mammary gland transplantation experiments indicate that the p27-loss-induced changes in mammary epithelial cells are not only caused by alterations in their intrinsic properties, but are likely due to altered hormonal signaling triggered by the perturbed systemic endocrine environment observed in Cdkn1b-/- females. We also observed a decrease in the frequency of mammary epithelial cells positive for progesterone receptor (Pr) and FoxA1, known direct transcriptional targets of the estrogen receptor (Erα), and an increase in phospho-Stat5 positive cells commonly induced by prolactin (Prl). Characterization of genome-wide Pr chromatin binding revealed distinct binding patterns in mammary epithelial cells of Cdkn1b+/+ and Cdkn1b-/- females and enrichment in genes with known roles in Notch, ErbB, leptin, and Erα signaling and regulation of G1-S transition. Our data support a role for p27 in regulating the pool size of hormone-responsive luminal progenitors that could impact breast cancer risk.",A missense variant in FTCD is associated with arsenic metabolism and toxicity phenotypes in Bangladesh.,https://www.ncbi.nlm.nih.gov/pubmed/30893314,PLoS genetics,2019 06 10,"Inorganic arsenic (iAs) is a carcinogen, and exposure to iAs via food and water is a global public health problem. iAs-contaminated drinking water alone affects >100 million people worldwide, including ~50 million in Bangladesh. Once absorbed into the blood stream, most iAs is converted to mono-methylated (MMA) and then di-methylated (DMA) forms, facilitating excretion in urine. Arsenic metabolism efficiency varies among individuals, in part due to genetic variation near AS3MT (arsenite methyltransferase; 10q24.32). To identify additional arsenic metabolism loci, we measured protein-coding variants across the human exome for 1,660 Bangladeshi individuals participating in the Health Effects of Arsenic Longitudinal Study (HEALS). Among the 19,992 coding variants analyzed exome-wide, the minor allele (A) of rs61735836 (p.Val101Met) in exon 3 of FTCD (formiminotransferase cyclodeaminase) was associated with increased urinary iAs% (P = 8x10-13), increased MMA% (P = 2x10-16) and decreased DMA% (P = 6x10-23). Among 2,401 individuals with arsenic-induced skin lesions (an indicator of arsenic toxicity and cancer risk) and 2,472 controls, carrying the low-efficiency A allele (frequency = 7%) was associated with increased skin lesion risk (odds ratio = 1.35; P = 1x10-5). rs61735836 is in weak linkage disequilibrium with all nearby variants. The high-efficiency/major allele (G/Valine) is human-specific and eliminates a start codon at the first 5´-proximal Kozak sequence in FTCD, suggesting selection against an alternative translation start site. FTCD is critical for catabolism of histidine, a process that generates one-carbon units that can enter the one-carbon/folate cycle, which provides methyl groups for arsenic metabolism. In our study population, FTCD and AS3MT SNPs together explain ~10% of the variation in DMA% and support a causal effect of arsenic metabolism efficiency on arsenic toxicity (i.e., skin lesions). In summary, this work identifies a coding variant in FTCD associated with arsenic metabolism efficiency, providing new evidence supporting the established link between one-carbon/folate metabolism and arsenic toxicity.",Integration of breast cancer prevention and early detection into cancer palliative care model.,https://www.ncbi.nlm.nih.gov/pubmed/30893313,PloS one,2019 04 02,Breast cancer is common among Ghanaian women.
