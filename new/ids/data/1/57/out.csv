Although plasma-oxidized silver surfaces were found to display a considerably decreased overpotential for the production of CO, the hydrogen evolution reaction (HER), a competing reaction against CO2 reduction, was found to increase over time. More stable and C1-product-selective SnO x/AgO x catalysts were obtained by electrodepositing Sn on O2-plasma-pretreated Ag surfaces. In particular, a strong suppression of HER (below 5% Faradaic efficiency (FE) at -0.8 V vs the reversible hydrogen electrode, RHE) during 20 h was observed. Ex situ scanning electron microscopy (SEM) combined with energy-dispersive X-ray spectroscopy (EDS), quasi in situ X-ray photoelectron spectroscopy (XPS), and operando X-ray absorption near-edge structure spectroscopy (XANES) measurements showed that our synthesis led to a highly roughened surface containing stable Snδ+/Sn species that were found to be key in the enhanced activity and stable CO/formate (HCOO-) selectivity. Our study highlights the importance of roughness, composition, and chemical state effects in CO2 electrocatalysis.",Discovery of Isaindigotone Derivatives as Novel Bloom's Syndrome Protein (BLM) Helicase Inhibitors That Disrupt the BLM/DNA Interactions and Regulate the Homologous Recombination Repair.,https://www.ncbi.nlm.nih.gov/pubmed/30827110,Journal of medicinal chemistry,2019 03 28,"Homologous recombination repair (HRR), a crucial approach in DNA damage repair, is an attractive target in cancer therapy and drug design. The Bloom syndrome protein (BLM) is a 3'-5' DNA helicase that performs an important role in HRR regulation. However, limited studies about BLM inhibitors and their biological effects have been reported. Here, we identified a class of isaindigotone derivatives as novel BLM inhibitors by synthesis, screening, and evaluating. Among them, compound 29 was found as an effective BLM inhibitor with a high binding affinity and good inhibitory effect on BLM. Cellular evaluation indicated that 29 effectively disrupted the recruitment of BLM at DNA double-strand break sites, promoted an accumulation of RAD51, and regulated the HRR process. Meanwhile, 29 significantly induced DNA damage responses, as well as apoptosis and proliferation arrest in cancer cells. Our finding provides a potential anticancer strategy based on interfering with BLM via small molecules.",Electrochemical Measurements of Reactive Oxygen and Nitrogen Species inside Single Phagolysosomes of Living Macrophages.,https://www.ncbi.nlm.nih.gov/pubmed/30827109,Journal of the American Chemical Society,2019 03 20,"The release of reactive oxygen and nitrogen species (ROS/RNS) by macrophages undergoing phagocytosis is crucial for the efficiency of the immune system. In this work, platinized carbon nanoelectrodes were used to detect, characterize, and quantify for the first time the intracellular production rates of the four primary ROS/RNS (i.e., H2O2, ONOO-, NO•, and NO2-) inside single phagolysosomes of living RAW 264.7 murine macrophages stimulated by interferon-γ and lipopolysaccharide (IFN-γ/LPS) to mimic an in vivo inflammatory activation. The time-dependent concentrations of the four primary ROS/RNS in individual phagolysosomes monitored using a four-step chronoamperometric method evidenced a high variability of their production rates. This intrinsic variability unravels the complexity of phagocytosis.",Ursolic Acid Isolated from the Leaves of Loquat ( Eriobotrya japonica) Inhibited Osteoclast Differentiation through Targeting Exportin 5.,https://www.ncbi.nlm.nih.gov/pubmed/30827108,Journal of agricultural and food chemistry,2019 04 15,"One of the conventional strategies for treating osteoporosis is to eliminate the multinucleated osteoclasts that are responsible for bone resorption. Our previous study revealed that ursolic acid, isolated from leaves of loquat that is used as tasty tea in Japan, suppressed osteoclastogenesis. We confirmed that ursolic acid exhibited osteoclast differentiation inhibitory activity with an 50% inhibitory concentration (IC50) value of 5.4 ± 0.96 μM. To disclose its mechanism of action, this study first uses polymer-coated magnetic nanobeads to identify potential target proteins. As a result, we identified a nuclear exporter protein named exportin 5 (XPO5). Further studies demonstrated that knockdown of XPO5 significantly blocks osteoclast differentiation ( P < 0.01). Expression profiling of mature microRNAs in the cells revealed that downregulation of XPO5 by small interfering RNA or by ursolic acid could downregulate the expression of mature microRNA let-7g-5p during osteoclast differentiation ( P < 0.01). Collectively, our findings suggest that ursolic acid inhibits osteoclast differentiation through targeting XPO5, which provides further evidence for the healthy function of the tea. This study also provides new insights into the role of XPO5 and its mediated microRNAs in treatment for bone resorption diseases.",Stabilization and Extraction of Fluoride Anion Using a Tetralactam Receptor.,https://www.ncbi.nlm.nih.gov/pubmed/30827107,The Journal of organic chemistry,2019 04 05,"A neutral tetralactam macrocycle was prepared in a few minutes in one pot and at high concentration using commercially available starting materials. NMR titration studies in DMSO revealed an anion affinity order of F- > AcO- > Cl- > Br-. The receptor affinity for F- is very high due in part to formation of a self-complementary dimer comprised of two ""saddle shaped"" complexes. An X-ray crystal structure showed that the two F- ions within the dimer are separated by 3.39 Å. The electrostatic penalty for this close proximity is compensated by attractive interactions provided by the surrounding tetralactam molecules. Reactivity experiments showed that stabilization of F- as a supramolecular complex abrogated its capacity to induce elimination and substitution chemistry. This finding raises the idea of using tetralactam macrocycles to stabilize fluoride-containing liquid electrolytes within redox devices such as room-temperature fluoride-ion batteries. A lipophilic version of the tetralactam macrocycle was prepared and used to extract F- from water into a chloroform layer with high efficiency. The favorable extraction is due to the architecture of the extracted dimeric complex, with all the polarity located within the core of the self-associated dimer and all the nonpolar functionality on the exterior surface.",Effective Mechanism of (-)-Epigallocatechin Gallate Indicating the Critical Formation Conditions of Amadori Compound during an Aqueous Maillard Reaction.,https://www.ncbi.nlm.nih.gov/pubmed/30827106,Journal of agricultural and food chemistry,2019 04 15,"The formation conditions of the Amadori compound (ARP) N-(1-deoxy-d-xylulos-1-yl)-alanine were determined in an aqueous Maillard reaction between l-alanine and d-xylose under a two-step temperature rising process with (-)-epigallocatechin gallate (EGCG) as an indicator followed by browning intensity detection of the final Maillard reaction products (MRPs). To clarify the mechanism of EGCG indication on the ARP formation, the change in the concentration of some key products generated during the Maillard reaction with EGCG addition was investigated. Results showed an inhibition effect of EGCG on the browning precursor formation through the generation of ARP-EGCG adducts and deoxyosone-EGCG adducts, which was proposed as an important pathway to inhibit browning during the Maillard reaction and to indicate ARP formation.",Fluorination of Photoswitchable Muscarinic Agonists Tunes Receptor Pharmacology and Photochromic Properties.,https://www.ncbi.nlm.nih.gov/pubmed/30827105,Journal of medicinal chemistry,2019 03 28,"Red-shifted azobenzene scaffolds have emerged as useful molecular photoswitches to expand potential applications of photopharmacological tool compounds. As one of them, tetra- ortho-fluoro azobenzene is well compatible for the design of visible-light-responsive systems, providing stable and bidirectional photoconversions and tissue-compatible characteristics. Using the unsubstituted azobenzene core and its tetra- ortho-fluorinated analogue, we have developed a set of uni- and bivalent photoswitchable toolbox derivatives of the highly potent muscarinic acetylcholine receptor agonist iperoxo. We investigated the impact of the substitution pattern on receptor activity and evaluated the different binding modes. Compounds 9b and 15b show excellent photochemical properties and biological activity as fluorination of the azobenzene core alters not only the photochromic behavior but also the pharmacological profile at the muscarinic M1 receptor. These findings demonstrate that incorporation of fluorinated azobenzenes not just may alter photophysical properties but can exhibit a considerably different biological profile that has to be carefully investigated.","Hesperetin and Hesperidin Improved β-Carotene Incorporation Efficiency, Intestinal Cell Uptake, and Retinoid Concentrations in Tissues.",https://www.ncbi.nlm.nih.gov/pubmed/30827104,Journal of agricultural and food chemistry,2019 04 15,"Dietary constituents can influence the bioavailability of carotenoids. This study investigated the effect of citrus flavanones on β-carotene (Bc) bioavailability using four experimental models: in vitro digestion procedure, synthetic mixed micelles, Caco-2 cell monolayers, and gavage experiments in mice. The addition of hesperetin (Hes, 25 μM) and hesperidin (Hes-G, 25 μM) standards significantly increased the incorporation efficiency of the Bc standard to 68.7 ± 3.6 and 75.2 ± 7.5% ( p < 0.05), respectively. However, the addition of naringenin (Nar, 25 μM) and naringin (Nar-G, 25 μM) standards significantly reduced the incorporation efficiency of Bc by 23.8 and 26.4%, respectively ( p < 0.05). The increases in scavenger receptor class B type I (SR-BI) expression promoted by citrus flavanones played an important role in Bc cellular absorption in the Caco-2 cell model. Furthermore, after 3 days of gavage, four citrus flavanones (7.5 mg kg-1 day-1) increased the retinoid concentrations in tissues; in contrast, after 7 days of gavage, Nar and Nar-G significantly decreased hepatic retinoid concentrations ( p < 0.05). This finding suggested that the incorporation efficiency into micelles was the main step governing carotenoid bioavailability.",Regioselective Photocycloaddition of Saccharin Anion to π-Systems: Continuous-Flow Synthesis of Benzosultams.,https://www.ncbi.nlm.nih.gov/pubmed/30827103,The Journal of organic chemistry,2019 04 05,"Saccharin is a versatile scaffold to build up different heterocycles with relevance in asymmetric catalysis, agricultural chemistry, medicinal chemistry, and so forth. Here, we report a photochemical strategy to obtain seven-membered ring benzosultams in one step, using saccharin anion as starting material. The reaction can be improved in a photoflow reactor and its scope was evaluated.

However, endogenous glycopeptides are usually submerged in complex fluids containing a wide variety of interference molecules, such as high concentration proteins, nonglycopeptides, and salts, which confounds attempts to identify glycopeptidome. Here, a dual-hydrophilic metal-organic framework is developed to selectively capture endogenous glycopeptides in complex biological fluid. The hydrophilic matrix material provides specific selectivity toward glycopeptides, while the deliberate surface regulation using hydrophilic species enhances its interaction with glycopeptides. This hydrophilic probe presents an extremely high performance in anti-interfering enrichment of glycopeptides from mimic complex samples, even when the molar ratio of immunoglobulin G versus bovine serum albumin was up to about 1:5000. More excitingly, in the practical application of glycopeptidome analysis, a total of 380 endogenous N-glycopeptides with 180 unique N-glycopeptide sites were identified from human plasma. This strategy is expected to broaden the application of dual-hydrophilic MOF-based materials, especially in dealing with the challenges of extremely complex biological samples.","Ni(I)-X Complexes Bearing a Bulky α-Diimine Ligand: Synthesis, Structure, and Superior Catalytic Performance in the Hydrogen Isotope Exchange in Pharmaceuticals.",https://www.ncbi.nlm.nih.gov/pubmed/30827090,Journal of the American Chemical Society,2019 03 27,"The synthesis and spectroscopic characterization of a family of Ni-X (X = Cl, Br, I, H) complexes supported by the bulky α-diimine chelate N, N'-bis(1 R,2 R,3 R,5 S)-(-)-isopinocampheyl-2,3-butanediimine (ipcADI) are described. Diimine-supported, three-coordinate nickel(I)-X complexes have been proposed as key intermediates in a host of catalytic transformations such as C-C and C-heteroatom cross-coupling and C-H functionalization but have until now remained synthetically elusive. A combination of structural, spectroscopic, electrochemical, and computational studies were used to establish the electronic structure of each monomeric [(ipcADI)NiX] (X = Cl, Br, I) complex as a nickel(I) derivative supported by a redox-neutral α-diimine chelate. The dimeric nickel hydride, [(ipcADI)Ni(μ2-H)]2, was prepared and characterized by X-ray diffraction; however, magnetic measurements and 1H NMR spectroscopy support monomer formation at ambient temperature in THF solution. This nickel hydride was used as a precatalyst for the hydrogen isotope exchange (HIE) of C-H bonds in arenes and pharmaceuticals. By virtue of the multisite reactivity and high efficiency, the new nickel precatalyst provided unprecedented high specific activities (50-99 Ci/mmol) in radiolabeling, meeting the threshold required for radioligand binding assays. Use of air-stable and readily synthesized nickel precursor, [(ipcADI)NiBr2], broad functional group tolerance, and compatibility with polar protic solvents are additional assets of the nickel-catalyzed HIE method.",Rapid Degradation of Oil in Mesocosm Simulations of Marine Oil Snow Events.,https://www.ncbi.nlm.nih.gov/pubmed/30827089,Environmental science & technology,2019 04 02,"Following the Deepwater Horizon oil spill in the Gulf of Mexico, natural marine snow interacted with oil and dispersants forming marine oil snow (MOS) that sank from the water column to sediments. Mesocosm simulations demonstrate that Macondo surrogate oil incorporates into MOS and can be isolated, extracted, and analyzed via Fourier transform ion cyclotron resonance mass spectrometry (FTICR-MS). Up to 47% of the FTICR-MS signal from MOS extracts can be attributed to formulas also found in Macondo surrogate oil demonstrating extensive oil incorporation. Additionally, oxygenation patterns for MOS extracts provide evidence for degraded oil compounds. Formulas having similar double bond equivalents but higher oxygen content (MOS CHO: CHO2-9, DBE2-16, MOS CHON: CHO0-7N1, DBE9-18; Macondo CHO: CHO1-4, DBE2-15, CHON: CHO0-3N1, DBE9-21) were found in MOS extracts generating isoabundance distributions similar to those of environmentally aged oil. Such shifts in molecular composition are consistent with the transformation of high DBE oil components, unobservable by FTICR-MS until oxygenation in the mesocosms. Low light conditions and the rapid proliferation of hydrocarbon-degraders observed in parallel studies suggest biological activity as the primary cause of oil degradation. MOS may thus represent an important microenvironment for oil degradation especially during its long transit below the euphotic zone to sediments.",Microsampling Capillary Electrophoresis Mass Spectrometry Enables Single-Cell Proteomics in Complex Tissues: Developing Cell Clones in Live Xenopus laevis and Zebrafish Embryos.,https://www.ncbi.nlm.nih.gov/pubmed/30827088,Analytical chemistry,2019 04 02,"Label-free single-cell proteomics by mass spectrometry (MS) is currently incompatible with complex tissues without requiring cell culturing, single-cell dissection, or tissue dissociation. We here report the first example of label-free single-cell MS-based proteomics directly in single cells in live vertebrate embryos. Our approach integrates optically guided in situ subcellular capillary microsampling, one-pot extraction-digestion of the collected proteins, peptide separation by capillary electrophoresis, ionization by an ultrasensitive electrokinetically pumped nanoelectrospray, and detection by high-resolution MS (Orbitrap). With a 700 zmol (420 000 copies) lower limit of detection, this trace-sensitive technology confidently identified and quantified ∼750-800 protein groups (<1% false-discovery rate) by analyzing just ∼5 ng of protein digest, viz. <0.05% of the total protein content from individual cells in a 16-cell Xenopus laevis (frog) embryo. After validating the approach by recovering animal-vegetal-pole proteomic asymmetry in the frog zygote, the technology was applied to uncover proteomic reorganization as the animal-dorsal (D11) cell of the 16-cell embryo gave rise to its neural-tissue-fated clone in the embryo developing to the 32-, 64-, and 128-cell stages. In addition to enabling proteomics on smaller cells in X. laevis, we also demonstrated this technology to be scalable to single cells in live zebrafish embryos. Microsampling single-cell MS-based proteomics raises exciting opportunities to study cell and developmental processes directly in complex tissues and whole organisms at the level of the building block of life: the cell.",Technical improvements in carotid revascularization based on the mechanism of procedural stroke.,https://www.ncbi.nlm.nih.gov/pubmed/30827087,The Journal of cardiovascular surgery,2019 06 13,"The benefit of carotid revascularization in patients with severe carotid artery stenosis is hampered by the risk of stroke due to the intervention itself. The risk of periprocedural strokes is higher for carotid artery stenting (CAS) as compared to carotid endarterectomy (CEA). Over the past years, the pathophysiological mechanism responsible for periprocedural stroke seems to unfold step by step. Initially, all procedural strokes were thought to be the result of technical errors during surgical repair: cerebral ischemia due to clamping time of the carotid artery, cerebral embolization of atherosclerotic debris due to manipulation of the atheroma or thrombosis of the artery. Following improvements in surgical techniques, technical skills, new intraoperative monitoring technologies such as angioscopy, and the results of the first large clinical randomized controlled trials (RCT) it was believed that most periprocedural strokes were of thromboembolic nature, while a large part of these caused by technical error. Nowadays, analyses of underlying pathophysiological mechanisms of procedural stroke make a clinically relevant distinction between intra-procedural and postprocedural strokes. Intra-procedural stroke is defined as hypoperfusion due to clamping (CEA) or dilatation (CAS) and embolization from the carotid plaque (both CEA and CAS). Postprocedural stroke can be caused by thrombo-embolisation but seems to have a primarily hemodynamic origin. Besides thrombotic occlusion of the carotid artery, cerebral hyperperfusion syndrome (CHS) due to extensively increased cerebral revascularization is the most reported pathophysiological mechanism of postprocedural stroke. Multiple technical improvements have attempted to lower the risk of periprocedural stroke. The introduction of antiplatelet therapy (APT) has significantly reduced the risk of thromboembolic events in patients with carotid stenosis. Over the years, recommendations regarding APT changed. While for a long time APT was discontinued prior to surgery because of a fear of increased bleeding risk, nowadays continuation of APT during carotid intervention (aspirin monotherapy or even dual APT including clopidogrel) is found to be safe and effective. In CAS patients, dual APT up to three months' postprocedural is considered best. Stent design and cerebral protection devices (CPD) for CAS procedure are continuously under development. Trials have suggested a benefit of closed-cell stent design over open-cell stent design in order to reduce procedural stroke, while the benefit of CPD during stenting is still a matter of debate. Although CPD reduce the risk of procedural stroke, a higher number of new ischemic brain lesions detected on diffusion weighted imaging was found in patients treated with CPD. In patients undergoing CEA under general anesthesia, adequate use of cerebral monitoring (EEG and transcranial Doppler [TCD]) has reduced the number of intraoperative stroke by detecting embolization and thereby guiding the surgeon to adjust his technique or to selectively shunt the carotid artery. In addition, TCD is able to adequately identify and exclude patients at risk for CHS. For CAS, the additional value of periprocedural cerebral monitoring to prevent strokes needs urgent attention. In conclusion, this review provides an overview of the pathophysiological mechanism of stroke following carotid revascularization (both CAS and CEA) and of the technical improvements that have contributed to reducing this stroke risk.",The most relevant unmet needs in endovascular management of descending thoracic aorta.,https://www.ncbi.nlm.nih.gov/pubmed/30827086,The Journal of cardiovascular surgery,2019 06 13,"Endovascular repair of descending thoracic aorta (DTA) is considered as first interventional option for most part of the aortic disorders. However, many unmet needs and issues are still limiting its applicability. One of the major limitations is related to the existing gaps in evidence. Clear and robust evidence is still needed in many aspects of the management of DTA pathologies. In numerous clinical scenarios, adequate trials are lacking. Besides those gaps in evidence, it is well recognized that thoracic endografting (TEVAR) is technically evolving in order to overcome technical and device-related complications and limitations. We can deploy endografts in any aortic segment: in the descending, in the ascending, in the arch, even preserving aortic branches. Nevertheless, from the pure technical point of view, current generations of endografts still need more development and improvement. Durability remains the major concern for any endovascular treatment, and thoracic endografting is not an exception. As Galenus said, the physician is only nature's assistant, thoracic endograft should also follow the natural anatomy instead of fighting against it. We will focus the following pages on the graft conformability and compliance, both related to durability and safety of thoracic endografting. We will review the current knowledge and concerns associated with the anatomical and hemodynamic modifications induced by the thoracic endograft strength, stiffness and straightness and their implications for the future thoracic endograft designs.",Clinical and surrogate endpoints in future studies on outcome of carotid revascularization.,https://www.ncbi.nlm.nih.gov/pubmed/30827085,The Journal of cardiovascular surgery,2019 06 13,This paper will provide a comparison of classical endpoints like stroke and mortality versus biochemical (non-STEMI) myocardial infarction and DW-MRI new brain lesions and will discuss the importance of cranial nerve lesion in CEA.

During normal defecation the IAS relaxes. Historically, tone generation in gastrointestinal muscles was attributed to mechanisms arising directly from smooth muscle cells, ie, myogenic activity. However, slow waves are now known to play a fundamental role in regulating gastrointestinal motility and these electrical events are generated by the interstitial cells of Cajal. Recently, interstitial cells of Cajal, as well as slow waves, have also been identified in the IAS making them viable candidates for tone generation. In this review we discuss four different mechanisms that likely contribute to tone generation in the IAS. Three of these involve membrane potential, L-type Ca2+ channels and electromechanical coupling (ie, summation of asynchronous phasic activity, partial tetanus, and window current), whereas the fourth involves the regulation of myofilament Ca2+ sensitivity. Contractile activity in the IAS is also modulated by sympathetic motor neurons that significantly increase tone and anal pressure, as well as inhibitory motor neurons (particularly nitrergic and vasoactive intestinal peptidergic) that abolish contraction and assist with normal defecation. Alterations in IAS motility are associated with disorders such as fecal incontinence and anal fissures that significantly decrease the quality of life. Understanding in greater detail how tone is regulated in the IAS is important for developing more effective treatment strategies for these debilitating defecation disorders.",Deleted in Liver Cancer 2 (DLC2) protein expression in hepatocellular carcinoma.,https://www.ncbi.nlm.nih.gov/pubmed/30827083,European journal of histochemistry : EJH,2019 05 13,"Deleted in Liver Cancer (DLC) proteins belong to the family of RhoGAPs and are believed to operate as negative regulators of the Rho family of small GTPases. So far, the role of the first identified member from the DLC family, DLC1, was established as a tumor suppressor in hepatocellular carcinoma. The function of its close family relative, DLC2 is unequivocal. In the present study we attempted to determine whether the loss of DLC2 is a common feature of hepatocellular carcinoma tissue. We examined two types of hepatocellular carcinoma- typical and fibrolamellar one. Our analysis revealed that DLC2 protein is not diminished in cancer tissue when compared to non-cancerous liver specimens. What is more, we observed DLC2 to be more abundantly expressed in cancer tissue, particularly in tumors with the inflammation background. In addition, we found that DLC2 gene status was diploid in virtually all tumor samples examined. Our results indicate that DLC2 is not diminished in hepatocellular carcinoma cells. It appears that members of the DLC family, although structurally highly related, may function differently in cancer cells.","Immunohistochemical distribution of insulin-, glucagon- and somatostatin-containing cells in the pancreas of Lake Van fish (Alburnus tarichi Güldenstädt, 1814) (Cyprinidae).",https://www.ncbi.nlm.nih.gov/pubmed/30827082,European journal of histochemistry : EJH,2019 04 09,"The Lake Van fish (Alburnus tarichi) is a species that is endemic to Turkey's Lake Van basin. In this study, the regional distribution, volume density, and relative frequency of some pancreatic endocrine cells in Lake Van fish were investigated via immunohistochemistry using specific mammalian antibodies. The pancreatic tissue was observed to be surrounded by adipose tissue, which was adjacent to the gall bladder or extrahepatic bile duct, or dispersed in the adipose tissue ranked among coils of post-esophageal swelling and intestine. The pancreatic endocrine cells were examined, including the islets, exocrine pancreas, and pancreatic ducts. According to the modified aldehyde fuchsin staining and immunohistochemistry, insulin-secreting beta cells were observed to localize throughout the islets. Glucagon immune-reactive (IR) cells were observed to be situated moderately on the islet periphery, and were rarely determined in the islet central region. A small number of somatostatin-IR cells were observed in the islet centers and peripheries. Similar distributions of those 3 endocrine cells were also determined in the secondary islets. Additionally, the endocrine cell percentages did not differ between the primary and secondary islets; insulin-, glucagon- and somatostatin-IR cells comprised approximately 54%, 29%, and 11% of the endocrine cells in the principal islets, whereas they comprised 52%, 27%, and 14% in the secondary islets, respectively.

Methods We recruited children aged 5-16 years with all three types of trisomy, and divided them into a High Bias group, identified in the course of investigations for neurodevelopmental problems, and a Low Bias group, identified via prenatal screening or other medical investigations. Children from a twin sample were used to compare pattern and severity of language problems: they were subdivided according to parental concerns about language/history of speech-language therapy into a No Concerns group (N = 118) and a Language Concerns group (N = 57). Children were assessed on a psychometric battery and a standardized parent checklist. After excluding children with intellectual disability, autism or hearing problems, the sample included 28 XXX, 18 XXY and 14 XYY Low Bias cases and 7 XXX, 13 XXY and 17 XYY High Bias cases. Results Variation within each trisomy group was substantial: within the Low Bias group, overall language scores were depressed relative to normative data, but around one third had no evidence of problems. There was no effect of trisomy type, and the test profile was similar to the Language Concerns comparison group. The rate of problems was much greater in the High Bias children with trisomies. Conclusions When advising parents after discovery of a trisomy, it is important to emphasise that, though there is an increased risk of language problems, there is a very wide range of outcomes. Severe language problems are more common in those identified via genetic testing for neurodevelopmental problems but these are not characteristic of children identified on prenatal screening.",A physiological examination of perceived incorporation during trance.,https://www.ncbi.nlm.nih.gov/pubmed/30815253,F1000Research,2019 03 04,"Background: Numerous world cultures believe channeling provides genuine information, and channeling rituals in various forms are regularly conducted in both religious and non-religious contexts. Little is known about the physiological correlates of the subjective experience of channeling. Methods: We conducted a prospective within-subject design study with 13 healthy adult trance channels. Participants alternated between 5-minute blocks of channeling and no-channeling three times while electroencephalography (EEG), electrocardiography (ECG), galvanic skin response (GSR), and respiration were collected on two separate days. Voice recordings of the same story read in channeling and no-channeling states were also analyzed.   Results: The pre-laboratory survey data about demographics, perception of the source, purpose and utility of channeled information reflected previous reports. Most participants were aware of their experience (rather than in a full trance) and had varying levels of perceived incorporation (i.e. control of their body). Voice analysis showed an increase in voice arousal and power (dB/Hz) differences in the 125 Hz bins between 0 and 625 Hz, and 3625 and 3875 Hz when reading during the channeling state versus control. Despite subjective perceptions of distinctly different states, no substantive differences were seen in EEG frequency power, ECG measures, GSR and respiration. Conclusions: Voice parameters were different between channeling and no-channeling states using rigorous controlled methods, but other physiology measure collected were not. Considering the subjective and phenomenological differences observed, future studies should include other measures such as EEG connectivity analyses, fMRI and biomarkers.","It's the network, stupid: a population's sexual network connectivity determines its STI prevalence.",https://www.ncbi.nlm.nih.gov/pubmed/30815252,F1000Research,2019 05 22,"There is little consensus as to why sexually transmitted infections (STIs), including HIV and bacterial vaginosis (BV) are more prevalent in some populations than others. Using a broad definition of sexual network connectivity that includes both structural and conductivity-related factors, we argue that the available evidence suggests that high prevalence of traditional STIs, HIV and BV can be parsimoniously explained by these populations having more connected sexual networks. Positive feedback, whereby BV and various STIs enhance the spread of other STIs, then further accentuates the spread of BV, HIV and other STIs. We review evidence that support this hypothesis and end by suggesting study designs that could further evaluate the hypothesis, as well as implications of this hypothesis for the prevention and management of STIs.",Comparative study of commercially available and homemade anti-VAMP7 antibodies using CRISPR/Cas9-depleted HeLa cells and VAMP7 knockout mice.,https://www.ncbi.nlm.nih.gov/pubmed/30815249,F1000Research,2019 05 22,"VAMP7 (vesicle-associated membrane protein) belongs to the intracellular membrane fusion SNARE (Soluble N-ethylmaleimide-sensitive factor attachment protein receptors) protein family.

We propose a simple profiling method to analyze western blotting and use visual scoring for immunocytochemistry staining to determine the extent of the antibodies' specificity. Thus, we were able to rank the performance of a set of available antibodies and further showed an optimized procedure for VAMP7 immunoprecipitation, which we validated using wild-type and KO mouse brain extracts.",Purchase of medications without prescription in Peru: a cross-sectional population-based study.,https://www.ncbi.nlm.nih.gov/pubmed/30800287,F1000Research,2019 05 21,"Background: Low availability of medicines in health services, self-medication, inadequate use of medicines, and inadequate dispensing practices in pharmacies are frequent problems in Peru. We aimed to evaluate how frequent the purchase of medications without medical prescription is in Peru, and which factors are associated with this practice. Methods: We conducted a secondary analysis of the 2016 ENSUSALUD national survey data. Purchase of one or more medicines that require a prescription was measured as a dichotomous variable. Crude and adjusted prevalence ratios (PR) and their 95% confidence intervals (95% CI) were calculated using Poisson regressions model with robust variance to assess the association of purchasing of medicines that require prescriptions with sociodemographic factors. Results: There were 3858 participants in the dataset. The prevalence of purchasing medications without prescriptions was 47.2%. History of having previously consumed the same medication (31.6%), and the delay in receiving an appointment at health facilities (26.9%) were the main reasons to buy medications without a prescription. Regarding the recommendation of the medication purchased, the advice of the pharmacy, and remembering a previous old prescription, were the most frequent reasons (38.3%, and 25.9%, respectively). On the multivariable analysis, users that buy medications without prescription were more likely to be of aged 25-44; reside in the Jungle  and Highlands regions; and self-consumption of the purchase. Individuals with Seguro Integral de Salud (Comprehensive Health Insurance) were less likely to buy medications without prescription. Conclusions: There is a high prevalence of prescription requiring medication being bought without one from pharmacies in Peru. It is necessary to include the evaluation of consumer patterns to develop strategies with the aim to regulate the consumption of prescription drugs in the Peruvian population.",Research and development of new tuberculosis vaccines: a review.,https://www.ncbi.nlm.nih.gov/pubmed/30613395,F1000Research,2019 05 22,"Tuberculosis kills more people worldwide than any other single infectious disease agent, a threat made more dire by the spread of drug-resistant strains of Mycobacterium tuberculosis (Mtb). Development of new vaccines capable of preventing TB disease and new Mtb infection are an essential component of the strategy to combat the TB epidemic. Accordingly, the WHO considers the development of new TB vaccines a major public health priority. In October 2017, the WHO convened a consultation with global leaders in the TB vaccine development field to emphasize the WHO commitment to this effort and to facilitate creative approaches to the discovery and development of TB vaccine candidates. This review summarizes the presentations at this consultation, updated with scientific literature references, and includes discussions of the public health need for a TB vaccine; the status of efforts to develop vaccines to replace or potentiate BCG in infants and develop new TB vaccines for adolescents and adults; strategies being employed to diversify vaccine platforms; and new animal models being developed to facilitate TB vaccine development.

Support for more analysis programs has been added over time. Currently, Mega2 converts data from several different genetic data formats (including PLINK, VCF, BCF, and IMPUTE2) into the specific data requirements for over 40 commonly-used linkage and association analysis programs (including Mendel, Merlin, Morgan, SHAPEIT, ROADTRIPS, MaCH/minimac3). Recently, Mega2 has been enhanced to use a SQLite database as an intermediate data representation. Additionally, Mega2 now stores bialleleic genotype data in a highly compressed form, like that of the GenABEL R package and the PLINK binary format. Our new Mega2R package now makes it easy to load Mega2 SQLite databases directly into R as data frames. In addition, Mega2R is memory efficient, keeping its genotype data in a compressed format, portions of which are only expanded when needed. Mega2R has functions that ease the process of applying gene-based tests by looping over genes, efficiently pulling out genotypes for variants within the desired boundaries. We have also created several more functions that illustrate how to use the data frames: these permit one to run the pedgene package to carry out gene-based association tests on family data, to run the SKAT package to carry out gene-based association tests, to output the Mega2R data as a VCF file and related files (for phenotype and family data), and to convert the data frames into GenABEL format. The Mega2R package enhances GenABEL since it supports additional input data formats (such as PLINK, VCF, and IMPUTE2) not currently supported by GenABEL. The Mega2 program and the Mega2R R package are both open source and are freely available, along with extensive documentation, from https://watson.hgen.pitt.edu/register for Mega2 and https://CRAN.R-project.org/package=Mega2R for Mega2R.","Ameliorating Effects of Electroacupuncture on Dysmotility, Inflammation, and Pain Mediated via the Autonomic Mechanism in a Rat Model of Postoperative Ileus.",https://www.ncbi.nlm.nih.gov/pubmed/30827069,Journal of neurogastroenterology and motility,2019 04 28,Postoperative ileus increases healthcare costs and reduces the postoperative quality of life (QOL).

Outcome indicators include the mean dietary diversity score (DDS), the percentage of women and children reaching minimum dietary diversity (MDD), and micronutrient adequacy (mean adequacy ratio). The project consisted of(a) a diagnostic survey covering agrobiodiversity and nutrition, (b) participatory development of activities to improve nutrition, (c) a baseline survey covering dietary intakes, (d) participatory implementation of the developed activities, and (e) an endline survey covering dietary intakes. The diagnostic survey was conducted in 10 sublocations of Vihiga County, which were pair-matched and split into five intervention and five control sublocations. The intervention sublocations developed activities towards improving nutrition. Before implementation, a baseline survey collected the dietary intake data of 330 women-child pairs in the intervention and control sublocations. To support the activities, communities received agriculture and nutrition training. After 1 year of implementation, an endline survey collected dietary intake data from 444 women-child pairs in the intervention and control sublocations. Impact was assessed using the difference-in-difference technique. Highly significant positive impacts on children's mean DDS (treatment effect = 0.7, p < 0.001) and on the share of children reaching MDD (treatment effect = 0.2, p < 0.001) were shown. Higher dietary diversity can be explained by the development of subsistence and income-generating pathways and increased nutrition knowledge.

This treatment, however, is associated with ovarian toxicity. The use of gonadotropin-releasing hormone (GnRH) analogues, both agonists and antagonists, may have a protective effect on the ovaries. The primary mechanism of action of GnRH analogues is to suppress the gonadotropin levels to simulate pre-pubertal hormonal milieu and subsequently prevent primordial follicles from maturation and therefore decrease the number of follicles that are more vulnerable to chemotherapy.",DMP1 Ablation in the Rabbit Results in Mineralization Defects and Abnormalities in Haversian Canal/Osteon Microarchitecture.,https://www.ncbi.nlm.nih.gov/pubmed/30827034,Journal of bone and mineral research : the official journal of the American Society for Bone and Mineral Research,2019 03 03,"DMP1 (dentin matrix protein 1) is an extracellular matrix protein highly expressed in bones. Studies of Dmp1 knockout (KO) mice led to the discovery of a rare autosomal recessive form of hypophosphatemic rickets (ARHR) caused by DMP1 mutations. However, there are limitations for using this mouse model to study ARHR, including a lack of Haversian canals and osteons (that occurs only in large mammalian bones), high levels of fibroblast growth factor 23 (FGF23), and PTH, in comparison with a moderate elevation of FGF23 and unchanged PTH in human ARHR patients. To better understand this rare disease, we deleted the DMP1 gene in rabbit using CRISPR/Cas9. This rabbit model recapitulated many features of human ARHR, such as the rachitic rosary (expansion of the anterior rib ends at the costochondral junctions), moderately increased FGF23, and normal PTH levels, as well as severe defects in bone mineralization. Unexpectedly, all DMP1 KO rabbits died by postnatal week 8. They developed a severe bone microarchitecture defect: a major increase in the central canal areas of osteons, concurrent with massive accumulation of osteoid throughout all bone matrix (a defect in mineralization), suggesting a new paradigm, where rickets is caused by a combination of a defect in bone microarchitecture and a failure in mineralization. Furthermore, a study of DMP1 KO bones found accelerated chondrogenesis, whereas ARHR has commonly been thought to be involved in reduced chondrogenesis. Our findings with newly developed DMP1 KO rabbits suggest a revised understanding of the mechanism underlying ARHR. © 2019 American Society for Bone and Mineral Research.","Evaluating the intersection between ""green events"" and sense of community at Liverpool's Lark Lane Farmers Market.",https://www.ncbi.nlm.nih.gov/pubmed/30827032,Journal of community psychology,2019 03 03,"More research needs to evaluate links between community psychology and event impacts.

As expected, the deuterated analogs (37-44) are as efficacious as sofosbuvir when tested in vitro inhibition of viral replication (replicon) assays. Compared with sofosbuvir, deuterated analog 40 displays improved in vivo pharmacokinetics profiles in rats and dogs in terms of the metabolite and the prodrug. The Cmax and area under the curve (AUC) of 40 in dogs were increased by 3.4- and 2.7-fold, respectively. Due to the enhanced pharmacokinetic properties and the great synthetic advantage of an inexpensive deuterium source (D2 O) for 40, it was chosen for further investigation.",Evaluating the dual porosity of landfilled municipal solid waste.,https://www.ncbi.nlm.nih.gov/pubmed/30827030,Environmental science and pollution research international,2019 06 13,"The objective of this paper was to study the pore-size distribution of municipal solid waste (MSW) and provide a basis for understanding the mechanism of preferential flow in MSW. Two methods were used to investigate the pore-size distribution in MSW. The first was an indirect method based on the soil-water characteristic curve (SWCC) and the second was a direct method using nuclear magnetic resonance (NMR). Samples taken from different depths of a landfill were used. In the SWCC method, SWCCs of the matrix region were obtained by a pressure plate extractor and SWCCs of the macropore region were determined by water breakthrough tests. A SWCC equation is proposed by modifying the Van Genuchten equation to consider the dual-porosity feature of MSW and the pore-size distribution was obtained based on the Young-Laplace equation. In the NMR method, the pore-size distribution of MSW was obtained by analyzing the T2 curves. The results of the two methods were qualitatively similar and both showed a dual-porosity characteristic of MSW. The average macropore radii of shallow, middle, and deep MSWs obtained from the SWCC method are 0.193, 0.184, and 0.173 mm, and those obtained from the NMR method are 0.213, 0.138, and 0.145 mm, respectively. The proportion of macropores decreases with depth. The average micropore radii given by the SWCC method are 0.022, 0.011, and 0.008 mm, and those given by the NMR method are 0.013, 0.011, and 0.008 mm, respectively. As the depth and fill age increase, the average micropore size becomes smaller and the proportion of micropores increases. The volume ratios of macropores obtained by the two methods are quantitatively quite different. The discrepancy is mainly caused by the different test principles adopted by the two methods.",Seasonal dynamics of phytoplankton in response to environmental variables in contrasting coastal ecosystems.,https://www.ncbi.nlm.nih.gov/pubmed/30827029,Environmental science and pollution research international,2019 06 13,"Seasonal distribution of phytoplankton community and size structure was assessed in three different tropical ecosystems of the western Bay of Bengal viz. estuary (Mahanadi), lagoon (Chilika), and coastal waters (off Gopalpur) in response to ambient hydrobiology. Salinity regimes differentiated the study regions as contrasting ecosystems irrespective of seasons (pre-monsoon, monsoon, post-monsoon). Taxonomic account revealed a total no of 175, 65, and 101 phytoplankton species in the estuary, lagoon, and coastal waters, respectively. Prevalence of marine, brackish, and fresh water types in the coastal waters, lagoon, and estuary, respectively, characterized the contrasting nature of the study regions in hosting the phytoplankton community. In general, phytoplankton abundance was observed in increasing order of coastal waters > estuary > lagoon during post-monsoon and pre-monsoon, while lagoon > coastal waters > estuary during monsoon. Bacillariophyta dominated the phytoplankton community in the estuary and coastal waters during all the seasons. In contrast, the lagoon exhibited a diverse array of phytoplankton group such as cyanophyta, dinophyta, and bacillariophyta during monsoon, post-monsoon, and pre-monsoon, respectively. Over the seasons, microphytoplankton emerged as the dominant phytoplankton size class in the coastal waters. Diversely, nanophytoplankton contributed to major fraction of chlorophyll-a concentration in the estuary and lagoon. Interestingly, pre-monsoon dinophyta bloom (causative species: Noctiluca scintillans with cell density 9 × 104 cells·l-1) and monsoon bacillariophyta bloom (causative species: Asterionellopsis glacialis 5.02 × 104 cells·l-1) resulted decline in species diversity. Multivariate statistical analysis deciphered salinity as a major environmental player in determining the distribution, diversity, and composition of phytoplankton communities in the three contrasting environments. Trophic state indices signified the lagoon and estuary as hypereutrophic during all season. The coastal water was marked as highly eutrophic through trophic state index during monsoon and pre-monsoon.","Elimination of Cs+ from aquatic systems by an adsorbent prepared by immobilization of potassium copper hexacyanoferrate on the SBA-15 surface: kinetic, thermodynamic, and isotherm studies.",https://www.ncbi.nlm.nih.gov/pubmed/30827028,Environmental science and pollution research international,2019 06 13,"For elimination of cesium from aqueous solutions, mesoporous SBA-15 was synthesized and employed as the support for immobilization of potassium copper hexacyanoferrate.

The Temkin, Redlich-Peterson, Sips, Langmuir, and Freundlich isotherm models were used to evaluate the experimental data. The error analysis performed by EABS, ERRSQ, and HYBRID methods showed that the data was in good agreement with the Langmuir model indicating that the process was monoenergetic and the uptake of cesium forwarded through monolayer process. The pseudo-second-order model was recognized as the adequate model to describe the kinetic data of the adsorption process. The adsorption process was endothermic and spontaneous.

Due to its physical and chemical properties, this molecule is particularly persistent in the natural environment. Volcanic soil of Guadeloupe and Martinique contain allophanes (amorphous clays), which favor chlordecone trapping due to their structure and physical properties. Thus, with this trapping ability, allophanes serve as a vector allowing chlordecone to contaminate runoff waters and, finally, the sea. In the present publication, several studies recently conducted in the Lesser Antilles have been compiled in order to evaluate the desorption of chlordecone from allophanes when arriving in the estuarine environment and to determine the transfer of chlordecone along marine trophic food webs. The experiments showed that 20% of the initial quantity of chlordecone was released from allophanes in estuarine conditions and 10% in the marine environment. These results could explain the high level of contamination found in the suspended organic matter and zooplankton in the coastal areas located downstream of the contaminated watersheds. The contamination of the marine food webs of mangroves, seagrass beds, and coral reefs is dominated by a contamination ""by bath"" in littoral waters containing chlordecone and by bioamplification seawards.",Study on the spatial correlation structure and synergistic governance development of the haze emission in China.,https://www.ncbi.nlm.nih.gov/pubmed/30827026,Environmental science and pollution research international,2019 06 13,"To clarify the current situation of haze emission and governance in China, the study analyzed the characteristics of spatial correlation structure and synergistic governance development of the haze emission of 31 provinces in China, based on social network analysis and distance synergistic model. The results indicated that the spatial correlation of inter-provincial haze emission in China presented a typical ""central-marginal"" network structure. The provinces in the network center were mostly located in the Beijing-Tianjin-Hebei region and the Yangtze River Delta region. The synergistic governance development of haze in China showed a lower level and fluctuating upward trend. In addition, the increase of network density, the decline of network grade, and the decrease of network efficiency would all improve the level of synergistic governance development. Therefore, focusing on the haze of the central provinces, improving the network structure, and improving regional synergy are important measures for effective governance. This paper improves the previous research model, considers the impact of economic and demographic factors on haze pollution, establishes a new model for analyzing spatial correlation structure of haze and calculating the synergistic governance level of haze, and designs feasible ways to raise the synergistic governance level of haze in China."

We combined behavioral assessments of performance with functional MRI and voxel-based morphometry using an advanced method to avoid cerebellar deformation and registration imprecisions inherent to the standard processing at the whole-brain level. Higher age was surprisingly associated with stable behavioral performance during predictive motor timing, despite the massive decrease of infratentorial gray matter volume of a far higher extent than in the supratentorial region, affecting mainly the posterior cerebellar lobe. Nonetheless, this very area showed extensive hyperactivation directly correlated with age. The same region had decreased connectivity with the left caudate and increased connectivity with the left fusiform gyrus, the right pallidum, the hippocampus, and the lingual gyrus. Hence, we propose to extend the scaffolding theory of aging, previously limited mainly to the frontal cortices, to include also the cerebellum, which is likewise suffering from atrophy to a far greater extent than the rest of the brain and is similarly counteracting it by bilateral hyperactivation.",Disordered Eating Among Individuals with Excess Weight: a Review of Recent Research.,https://www.ncbi.nlm.nih.gov/pubmed/30827011,Current obesity reports,2019 05 16,"The purpose of this review was to examine different forms of disordered eating among individuals with excess weight, including their rates, correlates, and psychosocial treatments.","Proton therapy for skull-base chondrosarcoma, a single-institution outcomes study.",https://www.ncbi.nlm.nih.gov/pubmed/30827010,Journal of neuro-oncology,2019 04 26,We sought to evaluate the effectiveness of definitive or adjuvant external-beam proton therapy on local control and survival in patients with skull-base chondrosarcoma.,Cytometric analysis of cell suspension generated by cavitron ultrasonic surgical aspirator in pediatric brain tumors.,https://www.ncbi.nlm.nih.gov/pubmed/30827009,Journal of neuro-oncology,2019 04 29,The aim of this study was to test the possibility of using specimens obtained by a cavitron ultrasonic surgical aspirator (CUSA) in flow and mass cytometry investigations of pediatric brain tumors.,Postoperative desaturation and bradypnea after general anesthesia in non-ICU patients: a retrospective evaluation.,https://www.ncbi.nlm.nih.gov/pubmed/30827008,Journal of clinical monitoring and computing,2019 03 03,"Respiratory depression, presenting as desaturation and bradypnea, is common during the early postoperative period. However, it has not been evaluated by appropriate monitoring. The purpose of the present study was to identify the incidence and predictors of desaturation and bradypnea following general anesthesia, using a continuous and centralized monitoring system, in non-ICU patients who did not have serious complications and did not undergo major surgery. Patients were connected to a continuous and centralized monitoring system via a pulse oximeter and respiratory rate sensor for at least 8 h after extubation. We assessed the incidence and risk factors for desaturation (SpO2 < 90% for > 10 s) and bradypnea (respiratory rate < 8 breaths/min for > 2 min) events. We retrospectively collected the clinical data of 1064 adult patients in the study. The incidences of desaturation and bradypnea were 12.1% and 5.1%, respectively. Most desaturation events occurred after the termination of oxygen administration. The greatest incidence of bradypnea was within the first hour after surgery, reducing over time. Analysis revealed that age (odds ratio [OR] 1.04, 95% confidence interval [CI] 1.03-1.06; p < 0.001), BMI (OR 1.12, 95% CI 1.06-1.18; p < 0.001) and current smoking (OR 1.91, 95% CI 1.12-3.42; p = 0.023) were significant risk factors for desaturation. Sleep apnea syndrome (OR 4.23, 95% CI 1.09-13.5; p = 0.021) and postoperative opioid administration (OR 2.76, 95% CI 1.44-5.20; p = 0.002) were significantly associated with bradypnea. Age (OR 1.04, 95% CI 1.01-1.07; p = 0.010) and postoperative opioid administration (OR 3.16, 95% CI 1.22-7.87; p = 0.019) showed a significant association with the occurrence of both desaturation and bradypnea. This study demonstrated the incidence and predictors of postoperative desaturation and bradypnea, and suggests the need for monitoring oxygen saturation and respiratory rate for at least 8 h after surgery in non-ICU patients. Use of monitoring systems might provide a safety net for postoperative patients.",Framework for Supporting Adolescent Peer Leaders: A Pilot Using Text Messaging in a School-Based Substance Use Prevention Program.,https://www.ncbi.nlm.nih.gov/pubmed/30827007,The journal of primary prevention,2019 04 07,"Training peer leaders (PLs) as implementation agents is a state-of-the-art approach in prevention, but the field lacks frameworks for providing support. Text messaging, a powerful tool for direct intervention, may be useful in this regard. We introduce a conceptual framework for engaging, retaining, and educating adolescent PLs and conduct a pilot test of this framework using text messages for delivery to middle school PLs in a new, peer-led substance use prevention program. Fifty eighth-graders were recruited as PLs. We used a newly-developed framework to create text messages to strengthen peer leaders': (a) mission, agency, and team identity; (b) connection to adult mentors; (c) content knowledge and application to their own lives; and (d) preparation for prevention activities. Thirty-four texts were sent to PLs over 4 months. PL replies and participation were recorded to track engagement. Forty-one PLs (71%) received texts and completed baseline and post-program surveys. Parents and school staff completed post-program questionnaires. Eighty-five percent of PLs responded to at least one text message. Response rates for specific messages varied from 22 to 56%. Students were most likely to reply to texts about preparation for their own prevention activities in the school. Ninety-five percent of PLs said they read messages even when they did not reply. Eighty-three percent of PLs said the messages helped them accomplish their mission. PLs reported that they wanted to receive messages in the future. PL attendance had very little variability in two of the three schools, but replies to texts were associated with better attendance in one school. Our study provides a framework for supporting adolescent peer leaders in a network intervention. Automated text messaging supporting middle school PLs was feasible, engaging, and well-received. Texting activity was associated with participation in school-based activities. Future priorities include systematically varying text support to determine its true effect on implementation and on involvement by less engaged PLs.",Ulcerative Colitis: Shifting Sands.,https://www.ncbi.nlm.nih.gov/pubmed/30827006,Drugs in R&D,2019 06 01,"Ulcerative colitis (UC) is a chronic inflammatory bowel disease associated with considerable disease burden. We review some current misconceptions about UC in adults with the aim of optimizing care for patients. Although UC and Crohn's disease (CD) are considered discrete diseases, distinctions between them are not always clear-cut and phenotypes may change over time. Patient management should take into account disease manifestations, disease severity and extent, and response to prior treatments. Although disease extent often defines severity, distal UC is not always less disabling than extensive disease as patients can progress to more extensive disease. In addition, severe proctitis can give rise to severe and debilitating symptoms, with a substantial impact on health-related quality of life. UC carries an increased risk of colorectal cancer (CRC) compared with CD; however, more recent data indicate a similar risk of CRC in CD with colonic involvement as with UC. Corticosteroids are widely used to induce remission in UC, and prolonged use of steroids in patients with UC is common, but corticosteroid-free maintenance of remission is an important therapeutic goal. Although biologic therapies provide a valuable treatment option in UC, they are not clinically effective in all patients and are also associated with secondary loss of response.",Immunohistochemical localization of estrogen receptor alpha (ERα) in the oviduct of Indian buffalo during follicular and luteal phases of estrous cycle.,https://www.ncbi.nlm.nih.gov/pubmed/30827005,Tropical animal health and production,2019 03 03,"The localization and distribution of estrogen receptor alpha (ERα) in different segments of oviduct of buffalo during follicular and luteal phases of estrous cycle were investigated using immunohistochemistry. Tissue samples from the different segments of oviduct from 12 buffaloes (six each during follicular and luteal phases of estrous cycle) were collected from slaughter house after assessing the gross morphology of ovaries. In addition, blood samples were collected from the animals before slaughter to estimate levels of estrogen and progesterone hormones. The tissue distribution of estrogen receptor was determined by immunohistochemical technique using one-step polymer HRPO staining system. The estrogen receptor was localized in the lamina epithelialis, propria submucosa, tunica muscularis, and tunica serosa. The maximum localization was observed in the lamina epithelialis, where both ciliated and secretory cell types were positive for ERα. Percentage of positive cells varied during the follicular and luteal phases of estrous cycle. The lining epithelium of oviductal glands was also intensely positive for ERα. No immunostaining was observed in any tunic of the oviduct when the primary antibody was replaced by antibody diluent or buffer, and it served as negative control. The data showed that highest immune positive cells were observed in the ampulla region of the oviduct and these cells were lowest in the utero-tubal junction (p < 0.05). Infundibulum, ampulla, and isthmus showed a higher percentage of ERα-positive cells during follicular phase of estrous cycle as compared with those of the luteal phase of estrous cycle (p < 0.05). There was no significant difference in the percentage positive cells during the two phases of estrous cycle in the utero-tubal junction. Immunogold labeling with anti-ERα antibody confirmed the findings of immunohistochemical study at subcellular level. The higher expression during the follicular phase was directly correlated with the level of estrogen hormone."

In order to assess the relevant environmental impacts of rice agro-ecosystems due to a specific process, using LCA method, two factors concerned with resource utilization and contaminant emissions were calculated in north of Iran during 2016 and 2017. All the management practices/inputs were monitored and recorded with the help of local experts without interference in farmer's practices. After preliminary evaluation, 100 paddy fields were selected in three planting systems (low input, conventional, and high input) which were predicted in two planting methods (semi-mechanized and traditional) in small, medium, and large farm size levels. Functional unit was considered as one ton paddy yield. The finding revealed that in both regions, all the impact categories and environmental pollutant were almost same and farmer's management practices are close to each other. Also, climate change (CC) in Amol and Rasht regions was 277.21 and 275.79 kg CO2 eq., respectively. The most CC, global warming potential (GWP 100a), and cumulative energy demand (CED) in both regions were observed in high-input system for semi-mechanized method. Furthermore, the result for the impact categories of terrestrial acidification (TA), freshwater eutrophication (FE), marine eutrophication (ME), agricultural land occupation (ALO), water depletion (WD), metal depletion (MD), and fossil depletion (FD) was similar to the CC, GWP, and CED where the highest amounts in both regions statistically went to high-input system, traditional planting method, and small farms. Moreover, in both regions, high-input and conventional systems emitted higher heavy metals than low-input system. Furthermore, the most heavy metal emission in the air was achieved in small farm, and medium farm got the next rank. Additionally, the high consumption of chemical inputs, such as fossil fuels and fertilizers, in the high-input and conventional systems led to an increase of environmental pollutant in comparison with low-input systems. Therefore, to increase the sustainability of agro-ecosystems, as well as to reduce the environmental impacts of pollutant, reforming the pattern of chemical input consumption and reducing the use of non-renewable energy sources are essential.",Amelioration of Lipopolysaccharide-Induced Nephrotic Proteinuria by NFAT5 Depletion Involves Suppressed NF-κB Activity.,https://www.ncbi.nlm.nih.gov/pubmed/30826989,Inflammation,2019 03 03,"Idiopathic nephrotic syndrome (INS) is characterized by proteinuria, in which podocyte dysfunction associated with NF-κB-mediated inflammation plays an important role. The nuclear factor of activated T cells 5 (NFAT5) has been shown to enhance NF-κB activity. However, whether NFAT5 is associated with proteinuria remains uncharacterized. NFAT5 is upregulated in the glomeruli in lipopolysaccharide (LPS)-induced mouse nephrotic proteinuria, as well as in LPS-treated podocytes in vitro. In addition, NFAT5 depletion improves filtration barrier function of LPS-treated podocytes in vitro. Mechanistically, NFAT5 depletion suppresses NF-κB activation and downstream proinflammatory reaction in LPS-treated podocytes, and moreover, NF-κB inhibition improves filtration barrier function of LPS-treated podocytes, suggesting that the suppressed NF-κB activity at least partly accounts for NFAT5 depletion-improved filtration barrier function. Furthermore, in vivo, depletion of NFAT5 suppresses NF-κB activity and ameliorates nephrotic proteinuria in LPS-treated mice. These findings suggest a protective role of NFAT5 depletion against LPS-induced nephrotic proteinuria and relate it to the suppression of NF-κB activity.",Moving the Needle: Improving the Care of the Gout Patient.,https://www.ncbi.nlm.nih.gov/pubmed/30826988,Rheumatology and therapy,2019 06 10,"Gout is a the most common inflammatory arthritis in the United States. It is a significant cause of morbidity, disability, lost work days, and high healthcare utilization due to intermittent attacks, chronic inflammation, and joint damage. Despite our understanding of the prelude and pathophysiology of gout, hyperuricemia, it is still poorly misunderstood by patients and poorly managed by healthcare providers. Several parallel treatment paradigms have been developed by professional societies around the world based on the understanding of how hyperuricemia occurs, gout epidemiology, expert opinion, and clinical trials data in order to lower uric acid and eventually eliminate the patient's crystal burden. This review focuses on both the treatment of acute attacks, and more importantly, the long-term management of gout and the lowering of serum uric acid levels to a goal of < 6 mg/dl (0.360 mmol/l) or treating to target. Treating to a target serum uric acid goal is an opportunity to decrease morbidity and improve the quality of care of every gout patient.",Expanding Role of NMDA Receptor Antagonists in the Management of Pain.,https://www.ncbi.nlm.nih.gov/pubmed/30826987,CNS drugs,2019 04 02,"Pain management is complex regardless of whether the pain is acute or chronic in nature or non-cancer or cancer related.

Consequently, interest in the role of NMDA receptor antagonists as a pharmacological pain management strategy has surfaced. This narrative review provides an overview of the NMDA receptor and elaborates on the pharmacotherapeutic profile and pain management literature findings for the following NMDA receptor antagonists: ketamine, memantine, dextromethorphan, and magnesium. The literature on this topic is characterized by small studies, many of which exhibit methodological flaws. To date, ketamine is the most studied NMDA receptor antagonist for both acute and chronic pain management. Although further research about NMDA receptor antagonists for analgesia is needed and the optimal dosage/administration regimens for these drugs have yet to be determined, ketamine appears to hold the most promise and may be of particular value in the perioperative pain management realm.",Human-Computer Interaction Problem in Learning: Could the Key Be Hidden Somewhere Between Social Interaction and Development of Tools?,https://www.ncbi.nlm.nih.gov/pubmed/30826986,Integrative psychological & behavioral science,2019 03 03,"Homo sapiens is not just a tool-using species, they also can invent and develop tools. This is the feature that distinguishes humans from other species. It is necessary to get rid of the perceptual dominance of the present state of the material to invent and develop a tool. It is based on a mental process: designing. So how was that possible? In this article, I propose an evolutionary hypothesis in response to this question: the referential triangle. Accordingly, the relationship that people establish with things is mentally indirect, but the relationship they establish with each other is mentally direct. The hypothesis claims that the mental solutions of people have naturally established with each other are also used to invent and develop tools. The latest and most interesting product of this mechanism is artificial intelligence. Because artificial intelligence also acts as an inorganic system. What distinguishes it from other machines in this context is its social behavior. Artificial intelligence can generate social signals. So can artificial intelligence be both a tool and a partner at the same time in the referential triangle established with the tools by the human? In other words, can children, for instance, socially interact with artificial intelligence, just as they do naturally with people around?

Our preliminary studies have shown that PAX3 gene is upregulated in glioma cells, which is associated with a worse prognosis. Moreover, PAX3, by facilitating cell proliferation and invasion and inhibiting cell apoptosis, plays an oncogenic role in glioma. However, the specific molecular mechanism of PAX3 acting as an oncogene in glioma remains unclarified. In the present study, we have found that PAX3 overexpression was observed in high grade glioma and predicted a worse prognosis. PAX3 overexpression did not correlate significantly to IDH1 mutation and MGMT methylation. Moreover, the expression of PAX3 was positively correlated with that of β-catenin. In U87 glioma cells, PAX3 interacted with β-catenin, as was confirmed by CO-IP. Besides, PAX3 overexpression promoted cell proliferation and cell cycle progression, while it inhibited cell apoptosis by altering the expressions of important molecules associated with the Wnt signaling pathway, including β-catenin, Myc, VEGF, cyclinD1, MMP7, and Wnt1. In the meantime, it was also proved that PAX3 correlated to β-catenin through a negative regulatory mechanism with respect to the promotion of U87 glioma cell proliferation and cell cycle progression and inhibition of the cell apoptosis. Our experiment demonstrated the role of PAX3 in promoting glioma growth and development, possibly by interacting directly with β-catenin and regulating the Wnt signaling pathway.",The relationship between the Young's modulus and dry etching rate of polydimethylsiloxane (PDMS).,https://www.ncbi.nlm.nih.gov/pubmed/30826983,Biomedical microdevices,2019 06 15,"Polydimethylsiloxane (PDMS) has been the pivotal materials for microfluidic technologies with tremendous amount of lab-on-a-chip devices made of PDMS microchannels. While molding-based soft-lithography approach has been extremely successful in preparing various PDMS constructs, some complex features have to been achieved through more complicated microfabrication techniques that involve dry etching of PDMS. Several recipes have been reported for reactive ion etching (RIE) of PDMS; however, the etch rates present large variations, even for the same etching recipe, which poses challenges in adopting this process for device fabrication. Through systematic characterization of the Young's modulus of PDMS films and RIE etch rate, we show that the etch rate is closely related to the polymer cross-link density in the PDMS with a higher etch rate for a lower PDMS Young's modulus. Our results could provide guidance to the fabrication of microfluidic devices involving dry etching of PDMS.",Motion in a crowded environment: the influence of obstacles' size and shape and model of transport.,https://www.ncbi.nlm.nih.gov/pubmed/30826982,Journal of molecular modeling,2019 03 08,"Simulations of motion in a complex crowded environment were performed.

The so-called motion of a single agent, where the motion of molecules is considered as a random walk without any correlation with other moving objects, was also calculated as the state of reference. Immobilized chains embedded in a two-dimensional triangular lattice modeled the crowded environment. The dynamic behavior of movable objects was studied and the influence of the structure of the matrix of obstacles on the molecular transport was discussed. It was shown that the type of transport has an impact on the dynamics of the system. The appearance and properties of subdiffusive motion were analyzed and referred to the structure of polymer systems."

However, gas leakage from deep storage reservoirs, which may flow back into near-surface and eventually to the atmosphere, is a major concern associated with this technology. Despite an increase in research focusing on potential CO2 leakage into deep surface features and aquifers, a significant knowledge gap remains in the geochemical changes associated with near-surface. This study reviews the geochemical processes related to the intrusion of CO2 into near-surface environments with an emphasis on metal mobilization and discusses about the geochemical research approaches, recent findings, and current knowledge gaps. It is found that the intrusion of CO2(g) into near-surface likely induces changes in pH, dissolution of minerals, and potential degradation of surrounding environments. The development of adequate geochemical research approaches for assessing CO2 leakage in near-surface environments, using field studies, laboratory experiments, and/or geochemical modeling combined with isotopic tracers, has promoted extensive surveys of CO2-induced reactions. However, addressing knowledge gaps in geochemical changes in near-surface environments is fundamental to advance current knowledge on how CO2 leaks from storage sites and the consequences of this process on soil and water chemistry. For reliable detection and risk management of the potential impact of CO2 leakage from storage sites on the environmental chemistry, currently available geochemical research approaches should be either combined or used independently (albeit in a manner complementarily to one another), and the results should be jointly interpreted.",Potential Diagnostic Value of Red Blood Cells α-Synuclein Heteroaggregates in Alzheimer's Disease.,https://www.ncbi.nlm.nih.gov/pubmed/30826968,Molecular neurobiology,2019 03 03,"A plethora of complex misfolded protein combinations have been found in Alzheimer disease (AD) brains besides the classical pathological hallmarks. Recently, α-synuclein (α-syn) and its heterocomplexes with amyloid-β (Aβ) and tau have been suggested to be involved in the pathophysiological processes of neurodegenerative diseases. These pathological features are not limited to the brain, but can be also found in peripheral fluids. In this respect, red blood cells (RBCs) have been suggested as a good model to investigate the biochemical alterations of neurodegeneration. Our aim is to find whether RBC concentrations of α-syn and its heterocomplexes (i.e., α-syn/Aβ and α-syn/tau) were different in AD patients compared with healthy controls (HC). The levels of homo- and heteroaggregates of α-syn, Aβ and tau, were analyzed in a cohort of AD patients at early stage either with dementia or prodromal symptoms (N = 39) and age-matched healthy controls (N = 39). All AD patients received a biomarker-based diagnosis (low cerebrospinal fluid levels of Aβ peptide combined with high cerebrospinal fluid concentrations of total tau and/or phospho-tau proteins; alternatively, a positivity to cerebral amyloid-PET scan). Our results showed lower concentrations of α-syn and its heterocomplexes (i.e., α-syn/Aβ and α-syn/tau) in RBCs of AD patients with respect to HC. RBC α-syn/Aβ as well as RBC α-syn/tau heterodimers discriminated AD participants from HC with fair accuracy, whereas RBC α-syn concentrations differentiated poorly the two groups. Although additional investigations are required, these data suggest α-syn heteroaggregates in RBCs as potential tool in the diagnostic work-up of early AD diagnosis.",Perineuronal Nets Restrict the Induction of Long-Term Depression in the Mouse Hippocampal CA1 Region.,https://www.ncbi.nlm.nih.gov/pubmed/30826967,Molecular neurobiology,2019 03 03,"Long-term depression (LTD) of synaptic efficacy is widely regarded as a cellular basis of learning and memory. The magnitude of hippocampal CA1 LTD induced by low-frequency stimulation (LFS) declines with age, but the mechanisms involved remain poorly understood. Perineuronal nets (PNNs) are specialized extracellular matrix structures that function in dampening synaptic plasticity during postnatal development, suggesting that PNN formation may restrict LTD induction in the adult hippocampus. Here, we show that PNNs tightly enwrap a subpopulation of parvalbumin (PV) interneurons in the hippocampal CA1 region and enzymatic removal of PNNs with the chondroitinase ABC alters the excitatory/inhibitory synaptic balance toward more excitation and restores the ability of LFS to induce an N-methyl-D-aspartate receptor-dependent LTD at Schaffer collateral-CA1 synapses in slices from male adult mice. Early interference with depolarizing GABA with Na+-K+-2Cl- cotransporter inhibitor bumetanide impairs the maturation of PNNs and enhances LTD induction. These results provide novel insights into a previously unrecognized role for PNNs around PV interneurons in restricting long-term synaptic plasticity at excitatory synapses on hippocampal CA1 neurons in adulthood.","Parental Decision Making: The Best Interest Principle, Child Autonomy, and Reasonableness.",https://www.ncbi.nlm.nih.gov/pubmed/30826966,HEC forum : an interdisciplinary journal on hospitals' ethical and legal issues,2019 03 03,"On what basis should we judge whether a parent's medical decision for their child is morally acceptable?

Accordingly, we intend to advance the project of formulating a method for guiding parents' medical decision making for their children. We argue that Bester's standard fails to accommodate the autonomy of the child and that his criteria for assessing the reasonableness of the parents' argument for their decision is too weak.

Given these circumstances, new and effective treatments are needed. In recent years, exciting progress has been made in immunotherapies, including the rapid development of immune checkpoint inhibitors. Checkpoint blockades targeting the PD-1/PD-L1 axis have achieved effective clinical responses with acceptable toxicity by suppressing tumor progression and improving survival in several tumor types. In this review, we summarize recent advances in our understanding of the PD-1/PD-L1 signaling pathway, including the expression patterns of PD-1/PD-L1 and potential PD-1/PD-L1-related therapeutic strategies for CC.",Nivolumab-induced immune-mediated colitis: an ulcerative colitis look-alike-report of new cases and review of the literature.,https://www.ncbi.nlm.nih.gov/pubmed/30826963,International journal of colorectal disease,2019 04 21,"Nivolumab, a monoclonal antibody-targeting programmed cell death protein-1, is being increasingly used for the treatment of some advanced neoplasms.

The molecular, supramolecular, and morphological structures of the microparticles were systematically characterized by IR and UV-vis spectroscopies, elementary analysis, wide-angle X-ray diffractometry, and transmission electron microscopy. The microparticles demonstrate electrical semiconductivity and high resistance to strong acid and alkali, and strong adsorption capability for lead(II), mercury(II), and silver(I) ions. The experimental conditions for adsorption of Pb(II) were optimized by varying the persulfate/monomer ratio, adsorption time, sorbent concentration, and pH value of the Pb(II) solution. The maximum adsorption capacity is 241 mg·g-1 for particles after a 24 h-exposure to a solution at an initial Pb(II) concentration of 29 mM.

However, it remains unclear whether such a relation varies by region of the study population or by major subtypes of stroke. We searched PubMed and EMBASE databases for relevant studies and we further included unpublished results from the Singapore Chinese Health Study (N = 57,078) and the Seguimiento Universidad de Navarra (SUN) study (N = 12,670). We used a random-effects model to calculate summary relative risk (RR) with 95% confidence intervals (CI) of stroke for each 4-point increment of the MedDiet score, roughly corresponding to the difference between extreme quintiles of the MedDiet score among participants of the included studies. The final analyses included 20 prospective cohort studies involving 682,149 participants and 16,739 stroke cases. The summary RRs for each 4-point increment of the MedDiet score were 0.84 (95% CI 0.81-0.88; I2 = 11.5%) for all combined, 0.76 (95% CI 0.65-0.89) for studies in Mediterranean populations and 0.86 (95% CI 0.83-0.89) for those in non-Mediterranean populations. Lower risk of stroke associated with higher MedDiet score also was observed in the analyses stratified by study population and methodological characteristics including study risk of bias, version of the MedDiet index, and definition of moderate alcohol consumption. The MedDiet was similarly associated with lower risk of ischemic stroke (RR 0.86, 95% CI 0.81-0.91; nine studies) and hemorrhagic stroke (RR 0.83, 95% CI 0.74-0.93; eight studies).

Despite a long history of flax genetic transformation only one transgenic linseed cultivar has been so far registered in Canada. Implementation and use of the genome-editing technologies that allow site-directed modification of endogenous genes without the introduction of foreign genes might improve this situation. Besides its potential for boosting crop yields, genome editing is now one of the best tools for carrying out reverse genetics and it is emerging as an especially versatile tool for studying basic biology. A complex interplay between the flax tubulin family (6 α-, 14 β-, and 2 γ-tubulin genes), the building block of microtubules, and the CesA (15-16 genes), the subunit of the multimeric cellulose-synthesizing complex devoted to the oriented deposition of the cellulose microfibrils is fundamental for the biosynthesis of the cell wall. The role of the different members of each family in providing specificities to the assembled complexes in terms of structure, dynamics, activity, and interaction remains substantially obscure. Genome-editing strategies, recently shown to be successful in flax, can therefore be useful to unravel the issue of functional redundancy and provide evidence for specific interactions between different members of the tubulin and CesA gene families, in relation to different phase and mode of cell wall biosynthesis.",In-stent restenosis associated with dual-layer Roadsaver carotid artery stent: a retrospective single-center study.,https://www.ncbi.nlm.nih.gov/pubmed/30826921,La Radiologia medica,2019 03 03,"To evaluate the incidence of in-stent restenosis (ISR) at 12-month follow-up, in patients treated with new dual-layer Roadsaver (Terumo Corp, Tokyo, Japan) carotid artery stent (CAS).",Characterization of circulating DNA in plasma of patients after allogeneic bone grafting.,https://www.ncbi.nlm.nih.gov/pubmed/30826920,Clinical oral investigations,2019 03 03,"Cell-free DNA (cfDNA) harboring mutations has been found in patients with diseases.

Postoperative complications of TORS include hemorrhage, tooth injury, dehydration, aspiration pneumonia, and prolonged percutaneous endoscopic gastrostomy (PEG) tube dependency. Dental injury has not been adequately discussed although it has been reported to be a common complication in multiple studies, with repair costs ranging from $700 to $3000 and average time spent to address the injury estimated to be 2.6 h. The incidence of this injury is likely due to the standard dental guard, which is not customizable to the patient's teeth, therefore, not optimal for dental protection. Many alternative dental guards have been proposed to reduce the rate of dental injury. However, the previously presented alternatives are high cost, not time efficient, or have the potential for molding error rendering them less effective. We propose a guard that is cheap, time efficient, and effective in preventing dental injury. A retrospective study of 124 patients who underwent TORS over a period of 6 years with the proposed dental guard was conducted. No dental complications were observed in any of these cases. A cost analysis showed that this guard saved $4526.64 for our relatively small patient cohort. This guard can save money, time, and stress for both the patient and the surgeon, as well as reduce the number and severity of medico-legal claims related to perioperative dental injury.",The STOP DIABETES study: when prevention works.,https://www.ncbi.nlm.nih.gov/pubmed/30826915,Acta diabetologica,2019 05 30,"Although many drugs are now available, a large effort is still needed to prevent diabetes. The STOP DIABETES study evaluated individuals at risk for type 2 diabetes (T2D) by a 2-h 75-g oral glucose tolerance test (OGTT). Based on the three main defective physiological responses, subjects were stratified as at low, intermediate, or high risk, and treated accordingly with lifestyle modifications and drugs. Participants at intermediate and high risk experienced the greatest reduction of T2D conversion. Interestingly, a group of individuals developing T2D presented a normal glucose tolerance at baseline, but a 1-h plasma glucose concentration > 155 mg/dL. These results are critical as prediabetes can increase the incidence of cardiovascular disease. Considering the timeframe between the first defects in glucose metabolism and the manifestation of diabetes complications, the effort to tackle the glycemic impairment as soon as possible represents an outstanding task to reduce the incidence of diabetes. Ideally, the earlier glycemic alterations are recognized, the lesser armamentarium needs to be used, and the lower is the expense in terms of drugs, complications, and related events and costs. Finally, a wealth of studies clearly demonstrated the importance of 1-h plasma glucose concentration, which has been proposed as an adjunctive diagnostic tool to detect prediabetes earlier. In conclusion, by an OGTT, a lot of individuals at risk for T2D may be detected when the central role for the 1-h plasma glucose concentration is also considered. Consequently, these subjects would be treated early and with less drugs and delay T2D complications.",Is Early Reimplantation of the Duodenal-Jejunal Bypass Liner Viable?,https://www.ncbi.nlm.nih.gov/pubmed/30826914,Obesity surgery,2019 05 12,"The endoscopically implanted duodenal-jejunal bypass liner (DJBL) is an impermeable fluoropolymer device which prevents food making contact with the proximal intestine, thus inducing weight loss and improvement of type 2 diabetes mellitus (T2DM).

From fall, 2015, through spring, 2017, a lifestyle medicine elective was offered to first and second year medical students. Acquisition of data was approved by the IRB. Students attended four group sessions, two at the beginning and two at the end of the elective. At the first session, information about the effects of lifestyle on mental and physical health was presented. Students completed screening instruments to assess their own physical activity, nutrition, anxiety, and depression. At the next class, students received their scores. They chose one of three focus groups: nutrition, physical activity or stress management and set a specific goal in that area. At the end of the elective, students attended two group sessions, which focused on patient cases. They again completed the screening instruments, and received their scores. They also evaluated the course. Sixty-three students signed the consent form and provided data. Comparison of baseline scores by gender revealed that women had statistically significant higher scores on the depression screener than men, and lower physical activity scores than men. Pre and post elective comparison in the whole group showed statistically significant improvements in nutrition, depression, and anxiety (all p < .05). Further analysis in the focus groups demonstrated that the stress management group's scores on anxiety were significantly improved. The nutrition group significantly lowered their fat consumption and increased their intake of fruits and vegetables (all p < .05). The physical activity group did not significantly increase their daily physical activity, although this analysis was limited by missing data and wide variability. Student evaluations of the course were positive. Medical students are able to make improvements in their own lifestyle behaviors while acquiring information that may be useful in later patient care.","Hand-held, dilation-free, electroretinography in children under 3 years of age treated with vigabatrin.",https://www.ncbi.nlm.nih.gov/pubmed/30826910,Documenta ophthalmologica.

However, the mechanism by which this rapid apoptosis occurs remains unknown. We have investigated canonical aspects of apoptosis to determine how the nuphar alkaloid, (+)-6-hydroxythiobinupharidine (6HTBN), induces apoptosis. 6HTBN induced rapid apoptosis in various leukemia, lymphoma, and carcinoma cell lines, suggesting that its mechanism is cell-type independent. It also circumvented resistance of patient-derived chronic lymphocytic leukemia cells generated by co-culture on survival-promoting stroma. Intriguingly, 6HTBN failed to induce apoptosis in platelets. The mechanism of apoptosis involves activation of caspase 9 and caspase 3, but not caspase 8 as previously reported. The release of cytochrome c from mitochondria occurred even in the absence of BAX/BAK and in cells that retained mitochondrial membrane potential.

We used six aquatic taxonomic groups to test the relationship between environmental and geographic factors and their effect on species turnover patterns in an agriculturally dominated river (Chaohu Lake Basin, China). The relationships between three dissimilarity indices and geographic distance were assessed using the Mantel test while considering the differences in environmental factors between sites. Then, we employed a variation partitioning method to distinguish the isolated and combined effects of environmental and geographic distance on species turnover. There were significant relationships between environmental distance and species turnover in all groups. All organisms except periphytic diatoms were significantly correlated with two geographic (Euclidean and network) distances when the Chao dissimilarity index was considered. The results suggest that the strength of the correlations changed with environmental and geographic distances and with the aquatic community. The communities displayed more complex relationships with the distance measures when different dissimilarity (Jaccard, Chao, and Bray-Curtis dissimilarity) indices were considered. Nevertheless, aquatic communities are strongly influenced by both environmental and geographic distance, and the former has a stronger effect than the latter.",Cardiac Complications in the Adult Bone Marrow Transplant Patient.,https://www.ncbi.nlm.nih.gov/pubmed/30826891,Current oncology reports,2019 04 02,"Due to advancements in oncologic treatment strategies and techniques, the number of survivors who have undergone hematopoetic stem cell transplant (HCT) continues to increase in the United States; this number is projected to reach 502,000 by the year 2030.

Variations in HER2-positivity rates suggest factors affecting test quality; however, the influence of patient-, tumor-, and laboratory-related factors on HER2-positivity rates remains unknown. This observational, prospective study collected routine HER2 testing data from 50 pathology centers in Germany (January 2013-December 2015). For each sample, HER2 status, primary tumor location, method of sample retrieval, and other patient- and tumor-related parameters were recorded. A model for predicting the probability of HER2-positivity was developed using stepwise multiple logistic regression to identify influencing factors. Documented positivity rates and corresponding predicted HER2-positivity probabilities were compared to identify institutes with deviations in HER2-positivity. Data from 2761 mGC/mGEJC routine diagnostic specimens included 2033 with HER2 test results (1554 mGC, 479 mGEJC); overall HER2-positivity rates across centers were 19.8% and 30.5%, respectively. HER2-positivity correlated most with Lauren classification, then HER2 testing rate, primary tumor location, sample type, and testing method (all p < 0.05). Three institutes had model-predicted HER2-positivity rates outside the 95% confidence interval of their documented rate, which could not be explained by sample and center characteristics. Results demonstrated the high quality of routine HER2 testing in the mGC/mGEJC cohort analyzed. This is the first study investigating parameters impacting on HER2-positivity rates in mGC/mGEJC in routine practice and suggests that assessment of HER2 testing quality should consider primary tumor location, testing method and rate, and tumor characteristics. Accurate identification of patients with HER2-positive mGC/mGEJC is essential for appropriate use of HER2-targeted therapies.",ISSLS PRIZE IN BIOENGINEERING SCIENCE 2019: biomechanical changes in dynamic sagittal balance and lower limb compensatory strategies following realignment surgery in adult spinal deformity patients.,https://www.ncbi.nlm.nih.gov/pubmed/30826876,"European spine journal : official publication of the European Spine Society, the European Spinal Deformity Society, and the European Section of the Cervical Spine Research Society",2019 06 13,A longitudinal cohort study.,Evaluation of adenovirus amplified detection of immunochromatographic test using tears including conjunctival exudate in patients with adenoviral keratoconjunctivitis.,https://www.ncbi.nlm.nih.gov/pubmed/30826875,Graefe's archive for clinical and experimental ophthalmology = Albrecht von Graefes Archiv fur klinische und experimentelle Ophthalmologie,2019 04 12,We evaluated a novel silver amplification immunochromatography test for rapid detection of adenovirus (AdV) antigen equipped with an automated reader system using tears including conjunctival exudate in patients with adenoviral keratoconjunctivitis.,The 'sentinel' vessel: an anatomical landmark to identify the pes anserinus during hamstrings harvest for ACL reconstruction.,https://www.ncbi.nlm.nih.gov/pubmed/30826874,European journal of orthopaedic surgery & traumatology : orthopedie traumatologie,2019 06 15,"Hamstrings identification and subsequent graft harvest can be made difficult by body habitus and variability in tendon anatomy.

Breeding between two populations with different chromosomal configurations generates subfertile or sterile hybrid individuals due to impaired meiotic development. In this study, we have analyzed prophase-I spermatocytes of hybrids formed by crossing mice from Vulcano and Lipari island populations. Both populations have a 2n = 26 karyotype but different combinations of Robertsonian translocations. We studied the progress of synapsis, recombination, and meiotic silencing of unsynapsed chromosomes during prophase-I through the immunolocalization of the proteins SYCP3, SYCP1, γH2AX, RAD51, and MLH1. In these hybrids, a hexavalent is formed that, depending on the degree of synapsis between chromosomes, can adopt an open chain, a ring, or a closed configuration. The frequency of these configurations varies throughout meiosis, with the maximum degree of synapsis occurring at mid pachytene. In addition, we observed the appearance of heterologous synapsis between telocentric and metacentric chromosomes; however, this synapsis seems to be transient and unstable and unsynapsed regions are frequently observed in mid-late pachytene. Interestingly, we found that chiasmata are frequently located at the boundaries of unsynapsed chromosomal regions in the hexavalent during late pachytene. These results provide new clues about synapsis dynamics during meiosis. We propose that mechanical forces generated along chromosomes may induce premature desynapsis, which, in turn, might be counteracted by the location of chiasmata. Despite these and additional meiotic features, such as the accumulation of γH2AX on unsynapsed chromosome regions, we observed a large number of cells that progressed to late stages of prophase-I, indicating that synapsis defects may not trigger a meiotic crisis in these hybrids.",Leagues of their own: sexually dimorphic features of meiotic prophase I.,https://www.ncbi.nlm.nih.gov/pubmed/30826870,Chromosoma,2019 03 03,"Meiosis is a conserved cell division process that is used by sexually reproducing organisms to generate haploid gametes. Males and females produce different end products of meiosis: eggs (females) and sperm (males). In addition, these unique end products demonstrate sex-specific differences that occur throughout meiosis to produce the final genetic material that is packaged into distinct gametes with unique extracellular morphologies and nuclear sizes. These sexually dimorphic features of meiosis include the meiotic chromosome architecture, in which both the lengths of the chromosomes and the requirement for specific meiotic axis proteins being different between the sexes. Moreover, these changes likely cause sex-specific changes in the recombination landscape with the sex that has the longer chromosomes usually obtaining more crossovers. Additionally, epigenetic regulation of meiosis may contribute to sexually dimorphic recombination landscapes. Here we explore the sexually dimorphic features of both the chromosome axis and crossing over for each stage of meiotic prophase I in Mus musculus, Caenorhabditis elegans, and Arabidopsis thaliana. Furthermore, we consider how sex-specific changes in the meiotic chromosome axes and the epigenetic landscape may function together to regulate crossing over in each sex, indicating that the mechanisms controlling crossing over may be different in oogenesis and spermatogenesis.","Radiographic abnormalities, bladder interventions, and bladder surgery in the first decade of life in children with spina bifida.",https://www.ncbi.nlm.nih.gov/pubmed/30826869,"Pediatric nephrology (Berlin, Germany)",2019 06 10,"Spina bifida (SB) patients are at increased risk for hydronephrosis, bladder storage and emptying problems, and renal failure that may require multiple bladder surgeries."

Exposure to bisphenol A (BPA), an endocrine disruptor (ED), can lead to aberrant immunity and gut microbiota. We determined whether BPA had age-dependent effects on T1D by modulating immune homeostasis following various windows of exposure in non-obese diabetic (NOD) mice. Juvenile NOD females were orally exposed to 0 or 30 µg BPA/kg BW from postnatal day (PND) 28 to PND56. Adult NOD females were exposed to 0 or 300 µg BPA/kg BW. Female and male NOD offspring were exposed to 0 or 300 µg BPA/kg BW perinatally from gestation day 5 to PND28 by dosing the dams. It was found that BPA increased T1D risk in juvenile females with gut microbiota shifted towards pro-inflammation (e.g. increased Jeotgalicoccus). In agreement with our previous study, adult females had a trend of increased T1D and a general increase in immune responses. However, female offspring had a reduced T1D development. Consistently, female offspring had a shift towards anti-inflammation (e.g. decreased pro-inflammatory F4/80+Gr1+ cells). In contrast, BPA had minimal effects on immunity and T1D in male offspring. Thus, it was concluded that BPA had age- and sex-dependent effects on T1D with the alteration of gut microbiota and inflammation being the primary mechanisms for T1D exacerbation in juvenile exposure and decreases of inflammation being responsible for attenuated T1D in perinatally exposed females.",Slowing down DNA translocation velocity using a LiCl salt gradient and nanofiber mesh.,https://www.ncbi.nlm.nih.gov/pubmed/30826854,European biophysics journal : EBJ,2019 06 13,"Solid-state nanopores are considered an attractive basis for single-molecule DNA sequencing.

The fluorescence of the CDs was quenched linearly with the concentration of TNP in the range from 1 to 100 μM, with a detection limit of 0.48 μM (3σ/k). The detection mechanism was ascribed to the synergistic effect of the inner filter effect and electron transfer. In addition, a portable sensing gadget based on a high-precision RGB color sensor and a micro control unit was developed. With use of the sensing gadget and the CDs, TNP detection in tap water and lake water samples was realized.

Fear and anger reduce the sense of agency: a study using intentional binding.,https://www.ncbi.nlm.nih.gov/pubmed/30826847,Experimental brain research,2019 06 12,"Two recent studies have demonstrated that increases in arousal states lead to an increase people's sense of agency, i.e., the subjective experience of controlling one's own voluntary actions (Minohara et al. in Front Psychol 7:1165, 2016; Wen et al. in Conscious Cogn 36:87-95, 2015). We here extend these findings by showing that arousal states with negative emotional valence, such as fear and anger, decrease sense of agency. Anger and fear are negative emotional states. Anecdotally, they are often invoked as reasons for losing control, and neuroscientific evidence confirms important effects on the brain's action control systems. Surprisingly, the subjective experience of acting in anger or fear has scarcely been investigated experimentally. Thus, the legal notion that these intense emotions may undermine normal voluntary control over actions and outcomes (the 'Loss of Control', a partial defence for murder) lacks any clear evidence base. In three laboratory experiments, we measured sense of agency using an implicit measure based on time perception (the ""intentional binding"" paradigm). These actions occurred in either an emotionally neutral condition, or in a fearful (experiments 1 and 2) or angry state (experiment 3). In line with our hypotheses, fear or anger reduced the subjective sense of control over an action outcome, even though the objective causal link between action and outcome remained the same. This gap between the objective facts of agency, and a reduced subjective experience of agency under emotional conditions, has important implications for society and law."

A vital component of respiratory therapy is managing mechanical ventilation and dealing with death and dying. For most institutions, respiratory therapy is a vital component of the rapid response team, code team, and trauma team. Removal of mechanical ventilation is a duty primarily bestowed upon the respiratory therapist. Exposure to death, on a frequent basis, can take an emotional toll and lead to burnout, stress, and increased turnover. Managers and leaders in the hospital must make efforts to provide counseling and education to support respiratory therapists and their ongoing exposure to death and dying. This paper examines coping mechanisms for physicians and paramedics, resulting in tools that can be used to provide support to the respiratory therapist.",Students' Attitudes Towards Patient Smoking Status During Enrollment in a Pulmonary Rehabilitation Program.,https://www.ncbi.nlm.nih.gov/pubmed/30826833,Journal of allied health,2019 03 03,"The harmful effects of nicotine products are well documented, especially cigarettes. Due to the addictive nature of nicotine, it is often difficult for people who smoke to quit. This study was performed to assess the attitudes of healthcare students regarding enrollment of patients who smoke into a pulmonary rehabilitation program. Public colleges and universities in Texas offering health professions programs were asked to participate if they offered a baccalaureate degree and student enrollment was >5,000. Results were obtained from 114 participants, the majority of whom were from the fields of respiratory therapy and physical therapy. The results revealed that older student participants, >37 yrs old, were less likely to agree to allow a patient who smokes to enroll in a pulmonary rehabilitation program when compared to younger student participants. Students who were more likely to allow patients who smoke to enroll in a pulmonary rehabilitation program were 18- to 22-yr-old women. Females were more likely to agree/strongly agree with allowing a patient who smokes to enroll in a pulmonary rehabilitation program.

Cyclosporine has been shown to have neuroprotective functions. This study investigated the effect of cyclosporine on S100B serum levels and the severity of brain tissue damage in a rat model of cerebral ischemia-reperfusion (I/R). MATERIAL AND METHODS Twelve-week-old Wistar male rats were randomly divided into Control I/R and Cyclosporine I/R groups (n=10 each). Cyclosporine was given orally by gavage for 5 days prior to cerebral I/R, at a total volume of 15 mg/kg/day. The Control group received an equal volume of saline. Body weight was measured and all animals were subjected to 60-min focal ischemia by filament occlusion of the middle cerebral artery. ELISA was used to assess the concentrations of serum S100B and development of brain infarct size and neurological outcomes were determined at 2 and 24 h after occlusion withdrawal. RESULTS Cyclosporine improved the neurological deficit score and decreased the cerebral infarct size and body weight. S100B serum levels were significantly elevated in Cyclosporine-treated rats compared with untreated Control rats during the reperfusion phase. Total infarct size was positively associated with S100B serum levels in the Control I/R group, but no significant correlation was observed in the Cyclosporine I/R group. CONCLUSIONS Cyclosporine seems to affect both ischemia-reperfusion brain tissue damage and S100B protein serum levels. S100B serum level appears to be a state marker for the severity of the cerebral ischemia-reperfusion, rather than a trait marker for Cyclosporine responsiveness.",Interleukin-8 Gene -251 A/T (rs4073) Polymorphism and Coronary Artery Disease Risk: A Meta-Analysis.,https://www.ncbi.nlm.nih.gov/pubmed/30826813,Medical science monitor : international medical journal of experimental and clinical research,2019 04 10,"BACKGROUND Inflammation plays an important role in the pathogenesis of coronary artery disease (CAD). Studies have reported that inflammatory cytokine interleukin-8 (IL-8) gene -251 A/T (rs4073) polymorphism is correlated with CAD susceptibility, but the result remains controversial. The objective of this study was to clarify the association between IL-8 gene -251 A/T polymorphism and CAD risk. MATERIAL AND METHODS A meta-analysis included 8244 patients from 9 individual studies with 10 populations was conducted. Heterogeneity test was conducted, and pooled odds ratio (OR) with 95% confidence interval (CI) was calculated used fixed-effect or random-effects model accordingly. Publication bias was evaluated with the Begg's funnel plot and Egger's test. Sensitivity analysis was also conducted. RESULTS A significant association between IL-8 gene -251 A/T polymorphism and CAD risk was found in the dominant model (OR 1.42, 95% CI 1.16-1.76, P<0.001), recessive model (OR 1.30, 95% CI 1.12-1.52, P<0.001), allelic model (OR 1.28, 95% CI 1.12-1.47, P<0.001), homozygote model (OR 1.59, 95% CI 1.21-2.08, P<0.001), and heterozygote model (OR 1.35, 95% CI 1.11-1.64, P=0.002). Subgroup analysis by ethnicity found significant associations in the Chinese population in the dominant model(OR 1.43, 95% CI 1.26-1.61, P<0.001), recessive model (OR 1.39, 95% CI 1.21-1.59, P<0.001), allelic model (OR 1.31, 95% CI 1.21-1.42, P<0.001), homozygote model (OR 1.66, 95% CI 1.41-1.95, P<0.001), and heterozygote model (OR 1.34, 95% CI 1.18-1.52, P<0.001), but no significant association was found in the Caucasian population. No significant publication bias was found. CONCLUSIONS The IL-8 gene -251 A/T polymorphism was significantly associated with CAD risk in the Chinese population but not in the Caucasian population, -251 A allele carrier had an increased risk of CAD in the Chinese population.",Acute Colonic Pseudo-Obstruction Caused by Dexmedetomidine: A Case Report and Literature Review.,https://www.ncbi.nlm.nih.gov/pubmed/30826812,The American journal of case reports,2019 04 09,"BACKGROUND Acute colonic pseudo-obstruction (ACPO) is an infrequent entity characterized by non-toxic, non-mechanical, abrupt, functional dilation of the colon. Clinically patients present with abdominal distention, anxiety, severe abdominal pain, nausea, and vomiting. This rare entity can lead to a fatal outcome if not recognized early. A high level of suspicions is paramount for early diagnosis and prompt intervention. CASE REPORT A 50-year-old male was admitted to the intensive unit care due to acute hypoxic respiratory failure, pneumonia, and septic shock requiring mechanical ventilation and intravenous vasopressors. Two weeks after admission, his clinical course deteriorated and was complicated with acute abdominal distension, pain, and ileus. Imaging confirmed acute onset of ileus and after ruling out metabolic and infectious causes, the diagnosis of ACPO was made. Aggressive medical and surgical management resulted in a favorable outcome. CONCLUSIONS Critically ill patients on ventilator are commonly sedated; therefore, usual symptoms of ACPO can be missed or misinterpreted leading to late diagnosis with increased morbidity and mortality. Clinicians must be aware of potential harm and side effects from common sedatives used in the intensive care unit and should be current on medical literature. Alpha-2 agonists, i.e., dexmedetomidine, is increasingly been used in critical care setting and there are few reports of a possible association with ACPO. We present here a case of a patient with dexmedetomidine-induced ACPO, and we provide a review of the existing literature and pathophysiology of the condition.",Activity Patterns of Captive Philippine Tarsiers (Tarsius syrichta): Differences Related to Sex and Social Context.,https://www.ncbi.nlm.nih.gov/pubmed/30826810,Folia primatologica; international journal of primatology,2019 04 02,"Among tarsiers, nocturnal, obligatory faunivorous primates inhabiting islands of South-East Asia, the Philippine tarsier (Tarsius [= Carlito] syrichta) is one of the least studied. To date, activity patterns of this threatened species have not been the subject of any investigation. In the present study, we provide the first quantitative data on how captive male and female T. syrichta apportion their time for various activities in two social contexts: solitary and paired. We found that the sexes do not differ in activity budgets during the non-mating season, both spending most of their time scanning, resting, foraging and travelling. Comparison of activity budgets of the sexes between the mating and non-mating seasons revealed that although both tarsiers noticeably increased travelling time at the expense of time spent resting, the male changed his behaviour to a much greater extent than the female. We also report on fluctuations in the tarsiers' activities throughout a night and compare time budgets of T. syrichta with available data on the western and eastern species of tarsiers. The results extend the current knowledge of tarsier behaviour and may also assist in practical considerations for keeping this highly sensitive, difficult-to-breed species in captivity.",Informing Protection Efforts for Critically Endangered Chimpanzees (Pan troglodytes verus) and Sympatric Mammals amidst Rapid Growth of Extractive Industries in Senegal.,https://www.ncbi.nlm.nih.gov/pubmed/30826809,Folia primatologica; international journal of primatology,2019 04 02,"Updated information on Critically Endangered western chimpanzees (Pan troglodytes verus) in Senegal is urgently needed, given that gold mining is rapidly transforming landscapes and livelihoods. Specifically, biodiversity assessments will better elucidate the chimpanzee extinction risk here and yield baselines for monitoring. We compared mammal species richness between Fongoli (unprotected) and Assirik in Niokolo-Koba National Park to assess the efficacy of the only nationally protected area where chimpanzees range in this country. The primary habitat difference between these sites was the degree of human activity. Although Assirik and Fongoli had similar mammal assemblages and were equivalent in primate species richness, the protected area was higher in species richness overall, particularly for ungulates and carnivores. The protected status and management plan of Niokolo-Koba almost certainly resulted in fewer mammal extinctions. In unprotected areas, the flexible behavioural responses of chimpanzees to human-driven landscape dynamics is likely essential to their long-term survival. Furthermore, the near absence of chimpanzee killings in this country greatly facilitates conservation efforts. Given that mineral extraction is a key development strategy in Senegal, we encourage primatologists to collaborate with mining stakeholders to ensure that sustainability programming includes contributions from experts in savannah chimpanzee behavior and ecology.",Simplified Criteria Using Pleural Fluid Cholesterol and Lactate Dehydrogenase to Distinguish between Exudative and Transudative Pleural Effusions.,https://www.ncbi.nlm.nih.gov/pubmed/30826806,Respiration; international review of thoracic diseases,2019 03 29,An important part of the investigation of pleural effusion is the identification of markers that help separate exudate from transudate.,What does best practice care for musculoskeletal pain look like?

We hypothesized that low serum magnesium (SMg) levels independently associate with a significant decline in estimated glomerular filtration rate (eGFR). We analyzed SMg levels in 2056 participants from the Dallas Heart Study, a longitudinal, population-based, multiethnic, cohort study involving residents of Dallas County, Texas, USA. The primary study outcome was the change in eGFR using multivariable linear regression models adjusted for demographics, anthropometric and biochemical parameters, medications, C reactive protein levels, prevalent hypertension and diabetes. During a median follow-up of 7.0 years (25th, 75th percentile: 6.5, 7.6), the median decrease in eGFR was -0.71 (25th, 75th percentile: -2.43, +0.68) mL/min/1.73 m2 per year in the entire cohort. In a fully adjusted model, the lowest SMg quintile (≤1.9 mg/dL or ≤0.8 mM) was associated with a -0.50 mL/min/1.73 m2 per year drop in eGFR (95% CI -0.95 to -0.05; p=0.028) compared with the highest SMg quintile (≥2.3 mg/dL or ≥1.0 mM). Every 0.2 mg/dL (0.08 mM) decrease in SMg was associated with an eGFR decline of -0.23 mL/min/1.73 m2 per year (95% CI -0.38 to -0.08; p=0.003), a decline that was more pronounced in participants with prevalent diabetes compared with patients without diabetes (-0.51 vs -0.18 mL/min/1.73 m2 per year, respectively). In conclusion, low SMg was independently associated with eGFR decline. Further studies are needed to determine whether Mg repletion can ameliorate inflammation, lower blood pressure and serum glucose and ultimately prevent or retard kidney function decline.",Integration of telehealth services in the healthcare system: with emphasis on the experience of patients living with HIV.,https://www.ncbi.nlm.nih.gov/pubmed/30826803,Journal of investigative medicine : the official publication of the American Federation for Clinical Research,2019 05 25,"The US Health Resources and Services Administration defines telehealth as the use of electronic information and telecommunications technologies to support long-distance clinical healthcare, patient and professional health-related education, public health and health administration. Many studies have supported the use of telehealth to increase convenience to patients, improve patient satisfaction, diminish healthcare disparities, and reduce cost that will ultimately lead to improvement in clinical outcomes and quality of care. However, guaranteeing confidentiality, educating patients and providers, and obtaining insurance reimbursement are some of the challenges that face the implementation of telehealth program. The use of telehealth has been investigated in acute infections, such as endocarditis and chronic infections as in hepatitis C, and HIV. The purpose of this review is to focus on the use of telehealth services for people living with HIV (PLWH). For PLWH, telehealth could be particularly useful by connecting specialty providers to an underserved population and addressing many of the factors identified as barriers to HIV care. To date, the literature supports the use of telehealth for the management of chronic diseases including HIV. Most of the studies showed a high acceptability and positive experience with telehealth services among PLWH. However, fewer studies have evaluated telemedicine for chronic direct care of PLWH. Well-designed studies are needed to show that the implementation of telehealth could improve the HIV care continuum. In addition, future research should focus on identifying the group of patients that could benefit the most from such intervention.","Cohort study of healthcare use, costs and diagnoses from onset to 6 months after discharge for takotsubo syndrome in Sweden.",https://www.ncbi.nlm.nih.gov/pubmed/30826802,BMJ open,2019 03 29,"Little is known about the economic impact of takotsubo syndrome (TS) for patients and the health system after initial discharge from hospital.

The short half-life of thoron (55.8 s) makes thoron calibration sources and thoron chambers less common than the corresponding radon (222Rn) ones. In this paper an inexpensive and straight forward but accurate thoron source is described that can easily be set up in typical nuclear environmental laboratories. The source of thoron is a solution of Th(NO3)4 in water. Thoron is extracted by bubbling air through the solution using an aerator. The gamma rays from the solution are measured at the same time. The thoron activity concentration in the exit stream follows from the reduction in the intensity of the gamma rays from the progeny of thoron over time.,Towards an ecological understanding of the killer trait - A reproducible protocol for testing its impact on freshwater ciliates.,https://www.ncbi.nlm.nih.gov/pubmed/30826731,European journal of protistology,2019 04 18,"Paramecium strains with the ability to kill other paramecia often harbour intracellular bacteria belonging to the genera Caedibacter or Caedimonas. Central structures of this killer trait are refractile bodies (R-bodies) produced by the endosymbionts. Once ingested by a sensitive Paramecium, R-bodies presumably act as delivery system for an unidentified toxin which causes the death of endosymbiont-free paramecia while those infected gain resistance from their symbionts. The killer trait is therefore considered as competitive advantage for the hosts of R-body producers. While its effectiveness against paramecia is well documented, the effects on other aquatic ciliates are much less studied. In order to address the broadness of the killer trait, a reproducible killer test assay considering the effects on predatory ciliates (Climacostomum virens and Dileptus jonesi) as well as potential bacterivorous Paramecium competitors (Dexiostoma campyla, Euplotes aediculatus, Euplotes woodruffi, and Spirostomum teres) as possibly susceptible species was established. All used organisms were molecularly characterized to increase traceability and reproducibility. The absence of any lethal effects in both predators and competitors after exposure to killer paramecia strongly suggests a narrow action range for the killer trait. Thus, R-body producing bacteria provide their host with a complex, costly strategy to outcompete symbiont-free congeners only.",Changes in nanomechanical properties and adhesion dynamics of algal cells during their growth.,https://www.ncbi.nlm.nih.gov/pubmed/30826730,"Bioelectrochemistry (Amsterdam, Netherlands)",2019 04 17,"Nanomechanical and structural characterisations of algal cells are of key importance for understanding their adhesion behaviour at interfaces in the aquatic environment. We examine here the nanomechanical properties and adhesion dynamics of the algal cells during two phases of their growth using complementary surface methods and the mathematical modelling. Mechanical properties of motile cells are hard to assess while keeping cells viable, and studies to date have been limited. Immobilisation of negatively charged cells to a positively charged substrate enables high-resolution AFM imaging and nanomechanical measurements. Cells were stiffer and more hydrophobic in the exponential than in the stationary phase, suggesting molecular modification of the cell envelope during aging. The corresponding properties of algal cells were in agreement with the increase of critical interfacial tensions of adhesion, determined amperometrically. Cells in exponential phase possessed a larger cell volume, in agreement with the large amount of amperometrically measured displaced charge at the interface. Differences in the kinetics of adhesion and spreading of cells at the interface were attributed to their various volumes and nanomechanical properties that varied during cell aging. Our findings contribute to the present body of knowledge on the biophysics of algal cells on a fundamental level.",The Transcription Factor ATF7 Controls Adipocyte Differentiation and Thermogenic Gene Programming.,https://www.ncbi.nlm.nih.gov/pubmed/30826729,iScience,2019 03 30,"Adipocytes function as major players in the regulation of metabolic homeostasis, and factors contributing to adipocyte differentiation and function are promising targets for combatting obesity and associated metabolic disorders. Activating transcription factor 7 (ATF7), a stress-responsive chromatin regulator, is involved in energy metabolism, but the underlying mechanisms remain unknown. Herein, we showed that ATF7 is required for adipocyte differentiation and interacts with histone dimethyltransferase G9a in adipocytes to repress the expression of interferon-stimulated genes, which in turn suppress adipogenesis. Ablation of ATF7 promotes beige fat biogenesis in inguinal white adipose tissue. ATF7 binds to transcriptional regulatory regions of the gene encoding uncoupling protein 1, silencing it by controlling histone H3K9 dimethylation. Our findings demonstrate that ATF7 is a multifunctional adipocyte protein involved in the epigenetic control of development and function in adipose tissues.",Kinesin-1 Regulates Extrasynaptic Targeting of NMDARs and Neuronal Vulnerability Toward Excitotoxicity.,https://www.ncbi.nlm.nih.gov/pubmed/30826728,iScience,2019 03 30,"N-methyl-D-aspartate (NMDA) receptor (NMDAR) is highly compartmentalized in neurons, and its dysfunction has been implicated in various neuropsychiatric and neurodegenerative disorders. Recent failure to exploit NMDAR antagonization as a potential therapeutic target has driven the need to identify molecular mechanisms that regulate NMDAR compartmentalization. Here, we report that the reduction of Kif5b, the heavy chain of kinesin-1, protected neurons against NMDA-induced excitotoxicity and ischemia-provoked neurodegeneration. Direct binding of kinesin-1 to the GluN2B cytoplasmic tails regulated the levels of NMDAR at extrasynaptic sites and the subsequent influx of calcium mediated by extrasynaptic NMDAR by regulating the insertion of NMDARs into neuronal surface. Transient increase of Kif5b restored the surface levels of NMDAR and the decreased neuronal susceptibility to NMDA-induced excitotoxicity. The expression of Kif5b was repressed in cerebral ischemia preconditioning. Our findings reveal that kinesin-1 regulates extrasynaptic NMDAR targeting and signaling, and the reduction of kinesin-1 could be exploited to defer neurodegeneration.",Key Amino Acid Substitution for Infection-Enhancing Activity-Free Designer Dengue Vaccines.,https://www.ncbi.nlm.nih.gov/pubmed/30826727,iScience,2019 03 30,"Dengue is a globally important disease caused by four serotypes of dengue virus. Dengue vaccine development has been hampered by antigenic cross-reactivity among serotypes, which potentially causes antibody-dependent enhancement of infection and disease severity. Here we found that a single amino acid substitution in the envelope protein at position 87 from aspartic acid to asparagine or at position 107 from leucine to phenylalanine is critical for suppressing the induction of infection-enhancing antibody in a mouse model. The site and type of amino acid substitution were determined via neutralization escape using an enhancing-activity-only monoclonal antibody that was engineered to reveal neutralizing activity. Mutated dengue type 1 DNA vaccines containing either or both amino acid substitutions induced neutralizing antibodies devoid of enhancing activity against all serotypes. The effect of substitution was further demonstrated using other serotypes and a tetravalent formulation. This finding may contribute to the development of infection-enhancing-activity-free dengue vaccines.",Olfactory Object Recognition Based on Fine-Scale Stimulus Timing in Drosophila.,https://www.ncbi.nlm.nih.gov/pubmed/30826726,iScience,2019 04 03,"Odorants of behaviorally relevant objects (e.g., food sources) intermingle with those from other sources. Therefore to determine whether an odor source is good or bad-without actually visiting it-animals first need to segregate the odorants from different sources. To do so, animals could use temporal stimulus cues, because odorants from one source exhibit correlated fluctuations, whereas odorants from different sources are less correlated. However, the behaviorally relevant timescales of temporal stimulus cues for odor source segregation remain unclear. Using behavioral experiments with free-flying flies, we show that (1) odorant onset asynchrony increases flies' attraction to a mixture of two odorants with opposing innate or learned valence and (2) attraction does not increase when the attractive odorant arrives first. These data suggest that flies can use stimulus onset asynchrony for odor source segregation and imply temporally precise neural mechanisms for encoding odors and for segregating them into distinct objects.",The Effects of Contingent Lullaby Music on Parent-Infant Interaction and Amount of Infant Crying in the First Six Weeks of Life.,https://www.ncbi.nlm.nih.gov/pubmed/30826725,Journal of pediatric nursing,2019 05 13,The purpose of this study was to examine the effect of a live music intervention provided by the mother on full term infants' amount of crying and parent-infant interaction in the first six weeks of life.,Developing a Problem-solving Intervention to Improve Self-Management and Transition Readiness in Adolescents with Sickle Cell Disease.,https://www.ncbi.nlm.nih.gov/pubmed/30826724,Journal of pediatric nursing,2019 05 13,Adolescents and young adults (AYA) with sickle cell disease (SCD) are at risk for serious complications including increased morbidity and early mortality during their transition from pediatric to adult care.

Typical superalkali cations include a central electronegative core with excess metal ligands, OLi3+, for instance, which mimic the properties of alkali metal ions. We report a new series of non-metallic superalkali cations, OxH2x+1+ (x = 1-5) using ab initio MP2/6-311++G(d,p) level. These cations are designed by successive hydration of the hydronium cation (OH3+), which can be expressed in the form of OH3+ … (x-1)H2O complexes. These OxH2x+1+ clusters possess a number of electrostatic as well as partially covalent H-bonds, with the interaction energy in the range 5.2-29.3 kcal/mol as revealed by quantum theory of atoms in molecules analyses. These cations are found to be stable against deprotonation as well as dehydration pathways, and their stability increases with the increase in x. Interestingly, the vertical electron affinities (EAv) of OxH2x+1+ clusters decreases rapidly from 5.16 eV for x = 1 to 2.67 eV for x = 5, which suggest their superalkali nature. It is also possible to continue this series of non-metallic superalkali cations for x > 5 with even lower EAv, down to an approximated limit of 1.85 eV, which is obtained for OH3+ trapped into water cavity implicitly using polarizable continuum model. The findings of this study will establish the OxH2x+1+ clusters as a new series of superalkali cations, which can be exploited for their interesting applications.",A radiopharmaceutical [89Zr]Zr-DFO-nimotuzumab for immunoPET with epidermal growth factor receptor expression in vivo.,https://www.ncbi.nlm.nih.gov/pubmed/30826708,Nuclear medicine and biology,2019 04 03,"The potential of the positron-emitting zirconium-89 (89Zr) (t1/2 = 78.4 h) has been recently reported for immune positron emission tomography (immunoPET) radioimmunoconjugates design.

The results show that this parameter did not significantly affect this process when operating in the laminar regime. However, in the transition regime (Re ≥ 2000), higher flow rates resulted in a faster removal of BMImCl and total organic carbon, making the process more efficient. Following BMImCl degradation, nitrates were generated at the cathode, then reduced at the cathode to ammonium; combination with free chloride produced at the anode led to the transformation of chloride into combined chlorine forms instead of more toxic oxianions such as chlorate and perchlorate. Thus, the flow rate can be a key parameter for defining operating conditions in which the target BMImCl is more effectively degraded with reduced generation of undesirable secondary products.",Evaluation of algal photosynthesis inhibition activity for dissolved organic matter with the consideration of inorganic and coloring constituents.,https://www.ncbi.nlm.nih.gov/pubmed/30826703,Chemosphere,2019 06 03,"The effect of waterborne ingredient on ecosystem has been of great interest.

The wastewater generated by leather industries contains very high pollution parameters due to the presence of a complex mixture of organic and inorganic pollutants even after the treatment at a Common Effluent Treatment Plant (CETP) and disturbs the ecological flora and fauna. The nature, characteristics and toxicity of CETP treated wastewater is yet to be fully elucidated. Thus, this study aims to characterize and evaluate the toxicity of CETP treated tannery wastewater collected from the Unnao district of Uttar Pradesh, India. In addition to measuring the physico-chemical parameters, the residual organic pollutants was identified by GC-MS analysis and phytotoxicity, cytotoxicity and genotoxicity of the treated wastewater was evaluated using Vigna radiata L. and Allium cepa L. Results showed that the treated wastewater contained very high pollution parameters (TDS 3850 mg/L, BOD 680 mg/L, COD-1300 mg/L). GC-MS analysis revealed the presence of various types of residual organic pollutants including benzoic acid, 3-[4,-(T-butyl) Phenyl] furan-2-5-dione, benzeneacetamide, resorcinol, dibutyl phthalate, and benzene-1,2,4-triol. Further, toxicological studies showed the phytotoxic nature of the wastewater as it inhibited seed germination in V. radiata L. and root growth of A. cepa. Genotoxicity was evidenced in the root tip cell of A. cepa where chromosomal aberrations (stickiness, chromosome loss, C-mitosis, and vagrant chromosome) and nuclear abnormalities like micronucleated and binucleated cells were observed. Thus, results suggested that it is not safe to discharge these wastewater into the environment.","Aspergillus niger changes the chemical form of uranium to decrease its biotoxicity, restricts its movement in plant and increase the growth of Syngonium podophyllum.",https://www.ncbi.nlm.nih.gov/pubmed/30826701,Chemosphere,2019 06 03,"Aspergillus niger (A. niger) and Syngonium podophyllum (S. podophyllum) have been used for wastewater treatment, and have exhibited a promising application in recent years.

These differences in values are hypothesised to be due to the involvement of Phe in the phenylpropanoid pathway, by which lignin and other phenolic secondary metabolites are produced, leading to isotopic fractionation and enrichment of the remaining Phe pool available for protein biosynthesis. This results in the more negative Δ15NGlx-Phe values observed in woody plants relative to herbaceous plants, as the former are assumed to produce more lignin. To test this assumption, plant leaf tissue lignin concentrations were estimated by solid state 13C cross-polarisation, magic-angle-spinning (CPMAS) NMR spectroscopy for a subset of plants, which showed that tree foliage has a higher concentration of lignin (12.6 wt%) than herbaceous foliage (6.3 wt%). The correlation of lignin concentration with Δ15NGlx-Phe values demonstrates that the difference in these values with plant type is indeed due to differential production of lignin. The ability to estimate the lignin content of plants from amino acid δ15N values will, to give one example, allow refinement of estimates of herbivore diet in present and past ecosystems, enabling more accurate environmental niche modelling.",Elevated resistin levels may regulate high mobility group box 1 expression in Guillain-Barré syndrome.,https://www.ncbi.nlm.nih.gov/pubmed/30826699,Journal of neuroimmunology,2019 04 01,"Interactions among cytokines have important roles in the inflammatory processes underlying Guillain-Barré syndrome (GBS). Resistin and high mobility group box 1 (HMGB1) are involved in many inflammatory processes. This study examined 51 GBS patients, and found that serum resistin levels were elevated in 51 patients with GBS and correlated with HMGB1 levels. In vitro, resistin induced the release of HMGB1, interleukin (IL)-1β, and IL-6 in THP-1 macrophages. This process was dependent on activation of p38 mitogen-activated protein kinase and NF-κB signaling pathways. These results suggest that signaling between resistin and HMGB1 might be a potential therapeutic target in GBS."

Many randomized controlled trials (RCTs) of interventions for university students with TA have been conducted, but there has been no systematic review of their efficacy. This meta-analysis examines the efficacy of interventions for test-anxious university students in: (i) reducing TA, and (ii) improving academic performance. We searched for RCTs published in English language peer-reviewed journals. Forty-four RCTs met our eligibility criteria (n = 2,209). Interventions were superior to control conditions at post-treatment for reducing TA (g = -0.76) and improving academic performance (g = 0.37). Interventions were superior to control conditions at follow-up. Subgroups analyses found most support for behaviour therapy. Cognitive-behavioural therapy, study skills training, and combined psychological and study skills training interventions show promise but lack evidence for their longer-term efficacy, and results are based upon a small number of studies. Evidence of publication bias was found and poor quality of reporting meant that confidence in results should be moderated.

Clinical,2019 06 15,"Cerebral acidosis is a consequence of secondary injury mechanisms following traumatic brain injury (TBI), including excitotoxicity and ischemia, with potentially significant clinical implications. However, there remains an unmet clinical need for technology for non-invasive, high resolution pH imaging of human TBI for studying metabolic changes following injury. The current study examined 17 patients with TBI and 20 healthy controls using amine chemical exchange saturation transfer echoplanar imaging (CEST EPI), a novel pH-weighted molecular MR imaging technique, on a clinical 3T MR scanner. Results showed significantly elevated pH-weighted image contrast (MTRasym at 3 ppm) in areas of T2 hyperintensity or edema (P < 0.0001), and a strong negative correlation with Glasgow Coma Scale (GCS) at the time of the MRI exam (R2 = 0.4777, P = 0.0021), Glasgow Outcome Scale - Extended (GOSE) at 6 months from injury (R2 = 0.5334, P = 0.0107), and a non-linear correlation with the time from injury to MRI exam (R2 = 0.6317, P = 0.0004).

In recent years, a large number of studies had shown that MPs had various toxicological effects on different organisms. At the same time, a number of studies had also shown that gut microbiota was closely related to host health and as a toxicity target for certain environmental pollutants including MPs. The fact is that more and more studies proved that MPs not only could interact with microorganism directly but also serve as a carrier for other pollutants and interacted with microorganism indirectly. In this review, we summarized the interactions between MPs and microorganisms as well as gut microbiota, and considered the possible impacts of MPs on environmental animal and human health, suggesting that the environmental microorganisms and the gut microbiota of animals were also the very important target for MPs. We hope that more studies pay more attention to focus on the relationship between MPs, gut microbiota, and environmental animals and human health in the future.",Waste problem in European Union and its influence on waste management behaviours.,https://www.ncbi.nlm.nih.gov/pubmed/30826684,The Science of the total environment,2019 03 22,"Waste generation is a critical problem globally and even in the European Union (EU). In EU countries, significant differences have been observed in terms of municipal waste generation. The level of waste generation significantly depended on economic development. The most effective tools for solving the waste problem should be the enhancement of reducing, reusing, and recycling behaviours. However, our results revealed that the level of reducing and reusing behaviours insignificantly influenced waste generation. Thus, countries seeking to minimize waste generation should also pay more attention to the promotion of sustainable consumption and production. Meanwhile, the relationship between recycling behaviour and waste generation was positive and statistically significant. Analysing the determinants of waste management behaviours, attitude to personal waste generation significantly contribute to all waste management behaviours. Meanwhile, attitudes to general waste management significantly but negatively influence waste reducing and recycling behaviours. Thus, only these respondents who understand that they personally contribute to waste problem, more perform waste management behaviours. Furthermore, the efforts to reduce waste significantly influenced only recycling behaviour while attitude to resource efficiency insignificantly determined all waste management behaviours, revealing that people in the EU have a lack of knowledge about the relationship between waste reduction and resource efficiency.","Site- and species-specific climatic responses of two co-occurring shrubs in the temperate Alxa Desert Plateau, northwest China.",https://www.ncbi.nlm.nih.gov/pubmed/30826683,The Science of the total environment,2019 04 16,"In the context of global precipitation anomalies and climate warming, the evolution of fragile desert ecosystems, which account for one-third of the world's land area, will become more complex. Studies of regional climate change and ecosystem response are important components of global climate change research, especially in arid desert regions. Zygophyllum xanthoxylum and Ammopiptanthus mongolicus are two dominant but endangered shrub species in the Alxa Desert in the arid region of central Asia. Using dendrochronological methods, we studied the response of radial growth of those two species to climate factors, and the adaptability of the two shrub populations under a regional warming trend. We found that radial growth of both shrubs was mainly affected by precipitation during the growing season. In additionally, along with the decrease of precipitation and the increase of temperature from east to west of Alxa desert Plateau, the limiting effect of drought during the growing season on radial growth increased. The climate response characteristics and changes between dry and wet periods exhibited spatial and temporal heterogeneity due to micro-level geomorphological factors. Under a regional climate warming trend, individual growth and population development of the two endangered shrubs will be adversely affected. In areas where these species are naturally distributed, populations will gradually become concentrated in micro-geomorphic regions with better soil moisture conditions, such as low-lying areas in the gullies that develop in alluvial fans. This finding has important scientific significance for understanding the development of the region's dominant shrub populations and protection of these and other endangered plants in arid desert areas.",Antibiotic resistance in urban runoff.,https://www.ncbi.nlm.nih.gov/pubmed/30826682,The Science of the total environment,2019 04 16,"Aquatic ecosystems subjected to anthropogenic pressures are places of rapid evolution of microbial communities and likely hotspots for selection and emergence of antibiotic resistant bacteria. In urban settings, water quality and the risk of infection are generally assessed in sewers and in effluents of wastewater treatment plants. Physical and chemical parameters as well as the presence of antibiotics, antibiotic-resistant bacteria and genes of resistance are driven by urban activities, with adverse effects on aquatic ecosystems. In this paper we review the environmental pressures exerted on bacterial communities in urban runoff waters and discuss the impact of these settings on antibiotic resistance. Considering the worrisome epidemiology of infectious diseases and estimated mortality due to antimicrobial resistance in the coming decades, there is an urgent need to identify all environmental reservoirs of resistant bacteria and resistance genes to complete our knowledge of the epidemiological cycle and of the dynamics of urban antibiotic resistance.",Identification of contaminants of concern in the upper Tagus river basin (central Spain). Part 2: Spatio-temporal analysis and ecological risk assessment.,https://www.ncbi.nlm.nih.gov/pubmed/30826681,The Science of the total environment,2019 04 16,"This study provides a description of the water quality status in the tributaries of the upper Tagus River and a preliminary risk assessment for freshwater organisms. A wide range of physico-chemical parameters, nutrients, metals and organic contaminants (20 pesticides, and 32 point source chemicals, mainly pharmaceuticals) were monitored during spring, summer and autumn of 2016. Monitoring of organic contaminants was performed using conventional grab sampling and passive samples (POCIS). The variation of the different groups of parameters as regards to land use and sampling season was investigated. The prioritization of organic and inorganic contaminants was based on the toxic unit (TU) approach, using toxicity data for algae, invertebrates and fish. Finally, the compliance with the Environmental Quality Standards (EQS) set as part of the Water Framework Directive (WFD) was evaluated for the listed substances. This study shows that the land use characteristics had a large influence on the spatial distribution of the contaminants and other water quality parameters, while temporal trends were only significant for physico-chemical parameters, and marginally significant for insecticides. Acute toxicity is likely to occur for some metals (copper and zinc) in the most impacted sites (TU values close to or above 1). Low acute toxicity was determined for organic contaminants (individual compounds and mixtures) on the basis of grab samples. However, the assessment performed with POCIS samples identified diuron, chlorpyrifos and imidacloprid as potentially hazardous compounds. Several contaminant mixtures that may cause chronic toxicity and that should be considered in future regional chemical monitoring plans were identified. Our study also shows that some metals and pesticides exceeded the WFD regulatory thresholds and that only 30% of the sampled sites had a good chemical status. Further research is needed to identify chemical emission sources and to design proper abatement options in the Tagus river basin.","An innovative photoreactor, FluHelik, to promote UVC/H2O2 photochemical reactions: Tertiary treatment of an urban wastewater.",https://www.ncbi.nlm.nih.gov/pubmed/30826680,The Science of the total environment,2019 04 16,"An innovative photoreactor, FluHelik, was used to promote the degradation of contaminants of emerging concern (CECs) by a photochemical UVC/H2O2 process. First, the system was optimized for the oxidation of a model antibiotic, oxytetracycline (OTC), using both ultrapure water (UPW) and a real urban wastewater (UWW) (collected after secondary treatment) as solution matrices. Following, the process was evaluated for the treatment of a UWW spiked with a mixture of OTC and 10 different pharmaceuticals established by the Swiss legislation at residual concentrations (∑CECs <660 μg L-1). The performance of the FluHelik reactor was analyzed both at lab and pre-pilot scale in multiple and single pass flow modes. The efficiency of the FluHelik photoreactor, at lab-scale, was evaluated at different operational conditions (H2O2 concentration, UVC lamp power (4, 6 and 11 W) and flow rate) and further compared with a conventional Jets photoreactor. Both photoreactors exhibited similar OTC removal efficiencies at the best conditions; however, the FluHelik reactor showed to be more efficient (1.3 times) in terms of mineralization when compared with the Jets reactor. Additionally, the efficiency of the UVC/H2O2 photochemical system using the FluHelik photoreactor in reducing the toxicity of the real effluent containing 11 pharmaceuticals was evaluated through zebrafish (Danio rerio) embryo toxicity bioassays.

Conventional technologies available have disadvantages including high energy consumption, the use of chemicals and so on. Here, this study developed an efficient microalgal cell disruption method using the copper oxide nanowire (CuONW)-modified three-dimensional (3D) copper foam electrodes with a low applied voltage. Electrodes with nanowires synthesized at 400 °C, the optimal preparation temperature, achieved efficient microalgal cell electroporation. Microalgal cells were completely inactivated and disrupted at the voltage of 2 V with the hydraulic retention time (HRT) of 10 s. Scanning electron microscopy (SEM) images showed obvious electroporation damage on the cell surface upon electroporation-treatment (2 V, 30 s). The amount of released cellular inclusion increased significantly with prolonged HRT and the energy consumption of this technology was only 0.014 kWh/kg via the treatment of 2 V and 10 s. This study provided a novel, energy-efficient and chemical-free technique for both microalgal products extraction and cell inactivation.","Impact of fertiliser, water table, and warming on celery yield and CO2 and CH4 emissions from fenland agricultural peat.",https://www.ncbi.nlm.nih.gov/pubmed/30826678,The Science of the total environment,2019 04 16,"Peatlands are globally important areas for carbon preservation; although covering only 3% of global land area, they store 30% of total soil carbon. Lowland peat soils can also be very productive for agriculture, but their cultivation requires drainage as most crops are intolerant of root-zone anoxia. This leads to the creation of oxic conditions in which organic matter becomes vulnerable to mineralisation. Given the demand for high quality agricultural land, 40% of the UK's peatlands have been drained for agricultural use. In this study we present the outcomes of a controlled environment experiment conducted on agricultural fen peat to examine possible trade-offs between celery growth (an economically important crop on the agricultural peatlands of eastern England) and emissions of greenhouse gases (carbon dioxide (CO2) and methane (CH4)) at different temperatures (ambient and ambient +5 °C), water table levels (-30 cm, and -50 cm below the surface), and fertiliser use. Raising the water table from -50 cm to -30 cm depressed yields of celery, and at the same time decreased the entire ecosystem CO2 loss by 31%. A 5 °C temperature increase enhanced ecosystem emissions of CO2 by 25% and increased celery dry shoot weight by 23% while not affecting the shoot fresh weight. Fertiliser addition increased both celery yields and soil respiration by 22%. Methane emissions were generally very low and not significantly different from zero. Our results suggest that increasing the water table can lower emissions of greenhouse gases and reduce the rate of peat wastage, but reduces the productivity of celery. If possible, the water table should be raised to -30 cm before and after cultivation, and only decreased during the growing season, as this would reduce the overall greenhouse gas emissions and peat loss, potentially not affecting the production of vegetable crops."

Lead adversely affects a number of tissues and organ systems and the severity of effect on each is dependent on the level and duration of exposure. The most sensitive and notable effects are those that occur on the nervous system. This is particularly the case in the exposure to the fetus, infant and child. Infants and children generally have higher lead exposures on a body weight basis. While lead exposure can come from many sources, a major source of exposure for at least some individuals comes from food. Estimates for the impact of dietary lead on IQ were developed from published total diet studies. While most of these were designed to characterize intake of chemical contaminants on a national basis, some sampled market baskets from a single city. To develop global estimates, default ranges were created for countries with no data which encompassed the values encountered elsewhere. Blood lead levels and IQ decrements were estimated using functions previously developed by the WHO Joint Expert Committee for Food Additives. Since both the exposure and dose response components were variable and uncertain, a two dimensional Monte-Carlo simulation was used to develop the estimates for the impact of dietary lead on IQ. In addition to estimating blood lead and IQ decrements attributable to dietary lead from those countries with published market basket data, simulations were also run for WHO regions that sampled in the variability dimension based on the population size of the individual countries in each region. Dietary exposure to lead occurs throughout the world. The global average IQ decrement attributable to dietary lead was 1.1. The total number of Disability-Adjusted Life Years (DALYs) arising from those IQ decrements were estimated to be 5.2 million DALYs, with an uncertainty range of 0-31 million DALYs.

A halotolerant protease was obtained from the halophile, Lysinibacillus macroides, using animal fleshing as the substrate. The protease was immobilized using ethylene diamine (EDA)/glutaraldehyde functionalized nanoporous activated carbon (EGNPAC). The optimum conditions for the immobilization of protease were determined as time (120 min), pH (6), protease concentration (575-600 U/g), EGNPAC size, salinity, and temperature (30 °C). The immobilization was confirmed by FTIR, TGA-DSC, SEM, and XRD analyses. The adsorption kinetics was consistent with a pseudo first order rate constant of 1.43 × 10-2 min-1.

The device is light weight (700 g), small (70 × 180 × 210 mm) and extremely low-cost (<EUR 130). We provide the electrical circuitry and a detailed parts list for rebuilding the device. We characterize the properties of generated pulses and apply the system for gene delivery into bacterial Dh5α cells. We analyze the transformation efficiency based on the optical density of cell suspensions at 595 nm and on quantitative analysis of images obtained from bacterial cell-grown agar plates using colony forming units as well as confluence as indicators. We demonstrate time-dependency of the transformation efficiency using single pulses of 500 V between 1 and 1000 ms duration and we show that commercially available electroporation cuvettes of 1 mm gap size reveal higher transformation rates compared to cuvettes with 2 mm gap.

In this work, a simple dual-signal amplification strategy has been used to construct a novel nanosensor on single Au nanowire electrodes (SAuNWEs) for miRNA-16 detection based on the ""signal-on"" and ""signal-off"" features during hybridization/de-hybridization process. The ferrocene-labeled aptamer capture probe (Fc-CP-16) is designed to hybridize with thiolated methylene blue-labeled DNA probe (MB-CP) on SAuNWE to form duplex DNA, and the addition of miRNA-16 can lead to the dissociation of duplex structure due to the highly matched sequences between miRNA-16 and Fc-CP-16. The remaining MB-CP can thus tend to recover its hairpin structure at the presence of Mg2+ through the hybridization of its complementary sequences. During this hybridization/de-hybridization process, the changes of Fc and MB oxidation peaks can be recorded, and there has a linear relationship between the sum of dual-signal changes (ΔI=ΔIMB+|ΔIFc|) and the logarithm of miRNA-16 concentrations, which can be used to detect miRNA-16. Including miRNA extraction, the dual-signal amplification strategy for miRNA sensing assay was carried out about 2 h for the detection in real samples.

In particular, we investigated three benchmark effects of reading aloud: lexicality (words vs. pseudowords), frequency (high-frequency vs. low-frequency words), and orthographic familiarity ('familiar' versus 'unfamiliar' pseudowords). We found that words and pseudowords elicited robust SSVEPs. Words showed larger SSVEPs than pseudowords and high-frequency words showed larger SSVEPs than low-frequency words. SSVEPs were not sensitive to orthographic familiarity. We further localized the neural generators of the SSVEP effects. The lexicality effect was located in areas associated with early level of visual processing, i.e. in the right occipital lobe and in the right precuneus. Pseudowords produced more activation than words in left sensorimotor areas, rolandic operculum, insula, supramarginal gyrus and in the right temporal gyrus. These areas are devoted to speech processing and/or spelling-to-sound conversion. The frequency effect involved the left temporal pole and orbitofrontal cortex, areas previously implicated in semantic processing and stimulus-response associations respectively, and the right postcentral and parietal inferior gyri, possibly indicating the involvement of the right attentional network.",The genome of the freshwater water flea Daphnia magna: A potential use for freshwater molecular ecotoxicology.,https://www.ncbi.nlm.nih.gov/pubmed/30826642,"Aquatic toxicology (Amsterdam, Netherlands)",2019 05 10,"The water flea Daphnia magna is a small planktonic cladoceran. D. magna has been used as a model species for ecotoxicology, as it is sensitive to environmental stressors and environmental changes. Since Daphnia is affected by culture environment and each population/strain has its own ecological and genetic characteristics, its population/strain-based genome information is useful for environmental genomic studies. In this study, we assembled and characterized the genome of D. magna. Using a high-density genetic map of D. magna xinb3, the draft genome was integrated to 10 linkage groups (LGs). The total length of the integrated genome was about 123 Mb with N50 = 10.1 Mb, and the number of scaffolds was 4193 including 10 LGs. A total of 15,721 genes were annotated after manual curation. Orthologous genes were characterized in the genome and compared with other genomes of Daphnia. In addition, we identified defense related genes such as cytochrome P450 (CYP) genes, glutathione S-transferase (GST) genes, and ATP-binding cassette (ABC) genes from the assembled D. magna genome for its potential use in molecular ecotoxicological studies in the freshwater environment. This genomic resource will be helpful to study for a better understanding on molecular mechanism in response to various pollutants.",Insight into antibiotics removal: Exploring the photocatalytic performance of a Fe3O4/ZnO nanocomposite in a novel magnetic sequential batch reactor.,https://www.ncbi.nlm.nih.gov/pubmed/30826641,Journal of environmental management,2019 03 26,"The purpose of this research was the preparation and photocatalytic evaluation of a novel nanocomposite (NC) based on Fe3O4/ZnO, to eliminate four persistent antibiotics in surface waters: sulfamethoxazole, trimethoprim, erythromycin and roxithromycin. Prior to the operation of the photocatalytic reactor, the influence of pH (3-9), catalyst concentration (50-800 mg L-1), oxidant dose (0-100 mg L-1) and concentration of different targets (10-100 μg L-1) on the catalytic efficiency was evaluated. The analysis of reaction kinetics showed that degradation processes of the four antibiotics followed a pseudo-first-order kinetic model. Antibiotics adsorption onto the nanocomposite surface depended on their electrostatic nature and played an important role when decreasing the initial concentration of antibiotics. In this context, kinetic rates were higher at lower initial levels of organic pollutants, which is a favourable effect from a practical application perspective. On the other hand, a synergistic effect of the available Fe in the nanocomposite was found, contributing to the oxidation of antibiotics by photo-Fenton as a secondary reaction. Then, a magnetic photocatalytic reactor was operated under optimal conditions. The enhanced photonic efficiency of Fe3O4/ZnO in the system, as well as the ease of the magnetic separation and catalyst reusability, indicate the viability of this reactor configuration.",A catalyst selection method for hydrogen production through Water-Gas Shift Reaction using artificial neural networks.,https://www.ncbi.nlm.nih.gov/pubmed/30826640,Journal of environmental management,2019 03 26,"Hydrogen (H2) is considered a clean valuable energy source and its worldwide demand has increased in recent years. The Water-Gas Shift (WGS) Reaction is one of the major routes for hydrogen production and uses different catalysts depending on the operating process conditions. A catalyst is usually composed of an active phase and a support for its dispersion. There are currently an increasing number of researches on catalytic field focusing on transition metals nanoparticles supported on different compounds. In order to predict optimal catalyst compositions for the WGS reaction, Artificial Neural Networks (ANNs) were used to build a model from the literature catalytic data. A three-layer feedforward neural network was employed with active phase composition and support type as some of the input variables, and Carbon Monoxide (CO) conversion as output variable. The insertion of properties such as surface area, calcination temperature and time allowed predicting the reaction performance based on intrinsic catalyst variables not commonly used in phenomenological kinetic models. Also, unlike previous studies, a detailed sensitivity analysis was carried out to observe useful trends. An important outcome of this work is the proposition of ceria-supported catalysts for the WGS reaction that present larger surface areas, with Ru, Ni or Cu as active phases conducted at moderate temperatures (≈300 °C) and with reasonable space velocities (2000-6000 h-1). In addition, it was possible to predict the most relevant variables for the process: the temperature and the surface area. Thus, the results show the power of ANNs for predicting better catalysts and conditions for this important process in the environmental field.",Determination of specific LNAPL volumes in soils having a multimodal pore-size distribution.,https://www.ncbi.nlm.nih.gov/pubmed/30826639,Journal of environmental management,2019 03 26,"In this paper we present modifications to previously published models for determining the specific volume of non-aqueous phase liquids (LNAPLs) in the subsurface at and near the groundwater table following a spill or leak from the soil surface. The modifications account for porous media having multimodal pore-size distributions as is often the case with tropical soils. Data from the literature are used to show that the use of multimodal pore-size distributions can lead to significantly different subsurface LNAPL specific volume predictions and possible LNAPL recovery rates, compared to when only unimodal pore-size distributions are considered. Differences of up to 200% are possible when the dual-porosity nature of the pore system is ignored, which can yield erroneous estimates of the time needed to remediate LNAPLs from contaminated areas when conventional systems are employed.",Are per capita carbon emissions predictable across countries?,https://www.ncbi.nlm.nih.gov/pubmed/30826638,Journal of environmental management,2019 03 26,"China and other developing countries in Asia follow similar economic growth patterns described by the flying geese (FG) model, which explains the ""catching-up"" process of industrialization in latecomer economies. Japan, newly industrialized economies, and China have followed this path, with similar economic development trajectories.

When dealing with soil contaminated with arsenic and/or lead, which are non-essential elements for plants but also among the most toxic metals, this task is particularly difficult to achieve. In a previous contribution we showed that metals accumulation by Lupinus albus, Brassica juncea and Helianthus annuus can be improved by dosing suitable chemicals (i.e. phosphate and EDTA), leading to a quicker and cheaper intervention. This study discusses the assisted phytoremediation of a real site contaminated by several metals, presenting an environmental assessment realized by using the GaBi LCA software. The environmental sustainability of the reclamation technology was analyzed in terms of Global Warming Potential (GWP-100 years), considering different destinations for the harvested biomass, and comparing its ecological footprint with the outcomes of a conventional treatment of excavation and landfill disposal. The comparison clearly shows the great advantage of the phytoremediation, in terms of environmental impact, highlighting the importance of correctly handling the disposal of contaminated biomass produced. In fact, its incineration (aimed at reducing the volumes to be disposed of) could be more onerous than a direct landfilling, but re-qualify as a more sustainable choice if combined with energy recovery. The same applies to fast pyrolysis, which seems to be the most sustainable approach to date, at least in terms of technological maturity, although this requires technical-economic considerations on the quality and use of biofuels produced.",Sorption mechanism and distribution of cadmium by different microbial species.,https://www.ncbi.nlm.nih.gov/pubmed/30826636,Journal of environmental management,2019 03 26,"Bioremediation programs of cadmium (Cd) by microorganisms have being proposed, but the underlying mechanism of the remediation ion remains unexplored. Here, the sorption efficiency and subcellular fraction distribution of Cd in three selected microbial species were investigated. Our results showed that both species of the microorganisms and initial Cd concentrations strongly affected the Cd sorption capacity. In the three microbial species, the Cd removal efficiency increased with decreased Cd concentrations. Specifically, Hansenula anomala removed the highest Cd ions in low concentration of 0.05 mg L-1; while in medium concentration of 0.5 mg L-1 and high concentration of 5 mg L-1, Bacillus subtilis removed the highest Cd ions. The subcellular fractionation allocation showed that Cd was mainly allocated on cell wall (mantle and inner wall) in Pseudomonas stutzeri and B. subtilis, while cell cytomembrane accumulated similar amount of Cd compared to the cell wall of H. anomala at concentration of 0.5 mg L-1. Meanwhile, the Cd distributions on cell subcellular fractionation of the three species changed along the contact times, suggesting varied migration models during the biosorption process. Moreover, the functional groups involved in biosorption differed among the species based on Fourier Transform Infrared (FTIR) analysis. Our results have important implications for developing and improving Cd remediation by microorganisms, which is a low-cost and environmentally friendly bioremediation strategy of Cd pollution in environments.",Influences of operating parameters on liquefaction performances of Tetra Pak in sub-/supercritical water.,https://www.ncbi.nlm.nih.gov/pubmed/30826635,Journal of environmental management,2019 03 26,"Liquefaction performances of waste Tetra Pak in sub-/supercritical water were evaluated in micro-batch reactors.

The results showed that bio-oil yield firstly increased with increasing temperature and then decreased when the temperature exceeded 360 °C. Reaction time longer than 30 min gave a negative effect on bio-oil yield. The influence of pressure on bio-oil yield increased markedly from 16 MPa to 22 MPa, and then stabilized.

The sodium iodide symporter (NIS) is a transmembrane glycoprotein that mediates iodide uptake into the thyroid as the initial step of TH biosynthesis. Previously, we screened 293 ToxCast chemicals (ph1v2) using a HEK293T cell line expressing human NIS in parallel radioactive iodide uptake (RAIU) and cell viability assays to identify potential environmental NIS inhibitors. Here, we expanded NIS inhibitor screening for a set of 768 ToxCast Phase II (ph2) chemicals, and applied a novel computational toxicology approach based on the ToxPrint chemotype to identify chemical substructures associated with NIS inhibition. Following single-concentration screening (at 1 × 10-4 M with a 20% inhibition cutoff), 235 samples (228 chemicals) were further tested in multiple-concentration (1 × 10-9 - 1 × 10-4 M) format in both RAIU and cell viability assays. The 167 chemicals that exhibited significant RAIU inhibition were then prioritized using combined RAIU and cell viability responses that were normalized relative to the known NIS inhibitor sodium perchlorate. Some of the highest ranked chemicals, such as PFOS, tributyltin chloride, and triclocarban, have been previously reported to be thyroid disruptors. In addition, several novel chemicals were identified as potent NIS inhibitors. The present results were combined with the previous ph1v2 screening results to produce two sets of binary hit-calls for 1028 unique chemicals, consisting of 273 positives exhibiting significant RAIU inhibition, and 63 positives following application of a cell viability filter. A ToxPrint chemotype-enrichment analysis identified >20 distinct chemical substructural features, represented in >60% of the active chemicals, as significantly enriched in each NIS inhibition hit-call space. A shared set of 9 chemotypes enriched in both hit-call sets indicates stable chemotype signals (insensitive to cytotoxicity filters) that can help guide structure-activity relationship (SAR) investigations and inform future research.",Epigenetic marks of prenatal air pollution exposure found in multiple tissues relevant for child health.,https://www.ncbi.nlm.nih.gov/pubmed/30826615,Environment international,2019 04 04,"Prenatal air pollution exposure has been linked to many adverse health conditions in the offspring.

However, large-scale quantitative data on antibiotic resistome from the pristine and anthropogenic environments remains largely unexplored. Here, we used metagenome-wide analysis to investigate the share and divergence in ARG profiles and their potential bacterial hosts between the pristine and gut-associated environments. We found that the abundance of total ARGs in gut-associated environments was significantly higher than the pristine environments (P < 0.001). The mcr-1 and tetX, the genes resistant to the last resort antibiotics (colistin and tigecycline, respectively), were in high abundance (4.57 copies/Gb and 3.39 copies/Gb, respectively) in gut-associated environments, suggesting the ARG pollution caused by anthropogenic antibiotics. Metagenomic assembly-based host-tracking analysis identified Escherichia, Bacteroides, and Clostridium as the predominant bacterial hosts of ARGs in gut-associated environments, while Alteromonas, Vibrio, and Proteobacteria as the predominant bacterial hosts of ARGs in pristine environments. We first described the broad diversity of ARG hosts in different environments using metagenome-wide analysis.

This study proposes a low-carbon, cement-free, clay-based approach for simultaneous S/S of As and Pb in the contaminated soil, and accordingly elucidates the chemical interactions between alkali-activated clay binders and potentially toxic elements. Quantitative X-ray diffraction and 27Al nuclear magnetic resonance analyses indicated that the addition of lime effectively activated the hydration of kaolinite clay, and the presence of limestone further enhanced the polymerization of hydrates. X-ray photoelectron spectroscopy showed that approximately 19% of As[III] was oxidized to As[V] in the alkali-activated clay system, which reduced toxicity and facilitated immobilization of As. During the cement-free S/S process, As and Pb consumed Ca(OH)2 and precipitated as Ca3(AsO4)2·4H2O and Pb3(NO3)(OH)5, respectively, accounting for the low leachability of As (7.0%) and Pb (5.4%). However, the reduced amount of Ca(OH)2 decreased the degree of hydration of clay minerals, and the pH buffering capacity of the contaminated soil hindered the pH increase. Sufficient dosage of lime was required for ensuring satisfactory solidification and contaminant immobilization of the clay-based S/S products. The leachability of As and Pb in high-Ca S/S treated soil samples was reduced by 96.2% and 98.8%, respectively. This is the first study developing a green and cement-free S/S of As- and Pb-contaminated soil using clay minerals as an environmentally compatible binding material.",Predicting ozone levels from climatic parameters and leaf traits of Bel-W3 tobacco variety.,https://www.ncbi.nlm.nih.gov/pubmed/30826610,"Environmental pollution (Barking, Essex : 1987)",2019 05 14,"Air pollution has been identified as a major cause of environmental and human health damage. O3 is an oxidative pollutant that causes leaf symptoms in sensitive plants. This study aims to adjust a multilinear model for the monitoring of O3 in subtropical climatic conditions by associating O3 concentrations with measurements of morphological leaf traits in tobacco plants and different environmental variables. The plants were distributed into five areas (residential, urban or industrial) in the southern region of Brazil and exposed during 14 periods, of 14 days each, during the years of 2014 and 2015. The environmental variables and leaf traits during the exposure periods were described by mean, median, standard deviation and minimum and maximum values. Spearman correlation and multiple linear regression analyses were applied on data from exposure periods. Leaf injury index, leaf area, leaf dry mass, temperature, relative humidity, global solar radiation and accumulated rainfall were used in the regression analyses to select the best models for predicting O3 concentrations. Leaf injury characteristically caused by O3 was verified in all areas and periods of plant exposure. Higher values of leaf injury (24.5% and 27.7%) were registered in the 13th and 12th exposure periods during spring and in areas influenced by urban and industrial clutches. The VPD, temperature, global solar radiation and O3 were correlated to leaf injury. Environmental variables [leaf area, leaf dry mass, global solar radiation and accumulated rainfall] and primarily the VPD were fundamental to improve the adjustments done in the bioindicator model (R2 ≥ 0.73). Our research shows that biomonitoring employing the tobacco ""Bel-W3"" can be improved by measuring morphological leaf traits and meteorological parameters. Additionally, O3 fumigation experiment should be performed with biomonitoring as conducted in this study, which are useful in understanding the role of other environmental factors.",Proliferation of antibiotic resistance genes in coastal recirculating mariculture system.,https://www.ncbi.nlm.nih.gov/pubmed/30826609,"Environmental pollution (Barking, Essex : 1987)",2019 05 14,"The abuse of antibiotics has caused the propagation of antibiotic resistance genes (ARGs) in aquaculture systems. Although the recirculating systems have been considered as a promising approach for preventing the coastal water pollution of antibiotics and ARG, rare information is available on the distribution and proliferation of ARGs in the recirculating mariculture system. This study firstly investigated the proliferation of ARGs in coastal recirculating mariculture systems. Ten subtypes of ARGs including tet (tetB, tetG, tetX), sul (sul1, sul2), qnr (qnrA, qnrB, qnrS), and erm (ermF, ermT) were detected. The absolute abundances of the ARGs detected in the mariculture farm were more than 1 × 104 copies/mL. The sulfonamide resistance genes (sul1 and sul2) were the most abundant ARGs with the abundance of 3.5 × 107-6.5 × 1010 copies/mL. No obvious correlation existed between the antibiotics and ARGs. Some bacteria were positively correlated with two or more ARGs to indicate the occurrence of multidrug resistance. The fluidized-bed biofilter for wastewater treatment in the recirculating system was the main breeding ground for ARGs while the UV sterilization process could reduce the ARGs. The highest flux of ARGs (6.5 × 1021 copies/d) indicated that the discharge of feces and residual baits was the main gateway for ARGs in the recirculating mariculture system to enter the environments.",Transfer of pyrrolizidine alkaloids between living plants: A disregarded source of contaminations.,https://www.ncbi.nlm.nih.gov/pubmed/30826608,"Environmental pollution (Barking, Essex : 1987)",2019 05 14,"To elucidate the origin of the wide-spread contaminations of plant derived commodities with various alkaloids, we employed co-cultures of pyrrolizidine alkaloid (PA) containing Senecio jacobaea plants with various alkaloid free acceptor plants. Our analyses revealed that all plants grown in the vicinity of the Senecio donor plants indeed contain significant amounts of the PAs, which previously had been synthesized in the Senecio plants. These findings illustrate that typical secondary metabolites, such as pyrrolizidine alkaloids, are commonly transferred and exchanged between living plants. In contrast to the broad spectrum of alkaloids in Senecio, in the acceptor plants nearly exclusively jacobine is accumulated. This indicates that this alkaloid is exuded specifically by the Senecio roots. Although the path of alkaloid transfer from living donor plants is not yet fully elucidated, these novel insights will extend and change our understanding of plant-plant interactions and reveal a high relevance with respect to the widespread alkaloidal contaminations of plant-derived commodities. Moreover, they could be the basis for the understanding of various so far not fully understood phenomena in cultivation of various crops, e.g. the beneficial effects of crop rotations or the co-cultivation of certain vegetables.",K2Ti6O13 hybridized graphene oxide: Effective enhancement in photodegradation of RhB and photoreduction of U(VI).,https://www.ncbi.nlm.nih.gov/pubmed/30826607,"Environmental pollution (Barking, Essex : 1987)",2019 05 14,"The environmental pollutions by organic pollutants and radionuclides have aroused great concern. Developing highly efficient elimination methods becomes an imperious demand. In this study, a nanocomposite of K2Ti6O13 (KTO) nanobelts hybridized graphene oxide (GO) nanosheets (GO/KTO) was used to photodegrade RhB (dye) and photoreduce U(VI) (radionuclide), which was synthesized by a facile hydrothermal method. The adsorption capacity and the slope (k) of the curve -ln(C/C) versus time in photodegradation of RhB by GO/KTO were higher than that by GO and KTO. In the presence of different free radical scavengers, superoxide radical (·O2-) was found to play the most significant role in the reaction. The XPS experiment indicates U(VI) was successfully photoreduced to less toxic U(IV). The pH dependent photocatalytic experiments on RhB and U(VI) both showed the best performance at neutral pH value (from pH 6 to pH 8). To investigate the reason for the enhanced photocatalysis of GO/KTO, the morphology/microstructure, optical and photo-electrochemical properties were examined. The enhanced abilities of separation of photo electrons and holes and the adsorption of GO/KTO were ascribed to the structure of KTO nanobelts laying on the surface of GO nanosheets, which may maximize the contacting area between KTO and GO, and thus greatly reduce the surface related oxygen defects to enhance the electron interface transfer between KTO and GO and decrease the recombination efficiency of electrons and holes. These results showed the GO/KTO has great application potential in environmental treatment of organic pollutants and high valent heavy/radionuclide ions at neutral condition."

The PCF consists of an equilibrium approach describing ion speciation and pairing, kinetic minerals precipitation (such as hydrous ferric oxides (HFO) and FePO4) as well as adsorption and co-precipitation. Model performance is assessed against data sets from the pilot plant, evaluating the capability to describe water and sludge lines across the treatment process under steady-state operation. Simulated phosphorus differed as little as 5-10% (relative) from measured phosphorus, indicating that the model was representative of reality. The study also shows that environmental factors such as pH, as well operating conditions such as Fe/P molar ratios (1, 1.5 and 2), influence the concentration of dissolved phosphate in the effluent. The time constant of simultaneous precipitation in the calibrated model, due to a step change decrease/increase in FeSO4 dosage, was found to be roughly 5 days, indicating a slow dynamic response due to a multi-step process involving dissolution, oxidation, precipitation, aging, adsorption and co-precipitation. The persistence effect of accumulated iron-precipitates (HFO particulates) in the activated sludge seemed important for phosphorus removal, and therefore solids retention time plays a crucial role according to the model. The aerobic tank was deemed to be the most suitable dosing location for FeSO4 addition, due to high dissolved oxygen levels and good mixing conditions. Finally, dynamic model-based analyses show the benefits of using automatic control when dosing chemicals.",NaLa(CO3)2 hybridized with Fe3O4 for efficient phosphate removal: Synthesis and adsorption mechanistic study.,https://www.ncbi.nlm.nih.gov/pubmed/30826591,Water research,2019 03 26,"Effectively eutrophication control and phosphate recovery have received increasing attention in recent years. In this study, a regenerable magnetic NaLa(CO3)2/Fe3O4 composites (MLC) which includes a novel phosphate-binding lanthanum species NaLa(CO3)2 hybridized with Fe3O4 nanoparticle was developed through a modified solvothermal method for phosphate removal from contaminated water. Based upon preliminary screening of synthesized MLC with different La-to-Fe molar ratios in terms of phosphate adsorption capacity and synthetic product yield, a MLC composite with a La-to-Fe molar ratio of 2:1 (MLC-21) was selected for further characterization and evaluation. MLC-21 exhibits a high magnetic separation efficiency of 97%, high phosphate adsorption capacity of 77.85 mg P/g, wide applicable scope of pH ranging from 4 to 11, excellent selectivity for phosphate in the presence of competing ions (Cl-, NO3-, HCO3-, SO42-, Ca2+, and Mg2+), good reusability with above 98% desorption efficiency using NaOHNaCl mixture and 83% adsorption capacity remained during five recycles. Furthermore, a real effluent wastewater with phosphate concentration of 1.96 mg P/L was used to verify the performance of MLC-21 through a magnetic separation integrated system (AMSS). By using the response surface methodology (RSM), the optimum parameters were determined to be 0.26 g/L of adsorbent dosage, 26.28 h of adsorption time and 24.12 min of magnetic separation time for meeting the phosphate emission standard of 0.5 mg P/L. The phosphorus in three representative eutrophic water bodies can be efficiently reduced to below 0.1 mg P/L by MLC-21 adsorption at different dosages. Electrostatic attraction and the inner-sphere complexation between La(HCO3)2+/La(CO3)2- and P via ligand exchange forming LaPO4 were responsible for the phosphate adsorption mechanisms of MLC.",Identification of four novel mutations in MYO7A gene and their association with nonsyndromic deafness and Usher Syndrome 1B.,https://www.ncbi.nlm.nih.gov/pubmed/30826590,International journal of pediatric otorhinolaryngology,2019 05 14,"MYO7A gene has been shown to be associated with Usher syndrome 1B and nonsyndromic deafness.

The case for a metal-mediated tau aggregation.,https://www.ncbi.nlm.nih.gov/pubmed/30826589,Journal of inorganic biochemistry,2019 03 29,"Tau protein aggregation and its hyperphosphorylation play an important role in the pathogenesis of Alzheimer's disease. There is also considerable evidence for the accumulation of Fe2/3+, Cu2+, and Zn2+ in the brain of Alzheimer's patients, although their involvement in the etiology of the disease remains unknown. Here, interactions of the 3d metal ions Fe2/3+, Cu2+, and Zn2+ with the longest isoform of the human tau protein (htau40) are studied in detail. Electrospray mass spectrometry and ion mobility mass spectrometry analyses confirm the interactions of metal species with tau and that these interactions cause structural changes. Phosphorylation of the full-length htau40 with glycogen synthase kinase 3β (GSK3β), a protein kinase, causes a reduction in metal interactions. Transmission electron microscopy studies of the tau aggregates formed in the presence of metal ions suggest that the presence of metal ions influences the aggregation process. Fluorescence studies of full-length htau40 in the presence of Cu2+ indicate the formation of reactive oxygen species, which may contribute further to oxidative stress and neuronal death.","Development of a series of 4-hydroxycoumarin platinum(IV) hybrids as antitumor agents: Synthesis, biological evaluation and action mechanism investigation.",https://www.ncbi.nlm.nih.gov/pubmed/30826588,Journal of inorganic biochemistry,2019 03 29,"A series of new 4-hydroxycoumarin platinum(IV) complexes were designed, synthesized and evaluated as antitumor agents. All the title compounds display moderate to effective antitumor activities toward the tested cell lines and two prominent compounds were screened out with activities comparable to cisplatin and oxaliplatin. The mechanism investigation demonstrates that the platinum(IV) compounds could be reduced to bivalence and exert significant genotoxicity to tumor cells. Meanwhile the coumarin moiety endows the title compounds with cyclooxygenase inhibitory competence which might favour the reduction of tumor-related inflammation and further influence tumor proliferation. The coumarin platinum(IV) complex could effectively induce apoptosis of SKOV-3 cells through up-regulating the expression of caspase3 and caspase9. Furthermore, the conversion of platinum(II) drugs to platinum(IV) form via the conjunction with 4-hydroxycoumarin enhances the drug uptake in whole cells and DNA simultaneously. Moreover, the 4-hydroxycoumarin platinum(IV) complex could combine with human serum albumin via van der Waals force and hydrogen bond, which would influence their transport and bioactivities in vivo.",Return to play after conservative and surgical treatment in athletes with spondylolysis: A systematic review.,https://www.ncbi.nlm.nih.gov/pubmed/30826586,Physical therapy in sport : official journal of the Association of Chartered Physiotherapists in Sports Medicine,2019 05 03,Analyze the return to sports rate and timing after conservative and surgical treatment in athletes with spondylolysis.,Government of Malawi's unconditional cash transfer improves youth mental health.,https://www.ncbi.nlm.nih.gov/pubmed/30826585,Social science & medicine (1982),2019 03 15,"We explore the impacts of Malawi's national unconditional cash transfer program targeting ultra-poor households on youth mental health. Experimental findings show that the program significantly improved mental health outcomes. Among girls in particular, the program reduces indications of depression by about 15 percentage points. We investigate the contribution of different possible pathways to the overall program impact, including education, health, consumption, caregiver's stress levels and life satisfaction, perceived social support, and participation in hard and unpleasant work. The pathways explain from 46 to 65 percent of the program impact, advancing our understanding of how economic interventions can affect mental health of youth in resource-poor settings. The findings underline that unconditional cash grants, which are used on an increasingly large scale as part of national social protection systems in Sub-Saharan Africa, have the potential to improve youth mental wellbeing and thus may help break the vicious cycle of poverty and poor mental health."

B, Biointerfaces",2019 05 22,"Use of soluble factors is the most common strategy to induce osteogenic differentiation of mesenchymal stem cells (MSCs) in vitro, but it may raise potential side effects in vivo. The topographies of the substrate surfaces affect cell behavior, and this could be a promising approach to guide stem cell differentiation. Micropillars have been reported to modulate cellular and subcellular shape, and it is particularly interesting to investigate whether these changes in cell morphology can modulate gene expression and lineage commitment without chemical induction. In this study, poly(methyl methacrylate) (PMMA) films were decorated with square prism micropillars with different lateral dimensions (4, 8 and 16 μm), and the surface wettability of the substrates was altered by oxygen plasma treatment. Both, pattern dimensions and hydrophilicity, were found to affect the attachment, proliferation, and most importantly, gene expression of human dental pulp mesenchymal stem cells (DPSCs). Decreasing the pillar width and interpillar spacing of the square prism pillars enhanced cell attachment, cell elongation, and deformation of nuclei, but reduced early proliferation rate. Surfaces with 4 or 8 μm wide pillars/gaps upregulated the expression of early bone-marker genes and mineralization over 28 days of culture. Exposure to oxygen plasma increased wettability and promoted cell attachment and proliferation but delayed osteogenesis. Our findings showed that surface topography and chemistry are very useful tools in controlling cell behavior on substrates and they can also help create better implants. The most important finding is that hydrophobic micropillars on polymeric substrate surfaces can be exploited in inducing osteogenic differentiation of MSCs without any differentiation supplements.",Studied on the dynamic adsorption process of Lycium barbarum polysaccharide in the POPC/DPPC monolayers.,https://www.ncbi.nlm.nih.gov/pubmed/30826552,"Colloids and surfaces.

Comparing the pure lipid monolayer with the mixed monolayers, the π-A isotherms of the mixed monolayers shifted to larger molecular areas when LBP was added to the subphase. The compression modulus showed that the compressibility of the monolayer films decreased with the addition of LBP. Adsorption curves revealed that the variation in the surface pressure of LBP with POPC was larger than that with DPPC. This phenomenon was verified by the AFM images and the number of each lipid molecule combining with polysaccharide molecules in the mixed monolayer (Ap value), indicating that hydrophobic interactions between LBP and POPC are stronger than those of DPPC.

Diet supplemented with 0.30% arachidonic acid (ARA) has been found to reduce adipogenesis and inflammation in grass carp, but the potential mechanism is not comprehensively understood. To fully reveal the effects of dietary ARA on the mRNA profiles of adipose tissue, transcriptome techniques were applied in this study. A 10-weeks feeding experiment was performed using two isonitrogenous and isoenergetic purified diets, namely ARA-free (control) and 0.30% ARA (ARA group). Results showed increased ARA content and decreased intraperitoneal fat index and adipocyte size in the adipose tissue of fish fed ARA (P < 0.05). A total of 611 and 973 genes of the adipose tissue were significantly up-regulated and down-regulated, respectively, in fish fed ARA (P < 0.05). Dietary ARA upregulated LOX pathway but downregulated CYP450 pathway annotated genes expression. A total of 65 cell development annotated genes including 30 adipocyte proliferation, 21 adipocyte differentiation, and 14 cell apoptosis annotated genes were down-regulated in the ARA group. In addition, 19 lipid catabolism annotated genes were increased. The mRNA expression levels of 5 chemokines, 10 cytokines, 26 cytokine and chemokine receptors, 15 cell adhesion, 6 oxidative stress, and 6 angiogenesis annotated genes were all down-regulated in fish fed ARA.

The ∑PFASs concentrations of surface water, groundwater, soil and sediment ranged from 5.839 to 120.885 ng/L, 1.426 to 17.138 ng/L, 0.622 to 5.089 μg/kg dw, and 0.240 to 1.210 μg/kg dw respectively. Some short-chained (C4-C8) PFASs were detected widely such as PFOA, PFBA, PFHxA, PFBS, PFHpA and PFPeA in surface water and groundwater, with the detection frequency of ＞78%, and PFBA and PFOA dominated in the 17 PFASs. In addition, the correlations between total PFASs and TOC were significant at 0.05 level, especially in surface water with R2 = 0.9165 (p = 0.011). In terms of vertical distribution characteristics of ∑PFASs, the ∑PFASs in four sediment cores showed a decreasing trend at first, and then an increasing trend from the bottom to the top associated with TOC. PFBA/PFOA and PFHpA/PFOA showed better linear correlations with R2 of 0.5541 (p = 0.039), and for PFNA/PFOA and PFHpA/PFOA with R2 of 0.6312 (p = 0.032) at the 0.05 level in the surface water, which indicated that sewage and atmospheric precipitation were the major sources. Though the RQ results based on the measured concentrations and reference values in environmental media revealed lower risks, the potential hazard may occur due to accumulation characteristics and long-distance transmission capability of PFASs. Hence, the corresponding management strategies should be taken, such as control over emission at source, product substitution and strengthening legislation, to eliminate potential risks to human health.","Endophytic bacteria isolated from Solanum nigrum L., alleviate cadmium (Cd) stress response by their antioxidant potentials, including SOD synthesis by sodA gene.",https://www.ncbi.nlm.nih.gov/pubmed/30826546,Ecotoxicology and environmental safety,2019 05 03,"Cadmium (Cd) is a toxic heavy metal and an abiotic stressor to plants; however, inoculation of endophytic bacteria can raise resistance in plants against Cd, as well as improve plant growth.

Both IU01 and IU02 were tolerant up to 9.0 mM of Cd in culture broth and successive increase in Cd concentration from 0 mM to 9.0 mM, led to an increase in the SOD enzyme activity of the isolates. Both strains were capable of indole-3-acetic acid (IAA) synthesis and phosphate solubilization, detected through gas spectrometry-mass chromatography (GC-MS) and Pikovskaya agar medium respectively. Brassica juncea plants stressed with 0-25 mg/kg Cd showed retardation in all growth attributes, however, inoculation of strain IU01 and IU02 significantly promoted the plant growth attributes as compared to control.

In the present study, we aimed to identify and compare the underlying mechanisms of toxicity of BPA, BPF, and BPS at the transcriptional level by conducting global transcriptome sequencing (RNA-Seq) on zebrafish embryos. RNA-seq results showed that the expression levels of 285, 191, and 246 genes were significantly changed in zebrafish larvae after embryos were treated for 120 h with 100 μg/L BPA, BPF, and BPS, respectively.

We further validated the expression levels of 19 differentially expressed genes by qRT-PCR, using sequencing RNA and the RNA samples after treatment by 0.01, 1, and 100 μg/L bisphenols under identical condition, the results were similar to RNA-Seq. Moreover, functional enrichment analysis indicated that metabolism was the main pathway which disrupted in zebrafish larvae by bisphenols treatment. Protein-protein interaction network analysis indicated that six DEGs (ces, cda, dpyd, upp1, upp2, and cmpk2) interact together in the drug metabolism of zebrafish. In summary, our study revealed changes in the transcription of genes upon bisphenols treatment in zebrafish larvae for the first time, indicating that BPF and BPS may cause adverse effects similar to BPA via their involvement in various biological processes, providing a solid foundation for further research on the toxicology of BPA analogs."

The AC field experiments were carried out at a fixed frequency of 100 kHz in the fluid regime for three number density ratios 1:3, 1:1 and 3:1 of big-to-small microgels using a confocal microscope. Strings with different types of co-assembly structures such as buckled, ring, flame and sandwich have been observed at low and intermediate field strengths at ratio 1:3, 1:1. In buckled and ring type, one or two small particles sit at the contact of two big particles and in the flame type, small particles arrange like a cone at end of the string. In the sandwich structure, several double small particle layers lie in between big particles. At high field strength, aggregation of strings and a phase separation into individual aggregates of strings from both big and small microgels have been observed. At higher ratio 3:1, the string formation is mostly dominated by big particles.

This strategy is used to prepare simple, low-cost, and environmentally friendly method to fabricate ultra-low density alveolar foam reinforced with carbon nanotubes (CNTs). This paper investigates the ability of cellulose nanocrystals (CNCs) to produce highly stable oil-in-water Pickering emulsions and to efficiently disperse carbon nanotubes in water to form three-dimensional macroporous conductive foam. It is shown that both single-walled carbon nanotubes (SWNTs) and multi-walled carbon nanotubes (MWNTs) are strongly linked to CNCs by non-covalent interactions, preserving the intrinsic properties of both nanoparticles. Homogeneous surfactant-free emulsions with a droplet diameter of 6 µm are produced. Once concentrated, they can form stable high internal phase emulsions. Incorporating CNTs into these CNC-based emulsions was shown to improve their rheological properties. Freeze-drying the concentrated emulsions produces ultra-low density solid foams (14 mg·cm-3) with several levels of porosity controlled by the emulsification step. Loading CNCs with only 2-4 wt% of CNTs, decreases the electrical resistivity of the foam to 104 Ω cm in high relative humidity.

Keratin is a group of natural proteins derived from skin and skin appendant, and features a rich content of cysteine residue which exists in the form of disulfide bonds. Inspired by this, in this work, a simple disulfide shuffling strategy was utilized to develop keratin hydrogels by converting the intramolecular disulfide bonds into the intermolecular disulfide bonds. To achieve this, the intramolecular disulfide bonds were first cleaved by the reductive reagent such as cysteine, to liberate free thiol group, which formed intermolecular disulfide bonds through thiol oxidation. It was demonstrated that control of the cysteine level led to a tunable disulfide crosslinking density, and thus an altered network structure, gel degradation, and drug release rate. Also, this strategy enables good biocompatibility of the material owing to avoiding extra chemical crosslinkers in the preparation procedure. Moreover, this keratin hydrogel had redox-responsive capacity in both gel degradation and drug release due to the disulfide-bond based network structure, providing extensive applicability in tissue engineering and drug release.",ZIF-67/PAN-800 bifunctional electrocatalyst derived from electrospun fibers for efficient oxygen reduction and oxygen evolution reaction.,https://www.ncbi.nlm.nih.gov/pubmed/30826529,Journal of colloid and interface science,2019 03 25,"Metal-organic frameworks (MOFs) derived materials have been used as promising eletrocatalysts. However, the aggregation and poor conductivity are still obstacles for those eletrocatalysts.

The obtained nanocomposite fibers showed that the isolated metal particles were anchored and linked up by carbon fibers, leading to elevated conductivity, preventing metal particles migration, and increasing stability. Such network structure provides facile pathways for efficient mass transport and shortens the electronic transmission path. As evidences, the oxygen reduction reaction (ORR) and oxygen evolution reaction (OER) catalytic tests in this study both showed that ZIF-67/PAN-800 had an excellent bifunctional electrocatalytic activity in alkaline electrolyte.

The Z-scheme CdS/Bi12GeO20 heterostructures show outstanding photocatalytic performance for degrading the various organic pollutants of the waste water, and for the reduction of aqueous Cr(VI) under visible light. For degradation of 2-Mercaptobenzothiazole (MBT), the Z-scheme 30CdS/Bi12GeO20 heterostructure exhibits the superior rate constant, which is about 22.67 and 4.6 times higher than that of the pure Bi12GeO20 and CdS, respectively. Meanwhile, as we expected, the Z-scheme 30CdS/Bi12GeO20 heterostructure also displays the enhanced photocatalytic performance for degradation of Levofloxacin (LEV), Ciprofloxacin (CIP), Tetracycline (TC) and reduction of aqueous Cr(VI). The enhancement of photocatalytic performance is attributed to the high redox capacity and the strong interfacial interaction between CdS and Bi12GeO20, which can effectively improve the separation of photo-induced electron-hole pairs. Additionally, the photocatalytic mechanism over the Z-scheme CdS/Bi12GeO20 heterostructure is provided.

These guidelines are based on the most up-to-date evidence. However, Chinese experts have a different national condition and policies to face. The Chinese Anti-Cancer Association Committee of Breast Cancer Society guideline (CBCS guideline) is to guide treatments and to reflect unmet needs of Chinese breast cancer patients. Although, most of the recommendations in the two guidelines are the same, some of them are different. In this article, with regard to country-specific peculiarities, a working group of Chinese breast cancer experts compare the similarities and differences between the ABC guideline and CBCS guideline and commented on the voting results of the ABC panelists. We also discuss why these differences exist, such as lack of access, different tumor biology and epidemiology, and even different culture. The money which patients have to pay out of pocket for their medical cost and the availability of drugs lie at the heart of the issues of guideline differences.",Acupoint Sensitization is Associated with Increased Excitability and Hyperpolarization-Activated Current (Ih) in C- But Not Aδ-Type Neurons.,https://www.ncbi.nlm.nih.gov/pubmed/30826524,Neuroscience,2019 06 03,"Under pathological conditions, acupoint sensitization is the phenomenon of acupoints transforming from the stable state to the dynamic state. Evidences suggest that hyperpolarization-activated current (Ih), conducted by the hyperpolarization-activated/cyclic nucleotide-gated (HCN) channel, greatly contributes to the peripheral and central sensitization. However, the role of the Ih current in acupoint sensitization has not been explained. In the present study, changes in excitability, Ih density and the HCN channel of dorsal root ganglion (DRG) nociceptive neurons were examined in the later phase of knee osteoarthritis (KOA) rats. To investigate the neuronal specificity of acupoint sensitization, retrograde dyes were injected into the acupoints ST35 and GB37. The results showed that acupoint sensitization occurred in bilateral ST35 but not GB37 acupoints. The excitability and Ih density of C- but not Aδ-type neurons innervating ST35 acupoint increased in bilateral L5 DRG of acupoint sensitized rats than that of sham rats. No obvious changes were found in the excitability or Ih density of C- and Aδ-type neurons innervating the GB37 acupoint in the bilateral L5 DRG. HCN channel subtype 2 (HCN2) expression levels significantly increased after acupoint sensitization. Furthermore, ZD7288, an HCN current (Ih) blocker, attenuated the acupoint sensitization of the ST35 acupoint. Taken together, our findings suggest that the increased excitability of C- but not Aδ-type neurons and the upregulation of Ih/HCN2 channels contribute to the formation of acupoint sensitization."

Hospital-acquired and community-acquired bacterial infections have already put a heavy burden on the global health system. Antibiotics which can disrupt the processes necessary for bacterial cell growth and proliferation are effective weapons to fight against bacterial infections. However, the overuse and misuse of antibiotics have led to a rise in antibiotic resistance, creating an urgent need to develop novel antibiotics. 1,2,3-Triazole hybrids possess a broad spectrum of chemotherapeutic properties, also demonstrated promising in vitro and in vivo anti-bacterial activities. This review covers the recent (2000-2019) advances of 1,2,3-triazole hybrids as potential anti-bacterial agents. The structure-activity relationship (SAR) is also discussed for further rational development of 1,2,3-triazole hybrids with higher potency against both drug-sensitive and drug-resistant pathogens.","Design, synthesis and biological evaluation of novel α-acyloxy carboxamides via Passerini reaction as caspase 3/7 activators.",https://www.ncbi.nlm.nih.gov/pubmed/30826510,European journal of medicinal chemistry,2019 04 22,"Evasion of apoptosis is a hallmark of cancer. Caspases; the key executors of apoptotic cascade are attractive targets for selective induction of apoptosis in cancer cells. Within this approach, various caspase activators were introduced as lead anticancer agents. In the current study, a new series of multifunctional Passerini products was synthesized and evaluated as potent caspase-dependent apoptotic inducers. The synthetic strategy adopted this isocyanide-based multicomponent reaction to possibly mimic the pharmacophoric features of various lead apoptotic inducers, where a series of α-acyloxy carboxamides was prepared from p-nitrophenyl isonitrile, cyclohexanone and various carboxylic acids. Accordingly, the main amide-based scaffold was decorated by substituents with varying nature and size to gain more information about structure-activity relationship. All the synthesized compounds were screened for cytotoxicity against normal human fibroblasts and their potential anticancer activities against three human cancer cell lines; MCF-7 (breast), NFS-60 (myeloid leukemia), and HepG-2 (liver) utilizing MTT assay. Among the most active compounds, 13, 21 and 22 were more potent and safer than doxorubicin with nanomolar IC50 values and promising selectivity indices. Mechanistically, 13, 21 and 22 induced apoptosis by significant caspase activation in all the screened cancer cell lines utilizing flow cytometric analysis and caspase 3/7 activation assay. Again, 13 and 21 recorded higher activation percentages than doxorubicin, while 22 showed comparable results. Apoptosis-inducing factor1 (AIF1) quantification assay declared that 13, 21 and 22 didn't mediate apoptosis through AIF1-dependent pathway (i.e. only by caspase activation). Physicochemical properties, pharmacokinetic profiles, ligand efficiency metrics and drug-likeness data of all the synthesized compounds were computationally predicted and showed that 13, 21 and 22 could be considered as drug-like candidates. Finally, selected compounds were preliminarily screened for possible antimicrobial activities searching for dual anticancer/antimicrobial agents as an advantageous approach for cancer therapy.",Inhibiting Aβ toxicity in Alzheimer's disease by a pyridine amine derivative.,https://www.ncbi.nlm.nih.gov/pubmed/30826509,European journal of medicinal chemistry,2019 04 22,"Alzheimer's disease (AD) is a neurodegenerative disorder with no radical therapy. Aggregation of amyloid β-peptide (Aβ) induced by various factors is associated with pathogenesis of AD. A pyridine amine derivative, 3-bis(pyridin-2-ylmethyl)aminomethyl-5-hydroxybenzyltriphenylphosphonium bromide (PAT), is synthesized. The inhibition of self- and metal-induced Aβ aggregation by PAT is confirmed by thioflavine T fluorescence, circular dichroism spectroscopy, and TEM. Western blot, RT-PCR and fluorescence imaging indicate that PAT can alleviate the Aβ-induced paralysis, reduce the production of ROS, and protect the mitochondrial function in transgenic C. elegans. Genetic analyses indicate that heat shock protein is involved in the alleviation of Aβ toxicity. PAT also inhibits the activity of acetylcholinesterase in C. elegans. Morris water maze test shows that the memory and cognitive ability of APP/PS1 AD model mice are significantly improved by PAT. Both in vitro and in vivo studies demonstrate that PAT is effective in counteracting Aβ toxicity and ameliorating cognitive functions in AD mice, and therefore a potential lead compound of anti-AD drugs.","Design, synthesis and docking study of novel picolinamide derivatives as anticancer agents and VEGFR-2 inhibitors.",https://www.ncbi.nlm.nih.gov/pubmed/30826508,European journal of medicinal chemistry,2019 04 22,"Two series of picolinamide derivatives bearing (thio)urea and dithiocarbamate moieties were designed and synthesized as VEGFR-2 kinase inhibitors.

Recent studies showed that the family can be divided into 14 tribes, with Glaucideae, Hydrastideae, and Coptideae being the successive basal-most lineages. The relationships among the remaining 11 tribes, however, remain controversial, so that a clear picture of character evolution within the family is still lacking. In this study, by sequencing, assembling and analyzing the chloroplast (cp) genomes of 35 species representing 31 genera of the 14 tribes, we resolved the relationships among the tribes and genera of the Ranunculaceae and clarified several long-standing controversies. We found that many of the characters that were once widely used for taxonomic and systematic considerations were actually results of parallel, convergent or even reversal evolution, suggestive of unreliability. We also found that the family has likely experienced two waves of radiative evolution, through which most of the extant tribes and genera were generated. Notably, both waves of radiation were correlated with the increase in the temperature of the earth, suggesting that global warming may have been the driving force of the radiation events. Based on these observations, we hypothesize that global warming and the associated decrease in the type and number of animal pollinators may have been the main reason why taxa with highly elaborate petals as well as those without petal were generated during each of the two waves of radiation.","LC-MS/MS method for simultaneous determination of linezolid, meropenem, piperacillin and teicoplanin in human plasma samples.",https://www.ncbi.nlm.nih.gov/pubmed/30826487,Journal of pharmaceutical and biomedical analysis,2019 04 05,"Antibiotic therapy is a crucial aspect of the management of hospitalized patients, however, current standard dosing protocols have been shown to often attain inadequate plasmatic concentrations which may impair the clinical outcome and promote the selection of multidrug-resistant bacteria.

Antibiotics were detected, following a 7 min gradient separation, in multiple reactions monitoring (MRM) mode using a Qtrap 5500 triple quadrupole instrument equipped with an electrospray source operating in positive ion mode. The method, covering the antibiotics' clinically relevant concentration ranges, is also able to quantify, individually, the major teicoplanin components. The high reproducibility and the need of a small amount of sample, associated with the use of a commercial kit, together with a short chromatographic time, makes the method particularly suited for high-throughput routine analysis. Monitoring of plasma antibiotic levels, as part of the clinical routine, would result in a quick therapy adjustment leading to a higher probability of eradicating the infection as well as a potential reduction of multidrug-resistance prevalence. The method was successfully applied to monitor the antibiotic concentration of 49 patients under therapy.",Integrating chemical similarity and bioequivalence: A pilot study on quality consistency evaluation of dispensing granule and traditional decoction of Scutellariae Radix by a totality-of-the-evidence approach.,https://www.ncbi.nlm.nih.gov/pubmed/30826486,Journal of pharmaceutical and biomedical analysis,2019 04 05,"There is an increasing focus on the quality consistency evaluation of dispensing granule in traditional Chinese medicines (TCMs). According to the guideline from Chinese Pharmacopoeia Commission, the substantial equivalence of dispensing granule and traditional decoction should be determined, and the chromatographic fingerprint has been recommended as a comprehensive qualitative approach to assess the quality consistency between dispensing granule and traditional decoction. However, a high-degree chemical similarity does not equal a bioequivalence. Attempting to realize the quality evaluation by integrating chemical consistency and bioequivalence, we herein proposed a totality-of-the-evidence approach based on clustering analysis and equivalence evaluation taking the dispensing granule and traditional decoction of Scutellariae Radix (SR) as a typical case. Chemical fingerprints were developed by high performance liquid chromatography coupled with photodiode array detector and quadrupole time-of-flight mass spectrometry (HPLC-PDA/QTOF-MS). Subsequently, a feature selection strategy, integrated linear and nonlinear correlation analysis, was carried out to assess the correlation between chemical profiles and biological activities. Finally, quality consistency between the dispensing granule and the traditional decoction was determined by bioactive marker-guided hierarchical clustering analysis (HCA), k-means clustering method and bioequivalence evaluation. The available evidence suggested that not all the dispensing granule of SR were sufficiently similar to the traditional decoction. This study provides an applicable methodology for quality consistency evaluation of dispensing granule and traditional decoction in TCMs.",Salmon calcitonin exerts better preventive effects than celecoxib on lumbar facet joint degeneration and long-term tactile allodynia in rats.,https://www.ncbi.nlm.nih.gov/pubmed/30826485,Bone,2019 06 16,"To evaluate and compare the effects of salmon calcitonin (sCT) and celecoxib (CLX) on cartilage, subchondral bone and tactile allodynia in a rat model of lumbar facet joint (FJ) osteoarthritis (OA).",Direct cost of illness for dengue in hospitalized children and adults at a referral hospital in India.,https://www.ncbi.nlm.nih.gov/pubmed/30826484,International journal of infectious diseases : IJID : official publication of the International Society for Infectious Diseases,2019 03 22,To describe the direct cost of illness in pediatric and adult inpatients at a referral hospital in India.,"Early death by tuberculosis as the underlying cause in a state of Southern Brazil: Profile, comorbidities and associated vulnerabilities.",https://www.ncbi.nlm.nih.gov/pubmed/30826483,International journal of infectious diseases : IJID : official publication of the International Society for Infectious Diseases,2019 04 22,"To know the profile of adults who died by tuberculosis as the main cause, the time interval between the diagnosis and death, associated comorbidities and vulnerabilities.",Building a European database to gather multi-country evidence on active and latent TB screening for migrants.,https://www.ncbi.nlm.nih.gov/pubmed/30826482,International journal of infectious diseases : IJID : official publication of the International Society for Infectious Diseases,2019 04 22,"Screening for active and latent TB among migrants in low TB incidence countries may constitute an important contribution to TB elimination.

Enzymatic mechanism by phospholipase A2 is responsible for acute kidney injury (AKI) in sea snake envenoming without any change in cardiac output and systemic vascular resistance. Cnidarian toxins form pores in the cell membrane with Ca influx storm resulting in cell death. Among plankton toxins domoic acid, palytoxin and maitotoxin cause renal injury by ion transport into the cell through ion channels resulting in renal cell swelling and lysis. Okadaic acid, calyculin A, microcystin LR and nodularin cause AKI by serine threonine phosphatase inhibition and hyperphosphorylation with increased activity of Ca2+/calmodulin - dependent protein kinase II, increased cytosolic Ca2+, reactive oxygen species, caspase and P53. Renal injury by plankons is mostly subclinical and requires sensitive biomarker for diagnosis. In this respect repeated consumption of plankton toxin contaminated seafood is a risk of developing chronic renal disease.

This study concentrated on DON-induced oxidative damage and the accompanying nuclear factor erythroid 2-related factor 2 (Nrf2) translocation during DON-induced maternal hepatotoxicity. The 0, 1.0 and 2.5 mg/kg/day of DON were used as doses for the experiment during gestation days. DON slightly increased the levels of ALT and AST in GD12.5 d instead of GD18.5 d. Oxidative stress and anti-oxidization system were both found to be activated in the experiment which marked by ROS, MDA and GSH increasing, especially on GD12.5 d. The levels of HO-1 were significantly increased by DON exposure at different two time points. Moreover, Nrf2 translocation appeared both in GD 12.5 d and GD 18.5 d. In conclusion, DON-induced ROS accumulation may cause maternal liver damage in the initial stages, but the related stimulation of Nrf2/HO-1 pathway improves the removal of ROS and decreases the level of oxidative stress thereby protecting the liver damage. Therefore, upregulating the Nrf2-dependent response is one of the potential methods that protects maternal liver from DON-induced oxidative damage.",The effect of content and tone of maternal evaluative feedback on self-cognitions and affect in young children.,https://www.ncbi.nlm.nih.gov/pubmed/30826468,Journal of experimental child psychology,2019 03 29,"Feedback that young children receive from others can affect their emotions and emerging self-views. The current experiment tested the effect of negative content (criticism) and negative tone (hostile) of the feedback on children's affect, self-evaluations, and attributions. We also explored whether maternal history of depression and children's temperament moderated these relations. Participants were 152 mothers and children (48% girls) aged 4 and 5 years (M = 61.6 months, SD = 6.83). The task involved three scenarios enacted by dolls; a child doll made something (e.g., picture, house, numbers) that had a mistake (e.g., no windows on the house) and proudly showed it to the mother doll, who then gave feedback (standardized, audio recorded) to the child. Children were randomized to one of four maternal feedback conditions: negative or neutral content in either a negative or neutral tone. Negative content (criticism) produced significantly more negative affect and lower self-evaluations than neutral content. When the tone of the feedback was hostile, children of mothers who had been depressed during the children's lifetimes were significantly more likely to make internal attributions for mistakes than children of nondepressed mothers. In addition, among children with low temperamental negative affectivity, in the presence of negative tone, negative content significantly predicted more internal attributions for the errors. Findings are discussed in terms of understanding the role of evaluative feedback in children's emerging social cognitions and affect.",Reduced biliverdin reductase-A levels are associated with early alterations of insulin signaling in obesity.,https://www.ncbi.nlm.nih.gov/pubmed/30826467,Biochimica et biophysica acta. Molecular basis of disease,2019 05 06,"Biliverdin reductase-A (BVR-A) is a serine/threonine/tyrosine kinase involved in the regulation of insulin signaling. In vitro studies have demonstrated that BVR-A is a substrate of the insulin receptor and regulates IRS1 by avoiding its aberrant activation, and in animal model of obesity the loss of hepatic BVR-A has been associated with glucose/insulin alterations and fatty liver disease. However, no studies exist in humans. Here, we evaluated BVR-A expression levels and activation in peripheral blood mononuclear cells (PBMC) from obese subjects and matched lean controls and we investigated the related molecular alterations of the insulin along with clinical correlates. We showed that BVR-A levels are significantly reduced in obese subjects and associated with a hyper-activation of the IR/IRS1/Akt/GSK-3β/AS160/GLUT4 pathway. Low BVR-A levels also associate with the presence of obesity, metabolic syndrome, NASH and visceral adipose tissue inflammation. These data suggest that the reduction of BVR-A may be responsible for early alterations of the insulin signaling pathway in obesity and in this context may represent a novel molecular target to be investigated for the comprehension of the process of insulin resistance development in obesity.",Inflammation-dependent ISG15 upregulation mediates MIA-induced dendrite damages and depression by disrupting NEDD4/Rap2A signaling.,https://www.ncbi.nlm.nih.gov/pubmed/30826466,Biochimica et biophysica acta.

In this phase I/II trial, we assessed the safety and activity of bortezomib added to the rituximab (R) plus BEAM (carmustine, etoposide, cytarabine, melphalan) regimen in patients with relapsed lymphoma undergoing alloSCT. Primary GVHD prophylaxis consisted of tacrolimus and methotrexate. Bortezomib (1 to 1.3 mg/m2 per dose) was administered i.v. on days -13, -6, -1, and +2. We performed inverse probability weighting analysis to compare GVHD and survival results with an historical control group that received R-BEAM without bortezomib. Thirty-nine patients were assessable for toxic effects and response. The median age was 54years. The most common diagnosis was diffuse large B cell lymphoma (41%). Twenty-two patients (56%) and 17 patients (44%) received their transplants from matched related and matched unrelated donors, respectively. The maximum tolerated bortezomib dose was 1 mg/m2. The weighted cumulative incidences of grades II to IV and III or IV acute GVHD were 50% and 34%, respectively; these incidences and survival rates were not significantly different from those of the control group. Median survival was not reached in patients age ≤ 50years and with a long follow-up time of 60.7 months. The R-BEAM regimen has a survival benefit in lymphoma patients age ≤ 50years undergoing alloSCT.

We conducted this retrospective study using the Japanese national registry data for 224 PMF patients to compare the outcomes of first allogeneic HSCT from HLA-matched related donor bone marrow (Rtd-BM), HLA-matched related donor peripheral blood stem cells (Rtd-PB), HLA-matched unrelated donor bone marrow (UR-BM), unrelated umbilical cord blood (UR-UCB), and other hematopoietic stem cell grafts. Nonrelapse mortality (NRM) rates at 1 year after Rtd-BM, Rtd-PB, UR-BM, UR-UCB, and other transplantations were 16%, 36%, 30%, 41%, and 48%, respectively. Multivariate analysis identified UR-UCB transplantation, other transplantation, frequent RBC transfusion before transplantation, and frequent platelet (PLT) transfusion before transplantation as predictive of higher NRM. Relapse rates at 1 year after Rtd-BM, Rtd-PB, UR-BM, UR-UCB, and other transplantation were 14%, 17%, 11%, 14%, and 15%, respectively. No specific factor was associated with the incidence of relapse. Overall survival (OS) at 1 and 4years after Rtd-BM, Rtd-PB, UR-BM, UR-UCB, and other transplantation were 81% and 71%, 58% and 52%, 61% and 46%, 48% and 27%, and 48% and 41%, respectively. Multivariate analysis identified older patient age, frequent RBC transfusion before transplantation, and frequent PLT transfusion before transplantation as predictive of lower OS. In conclusion, UR-UCB transplantation, as well as UR-BM transplantation, can be selected for PMF patients without an HLA-identical related donor. However, careful management is required for patients after UR-UCB transplantation because of the high NRM. Further studies including more patients after HLA-haploidentical related donor and HLA-mismatched unrelated donor transplantation would provide more valuable information for patients with PMF when making decisions regarding the choice of alternative donor.","Donor-Specific Anti-HLA Antibodies in Haploidentical Stem Cell Transplantation with Post-Transplantation Cyclophosphamide: Risk of Graft Failure, Poor Graft Function, and Impact on Outcomes.",https://www.ncbi.nlm.nih.gov/pubmed/30826463,Biology of blood and marrow transplantation : journal of the American Society for Blood and Marrow Transplantation,2019 04 29,"The presence of donor-specific anti-HLA antibodies (DSA) is associated with a 10-fold increased risk of graft failure in haploidentical stem cell transplantation (haplo-SCT). Consensus guidelines from the European Society for Blood and Marrow Transplantation set a mean fluorescence intensity (MFI) >1000 as a cutoff for DSA positivity. In the absence of an alternative donor, it is recommended that patients undergo desensitization therapy, especially with high DSA levels (>5000 MFI). The aim of this study was to analyze the impact of DSA on risk of graft failure and poor graft function, as well as on major outcomes in a consecutive cohort of patients who were systematically screened for DSA before haplo-SCT. A total of 141 consecutive patients were candidates for unmanipulated haplo-SCT with post-transplantation cyclophosphamide (PT-Cy) at our center between January 2012 and January 2018, and 135 were analyzed for the presence of HLA antibodies. Of these 134 patients underwent haplo-SCT. HLA antibodies were detected in 40 patients, including 19 with DSA and 21 without DSA. Ten of the 19 patients with DSA underwent transplantation using that donor, whereas 2 underwent a desensitization program before transplantation. Only 2 patients experienced primary graft failure (1.4 %), both of whom were without DSA. Twenty patients developed a poor graft function (15%). The 3-year overall survival (OS), 3-year progression-free survival (PFS), and 1-year nonrelapse mortality (NRM) were analyzed according to the presence or absence of DSA. No statistically significant difference was found. No impact of the presence of DSA on the risk of developing graft failure and poor graft function was revealed. Major outcomes of transplantation were analyzed separately in patients with poor graft function and those with good graft function. The 3-year OS, 3-year PFS, and 1-year NRM in good graft function and poor graft function populations were 62% versus 20% (P < .0001), 53% versus 20% (P < .0001), and 12% versus 40% (P = .009), respectively. The presence of low-level DSA in the absence of desensitization did not correlate with the risk of developing graft failure and poor graft function. Patients who experienced poor graft function had worse outcomes than patients with good graft function.",Nutritional and Post-Transplantation Outcomes of Enteral versus Parenteral Nutrition in Pediatric Hematopoietic Stem Cell Transplantation: A Systematic Review of Randomized and Nonrandomized Studies.,https://www.ncbi.nlm.nih.gov/pubmed/30826462,Biology of blood and marrow transplantation : journal of the American Society for Blood and Marrow Transplantation,2019 04 09,"Hematopoietic stem cell transplantation (HSCT) involves the administration of chemotherapy followed by the infusion of donor stem cells. After treatment, children can consequently experience nausea, vomiting, diarrhea, anorexia, and mucositis, which negatively impact oral intake, leading to rapid deterioration in nutritional status and risk of malnutrition. Nutrition support therefore becomes necessary to circumvent these adverse effects. This has traditionally been provided via parenteral nutrition (PN), but pediatric evidence is increasingly advocating enteral nutrition (EN) as a preferential alternative. The objective of this review is to determine the efficacy of any forms of EN versus PN provided during admission to children aged ≤ 18 years undergoing HSCT. Primary outcomes considered efficacy in relation to various nutritional parameters, and secondary outcomes included a range of post-transplantation parameters. Data sources included English and non-English articles from the start date of MEDLINE, EMBASE, AMED, CINAHL and Cochrane Controlled Trials register, up to July 2018. Key journals were also hand searched, reference lists scanned, clinical experts contacted, and gray literature searched using EThOS and Open Grey. Randomized and observational studies comparing any forms of EN versus PN in children aged ≤ 18 years undergoing HSCT investigating nutritional or post-transplantation outcomes were eligible. Data were extracted from included studies using a custom extraction form that had previously been piloted. Because included studies were observational, risk of bias was assessed using Risk of Bias in Non-randomised Studies of Interventions. Because only a small number of heterogenous studies reporting a wide range of differently defined outcomes were included, meta-analyses were not performed and data were presented in narrative form. Conflicting results in favor of either method of nutrition support or no difference between methods were seen for duration of interventions, nutritional intakes, biochemical and anthropometric changes, mortality, infections, length of admission, and neutrophil engraftment. EN may provide favorable benefits over PN regarding acute graft-versus-host-disease (aGVHD) and platelet engraftment. A paucity of studies was found investigating the question posed by this review. Included studies were clinically heterogenous regarding populations, interventions, and outcomes, at moderate to serious risk of bias due to the absence of randomization, confounding parameters, statistical control, retrospective designs, and participant selection. Some studies were more than 15 years old. Despite the limited number and poor quality of identified studies, results support the growing body of pediatric evidence that EN is feasible during HSCT. Similar differences regarding many nutritional and post-transplantation outcomes were seen in both forms of nutrition support, but EN could provide benefits above PN including reduced incidence of aGVHD and faster platelet engraftment.",Pharmacokinetics and toxicity of high-dose baclofen in ICU patients.,https://www.ncbi.nlm.nih.gov/pubmed/30826461,Progress in neuro-psychopharmacology & biological psychiatry,2019 05 07,"High-dose baclofen could prove beneficial in patients with unhealthy alcohol use in intensive care units (ICU).

Fungal pathogens that contribute to human disease reside both within the host as commensal organisms of the microbiota and the environment. Their niche of origin dictates how infection initiates but also places specific selective pressures on the fungal pathogen that contributes to its genome organization and genetic repertoire. Recent efforts to catalogue genomic variation among major human fungal pathogens have unveiled evolutionary themes that shape the fungal genome. Mechanisms ranging from large scale changes such as aneuploidy and ploidy cycling as well as more targeted mutations like base substitutions and gene copy number variations contribute to the evolution of these species, which are often under multiple competing selective pressures with their host, environment, and other microbes.

Multiepitopic vaccines allow a rational design rendering vaccines able to induce proper immune responses in terms of polarization and potency. In addition, the pathogen variants can be easily covered by including epitopes conserved among relevant isolates. Other important aspects to consider in vaccination are the costs associated to production, distribution, and administration of the vaccine. Plants provide an advantageous platform for this purpose, since they yield biomass at very low costs and some species can be used to formulate purification-free oral vaccines. In the present study, a multiepitopic protein called Zerola, which carries epitopes from the EBOV glycoprotein (GP), was designed based on immunoinformatic approaches and current experimental evidence on B cell protective GP epitopes. Moreover, expression studies performed in nuclear-transformed tobacco lines confirmed the capacity of the plant cell to synthetize the Zerola antigenic protein. The generation of this plant-based candidate vaccine is a step forward in the development of highly efficient and low cost EBOV vaccines.",Dietary therapy for clostridium difficile colonization: A case series.,https://www.ncbi.nlm.nih.gov/pubmed/30826445,Anaerobe,2019 06 02,"Clostridium difficile (C. difficile) is an important nosocomial pathogen in adults and children.

When the NFAs or genotypes of only 27 SNP/InDel-containing grain yield genes were used, a prediction accuracy of r = 0.52 or 0.49 was obtained. When the expressions of grain yield gene transcripts were used, a plateaued prediction accuracy of r = 0.84 was achieved. When the phenotypes predicted with two or three of the genic datasets were used for progeny selection, the selected lines were completely consistent with those selected by phenotypic selection.

To examine this heterogeneity at transcriptomic level, we performed whole-genome mRNA expression profiling in whole blood samples from 34 patients with epilepsy (PWE) (idiopathic, n = 13; cryptogenic, n = 9; and symptomatic, n = 12) and 41 healthy controls (HC) using Illumina HT-12 Expression Beadchip v4 microarray. In silico analysis using R software identified 165 genes to be significantly differentially expressed in PWE compared to HC (fold change>1.3, p < 0.05). Hierarchical clustering of resultant DEGs segregated idiopathic epilepsy from the rest of the epilepsy classes as well as HC. The class also displayed the most differential expression pattern with the highest number of DEGs among the three epilepsy classes.

Although the AQPs identified in multiple plant species, there is no detailed evolutionary and comparative study of AQPs regarding chickpea plant. The current study involved evolutionary analyses coupled with promoter and expression analyses of chickpea AQPs (CaAQPs). A total of 924 non-redundant AQPs were studied in 24 plant species including algae, mosses, lycophytes, monocots and dicots. Phylogenetic analysis demonstrated a clear divergence of eight AQP subfamilies (LIPs, SIPs, GIPs, NIPs, XIPs, PIPs, HIPs and TIPs). The comparative phylogenetic trees of AQP subfamilies among Arabidopsis, soybean, common bean, maize and chickpea demonstrated that the AQPs were highly species-specific. Interestingly, the dual NPA motif was conserved in all species. However, the ar/R selectivity filter signatures [W/T/S/N/G/A]-[V/S/L/I/A]-[S/G/A]-R (in NIPs), F-H-T-R (in PIPs), [H/N/Q/S]-[A/I/L/S/V]-[A/G]-[A/C/L/M/R/V] (in TIPs) and [V/I/L/M]-[V/I/A/F/M]-[A/S/F/C]-[N/F/L/I/A/S (in SIPs) were found in five species. Moreover, the Froger's positions (P1-P5) were found as [F/L/Y]-[S/T]-A-Y-[L/I/M/V/F] (in NIPs), [Q/E/M]-S-A-F-W (in PIPs), [A/L/S/T/V]-[A/C/N/S/T/V]-[P/R/S]-[Y/N/F]-[W/Q] (in TIPs) and [I/M/F]-[A/V]-[A/V]-Y-W (in SIPs). The MEME motif analyses showed that most of the motifs were specific to subfamily and subgroups. Tissue-specific expression profiling of CaAQPs revealed that CaTIPs and CaPIPs are highly expressed in most of the tissues, while CaNIPs and CaSIPs have low expression. In promoter analysis of CaAQPs, multiple stress-related cis-acting elements e.g. MYB, MYC, ABRE, etc. were found.

The presence of prebiotics provides various health benefits such as improveing calcium and magnesium absorption, increases bone density, reduces cancer risk, decreases cardiovascular diseases and also improves the immune system.",Robust biofilm assay for quantification and high throughput screening applications.,https://www.ncbi.nlm.nih.gov/pubmed/30826440,Journal of microbiological methods,2019 04 06,"Bacterial biofilms are populations of bacteria within a self-produced adherent extracellular matrix that are notoriously resistant to treatment. Existing methods for biofilm quantification are often limited in their dynamic range of detection (signal-to-background), throughput, and require modifications to the protocol depending on the bacterial species. To address these limitations, a broad utility, high-throughput (HTP) method was required. Using a fluorescent dye, FM1-43, we stained the biofilm, followed by solvent extraction and quantitation of biofilm employing a fluorescent plate reader. Utilizing eight different bacterial pathogens, we demonstrate that this method is widely applicable for biofilm quantification. Depending on the species, this biofilm assay offered a large dynamic range of 8-146 fold change compared to 2-22 fold for crystal violet staining under similar conditions. In addition to routine biofilm quantification using this new assay, as a proof-of-concept, 1200 compounds were screened against two different bacterial species to identify biofilm inhibitors. In our HTP screens we successfully identified compounds rifabutin and ethavarine as potential biofilm inhibitors of Burkholderia pseudomallei Bp82 and Acinetobacter baumannii biofilm production respectively. This newly validated biofilm assay is robust and can be readily adapted for antibiofilm screening campaigns and can supplant other less sensitive and low throughput methods.",Staphylococcus aureus and methicillin resistance detection directly from pediatric samples using PCR assays with differential cycle threshold values for corroboration of methicillin resistance.,https://www.ncbi.nlm.nih.gov/pubmed/30826439,Journal of microbiological methods,2019 04 06,"Staphylococcus aureus is a major human pathogen, causing a variety of nosocomial and community-acquired infections. While S. aureus usually grows well, there are situations where it cannot be isolated in culture, such as patients who have received prior antimicrobial therapy. There are commercially available tests for molecular identification of S. aureus and methicillin resistance; however, they often have limited utility due to restrictive specimen requirements, lack of data in pediatric populations and issues with specificity for methicillin resistance detections. Our objective was to evaluate the performance of laboratory-developed PCR assays that detect S. aureus and methicillin resistance directly from various specimen types. We developed two real-time PCR assays: 1) a singleplex assay targeting the nucA gene and 2) a multiplex PCR assay (mecA/SCC-orf PCRs) that detects the mecA gene and the conjunction region where SCCmec elements insert into the genome. A total of 538 pediatric specimens, including specimens from the lower respiratory tract (n = 149), abscess/wounds (n = 245), tissue and body fluids (n = 144), were tested and the results compared with culture and susceptibility testing. The nucA PCR is sensitive and specific for detection of S. aureus when compared with culture with an overall agreement of 93.1% and sensitivity and specificity of 93.5% and 93.0%, respectively. Among those culture-confirmed and nucA PCR positive specimens (n = 145), concordance between mecA/SCC-orf PCRs, using cycle threshold values for corroboration, and conventional methods was 98.6% and the sensitivity and specificity were 97.3% and 100%, respectively. The assays' performance suggests they are rapid, reliable tools to detect and differentiate between methicillin susceptible and methicillin resistant S. aureus in our pediatric patient population providing diagnostic impact when used in conjunction with culture."

Cell viability and apoptosis were evaluated by MTT and flow cytometry. The levels of apoptosis-related proteins Bcl-2, Bax, Caspase-3 were detected by WB analysis. The releases of inflammatory cytokines IL-1β and TNF-α were examined by ELISA assay. ROS generation, LDH and SOD activity were evaluated using commercially available kits.

Therefore, we aimed to establish the sensorial processing of simple auditory stimulations in naïve PD comparing to healthy controls (HC) via delta, theta, and alpha brain oscillatory responses. 12 naïve PD and 12 HC participated to the study. Brain responses recorded via the 64-channel electroencephalography (EEG) system in an electromagnetically and acoustically isolated room. The auditory stimuli (1500 Hz, 60 dB SPL, 500 ms) were delivered to the subjects via a headphone. The inter-stimulus interval was ranged between 2.5-4.5 s. The peak-to-peak maximum amplitudes were measured in the delta, theta and alpha frequency bands on 11 electrodes (including the frontal, central and parietal areas) for the statistical analysis in which one-way ANOVA test was employed for the comparisons between PD and HC. For the delta oscillatory responses, PD group has bigger amplitudes in frontal, central and parietal areas in comparison with HC. For the theta and alpha oscillatory responses, PD group has bigger amplitudes in parietal areas in comparison with HC. As a result, amplitudes of brain oscillatory responses in PD group were significantly bigger than the HC. In this context, decreased inhibitory mechanisms of cortical auditory processing due to the dysfunction of the dopaminergic activity may lead the increased evoked responses in PD group.",Older and young adults adopt different postural strategies during quiet bipedal stance after ankle plantarflexor fatigue.,https://www.ncbi.nlm.nih.gov/pubmed/30826417,Neuroscience letters,2019 05 30,"The individual effects of fatigue and age on postural control have been extensively studied.

Previous studies have demonstrated alterations in the salience network (SN) in patients with post traumatic distress disorder and that hyperactivity of the SN is associated with AVHs in patients with psychosis. Patients with post traumatic distress disorder may benefit from aripiprazole; however, studies investigating the effect of aripiprazole on AVHs and activity in the SN in patients with post traumatic distress disorder are scarce. Therefore, we conducted an outcomes analysis using functional magnetic resonance imaging to explore the effects of add-on aripiprazole treatment on AVHs and brain functional connectivity in patients with post traumatic distress disorder. AVHs were alleviated by add-on aripiprazole treatment (Auditory Hallucination Rating Scale [AHRS] score reduced by ≥ 50%) in 22.7% of patients. Functional activity in the SN was obviously decreased in patients in whom AHRS scores were reduced ≥ 50% following add-on aripiprazole treatment compared to patients in whom AHRS scores were reduced by <50%. The decrease in functional connectivity within the SN was significantly correlated with the reduction in total AHRS scores. Although this study was associated with several limitations, the findings suggest that add-on aripiprazole treatment can alleviate AVHs in patients with post traumatic distress disorder by reducing activity in the SN.",Directed differentiation of granular cells from crayfish hematopoietic tissue cells.,https://www.ncbi.nlm.nih.gov/pubmed/30826415,Fish & shellfish immunology,2019 04 02,"Hemocytes are the major immune cells of crustaceans. New hemocyte production is required throughout the life cycle of these animals to maintain a functional immune system. The mechanism of crustacean hematopoiesis has just begun to be understood and new methods are needed for the investigation of this process. Here we report the directed differentiation of granular cells (GCs) from the hematopoietic tissue (HPT) cells of Cherax quadricarinatus in vitro. We started by providing the cultured HPT cells with different additives to induce possible differentiation. We found that crayfish muscle extract greatly promoted the physical status of the cells and induced the formation of refractile cytoplasmic granules. The transcription of marker genes and the production of functional prophenoloxidase further confirmed the formation of mature GCs. In our experiments, young GCs usually started to develop in ∼2 weeks post induction and over 60% of the cells became mature within 3-4 weeks. This is the first time that the fully differentiation of crustacean hemocytes is accomplished in vitro. It provides a powerful tool for in-depth study of crustacean hematopoiesis.",Dietary Radix Bupleuri extracts improves hepatic lipid accumulation and immune response of hybrid grouper (Epinephelus lanceolatus♂ × Epinephelus fuscoguttatus♀).,https://www.ncbi.nlm.nih.gov/pubmed/30826414,Fish & shellfish immunology,2019 04 02,"In this study, two experiments were performed to explore the effect of Radix Bupleuri extracts (RBE) on growth, lipid deposition and metabolism and immune response of hybrid grouper (Epinephelus lanceolatus♂ × Epinephelus fuscoguttatus♀) using in vitro and in vivo models. In vitro, we used 2 ml/L 20% lipid emulsion (LE)-induced steatosis in hybrid grouper primary hepatocytes, then RBE (200, 400 and 800 μg/ml) was added to the hepatocytes after (post-treatment) the incubation with 20% LE (2 ml/L) in the culture medium. We found that RBE markedly increased cell viability, which were consistent with hepatocytes morphological structure examination and lipid metabolism and immune related genes study. The above result suggested that RBE has a protective effect on this model of hepatocytes damage. In vivo, five graded levels of RBE at 0, 200, 400, 800 and 1600 mg/kg diet were supplemented to a basal diet with 15% lipid levels (high lipid), and fed to a total of 300 hybrid grouper with an average initial weight of 25.58 ± 0.05 g for 8 weeks. Growth performance, liver histology, plasma biochemical parameters, and expression of genes involved in lipid metabolism and immune-related were measured. The study indicated that dietary RBE significantly improved growth performance and feed utilization and reduced hepatosomatic index. Dietary supplementation with 200-800 mg/kg RBE diets effectively decreased serum ALP, ALT, AST and LDH contents in fish. Furthermore, adipogenesis relative mRNA levels of DGAT2, G6PD, ME1 and DGKα in fish fed 200-400 mg/kg RBE diets were lower (P < 0.05) than in those fed RBE0 diets, while dietary supplementation with 200-800 mg/kg RBE diets up-regulated lipolysis-related genes (CPT1, LPL and PPARα) expression in the liver of hybrid grouper. Moreover, dietary RBE down-regulated the expression of apoptosis-related genes (caspase-9), up-regulated the expression of antioxidant genes (CAT) and immune-related genes (MHC2, IKKα and TGF-β1). Thus, our data suggest that RBE suppressed lipid accumulation and enhanced immune capability in hybrid grouper both in vitro and in vivo. These results offer new insight into RBE as a hepatoprotective in fish."

To expand the potato starch utility with appropriate processing characteristics, potato starch granules were modified with branching enzyme (BE) and transglucosidase (TG). The results indicated that the susceptibility of potato starch granules to TG was higher than BE. Moreover, the two enzymes showed the synergistic effect in enzymatic modification of potato starch granules. They cooperatively attacked the external and interior of potato starch granules. The crystal forms of potato starch changed from B to C-type after double enzyme treatments, and enzyme-treated starches exhibited homogeneous crystal distribution. Compared to BE or TG alone, the combined action of BE and TG increased significantly the ratio of α-1,6-glycosidic linkage and the amounts of short chains of potato starch, which led to the significant reduction in degree of crystallinity, viscosity, gelatinization temperature and enthalpy, and a remarkable increase in solubility. Especially, the physicochemical characteristics of modified starch largely depended on the treatment time of TG. Thus, through the combination of BE and TG, the appropriate treatment time of TG may be chosen to improve the physicochemical properties of potato starch in processed starch-based products.",Cellulose nanocrystal driven microphase separated nanocomposites: Enhanced mechanical performance and nanostructured morphology.,https://www.ncbi.nlm.nih.gov/pubmed/30826401,International journal of biological macromolecules,2019 04 17,"The interest in the modification of cellulose nanocrystals (CNCs) lies in the potential to homogenously disperse CNCs in hydrophobic polymer matrices and to promote interfacial adhesion. In this work, poly(methyl methacrylate) (PMMA) and poly(butyl acrylate) (PBA) were grafted onto CNCs, thereby imparting their hydrophobic traits. The successful grafting modification led to the increased thermal stability of modified CNCs (MCNCs), and the hydrophobic surface modification was integrated with crystalline structure and morphology of CNCs. The nanocomposites with 7 wt% MCNCs/PBA-co-PMMA had an increase in Young's modulus of >25-fold and in tensile strength at about 3 times compared to these of neat PBA-co-PMMA copolymer. In addition, a micro-phase separated morphology (PBA soft domains, and PMMA and CNC hard domains) of MCNCs/PBA-co-PMMA nanocomposites was observed. The large increase in the storage moduli (glass transition temperatures) and organized morphology of MCNCs/PBA-co-PMMA nanocomposites also elucidated the relationship between mechanical properties and micro-phase separated morphology. Therefore, the MCNCs are effective reinforcing agents for the PBA-co-PMMA thermoplastic elastomers, opening up opportunities for their wide-spread applications in polymer composites.",Myosin heavy chain mutations that cause Freeman-Sheldon syndrome lead to muscle structural and functional defects in Drosophila.,https://www.ncbi.nlm.nih.gov/pubmed/30826400,Developmental biology,2019 04 09,"Missense mutations in the MYH3 gene encoding myosin heavy chain-embryonic (MyHC-embryonic) have been reported to cause two skeletal muscle contracture syndromes, Freeman Sheldon Syndrome (FSS) and Sheldon Hall Syndrome (SHS). Two residues in MyHC-embryonic that are most frequently mutated, leading to FSS, R672 and T178, are evolutionarily conserved across myosin heavy chains in vertebrates and Drosophila. We generated transgenic Drosophila expressing myosin heavy chain (Mhc) transgenes with the FSS mutations and characterized the effect of their expression on Drosophila muscle structure and function. Our results indicate that expressing these mutant Mhc transgenes lead to structural abnormalities in the muscle, which increase in severity with age and muscle use. We find that flies expressing the FSS mutant Mhc transgenes in the muscle exhibit shortening of the inter-Z disc distance of sarcomeres, reduction in the Z-disc width, aberrant deposition of Z-disc proteins, and muscle fiber splitting. The ATPase activity of the three FSS mutant MHC proteins are reduced compared to wild type MHC, with the most severe reduction observed in the T178I mutation. Structurally, the FSS mutations occur close to the ATP binding pocket, disrupting the ATPase activity of the protein. Functionally, expression of the FSS mutant Mhc transgenes in muscle lead to significantly reduced climbing capability in adult flies. Thus, our findings indicate that the FSS contracture syndrome mutations lead to muscle structural defects and functional deficits in Drosophila, possibly mediated by the reduced ATPase activity of the mutant MHC proteins.",Human neural crest induction by temporal modulation of WNT activation.,https://www.ncbi.nlm.nih.gov/pubmed/30826399,Developmental biology,2019 04 09,"The developmental biology of neural crest cells in humans remains unexplored due to technical and ethical challenges. The use of pluripotent stem cells to model human neural crest development has gained momentum. We recently introduced a rapid chemically defined approach to induce robust neural crest by WNT/β-CATENIN activation. Here we investigate the temporal requirements of ectopic WNT activation needed to induce neural crest cells. By altering the temporal activation of canonical WNT/β-CATENIN with a GSK3 inhibitor we find that a 2 Day pulse of WNT/β-CATENIN activation via GSK3 inhibition is optimal to generate bona fide neural crest cells, as shown by their capacity to differentiate to neural crest specific fates including peripheral neurons, glia, melanoblasts and ectomesenchymal osteocytes, chondrocytes and adipocytes. Although a 2 Day pulse can impart neural crest character when GSK3 is inhibited days after seeding, optimal results are obtained when WNT is activated from the beginning, and we find that the window of competence to induce NCs from non-neural ectodermal/placodal precursors closes by day 3 of culture. The reduced requirement for exogenous WNT activation offers an approach that is cost-effective, and we show that this adherent 2-dimensional approach is efficient in a broad range of culture platforms ranging from 96-well vessels to 10 cm dishes.",Nerve-mediated expression of histone deacetylases regulates limb regeneration in axolotls.,https://www.ncbi.nlm.nih.gov/pubmed/30826398,Developmental biology,2019 04 09,"Axolotls have amazing abilities to regenerate their lost limbs. Nerve and wound epidermis have great impacts on this regeneration. Histone deacetylases (HDACs) have been shown to play roles in the regeneration of amphibian tails and limbs. In this study, a bi-phasic up-regulation of HDAC1 was noted before early differentiation stage of axolotl limb regeneration. Limb regeneration was delayed in larvae incubated with an HDAC inhibitor MS-275. Local injection of MS-275 or TSA, another HDAC inhibitor, into amputation sites of the juveniles did not interfere with wound healing but more profoundly inhibited local HDAC activities and blastema formation/limb regeneration. Elevation of HDAC1 expression was more apparent in wound epidermis than in mesenchyme. Prior denervation prohibited this elevation and limb regeneration. Supplementation of nerve factors BMP7, FGF2, and FGF8 in the stump ends after amputation on denervated limbs not only enabled HDAC1 up-regulation but also led to more extent of limb regeneration. In conclusion, nerve-mediated HDAC1 expression is required for blastema formation and limb regeneration.",Antithrombotic treatment in atrial fibrillation patients undergoing PCI: Is dual therapy the winner?,https://www.ncbi.nlm.nih.gov/pubmed/30826397,Thrombosis research,2019 03 29,"Approximately 7% of patients undergoing percutaneous coronary intervention (PCI) with stent implantation have atrial fibrillation. The optimal antithrombotic treatment in such of patients remains one of the most challenging and difficult scenarios in Cardiology. Triple antithrombotic therapy (TAT), consisting of dual antiplatelet therapy plus an oral anticoagulant, has been used for decades in order to reduce ischemic and thromboembolic events, while significantly increasing the risk for severe bleeding. Recently, results of several clinical trials suggest that the use of dual antithrombotic therapy (DAT), consisting of single antiplatelet therapy plus an oral anticoagulant, reduces the risk of bleeding, while maintaining the same level of efficacy as compared to TAT. These data have been interpreted in a variety of ways, often giving conflicting recommendations and leaving many unanswered questions on the optimal antithrombotic treatments of patients with atrial fibrillation who undergo PCI. DAT consisting of a non-vitamin K antagonist oral anticoagulant and clopidogrel, while omitting aspirin from the immediate post discharge period, appears as an attractive, simplified strategy for most patients and supported by many experts in the field. In this review we aim to better define the role of DAT versus TAT in atrial fibrillation patients undergoing PCI and analyze remaining controversial issues and future expectations.",Epigenetic silencing of Rab39a promotes epithelial to mesenchymal transition of cervical cancer through AKT signaling.,https://www.ncbi.nlm.nih.gov/pubmed/30826396,Experimental cell research,2019 04 02,"The objective of this study was to investigate the functional role of Rab39a in human cervical cancer (CC) and the underlying molecular mechanisms. We first measured Rab39a mRNA expression in CC tissues and paired non-tumor tissues by quantitative real-time PCR (QRT-PCR). Overall survival of CC patients with different mRNA levels of Rab39a in The Cancer Genome Atlas (TCGA) database was assessed by Kaplan-Meier survival curves analysis. Next methylation-specific PCR (MSP) was performed to determine the expression mechanism of Rab39a. Then cell proliferation, migration and invasion of Rab39a-transfected or mock-transfected cervical cancer cells were determined by CCK-8, flow cytometry, wound healing, transwell migration and invasion assays, respectively. Finally, the molecular mechanism by which Rab39a modulated CC cell epithelial-mesenchymal transition (EMT) was explored. It was found that Rab39a mRNA was significantly down-regulated in the high-risk patients compared to the low-risk patients (p = 0.0054). Six of seven cancer tissues with lymph node metastasis express low Rab39a mRNA compared to the surrounding non-tumor tissues. Cervical cancer patients with low level of Rab39a were showed a poorly clinical outcome (p = 0.004). Loss of Rab39a expression in cervical cancer tissues was associated with the aberrant DNA methylation in the promoter of Rab39a gene. Disrupted Rab39a expression in cervical cancer cells could be restored after treatment with the demethylated agent 5-Aza-2'-deoxycytidine. Furthermore, it was found that Rab39a hardly influenced cell growth but significantly suppressed cell migration, invasion and EMT process. Rab39a exerted its potential suppressor functions through inhibiting AKT phosphorylation. The inhibition effects of Rab39a could be blocked by AKT pathway inhibitor. Collectively, our data shows that Rab39a is a potential epigenetic silenced tumor suppressor inhibiting cancer invasion and migration through modulating the AKT signaling.","Ceasing exercise induces depression-like, anxiety-like, and impaired cognitive-like behaviours and altered hippocampal gene expression.",https://www.ncbi.nlm.nih.gov/pubmed/30826395,Brain research bulletin,2019 06 14,"Regular exercise can reduce depression-, anxiety-, and impaired cognitive-like behaviours, and upregulate hippocampal genes associated with neuroplasticity.

Unlike other anatomic locations, laryngeal lipomas can pose life-threatening symptoms secondary to acute obstruction of the upper aerodigestive tract. This report presents a case of a large SC/PL of the larynx associated with hoarseness, dysphagia, globus sensation, and neck fullness.

The potential effects the active metabolite of vitamin D exerts in pathological skin conditions like psoriasis needs to be clarified. Under ultraviolet B (UVB) irradiation skin can autonomously synthesize, activate and degrade vitamin D. In this pilot case study, we used for the first time Time-of-flight secondary ion mass spectrometry (ToF-SIMS) in the analysis of skin biopsies from a patient with psoriasis before and after UVB phototherapy. We were able to visualize vitamin D3 and its metabolites in the skin and subcutaneous tissue. At the same time information about their localization at subcellular level and morphology of the skin was received. This study proves that ToF-SIMS is a promising powerful tool to be used when investigating vitamin D´s role in dermatological diseases through skin biopsies.",The selection of comparators for randomized controlled trials of health-related behavioral interventions: recommendations of an NIH expert panel.,https://www.ncbi.nlm.nih.gov/pubmed/30826377,Journal of clinical epidemiology,2019 06 10,To provide recommendations for the selection of comparators for randomized controlled trials of health-related behavioral interventions.,ATXR5/6 Forms Alternative Protein Complexes with PCNA and the Nucleosome Core Particle.,https://www.ncbi.nlm.nih.gov/pubmed/30826376,Journal of molecular biology,2019 04 01,"The proliferating cell nuclear antigen (PCNA) is a sliding clamp associated with DNA polymerases and serves as a binding platform for the recruitment of regulatory proteins linked to DNA damage repair, cell cycle regulation, and epigenetic signaling. The histone H3 lysine-27 (H3K27) mono-methyltransferase Arabidopsis trithorax-related protein 5/6 (ATXR5/6) associates with PCNA, and this interaction has been proposed to act as a key determinant controlling the reestablishment of H3K27 mono-methylation following replication. In this study, we provide biochemical evidence showing that PCNA inhibits ATXR6 enzymatic activity. The structure of the ATXR6 PCNA-interacting peptide (PIP) in complex with PCNA indicates that a trio of hydrophobic residues contributes to the binding of the enzyme to the sliding clamp. Finally, despite the presence of three PIP binding clefts, only two molecules of ATXR6 bind to PCNA likely enabling the recruitment of a third protein to the sliding clamp. Collectively, these results rule out the model wherein PCNA-bound ATXR6 actively reestablishes H3K27 mono-methylation following DNA replication and provides insights into the role of ATXR6 PIP motif in its interaction with PCNA.",Ac-SDKP increases α-TAT 1 and promotes the apoptosis in lung fibroblasts and epithelial cells double-stimulated with TGF-β1 and silica.,https://www.ncbi.nlm.nih.gov/pubmed/30826375,Toxicology and applied pharmacology,2019 03 18,"Crystalline silica (SiO2) particles have very strong toxicity to the lungs, and silicosis is an excessive pulmonary interstitial remodeling disease that follows persistent SiO2 injury. We showed here that DNA double strand breaks (DSBs) and apoptosis were aggravated during rat silicosis induced by SiO2 exposure. Ac-SDKP attenuates lung parenchymal distortion and collagen deposition, and decreases the expression of γH2AX, p21, and cleaved caspase-3, as well as improves the reduction of pulmonary function caused by silicosis. In vitro, we found an evolution of smooth muscle actin α (α-SMA), collagen type I (Col I) in both A549 and MRC-5 cells in response to transforming growth factor-beta 1 (TGF-β1) + SiO2. Only A549 cells showed any reduction in the rate of apoptosis induced by the double stimulation, because of the anti-apoptotic effects of TGF-β1. N-acetyl-seryl-aspartyl-lysyl-proline (Ac-SDKP) is an anti-fibrotic tetrapeptide. It also has the ability to promote the apoptosis of leukemia cells. However its role in promoting cell apoptosis in silicosis is still unknown. We here found that Ac-SDKP could induce cell apoptosis and inhibit fibrotic response in A549 and MRC-5 cells treated with TGF-β1 + SiO2, and these effects depended on regulation of α-tubulin acetyltransferase 1 (α-TAT1). These findings suggest that Ac-SDKP may have therapeutic value in the treatment of silicotic fibrosis.",The long and short term effects of motherhood on the brain.,https://www.ncbi.nlm.nih.gov/pubmed/30826374,Frontiers in neuroendocrinology,2019 05 29,"Becoming a mother is associated with dramatic changes in physiology, endocrinology, immune function, and behaviour that begins during pregnancy and persists into the postpartum.

In this review, we summarize the short (pregnancy and postpartum) and long-term (beyond the postpartum and into middle age) effects of pregnancy and motherhood on cognition, neuroplasticity, and neuroimmune signalling. We also discuss the effects of previous history of pregnancy and motherhood (parity) on brain health and disease (neurodegenerative diseases and stroke outcomes) and on efficacy of hormone and antidepressant treatments.

However, their synthesis requires organic solvents, high temperature and high pressure that are incompatible with biomacromolecules. Zeolitic imidazole frameworks (ZIF-8) which forms through coordination between zinc ions and 2-methylimidazole (MeIM) have emerged as an advanced functional material for drug delivery due to its unique features such as high loading and pH-sensitive degradation. In this study, we took advantage of a natural biomineralization process to create aluminum-containing nanoZIF-8 particles for antigen delivery. Without organic solvents or stabilizing agent, nanoparticles (ZANPs) were synthesized by a mild and facile method with aluminum, model antigen ovalbumin (OVA) and ZIF-8 integrated. A high antigen loading capacity (%) of 30.6% and a pH dependent antigen release were achieved. A Toll-like receptor 9 agonist cytosine-phosphate-guanine oligodeoxynucleotides (CpG) was adsorbed on the surface of ZANPs (hereafter CpG/ZANPs) to boost the immune response. After subcutaneous injection in vivo, CpG/ZANPs targeted lymph nodes (LNs), where their cargo was efficiently internalized by LN-resident antigen-presenting cells (APCs). ZANPs decomposition in lysosomes released antigen into the cytoplasm and enhanced cross-presentation. Moreover, CpG/ZANPs induced strong antigen-specific humoral and cytotoxic T lymphocyte responses that significantly inhibited the growth of EG7-OVA tumors while showing minimal cytotoxicity. We demonstrate that ZANPs may be a safe and effective vehicle for the development of cancer vaccines.",Controlling and quantifying the stability of amino acid-based cargo within polymeric delivery systems.,https://www.ncbi.nlm.nih.gov/pubmed/30826372,Journal of controlled release : official journal of the Controlled Release Society,2019 04 13,"In recent years, the rapid growth and availability of protein and peptide therapeutics has not only expanded the boundaries of modern science but has also revolutionized the practice of medicine today. The potential of such therapies, however, is greatly limited by the innate instabilities of proteins and peptides, which is further magnified during therapeutic formulation processing, transport, storage, and administration. In this paper, we will consider the unique stability challenges associated with protein/peptide polymeric delivery systems from an engineering approach oriented towards the quantification and modification of amino acid-based cargo stability. While a number of methods have been developed for the purposes of quantifying factors affecting protein and peptide stability, current measurement techniques remain largely limited in scope in regard to polymeric drug delivery systems. This paper will primarily describe the influence of water content, pH, and temperature on protein and peptide stability within polymer-based delivery systems. Moreover, we will review current instrumentation used to quantify factors affecting protein/peptide stability with respect to water content, pH, and temperature. Lastly, we will outline several recommendations to help guide future research efforts to develop methods more specific to quantifying protein/peptide stability within polymer-based delivery systems.",Metabolomics profiling and pathway analysis of human plasma and urine reveal further insights into the multifactorial nature of coronary artery disease.,https://www.ncbi.nlm.nih.gov/pubmed/30826371,Clinica chimica acta; international journal of clinical chemistry,2019 06 13,Coronary artery disease (CAD) claims lives yearly.

Here, we investigate the ocelli of the bumblebee, Bombus terrestris, using reconstructed 3D data from X-ray microtomography scans combined with computational ray-tracing simulations. This method enables us, not only to predict the visual fields of the ocelli, but to explore for the first time the effect that hair has on them as well as the difference between worker female and male ocelli. We find that bumblebee ocellar fields of view are directed forward and dorsally, incorporating the horizon as well as the sky. There is substantial binocular overlap between the median and lateral ocelli, but no overlap between the two lateral ocelli. Hairs in both workers and males occlude the ocellar field of view, mostly laterally in the worker median ocellus and dorsally in the lateral ocelli. There is little to no sexual dimorphism in the ocellar visual field, suggesting that in B. terrestris they confer no advantage to mating strategies. We compare our results with published observations for the visual fields of compound eyes in the same species as well as with the ocellar vision of other bee and insect species.",Long-term liraglutide ameliorates nigrostriatal impairment via regulating AMPK/PGC-1a signaling in diabetic mice.,https://www.ncbi.nlm.nih.gov/pubmed/30826352,Brain research,2019 04 22,"Growing evidence indicates links between type 2 diabetes and Parkinson's disease. The glucagon-like peptide 1 analogue, liraglutide, a commonly used anti-diabetic drug, has protective effects on neurons. The goal of this study was to determine whether long-term liraglutide treatment could reduce the risk of adult type 2 diabetic mice developing Parkinson's disease. Male diabetic db/db mice (12 weeks old) were injected daily with liraglutide (n = 8), or saline (n = 8), and non-diabetic m/m littermates (n = 6) were included as controls. Motor function was assessed every 4 weeks and all mice were sacrificed after 8 weeks of drug intervention for further analysis. The results revealed that long-term treatment of liraglutide protected the db/db mice against the motor function decay and the dopaminergic neuron loss. Liraglutide also restored the impaired AMP kinase (AMPK)/peroxisome proliferator-activated receptor-γ coactivator 1a (PGC-1a) signaling in the striatum of db/db mice. Further experiments in SH-SY5Y cells supported that AMPK is involved in the neuroprotective effect of liraglutide. In summary, long-term liraglutide ameliorated motor dysfunction and dopaminergic neuron impairment in type 2 diabetic mice, probably via enhancing AMPK/PGC-1a signaling.","Pulsed Field Gel Electrophoresis: Past, present, and future.",https://www.ncbi.nlm.nih.gov/pubmed/30826351,Analytical biochemistry,2019 04 12,"Pulsed Field Gel Electrophoresis (PFGE) has been considered for many years the 'gold-standard' for characterizing many pathogenic organisms as well as for subtyping bacterial species causing infection outbreaks.

Remarkably, we summarize here the most relevant theoretical and practical aspects that we have learned for more than 20 years developing and using the miniaturized PFGE systems. We also discussed the theoretical aspects related to DNA migration in PFGE agarose gels. It served as the basis for simulating the DNA electrophoretic patterns in CHEF mini gels and mini-chambers during experimental design and optimization. A critical comparison between standard and miniaturized PFGE systems, as well as the enzymatic and non-enzymatic methods for intact immobilized DNA preparation, is provided throughout the review.

Lyophilization is widely used in vaccine production. However, it requires a longer production cycle and large-scale equipment, thus posing a considerable financial burden for developing countries. A potential solution is the development of liquid LAIV, which can increase the yield and reduce the cost of production. In this study, influential factors of LAIV, such as potential stabilizing excipients and pH, were optimized by an orthogonal design. We found that pH is the most critical factor for the stability of LAIV; salt concentration and initial virus titer are also important for LAIV stability. With these data, we developed a liquid formulation consisting of 2.5% sucrose, 0.1% monosodium glutamate, 1% arginine, and 0.5% human serum albumin, with pH ranging from 6.2 to 6.9 (optimum pH 6.5-6.7), for optimal production of monovalent or trivalent LAIVs. This liquid formulation has the potential to considerably improve vaccine production capacity to compensate for the immense shortfall in influenza vaccines globally.",Indication of quantum mechanical electron transport in human substantia nigra tissue from conductive atomic force microscopy analysis.,https://www.ncbi.nlm.nih.gov/pubmed/30826349,Bio Systems,2019 03 31,"Neuromelanin and ferritin in dopamine neurons of the substantia nigra have a distribution and density that is similar to disordered arrays of quantum dots in photovoltaic devices, which have been experimentally shown to conduct electric energy using quantum mechanical electron transport mechanisms.

The test results presented here provide evidence of quantum mechanical electron transport from ferritin and neuromelanin at levels that may be sufficient to cause or contribute to generation of action potentials.","Chronic, low-level oral exposure to marine toxin, domoic acid, alters whole brain morphometry in nonhuman primates.",https://www.ncbi.nlm.nih.gov/pubmed/30826346,Neurotoxicology,2019 06 16,"Domoic acid (DA) is an excitatory neurotoxin produced by marine algae and responsible for Amnesiac Shellfish Poisoning in humans. Current regulatory limits (˜0.075-0.1 mg/kg/day) protect against acute toxicity, but recent studies suggest that the chronic consumption of DA below the regulatory limit may produce subtle neurotoxicity in adults, including decrements in memory. As DA-algal blooms are increasing in both severity and frequency, we sought to better understand the effects of chronic DA exposure on reproductive and neurobehavioral endpoints in a preclinical nonhuman primate model. To this end, we initiated a long-term study using adult, female Macaca fascicularis monkeys exposed to daily, oral doses of 0.075 or 0.15 mg/kg of DA for a range of 321-381, and 346-554 days, respectively. This time period included a pre-pregnancy, pregnancy, and postpartum period. Throughout these times, trained data collectors observed intentional tremors in some exposed animals during biweekly clinical examinations. The present study explores the basis of this neurobehavioral finding with in vivo imaging techniques, including diffusion tensor magnetic resonance imaging and spectroscopy. Diffusion tensor analyses revealed that, while DA exposed macaques did not significantly differ from controls, increases in DA-related tremors were negatively correlated with fractional anisotropy, a measure of structural integrity, in the internal capsule, fornix, pons, and corpus callosum. Brain concentrations of lactate, a neurochemical closely linked with astrocytes, were also weakly, but positively associated with tremors. These findings are the first documented results suggesting that chronic oral exposure to DA at concentrations near the current human regulatory limit are related to structural and chemical changes in the adult primate brain.",Residential exposure to urban traffic is associated with the poorer neurobehavioral health of Ecuadorian schoolchildren.,https://www.ncbi.nlm.nih.gov/pubmed/30826345,Neurotoxicology,2019 05 24,"We investigated whether chronic traffic-generated air pollution containing fine and ultrafine particulate matter is associated with reduced neurobehavioral performance and behavioral dysfunction in urban Ecuadorian schoolchildren.

The accumulation of uremic toxins in the brain causes uremic encephalopathy, however, limited data exists to elucidate the effect of protein-bound uremic toxins on cognitive function. Here we investigate the effect of indole-3 acetic acid (IAA) and hippuric acid (HA), two different protein-bound uremic toxins from amino acid derivatives, on cognitive function by Silico and in a clinical study. Prevalent HD patients were enrolled in two independent hospitals. Serum IAA and HA were measured using mass spectrometry. Cognitive performance was measured using Mini-Mental State Examination (MMSE), Montreal Cognitive Assessment (MoCA), and Cognitive Abilities Screening Instrument (CASI) by trained psychologists. Using silico data to predict the effect of blood-brain barrier penetration was performed. The silico data demonstrated that IAA and HA had positive blood-brain barrier penetration ability. Amongst the 230 HD patients, serum IAA was associated with poor MMSE score (β= -0.90, 95% CI -1.61 to -0.19) and poor CASI score (β= -3.29, 95% CI -5.69 to -0.88) in stepwise multiple linear regression analysis. In logistic regression model, Serum IAA was also associated with cognitive impairment based on MMSE definition (OR, 1.96, 95% CI 1.10, 3.5) and CASI definition (OR, 2.09, 95% CI 1.21, 3.61). There was no correlation between Serum HA levels and cognitive function status. In conclusion, IAA, not HA, was associated with cognitive impairment in HD patients. Further large scale and prospective studies are needed to confirm our findings.",Need for speed: Super-resolving the dynamic nanoclustering of syntaxin-1 at exocytic fusion sites.,https://www.ncbi.nlm.nih.gov/pubmed/30826343,Neuropharmacology,2019 03 18,"Communication between cells relies on regulated exocytosis, a multi-step process that involves the docking, priming and fusion of vesicles with the plasma membrane, culminating in the release of neurotransmitters and hormones. Key proteins and lipids involved in exocytosis are subjected to Brownian movement and constantly switch between distinct motion states which are governed by short-lived molecular interactions. Critical biochemical reactions between exocytic proteins that occur in the confinement of nanodomains underpin the precise sequence of priming steps which leads to the fusion of vesicles. The advent of super-resolution microscopy techniques has provided the means to visualize individual molecules on the plasma membrane with high spatiotemporal resolution in live cells. These techniques are revealing a highly dynamic nature of the nanoscale organization of the exocytic machinery. In this review, we focus on soluble N-ethylmaleimide-sensitive factor attachment receptor (SNARE) syntaxin-1, which mediates vesicular fusion. Syntaxin-1 is highly mobile at the plasma membrane, and its inherent speed allows fast assembly and disassembly of syntaxin-1 nanoclusters which are associated with exocytosis. We reflect on recent studies which have revealed the mechanisms regulating syntaxin-1 nanoclustering on the plasma membrane and draw inferences on the effect of synaptic activity, phosphoinositides, N-ethylmaleimide-sensitive factor (NSF), α-soluble NSF attachment protein (α-SNAP) and SNARE complex assembly on the dynamic nanoscale organization of syntaxin-1.",MicroRNA-30d deficiency during preconception affects endometrial receptivity by decreasing implantation rates and impairing fetal growth.,https://www.ncbi.nlm.nih.gov/pubmed/30826341,American journal of obstetrics and gynecology,2019 04 15,"Maternal-embryonic crosstalk between the endometrium and the preimplantation embryo is required for normal pregnancy.

Under normal conditions, MMP, ADAM and ADAMTS gene expression aids in the maintenance of homeostasis. However, in inflamed synovial joints characteristic of rheumatoid arthritis and osteoarthritis. MMP, ADAM and ADAMTS production is greatly increased under the influence of pro-inflammatory cytokines. Analyses based on medicinal chemistry strategies designed to directly inhibit the activity of MMPs have been largely unsuccessful when these MMP inhibitors were employed in animal models of rheumatoid arthritis and osteoarthritis. This is despite the fact that these MMP inhibitors were largely able to suppress pro-inflammatory cytokine-induced MMP production in vitro. A focus on ADAM and ADAMTS inhibitors has also been pursued. Thus, recent progress has identified the ""sheddase"" activity of ADAMs as a viable target and the development of GW280264X is an experimental ADAM17 inhibitor. Of note, a monoclonal antibody, GLPG1972, developed as an ADAMTS-5 inhibitor, entered a Phase I OA clinical trial. However, the failure of many of these previously developed inhibitors to move beyond the preclinical testing phase has required that novel strategies be developed that are designed to suppress both MMP, ADAM and ADAMTS production and activity.",Cyclin-dependent kinase inhibitors AZD5438 and R547 show potential for enhancing efficacy of daunorubicin-based anticancer therapy: Interaction with carbonyl-reducing enzymes and ABC transporters.,https://www.ncbi.nlm.nih.gov/pubmed/30826329,Biochemical pharmacology,2019 04 17,"Daunorubicin (DAUN) has served as an anticancer drug in chemotherapy regimens for decades and is still irreplaceable in treatment of acute leukemias. The therapeutic outcome of DAUN-based therapy is compromised by its cardiotoxicity and emergence of drug resistance. This phenomenon is often caused by pharmacokinetic mechanisms such as efflux of DAUN from cancer cells through ATP-binding cassette (ABC) transporters and its conversion to less cytostatic but more cardiotoxic daunorubicinol (DAUN-OL) by carbonyl reducing enzymes (CREs). Here we aimed to investigate, whether two cyclin-dependent kinase inhibitors, AZD5438 and R547, can interact with these pharmacokinetic mechanisms and reverse DAUN resistance. Using accumulation assays, we revealed AZD5438 as potent inhibitor of ABCC1 showing also weaker inhibitory effect to ABCB1 and ABCG2. Combination index analysis, however, shown that inhibition of ABCC1 does not significantly contribute to synergism between AZD5438 and DAUN in MDCKII-ABCC1 cells, suggesting predominant role of other mechanism. Using pure recombinant enzymes, we found both tested drugs to inhibit CREs with aldo-keto reductase 1C3 (AKR1C3). This interaction was further confirmed in transfected HCT-116 cells. Moreover, these cells were sensitized to DAUN by both compounds as Chou-Talalay combination index analysis showed synergism in AKR1C3 transfected HCT-116, but not in empty vector transfected control cell line. In conclusion, we propose AZD5438 and R547 as modulators of DAUN resistance that can prevent AKR1C3-mediated DAUN biotransformation to DAUN-OL. This interaction could be beneficially exploited to prevent failure of DAUN-based therapy as well as the undesirable cardiotoxic effect of DAUN-OL.",Na+/Ca2+ exchangers: Unexploited opportunities for cancer therapy?,https://www.ncbi.nlm.nih.gov/pubmed/30826328,Biochemical pharmacology,2019 04 17,"Calcium is a well-studied ion that acts as a cofactor in several reactions and as intracellular second messenger. It plays crucial roles in living cells by regulating several processes from cell division to death. The disruption of Ca2+ homeostasis is related to cell and tissue damage and it is involved in several pathological conditions and diseases, including cancer. Tumor cells exhibit several molecular features in relation to normal cells in order to acquire proliferative and survival advantages, and Ca2+ signaling is directly or indirectly involved in these pathways. Thus, changes in the expression of Ca2+ channels and pumps are frequently described in some cancers, including transient receptor potential (TRP) family channels, store- and voltage-gated Ca2+ channels, store release channels, and Ca2+ ATPases. Although the sodium/calcium exchanger (Na+/Ca2+ exchanger; NCX) and the therapeutic potential of its inhibitors have been extensively studied in heart diseases, there are few studies about the molecular and functional aspects of NCX in cancer.

Available clinical data support the interest of nerve growth factor as a target in pain control as well as the disease-modifying potential of inhibitors of Wnt signaling or catabolic enzymes such as aggrecanases and cathepsin K, and anabolic strategies like fibroblast growth factor-18 or cellular therapies. Carefully controlled studies in patients selected according to OA phenotypes and with a long follow-up will help to confirm the relevance of these new approaches as emerging therapeutic treatments in OA.",Trypanosoma dionisii in insectivorous bats from northern China.,https://www.ncbi.nlm.nih.gov/pubmed/30826326,Acta tropica,2019 05 28,"Although bats were considered as a major host of trypanosomatid flagellates, information of trypanosomes in bats is unknown in China. We collected bats in 2015 from Shandong Province of China and used PCR to amplify the Trypanosoma glycosomal glyceraldehyde phosphate dehydrogenase (gGAPDH) gene and 18S rRNA gene from the bat blood samples and heart tissues. The results showed that 10.3% (13/126) of bats (Eptesicus serotinus and Myotis pequinius) were positive for trypanosomatid DNA and DNA sequencing showed that all PCR amplified Trypanosoma DNA belonged to T. dionisii. We concluded that T. dionisii had a infection rate in bats from China. For the first time, Trypanosoma infections were detected in bats from China, providing valuable information on the prevalence of these parasites in Asia. This is also the first report of Trypanosoma dionisii in Myotis pequinius, suggesting that Trypanosoma dionisii has a broad host species.","PET/TC imaging with somatostatin analogues for assessment of neuroendocrine tumors, initial experience.",https://www.ncbi.nlm.nih.gov/pubmed/30826325,Revista espanola de medicina nuclear e imagen molecular,2019 03 03,"PET with somatostatin analogues (SSA PET/CT) enables the detection of cells with overexpression of somatostatin receptors, especially subtypes 2 and 5; this detection is variable depending on the type of molecule used. This is the basis for its use in the study of neuroendocrine tumours (NETs), which are characterized by an overexpression of these receptors in more than 80% of the subtypes. This PET is now being used in our country supported by the good results published by other groups, that were superior to those of other imaging techniques. We present two of the first cases of SSA-PET/CT with 68Ga-edotreotide (SomaKit TOC®) performed in our centre. SSA-PET/CT was the test that finally determined the clinical management of both patients.","Amniotic cells share clusters of differentiation of fibroblasts and keratinocytes, influencing their ability to proliferate and aid in wound healing while impairing their angiogenesis capability.",https://www.ncbi.nlm.nih.gov/pubmed/30826324,European journal of pharmacology,2019 05 24,"An alternative to cultured skin cell grafts usage in burn treatment is the graft of allogenic stem cells. We verified whether amniotic stem cells are better than the present therapeutic standard: grafts of autologous keratinocytes and fibroblasts along with autologous adipose-derived stem cells, and whether amniotic stem cells can support the growth of autologous keratinocytes and fibroblasts in the culture. The study was performed on the material from 18 amnia. Skin cells were obtained from 3 patients. In order to assess the influence of stem cells on keratinocytes and fibroblasts, the following experiments were performed: impact on viability and cell cycle, wound healing capability, angiogenesis capability, influence on the proliferation speed and capability to differentiate into skin cells. We demonstrated that human amniotic membrane-derived mesenchymal stem cells (hAMMSCs) share amniotic proteins with skin cells. Amniotic stem cells may replace skin fibroblasts in grafts due to the close similarity in their surface antigens, with significantly larger proliferative potential and ability to stimulate wound healing. It was shown that adding amniotic cells to both keratinocytes and fibroblast cultures accelerates directional migration by ≥ 40%. We confirmed in this study the influence of amniotic cells on the proliferation and cell cycle of fibroblasts and keratinocytes. Amniotic stem cells can be successfully used not only as a first choice graft but also to replace 3T3 line cells, supporting the proliferation of the cells during the culturing, as well as a supplementary graft supporting an autologous graft of keratinocytes and fibroblasts.",Preemptive Oral Acetaminophen for Women Undergoing Total Laparoscopic Hysterectomy.,https://www.ncbi.nlm.nih.gov/pubmed/30826322,Nursing for women's health,2019 04 12,To decrease hospital expenses by administering oral acetaminophen rather than intravenous (IV) acetaminophen to women who undergo laparoscopic hysterectomy.,Perinephric myxoid pseudotumor of fat: a distinctive pseudoneoplasm most often associated with non-neoplastic renal disease.,https://www.ncbi.nlm.nih.gov/pubmed/30826321,Human pathology,2019 05 18,"In 2009, Tanas et al reported unusual changes in the perinephric fat, mimicking well-differentiated liposarcoma. We report 11 perinephric masses showing similar changes but chiefly arising in patients with non-neoplastic renal disease. Tissue from 11 perinephric masses was retrieved, and immunohistochemistry for IgG/IgG4 and fluorescence in situ hybridization (FISH) for MDM2 amplification was performed. Clinical information was obtained. Cases occurred in 10 males and 1 female (43-84 years of age; median, 63.5 years). Ten patients presented with perinephric masses (size range, 2-28 cm), and one was an incidental finding. Four patients had bilateral or multiple masses. Underlying renal disease included diabetes mellitus (n = 3), end-stage kidney (n = 2), diabetes and end-stage kidney disease (n = 1), chronic pyelonephritis (n = 1), and non-invasive high-grade papillary urothelial carcinoma of the renal pelvis (n = 1). Three patients were not known to have renal disease. Most tumors were submitted as ""well-differentiated liposarcoma."" The masses consisted of mature fat, myxoid stroma, moderately variable spindled to stellate cells and a mixed inflammatory cell infiltrate. Enlarged, hyperchromatic stromal cells were absent. IgG4-positive plasma cells and MDM2 amplification were absent in all tested cases. Clinical follow-up (11 patients; range, 1-120 months; median, 24 months) showed absent or stable disease in 9 patients; 2 died of unrelated causes. This distinctive pseudoneoplasm usually occurs in association with non-neoplastic renal disease, although similar changes may be identified in the perinephric fat of patients with renal carcinoma.

Despite this, little is known about the time-course of development of functional deficits, particularly cognitive and neuropsychiatric impairments, and whether these differ depending on the nature of the initiating insult. Therefore, this study investigated long term functional impairment at 12 months post-injury following diffuse TBI of different severities. Male Sprague-Dawley rats (420-480 g; 10-12 weeks) were either given a sham surgery (n = 14) or subjected to Marmarou's impact acceleration model of diffuse TBI for a single mild TBI (n = 12), repetitive mild TBI (3 mild diffuse injuries at 5 day intervals) (n = 14) or moderate to severe TBI (n = 14). At 12 months after injury, they were tested on a functional battery encompassing motor, neuropsychiatric (anxiety and depressive-like) and cognitive function. Our results showed that moderate to severe TBI animals exhibited significant impairments in cognitive flexibility (p = 0.009) on the Barnes maze when compared to age-matched sham animals. Neither repetitive mild TBI nor single mild TBI animals showed significant functional impairments when compared to shams. Thus, this study provides the first insight into chronic functional impairments associated with different severities of diffuse TBI, with moderate to severe TBI being a higher risk factor for impaired cognitive function at 12 months post-injury. Taken together, this may have implications for risk of dementia development following different severities of injury.",Neuregulin1 attenuates cognitive deficits and hippocampal CA1 neuronal apoptosis partly via ErbB4 receptor in a rat model of chronic cerebral hypoperfusion.,https://www.ncbi.nlm.nih.gov/pubmed/30826297,Behavioural brain research,2019 03 23,"Neuregulin1 (NRG1) is an effective neuroprotectant. Previously we demonstrated that the expression of hippocampal NRG1/ErbB4 gradually decreased and correlates with neuronal apoptosis during chronic cerebral hypoperfusion (CCH). Here we aimed to further investigate the protective role of NRG1 in CCH. AG1478, an ErbB4 inhibitor, was used to explore the involvement of ErbB4 receptors in NRG1's action. Permanent bilateral common carotid artery occlusion (2VO) or sham operation was performed in Sprague-Dawley rats. NRG1 (100 μM) and AG1478 (50 mM) was administered intraventricularly. Eight weeks post-surgery, cognitive impairment was analyzed using Morris water maze (MWM) and radial arm water maze (RAWM) tests, followed by histological assessment of the survival and apoptosis of hippocampal CA1 neurons using NeuN and TUNEL immunostaining respectively. Expression of apoptosis-related proteins and ErbB4 activation (pErbB4/ErbB4) was evaluated by Western blotting. The results showed that NRG1 significantly improved the performances in MWM (spatial learning and memory) and RAWM (spatial working and reference memory), attenuated hippocampal CA1 neuronal loss and apoptosis, upregulated the expression of pErbB4/ErbB4 and the anti-apoptotic protein Bcl-2, and downregulated the expression of pro-apoptotic proteins of Cleaved (Cl)-caspase3 and Bax. In addition, the protective effects of NRG1 could be partly abolished by AG1478. Taken together, our study suggested that NRG1 ameliorates cognitive impairment and neuronal apoptosis partly via ErbB4 receptors in rats with CCH."

WE-THRIVE aims to identify measurement domains that are internationally relevant, including in low-, middle-, and high-income countries, prioritize concepts to operationalize domains, and specify a set of data elements to measure concepts that can be used across studies for data sharing and comparisons. This article reports findings from consortium meetings at the 2016 meeting of the Gerontological Society of America and the 2017 meeting of the International Association of Gerontology and Geriatrics, to identify domains and prioritize concepts, following best practices to identify common data elements (CDEs) that were developed through the US National Institutes of Health/National Institute of Nursing Research's CDEs initiative. Four domains were identified, including organizational context, workforce and staffing, person-centered care, and care outcomes. Using a nominal group process, WE-THRIVE prioritized 21 concepts across the 4 domains. Several concepts showed similarity to existing measurement structures, whereas others differed. Conceptual similarity (convergence; eg, concepts in the care outcomes domain of functional level and harm-free care) provides further support of the critical foundational work in LTC measurement endorsed and implemented by regulatory bodies. Different concepts (divergence; eg, concepts in the person-centered care domain of knowing the person and what matters most to the person) highlights current gaps in measurement efforts and is consistent with WE-THRIVE's focus on supporting resilience and thriving for residents, family, and staff.

Objectives were to test the hypothesis that elimination of GnRH on Day 0 (GnRH-1) does not impact significantly the synchronized development of a dominant follicle for presumptive FTAI. Seventy-one estrous cycling Brangus and Brahman x Hereford suckled cows were used in two replicates (35-36/replicate). Following stratification, cows were assigned randomly to a 2 × 3 factorial arrangement of treatments involving two truncated (no FTAI or GnRH-2) versions of Bee Synch (Bee Synch It and IIt), each begun 3, 7, and 10 days post-ovulation.

Influences of TG on ICa-L, [Ca2+]i and contraction in isolated rat myocytes were observed by the patch-clamp technique and IonOptix detection system. TG significantly reduced J-point elevation, heart rate, serum levels of CK and LDH, and improved heart pathologic morphology. TG decreased ICa-L in concentration-dependent manner with a half-maximal inhibitory concentration (IC50) of 31.65 μg/mL. TG (300 μg/mL) decreased ICa-L of normal and ischemic ventricular myocytes by 64.33 ± 1.28% and 61.29 ± 1.38% respectively. At 30 μg/mL, TG reduced Ca2+ transient by 21.67 ± 0.94% and cell shortening by 38.43 ± 6.49%. This study showed that TG displayed cardioprotective effects on ISO-induced MI rats and the underlying mechanisms may be related to inhibition of ICa-L, damping of [Ca2+]i and decrease of contractility.",Mental disorders and weight change in a prospective study of bariatric surgery patients: 7 years of follow-up.,https://www.ncbi.nlm.nih.gov/pubmed/30826244,Surgery for obesity and related diseases : official journal of the American Society for Bariatric Surgery,2019 03 03,"Long-term, longitudinal data are limited on mental disorders after bariatric surgery.",Long-term outcomes of laparoscopic sleeve gastrectomy versus Roux-en-Y gastric bypass for morbid obesity: Results from a meta-analysis of randomized controlled trials.,https://www.ncbi.nlm.nih.gov/pubmed/30826243,Surgery for obesity and related diseases : official journal of the American Society for Bariatric Surgery,2019 05 28,"Laparoscopic sleeve gastrectomy and laparoscopic Roux-en-Y gastric bypass (LRYGB) are 2 widely used procedures performed in bariatric surgery.

The assembly and biophysical properties of condensates are precisely regulated by chaperone proteins, post-translational modifications (PTMs), and numerous cellular factors. Phase separation also triages misfolded and unwanted proteins for autophagic degradation. The concerted actions of receptor proteins, scaffold proteins, and PTMs determine the size, assembly rate, and material properties of condensates for efficient removal. Altered phase separation and transition affect the degradation of protein condensates, resulting in their accumulation under certain developmental and pathological conditions.

Dubbed the ER membrane protein complex (EMC), its disruption has since been found to affect wide-ranging processes, including protein trafficking, organelle communication, ER stress, viral maturation, lipid homeostasis, and others. However, its molecular function has remained enigmatic. Recent studies suggest a role for EMC during membrane protein biogenesis. Biochemical reconstitution experiments show that EMC can directly mediate the insertion of transmembrane domains (TMDs) into the lipid bilayer. Given the large proportion of genes encoding membrane proteins, a central role for EMC as a TMD insertion factor can explain its high abundance, wide conservation, and pleiotropic phenotypes.",Activated Extracellular Vesicles as New Therapeutic Targets?,https://www.ncbi.nlm.nih.gov/pubmed/30826213,Trends in cell biology,2019 06 10,"A recent study by Genschmer et al.

This substantial antigenic load is countered by B cells whose antigen receptors (antibodies or immunoglobulins) are also monoallelically expressed, and that diversify dynamically to counter each variant antigen. Here we examine parallels between the processes that generate VSGs and antibodies. We also discuss current insights into VSG mRNA regulation that may inform the emerging field of Ig mRNA biology.

However, little is known about the health effects of low-level environmental Cd exposure on pregnant women. The objective of this study was to assess urinary metabolic alterations in pregnant women exposed to environmental Cd, and to identify informative biomarkers. Urine samples from 246 pregnant women in the first trimester of pregnancy were collected, and urinary Cd concentrations were quantified using inductively coupled plasma mass spectrometry (ICP-MS). Urinary metabolomics was analyzed by ultra-performance liquid chromatography coupled to quadrupole time-of-flight mass spectrometry (UPLC-QTOF-MS). Cd-related metabolic biomarkers were examined by comparing the samples of the first and third tertiles of Cd exposure classifications, using a partial least-squares discriminant (PLS-DA) model. Five putative biomarkers were identified, including L-cystine, L-tyrosine, dityrosine, histamine, and uric acid, all of which were related to oxidative stress and nephrotoxic effects induced by Cd exposure. The results show that low-level environmental Cd exposure could induce metabolite profile alterations in pregnant women, which might be associated with adverse health effects.

VHL and CRBN are also the two most popular E3 ligases being recruited by bifunctional Proteolysis-targeting chimeras (PROTACs) to induce ubiquitination and subsequent proteasomal degradation of a target protein. Using homo-PROTACs, VHL and CRBN have been independently dimerized to induce their own degradation. Here we report the design, synthesis and cellular activity of VHL-CRBN hetero-dimerizing PROTACs featuring diverse conjugation patterns. We found that the most active compound 14a induced potent, rapid and profound preferential degradation of CRBN over VHL in cancer cell lines. At lower concentrations, weaker degradation of VHL was instead observed. This work demonstrates proof of concept of designing PROTACs to hijack different E3 ligases against each other, and highlights a powerful and generalizable proximity-induced strategy to achieve E3 ligase knockdown.",Proteomic analysis of small intestinal epithelial cells in antibiotic-treated mice: Changes in drug transporters and metabolizing enzymes.,https://www.ncbi.nlm.nih.gov/pubmed/30826185,Drug metabolism and pharmacokinetics,2019 04 12,"Antibiotics act on bacterial flora originally present in the intestine, and changes in the intestinal flora have various effects on the host. This study investigated changes in the protein levels of drug transporters and metabolizing enzymes in the small intestines of antibiotic-treated mice by proteomic analysis. After the oral administration of non-absorbable antibiotics (vancomycin and polymyxin B) for 5 days, 15 drug transporter or metabolizing enzyme proteins had significantly changed levels among 1780 proteins identified in small intestinal epithelial cells. Of these, the levels of peptide transporter 1 (Pept1), multidrug resistance protein 1a (Mdr1a), and multidrug resistance-associated protein 2 (Mrp2) were increased approximately 2-fold. In addition, the levels of two Cyp4f proteins were decreased and those of Cyp4b1, Ces1d, and three glutathione S-transferase (Gst) proteins were increased. Our results indicate that the oral administration of antibiotics changes the levels of proteins related to the absorption and metabolism of drugs in the small intestine, and suggest that substrate drugs of these proteins have a risk for indirect drug interactions with antibacterial drugs via the intestinal flora.",Uric acid analogue as a possible xenobiotic marker of uric acid transporter Urat1 in rats.,https://www.ncbi.nlm.nih.gov/pubmed/30826184,Drug metabolism and pharmacokinetics,2019 04 12,"The inhibitor of uric acid reabsorptive transporter URAT1 in kidney is drawing attention as a drug target for hyperuricemia. However, it is difficult to evaluate efficacy of URAT1 inhibitors in vivo using laboratory animals due to species difference in uric acid metabolism. In the present study, the usefulness of exogenously administering uric acid analogues resistant to uricase was investigated for in vivo evaluation of transport activity of rUrat1 in rats. Uptake of examined four uric acid analogues by rUrat1-expressing Xenopus oocytes was significantly higher than that by water-injected oocytes. In metabolism studies, disappearance of these compounds was negligible, while uric acid was significantly decreased. When oxypurinol was administered to rats, fractional excretion (FE) was 0.4, suggesting reabsorption of oxypurinol. Moreover, FE of oxypurinol was tended to be increased, but not statistically different, by co-administration of a uricosuric agent FYU-981, while plasma concentration of oxypurinol was not affected. These results suggested that oxypurinol is a potential uric acid analogue, although it was not suitable as a probe of uric acid in in vivo study. Our findings may contribute to discovery and development of novel uricosuric agent targeting URAT1.",Distinct Modes of Presynaptic Inhibition of Cutaneous Afferents and Their Functions in Behavior.,https://www.ncbi.nlm.nih.gov/pubmed/30826183,Neuron,2019 04 20,"Presynaptic inhibition (PSI) of primary sensory neurons is implicated in controlling gain and acuity in sensory systems. Here, we define circuit mechanisms and functions of PSI of cutaneous somatosensory neuron inputs to the spinal cord. We observed that PSI can be evoked by different sensory neuron populations and mediated through at least two distinct dorsal horn circuit mechanisms. Low-threshold cutaneous afferents evoke a GABAA-receptor-dependent form of PSI that inhibits similar afferent subtypes, whereas small-diameter afferents predominantly evoke an NMDA-receptor-dependent form of PSI that inhibits large-diameter fibers. Behaviorally, loss of either GABAA receptors (GABAARs) or NMDA receptors (NMDARs) in primary afferents leads to tactile hypersensitivity across skin types, and loss of GABAARs, but not NMDARs, leads to impaired texture discrimination. Post-weaning age loss of either GABAARs or NMDARs in somatosensory neurons causes systemic behavioral abnormalities, revealing critical roles of two distinct modes of PSI of somatosensory afferents in adolescence and throughout adulthood.",RNA Binding Antagonizes Neurotoxic Phase Transitions of TDP-43.,https://www.ncbi.nlm.nih.gov/pubmed/30826182,Neuron,2019 04 20,"TDP-43 proteinopathy is a pathological hallmark of amyotrophic lateral sclerosis and frontotemporal dementia where cytoplasmic TDP-43 inclusions are observed within degenerating regions of patient postmortem tissue. The mechanism by which TDP-43 aggregates has remained elusive due to technological limitations, which prevent the analysis of specific TDP-43 interactions in live cells. We present an optogenetic approach to reliably induce TDP-43 proteinopathy under spatiotemporal control. We show that the formation of pathologically relevant inclusions is driven by aberrant interactions between low-complexity domains of TDP-43 that are antagonized by RNA binding. Although stress granules are hypothesized to be a conduit for seeding TDP-43 proteinopathy, we demonstrate pathological inclusions outside these RNA-rich structures. Furthermore, we show that aberrant phase transitions of cytoplasmic TDP-43 are neurotoxic and that treatment with oligonucleotides composed of TDP-43 target sequences prevent inclusions and rescue neurotoxicity. Collectively, these studies provide insight into the mechanisms that underlie TDP-43 proteinopathy and present a potential avenue for therapeutic intervention.",Misperceived Risks of Zika-related Microcephaly in India.,https://www.ncbi.nlm.nih.gov/pubmed/30826180,Trends in microbiology,2019 04 12,"After the discovery that Zika virus (ZIKV) could cause microcephaly and other birth defects, we have scrambled to understand how.

Ongoing IFN-responses have also been documented in a variety of human autoimmune diseases including relapsing-remitting multiple sclerosis (RRMS) but their origins remain obscure. We find increased IFN-responses in leukocytes in relapsing-remitting multiple sclerosis at distinct stages of disease. Moreover, endogenous RNAs isolated from blood cells of these same patients recapitulate this IFN-response if transfected into naïve cells. These endogenous RNAs are double-stranded RNAs, contain Alu and Line elements and are transcribed from leukocyte transcriptional enhancers. Thus, transcribed endogenous retrotransposon elements can co-opt pattern recognition sensors to induce IFN-responses in RRMS."

Increasingly the importance of these skills is being recognised in outcomes for patients and staff, and training courses and assessment tools are being developed and used in obstetrics. Understanding of the role of nontechnical skills in labour and especially in operative vaginal births should be embedded across the specialty. Further research is needed in validation of assessment tools for these skills when used in obstetrics.","Powered standing wheelchairs promote independence, health and community involvement in adolescents with Duchenne muscular dystrophy.",https://www.ncbi.nlm.nih.gov/pubmed/30826157,Neuromuscular disorders : NMD,2019 03 19,"Duchenne muscular dystrophy is a common neuromuscular disorder involving progressive muscle weakness.

SERT density was measured in striatal and cortical regions by quantitative in vitro autoradiography using the SERT-radioligand, [3H]-DASB. Higher SERT density was observed in FSL rats compared to SD rats by 36-48% in motor cortex and striatum under sham conditions. In response to ECS, SD rats displayed a significant effect of treatment, whereas no changes were observed in FRL and FSL rats. Increased SERT binding in FSL rats compared to SD supports a dysfunction of the serotonergic system in depression. The increased SERT density after ECS, seen in SD rats but not FSL rats, suggests a different mechanism of action between depressive-like rats and controls.",Chitin as a substrate for the biostimulation of sulfate-reducing bacteria in the treatment of mine-impacted water (MIW).,https://www.ncbi.nlm.nih.gov/pubmed/30826155,Journal of hazardous materials,2019 06 08,"This study aims to know the basis of sulfate-reducing bacteria (SRB) and chitin source relationship for the development of a biotreatment system for mine-impacted water (MIW). The MIW consists of river water impacted by coal acid mine drainage (AMD), an extremely acid effluent, rich in sulfate and dissolved metal ions, with a high pollutant potential. Chitin was used as metal ion sorbent and biostimulant of SRB, whose anaerobic dissimilatory metabolism reduces sulfate to sulfide. Microcosms were built in an oxygen-free atmosphere using chitin from two different sources: commercial chitin and shrimp shell waste, which contains calcium carbonate, an acidity removal agent, in addition to chitin. The results indicate that the shrimp shell performs best in removing sulfate (99.75%), iron (99.04%), aluminum (98.47%), and manganese (100%) ions. The iron ion sorption kinetics of the sediments were also studied; pseudo-second order behavior was observed. High-throughput sequencing analysis revealed the present bacterial community and its abundance in the microcosms after 11 and 30 treatment days: SRB were detected but were not the majority. Thus, this research aims to contribute to the sustainable treatment MIW through the employment of an abundant and low-cost biomaterial.",Buccal Mucosa Assessed by Ultrasonography in Healthy Adults: Methodology and Determination of Normal Appearance.,https://www.ncbi.nlm.nih.gov/pubmed/30826154,Ultrasound in medicine & biology,2019 05 13,"The aim of the work described here was to compare intra-oral and transcutaneous ultrasonography (US) scanning and to determine the normal values of buccal mucosa thickness and echogenicity. A total of 190 volunteers underwent US examination of the buccal mucosa. The thickness of the buccal epithelial layer was recorded in 19 subjects via both intra-oral and transcutaneous methods. Overall, 171 healthy adults were examined through intra-oral US. Buccal epithelial layer measurement was unreliable via the transcutaneous method (p = 0.001). The mean time required for visualizing the buccal mucosa was 75 and 171s with intra-oral and transcutaneous US, respectively (p < 0.001). The thickness of the buccal epithelial layers significantly differed with age and sex (p < 0.001), and was positively correlated with height, weight and body surface area. Intra-oral US was proposed as a conventional method for examination of the buccal mucosa. Normal buccal epithelial thickness in adults is associated with age, sex, height, weight and body surface area.",Decision Fusion-Based Fetal Ultrasound Image Plane Classification Using Convolutional Neural Networks.,https://www.ncbi.nlm.nih.gov/pubmed/30826153,Ultrasound in medicine & biology,2019 05 13,"Machine learning for ultrasound image analysis and interpretation can be helpful in automated image classification in large-scale retrospective analyses to objectively derive new indicators of abnormal fetal development that are embedded in ultrasound images. Current approaches to automatic classification are limited to the use of either image patches (cropped images) or the global (whole) image. As many fetal organs have similar visual features, cropped images can misclassify certain structures such as the kidneys and abdomen. Also, the whole image does not encode sufficient local information about structures to identify different structures in different locations. Here we propose a method to automatically classify 14 different fetal structures in 2-D fetal ultrasound images by fusing information from both cropped regions of fetal structures and the whole image. Our method trains two feature extractors by fine-tuning pre-trained convolutional neural networks with the whole ultrasound fetal images and the discriminant regions of the fetal structures found in the whole image. The novelty of our method is in integrating the classification decisions made from the global and local features without relying on priors. In addition, our method can use the classification outcome to localize the fetal structures in the image. Our experiments on a data set of 4074 2-D ultrasound images (training: 3109, test: 965) achieved a mean accuracy of 97.05%, mean precision of 76.47% and mean recall of 75.41%. The Cohen κ of 0.72 revealed the highest agreement between the ground truth and the proposed method. The superiority of the proposed method over the other non-fusion-based methods is statistically significant (p < 0.05). We found that our method is capable of predicting images without ultrasound scanner overlays with a mean accuracy of 92%. The proposed method can be leveraged to retrospectively classify any ultrasound images in clinical research."

Since both clinical presentation and radiographic imaging findings, including X-ray and computed tomographic (CT), are nonspecific, the ultimate diagnosis of LYG relies on lung tissue sample diagnosis with its WHO grading based on the degree of cytologic atypia, necrosis and density of EBV positive B-cells. In addition, its histopathologic grading is correlated with clinical manifestation with high grade LYG mimicking aggressive B-cell lymphoma. Discordant grading between pulmonary and cutaneous LYG lesion has have been observed and might be a potential diagnostic and prognostic pitfall.

The 16S rRNA gene sequences of the two strains were identical and showed highest sequence similarities to Lysobacter tolerans UM1T (97.2%) and Luteimonas aestuarii DSM 19680T (96.7 %). The two strains were identical in the sequences of the 16S-23S rRNA internal transcribed spacer (ITS) and partial groEL gene sequences and almost identical in genomic fingerprints. In the ITS sequence Ly. tolerans DSM 28473T and in the groEL nucleotide sequence Luteimonas mephitis DSM 12574T showed the highest similarity. In silico DDH analyses using genome sequence based ANIb and gANI similarity coefficients demonstrated that strain 4284/11T represents a novel species and revealed Ly. tolerans UM1T as the next relative (ANIb = 76.2 %, gANI = 78.0 %). Based on the topology of a core gene phylogeny strain 4284/11T could be assigned to the genus Lysobacter. Chemotaxonomic characteristics including polyamine pattern, quinone system, polar lipid profile and fatty acid profile were in accordance with the characteristics of the genera Lysobacter and Luteimonas.

Based on the high activity and favorable toxicity profile of daratumumab, other CD38 antibodies, such as isatuximab, MOR202, and TAK-079, are being evaluated in MM and other malignancies. The CD38-targeting antibodies have classic Fc-dependent immune effector mechanisms, including antibody-dependent cellular cytotoxicity (ADCC), antibody-dependent cellular phagocytosis (ADCP), and complement-dependent cytotoxicity (CDC). These mechanisms of action are dependent on CD38 expression on the tumor cells. There is increasing evidence that CD38 antibodies also improve host-anti-tumor immune response by eliminating CD38-positive immune suppressor cells, including regulatory T cells, regulatory B cells, and myeloid-derived suppressor cells. Indeed, daratumumab treatment results in a marked increase in T cell numbers and activity. CD38-targeting antibodies probably also reduce adenosine production in the bone marrow microenvironment, which may contribute to improved T cell activity. Preclinical and clinical studies have demonstrated that CD38-targeting antibodies have synergistic activity with several other anti-cancer drugs, including various agents with immune stimulating activity, such as lenalidomide and pomalidomide, as well as PD1/PD-L1 inhibitors."

Controlled wound healing without interference from bacterial contamination appears to be achievable in combination with surface scaffolds for bone- and soft tissue regeneration. As this has not yet been realized, we developed multilayered membranes in this study consisting of specific surface scaffolds for bone- and mucosal regeneration as well as bacteria-tight core membranes. These membranes were evaluated in terms of cell growth of osteoblast- (MG63), keratinocyte- (HaCaT), and fibroblast (L929) cell lines. Scaffolds were fabricated via melt electrospinning writing (MEW), while the core membrane was produced via film casting. All constructs were made of medical-grade poly(ε-caprolactone) (PCL). The bacteria-tightness was tested via a bacterial transmigration-assay. PCL scaffolds and core membranes alone demonstrated good cytocompatibility for all cell lines, which was even enhanced by fusing both components together. The core membrane displayed complete bacteria-tightness over two weeks. These bacteria-tight, individually-designed membranes from medical-grade PCL represent a high-potential, clinically oriented method of GTR in the field of oral- and maxillofacial surgery.","Comprehensive assessment of tranexamic acid during orthognathic surgery: A systematic review and meta-analysis of randomized, controlled trials.",https://www.ncbi.nlm.nih.gov/pubmed/30826112,Journal of cranio-maxillo-facial surgery : official publication of the European Association for Cranio-Maxillo-Facial Surgery,2019 03 31,"The objective of this study was to comprehensively assess the use of tranexamic acid (TXA) during orthognathic surgery.

However, there are few attempts to solve the SDC problem of time-delay DPSs. In this paper, we introduce a SDC for linear time-delay DPSs described by parabolic partial differential equations (PDEs). A SDC design is developed in the formulation of spatial linear matrix inequalities (LMIs) by constructing an appropriate Lyapunov functional, which can stabilize exponentially the time-delay DPSs. This stabilization condition can be applied to either slowing-varying time delay or fast-varying one.

The different data acquisition modes were also tested in non-spiked samples to verify the results obtained in the spiked ones. Importantly, all the methods are able to detect the MS/MS spectrum of several contaminants in the samples when analysed against a database of >600 compounds. Up to 7 contaminants were tentatively detected with IDA, 15 with FSWATH and 17 with VSWATH. Most pollutants were pesticides and pharmaceuticals, being of particular interest the presence of ibuprofen and acetaminophen in mussels.",Use of (meth)acrylamides as alternative monomers in dental adhesive systems.,https://www.ncbi.nlm.nih.gov/pubmed/30826074,Dental materials : official publication of the Academy of Dental Materials,2019 04 16,"Methacrylamides are proposed as components for dental adhesive systems with enhanced resistance to hydrolytic and enzymatic degradation.

A genetically engineered KI mouse model, AQP0ΔC/ΔC, expressing only end-cleaved AQP0 was developed. This model expresses 1-246 amino acids of AQP0, instead of the full length 1-263 amino acids. Lens transparency of postnatal day 10 (P10) was analyzed qualitatively by dark field imaging. WT, AQP0+/- and AQP0+/ΔC lenses were transparent; AQP0-/- and AQP0ΔC/ΔC mouse lenses displayed loss of transparency. Lens fiber cell membrane vesicles (FCMVs) were prepared from wild type (WT), AQP0 heterozygous (AQP0+/-), AQP0 knockout (AQP0-/-), AQP0+/ΔC and AQP0ΔC/ΔC; water permeability (Pf) was measured using the osmotic shrinking method. CTCA assay was performed using adhesion-deficient L-cells and FCMVs prepared from the abovementioned genotypes. FCMVs of AQP0+/- and AQP0-/- showed a statistically significant reduction (P < 0.001) in Pf and CTCA compared to those of WT. AQP0+/ΔC and AQP0ΔC/ΔC FCMVs exhibited no statistically significant alteration (P > 0.05) in Pf compared to those of WT. However, CTCA of AQP0+/ΔC AQP0ΔC/ΔC FCMVs was significantly higher (P < 0.001) than that of WT FCMVs. Our experiments clearly show that C-terminally end-cleaved AQP0 can function both as a water channel and a CTCA molecule in the lens fiber cell membranes. Also, end-truncation plays an important role in increasing the CTCA between fiber cells.",TAT peptide-modified cisplatin-loaded iron oxide nanoparticles for reversing cisplatin-resistant nasopharyngeal carcinoma.,https://www.ncbi.nlm.nih.gov/pubmed/30826059,Biochemical and biophysical research communications,2019 03 26,"As chemo-radiotherapy continues to increase the lifespan of patients with nasopharyngeal carcinoma (NPC), adverse reaction and drug resistance remain two major problems when using cisplatin (CDDP). In this study, we took the lead in designing a dual-mechanism anti-cancer system modified with cell-penetrating peptide on the surface of superparamagnetic iron oxide nanoparticles (SPION) to enhance CDDP delivery efficacy to NPC cells, especially CDDP resistant NPC cells. The combinatorial delivery of CDDP and iron oxide nanoparticles showed an unexpected effect on reversal of CDDP resistance due to the Fenton reaction with an average decrease in the half maximal inhibitory concentration (IC 50) of 85% and 94% in HNE-1/DDP and CNE-2/DDP resistant cells respectively compared to CDDP alone. On this basis, modification with TAT peptide (YGRKKRRQRRR) significantly improved tumor intracellular uptake, devoting to better curative effects and minimized side effects by reducing CDDP therapeutic doses. Furthermore, we specifically labelled CDDP with fluorescence for detection of intracellular nanoparticles uptake and mechanism research through drug tracing. This novel compound provides a promising therapy for reducing chemotherapy side effects and reversing CDDP-resistant nasopharyngeal carcinoma.",VEGF attenuates lung injury by inducing homing of CD133+ progenitors via VEGFR1.,https://www.ncbi.nlm.nih.gov/pubmed/30826058,Biochemical and biophysical research communications,2019 03 26,"Although vascular endothelial growth factor (VEGF) promotes vascular permeability and results in edema, studies have suggested it may protect the lung from inflammatory injury via poorly understood mechanisms. Using a mouse model of extracorporeal circulation (ECC), we found that levels of intravenous VEGF increased in lung tissue and inhibited inflammation, thereby attenuating lung injury. These effects could be obtained by intravenous injection or inhalation of VEGF, and they were abolished by treatment with anti-VEGF antibody. Detailed analyses using immunofluorescence and flow cytometry showed that VEGF increased the homing of CD133+ VEGFR1+ progenitors to lung tissue, and this homing could be mimicked in a dose-dependent manner by treatment with VEGF receptor 1 (VEGFR1) agonist and blocked by treatment with anti-VEGFR1 antibody. Interestingly, we found that exposing pulmonary monocytes in vitro to VEGF did not inhibit ECC-induced inflammation. Our results suggest that VEGF enters lung tissues from the circulation and that it attenuates lung injury not by directly inhibiting release of pro-inflammatory factors but by binding to VEGFR1 to recruit CD133+ progenitors. These progenitors then inhibit local inflammation.",Papaverine identified as an inhibitor of high mobility group box 1/receptor for advanced glycation end-products interaction suppresses high mobility group box 1-mediated inflammatory responses.,https://www.ncbi.nlm.nih.gov/pubmed/30826057,Biochemical and biophysical research communications,2019 03 26,"The interaction of high mobility group box 1 (HMGB1), which is secreted from immune and dying cells during cellular infection and injury, and receptor for advanced glycation end-products (RAGE) appears to be critical for acute and chronic inflammatory disorders. Here we designed a unique cyclic β-hairpin peptide (Pepb2), which mimics the predicted RAGE-binding domain of HMGB1. Pepb2 competitively inhibited HMGB1/RAGE interaction. We then identified papaverine as a Pepb2 mimetic by in silico 3D-structural similarity screening from the DrugBank library. Papaverine was found to directly inhibit HMGB1/RAGE interaction. It also suppressed the HMGB1-mediated production of pro-inflammatory cytokines, IL-6 and TNF-α, in mouse macrophage-like RAW264.7 cells and bone marrow-derived macrophages. In addition, papaverine attenuated mortality in cecal ligation puncture-induced sepsis model mice. Taken together, these findings indicate that papaverine could become a useful therapeutic against HMGB1/RAGE-mediated sepsis and other inflammatory diseases.",Exploring the role of active site Mn2+ ions in the binding of protein phosphatase 5 with its substrate using molecular dynamics simulations.,https://www.ncbi.nlm.nih.gov/pubmed/30826056,Biochemical and biophysical research communications,2019 03 26,"Protein phosphatase 5 (PP5), an important member of serine/threonine protein phosphatases, has been associated with diverse human cancers. Structural data demonstrate that two metal ions and two water molecules are located in the active site of PP5 and are involved in the dephosphorylations of the substrate. Recently, the catalytic reaction of PP5 has been studied by a density functional theory (DFT) method, and the role of the water molecules in regulating the substrate binding of PP5 was explored by our previous molecular dynamics (MD) study. These two studies enrich our understanding of the catalytic mechanism of PP5. However, the questions of how the metal ions regulate the substrate binding and the contribution of each metal ion to the catalysis remain not answered. To this end, the role of the catalytic Mn2+ ions in regulating the binding of PP5 with its substrate was investigated through MD simulations. Results reveal that the different states of Mn2+ ions can alter the structure of the active site and the conformations of the residues coordinating the Mn2+ ions or the substrate. This leads to changes in the secondary structure and dynamical fluctuation of PP5, especially for that of helix αJ. With the position change of helix αJ, the volume of the substrate binding pocket is altered by the different states of Mn2+ ions, indicating the regulatory role of Mn2+ ions in PP5 activity. Furthermore, combined with the simulation data of our previous study, the sequential steps for PP5 binding of the substrate, the two active site water molecules, and the two Mn2+ ions are proposed. This may help to develop new inhibitors to treat the PP5-related cancers.","CDDO-Me, Sulforaphane and tBHQ attenuate the RANKL-induced osteoclast differentiation via activating the NRF2-mediated antioxidant response.",https://www.ncbi.nlm.nih.gov/pubmed/30826055,Biochemical and biophysical research communications,2019 03 29,"Metabolic bone diseases are global public health concerns and are primarily caused by uncontrolled osteoclast (OC) formation and activation. During OC differentiation, intracellular reactive oxygen species (ROS) stimulated by receptor activator of nuclear factor kappa-B ligand (RANKL) can serve as the signaling molecules to promote osteoclastic genes expression. Nuclear factor erythroid-2 related factor 2 (NRF2), a master mediator of cellular antioxidant response, also plays a critical role in OC differentiation through the regulation of redox homeostasis. In this study, we investigated the effects of three NRF2 inducers on osteoclastogenesis, including Bardoxolone methyl (CDDO-Me), Sulforaphane (SFN), and tert-butylhydroquinone (tBHQ). By treating RAW cells with three compounds, we found that NRF2 was activated and its downstream antioxidant genes were upregulated, and the RANKL-induced intracellular ROS production and osteoclastogenesis were impaired. Additionally, the expression of nuclear factor of activated T cells c1 (NFATC1), C-FOS and tumor necrosis factor alpha (TNFα) were inhibited after acute exposures (6 h) to the three compounds. Furthermore, suppressed the expression of osteoclast differentiation-associated genes, tartrate-resistant acid phosphatase (TRAP), cathepsin K (CTSK), matrix metalloproteinase-9 (MMP-9) and dendritic cell-specific transmembrane protein (DC-STAMP) were observed after prolonged exposures (5 days) to the compounds. Taken together, these results suggest that CDDO-Me, SFN and tBHQ attenuate RANKL-induced osteoclastogenesis via activation of NRF2-mediated antioxidant response. Among these compounds, relatively low concentrations of CDDO-Me showed stronger active and inhibitory effects on antioxidant response and osteoclastogenesis, respectively.",miR-222 regulates proliferation of primary mouse hepatocytes in vitro.,https://www.ncbi.nlm.nih.gov/pubmed/30826054,Biochemical and biophysical research communications,2019 03 26,"It is well known that hepatocytes regenerate after liver injury, although it is difficult to reproduce this phenomenon in vitro. The goal of this research was to determine the factors that stimulate proliferation of primary mouse hepatocytes (PMHs) in vitro. We first tested knockdown (KD) of tumor protein 53 (p53) alone as well as partial hepatectomy (PH, performed 72 h prior to PMHs preparation) alone. However, neither intervention stimulated hepatocyte proliferation during the 72-h observation period in vitro. We then tested the combination of p53 KD with PH and found that these interventions together stimulated cell proliferation in vitro. Under these latter conditions we analyzed gene expression of these cells by mRNA sequencing (RNA-seq) and microRNA sequencing (miRNA-seq). TargetScan analysis, which determines the relationship between microRNAs and gene expression, found a relationship between downregulated mmu-mir-222 (miR-222) and upregulated genes such as mitogen-activated protein kinase kinase kinase 2 (Map3k2). To confirm this relationship, we performed miR-222 KD and overexpression (OE) and observed the expected changes in target gene expression. Furthermore, the finding that miR-222 KD or OE stimulates or suppresses, respectively, hepatocyte proliferation is well explained by the association between miR-222 and its target genes, which stimulate growth. Our results suggest that miR-222 is one of the key factors regulating PMH proliferation in vitro.",Estrogen induces estrogen receptor α expression and hepatocyte proliferation in late pregnancy.,https://www.ncbi.nlm.nih.gov/pubmed/30826053,Biochemical and biophysical research communications,2019 03 26,"Partial hepatectomy (PH) induces estradiol production, and then hepatocyte proliferation. Estradiol may play a role in triggering hepatocyte proliferation after PH. In this study, estradiol was injected to the Estrogen Receptor alpha (ERα) or ERβ KO mice. No increased hepatocyte proliferation was observed in ERα KO mice, indicates that ERα is involved in estradiol-induced hepatocyte proliferation. The ERα and ERβ KO mice are sterile, hence it is impossible to study ERα and ERβ function during pregnancy when the estrogen levels are highest. Using conditional mutagenesis technique, we made ERα hepatocyte KO mice, which are fertile. We used these mice for analyzing the hepatocyte ERα function during pregnancy. However, in the control mice, the maternal hepatocyte was proliferated higher in late pregnancy, but no pregnancy-induced hepatocyte proliferation was observed in KO mice. Hence, we conclude that the maternal hepatocyte ERα is involved in estradiol-induced hepatocyte proliferation in late pregnancy.",Usefulness of Clopidogrel Loading in Patients Who Underwent Transcatheter Aortic Valve Implantation (from the BRAVO-3 Randomized Trial).,https://www.ncbi.nlm.nih.gov/pubmed/30826050,The American journal of cardiology,2019 04 08,"P2Y12-inhibitor initiation with clopidogrel using a loading dose (LD) versus no LD (NLD) provides more rapid inhibition of platelet activation and reduced risk of ischemic events after coronary stenting. Whether a similar beneficial effect is achieved in the setting of transcatheter aortic valve implantation (TAVI) is unknown. We evaluate the effects of preprocedural clopidogrel LD versus no NLD on 48-hour and 30-day clinical outcomes after TAVI. In the BRAVO-3 trial, 802 patients with severe aortic stenosis who underwent transfemoral TAVI were randomized to intraprocedural anticoagulation with bivalirudin or unfractionated heparin. Administration of clopidogrel LD was left to the discretion of the treating physician. For this analysis, patients were stratified according to receiving clopidogrel LD (n = 294, 36.6%) or NLD (n = 508, 63.4%) before TAVI. LD patients more often received a self-expandable prosthesis using larger sheaths. P2Y12-inhibitor maintenance therapy pre-TAVI was similar in patients with LD versus NLD (28.2% vs 33.1%, p = 0.16). LD versus NLD was associated with similar incidences of major adverse cardiovascular events (i e., death, myocardial infarction, or stroke) (4.1% vs 4.1%, p = 0.97) and major bleeding (8.5% vs 7.7%, p = 0.68), but a higher rate of major vascular complications (11.9% vs 7.1%, p = 0.02). Multivariable adjustment showed that clopidogrel LD did not affect any of the studied clinical events, including major vascular complications (odds ratio 0.91, 95% confidence interval 0.60 to 1.39, p = 0.67). Also patients on clopidogrel maintenance therapy and thus considered in steady state were not at reduced risk of major adverse cardiovascular events compared with patients not on clopidogrel (3.7% vs 5.2%, p = 0.36). In conclusion, in patients who underwent TAVI, use of clopidogrel LD was associated with higher vascular complications and otherwise similar clinical events compared to NLD patients.",Trends in Readmission and Costs After Transcatheter Implantation Versus Surgical Aortic Valve Replacement in Patients With Renal Dysfunction.,https://www.ncbi.nlm.nih.gov/pubmed/30826049,The American journal of cardiology,2019 04 08,"Patients with renal dysfunction are at increased risk for developing aortic valve pathology. In the present era of value-based healthcare delivery, a comparison of transcatheter and surgical aortic valve replacement (SAVR) readmission performance in this population is warranted. All adult patients who underwent transcatheter or SAVR from 2011 to 2014 were identified using the Nationwide Readmissions Database, containing data for nearly 50% of US hospitalizations. Patients were further stratified as chronic kidney disease stage 1 to 5 as well as end-stage renal disease requiring dialysis. Kaplan-Meier, Cox Hazard, and multivariable regression models were generated to identify predictors of readmission and costs. Of the 350,609 isolated aortic valve replacements, 4.7% of patients suffered from chronic kidney disease stages 1 to 5 or end-stage renal disease. Transcatheter aortic valve patients with chronic kidney disease stages 1 to 5/or end-stage renal disease were older (81.9 vs 72.9 years, p <0.0001) with a higher prevalence of heart failure (15.2 vs 4.3%, p = 0.04), and peripheral vascular disease (31.1 vs 22.8%, p <0.0001) compared to their SAVR counterparts. Transcatheter aortic valve replacement in chronic kidney disease stage 1 to 3 patients had a higher rate of readmission due to heart failure and pacemaker placement than SAVR. Transcatheter aortic valve replacement was associated with increased costs compared with SAVR for all renal failure patients. In conclusion, in this national cohort of chronic and end-stage renal disease patients, transcatheter aortic valve implantation was associated with increased mortality, readmissions for chronic kidney disease stages1 to 3, and index hospitalization costs."

How toll-like receptor 2 (TLR2) signalling regulates the generation of Th17 cells upon alloantigen stimuli remains unclear. In this study, we used a mouse model of cardiac allograft transplantation to investigate whether TLR2 signalling influences the development of Th17 cells. Here, we demonstrate that the TLR2-deficient recipient mice show high Th17 cells, both in spleens and allografts, as well as higher infiltrating inflammatory leukocytes in cardiac allografts compared to wild-type control recipient mice. mRNA expression of IL-17, IL-6, TNF-α, CCR6 and CCL20 within the allografts is markedly increased in TLR2-deficient recipient mice compared to wild-type recipient mice. In addition, TLR2 deficiency leads to upregulation of Signal transducer and activator of transcription 3 (STAT3) phosphorylation in both spleens and allografts. In an in vitro experiment, a mixed lymphocyte reaction was assessed, which further confirmed that TLR2 deficiency leads to a significant increase in the generation of Th17 cells compared with wild-type controls. Furthermore, IL-6 secreted by the dendritic cells of TLR2-deficient mice contributes to driving the generation of these Th17 cells. These results suggest that TLR2 signalling is important in regulating the development of Th17 cells after cardiac allograft transplantation.",The effect of the Great Recession on the demand for general oral health care and orthodontic care.,https://www.ncbi.nlm.nih.gov/pubmed/30826000,Journal of the American Dental Association (1939),2019 03 29,This study was undertaken to quantify how the Great Recession impacted the demand for general oral health care and orthodontic care in the United States.

Surgical considerations and literature review.,https://www.ncbi.nlm.nih.gov/pubmed/30825998,Annales d'endocrinologie,2019 04 20,"The authors reported 2 cases of functioning gonadotroph pituitary adenoma (FGPA) revealed by an ovarian hyperstimulation syndrome (OHSS) in young women. In the first case, OHSS was observed after GnRH analog injection. Pelvic echography revealed multiple voluminous ovarian cysts. Dopamine agonist posology failed in estradiol hypersecretion control, which necessitated endoscopic endonasal transsphenoidal surgery. The patient experienced improvement in pelvic pain as estradiol hypersecretion decreased during the first few postoperative days. Outcome was favorable, and her menstrual cycle was normal after two months. The second case was a young girl with spontaneous pelvic pain and elevated plasma FSH and estradiol levels. FGPA was confirmed on cerebral MRI. Dopamine agonists were introduced, and surgical removal of the pituitary tumor was scheduled for 7 days later. In the meantime, the patient was admitted and underwent surgery for bilateral adnexal torsion related to OHSS. The pituitary tumor was removed one week later. Outcome was favorable, and estradiol and FSH plasma levels were normal after 3 months. The ovarian cysts were no longer visible on echography after 3 months. Given the lack of efficacy of the current standard medical therapy, surgical removal of pituitary adenomas is the reference treatment for FGPA. The authors suggest that severe OHSS related to FGPA should be considered as a relative surgical emergency and that surgery should not be unduly delayed, given the unpredictable risk of adnexal torsion, particularly in case of voluminous ovarian cysts.

The south coast of South Africa boasts an exceptional record of coastal hunter-gatherer occupation spanning the Holocene, the last glacial cycle and beyond. The significance of coastal adaptations, in this region in particular, for later modern human evolution has been prominently debated. Shellfishing behaviors are an important focus for investigation given the dietary and scheduling implications and the abundant archaeological shell remains in numerous sites. Key to better understanding coastal foraging is whether it was limited to one particular season, or year-round. Yet, this has proven very difficult to establish by conventional archaeological methods. This study reconstructs seasonal harvesting patterns by calculating water temperatures from the final growth increment of shells. Results from two Later Stone Age sites, Nelson Bay Cave (together with the nearby Hoffman's Robberg Cave) and Byneskranskop 1, show a pronounced cool season signal, which is unexpected given previous ethnographic documentation of summer as the optimal season for shellfishing activities and inferences about hunter-gatherer scheduling and mobility in the late Holocene. Results from two Middle Stone Age sites, Klasies River and Pinnacle Point 5-6, show distinct seasonal patterns that likely reflect the seasonal availability of resources in the two locations. The Pinnacle Point 5-6 assemblage, which spans the MIS5-4 transition, records a marked shift in shellfishing seasonality at c. 71 ka that aligns with other indications of archaeological and environmental change at this time. We conclude that the scheduling and intensity of shellfishing in this region is affected by a suite of factors, including environmental and cultural drivers, rather than a single variable, such as population growth.",MRI visibility of gold fiducial markers for image-guided radiotherapy of rectal cancer.,https://www.ncbi.nlm.nih.gov/pubmed/30825976,Radiotherapy and oncology : journal of the European Society for Therapeutic Radiology and Oncology,2019 03 03,"A GTV boost is suggested to result in higher complete response rates in rectal cancer patients, which is attractive for organ preservation.

Advancements in antiretroviral therapy include the availability of well tolerated, single tablet regimens that are associated with a lower risk of drug-drug interactions. Despite this, many people living with HIV infection might be taking antiretroviral agents that are associated with significant drug-drug interactions. Because HIV infection itself is associated with cardiovascular complications and this population is living longer, concomitant use of antiretrovirals and medications to treat cardiovascular-related diseases is often required. For this reason, it is imperative that clinicians are aware of the potential for clinically significant drug-drug interactions between antiretroviral agents and cardiac medications as well as the useful HIV drug interaction resources that might provide guidance. Available data on significant interactions are summarized and suggested guidance regarding management is discussed.",Mechanisms of Arrhythmia and Sudden Cardiac Death in Patients With HIV Infection.,https://www.ncbi.nlm.nih.gov/pubmed/30825952,The Canadian journal of cardiology,2019 03 03,"Long-term survival of HIV-infected patients has significantly improved with the use of antiretroviral therapy (ART). As a consequence, cardiovascular diseases are now emerging as an important clinical problem in this population. Sudden cardiac death is the third leading cause of mortality in HIV patients. Twenty percent of patients with HIV who died of sudden cardiac death had previous cardiac arrhythmias including ventricular tachycardia, atrial fibrillation, and other unspecified rhythm disorders. This review presents a summary of HIV-related arrhythmias, associated risk factors specific to the HIV population, and underlying mechanisms. Compared with the general population, patients with HIV have several cardiac conditions and electrophysiological abnormalities. As a result, they have an increased risk of developing severe arrhythmias, that can lead to sudden cardiac death. Possible explanations may be related to non-ART polypharmacy, electrolyte imbalances, and use of substances observed in HIV-infected patients; many of these conditions are associated with alterations in cardiac electrical activity, increasing the risk of arrhythmia and sudden cardiac death. However, clinical and experimental evidence has also revealed that cardiac arrhythmias occur in HIV-infected patients, even in the absence of drugs. This indicates that HIV itself can change the electrophysiological properties of the heart profoundly and cause cardiac arrhythmias and related sudden cardiac death. The current knowledge of the underlying mechanisms, as well as the emerging role of inflammation in these arrhythmias, are discussed here.",Pulmonary Hypertension in HIV.,https://www.ncbi.nlm.nih.gov/pubmed/30825951,The Canadian journal of cardiology,2019 03 03,"Human immunodeficiency virus-associated pulmonary arterial hypertension (HIV-PAH) is important to recognize given its association with significant morbidity and mortality. With the introduction of antiretroviral therapy, the focus of disease management has largely shifted from treating immunodeficiency-related opportunistic infections to managing chronic cardiopulmonary complications. Symptoms are nonspecific, and a high index of clinical suspicion is needed to avoid significant delay in the diagnosis of HIV-PAH. Although several viral proteins have been implicated in the pathogenesis of HIV-PAH, the exact mechanism remains uncertain. Further studies are needed to elucidate precise pathogenic mechanisms, early diagnostic tools, and novel therapeutic targets to improve prognosis of this severe complication.",Stroke in HIV.,https://www.ncbi.nlm.nih.gov/pubmed/30825950,The Canadian journal of cardiology,2019 03 07,"Stroke is a heterogeneous disease in persons living with human immunodeficiency virus (HIV). HIV is thought to increase the risk of stroke through both HIV-related and traditional stroke risk factors, which vary with respect to the patient's age and clinical characteristics. Numerous studies show that detectable viremia and immunosuppression increase the risk of stroke across all ages, whereas traditional risk factors are more common in the aging population with HIV. As persons living with HIV age and acquire traditional stroke risk factors, the prevalence of stroke will likely continue to increase. Large- and small-vessel disease are the most common causes of stroke, although it is important to evaluate for infectious etiology as well. Research regarding the management of stroke in patients with HIV is scant, and recommendations often parallel those for the general population. Treatment of HIV and effective reduction of traditional stroke risk factors is important to reduce the risk of stroke in persons living with HIV. Future research will help elucidate the pathophysiology of HIV and stroke risk, investigate sex differences in stroke risk, and evaluate the safety and benefits of standard stroke preventative measures and HIV-specific interventions in this population.","Coronary Artery Disease Manifestations in HIV: What, How, and Why.",https://www.ncbi.nlm.nih.gov/pubmed/30825949,The Canadian journal of cardiology,2019 03 03,"Understanding why persons with human immunodeficiency virus (HIV) have accelerated atherosclerosis and its sequelae, including coronary artery disease (CAD) and myocardial infarction, is necessary to provide appropriate care to a large and aging population with HIV. In this review, we delineate the diverse pathophysiologies underlying HIV-associated CAD and discuss how these are implicated in the clinical manifestations of CAD among persons with HIV. Several factors contribute to HIV-associated CAD, with chronic inflammation and immune activation likely representing the primary drivers. Increased monocyte activation, inflammation, and hyperlipidemia present in chronic HIV infection also mirror the pathophysiology of plaque rupture. Furthermore, mechanisms central to plaque erosion, such as activation of toll-like receptor 2 and formation of neutrophil extracellular traps, are also abundant in HIV. In addition to inflammation and immune activation in general, persons with HIV have a higher prevalence than uninfected persons of traditional cardiovascular risk factors, including dyslipidemia, hypertension, insulin resistance, and tobacco use. Antiretroviral therapies, although clearly necessary for HIV treatment and survival, have had varied effects on CAD, but newer generation regimens have reduced cardiovascular toxicities. From a clinical standpoint, this mix of risk factors is implicated in earlier CAD among persons with HIV than uninfected persons; whether the distribution and underlying plaque content of CAD for persons with HIV differs considerably from uninfected persons has not been definitively studied. Furthermore, the role of cardiovascular risk estimators in HIV remains unclear, as does the role of traditional and emerging therapies; no trials of CAD therapies powered to detect clinical events have been completed among persons with HIV.",Noninvasive Cardiovascular Imaging: Emergence of a Powerful Tool for Early Identification of Cardiovascular Risk in People Living With HIV.,https://www.ncbi.nlm.nih.gov/pubmed/30825948,The Canadian journal of cardiology,2019 03 03,"Antiretroviral therapy (ART) has been pivotal in prolonging the lifespan of people living with HIV (PLWH). However, this also simultaneously increases their risk of cardiovascular disease (CVD) either related to ART, aging, hypertension, immunosenescence, inflammation, immune activation, or other comorbidities. Although the use of risk markers has greatly enhanced the field of cardiovascular (CV) medicine and improved the prognosis and early diagnosis in the general population, this strategy has not been clearly elucidated in PLWH. Developing accurate risk algorithms for PLWH requires an innate understanding of mechanistic factors influencing their risks. Early identification of CV risk will significantly enhance the prospects of PLWH living longer and relatively healthily. Herein, we discuss the use of multimodality noninvasive CV imaging as robust markers for ameliorating CV risk. The ability to prognosticate CV risk and hence prevent CV events in PLWH would represent an important advance in CV medicine, allowing precise detection and early institution of preventative strategies. Using novel CV imaging modalities and strategies would have a positive impact on precision medicine in this patient cohort.",Mechanisms of Cardiovascular Disease in the Setting of HIV Infection.,https://www.ncbi.nlm.nih.gov/pubmed/30825947,The Canadian journal of cardiology,2019 03 03,"Although the initial reports of increased cardiovascular (CV) disease in the setting of advanced AIDS were reported approximately 30 years ago, advances in antiretroviral therapy and immediate initiation of therapy on diagnosis have transformed what was once a deadly infectious disease into a chronic health condition. Accordingly, the types of CV diseases occurring in HIV have shifted from pericardial effusions and dilated cardiomyopathy to atherosclerosis and heart failure. The underlying pathophysiology of HIV-associated CV disease remains poorly understood, partly because of the rapidly evolving nature of HIV treatment and because clinical endpoints take many years to develop. The gut plays an important role in the early pathogenesis of HIV infection as HIV preferentially infects CD4+ T cells, 80% of which are located in gut mucosa. The loss of these T cells damages gut mucosa resulting in increased gut permeability and microbial translocation, which incites chronic inflammation and immune activation. Antiretroviral therapy does not cure HIV infection and immune abnormalities persist. These abnormalities correlate with mortality and CV events. The effects of antiretroviral therapy on CV risk are complex; treatment reduces inflammation and other markers of CV risk but induces lipid abnormalities, most commonly hypertriglyceridemia. On a molecular level, monocytes/macrophages, platelet reactivity, and immune cell activation, which play a role in the general population, may be heightened in the setting of HIV and contribute to HIV-associated atherosclerosis. Chronic inflammation represents an inviting therapeutic target in HIV, as it does in uninfected persons with atherosclerosis."

AT1-AA's administered to pregnant rodents produces a well-accepted model of PE. However, the role of NK cells and mitochondrial reactive oxygen species (mtROS) in AT1-AA mediated hypertension during pregnancy is unknown. We hypothesize that AT1-AA induced model of PE will exhibit elevated MAP, NK cells, and mtROS; while inhibition of the AT1-AA binding to the AT1R would be preventative. Pregnant rats were divided into 4 groups: normal pregnant (NP) (n = 5), NP + AT1-AA inhibitory peptide (NP +'n7AAc') (n = 3), NP + AT1-AA infused (NP + AT1-AA) (n = 10), and NP + AT1-AA +'n7AAc' (n = 8). Day 13, rats were surgically implanted with mini-pumps infusing either AT1-AA or AT1-AA +'n7AAc'. Day 19, tissue and blood was collected. MAP was elevated in AT1-AA vs. NP (119 ± 1 vs. 102 ± 2 mmHg, p < 0.05) and this was prevented by 'n7AAc' (108 ± 3). There was a 6 fold increase in renal activated NK cells in AT1-AA vs NP (1.2 ± 0.4 vs. 0.2 ± 0.1% Gated, p = 0.05) which returned to NP levels in AT1-AA +'n7AAc' (0.1 ± 0.1% Gated).

NT-DSCs reduced sFlt1 expression at D8 to 0.25 [0.17-0.49] (p = 0.0021) compared to 0.31 [0.25-0.82] (p = 0.087) in PE-DSCs. These results show that, when induced to decidualize, PE-DSCs fail to increase expression of decidualization markers to levels achieved by NT-DSCs. sFlt1 expression is higher in PE-DSCs during decidualization, suggesting inadequate suppression during the crucial implantation period. These defects at the maternal fetal interface may lead to the failed spiral artery modification, decreased placental invasion of the uterus, and elevated circulating sFlt1 levels seen in PE pathology.",Preeclampsia and risk of developing bronchopulmonary dysplasia in very preterm neonates.,https://www.ncbi.nlm.nih.gov/pubmed/30825928,Pregnancy hypertension,2019 04 09,"Bronchopulmonary dysplasia (BPD) is a severe common complication of preterm birth with considerable short and long-term consequences.

External validation of the model is required before implementation for clinical use. We assessed the temporal and external validity of the fullPIERS model in high income settings using five cohorts collected between 2003 and 2016, from tertiary hospitals in Canada, the United States of America, Finland and the United Kingdom. The cohorts were grouped into three datasets for assessing the primary external, and temporal validity, and broader transportability of the model. The predicted risks of developing an adverse maternal outcome were calculated using the model equation and model performance was evaluated based on discrimination, calibration, and stratification. Our study included a total of 2429 women, with an adverse maternal outcome rate of 6.7%, 6.6%, and 7.0% in the primary external, temporal, and combined (broader) validation cohorts, respectively. The model had good discrimination in all datasets: 0.81 (95%CI 0.75-0.86), 0.82 (95%CI 0.76-0.87), and 0.75 (95%CI 0.71-0.80) for the primary external, temporal, and broader validation datasets, respectively. Calibration was best for the temporal cohort but poor in the broader validation dataset. The likelihood ratios estimated to rule in adverse maternal outcomes were high at a cut-off of ≥30% in all datasets.

Preeclamptic women and children born from preeclamptic pregnancies are at greater risk to develop severe cardiovascular complications and metabolic syndromes later in life. The incidence of preeclampsia is estimated to be seven times higher in developing countries as compared to the developed countries. This review summarizes the pathophysiology of preeclampsia, emerging new hypothesis of its origin, risk factors that make women susceptible to developing preeclampsia and the potential of various biomarkers being studied to predict preeclampsia. The health care of developing countries is continuously challenged by substantial burden of maternal and fetal mortality. India despite being a fast developing country, is still far behind in achieving the required maternal mortality rates as per Millennium Development Goals set by the World Health Organization. Further, this review discusses the prevalence of preeclampsia in India, health facilities to manage preeclampsia, current guidelines and protocols followed and government policies to combat this complication in Indian condition."

However, the capacity of this species to act as reservoir of animal tuberculosis (TB) poses a threat to other wildlife and to livestock. Diagnostic assay accuracy in this species is therefore highly relevant for prevention and control measures. Our aim was to evaluate the diagnostic performance of the protein complex P22, obtained from Mycobacterium bovis derived purified protein derivative (bPPD), as a candidate antigen for the detection of antibodies against Mycobacterium tuberculosis complex (MTC). We assessed the performance of this new antigen in indirect enzyme-linked immunosorbent assays (ELISA) in TB-positive and TB-negative red deer, in comparison with a bPPD-based ELISA. The P22 ELISA achieved a higher specificity (Sp) and similar sensitivity (Se) in comparison with the bPPD ELISA at all the cut-off points considered. The P22 ELISA yielded optimal Sp (99.02%; 95% confidence intervals [CI95%]: 96.5-99.8) and appropriate Se (70.1%; CI95%: 63.6-76) at the selected cut-off point of 100%.

Disease characteristics could be breed or family related; some breeds of dogs, particularly the Cavalier King Charles spaniels, develop MMVD at an early age. The purpose of this study was to retrospectively characterize MMVD in the miniature poodle, a commonly affected breed in which MMVD has not been well characterized. Thirty-two miniature poodles met the inclusion criteria. Mean age was 11±three years. Clinical signs included exercise intolerance, syncope and coughing. Eighteen dogs were classified as ACVIM Stage B1, 12 as stage B2, and two as stage C. Mean vertebral heart scale (VHS) was 10.2 (±standard deviation of 0.9); 15 of 28 dogs had a VHS <10.3. One dog had radiographic evidence of congestive heart failure. Mean diastolic left ventricle dimension normalized to body weight was 1.6 (±0.4) and mean systolic was 0.8 (±0.3). Mitral valve prolapse was subjectively classified as mild or moderate in 19 dogs and severe in two. In the miniature poodles reported here, MMVD appears to be a fairly late onset disease and often is a mild phenotype."

Fifty-one horses referred for poor performance and/or respiratory signs and for which a BALF was collected from both lungs, were included in the study. Cytology of pooled and individual BALF samples were performed using a masked protocol. Based on clinical signs and individual BALF cytologies, horses were classified as control (CTL), mild equine asthma (mEA), severe equine asthma (sEA) and/or exercise-induced pulmonary haemorrhage (EIPH). No significant difference was observed between pooled and individual BALF samples for all cell types (P>0.05). Correlations between pooled and individual BALF samples were good (r≥0.9) for neutrophil proportions and haemosiderophages/macrophages ratio, and moderate (r≥0.4) for metachromatic cell and eosinophil proportions. Similarly, intraclass correlation coefficient (ICC) were good (ICC≥0.9) for neutrophil proportions and haemosiderophages/macrophages ratio and substantial (ICC≥0.6) for metachromatic cell proportions.

Ropivacaine 0.75% at 1.5mg/kg was injected in each case. Dogs were monitored during the surgical procedure, and rescue analgesia was administered whenever the heart rate, respiratory rate or blood pressure increased more than 20% from the basal values. Success rate was defined as no need for rescue analgesia during surgery and complete blockade of the operated leg evaluated just after anaesthesia recovery. Complications were also recorded. Data was analysed using Fisher exact and Mann/Whitney tests. Success rate was observed in 14/16 (87%) dogs and in 12/16 (75%) dogs in the US and N groups, respectively (P=0.65). Complications recorded were hypotension in three cases (US group, n=1; N group, n=2) and Horner's syndrome in three cases (US group, n=1; N group, n=2; P=0.65).

All dogs were followed up after 6 and 12 months to verify survival. Heart-fatty acid binding protein concentrations were significantly higher in dogs with MVD and DCM than controls at initial presentation, and after 1 month in dogs with MVD. For dogs with DCM, a significant reduction in HFABP levels over time was observed. Comparing ACVIM stages, highest HFABP concentrations were detected in ACVIM stage C dogs compared to stage B, with the lowest levels seen in controls, and a reduction over time in stage C dogs was present. Similarly, cTnI concentrations were higher in DCM and stage C in comparison to control dogs and reduced over time, while NTproBNP concentrations were only higher in diseased dogs at 1 month. Heart-fatty acid binding protein and cTnI levels at initial presentation and ACVIM disease stage were independent predictors of survival in a univariate analysis. The elevation of HFABP in dogs with MVD and DCM in comparison to controls, its association with disease severity, and its potential in predicting reduced survival, suggest that HFABP might be useful as marker for canine MVD and DCM.","Influence of age, group size and the presence of porcine reproductive and respiratory syndrome virus on the collection of oral fluids.",https://www.ncbi.nlm.nih.gov/pubmed/30825888,"Veterinary journal (London, England : 1997)",2019 03 21,"Pen-based oral fluid (OF) samples have been approved for detecting porcine reproductive and respiratory syndrome virus (PRRSV) RNA and antibodies.

However, the mechanisms involved in the development of rotator cuff tendinopathy pain are not fully understood. In this study, we first examined the histological features of subacromial bursa from patients with rotator cuff tendinopathy who had symptoms of pain, and investigated the expression of pain mediators, proinflammatory cytokines, metalloproteinases, growth factors, and alarmins in diseased tendon and bursa tissue by real-time PCR, western blot, and/or immunohistochemistry/immunofluorescence staining. Then we investigated whether epigallocatechin-3-gallate (EGCG) could reduce the expression of pain mediators and proinflammatory cytokines in human primary bursa cells and explored the paracrine effect of these EGCG-treated bursa cells on tenocytes in vitro. Neovascularization and infiltration of immune cells including monocytes/macrophages and mast cells were observed in diseased bursa tissue. Bursa from patients with pain had higher mRNA expression of pain mediators and proinflammatory cytokines, compared to the rotator cuff tendon of the same patients, as well as the bursa from asymptomatic patients. EGCG treatment significantly suppressed the interleukin 1 beta (IL-1β)-induced elevation of mRNA expression of pain mediators, proinflammatory cytokines, and matrix metalloproteinases (MMPs) in bursa cells in vitro; conditioned medium from EGCG-treated bursa cells significantly reduced IL-1β-induced expression in human primary tenocytes. Our study suggests that the subacromial bursa might serve as a local source of pain mediators and proinflammatory cytokines in rotator cuff tendinopathy. Moreover, EGCG treatment by primarily targeting the subacromial bursa may be a potential strategy to relieve rotator cuff tendinopathy-related pain and symptoms.",Progressive stenosis and radiological findings of vasculitis over the entire internal carotid artery in moyamoya vasculopathy associated with graves' disease: a case report and review of the literature.,https://www.ncbi.nlm.nih.gov/pubmed/30825882,BMC neurology,2019 04 08,"Moyamoya vasculopathy (MMV) associated with Graves' disease (GD) is a rare condition resulting in ischemic stroke accompanied by thyrotoxicity.

In this study, an ultraviolet differential optical absorption spectrometry (UV-DOAS) platform for detecting the concentration of SO2, H2S and CS2 mixed gases was established and a quantitatively detecting method was proposed. Firstly, the concentration of SO2 was calculated by the spectrum data at 300 nm band. Then the gas mixture spectra of H2S and CS2 at 200 nm band were obtained after linear deduction of SO2 spectrum. By wavelet extraction and fourier transform, the spectral information of H2S and CS2 was separated and the concentrations of the two gases were calculated. The method can detect the concentrations of SO2 (1-20 ppm), H2S (1-20 ppm) and CS2 (0.01-2 ppm) ternary gas mixture and the detection limits of SO2, H2S and CS2 are 0.44 ppm, 0.49 ppm and 3.23 ppb. This method has good detection sensitivity and high detection precision, which is suitable for the on-line monitoring of SF6 gas insulated equipment.","Characterization of Eocene fossil resin from Moravia, Czech Republic: Insights into macromolecular structure.",https://www.ncbi.nlm.nih.gov/pubmed/30825865,"Spectrochimica acta. Part A, Molecular and biomolecular spectroscopy",2019 03 29,"Two pieces of studlovite - Eocene amber from Študlov (Southeast Moravia, Czech Republic) were investigated. To arrive at a more detailed description, attenuated total reflection Fourier transform infrared spectroscopy, Raman spectroscopy, pyrolysis-gas chromatography/mass spectrometry, and gas chromatography-mass spectrometry were used. Both studlovite samples revealed signs of the same plant source, with higher polymerisation and a higher degree of maturation of the fossilized matter. Despite their close spectral resemblance, they differed in their detailed chemical composition, and in structure. Layering of one of the pieces studied showed how the resin was built and what impact the process had on the chemical composition of the amber. Characterization of the organic matter was completed with an analysis of trace elements in amber samples using scanning electron microscope combined with elemental distribution analysis (SEM/EDAX). The results demonstrated the paleoenvironmental conditions that occurred in the plant during resin exudation following wounding.",Spectral and thermochemical research of the DNA polyplex with chitosan formation process and the influence of anionic and cationic compounds.,https://www.ncbi.nlm.nih.gov/pubmed/30825864,"Spectrochimica acta. Part A, Molecular and biomolecular spectroscopy",2019 05 13,"In this paper, the results of a spectral and thermochemical study of the DNA polyplex formation with chitosan and the effect of ethidium bromide polyplexes, sodium dodecyl sulfate, n-octyltrimethyl ammonium bromide, poly(4-styrenesulfonic acid), and heparin on the stability of the complexes are considered. It has been established that chitosan forms thermodynamically stable complexes with ethidium bromide (EtBr), in which there exists one monomer unit of chitosan for two ethidium bromide ones. The interaction of ethidium bromide with chitosan leads to a charge exchange of the polymer surface. The impact of chitosan on the intercalated DNA-EtBr complex conditions a release of EtBr with a polyplex formation. The process of polyplex formation in the presence of ethidium bromide proceeds endothermically, and in its absence the reaction is exothermic. The polyplex particles formed from DNA after release of EtBr are larger and have a smaller charge, as compared to the polyplex particles obtained without ethidium bromide. It has been found that anionic compounds cause the degradation of polyplexes, and it can prove to be a significant obstacle for using chitosan polyplexes in transfection, since in the presence of heparin in the bloodstream, the complexes will break down before reaching the target.",Identification of a unique VUV photoabsorption band of carbonic acid for its identification in radiation and thermally processed water-carbon dioxide ices.,https://www.ncbi.nlm.nih.gov/pubmed/30825863,"Spectrochimica acta. Part A, Molecular and biomolecular spectroscopy",2019 03 29,"Carbonic acid was synthesized within an ice containing water and carbon dioxide by irradiation of ~9 eV photons. Vacuum UltraViolet (VUV)/UltraViolet (UV) photoabsorption spectra of the irradiated ice revealed absorption features from carbon dioxide, ozone, water, carbon monoxide and oxygen in addition to a band peaking at ~200 nm which is identified to be characteristic of carbonic acid. After thermal processing of the irradiated ice leading to desorption of the lower volatile ices, a pure carbonic acid spectrum is identified starting from 170 K until sublimation above 230 K. Therefore the ~200 nm band in the VUV region corresponding to carbonic acid is proposed to be a unique identifier in mixed ices, rich in water and carbon dioxide typically encountered on planetary and satellite surfaces.","NLOphoric benzyl substituted BODIPY and BOPHY: A comprehensive linear and nonlinear optical study by spectroscopic, DFT and Z-scan measurement.",https://www.ncbi.nlm.nih.gov/pubmed/30825862,"Spectrochimica acta. Part A, Molecular and biomolecular spectroscopy",2019 03 29,"BOPHY (BPY) and BODIPY (BDY) dye bearing benzyl group (Bn) at 4,4' and 2,6 position respectively were synthesized and characterized. The fluorescence decay measurements were performed which reveal that benzyl BOPHY (Bn-BPY) has shorter fluorescence lifetime compared to benzyl BODIPY (Bn-BDY). The difference in transition dipole moment is found to be 6.93 and 11.3 D for Bn-BDY and Bn-BPY respectively in toluene. The molecular electrostatic potential (MEP) plot shows Bn-BDY is more polarised compared to Bn-BPY. The nonlinear optical (NLO) property was evaluated using Z-scan measurement. The molecular electronic arrangement of Bn-BPY significantly affects the nonlinear absorption properties resulting into reverse saturable absorption (nonlinear absorption coefficient β = 0.256 × 10-11 m/W). In contrast, the Bn-BDY displays saturable absorption character.

We use two methods that arrive at a similar conclusion, but with different implications. Using school distance from the nearest federal highway to instrument for restaurant location, we find the surrounding restaurants to only marginally affect a student's BMI measure. The effect size also decreases with increasing radial distances from school, 0.016 standard deviations at one-third of a mile and 0.0032 standard deviations at a mile radial distance. This indicates the decreasing influence of restaurants on a child's BMI as its distance from school increases. On a subset of students who were exogenously assigned to different school food environment, we find no effect of the fast food restaurants. An important contextual aspect is that nearly all schools in this sample observed closed campus policy, which does not allow students to leave campus during lunch hours.",Tacrolimus-induced severe headache associated with diffuse leukoencephalopathy: Evidence for an immune-mediated pathogenesis.,https://www.ncbi.nlm.nih.gov/pubmed/30825860,Journal of neuroimmunology,2019 04 01,"Tacrolimus-induced encephalopathy presents with acute neurological symptoms such as headache, seizures, visual disturbances, hemiplegia, and altered mental status.

Our review of the literature revealed that brief, computer-based PFIs can improve pain outcomes and decrease problematic alcohol consumption. Future research would likely benefit from developing integrated, computer-based PFIs for pain and alcohol misuse.

Here, we show that the sites of constriction, i.e., the sites of future abscission, are initially formed at the ends of the intercellular bridge during early midbody stage, and that these sites are associated with the non-muscle myosin-IIB (not myosin-IIA), actin filaments, and septin 9 until abscission. The ESCRT-III component CHMP4B localizes to the midbody and ""spreads"" to the site of abscission only during late midbody stage. Strikingly, inhibition of myosin-II motor activity by a low dose of Blebbistatin completely abolishes the formation of the constriction sites, resulting in the localization of all the above-mentioned components to the midbody region. These data strongly suggest that a secondary actomyosin ring provides the primary driving force for the thinning of the intercellular bridge to allow ESCRT-mediated membrane fission.",Neutron+Gamma response of undoped and Dy doped MgB4O7 thermoluminescence dosimeter.,https://www.ncbi.nlm.nih.gov/pubmed/30825838,"Applied radiation and isotopes : including data, instrumentation and methods for use in agriculture, industry and medicine",2019 05 22,Thermoluminescence properties of undoped and Dy doped MgB4O7 compounds were studied with the irradiation of 252Cf source.

In this paper, we propose an algorithm that identifies a single radioisotope and multiple radioisotopes from the gamma spectrum of a plastic scintillator using an artificial neural network. The spectra were simulated using Monte Carlo N-Particle Transport Code 6 to formulate the training set, and the spectra were measured by a two-inch EJ-200 to create the test set (1440 spectra in total). The ANN-based algorithm presented here ensures an identification accuracy of 98.9% for a single radioisotope and 99.1% for multiple radioisotopes. Even if the spectra were intentionally shifted by 36 keV for low and high energies, the trained ANN predicts radioisotopes with high accuracy. In addition, we have determined the minimal required number of detected counts to identify the radioisotope with 5% false negative and false positive.","The interdependence of attention, working memory and gaze control: behavior and neural circuitry.",https://www.ncbi.nlm.nih.gov/pubmed/30825836,Current opinion in psychology,2019 05 21,"Visual attention, visual working memory, and gaze control are basic functions that all select a subset of visual input to guide immediate or subsequent behavior.

The 0.21 mM ClO4- added in the first stage of operation was completely reduced in 28 days, 0.40 mM ClO4- was reduced within 23 days in stage 2, and 0.56 mM of ClO4- was reduced within 30 days in stage 3. Although some chlorate (ClO3-) accumulated, the recovery of Cl- was over 92%. Illumina sequencing of the 16S rRNA gene documented that the bacterial community was mainly composed by perchlorate-reducing bacteria (PRB), methanotrophic bacteria, and archaea. Real-time quantitative PCR showed the archaeal 16S rRNA and mcrA genes increased as more ClO4- was reduced, and the predominant archaea belonged to Methanosarcina mazei, which is related to ANME-3, an archaeon able to perform reverse methanogenesis. Several pieces of evidence support that ClO4- reduction by the MBBR biofilm occurred via a synergism between Methanosarcina and PRB: Methanosarcina oxidized methane through reverse methanogesis and provided electron donor for PRB to reduce ClO4-. Because methanotrophs were present, we cannot rule out that they also were involved in AnMO-PR if they received O2 generated by disproportionation of ClO2- from the PRB.",Evidence of transport of styrene oligomers originated from polystyrene plastic to oceans by runoff.,https://www.ncbi.nlm.nih.gov/pubmed/30825822,The Science of the total environment,2019 03 22,"This study demonstrates for the first time that styrene oligomers (SOs), which are indicators of polystyrene (PS) plastic contamination in the environment, are transported from land to the ocean. Samples of sand and seawater were taken from the coastline of the Tokyo Bay over the past four years, and all samples of both sand and seawater were found to contain SOs such as styrene monomer (SM), styrene dimers (SD), and styrene trimers (ST), with the concentration distributions of these being in the order of ST > SD > SM. The concentrations of these SOs are linearly proportional to monthly precipitation. These results indicate that various land-based SOs sources are connected with the estuary, a substantial amount of which are transported into Tokyo Bay through runoff as overland flow. As a result, runoff by precipitation is a potential transport pathway of land-based SOs sources. This finding is of interest in terms of both the extent of PS plastic pollution and the transport of SOs to the ocean.

In this study, four bioreactors, including a sequencing batch biofilm reactor (SBBR), a stirred-tank reactor (STR) and two submerged aeration reactors (SAR) were used to treat secondary effluent from a recycled paper mill respectively. The results indicated that chemical oxygen demand (COD) was increased by SAR2 treatment and COD removal efficiency for SBBR, SAR1 and STR was 39.7%, 15.7% and 30.9% respectively. It is suggested that recalcitrant compounds were removed by SBBR, SAR1 and STR respectively. Total nitrogen (TN) and total phosphorus (TP) of wastewater were increased by treatments of each bioreactor, which suggested that endogenous respiration of biomass occurred during the treatment. Microbial analysis of sludge from different bioreactors suggested that the removal of recalcitrant compounds in SBBR and STR might be related to the presence of unique microorganisms in each reactor.",Biogenic habitat shifts under long-term ocean acidification show nonlinear community responses and unbalanced functions of associated invertebrates.,https://www.ncbi.nlm.nih.gov/pubmed/30825820,The Science of the total environment,2019 04 16,"Experiments have shown that increasing dissolved CO2 concentrations (i.e. Ocean Acidification, OA) in marine ecosystems may act as nutrient for primary producers (e.g. fleshy algae) or a stressor for calcifying species (e.g., coralline algae, corals, molluscs). For the first time, rapid habitat dominance shifts and altered competitive replacement from a reef-forming to a non-reef-forming biogenic habitat were documented over one-year exposure to low pH/high CO2 through a transplant experiment off Vulcano Island CO2 seeps (NE Sicily, Italy). Ocean acidification decreased vermetid reefs complexity via a reduction in the reef-building species density, boosted canopy macroalgae and led to changes in composition, structure and functional diversity of the associated benthic assemblages. OA effects on invertebrate richness and abundance were nonlinear, being maximal at intermediate complexity levels of vermetid reefs and canopy forming algae. Abundance of higher order consumers (e.g. carnivores, suspension feeders) decreased under elevated CO2 levels. Herbivores were non-linearly related to OA conditions, with increasing competitive release only of minor intertidal grazers (e.g. amphipods) under elevated CO2 levels. Our results support the dual role of CO2 (as a stressor and as a resource) in disrupting the state of rocky shore communities, and raise specific concerns about the future of intertidal reef ecosystem under increasing CO2 emissions. We contribute to inform predictions of the complex and nonlinear community effects of OA on biogenic habitats, but at the same time encourage the use of multiple natural CO2 gradients in providing quantitative data on changing community responses to long-term CO2 exposure.",The tea leaf microbiome shows specific responses to chemical pesticides and biocontrol applications.,https://www.ncbi.nlm.nih.gov/pubmed/30825819,The Science of the total environment,2019 04 16,"The plant microbiome is known to be influenced by certain biotic as well as abiotic factors. Nevertheless, the drivers for specific changes in microbial community composition and structure are largely unknown. In the present study, the effects of chemical and biological treatments for plant protection on the indigenous microbiome of Camellia sinensis (L.) Kuntze were contrasted. Assessment of bacteria-specific ribosomal RNA gene fragment amplicons from a representative set of samples showed an increased microbial diversity in treated plants when compared to untreated samples. Moreover, distinct microbial fingerprints were found for plants subjected to a conventional pesticide treatment with lime sulfur as well as for plants that were biologically treated with a Piriformospora indica spore solution. The bacterial community of pesticide-treated plants was augmented by 11 taxa assigned to Proteobacteria and Actinobacteria. In contrast, plants from biological control treatments were augmented by 10 taxa representing a more diversified community enrichment and included members of Actionobacteria, Proteobacteria, Bacteroidetes, Planctomycetes, and Verrucomicrobia. Complementary, molecular quantification of fungi in the samples showed a significantly lower number of internal transcribed spacer copies in plants subjected to biological control treatments, indicating the highest efficiency against fungal pathogens. The overall results show that leaves that are used for tea production show distinct microbiome shifts that are elicited by common pest and pathogen management practices. These shifts in the microbial population indicate non-target effects of the applied treatments.","Is plant survival on green roofs related to their drought response, water use or climate of origin?",https://www.ncbi.nlm.nih.gov/pubmed/30825818,The Science of the total environment,2019 04 16,"Green roofs are novel urban ecosystems with shallow substrate depths and low water availability. Hence, it is critical to select green roof plants that can survive water-deficits, particularly in climates with hot and dry summers. Shrubs are perennial plants which can be drought resistant and may be suitable for green roofs. However, studies about survival and health of shrubs are limited. The aim of this study was to determine whether plant climate of origin aridity, drought response and water use strategies could be used to select shrubs which can survive on green roofs that experience water-deficit. We selected 15 shrub species from a range of climates (dry, mesic and wet) and planted them together in 20 replicate green roof modules with 130 mm deep substrate. We monitored substrate water contents, plant minimum water potentials (ψmin), health (visual score), percentage survival and related survival with their turgor loss point (ψtlp) and water use strategies (evapotranspiration rates in a related glasshouse experiment). We also determined whether plants could recover after dry periods by rewatering after the summer. Mean gravimetric soil water content decreased to approximately 5% after summer drought, which resulted in mortality. Overall, survival ranged between 10% and 100% for the 15 species. However, survival was not related to their ψtlp or water use strategies. While shrubs from more arid climates had lower ψmin in response to dry substrates, this did not result in greater survival and health. Following rewatering, only four shrub species resprouted. Hence, as plant drought response, water use strategy and climate of origin were not strongly related to survival, we suggest survival on green roofs is likely to be determined by a combination of physiological traits. Emergency irrigation for shrubs growing on green roofs in hot and dry climates is recommended during summer to keep them alive.",Modelling the effects of climate change on the distribution of benthic indicator species in the Eastern Mediterranean Sea.,https://www.ncbi.nlm.nih.gov/pubmed/30825817,The Science of the total environment,2019 04 16,"The potential effects of climate change on the distribution of benthic species commonly used in marine ecological quality assessment were investigated using a spatial modelling approach. In this work, the relevance of the ecological groups that macrofaunal molluscs are assigned according to their sensitivity or tolerance to environmental disturbance was examined under the scope of the RCP 8.5 severe emissions scenario. The effects of climate change were more profound on species that are indicative of a specific suite of climatic conditions regarding temperature and salinity. Significant loss of habitat suitability was observed for the tolerant species Corbula gibba and Abra prismatica whereas the sensitive species Moerella donacina was least affected. In contrast, an overall expansion of the distributional potential was observed for the sensitive species Flexopecten hyalinus as newly suitable habitats are formed. As hypothesised, the current ecological grouping that depicts the sensitivity of a benthic species to an environmental stressor is irrelevant when assessing the effects of climate change. We propose a new standpoint of using benthic species as biotic tools based on their ecological niche requirements.","Typhoons increase the abundance of microplastics in the marine environment and cultured organisms: A case study in Sanggou Bay, China.",https://www.ncbi.nlm.nih.gov/pubmed/30825816,The Science of the total environment,2019 04 16,"Microplastic contamination in the ocean has emerged as an environmental issue of global importance.

The majority of microplastics in seawater, sediments, and oysters collected before the typhoons could be grouped into sizes of 0.1-0.5 mm (36.7%), 0.05-0.1 mm (42.6%), and 0.1-0.5 mm (47.1%), respectively. After the typhoons, the most abundant size classes of microplastics in the three environmental compartments were 0.05-0.1 mm (39.2%) for seawater, 0.1-0.5 mm (37.1%) for sediments, and 0.05-0.1 mm (29.9%) for oysters. The typhoons also altered color distribution of microplastics and increased the proportions of polypropylene, polystyrene, and polyethylene terephthalate in seawater. Scanning electron microscopy/energy dispersive spectroscopy showed that organic matter and heavy metals were present on the microplastics collected from oysters. Our results suggest that weather conditions should be considered when investigating marine microplastics.",Neurodevelopmental correlates of the emerging adult self.,https://www.ncbi.nlm.nih.gov/pubmed/30825815,Developmental cognitive neuroscience,2019 05 21,"The self-concept - the set of beliefs that a person has about themselves - shows significant development from adolescence to early adulthood, in parallel with brain development over the same period. We sought to investigate how age-related changes in self-appraisal processes corresponded with brain network segregation and integration in healthy adolescents and young adults. We scanned 88 participants (46 female), aged from 15 to 25 years, as they performed a self-appraisal task. We first examined their patterns of activation to self-appraisal, and replicated prior reports of reduced dorsomedial prefrontal cortex activation with older age, with similar reductions in precuneus, right anterior insula/operculum, and a region extending from thalamus to striatum. We used independent component analysis to identify distinct anterior and posterior components of the default mode network (DMN), which were associated with the self-appraisal and rest-fixation parts of the task, respectively. Increasing age was associated with reduced functional connectivity between the two components. Finally, analyses of task-evoked interactions between pairs of nodes within the DMN identified a subnetwork that demonstrated reduced connectivity with increasing age. Decreased network integration within the DMN appears to be an important higher-order maturational process supporting the emerging adult self.",Binding Interaction of Juglone with Lysozyme: Spectroscopic Studies Aided by In Silico Calculations.,https://www.ncbi.nlm.nih.gov/pubmed/30825814,"Journal of photochemistry and photobiology. B, Biology",2019 03 29,"Binding interactions between the drug Juglone (JUG) and Lysozyme (LYZ) have been explored in details from spectroscopic studies aided by in silico calculations. UV-Vis, steady state and time resolved fluorescence spectroscopic studies indicate the formation of LYZ-JUG complex in the ground state. Quenching of corrected fluorescence spectra of LYZ in presence of JUG at varied concentrations in different temperature range have been estimated from Stern-Volmer (SV) plots. Time resolved fluorescence spectroscopic studies confirm the mechanism of quenching to be of static type. Binding constant associated with the LYZ-JUG complex has been estimated from Scatchard plot. The number of binding sites, thermodynamic parameters and the modes of interaction are also estimated. Synchronous fluorescence spectra monitored at two discrete wavelength windows confirm the prominent role of Tryptophan residues towards quenching of fluorescence in LYZ. The circular dichroism (CD) spectra signify alterations in the population of α-helical content within the secondary structure of LYZ in presence of JUG molecules. REES of LYZ in the presence of JUG further signify definite impact of the drug JUG molecule on the Trp residues of the protein. The experimental observations are supported by in silico molecular docking and molecular dynamics simulations."

Recently, the co-administration of tramadol (TMD) with SDF to manage premature ejaculation has illegally increased and thus drug-drug interaction studies of these drugs became of great importance. Although certain biological functions have been altered upon co-administration of the two drugs, methods for their determination in vivo to understand their interactions have yet to be published. Herein, therefore, an HPLC method with photometric detection was developed for the determination of a binary mixture of TMD and SDF in rabbit plasma after oral administration. In this study, a reversed-phase chromatography was performed at room temperature on a C18 column with a mobile phase composed of 10 mM Na2HPO4 solution (pH 7.5): acetonitrile (45:55, v/v) at a flow rate of 0.8 mL min-1 using caffeine (CAF) as an internal standard.

We combined proximity ligation assays (PLA) for IR and IGF-IR, a technique that detects close protein-protein interactions, with immunocytochemistry for brain cell markers to identify IR/IGF-IR hybrids in the major types of brain cells. Intriguingly, while all the types of brain cells analyzed co-express both receptors, only neurons, astroglia, and microglia show readily detectable IR/IGF-IR hybrids. Hybrid PLA signal was negligible in brain endothelial cells and was absent in oligodendrocytes. Hybrids were comparatively more abundant in neurons and peaked after brain development was completed.

Geographic distribution of wild pigs in the United States has nearly tripled since 1982, with anthropogenic influences playing a significant role in the expansion. In this regard, there is speculation that a driver of the expansion may be human-mediated movement of wild pigs to new areas for the purpose of sport hunting. In response, states have implemented a variety of wild pig control policies, including legal restrictions on their transport. The success of such policies depends, in part, on their level of public support, which in turn may be influenced by individuals' attitudes concerning wild pigs, their interest in maintaining wild pig populations (e.g., for sport hunting), and their knowledge and awareness of the threats wild pigs pose. Multiple regression was used to analyze data collected from a nationwide survey concerning attitudes toward wild pigs and policies that restrict their transport. Results indicate that a majority of individuals in the United States have negative attitudes toward wild pigs and support policies that restrict their transport and penalize transgressors. Consistent with other invasive species research, findings suggest that as knowledge and awareness of wild pigs increase, so too does support for policies restricting and penalizing transport of wild pigs. Contrary to previous studies, this research also finds that hunters are more likely to support restrictions on wild pig transport than are non-hunters. Overall, these findings suggest that legal restrictions on the transport of wild pigs, even in states with large hunter populations, enjoy broad public support and may help to curb the expansion of wild pig populations.",Spatial pattern analysis and prediction of forest fire using new machine learning approach of Multivariate Adaptive Regression Splines and Differential Flower Pollination optimization: A case study at Lao Cai province (Viet Nam).,https://www.ncbi.nlm.nih.gov/pubmed/30825780,Journal of environmental management,2019 03 26,"Understanding spatial patterns of forest fire is of key important for fire danger management and ecological implication. This aim of this study was to propose a new machine learning methodology for analyzing and predicting spatial patterns of forest fire danger with a case study of tropical forest fire at Lao Cai province (Vietnam). For this purpose, a Geographical Information System (GIS) database for the study area was established, including ten influencing factors (slope, aspect, elevation, land use, distance to road, normalized difference vegetation index, rainfall, temperature, wind speed, and humidity) and 257 fire locations. The relevance level of these factors with the forest fire was analyzed and assessed using the Mutual Information algorithm. Then, a new hybrid artificial intelligence model named as MARS-DFP, which was Multivariate Adaptive Regression Splines (MARS) optimized by Differential Flower Pollination (DFP), was proposed and used construct forest fire model for generating spatial patterns of forest fire. MARS is employed to build the forest fire model for generalizing a classification boundary that distinguishes fire and non-fire areas, whereas DFP, a metaheuristic approach, was utilized to optimize the model. Finally, global prediction performance of the model was assessed using Area Under the curve (AUC), Classification Accuracy Rate (CAR), Wilcoxon signed-rank test, and various statistical indices. The result demonstrated that the predictive performance of the MARS-DFP model was high (AUC = 0.91 and CAR = 86.57%) and better to those of other benchmark methods, Backpropagation Artificial Neural Network, Adaptive neuro fuzzy inference system, Radial Basis Function Neural Network.

There are several environmental mishaps due to coal ash spills around the world and in the United States. Management of CFA-polluted sites has proven inefficient resulting in soil infiltration, leaching, and phytotoxicity. This study assessed the mitigation strategies for CFA-induced phytotoxicity using biological [arbuscular mycorrhizal fungi (AMF)] and chemical [exogenous glutathione (GSH)] agents. Indices of phytotoxicity include seed germination, plant morphometrics, lipid peroxidation and genomic double-stranded DNA (dsDNA) in switchgrass plant (Panicum virgatum). Experiments include laboratory screening (0, 5, 10, 15 and 20% w/w CFA/soil) and greenhouse pot study (0, 7.5 and 15% w/w CFA/soil) culturing switchgrass plant in Armour silt loam soil co-applied with AMF (Rhizophagus clarus) and GSH. Experiments showed that CFA exposure caused a concentration-dependent increase in seed germination. 10% CFA increased seedling growth while 15 and 20% CFA decreased seedling growth and induced leaf chlorosis. Furthermore, CFA (7.5 and 15%) in the 90-d pot study significantly (p < 0.05) impaired plant growth, induced lipid peroxidation and reduced genomic dsDNA. However, the incorporation of AMF or GSH enhanced seed germination, plant growth, and/or genomic dsDNA, reduced lipid peroxidation and prevented leaf chlorosis in CFA-exposed switchgrass plant. This study demonstrates that AMF and GSH have the potential to mitigate CFA-induced phytotoxicity. These biological and chemical strategies could be further harnessed for efficient utilization of switchgrass plant in the phytoremediation of CFA contaminated soil environment while simultaneously limiting CFA-induced phytotoxicity.",Treatment of printing ink wastewater using electrocoagulation.,https://www.ncbi.nlm.nih.gov/pubmed/30825777,Journal of environmental management,2019 03 26,"The present study investigates the treatment of real printing ink wastewater by using the electrocoagulation (EC) process. Effects of initial chemical oxygen demand (COD) concentrations, electrode materials and current densities were examined to determine the maximum COD and color removal from the wastewater. In parallel, raw and treated printing ink wastewater toxic potential was further estimated via the application of toxicity tests using the freshwater crustacean Thamnocephalus platyurus for assessing EC process efficiency. According to the results, it was observed that the EC is efficient under most of the operating conditions used, as COD and color removal ranged between 72.03 to 85.81% and 98.7-100%, respectively. The total cost of the EC process, considering the treatment time, applied current, applied voltage and the total anode electrode mass consumption was also estimated. The Fe electrode proved to be of lower cost than the Al electrode, however the use of Al electrode produced better decolorization results in the solutions. Moreover, toxicity tests currently performed with the use of larvae of the fairy shrimp Thamnocephalus platyurus revealed a substantial decrease in the toxic potential of printing ink wastewater, thus indicating the efficiency of the proposed EC process.",Neuronal-like response of N2a living cells to nanoporous patterns of thin supported anodic alumina.,https://www.ncbi.nlm.nih.gov/pubmed/30825776,"Colloids and surfaces. B, Biointerfaces",2019 05 22,"We report about the response of N2a cells, a mouse neuroblastoma cell line, cultured on inert substrates with controlled porous nanostructure. The substrate surfaces were obtained by anodization and post-fabrication etching of thin aluminum films previously deposited onto glass. The morphology of the adherent cells was assessed by scanning electron microscopy. After fluorescent labelling, confocal microscopy was used to assess both the cell density, by cell nuclei counting, and their growth, by characterizing the neurite extensions in both number and length. By comparing with flat and smooth aluminum oxide, we can conclude that the nanoporous morphology of the anodized aluminum is favorable for cell development, which is probably correlated with the high density of regions with high local curvature. The intermediate pore size in the given range seems unfavorable for the number of cells, while the cell shape and the number of extensions point to a dominating differentiation of the N2a cells in correspondence with a characteristic pore size of 60 nm.

The nanorods were then dispersed in MBG sol, followed by impregnation with sponge and in situ gelation. After sinter treatment, the sponge template was removed to offer interconnected macroporous structure, while the intercross-linked MBG nanorods afford meso- and micro- pores. The resulting scaffolds presented a 2-fold reinforcement in compressive strength (1.03 MPa) which is matchable to that of cancellous bone. When their mesopore size was tuned to 7.38 nm, the scaffolds enabled an optimal protein adsorption capacity and sustainable release property. Upon 3-day incubation in simulated body fluid, the scaffolds with macro/meso/micro porous structure present more needle-like hydroxyapatites, indicating their promoted biomineralization capacity.

Inflammatory activation of macrophages has been linked with metabolic reprogramming from oxidative phosphorylation to aerobic glycolysis. In contrast to mouse macrophages, little information is available on the link between metabolism and inflammation in human macrophages. In the current report it is demonstrated that lipopolysaccharide (LPS)-activated human peripheral blood monocyte-derived macrophages (hMDMs) fail to undergo metabolic reprogramming towards glycolysis, but rely on oxidative phosphorylation for the generation of ATP. By contrast, activation by LPS led to an increased extracellular acidification rate (glycolysis) and decreased oxygen consumption rate (oxidative phosphorylation) in mouse bone marrow-derived macrophages (mBMDMs). Mitochondrial bioenergetics after LPS stimulation in human macrophages was unchanged, but was markedly impaired in mouse macrophages. Furthermore, treatment with 2-deoxyglucose, an inhibitor of glycolysis, led to cell death in mouse, but not in human macrophages. Finally, glycolysis appeared to be critical for LPS-mediated induction of the anti-inflammatory cytokine interleukin-10 in both human and mouse macrophages. In summary, these findings indicate that LPS-induced immunometabolism in human macrophages is different to that observed in mouse macrophages.",O2 affects mitochondrial functionality ex vivo.,https://www.ncbi.nlm.nih.gov/pubmed/30825773,Redox biology,2019 05 31,"Mitochondria have originated in eukaryotic cells by endosymbiosis of a specialized prokaryote approximately 2 billion years ago.

We have generated cardiomyocyte-specific Grx1-roGFP2 GSH redox potential (EGSH) biosensor mice in the past, in which the sensor is targeted to the mitochondrial matrix. Using this mouse model a distinct EGSH of the mitochondrial matrix (-278.9 ± 0.4 mV) in isolated cardiomyocytes is observed. When analyzing the EGSH in isolated mitochondria from the transgenic hearts, however, the EGSH in the mitochondrial matrix is significantly oxidized (-247.7 ± 8.7 mV). This is prevented by adding N-Ethylmaleimide during the mitochondria isolation procedure, which precludes disulfide bond formation. A similar reducing effect is observed by isolating mitochondria in hypoxic (0.1-3% O2) conditions that mimics mitochondrial pO2 levels in cellulo. The reduced EGSH is accompanied by lower ROS production, reduced complex III activity but increased ATP levels produced at baseline and after stimulation with succinate/ADP. Altogether, we demonstrate that oxygenation is an essential factor that needs to be considered when analyzing mitochondrial function ex vivo.",A retrospective study of poisoning deaths from forensic autopsy cases in northeast China (Liaoning).,https://www.ncbi.nlm.nih.gov/pubmed/30825772,Journal of forensic and legal medicine,2019 03 26,"Acute poisoning is a public health threat that leads to morbidity and mortality worldwide.

This paper argues that taking an embodied approach to biographical disruption helps to explain the concept's enduring efficacy. Drawing on the work of Maurice Merleau-Ponty and contemporary theories of embodiment inspired by his phenomenology, this paper advances that biographical disruption involves, in the first instance, a disruption to the ability to enact an embodied orientation towards the world. Biographical disruption does not, from this perspective, result from illness as such, but from the ways that illness impinges on one's physical ability to engage with daily life. This paper examines the experiences of solid organ transplant recipients for the purpose of shedding light on the conditions under which biographical disruption arises in experience. The analysis includes interviews with 36 post-operative solid organ transplant recipients (heart, liver, lung, and kidney) living in British Columbia or Ontario, Canada. These participants exhibit a wide range of illness experiences, some of which manifest as biographical disruption and others that do not. Tracing the contours of these experiences, this paper argues that the efficacy of biographical disruption for describing the illness experience depends not only on the illness experience but also, fundamentally, on the content of embodiment prior to the onset of that experience.",Complications Associated With Placement of Chest Tubes: A Trauma System Perspective.,https://www.ncbi.nlm.nih.gov/pubmed/30825758,The Journal of surgical research,2019 04 29,"The insertion of a chest tube is a common procedure in trauma care, and the Advanced Trauma Life Support program teaches the insertion of chest tubes as an essential and life-saving skill.

In some marine areas, like the Baltic Sea, there is a large number of wrecks from the first half of the 20th century, and recent monitoring and field work have revealed release of oil from some of these wrecks. The risk posed by a wreck is governed by its condition, hazardous substances contained in the wreck and the state of the surrounding environment. Therefore, there is a need for a common standard method for estimating the risks associated with different wrecks. In this work a state-of-the-art model is presented for spatial and stochastic risk assessment of oil spills from wrecks, enabling a structured approach to include the complex factors affecting the risk values. A unique feature of this model is its specific focus on uncertainty, facilitating probabilistic calculation of the total risk as the integral expected sum of many possible consequences. A case study is performed in Kattegat at the entrance region to the Baltic Sea to map the risk from a wreck near Sweden. The developed model can be used for oil spill risk assessment in the marine environment all over the world."

The products were calcined at 500 °C for use as a deicing corrosion inhibitor, which breaks through the problem that the traditional corrosion inhibitor itself doesn't have the capability of deicing. The raw material of Al and Fe was extracted from the red mud by acid leaching. Characterization by XRD, FTIR, BET, XPS, SEM and TEM revealed that the interlaminar structure of the collapsed double-layered hydroxide material after high temperature calcination was regained by adsorbing Cl-. Cl- was filled between the layers of double hydroxide and existed by chemical adsorption. By measuring the freezing point of mixed deicing salt and the ability to melt snow and deicing, the freezing point of the inhibitor was found. When the solution concentration was 40 wt%, the freezing point of the mixed deicing salt reached -27.6 °C. Corrosion inhibitors can reduce the amount of CaCl2 when used in combination with anhydrous CaCl2. In addition, the determination of the corrosion rate of carbon steel and the resistance to salt freezing of concrete has revealed that the corrosion inhibitor can adsorb Cl- and reduce the content of free Cl- at low temperatures. Therefore, corrosion inhibitor plays a significant role in reducing the amount of Cl- used, the corrosion rate of carbon steel, and the salt-freezing resistance of concrete.","Physiological effects of gamma irradiation in the honeybee, Apis mellifera.",https://www.ncbi.nlm.nih.gov/pubmed/30825738,Ecotoxicology and environmental safety,2019 05 07,"Terrestrial ecosystems are exposed to various kinds of pollutants, including radionuclides. The honeybee, Apis mellifera, is commonly used in ecotoxicology as a model species for evaluating the effects of pollutants. In the present study, honeybees were irradiated right after birth for 14 days with gamma rays at dose rates ranging between 4.38 × 10-3 and 588 mGy/d. Biological tissues (head, intestine and abdomen) were sampled at D3, D10 and D14. Ten different physiological markers involved in nervous (acetylcholinesterase (AChE)), antioxidative (catalase (CAT), superoxide dismutase (SOD), glutathione peroxidase (GPx) and glutathione-S-transferase (GST)), immune system (phenoloxidase (PO)) and metabolism (carboxylesterases (CaEs) and alkaline phosphatase (ALP)) were measured. Univariate analyses were conducted to determine whether each individual biomarker response was positively or negatively correlated with the dose rate. Then, multivariate analyses were applied to investigate the relationships between all the biomarker responses. Although no mortality occurred during the experiment, several biomarkers varied significantly in relation to the dose rate. Globally, the biomarkers of antioxidant and immune systems decreased as the dose rate increased. Reversible effects on the indicator of the neural system were found. Concerning indicators of metabolism (carboxylesterases), variations occurred but no clear pattern was found. Taken altogether, these results help better understand the effects of ionizing radiation on bees by identifying relevant physiological markers of effects.

In this study, the response of Arthrobacter QD 15-4 to DMP was investigated. The results showed that the growth of Arthrobacter QD 15-4 was not impacted by DMP and Arthrobacter QD 15-4 could degrade DMP. RNA-Seq and RT-qPCR results showed that DMP treatment caused some changes in the expression of key genes in Arthrobacter QD 15-4. The transcriptional expressions of pstSCAB and phoU were downregulated by DMP. The transcriptional expressions of potACD, gluBC, oppAB, pdhAB, aceAF, gltA were upregulated by DMP. The genes are mainly involved in regulating energy metabolism and ATP-binding cassette (ABC) transporters. The increasing of pyruvic acid and citrate in Arthrobacter QD 15-4 further supported the energy metabolism was improved by DMP. It was clearly shown that Arthrobacter QD 15-4 made response to dimethyl phthalate by regulating energy metabolism and ABC transporters.","Estimate annual and seasonal PM1, PM2.5 and PM10 concentrations using land use regression model.",https://www.ncbi.nlm.nih.gov/pubmed/30825736,Ecotoxicology and environmental safety,2019 05 07,"Exposure to ambient particulate matter (PM) can increase mortality and morbidity in urban area. In this study, annual and seasonal spatial pattern of PM1, PM2.5 and PM10 pollutants were assessed using land use regression (LUR) models in Sabzevar, Iran. The studied pollutants were measured at 26 monitoring stations of different microenvironments in the study area. Sampling was conducted during four campaigns from April 2017 to February 2018. LUR models were developed based on 104 potentially predictive variables (PPVs) subdivided in six categories and 22 sub-categories. The annual mean (standard deviation) of PM1, PM2.5 and PM10 were 36.46 (8.56), 39.62 (10.55) and 51.99 (16.25) μg/m3, respectively. The R2 values and root mean square error for leave-one-out cross validations (RMSE for LOOCV) of PM1 models ranged from 0.23 to 0.79 and 3.43-22.5, respectively. Further, R2 and RMSE for LOOCV of PM2.5 models ranged from 0.56 to 0.93 and 3.66-28.3, respectively. For PM10 models the R2 ranged from 0.31 to 0.82 and the RMSE for LOOCV ranged from 9.16 to 33.9. The generated models can be useful for population based epidemiologic studies and to estimate these pollutants in different parts of the study area for scientific decision making.","Disinfection and removal performance for Escherichia coli, toxic heavy metals and arsenic by wood vinegar-modified zeolite.",https://www.ncbi.nlm.nih.gov/pubmed/30825735,Ecotoxicology and environmental safety,2019 05 07,"Zeolite has traditionally been used to remediate wastewater and soil. The present study shows a new method for natural zeolite (NZ) modification with wood vinegar (WV). The optimal conditions for NZ modification with WV were determined, and the adsorption capacities towards lead (Pb), cadmium (Cd) and arsenic (As), antimicrobial activities against Escherichia coli, heavy metal(loid) fraction and characterizations of selected modified zeolites (MZs) were also investigated. The results indicate that 50-fold dilution of WV, 5 g of NZ dosage, 105 °C of drying temperature, 4 h and 95 °C of water bath are preferred for NZ modification with WV. The WV+NaOH-MZ exhibited the best performance in heavy metal removal and the most powerful antimicrobial activity among all the zeolites. The sequence of WV+NaOH-MZ for the maximum single metal(loid) adsorption capacities was Pb (48.67 mg/g) >Cd (23.67 mg/g) > As (0.024 mg/g). The WV+NaOH and WV modifications also can increase the stabilities of heavy metals in the MZs. The residual fractions of single Pb and Cd in WV+NaOH-MZ and WV-MZ were 50%, 55%, 34% and 30%, respectively. The pore size of WV+NaOH-MZ (11.73 nm) was bigger than that of NZ or WV-MZ. Additionally, the proportion of clinoptilolite in WV+NaOH-MZ was also higher than other zeolites. The surfaces of WV+alkali-MZs were rougher than that of NZ. Considering the low cost and environmental risk of WV, this work provides some useful information for management of agricultural and industrial residues, environment and food safety.",Influence of biochar particle size on biota responses.,https://www.ncbi.nlm.nih.gov/pubmed/30825734,Ecotoxicology and environmental safety,2019 05 07,"Despite the increasing interest for biochar as a soil amendment, a knowledge gap remains on its impacts on non-target soil and aquatic species. We hypothesised that biochar particle size and application rate can play a role in the toxicity to biota. Pine woodchip biochar was incorporated in a clean soil at three particle size classes: small (<0.5 mm), medium (1-2 mm), and large (<4 mm), and at two concentrations: 1% and 6% w/w. A laboratory screening with earthworm Eisenia andrei avoidance behaviour bioassay was carried out to test the most adequate application rates, particle sizes and soil-biochar pre-incubation period. Thereafter, a 28-day greenhouse microcosm experiment was conducted as an ecologically more representative approach. Survival, vertical distribution and weight changes of E. andrei, and bait-lamina consumption were recorded. Soil leachates from the microcosms were collected to evaluate their impact on Daphnia magna immobilisation and Vibrio fischeri (Microtox®) bioluminescence. A feeding experiment with E. andrei was also performed to address earthworm weight changes and to conduct a screening of PAH-type metabolites in their tissue. The 6% <0.5 mm treatment pre-incubated for 96 h induced significant avoidance of the earthworms. Significantly lower bait-lamina consumption was observed in microcosms for the 6% <0.5 mm treatment. Moreover, particle size was a statistically significant factor regarding the loss of weight in the feeding experiment and higher concentration of naphthalene-type metabolites detected in E. andrei tissue, when exposed to <0.5 mm biochar particles. The leachates had no adverse effects on the aquatic species. The results suggest that particles <0.5 mm of pine woodchip biochar can pose sub-lethal effects on soil biota.",Just how bad does it have to be?

Mussels were fed daily with microalgae previously exposed for 24 h to 10 μg/L of PVP/PEI coated 5 nm Ag NPs. After 21 days, mussels significantly accumulated Ag in both seasons and Ag NPs were found within digestive gland cells and gills. Two-dimensional electrophoresis distinguished 104 differentially expressed protein spots in autumn and 142 in spring. Among them, chitinase like protein-3, partial and glyceraldehyde-3-phosphate dehydrogenase, that are involved in amino sugar and nucleotide sugar metabolism, carbon metabolism, glycolysis/gluconeogenesis and the biosynthesis of amino acids KEGG pathways, were overexpressed in autumn but underexpressed in spring. In autumn, pyruvate metabolism, citrate cycle, cysteine and methionine metabolism and glyoxylate and dicarboxylate metabolism were altered, while in spring, proteins related to the formation of phagosomes and hydrogen peroxide metabolism were differentially expressed. Overall, protein expression signatures depended on season and Ag NPs exposure, suggesting that season significantly influences responses of mussels to NP exposure."

Concurrent advances in computational processing have also made it possible to store each individual diffraction pattern as it is collected, which has allowed more complex algorithms to be deployed for post-processing and indexing patterns. This paper proposes a new post-processing technique for pattern enhancement that aids in re-indexing by leveraging a non-local smoothing kernel whose weights are based on the exponential decay of the Euclidean distance between patterns. The advantage of this approach is its ability to utilize very large smoothing kernels without losing integrity near interface boundaries and while still operating on timescales comparable to traditional indexing approaches. Using an Inconel 600 nickel alloy sample, the capabilities and performance of the proposed approach are compared to other indexing schemes, including neighbor pattern averaging with re-indexing (NPAR) and a dictionary-based approach. The results demonstrate that the proposed method consistently produces a higher index success rate (ISR) than NPAR and comparable ISRs to the dictionary-based approach, a method with orders-of-magnitude greater computational demands.

Arylidene-1H-indole-2-carbohydrazones showed different extent antioxidant activity in DPPH, FRAP and ORAC assays. Good antioxidant activity is related to the number and position of hydroxyl groups on the arylidene moiety as well as to the presence of methoxy or 4-(diethylamino) group. On the contrary low antioxidant activity is showed by the isomeric 1H-indol-2-yl(methylene)-benzohydrazides. Furthermore, hydrazones 4-17 showed photoprotective capacities with satisfactory in vitro SPF as compared to the commercial PBSA sunscreen filter. The indole 16 and 17, showing the best antioxidant and photoprotective profile, were included in different formulation and their topical release was evaluated. Varying the formulation composition, it was possible to optimize skin adsorption and solubility of the active indole in the formulation. The antiproliferative effect of the hydrazones 4-17 was tested on human erythroleukemia K562 and melanoma Colo-38 cells. Hydrazones 11, 16 and 17 showed growth inhibition at sub micromolar concentrations on both cell lines. These results indicate indole hydrazones as potential multifunctional molecules especially in the treatment of neoplastic diseases being the good antioxidant properties of 16 and 17 correlated to their high antiproliferative activity.","Intrusive parenting, teacher sensitivity, and negative emotionality on the development of emotion regulation in early head start toddlers.",https://www.ncbi.nlm.nih.gov/pubmed/30825714,Infant behavior & development,2019 05 29,"Toddler emotion regulation develops within the context of relationships but is also influenced by toddlers' individual characteristics.

Latent growth models indicated that, after controlling for a series of family and child care covariates, intrusive parenting at 14 months had diminishing effects on trajectories of emotion regulation across toddlerhood (14 to 36 months), whereas teacher sensitivity in child care was promotive for emotion regulation growth. Toddlers with high negative emotionality were not more susceptible to the effects of intrusive parenting or teacher sensitivity on emotion regulation development, however, results suggested emerging evidence for individual differences in the protective nature of teacher sensitivity in the context of high intrusion at home.

Nine brain regions, including the left orbital part of superior and middle frontal gyrus, the bilateral supplementary motor area, the bilateral insula, the left hippocampus, the left putamen, and the left thalamus demonstrated extremely significant structural pattern changes along with the progression of AD. The disease classification was more efficient when based on the key connectivity related to these seed regions than when based on whole-brain structural connectivity. MDMR analysis reveals brain network reorganization caused by AD pathology. The key structural connectivity detected in this study exhibits promising distinguishing capability to predict prodromal AD patients.",Inter-rater agreement in glioma segmentations on longitudinal MRI.,https://www.ncbi.nlm.nih.gov/pubmed/30825711,NeuroImage. Clinical,2019 06 15,"Tumor segmentation of glioma on MRI is a technique to monitor, quantify and report disease progression. Manual MRI segmentation is the gold standard but very labor intensive. At present the quality of this gold standard is not known for different stages of the disease, and prior work has mainly focused on treatment-naive glioblastoma. In this paper we studied the inter-rater agreement of manual MRI segmentation of glioblastoma and WHO grade II-III glioma for novices and experts at three stages of disease. We also studied the impact of inter-observer variation on extent of resection and growth rate.",Decreased peak alpha frequency and impaired visual evoked potentials in first episode psychosis.,https://www.ncbi.nlm.nih.gov/pubmed/30825710,NeuroImage. Clinical,2019 06 15,"Abnormal spontaneous and evoked oscillations have been reported in several studies of patients with psychotic disorders. Resting alpha power and peak alpha frequency may be decreased in patients with psychosis. We used high-density EEG (hd-EEG) to record resting-state data and steady-state visual evoked potentials (SSVEPs) in patients with first episode psychosis (FEP) and healthy controls to compare brain resonances across multiple frequencies. We recorded hd-EEG (128 channels) from 22 FEP patients and 22 healthy controls during eyes-closed resting state and eyes-closed photic stimulation at 1 Hz, 4 Hz, 10 Hz, 20 Hz, and 40 Hz. Alpha power, peak alpha frequency, and SSVEP amplitude were analyzed using ANOVA and statistical non-parametric mapping. We found that FEP patients had lower peak alpha frequencies (9.72 Hz vs 10.40 Hz, p = .02, Cohen's d = 0.73) and this decrease was driven by slowing over the central and posterior scalp. There was no difference in alpha power. Alpha waves propagated primarily from anterior to posterior and that propagation was slowed in patients. During SSVEP, patients had smaller increases in EEG power in the stimulation band (F(1,184) = 5.3, p = .02). Patients had attenuated responses to SSVEP stimulation at alpha, beta and gamma frequencies. The gamma response was partially preserved in patients who also had depressive symptoms. We conclude that even in early stages of illness, psychotic disorders are associated with decreased alpha peak frequency and impaired evoked resonances. These findings implicate multiple patterns of dysconnectivity in cortico-cortico and cortico-thalamic networks in FEP.",Exploring substituent diversity on pyrrolidine-aryltriazole iminosugars: Structural basis of β-glucocerebrosidase inhibition.,https://www.ncbi.nlm.nih.gov/pubmed/30825709,Bioorganic chemistry,2019 04 14,"The synthesis of a library of pyrrolidine-aryltriazole hybrids through CuAAC between two epimeric dihydroxylated azidomethylpyrrolidines and differently substituted phenylacetylenes is reported. The evaluation of the new compounds as inhibitors of lysosomal β-glucocerebrosidase showed the importance of the substitution pattern of the phenyl moiety in the inhibition. Crystallization and docking studies revealed key interactions of the pyrrolidine motif with aminoacid residues of the catalytic site while the aryltriazole moiety extended along a hydrophobic surface groove. Some of these compounds were able to increase the enzyme activity in Gaucher patient fibroblasts, acting as a new type of chemical chaperone for Gaucher disease."

AF has been correlated with silent lesions and cognitive impairment, even in the absence of stroke. The cognitive impairment in AF represents a risk of functional decline, morbidity, mortality and high costs, constituting a public health problem due to the increasing prevalence of this arrhythmia. Cognitive analysis of patients with AF without stroke has shown poor performance in executive, memory and learning functions. The greater loss occurs in speed processing and performance of instrumental tasks leading to functional dependence. Neuroimaging studies have shown both structural and functional abnormalities in individuals with AF even in the absence of cognitive impairment. The mechanisms related to cognitive impairment and cerebral abnormalities in the AF are still a matter of discussion in the literature and, therefore, how to stop its progression is unknown. We reviewed the recent evidence about AF and dementia in patients without stroke, with special emphasis to the reported profile of cognitive dysfunction and the neuroimaging evidence of brain abnormalities.","XALIA-LEA: An observational study of venous thromboembolism treatment with rivaroxaban and standard anticoagulation in the Asia-Pacific, Eastern Europe, the Middle East, Africa and Latin America.",https://www.ncbi.nlm.nih.gov/pubmed/30825694,Thrombosis research,2019 03 29,"The prospective, non-interventional XALIA study investigated the safety and effectiveness of rivaroxaban and standard anticoagulation for the treatment of deep vein thrombosis (DVT).

Previous work has demonstrated the age-dependent decline in behavioral output in the model organism Drosophila. We demonstrate that this age-dependent decline in circadian output is combined with changes in daily activity of Drosophila. Aging also has a large impact on sleep behavior, significantly increasing sleep duration while reducing latency. We used electrophysiology to record from large ventral lateral neurons of the Drosophila circadian clock, finding a significant decrease in input resistance with age but no significant changes in spontaneous electrical activity or membrane potential. We propose this change contributes to observed behavioral and sleep changes in light-dark conditions. We also demonstrate a reduction in the daily plasticity of the architecture of the small ventral lateral neurons, likely underlying the reduction in circadian rhythmicity during aging. These results provide further insights into the effect of aging on circadian biology, demonstrating age-related changes in electrical activity in conjunction with the decline in behavioral outputs.",Environmental pyrethroid exposure and diabetes in U.S. adults.,https://www.ncbi.nlm.nih.gov/pubmed/30825691,Environmental research,2019 06 10,"Pyrethroid insecticides have been used widely as replacements for organophosphate insecticides over the past decades. While several animal studies suggest that exposure to pyrethroids can alter glucose homeostasis, there is only limited evidence of the association between environmental pyrethroid exposure and diabetes risk in human populations. Therefore, we examined the National Health and Nutrition Examination Survey (NHANES) 2007-2010 data to determine the association between environmental pyrethroid exposure and the prevalence of diabetes in the general U.S. population. Using data on 2796 participants aged 20-79 years from NHANES 2007-2010, we estimated odds ratios (ORs) and 95% confidence intervals (CI) of the association between diabetes and urinary metabolite concentration of pyrethroids using logistic regression. The weighted prevalence of diabetes was 10.3%. The weighted geometric means and detection rate of 3-phenoxybenzoic acid (3-PBA), the most common nonspecific pyrethroid metabolite, were 0.41 μg/L (95% CI: 0.38, 0.45) and 72.0%, respectively. After adjusting for sociodemographic, behavioral, and metabolic factors, we found a significant dose-response relationship between urinary 3-PBA as quartile and prevalent diabetes (p-trend=0.007). Compared to the lowest quartile of 3-PBA, the highest quartile had OR of 2.18 (95% CI: 1.18, 4.03) for diabetes. Our finding suggests pyrethroid insecticides as a potential risk factor for diabetes. Further studies should be conducted to confirm our finding and to determine if this association is causal.",Nature-based solutions: Settling the issue of sustainable urbanization.,https://www.ncbi.nlm.nih.gov/pubmed/30825690,Environmental research,2019 05 11,"Rapid urbanization presents one of the most urgent challenges of our times. Cities must cope with poor air quality, heat island effects, increased flood risk and the frequency/severity of extreme events (e.g., droughts and heat waves), increasing crime and social inequity, poverty and degraded urban environments, amongst other negative consequences. Climate change adaptation and mitigation as well as sustainable management are therefore key challenges for cities in Europe and around the world. What must be developed therefore is a robust, wide evidence-base and reference framework of nature-based solutions (NBS) - measures that mimic the complex features and processes of natural ecosystems - for local/regional city authorities and other policy and decision makers to increase climate resilience and address inclusive urban regeneration in cities. In response to this need, we propose an applicative framework for NBS using the structure of the DPSIR (Driving force-Pressure-State-Impact-Response) model, in conformity with European Community standards. Indeed, under the umbrella of the EC's Framework Program - Horizon 2020 - international institutions, scientific experts and policy makers worldwide are seeking to increase collaboration with cities to enhance ecosystem services and develop the evidence-base for the economic, social and environmental benefits of nature-based solutions. They are eager to exchange knowledge and inspire positive action for nature in urban areas to meet their growing social and environmental challenges. The time has come to acknowledge NBS as the most fitting response to the numerous challenges posed by our changing climate and for the realization of sustainable and healthy cities. It is hoped that this article will pioneer others in settling the issue for NBS as the undisputable answer to challenged urban landscapes and societies globally.",What's in a name? Branding reclaimed water.,https://www.ncbi.nlm.nih.gov/pubmed/30825689,Environmental research,2019 05 11,"Reclaimed water is often presented as a cost-effective, reliable, and safe solution to increasingly common water shortages in the United States and across the globe, but studies have shown that consumers tend to object to the use of this water. Broad adoption of this technology will require consumer acceptance or at least tolerance of it, and studies have suggested that better branding could minimize consumers' concerns. In this study, we first test twenty-one potential branding names for reclaimed water using survey responses to identify the top-six most favored names. We then determine whether an opportunity for consumers to try reclaimed water can change their preferences. The results suggest that the common names for this water, such as Recycled, Reclaimed, Nontraditional, Treated Wastewater, and Reused, are the least appealing, as they all scored at the bottom. In contrast, names that invoke desirable characteristics of the water-Pure, Eco-Friendly, and Advanced Purified, were viewed significantly more favorable than the others. Having an opportunity to taste reclaimed water treated to a potable standard seems to clarify consumers' preferences by increasing the differences in favorability between the names. Based on these results, it appears that while there are a couple of appealing names, the most consistently preferred is Pure Water."

Nucleic acids,2019 06 12,"Vascular endothelial growth factor A (VEGFA) is involved in the pathogenesis of vasoproliferative retinal diseases, such as exudative age-related macular degeneration (AMD). The objective of this study was to investigate whether dual-acting therapy based on the simultaneous expression of anti-VEGFA microRNAs (miRNAs) and the secreted, antiangiogenic protein pigment endothelial-derived factor (PEDF) delivered by adeno-associated virus (AAV) vectors provides improved protection against choroidal neovascularization (CNV). To investigate this, a multigenic AAV vector allowing retina pigment epithelium (RPE)-specific expression of anti-VEGFA miRNAs and PEDF was engineered. Robust expression of PEDF, driven by the RPE-specific vitelliform macular dystrophy 2 promoter, was observed in human cells and in mouse retina. A significant reduction in CNV was observed in a laser-induced CNV mouse model 57 days post-injection of the AAV5 particles conveying either anti-VEGFA miRNA and PEDF dual therapy or anti-VEGFA miRNA monotherapy. Overall, CNV reduction was most prominent in animals receiving dual-acting therapy. In both cases, the reduction in CNV was accompanied by a significant attenuation of VEGFA. In conclusion, the presented data reveal that gene therapy targeting VEGFA via multigenic AAV vectors displays combined efficacy, suggesting that dual-acting therapy is an important tool in future eye gene therapy for the treatment of neovascular ocular diseases, including AMD.",Targeting RNA-Mediated Toxicity in C9orf72 ALS and/or FTD by RNAi-Based Gene Therapy.,https://www.ncbi.nlm.nih.gov/pubmed/30825670,Molecular therapy.

The corresponding repeat-containing sense and antisense transcripts cause a gain of toxicity through the accumulation of RNA foci in the nucleus and deposition of dipeptide-repeat (DPR) proteins in the cytoplasm of the affected cells. We have previously reported on the potential of engineered artificial anti-C9orf72-targeting miRNAs (miC) targeting C9orf72 to reduce the gain of toxicity caused by the repeat-containing transcripts. In the current study, we tested the silencing efficacy of adeno-associated virus (AAV)5-miC in human-derived induced pluripotent stem cell (iPSC) neurons and in an ALS mouse model. We demonstrated that AAV5-miC transduces different types of neuronal cells and can reduce the accumulation of repeat-containing C9orf72 transcripts. Additionally, we demonstrated silencing of C9orf72 in both the nucleus and cytoplasm, which has an added value for the treatment of ALS and/or FTD patients. A proof of concept in an ALS mouse model demonstrated the significant reduction in repeat-containing C9orf72 transcripts and RNA foci after treatment. Taken together, these findings support the feasibility of a gene therapy for ALS and FTD based on the reduction in toxicity caused by the repeat-containing C9orf72 transcripts.",MicroRNA-126 Regulates Angiogenesis and Neurogenesis in a Mouse Model of Focal Cerebral Ischemia.,https://www.ncbi.nlm.nih.gov/pubmed/30825669,Molecular therapy.

Here, we explored the effect of microRNA-126-3p and microRNA-126-5p on angiogenesis and neurogenesis after brain ischemia. We demonstrated that both microRNA (miRNA)-126-3p and microRNA-126-5p increased the proliferation, migration, and tube formation of human umbilical vein endothelial cells (HUVECs) compared with the scrambled miRNA control (p < 0.05). Transferring microRNA-126 into a mouse middle cerebral artery occlusion model via lentivirus, we found that microRNA-126 overexpression increased the number of CD31+/BrdU+ (5-bromo-2'-deoxyuridine-positive) proliferating endothelial cells and DCX+/BrdU+ neuroblasts in the ischemic mouse brain, improved neurobehavioral outcomes (p < 0.05), and reduced brain atrophy volume (p < 0.05) compared with control mice. Western blot results showed that AKT and ERK signaling pathways were activated in the lentiviral-microRNA-126-treated group (p < 0.05). Both PCR and western blot results demonstrated that tyrosine-protein phosphatase non-receptor type 9 (PTPN9) was decreased in the lentiviral-microRNA-126-treated group (p < 0.05). Dual-luciferase gene reporter assay also showed that PTPN9 was the direct target of microRNA-126-3p and microRNA-126-5p in the ischemic brain. We demonstrated that microRNA-126-3p and microRNA-126-5p promoted angiogenesis and neurogenesis in ischemic mouse brain, and further improved neurobehavioral outcomes. Our mechanistic study further showed that microRNA-126 mediated angiogenesis through directly inhibiting its target PTPN9 and activating AKT and ERK signaling pathways.","Discovery of the Oncogenic Parp1, a Target of bcr-abl and a Potential Therapeutic, in mir-181a/PPFIA1 Signaling Pathway.",https://www.ncbi.nlm.nih.gov/pubmed/30825668,Molecular therapy.

Phospho-array assay shows that multiple phosphorylated proteins, particularly KIT signaling molecules, were downregulated in PPFIA1 inhibition. Additionally, PPFIA1 bound PARP1, a common molecule downstream of both PPFIA1 and BCR/ABL, to upregulate KIT protein through activation of nuclear factor kappa B (NF-κB)-P65 expression. Targeted inhibition of PPFIA1 and PARP1 downregulated c-KIT level, inhibited CML cell growth, and prolonged mouse survival.

The VEEV genome codes for 4 non-structural proteins (nsP), of which nsP3 contains a Macro domain. Macro domains (MD) can be found as stand-alone proteins or embedded within larger proteins in viruses, bacteria and eukaryotes. Their most common feature is the binding of ADP-ribose (ADPr), while several macro domains act as ribosylation writers, erasers or readers. Alphavirus MD erase ribosylation but their precise contribution in viral replication is still under investigation. NMR-driven titration experiments of ADPr in solution with the VEEV macro domain (in apo- and complex state) show that it adopts a suitable conformation for ADPr binding. Specific experiments indicate that the flexibility of the loops β5-α3 and α3-β6 is critical for formation of the complex and assists a wrapping mechanism for ADPr binding. Furthermore, along with this sequence of events, the VEEV MD undergoes a conformational exchange process between the apo state and a low-populated ""dark"" conformational state.","Molecular characterization of toll-like receptor 14 from golden pompano Trachinotus ovatus (Linnaeus, 1758) and its expression response to three types of pathogen-associated molecular patterns.",https://www.ncbi.nlm.nih.gov/pubmed/30825647,"Comparative biochemistry and physiology.

Toll-like receptor 14 (TLR14) has been identified in several fish species, but its function requires further study. In this study, TLR14 (designed as ToTLR14) from golden pompano (Trachinotus ovatus), was characterized and investigated its expression responses to three types of pathogen-associated molecular patterns. The full-length ToTLR14 cDNA was 3191 bp, and the deduced protein consisted of 876 amino acids. The ToTLR14 protein included 5 leucine rich repeat (LRR) domains, a C-terminal LRR domain in the extracellular region, a transmembrane domain and a Toll/interleukin (IL)-1 receptor (TIR) domain in the cytoplasmic region, which fits with the typical TLR domain architecture. The genomic organization of ToTLR14 was also identified and consisted of four introns and five exons. The predicted promoter region of ToTLR14 contained several putative transcription factor binding sites. Phylogenetic analysis showed that ToTLR14 was clustered into the TLR1 subfamily clade. Quantitative real-time (qRT-PCR) analysis indicated that ToTLR14 were ubiquitously expressed in all examined tissues, with higher mRNA levels observed in the skin, kidney and intestine, while the lowest level was detected in the stomach. After injection with polyinosinic:polycytidylic acid [poly(I:C)], flagellin or lipopolysaccharides (LPS), the expression level of ToTLR14 mRNA were significantly upregulated in various tissues of golden pompano.

Intracellular ROS, the ATP amount, ER volume, acid cell compartments and mitochondrial potential rapidly reduced with dose, whereas the release of LDH and apoptotic bodies dramatically increased. Additionally, multiple cell death pathways were activated following exposure to ALS, and the expression of caveolin-1, p-Acetyl CoA carboxylase, p21, and p-ERK were greatly inhibited. Moreover, the secretion of inflammatory mediators and expression of innate- and adaptive-immune response-related proteins were remarkably reduced. Meanwhile, the secretion of TGF-β was enhanced. Therefore, we conclude that ALS-induced apoptosis may be due to mitochondrial dysfunction triggered by the inhibition of caveolin-1, and that chronic pulmonary exposure to ALS may cause adverse health effects such as cancer and fibrosis by impairing the host's pulmonary immune system.",Serial Cardiac FDG-PET for the Diagnosis and Therapeutic Guidance of Patients With Cardiac Sarcoidosis.,https://www.ncbi.nlm.nih.gov/pubmed/30825644,Journal of cardiac failure,2019 04 13,"Cardiac fluorodeoxyglucose positron-emission tomography (FDG-PET) has emerged as a standard imaging modality for the diagnosis of cardiac sarcoidosis (CS); however, there is a scarcity of data on the use of serial FDG-PET to guide immunosuppressive therapy.

However, little is known about how this neurotoxic insult affects persisting neuronal excitability after the initial exposure. Here we investigated synaptic activity and intrinsic excitability of the ventrobasal nucleus (VB) of the thalamus caused by neonatal GA administration. We used patch-clamp recordings from acute thalamic slices in young rats up to two weeks after neurotoxic GA exposure of isoflurane and nitrous oxide for 6 h at postnatal age of 7 (P7) days. We found that GA exposure at P7 increases evoked excitatory postsynaptic currents (eEPSCs) two fold by means through AMPA mediated mechanisms, while NMDA component was spared. In addition, miniature EPSCs showed a faster decay rate in neurons from GA treated animals when compared to sham controls. Likewise, we discovered that the amplitudes of evoked inhibitory postsynaptic currents (eIPSCs) were increased in VB neurons from GA animals about two-fold. Interestingly, these results were observed in female but not male rats. In contrast, intrinsic excitability and properties of T-type voltage gated calcium currents were minimally affected by GA exposure. Together, these data further the idea that GAs cause lasting alterations in synaptic transmission and neuronal excitability depending upon the placing and connectivity of neurons in the thalamus. Given that function of thalamocortical circuits critically depends on the delicate balance between excitation and inhibition, future development of therapies aimed at addressing consequences of altered excitability in the developing brain by GAs may be an attractive possibility.",Conditioned Pain Modulation in Sexual Assault Survivors.,https://www.ncbi.nlm.nih.gov/pubmed/30825639,The journal of pain : official journal of the American Pain Society,2019 04 01,"Sexual assault (SA) is associated with an increased risk of chronic pain, but the mechanisms for this relationship are poorly understood. To explore whether disrupted descending inhibition is involved, this study used a conditioned pain modulation task to study the inhibition of pain and the nociceptive flexion reflex (NFR; a correlate of spinal nociception) in 32 pain-free SA survivors. This group was compared with 32 pain-free, trauma-exposed persons without SA and a group of 40 pain-free persons who reported no trauma exposure. Conditioned pain modulation was assessed from painful electric stimulations (test stimulus) delivered to the ankle before, during, and after participants submerged their hand in painful 10°C water (conditioning stimulus). Pain ratings and NFR were assessed in response to test stimuli. All groups demonstrated significant inhibition of pain during conditioned pain modulation. However, only the no trauma exposure group demonstrated significant inhibition of NFR. The persons without SA group showed no inhibition of NFR, whereas the SA group showed significant facilitation of the NFR. These findings suggest that trauma exposure may impair inhibitory cerebrospinal circuits, but that SA may specifically promote facilitation of spinal nociception. Perspective: This study suggests that trauma exposure disrupts the cerebrospinal inhibition of spinal nociception, but that exposure to SA further promotes chronic pain risk by facilitating spinal nociception. This finding help may help to elucidate the pain risk mechanisms in trauma survivors.",Outcomes of Extended Lymphadenectomy for Gastroesophageal Carcinoma: A Large Western Series.,https://www.ncbi.nlm.nih.gov/pubmed/30825638,Journal of the American College of Surgeons,2019 05 26,The extent of lymph node dissection for patients with gastroesophageal carcinoma remains controversial.

Dividing the VAT into 2 triangles (suprahypoglossal [SHT] and infrahypoglossal [IHT]), although elegant, oversimplifies CMC anatomy.

This is in part due to the lack of high level evidence-based guidelines. Despite this there are current recommendations which offer guidance regarding certain parameters such as MAP and systolic BP. However managing hypertension within this critical period is difficult since a fine balance must be achieved between lowering BP enough to minimize the risk of re-bleeding, and preventing reduced cerebral perfusion and subsequent ischaemic damage. Furthermore, the different causes of hypertension within the post-haemorrhage/pre-treatment period is polyfactorial and includes pathophysiological responses, activating sympathetic nervous sytem, and iatrogenic from hyperdynamic therapy and vasopressors, and requires consideration for these patients to receive optimal management. Other factors including loss of autoregulation and concomitant conditions must also be taken into consideration when deciding whether to start anti-hypertensive therapy. It is clear that further, larger, studies are warranted in order to clarify the effect of anti-hypertensive therapy on patient outcome, and what the BP thresholds are, along with establishing the best treatment, for commencing anti-hypertensive therapy.",Use of Pterional Craniotomy for Removal of Penetrating Object: Video Submission and Case Report.,https://www.ncbi.nlm.nih.gov/pubmed/30825621,World neurosurgery,2019 03 02,and Importance: Penetrating injuries are dangerous because they can damage intracranial structures.
