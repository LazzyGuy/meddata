Due to an increasing scope of applications, the exposure of humans to nanoparticles (NPs) is inevitable. A number of studies revealed that after inhalation or oral exposure, NPs accumulate in, among other places, the lungs, alimentary tract, liver, heart, spleen, kidneys and cardiac muscle. In addition, they disturb glucose and lipid homeostasis in mice and rats. In a wide group of nanoparticles currently used on an industrial scale, titanium dioxide nanoparticles-TiO2 NPs-are particularly popular. Due to their white colour, TiO2 NPs are commonly used as a food additive (E 171). The possible risk to health after consuming food containing nanoparticles has been poorly explored but it is supposed that the toxicity of nanoparticles depends on their size, morphology, rate of migration and amount consumed. Scientific databases inform that TiO2 NPs can induce inflammation due to oxidative stress. They can also have a genotoxic effect leading to, among others, apoptosis or chromosomal instability. This paper gives a review of previous studies concerning the effects of exposure to TiO2 NPs on a living organism (human, animal). This information is necessary in order to demonstrate potential toxicity of inorganic nanoparticles on human health.",Another brick in the wall: is hexane neuropathy a 'nodo-paranodopathy'?,https://www.ncbi.nlm.nih.gov/pubmed/30982200,Acta neurologica Belgica,2019 04 14,"n-Hexane gives cause to one of the most common toxic polyneuropathies seen in poorly ventilated factories. It is a sensory-motor polyneuropathy ending up with axonal degeneration. Nerve biopsy reveals paranodal axonal swelling and secondary myelin retraction in early stages. Myelin retraction imitates demyelination causing focal conduction block and failure before axonal degeneration emerges. This brings to mind the new category of nodo-paranodopathy described first for anti-ganglioside antibody-mediated neuropathies, which can be proved by electrophysiological re-evaluations. We, herein, discuss the clinical and electrophysiological follow-up of three patients with n-hexane neuropathy and remark overlaps with new concept nodo-paranodopathy.",Clinical observation of lymphopenia in patients with newly diagnosed glioblastoma.,https://www.ncbi.nlm.nih.gov/pubmed/30982199,Journal of neuro-oncology,2019 06 10,"Lymphopenia in patients with glioblastoma (GBM) is related to treatment as well as disease progression.

Here, we show that the diatoms Thalassiosira weissflogii and Phaeodactylum tricornutum, which utilize different carbon acquisition mechanisms, respond differently to short-term changes in seawater carbonate chemistry. Our results showed that T. weissflogii showed significantly higher photosynthetic oxygen evolution rates than that of P. tricornutum at low levels of CO2 or HCO3-. This suggests that T. weissflogii had higher affinities for CO2 or HCO3- when their concentrations were not sufficient to support saturated growth and photosynthesis. While the activity of Rubisco in P. tricornutum positively correlated with carbonic anhydrases (CA), we observed negative relationship between Rubisco and CA activity in the diatom T. weissflogii. These contrasting physiological responses of diatoms with varied carbon acquisition mechanisms indicate different abilities to cope up with abrupt changes in seawater carbonate chemistry. We propose that the ability to respond to varying carbonate chemistry may act as one determinant of the diatom distributions and phytoplankton community structures.",Relevance of dissolved organic matter generated from green manuring of Chinese milk vetch in relation to water-soluble cadmium.,https://www.ncbi.nlm.nih.gov/pubmed/30982193,Environmental science and pollution research international,2019 06 10,"Dissolved organic matter (DOM) can become a carrier of soil contaminants. Therefore, an understanding of the evolution and characteristics of DOM produced by Chinese milk vetch during green manuring is crucial. In this study, DOM solutions from 28 days' manuring with three different organic materials were characterized using three-dimensional fluorescence excitation-emission matrix (3D-EEM) with parallel factor (PARAFAC) analysis, and ultraviolet-visible spectroscopy. With the green manuring milk vetch at flowering period (MVFP), the DOC and water-soluble cadmium (WS-Cd) in soil solution reached 1875 mg/l and 2.64 μg/l, respectively, on day 6 after manuring. The PARAFAC analysis modeled three components: protein-like (tryptophan) and two humic-like components (humic acid and fulvic acid); DOM produced by MVFP was primarily protein-like during the early stage of decomposition. The aromaticity and molecular weight of DOM in the MVFP treatment was lower than in the other treatments, which could promote the release of soil particle-adsorbed Cd to soil solution. Principal components analysis showed that aromaticity was the main factor affecting Cd solubility, and the negative linear correlation of aromaticity with WS-Cd reached 0.4827. The results of this study supported the idea that manuring with MVFP might accelerate Cd infiltration to deep soil with water under gravity.",Extracellular electron transfer modes and rate-limiting steps in denitrifying biocathodes.,https://www.ncbi.nlm.nih.gov/pubmed/30982192,Environmental science and pollution research international,2019 06 10,"Denitrifying bioelectrochemical system provided an alternative technology for nitrogen removal, even power recovery from wastewater, and its nitrogen removal performance and intermediate accumulation were affected by the extracellular electron transfer modes and rate-limiting steps in denitrifying biocathodes. In the current study, the extracellular electron transfer modes and rate-limiting steps for nitrate reduction and nitrite reduction of denitrifying biocathode were investigated through cyclic voltammetry. When the cathode potential swept from 0.003 to - 0.897 V (vs. Ag/AgCl), denitrifiers were indispensable for electrochemical denitrification. Three peak potentials were found in the cyclic voltammogram of denitrifying biocathode, where E1 (- 0.471 to - 0.465 V) and E2 (- 0.412 to - 0.428 V) represented respectively nitrate reduction and nitrite oxidation while E3 (- 0.822 to - 0.826 V) represented nitrite reduction. Nitrate reduction involved the direct electron transfer mode while nitrite reduction involved the mediated electron transfer mode. Intracellular catalytic reaction was the rate-limiting step for nitrate reduction, independent on the electrochemical activity of denitrifying biocathode and the nitrate supply. The nitrate supply posed an effect on the rate-limiting step for nitrite reduction. The mediator transfer was the rate-limiting step for nitrite reduction in the absence of nitrate. But both mediator transfer and intracellular catalytic reaction became the rate-limiting steps for nitrite reduction in the presence of sufficient nitrate."

To compare the efficacy and safety of fractional Er:Glass laser used in combination with topical 5% minoxidil versus 5% minoxidil alone for the treatment of male AGA, 30 men with AGA were randomized to 24 weeks of split-scalp treatment using fractional Er:Glass laser and 5% minoxidil on one side (combined therapy) or 5% minoxidil alone on the other side (monotherapy). The primary outcome was the difference in hair density and diameter, from baseline, between two treatment sides, at week 24. The secondary outcome was a global photographic assessment, evaluated by two dermatologists and the participants. Adverse events were evaluated. Twenty-nine participants completed the 24-week study period. Combination therapy provided significantly superior results for both the primary and secondary outcomes (all p < 0.05). No serious adverse events were identified for either treatment. In conclusion, combination therapy, consisting of fractional Er:Glass laser and topical minoxidil, is a promising treatment option for AGA.

Photobiomodulation (PBM) appears to help reduce pain and control inflammation, and it also accelerates bone repair. This systematic review aimed to evaluate the effectiveness and safety of PBM with low-level laser therapy (LLLT) in the bone fracture healing process. We included randomized controlled trials (RCTs) comparing the effects of PBM with those of any other intervention in adults with lower or upper limb bone fractures. The primary outcomes investigated were pain reduction, radiographic healing, and adverse events. The searches were conducted in October 2018. Two RCTs were included that compared PBM to the placebo. A meta-analysis showed significant difference in favor of PBM for pain reduction (MD 1.19, 95% CI [0.61 to 1.77], 106 participants, two RCTs), but this difference was not clinically significant. One RCT (50 participants) showed a clinical and statistical improvement in physical function (MD - 14.60, 95% CI [- 21.39 to - 7.81]) and no difference in radiographic healing, regarding absence of fracture line (RR 1.00, 95% CI [0.93 to 1.08]) and visible bone callus (RR 0.33, 95% CI [0.01 to 7.81]). The certainty of evidence was classified as low to very low. Based on the evidence of low to very low certainty, PBM seems to be associated with the improvement of pain and function.

The aim of this study was to investigate the treatment strategy for appendicitis among Swiss surgeons with particular interest in laparoscopic technique, method of appendiceal stump closure, and abdominal lavage. We performed an anonymous survey among 540 members of the Swiss Surgical Society. Technical details and differences between the surgical procedures in adults and children as well as in complicated and non-complicated appendicitis were investigated. The overall response rate was 45% (n = 243). 78% of the surgeons perform laparoscopic appendectomies in children and 95% in adult patients. Only 3% use a single incision site technique. Surgeons consider pus or stool in the abdomen (94%), an abscess (86%) or perforation of the appendix (82%), but not an inflamed appendiceal base (16%) as complicated appendicitis. 41% of surgeons use endoloops, 36% a stapling device, and 20% polymeric clips in non-complicated appendicitis for appendiceal stump closure. However, 82% of the surgeons use a stapler in complicated appendicitis. Most (76%) of surgeons do not plunge the appendiceal stump. 24% of surgeons lavage the abdomen with > 1 L of fluid independent of the intraabdominal finding. Most Swiss surgeons perform multiport laparoscopic appendectomies. Endoloops and staplers are mostly used for appendiceal stump closures in uncomplicated appendicitis, and staplers in complicated appendicitis. Only a minor part of surgeons plunge the appendiceal stump or perform routine abdominal lavage."

In addition, this river receives wastewater from urban and rural areas. The aim in this present study was to evaluate the quality of raw water by some physical, chemical and toxicological tests. The physicochemical results found high levels of turbidity, conductivity, aluminum, phosphorus and metal iron, manganese, copper and lithium when compared to the standards of the Brazilian legislation. The values found of toxicity demonstrated a high degree of cytotoxicity and genotoxicity. Therefore, it was concluded that the Meia Ponte River has been undergoing constant environmental degradation, causing the poor quality of its waters. Thus, measures for the prevention and recovery should be adopted for the maintenance of the Meia Ponte River.","Does leadership support buffer the effect of workplace bullying on the risk of disability pensioning?

Although the complete response rate of cryoablation for breast cancer is reported to be relatively good, most studies enrolled a small number of patients, and so reliable conclusions could not be drawn. In this review, we introduce the mechanisms of action of cryoablation, and summarize the current literature on the efficacy and safety of cryoablation for breast cancer.

We described the results of different doses used for SRS and FSRT, the current status, and a comparison between the two radiotherapy approaches. Stereotactic radiotherapy techniques aim to control tumor growth with minimal toxicity. SRS using either a cobalt unit or a linear accelerator has given high rates of tumor control and of cranial nerve function preservation with marginal doses range of 12-14 Gy. Fractionated stereotactic radiotherapy (FSRT) is optimal for tumors larger than 3 cm. Doses as low as 50.4 Gy provide excellent control rates and low morbidity.

The present study reported that the Sinorhizobium fredii HH103 gene rhcJ belongs to the tts (type III secretion) cluster and that the mutant HH103ΩrhcJ can clearly decrease the number of nodules in American soybeans. However, few QTLs of nodule traits have been identified. This study used a soybean (Glycine max (L.) Merr.) 'Charleston' × 'Dongnong 594' (C × D, n = 150) recombinant inbred line (RIL). Nodule traits were analysed in the RIL population after inoculation with S. fredii HH103 and the mutant HH103ΩrhcJ. Plants were grown in a greenhouse with a 16-h light cycle at 26 °C and an 8-h dark cycle at 18 °C. Then, 4 weeks after inoculation, plants were harvested for evaluation of nodule traits. Through QTL mapping, 16 QTLs were detected on 8 chromosomes. Quantitative PCR (qRT-PCR) and RNA-seq analysis determined that the genes Glyma.04g060600, Glyma.18g159800 and Glyma.13g252600 might interact with rhcJ.",Molecular modeling and QM/MM calculation clarify the catalytic mechanism of β-lactamase N1.,https://www.ncbi.nlm.nih.gov/pubmed/30982150,Journal of molecular modeling,2019 05 21,"The treatment of bacterial infections is currently threatened by the emergence of pathogenic bacteria producing β-lactamase, which catalyzes the hydrolysis of β-lactams. Although the hydrolysis of the substrate nitrocefin by a metallo-β-lactamase, namely β-lactamase N1 from USA300 (a typical methicillin-resistant Staphylococcus aureus), has previously been reported in the literature, its mechanism remains elusive. Here, we show that molecular modeling and quantum-mechanical/molecular mechanics (QM/MM) calculations describing the complex of β-lactamase N1 with nitrocefin (the substrate of β-lactamase N1) can predict the catalytic mechanism of nitrocefin hydrolysis by β-lactamase N1. Molecular dynamics simulation shows that the catalytic reaction begins with hydrogen bond formation between Gln171 and a water molecule, which is thereby captured for nitrocefin hydrolysis by β-lactamase N1. In addition, the carboxyl group coordinates Zn2 in a chelating fashion. The binding energy decompositions suggest that Phe169 anchors nitrocefin by π-stacking interactions between the benzene rings. Specifically, Phe169 and Zn2 position the nitrocefin in specific orientations. The active site of β-lactamase N1 contains two residues (Gln171 and Phe169) that we expected to be crucial for guiding the nitrocefin hydrolysis reaction. Compelling evidence is provided that the mutants F169A and Q171A show lower enzymatic activity than the wild-type protein. On the basis of the QM/MM calculations, we propose that nitrocefin hydrolysis is initiated by the interaction between the oxygen atom of water and the C18 atom of nitrocefin, leading to the opening of the four-membered ring of nitrocefin and the formation of a substrate intermediate. In the next step, a hydrogen atom transfers from the nitrogen atom to the C11 atom of nitrocefin, resulting in the stable product.",Occurrence of cerebral small vessel disease at diagnosis of MPO-ANCA-associated vasculitis.,https://www.ncbi.nlm.nih.gov/pubmed/30982149,Journal of neurology,2019 04 14,"Anti-neutrophil cytoplasmic antibody (ANCA)-associated vasculitis (AAV) often causes peripheral nervous system impairments.

To further those standards and guidelines, we have developed a checklist that can be used as a self-evaluation to identify gaps in their programs for continual quality improvement over time. Because there is currently no organization willing to oversee an external proficiency program, the checklist provides the first step toward an internal, self-assessment that can be used periodically to monitor improvements. In addition, we attempt to address concerns from the canine community regarding rare or private mutations, genetic screening using array-based technologies, non-peer reviewed tests that are being offered, and the clinical validity of certain mutations in particular breeds.

Molecular evaluation of polydactyly can serve as a tool to elucidate genetic and signaling pathways that regulate limb development, specifically, the anterior-posterior specification of the limb. To date, only five genes have been identified for nonsyndromic PAP: FAM92A, GLI1, GLI3, IQCE and ZNF141. In this study, two Pakistani multiplex consanguineous families with autosomal recessive nonsyndromic PAP were clinically and molecularly evaluated. From both pedigrees, a DNA sample from an affected member underwent exome sequencing. In each family, we identified a segregating frameshift (c.591dupA [p.(Q198Tfs*21)]) and nonsense variant (c.2173A > T [p.(K725*)]) in KIAA0825 (also known as C5orf36). Although KIAA0825 encodes a protein of unknown function, it has been demonstrated that its murine ortholog is expressed during limb development.

Along with the pelvic bone, the skull is the most important source of sexual dimorphism. On the human skull, the upper third of the face (i.e., the frontal bone) is one of the most significant sexually dimorphic structures useful in anthropological research, especially when studied by methods of virtual anthropology. This study was focused on sex estimation using the form and shape of the external surface of the frontal bone with or without the inclusion of its sinuses. The study sample consisted of 103 cranial CT images from a contemporary Czech population. Three-dimensional virtual models of the frontal bones and sinuses were analyzed using geometric morphometrics and multidimensional statistics: coherent point drift-dense correspondence analysis (CPD-DCA), principal component analysis (PCA), and support vector machine (SVM). The whole external frontal surface was significantly different between males and females both in form and shape. The greatest total success rate of sex estimation based on form was 93.2%, which decreased to 86.41% after crossvalidation, and this model identified females and males with the same accuracy. The best estimation based on shape reached a success rate of 91.26%, with slightly greater accuracy for females. After crossvalidation, however, the success rate decreased to 83.49%. The differences between sexes were significant also in the volume and surface of the frontal sinuses, but the sex estimation had only 64.07% accuracy after crossvalidation. Simultaneous use of the shape of the frontal surface and the frontal sinuses improved the total success rate to 98.05%, which decreased to 84.46% after crossvalidation.","Novel Y-chromosome short tandem repeat sequence variation for loci DYS710, DYS518, DYS385, DYS644, DYS612, DYS626, DYS504, DYS481, DYS447 and DYS449.",https://www.ncbi.nlm.nih.gov/pubmed/30982129,International journal of legal medicine,2019 04 14,"In forensic casework, Y-chromosome short tandem repeats (Y-STRs) are essential for differentiating between unrelated males and resolving the male component of admixed biological evidence.

While much work has been done to understand the neuronal signaling networks and intracellular signaling cascades associated with prolonged drug use, these studies have yielded few successful treatment options for substance use disorders. In recent years, there has been a growing interest to explore interactions between the peripheral immune system, the gut microbiome, and the CNS. In this review, we will present a summary of existing evidence, suggesting a potential role for gut dysbiosis in the pathogenesis of substance use disorders. Clinical evidence of gut dysbiosis in human subjects with substance use disorder and preclinical evidence of gut dysbiosis in animal models of drug addiction are discussed in detail. Additionally, we examine how changes in the gut microbiome and its metabolites may not only be a consequence of substance use disorders but may in fact play a role in mediating behavioral response to drugs of abuse. While much work still needs to be done, understanding the interplay of gut microbiome in substance use disorders may offer a promising avenue for future therapeutic development.","A single inhalation of vapor from dried toad secretion containing 5-methoxy-N,N-dimethyltryptamine (5-MeO-DMT) in a naturalistic setting is related to sustained enhancement of satisfaction with life, mindfulness-related capacities, and a decrement of psychopathological symptoms.",https://www.ncbi.nlm.nih.gov/pubmed/30982127,Psychopharmacology,2019 04 14,"5-methoxy-N,N-dimethyltryptamine (hereinafter referred to as 5-MeO-DMT) is a psychedelic substance found in the secretion from the parotoid glands of the Bufo alvarius toad.

As such, assessment of oculomotion is an invaluable part of a clinical examination and affords a non-invasive window on several key aspects of neuronal computation. While oculomotion is often used to detect deficits of the sort associated with vascular or neoplastic events; subtler (e.g. pharmacological) effects on neuronal processing also induce oculomotor changes. We have previously framed oculomotor control as part of active vision, namely, a process of inference comprising two distinct but related challenges. The first is inferring where to look, and the second is inferring how to implement the selected action. In this paper, we draw from recent theoretical work on the neuromodulatory control of active inference. This allows us to simulate the sort of changes we would expect in oculomotor behaviour, following pharmacological enhancement or suppression of key neuromodulators-in terms of deciding where to look and the ensuing trajectory of the eye movement itself. We focus upon the influence of cholinergic and GABAergic agents on the speed of saccades, and consider dopaminergic and noradrenergic effects on more complex, memory-guided, behaviour. In principle, a computational approach to understanding the relationship between pharmacology and oculomotor behaviour affords the opportunity to estimate the influence of a given pharmaceutical upon neuronal function, and to use this to optimise therapeutic interventions on an individual basis."

Activated carbon pieces were obtained by using a finite zig-zag graphene structure saturated with hydrogen atoms on the edges giving a pristine model with 70 carbon atoms and 22 hydrogen atoms. The zig-zag graphene structure was oxidized with -O, -COOH, -OH, and -O- groups. In this process, two identical groups were inserted over selected sites of the pristine model. All of these structures yielded ten IMI-AC adducts by using the PBE0-D3/6-31G* method, which predicts stable adducts at 0 K, and six of our models give negative free energies changes at room temperature. Thus, we expect that our IMI-AC models can be present when IMI interacts with an AC model. For one of the IMI-AC adducts, we applied solid-state techniques to avoid border effects, and we found that the imidacloprid is deprotonated giving reactive species, suggesting a new path to degrade this insecticide. Additionally, from this analysis, we proposed an additional IMI-AC adduct, which involves high free energy at room temperature. With this study, we show that our AC models can trap imidacloprid, which is quite convenient to remove this insecticide from our environment. Although it is well recognized that functionalized graphene structures are designed to trap some chemical compounds, to the best of our knowledge, this is the first time where IMI-graphene pieces interactions are studied in detail, and hydrogen bonds are analyzed through some scalar fields defined in quantum chemistry like the electron density and the non-covalent interactions index.",CRISPR/Cas9-mediated engineering of Escherichia coli for n-butanol production from xylose in defined medium.,https://www.ncbi.nlm.nih.gov/pubmed/30982114,Journal of industrial microbiology & biotechnology,2019 04 14,"Butanol production from agricultural residues is the most promising alternative for fossil fuels.

These outbreaks are frequently associated with bivalve shellfish consumption, particularly because these products are often eaten raw or only slightly cooked. In Morocco, regulations concerning the acceptable levels of enteric bacteria indicator organisms in these products have been put in place. However, these regulations do not take into account the risk of viral contamination, and many gastroenteritis outbreaks have been linked to the ingestion of bivalve shellfish from areas that comply with the current food safety criteria. The aim of this study was to investigate NoV presence in shellfish samples (n = 104) collected at four sites owcff Oualidia lagoon (Moroccan Atlantic coast) from November 2015 to February 2017. Samples were analysed using real-time RT-PCR in accordance with the ISO 15216-2 method. NoVs of the genogroup II were detected in 7% of samples that were all collected during the winter months. Moreover, 71% of NoV-positive samples were harvested at sites upstream of the lagoon.

Use of lossy files, including those processed with the JPEG algorithm, is highly discouraged due to effects of compression on pixel characteristics. However, with the growing popularity of whole-slide imaging (WSI) and its attendant large file sizes, compressed image files are becoming more prevelent. This prompted us to perform a color-based quantitative pixel analysis of minimally compressed WSI images. Sections from three tissues stained with one of three reagents representing the colors blue (hematoxylin), red (Oil-Red-O), and brown (immunoperoxidase) were scanned with a whole slide imager in triplicate at 20x, 40x, and 63x magnifications. The resulting files were in the form of a BigTIFF with a JPEG compression automatically applied during acquisition. Images were imported into analysis software, six regions of interest were applied to various morphological locations, and the areas assessed for the color of interest. Whereas the number of designated weakly or strongly positive pixels was variable across the triplicate scans for the individual regions of interest, the total number of positive pixels was consistent. These results suggest that total positivity for a specific color representing a histochemical or immunohistochemical stain can be adequately quantitated on compressed images, but degrees of positivity (e.g., weak vs. strong) may not be as reliable. However, it is important to assess individual whole-slide imagers, file compression level and algorithm, and analysis software for reproducibility.",Dissection of the genetic variation and candidate genes of lint percentage by a genome-wide association study in upland cotton.,https://www.ncbi.nlm.nih.gov/pubmed/30982110,TAG.

Despite the essential role of XYR1, the regulation of its expression in T. reesei cellulolytic response is poorly understood. In this study, we identified a transcription factor RXE1 exhibiting strong binding activity to the xyr1 promoter using yeast one-hybrid screen. RXE1 homologs exist in quite a few filamentous fungi but none of them have been assessed regarding their functional involvement in plant cell wall degradation. Knockdown of rxe1 in T. reesei using a copper-mediated RNAi system not only abrogated conidiation, but also remarkably compromised xyr1 and cellulase gene expression. The defective cellulase but not conidia production in the rxe1-knockdown strain was fully rescued by the constitutive expression of XYR1. Our study thus identified a novel transcriptional regulator controlling xyr1 and cellulase gene expression, which will contribute to elaborating the intricate network of cellulase gene regulation in T. reesei.","Levels of Volatile Carbonyl Compounds in the Atlantic Rainforest, in the City of Rio de Janeiro.",https://www.ncbi.nlm.nih.gov/pubmed/30982106,Bulletin of environmental contamination and toxicology,2019 05 30,"When Europeans arrived in America, the Brazilian Atlantic rainforest covered approximately 1,290,000 km2. Now, only 8% of the biome's original vegetation remains. One of the largest areas is Tijuca Forest National Park. In this work, the concentrations of 13 carbonyl compounds in an isolated area inside Tijuca Forest, in an urban park with primary and secondary vegetation (Gericinó Natural Park) and in two typical urban areas (Tijuca District and the city of Nilópolis) were determined. The main compounds were formaldehyde and acetaldehyde. The formaldehyde mean concentrations were 0.98 ± 1.00, 1.27 ± 1.67, 3.09 ± 1.60 and 2.33 ± 2.17 μg m-3 for Tijuca Forest, Gericinó Natural Park, Tijuca District and the city of Nilópolis, respectively. The mean acetaldehyde concentrations were, for the same locations, 0.93 ± 1.05, 2.94 ± 2.54, 2.78 ± 0.91 and 5.48 ± 1.90 μg m-3. The results indicate that the compounds measured within the forest are transported from the city and that the trees play an important role in removing air pollutants. In contrast, the Gericinó protected area is heavily affected by urban emissions, and its capacity to dilute or absorb pollutants is low because of the sparse vegetation."

Microglia/macrophage polarization is a mechanism involved in poststroke injury expansion. Considering the quick and obvious response of CKLF1 and expeditious evolution of stroke lesions, we focused on the effects of CKLF1 on microglial/macrophage polarization at early stage of ischemic stroke (IS). The present study is to investigate the CKLF1-mediated expression of microglia/macrophage phenotypes in vitro and in vivo, discussing the involved pathway. Primary microglia culture was used in vitro, and mice transient middle cerebral artery occlusion (MCAO) model was adopted to mimic IS. CKLF1 was added to the primary microglia for 24 h, and we found that CKLF1 modulated primary microglia skew toward M1 phenotype. In mice transient IS model, CKLF1 was stereotactically microinjected to the lateral ventricle of ischemic hemisphere. CKLF1 aggravated ischemic injury, accompanied by promoting microglia/macrophage toward M1 phenotypic polarization. Increased expression of pro-inflammatory cytokines and decreased expression of anti-inflammatory cytokines were observed in mice subjected to cerebral ischemia and administrated with CKLF1. CKLF1-/- mice were used to confirm the effects of CKLF1. CKLF1-/- mice showed lighter cerebral damage and decreased M1 phenotype of microglia/macrophage compared with the WT control subjected to cerebral ischemia. Moreover, NF-κB activation enhancement was detected in CKLF1 treatment group. Our results demonstrated that CKLF1 is an important mediator that skewing microglia/macrophage toward M1 phenotype at early stage of cerebral ischemic injury, which further deteriorates followed inflammatory response, contributing to early expansion of cerebral ischemia injury. Targeting CKLF1 may be a novel way for IS therapy.","Overlap of polymicrogyria, hydrocephalus, and Joubert syndrome in a family with novel truncating mutations in ADGRG1/GPR56 and KIAA0556.",https://www.ncbi.nlm.nih.gov/pubmed/30982090,Neurogenetics,2019 04 26,"Genetic mutations associated with brain malformations can lead to a spectrum of severity and it is often difficult to determine whether there are additional pathogenic variants contributing to the phenotype. Here, we present a family affected by a severe brain malformation including bilateral polymicrogyria, hydrocephalus, patchy white matter signal changes, and cerebellar and pontine hypoplasia with elongated cerebellar peduncles leading to the molar tooth sign. While the malformation is reminiscent of bilateral frontoparietal polymicrogyria (BFPP), the phenotype is more severe than previously reported and also includes features of Joubert syndrome (JBTS). Via exome sequencing, we identified homozygous truncating mutations in both ADGRG1/GPR56 and KIAA0556, which are known to cause BFPP and mild brain-specific JBTS, respectively. This study shows how two independent mutations can interact leading to complex brain malformations.",Role of urban ectomycorrhizal fungi in improving the tolerance of lodgepole pine (Pinus contorta) seedlings to salt stress.,https://www.ncbi.nlm.nih.gov/pubmed/30982089,Mycorrhiza,2019 04 14,"With large forested urban areas, the city of Edmonton, Alberta, Canada, faces high annual costs of replacing trees injured by deicing salts that are commonly used for winter road maintenance. Ectomycorrhizal fungi form symbiotic associations with tree roots that allow trees to tolerate the detrimental effects of polluted soils. Here, we examined mycorrhizal colonization of Pinus contorta by germinating seeds in soils collected from different locations: (1) two urban areas within the city of Edmonton, and (2) an intact pine forest just outside Edmonton. We then tested the responses of seedlings to 0-, 60-, and 90-mM NaCl. Our results showed lower abundance and diversity of ectomycorrhizal fungi in seedlings colonized with the urban soils compared to those from the pine forest soil. However, when subsequently exposed to NaCl treatments, only seedlings inoculated with one of the urban soils containing fungi from the genera Tuber, Suillus, and Wilcoxina, showed reduced shoot Na accumulation and higher growth rates. Our results indicate that local ectomycorrhizal fungi that are adapted to challenging urban sites may offer a potential suitable source for inoculum for conifer trees designated for plating in polluted urban environments.",A novel picornavirus in feces of a rainbow lorikeet (Trichoglossus moluccanus) shows a close relationship to members of the genus Avihepatovirus.,https://www.ncbi.nlm.nih.gov/pubmed/30982088,Archives of virology,2019 06 10,"A novel picornavirus, named ""lorikeet picornavirus 1"" (LoPV-1), was detected in a fecal sample from rainbow lorikeets using viral metagenomic analysis, and its complete genome sequence was determined and analyzed.

We searched the English and non-English literature on RAH through web search engines, text books and documents, and also referred to experts' comments. Non-English literature, other than in Japanese, was translated. Changes in the anatomical concept, anatomical identification, vascular control technique, approaches, pre-operative management, and other aspects of RAH were analyzed. Honjo and Lortat-Jacob, in 1949 and 1951, respectively, reported the first cases of successful RAH; since then, RAH has been used in the treatment of liver malignancies worldwide. Vascular in-flow control is divided into intrafascial, extrafascial or transfissual access. The anatomical border along the main hepatic veins was proposed for transection, and anterior approaches have been suggested as alternative options in the hazardous situation of right liver rotation. In the laparoscopic era, several procedures and positions have been devised for RAH. In summary, RAH and related anatomical hepatectomy have been established as treatment methods for 70 years, and the future of RAH includes new concepts, approaches, and techniques to optimize patient safety and disease curability.",Effectiveness of mindfulness-based cognitive therapy for comorbid depression and anxiety in pregnancy: a randomized controlled trial.,https://www.ncbi.nlm.nih.gov/pubmed/30982086,Archives of women's mental health,2019 04 14,"Pregnant women are at high risk of mood and anxiety disorders, and options for non-pharmacological treatment are limited. Mindfulness-based cognitive therapy (MBCT) has strong evidence among people with mood and anxiety disorders, but limited studies reported the effectiveness of MBCT on perinatal comorbid conditions. This study aimed to examine the effects of an 8-week MBCT intervention on pregnant women with comorbid depression and anxiety. In this randomized controlled study, 38 pregnant women with a diagnosis of depression and varying levels of comorbid anxiety disorders were randomly assigned to either MBCT or a control group. Scores on the Beck Depression Inventory-II, Beck Anxiety Inventory, Emotion Regulation Questionnaire, and Scales of Psychological Wellbeing were used as outcome measures at baseline, after MBCT, and through 1-month follow-up. Intent to treat analyses provided preliminary evidence that MBCT can be effective in reducing depressive and anxiety symptoms and in enhancing the use of adaptive emotion regulation strategies and psychological well-being. Improvements in outcomes were maintained 1 month. Results provide cross-cultural support for MBCT as a treatment for depression and anxiety in pregnant women. This brief and non-pharmacological treatment can be used to improve maternal psychological health."

The objective of this study was to investigate the association between community gardening and nutrition and physical health among adults. A systematic review and meta-analysis were conducted. Five electronic databases were searched systematically. Quality of included studies was appraised by several quality assessment tools related to the study design of each included article. Evidence from 19 articles was included (14 cross-sectional studies, 4 quasi-experimental studies and 1 case-control study). Although the majority of included studies appeared to have moderate quality, there existed weaknesses in the methods used, including low response rate and lack of confounder controls. Due to diversity in the measurement units, only body mass index (BMI) data could be pooled to perform meta-analysis. The results suggest that gardening had a significantly positive effect on BMI reduction. Subgroup analysis showed that quasi-experimental and case-control studies produced greater pooled effect size than those of cross-sectional design. Funnel plot and Egger's test showed no significant evidence of publication bias. As robust evidence for the effect of community gardening on BMI reduction was found, this intervention should be integrated in health promoting policy to improve population health.",Beyond positive a priori bias: reframing community engagement in LMICs.,https://www.ncbi.nlm.nih.gov/pubmed/30982066,Health promotion international,2019 04 14,"Showing the causal link between community engagement and improved health outcomes is a 'holy grail' of health policy. This article argues that this 'holy grail' has remained elusive because community engagement in primary health care is under-theorized, having been based on positive a priori assumptions, e.g. that people necessarily want to be engaged in governing their health system. By adopting a theory-driven approach and an agnostic premise, we show that understanding why, how and when community engagement may emerge or function spontaneously is important for informing efforts to support community engagement in primary health care primary health care governance. We draw on empirical research on community engagement in Nigeria and on the literature to identify the 'why' (coalition of service users can emerge in response to under-governance); the 'how' (five modes: through meetings; reaching out within their community; lobbying governments; augmenting government support; and taking control of service delivery) and the 'when' (as geographical, socio-economic and institutional context align, such that the benefits of action outweigh costs). Understanding the broad patterns of mechanisms and of contextual factors that apply across communities is, after all, our 'holy grail'-and this understanding should inform efforts to tailor support for community engagement in governance in different settings.",Glycosaminoglycans and vitamin C affect broiler bone parameters.,https://www.ncbi.nlm.nih.gov/pubmed/30982065,Poultry science,2019 04 14,"The purpose of this study was to determine if in ovo feeding and rearing with glycosaminoglycans and vitamin C could influence bone and cartilage macroscopy, mineral composition, mineral density and surface area, bone breaking strength, and bone histology in broilers. Fertile eggs from breeders (Cobb) were either uninjected or injected with 4 μg of additive/100 μL water on day 4 of incubation. Every 100 g of in ovo additive contained 30 g of chondroitin sulfate, 30 g of glucosamine, and 5 g of vitamin C. After hatching, the chicks from both incubation treatments were submitted to additional treatments during the growth phase from 1 to 42 D of age (diet without and with 0.74 g of additive/kg of feed). Every 100 kg of feed contained 30 g of glucosamine sulfate, 24 g of chondroitin sulfate, and 20 g of vitamin C. A completely randomized factorial design (2 × 2) was applied. The data were submitted to variance analysis using the general linear model procedure of SAS (SAS Institute). In ovo feeding with 4 μg of additive plus dietary supplementation with 0.74 g of additive/kg of feed resulted in the highest cartilage weight of the femur proximal epiphysis in birds (P = 0.0098). The highest ash, phosphorus and calcium percentage, mineral density and mineral composition were identified for femur and tibia in the following treatments: in ovo feeding plus diet without additive during rearing, or uninjected eggs plus dietary supplementation during rearing. In ovo feeding with 4 μg of the additive reduced (P = 0.0008) the number of chondrocytes in the proximal epiphysis of the tibia cartilage and increased (P < 0.0001) the number of osteocytes in the tibia diaphysis of broilers. We conclude that in ovo feeding or dietary supplementation during broiler rearing with glycosaminoglycans (chondroitin sulfate and glucosamine sulfate) and vitamin C benefits the development of bird bones and cartilage, and may represent a solution to bone problems in broilers.",Restriction of dietary non-phytate phosphorus on growth performance and expression of intestinal phosphate cotransporter genes in broilers.,https://www.ncbi.nlm.nih.gov/pubmed/30982064,Poultry science,2019 04 14,"Effects of dietary non-phytate phosphorus (nPP) restriction on growth and duodenal type IIb sodium-dependent phosphate cotransporter (NaPi-IIb) genes were observed. A total of 432 one-day old Cobb500 male broiler chickens in 36 cage pens were divided into 6 groups with each group containing 6 pens. Each group was treated with one of the diets containing 0.33, 0.37, 0.41, 0.45, 0.49, and 0.53% of nPP up to 14 D. During 15 to 31 D, birds were treated with one of the diets containing 0.23, 0.27, 0.31, 0.35, 0.39, and 0.43% of nPP. Level of Ca was kept the same across all treatments. Dietary nPP level influenced (P < 0.001) weight gain and feed intake in both growth phases, whereas effect on feed per gain ratio was seen only in the second phase. Toe ash, tibia ash, and tibia breaking strength responded to treatments (P < 0.01) at 14 D. Only tibia ash content was significantly improved (P < 0.001) at 31 D. Growth and bone parameters linearly improved with an increase in dietary nPP content (P < 0.05). Above dietary nPP 0.41% and 0.31% for first phase and second phase, respectively, no significant improvement was seen. Duodenal NaPi-IIb mRNA overexpressed with a decrease in dietary nPP in both phases (P < 0.05). Relative expression of NaPi-IIb in lowest nPP group were 2.2 folds higher in the first phase and 3.6 folds higher in the second phase compared to respective highest nPP groups of each phase. No significant change in NaPi-IIb expression was seen above 0.37% of dietary nPP for 14 D and 0.31% of dietary nPP for 31 D. Dietary requirements of nPP 0.41% for 0 to 14 D and 0.31% for 15 to 31 D were adequate for optimal growth and bone parameters.

Not all of the probiotics reduced NH3 emissions. Pichia farinose, Bacillus coagulans, Lactobacillus plantarum, Pichia guilliermondii, and Bacillus subtilis reduced NH3 production by approximately 35.1 to 39%. Compared with the control group, the greatest NH3 inhibition was achieved via the combined application of P. guilliermondii, B. subtilis, and L. plantarum at 1:2:1, resulting in a 46% reduction. Effective probiotics use decreased crude protein digestibility, pH, ammonium nitrogen, valerate levels, and urease and uricase activity, but increased urea, purine trione, nitrate nitrogen, total volatile fatty acids, and acetate levels. The relative abundance of the bacteria responsible for fermenting carbohydrates to produce short fatty acids was increased. Under different treatments, the KEGG Orthology (KO) metabolic pathways of NH3 production and utilization were diverse. Hence, the application of probiotics to control NH3 emissions is dependent on the types and combined ratio of the organisms involved.","Effects of in ovo injection of L-ascorbic acid on growth performance, carcass composition, plasma antioxidant capacity, and meat quality in broiler chickens1,2,3.",https://www.ncbi.nlm.nih.gov/pubmed/30982062,Poultry science,2019 04 14,"The current study was designed to investigate the effects of the in ovo injection of different dosages of L-ascorbic acid (AA) on posthatch growth performance, carcass characteristics, plasma antioxidant capacity, and meat quality in broiler chickens. A total of 2,220 Ross 708 broiler hatching eggs containing live embryos at 17 D of incubation were subjected to 1 of 6 treatments (trt): non-injected control, saline-injected control, or saline containing 3, 6, 12 or 36 mg of AA. An Inovoject m semi-automatic multi-egg injector was used to inject a 100 μL volume of sterile saline (0.85%) alone or containing the different AA dosage into each egg. After hatch, 14 male hatchlings from each trt group were randomly selected and placed in each of 10 replicate floor pens for growth performance evaluation through 45 D posthatch. Chicks from the 3 and 6 mg AA trt groups had a higher average daily BW gain and a higher feed intake compared to the saline-injected control group during the grower phase. Chicks in the 12 mg AA trt group exhibited a better feed efficiency in the late finisher phase and the entire growing phase than those in the saline-injected control group. Higher thigh and leg percentages were observed in chicks from the 3 and 6 mg AA trt groups than in the non-injected control group. Compared to the non-injected or saline-injected control groups, birds in the 12 mg AA trt group were observed to have a lower plasma malondialdehyde content during the grower and finisher phases, and breast muscle tenderness was elevated in chicks from the 36 mg AA trt group. Taken together, these results suggest that the in ovo injection of AA (3 to 12 mg per egg) have lasting positive effects on the posthatch growth, leg muscle development, and systemic antioxidant capacity of broilers. Higher injected dosages of AA (36 mg per egg) may also have the potential to improve broiler meat quality.","Effects of preslaughter shackling on postmortem glycolysis, meat quality, changes of water distribution, and protein structures of broiler breast meat.",https://www.ncbi.nlm.nih.gov/pubmed/30982061,Poultry science,2019 04 14,"The objective of this study was to investigate the effects of preslaughter shackling on stress, postmortem glycolysis, meat quality, water distribution, and protein structures of pectoralis majors.

Each treatment group consisted of 5 replicates with 7 broilers each. Results indicated that preslaughter shackling increased (P < 0.05) plasma corticosterone and adrenocorticotropic hormone concentrations in comparison with the control group. Antemortem shackling increased (P < 0.05) activity of glycogen phosphorylase and phosphofructokinase-1 (PFK-1) accompanying with rapid glycolysis and pH decline at early postmortem. LS treatment led to myosin denaturation, decreased (P < 0.05) α-helix content, and increased (P < 0.05) β-sheet structures proportion in the myofibrillar proteins. Furthermore, meat from LS treatment had higher (P < 0.05) lightness, redness, and poorer water-holding capacity. These results indicated that the longer shackling duration (4.5 min) increased stress and the rate of glycolysis, causing myosin denaturation and changes of the secondary structure in the myofibrillar proteins, which aggravated the deterioration of meat quality.",Fetal growth restriction is associated with an altered cardiopulmonary and cerebral hemodynamic response to surfactant therapy in preterm lambs.,https://www.ncbi.nlm.nih.gov/pubmed/30982059,Pediatric research,2019 04 17,Efficacy of surfactant therapy in fetal growth restricted (FGR) preterm neonates is unknown.,En-Bloc Pediatric Kidney Transplant to Adult Recipient with Two Different Ureterovesical Anastomosis Techniques.,https://www.ncbi.nlm.nih.gov/pubmed/30982058,The American journal of case reports,2019 05 02,"BACKGROUND En-bloc kidney transplantation from a small pediatric donor to an adult recipient has become more common owing to the shortage of deceased donor kidneys. In pediatric en-bloc kidney transplantation, ureterovesical anastomosis can be done either via ureteroneocystostomy or via partial bladder wall transplantation. We report 2 cases of en bloc kidney transplantation from a pediatric deceased donor to an adult recipient using different ureterovesical anastomosis methods and the long-term outcomes. CASE REPORT Two pediatric en-bloc kidney transplantations to adult recipients were performed at our center. One case used a graft bladder segment from a 5-month-old male donor that was transplanted to a 45-year-old adult male recipient using the bladder patch technique and one case used 4-year-old male donor kidneys transplanted to a 54-year-old adult male recipient via ureteroneocystostomy with ureteroplasty for ureterovesical anastomosis. Both recipients have shown normal renal function and normal voiding, without urinary complications, such as vesico-ureteral reflux and ureter stricture, during the follow-up period. CONCLUSIONS These 2 case reports suggest that using small pediatric en-bloc kidneys would be a viable option to overcome the increasing shortage of donor kidneys for transplantation regardless of the method of ureterovesical anastomosis.",lncRNA Colorectal Neoplasia Differentially Expressed (CRNDE) Promotes Proliferation and Inhibits Apoptosis in Non-Small Cell Lung Cancer Cells by Regulating the miR-641/CDK6 Axis.,https://www.ncbi.nlm.nih.gov/pubmed/30982057,Medical science monitor : international medical journal of experimental and clinical research,2019 05 03,"BACKGROUND The lncRNA Colorectal Neoplasia Differentially Expressed (CRNDE) gene has been reported as a potential oncogene in NSCLC. Nevertheless, the molecular mechanism of CRNDE in NSCLC progression remains largely unknown. MATERIAL AND METHODS qRT-PCR assay was performed to detect the expression levels of CRNDE, miR-641, and cyclin-dependent kinase 6 (CDK6) in NSCLC. Western blot assay was employed to assess CDK6 protein level in treated NSCLC cells. si-CRNDE#1, si-CRNDE#2, miR-641 mimics, miR-641 inhibitors, or Vector-CDK6 were transfected into NSCLC cells to change the expression levels of CRNDE, miR-641, or CDK6. Dual-luciferase reporter assay was performed to validate the direct interrelated miRNA of CRNDE and the potential target of miR-641. MTT and flow cytometry assays were performed to assess the capacities of cell proliferation and apoptosis, respectively. RESULTS CRNDE level was upregulated in NSCLC, and its knockdown suppressed NSCLC cells proliferation and enhanced apoptosis, whereas miR-641 antagonized the regulatory effect of CRNDE knockdown by directly binding to CRNDE. Moreover, CDK6 was a target of miR-641 and miR-641 exerted anti-proliferation and pro-apoptosis effects through CDK6. CONCLUSIONS CRNDE promoted proliferation and inhibited apoptosis of NSCLC cells at least in part by regulating the miR-641/CDK6 axis, suggesting that CRNDE is a potential therapeutic target for NSCLC treatment."

We employed LBW, generated via uterine artery ablation, and normal birth weight (NBW) male guinea pigs fed either a WD or control diet (CD) from weaning to postnatal day 150 (early adulthood). Hepatic steatosis was absent in CD-fed offspring, while NBW/WD offspring displayed macrovesicular steatosis and LBW/WD offspring exhibited microvesicular steatosis, both occurring in a lean phenotype. Life-long consumption of the WD, irrespective of birth weight, was associated with an increase in hepatic medium- and long-chain saturated fatty acids, monounsaturated fatty acids, acylcarnitines, reduced oxidative phosphorylation complex III activity and polyunsaturated fatty acids, and molecular evidence of disrupted hepatic insulin signaling. In NBW/WD, hepatic C15:1 and C16:1n-6 fatty acids in phospholipids, C16, C18 and C18:1 acylcarnitines, concentrations of aspartate, phenylalanine, tyrosine and tryptophan and expression of carnitine palmitoyltransferase 1 alpha (CPT1α) and uncoupling protein 2 (UCP2) genes were elevated compared to LBW/WD livers. Our results suggest that LBW and life-long WD combined are influential in promoting hepatic microvesicular steatosis in conjunction with a specific mitochondrial gene expression and metabolomic profile in early adulthood."

The screen-printed carbon electrode (SPCE) was modified by phosphorene-gold nanocomposite onto which an aptamer specific to OA was immobilized. BP-Au nanocomposites were synthesized by an in-situ, one-step method without the use of a reducing agent. Potassium ferro-ferri cyanide was used as a redox pair to quantify signal strength.

During final maturation in vivo a switch from oestradiol (E2) to progesterone (P4) dominance within the follicle is well-described. This change is accompanied by the resumption of meiosis and results in the maturation of the oocyte. It also suggests the important role of these hormones. However, present in vitro maturation (IVM) systems do not completely mimic the in vivo situation, resulting in oocytes of reduced quality. Aim of the study was to determine the temporal pattern of steroid hormone concentrations in the IVM medium of bovine cumulus-oocyte-complexes (COC) at defined time points. The influence of different gonadotropin supplementations during IVM on oocyte maturation, as well as the molecular quality of the oocytes and their corresponding cumulus cells was investigated. COCs were obtained from abattoir-derived ovaries and matured in medium added with different compounds of gonadotropins (eCG/hCG; FSH/LH, each at 0.05 IU or 0.01 IU; only FSH; without gonadotropins) employing a standard protocol without oil overlay. In experiment 1, medium, oocytes and cumulus cells were collected at different time points (0 h [control], 4 h, 8 h, 12 h, 16 h, 20 h, 24 h) after IVM in just eCG/hCG-supplemented medium. In experiment 2, medium, oocytes and cumulus cells were collected at 0 h (control) and after 24 h of IVM with all above-named supplements. The E2 concentration remained similar during IVM whereas P4 concentration increased during experiment 1. No significant changes could be determined after the addition of different gonadotropins (experiment 2). These results suggest that during IVM the temporal pattern of E2 and P4 did not correspond with the pattern during final maturation in vivo. RT-qPCR was used to assess the relative abundance of developmentally important genes in oocytes (BMP15; GDF9; ZAR1; PGR; PGRMC1/2; G6PD; StAR; ESR1/2; SULT1E1; STS; SOAT) and cumulus cells (ESR1/2; FSHR; LHCGR; CYP19A1; HSD3B1; PGR; PGRMC1/2; SULT1E1; STS; SOAT) at all collection points in both experiments. Most transcripts follow a time-regulated mRNA expression pattern during the entire in vitro maturation period. In addition, the expression of the analyzed transcripts was not influenced by the different gonadotropin supplementations during the IVM period. In all, this underlines that present conditions of IVM do not reflect the in vivo situation and require further optimisation.","Comparative effectiveness of different biochars and conventional organic materials on growth, photosynthesis and cadmium accumulation in cereals.",https://www.ncbi.nlm.nih.gov/pubmed/30981972,Chemosphere,2019 05 13,"Although biochar and conventional organic materials have been widely studied for lowering cadmium (Cd) uptake by plants but information regarding their comparative effectiveness is lacking. In this study, biochars from different feedstocks viz. rice husk biochar (RHB), cotton sticks biochar (CSB) and wheat straw biochar (WSB) were compared with conventional organic materials viz. farm manure (FM), poultry manure (PM) and press mud (PrMd) for their effectiveness to promote plant growth and to reduce Cd uptake by wheat and rice plants grown rotationally in a Cd-spiked (50 mg kg-1) soil. Each amendment was applied at the rate of 2% (w/w) in three replicates. Results showed that the application of amendments improved the soil properties and plant growth, by retaining Cd in the soil and restricting its uptake by plants. The amendments decreased the ammonium bicarbonate diethylene penta acetic acid extractable soil Cd, and improved soil organic carbon (SOC) and cation exchange capacity (CEC) as compared to only Cd-contaminated soil. The highest SOC content of 2.68 and 1.68% and CEC of 8.77 and 9.39 cmolc kg-1 were found in RHB treated post-wheat and post-rice soil, respectively. Amendments treated soil showed lower concentrations of bioavailable Cd and the maximum reduction was recorded in RHB and PrMd amended soil. Similarly, bioaccumulation of Cd was decreased with the application of all amendments; the maximum decrease was recorded in RHB and PrMd treated soil. Our results suggested that RHB and PrMd could be used for reducing the bioaccumulation of Cd in cereal grains in alkaline soils.",Biochar-supported magnetic noble metallic nanoparticles for the fast recovery of excessive reductant during pollutant reduction.,https://www.ncbi.nlm.nih.gov/pubmed/30981971,Chemosphere,2019 05 13,"The catalytic reduction of diverse pollutants by noble metal catalysts in the presence of reductants is a highly effective and widely used method. However, the considerable cost of noble metal catalysts impedes the practical application of this method, and the recovery of excessive reductants has not been reported previously. In this work, we prepared inexpensive biochar-supported magnetic noble metallic nanoparticles (NPs) and efficiently recovered the excessive reductants in the form of H2. The as-synthesized biochar-supported noble metallic NPs exhibited high H2 recovery during the 4-nitrophenol reduction reaction. Results showed that the catalysts with low noble metallic content have higher H2 recovery rate than commercial Pd/C, Ag/C, and Pt/C. The catalytic mechanism of magnetic biochar-supported noble metallic NPs was demonstrated to be a ""synergetic effect"", where biochar and Fe3O4 acted as accelerants that enable noble metallic NPs to produce active hydrogen for the reduction reaction, and the excess active hydrogen atoms combined to form H2.","Personal exposure to PM2.5-bound organic species from domestic solid fuel combustion in rural Guanzhong Basin, China: Characteristics and health implication.",https://www.ncbi.nlm.nih.gov/pubmed/30981970,Chemosphere,2019 05 13,"Domestic solid fuels combustion produces a mass of fine particulate matter (PM2.5). PM2.5-bound organics, including polycyclic aromatic hydrocarbons (PAHs), oxygenated-PAHs (OPAHs), phthalate esters (PAEs) and hopanes, were quantified in indoor, outdoor and personal exposure samples collected in rural Guanzhong Basin, China. The average concentration of total quantified PAHs in personal exposure samples was 310 ± 443 ng m-3, 1.5 times of those of indoor (211 ± 120 ng m-3) and outdoor (189 ± 115 ng m-3). Similar observations were found for the OPAHs and PAEs, i.e., much higher concentrations were seen in personal exposure samples. Hopanes average personal exposure concentration (13 ± 9.7 ng m-3) was comparable to indoors (15 ± 9.7 ng m-3) and outdoors (13 ± 9.6 ng m-3). Among four common heating ways applied in Chinese dwelling, the highest exposure levels to PAHs, OPAHs and PAEs were found for indoor coal chunks stoves. Concentration under electric power was 1.2-4.5 folds lower than those with solid fuels in this study, proved to be the cleanest energy for the household heating. The exposures to PM2.5 on cell viabilities were also investigated. The largest reduction of 70% on cell viabilities was seen for indoor coal chunks stove housewives, indicating that the emissions from coal combustion had the greatest cytotoxic effects. The results evidenced that the heating ways in rural area could greatly impact on the housewife health in northwestern China. Advanced heating technology and protection should be conducted to reduce the personal exposures to PM2.5 from domestic solid fuel combustions.",Cylindrospermopsin induces cellular stress and activation of ERK1/2 and p38 MAPK pathways in adult human liver stem cells.,https://www.ncbi.nlm.nih.gov/pubmed/30981969,Chemosphere,2019 05 13,"Cyanobacterial toxin cylindrospermopsin (CYN) is an emerging freshwater contaminant, whose expanding environmental occurrence might result into increased human health risks. CYN is potent hepatotoxin, with cytotoxicity and genotoxicity documented in primary hepatocytes or hepatoma cell lines. However, there is only limited information about CYN effects on adult human liver stem cells (LSCs), which play an important role in liver tissue development, regeneration and repair. In our study with human liver cell line HL1-hT1 which expresses characteristics of LSCs, CYN was found to be cytotoxic and increasing cell death after 24-48 h exposure to concentrations >1 μM. Subcytotoxic 1 μM concentration did not induce cell death or membrane damage, but inhibited cellular processes related to energy production, leading to a growth stagnation after >72 h. Interestingly, these effects were not associated with increased DNA damage, reactive oxygen species production, or endoplasmic reticulum stress. However, CYN induced a sustained (24-48 h) activation of mitogen-activated protein kinases ERK1/2 and p38, and increased expression of stress-related transcription factor ATF3. Thus, LSCs were not primarily affected by CYN-induced genotoxicity and oxidative stress, but via activation of signaling and transcriptional pathways critical for regulation of cell proliferation, stress responses, cell survival and inflammation. Alterations of LSCs during CYN-induced liver injury, including the role of nongenotoxic mechanisms, should be therefore considered in mechanistic assessments of chronic CYN hepatotoxicity and hepatocarcinogenicity.",Conventional and fourier transform infrared characterization of waste and leachate during municipal solid waste stabilization.,https://www.ncbi.nlm.nih.gov/pubmed/30981968,Chemosphere,2019 05 13,"Solid waste and leachate samples from bench-scale anaerobic bioreactors and flushing bioreactors (FBs), containing mature waste were characterized using Fourier Transform Infrared Spectroscopy (FTIR) to provide a better understanding of the changes in waste characteristics when waste transitions from mature to stabilized. Humic acid (HA) extracted from mature waste and waste removed from the FBs were characterized using FTIR and 13C nuclear magnetic resonance. FBs were operated under three different treatment scenarios (flushing with clean water, recirculation of leachate treated by chemical oxidation, and recirculation of leachate treated by chemical oxidation with waste aeration. FTIR spectra of FB waste and leachate supported the stabilization of waste that occurred after the additional treatment. There was a shift in the dominance of organic to inorganic functional groups when compared to changes in conventional parameters that aligned with published values on waste stability. HA extracted from the mature waste were dominated by aliphatic carbon and aromatic carbon was less intense. Treatment by flushing resulted in a decrease in aliphatic carbon and an increase in aromatic carbon. HA extracted from reactors with oxidized leachate recirculation and aeration decreased in aliphatic carbon content, with minimal change in aromatic carbon. Therefore, the additional treatment did not result in an increase in the reactivity potential of the HA which aligns with FTIR and principal component analysis. Results suggest that spectroscopic techniques could be used to assess the stability of waste samples as opposed to more time-consuming analyses.",NOB suppression in partial nitritation-anammox (PNA) process by discharging aged flocs: Performance and microbial community dynamics.,https://www.ncbi.nlm.nih.gov/pubmed/30981967,Chemosphere,2019 05 13,"The partial nitritation-anammox (PNA) process is the most promising technique to treat municipal sewage; however, nitrite oxidizing bacteria (NOB) are a hindrance to achieve PNA. This study investigated the effects of selectively discharging flocs (<200 μm) to washout NOB in a sequencing batch reactor (SBR) over 200 d. The experiment was divided into three phases with different floc sludge retention times (SRTs; 30, 20 and 30 d). When the SRT of the flocs was reduced from 30 to 20 d to washout NOB, a significant reduction of ammonia oxidizing bacteria (AOB) and anaerobic ammonium-oxidizing (anammox) bacteria in the flocs was found. This indicates that a low floc SRT (20 d) leads to the loss of AOB and anammox bacteria in the flocs (<200 μm) and destroys PNA. Activity tests and qPCR analysis revealed the variations of functional bacteria in the granules and flocs, indicating that the enrichment of AOB, NOB, anammox bacteria in the granules is caused by the long-term discharging of flocs. High-throughput sequencing analysis revealed that the microbial shift of Tetrasphaera was significant in the flocs and may be connected to the enrichment of anammox bacteria and the stability of the PNA requires further research. All the obtained NOB sequences were affiliated with the genera Nitrospira and could further influence the PNA system. Overall, this study provides an in-depth understanding of the impact of discharging flocs to washout NOB and promotes the application of combing granules/floc PNA in sewage treatment.",Water-in-oil Pickering emulsions stabilized by an interfacial complex of water-insoluble polyphenol crystals and protein.,https://www.ncbi.nlm.nih.gov/pubmed/30981966,Journal of colloid and interface science,2019 05 04,"Long term stabilization of water-in-oil (W/O) emulsions remains a particularly challenging problem in colloid science. Recent studies have shown that polyphenols act as Pickering stabilizers at the water-oil interface. In this work we propose a novel way to stabilize water droplets via interfacial complex formation. It was observed that polyphenol crystals (curcumin or quercetin) absorb at the interface and provide stabilization of water droplets for several days; however formation of a polyphenol- whey protein (WPI) complex at the water-oil interface revealed a pronounced improvement in the stabilization. The mechanism of complex formation was tested by subjecting the systems to different environmental conditions, such as ionic strength and temperature. The evidence suggests that the complex is probably stabilized by electrostatic attraction between the oppositely-charged polyphenol particles and protein at the interface, although hydrogen bonding between the two components may also contribute. The resulting stable water droplets have a Sauter mean diameter (D3,2) of approximately ∼22 and ∼27 μm for curcumin and quercetin systems, respectively. Emulsions were more stable at pH 3 than at pH 7, due to either weaker complex formation at pH 7 and/or chemical degradation of the polyphenols at this more alkaline pH. Interfacial shear viscosity measurements confirmed that there was strong interfacial complex formation with aqueous WPI concentrations of ∼0.5 wt.%."

The transition of oxfendazole, a potent broad-spectrum anthelmintic with long half-life, from veterinary medicine to human use has been considered as a promising approach. However, analytical methods for the quantitative detection of oxfendazole in human matrix are very limited and lack sensitivity. In this study, we have developed a high-performance liquid chromatography-tandem mass spectrometry (LC/MS/MS) method for the quantification of oxfendazole in human plasma using albendazole as an internal standard. The established method was fully validated with lower limit of quantitation (LLOQ) of 0.5 ng/mL and linearity in the range of 0.5-1000 ng/mL; intra-day and inter-day accuracies ranged from 2.6 to 9.5% for 3 quality control levels (1.5 ng/mL, 75 ng/mL, and 750 ng/mL) and LLOQ; intra-day and inter-day precision was ≤13.6% for quality controls and ≤15.1% for LLOQ; matrix factor and extraction recovery were consistent with coefficient of variation of less than 15.0%. Other parameters including matrix selectivity, injection carryover, reinjection reproducibility, hemolysis effect, interference of analyte with internal standard, dilution integrity, freeze/thaw stability, whole blood stability, and stock solution stability were also validated and met the acceptance criteria. The assay was successfully applied to quantify oxfendazole plasma concentration in healthy adult volunteers after the administration of multiple oral doses of oxfendazole.","Pain experienced by infants and toddlers at urine collection bag removal: A randomized, controlled, clinical trial.",https://www.ncbi.nlm.nih.gov/pubmed/30981953,International journal of nursing studies,2019 06 03,"In pre-continent children, collection bags are frequently used as a first-line option to obtain a urine specimen.

Nevertheless, toxicity emission under fire conditions remains a major concern, particularly in building fire scenarios. To circumvent the problem, it is imperative that an effective flame retardant is sought to suppress the flame and release of combustion/smoke products whilst maintaining the favorable material properties of TPU. In the current work, a simple method is proposed for the preparation and utilization of cetyltrimethyl ammonium bromide (CTAB) and tetrabutyl phosphine chloride (TBPC) modified Ti3C2 (MXene) ultra-thin nanosheets. During the cone calorimeter tests, significant reduction in peak heat release rate (51.2% and 52.2%), peak smoke production rate (57.1% and 57.4%), peak CO production (39.4% and 41.6%) and peak CO2 production (49.7% and 51.7%) were recorded by the mere introduction of 2 wt.% CTAB-Ti3C2 and TBPC-Ti3C2 to TPU. These superior fire safety properties resulting from the significant reduction of the fire, smoke and toxicity hazards are attributed to the excellent dispersion, catalytic and barrier effect of Ti3C2 ultra-thin nanosheets in TPU. Future applications of exfoliated MXene nanosheets as flame retardant appear to be very promising.",Rethinking suicides as mental accidents: Towards a new paradigm.,https://www.ncbi.nlm.nih.gov/pubmed/30981951,Journal of affective disorders,2019 05 15,"Since its beginnings, suicide research has made great progress in terms of empirical findings.

Previous studies have reported that peripheral auditory impairment induces AC plasticity that involves changes in the balance of excitatory vs. inhibitory synapses, within existing and newly forming patterns of connectivity. Although we know that such plastic changes modulate sound-evoked neural responses and the organization of tonotopic maps in the primary AC (A1), little is known about the effects of peripheral impairment on other frequency-organized AC subfields, such as the anterior auditory field (AAF) and the secondary auditory cortex (A2). Therefore, to examine ototoxic-drug-induced spatiotemporal effects on AC subfields, we measured sound-evoked neural activity in mice before and after the administration of kanamycin sulfate (1 mg/g body weight) and bumetanide (0.05 mg/g body weight), using in vivo transcranial flavoprotein autofluorescence imaging over a 4-week period. At first, ototoxic treatment gradually reduced responses driven by tone bursts with lower- (≤8 kHz) and middle- (e.g., 16 kHz) range frequencies in all AC subfields. Subsequently, response intensities in the A1 recovered to more than 78% of the pre-drug condition; however, in the AAF and A2, they remained significantly lower and were unchanged over 3 weeks. Furthermore, after drug administration, the best frequency (BF) areas of the lower (4 and 8 kHz) and higher (25 and 32 kHz) ranges in all subfields were reduced and shifted to those of a middle range (centered around 16 kHz) during the 3 weeks following drug administration. Our results also indicated that, compared with A1, BF distributions in the AAF and A2 were sharper around 16 kHz 3 weeks after drug administration. These results indicate that the ototoxic-damage-induced tonotopic map reorganizations that occurred in each of the three AC subfields were similar, but that there were subfield-dependent differences in the extent of response intensities and in the activated areas that were responsive to tone bursts with specific frequencies. Thus, by examining cortical reorganization induced by ototoxic drugs, we may contribute to the understanding of how this reorganization can be caused by peripheral damage.",Development of resiquimod-loaded modified PLA-based nanoparticles for cancer immunotherapy: A kinetic study.,https://www.ncbi.nlm.nih.gov/pubmed/30981947,European journal of pharmaceutics and biopharmaceutics : official journal of Arbeitsgemeinschaft fur Pharmazeutische Verfahrenstechnik e.V,2019 05 05,"Resiquimod (R848), a member of the imidazoquinoline family, is a Toll-like receptor 7/8 agonist with high potency for cancer immunotherapy. However, tolerance induction and adverse effects limit its development as a drug. Encapsulation in a polymer matrix can circumvent these limitations, as shown in our formerly published approach where R848 was loaded into polylactic acid (PLA)-based nanoparticles (NP). Although the results were encouraging, low rates of encapsulation and rapid release of the drug were observed. In this study, we present a new strategy using mixed NP from modified linear PLA in order to improve the encapsulation and modulate the release profile of R848. Modified PLA polymers were designed and synthesized by microwave-assisted ring opening polymerization of d,l-lactide, using polyethylene glycol as initiator to increase the hydrophilic properties of the polymer or linear saturated aliphatic chains (C8 or C20) to increase the affinity with hydrophobic R848. NP were prepared by solvent evaporation method, leading to particles of 205-288 nm loaded with either R848 or DiO as a tracking agent. The release profile showed longer retention of R848 at both neutral and acidic pH for NP from grafted polymers. Upon exposure to phagocytic immune cells, NP were actively taken up by the cells and no impact on cell viability was observed, independently of the constitutive polymer. All R848-loaded NP activated macrophages to secrete interleukin-6, demonstrating that the drug cargo was immunologically active. Importantly, macrophage activation by NP-delivered R848 was slower than with free R848, in accordance with the in vitro release profiles. Thus, NP prepared from modified PLA polymers showed no signs of toxicity to immune cells and efficiently delivered their immunoactive cargo in a delayed manner. This delivery strategy may enhance the efficacy and safety of small-molecule immunostimulants.",Development and in vitro evaluation of pressure sensitive adhesive patch for the transdermal delivery of galantamine: Effect of penetration enhancers and crystallization inhibition.,https://www.ncbi.nlm.nih.gov/pubmed/30981946,European journal of pharmaceutics and biopharmaceutics : official journal of Arbeitsgemeinschaft fur Pharmazeutische Verfahrenstechnik e.V,2019 05 05,"The transdermal route offers an attractive alternative route of drug administration especially for Alzheimer's disease patients through eliminating gastrointestinal side effects and ultimately improving compliance. In this study, we prepared an optimized matrix-type patches for the transdermal delivery of galantamine free base with ex vivo and in vitro evaluation. Four pressure sensitive adhesives with different functional groups, ten penetration enhancers and four drug loadings were tested to determine the optimized patch. The ex vivo permeation of the different formulated patches through human cadaver skin using vertical Franz diffusion cells showed that GELVA GMS 788 was the best pressure sensitive adhesive among the tested polymers. FT-IR and rheological studies done to investigate any potential interactions of the polymer with the drug and/or additives showed the possibility of hydrogen bonding between the drug and pressure sensitive adhesive (PSA), also the additives had a plasticization effect causing increased flexibility of the polymer chains. The optimized formulation had 10%w/w drug loading, 5% w/w limonene as a penetration enhancer, and 5%w/w oleic acid as a crystallization inhibitor. The combination of limonene and oleic acid increased the flux of galantamine by 2.7-fold compared to 1.7-fold when limonene was used alone.

Nonetheless, the BLM has only rarely been validated for trivalent metals (e.g. rare earth elements), and the potential competitive effects of protons has been understudied. In this paper, the short-term biouptake of indium (In), a trivalent metal that is a byproduct of zinc extraction and used in numerous applications including the semiconductor industry, was evaluated under controlled conditions. Short-term (i.e. 60 min) indium biouptake by Chlamydomonas reinhardtii was measured as a function of pH in order to verify the validity of the BLM. At a given pH, In biouptake could be well described by the Michaelis-Menten equation with conditional stability constants of KIn,pH=4.0 = 106.7 M-1, KIn,pH=5.0 = 108.6 M-1, KIn,pH=6.0 = 109.3 M-1 and maximum internalization fluxes of Jmax, pH=4.0 = 0.74 × 10-14 mol cm-2 s-1, Jmax, pH=5.0 = 1.60 × 10-14 mol cm-2 s-1, Jmax, pH=6.0 = 2.22 × 10-14 mol cm-2 s-1. Although several potential mechanisms for the role of pH were examined, the results were best explained by a competitive interaction of H+ with the In uptake sites using overall stability constants of logKIn = 9.76 M-1 and logKH = 15.66 M-1. Based on these results, pH will play a critical role in bioavailability measurements of the trivalent cations in natural waters.","Widespread occurrence and spatial distribution of glyphosate, atrazine, and neonicotinoids pesticides in the St. Lawrence and tributary rivers.",https://www.ncbi.nlm.nih.gov/pubmed/30981933,"Environmental pollution (Barking, Essex : 1987)",2019 05 25,"The occurrence and spatial distribution of selected pesticides were investigated along a 200-km reach of the St. Lawrence River (SLR) and tributaries in Quebec, Canada. Surface water samples (n = 68) were collected in the summer 2017 and analyzed for glyphosate, atrazine (ATZ), 8 systemic insecticides (acetamiprid, clothianidin, dinotefuran, fipronil, imidacloprid, nitenpyram, thiacloprid, and thiamethoxam) and some metabolites. Overall, 99% of the surface water samples were positive to at least one of the targeted pesticides. The most recurrent compounds were glyphosate (detection frequency: 84%), ATZ (82%), thiamethoxam (59%), desethylatrazine (DEA: 47%), and clothianidin (46%). Glyphosate displayed variable levels (4-3,000 ng L-1), with higher concentrations in south tributaries (e.g., Nicolet and Yamaska). In positive samples, the sum of ATZ and DEA varied between 5 and 860 ng L-1, and the sum of 6 priority neonicotinoids between 1.5 and 115 ng L-1. From Repentigny to the Sorel Islands, the spatial distribution of pesticides within the St. Lawrence River was governed by the different upstream sources (i.e., Great Lakes vs. Ottawa River) due to the limited mixing of the different water masses. Cross-sectional patterns revealed higher concentrations of glyphosate and neonicotinoids in the north portions of transects, while the middle and south portions showed higher levels of atrazine. In Lake St. Pierre and further downstream, cross-sections revealed higher levels of the targeted pesticides near the southern portions of the SLR. This may be due to the higher contributions from south shore tributaries impacted by major agricultural areas, compared to north shore tributaries with forest land and less cropland use. Surface water samples were compliant with guidelines for the protection of aquatic life (chronic effects) for glyphosate and atrazine. However, 31% of the samples were found to surpass the guideline value of 8.3 ng L-1 for the sum of six priority neonicotinoids.",Anaerobic digestion to reduce biomass and remove arsenic from As-hyperaccumulator Pteris vittata.,https://www.ncbi.nlm.nih.gov/pubmed/30981932,"Environmental pollution (Barking, Essex : 1987)",2019 05 25,"The lack of efficient methods to treat As-rich biomass is a drawback for phytoremediation technology.

We assessed the associations between residential greenness and blood lipids and effect mediations by air pollution, physical activity, and adiposity in China. Our study included 15,477 adults from the population-based 33 Communities Chinese Health Study, conducted between April and December 2009, in Northeastern China. We measured total cholesterol (TC), triglycerides (TG), low-density lipoprotein cholesterol (LDL-C), and high-density lipoprotein cholesterol (HDL-C). Residential greenness was estimated using two satellite-derived vegetation indices - the Normalized Difference Vegetation Index (NDVI) and the Soil Adjusted Vegetation Index (SAVI). We used both nitrogen dioxide (NO2) and particles ≤2.5 μm in aerodynamic diameter (PM2.5) as proxies of outdoor air pollution. Associations were assessed using linear mixed effects regression models and logistic mixed effects regression models, and mediation analyses were also performed. Living in higher greenness areas was consistently associated with lower TC, TG, and LDL-C levels and higher HDL-C levels (e.g., change in TC, TG, LDL-C, and HDL-C per 0.1-unit increase in NDVI500-m was -1.52%, -3.05%, -1.91%, and 0.52%, respectively). Similar results were obtained for the corresponding dyslipidemias. These associations were generally stronger in women and older adults. While educational levels showed effect modifications, the effect pattern was inconsistent. Both outdoor air pollution and body mass index mediated 9.1-62.3% and 5.6-40.1% of the associations for greenness and blood lipids, respectively, however, physical activity did not. Our results suggest beneficial associations between residing in places with higher greenness and blood lipid levels, especially in women and the elder individuals.

Adulterants are pharmacologically active substances developed for medical purposes, however, there is little knowledge about their influence in the human body when there is concomitant use with cocaine. The objective of this work was to validate a method that allows the identification, confirmation and quantification of cocaine adulterants in blood samples collected in vivo or post-mortem. The studied substances were atropine, phenacetin, hydroxyzine, ketamine, lidocaine and tetramisole. A retrospective study of the prevalence of these substances, as well as their relative concentrations, was made analysing 97 real blood samples previously tested positive for cocaine and/or its metabolites. The analytes of interest were extracted, using a simple method based on protein precipitation with frozen acetonitrile and further analysis by GC/MS. The method was fully validated in accordance with parameters and criteria implemented in the lab and SWGTOX recommendations (mean recovery: 94-115%; CV: 6.2-13%; BIAS: 2.7-7.8%). 31 samples were positive for adulterants: phenacetin (19%), tetramisole (15%), lidocaine (8%) and hydroxyzine (1%). Concentrations were higher in post-mortem samples for all compounds analysed. Lidocaine was more prevalent in samples collected in vivo whereas tetramisole was present almost exclusively in post-mortem samples. Phenacetin was evenly distributed between post-mortem and in vivo samples. The validated method allows rapid, precise, accurate and economic analysis of selected compounds and requires smaller sample aliquots which can be important in post-mortem cases. The information collected can be important in future studies of correlation between the presence of adulterants and cocaine toxicity.",Electrochemical detection of DNA hybridization based on three-dimensional ZnO nanowires/graphite hybrid microfiber structure.,https://www.ncbi.nlm.nih.gov/pubmed/30981929,"Bioelectrochemistry (Amsterdam, Netherlands)",2019 05 24,"In the present work, zinc oxide (ZnO) nanowire (NWs)/graphite microfiber hybrid electrodes were used for the detection of DNA hybridization. ZnO NWs were in-situ synthesized onto graphite fibers using the hydrothermal technique, and the result was characterized by X-ray diffraction (XRD), scanning electron microscope (SEM) as well as transmission electron microscope (TEM). An electrochemical sensor for the analysis of DNA hybridization was developed based on immobilizing DNA probes onto the ZnO NWs/graphite microfiber electrodes surface via electrostatic interaction. Cyclic voltammetry (CV), electrochemical impedance spectroscopy (EIS) and X-ray photoelectron spectroscopy (XPS) were used to corroborate the fabrication of the sensor. Based on the results, ZnO NWs/graphite microfiber hybrid electrodes showed a great hybridization capacity for the determination of target DNA. A wide dynamic detection range from 1.0 × 10-14 M to 1.0 × 10-7 M with an ultralow detection limit of 3.3 × 10-15 M was achieved for detecting the target DNA.

There is little information regarding the genotypic-phenotypic association of anti-TB drugs, especially for second-line drugs. This study compared phenotypic drug susceptibility testing (DST) with predictions based on whole-genome sequencing (WGS) data for 266 Mycobacterium tuberculosis isolates. Phenotypic DST used the standard proportional method. Clinical isolates of M. tuberculosis collected in Thailand between 1998 and 2013 comprised 51 drug-sensitive strains, six mono-resistant strains, two multiple-resistant strains, 88 multi-drug-resistant strains, 95 pre-extensively drug-resistant strains and 24 extensively drug-resistant strains. WGS analysis was performed using the computer programs PhyResSE and TB-Profiler. TB-Profiler had higher average concordance with phenotypic DST than PhyResSE for both first-line (91.96% vs. 91.4%) and second-line (79.67% vs. 78.20%) anti-TB drugs. The average sensitivity for all anti-TB drugs was also higher (83.13% vs. 72.08%) with slightly lower specificity (83.50% vs. 86.68%). Regardless of the program used, isoniazid, rifampicin and amikacin had the highest concordance with phenotypic DST (96.2%, 93.5% and 95.6%, respectively). Ethambutol, ethionamide and fluoroquinolones had the lowest concordance (87.34%, 81.44% and 73.85%, respectively). Concordance rates of ofloxacin (a second-generation fluoroquinolone), levofloxacin, moxifloxacin and gatifloxacin (third- and fourth-generation fluoroquinolones) were 91.79%, 76.62%, 72.64% and 57.35%, respectively. Discordance between phenotypic and WGS-based DSTs may be due, in part, to the choice of critical concentration and variable reproducibility of the phenotypic tests. It may also be due to limitations of the mutation databases (especially for the second-line drugs) and the analysis program used. Mutations related to fluoroquinolone resistance, especially the later generations, need to be identified.","Identification and pathogenicity of an XDR Streptococcus suis isolate that harbours the phenicol-oxazolidinone resistance genes optrA and cfr, and the bacitracin resistance locus bcrABDR.",https://www.ncbi.nlm.nih.gov/pubmed/30981924,International journal of antimicrobial agents,2019 06 15,"One hundred and seven Streptococcus suis isolates were collected from healthy pigs or asymptomatic carriers in Jiangsu, China in 2016-2017.

Among them, one isolate, SFJ44, was resistant to all 20 of the antibiotics tested, except for ceftiofur, and thus exhibited an extensively-drug-resistant phenotype. This isolate carried the optrA gene and the bacitracin resistance locus bcrABDR on an antibiotic-resistance-associated genomic island (ARGI1), and harboured the resistance genes cfr, aadE, sat4, spw-like, aphA3, mef(A), msr(D), erm(A)-like, erm(B), tetAB(P)', tet(M) and catQ on ARGI2∼4. The IS1216E-bcrABDR-ISEnfa1 segment showed >99.9% sequence identity to corresponding sequences from other species. The cfr gene was located on ARGI4, and two IS6 family insertion sequences, IS1216E and ISTeha2, were found upstream and downstream of cfr-ΔISEnfa5, respectively. A circular intermediate of bcrABDR-ISEnfa1 was detected, suggesting the role of ISEnfa1 in dissemination of bcrABDR. Other antibiotic resistance genes might be acquired from different Gram-positive pathogens. Infection of zebrafish showed that SFJ44 exhibited a virulence level comparable to serotype 2 hypervirulent strain SC070731, highlighting the need for surveillance of the pathogenicity of multi-drug-resistant S. suis isolates. This is the first report of the co-existence of optrA and cfr, and of the bcrABDR locus in streptococci. As it has been suggested that S. suis may act as an antibiotic resistance reservoir contributing to the spread of resistance genes to major streptococcal pathogens, the potential dissemination of these resistance genes among Gram-positive bacteria is of concern and routine surveillance should be strengthened."

The aim of this study is the physicochemical and kinetic characterization of brain and muscle ChE from Danio rerio (Zebrafish). Optimal activity was found for brain ChE at alkaline pH 9.0 at 30 °C, and for muscle ChE at alkaline pH 8.5 at temperatures between 20 °C and 35 °C. The apparent kinetic constants, Kmapp and Vmaxapp, for brain ChE were determined as 0.191 ± 0.024 mM and 0.566 ± 0.028 U/mg protein, and for muscle ChE as 0.230 ± 0.030 mM and 0.677 ± 0.039 U/mg protein. Both brain and muscle ChE showed inhibition at high substrate concentrations. Brain and muscle ChE showed IC50 values for physostigmine of 0.61 μM and 0.37 μM, respectively. The ChE activity in brain was significantly inhibited by BW254c51 in all concentrations tested, but not by Iso-OMPA, while muscle ChE presented a moderate decrease (13 to 29%) in the activity values, indicating that BuChE is present.",The effects of Roundup® in embryo development and energy metabolism of the zebrafish (Danio rerio).,https://www.ncbi.nlm.nih.gov/pubmed/30981909,Comparative biochemistry and physiology. Toxicology & pharmacology : CBP,2019 06 05,"Roundup® is currently the most widely used and sold agricultural pesticide in the world. The objective of this work was to investigate the effects of Roundup® on energy metabolism during zebrafish (Danio rerio) embryogenesis. The embryo toxicity test was performed for 96 h post-fertilisation and the sublethal concentration of Roundup® was defined as 58.3 mg/L, which resulted in failure to inflate the swim bladder. Biochemical assays were performed with viable embryos following glyphosate exposure, and no significant effects on protein, glucose, glycogen, triglyceride levels or the enzymatic activities of alanine aminotransferase and aspartate aminotransferase were observed. However, the activity of hexokinase was significantly altered following exposure to 11.7 mg/L Roundup®. Through molecular docking we have shown for the first time that the interactions of glucokinase and hexokinases 1 and 2 with glyphosate showed significant interactions in the active sites, corroborating the biochemical results of hexokinase activity in zebrafish exposed to the chemical. From the results of molecular docking interactions carried out on the Zfishglucok, ZfishHK1 and ZfishHK2 models with the glyphosate linker, it can be concluded that there are significant interactions between glyphosate and active sites of glucokinase and hexokinase 1 and 2 proteins. The present work suggests that Roundup® can induce problems in fish embryogenesis relating to the incapacity of swim bladder to inflate. This represents the first study demonstrating the interaction of glyphosate with hexokinase and its isoforms.",Comparative transcriptome analysis reveals the different roles between hepatopancreas and intestine of Litopenaeus vannamei in immune response to aflatoxin B1 (AFB1) challenge.,https://www.ncbi.nlm.nih.gov/pubmed/30981908,Comparative biochemistry and physiology. Toxicology & pharmacology : CBP,2019 06 05,"Aflatoxin B1 (AFB1) is a mycotoxin mainly produced by Aspergillus flavus and Aspergillus parasiticus contaminating food, feed ingredients and products of animal origin. In mammals, this toxin causes widespread organ-specific damage; it is immunotoxicity and could promote hepatotoxicity, alter intestinal functions and so on. In this study, we conducted transcriptome and histomorphology analyses of hepatopancreas and intestinal in Litopenaeus vannamei (L. vannamei) challenged with AFB1. Totally 12,014 and 1387 differentially expression genes (DEGs) were identified in the hepatopancreas and intestine, respectively. In hepatopancreas, a total of 1995 DEGs were mainly annotated and grouped into 18 processes or pathways related to animal immune system. With respect to intestine, a total of 152 DEGs were mainly annotated to 7 processes or pathways related to animal immune system. Meanwhile, we determined the relative mRNA expression of several crucial representative immune genes including Toll, immune deficiency (IMD), prophenoloxidase (proPO), Rab and glutathione S-transferase (GST) in the hepatopancreas and intestines of shrimp at 3-, 6-, 12-, 18-, 24- and 30-d after challenged by AFB1. Exposure to AFB1 increased mortality, decrease weight gain rate, severely destroyed the histomorphology of hepatopancreas and intestine, and resulted in the damaged of immune system of shrimp. The present data reveals the different roles between hepatopancreas and intestine of L. vannamei in immune response to AFB1 challenge, and provides insight into the molecular basis of the relationship between hepatopancreas and intestinal immunity during either homeostasis or inflammation.",A puzzling pregnancy epulis with aggressive bone loss mimicking malignant neoplasm: A case report.,https://www.ncbi.nlm.nih.gov/pubmed/30981907,"Journal of stomatology, oral and maxillofacial surgery",2019 05 10,"Epulis is a benign tumor, rarely involves aggressive alveolar bone resorption. This study reported a rare case of rapid growth of pregnancy epulis with extensive alveolar bone destruction and the management of this case. A 24-year old pregnant woman at 35 weeks and 1 day of gestation presented a large asymptomatic nodular mass with severe teeth loosening at the anterior mandibular region for 4 weeks. Radiographic examination showed extensive alveolar bone resorption around the affected teeth to the apical area. After delivery, the patient received an extended resection under general anesthesia. The final histopathological analysis revealed the diagnosis of epulis. In conclusion, the rapid growth of epulis during pregnancy mimicking malignant neoplasm with aggressive alveolar bone destruction was rare and puzzling. In such cases, the histopathological and immunohistochemical examinations are the only effective method to reach the correct diagnosis and clinician should proceed with high precaution.","The Stensen's duct line: A landmark in parotid duct and gland injury and surgery.

Good evidence relates the PPN to control of reflex reactions, sleep-wake cycles, posture and gait. However, the precise role of the PPN in all these functions has been controversial and there still are uncertainties in the functional anatomy and physiology of the nucleus. It is difficult to grasp the extent of the influence of the PPN, not only because of its varied functions and projections, but also because of the controversies arising from them. One controversy is its relationship to the mesencephalic locomotor region (MLR). In this regard, the PPN has become a new target for deep brain stimulation (DBS) for the treatment of parkinsonian gait disorders, including freezing of gait.

To resemble a more adult-like phenotype on these heart-on-a-chip systems, the surrounding micro-environment of individual cardiomyocyte needs to be controlled. Herein, we investigated the impact of four microenvironmental cues: cell seeding density, types and percentages of non-myocyte populations, the types of hydrogels used for tissue inoculation and the electrical conditioning regimes on the structural and functional assembly of human pluripotent stem cell-derived cardiac tissues. Utilizing a novel, plastic and open-access heart-on-a-chip system that is capable of continuous non-invasive monitoring of tissue contractions, we were able to study how different micro-environmental cues affect the assembly of the cardiomyocytes into a functional cardiac tissue.

In this study, caspase-8-like (named as Cicaspase-8-like), a homologue of caspase-8, was identified in grass carp (Ctenopharygodon idella). The full-length cDNA sequence of CiCaspase-8-like was 1409 bp and contained a 162 bp 5'-UTR, a 239 bp 3'-UTR and a 1008 bp coding sequence. The putative amino acids sequence was 335 residues long, including a large subunit (P20) and a small subunit (P10), but lacking conserved death effector domains. A histidine active site DHSQMDAFVCCVLSHG and a cysteine active-site motif KPKLFFIQACQG were found in P20. Phylogenetic analysis showed that Cicaspase-8-like clustered with the caspase-8 and caspase-8-like of other fish and grouped closely with Carassius auratus caspase-8-like. Quantitative real-time PCR revealed that the Cicaspase-8-like mRNA were expressed constitutively in all tested tissues from healthy grass carp, with high expression level in the blood, spleen, liver and gill, indicating its role in immune reaction. The expression of Cicaspase-8-like mRNA was decreased significantly in the liver because of the stress caused by microcystin-LR (MC-LR) (75 and 100 μg MC-LR/kg BW) at 24 h and 96 h post injection (P < 0.05), but it was increased significantly in grass carp treated with 25 μg MC-LR/kg BW at 24 h (P < 0.05) post injection. Cleaved fragments of Cicaspase-8-like were observed using western blot analysis, and the expression of Cicaspase-8-like protein was increased after MC-LR treatments. Moreover, the expression of both caspase-9 and caspase-3 mRNA increased significantly after treatment with the three doses of MC-LR. TUNEL assay results showed remarkable changes in apoptosis after the MC-LR treatment. These results suggest that Cicaspase-8-like is an important caspase and plays an essential role in MC-LR-induced apoptosis.",Autophagy as a molecular target for cancer treatment.,https://www.ncbi.nlm.nih.gov/pubmed/30981885,European journal of pharmaceutical sciences : official journal of the European Federation for Pharmaceutical Sciences,2019 05 20,"Autophagy is an evolutionarily conserved catabolic mechanism, by which eukaryotic cells recycle or degrades internal constituents through membrane-trafficking pathway. Thus, autophagy provides the cells with a sustainable source of biomolecules and energy for the maintenance of homeostasis under stressful conditions such as tumor microenvironment. Recent findings revealed a close relationship between autophagy and malignant transformation. However, due to the complex dual role of autophagy in tumor survival or cell death, efforts to develop efficient treatment strategies targeting the autophagy/cancer relation have largely been unsuccessful. Here we review the two-faced role of autophagy in cancer as a tumor suppressor or as a pro-oncogenic mechanism. In this sense, we also review the shared regulatory pathways that play a role in autophagy and malignant transformation.

They are synthesized through two consecutive reactions catalyzed by class II and I diterpene synthases (DTSs). The structural complexity of LRDs mainly depends on the catalytic activity of class I DTSs, which catalyze the formation of bicyclic to pentacyclic LRDs, using as a substrate the catalytic product of class II DTSs. To date, the structural and mechanistic details for the biosynthesis of bicyclic LRDs skeletons catalyzed by class I DTSs remain unclear. This work presents the first X-ray crystal structure of an (E)-biformene synthase, LrdC, from the soil bacterium Streptomyces sp. strain K155. LrdC was identified as a part of an LRD cluster of five genes and was found to be a class I DTS that catalyzes the Mg2+-dependent synthesis of bicyclic LRD (E)-biformene by the dephosphorylation and rearrangement of normal copalyl pyrophosphate (CPP). Structural analysis of LrdC coupled with docking studies suggests that Phe189 prevents cyclization beyond the bicyclic LRD product through a strong stabilization of the allylic carbocation intermediate, while Tyr317 functions as a general base catalyst to deprotonate the CPP substrate. Structural comparisons of LrdC with homology models of bacterial bicyclic LRD-forming enzymes (CldD, RmnD and SclSS), as well as with the crystallographic structure of bacterial tetracyclic LRD ent-kaurene synthase (BjKS), provide further structural insights into the biosynthesis of bacterial LRD natural products.","Exercise-related out-of-hospital cardiac arrest in Victoria, Australia.",https://www.ncbi.nlm.nih.gov/pubmed/30981883,Resuscitation,2019 06 07,Characteristics and outcomes of exercise-related out-of-hospital cardiac arrests (OHCA) are not well described in Australia.,Advanced airway management during adult cardiac arrest: A systematic review.,https://www.ncbi.nlm.nih.gov/pubmed/30981882,Resuscitation,2019 06 07,To systematically review the literature on advanced airway management during adult cardiac arrest in order to inform the International Liaison Committee of Resuscitation (ILCOR) consensus on science and treatment recommendations.,Carrying a 112 bp-segment in Helicobacter pylori dupA may associate with increased risk of duodenal ulcer.,https://www.ncbi.nlm.nih.gov/pubmed/30981881,"Infection, genetics and evolution : journal of molecular epidemiology and evolutionary genetics in infectious diseases",2019 06 16,"The discovery of Helicobacter pylori in 1983 challenged researchers around the world to identify this pathogen's major virulence factors. The main rationale for this kind of research was to identify a biomarker associated with specific diseases following H. pylori colonization. Among different investigated virulence factors, duodenal ulcer promoting gene A (dupA) has been found to be associated with duodenal ulcer (DU), but its effect was different in various geographical regions. To determine the prevalence of dupA, we applied both classic primer pairs and our newly developed primers producing a highly conserved segment in PCR method. In our survey, 143 (47%) H. pylori isolates were obtained from 304H. pylori-colonized individuals [age range of 19-92; 113 (37%) males with the mean age of 50 and 191 (63%) females with the mean age of 49]. The presence of the dupA gene was investigated by using the different specific primers. The prevalence of the 112 bp segment isolated from H. pylori strains recovered from DU, GU and atrophy groups were significantly higher (81%, p value = .002, 64%, p = .065, 68% and p = .047 38%, respectively) than our control group, where the prevalence of the 112 bp segment was only 38%.

Previously, we reported the anti-inflammatory and antitumorigenic effects of 17β-estradiol (E2) in azoxymethane (AOM)/dextran sulfate sodium (DSS)-treated male mice. The aim of this study was to investigate whether ovariectomy in a female AOM/DSS mouse model increases colorectal tumorigenesis and whether tumorigenesis is reduced by estrogen supplementation after ovariectomy. Clinical symptoms and histological severity of colitis and the levels of inflammatory mediators were evaluated in the colon of AOM/DSS-treated ovariectomized (OVX) mice. The levels of E2, myeloperoxidase (MPO), and NF-κB-dependent cytokines (interleukin (IL)-1β and IL-6) were measured by ELISA. Furthermore, quantitative real-time (qRT) PCR and Western blot analysis were performed. Ovariectomy did not aggravate AOM/DSS-induced colitis at 2 weeks. At weeks 10 and 16, ovariectomy significantly increased tumor number and incidence rate in only the proximal colon after AOM/DSS treatment (F_AOM/DSS vs OVX_AOM/DSS), and these increases were significantly reduced by E2 supplementation (OVX_AOM/DSS vs OVX_AOM/DSS/E2). However, ovariectomy did not affect CRC development in the distal colon (F_AOM/DSS vs OVX_AOM/DSS). At week 2, E2 administration to AOM/DSS-treated OVX mice attenuated the histological severity of colitis by decreasing the protein and/or mRNA levels of estrogen receptor alpha (ERα) and NF-κB-related mediators (i.e., COX-2, TNF-α, and IL-6) and by enhancing estrogen receptor beta (ERβ) and nuclear Nrf2 protein expression and the mRNA expression of related antioxidant enzyme genes (i.e., HO-1, GCLC, GCLM, and NQO1). Endogenous estrogen in females protects against the development of proximal colon cancer, and exogenous E2 replacement in OVX female mice showed protective effects against AOM/DSS-induced colitis and carcinogenesis.

However, a supplementary step is required to obtain functional proteins: the folding of the newly translated polypeptides into well-defined, three-dimensional conformations. Proteins chaperones are crucial for this final step in the readout of genetic information, which results in the formation of functional proteins. In this review, a special attention will be given to the strategies targeting hsp90 family members in order to increase cancer cell death. We argue that disruption of hsp90 machinery and the further client protein degradation is the main consequence of hsp90 oxidative cleavage taking place at the N-terminal nucleotide-binding site. Moreover, modulation of Grp94 expression will be discussed as a potential therapeutic goal looking for a decrease in cancer relapses.",Lactate-stimulated ethanol oxidation: Revisiting an old hypothesis.,https://www.ncbi.nlm.nih.gov/pubmed/30981876,Biochemical pharmacology,2019 05 17,"Liver slices from starved rats and incubated without other substrates oxidized ethanol at a rate of 4.1 µmols • h-1 • g-1. Addition of 10 mmols • L-1 lactate increased this rate 2-fold. 4-methylpyrazole (4-MP), an alcohol dehydrogenase (ADH) inhibitor, drastically decreased the rate of ethanol oxidation, but did not inhibit the stimulation due to lactate. In the same context, liver acetaldehyde production, as the main by-product of ethanol oxidation, appeared to be much less inhibited by 4-MP in the presence of lactate. Aminotriazole (a catalase inhibitor), however, completely inhibited the stimulation. Furthermore, 2-hydroxybut-3-ynoate, an alpha-hydroxy acid oxidase inhibitor, completely abolished the stimulated ethanol oxidation promoted by lactate. Moreover, to determine the origin of the H2O2 produced, we did liver subcellular fractionation and then analyzed their content in peroxisomes, mitochondria and catalase. We observed that cytoplasm and peroxisomes appears to be the main producers of H2O2, and that the acceleration of ethanol oxidation by lactate is completely dependent on catalase. In conclusion, the H2O2 necessary to boost the catalase-dependent oxidation of ethanol appears to come from cytoplasm and peroxisomes, and is produced by the enzyme lactate oxidase."

In addition to functioning as photoreceptors, ipRGCs are post-synaptic neurons in the inner retina, and there is increasing evidence that their output can be influenced by retinal neuromodulators. Here we show that opioids can modulate light-evoked ipRGC signaling, and we demonstrate that the M1, M2 and M3 types of ipRGCs are immunoreactive for μ-opioid receptors (MORs) in both mouse and rat. In the rat retina, application of the MOR-selective agonist DAMGO attenuated light-evoked firing ipRGCs in a dose-dependent manner (IC50 < 40 nM), and this effect was reversed or prevented by co-application of the MOR-selective antagonists CTOP or CTAP. Recordings from solitary ipRGCs, enzymatically dissociated from retinas obtained from melanopsin-driven fluorescent reporter mice, confirmed that DAMGO exerts its effect directly through MORs expressed by ipRGCs. Reduced ipRGC excitability occurred via modulation of voltage-gated potassium and calcium currents. These findings suggest a potential new role for endogenous opioids in the mammalian retina and identify a novel site of action-MORs on ipRGCs-through which opioids might exert effects on reflexive responses to environmental light.",Systemic oxytocin administration alters mesolimbic dopamine release in mice.,https://www.ncbi.nlm.nih.gov/pubmed/30981861,Neuroscience,2019 06 16,"Growing research indicates oxytocin may be involved in relieving anxiety and attenuating the rewarding effects of psychostimulants. This study investigated the effects of subchronic oxytocin treatments on mesolimbic dopamine transmission in areas associated with anxiety and addiction, the amygdala and the nucleus accumbens (NAc), respectively. Using in vivo fixed potential amperometry, stimulation-evoked dopamine release was recorded in anesthetized mice pretreated with subchronic oxytocin (four i.p. injections of 1 mg/kg oxytocin or saline with 48 h between injections). During dopamine recordings, mice received an i.p. drug challenge of either oxytocin (1 mg/kg), the dopamine reuptake blocker nomifensine (10 mg/kg), or saline. Overall, subchronic oxytocin pretreatment did alter properties of dopamine release in these limbic structures. In the amygdala, dopamine release was decreased following the oxytocin challenge but only in oxytocin pretreated mice. In the NAc, baseline dopamine release was attenuated in oxytocin pretreated mice relative to saline pretreated mice. Furthermore, oxytocin pretreated mice displayed a reduced dopaminergic response to the drug challenge of nomifensine relative to control mice. Together these results suggest that oxytocin may be useful at treating aspects of anxiety and drug abuse. Elucidating the neural effects of oxytocin is critical given the multitude of potential therapeutic uses for this drug.",M1 Muscarinic Receptor Activation Rescues β-Amyloid-Induced Cognitive Impairment through AMPA Receptor GluA1 Subunit.,https://www.ncbi.nlm.nih.gov/pubmed/30981860,Neuroscience,2019 06 15,"M1 muscarinic receptors have long been identified as a potential therapeutic target for the treatment of cognitive impairment in Alzheimer's disease (AD). Our previous study has shown that M1 receptors promote membrane insertion and synaptic delivery of AMPA receptor GluA1 subunit. In this study, we sought to determine whether activation of M1 receptor would rescue the cognitive impairment in AD model mice through modulation of GluA1 subunit. For the mice injected with aggregated β-amyloid (Aβ) fragments to impair learning and memory, activation of M1 receptors could rescue it by reducing the latency to find the platform and spending more time in the target quadrant in the probe test in the Morris water maze. However, such an effect was ablated in mice with Ser845 residue of GluA1 mutated to alanine. Furthermore, the activation of M1 receptors enhanced the expression of GluA1 and its phosphorylation at Ser845 and drove GluA1 to incorporate with PSD95, a postsynaptic marker, in the hippocampi from Aβ-injected wild type mice but not from the mutant mice. Moreover, for 9-month-old APP/PS1 transgenic AD model mice, which may resemble the late AD, M1 receptor activation could not improve the cognitive impairment significantly. In addition, the enhancement of GluA1 expression and its phosphorylation at Ser845 were not observed in their hippocampi. Taken together, the study indicated that M1 receptor activation rescued the cognitive deficit through modulating the trafficking of GluA1-containing AMPA receptors and the therapeutics targeting M1 receptors should aim at mild AD or even pre-AD.",Structural mapping with fiber tractography of the human cuneate fasciculus at microscopic resolution in cervical region.,https://www.ncbi.nlm.nih.gov/pubmed/30981859,NeuroImage,2019 06 15,"Human spinal white matter tract anatomy has been mapped using post mortem histological information with the help of molecular tracing studies in animal models. This study used 7 Tesla diffusion MR tractography on a human cadaver that was harvested 24 hours post mortem to evaluate cuneate fasciculus anatomy in cervical spinal cord. Based on this method, for the first time much more nuanced tractographic anatomy was used to investigate possible new routes for cuneate fasciculus in the posterior and lateral funiculus. Additionally, current molecular tracing studies were reviewed, and confirmatory data was presented along with our radiological results. Both studies confirm that upon entry to the spinal cord, upper cervical level tracts (C1-2-3) travel inside lateral funiculus and lower level tracts travel medially inside the posterior funiculus after entry at posterolateral sulcus which is different than traditional knowledge of having cuneate fasciculus tracts concentrated in the lateral part of posterior funiculus.",Functional resting-state brain connectivity is accompanied by dynamic correlations of application-dependent [18F]FDG PET-tracer fluctuations.,https://www.ncbi.nlm.nih.gov/pubmed/30981858,NeuroImage,2019 06 15,"Brain function is characterized by a convolution of various biochemical and physiological processes, raising the interest whether resting-state functional connectivity derived from hemodynamic scales shows underlying metabolic synchronies. Increasing evidence suggests that metabolic connectivity based on glucose consumption associated PET recordings may serve as a marker of cognitive functions and neuropathologies. However, to what extent fMRI-derived resting-state brain connectivity can also be characterized based on dynamic fluctuations of glucose metabolism and how metabolic connectivity is influenced by [18F]FDG pharmacokinetics remains unsolved. Simultaneous PET/MRI measurements were performed in a total of 26 healthy male Lewis rats. Simultaneously to resting-state fMRI scans, one cohort (n = 15) received classical bolus [18F]FDG injections and dynamic PET images were recorded. In a second cohort (n = 11) [18F]FDG was constantly infused over the entire functional PET/MRI scans. Resting-state fMRI and [18F]FDG-PET connectivity was evaluated using a graph-theory based correlation approach and compared on whole-brain level and for a default-mode network-like structure. Further, pharmacokinetic and tracer uptake influences on [18F]FDG-PET connectivity results were investigated based on the different PET protocols. By integrating simultaneous resting-state fMRI and dynamic [18F]FDG-PET measurements in the rat brain, we identified homotopic correlations between both modalities, suggesting an underlying synchrony between hemodynamic processes and glucose consumption. Furthermore, the presence of the prominent resting-state default-mode network-like structure was not only depicted on a functional scale but also from dynamic fluctuations of [18F]FDG. In addition, the present findings demonstrated strong pharmacokinetic and tracer uptake dependencies of [18F]FDG-PET connectivity outcomes. This study highlights the application of dynamic [18F]FDG-PET to study cognitive brain functions and to decode underlying brain networks in the resting-state. Thereby, PET-derived connectivity outcomes indicated strong dependencies on tracer application regimens and subsequent time-varying tracer pharmacokinetics.",Normative event-related potentials from sensory and cognitive tasks reveal occipital and frontal activities prior and following visual events.,https://www.ncbi.nlm.nih.gov/pubmed/30981857,NeuroImage,2019 06 15,"In the present study, we report the results from a large sample of participants (N = 136), selected based on their EEG quality, to obtain event-related potential (ERP) normative data. All participants were tested in Simple Response Task (SRT) and Discriminative Response Task (DRT). A subset of 36 participants was tested also in Passive Vision task. Both pre- and post-stimulus ERPs were analyzed and compared among different tasks. Spatiotemporal patterns of all the observed components were analyzed using source analysis. Beside the well-known ERP components, we also described recently identified prefrontal components: the pre-stimulus prefrontal negativity (pN) associated to proactive cognitive (mainly inhibitory) control within the inferior frontal gyrus (iFg); the post-stimulus prefrontal N1, P1 and P2 (pN1, pP1 and pP2) involved in perceptual and visual-motor awareness (pN1 and pP1), and in stimulus-response mapping and decision-making (pP2) localized within the insular cortex. The large sample of high-quality EEG datasets allowed to identify four additional components: the pre-stimulus visual negativity (vN) originating in extrastriate visual areas and interpreted as a visual readiness activity; the post-stimulus prefrontal N2 and N3 (pN2 and pN3) components interpreted as feedback reactivation of the anterior insular cortex; and the post-stimulus prefrontal P3 (pP3), interpreted as persisting inhibitory activity of the iFg for inhibited trials.",The relationship between heart rate and functional connectivity of brain regions involved in autonomic control.,https://www.ncbi.nlm.nih.gov/pubmed/30981856,NeuroImage,2019 06 15,"The peripheral autonomic nervous system (ANS) adjusts the heart rate (HR) to intrinsic and extrinsic demands. It is controlled by a group of functionally connected brain regions assembling the so-called central autonomic network (CAN). More specifically, forebrain cortical regions, limbic and brainstem structures within the CAN have been identified as important components of circuits involved in HR regulation. The present study aimed to investigate whether functional connectivity (FC) between these regions varies in subjects with different heart rates. Thus, 84 healthy subjects were separated according to their HR in slow, medium and fast. We observed a direct association between HR and FC in CAN regions, where stronger FC was related to slower HR. This relationship, however, is non-linear, follows an exponential course and is not restricted to CAN areas only. The network-based analysis (NBS) using time series from 262 independent anatomical ROIs revealed significantly increased functional connectivity in subjects with slow HR compared to subjects with fast HR mainly in regions being part of the salience network, but also of the default-mode network. We additionally simulated the effect of aliasing on the functional connectivity using several TRs and heart rates to exclude the possibility that FC differences might be due to different aliasing effects in the data. The result of the simulation indicated that aliasing cannot explain our findings. Thus, present results imply a functionally meaningful coupling between FC and HR that need to be accounted for in future studies. Moreover, given the established link between HR and emotional, cognitive and social processes, present findings may also be considered to explain individual differences in brain activation or connectivity when using corresponding paradigms in the MR scanner to investigate such processes.",Causal evidence of right temporal parietal junction involvement in implicit Theory of Mind processing.,https://www.ncbi.nlm.nih.gov/pubmed/30981855,NeuroImage,2019 06 15,"The ability to represent the internal thoughts, beliefs and desires of others, and recognise that these might be distinct from one's own, is crucial for adaptive social interaction. Such operations are thought to tap Theory of Mind (ToM), with its importance underscored by the link between ToM impairment and a range of neurodevelopmental disorders (e.g., Autism and Schizophrenia). Extensive investigations into the neural substrates of ToM, when individuals have to make overt/explicit judgments concerning others, have highlighted a link with a network of regions including the temporal parietal junction (TPJ), particularly in the right hemisphere. Recently, evidence has emerged that ToM can also operate implicitly and that this may be particularly impaired in Autism. However, very few studies have examined the neural basis of implicit ToM and none have employed methods allowing casual inferences to be made. Here, using brain stimulation, a Sally-Anne false-belief task, and eye-tracking we show that right TPJ is causally involved in ToM judgments that are made implicitly. These findings have implications for characterising the neural substrates of a key executive function, determining the extent to which implicit and explicit ToM draw on overlapping neural architecture and, potentially, better understanding of disorders tied to ToM impairment.",Time matters: Feature-specific prioritization follows feature integration in visual object processing.,https://www.ncbi.nlm.nih.gov/pubmed/30981854,NeuroImage,2019 06 15,"Objects represent a fundamental selection unit of visual attention. However, at odds with the integrated competition account, our recent study demonstrated that attentional facilitation of constituent features does not spread automatically within an object, but instead depends on the specific task relevance of each feature. Here, we employed a novel experimental design, allowing simultaneous electrophysiological measurements of the allocation of attention to two distinct features (rotation and color) within one object (a square) during both trial-wise and block-wise cued shifts of attention. This was possible through the presentation of a square that evokes two distinct steady-state visual evoked potentials (SSVEPs) for its rotation and its color changes, respectively. Given the continuous oscillatory nature of SSVEPs, we were able to investigate the time course of neural activity in the early visual cortex of the human brain when subjects attended to one of the two features, compared to when the whole object was attended. This approach enabled us to uncover feature-based mechanisms of attention within one object, as well as their interaction with object-based mechanisms. Both behavioral and electrophysiological results indicate a biphasic process composed of an early transient integration of the constituent object features, followed by sustained mechanisms of feature selection with amplification of the to-be-attended feature, followed temporally by suppression of the to-be-ignored feature.",Clinical presentation and prognosis of immunoglobulin light-chain amyloidosis with high percentage of bone marrow plasma cells.,https://www.ncbi.nlm.nih.gov/pubmed/30981853,Leukemia research,2019 05 21,To summarize the clinical features and outcomes in Chinese patients with immunoglobulin light-chain (AL) amyloidosis with ≥10% bone marrow plasma cells (BMPCs).

The most prevalent mutation in Bulgaria is p.Glu89Gln. Markedly different age at onset and disease penetrance is noticed in Bulgarian p.Glu89Gln cases even in a single family or between genetically identical twins. The present study aimed to evaluate the transcription profile of the TTR gene in order to better understand the difference in disease onset and penetrance. Six p.Glu89Gln positive families were selected from our registry, based on intrafamilial differences in disease onset and penetrance. Plasma and urine specimens were collected from 13 patients and subjected to transcription analysis. Both mutant and wild type transcripts were visualized in a mixed transcription profile, which is the traditional model of autosomal gene expression. The results from a relative quantification of the mutant versus wild type transcript showed presence of the mutant transcript between 0.14 and 1.14 times against the wild type. In addition, monoallelic expression signature was also detected. Based on our results we propose a model of natural selection, which includes age-related allele exclusion or suppression: predominant expression of a wild type (at an early age) and mutant (at the process of ageing) alleles. The intrafamilial differences in disease onset and penetrance need to be considered in genetic counselling and in follow-up of mutation carriers.",Expression of type II collagen and aggrecan genes is regulated through distinct epigenetic modifications of their multiple enhancer elements.,https://www.ncbi.nlm.nih.gov/pubmed/30981839,Gene,2019 05 25,"To maintain normal function of cartilage tissue normally, the presence of a sufficient amount of type II collagen and aggrecan is essential, and their synthesis is tightly regulated. Therefore, understanding the mechanisms that control the expression of type II collagen and aggrecan would be useful for understanding gene expression changes in diseases such as osteoarthritis. Recently, we have identified two pairs of enhancer elements, termed E1 and E2 in the type II collagen gene and Ea and Eb in the aggrecan gene. However, their different mechanisms of action remained unclear. Thus, the central aim of this study was to clarify the different transcriptional regulation mediated through each enhancer element. To this end, we established different stable reporter cell lines that express a reporter gene under the control of different enhancer elements using a silent reporter system we previously constructed. Using these cell lines, we found that dexamethasone, forskolin, and trichostatin A affect the gene expression of type II collagen and aggrecan via different enhancer elements. Moreover, we clarified that E1 and E2 enhancer activities are regulated through distinct epigenetic modifications by histone deacetylase 10 and sirtuin 6.",Genetic screening for MC4R gene identifies three novel mutations associated with severe familiar obesity in a cohort of Spanish individuals.,https://www.ncbi.nlm.nih.gov/pubmed/30981838,Gene,2019 05 25,"MC4R gene is a hypothalamic satiety control mediator in which mutations cause a monogenic form of obesity. The aim of this study was to perform a genetic screening to identify variations in the entire region of MC4R gene. A total of 236 unrelated and severely obese patients (BMI ≥ 40 kg/m2) with Spanish ancestry and severe overweight familiar history have been enrolled into the study. Seven MC4R gene variants were identified in the heterozygous state in 21 patients. Coding variants p.Thr101Ile and p.Ala259Asp are new and variants p.Ser30Phe, p.Val103Ile and p.Ile251Leu were previously described. Two variants have been also observed in the promoter region of the MC4R gene; the c.-24G>A mutation, described for the first time, and the known c.-178A>C variant. Both in silico and family segregation analysis confirm the correlation between novel identified mutations in MC4R gene and obesity development. The correlation between the four variants (c.-24G>A, p.Thr101Ile, p.Ala259Asp and p.Ser30Phe) and the obesity phenotype, therefore, allows the conclusion that all of the four mutations cause a monogenic form of obesity.",Function of heat shock protein 70 in the thermal stress response of Dermatophagoides farinae and establishment of an RNA interference method.,https://www.ncbi.nlm.nih.gov/pubmed/30981836,Gene,2019 06 13,"Dermatophagoides farinae are an important mite species that cause stored product deterioration and allergic diseases. They widely breed in human habitats because of their strong tolerance to extreme external temperatures. However, mechanisms underlying the stress response and tolerance of D. farinae are unclear. We hypothesized that heat shock protein 70 plays an important role in the heat stress response of D. farinae. In this study, we determined the survival rates of D. farinae at high temperatures (37 °C-45 °C) by performing temperature-gradient experiments in vitro and assessed the expression level of HSP70 by performing RT-qPCR. First, we confirmed that HSP70 regulated the heat stress response of D. farinae, with maximum heat stress regulation observed at 41 °C. Next, we confirmed the presence of a Dicer enzyme-mediated RNA interference (RNAi) pathway in D. farinae by searching the NCBI database and a Dicer site prediction website. Finally, we performed RNAi in D. farinae by using an immersion method with screened dsHSP70 fragments. Moreover, we performed concentration-gradient experiments to determine that 600 ng/μl was the minimal effective concentration of dsHSP70 for silencing HSP70. These results confirm that HSP70 regulates the heat stress response of D. farinae. The present study is the first to report the use of the non-invasive and highly sensitive immersion method for performing RNAi in D. farinae. The results of the present study provide a technical foundation for performing functional gene research and for developing molecular prevention and control strategies against medically important mites.",Synthetic T cell receptor-based lymphocytes for cancer therapy.,https://www.ncbi.nlm.nih.gov/pubmed/30981835,Advanced drug delivery reviews,2019 04 21,"Chimeric antigen receptor (CAR) T cells have been remarkably successful in patients with hematological malignancies expressing the CD19 surface antigen, but such level of success is far from being replicated in solid tumors. Engineered T cell receptor (TCR) T cells targeting cancer antigens were first developed over two decades ago and represent an alternative adoptive T cell approach that has produced provocative clinical data in solid cancers. However, several factors may hinder this technology from realizing its full potential, including the need for HLA matching, HLA downregulation by cancer cells, the suppressive tumor microenvironment, and tissue liabilities resulting from targeting antigens shared with normal tissues. Efforts therefore continue to engineer enhanced versions of CAR T and TCR T therapies that can overcome current barriers. Furthermore, emergent novel TCR-based, HLA-unrestricted platforms may also provide unique tools that integrate the complexity of the TCR signaling cascade that can be applied to treat solid tumors.

However, the association between parental threatening behaviors and depressive symptoms among trauma-exposed inpatient youth, and potential factors that exacerbate the harmful effects of such parenting, have remained unexplored. One factor that may contribute to depression is low emotional clarity, which is characterized by difficulties recognizing and understanding one's emotions. The current investigation examined the interactive effects of childhood exposure to maternal threatening behaviors and emotional clarity deficits in relation to depressive symptoms among inpatient psychiatric youth who had been exposed to a potentially traumatic event (i.e., exposure to actual or threatened death, serious injury, or sexual violence). Participants (N = 50, Mage = 15.1 years, SD = 0.51, range 12-17) completed measures of emotion dysregulation, childhood exposure to maternal threatening behavior, and depressive symptoms. A significant interaction was found between exposure to maternal threatening behaviors and deficits in emotional clarity in relation to depressive symptom severity. Greater exposure to maternal threatening behaviors was related to more severe depressive symptoms, yet only among children with greater deficits in emotional clarity. Findings underscore the need for interventions that target emotional clarity among trauma-exposed youth who have experienced parental threats."

Preventively or curatively administered pathogen-specific therapeutic antibodies (Abs) have several advantages, including a low level of toxicity and a unique pharmacological profile. At present, most Abs against respiratory infections are administered parenterally; this may not be optimal for therapeutics that have to reach the lungs to be effective. Although the airways constitute a logical delivery route for biologics designed to treat respiratory diseases, there are few scientific data on the advantages or disadvantages of this route in the context of pneumonia treatment. The objective of the present study was to evaluate the efficacy and fate of an anti-P. aeruginosa Ab targeting pcrV (mAb166) as a function of the administration route during pneumonia. The airway-administered mAb166 displayed a favorable pharmacokinetic profile during the acute phase of the infection, and was associated with greater protection (relative to other delivery routes) of infected animals. Airway administration was associated with lower levels of lung inflammation, greater bacterial clearance, and recruitment of neutrophils in the airways. In conclusion, the present study is the first to have compared the pharmacokinetics and efficacy of an anti-infectious Ab administered by different routes in an animal model of pneumonia. Our findings suggest that local delivery to the airways is associated with a more potent anti-bacterial response (relative to parenteral administration), and thus open up new perspectives for the prevention and treatment of pneumonia with Abs.",Drug induced micellization into ultra-high capacity and stable curcumin nanoformulations: Physico-chemical characterization and evaluation in 2D and 3D in vitro models.,https://www.ncbi.nlm.nih.gov/pubmed/30981815,Journal of controlled release : official journal of the Controlled Release Society,2019 06 06,"Curcumin (CUR) is a natural extract from the plant Curcuma longa and part of turmeric, a spice and herbal remedy in traditional medicine. Thousands of papers claim a plethora of health benefits by CUR, but a growing number of reports and contributions caution that many experimental data may be artifacts or outright deny any suitability of CUR due to its problematic physicochemical properties. Two major issues often encountered with CUR are its extraordinarily low solubility in water and its limited chemical stability. Here, we report on a novel nanoformulation of CUR that enables CUR concentrations in water of at least 50 g/L with relative drug loadings of >50 wt% and high dose efficacy testing in 3D tumor models. Despite this high loading and concentration, the CUR nanoformulation comprises polymer-drug aggregates with a size <50 nm. Most interestingly, this is achieved using an amphiphilic block copolymer, that by itself does not form micelles due to its limited hydrophilic/lipophilic contrast. The ultra-high loaded nanoformulations exhibit a very good stability, reproducibility and redispersibility. In order to test effects of CUR in conditions closer to an in vivo situation, we utilized a 3D tumor test system based on a biological decellularized tissue matrix that better correlates to clinical results concerning drug testing. We found that in comparison to 2D culture, the invasively growing breast cancer cell line MDA-MB-231 requires high concentrations of CUR for tumor cell eradication in 3D. In addition, we supplemented a 3D colorectal cancer model of the malignant cell line SW480 with fibroblasts and observed also in this invasive tumor model with stroma components a decreased tumor cell growth after CUR application accompanied by a loss of cell-cell contacts within tumor cell clusters. In a flow bioreactor simulating cancer cell dissemination, nanoformulated CUR prevented SW480 cells from adhering to a collagen scaffold, suggesting an anti-metastatic potential of CUR. This offers a rationale that the presented ultra-high CUR-loaded nanoformulation may be considered a tool to harness the full therapeutic potential of CUR.","The metastasis suppressor, NDRG1, differentially modulates the endoplasmic reticulum stress response.",https://www.ncbi.nlm.nih.gov/pubmed/30981813,Biochimica et biophysica acta. Molecular basis of disease,2019 05 25,"The metastasis suppressor, N-myc downstream regulated gene-1 (NDRG1), is a stress response protein that is involved in the inhibition of multiple oncogenic signaling pathways. Initial studies have linked NDRG1 and the endoplasmic reticulum (ER) stress response. Considering this, we extensively examined the mechanism by which NDRG1 regulates the ER stress response in pancreatic and colon cancer cells. We also examined the anti-cancer agent, di-2-pyridylketone 4,4-dimethyl-3-thiosemicarbazone (Dp44mT), which induces NDRG1 expression and causes ER stress. The expression of NDRG1 was demonstrated to regulate the three main arms of the ER stress response by: (1) increasing the expression of three major ER chaperones, binding immunoglobulin protein (BiP), calreticulin, and calnexin; (2) suppressing the protein kinase, RNA-activated (PKR)-like ER kinase (PERK); (3) inhibiting the inositol-requiring kinase 1α (IRE1α) arm; and (4) increasing the cleavage of activating transcription factor 6 (ATF6). An important finding was that NDRG1 enhances the anti-proliferative and anti-migratory activity of Dp44mT. This increased efficacy could be related to the following effects in the presence of Dp44mT and NDRG1, namely: markedly increased activation of the PERK target, eukaryotic translation initiation factor 2α (eIF2α); the maintenance of activating transcription factor 4 (ATF4) expression; high cytosolic Ca+2 that increases the sensitivity of cells to apoptosis via activation of the calmodulin-dependent kinase II (CaMKII) signaling cascade; and increased pro-apoptotic C/EBP-homologous protein (CHOP) expression. Collectively, this investigation dissects the molecular mechanisms through which NDRG1 manipulates the ER stress response and its ability to potentiate the activity of the potent anti-cancer agent, Dp44mT.",Dark offshoot: Phylogenomic data sheds light on the evolutionary history of a new species of cave brittle star.,https://www.ncbi.nlm.nih.gov/pubmed/30981811,Molecular phylogenetics and evolution,2019 05 27,"Caves are a useful system for testing evolutionary and biogeographic hypotheses, as they are isolated, and their environmental conditions have resulted in adaptive selection across different taxa. Although in recent years many more cave species have been discovered, cave-dwelling members of the class Ophiuroidea (brittle stars) remain scarce. Out of the more than two thousand species of brittle stars described to date, only three are regarded as true cave-dwellers. These occurrences represent rare colonising events, compared to other groups that are known to have successfully diversified in these systems. A third species from an anchihaline cave system in the Yucatan Peninsula, Mexico, has been previously identified from cytochrome oxidase I (COI) barcodes. In this study, we reassess the species boundaries of this putative cave species using a phylogenomic dataset (20 specimens in 13 species, 100 exons, 18.7 kbp). We perform species delimitation analyses using robust full-coalescent methods for discovery and validation of hypotheses on species boundaries, as well as infer its phylogenetic relationships with species distributed in adjacent marine regions, in order to investigate the origin of this cave-adapted species. We assess which hypotheses on the origin of subterranean taxa can be applied to this species by taking into account its placement within the genus Ophionereis and its demographic history. We provide a detailed description of Ophionereis commutabilis n. sp., and evaluate its morphological characters in the light of its successful adaptation to life in caves.",Introgressive hybridisation between two widespread sharks in the east Pacific region.,https://www.ncbi.nlm.nih.gov/pubmed/30981810,Molecular phylogenetics and evolution,2019 05 27,"With just a handful of documented cases of hybridisation in cartilaginous fishes, shark hybridisation remains poorly investigated. Small amounts of admixture have been detected between Galapagos (Carcharhinus galapagensis) and dusky (Carcharhinus obscurus) sharks previously, generating a hypothesis of ongoing hybridisation. We sampled a large number of individuals from areas where the species co-occur (contact zones) across the Pacific Ocean and used both mitochondrial and nuclear-encoded SNPs to examine genetic admixture and introgression between the two species. Using empirical analytical approaches and simulations, we first developed a set of 1873 highly informative SNPs for these two species to evaluate the degree of admixture between them. Overall, results indicate a high discriminatory power of nuclear SNPs (FST = 0.47, p < 0.05) between the two species, unlike mitochondrial DNA (ΦST = 0.00 p > 0.05), which failed to differentiate these species. We identified four hybrid individuals (∼1%) and detected bi-directional introgression between C. galapagensis and C. obscurus in the Gulf of California along the east Pacific coast of the Americas. We emphasize the importance of including a combination of mtDNA and diagnostic nuclear markers to properly assess species identification, detect patterns of hybridisation, and better inform management and conservation of these sharks, especially given the morphological similarities within the genus Carcharhinus.","The kisspeptin derivative - kissorphin reduces the acquisition, expression and reinstatement of ethanol-induced conditioned place preference in rats.",https://www.ncbi.nlm.nih.gov/pubmed/30981809,"Alcohol (Fayetteville, N.Y.)",2019 04 14,"Research has shown that opioids are involved in the rewarding effects of ethanol. Neuropeptyde FF (NPFF) has been described as an anti-opioid peptide because it, in many cases, inhibits opioid and ethanol effects in rodents. Kissorphin (KSO) is a new peptide derived from kisspeptin-10 with structural similarities to NPFF. This peptide possesses NPFF-like biological activity in vitro. The aim of the current study was to investigate whether a KSO (Tyr-Asn-Trp-Asn-Ser-Phe-NH2) influences the acquisition, expression and reinstatement of ethanol-induced conditioned place preference (EtOH-CPP) in rats. The EtOH-CPP was established (conditioning for 5 days) by intraperitoneal (i.p.) administration of EtOH (1 g/kg, 20%, w/v) using an unbiased procedure. After that, one group of rats were used in final post-conditioning testing (expression of CPP) and the other group received priming injection of EtOH after 10 days of extinction (reinstatement of CPP). Our experiments showed that KSO, given intravenously (i.v.) at the doses of 1, 3 and 10 nmol before every EtOH administration inhibited the acquisition, and given acutely before the post-conditioning test or before the priming dose of EtOH inhibited the expression and reinstatement of EtOH-CPP, respectively, in a dose-dependent manner. KSO given itself, neither induced place preference nor aversion and did not alter locomotor activity and coordination of rats. These results suggest that KSO can alter rewarding/motivational effects of EtOH. These data suggest this peptide possesses an anti-opioid character.",Acute Alcohol and Cognition: Remembering What It Causes Us to Forget.,https://www.ncbi.nlm.nih.gov/pubmed/30981807,"Alcohol (Fayetteville, N.Y.)",2019 04 14,"Addiction has been conceptualized as a specific form of memory that appropriates typically adaptive neural mechanisms of learning to produce the progressive spiral of drug-seeking and drug-taking behavior, perpetuating the path to addiction through aberrant processes of drug-related learning and memory. From that perspective, to understand the development of alcohol use disorders it is critical to identify how a single exposure to alcohol enters into or alters the processes of learning and memory, so that involvement of and changes in neuroplasticity processes responsible for learning and memory can be identified early on. This review characterizes the effects produced by acute alcohol intoxication as a function of brain region and memory neurocircuitry. In general, exposure to ethanol doses that produce intoxicating effects causes consistent impairments in learning and memory processes mediated by specific brain circuitry, whereas lower doses either have no effect or produce a facilitation of memory under certain task conditions. Therefore, acute ethanol does not produce a global impairment of learning and memory, and can actually facilitate particular types of memory, perhaps particular types of memory that facilitate the development of excessive alcohol use. In addition, the effects on cognition are dependent on brain region, task demands, dose received, pharmacokinetics, and tolerance. Additionally, we explore the underlying alterations in neurophysiology produced by acute alcohol exposure that help to explain these changes in cognition and highlight future directions for research. Through understanding the impact acute alcohol intoxication has on cognition, the preliminary changes potentially causing a problematic addiction memory can better be identified.",Improved memory and reduced anxiety in δ-catenin transgenic mice.,https://www.ncbi.nlm.nih.gov/pubmed/30981806,Experimental neurology,2019 06 15,"δ-Catenin is abundant in the brain and affects its synaptic plasticity. Furthermore, loss of δ-catenin is related to the deficits of learning and memory, mental retardation (cri-du-chat syndrome), and autism. A few studies about δ-catenin deficiency mice were performed. However, the effect of δ-catenin overexpression in the brain has not been investigated as yet. Therefore we generated a δ-catenin overexpressing mouse model. To generate a transgenic mouse model overexpressing δ-catenin in the brain, δ-catenin plasmid having a Thy-1 promotor was microinjected in C57BL/6 mice. Our results showed δ-catenin transgenic mice expressed higher levels of N-cadherin, β-catenin, and p120-catenin than did wild type mice. Furthermore, δ-catenin transgenic mice exhibited better object recognition, better sociability, and lower anxiety than wild type mice. However, both mice groups showed a similar pattern in locomotion tests. Although δ-catenin transgenic mice show similar locomotion, they show improved sociability and reduced anxiety. These characteristics are opposite to the symptoms of autism or mental retardation, which are caused when δ-catenin is deficient. These results suggest that δ-catenin may alleviate symptoms of autism, Alzheimer's disease and mental retardation.",Detection of brain specific cardiolipins in plasma after experimental pediatric head injury.,https://www.ncbi.nlm.nih.gov/pubmed/30981805,Experimental neurology,2019 06 10,"Cardiolipin (CL) is a mitochondria-specific phospholipid that is central to maintenance and regulation of mitochondrial bioenergetic and metabolic functions. CL molecular species display great tissue variation with brain exhibiting a distinct, highly diverse CL population. We recently showed that the appearance of unique brain-type CLs in plasma could serve as a brain-specific marker of mitochondrial/tissue injury in patients after cardiac arrest. Mitochondrial dysfunction has been increasingly implicated as a critical mechanism underlying the pathogenesis of traumatic brain injury (TBI). Therefore, we hypothesized that unique, brain-specific CL species from the injured brain are released to the peripheral circulation after TBI. To test this hypothesis, we performed a high-resolution mass spectrometry based phospholipidomics analysis of post-natal day (PND)17 rat brain and plasma after controlled cortical impact. We found a time-dependent increase in plasma CLs after TBI including the aforementioned brain-specific CL species early after injury, whereas CLs were significantly decreased in the injured brain. Compositional and quantitative correlational analysis suggested a possible release of CL into the systemic circulation following TBI. The identification of brain-type CLs in systemic circulation may indicate underlying mitochondrial dysfunction/loss after TBI. They may have potential as pharmacodynamics response biomarkers for targeted therapies."

The worldwide pollution of the marine ecosystem by microplastics urgently demands novel environment-friendly MBs. In this study, Ca-alginate MBs were fabricated by electrospraying an aqueous alginate solution into distilled water containing calcium ions. The size and shape of the Ca-alginate MBs were controlled by electrospraying parameters, such as nozzle diameter and solution concentration. As the alginate concentration and needle diameter were increased, the size of alginate MBs was gradually increased, because of the higher mass flow rate. In addition, the adsorption and degradation behavior of alginate MBs were examined using model contaminants and sea water, respectively. In particular, alginate MBs rapidly degraded in sea water, due to the reversible ion-exchange reaction between Ca2+ in MBs and Na+ in sea water. Therefore, the electrosprayed Ca-alginate MBs offer a promising alternative for environment-friendly cosmetic additives.","Isolation, structure elucidation, and immunostimulatory activity of polysaccharide fractions from Boswellia carterii frankincense resin.",https://www.ncbi.nlm.nih.gov/pubmed/30981779,International journal of biological macromolecules,2019 06 04,"Frankincense has a long history in religious, cultural, and medicinal use. In this study polysaccharides were extracted from frankincense from Boswellia carterii. The polysaccharides were purified by anion exchange chromatography on a DEAE-Sepharose Fast Flow 16/10 FPLC column. Six fractions were obtained and the three most active immunomodulatory fractions were further purified by size exclusion chromatography on a Superdex-200 column. The composition showed the monosaccharides present were predominantly galactose, arabinose, and glucuronic acid along with small amounts of rhamnose and glucose. The monosaccharide composition and glycosyl linkage analysis revealed the polysaccharides belong to the type II arabinogalactans. Fourier-transform infrared spectroscopy and bicinchoninic acid assay showed that the amount of protein in the samples was <1 wt%. One-dimensional 1H NMR were consistent with high molecular weight compounds. The monosaccharides were primarily in the β conformation. The three fractions exhibited an immunostimulatory effect on RAW 264.7 murine macrophage cells. The most active immunostimulatory fraction FA2, stimulated a range of pro-inflammatory mediators including iNOS, NO, TNF-α, and IL-6 in RAW 264.7 cells. The fractions were effective in proliferating primary murine splenocytes. The results indicate that the polysaccharides isolated from frankincense have the potential to be used as an immunological stimulant or nutraceutical.","A novel mitochondrial genome fragmentation pattern in Liposcelis brunnea, the type species of the genus Liposcelis (Psocodea: Liposcelididae).",https://www.ncbi.nlm.nih.gov/pubmed/30981778,International journal of biological macromolecules,2019 05 21,"Booklice in the genus Liposcelis (Psocodea: Liposcelididae) are essential storage pests worldwide. Fragmented mt genomes have been identified in the Liposcelis species together with the typical mitochondrial (mt) genome, which is a single circular chromosome with 37 genes. Gene rearrangement, pseudogenes, and repeat regions (RRs) are very common among fragmented mt genomes. We sequenced the mt genome of the booklouse L. brunnea, the type species of the genus Liposcelis. We identified 37 genes in the mt genome of L. brunnea, which was fragmented into three chromosomes. The chromosomes I, II, III were 7.3 kb, 5.5 kb, and 5.3 kb in size with 9, 19, and 15 genes, respectively. In addition, 16 pseudogenes and four repeat regions were present in three chromosomes. Gene rearrangement in the mt genome of L. brunnea was obvious compared to that in other mt genomes in the genus Liposcelis. We found a possible correlation among mt genome rearrangement, the morphological classification standard, and phylogenetic relationships. In summary, a three-chromosome mt genome in an insect was identified for the first time, which may aid in understanding mt genome fragmentation, gene rearrangement, and evolution.",Chitosan microparticle-based immunoaffinity chromatography supports prepared by membrane emulsification technique: Characterization and application.,https://www.ncbi.nlm.nih.gov/pubmed/30981776,International journal of biological macromolecules,2019 05 07,"In this study, chitosan microparticles intended to be used as matrix support for immunoaffinity chromatography were prepared by membrane emulsification technique.

Size distribution and chemical stability of the prepared chitosan microparticles were relatively close to those of Sepharose 4B. Polyclonal antibody against zearalenone (ZEN) as a model ligand was coupled onto chitosan microparticles or Sepharose 4B to obtain immunoaffinity columns.

In this study, the first GH family 27 α-galactosidase gene from Irpex lacteus was cloned. The gene had an open reading frame of 1314 bp interrupted by 12 introns. The recombinant α-galactosidase expressed in Pichia pastoris (rILgalA) had an apparent molecular mass of 64 kDa and was highly N-glycosylated. rILgalA was maximally active at pH 4.8 and 70 °C. It was stable over a broad pH range of 3-11, retained 90% of its activity after incubation at 60 °C for 10 h and exhibited strong resistance to digestive proteases. Unlike many other α-galactosidases, rILgalA was hyperactive on RFOs. Its specific activities toward melibiose, raffinose and stachyose were 644, 755 and 833 U mg-1, respectively. The corresponding Kcat/Km values were 120, 130 and 180 mM-1 s-1, which were the highest among reported α-galactosidases. rILgalA almost completely hydrolyzed raffinose and stachyose in soymilk at 60 °C in 30 min.

Hepatitis B virus (HBV) is a key driver of liver cancer. In the present study, we found that HULC remarkably elevated the levels of HBeAg, HBsAg, HBcAg, pgRNA, HBx, HBV DNA and covalently closed circular DNA (cccDNA), which activated the HBV replication in HBV-expressing hepatoma cells or de novo HBV-infected cell lines (PHH, HepG2-NTCP and dHepaRG). Mechanistically, HULC enhanced HBV cccDNA stability by down-regulating the APOBEC3B in hepatoma cells. HULC significantly up-regulated microRNA-539, which targeted the 3'UTR of APOBEC3B mRNA. Luciferase reporter gene assays revealed a putative STAT3-binding site located in the upstream of miR-539 promoter. Moreover, we identified that HULC was able to elevate HBx, which co-activated the STAT3 to stimulate the miR-539 promoter. Then, miR-539 down-regulated APOBEC3B and promoted HBV replication. Functionally, HULC enhanced the growth of hepatoma cells by activating HBV in vitro and in vivo, which could be blocked by overexpressing APOBEC3B.

However, the role of STYX in colorectal cancer (CRC) remains unknown. In this study, we found that STYX was highly expressed in CRC tissues and closely correlated with tumor development and survival of CRC patients. In vitro studies showed that overexpression of STYX promoted proliferation, migration, invasion, and epithelial-mesenchymal transition (EMT) and inhibited apoptosis in CRC cells, while STYX knockdown had the opposite effects. Consistently, in vivo experiments showed that overexpression of STYX promoted tumor growth and lung metastasis. Mechanically, STYX bound to the F-box and WD repeat domain-containing7 (FBXW7) protein and inhibited its function. Co-regulation of STYX and FBXW7 expression reversed the biological changes mediated by regulation of STYX expression alone in CRC cells. Additionally, FBXW7 expression was negatively associated with STYX expression in CRC tissues, and low STYX levels accompanying high FBXW7 levels predicted favorable prognosis of CRC patients. In conclusion, our results suggest that STYX plays an oncogenic role by inhibiting FBXW7 and represents a potential therapeutic target and prognostic biomarker in CRC.",Design and Synthesis of Galactose-Biotin Lipid Materials for Liposomes to Promote the Hepatoma Cell-Targeting Effect.,https://www.ncbi.nlm.nih.gov/pubmed/30981753,Journal of pharmaceutical sciences,2019 05 07,"A series of novel low-toxic hepatoma cell-targeting lipid materials were designed and synthesized, in which monogalactose, digalactose, and galactose-biotin were used as targeting moieties and hydrophilic heads while stearate was used as hydrophobic tail (Mono-Gal-ST, Di-Gal-ST, and Gal-Biotin-ST). The corresponding galactose-biotin-modified liposomes (Mono-Gal-LPs, Di-Gal-LPs, and Gal-Biotin-LPs) and conventional liposomes (LPs) were prepared. These galactose-biotin-modified liposomes can distinguish hepatoma cells from other tissue cells owing to the recognition of asialoglycoprotein receptor by galactose group. Moreover, the ability of liposomes to distinguish hepatoma cells from normal hepatocytes follows a trend of LPs < Mono-Gal-LPs < Di-Gal-LPs < Gal-Biotin-LPs, which is attributed to the cluster glycoside effect and the synergistic effect of galactose and biotin. In addition, the endocytosis of these galactose-biotin-modified liposomes were competitively inhibited by galactose, further confirming these liposomes entered hepatoma cells via asialoglycoprotein receptor-mediated pathway.",Fat preference and fat intake in individuals with and without anorexia nervosa.,https://www.ncbi.nlm.nih.gov/pubmed/30981752,Appetite,2019 06 11,"Fat restriction is a characteristic eating behavior among individuals with anorexia nervosa (AN), and laboratory meal studies demonstrate restricted fat intake among low-weight patients. The Geiselman Food Preference Questionnaire-I© (FPQ) is a validated self-report measure that yields a fat preference score (FPS). Prior research reported that patients with AN had a significantly lower FPS than did healthy control (HC) participants. The goal of the current study was to compare self-reported fat preference (FPS) to fat intake (multi-item meal (MIM) study) in low-weight ANs and HCs. Specific aims were 1) to determine if the FPS differed between ANs and HCs; 2) to determine if fat and energy intakes differed between ANs and HCs; and 3) to determine if the FPS was associated with fat and energy intakes in ANs and HCs. Forty-four female AN inpatients and 48 female HCs completed the FPQ and participated in a MIM study.

The FPS was significantly and positively correlated with caloric intake (r = 0.481, p < 0.01), total fat (r = 0.453, p < 0.01), and the percentage of calories from fat (r = 0.37, p < 0.05) in ANs as well as in HCs (kcal: r = 0.583, p < 0.001; fat: r = 0.621, p < 0.001; % fat kcal: r = 0.601, p < 0.001). The FPS is related to objective measures of energy and fat intake in patients with AN as well as in healthy individuals.",Near-infrared-light induced nanoparticles with enhanced tumor tissue penetration and intelligent drug release.,https://www.ncbi.nlm.nih.gov/pubmed/30981751,Acta biomaterialia,2019 05 13,"Tumor tissue presents much denser and stiffer extracellular matrix (ECM), which can hinder the penetration of most nanoparticles (NPs) and contribute to the tumor cell proliferation. Here, NIR-activated losartan was encapsulated in hollow mesoporous prussian blue nanoparticles (HMPBs) to degrade ECM. The results showed that losartan enhanced the penetration of DOX, 1.47% of the injected dose (ID) of DOX reached the tumor tissues, which was 3.00-fold higher than the control group (0.49%). In addition, as the existence of thermo-sensitive lauric acid, (Losartan + DOX)@HMPBs could achieve near ""zero drug leakage"" during blood circulation, so as to reduce the damage of DOX to normal tissues. Furthermore, the animal experiments proved tumor inhibition ability of (Losartan + DOX)@HMPBs in synergistic of photothermal/chemotherapy, with the tumor growth inhibition rate of 81.3%. Taken together, these findings can be a candidate for developing vectors with enhanced tumor penetration and therapeutic effect in future clinical application. STATEMENT OF SIGNIFICANCE: Due to the existence of denser extracellular matrices (ECM), only 0.7% of the administered nanoparticles dose is delivered to tumor, which will limit the tumors' therapeutic effect. Degradation of ECM can improve the penetration of nanoparticles in tumors. However, no researchers has encapsulated losartan in nanoparticles to degrade ECM. Herein, we developed a NIR induced losartan and DOX co-delivery system based on hollow mesoporous prussian blue nanoparticles (HMPBs) to degrade ECM and improve the penetration of nanoparticles in tumors. The prepared nanoparticles can also acheive near ""zero drug leakage"" during blood circulation and ""fixed-point drug release"" in tumor, so as to reduce the damage of DOX to normal tissues. We believe the prepared nanoparticles provide a new platform for cancer treatment.",Effects of a prevention program on multiple health-compromising behaviours in adolescence: A cluster randomized controlled trial.,https://www.ncbi.nlm.nih.gov/pubmed/30981750,Preventive medicine,2019 05 24,"We aimed to assess the effectiveness of 'Paesaggi di Prevenzione', a school-based prevention program delivered by trained teachers and designed to tackle smoking, alcohol misuse, dietary risks, and physical inactivity in adolescence. We evaluated the program between 2010 and 2013 with a two-arm, parallel-group, multicentre cluster randomized controlled trial in which schools were the units of randomization. We collected data on health-compromising behaviours using self-reported measurements of behaviour frequency administered before and after program implementation. We used multivariable mixed-effects logistic regression models to estimate program effects on health-compromising behaviours. The analysis sample included 3410 middle school students and 1651 high school students. Among middle school students, mean age at baseline was 12 years (standard deviation [SD] 0.5 years), 51% were boys, and 41% had high socioeconomic status [SES] (defined as having at least one parent/guardian with university level education). In high school students, mean age at baseline was 14 years (SD 0.7 years), 56% were boys, and 31% had high SES. The program did not have effects on smoking, alcohol misuse, and physical activity. The program had iatrogenic effects in regard to some eating behaviours, resulting in (i) lower odds of fruit consumption among middle-school students (odds ratio [OR] 0.82; 95% confidence interval [CI] 0.68-0.99) and (ii) lower odds of having breakfast every day in high-school students at the post-intervention measurement (OR 0.76; 95%CI 0.58-0.99) but not at one-year follow-up (OR 0.94; 95%CI 0.69-1.28). Due to the possibility of unintended effects, we advise against disseminating 'Paesaggi di Prevenzione' in its present form. TRIAL REGISTRATION: ISRCTN00953701.",Improvement in inflammation is associated with the protective effect of Gly-Pro-Glu and cycloprolylglycine against Aβ-induced depletion of the hippocampal somatostatinergic system.,https://www.ncbi.nlm.nih.gov/pubmed/30981749,Neuropharmacology,2019 05 21,"Glycine-proline-glutamate (GPE) is a cleaved tripeptide of IGF-I that can be processed to cycloprolylglycine (cPG) in the brain. IGF-I protects the hippocampal somatostatinergic system from β-amyloid (Aβ) insult and although neither IGF-I-derived peptides bind to IGF-I receptors, they exert protective actions in several neurological disorders. As their effects on the hippocampal somatostatinergic system remain unknown, the objective of this study was to evaluate if cPG and/or GPE prevent the deleterious effects of Aβ25-35 infusion on this system and whether changes in intracellular-related signaling and interleukin (IL) content are involved in their protective effect. We also determined the effect of cPG or GPE co-administration with Aβ25-35 on IL secretion in glial cultures and the influence of these ILs on signaling activation and somatostatin synthesis in neuronal cultures. cPG or GPE co-administration reduced Aβ-induced cell death and pro-inflammatory ILs, increased IL-4 and partially avoided the reduction of components of the somatostatinergic system affected by Aβ25-35. GPE increased activation of Akt and CREB and reduced GSK3β activation and astrogliosis, whereas cPG increased phosphorylation of extracellular signal-regulated kinases. Both peptides converged in the activation of mTOR and S6 kinase. Co-administration of these peptides with Aβ25-35 to glial cultures increased IL-4 and reduced IL-1β; this release of IL-4 could be responsible for activation of Akt and increased somatostatin in neuronal cultures. Our findings suggest that cPG and GPE exert protective effects against Aβ on the somatostatinergic system by a reduction of the inflammatory environment that may activate different pro-survival pathways in these neurons.",Pulpotomy for carious pulp exposures in permanent teeth: A systematic review and meta-analysis.,https://www.ncbi.nlm.nih.gov/pubmed/30981748,Journal of dentistry,2019 05 04,"The most commonly-accepted strategy for managing irreversible pulpitis, an irreversible condition of dental pulp inflammation, is root canal treatment, which is limited by high costs and complex techniques.

Currently available data indicate that retinal microvasculature changes are detectable in children as young as six years of age, however, there are no data for younger children. We present retinal microvasculature measurement from the first two years of life. Retinal images suitable for analysis were available from 18 infants in our proof-of-concept study. The mean and standard deviation (SD) for birth weight and gestation was 3410 (384) g and 39.1(1.4) weeks, respectively. Retinal vessel calibres were summarized as the mean(SD) central retinal arteriolar equivalent (CRAE) at six months of age was 156 (32) μm, increased to 175 (75) μm by 12 months and a slightly declined by 24 months of age to 168 (50) μm. In a similar pattern, mean(SD) central retinal venular equivalent (CRVE) at six months was 211 (19) μm, increased to 238 (25) μm by 12 months of age followed by a slight decline at 24 months of age to 222 (36) μm. The arterio-venous ratio and tortuosity index remained the same at 6, 12 and 24 months. Findings from this study could help future investigators better understand early microvasculature changes and adaptation that occur early in life."

Examples include the spread of beneficial mutations, chemical reactions, and the invasions by foreign species. In homogeneous environments, the alternative states are separated by a smooth front moving at a constant velocity. This simple picture can break down in structured environments such as tissues, patchy landscapes, and microfluidic devices. Habitat fragmentation can pin the front at a particular location or lock invasion velocities into specific values. Locked velocities are not sensitive to moderate changes in dispersal or growth and are determined by the spatial and temporal periodicity of the environment. The synchronization with the environment results in discontinuous fronts that propagate as periodic pulses. We characterize the transition from continuous to locked invasions and show that it is controlled by positive density-dependence in dispersal or growth. We also demonstrate that velocity locking is robust to demographic and environmental fluctuations and examine stochastic dynamics and evolution in locked invasions.",Modulation of biological responses to 2 ns electrical stimuli by field reversal.,https://www.ncbi.nlm.nih.gov/pubmed/30981731,Biochimica et biophysica acta. Biomembranes,2019 05 17,"Nanosecond bipolar pulse cancellation, a recently discovered phenomenon, is modulation of the effects of a unipolar electric pulse exposure by a second pulse of opposite polarity. This attenuation of biological response by reversal of the electric field direction has been reported with pulse durations from 60 ns to 900 ns for a wide range of endpoints, and it is not observed with conventional electroporation pulses of much longer duration (>100 μs) where pulses are additive regardless of polarity. The most plausible proposed mechanisms involve the field-driven migration of ions to and from the membrane interface (accelerated membrane discharge). Here we report 2 ns bipolar pulse cancellation, extending the scale of previously published results down to the time required to construct the permeabilizing lipid electropores observed in molecular simulations. We add new cancellation endpoints, and we describe new bipolar pulse effects that are distinct from cancellation. This new data, which includes transport of cationic and anionic permeability indicators, fluorescence of membrane labels, and patterns of entry into permeabilized cells, is not readily explained by the accelerated discharge mechanism. We suggest that multi-step processes that involve first charged species movement and then responses of cellular homeostasis and repair mechanisms are more likely to explain the broad range of reported results.",tRNA Methylation Is a Global Determinant of Bacterial Multi-drug Resistance.,https://www.ncbi.nlm.nih.gov/pubmed/30981730,Cell systems,2019 05 07,"Gram-negative bacteria are intrinsically resistant to drugs because of their double-membrane envelope structure that acts as a permeability barrier and as an anchor for efflux pumps. Antibiotics are blocked and expelled from cells and cannot reach high-enough intracellular concentrations to exert a therapeutic effect. Efforts to target one membrane protein at a time have been ineffective. Here, we show that m1G37-tRNA methylation determines the synthesis of a multitude of membrane proteins via its control of translation at proline codons near the start of open reading frames. Decreases in m1G37 levels in Escherichia coli and Salmonella impair membrane structure and sensitize these bacteria to multiple classes of antibiotics, rendering them incapable of developing resistance or persistence. Codon engineering of membrane-associated genes reduces their translational dependence on m1G37 and confers resistance. These findings highlight the potential of tRNA methylation in codon-specific translation to control the development of multi-drug resistance in Gram-negative bacteria.",N-Glycoproteomics of Patient-Derived Xenografts: A Strategy to Discover Tumor-Associated Proteins in High-Grade Serous Ovarian Cancer.,https://www.ncbi.nlm.nih.gov/pubmed/30981729,Cell systems,2019 04 25,"High-grade serous ovarian carcinoma (HGSC) is the most common and lethal subtype of gynecologic malignancy in women.

It is imperative that clinicians are cognizant of subtle clues on these imaging modalities that alert them to the possibility of PH. These clues may serve as a stepping stone towards more advanced noninvasive (echocardiogram) and invasive (right heart catheterization) testing. On the CT scan, the signs are classified into mediastinal and lung parenchymal abnormalities. In addition to suspecting the diagnosis of PH, this paper provides a pictorial essay to guide health care professionals in identifying the etiology of PH. This paper also provides concrete definitions, wherever possible, of what constitutes abnormalities in PH, such as dilated pulmonary arteries, right ventricle, pruning of vessels, and thickness of free wall of the right ventricle.

Though a host of drugs are available for the treatment of hypertension, majority have been linked to adverse side effects, necessitating the need for research into natural compounds with fewer side effects. Kaempferol-7-O-α-L-rhamnopyroside (KR) is a glycosylated flavone with neuroprotective and anti-inflammatory effects. However, no available literature exists on its vasodilatory effect. This study examined the pharmacological effect of KR on vasodilation/vasorelaxation and its mechanism of action in endothelial cells and rat thoracic aorta. Treatment of phenylephrine (PE; 2 × 10-6 M)-pre-contracted aortic rings with KR induced endothelium-dependent relaxation, which was suppressed by NG-nitro-l-arginine methyl ester (L-NAME; 10-4 M), (nitric oxide synthase (NOS) inhibitor).

Furthermore, KR also increased protein kinase G (PKG) levels whereas it suppressed levels of phosphorylated myosin light chain (MLC) and protein kinase C (PKC) in aortic rings. These results suggest that KR induces endothelium-dependent vasorelaxation via the NO-cGMP-PKG pathway.","Global, national, and urban burdens of paediatric asthma incidence attributable to ambient NO2 pollution: estimates from global datasets.",https://www.ncbi.nlm.nih.gov/pubmed/30981709,The Lancet.

The hypothalamic-pituitary-adrenal (HPA)-axis is a key neuroendocrine signalling system involved in physiological homeostasis and stress response. In individuals, dysregulation of this system is closely associated with behavioral deficits and mood disorders. Various preclinical models of paternal stress have demonstrated robust behavioral shifts but little is known about the intergenerational modification of HPA axis function. This review will present evidence drawn from a range of laboratory mouse and rat models that the intergenerational influence of paternal stress on offspring behavioral phenotypes involve some level of HPA axis dysregulation.

To determine the potential mechanisms of NMS, we systematically investigated the direct effects of NMS on the hypothalamic-pituitary-testicular (HPT) axis of male pigs in vitro. We initially confirmed that NMU2R distributed in isolated hypothalamic cells, anterior pituitary cells and Leydig cells using immunocytochemistry. Subsequently we investigated the direct effects of NMS on hormone secretion from cells (anterior pituitary cells and Leydig cells) treated with different doses of NMS. The results showed that NMS increase the release of LH and FSH from anterior pituitary cells and testosterone from Leydig cells. NMS up-regulated the expression of NMU2R and GnRH mRNAs in hypothalamic cells, NMU2R, LH and FSH mRNAs in anterior pituitary cells, and NMU2R, STAR, P450 and 3β-HSD mRNAs and the expression of PCNA and Cyclin B1 protein in Leydig cells; moreover, it down-regulated the expression of GnIH mRNA in hypothalamic cells. Using immunofluorescence staining and confocal microscopy, we also demonstrated the colocalization of NMU2R and AR or GnIH in Leydig cells. These data in vitro indicated that NMS may regulate the release and/or synthesis of LH, FSH and testosterone at different levels of the reproductive axis through NMU2R, which provided novel evidence of the potential roles of NMS in regulation of pig reproduction.",Differential expression of miR-155 and Let-7a in the plasma of childhood asthma: Potential biomarkers for diagnosis and severity.,https://www.ncbi.nlm.nih.gov/pubmed/30981701,Clinical biochemistry,2019 06 13,"MicroRNAs (miRNAs) are emerging gene expression regulators and their expression has been linked to various biological processes.

Here we demonstrate a set of experimental and computational approaches using gastric fundus smooth muscles to improve the validity of quantitative isPLA. Appropriate positive and negative biological controls and PLA technical controls were selected to ensure experimental rigor. To account for changes in morphology between relaxed and contracted smooth muscles, target PLA spots were normalized to smooth muscle myosin light chain 20 PLA spots or the cellular cross-sectional areas. We describe the computational steps necessary to filter out false-positive improperly sized spots and set the thresholds for counting true positive PLA spots to quantify the PLA signals. We tested our approach by examining protein phosphorylation and protein interactions in smooth muscle myofilament Ca2+ sensitization pathways from resting and contracted gastric fundus smooth muscles. In conclusion, our tissue-level isPLA method enables unbiased quantitation of protein phosphorylation and protein-protein interactions in intact smooth muscle tissues, suggesting the potential for quantitative isPLA applications in other types of intact tissues.",Crossly charged microfluidic device for spontaneous filtration without an external power supply.,https://www.ncbi.nlm.nih.gov/pubmed/30981699,Analytical biochemistry,2019 06 04,"Spontaneous filtration without a power supply was investigated using highly charged precursor mixtures instead of recognized microfluidic desalination techniques. The proposed filtration method consisted of a main channel (depth: 1 mm) and shallow channels (depth: 400 μm) in which the precursor mixture was injected. The filtration performance of the proposed device was evaluated by injecting a fluorescent dye that moved toward the centerline of the main channel. The respective rejection rates of CaCl2, NaCl, CaSO4, and Na2SO4 were 3.16%, 30.13%, 43.74%, and 36.32%, respectively. This trend can be explained by the mechanism of Donnan exclusion theory. The focusing of charged species toward the centerline of the main channel was caused by highly charged surfaces. The proposed filtration method exhibited a migration of charged microparticles toward a certain direction. This particle migration behavior was consistent with the simulation data. These results suggested that the proposed filtration method had strong potential for desalinating brackish water or salty surface water without an external power supply.",Cellular senescence and radiation-induced pulmonary fibrosis.,https://www.ncbi.nlm.nih.gov/pubmed/30981698,Translational research : the journal of laboratory and clinical medicine,2019 06 10,"Radiation-induced pulmonary fibrosis (RIPF) is a serious treatment complication that affects about 9%-30% cancer patients receiving radiotherapy for thoracic tumors.

Unfortunately, the mechanisms by which radiation causes RIPF have not been well established nor has an effective treatment for RIPF been developed. Recently, an increasing body of evidence suggests that induction of senescence by radiation may play an important role in RIPF and clearance of senescent cells (SnCs) with a senolytic agent, small molecule that can selectively kill SnCs, has the potential to be developed as a novel therapeutic strategy for RIPF.

As the bubbles strongly oscillate, their (equilibrium) sizes are not directly observable. Here, a method is presented to experimentally determine the size distribution in bubble populations from high-speed imaging of the bubbles in oscillation. To this end, a spherical bubble model is applied in statistical fashion. This technique is applied to several experimentally realized bubble structures: streamer filaments, clusters, and a peculiar structure we report here on, the acoustically cavitated jet. It is generated by the sonication of a submerged jet to produce abundant cavitation at low flow velocities. Our analysis is complemented by numerical exploration of the hydrodynamic and acoustic properties of the experimental configuration in which the observed bubble structures are formed.",Criteria for the diagnosis of idiopathic pleuroparenchymal fibroelastosis: A proposal.,https://www.ncbi.nlm.nih.gov/pubmed/30981683,Respiratory investigation,2019 04 14,"Physicians have few opportunities to perform surgical lung biopsy (SLB) to diagnose idiopathic pleuroparenchymal fibroelastosis (IPPFE).

We also observed a statistically significant decrease in alternative and cytochrome respiratory pathways in response to BRZ treatment under salinity conditions. We showed that production of the lipid second messenger phosphatidic acid (PA) is impaired in dgk mutants in response to EBL treatment and inhibitor of diacylglycerol kinase (DGK) - R59022.

Chemical interaction by these species is common and is characterized by one and two electron oxidation, nitrosylation, nitration and sulfuration/polysulfidation reactions. NO and H2S are gases that penetrate cell membranes, are synthesized by specific enzymes, are ubiquitous, regulate protein activities through post-translational modifications and participate in cell signaling. The two molecules at high concentrations compared to physiological concentrations may result in cellular damage particularly through their interaction with other reactive species. NO and H2S can interact with each other and form a variety of molecular species which may have constructive or destructive behavior depending on the cell type, the cellular environment (ex. oxygen tension, pH, redox state), where the products are produced and in what concentrations. Cross talk exists between NO and H2S, whereby they can influence the generation and signaling behavior of each other. Given the above mentioned properties of NO and H2S and studies in cancer cells and animal models employing NO and H2S donors that generate higher than physiological concentrations of NO and H2S and are effective in killing cancer cells but not normal cells, lend credence to the possibility of the utility of these donors in an approach to the treatment of cancer.",Myocardial protection by propolis during prolonged hypothermic preservation.,https://www.ncbi.nlm.nih.gov/pubmed/30981678,Cryobiology,2019 05 27,"Oxidative stress is involved in the pathogenesis of ischemia-reperfusion during myocardial transplantation. Therefore, graft preservation solutions may be improved by supplementation with antioxidants to minimize graft dysfunction caused by cold ischemic injury. Propolis is a polyphenol-rich substance which has an important antioxidant activity. The protective effect of propolis against oxidative stress induced by prolonged cold preservation of heart was investigated. Mice were subjected to a hypothermic model of ischemia in which hearts were preserved for 24 h at 4 °C in Krebs-Hensleit (KH) solution in the absence or presence of propolis concentrations (50, 150 and 250 μg/ml). Levels of released Lactate dehydrogenase (LDH), Creatine phosphokinase (CPK) and Troponine-I (Trop I) were assessed in the preservation solution and histological assessement of heart ischemia injuries was performed. Oxidative stress biomarkers malondialdehyde (MDA) and advanced oxidation protein products (AOPP) and antioxidant enzymes superoxide dismutase (SOD) and catalase (CAT) were assessed in cardiac tissue. Mitochondria were isolated from stored hearts and production of reactive oxygen species (ROS) was tested. Propolis supplementation protected efficiently hearts during preservation by reducing significantly levels of lipids and proteins oxidation and restoring activities of antioxidant enzymes. Also, propolis preserved tissue integrity altered by hypothermic ischemia in a concentration-dependent manner. Propolis reduced significantly the rate of H2O2 produced by mitochondrial respiration, the best antioxidant effect being obtained at the highest propolis concentration (250 μg/ml).

We tested how the receptor noise limited model, widely used in behavioural ecology, matched actual colour discrimination thresholds obtained using behavioural tests. Guppies (Poecilia reticulata) were first trained to push a target coloured disk placed among eight grey disks of various luminances on a grey plate. Guppies were then tested to find target disks, which varied in colour contrast from the plate. The target disks followed a gradient going from high contrast to inconspicuous against the grey background. We plotted the percentage of correct choices of each colour in the gradient against the model prediction and determined the discrimination thresholds using the inflection point of the fitted sigmoid curve. We performed the experiment on six colour gradients: red, orange, yellow, green, blue and purple. Four colour gradients: red, orange, green and blue, showed a discrimination threshold that matched the model predictions. However, deviations of the model for the yellow and purple gradients suggest that ecological relevance of some colours could affect decision-making in behavioural tests and that we can no longer assume that the rules for colour discrimination are independent of colours."

The two enriched in arginine, poly(GR) and poly(PR), infiltrate liquid-like nucleoli, co-localize with the nucleolar protein nucleophosmin (NPM1), and alter the phase separation behavior of NPM1 in vitro. Here, we show that poly(PR) DPRs bind tightly to a long acidic tract within the intrinsically disordered region of NPM1, altering its phase separation with nucleolar partners to the extreme of forming large, soluble complexes that cause droplet dissolution in vitro. In cells, poly(PR) DPRs disperse NPM1 from nucleoli and entrap rRNA in static condensates in a DPR-length-dependent manner. We propose that R-rich DPR toxicity involves disrupting the role of phase separation by NPM1 in organizing ribosomal proteins and RNAs within the nucleolus.",Structural Basis of Dot1L Stimulation by Histone H2B Lysine 120 Ubiquitination.,https://www.ncbi.nlm.nih.gov/pubmed/30981630,Molecular cell,2019 06 07,"The essential histone H3 lysine 79 methyltransferase Dot1L regulates transcription and genomic stability and is deregulated in leukemia. The activity of Dot1L is stimulated by mono-ubiquitination of histone H2B on lysine 120 (H2BK120Ub); however, the detailed mechanism is not understood. We report cryo-EM structures of human Dot1L bound to (1) H2BK120Ub and (2) unmodified nucleosome substrates at 3.5 Å and 4.9 Å, respectively. Comparison of both structures, complemented with biochemical experiments, provides critical insights into the mechanism of Dot1L stimulation by H2BK120Ub. Both structures show Dot1L binding to the same extended surface of the histone octamer. In yeast, this surface is used by silencing proteins involved in heterochromatin formation, explaining the mechanism of their competition with Dot1. These results provide a strong foundation for understanding conserved crosstalk between histone modifications found at actively transcribed genes and offer a general model of how ubiquitin might regulate the activity of chromatin enzymes.","High-dose intravenous versus oral iron in blood donors with iron deficiency: The IronWoMan randomized, controlled clinical trial.",https://www.ncbi.nlm.nih.gov/pubmed/30981629,"Clinical nutrition (Edinburgh, Scotland)",2019 04 14,"Frequent blood donation often leads to iron deficiency and even anemia but appropriate strategies for detection and prevention are currently not mandatory.

Five hundred and two children were evaluated; 226 blood and 356 pleural fluid samples were obtained and tested using Realtime-PCR and culture. In the pre-PCV13 era S. pneumoniae was the most frequent pathogen identified (64/90; 71.1%) with a large predominance of serotypes 1 (42.4%), 3 (23.7%), 7F (5.1%) and 19A (11.9%). The impact of vaccination, calculated on children 0-8 years of age, demonstrated a significant reduction of PPE: with an incidence rate of 2.82 (95%CL 2.32-3.41) in the pre-PCV13 era and an age-standardized rate (ASR) of 0.66 (95% CL 0.37-1.99) in the post-PCV13 era, p < 0.0001. No increase in non-PCV13 serotypes was recorded. S. pneumoniae remained the most frequent pathogen identified in the post-PCV13 era in unvaccinated children with an unchanged serotype distribution: respectively 26/66 (39.4%), 25/66 (37.9%), 5/66 (7.6%), and 4/66 (6.1%) for 1, 3, 7F and 19A. On the other hand 7F and 19A disappeared in vaccinated children and serotype 1 and 3 decreased by 91.8% and 31.5%, respectively. Realtime PCR was significantly more sensitive than culture both in pleural fluid (79.7% vs 12.5%) and in blood (17.8% vs 7.4%). In conclusion, our findings indicate that routine immunization with PCV13 has significantly reduced the burden of childhood PPE in vaccinated children, without increasing PPE due to other bacteria and without serotype shift. Moreover, the impact of PCV13 may be underestimated due to the increase in pneumococcal surveillance in Italy. Data has also shown that Real-time PCR is an essential tool to better define the etiology of PPE and to monitor vaccination plans.

In reducing microenvironment, the title compounds could be reduced to platinum(II) complex accompanied with two equivalents of coumarin units. By a unique mechanism, the 7-hydroxycoumarin platinum(IV) complex attacks DNA via the released platinum(II) compound, meanwhile it also inhibits the activities of cyclooxygenase by coumarin fragment. This action mechanism might be of much benefit for reducing tumor-related inflammation in the progress of inhibiting tumor proliferation and overcoming cisplatin resistance.

Therefore, there is a need for developing next generation sequencing (NGS) and bioinformatic workflows that can be routinely used for the assessment of prognostic and predictive biomarkers.",A checklist for intrahospital transport of critically ill patients improves compliance with transportation safety guidelines.,https://www.ncbi.nlm.nih.gov/pubmed/30981603,Australian critical care : official journal of the Confederation of Australian Critical Care Nurses,2019 04 14,"Critically ill patients are often transferred from the intensive care unit (ICU) to other locations around the hospital during which adverse events, some life threatening, are common. An intercollegiate guideline covering the transport of critically ill patients exists in Australasia; however, compliance with this guideline has previously been shown to be poor, and its role in improving safety in transportation of patients in the ICU is unknown. We performed a pre-post interventional study in a tertiary metropolitan ICU, assessing the impact of the introduction of a transport checklist on guideline compliance.",Enzymatic and molecular characterization of an endoglucanase E from Clostridium cellulovorans 743B.,https://www.ncbi.nlm.nih.gov/pubmed/30981600,Journal of bioscience and bioengineering,2019 04 14,"Endoglucanase E (EngE) is a cellulosomal enzyme of the glycoside hydrolase family 5 generated by the cellulosome-producing bacterium Clostridium cellulovorans 743B. Although its basic activities and properties have been characterized, its substrate specificity, product range, and steady-state kinetics remain unclear. The current study prepared recombinant EngE (rEngE) and analyzed its substrate specificity and product range using thin layer chromatography. When carboxymethyl cellulose (CMC) or phosphoric acid swollen cellulose was used as a substrate, disaccharides and trisaccharides were the main products. However, no product was detected with microcrystalline cellulose as the substrate. This indicated that rEngE is a cellulase that hydrolyzes low-crystallinity cellulose. Furthermore, products were detected when glucomannan, lichenan, or β-glucan was used, but no product was obtained with xylan. These results suggested that rEngE hydrolyzes the β-1,4 glycosidic bond between glucose residues of the substrate. In the kinetic analysis, at CMC concentrations of ≥3 mg/mL, the reaction rate decreased. Application of the above data to three substrate inhibition models generated a better fit to a model that generates products not only from the enzyme-substrate complex but also from enzyme-substrate-substrate (ESS) complexes, in which two substrates are bound to the enzymes. In addition, it was found that a carbohydrate-binding module (CBM) contained in EngE binds to cellulose. Therefore, substrate inhibition likely occurred because the binding site of CBM may correspond to one of the substrate-binding sites in the ESS complex.",WASP (Write a Scientific Paper): Ethnography with children: Some considerations.,https://www.ncbi.nlm.nih.gov/pubmed/30981599,Early human development,2019 05 19,"This paper introduces the key methodological challenges related to working with children within an ethnographic research design. After briefly identifying in-depth contextually rich data as the key aim of any ethnographic research, some of the particular challenges related to working with children are explored. These are described along two key axes: ethical issues related to power dynamics loaded in favour of the adult researcher, and practical, logistical barriers to generating data that are a true reflection of the young child's ideas and beliefs. 'Process assent' and 'ethical symmetry' are flagged as the key means of optimising ethicality, while the benefits of using the 'least adult role', and creative child centric activities are outlined as ways to generating and collecting trustworthy data.",Retinal single-layer analysis with optical coherence tomography (OCT) in schizophrenia spectrum disorder.,https://www.ncbi.nlm.nih.gov/pubmed/30981598,Schizophrenia research,2019 04 14,"Volume reductions in brain structures of patients with schizophrenia spectrum disorder (SSD) have repeatedly been found in voxel-based morphometry MRI studies.

In 2018 3 patients in the UK were diagnosed with monkeypox, and the frequency and geographic distribution of cases across West and Central Africa have increased in recent years. In Nigeria, most monkeypox patients are aged <40 years and lack cross-protective immunity because they were born after discontinuation of the smallpox eradication campaign.

Achieving strict adherence to drug regimens that limit toxicities and viral resistance is an achievable goal. Success is defined by halting viral transmission and by continuous viral restriction. A step towards improving treatment outcomes is in long-acting antiretrovirals. While early results remain encouraging there remain opportunities for improvement. These rest, in part, on the required large drug dosing volumes, local injection-site reactions, and frequency of injections. Thus, implantable devices and long-acting parenteral prodrugs have emerged which may provide more effective clinical outcomes. The recent successes in transforming native antiretrovirals into lipophilic and hydrophobic prodrugs stabilized into biocompatible surfactants can positively affect both. Formulating antiretroviral prodrugs demonstrates improvements in cell and tissue targeting, in drug-dosing intervals, and in the administered volumes of nanosuspensions. As such, the newer formulations also hold the potential to suppress viral loads beyond more conventional therapies with the ultimate goal of HIV-1 elimination when combined with other modalities."

However, the low selectivity and potential safety issues restrict the clinical applications of JAK2 inhibitors. Here we found that crizotinib showed good inhibitory activity against JAK2 by enzymatic assays (IC50 = 27 nM). Then we carried out structure-based drug design and synthesized a series of compounds with an aminopyridine scaffold. Finally, compound 12k and 12l were identified as the promising inhibitors of JAK2, which exhibited high inhibitory activity (IC50 = 6 nM and 3 nM, respectively) and selectivity for JAK2 over JAK1 and JAK3, and showed potent antiproliferative activities toward HEL human erythroleukemia cells.

Given that IL-13 recruits several members of the Janus Kinase family (JAK1, JAK2, and TYK2) to its receptor complex, JAK inhibition may offer an alternate small molecule approach to disrupting IL-13 signaling. Herein we demonstrate that JAK1 is likely the isoform most important to IL-13 signaling. Structure-based design was then used to improve the JAK1 potency of a series of previously reported JAK2 inhibitors. The ability to impede IL-13 signaling was thereby significantly improved, with the best compounds exhibiting single digit nM IC50's in cell-based assays dependent upon IL-13 signaling. Appropriate substitution was further found to influence inhibition of a key off-target, LRRK2. Finally, the most potent compounds were found to be metabolically labile, which makes them ideal scaffolds for further development as topical agents for IL-13 mediated diseases of the lungs and skin (for example asthma and atopic dermatitis, respectively).",Operator-Directed Procedural Sedation in the Congenital Cardiac Catheterization Laboratory.,https://www.ncbi.nlm.nih.gov/pubmed/30981573,JACC.

It is therefore the optimal treatment for kidney failure for most patients. While transplantation nephrologists typically care for the patient in the first 6 months posttransplantation, general nephrologists and internists often care for kidney transplant recipients after this period. Medical management of the kidney transplant recipient can be challenging, and primary care physicians and nephrologists may be unfamiliar with the medical nuances of caring for these patients. This includes drug interactions, which are common and can result in drug toxicities, rejection, and graft injury. Infections and malignancies related to long-term immunosuppression may pose diagnostic and treatment challenges. In this article, we review the mechanisms of immunosuppression, types of rejection, complications of recurrent disease, common infectious diseases, and the nonrenal complications commonly encountered in the kidney transplant recipient.",Effect of dietary grape marc on fresh and refrigerated boar semen.,https://www.ncbi.nlm.nih.gov/pubmed/30981566,Animal reproduction science,2019 05 15,"In several studies there has been evaluation of the dietary addition of antioxidants to improve the quality of fresh and stored semen in domestic animals. Grape marc (GM), as the residue of vinification, contains large amounts of polyphenols with antioxidant, anti-inflammatory, antimicrobial, and antiaging effects. In this study, two regimens of dietary GM supplementation (2% and 4%) were tested regarding effects on the characteristics and lipid peroxidation of fresh and stored semen. The dietary supplementation of GM improved sperm characteristics in fresh semen, especially at 4% of GM. There were greater values for all kinetic variables and membrane integrity, and lesser values for sperm abnormalities and lipid peroxidation with 2% and 4% GM supplementation. Lipid peroxidation of the pellet was less with both 2% and 4% GM supplementation. During sperm storage, the dietary supplementation of GM improved the quality of sperm, with greater values for kinetic variables and membrane integrity at day 15 of storage. In the present study, supplementation of GM in boar diets improved fresh semen characteristics and reduced the lipid peroxidation of ejaculated spermatozoa, possibly due to the effect of polyphenols present in the GM. Consequently, this likely resulted in improved sperm quality during storage.",Effects of recombinant goose adiponectin on steroid hormone secretion in Huoyan geese ovarian granulosa cells.,https://www.ncbi.nlm.nih.gov/pubmed/30981565,Animal reproduction science,2019 05 15,"Adiponectin is an adipokine associated with the regulation of reproductive processes. To determine whether recombinant goose adiponectin contributes to the goose ovarian steroidogenesis, the native and then purified goose recombinant adiponectin protein was produced using recombinant DNA technologies. The effect of recombinant adiponectin on the progesterone (P4) and estradiol (E2) production in Huoyan geese ovarian granulosa cells was examined. Furthermore, the effect of recombinant adiponectin (2.5 μg/mL) on the abundance of StAR (steroidogenic acute regulatory protein), CYP11A1 (cytochrome P450scc, cholesterol side-chain cleavage enzyme) and CYP19A1 (cytochrome P450 aromatase) mRNA and protein in granulosa cells was evaluated. Results indicate that a 24-h treatment with recombinant adiponectin (2.5 μg/mL) affected P4 and E2 production by geese ovarian granulosa cells by stimulating P4 production (P < 0.01) and weakly inhibiting E2 production (P > 0.05). Furthermore, when the results with treatment were compared to when there was not adiponectin treatment, the abundance of StAR and CYP11A1 mRNA was greater (P < 0.05) while the CYP19A1 mRNA slightly decreased (P > 0.05). In addition, the fluorescence intensity of StAR tended to be greater compared to PBS-treated (P < 0.05) and control groups (P > 0.05) and StAR protein abundance was greater (P < 0.05) compared to the other two groups. The fluorescence intensity and protein abundances of CYP11A1 increased (P < 0.05) while those for CYP19A1 tended to decrease (P > 0.05) after adiponectin treatment. The results indicate recombinant goose adiponectin affects steroidogenesis and/or hormone secretion of geese ovarian granulosa cells. There may, therefore, be important functions of adiponectin in goose reproductive physiology.",Effect of quercetin on ovarian cells of pigs and cattle.,https://www.ncbi.nlm.nih.gov/pubmed/30981564,Animal reproduction science,2019 05 15,"The bioflavonoid quercetin is a component of food with numerous biological effects, but its function in reproductive processes and mechanisms in various species remain unclear. The aim of this study was to examine the effect of quercetin on ovarian cells isolated from ovaries of two phytophagous mammalian species (i.e. pigs and cattle). There was analysis of the effect of quercetin (0, 1, 10, and 100 ng/mL) on cultured granulosa cells of pigs and cattle. Proliferation (PCNA) and apoptosis (bax) markers and release of progesterone (P4), testosterone (T), estradiol (E2), and IGF-I were quantified using quantitative immunocytochemistry, enzyme immunoassay, or radioimmunoassay. Treatments with quercetin reduced PCNA and bax accumulation and decreased P4 release from both granulosa cells of pigs and cattle. In cells of pigs, treatment with quercetin reduced T output, however, in cells of cattle quercetin increased T release. In cells of pigs, quercetin reduced IGF-I release. In cells of cattle, quercetin at smaller doses (1 or 10 ng/mL), promoted and at a large dose (100 ng/mL) reduced IGF-I secretions. There was no substantial E2 release from granulosa cells of pigs or cattle. These observations are the first to indicate there is a direct action of quercetin on basic ovarian cell functions (proliferation, apoptosis, and hormones release) which can be species-specific.",Control of Ebola virus disease outbreaks: Comparison of health care worker-targeted and community vaccination strategies.,https://www.ncbi.nlm.nih.gov/pubmed/30981563,Epidemics,2019 06 03,Health care workers (HCW) are at risk of infection during Ebola virus disease outbreaks and therefore may be targeted for vaccination before or during outbreaks.

Only a few of these studies have focused on HFOs during the development of epilepsy, but results suggest pathological HFOs could be a biomarker of epileptogenesis. The Epilepsy Bioinformatics Study for Antiepileptogenic Therapy"" (EpiBioS4Rx) is a multi-center project designed to identify biomarkers of epileptogenesis after a traumatic brain injury (TBI) and evaluate treatments that could modify or prevent the development of post-traumatic epilepsy. One goal of the EpiBioS4Rx project is to assess whether HFOs could be a biomarker of post-traumatic epileptogenesis. The current study describes the work towards this goal, including the development of common surgical procedures and EEG protocols, an interim analysis of the EEG for HFOs, and identifying issues that need to be addressed for a robust biomarker analysis. At three participating sites - University of Eastern Finland (UEF), Monash University in Melbourne (Melbourne) and University of California, Los Angeles (UCLA) - TBI was induced in adult male Sprague-Dawley rats by lateral fluid-percussion injury. After injury and in sham-operated controls, rats were implanted with screw and microwire electrodes positioned in neocortex and hippocampus to record EEG. A separate group of rats had serial magnetic resonance imaging after injury and then implanted with electrodes at 6 months. Recordings 28 days post-injury were available from UEF and UCLA, but not Melbourne due to technical issues with their EEG files. Analysis of recordings from 4 rats - UEF and UCLA each had one TBI and one sham-operated control - showed EEG contained evidence of HFOs. Computer-automated algorithms detected a total of 1,819 putative HFOs and of these only 40 events (2%) were detected by all three sites. Manual review of all events verified 130 events as HFO and the remainder as false positives. Review of the 40 events detected by all three sites was associated with 88% agreement. This initial report from the EpiBioS4Rx Consortium demonstrates the standardization of EEG electrode placements, recording protocol and long-term EEG monitoring, and differences in detection algorithm HFO results between sites. Additional work on detection strategy, detection algorithm performance, and training in HFO review will be performed to establish a robust, preclinical evaluation of HFOs as a biomarker of post-traumatic epileptogenesis.",[Vemurafenib-induced radiation recall dermatitis].,https://www.ncbi.nlm.nih.gov/pubmed/30981540,Annales de dermatologie et de venereologie,2019 05 31,"Radiation recall dermatitis is an uncommon inflammatory reaction of the skin appearing after several days to several years at the site of previous irradiation; it is precipitated by the use of triggering drugs, although rarely by BRAF or MEK inhibitors.",Maturation of the immune system in the fetus and the implications for congenital CMV.,https://www.ncbi.nlm.nih.gov/pubmed/30981539,Best practice & research. Clinical obstetrics & gynaecology,2019 04 14,"Congenital cytomegalovirus (CMV) infection is the most prevalent and consequential congenital infection, among others, that affects approximately 0.6% of all live births worldwide. Timing of maternal infection and maternal immune status largely determine the likelihood of a symptomatic infection. However, recent studies suggest that the fetal immune system, long perceived as naïve and immature, may also play a role in deciding the outcome of congenital CMV infection. Here, we review the development of four immune cells most pertinent to CMV control in the human fetus. αβT cells, B cells, natural killer (NK) cells, and γδT cells are all present, mature and partially functional in utero, and are capable of mounting some form of response to congenital CMV infection. Whether this response is negligible, effective, or harmful remains an open question. Expanding our knowledge of normal and abnormal immune development could provide clinicians with more accurate tools for the detection, monitoring, and treatment of congenital CMV infection in fetuses.",Torque-Teno virus viral load as a potential endogenous marker of immune function in solid organ transplantation.,https://www.ncbi.nlm.nih.gov/pubmed/30981537,"Transplantation reviews (Orlando, Fla.)",2019 04 14,"Solid organ transplantation (SOT) recipients receive immunosuppressive therapy to avoid rejection of the transplanted organ. Immunosuppressive therapy increases the risk of infections. However, no existing marker reliably reveals the status of the immune function in SOT recipients. Torque-Teno virus or Transfusion-transmitted virus (TTV) has gained attention as a possible endogenous marker of the immune function. TTV is a non-enveloped, circular single strand DNA virus, and it may be considered a part of the human virome. In a bidirectional relationship, the immune system detects TTV and TTV may also modulate the activity of immune system. These characteristics have made the virus a possible candidate indicator of immune function. In this systematic review, we describe the role and potential function of TTV viral load as an endogenous marker of the immune function and consequently the level of immune suppression in SOT recipients.",Challenges for immigrant health in the USA-the road to crisis.,https://www.ncbi.nlm.nih.gov/pubmed/30981536,"Lancet (London, England)",2019 04 14,"The USA is home to more immigrants than any other country-about 46 million, just less than a fifth of the world's immigrants. Immigrant health and access to health care in the USA varies widely by ethnicity, citizenship, and legal status. In recent decades, several policy and regulatory changes have worsened health-care quality and access for immigrant populations. These changes include restrictions on access to public health insurance programmes, rhetoric discouraging the use of social services, aggressive immigration enforcement activities, intimidation within health-care settings, decreased caps on the number of admitted refugees, and rescission of protections from deportation. A receding of ethical norms has created an environment favourable for moral and public health crises, as evident in the separation of children from their parents at the southern US border. Given the polarising immigration rhetoric at the national level, individual states rather than the country as a whole might be better positioned to address the barriers to improved health and health care for immigrants in the USA.",Is there a role for pentoxifylline and tocopherol in the management of advanced osteoradionecrosis of the jaws with pathological fractures? Case reports and review of the literature.,https://www.ncbi.nlm.nih.gov/pubmed/30981534,International journal of oral and maxillofacial surgery,2019 05 20,"Osteoradionecrosis (ORN) is an infrequent but serious complication of radiotherapy, especially in the head and neck region. It is a slowly progressive condition, with management in the early stages focused on symptom control, and surgery usually reserved for advanced ORN. However, established ORN is difficult to treat. The role of hyperbaric oxygen therapy has recently been contested. The use of pentoxifylline in the management of ORN was first described by Delanian in 2004, but its benefits have not been replicated in other studies. In cases of advanced ORN with pathological fractures, many centres still advocate surgical resection and reconstruction. However, in this group of patients who often have multiple medical comorbidities, many of whom have previously undergone significant surgery, a resective plan is not always ideal. This paper presents two successful cases of bony union after the use of pentoxifylline and tocopherol to manage grade III ORN of the mandible. Both patients had pathological fractures and orocutaneous fistulas and were deemed unsuitable for surgery. The possible reasons for the success of pentoxifylline and tocopherol are discussed, and a review of the current literature evidence of similar cases is presented. Pentoxifylline and tocopherol should be considered for the management of advanced ORN where surgical management is not appropriate."

A,2019 06 03,"Stationary phases that can withstand extremes of pH and temperature are needed to allow a single column to accommodate a wider set of solutes and separation criteria. We used a simple multi-step process using the thiol-yne reaction following the modification of the silica surface with a thiol-containing silane. The monomers 1,4-diethynylbenzene (DEB) and 1,6-hexanedithiol were used to create a crosslinked thiol-yne (CTY) stationary phase along the surface of the thiol functionalized silica. In the Tanaka test characterization, the CTY phase showed a low phase ratio, methylene selectivity typical of a reversed phase, and extremely high shape selectivity compared to commercial reversed phases. The hydrophobic subtraction model characterization showed a high positive steric resistance, a low hydrogen bond acidity, and a high cation-exchange capacity compared to most reversed phases. At pH 0.5 with an 85% aqueous mobile phase the phase showed no significant change over 114 h. With a 50% aqueous mobile phase the phase took four more days than a sterically protected C18 phase for the k' to decline 25%. At pH 12.6, 50% aqueous mobile phase, a sterically protected C18 phase showed a 20% decrease in k' and more than a 60% decrease in theoretical plates per meter in three hours. The CTY phase actually showed modest increases in k' and theoretical plates per meter after three hours.",ROS/JNK/c-Jun axis is involved in oridonin-induced caspase-dependent apoptosis in human colorectal cancer cells.,https://www.ncbi.nlm.nih.gov/pubmed/30981511,Biochemical and biophysical research communications,2019 05 06,"Colorectal cancer (CRC) is one of the most common malignant neoplasms with high mortality worldwide. Oridonin, a diterpenoid isolated from the Chinese medicinal herb Rabdosia rubescens, has been proved to have anticancer effect on various types of cancer cells. However, the detailed mechanisms of oridonin in CRC cells remain unclear and if oridonin can overcome 5-FU resistance have not been investigated yet. In this study, we investigated the anticancer effect of oridonin in both 5-FU sensitive and resistant CRC cells and illuminated the underlying mechanisms. We showed that oridonin induced proliferation inhibition and caspase-dependent apoptosis in both 5-FU sensitive and resistant CRC cells. Oridonin induced reactive oxygen species (ROS) accumulation in both 5-FU sensitive and resistant CRC cells, which resulted in cell apoptosis as oridonin-induced apoptosis was almost abolished when cells were co-treated with the ROS scavenger N-acetyl-L-cysteine (NAC). Moreover, we found that oridonin induced CRC cell apoptosis via the c-Jun N-terminal kinase (JNK)/c-Jun pathway as oridonin activated JNK/c-Jun pathway and the JNK inhibitor SP600125 restored oridonin-induced apoptosis in CRC cells. Interestingly, when CRC cells were co-treated with NAC, the activation of JNK/c-Jun pathway induced by oridonin was nearly reversed, indicating that oridonin induced JNK/c-Jun pathway activation through the accumulation of ROS. Taken together, these data reveal that oridonin induces apoptosis through the ROS/JNK/c-Jun axis in both 5-FU sensitive and resistant CRC cells, suggesting that oridonin could be a potential agent for CRC treatment.",Structural basis for efonidipine block of a voltage-gated Ca2+ channel.,https://www.ncbi.nlm.nih.gov/pubmed/30981510,Biochemical and biophysical research communications,2019 05 06,"Efonidipine is a dual L-/T- type calcium channel blocker with a slow onset of action and a long lasting effect that exibihits antihypertensive and nephroprotective effects. differs from most other DHPs which can induce reflex tachycardia. Efonidipine reduces blood pressure without decreasing cardiac output and exerts organ-protective effects on the heart and kidney. In order to investigate how efonidipine block voltage-gated Ca2+ channel, we determined the crystal structure of CaVAb in complex with efonidipine at atomic resolution using x-ray crystallography. Our results reveal that efonidipine targets the central cavity of a model voltage-gated calcium channel underneath its selectivity filter and occlude the channel in an inactivated state. Binding of efonidipine does not break down the fourfold symmetry of the quaternary structure and its pore structure. Our work provides the structural basis for efonidipine block of a voltage-gated Ca2+ channel at the molecular level.",Connexin 43-serine 282 modulates serine 279 phosphorylation in cardiomyocytes.,https://www.ncbi.nlm.nih.gov/pubmed/30981509,Biochemical and biophysical research communications,2019 05 06,"Connexin 43 (Cx43) phosphorylation plays a pivotal role in cardiac electrical and contractile performance. In a previous study we have found that Cx43 phosphorylation at serine 282 (pS282) regulates cardiomyocyte survival. Considering that both sites are altered simultaneously in many studies, we designed this study to identify the status of S279 phosphorylation upon pS282 manipulation. In heterozygous mice with S282 gene substituted with alanine (S282A), we found ventricular arrhythmias with inhibition of Cx43 phosphorylation at both S282 and S279 in the hearts. In cultured neonatal rat ventricular myocytes (NRVMs), transfection of virus carrying S282A mutant also blocked Cx43 phosphorylation at both S279/282 and gap junction coupling, while expression of wild-type Cx43 or S279A did not. Further, NRVMs transfected with S282 phospho-mimicking mutant substituted with aspartate or treated with ATP exhibited promotions of Cx43 phosphorylation at S279/282 and intercellular communication. Therefore, this study demonstrated a regulatory role of Cx43-S282 on S279 phosphorylation in cardiomyocytes, and suggested an involvement of S279 in the Cx43-S282 mediated cardiomyocyte homeostasis.",Construction of an irreversible allergic rhinitis-induced olfactory loss mouse model.,https://www.ncbi.nlm.nih.gov/pubmed/30981508,Biochemical and biophysical research communications,2019 05 06,"Clinical data show that part of patients with sinonasal diseases suffered from olfactory dysfunction, especially with allergic rhinitis (AR) and chronic rhinosinusitis (CRS). However, the mechanisms responsible for AR-induced olfactory loss are still largely unknown. Because of the difficulty to obtain human olfactory mucosa, an AR-induced olfactory loss animal model needs to be constructed to clarify the mechanism. The AR mouse model was induced by intraperitoneal sensitizing with ovalbumin (OVA) followed by intranasal challenge lasted from 1 to 12 weeks. For groups with recovery, mice were housed for another 4-week long without any treatment after the last intranasal challenge. Olfactory function, olfactory receptor neurons (ORNs) density and leukocytes infiltration were examined at different time points. Olfactory loss occurs immediately after 1-week intranasal challenge and deteriorates almost to anosmia after 8th week, and after that olfactory loss become irreversible. Nasal inflammation induces significant infiltration of leukocytes into olfactory epithelium (OE), which negatively correlated with the density of ORNs and mouse olfaction in a time dependent manner. The neutrophilic subtype dominates in number amongst the total infiltrated leukocytes, indicating its pivotal role in nasal inflammation-induced olfactory dysfunction. In this study, we constructed a persistent AR-induced olfactory loss mouse model, losing the ability to recover from dysfunction if the disease duration more than eight weeks, which implies that timely treatments are necessary. Meanwhile, this mouse model could provide an easy and reliable system to clarify the mechanisms of AR-induced irreversible olfactory dysfunction.",Nuclear receptor TLX regulates islet beta cell proliferation via E2F6.,https://www.ncbi.nlm.nih.gov/pubmed/30981507,Biochemical and biophysical research communications,2019 05 06,"Both type 1 and type 2 diabetes are associated with loss of functional beta cell mass, and strategies to restore beta cells are urgently needed. We reported previously that overexpression of the nuclear receptor TLX induces beta cell proliferation, but the underlying molecular mechanism has not been defined. Here, we identified direct targets of TLX in beta cells at the genome-wide level by ChIP-Seq. These targets include a cadre of regulators that are known to be critical for proliferation. Among these ChIP targets, E2F6 was tightly associated with the cell cycle modules, and thus, we further analyzed E2F6 expression and function in beta cells. We showed that E2F6 is strongly downregulated by TLX, and its expression inhibits beta cell proliferation. Moreover, coexpression of E2F6 with TLX partially abrogated the proliferative effects of TLX. These results strongly suggest that TLX acts through E2F6 to regulate beta cell proliferation. Together, the results of this study reveal a direct interaction between TLX and E2F6 and suggest new targets for the expansion of functional beta cell mass.",Metabolomics profiling of haloperidol and validation of thromboxane-related signaling in the early development of zebrafish.,https://www.ncbi.nlm.nih.gov/pubmed/30981506,Biochemical and biophysical research communications,2019 05 06,"Haloperidol is a common butyrophenone-derivative antipsychotic drug that is used clinically to treat schizophrenia and to control Tourette disorder. Haloperidol has been shown to be an embryonic toxicant and to cause a variety of adverse effects that affect human embryonic development. However, the pathway impaired by haloperidol during the developmental stages remains unclear. To elucidate the innate toxicological pathway of haloperidol, we investigated the lethality of haloperidol during the embryonic development of zebrafish. We observed that haloperidol caused serious morphological changes, with an LD50 of 9.7 x 10-6 ± 2.4 x 10-6 μg/L. Next, we established a systematic approach to perform metabolite profiling in embryonic zebrafish with various concentrations of haloperidol and analyzed the metabolites using ultra-performance liquid chromatography quadrupole time-of-flight mass spectrometry (UPLC/Q-TOF MS). A total of 304 metabolites were identified and 86 metabolites were chosen to predict potential pathways. Among the metabolites, we found through prediction that numerous metabolomics-biological pathways are associated with haloperidol, including peroxisome-proliferator-activated receptor (ppar), thromboxane, and mTOR signaling. Quantitative real time-qPCR was then used to validate the gene expression potentially associated with the thromboxane, which is a metabolic product of arachidonic acid and considered to be important for cell proliferation and the inflammatory response. To sum up, analysis of metabolites in the zebrafish model provides a system for mining biomarkers that reflect biological significance and highlight the therapeutic potency in humans. In addition, it may show potential for application to other pharmaceuticals to identify their various activities and clarify functional mechanisms in the future.",Structural and functional characterization of fast-cycling RhoF GTPase.,https://www.ncbi.nlm.nih.gov/pubmed/30981505,Biochemical and biophysical research communications,2019 04 27,"Ras superfamily GTPases are molecular switches that cycle between GDP-bound inactive state and GTP-bound active state to control many signaling pathways. Emerging evidence suggests that several Ras superfamily GTPases, including RhoF, do not follow the classical GDP/GTP exchange cycle; they act as constitutively active GTP-bound proteins due to their fast activities of GDP/GTP exchange (termed as 'fast-cycling' GTPases). To understand the molecular basis of the fast-cycling GTPases, we generated a GTPase active recombinant RhoF and examined its function and structure. Two point mutations in the switch I/II regions (Q77L and P45S, corresponding to Q61L and P29S of Rac1) significantly reduced the GTPase activity of RhoF, suggesting a conserved mechanism of GTP hydrolysis between RhoF and other RAS superfamily GTPases. However, in contrary to the previous evidence, RhoF represented a slow GDP/GTP exchange activity that dissociates GDP very slowly on a day-to-week time scale, in our experiment using fluorescently labeled GDP. The slow GDP dissociation was accelerated by Mg2+ chelation and canonical fast-cycling mutations, F44L (corresponding to F28L of Rac1) and P45S. NMR and dynamic light scattering data revealed a multimeric structure of RhoF that can switch between different conformations depending on the GTP/GDP-bound state. Overall, our study suggests that (1) RhoF shares a conserved mechanism of GTP hydrolysis with other RAS superfamily GTPases, but (2) RhoF adopts a unique multimeric structure. Our study also argues that (3) the emerging concept of the fast-cycling GTPases for RhoF should be validated using an alternative assay that does not rely on fluorescently labeled GDP (251 words).",Rebound pathway overactivation by cancer cells following discontinuation of PI3K or mTOR inhibition promotes cancer cell growth.,https://www.ncbi.nlm.nih.gov/pubmed/30981504,Biochemical and biophysical research communications,2019 05 06,"Whilst effects of anti-cancer drugs have been thoroughly explored, little is known about the repercussion of drug cessation. However, this has important clinical relevance since several clinical protocols such as intermittent drug scheduling lead to frequent drug discontinuation. In this study, we have thus investigated the consequences of withdrawal of agents that target the PI3K/AKT/mTOR signaling pathway in cancer cells. We report that washout of kinase inhibitors of mTOR or PI3K inhibitors led to a rapid and sustainable overactivation of AKT. Consequently, proliferation of tumor cells was significantly higher following drug washout in cancer cells that were pre-treated with mTOR or PI3K inhibitors compared to untreated cells. This effect was prevented by the addition of an AKT inhibitor following drug washout. Rebound AKT overactivation induced by mTOR or PI3K inhibitors discontinuation was mediated by IGF-1R, as demonstrated by its prevention in the presence of an IGF-1R inhibitor and by increased IGF-1R phosphorylation in treated cells versus control cells. Taken together, our results show that discontinuation of PI3K or mTOR inhibitors results in AKT overactivation that promotes tumor growth. They further highlight the benefit of adding an AKT inhibitor following cessation of PI3K or mTOR inhibitors.",SES1 positively regulates heat stress resistance in Arabidopsis.,https://www.ncbi.nlm.nih.gov/pubmed/30981503,Biochemical and biophysical research communications,2019 05 06,"Heat stress significantly disturbs the protein folding and processing capability in plants. Molecular chaperones are vital players in unfolded/misfolded protein assembly and abiotic stress tolerance. Here, we reported SES1, which encodes an endoplasmic reticulum (ER) localized molecular chaperone, is required for Arabidopsis heat tolerance. SES1 is obviously induced by heat treatment and ses1 mutants are hypersensitive to heat stress. The unfolded protein response genes were up-regulated, while cytosolic protein response genes were down-regulated in ses1 after heat stress. Furthermore, ER stress sensor basic leucine zipper 28 (bZIP28) acts as the upstream transcriptional activator of SES1 by binding to its promoter region. These results provide new insights into heat stress responses and ER stress, and shed lights on the mechanism of SES1 in modulating heat resistance."

We recently reported a linear increase in milk fat yield and greater than a 30% net apparent transfer of acetate to milk fat with ruminal infusion of neutralized acetate. Additionally, ruminal acetate infusion linearly increases plasma β-hydroxybutyrate. The objective of the current study was to investigate the ability of acetate and butyrate fed in a diet to increase milk fat synthesis. Twelve multiparous lactating Holstein cows were randomly assigned to treatments in a 3 × 3 Latin square design with 14-d periods that included a 7-d washout followed by 7 d of treatment. Cows were fed ad libitum a basal diet with a low risk for biohydrogenation-induced milk fat depression, and treatments were mixed into the basal diet. Treatments were 3.2% NaHCO3 (control), 2.9% sodium acetate, and 2.5% calcium butyrate (carbon equivalent to acetate treatment) as a percent of diet dry matter. Feeding sodium acetate increased dry matter intake by 2.7 kg, had no effect on milk yield, and increased milk fat yield by 90 g/d and concentration by 0.2 percentage units, compared with control. Calcium butyrate decreased dry matter intake by 2.6 kg/d, milk yield by 1.65 kg/d, and milk fat yield by 60 g/d, compared with control. Sodium acetate increased concentration and yield of 16 carbon mixed source fatty acids (FA) and myristic acid, while decreasing the concentration of preformed FA, compared with control. Calcium butyrate had no effect on concentration of milk FA by source, but increased concentration of trans-10 C18:1 in milk by 18%, indicating a shift in rumen biohydrogenation pathways. Our data demonstrate that milk fat yield and concentration can be increased by feeding sodium acetate at 2.9% of diet dry matter, but not by feeding calcium butyrate at an equivalent carbon mass.",Variance of gametic diversity and its application in selection programs.,https://www.ncbi.nlm.nih.gov/pubmed/30981488,Journal of dairy science,2019 05 18,"The variance of gametic diversity ( σgamete2) can be used to find individuals that more likely produce progeny with extreme breeding values. The aim of this study was to obtain this variance for individuals from routine genomic evaluations, and to apply gametic variance in a selection criterion in conjunction with breeding values to improve genetic progress. An analytical approach was developed to estimate σgamete2 by the sum of binomial variances of all individual quantitative trait loci across the genome. Simulation was used to verify the predictability of this variance in a range of scenarios. The accuracy of prediction ranged from 0.49 to 0.85, depending on the scenario and model used. Compared with sequence data, SNP data are sufficient for estimating σgamete2 Results also suggested that markers with low minor allele frequency and the covariance between markers should be included in the estimation. To incorporate σgamete2 into selective breeding programs, we proposed a new index, relative predicted transmitting ability, which better utilizes the genetic potential of individuals than traditional predicted transmitting ability. Simulation with a small genome showed an additional genetic gain of up to 16% in 10 generations, depending on the number of quantitative trait loci and selection intensity. Finally, we applied σgamete2 to the US genomic evaluations for Holstein and Jersey cattle. As expected, the DGAT1 gene had a strong effect on the estimation of σgamete2 for several production traits. However, inbreeding had a small impact on gametic variability, with greater effect for more polygenic traits. In conclusion, gametic variance, a potentially important parameter for selection programs, can be easily computed and is useful for improving genetic progress and controlling genetic diversity.",Contagious agalactia monitoring in caprine herds through regular bulk tank milk sampling.,https://www.ncbi.nlm.nih.gov/pubmed/30981487,Journal of dairy science,2019 05 18,"Surveillance and control of Mycoplasma spp. responsible for contagious agalactia (CA) in caprine herds are important challenges in countries with a large small-ruminant dairy industry. In the absence of any clinical signs, being able to determine the potential circulation of mycoplasmas within a herd could help to prevent biosecurity issues during animal exchanges between farms and improve health management practices. The objective of this study was to determine whether regular sampling of bulk tank milk was suitable for such surveillance. Twenty farms were sampled once a month for 2 yr and CA-responsible mycoplasmas were detected by real-time PCR on DNA extracted from milk, using 3 different DNA extraction methods. The pattern of mycoplasma excretion in bulk tank milk was assessed over time and several herd characteristics were recorded together with any event occurring within the herds. In general, the results obtained with the different detection methods were comparable and mainly agreed with the culture results. Several patterns of excretion were observed but were not related to herd characteristics (size, breed, and so on). Recurrence of the same (sub)species and same pulsed-field gel electrophoresis subtype during the 2-yr period is indicative of the considerable persistence of mycoplasmas. This persistence was associated with intermittent excretion. In conclusion, bulk tank milk sampling could be valuable for controlling CA in caprine herds provided it is repeated several times, yet to be defined, per year and analyzed using an appropriate methodology and the right cut-off for interpretation.",Molecular hydrogen produced by elemental magnesium inhibits rumen fermentation and enhances methanogenesis in dairy cows.,https://www.ncbi.nlm.nih.gov/pubmed/30981486,Journal of dairy science,2019 05 18,"Hydrogen is a key metabolite that connects microbial fermentation and methanogenesis in the rumen. This study was to investigate the effects of elevated H2 produced by elemental Mg on rumen fermentation and methanogenesis in dairy cows. Four nonlactating Chinese Holstein dairy cows were employed for this experiment in a replicated crossover design. The 2 dietary treatments included a basal diet supplemented with Mg(OH)2 (14.5 g/kg of feed dry matter) or elemental Mg (6.00 g/kg of feed dry matter). When compared with Mg(OH)2 treatment, cows fed diet with elemental Mg had similar rumen Mg2+ concentration, but higher rumen dissolved H2 and methane concentrations at 2.5 h after morning feeding. Also, elemental Mg supplementation decreased feed digestibility, rumen volatile fatty acid concentration, and relative abundance of group Ruminococcaceae_UCG-014, genus Bifidobacterium, and group Mollicutes_RF9, increased acetate to propionate ratio, succinate concentration, and abundance of family Christensenellaceae. Elemental Mg supplementation increased enteric CH4 emission, altered methanogen community with increased abundance of order Methanomassiliicoccales, 16S ribosomal RNA gene copies of methanogens, and order Methanobacteriales. In summary, the pulse of elevated dissolved H2 after feeding produced by elemental Mg inhibited rumen fermentation and feed digestibility by decreasing the abundance of carbohydrate-degrading bacteria, promoted H2 incorporation into succinate by increasing family Christensenellaceae and genus Bacteroidales_BS11, and increased H2 utilization for methanogenesis by favoring growth of methanogens.",Assessment of rumen bacteria in dairy cows with varied milk protein yield.,https://www.ncbi.nlm.nih.gov/pubmed/30981485,Journal of dairy science,2019 05 18,"The present study was conducted to assess rumen bacteria in lactating cows with different milk protein yield, aiming to understand the role of rumen bacteria in this trait. Cows with high milk protein yield (high milk yield and high milk protein content, HH; n = 20) and low milk protein yield (low milk yield and low milk protein content, LL; n = 20) were selected from 374 mid-lactation Holstein dairy cows fed a high-grain diet. Measurement of the rumen fermentation products showed that the concentrations of ruminal total volatile fatty acids, propionate, butyrate, and valerate and the proportion of isobutyrate were higher in the HH cows than in the LL cows. Amplicon sequencing analysis of the rumen bacterial community revealed that the richness (Chao 1 index) of rumen microbiota was higher in the LL cows than in the HH cows. Among the 10 predominant bacterial phyla (relative abundance being >0.10%, present in >60% of animals within each group), the relative abundance of Proteobacteria was 1.36-fold higher in the HH cows than in the LL cows. At the genus level, the relative abundance of Succinivibrio was significantly higher and that of Clostridium tended to be higher in the LL cows than in the HH cows. Sharpea was 2.28-fold enriched in the HH cows compared with the LL cows. Different relationships between the relative abundances of rumen microbial taxa and volatile fatty acid concentrations were observed in the HH and the LL animals, respectively. Succinivibrio and Prevotella were positively correlated with acetate, propionate, and valerate in the LL cows, whereas Sharpea was positively correlated with propionate and valerate concentrations in the HH cows. Collectively, our results revealed that rumen bacterial richness and the relative abundances of several bacterial taxa significantly differed between dairy cows with high and low milk protein yields, suggesting the potential roles of rumen microbiota contributing to milk protein yield in dairy cows.",Diet starch concentration and starch fermentability affect energy intake and energy balance of cows in the early postpartum period.,https://www.ncbi.nlm.nih.gov/pubmed/30981484,Journal of dairy science,2019 05 18,"Our objective was to evaluate the effects of diet starch concentration and fermentability on energy intake and energy balance during the early postpartum (PP) period. Fifty-two multiparous Holstein cows were used in a randomized block design experiment with a 2 × 2 factorial arrangement of treatments. Treatment rations were formulated to 22% or 28% starch concentration (LS and HS, respectively) with dry ground corn (DGC) or high moisture corn (HMC) as the primary starch source. Rations were formulated for 22% forage neutral detergent fiber (NDF) and 17% crude protein and fed from 1 to 23 d PP. Starch concentration was adjusted by altering concentrations of corn grain and soyhulls. Dry matter intake and milk yield were measured daily, and milk components, milk composition, body condition score (BCS), body weight (BW), and back fat thickness (BFT) were measured weekly. Feeds and refusals as well as fecal samples were collected, and digestibility was determined weekly. High moisture corn (HMC) decreased dry matter and net energy (NEL) intakes compared with DGC more when included in an HS diet (3.9 kg/d and 3.2 Mcal/d) than in an LS diet (0.9 kg/d and 0.6 Mcal/d). The HMC treatment decreased NDF digestibility 3.7 percentage units compared with DGC when included in the HS diet but had little effect when included in an LS diet. Compared with DGC, HMC increased weekly BW and BFT loss when included in an HS diet (-34.7 vs. -8.4 kg/wk and -0.12 vs. -0.10 cm/wk) and decreased weekly BW loss but increased weekly BFT loss when included in an LS diet (-18.9 vs. -21.4 kg/wk and -0.11 vs. -0.02 cm/wk). Weekly BCS loss increased for HMC compared with DGC (-0.33 vs. -0.23 unit/wk). High moisture corn also decreased milk NEL output compared with DGC (28.2 vs. 31 Mcal/d), but had little effect on energy balance, which was improved by HS compared with LS (-14.7 vs. -16.8 Mcal/d). Over time, concentrations of milk de novo fatty acids (<16 carbons) increased and concentration of milk preformed fatty acids (>16 carbons) decreased for all treatments, but yields of both sources as well as yield of mixed fatty acids (C16:0 plus C16:1 cis-9 and iso-C16:0) decreased over time with increased SF. Feeding HMC decreased energy intake and milk energy output, but it had little effect on energy balance during the early PP period.",Changes in fermentation and animal performance during recovery from classical diet-induced milk fat depression using corn with differing rates of starch degradability.,https://www.ncbi.nlm.nih.gov/pubmed/30981483,Journal of dairy science,2019 05 18,"Diet-induced milk fat depression (MFD) is a multifactorial disorder that can be triggered by a variety of conditions. Feeding high amounts of starch and unsaturated fatty acids has been shown to reduce milk fat yield and composition, as well as alter ruminal biohydrogenation patterns. However, little is known about how starch degradability in the rumen influences recovery from diet-induced MFD and if production of milk fat-inhibiting isomers will persist following an episode of MFD. The objective of this study was to evaluate production performance and ruminal fermentation in cows recovering from MFD when corn with a low or high starch degradability is fed. Six ruminally fistulated Holstein cows were used in a crossover design with 2 periods. During each period, MFD was induced for 10 d by feeding a diet with low fiber, high starch, and high unsaturated fatty acid. The polyunsaturated fatty acid concentration of the diet during the induction phase was modified primarily through inclusion of soybean oil. Following induction, cows were switched to either a high degradable starch recovery diet (HDS) or a low degradable starch recovery diet (LDS) for 18 d. The 7-h starch degradability was 66.5% for LDS and 87.8% for HDS. Milk was collected every 3 d for component and fatty acid analysis. On d 0, 4, 7, 10, 16, 22, and 28 of each period, ruminal pH and rumen fluid were collected every 2 h. Milk fat yield and composition was reduced during MFD induction and progressively increased by day in both HDS and LDS during recovery. Dry matter intake was similar among treatments and increased steadily over time during recovery. Preformed fatty acids were greater for HDS-fed animals, and de novo fatty acid in milk fat was greater for LDS-fed animals. Milk trans-10 C18:1 tended to be greater for HDS, and trans-10,cis-12 conjugated linoleic acid was significantly greater for HDS. cis-9,trans-11 conjugated linoleic acid was not affected by starch degradability during recovery. Total volatile fatty acids, butyrate, and valerate tended to differ or differed with recovery treatment, but ruminal pH and ammonia concentration were unaffected. The HDS diet responded similarly to the LDS diet during recovery with regard to milk fat percentage, but milk and fat yield tended to consistently be lower in HDS. When considering approaches to ameliorate diet-induced MFD, the degradability of the starch within rations should be evaluated. Although animal performance was similar, some trans fatty acid isomers were persistent in the milk through the recovery phase with HDS-fed animals, suggesting that milk fat synthesis might be potentially inhibited and biohydrogenation pathways modified in the rumen following an episode of MFD.","The effect of concentrate supplementation type on milk production, dry matter intake, rumen fermentation, and nitrogen excretion in late-lactation, spring-calving grazing dairy cows.",https://www.ncbi.nlm.nih.gov/pubmed/30981482,Journal of dairy science,2019 05 18,"In Ireland, milk is primarily produced using a spring-calving grass-based system, with the use of concentrate supplementation mainly when pasture availability and quality are reduced. In the autumn, when cows are in late lactation, reduced pasture productivity results in reduced milk yield and altered milk composition. Nitrogen utilization efficiency also reduces as lactation progresses. Concentrate supplementation has been found to increase milk production and reduce nitrogen (N) excretion, as high-N grass is usually replaced by a lower-N supplement; however, there is a paucity of information with regard to the optimum type of supplementation in late lactation. Therefore, the objective of this research is to investigate the effect of different concentrate supplementation types, based on barley or maize, on milk production, dry matter intake (DMI), rumen fermentation, and N excretion in late-lactation, spring-calving, grazing dairy cows. Thirty-six Holstein Friesian dairy cows were blocked on days in milk (185 DIM) and balanced for parity, pre-experimental milk yield, milk composition, and body condition score. Cows were randomly assigned to 1 of 3 dietary treatments in a randomized complete block design (n = 12). The 3 treatments consisted of a perennial ryegrass-based pasture-only (PO) treatment and pasture plus either of 2 supplementary concentrates, based on barley (PB) or maize (PM). The diets were fed for a 14-d acclimatization period and then for a further 63-d experimental period. Cows offered PO had a lower daily milk yield (15.1 kg) than PB (18.2 kg) or PM (16.8 kg). Similarly, PO had lower daily milk solids yield (1.46 kg) than PB or PM (1.68 and 1.53 kg, respectively). Cows offered PB had a greater milk yield and higher fat and protein yields than those offered PM. Offering PB increased total DMI (19.5 kg) compared with PO (17.7 kg), and milk response to concentrates was also greater for PB compared with PM (1.21 vs. 0.71 kg of milk per kg of concentrate). Cows offered PB had increased N in milk compared with PO. In conclusion, concentrate supplementation based on barley or maize resulted in increased milk and milk solids yield compared with offering PO. Cows offered barley had a greater response to concentrates and increased milk and milk solids yield in comparison to maize and showed increased N partitioning in milk compared with PO. A barley-based concentrate increased total DMI compared with PO.",The inhibitory effect of nisin on Mycobacterium avium ssp. paratuberculosis and its effect on mycobacterial cell wall.,https://www.ncbi.nlm.nih.gov/pubmed/30981481,Journal of dairy science,2019 05 18,"Infection with Mycobacterium avium ssp. paratuberculosis (M. paratuberculosis) is a widespread problem in the United States and worldwide, and it constitutes a significant health problem for dairy animals with a potential effect on human health. Mycobacterium paratuberculosis is easily transmitted through consumption of contaminated milk; therefore, finding safe methods to reduce the mycobacterial load in milk and other dairy products is important to the dairy industry. The main objective of the current study was to investigate the effect of natural products, such as bacteriocins designated as ""generally regarded as safe"" (GRAS), on the survival of M. paratuberculosis in milk. Commercially synthesized bacteriocin (nisin) was used to examine its effect on the survival of laboratory and field isolates of M. paratuberculosis and in contaminated milk. Surprisingly, nisin had a higher minimum inhibitory concentration (MIC) against the laboratory strain (M. paratuberculosis K10), at 500 U/mL, than against field isolates (e.g., M. paratuberculosis 4B and JTC 1281), at 15 U/mL. In milk, growth of M. paratuberculosis was inhibited after treatment with levels of nisin that are permissible in human food at 4°C and 37°C. Using both fluorescent and scanning electron microscopy, we were able to identify defects in the bacterial cell walls of treated cultures. Our analysis indicated that nisin reduced membrane integrity by forming pores in the mycobacterial cell wall, thereby decreasing survival of M. paratuberculosis. Thus, nisin treatment of milk could be implemented as a control measure to reduce M. paratuberculosis secreted in milk from infected herds. Nisin could also be used to reduce M. paratuberculosis in colostrum given to calves from infected animals, improving biosecurity control in dairy herds affected by Johne's disease.","Short communication: Effects of drying and analytical methods on nitrogen concentrations of feeds, feces, milk, and urine of dairy cows.",https://www.ncbi.nlm.nih.gov/pubmed/30981480,Journal of dairy science,2019 05 18,"Nitrogen concentrations in feeds, feces, milk, and urine samples were measured using 2 analytical methods following different drying procedures. Ten samples of corn silage, alfalfa silage, and concentrates collected from 2017 to 2018 at Krauss Dairy Research Center, The Ohio State University (Wooster), were used. A 4-d total collection digestion trial provided fecal samples from 10 cows (1 sample/cow), and another 10 cows were used to collect milk samples (1 sample/cow) and spot urine samples (1 sample/cow). Spot urine samples were acidified immediately to pH <3.0 when collected. Feed samples were oven dried (55°C) or lyophilized and analyzed using the Kjeldahl (KJ; copper sulfate as a catalyst) method and a combustion method (elemental analyzer; EA). Feces, urine, and milk samples were analyzed for N using the following methods: (1) fresh samples by KJ (referred to as wet KJ), (2) lyophilization (urine and milk for 8 h; feces for 120 h) followed by EA (LYO-EA), and (3) oven drying (milk and urine for 1 h; feces for 72 h at 55°C) followed by EA (OD-EA). Additionally, changes in N content of acidified urine at -20° over 180 d of storage were examined. Nitrogen concentrations in corn silage, alfalfa silage, and concentrates were greater for EA by 6.1, 4.8, and 8.3%, respectively, compared with KJ. Analysis of dried samples via EA compared with wet KJ resulted in lower fecal N content (27.8 vs. 29.3 g/kg of DM). Nitrogen concentration in fecal samples via KJ after lyophilization was lower by 5% compared with wet KJ but did not differ from LYO-EA, suggesting that N losses occurred during drying. Nitrogen determination with EA after drying of samples resulted in greater milk N (5.70 vs. 5.50 g/kg) and urinary N (9.16 vs. 9.06 g/kg) content compared with wet KJ. However, drying method (i.e., lyophilization vs. oven drying) did not affect N content of milk, urine, or feces. The use of EA resulted in lower percentage deviation of N content from duplicate sample assays for most samples (no difference was found for concentrate and fecal N), suggesting that EA was more precise than KJ. In conclusion, drying of feces caused N losses regardless of drying methods. For urine and milk samples, if drying is necessary (i.e., EA), oven drying at 55°C can be used rather than lyophilization. The N content was greater in feeds, milk, and urine when determined with EA versus KJ. In addition, N content in acidified and undiluted urine at -20° changed and should be analyzed within 90 d of storage. The results in the current study, however, did not account for laboratory-to-laboratory variation."

The prognosis of these tumors has not drastically changed over the past 30 years, with an overall survival of less than two years in advanced or metastatic situations. Even though immune checkpoints inhibitors have changed this picture, it is beneficial for less than 30% of patients and there is no reliable biomarkers to identify this specific population of responders. Vinflunine is a vinca-alkaloid that was specifically developed as second line treatment post-platinum. As of today, it is the sole anticancer agent for which clinical trials have been pushed to phase III and that was approved for patients in good conditions. Unfortunately, it has been withdrawn from the list of reimbursed drugs, which impairs its prescription. Based on the results of phase III clinical trials with immunotherapies, this review provides the reader with argumentations in favor of patients' and clinicians' request to reimburse vinflunine for the treatment of advanced or metastatic urothelial carcinoma of the bladder.",[Immunotherapy-induced endocrinopathies: Insights from the 2018 French Endocrine Society Guidelines].,https://www.ncbi.nlm.nih.gov/pubmed/30981462,Bulletin du cancer,2019 06 06,"The management of cancer patients has changed due to the considerably more frequent use of immune checkpoint inhibitors (ICPI). However, the use of ICPI has a risk of side-effects, particularly endocrine toxicity. Since the indications for ICPI are constantly expanding due to their efficacy, it is important that endocrinologists and oncologists know how to look for this type of toxicity and how to treat it when it arises. In view of this, the French Endocrine Society initiated the formulation of a guidance document on ICPI-related endocrine toxicity. In this paper, we summarize the main insights of experts' opinions, from an oncologist viewpoint: initial screening, monitoring, emergency situations for which immediate management by the oncologist is crucial, as well as the roles of the interactions between oncologists and endocrinologists. These points will be detailed for each endocrinopathy, i.e., dysthyroidism, hypophysitis, fulminant diabetes and primary adrenal insufficiency. In each chapter, expert opinion will be given on the diagnosis, management and monitoring for each complication.

In total, 8,954 high quality lncRNAs, including 5,516 lncRNAs reported in the previous studies and 3,438 novel lncRNAs, were annotated. The highest expressed lncRNAs were MALAT1, SCARNA10, RP11-206M11.7 and NEAT1, and the highest expressing mRNAs were RPL19, SCGB2A2, FTL and TMSB4 × . Of the 615 differentially expressed lncRNAs, 323 showed up regulated (P < 0.05) expression patterns in breast cancer, and 292 showed down regulated expression patterns. Of the 8,954 genes, 5,516 genes were upregulated in breast cancer, and 3,438 were downregulated. In total, the targets of 238 lncRNAs were confirmed by two lncRNA target prediction programs. Within these genes, Ras responsive element binding protein 1, Ras association domain family member 6, Ras association domain family member 8, Ras protein specific guanine nucleotide releasing factor 1and other 10 different Ras associated different expressed genes were predicted as targets of lncRNAs. These different expressed lncRNAs which could regulate the Ras gene families and ECM pathway may be another mechanism why the expression pattern of Ras genes changed in breast cancer.

Photos are also taken prior to biopsies to ensure the correct site is biopsied and used for monitoring for post-excisional changes. In surgery, photography is used to capture pre- and post-operative changes. Photography is also used to document trauma and physical abuse, which may be used as legal evidence.

While locomotor training often improves walking speed, its influence on dynamic balance is unclear. The goal of this study was to assess the influence of a locomotor training program on dynamic balance in individuals post-stroke during steady-state walking and determine if improvements in walking speed are associated with improved balance control. Kinematic and kinetic data were collected pre- and post-training from seventeen participants who completed a 12-week locomotor training program. Dynamic balance was quantified biomechanically (peak-to-peak range of frontal plane whole-body angular-momentum) and clinically (Berg-Balance-Scale and Dynamic-Gait-Index). To understand the underlying biomechanical mechanisms associated with changes in angular-momentum, foot placement and ground-reaction-forces were quantified. As a group, biomechanical assessments of dynamic balance did not reveal any improvements after locomotor training. However, improved dynamic balance post-training, observed in a sub-group of 10 participants (i.e., Responders), was associated with a narrowed paretic foot placement and higher paretic leg vertical ground-reaction-force impulse during late stance. Dynamic balance was not improved post-training in the remaining seven participants (i.e., Non-responders), who did not alter their foot placement and had an increased reliance on their nonparetic leg during weight-bearing. As a group, increased walking speed was not correlated with improved dynamic balance. However, a higher pre-training walking speed was associated with higher gains in dynamic balance post-training. These findings highlight the importance of the paretic leg weight bearing and mediolateral foot placement in improving frontal plane dynamic balance post-stroke.",Measuring clinically relevant knee motion with a self-calibrated wearable sensor.,https://www.ncbi.nlm.nih.gov/pubmed/30981425,Journal of biomechanics,2019 06 10,"Low-cost sensors provide a unique opportunity to continuously monitor patient progress during rehabilitation; however, these sensors have yet to demonstrate the fidelity and lack the calibration paradigms necessary to be viable tools for clinical research. The purpose of this study was to validate a low-cost wearable sensor that accurately measured peak knee extension during clinical exercises and needed no additional equipment for calibration. Sagittal plane knee motion was quantified using a 9-axis motion sensor and directly compared to motion capture data. The motion sensor measured the field strength of a strong earth magnet secured to the distal femur, which was correlated with knee angle during a simple calibration process. Peak knee motions and kinematic patterns were compared with motion capture data using paired t-tests and cross correlation, respectively. Peak extension values during seated knee extensions were accurate within 5 degrees across all subjects (root mean square error: 2.6 degrees, P = 0.29). Knee flexion during gait strongly correlated (0.84 ≤ rxy ≤ 0.99) with motion capture measurements but demonstrated peak flexion errors of 10 degrees. In this study, we present a low-cost sensor (≈$ 35 US) that accurately determines knee extension angle following a calibration procedure that did not require any other equipment.

The results indicate that in 2015, ingestion of arsenic, methylmercury, lead, and cadmium resulted in more than 1 million illnesses, over 56,000 deaths, and more than 9 million disability-adjusted life years (DALYs) worldwide. The greatest impact on DALYs was in the Western Pacific B subregion. All of the metals were found to have high DALYs per case in comparison with other foodborne disease agents, including infectious and parasitic agents. In addition, lead, arsenic, and methylmercury were found to have high DALYs per 100,000 population in comparison to other foodborne disease agents.","WITHDRAWN: Percutaneous arteriovenous fistulae: Technique, feasibility and results.",https://www.ncbi.nlm.nih.gov/pubmed/30981403,Nephrologie & therapeutique,2019 05 15,"The publisher regrets that this article has been temporarily removed.

Herein, we aimed to evaluate the effects of AGW on patients'marital satisfaction and sexual function. This cross-sectional study was consisted of 74 consecutive patients including 37 patients with AGW and 37 healthy controls. ENRICH Marital Satisfaction Scale and Arizona Sexual Experience Scale were completed and analyzed for all patients. ENRICH scale items were not significantly different between the two groups. Sexual function was found to be lower in female than male patients (P<.001). According to our findings marital satisfaction was not affected by AGW. However, a history of previous treatment for HPV decreased the marital satisfaction. In addition, AGW had more adverse effects on females' sexual function compared to males. Our findings suggest that the psychiatric treatments should be considered when managing an AGW patient.",How much space do drivers provide when passing cyclists?

Herein, an acidic polysaccharide from Suaeda salsa, denoted as SSP2-2, with a molecular weight of 53.8 kDa was isolated, which composed of mannose, rhamnose, glucuronic acid, galacturonic acid, galactose and xylose in a molar ratio of 0.6: 8.0: 1.0: 83.6: 5.0: 7.2. An MTT assay showed that SSP2-2 induced apoptosis of MCF-7 cells in a dose-dependent manner in vitro. Morphological analysis and flow cytometry experiments indicated that SSP2-2 promotes MCF-7 cells death via apoptosis, while JC-1 staining results revealed that mitochondrial membrane potential was reduced in a dose-dependent manner. The data from the western blot showed an increase in the levels of Bax, cytochrome C (Cyto-c), caspase-3 and caspase-9 and a decrease in the level of Bcl-2 further demonstrated that SSP2-2 could induce apoptosis via a mitochondrial pathway. These results suggest that SSP2-2 can potentially be used as an antitumor agent.",Novel process for the coproduction of xylo-oligosaccharide and glucose from reed scraps of reed pulp mill.,https://www.ncbi.nlm.nih.gov/pubmed/30981374,Carbohydrate polymers,2019 04 17,"Current utilization of reed scraps (RS) from reed pulping mills is just burning and burying, remaining the unused RS a major industry waste. The aim of this study was to valorize RS by utilizing it as feedstock for xylo-oligosaccharide (XOS) production. The RS was subjected to dilute acid, alkaline, and liquid hot water (LHW) pretreatments to get the pretreated RS, which was then subjected to xylanase and subsequently cellulase enzymatic to produce XOS and glucose as well. The highest yield of XOS and glucose were 0.144 g and 0.304 g / g of RS, respectively, which were obtained from the LHW pretreatment under the optimized conditions of 170 °C, 1:8 solid loadings and 30 min duration. Overall, by upgrading RS waste into XOS and glucose as value-added products of reed pulp production, we thereby paved a new way in this research to valorize the waste from reed pulping mills.",Redox-sensitive micelles based on retinoic acid modified chitosan conjugate for intracellular drug delivery and smart drug release in cancer therapy.,https://www.ncbi.nlm.nih.gov/pubmed/30981373,Carbohydrate polymers,2019 04 14,"Novel chitosan-cystamine-retinoic acid conjugate (CS-SS-RA) was synthesized and could self-assemble into redox-sensitive micelles in aqueous environment with low critical micelle concentration value. CS-SS-RA micelles were characterized with spherical shape, desirable particle size, negative zeta potential, high paclitaxel (PTX) loading and encapsulation efficiency and redox-sensitivity. Hemolysis and cytotoxicity studies proved the safety of CS-SS-RA micelles for intravenous administration. Cytotoxicity study against HepG2 cells and the growth inhibition study on three-dimensional multicellular tumor spheroids (MCTSs) revealed that PTX-loaded CS-SS-RA micelles exhibited higher antitumor activity than free PTX. The in vitro cellular uptake profiles of FITC-labeled CS-SS-RA micelles evaluated via confocal laser scanning microscopy and flow cytometry indicated that CS-SS-RA micelles could enhance cellular uptake efficiency of PTX, and their internalization by HepG2 cells were mediated by clathrin-mediated endocytosis and macropinocytosis.

The coatings were impregnated with a non-toxic compound, indigo carmine (IC). The novel, eco-friendly, IC-loaded chitosan coatings were characterized morpho-structurally, and their corrosion protection behavior was investigated using potentiodynamic polarization and electrochemical impedance spectroscopy techniques. The surface properties of the coated samples were evaluated by wettability measurements. The thickness of the native chitosan layers and the stability of the impregnated layers in terms of dye release on glass substrates were studied by UV-vis spectrophotometry. The good corrosion inhibiting efficiency of the coatings (>90%) was attributed to the ionic crosslinking of the positively charged Chit with negatively charged IC. The Chit-IC coatings can be successfully used as model systems for chitosan-based coatings incorporating ionic inhibitors and in less demanding applications, such as temporary protective coatings for metals, removable on demand by scrubbing with mild acidic solutions.",Hydrogen-bonded thin films of cellulose ethers and poly(acrylic acid).,https://www.ncbi.nlm.nih.gov/pubmed/30981370,Carbohydrate polymers,2019 04 17,"Etherification of cellulose can get a series of water soluble derivatives, which can form hydrogen-bonded polymer complex with poly(acrylic acid) (PAA). Three cellulose ethers hydroxyethyl cellulose (HEC), hydroxypropyl cellulose (HPC) and methyl cellulose (MC) are LbL assembled with PAA to fabricate thin films. The hydrogen bonding of the films is characterized with FT-IR. The film growth behaviors are monitored by a quartz crystal microbalance (QCM) and a spectroscopic interferometer, which shows a different growth rate for different system and a strong dependence on pH values. The stability of the films can be increased by heat treatment. Once the cross-linked structure is formed, and the dissolution of film can be prevented even in the high pH value. In addition, the films show good water adsorption ability from environment. Owing to pH responsive behavior and good water adsorption, CE/PAA films can be explored for various applications, especially for biomedical application.",Effect of dietary fibers on the structure and digestibility of fried potato starch: A comparison of pullulan and pectin.,https://www.ncbi.nlm.nih.gov/pubmed/30981369,Carbohydrate polymers,2019 04 14,"The granular morphology, long-range and short-range ordered structures of fried potato starch were measured in the absence and presence of the dietary fibers. The in vitro digestibility of the fried starchy samples was also quantified using the Englyst method with logarithm-of-slope (LOS) analysis. After frying, the starch granules disintegrated, their internal crystalline structure disappeared, and the quantity of double helices present decreased. As a result of these changes, the fried starch was digested rapidly. Addition of pullulan or pectin to the samples prior to frying, reduced the structural changes observed in the starch granules during frying. Consequently, the fractions of slowly digestible and resistant starch (SDS and RS) increased significantly in the presence of the dietary fibers. These effects were attributed to the ability of the dietary fibers to sequester some of the water, thereby reducing starch granule structural changes, as well as due to their ability to coat the starch granules and interfere with the starch digestion process."

Because these hydrolysis products also yield valuable information on the dextran fine structures, several branched isomalto-oligosaccharides were liberated from different dextrans and chromatographically purified. Mass spectrometry and two-dimensional NMR spectroscopy were used for structural characterization of the oligomers. Isomalto-oligosaccharides from L. reuteri TMW 1.106 dextrans were exclusively O4-branched. Furthermore, they contained only monomeric side chains and at least one unsubstituted backbone unit between ramified residues. In contrast, O3-branched oligosaccharides with monomeric as well as elongated side chains were isolated. The varying abundance of the O3-branched oligosaccharides suggests that side chain length is a major factor for structural differences between dextrans. Overall, we demonstrated that chromatographic analysis of endo-dextranase liberated isomalto-oligosaccharides provides valuable information on the structural properties and supplements conventional methods such as methylation analysis.","Linum usitatissimum L. seeds: Flax gum extraction, physicochemical and functional characterization.",https://www.ncbi.nlm.nih.gov/pubmed/30981357,Carbohydrate polymers,2019 04 17,"Flax gum (FG) was extracted and purified from flaxseed (Linum usitatissimum L.) locally called as Alsi.

Fourier Transform Infrared Spectroscopy analysis depicted variety of peaks in region of 3308.8, 2923.60, 1739.97 & 1149.68 cm-1 which are feature of typical polysaccharide. Functional properties of FG depicted higher water holding ability and lower oil holding aptitude compared to reference materials. Foaming capacity, swelling index and foaming stability of FG were 27.5%, 55.0% and 10.5% respectively which were higher than reference gums. Highest emulsion stability was evident at 0.5% concentration >95.Monosaccharide composition depicted the acidic and neural behavior of heteopolysaccharide FG. Thermal analysis revealed that FG was highly stable. XRD analysis depicted amorphous behavior. SEM imaging indicated a splendor and shiny surface of FG.

However, there is still a challenge to control the mechanical properties of CNFs-reinforced hydrogels by changing the environmental variables. Here, we demonstrated a thermo- and multi-pH-responsive CNFs-reinforced hydrogel containing lignin nanoparticles as the functional dynamic cross-linkers in the polymeric network. The elastic and viscous modulus of the hydrogel can be tailored: (i) the modulus increases upon increasing pH from 4 to 7, (ii) with pH further increasing from 7 to 9, the modulus decreases. The as prepared hydrogel also responded to the environment temperature, with the gelation at 26.4 °C. The significant differences in CNFs-reinforced hydrogel mechanics at various environment conditions are a direct result of the distinct stress-relaxation dynamics dictated by the dynamic hydrogen bonding and swelling/shrinking of lignin nanoparticles. This work also provides a new approach to design stimuli-responsive hydrogels.",Performance of nanocellulose-producing bacterial strains in static and agitated cultures with different starting pH.,https://www.ncbi.nlm.nih.gov/pubmed/30981355,Carbohydrate polymers,2019 04 14,"The impact of strain selection and culture conditions on bacterial nanocellulose (BNC) productivity and quality was investigated by using four strains, static and agitated cultures, and an initial pH in the range 4-6. With agitation, strain DHU-ATCC-1 displayed highest productivity [1.14 g/(L × d)]. In static cultures, DHU-ZGD-1186 exhibited superior BNC yield on consumed glucose (0.79 g/g), and lowest by-product formation with respect to gluconic acids [≤0.07 g/(L × d)]. By-product formation typically decreased in the order gluconic acid >2-keto-gluconic acid >5-keto-gluconic acid, and was lowest in cultures with high initial pH. The BNC from DHU-ZGD-1186 exhibited higher average viscometric degree of polymerization (DPv), higher crystallinity index, and higher tear index. In conclusion, both strain selection and cultivation conditions had an impact on BNC productivity and properties. Productivity, DPv, crystallinity, and mechanical strength of BNC from agitated cultures could be similar to or even higher than the corresponding values for static cultures.",Polysaccharide-based adsorbents prepared in ionic liquid with high performance for removing Pb(II) from aqueous systems.,https://www.ncbi.nlm.nih.gov/pubmed/30981354,Carbohydrate polymers,2019 04 17,"Alginate/chitosan (ALG/CHT) and alginate/N,N-dimethyl chitosan (ALG/DMC) polyelectrolyte complex (PEC)-based adsorbents with high capacities for removing Pb(II) from aqueous systems are produced in [1-hydrogen-3-methylimidazolium hydrogen sulfate ionic liquid ([Hmim][HSO4-]). The [Hmim][HSO4-] is recovered, characterized by 1H NMR and reused to yield novel polysaccharide-based adsorbents. As-obtained PEC materials are characterized through infrared spectroscopy, scanning electron microscopy, X-ray photoelectron spectroscopy and Zeta potential measurements. Kinetic and equilibrium adsorption studies reveal that the pseudo-second-order Kinetic, as well as the Redlich-Peterson isotherm, provide the best fits for the experimental data, respectively. CHT/ALG and DMC/ALG adsorbents promoted maximum adsorption capacities (qm) of 529.4 mg g-1 and 560.2 mg g-1, respectively. After adsorption, the materials are characterized by infrared spectroscopy and X-ray photoelectron spectroscopy, confirming that the chemisorption prevails upon Pb(II) removal. Also, PECs produced in the recovered [Hmim][HSO4-] have good capacities for removing Pb(II) ions from aqueous systems as well. This study showed that the [Hmim][HSO4-] is an alternative solvent to prepare novel and eco-friendly PEC-based adsorbents.",Rheological behaviors of Pickering emulsions stabilized by TEMPO-oxidized bacterial cellulose.,https://www.ncbi.nlm.nih.gov/pubmed/30981353,Carbohydrate polymers,2019 04 17,"The present study assesses the rheological behaviors of TEMPO-oxidized bacterial cellulose (TOBCs) with diverse oxidation degrees to explore the potential relationship between the rheology and stability of the emulsions. The TOBCs with different oxidation degrees were prepared at the NaClO dosages of 2, 6, and 10 mmol/g, designated 2-TOBC, 6-TOBC, and 10-TOBC, respectively. The small amplitude dynamic rheology and diffusing wave spectroscopy results showed that 2-TOBC emulsion had higher storage modulus G' and loss modulus G'' with lower tan δ than 6-TOBC emulsion and possessed the lowest solid-liquid balance among all of the TOBC Pickering emulsions, indicating the highest emulsion stability of 2-TOBC emulsion. Positive correlations existed between the viscoelasticity and stability of the TOBCs Pickering emulsions, with the coefficients of correlation over than 0.6. These results should improve understanding of the relationships between emulsions' stability and rheological characteristics, and lead to a potential application of TEMPO-oxidized bacterial cellulose as an emulsion stabilizer.",Acids 'generally recognized as safe' affect morphology and biocompatibility of electrospun chitosan/polyethylene oxide nanofibers.,https://www.ncbi.nlm.nih.gov/pubmed/30981352,Carbohydrate polymers,2019 04 17,"Electrospinning of neat chitosan is currently achieved by using strong acids or organic solvents, which limits the use of chitosan nanofibers as biocompatible scaffolds for drug delivery and tissue engineering. The aim was to elucidate the effect of specific acids generally recognized as safe (GRAS) on the properties of electrospun chitosan-based nanofibers. Electrospinning chitosan in dilute acetic acid or succinic acid with polyethylene oxide resulted in white and separated nanofibers, whereas nanofibers electrospun in dilute citric acid were transparent and interconnected. Including succinic or citric acid in the spinning process induced disintegration of the fiber mat after four hours in water, and a concentration-dependent effect on epithelial cell viability. Chitosan nanofibers electrospun in acetic acid maintained their shape and fibrous structure after four hours in water, and showed no effect on cell viability. This study demonstrates that the choice of GRAS acid highly determines the properties of electrospun chitosan nanofibers.",Self-assembled amphiphilic chitosan: A time-dependent nanostructural evolution and associated drug encapsulation/elution mechanism.,https://www.ncbi.nlm.nih.gov/pubmed/30981351,Carbohydrate polymers,2019 04 17,"This investigation reports the nanostructural evolution and associated encapsulation and elution of a hydrophobic drug, demethoxycurcumin (DMC), as a molecular probe, with the carboxymethyl-hexanoyl chitosan (CHC), which has been a technically interesting amphiphilic chitosan-based polymer successfully developed in this lab for years. The self-assembly nature of the CHC in neutral aqueous solutions allowed efficient encapsulation of various drugs without deteriorating or changing drugs' activity. However, its self-assembly behavior associated with nanostructural stability or variation, in terms of residence time in aqueous solution has not been well characterized and how the CHC nanostructure may be altered upon entrapping a drug, followed releasing out of the nanostructure. In this study, the CHC/DMC assembled model was used to evaluate entrapping efficiency, CHC-DMC interaction, and nanostructural variation while the drug being encapsulated and released from the CHC nanoparticles. Experimental outcomes showed a fractal transition between nanoparticulate and short fiber-like network evolution of the CHC as time elapsed, with the presence or absence of the DMC probe. This entrapment of DMC is relatively efficient upon CHC assembly and the associated DMC arrangement inside the helical CHC macromolecule gave largely increasing space over the resulting CHC/DMC assembly. Its excellent colloidal and nanostructural stability over a reasonably long period of time in testing environment suggests that this CHC/DMC assembly not only provides a crucial advantage for drug delivery application but also considers as a nanostructural model for better understanding of the mechanism upon drug encapsulation and elution which may be applicable to alternative amphiphilic polysaccharide-based macromolecules.",High antibacterial activity of chitosan - molybdenum disulfide nanocomposite.,https://www.ncbi.nlm.nih.gov/pubmed/30981349,Carbohydrate polymers,2019 04 14,"Bacterial infections have evolved as a life-threatening problem afflicting people due to the abuse of antibiotics and emergence of drug-resistant bacteria. Thus developing novel antibacterial materials is an urgent need. Herein, chitosan-MoS2 (CS-MoS2) nanocomposite was synthesized through thiol ligand functionalization and chemical modification to achieve more efficient bactericidal activity. CS-MoS2 exhibited synergistic remarkable bactericidal capability against Gram-positive Staphylococcus aureus (S. aureus) and Gram-negative Escherichia coli (E.coli), where bacterial viabilities were significantly reduced. After treatment with 10 μg/mL of CS-MoS2, 100% and 98.1% of S. aureus and E.coli cells were killed respectively. A mechanism study revealed that the positively charged CS-MoS2 could interact with cell membrane, then cause damage to the membrane and cellular constituents by generation of reactive oxygen species (ROS) and glutathione (GSH) oxidation, finally inhibit bacterial growth. The CS-MoS2 could be an attractive antibacterial agent with improved efficiency and provide more strategies for application of MoS2.","Graft-copolymer of polyacrylamide-tamarind seed gum: Synthesis, characterization and evaluation of flocculating potential in peroral paracetamol suspension.",https://www.ncbi.nlm.nih.gov/pubmed/30981348,Carbohydrate polymers,2019 04 17,"In the present study, polyacrylamide-grafted-tamarind seed gum (PAAm-g-TSG) was synthesised employing free radical method assisted with microwave where cerric (IV) ammonium nitrate (CAN) was used as free radical initiator. Effects of monomer, CAN and microwave irradiation time (MW) on grafting were studied. Various grafting indicators such as % grafting (%G), % grafting efficiency (%GE) and % conversion (%Cn) were calculated. MW and CAN exhibited major contribution in the synthesis. Highest % grafting (890.3%) was shown in the batch with 10 g acrylamide, 400 mg CAN and 1 min MW. Grafted TSG was then characterized by elemental analysis, FTIR, solid state 13C NMR, DSC, TGA, XRD, viscosity, SEM, acute oral toxicity and biodegradability study. Nontoxic and biodegradable natures of PAAm-g-TSG were revealed in the study. Finally, flocculating property of the grafted gum was evaluated in paracetamol suspension. The flocculation study demonstrates that all batches of graft copolymer showed to have good flocculating efficiency in paracetamol suspension and the capacity increases with increase in both concentration and grafting. S11 batch (highest %G = 890.3) exhibited highest degree of flocculation (β = 5.14 ± 0.26) among others."

Their nanofibers hold great potential for biomedicine, which however, are seldom applied in the field due to the lack of crosslinking method. In this work, we report a periodate oxidation - adipic acid dihydrazide (ADH) crosslinking strategy to prepare robust and biocompatible neutral polysaccharide nanofibers. Neutral polysaccharides with adjacent dihydroxyl groups are firstly partially oxidized with periodate to give dialdehyde polysaccharides, and their electrospun nanofibers are then crosslinked with ADH to form dihydrazone crosslinkers. The resulting crosslinked neutral polysaccharide nanofibers exhibit high water resistance and excellent mechanical properties because of the high reactivity of Schiff base crosslinking reaction. Moreover, the crosslinked neutral polysaccharide nanofibers show good biocompatibility due to the low toxicity of ADH. These robust and biocompatible neutral polysaccharide nanofibers are expected to seek extensive applications in a variety of biomedical fields.",Structural characterization and rheological properties of a pectin with anti-constipation activity from the roots of Arctium lappa L.,https://www.ncbi.nlm.nih.gov/pubmed/30981336,Carbohydrate polymers,2019 04 14,"A new pectin (ALP-2) was extracted from the roots of Arctium lappa L. with the molecular weight of 1.84 × 106 Da. ALP-2 was composed of rhamnose, glucuronic acid, galacturonic acid, glucose, galactose, xylose and arabinose. Results of NMR revealed that the dominant linkage types of ALP-2 were →4-α-GalpA-6-OMe-(1→, →2-α-Rha-(1→, →5-α-Araf-(1→ and →3,6-β-Galp-(1→. The ELISA results indicated ALP-2 was a typical pectin with HG chain and RG-I chain. The rheological experiments showed that ALP-2 fluid exhibited shear thinning behavior. The viscosity of ALP-2 was mainly affected by concentration, temperature, and pH. The ALP-2 fluid with elastic properties at high frequencies could be used as a thickener in the food industry. Moreover, ALP-2 with the dosages of 200 mg/kg and 400 mg/kg exhibited strong anti-constipation activity in vivo. ALP-2 treated groups could improve small intestinal movement rate and increase the weight of feces significantly in constipation mice. Therefore, ALP-2 could be considered as the active component for functional food or therapeutic agent in constipation therapy.",Synthesis of urea-functionalized chitosan derivatives for potential antifungal and antioxidant applications.,https://www.ncbi.nlm.nih.gov/pubmed/30981335,Carbohydrate polymers,2019 04 14,"In the current study, five novel urea-functionalized chitosan derivatives were synthesized via condensation reactions of chloroacetyl chitosan (CTCS) with urea groups bearing nitrogen-containing heterocycles. In order to identify the structure characteristics of chitosan derivatives, FT-IR, 1H NMR spectroscopy, and elemental analysis were carried out. The antifungal activity of the derivatives against four species of phytopathogen (Fusarium oxysporum f. sp. niveum, Phomopsis asparagus, Fusarium oxysporum f. sp. cucumebrium Owen, and Botrytis cinerea) was evaluated. Furthermore, the antioxidant activity of chitosan derivatives was tested by hydroxyl-radical scavenging and superoxide-radical scavenging assays. The results indicated that chitosan derivatives bearing urea groups displayed superior bioactivity compared with chitosan. Besides, L929 cells were adopted for cytotoxicity test of chitosan and synthesized samples by CCK-8 assay and all samples showed decreased cytotoxicity. These results suggested that the novel urea-functionalized chitosan derivatives could be an ideal biomaterial for antifungal and antioxidant applications.","A functional polysaccharide film forming by pectin, chitosan, and tea polyphenols.",https://www.ncbi.nlm.nih.gov/pubmed/30981334,Carbohydrate polymers,2019 04 17,"The formation, properties and functions of a polysaccharide film (CPFT) were investigated. CPFT was created by loading TP into pectin and chitosan matrix by blending method. Comparing with control, the thickness and the water vapor permeability of CPFT were increased with the addition of TP, and the tensile strength of CPFT was reduced by 17% while its elongation at break was increased by 37%. Then, fourier transform infrared (FTIR) spectrum and scanning electron microscope (SEM) results showed that TP had interacted with the film substrates and might made CPFT more complex. Furthermore, CPFT showed the remarkable slow-release, antioxidant and antiseptic activities, which were all concentration-dependent. Moreover, the degeneration of color in fresh beef could be effectively inhibited by CPFT during the 8 days storage.

A comparative study was designed to evaluate the in vitro acaricidal efficacy of imidacloprid nano-emulsion, zinc oxide nanoparticles (ZnO NPs), silver nanoparticles (Ag NPs), deltamethrin, deltamethrin-ZnO NPs, and deltamethrin-Ag NPs. In addition, the novel formulations of deltamethrin (deltamethrin-ZnO NPs and deltamethrin-Ag NPs) against Rhipicephalus (Boophilus) annulatus were also evaluated by in vivo animal efficacy trials. Nanoparticles and their loaded forms, deltamethrin-Ag NPs and deltamethrin-ZnO NPs, were characterized by Transmission Electron Microscope (TEM) and Fourier-Transform Infrared Spectrum (FTIR). The adulticidal activity of deltamethrin-ZnO NPs at different concentrations; 2 mL/L, 1 mL/L, 0.5 mL/L and 0.25 mL/L induced a significant (P ≤ 0.05) lethal effect on adult ticks compared to deltamethrin-Ag NPs at the same concentrations. The larvicidal efficacy of deltamethrin-ZnO NPs resulted in a complete larval mortality within 24 h of exposure, while deltamethrin and deltamethrin-Ag NPs exhibited 100% immobility of larvae 48 h post-exposure. Furthermore, the in vivo experiments showed a considerable reduction in the tick's survival after using deltamethrin-ZnO NPs. There was no significant effect of different treatments on liver or kidney function tests at pre- and post-treatment of animals. In conclusion, deltamethrin-ZnO nanocomposite was the most effective adulticide and larvicide against R. (B.) annulatus. To the best of our knowledge, this is the first report for using deltamethrin-ZnO NPs as an acaricide.",Propagation of Giardia duodenalis cysts in immunosuppressed CF-1 mice.,https://www.ncbi.nlm.nih.gov/pubmed/30981303,Veterinary parasitology,2019 05 13,"This study developed and evaluated Giardia duodenalis cyst propagation using a dexamethasone immunosuppressed CF-1 mouse model as an alternative to a previously described Mongolian gerbil model. The CF-1 mouse model shed significantly more cysts per animal during a 16-18 h collection period compared to the gerbil (averages: 7.8 × 106 cysts/CF-1 mouse and 2.5 × 106 cysts/gerbil). In addition, the patency period for this model differed from both G. muris in mice and G. duodenalis in gerbils in that cysts were shed continuously for over 20 days. Results further showed that the β-giardin gene sequences from gerbil derived and mouse derived G. duodenalis were identical, after 34 serial passages through the CF-1 mouse model. Overall, the CF-1 mouse model produced higher concentrations of cysts per animal, and were genetically and phenotypically stable based on β-giardin gene sequences.",Fasciola spp. in Armenia: Genetic diversity in a global context.,https://www.ncbi.nlm.nih.gov/pubmed/30981302,Veterinary parasitology,2019 05 13,"Fasciolosis, a food- and waterborne infection caused by the trematodes Fasciola hepatica and F. gigantica, is recognized by WHO as a neglected zoonotic disease. Whereas F. hepatica is distributed worldwide in cooler climates, F. gigantica occurs mainly in the tropics of Africa and Asia. The southern Caucasus, with Armenia, is one of the most northern regions where both species occur and may produce hybrids. In this study, livestock in central Armenia was surveyed for fasciolosis, the causative species were determined and the genetic diversity of both species was estimated. Total prevalence in sheep (1794), cattle (324) and goats (9) was 21.2%, 15.7% and 44.4%, respectively. After morphological identification and sequencing of a mitochondrial (nad1) and a nuclear marker gene (28S rRNA), 62 collected specimens were allocated to F. hepatica (n = 55) and F. gigantica (n = 7). Intraspecific diversity was evaluated for the complete nad1 gene, resulting in 29 haplotypes of F. hepatica and six haplotypes of F. gigantica. Diversity was higher among F. gigantica than F. hepatica in the Armenian sample set, a difference that was confirmed analyzing available sequences for both species worldwide. Maximum genetic distance between haplotypes in global networks was 49 nucleotide steps for F. gigantica compared to 15 for F. hepatica. In the available sample sets, F. hepatica showed higher diversity in western Asia and the Middle East compared to Europe and eastern Asia, while for F. gigantica loosely structured clusters comprising mainly western/southern Asian and African haplotypes could be identified. A distinct clade comprising haplotypes from Zambia was basal in the phylogenetic tree. Biogeographical implications of these data are discussed.",Inflammasome activation restrains the intracellular Neospora caninum proliferation in bovine macrophages.,https://www.ncbi.nlm.nih.gov/pubmed/30981301,Veterinary parasitology,2019 05 13,"Neospora caninum is an intracellular parasite that causes neosporosis in cattle. Bovine neosporosis is considered a major cause of bovine abortion worldwide. Rapid replication of N. caninum tachyzoites within host cells is responsible for the acute phase of N. caninum infection. Evidence shows that the host immune response plays an essential role in recognizing and regulating the replication of invading pathogens. Nucleotide-binding oligomerization domain receptors (NLRs) are a class of cytoplasmic sensors that can sense pathogens and induce the formation of the inflammasome complex. Activation of the inflammasome promotes restriction of microbial replication. Our previous study revealed NLRP3 inflammasome activation in N. caninum-infected murine macrophages. However, the role of inflammasome activity in N. caninum-infected bovine cells is unknown. To address this question, a bovine peritoneal macrophage cell line was used to investigate the role of inflammasome activation in regulating intracellular N. caninum replication. The results showed that inflammasome mediated activation of caspase-1 occurs in N. caninum-infected bovine macrophages, and caspase-1-dependent cell death was considered to be induced in N. caninum-infected bovine macrophages because N. caninum induced cell death decreased following pretreatment with zVAD-fmk and VX765. Meanwhile, the inhibition of caspase-1 in N. caninum-infected bovine macrophages led to the presence of more parasites in the parasitophorous vacuole. In contrast, inflammasome activation induced by ATP treatment in N. caninum-infected bovine macrophages contributed to the clearance of N. caninum. In addition, pyroptotic cell supernatant collected from ATP-stimulated bovine macrophages also impaired the ability of this parasite to infect new cells. In conclusion, this study is the first report on the role of the bovine inflammasome in restraining intracellular N. caninum replication and suggests that the bovine inflammasome may be a potential target for future development of drugs or vaccines against N. caninum infection in cattle.",The rash that leads to eschar formation.,https://www.ncbi.nlm.nih.gov/pubmed/30981299,Clinics in dermatology,2019 04 14,"When confronted with an existent or evolving eschar, the history is often the most important factor used to put the lesion into proper context. Determining whether the patient has a past medical history of significance, such as renal failure or diabetes mellitus, exposure to dead or live wildlife, or underwent a recent surgical procedure, can help differentiate between many etiologies of eschars. Similarly, the patient's overall clinical condition and the presence or absence of fever can allow infectious processes to be differentiated from other causes.

Several diseases with different etiologies characteristically appear as erythroderma. Depending on the age groups, congenital ichthyosiform disorders, infections, preexisting dermatoses, drug eruptions, and internal malignancies commonly present with, or progress to, erythroderma. The course, prognosis, and management strategies also vary depending on the cause of erythroderma; hence, an accurate diagnosis is essential in minimizing associated morbidity and mortality. The generalized erythema and scaling often obscure the classic clinical features of the underlying skin diseases, posing a diagnostic challenge to dermatologists. Awareness and elicitation of subtle signs and clinical manifestations are crucial. A step-wise approach ensures completeness of clinical evaluation and avoids missing any relevant clinical data. The initial clinical presentation, cutaneous examination findings, and systemic clues reveal important information regarding the diagnosis, course, and prognosis of erythroderma. The age at onset, symptomatology, duration of illness, initial lesions, initial site of onset, clinical course, family history, types of scales, changes in cutaneous integuments and systemic clues will assist in delineating the nature of underlying disease.",Mechanisms of microbial pathogenesis and the role of the skin microbiome in psoriasis: A review.,https://www.ncbi.nlm.nih.gov/pubmed/30981296,Clinics in dermatology,2019 04 14,"The pathogenesis of psoriasis may involve a breakdown of immune tolerance to cutaneous microorganisms. Psoriasis is associated with a higher incidence of Crohn disease and periodontitis, two diseases involving impaired tolerance and abnormal immune activation in response to intestinal and oral microbiota, respectively. In addition, guttate and chronic plaque psoriasis are associated with Streptococcus pyogenes colonization. The aim of this review is to characterize the microorganisms implicated in psoriasis by examining results of major association studies and possible mechanisms of pathogenesis. Although studies show relative increases in Streptococcus and Staphylococcus and decreases in Malassezia and Cutibacterium, they differ in methods of sampling and methods of microbial analysis. As such, no definitive associations between microbes and psoriasis have been found to date. It also remains unclear if changes in the microbiomal composition have a causal association with psoriasis or are simply a consequence of the inflammatory microenvironment. Techniques enabling strain-level analysis rather than species-level analysis of the skin microbiome are likely necessary to determine microbiomal signatures of psoriasis. Future investigations may lead to new diagnostic tests and novel treatments, such as probiotics or bacterial transplantation.",The rash that presents as target lesions.,https://www.ncbi.nlm.nih.gov/pubmed/30981295,Clinics in dermatology,2019 04 14,"We have explored the rash that appears as target lesions, with the central and dominant diseases belonging to the Stevens-Johnson syndrome/toxic epidermal necrolysis group.

How do people choose where to allocate their visual resources when viewing complex social scenarios? For typically developing (TD) individuals, faces are often given priority. Depending upon context, however, it may be more useful to attend to other aspects of the environment, such as hands, tools, or background objects. Previous studies reported reduced face looking in individuals with autism spectrum disorder (ASD), but modulation of visual attention in response to contextual differences (e.g., according to social richness, or the presence/absence of communicative behaviors between two people) has only briefly been explored.

Using a path integral approach, we derive the linear response of any state observable to initiating shear in terms of correlation functions evaluated in the unperturbed system. For systems and observables which are symmetric under exchange of the x and y coordinates, the response formula can be drastically simplified to a form containing only state variables in the corresponding correlation functions (compared to the generic formula containing also time derivatives). In general, the shear couples to the particles by translational as well as rotational advection, but in the aforementioned case of xy symmetry, only translational advection is relevant in the linear regime. We apply the response formulas analytically in solvable cases and numerically in a specific setup. In particular, we investigate the effect of a shear flow on the morphology and the stress of N confined active particles in interaction, where we find that the activity as well as additional alignment interactions generally increase the response.",Local-structure effects on 31P NMR chemical shift tensors in solid state.,https://www.ncbi.nlm.nih.gov/pubmed/30981271,The Journal of chemical physics,2019 04 24,"The effect of the local structure on the 31P NMR chemical shift tensor (CST) has been studied experimentally and simulated theoretically using the density functional theory gauge-independent-atomic-orbital approach. It has been shown that the dominating impact comes from a small number of noncovalent interactions between the phosphorus-containing group under question and the atoms of adjacent molecules. These interactions can be unambiguously identified using the Bader analysis of the electronic density. A robust and computationally effective approach designed to attribute a given experimental 31P CST to a certain local morphology has been elaborated.

Indeed, the entries of the density matrix for the electronic excitations interacting with their open dissipative environment are mapped into vacuum-to-vacuum Green's functions in a fictitious relativistic closed quantum system. We show that by re-summing appropriate self-energy diagrams in this dual QFT, it is possible to obtain analytic expressions for the response functions in Mukamel's theory. This yields physical insight into the structure and dynamics of vibronic resonances, since their frequency and width is related to fundamental physical constants and microscopic model parameters. For illustration, we apply this scheme to compute the linear absorption spectrum of the Fenna-Matthews-Olson light harvesting complex, comparing analytic calculations, numerical Monte Carlo simulations, and experimental data.",Breakdown of the scallop theorem for an asymmetrical folding molecular motor in soft matter.,https://www.ncbi.nlm.nih.gov/pubmed/30981269,The Journal of chemical physics,2019 04 24,"We use molecular dynamic simulations to investigate the motion of a folding molecular motor inside soft matter. Purcell's scallop theorem forbids the displacement of the motor due to time symmetrical hydrodynamic laws at low Reynolds numbers whatever the asymmetry of the folding and unfolding rates. However, the fluctuation theorems imply a violation of the time symmetry of the motor's trajectories due to the entropy generated by the motor, suggesting a breakdown of the scallop theorem at the nanoscale. To clarify this picture, we study the predicted violation of time reversibility of the motor's trajectories, using two reverse asymmetric folding mechanisms. We actually observe this violation of time reversibility of the motor's trajectories. We also observe the previously reported fluidization of the medium induced by the motor's folding, but find that this induced diffusion is not enough to explain the increase of the motor's displacement. As a result, the motor is not carried by the medium in our system but moves by its own, in violation of the scallop theorem. The observed violation of the scallop theorem opens a route to create very simple molecular motors moving in soft matter environments."

Guided ion beam tandem mass spectrometry was used to measure the kinetic energy dependent product ion cross sections for these reactions. NdO+ is formed through a barrierless exothermic process when the atomic metal cation reacts with O2 and CO2. All other reactions are observed to be endothermic. Analyses of the kinetic energy dependences of these cross sections yield 0 K bond dissociation energies (BDEs) for several species. The 0 K BDE for Nd+-O is determined to be 7.28 ± 0.10 eV from the average of four independent thresholds. This value is combined with the well-established Nd ionization energy to indicate an exothermicity of the title reaction of 1.76 ± 0.10 eV, which is lower and more precise than literature values. In addition, the Nd+-C, ONd+-O, and Nd+-CO BDEs are determined to be 2.61 ± 0.30, 2.12 ± 0.30, and 0.30 ± 0.21 eV. Additionally, theoretical BDEs of Nd+-O, Nd+-C, ONd+-O, and Nd+-CO are calculated at several levels for comparison with the experimental values. B3LYP calculations seriously underestimate the Nd+-O BDE, whereas MP2 and coupled-cluster with single, double-and perturbative triple excitations values are in reasonable agreement.

The first approach is a unitary multi-state formalism based on the DSRG (MS-DSRG), whereby an effective Hamiltonian is built from a set of state-specific solutions. The second approach employs a dynamic weighting parameter to smoothly interpolate between the multi-state and the state-averaged DSRG schemes. The resulting dynamically weighted DSRG (DW-DSRG) theory incorporates the most desirable features of both multi-state approaches (ability to accurately treat many states) and state-averaged methods (correct description of avoided crossings and conical intersections). We formulate second-order perturbation theories (PT2) based on the MS- and DW-DSRG and study the potential energy curves of LiF, the conical intersection of the two lowest singlet states of NH3, and several low-lying excited states of benzene, naphthalene, and anthracene. The DW-DSRG-PT2 predicts the correct avoided crossing of LiF and avoids artifacts produced by the corresponding state-specific and multi-state theories. Excitation energies of the acenes computed with the DW-DSRG-PT2 are found to be more accurate than the corresponding state-averaged values, showing a small dependence on the number of states computed.",Infrared bands of CS2 dimer and trimer at 4.5 μm.,https://www.ncbi.nlm.nih.gov/pubmed/30981255,The Journal of chemical physics,2019 04 24,"We report observation of new infrared bands of (CS2)2 and (CS2)3 in the region of the CS2 ν1 + ν3 combination band (at 4.5 µm) using a quantum cascade laser. The complexes are formed in a pulsed supersonic slit-jet expansion of a gas mixture of carbon disulfide in helium. We have previously shown that the most stable isomer of (CS2)2 is a cross-shaped structure with D2d symmetry and that for (CS2)3 is a barrel-shaped structure with D3 symmetry. The dimer has one doubly degenerate infrared-active band in the ν1 + ν3 region of the CS2 monomer. This band is observed to have a rather small vibrational shift of -0.844 cm-1. We expect one parallel and one perpendicular infrared-active band for the trimer but observe two parallel bands and one perpendicular band. Much larger vibrational shifts of -8.953 cm-1 for the perpendicular band and -8.845 cm-1 and +16.681 cm-1 for the parallel bands are observed.

Increased activity can melt a two-dimensional solid and the melting lines remain disjoint from MIPS. We establish this phase diagram for a range of the inter-particle potential stiffnesses and identify the MIPS phase even in the hard-disk limit.

The observed optical Stark shifts were analyzed to determine permanent electric dipole moments, μ→el for the [18.0]1.5 and X2Σ+ states of 4.38 ± 0.02D and 5.11 ± 0.09D, respectively. Zeeman shifts were used to determine the magnetic g-factors.

A molecular orbital correlation diagram and ligand field electronic structure models are used to provide a qualitative interpretation of the electronic state ordering, magneto- and electro-static properties, and hyperfine interactions. Electronic structure calculations for the X2Σ+ state were performed, and results were compared with observations.

While the exact dependence of F on W is unknown, a few approximate parametric models have been proposed in the past. Here, for a dataset of 923 one-dimensional external potentials with two interacting electrons, we apply machine learning to model F within the kernel Ansatz. We deal with over-fitting of the kernel to a specific region of phase-space by a one-step regularization not depending on any hyperparameters. Reference correlation energies have been computed by performing exact and Hartree-Fock calculations using discrete variable representation. The resulting models require W calculated at the Hartree-Fock level as input while yielding monotonous decay in the predicted correlation energies of new molecules reaching sub-chemical accuracy with training.",Pseudocontact shifts and paramagnetic susceptibility in semiempirical and quantum chemistry theories.,https://www.ncbi.nlm.nih.gov/pubmed/30981251,The Journal of chemical physics,2019 04 24,"Pseudocontact shifts are traditionally described as a function of the anisotropy of the paramagnetic susceptibility tensor, according to the semiempirical theory mainly developed by Kurland and McGarvey [J. Magn. Reson. 2, 286-301 (1970)]. The paramagnetic susceptibility tensor is required to be symmetric. Applying point-dipole approximation to the quantum chemistry theory of hyperfine shift, pseudocontact shifts are found to scale with a non-symmetric tensor that differs by a factor gT/ge from the paramagnetic susceptibility tensor derived within the semiempirical framework. We analyze the foundations of the Kurland-McGarvey pseudocontact shift expression and recall that it is inherently based on the Russell-Saunders (LS) coupling approximation for the spin-orbit coupling. We show that the difference between the semiempirical and quantum chemistry pseudocontact shift expressions arises directly from the different treatment of the orbital contribution to the hyperfine coupling.",Quantifying the photoionization cross section of the hydroxyl radical.,https://www.ncbi.nlm.nih.gov/pubmed/30981250,The Journal of chemical physics,2019 04 24,"The hydroxyl free radical, OH, is one of the most important radicals in atmospheric and interstellar chemistry, and its cation plays a role in the reactions leading to H2O formation. Knowledge of the photoionization efficiency of the OH radical is crucial to properly model the water photochemical cycle of atmospheres and astrophysical objects. Using a gas-phase radical source based on a single H-abstraction reaction combined with a photoelectron/photoion imaging coincidence spectrometer coupled with synchrotron radiation, we recorded the OH+ photoion yield over the 12.6-15 eV energy range, and we set it to an absolute cross section scale using an absolute point measurement performed at 13.8 eV: σOHion=9.0±2.7 Mb. The resulting cross section values differ by approximately a factor 2 from the recent measurement of Dodson et al. [J. Chem.

This finding underlines the need for further investigations of this cross section.",Theoretical equations of state for a charged fluid.,https://www.ncbi.nlm.nih.gov/pubmed/30981249,The Journal of chemical physics,2019 04 24,"In this article, we present a molecular thermodynamic study of a system of N particles contained within a volume V and interacting via a hard-core pair potential with an attractive interaction according to the Wolf model for charged systems. This variable-range potential is characterized by three parameters: the repulsive hard-core diameter σ, the energy-well depth ϵ, and the inverse range α; a fourth parameter of the model is a cut-off distance xc that depends on α according to the relation xc = 2/α. Two equations of state (EOSs) are presented and derived from thermodynamic perturbation theory and Monte Carlo (MC) simulation data. The first EOS is given by the standard Zwanzig's high-temperature expansion of the Helmholtz free energy, where the first three perturbation terms a1, a2, and a3 were obtained from MC simulations in the canonical ensemble (NVT) and parameterized as functions of α and the reduced density of particles ρ* = Nσ3/V. The second EOS was obtained from the discrete perturbation theory applied to a discrete representation of the Wolf potential. Results for pressures, internal energies, and isochoric heat capacities are compared to the MC computer simulation data of the Wolf system, including vapor-liquid coexistence curves, for different values of α. Overall, both EOSs give a very good representation of the thermodynamic properties of the Wolf fluid when 0.3 ≤ α ≤ 1.0 and 0.05 ≤ ρ* ≤ 0.8. Since the Yukawa fluid can reproduce information of screened ionic interactions, we discuss the equivalence between the Wolf and Yukawa fluids in the context of equivalent systems in liquid theory."

Recently, experiments using a unification strategy of standard decoupling schemes were presented for high radio-frequency (RF) amplitudes and slow-intermediate magic-angle-spinning (MAS) frequencies, in the pursuit of deeper understanding of spin decoupling under phase-modulated RF irradiation [A. Equbal et al., J. Chem. Phys. 142, 184201 (2015)]. The approach, unified two-pulse heteronuclear decoupling (UTPD), incorporates the simultaneous time- and phase-modulation strategies, commonly used in solid-state NMR. Here, the UTPD based decoupling scheme is extended to the experimentally increasingly important regime of low RF amplitudes and fast MAS frequencies. The unified decoupling approach becomes increasingly effective in identifying the deleterious dipole-dipole and, in particular, J recoupling conditions which become critical for the low-amplitude RF regime. This is because J coupling is isotropic and therefore not averaged out by sample spinning unlike the anisotropic dipole-dipole coupling. Numerical simulations and analytic theory are used to understand the effects of various nuclear spin interactions on the decoupling performance of UTPD, in particular, the crucial difference between the low-phase and high-phase UTPD conditions with respect to J coupling. In the UTPD scheme, when the cycle-frequency of the pulse-sequence is comparable to the RF nutation frequency, the existence of a non-zero effective rotation in the basic two-pulse scheme becomes an essential feature for the efficient and robust averaging out of the scalar J coupling. This broad viewpoint is expected to bring different optimum low-power decoupling pulse schemes under a common footing.",Analytic liquid state theory of the polymer-mediated depletion interaction between colloids beyond preaveraging approximation.,https://www.ncbi.nlm.nih.gov/pubmed/30981234,The Journal of chemical physics,2019 04 24,"We develop a version of the polymer reference interaction site model of the polymer-mediated depletion interaction not relying on the conventional preaveraging of the polymer correlation functions (so-called ""preaveraging of the polymer end effects""). The developed approach makes it possible to properly take into account the entropic interactions between the polymers and colloid surfaces, imposed by the polymer end effects. These entropic interactions are shown to give rise to an additional long-ranged contribution to the depletion potential that is comparable to its main osmotic part. The presence of the described entropic interactions essentially changes, in particular, the dependence of the second virial coefficient on the colloid radius. Based on the detailed comparison with the simulations in the work of Doxastakis et al. [J. Chem. Phys. 123, 034901 (2005)], we suggest that the described entropic effect gives an explanation for the fact that the range of the depletion potential obtained in these simulations is of the order of the polymer gyration radius even at relatively large polymer densities.",Influence of film thickness on the stability of free-standing Lennard-Jones fluid films.,https://www.ncbi.nlm.nih.gov/pubmed/30981233,The Journal of chemical physics,2019 04 24,"Molecular dynamics simulations of thin free-standing Lennard-Jones fluid films were carried out with a view of establishing the thickness range over which such films are thermodynamically stable. Thermophysical and interfacial properties were studied as a function of film thickness, and we found that free-standing films at 116 K are no longer stable below a critical film thickness of about 3.3 nm in laboratory units appropriate for methane. In particular, films having a smaller thickness than this critical value collapsed to form spherical droplets. Although the size of our simulated system affects the thickness of the layers and the corresponding thickness of the interface and the densities of coexisting phases, the estimated surface tension was found to be remarkably insensitive to finite size effects. We also found that the standard deviation of the surface tension diminished with an increasing size of the simulation cell in the interfacial plane. However, these finite size effects do not alter the order of magnitude of the predicted critical film thickness and our qualitative conclusion that the surface tension is relatively insensitive to film thickness in these model thin films.",Size dependence of dynamic fluctuations in liquid and supercooled water.,https://www.ncbi.nlm.nih.gov/pubmed/30981232,The Journal of chemical physics,2019 04 24,"We study the evolution of dynamic fluctuations averaged over different space lengths and time scales to characterize spatially and temporally heterogeneous behavior of TIP4P/2005 water in liquid and supercooled states.

We show that both the magnitude of the departure from the value expected for the system-size dependence of an uncorrelated system and the system size at which such a trivial regime is finally recovered clearly increase upon supercooling. This provides a means to estimate an upper limit to the maximum length scale of influence of the regions of correlated mobile molecules. Notably, such an upper limit grows two orders of magnitude on cooling, reaching a value corresponding to a few thousand molecules at the lowest investigated temperature.",Excess entropy and long-time diffusion in colloidal fluids with short-range interparticle attraction.,https://www.ncbi.nlm.nih.gov/pubmed/30981231,The Journal of chemical physics,2019 04 24,"Liquid structure and dynamics are experimentally investigated in colloidal suspensions with short-range depletion attraction. The colloidal fluid samples consist of hard-sphere colloidal particles suspended along with rodlike depletants based on surfactant micelles. The spheres have a range of surface chemistries, diameters, and packing fractions, and the rodlike micelle length depends on the temperature. Thus, the combination of hard-spheres and depletants generates a sample wherein short-range interparticle attraction can be temperature-tuned in situ. Video optical microscopy and particle tracking techniques are employed to measure particle trajectories from which structural and dynamical quantities are derived, including the particle pair correlation function [g(r)], mean square displacement, long-time diffusion coefficient, and the sample two-body excess entropy (S2). The samples with stronger short-range attractions exhibit more order, as characterized by g(r) and S2. The stronger short-range attractions are also observed to lead to slower long-time diffusion and more heterogeneous dynamics at intermediate time scales. Finally, the excess entropy scaling law prediction, i.e., the exponential relationship between two-body excess entropy and long-time diffusivity, is observed across the full range of samples.",Bacterial chromosome organization.

Furthermore, we show that the chain compaction induced by the crowded environment in the bacterial cytoplasm contributes to the organization of the DNA-polymer. We model the DNA chain as a flexible bead-spring ring polymer, where each bead represents 1000 base pairs. The specific positions of the CLs have been taken from the experimental contact maps of the bacteria Caulobacter crescentus and Escherichia coli. We introduce different extents of ease of release of topological constraints in our model by systematically changing the diameter of the monomer bead. It varies from the value where chain crossing can occur freely to the value where chain crossing is disallowed.

It is shown that the prefactor can be obtained by a partial phonon DOS calculation of the active region with a simple correction term accounting for the environment, under reasonable assumptions regarding atomic interactions. Convergence with respect to the size of the active region is investigated for different systems, as well as the reduction in computational costs when compared to full phonon DOS calculation.

Here, using a suite of statistical thermodynamic techniques, we calculate the solubility of carbon atoms in liquid silicon relative to the β-SiC phase. We employ several available empirical potentials to assess whether these potentials may reasonably be used to computationally analyze SiC precipitation. We find that some of the Tersoff-type potentials provide an excellent picture for carbon solubility in liquid silicon but, because of their severe silicon melting point overestimation, are limited to high temperatures where the carbon solubility is several percent, a value that is irrelevant for typical solidification conditions. Based on chemical potential calculations for pure silicon, we suggest that this well-known issue is confined to the description of the liquid phase and demonstrate that some recent potential models for silicon might address this weakness while preserving the excellent description of the carbon-silicon interaction found in the existing models.",Accurate equilibrium structures of methyl methacrylate and methacrylic acid by microwave spectroscopy and dispersion corrected calculations.,https://www.ncbi.nlm.nih.gov/pubmed/30981226,The Journal of chemical physics,2019 04 24,"The rotational constants of s-trans and s-cis methyl methacrylate and methacrylic acid are determined from microwave spectra.

The harmonic approximation, as well as anharmonic corrections using vibrational structure theories such as vibrational self-consistent field, vibrational second-order Møller-Plesset perturbation, and vibrational configuration interaction (VCI), is applied to address the vibrational motions. We compare the vibrational results using the mbCO2 potential function with traditional electronic structure theory results and to experimental frequencies. The anharmonic results for the monomer most closely match the experimental data to within 3 cm-1, including the Fermi dyad frequencies. The intermolecular and intramolecular dimer frequencies were treated separately and show good agreement with the most recent theoretical and experimental results from the literature. The VCI treatment of the dimer vibrational motions accounts for vibrational mixing and delocalization, such that we observe the dimer Fermi resonance phenomena, both in the intramolecular and intermolecular regions."

Epithelial stress, induced by other non-antigenic gliadin peptides, is required for gliadin to become fully immunogenic. We found that cystic-fibrosis-transmembrane-conductance-regulator (CFTR) acts as membrane receptor for gliadin-derived peptide P31-43, as it binds to CFTR and impairs its channel function. P31-43-induced CFTR malfunction generates epithelial stress and intestinal inflammation. Maintaining CFTR in an active open conformation by the CFTR potentiators VX-770 (Ivacaftor) or Vrx-532, prevents P31-43 binding to CFTR and controls gliadin-induced manifestations. Here, we evaluated the possibility that the over-the-counter nutraceutical genistein, known to potentiate CFTR function, would allow to control gliadin-induced alterations. We demonstrated that pre-treatment with genistein prevented P31-43-induced CFTR malfunction and an epithelial stress response in Caco-2 cells. These effects were abrogated when the CFTR gene was knocked out by CRISP/Cas9 technology, indicating that genistein protects intestinal epithelial cells by potentiating CFTR function. Notably, genistein protected gliadin-sensitive mice from intestinal CFTR malfunction and gliadin-induced inflammation as it prevented gliadin-induced IFN-γ production by celiac peripheral-blood-mononuclear-cells (PBMC) cultured ex-vivo in the presence of P31-43-challenged Caco-2 cells.

We add to the available evidence by using the Gompertz model (GM), with account for the artifactual component of the Strehler-Mildvan correlation between its parameters, to compare the survival patterns of female FVB/N and FVB/N-derived K14/mIGF1 mice. In K14/mIGF1 vs. FVB/N mice, the rate of aging (γ) is markedly increased without concomitant changes in the initial mortality (μ0). In published cases where IGF1 signaling was altered by modifying liver or muscle IGF1 or whole body IGF1R expression, lifespan changes are attributable to μ0. The accelerated aging and associated tumor yield in K14/mIGF1 mice are consistent with the finding that the age-associated decreases in thymus weight and serum thymulin are accelerated in K14/mIGF1 mice. Our results underscore the importance of accounting for the mathematical artifacts of data fitting to GM in attempts to resolve discrepancies in survival data and to differentiate the contributions of the initial mortality and the rate of aging to changes in lifespan.",Early-life vancomycin treatment promotes airway inflammation and impairs microbiome homeostasis.,https://www.ncbi.nlm.nih.gov/pubmed/30981206,Aging,2019 05 19,"Several studies have reported that gut and lung microbiomes are involved in the process of asthma pathogenesis. However, it remains unclear how perinatal or early-life antibiotic intervention affect adult allergic airway inflammation. We assigned C57BL/6 mice randomly to four experimental groups: normal saline control (NS), ovalbumin (OVA), vancomycin pretreated NS (VAN-NS), and vancomycin pretreated OVA (VAN-OVA). The vancomycin groups were orally given the drug from gestational day 14 to 6 week. An OVA-induced asthma model was then established at 6 weeks of age, and airway inflammation was evaluated. In addition, total DNA was extracted from the feces and lung tissue and used for 16S rDNA gene sequencing, to detect the composition of the microbiome. In the VAN-OVA group, airway inflammation and Th2-related cytokines were found to be significantly increased versus the control groups. Gene sequencing showed that vancomycin treatment attenuated the richness and evenness, and altered the composition of the microbiome in the gut and lung. Micrococcaceae and Clostridiaceae-1 were potentially correlated to the severity of allergic airway inflammation. Our study suggests that perinatal and early-life vancomycin intervention aggravates allergic inflammation in adulthood, which might be correlated with imbalanced gut and lung microbiome homeostasis.",MiR-204 reduces cisplatin resistance in non-small cell lung cancer through suppression of the caveolin-1/AKT/Bad pathway.,https://www.ncbi.nlm.nih.gov/pubmed/30981205,Aging,2019 05 19,"Non-small cell lung cancer (NSCLC) is the most common and lethal human malignant tumor worldwide. Platinum-based chemotherapy is still the mainstay of treatment for NSCLC. However, long-term chemotherapy usually induces serious drug resistance in NSCLC cells. Accordingly, treatment strategies that reverse the resistance of NSCLC cells against platinum-based drugs may have considerable clinical value. In the present study, we observed significant upregulation of CAV-1 expression and a significant decrease of miR-204 expression in cisplatin-resistant A549 (CR-A549) and cisplatin-resistant PC9 (CR-PC9) cells compared to their parental A549 and PC9 cells. Furthermore, we demonstrated that the downregulation of miR-204 expression was responsible for CAV-1 overexpression in these cisplatin-resistant NSCLC cells. We then found that enforced expression of miR-204 can resensitize CR-A549 and CR-PC9 cells to cisplatin-induced mitochondrial apoptosis through suppression of the caveolin-1/AKT/Bad pathway. We demonstrated that dysregulation of miR-204/caveolin-1 axis is an important mechanism for NSCLC cells to develop the chemoresistance.",Machine learning based hierarchical classification of frontotemporal dementia and Alzheimer's disease.,https://www.ncbi.nlm.nih.gov/pubmed/30981204,NeuroImage.

(Apicomplexa: Cryptosporidiidae) in Psittaciformes birds.,https://www.ncbi.nlm.nih.gov/pubmed/30981203,European journal of protistology,2019 05 08,"Cryptosporidiosis is a common parasitic infection in birds that is caused by more than 25 Cryptosporidium species and genotypes. Many of the genotypes that cause avian cryptosporidiosis are poorly characterized. The genetic and biological characteristics of avian genotype III are described here and these data support the establishment of a new species, Cryptosporidium proventriculi. Faecal samples from the orders Passeriformes and Psittaciformes were screened for the presence of Cryptosporidium by microscopy and sequencing, and infections were detected in 10 of 98 Passeriformes and in 27 of 402 Psittaciformes. Cryptosporidium baileyi was detected in both orders. Cryptosporidium galli and avian genotype I were found in Passeriformes, and C. avium and C. proventriculi were found in Psittaciformes. Cryptosporidium proventriculi was infectious for cockatiels under experimental conditions, with a prepatent period of six days post-infection (DPI), but not for budgerigars, chickens or SCID mice. Experimentally infected cockatiels shed oocysts more than 30 DPI, with an infection intensity ranging from 4,000 to 60,000 oocysts per gram (OPG). Naturally infected cockatiels shed oocysts with an infection intensity ranging from 2,000 to 30,000 OPG. Cryptosporidium proventriculi infects the proventriculus and ventriculus, and oocysts measure 7.4 × 5.8 μm.

Most of those patients are smokers, and it was suggested previously that cigarette smoke might induce Hsp70 secretion from the circulating cells. Therefore, we aimed to explore inflammation-associated effects of cigarette smoke extract (CSE) and its combinations with eHsp70 in monocyte-derived macrophages (MDMs) and THP-1 cell line, used as systemic component models of COPD. We hypothesized that eHsp70 induces inflammation, but that it can also modulate cigarette smoke extract (CSE)-stimulated inflammatory responses. We assessed IL-8 secretion, TLR2, TLR4 and Hsp70 expressions, MAPKs and NF-κB activation, and cytotoxicity after treating the cells with CSE (2.5 and 5%) and its combinations with low-endotoxin recombinant human (rh) Hsp70, used to mimic eHsp70 effects. CSE induced IL-8 secretion from both cell types, but its combinations with rhHsp70 increased IL-8 release compared to CSE alone only from MDMs. In THP-1, combinations of rhHsp70 with 2.5% CSE induced TLR2 and TLR4 mRNA, while 5% CSE decreased TLR2 expression. In MDMs, CSE alone attenuated TLR2, while rhHsp70 increased TLR2 and lowered TLR4 gene expression. Hsp70 mRNA expression was suppressed in THP-1 with rhHsp70 and CSE; however, the same treatments increased its level in MDMs. CSE had cytotoxic effect only on MDMs, but cytotoxicity was reduced in co-treatments with rhHsp70, which also triggered apoptosis. CSE and rhHsp70 activated p38 and JNK, while ERK was activated only by rhHsp70 in MDMs. In THP-1, 2.5% CSE activated ERK, and 5% CSE activated p38. Inhibition of NF-κB and JNK in MDMs, and ERK and JNK in THP-1 cells, attenuated IL-8 release after rhHsp70 treatment. In conclusion, rhHsp70 provoked pro-inflammatory effects and could also modulate inflammatory response to CSE on protein and gene expression levels in THP-1 cells and MDMs, which suggests that eHsp70 might be implicated in systemic inflammation induced by cigarette smoke.",Chemical mixtures and fluorescence in situ hybridization analysis of natural microbial community in the Tiber river.,https://www.ncbi.nlm.nih.gov/pubmed/30981201,The Science of the total environment,2019 05 21,"The Water Framework Directive (WFD) regulates freshwater and coastal water quality assessment in Europe. Chemical and ecological water quality status is based on measurements of chemical pollutants in water and biota together with other indicators such as temperature, nutrients, species compositions (phytoplankton, microalgae, benthos and fish) and hydromorphological conditions. However, in the current strategy a link between the chemical and the ecological status is missing. In the present WFD, no microbiological indicators are foreseen for integrating the different anthropogenic pressures, including mixtures of chemicals, nutrients and temperature changes, to provide a holistic view of the freshwater ecosystem water quality. The main aim of this work was to evaluate if natural microbial populations can be valuable indicators of multiple stressors (e.g. chemical pollutants, temperature, nutrients etc.) to guide preventive and remediation actions by water authorities. A preliminary survey was conducted to identify four sites reflecting a contamination gradient from the source to the mouth of a river suitable to the objectives of the European Marie Curie project, MicroCoKit. The River Tiber (Italy) was selected as a pilot case study to investigate the correlation between bacteria taxa and the chemical status of the river. The main physicochemical parameters, inorganic elements, organic pollutants and natural microbial community composition were assessed at four selected sites corresponding to pristine, agricultural, industrial and urban areas for three consecutive years. The overall chemical results indicated a correspondence between different groups of contaminants and the main contamination sources at the selected sampling points. Phylogenetic analysis of the microbial community analyzed by Fluorescence In Situ Hybridization method (FISH) revealed differences among the four sampling sites which could reflect an adaptive bacterial response to the different anthropogenic pressures.",Energy and carbon footprints of chicken and pork from intensive production systems in Argentina.,https://www.ncbi.nlm.nih.gov/pubmed/30981200,The Science of the total environment,2019 05 17,"Due to the heterogeneity and complexity of food systems, there is a need to increase the knowledge on environmental impacts of regional productions by performing studies in a transparent manner, so that researchers could compare and accurately adapt such data to assess mitigation strategies. With the exception of beef, chicken and pork are the most consumed meats in Argentina and their consumption is expected to continuing increasing. However, despite the growing importance of chicken and pork industry, no studies on environmental impact of these products have been conducted to date in this country. Performing a life cycle inventory with data derived from government statistical publications, academia and communications with industry, the present study aims to investigate the energy and carbon footprints per ton of live weight (LW) of chickens and pigs from intensive production systems at farm gate in Argentina. In addition, we discussed in detail the effects on energy and carbon footprints of two animal diets which comprise different soybean by-products commonly used in animal husbandry, namely expeller-extruded soybean meal and solvent-extracted soybean meal and oil. We found that the energy and carbon footprint at farm gate for chicken was 13.6-15.1 GJ/ton LW and 2.03-2.22 ton CO2-eq/ton LW, for pigs in hoop systems 23.2-24.0 GJ/ton LW and 5.14-5.17 ton CO2-eq/ton LW, and for pigs in confinement systems 23.6-24.2 GJ/ton LW and 6.06-6.45 ton CO2-eq/ton LW, respectively. The choice of expeller-extruded soybean meal or solvent-extracted soybean meal and oil as feed ingredients showed small differences on the energy and carbon footprints of chickens and pigs."

B, Analytical technologies in the biomedical and life sciences",2019 05 20,"Residual free-drug-related species that are present in antibody-drug conjugates (ADC) are a potential safety risk to patients and are therefore categorized as a critical quality attribute that must be strictly monitored and controlled. Among the many analytical methods developed for free-drug analysis, reversed-phase liquid chromatography (RP-LC) is the most common approach. Conventional RP-LC methods for free-drug analysis, however, involve labor-intensive sample preparation. Here we present a new RP-LC method to directly analyze free-drug-related species in an ADC sample without the need for sample preparation. In our work, free-drug-related species were very well separated from ADC peaks in the chromatography gradient. Typical performance issues observed in conventional RP-LC, such as column fouling, detection interference, and carryover, were not observed or were negligible with this new method. Three options were evaluated for free-drug quantitation: Strohl (2017) [1] use of an external free drug calibration curve for determination of absolute concentration; Perez et al. (2014) [2] calculation of relative percentage based on peak area ratio between free drug and ADC at a characteristic wavelength unique for drug payload; and (Beck et al., 2017) [3] calculation of relative percentage based on peak area ratio between free drug and corrected ADC peak area (at any wavelength). The method with calibration curve provides the highest sensitivity, the best accuracy and precision for determination of free drug present in the ADC. However, the second and third options were simpler because they eliminated the need for an external calibration curve, making them worth exploring. Due to its simplicity and compatibility with mass spectrometry, the new method is also a good choice for direct analysis of stability samples.",Development and validation of a sensitive LC-MS/MS method for the determination of 6-hydroxykynurenic acid in rat plasma and its application to pharmacokinetics study.,https://www.ncbi.nlm.nih.gov/pubmed/30981181,"Journal of chromatography.

The laminate allows drying of fecal sludge, which might significantly reduce the frequency of container emptying, while containing liquids and solids. While previous laboratory tests demonstrated rapid drying of fecal sludge or water retained in laminates, experiments did not assess the effects of system dimension or scale on performance. In this study fecal sludge drying and water evaporation were evaluated in 3D laminate boxes (decimeter scale) or 3D laminate-lined 40 L and 55 gallon drums (meter scale) that are prototypes of toilet containers for field application. A stagnant film model described fecal sludge drying and water evaporation in the laminate boxes and laminate-lined drums well. The effective diffusion length (λ) for the laminate was fitted in all systems and increased with system dimension and scale: λ increased by a factor of 1.4 from 1D decimeter-scale envelopes to 3D decimeter-scale boxes, and by a factor of 1.3-1.7 from 3D decimeter-scale boxes to 3D meter-scale drums. The longer λ with increasing dimension and scale is likely due to nonuniform temperature and relative humidity in the air outside the laminate and nonuniform temperature within the laminate. Using best-fit λ for the laminate-lined 40 L and 55 gallon drum experiments conducted in a controlled laboratory, drying was predicted for an 11-day field experiment.

Atmospheric moisture was increased indirectly by increasing the sea surface temperature (SST) in the simulation initial conditions, and by letting the regional atmospheric model adjust the atmospheric fields to the SST perturbation. The SST was increased in two ways: 1) using spatially constant increments and 2) using a climate change perturbation field obtained from a climate projection. For each SST scenario, the PD over the target area was maximized by using a physically based storm transposition method. Although the mean PD, that was obtained by averaging over all shifting increments, increased with SST, the maximum PD was obtained for the case of no SST increase. It was found that, in the case of no SST increase, the worst-case tropical cyclone track was significantly different than in the SST increase scenarios. In particular, in this case, the storm spent a longer time in the simulation inner domain, thus spawning a larger PD over the target area.",Opioid overdose deaths and potentially inappropriate opioid prescribing practices (PIP): A spatial epidemiological study.,https://www.ncbi.nlm.nih.gov/pubmed/30981166,The International journal on drug policy,2019 05 26,Opioid overdose deaths quintupled in Massachusetts between 2000 and 2016.

The current study examined the role of corticostriatal recruitment and connectivity in buffering the effect of intergroup bias on costly giving behavior during childhood and adolescence, a period when other-oriented preferences and associated brain functions undergo significant change. During functional magnetic resonance imaging, youth (n = 51; 8-16 years) made decisions that could potentially benefit in-group and out-group peers at a cost to themselves. Youth were more prosocial toward in-group relative to out-group peers, but were relatively more prosocial to out-group peers when there was a greater discrepancy between potential rewards for others over oneself (i.e., higher reward inequity). Although they showed no differences in corticostriatal activation, youth evinced greater connectivity between the ventral striatum (VS) and posterior superior temporal sulcus (pSTS) when considering more inequitable prosocial decisions that favored the outcomes of out-group peers, which attenuated intergroup biases in prosocial behavior. We found no age-related differences at the behavioral or neural level, suggesting that in-group preferences already bias prosocial behavior and its neurocognitive processes by late childhood and do not change across adolescence.",Fabrication of inverse-opal lysozyme-imprinted polydopamine/polypyrrole microspheres with near-infrared-light-controlled release property.,https://www.ncbi.nlm.nih.gov/pubmed/30981163,Journal of colloid and interface science,2019 05 04,"The combination of the molecular imprinting technology and porous materials is a promising way to obtain high-efficient selective adsorption and separation materials for bioactive macromolecules.

This work provides not only a method to prepare novel NIR-light-response inverse-opal macroporous molecularly imprinted microspheres, but also a new perspective on the design of selectively separation materials for the fast, high-efficient recognition and separation of biomacromolecules.","'Scrutinised, judged and sabotaged': A qualitative video diary study of first-time breastfeeding mothers.",https://www.ncbi.nlm.nih.gov/pubmed/30981161,Midwifery,2019 06 15,To explore how support impacted on mothers' breastfeeding experiences in the first few weeks following birth.,Evaluation of angularly condensed diquinothiazines as potential anticancer agents.,https://www.ncbi.nlm.nih.gov/pubmed/30981160,Bioorganic chemistry,2019 05 28,"We present efficient synthesis of isomeric types of angularly fused diquinothiazines in the reactions of 2,2'-dichloro-3,3'-diquinolinyl disulfide and diquinodithiin with 3-, 5-, 6- and 8-aminoquinolines. The pentacyclic diquinothiazine ring systems were identified as diquino[3,2-b;3',4'-e][1,4]thiazine, diquino[3,2-b;5',6'-e][1,4]thiazine, diquino[3,2-b;6',5'-e][1,4]thiazine and diquino[3,2-b;8',7'-e][1,4]thiazine with advanced two-dimensional 1H and 13C NMR techniques (COSY, ROESY, HSQC and HMBC) of N-methyl derivatives. The identification of pentacyclic ring system was confirmed by X-ray diffraction analysis of selected N-alkyl derivatives. The X-ray analysis revealed different spatial structures of the ring system (planar and folded). NH-diquinothiazines were further transformed into N-alkyl and N-dialkylaminoalkyl derivatives. Most of diquinothiazines exhibited significant cancer cell growth inhibition against the human glioblastoma SNB-19, colorectal carcinoma Caco-2, breast cancer MDA-MB-231 and lung cancer A549 cell lines with the IC50 values < 3 µM. This anti-proliferative activity was found to be more than for cisplatin. The most promising compound, 7-dimethylaminopropyldiquino[3,2-b;6',5'-e]thiazine, was used for gene expression analysis by reverse transcription-quantitative real-time PCR (RT-QPCR) method. The expression of H3, TP53, CDKN1A, BCL-2 and BAX genes revealed that this compound inhibited the proliferation in all cells (H3) and activated mitochondrial events of apoptosis (BAX/BCL-2) in two cancer cell lines (SNB-19 and Caco-2).",Tamoxifen has an anti-manic effect but not protect the brain against oxidative stress in an animal model of mania induced by ouabain.,https://www.ncbi.nlm.nih.gov/pubmed/30981159,Journal of psychiatric research,2019 04 26,"Studies have suggested the involvement of oxidative stress in the physiopathology of bipolar disorder. Preclinical data have shown that PKC inhibitors may act as mood-stabilizing agents and protect the brain in animal models of mania. The present study aimed to evaluate the effects of Lithium (Li) or tamoxifen (TMX) on behavioral changes and oxidative stress parameters in an animal model of mania induced by ouabain (OUA). Wistar rats received a single intracerebroventricular (ICV) injection of OUA or artificial cerebrospinal fluid (ACSF). From the day following ICV injection, the rats were treated for seven days with intraperitoneal injections of saline, Li or TMX twice a day. On the 7th day after OUA injection, locomotor activity was measured using the open-field test, and the oxidative stress parameters were evaluated in the hippocampus and frontal cortex of rats. The results showed that OUA induced hyperactivity in rats, which is considered a manic-like behavior. Also, OUA increased lipid peroxidation and oxidative damage to proteins, as well as causing alterations to antioxidant enzymes in the frontal cortex and hippocampus of rats. The Li or TMX treatment reversed the manic-like behavior induced by OUA. Besides, Li, but not TMX, reversed the oxidative damage caused by OUA. These results suggest that the manic-like effects induced by OUA and the antimanic effects of TMX seem not to be related to the oxidative stress.",A factor analytic study of the Childhood Trauma Questionnaire-Short Form in an all-female South African sample with and without HIV infection.,https://www.ncbi.nlm.nih.gov/pubmed/30981158,Child abuse & neglect,2019 05 13,"The Childhood Trauma Questionnaire-Short Form (CTQ-SF) is widely used around the world but no norms have been established for South African users of the CTQ.

In this study, we investigated whether repetition of a cognitive task promoted motor learning. Fifty-one young adults were assigned to either the early, late, or control groups. All participants completed a mouse tracking task in which they manipulated a mouse to track a moving target on a screen. The cursor was rotated 165° in the counterclockwise direction from the actual mouse position, requiring participants to learn how to use a new tool. To determine the task performance, we calculated the distance between the cursor and target position. In addition, to assess the effects of a cognitive task on the progress of motor learning, curve fitting of the learning curves was performed for the total distance. Experiments were conducted as per the following schedule: learning day 1 (L1), learning day 2 (L2: the day after learning day 1), retention day 1 (R1: 2 weeks after learning day 1), and retention day 2 (R2: 4 weeks after learning day 1). Participants underwent mouse tracking for 20 min on L1 and L2 and for 3 min on R1 and R2. As a cognitive task, we adopted the N-back task. The early or late group performed the N-back task for 20 min before performing motor tracking task on L1 or L2, respectively. The control group did not perform the N-back task. Based on curve fitting analysis, it was observed that the rate of change for motor learning in the early group was higher than that in the control group. The retention of motor learning did not differ between all groups.

Organizing the scattered available information on a wide range of potentially effective adsorbents in the removal of chlorophenols is the principal objective of this article. Various adsorbents such as natural materials, waste materials from industries, agricultural by-products and biomass-based activated carbon in the removal of various chlorophenols have been compiled and discussed here. Crucial factors like temperature, solution pH, contact time and initial solution concentration are also reported and discussed here. The π-π dispersion interaction mechanism, hydrogen bonding formation mechanism, and the electron donor-acceptor complex mechanism were proposed for the chlorophenols adsorption onto various adsorbents with the help of current literature. Conclusions have been drawn proposing a few suggestions for future research on mitigating the effect of chlorophenols in the environment.",Synthesis of high-performance hierarchically porous carbons from rice husk for sorption of phenol in the gas phase.,https://www.ncbi.nlm.nih.gov/pubmed/30981143,Journal of environmental management,2019 05 15,"Phenol as a semi-volatile organic compound (SVOC) extensively presents in industrial wastewater. Moreover, it is a main compound of tar existing in the vapor phase from biomass pyrolysis or gasification. So far, most of works on the phenol adsorption by activated carbons have been conducted in the liquid phase. However, the adsorption of phenol in the gas phase has not been reported. This work aims to synthesize the hierarchically porous carbons from the unaltered and pelletized rice husk (RH) via a facile pyrolysis followed by the ball-milling-assisted KOH activation. Herein, the silica nanoparticles in RH acted as a self-template to remarkably increase specific surface areas and pores, thereby giving rise to the formation of hierarchically porous carbons, which showed a relatively high adsorption capacity (maximum value: 1919 mg/g) of phenol in the vapor phase. Generally, the process of phenol adsorption onto porous carbons in the gas phase followed with various interactions, including pore ﬁlling, electrostatic interaction, hydrophobic effect, and functional groups effect (e.g., π-π interaction). And the pseudo-second-order model could well describe the adsorption kinetic. It is noted that the pelletized RH was more favorable to develop the porous carbons with the hierarchically meso-microporous structures that could enhance the transfer of the phenol molecules via the outer layer and subsequent uptake by the adsorption sites on the inner layer. Further, the SVOC phenol was hard to volatilize under ambient conditions due to its relatively higher boiling point (181.7 °C), so the thermal desorption was a potential way to regenerate the spent activated biochars.",Willingness to pay for protection from storm surge damages under climate change in Halifax Regional Municipality.,https://www.ncbi.nlm.nih.gov/pubmed/30981142,Journal of environmental management,2019 05 15,"Climate change poses risks to coastal cities due to sea-level rise and changes in storm surge. Using the contingent valuation method and payment card format, this paper seeks to estimate residents of Halifax Regional Municipality's willingness to pay (WTP) for protection from flooding impacts from storm surge. The contribution of this study is the application of this method in a previously unstudied region, to understand individuals' perception of risk and WTP to avoid damage, in order to inform policy aimed at protecting against damage due to sea-level rise and storm surge. WTP is estimated without and with the expectation of future climate change, and also for public vs. private goods. Data is analyzed and compared using OLS, Heckman two-step and Tobit Interval regression models. Results suggest that on average, WTP is roughly $12 per month per household over a ten-year period without the expectation of climate change, and roughly $13 per month per household assuming climate change will have negative impacts in the region. Individuals are most often willing to pay to protect against damages to public infrastructure, as well as power outages. Income and education do not play a major role in individuals WTP. Vulnerability to flooding and level of concern related to risky events have a statistically significant impact on WTP in all models, and gender and age have an impact on WTP in some models.",Technical and economic investigation of chemical scrubber and bio-filtration in removal of H2S and NH3 from wastewater treatment plant.,https://www.ncbi.nlm.nih.gov/pubmed/30981141,Journal of environmental management,2019 05 15,"A detailed techno-economic comparison of a chemical scrubber (CS) and a bio-filter (BF) was conducted over a 45-day time period at a municipal wastewater treatment plant (WWTP), Yazd city. The assessment of emissions quantity indicated that odor emissions from the Yazd WWPT mainly consist of hydrogen sulfide (H2S) and ammonia (NH3). It was also found that odor gaseous loading changes corresponding to water consumption pattern in society (R2 = 0.922) for H2S and (R2 = 0.978) for NH3. The highest level of 25 and 3 ppm for H2S and NH3, respectively were detected at specific times during the day. The BF system was continuously supplied with Yazd WWPT's off-gas treatment while the CS was only examined at the times during the day when the gas emissions are at the highest level. The removal efficiency of NH3 and H2S were found to be affected by their respective loading rate. Additionally, among the various oxidants examined in the CS, the NaOCl solution showed the best results in terms of removal efficiency and compatibility. The experiment revealed almost complete removal of NH3 while the H2S removal efficiency remained above 95% for both systems regardless of the operating conditions. This study clearly demonstrates the effectiveness of both systems in treating actual waste gases containing H2S and NH3. By comparing the gas loading rate of both systems and considering limitations of the BF system, the CS seems to be more efficient applicable odor control technology from a technical viewpoint. From the economic viewpoint, comparisons revealed that chemical usage and operating expenses were costly parts of the CS and the BF, respectively. The economic indexes of 1.58 €.m-3. h-1 and 2.57 €.m-3. h-1 were obtained for the BF and CS, respectively, reflecting cost-effectiveness of the BF system.",Electrochemical degradation of oxytetracycline by Ti-Sn-Sb/γ-Al2O3 three-dimensional electrodes.,https://www.ncbi.nlm.nih.gov/pubmed/30981140,Journal of environmental management,2019 05 15,"In this work, Ti-Sn-Sb/γ-Al2O3 particle electrodes were prepared and employed for the degradation of oxytetracycline (OTC) by three-dimensional electrocatalytic technology. Factors associated with the preparation of Ti-Sn-Sb/γ-Al2O3 particle electrodes were investigated. The effects of initial concentration, conductivity, pH value, aeration intensity, current density, plate spacing, and particle electrode dosage on OTC removal were studied. The removal rate of OTC and total organic carbon were achieved approximately 92.0% and 41.0% under the optimal operating condition, respectively. In addition, Ti-Sn-Sb/γ-Al2O3 particle electrode was analyzed by Fourier Transform Infrared spectroscopy (FT-IR), scanning electron microscope (SEM), energy dispersive spectrum analysis (EDX), X-Ray Fluorescence Spectrometer (XRF), and X Ray Diffraction analysis (XRD), which indicated that a significant amount of TiO2, SnO2, and Sb2O3 were formed on the surface of Ti-Sn-Sb/γ-Al2O3 particle electrode. It was also observed that the primary function of Ti-Sn-Sb/γ-Al2O3 particle electrode in the three-dimensional electrode electrolysis process is the strong oxidizing function of ·OH for degrading OTC. Consequently, the analysis of degradation products of oxytetracycline (OTC) demonstrates. In addition, the results and conclusions of this study provide a methodological basis and engineering practice basis for removing the low concentration of antibiotics in water.",Testing of new stormwater pollution build-up algorithms informed by a genetic programming approach.,https://www.ncbi.nlm.nih.gov/pubmed/30981139,Journal of environmental management,2019 05 15,"Pollution build-up and wash-off processes are often included in urban stormwater quality models. However, these models are often unreliable and have poor performance at large scales and in complicated catchments. This study tried to improve stormwater quality models by adopting the genetic programming (GP) approach to generate new build-up algorithms for three different pollutants (total suspend solids - TSS, total phosphorus - TP and total nitrogen - TN). This was followed by testing of the new models (also traditional build-up and wash-off models as benchmark) using data collected from different catchments in Australia and the USA. The GP approach informed new sets of build-up algorithms with the inclusion of not just the typical antecedent dry weather period (ADWP), but also other less 'traditional' variables - previous rainfall depth for TSS and maximum air temperatures for TP and TN simulation. The traditional models had relatively poor performance (Nash-Sutcliffe coefficient, E < 0.0), except for TP at Gilby Road (GR) (E = 0.21 in calibration and 0.43 in validation). Improved performance was observed using the models with new build-up algorithms informed by GP. Taking TP at GR for example, the best performing model had E of 0.46 in calibration and 0.54 in validation. The best performing models for TSS, TP, and TN are often different, suggesting that specific models shall be used for different pollutants. Insights into further improvements possible for stormwater quality models were given. It is recommended that in addition to the typical build-up and wash-off process, new generations of stormwater quality models should be able to account for the non-conventional pollutant sources (e.g. cross-connections, septic tank leakage, illegal discharges) through stochastic approaches. Emission inventories with information like intensity-frequency-duration (IFD) of pollutant loads from each type of non-conventional source are suggested to be built for stochastic modelling.",Elastic compliance as a tool to understand Hofmeister ion specific effect in DMPC liposomes.,https://www.ncbi.nlm.nih.gov/pubmed/30981138,Biophysical chemistry,2019 05 03,"Elastic compliance of DMPC liposomes with Hofmeister electrolytes: NaCl, Na2SO4, Na2CO3, NaNO3, KCl and MgCl2 studied using Quartz crystal microbalance with dissipation has been correlated with changes in their lamellar spacing from SAXS. The study suggests that hydration water of the different ions has an effect on the overall packing of the lipid bilayer that results as either a dehydrated liposome or where water smears the surface of the liposomes. Ratio of hydrogen bonded carbonyl and phosphate of polar region of the liposomes from ATR-FTIR spectroscopy, suggests that the polar groups are less hydrated due to the displacement of water by the electrolytes compared to pure DMPC and ordered in the sequence for cations as: K+ < Na+,Mg2+ and for anions as SO42- < CO32- < Cl- < NO3-. These findings show the usefulness of Elastic compliance for structural studies of composite phospholipid bilayers, lipid-protein complexes and lipid systems of reduced dimensionalities."

Carbon-enriched biochar (BC) has been widely used to overcome the limitations of nZVI and improve its reaction with environmental pollutants. This work reviews the preparation of nZVI/BC nanocomposites; the effects of BC as a supporting matrix on the nZVI crystallite size, dispersion, and oxidation and electron transfer capacity; and its interaction mechanisms with contaminants. The literature review suggests that the properties and preparation conditions of BC (e.g., pore structure, functional groups, feedstock composition, and pyrogenic temperature) play important roles in the manipulation of nZVI properties. This review discusses the interactions of nZVI/BC composites with heavy metals, nitrates, and organic compounds in soil and water. Overall, BC contributes to the removal of contaminants because it can attenuate contaminants on the surface of nZVI/BC; it also enhances electron transfer from nZVI to target contaminants owing to its good electrical conductivity and improves the crystallite size and dispersion of nZVI. This review is intended to provide insights into methods of optimizing nZVI/BC synthesis and maximizing the efficiency of nZVI in environmental cleanup.","Development of a detector for the measurement of ambient dose equivalent, H∗(10) at low and medium photon energies.",https://www.ncbi.nlm.nih.gov/pubmed/30981126,"Applied radiation and isotopes : including data, instrumentation and methods for use in agriculture, industry and medicine",2019 05 07,"Ionization chambers are used as secondary standards for the dosimetric measurement of photon radiation as the current generated in it are directly proportional to the conventional true value of the monitoring quantity (i.e. air kerma, dose or ambient dose equivalent).

With the mentioned existing illuminator in INUS imaging facility, the thermal neutron flux at the exit of collimator was measured 7.2 × 104 n/cm2/s. Also the obtained neutron beam profile in this facility shows that it is not completely uniform at the imaging screen and the intensity of neutrons at the top and bottom of beam profile are not the same. Hence, in this paper a new graphite illuminator is proposed to improve the neutron beam characteristics in INUS imaging facility. Monte Carlo N-Particle (MCNP) code was implemented in this study for evaluating the proposed illuminator. The shape of proposed illuminator is a cylinder whose one side is inclined. Three quality factors of thermal neutron intensity, thermal neutron beam uniformity and gamma radiation dose rate were used to evaluate performance of the new illuminator. In order to obtain optimum illuminator shape, three effective parameters of thickness, angle of inclined side and position of the illuminator inside the collimator were investigated in this research.

Often, there is an initial good response to a newly introduced AED, which may last up to months, eventually followed by the return of seizures thought to be due to the development of tolerance. We introduce a framework within which the interplay between AED response and brain networks can be explored to understand the development of tolerance. We use a computer model for seizure generation in the context of dynamic networks, which allows us to generate an 'in silico' electroencephalogram (EEG). This allows us to study the effect of changes in excitability network structure and intrinsic model properties on the overall seizure likelihood. Within this framework, tolerance to AEDs - return of seizure-like activity - may occur in 3 different scenarios: 1) the efficacy of the drug diminishes while the brain network remains relatively constant; 2) the efficacy of the drug remains constant, but connections between brain regions change; 3) the efficacy of the drug remains constant, but the intrinsic excitability within brain regions varies dynamically. We argue that these latter scenarios may contribute to a deeper understanding of how drug resistance to AEDs may occur.",Can short-term video-EEG substitute long-term video-EEG monitoring in psychogenic nonepileptic seizures?

In this regard, AGSs were sieved into 6 levels: 0∼0.5, 0.5∼0.7, 0.7∼1, 1∼1.2, 1.2∼1.7 mm and larger than 1.7 mm, then filtrated by a small dead-end filtration cell. Interestingly, there appeared a critical AGS size (1∼1.2 mm) for membrane fouling. Above 1.2 mm, flux increased and fouling reduced with size, due to the loose cake layer and high permeability caused by larger AGS. Below 1 mm, for smaller AGS, higher flux and lower fouling appeared, because less extracellular polymeric substance (EPS) formed and adhered onto AGS foulants. In the critical size, membrane fouling was serious to the most extent, on account of the dual role of the compact structure of cake fouling layer and the adhesion of EPS. Moreover, this critical AGS size also possessed the highest cake layer, pore blocking and irreversible fouling, which generally existed in various operational conditions. Besides, the results of SEM, AFM, hydrophilicity and ATR-FTIR also proved that the existence of the maximum membrane fouling at the critical AGS size. This study provides a deep understanding of the membrane fouling mechanisms of AGS in membrane filtration and is beneficial for developing a new membrane fouling mitigation strategy by terms of regulating AGS size.","Health risk of phthalates in water environment: Occurrence in water resources, bottled water, and tap water, and burden of disease from exposure through drinking water in tehran, Iran.",https://www.ncbi.nlm.nih.gov/pubmed/30981118,Environmental research,2019 05 13,"Occurrence of phthalates in water resources, bottled water, and tap water, and health risk of exposure to the phthalates through drinking water in Tehran, Iran, 2018 were studied.

The disability-adjusted life years (DALYs) and DALY rate (per 100,000 people) attributable to DEHP intake through drinking water for all ages both sexes combined were estimated to be 6.385 (uncertainty interval: UI 95% 1.892 to 22.133), and 0.073 (0.022-0.255), respectively. The proportion of mortality in the attributable DALYs was over 96%. The attributable DALY rate exhibited no significant difference by sex, but was considerably affected by age in a manner that the DALY rates ranged from 0.052 (0.015-0.175) in the age group 65 y plus to 0.099 (0.026-0.304) in the age group 5 to 9 y. Both the carcinogenic and non-carcinogenic health risks of the phthalates in drinking water were considered to be very low. The results can also be of importance in terms of developing frameworks to expand the domain of burden of disease study to the other environmental risks.",Wildland firefighter smoke exposure and risk of lung cancer and cardiovascular disease mortality.,https://www.ncbi.nlm.nih.gov/pubmed/30981117,Environmental research,2019 05 13,"Wildland firefighters are exposed to wood smoke, which contains hazardous air pollutants, by suppressing thousands of wildfires across the U. S. each year. We estimated the relative risk of lung cancer and cardiovascular disease mortality from existing PM2.5 exposure-response relationships using measured PM4 concentrations from smoke and breathing rates from wildland firefighter field studies across different exposure scenarios. To estimate the relative risk of lung cancer (LC) and cardiovascular disease (CVD) mortality from exposure to PM2.5 from smoke, we used an existing exposure-response (ER) relationship. We estimated the daily dose of wildfire smoke PM2.5 from measured concentrations of PM4, estimated wildland firefighter breathing rates, daily shift duration (hours per day) and frequency of exposure (fire days per year and career duration). Firefighters who worked 49 days per year were exposed to a daily dose of PM4 that ranged from 0.15 mg to 0.74 mg for a 5- and 25-year career, respectively. The daily dose for firefighters working 98 days per year of PM4 ranged from 0.30 mg to 1.49 mg. Across all exposure scenarios (49 and 98 fire days per year) and career durations (5-25 years), we estimated that wildland firefighters were at an increased risk of LC (8 percent to 43 percent) and CVD (16 percent to 30 percent) mortality. This unique approach assessed long term health risks for wildland firefighters and demonstrated that wildland firefighters have an increased risk of lung cancer and cardiovascular disease mortality.",Vitamin K2-Dependent GGCX and MGP Are Required for Homeostatic Calcium Regulation of Sperm Maturation.,https://www.ncbi.nlm.nih.gov/pubmed/30981116,iScience,2019 05 02,"A low-calcium microenvironment is essential for spermatozoa to mature in the epididymis; however, it remains unclear how dysregulation of epididymal luminal calcium is associated with male infertility. Using a warfarin-induced vitamin K2 deficiency rat model, we found that vitamin-K-dependent γ-glutamyl carboxylase (GGCX) and matrix Gla protein (MGP) were essential in extracellular calcium signaling of the intercellular communication required for epididymal sperm maturation. We found that GGCX and MGP co-localized in the vesicular structures of epididymal cells and spermatozoa. Calcium-regulated MGP binds to proteins in a biphasic manner; sub-millimolar calcium enhances, whereas excessive calcium inhibits, the binding. Bioinformatic analysis of the calcium-dependent MGP-bound proteome revealed that vesicle-mediated transport and membrane trafficking underlie the intercellular communication networks. We also identified an SNP mutation, rs699664, in the GGCX gene of infertile men with asthenozoospermia. Overall, we revealed that the GGCX-MGP system is integrated with the intercellular calcium signaling to promote sperm maturation."

Nonetheless, the expression patterns, biological function, and potential mechanisms in SNHG16 in pancreatic cancer (PC) remain rarely known. An increase in expression of SNHG16 in PC samples against adjacent normal tissues was shown here. Increased SNHG16 was linked intimately to the tumor-node-metastasis (TNM) stage, distant metastasis, tumor differentiation, and poor overall survival. Loss-of-function experiments revealed that SNHG16 knockdown suppressed the proliferation, formation of colonies, ability to migrate and invade in vitro, along with a lowered growth of the tumor in a mouse model. Mechanistically, SNHG16 might serve as a sponge competitive endogenous RNA (ceRNA) for miR-218-5p, thereby playing a role in regulating the expression of high mobility group box 1 (HMGB1) expression, a known direct miR-218-5p target in PC cells.

The recently-reported, uncultivated genome-species of Chlorobi have not suggested any alteration in the dichotomy of the two classes, but have hypothesized the existence of a distinct, aerobic and photoheterotrophic, order/family level lineage within Chlorobia, which otherwise was considered to be a monophyletic group of anaerobic sulfur-photolithoautotrophs. Here we report the discovery of a novel population genome bin (named Chlorobi-445) from the combined metagenomes of three spatially-contiguous but visually-distinct microbial mats growing along the 65-41 °C hydrothermal gradient of a boron-rich microbialite spring located in the Puga geothermal area of Eastern Ladakh, India. 1.3, 8.2 and 3.8% metagenomic reads from the mat communities located at 65 °C, 52 °C and 41 °C sample-sites respectively, were found to map-back to the 2,809,852 bp genome of Chlorobi-445. Phylogenomically, and therefore in terms of potential metabolic attributes, Chlorobi-445 showed close relationship with Ca. Thermochlorobacter aerophilum. Gene content suggested Chlorobi-445 to be an aerobic photoorganoheterotroph. Although this new lineage encodes all the proteins necessary for the biosynthesis of bacteriochlorophylls and the photosynthetic reaction centre, it is potentially devoid of genes concerned with lithotrophic sulfur oxidation and carbon-fixation. Individual Chlorobi phylogenies based on the sequence similarities of 16S rRNA genes, 22 ribosomal proteins, and 56 conserved marker-proteins that are encoded from single-copy genes, unanimously suggested that the class Chlorobia encompasses two major branches/clades. Whereas the Clade-I is a homogeneous cluster of culturable, anaerobic sulfur-/iron-oxidizing photolithoautotrophs, Clade-II harbors (i) Chloroherpeton species, and (ii) uncultivated aerobic photoheterotrophs such as Chlorobi-445, Chlorobium sp. GBChlB &Ca. T. aerophilum, in its two sub-clades. Distribution of bioenergetic attributes over the different branches of Chlorobi, together with the aerobic chemoorganoheterotrophic nature of the deepest-branching genome-species NICIL-2, indicated that the early Chlorobi were aerobic chemoorganoheterotrophs, while anaerobicity, phototrophy, lithotrophy, and autotrophy were all potentially added in the course of evolution.",Higher variability in cervical force perception in people with neck pain.,https://www.ncbi.nlm.nih.gov/pubmed/30981102,Musculoskeletal science & practice,2019 06 16,A reduced capacity to generate and sustain cervical muscle force over a range of contraction intensities is a feature of some participants with neck pain.

In this paper, the Grand Canonical Monte Carlo was used to simulate the adsorption performance of activated carbon on VOCs (benzene, toluene, acetone and methanol). After simulating different pore sizes (0.902 nm,1.997 nm,3 nm and 4 nm) adsorption performances of activated carbon, activated carbon with a pore size of 1.997 nm was selected to further study the influence of functional groups (carboxyl, amino, hydroxyl and hydrogen), and the capillary condensation was explained by the Kelvin equation. Furthermore, effects of functional groups under saturated vapor pressure (P0) of VOCs that range from 0 to 0.1 P0 were explained by the accessible volume and intermolecular interaction potential, respectively. Under pressure range of 0-0.1 P0, at the beginning of adsorption of acetone and methanol, carboxyl and amino groups could reduce the threshold pressure while hydroxyl and hydrogen have the opposite effect. For benzene and toluene, all functional groups have little effect on the threshold pressure, and they reduce the adsorption capacity instead. It could be concluded that the activated carbon could achieve the best adsorption effect on acetone and methanol, on the contrary, the addition of functional groups on benzene and toluene will weaken their adsorption performance.",Changes in fluorescent dissolved organic matter and their association with phytoavailable phosphorus in soil amended with TiO2 nanoparticles.,https://www.ncbi.nlm.nih.gov/pubmed/30981099,Chemosphere,2019 05 13,"This study presents the impacts of TiO2 nanoparticles (TNPs) amendment on plant growth, phosphorus (P) content, and dissolved organic matter (DOM) composition in the rhizosphere. For this work, wheat plants (Galaxy-2013) were exposed to soil amended by different amounts of TNPs (i.e., 0, 50, and 100 mg TNP/kg of soil) for 40 days and harvested. The maximum increase in the shoots and roots lengths reached 15.9 ± 0.3% and 3.8 ± 0.3% respectively, which was concurrent with improved P content in the plants. Compared with the control, the P content in the shoots and roots was enriched by 23.4% and 17.9% at 50 mg TNP/kg of soil respectively. The increased electrical conductivity (EC) and decreased pH of the rhizosphere implied that the added TNPs might induce the enhancement of the P dissolution. Fluorescence spectroscopy revealed the increase of microbial activity as depicted by the humification index (HIX) changing from 0.88 ± 0.02 to 0.92 ± 0.01, with increasing TNPs amendments. Excitation-emission matrix coupled with parallel factor analysis (EEM-PARAFAC) showed the presence of four fluorescent components (C1 to C4) in the rhizosphere. Three of them (C1-C3) were related to humic-like substances, while the C4 was associated with protein-like fluorescence. EEM-PARAFAC results revealed the degradation of C4, and the enhancement of the other three components, which supported the stimulation of microbial activity by the TNPs amendment. This study provided new insights into the relation between improved phytoavailble P in plants and the changes in the rhizosphere soil solution chemistry and the DOM composition upon TNPs amendments.",First insight into human extrahepatic metabolism of flame retardants: Biotransformation of EH-TBB and Firemaster-550 components by human skin subcellular fractions.,https://www.ncbi.nlm.nih.gov/pubmed/30981098,Chemosphere,2019 05 13,"2-ethylhexyl-2,3,4,5-tetrabromobenzoate (EH-TBB) and a mixture of EH-TBB, Bis(2-ethylhexyl)tetrabromphthalate (BEH-TEBP) and Triphenyl phosphate (TPhP), prepared in a ratio similar to the Firemaster-550™ (FM550) flame retardant formulation, were exposed to human skin subcellular fractions (S9) to evaluate their dermal in vitro metabolism for the first time. After 60 min of incubation, tetrabromobenzoic acid (TBBA) and diphenyl phosphate (DPhP) were identified as the major metabolites of EH-TBB and TPhP, respectively using UPLC-Q-Exactive Orbitrap™-MS analysis. Dermal biotransformation of EH-TBB and TPhP was catalyzed by skin carboxylesterases rather than CYP450 enzymes, while no stable metabolites could be identified for BEH-TEBP. Metabolite formation rates of EH-TBB as individual compound and as a component of FM550 fitted the Michaelis-Menten model, while no steady state could be reached for TPhP under experimental conditions. Estimated maximum metabolic rate (Vmax) for TBBA formation upon exposure to FM550 was lower than Vmax for EH-TBB (1.08 and 15.2 pmol min-1 mg protein-1, respectively). This indicates dermal metabolism would contribute less to the clearance of EH-TBB body burden than hepatic metabolism (Vmax = 644 pmol min-1 mg protein-1). Implications for human exposure include EH-TBB accumulation in skin tissue and human exposure to dermal metabolic products, which may have different toxicokinetic and toxicodynamic parameters than parent flame retardants.",Cardiopulmonary coupling analysis predicts early treatment response in depressed patients: A pilot study.,https://www.ncbi.nlm.nih.gov/pubmed/30981097,Psychiatry research,2019 05 28,"This pilot study evaluated the effect of anti-depression treatment on sleep quality and symptoms of depression in patients with major depressive disorder, and identified cardiopulmonary coupling (CPC) indices for predicting early response. Forty-one Han Chinese patients with major depressive disorder were assessed for objective sleep quality before treatment (baseline) and at 2 weeks using CPC. Subjective sleep quality and depression levels were measured at baseline and 2 and 4 weeks after treatment, using the 24-item Hamilton Rating Scale for Depression (HAMD-24), Epworth Sleepiness Scale (ESS), and Pittsburgh Sleep Quality Index (PSQI). Objective and subjective sleep quality, and depression symptoms, improved after treatment. Significant correlations were found between CPC variables at baseline and depression symptom improvement after 2 weeks of treatment. Total sleep time at baseline significantly correlated with somnipathy score reduction at week 2. Total in-bed time at week 2 significantly correlated with reductions in anxiety/somatic symptoms and retardation score, and total HAMD-24 score at week 4. In binary logistic regression, the total in-bed time at baseline was significantly associated with treatment response. Our findings suggest that objective sleep quality measured by CPC analysis is useful for predicting treatment response to antidepressant treatment in patients with major depressive disorder.","Obsessive-compulsive symptoms in patients with schizophrenia: Relationships with olanzapine pharmacological parameters, psychopathology, and quality of life.",https://www.ncbi.nlm.nih.gov/pubmed/30981095,Psychiatry research,2019 05 28,"Obsessive-compulsive symptoms (OCS) occur in a substantial portion of schizophrenia patients and have significant impacts on clinical course. This study was intended to investigate the relationships of OCS with pharmacological parameters of olanzapine, psychopathology, and quality of life. Totally 151 schizophrenia patients were recruited, and rated using Yale-Brown Obsessive-Compulsive scale (YBOCS), Positive and Negative Syndrome Scale (PANSS), Montgomery-Åsberg Depression Rating Scale (MADRS), and World Health Organization Questionnaire on Quality of Life: Short Form (WHOQOL-BREF). The concentrations of olanzapine and N-desmethylolanzapine were determined by HPLC. Twenty-five patients (16.6%) revealed the presence of OCS. OCS group had significantly higher olanzapine dose, more numbers of past hospitalizations, higher PANSS total, positive, negative, and general psychopathology scores, and higher MADRS score than those in non-OCS group. The WHOQOL-BREF physical subscale score in schizophrenia patients with OCS was significantly lower. Olanzapine dose, PANSS score, and MADRS score were significantly correlated with YBOCS score. Our findings highlight that OCS is highly prevalent in schizophrenia patients under olanzapine treatment, especially those at high doses. Schizophrenia patients with OCS had higher severity of psychotic and depressive symptoms and poorer quality of life. Clinicians should monitor OCS in patients with schizophrenia receiving olanzapine treatment."

Increasing evidence connects this immunosuppression to nitric oxide (NO), as NO production is a classic feature of inflammation probably through neutrophil activation and migration. Nitrated fatty acids (NFA) such as 10-nitrooleate (OA-NO2), nitrolinoleic acid etc. produced endogenously by the non-enzymatic reaction of NO with unsaturated fatty acids, are found to be potent activators of the transcription factor, peroxisome proliferator-activated receptor gamma (PPARγ). Upregulation of PPARγ during immunosuppression and the subsequent inhibition of neutrophil migration in sepsis have been reported. However, the interplay of OA-NO2, NO and PPARγ in polymicrobial-induced immunosuppression has not been established. Hence to understand this, we have studied the role of OA-NO2 in blood PMNs migration, the effects of iNOS inhibitor on PMNs migration and PPARγ activity in cecal ligation and puncture (CLP)-induced sepsis in mice. We found increased expression of PPARγ and its DNA-binding activity in the lungs and blood PMNs from CLP mice. CLP or OA-NO2 treatment inhibited PMNs' migration in response to fMLP stimulation. Pharmacological inhibition of iNOS resulted in decreased PPARγ DNA-binding activity with a concomitant increase in the migration of PMNs to the site of infection. OA-NO2 treatment also inhibited the production of inflammatory cytokines (TNFα and IL-1β) secretion from PMNs stimulated with lipopolysaccharide. We have also established that, OA-NO2 mediated inhibition of PMNs migration in vivo and ex vivo are regulated through PPARγ-dependent pathway. This study further highlights the fact that the activation of PPARγ by the NFA has a pivotal role in PMNs' migration and immunosuppression.",Long non-coding RNA highly up-regulated in liver cancer protects tumor necrosis factor-alpha-induced inflammatory injury by down-regulation of microRNA-101 in ATDC5 cells.,https://www.ncbi.nlm.nih.gov/pubmed/30981080,International immunopharmacology,2019 05 28,"Osteoarthritis (OA) is a familiar joint degenerative disease.

Peroxisome proliferator-activated receptor γ (PPAR-γ) activators display anti-inflammatory and anti-degeneration roles in osteoarthritis and rheumatoid arthritis. However, the expression level of PPAR-γ and related regulatory mechanisms in the nucleus pulposus tissues are not clear. Herein we report that PPAR-γ was down-regulated both in the nucleus pulposus tissue of intervertebral disc degeneration patient and in the cultured nucleus pulposus cells stimulated with IL-17. This study was undertaken to investigate the potential therapeutic effect of pioglitazone, as a PPAR-γ ligand, and its underlying molecular mechanism in IL-17-induced human intervertebral disc degeneration model in vitro. Our results indicate that pioglitazone administration suppressed the production of pro-inflammatory cytokines and down-regulated the mRNA expression levels of inflammatory mediators in the cultured human nucleus pulposus cells and tissue. Consistently, pioglitazone decreased the levels of metalloproteinase and maintained the expression of critical matrix components, such as aggrecan and type II collagen. Moreover, the activation of NF-κB signaling in the nucleus pulposus tissue during the intervertebral disc degeneration development was antagonized by pioglitazone administration.

However, the effects of SSa on liver injury have not been reported. In the present study, we evaluated the protective effects and mechanisms of SSa on lipopolysaccharide (LPS)/d‑galactosamine (D-GalN)-induced liver injury. The mice were pretreated with SSa 1 h before LPS/D-GalN treatment. The liver MPO, MDA, and the serum AST and ALT levels were tested by specific determination kits. The pro-inflammatory cytokines TNF-α and IL-1β were tested by ELISA kits. The expression of NF-κB signaling pathway and LXRα were tested by western blot analysis. The results showed that SSa significantly reduced the levels of liver MPO, MDA, and serum AST, ALT levels induced by LPS/D-GalN. SSa also dose-dependently inhibited LPS/D-GalN-induced pro-inflammatory cytokines TNF-α and IL-1β production. Furthermore, we found that SSa inhibited NF-κB signaling pathway activation induced by LPS/D-GalN. In addition, SSa dose-dependently increased the expression of LXRα. In conclusion, the results demonstrated that SSa had protective effect on liver injury and the anti-inflammatory mechanisms of SSa on LPS/D-GalN-induced liver injury may be due to its ability to increase LXRα expression.

We used transcranial direct current stimulation (tDCS) to stimulate left parietal areas and functional Magnetic Resonance Imaging (fMRI) to measure object-related neural responses in the ventral stream. We find that representational geometries and category discriminability within ventral temporal cortex, as well as functional connectivity between ventral temporal and parietal areas, are enhanced by anodal compared to cathodal stimulation of left parietal associative cortex.

It also examined the single and combined effects of three of the most toxic substances on microalgal physiology. Single substances were first tested on each microalgal species to determine their respective EC50 and concentration-response relationships. The toxicity of six and seven binary mixtures was then evaluated in microplate experiments on the growth of T. lutea and S. marinoi, respectively, using two mixture modelling approaches: isobolograms and the MIXTOX tool, based on Concentration Addition (CA) or Independent Action (IA) models. Significant cases of antagonism (for both species) and synergism (for S. marinoi) were observed for the mixtures of isoproturon and spiroxamine, and isoproturon and metazachlor, respectively. These two mixtures, together with that of isoproturon and diuron, for which additivity was observed, were further studied for their impacts on the physiology of each species. Exposures were thus made in culture flasks at three concentrations, or concentration combinations for mixtures, selected to cause 25%, 50% and 75% growth rate inhibition. The effects of the selected pesticides singly and in combination were evaluated at three perceived effect concentrations on esterase metabolic activity, relative lipid content, cytoplasmic membrane potential and reactive oxygen species (ROS) content by flow cytometry, and on photosynthetic quantum yield (ϕ'M) by PAM-fluorescence. Isoproturon and diuron singly and in mixtures induced 20-40% decreases in ϕ'M which was in turn responsible for a significant decrease in relative lipid content for both species. Spiroxamine and metazachlor were individually responsible for an increase in relative lipid content (up to nearly 300% for metazachlor on S. marinoi), as well as cell depolarization and increased ROS content. The mixture of isoproturon and metazachlor tested on S. marinoi caused a 28-34% decrease in ϕ'M that was significantly higher than levels induced by each of substances when tested alone. This strong decrease in ϕ'M could be due to a combined effect of these substances on the photosynthetic apparatus, which is likely the cause of the synergy found for this mixture.",Performance on management strategies with Class I Recommendation and A Level of Evidence among hospitalized patients with non-ST-segment elevation acute coronary syndrome in China: Findings from the Improving Care for Cardiovascular Disease in China-Acute Coronary Syndrome (CCC-ACS) project.,https://www.ncbi.nlm.nih.gov/pubmed/30981036,American heart journal,2019 05 25,This study aimed to examine hospital performance on evidence-based management strategies for non-ST-segment elevation acute coronary syndrome (NSTE-ACS) and variations across hospitals.,"Comparative effectiveness, safety, and costs of rivaroxaban and warfarin among morbidly obese patients with atrial fibrillation.",https://www.ncbi.nlm.nih.gov/pubmed/30981035,American heart journal,2019 05 25,There are limited data regarding clinical outcomes and healthcare resource utilization of direct oral anticoagulants (DOACs) in patients with atrial fibrillation (AF) who are morbidly obese (body mass index >40 kg/m2 or body weight >120 kg).,A quasi-experimental evaluation of partnerships for success's impact on community-level ethanol and prescription drug poisoning rates.,https://www.ncbi.nlm.nih.gov/pubmed/30981034,Addictive behaviors,2019 06 01,"The emerging dual threats of underaged drinking (UAD) and prescription drug misuse (PDM) require sustained prevention efforts across multiple levels of interventions. In response to the continuing proliferation of UAD and PDM among youth and young adults, the Substance Abuse and Mental Health Services Administration (SAMHSA) developed the Partnerships for Success (PFS) program. Across five cohorts funded from 2012 to 2016, PFS created linkages between health care providers, treatment and prevention services providers, government agencies, and nonprofit organizations for the delivery of multiple sets of services (e.g., prevention education, community activities, screening) targeted toward UAD and PDM. This paper reports on the impact of the PFS program on reductions in ethanol and prescription drug poisoning exposures as reported from data in the National Poisoning Data System (NPDS). Across 35 States, communities targeted by PFS interventions were compared to non-targeted communities using a non-equivalent comparison groups design and propensity score weighting. Using propensity-weighted, multilevel latent growth modeling, steeper reductions in ethanol and prescription drug poisoning exposure call rates were observed in States which had a higher proportion of communities participating in PFS. Grantee-level longitudinal analogs to Cohen's d effect sizes ranged from -0.24 to -0.97, whereas PFS' effects on individual communities (net of Statewide effects) were negligible.

Delay in diagnosing breast cancer is a unique multidisciplinary phenomenon involving primary care physicians, gynecologists, radiologists, pathologists, and general surgeons. The New York medical malpractice court system remains among the most active court systems in the country. The purpose of this study is to analyze the characteristics of medical malpractice litigation involving breast cancer in New York for the past 10 years. Jury verdicts and settlements from 2007 to 2017 were obtained from a computerized legal database and were analyzed. Data pertaining to defendants, plaintiffs, case outcomes, allegations, and verdicts were collected. The study identified 48 cases of litigation pertaining to breast cancer. Overall, 14 of the verdicts were won by defendants (46.7%). Among the plaintiffs' verdicts and settlements, the median payout was $1.8 million (mean $2.9) overall, $2.6 million (mean $4.3) for verdicts alone, and $1.68 million (mean $1.9) for settlements. The most commonly named specialty among the defendants was radiology (32) and the second was surgery (15). Inappropriate workup of mammography findings was alleged in 18 cases. The average delay to diagnosis was 13.4 months (sd 7.1). Fourteen cases involved diagnosis at stage 4, nine cases at stage 3, and fifteen at stage 2. The average verdict payout was more than two times higher than the average settlement payout.

Here we present three crystal structures of the CopC protein from Pseudomonas fluorescens (Pf-CopC) that include the wild type protein bound to Cu(II) and two variant proteins, where Cu(II) coordinating ligands were mutated, in Cu-free states. We show that the Cu(II) atom in Pf-CopC is coordinated by two His residues, an Asp residue and the N-terminus of the protein (therefore a 3N + O site). This coordination structure is consistent with all structurally characterized proteins from the CopC family to date. Structural and sequence analyses of the CopC family allow a relationship between protein sequence and the Cu(II) binding affinity of these proteins to be proposed."

We enrolled pregnant African American (n = 152) and white (n = 158) women with singleton live births between 18 and 22 weeks gestation. We measured phthalate metabolites (mono-n-butyl phthalate (MBP), monoisobutyl phthalate (MiBP), monobenzyl phthalate (MBzP), mono(2-ethylhexyl) phthalate (MEHP), mono(2-ethyl-5-oxohexyl) phthalate (MEOHP), mono-2-ethyl-5-hydroxyhexyl phthalate (MEHHP), monoethyl phthalate (MEP), monomethyl phthalate (MMP), and the sums of DEHP (ΣDEHP) and DBP (ΣDBP) metabolites) in up to two gestational urine specimens from mothers, and evaluated confounder-adjusted associations per natural log unit greater concentration with birth weight for gestational age z-score, small for gestational age (SGA; <10th %tile), preterm birth (PTB; <37 weeks gestation), and low birth weight (LBW; <2500 g). We also tested for interactions by maternal race and infant sex. We found that lower z-scores were associated with greater MiBP (β = -0.28; 95% CI: -0.54, -0.02) and MMP (β = -0.30; 95% CI: -0.52, -0.09) concentrations, while MEP interacted with race (p = 0.04), indicating an association among whites (β = -0.14; 95% CI: -0.28, 0.001) but not among African Americans (β = 0.05; 95% CI = -0.09, 0.19). Greater MiBP (OR = 2.82; 95% CI: 1.21, 6.56) and MEOHP (OR = 2.80; 95% CI: 1.05, 7.42) were associated with an overall higher SGA risk, greater MEHP was associated with higher SGA risk (p = 0.10) in whites (OR = 3.26 95% CI: 0.64, 16.56) but not in African Americans (OR = 0.71 95% CI: 0.07, 7.17), and the associations for MiBP (p = 0.02) and ΣDBP (p = 0.02) varied by infant sex. We detected interactions for PTB in which African Americans were at higher risk than whites for greater MiBP (p = 0.08) and MEP (p = 0.02) although lower risk for greater MEHP (p = 0.09). Greater MEP was associated with an overall higher LBW risk (OR = 1.33; 95% CI: 0.95, 1.86), and males were at higher risk than females with greater MBP (p = 0.002), MiBP (p = 0.02), MBzP (p = 0.01), MEP (p = 0.002), MMP (p = 0.09), and ΣDBP (p = 0.01) concentrations.

However, almost all these systems were performed in an unbuffered solution and actually under acidic pH condition, with the electricity being frequently supplied by external power. Considering the high buffering capacity of wastewater and energy saving, peroxydisulfate (PDS) activation by Fe(III) species with bioelectricity provided by microbial fuel cell (MFC) for bisphenol A (BPA) oxidation was investigated at fixed near-neutral pH as well as acidic pH. The results indicate that 90.8% of BPA could be removed at pH 2.5. Though the iron existed in the form of precipitate, BPA could still be efficiently removed at pH 6.0. The precipitate formed in the system at pH 6.0 was identified as the amorphous iron oxyhydroxides. Sulfate radicals in the bulk solution and that adsorbed on the precipitate were the dominant reactive species responsible for the oxidation of BPA in the homogeneous and heterogeneous MFC/Fe(III)/PDS processes, respectively. The mechanisms of BPA degradation at both pH values were proposed via EPR and quenching tests as well as XPS analysis.

The thermodynamic analysis revealed that in the presence of Na2O2 at appropriate temperatures, the Cr2O3 in the ferronickel slag can be converted to NaCrO2, instead of Na2CrO4, which prevents the formation of highly toxic Cr (VI). The experimental results confirmed that under the optimal alkaline roasting and water leaching conditions of the mass ratio of ferronickel slag to Na2O2 of 1, roasting temperature of 600 °C, roasting time of 1 h, leaching temperature of 50 °C, leaching time of 1 h, and liquid-to-solid ratio of 10 mL/g, 92.33% of Cr was leached with 64.28% of Na and 11.16% of Si and only 0.06 wt % Cr was left in the leaching residue. The high leaching percentage of Cr was a result of the transformation of Cr2O3 in the ferronickel slag to NaCrO2 with a loose structure during alkaline roasting that was beneficial to water dissolution. Compared to the traditional alkaline roasting process, the proposed more environmentally friendly method did not produce toxic Cr (VI) during recovery of chromium and the resulting residue has potential to be used as a good construction material.","Glucocorticoid mixtures of fluticasone propionate, triamcinolone acetonide and clobetasol propionate induce additive effects in zebrafish embryos.",https://www.ncbi.nlm.nih.gov/pubmed/30981015,Journal of hazardous materials,2019 05 20,"Many synthetic glucocorticoids from medical applications occur in the aquatic environment. Whether they pose a risk for fish health is poorly known. Here we investigate effects of glucocorticoids fluticasone propionate (FLU) and triamcinolone acetonide (TRI) as single steroids and as ternary mixtures with clobetasol propionate (CLO) in zebrafish embryos. Exposure to FLU and TRI in a range of concentrations between 0.099 and 120.08 μg/L led to concentration-related decrease in muscle contractions and increase in heart rate at 0.98 and 1.05 μg/L, respectively, and higher. Genes encoding for proteins related to glucose metabolism (g6pca, pepck1), immune system regulation (fkbp5, irg1l, socs3, gilz) and matrix metalloproteinases mmp-9 and mmp-13 showed expressional alterations, as well as genes encoding for the progestin receptor (pgr) and corticosteroid dehydrogenase (hsd11b2). FLU accelerated hatching and led to embryotoxicity (immobilization and edema). Ternary mixtures (FLU + TRI + CLO) induced the same physiological and toxicological effects at concentrations of individual glucocorticoids of 11.1-16.37 μg/L and higher. Heart rate was increased in the mixture at concentrations as low as 0.0885-0.11 μg/L of each steroid. Glucocorticoids in mixtures showed additive activity; the fold-changes of transcripts of 19 target genes were additive. Together, our data show that glucocorticoids act additively and their joint activity may be of concern for developing fish in contaminated environments.",Oral exposure to cadmium and mercury alone and in combination causes damage to the lung tissue of Sprague-Dawley rats.,https://www.ncbi.nlm.nih.gov/pubmed/30981014,Environmental toxicology and pharmacology,2019 06 08,"Environmental presence and human exposure to heavy metals in air and cigarette smoke has led to a worldwide increase in respiratory disease. The effects of oral exposure to heavy metals in liver and kidney structure and function have been widely investigated and the respiratory system as a target is often overlooked. The aim of the study was to investigate the possible structural changes in the lung tissue of Sprague-Dawley rats after oral exposure for 28 days to cadmium (Cd) and mercury (Hg), alone and in combination at 1000 times the World Health Organization's limit for each metal in drinking water. Following exposure, the general morphology of the bronchiole and lungs as well as collagen and elastin distribution was evaluated using histological techniques and transmission electron microscopy. In the lungs, structural changes to the alveoli included collapsed alveolar spaces, presence of inflammatory cells and thickening of the alveolar walls. In addition, exposure to Cd and Hg caused degeneration of the alveolar structures resulting in confluent alveoli. Changes in bronchiole morphology included an increase in smooth muscle mass with luminal epithelium degeneration, detachment and aggregation. Prominent bronchiole-associated lymphoid tissue was present in the group exposed to Cd and Hg. Ultrastructural examination confirmed the presence of fibrosis where in the Cd exposed group, collagen fibrils arrangement was dense, while in the Hg exposed group, additional prominent elastin was present. This study identified the lungs as target of heavy metals toxicity following oral exposure resulting in cellular damage, inflammation and fibrosis and increased risk of respiratory disease where Hg showed the greatest fibrotic effect, which was further, aggravated in combination with Cd.",Optimization of light intensity and photoperiod for Isochrysis galbana culture to improve the biomass and lipid production using 14-L photobioreactors with mixed light emitting diodes (LEDs) wavelength under two-phase culture system.,https://www.ncbi.nlm.nih.gov/pubmed/30981013,Bioresource technology,2019 05 31,"The optimal light intensity and photoperiod required to produce high biomass and lipid contents in Isochrysis galbana cultured in a 14-L bioreactor with LED wavelengths was studied.

While it has been suggested that poor implementation of cognitive reappraisal in dealing with aversive events precedes the onset of subclinical paranoid thinking, there is little empirical research on neural activation patterns during cognitive reappraisal efforts that might indicate vulnerability towards paranoid thinking. Prefrontal EEG alpha asymmetry changes were recorded while n = 57 participants were generating alternative appraisals of anger-eliciting events, and were linked to a behavioral measure of basic cognitive reappraisal capacity and self-reported paranoia proneness (assessed by personality facets of hostility and suspiciousness; Personality Inventory for DSM-5). Mediation analysis revealed that less left-lateralized activation at ventrolateral prefrontal sites during reappraisal efforts predicted a higher degree of paranoia proneness. This relationship was mediated through poorer cognitive reappraisal capacity. Matching previous evidence, findings suggest that inappropriate brain activation during reappraisal efforts impairs individuals' capacity to come up with effective alternative interpretations for anger-evoking situations, which may accentuate personality features related to increased paranoid thinking. The findings add to our understanding of neurally underpinned impairments in the capacity to generate cognitive reappraisals and their link to maladaptive personality and behavior.",A Comprehensive Railroad-Highway Grade Crossing Consolidation Model: A Machine Learning Approach.,https://www.ncbi.nlm.nih.gov/pubmed/30980987,Accident; analysis and prevention,2019 05 19,"In the United States, there are approximately 212,000 highway-rail grade crossings, some of which experience vehicle-train incidents that often cause a massive financial burden, loss of life, and injury. In 2017, there were 2,108 highway-rail incidents resulting in 827 injuries and 307 fatalities nationwide. To eliminate collision risks, crossing grade separation and active alarm improvement are commonly used. Moreover, crossing closures are considered to be the most effective safety improvement program. While it may be very difficult, and in some cases impossible to close crossings, there are some incentive programs that facilitate the closure process. One of these programs is a working consolidation model that aims to determine crossing closure suitability. Using details of highway-rail grade crossings in the United States and applying an eXtreme Gradient Boosting (XGboost) algorithm, this paper proposes a data-driven consolidation model that takes into consideration a number of engineering variables. The results indicated an overall accuracy of 0.991 for the proposed model. In addition, the developed XGboost consolidation model reported the relative importance of the variables input to the model, offering an in-depth understanding of the model's behavior. Finally, for the practical implementation of the model, a simplified version containing fewer variables was developed. A sensitivity analysis was performed considering the aggregate gain and the different correlation threshold values between variables. This analysis developed a simplified model utilizing 14 variables, with aggregated gain values of 75% and a correlation threshold of 0.9 which would perform similarly to the full model. Based on this model, 62% of current highway-rail grade crossings should be closed.",The effects of public private partnerships on road safety outcomes.,https://www.ncbi.nlm.nih.gov/pubmed/30980986,Accident; analysis and prevention,2019 05 19,"Public Private Partnerships (PPP) have become common in providing high-quality infrastructure in many countries worldwide. One of the main reasons for PPP agreements is to improve efficiency and quality in the delivery of public services, as well as to boost investments for expensive projects. Despite PPPs having been particularly widespread in the case of the construction and rehabilitation of high-capacity road infrastructure, their impact in terms of road safety outcomes is still unexplored. This paper studies the effects of PPPs on road safety outcomes by taking advantage of the variety of production models provided in the Spanish highway network. Results based on a panel-data fixed-effects method show that the most relevant aspect influencing road safety outcomes is the quality of design of the road. However, we find evidence suggesting that privately operated highways (PPPs) are positively correlated with better road safety outcomes for roads with similar quality. This finding that should be confirmed by further research raises interest in the mechanisms that could produce this link between management models and road safety.",Anatomical Fat Grafting for Reconstruction of Frontotemporal Contour Deformities After Neurosurgical and Craniofacial Surgical Interventions: A Symmetry Outcome Study.,https://www.ncbi.nlm.nih.gov/pubmed/30980984,World neurosurgery,2019 05 19,"Fat grafting has been described as an option to repair frontotemporal contour deformities (volumetric deficiency of bone and/or soft tissues) after neurosurgical/craniofacial surgical interventions.

However, the positive roles of SO2 in plant adaptation to drought stress are still unclear. In this study, we investigated the physiological and molecular changes that are induced by SO2 fumigation to improve the drought tolerance of foxtail millet seedlings. The relative water content in the leaves of drought-stressed seedlings was significantly improved by pre-exposure to 30 mg/m3 SO2. These responses might be related to decreased stomatal apertures and a reduced leaf transpiration rate, which were induced by SO2 under drought conditions. In addition, the SO2 pretreatment markedly enhanced proline accumulation in the leaves of drought-stressed seedlings, which was supported by increased Δ1-pyrroline-5-carboxylate synthetase (P5CS) activity, decreased proline dehydrogenase (ProDH) activity, and the corresponding transcripts. Moreover, the SO2 application upregulated the enzyme activity of catalase (CAT) and peroxidase (POD) in the leaves of drought-stressed plants, as well as their transcripts, which contributed to the scavenging of hydrogen peroxide (H2O2) and alleviated drought-induced oxidative damage, as indicated by the decreased malondialdehyde (MDA) level in SO2-pretreated plants. Together, these results indicate that the application of SO2 might enhance drought tolerance by reducing stomatal apertures, increasing proline accumulation, and promoting antioxidant defence in foxtail millet seedlings. This study presents new insight into the beneficial roles of SO2 in plant responses to drought stress.",Microevolution or wide tolerance? Level of stress proteins in the beet armyworm Spodoptera eqigua hübner (Lepidoptera: Noctuidae) exposed to cadmium for over 150 generations.,https://www.ncbi.nlm.nih.gov/pubmed/30980963,Ecotoxicology and environmental safety,2019 04 29,"The aim of this study was to investigate whether the cadmium tolerance developed in the beet armyworm Spodoptera exigua selected for over 150 generations may be related to synthesis of the stress proteins metallothioneins (Mts) and 70 kDa heat shock proteins (HSP70). To achieve this, six S. exigua strains (control, k), 150-generation Cd exposure strain (cd), and four 18-generation Cd exposure strains differing in Cd concentration (cd44, cd22, cd11, cd5) were reared. Stress protein level was measured in the midgut of the 5th larval stage after 1-6, 12 and 18 generations. Cd contents was measured in the pupae. Unlike Cd concentration, which depended on metal contents in food but was not generation-dependent, the pattern of Mts and HSP70 concentrations changed in experimental strains from generation to generation. Stress protein levels in the insects exposed to the highest Cd concentration (the same as in the 150-generation Cd exposure strain), initially higher than in the control strain, after the 12th generation did not differ from the level measured in the control strains. It seems therefore that stress proteins play a protective role in insects of lower tolerance to cadmium. The tolerance developed during multigenerational exposure probably relies on mechanisms other than Mt and HSP70 synthesis.","Multi-drug resistant Escherichia coli isolated from canine feces in a public park in Quito, Ecuador.",https://www.ncbi.nlm.nih.gov/pubmed/30980959,Journal of global antimicrobial resistance,2019 04 13,"We focused on estimating the prevalence of extended-spectrum-β-lactamase (ESBL), pAmpC, carbapemenases, and mcr-1 producing Escherichia coli in canine feces from a public park in Quito, Ecuador.",First multicenter report of in vitro resistance rates in candidemia isolates in Turkey.,https://www.ncbi.nlm.nih.gov/pubmed/30980958,Journal of global antimicrobial resistance,2019 04 13,We investigated the antifungal resistance rates in strains isolated from patients with candidemia episodes in 12 tertiary-care centers in Turkey.,Impact of the occiput and external acoustic meatus to axis angle on dysphagia in patients suffering from anterior atlantoaxial subluxation after occipitocervical fusion.,https://www.ncbi.nlm.nih.gov/pubmed/30980955,The spine journal : official journal of the North American Spine Society,2019 04 29,"Dysphagia is a complication that sometimes occurs after occipitocervical fusion (OCF).

Toll-like receptor 3 (TLR3) has recently been reported to play an important role in hippocampus-dependent working memory. However, the role of TLR3 in the development of POCD remains unclear. In the current study, we hypothesized that increased extracellular RNAs (exRNAs) during anesthesia and surgical operation, especially double stranded RNAs (dsRNAs), would activate TLR3 signaling pathways and mediate POCD. Using a mouse model of POCD, 20-22 months wild-type (WT) mice were undergoing unilateral nephrectomy and increased TLR3 expression levels and co-localization with neuronal and microglial cells were found in the surgery group compared with the sham group. Compared with WT mice, TLR3 knockout (KO, -/-) mice had improved hippocampus-dependent memory and attenuated production of inflammatory cytokines and apoptosis. Increased exRNAs and/or co-localization with TLR3 were found in both in vitro and in vivo models. Of note, TLR3/dsRNA complex inhibitor administration reduced hippocampal dsRNA level and TLR3 expression, attenuated hippocampal inflammatory cytokines production and apoptosis, and thus improved hippocampus-dependent memory. Our results indicate that exRNAs, especially dsRNAs, present under stressful conditions may trigger TLR3 activation and initiate the downstream inflammatory and apoptotic signaling, and play a substantial role in the development of POCD.",Cerebral transcriptome analysis reveals age-dependent progression of neuroinflammation in P301S mutant tau transgenic male mice.,https://www.ncbi.nlm.nih.gov/pubmed/30980950,"Brain, behavior, and immunity",2019 04 16,"Aggregation of the microtubule-associated protein, tau, can lead to neurofibrillary tangle formation in neurons and glia which is the hallmark of tauopathy. The cellular damage induced by the formation of neurofibrillary tangles leads to neuroinflammation and consecutive neuronal death. However, detailed observation of transcriptomic changes under tauopathy together with the comparison of age-dependent progression of neuroinflammatory gene expressions mediated by tau overexpression is required. Employing RNA sequencing on PS19 transgenic mice that overexpress human mutant tau harboring the P301S mutation, we have examined the effects of age-dependent tau overexpression on transcriptomic changes of immune and inflammatory responses in the cerebral cortex. Compared to age-matched wild type control, P301S transgenic mice exhibit significant transcriptomic alterations. We have observed age-dependent neuroinflammatory gene expression changes in both wild type and P301S transgenic mice where tau overexpression further promoted the expression of neuroinflammatory genes in 10-month old P301S transgenic mice. Moreover, functional gene network analyses (gene ontology and pathway enrichment) and prospective target protein interactions predicted the potential involvement of multiple immune and inflammatory pathways that may contribute to tau-mediated neuronal pathology. Our current study on P301S transgenic mice model revealed for the first time, the differences of gene expression patterns in both early and late stage of tau pathology in cerebral cortex. Our analyses also revealed that tau overexpression alone induces multiple inflammatory and immune transcriptomic changes and may provide a roadmap to elucidate the targets of anti-inflammatory therapeutic strategy focused on tau pathology and related neurodegenerative diseases."

In temperate marine ecosystems, kelps (Laminariales) drive productivity and form essential habitat but an incomplete understanding of their phylogeny has limited our ability to infer their evolutionary origins and the spatial and temporal patterns of their diversification. Here, we reconstruct the diversification of habitat-forming kelps using a global genus-level phylogeny inferred primarily from organellar genome datasets, and investigate the timing of kelp radiation. We resolve several important phylogenetic features, including relationships among the morphologically simple kelp families and the broader radiation of complex kelps, demonstrating that the initial radiation of the latter resulted from an increase in speciation rate around the Eocene-Oligocene boundary. This burst in speciation rate is consistent with a possible role of recent climatic cooling in triggering the kelp radiation and pre-dates the origin of benthic-foraging carnivores. Historical biogeographical reconstructions point to a northeast Pacific origin of complex kelps, with subsequent colonization of new habitats likely playing an important role in driving their ecological diversification. We infer that complex morphologies associated with modern kelp forests (e.g. branching, pneumatocysts) evolved several times over the past 15-20 MY, highlighting the importance of morphological convergence in establishing modern upright kelp forests. Our phylogenomic findings provide new insights into the geographical and ecological proliferation of kelps and provide a timeline along which feedbacks between kelps and their food-webs could have shaped the structure of temperate ecosystems.","Evolution of the human cold/menthol receptor, TRPM8.",https://www.ncbi.nlm.nih.gov/pubmed/30980935,Molecular phylogenetics and evolution,2019 05 27,"Genes showing versatile functions or subjected to fast expansion and contraction during the adaptation of species to specific ecological conditions, like sensory receptors for odors, pheromones and tastes, are characterized by a great plasticity through evolution. One of the most fascinating sensory receptors in the family of TRP channels, the cold and menthol receptor TRPM8, has received significant attention in the literature. Recent studies have reported the existence of TRPM8 channel isoforms encoded by alternative mRNAs transcribed from alternative promoters and processed by alternative splicing. Since the first draft of the human genome was accomplished in 2000, alternative transcription, alternative splicing and alternative translation have appeared as major sources of gene product diversity and are thought to participate in the generation of complexity in higher organisms. In this study, we investigate whether alternative transcription has been a driving force in the evolution of the human forms of the cold receptor TRPM8. We identified 33 TRPM8 alternative mRNAs (24 new sequences) and their associated protein isoforms in human tissues. Using comparative genomics, we described the evolution of the human TRPM8 sequences in eight ancestors since the origin of Amniota, and estimated in which ancestors the new TRPM8 variants originated. In order to validate the estimated origins of this receptor, we performed experimental validations of predicted exons in mouse tissues. Our results suggest a first diversification event of the cold receptor in the Boreoeutheria ancestor, and a subsequent divergence at the origin of Simiiformes.",(Almost) All Nonstenotic Bicuspid Aortic Valves Should Be Preserved or Repaired.,https://www.ncbi.nlm.nih.gov/pubmed/30980934,Seminars in thoracic and cardiovascular surgery,2019 05 07,"Valve preservation or repair of the regurgitant bicuspid aortic valve (BAV) minimizes valve-related complications.

After these initial repairs, the improvement in open surgical techniques, cardiopulmonary bypass, anesthesia, and perioperative care were the primary drivers of the decrease in morbidity and mortality associated with repair. The development of endovascular technology has spurred another revolution in the management of aortic arch aneurysms. In this review, we present a current appraisal and description of open surgical, hybrid, and endovascular techniques based on the literature. These techniques are varied and have different advantages and disadvantages, depending on patient anatomy and perioperative surgical risk. We provide an overview of the attributes of each technique and how they may be applied to individual cases. While each technique could not be discussed in detail in this report, it is clear that institutions must be able to proficiently offer the full spectrum of open, hybrid, and endovascular surgical techniques to treat this diverse condition. For low and intermediate risk patients, open surgery remains the gold standard. However, just as improvements in technique, monitoring and perioperative care led to progress in open repair, similar advancements in endograft technology, anatomical customization, and embolic protection will expand the use of endovascular repair. As the management of the condition becomes increasingly nuanced and multidisciplinary, centers must be equipped to offer a variety of techniques with high fidelity and adaptability to each unique patient.",Almost All Incompetent BAV Should Be Repaired.,https://www.ncbi.nlm.nih.gov/pubmed/30980931,Seminars in thoracic and cardiovascular surgery,2019 05 11,"The short answer to this topic is ""No, most incompetent bicuspid aortic valve should not be repaired."" Aortic valve repair certainly plays an important role in the management of incompetent bicuspid aortic valve of young patients, and the selection criteria are like those for incompetent tricuspid aortic valve. The tissue that makes the cusps should normal or have minor abnormalities easily corrected by surgery such as plication of the free margin. In addition, the anatomic orientation of the conjoint and the normal cusps should be approximately at 180°. If the root is dilated, reimplantation of the aortic valve is likely the most reproducible approach, and if the root is not dilated but the annulus is, a subannular annuloplasty and correction of the cusp prolapse is adequate. Most patients with incompetent bicuspid aortic valve have malformed, fibrotic and calcified cusps and replacement with either pulmonary autograft or a mechanical aortic valve in young patients and a bioprosthetic aortic valve are likely to provide better long-term outcomes than aortic valve repair.",Mesenteric Malperfusion in Acute Aortic Dissection: Challenges and Frontiers.,https://www.ncbi.nlm.nih.gov/pubmed/30980930,Seminars in thoracic and cardiovascular surgery,2019 05 15,"Malperfusion syndrome results from end-organ ischemia in the setting of an aortic dissection.

The incidence MMP is between 66% and 100% in different literature. The insidious onset of MMP, among the different ischemic end-organ complications, makes it a challenge for diagnosis and management. The management of MMP is still a polemic, as to whether initially the aortic repair to be done or to restore the mesenteric perfusion. The approach for acute type A aortic dissection with MMP includes initial central repair, endovascular repair followed by central repair or simultaneous repair. Endovascular remains the main mode of treatment for acute type B aortic dissection with MMP.

Given the important role for mitochondria in human disease, we hypothesized that prenatal air pollution exposure may be associated with mitochondrial dysfunction and that mitochondrial-derived peptides (MDPs) might protect against these effects. In in vitro studies, 24-hour exposure to nanoparticulate matter (nPM) increased oxidation of mtDNA, decreased mitochondrial consumption rate (OCR), and decreased mtDNAcn in SH-SY5Y cells. Addition of MDPs rescued these effects to varying degrees. Liver tissue taken from C57Bl/6 males exposed for 10 weeks to nPM had lower OCR, lower mtDNAcn and higher MDP levels, similar to in vitro studies. In newborn cord blood, MDP levels were positively associated with prenatal TRAP exposures. Moreover, DNA methylation of two distinct regions of the D-Loop in the mitochondria genome was associated with levels of several MDPs. Our in vitro and in vivo data indicate that TRAP can directly affect mitochondrial respiratory function and mtDNAcn. Treatment of cells with MDPs can counteract TRAP induced-effects. Lastly, we present evidence that suggests MDPs may be regulated in part by mitochondrial DNA methylation in humans.",Intramitochondrial transfer and engineering of mammalian mitochondrial genomes in yeast.,https://www.ncbi.nlm.nih.gov/pubmed/30980913,Mitochondrion,2019 05 02,"Mitochondrial genomes (mtDNA) depend on the nuclear genome with which they have evolved to provide essential replication functions and have been known to replicate as xenotransplants only in the cells of closely related species. We now report that complete mouse mitochondrial genomes can be stably transplanted into the mitochondrial network in yeast devoid of their own mtDNA. Our analyses of these xenomitochondrial yeast cells show that they are accurately replicating intact mouse mtDNA genomes without rearrangement and that these mtDNA genomes have the same overall topology as the mtDNA present in the mouse mitochondrial network (i.e., circular monomers). Moreover, non-mtDNA replication and selection sequences required for maintaining the mitochondrial genomes in bacterial hosts are dispensable in these yeast mitochondria and could be efficiently and seamlessly removed by targeted homologous recombination within the mitochondria. These findings demonstrate that the yeast mtDNA replication system is capable of accurately replicating intact mammalian mtDNA genomes without sequence loss or rearrangement and that yeast mitochondria are a highly versatile host system for engineering complete mammalian mitochondrial genomes.",Effects of lead exposure on brain glucose metabolism and insulin signaling pathway in the hippocampus of rats.,https://www.ncbi.nlm.nih.gov/pubmed/30980912,Toxicology letters,2019 05 28,"The aim of this study was to determine whether Pb affects glucose metabolism in the hippocampus of rats.

Then, the weight of the rats; brain Pb content; brain glucose levels; activities of hexokinase, fructose-6-phosphate kinase, pyruvate kinase, glucose-6-phosphate dehydrogenase; expression of genes related to the insulin signaling pathway; as well as the gene and protein expression of glucose transporter (GLUT)-1 and GLUT-3 in the hippocampus were evaluated. The results showed that Pb content in the brain tissue of rats in the dose groups significantly increased, whereas the body weight gain, activities of glucose metabolism-related enzymes, and expression of the insulin signaling pathway-related genes significantly decreased compared to the corresponding values in the control group. In comparison with the control group, the brain glucose levels increased significantly in the low-dose group, but there were no significant differences with the middle- and high-dose groups. Furthermore, the mRNA of GLUT-1 in the three dose groups and the GLUT-3 in the middle- and high-dose groups rose markedly, while the GLUT-1 and GLUT-3 protein expression significantly increased in the middle- and high-dose groups and in the high-dose group, respectively.

Long-term exposure of rats to lead resulted in its accumulation in kidney. The accumulated metal impaired kidney function and structure. Lead intoxication resulted in oxidative stress, inflammation and apoptosis in kidney. In addition, it resulted in nitric oxide (NO) overproduction and decrease in hydrogen sulfide (H2S) level and heme oxygenase (HO-1) concentration in kidney. Inhibition of NO overproduction by L-N(G)-nitroarginine methyl ester (L-NAME) and increasing of H2S level by sodium hydrosulfide (NaHS) and CO level by carbon monoxide-releasing molecule-A1 (CORM-A1) inhibited lead-induced impairment of kidney function and structure. These agents inhibited lead-intoxication induced oxidative stress, inflammation, apoptosis, nitrosative stress and reduction of H2S level and HO-1 concentration. Also, concomitant treatment with these agents inhibited lead intoxication-induced increase in protein expressions of inducible NO synthase (iNOS), tumor necrosis factor-alpha (TNF-α), interleukin-1beta (IL-1β) and caspase-3 as well as decrease in protein expressions of HO-1 and cystathionine- γ-lyase (CSE) in kidney. The NO donor, L-arginine and the H2S and CO biosynthesis inhibitors, trifluoro-DL-alanine and zinc deutroporphyrin, respectively produced opposite effects and aggravated the toxic effects of lead.

The effect of siAHR, siAHRR and siNFKB2 on the expression of CYP1A1, CYP1B1, GSTM1, ERα, AR and cell proliferation was described. M1 decreased AhR and CYP1A1, while increased AhRR and ARNT expression. M2 also decreased AhR and CYP1A1 but had no effect on AhRR expression. siAHRR reversed the inhibitory effect of M1 on AhR and CYP1A1,while inhibitory effect of M2 was still observed. siNFKB2 reversed inhibitory effect of both mixtures on AhR and CYP1A1 expression and stimulatory effect of M1 on AhRR expression. siAHR reversed stimulatory effect of both mixtures on ERα expression. Stimulatory effect of M1 on cell proliferation was not observed in siAHR, was still observed in siESR1 cells. M2 had no effect on cell proliferation, however stimulatory effect was appeared in siAHR and siESR1cells. In conclusion: M1 by activation of AhRR and NFkB p52, but M2 only by activation of NFκB attenuated AhR signalling and ligand-induced CYP1A1 expression.

Studies have shown that the mechanisms induced in germ cells in response to oxidative damage varies with age, that DNA repair efficiency declines, and both sperm DNA damage and spontaneous mutations increase. However, it is not known whether the altered response with age is a cause, or consequence, of an age-associated change in cell susceptibility to genetic damage. Following a single 150 mg/kg dose of cyclophosphamide (CP), young (8-weeks old) and aged (17-month old) male mice were examined 24 h later for induced genetic damage in epididymal spermatozoa using the alkaline comet and sperm chromatin stability assays. Apoptosis among testicular cells was examined on tissue cross-sections using the TUNEL assay. Sperm showed no significant increase in DNA strand breaks with age (detected by the comet assay) and no change in sperm chromatin stability (detected by the SCSA assay). Following CP treatment, there was no effect on DNA-strand breakage but sperm chromatin instability was significantly higher. Furthermore, it was also significantly elevated in old treated, compared with young treated, animals suggesting that increased age affects the sensitivity of epididymal sperm to chromatin damage. There was no difference in apoptosis in testicular germ cells from either young or old control animals, while CP administration resulted in a significant increase in apoptosis among young animals but not old animals. Following genotoxin exposure, an increase in chromatin instability in the spermatozoa of old animals and a decrease in the ability of their testicular germ cells undergo apoptosis suggests an age-related decrease in genome protection mechanisms. Since those germ cells are only transiently present in the testis, it is likely that this age-related deterioration originates in the spermatogonial stem cells. The findings are also evidence that the safety evaluation of reproductive genotoxins should consider young and old individuals separately.",Chromatin modification factors in plant pathogenic fungi: Insights from Ustilago maydis.,https://www.ncbi.nlm.nih.gov/pubmed/30980908,Fungal genetics and biology : FG & B,2019 06 09,"Adaptation to the environment is a requirement for the survival of every organism. For pathogenic fungi this also implies coping with the different conditions that occur during the infection cycle. After detecting changes to external media, organisms must modify their gene expression patterns in order to accommodate the new circumstances. Control of gene expression is a complex process that involves the coordinated action of multiple regulatory elements. Chromatin modification is a well-known mechanism for controlling gene expression in response to environmental changes in all eukaryotes. In pathogenic fungi, chromatin modifications are known to play crucial roles in controlling host interactions and their virulence capacity, yet little is known about the specific genes they directly target and to which signals they respond. The smut fungus Ustilago maydis is an excellent model system in which multiple molecular and cellular approaches are available to study biotrophic interactions. Many target genes regulated during the infection process have been well studied, however, how they are controlled and specifically how chromatin modifications affect gene regulation in the context of infection is not well known in this organism. Here, we analyse the presence of chromatin modifying enzymes and complexes in U. maydis and discuss their putative roles in this plant pathogen in the context of findings from other organisms, including other plant pathogens such as Magnaporthe oryzae and Fusarium graminearum. We propose U. maydis as a remarkable organism with interesting chromatin features, which would allow finding new functions of chromatin modifications during plant pathogenesis.","Mutations in the phosphatase domain of the 6-phosphofructo-2-kinase/fructose 2,6-bisphosphatase result in the transcriptional activation of the alternative oxidase and gluconeogenic pathways in Podospora anserina.",https://www.ncbi.nlm.nih.gov/pubmed/30980907,Fungal genetics and biology : FG & B,2019 06 03,"By screening suppressors of a respiratory mutant lacking a functional cytochrome pathway in the filamentous fungus Podospora anserina, we isolated a mutation located in the phosphatase domain of the bi-functional enzyme 6-phosphofructo-2-kinase/fructose 2,6-bisphosphatase (PFK-2/FBPase-2). We show that the inactivation of the phosphatase but not of the kinase domain is responsible for the suppressor effect that results from the activation of the RSEs transcription factors that control expression of AOX, an alternative oxidase able to bypass the mitochondria cytochrome pathway of respiration. Remarkably, activation of the RSEs also stimulates the expression of the gluconeogenic enzymes, fructose-1,6 bi-phosphatase (FBPase-1) and phosphoenolpyruvate carboxykinase (PCK-1). We thus reveal in P. anserina an apparently paradoxical situation where the inactivation of the phosphatase domain of PFK-2/FBPase-2, supposed to stimulate glycolysis, is correlated with the transcriptional induction of the gluconeogenic enzymes.

This tropolone-humulene-tropolone meroterpenoid could be originated from two units of tropolone orthoquinone methides and a 10-hydroxyhumulene moiety via hetero-Diels-Alder reactions. To explore the biosynthesis of this class of tropolonic sesquiterpenes, the genome of a eupenifeldin-producing Phoma sp. was sequenced and analyzed. The biosynthetic gene cluster of eupenifeldin (eup) was identified and partially validated by genomic analysis, gene disruption, and product analysis. A nonreducing polyketide synthase EupA, a FAD-dependent monooxygenase EupB, and a non-heme Fe (II)-dependent dioxygenase EupC, were identified as the enzymes responsible for tropolone formation. While the terpene cyclase EupE of an unknown family was characterized to catalyze humulene formation, and a cytochrome P450 enzyme EupD was responsible for hydroxylation of humulene.

The spotted scat (Scatophagus argus), with a stable XX-XY sex-determination system and the candidate sex determination gene dmrt1, provides a good model for understanding the mechanism of sex determination and differentiation in teleosts. In this study, we analyzed spotted scat gsdf tissue distribution and gene expression patterns in gonads, as well as further analysis of transcriptional regulation. Tissue distribution analysis showed that gsdf was only expressed in testis and ovary. Real-time PCR showed that both gsdf and dmrt1 were expressed significantly higher in testes at different phases (phase III, IV and V) compared to ovaries at phase II, III and IV, while gsdf was expressed significantly higher in phase II ovaries than those of phase III and IV. Western blot analysis also showed that Gsdf was more highly expressed in the testis than ovary. Immunohistochemistry analysis showed that Gsdf was expressed in Sertoli cells surrounding spermatogonia in the testis, while it was expressed in the somatic cells surrounding the oogonia of the ovary. Approximately 2.7 kb of the 5' upstream region of gsdf was cloned from the spotted scat genomic DNA and in silico promoter analysis revealed the putative transcription factor binding sites of Dmrt1 and Sf1. The luciferase reporter assay, using the human embryonic kidney cells, demonstrated that Dmrt1 activated gsdf expression in a dose-dependent manner in the presence of Sf1 in spotted scat. These results suggest that Gsdf could play a role in regulating the development of spermatogonia and oogonia, and also participate in male sex differentiation by acting as a downstream gene of Dmrt1 in spotted scat.","Evaluation of the effect of a toothpaste containing Pudilan extract on inhibiting plaques and reducing chronic gingivitis: A randomized, double-blinded, parallel controlled clinical trial.",https://www.ncbi.nlm.nih.gov/pubmed/30980892,Journal of ethnopharmacology,2019 06 16,"Pudilan is a famous traditional Chinese medicine compound which contains several Chinese herbal ingredients, and has been wildly used to treat a variety of inflammatory diseases in China.

Here, •NO increases mucosal blood flow, mucus thickness and prevents microbial infections. However, the impact of nitrate on gut microbiota, a pleiotropic organism essential to maintain gastrointestinal and systemic welfare, remains elusive. This study investigates the impact of nitrate on gut microbiota profile and ensued mucosal effects during dysbiosis. Male Wistar rats were randomly distributed in 4 groups and the drinking water was supplemented for 7 days as follows: 1) antibiotic cocktail (neomycin, bacitracin and imipenem), 2) antibiotic cocktail + sodium nitrate, 3) sodium nitrate and 4) regular drinking water. Animals were weighted daily and feces were collected before and after the treatment. The stomach was isolated and the expression of occludin, claudin-5 as well as myeloperoxidase and iNOS was studied. Bacterial DNA was analyzed in fecal samples by PCR-DGGE genetic fingerprinting. Nitrate prevented antibiotic-induced body weight loss (1.9 ± 1.8% vs 8.9 ± 1.8%, p < 0.05) and cecamegalia (7.1 ± 0.5% vs 5.6 ± 0.4%, p < 0.05). Gastric expression of occludin and claudin-5 tended to decrease during dysbiosis but both protein levels were recovered following nitrate consumption (p < 0.05).

Furthermore, the cell model was verified by confirming the antihyperuricemic effect of the widely used antihyperuricemic drugs allopurinol, probenecid, and febuxostat, as well as reported bioactive peptides and amino acids, encompassing glutathione, tryptophan and carnosine, which significantly reduced uric acid production in the HK-2 cells (p < 0.05). RNA-Seq technology was used to perform a wide transcriptome analysis of the hyperuricemic cell model, and the results demonstrated that it has the potential to be used as a rapid and valid in vitro model to screen antihyperuricemic compounds that mimics in vivo cell growth patterns.",Determination of mechanical and rheological properties of a cell-loaded peptide gel during ECM production.,https://www.ncbi.nlm.nih.gov/pubmed/30980887,International journal of pharmaceutics,2019 05 01,"The development of an injectable biomaterial that supports cell survival and maintains or promotes nucleus pulposus (NP) phenotype could aid delivery of cells to degenerated NPs causing low back pain. Mesenchymal cells were loaded and grown in a synthetic peptide gel, PuraMatrix®. Cells were observed within the gels over 0-28 days, and accumulation of glycosaminoglycans were detected by histological staining. The mechanical properties of the cell-loaded constructs, and the change of the mechanical properties were studied using stress relaxation of the gels under compression and confinement. The PuraMatrix® gel was shown to relax fast on compression indicating that the fluid could easily flow out of the gel, and thus indicating the presence of large pores/voids. The presence of these pores/voids was further supported by high mobility of dextran molecules, determined using fluorescence recovery after photo bleaching. The stress required to deform the cell-loaded constructs to a specific strain increases at day 21, at which point the presence of glycosaminoglycans within the cell-loaded constructs was also observed. The results provide evidence of changes in mechanical properties of the PuraMatrix® matrix upon excretion of the extracellular matrix by the cells.","Study of naproxen in some aqueous solutions of choline-based deep eutectic solvents: Solubility measurements, volumetric and compressibility properties.",https://www.ncbi.nlm.nih.gov/pubmed/30980886,International journal of pharmaceutics,2019 05 18,"Naproxen (NAP) is a widely used drug for the treatment of pain and inflammatory conditions. However, there is not the physicochemical information about this drug such as solubility, volumetric and compressibility properties in the presence of deep eutectic solvents (DES) as a new class of green solvents to overcome the low solubility of drugs. In this work, the solubility of NAP is studied in the solutions containing some choline chloride (ChCl) based DES at temperature ranges (298.15-313.15) K. The results indicate that the solubility increases with increasing the concentration of DES and temperature and DES containing malonic acid is the proper co-solvent. The experimental solubility values were correlated by the e-NRTL, Wilson and UNIQUAC models. In addition, the complex interactions between the components in the systems should be elucidated, therefore, the thermodynamic properties including volumetric and compressibility properties have been investigated using density and speed of sound measurements at T = 298.15 K. According to calculated thermodynamic parameters, strong interactions between NAP and DESs are observed which is in agreement with obtained solubility data.",Identifying Optimal Factor Scores on the Bereaved Family Survey: Implications for Practice and Policy.,https://www.ncbi.nlm.nih.gov/pubmed/30980885,Journal of pain and symptom management,2019 05 11,The Bereaved Family Survey (BFS) is used to evaluate the quality of end-of-life (EOL) care in Veterans Affairs inpatient settings.

However, little information is available regarding the function of frog PGRPs. In this study, a short-type PGRP (termed Xl-PGRP-S) gene was identified in the African clawed frog, Xenopus laevis. The predicted protein of Xl-PGRP-S contains several structural features known in PGRPs, including a typical PGRP domain and two closely spaced conserved cysteines. Xl-PGRP-S gene was constitutively expressed in all tissues examined, with the highest expression level observed in muscle. As a typical PRR, Xl-PGRP-S is inducible after peptidoglycan (PGN) stimulation, and has an ability to bind PGN. In addition, Xl-PGRP-S has been proven to have Zn2+-dependent amidase activity and antibacterial activity against Edwardsiella tarda. The present study represents the first discovery on the function of frog PGRPs, thus contributing to a better understanding of the functional evolution of PGRPs in early tetrapods.",Adaptive damage retention mechanism enables healthier yeast population.,https://www.ncbi.nlm.nih.gov/pubmed/30980870,Journal of theoretical biology,2019 05 18,"During cytokinesis in budding yeast (Saccharomyces cerevisiae) damaged proteins are distributed asymmetrically between the daughter and the mother cell. Retention of damaged proteins is a crucial mechanism ensuring a healthy daughter cell with full replicative potential and an ageing mother cell. However, the protein quality control (PQC) system is tuned for optimal reproduction success which suggests optimal health and size of the population, rather than long-term survival of the mother cell. Modelling retention of damage as an adaptable mechanism, we propose two damage retention strategies to find an optimal way of decreasing damage retention efficiency to maximize population size and minimize the damage in the individual yeast cell. A pedigree model is used to investigate the impact of small variations in the strategies over the whole population. These impacts are based on the altruistic effects of damage retention mechanism and are measured by a cost function whose minimum value provides the optimal health and size of the population. We showed that fluctuations in the cost function allow yeast cell to continuously vary its strategy, suggesting that optimal reproduction success is a local minimum of the cost function. Our results suggest that a rapid decrease in the efficiency of damage retention, at the time when the mother cell is almost exhausted, produces fewer daughters with high levels of damaged proteins. In addition, retaining more damage during the early divisions increases the number of healthy daughters in the population.",The problem of detrending when analysing potential indicators of disease elimination.,https://www.ncbi.nlm.nih.gov/pubmed/30980869,Journal of theoretical biology,2019 04 27,"As we strive towards the elimination of many burdensome diseases, the question of when intervention efforts may cease is increasingly important. It can be very difficult to know when prevalences are low enough that the disease will die out without further intervention, particularly for diseases that lack accurate tests. The consequences of stopping an intervention prematurely can put back elimination efforts by decades. Critical slowing down theory predicts that as a dynamical system moves through a critical transition, deviations from the steady state return increasingly slowly. We study two potential indicators of disease elimination predicted by this theory, and investigate their response using a simple stochastic model. We compare our dynamical predictions to simulations of the fluctuation variance and coefficient of variation as the system moves through the transition to elimination. These comparisons demonstrate that the primary challenge facing the analysis of early warning signs in timeseries data is that of accurately 'detrending' the signal, in order to preserve the statistical properties of the fluctuations. We show here that detrending using the mean of even just four realisations of the process can give a significant improvement when compared to using a moving window average. Taking this idea further, we consider a 'metapopulation' model of an endemic disease, in which infection spreads in various separated areas with some movement between the subpopulations. We successfully predict the behaviour of both variance and the coefficient of variation in a metapopulation by using information from the other subpopulations to detrend the system.",KIAA1199 promotes sorafenib tolerance and the metastasis of hepatocellular carcinoma by activating the EGF/EGFR-dependent epithelial-mesenchymal transition program.,https://www.ncbi.nlm.nih.gov/pubmed/30980868,Cancer letters,2019 05 03,"Patients with advanced hepatocellular carcinoma (HCC) will almost always develop acquired tolerance after sorafenib therapy, and the molecular mechanism of sorafenib tolerance remains poorly characterized. Here, using our established sorafenib-resistant HCC cell and xenograft models, we identified a novel gene, KIAA1199, which was markedly elevated among the differentially expressed genes involved in sorafenib tolerance. Moreover, elevated expression of KIAA1199 was positively correlated with a high risk of recurrence and metastasis and advanced TNM stage in HCC patients. Functionally, loss- and gain-of-function studies showed that KIAA1199 promoted the migration, invasion, and metastasis of sorafenib-resistant HCC cells. Mechanistically, KIAA1199 is required for EGF-induced epithelial-mesenchymal transition (EMT) in sorafenib-resistant HCC cells by aiding in EGFR phosphorylation. In summary, our data uncover KIAA1199 as a novel sorafenib-tolerant promoting gene that plays an indispensable role in maintaining sorafenib-resistant HCC cell metastasis.",Glycochenodeoxycholate promotes hepatocellular carcinoma invasion and migration by AMPK/mTOR dependent autophagy activation.,https://www.ncbi.nlm.nih.gov/pubmed/30980867,Cancer letters,2019 05 03,"Metastasis and recurrence severely impact the treatment effect of hepatocellular carcinoma (HCC). HCC complicated with cholestasis is more prone to recurrence and metastasis. Previous studies have implicated pathogenesis of HCC by bile acid; however, the underlying mechanism is unknown yet. Glycochenodeoxycholate (GCDC) is one of most important component of bile acid (BA). In the present study, the role of GCDC in HCC cells invasion was detected by in vitro and in vivo assays. GCDC was found to significantly enhance the invasive potential of HCC cells; Further studies showed that GCDC could induce autophagy activation and higher invasive capability in HCC cells. Interestingly, inhibition of autophagy by chloroquine (CQ) reversed this phenomenon. Subsequently, the correlation between TBA expression level and clinicopathological characteristics was analyzed in HCC patients. Clinically, high TBA level in HCC tissue was found to be associated with more invasive and poor survival in HCC patients. Mechanistic study showed that bile acid induced autophagy by targeting the AMPK/mTOR pathway in HCC cells. Therefore, our results suggest that bile acid may promote HCC invasion via activation of autophagy and the level of bile acid may serve as a potential useful indicator for prognosis of HCC patients.",Lemur tyrosine kinase 2 acts as a positive regulator of NF-κB activation and colon cancer cell proliferation.,https://www.ncbi.nlm.nih.gov/pubmed/30980866,Cancer letters,2019 05 03,"Lemur tyrosine kinase 2 (LMTK2) belongs to both protein kinase and tyrosine kinase families. LMTK2 is less studied and little is known about its function. Here we demonstrate that LMTK2 modulates NF-κB activity and functions to promote colonic tumorigenesis. We found that LMTK2 protein was abundant in colon cancer cells and LMTK2 knockdown (LMTK2-KD) inhibited proliferation of colon cancer cells through inactivating NF-κB. In unstimulated condition, LMTK2 modulated NF-κB through inhibiting phosphorylation of p65 at Ser468. Mechanistically, LMTK2 phosphorylated protein phosphatase 1A (PP1A) to prevent PP1A from dephosphorylating p-GSK3β(Ser9). The p-GSK3β(Ser9) could not phosphorylate p65 at Ser468, which maintained the basal NF-κB activity. LMTK2 also modulated TNFα-activated NF-κB. LMTK2-KD repressed TNFα-induced IKKβ phosphorylation, IκBα degradation and NF-κB activation, implying that LMTK2 modulates TNFα-activated NF-κB via IKK. These results suggest that LMTK2 modulates basal and TNFα-induced NF-κB activities in different mechanisms. Animal studies show that LMTK2-KD suppressed colon cancer cell xenograft growth, decreased PP1A phosphorylation and increased p-p65(Ser468). Our results reveal the role and underlying mechanism of LMTK2 in colonic tumorigenesis and suggest that LMTK2 may serve as a potential target for chemotherapy of colon cancer.",TRPM4 channel and cancer.,https://www.ncbi.nlm.nih.gov/pubmed/30980865,Cancer letters,2019 05 03,"The TRPM4 channel has been extensively studied in cerebral diseases such as stroke, head injury and multiple sclerosis. In the heart, gain-of-function mutations of TRPM4 are a cause of familial cardiac block. Recently, evidence has emerged to support the role of TRPM4 in certain types of cancer, such as prostate cancer and large B cell lymphoma. The expression of TRPM4 could mediate certain behaviors of cancer cells such as migration and invasion. However, the mechanisms are largely unknown. As a nonselective monovalent cation channel, TRPM4 upregulation and activation enhance sodium entry, which leads to depolarization of the membrane potential. The membrane potential is critical in regulating calcium influx, and a disturbed calcium homeostasis is always associated with cancer cell behaviors. Research on TRPM4 channels in cancer is at a very early stage. In this review, we summarize the expression of TRPM4 in various cancers as well as our current understanding of TRPM4 in cancer. The potential mechanisms of the TRPM4 channel in regulating calcium homeostasis in cancer cells are further discussed in detail. Targeting the TRPM4 channel can be a novel way of managing cancer metastasis via disrupting calcium signaling pathways.",Mycoplasma infection promotes tumor progression via interaction of the mycoplasmal protein p37 and epithelial cell adhesion molecule in hepatocellular carcinoma.,https://www.ncbi.nlm.nih.gov/pubmed/30980864,Cancer letters,2019 05 03,"Hepatocellular carcinoma (HCC) is currently the third leading cause of cancer death worldwide. To study how mycoplasma infection affects HCC progression, we investigated the characteristics of mycoplasma-infected tumor tissues and circulating tumor cells (CTCs) in HCC patients. The mycoplasmal membrane protein p37 showed significant correlations with higher histologic stages and vascular invasion and predicted poor disease-free survival of HCC patients. p37-positive CTCs were detected in 42 out of 47 HCC patients (89%). p37-positive circulating cells were also detected in 4 out of 10 healthy donors (40%), and all were epithelial cell adhesion molecule (EpCAM)-positive. In HCC patients, most of p37-negative CTCs (95%) showed intermediate phenotype with neither EpCAM nor vimentin expression, but p37-positive CTCs were EpCAM-positive (44%), vimentin-positive (32%), and both negative (24%), suggesting that EpCAM-positive CTCs are enriched with mycoplasma infection. Mycoplasma infection promoted migratory capacity of HCC cells with increased expression of EpCAM. Immunoprecipitation analysis revealed that p37 associates with EpCAM. The results suggest that mycoplasma infection promotes tumor progression in HCC patients via interaction of the mycoplasmal p37 and EpCAM.",Bisphenol A disrupts mitotic progression via disturbing spindle attachment to kinetochore and centriole duplication in cancer cell lines.,https://www.ncbi.nlm.nih.gov/pubmed/30980863,Toxicology in vitro : an international journal published in association with BIBRA,2019 06 08,"Bisphenol A [BPA, 2,2-bis-(4-hydroxyphenyl)propane] is one of the most prevalent synthetic environmental estrogens; as an endocrine disruptor, it is associated with endocrine-related cancers including breast, ovarian, and prostate. However, the mechanisms by which BPA contributes to carcinogenesis are unclear. This study aims to clarify its toxic effects on mitotic cells and investigate the molecular mechanism. In vitro effects of BPA on mitotic progression were examined by performing experiments on HeLa cells. Proteins involved in mitotic processes were detected by Western blot, live cell imaging, and immunofluorescence staining. The results showed that BPA increased chromosomal instability by perturbing mitotic processes such as bipolar spindle formation and spindle microtubule attachment to the kinetochore. BPA prolonged mitotic progression by disturbing spindle attachment and concomitant activating spindle assembly checkpoint (SAC). Mechanistically, BPA interfered proper localization of HURP to the proximal ends of spindle microtubules, Kif2a to the minus ends of spindle microtubules, and TPX2 on the mitotic spindle. This mislocalization of microtubule associated proteins (MAPs) is postulated to lead to spindle attachment failure. Furthermore, BPA caused multipolar spindle by inducing centriole overduplication and premature disengagement. Although BPA acts as an estrogen receptor (ER) agonist, mitotic defects caused by BPA occurred in an ER-independent manner. Our findings indicate that BPA may stimulate carcinogenesis not only by acting as an endocrine disruptor but also by increasing chromosomal instability during mitosis.",Angiotensin II type I receptor antibodies in thoracic transplantation.,https://www.ncbi.nlm.nih.gov/pubmed/30980862,Human immunology,2019 04 16,"Angiotensin II type I receptor (AT1R) is a critical player in regulating vasoconstriction, blood pressure, sodium retention.

The role of AT1R antibodies in transplantation is first reported in kidney transplant, and then identified in heart and lung transplants. Mechanical circulatory support devices (MCS) can also stimulate production of AT1R antibodies. AT1R antibodies may negatively impact graft or patient survival through mechanisms independent of the classical complement activation."

Additionally, the pre-existing risk factors may enhance POCD. Gut microbiota-derived metabolite trimethylamine N-oxide (TMAO) has recently been shown to contribute to the pathogenesis of many diseases by increasing oxidative stress and inflammation in the peripheral tissues. Here we examined whether the presence of elevated circulating TMAO would influence surgery-induced cognitive decline. Aged rats were treated with vehicle or TMAO for 3 weeks. After two weeks of treatment, these rats underwent sham-operation or laparotomy. One week after surgery, rats underwent laparotomy exhibited hippocampal-dependent cognitive dysfunction as evidenced by reduced contextual freezing time, which was associated with elevated plasma proinflammatory cytokine levels, increased microglia-mediated neuroinflammation and reactive oxygen species (ROS) production in the hippocampus. Treatment with TMAO, which elevated plasma TMAO before and 1 week after surgery, further increased microglia-mediated neuroinflammation and ROS production in the hippocampus, resulting in exaggerated cognitive dysfunction in laparotomy group but not in sham-operation group. Moreover, TMAO treatment decreased expression of antioxidant enzyme methionine sulfoxide reductase (Msr) A in both groups. The results suggest that the presence of elevated circulating TMAO downregulates antioxidant enzyme MsrA in the hippocampus, which may increase the susceptibility to surgery-induced oxidative stress, contributing to exaggerations of neuroinflammation and cognitive decline in aged rats following surgery. Interventions to reduce circulating TMAO in the perioperative period may be a novel strategy to prevent the exaggeration of cognitive decline in elderly patients with high circulating TMAO.",miR-126-3p sensitizes glioblastoma cells to temozolomide by inactivating Wnt/β-catenin signaling via targeting SOX2.,https://www.ncbi.nlm.nih.gov/pubmed/30980849,Life sciences,2019 05 13,"The acquired drug resistance has been regarded as a main barrier for the effective treatment of temozolomide (TMZ) in glioblastoma (GBM).

The classical motor symptoms include resting tremors, bradykinesia, rigidity and postural instability and are accompanied by the loss of dopaminergic neurons and Lewy pathology. Diminished neurotransmitter level, oxidative stress, mitochondrial dysfunction and perturbed protein homeostasis over time worsen the disease manifestations in elderly people. Current management strategies aim to provide symptomatic relief and to slow down the disease progression. However, no pharmacological breakthrough has been made to protect dopaminergic neurons and associated motor circuitry components. Deep brain stimulation, stem cells-derived dopaminergic neurons transplantation, gene editing and gene transfer remain promising approaches for the potential management of neurodegenerative disease. Toxin or genetically induced rodent models replicating Parkinson's disease pathology are of high predictive value for translational research. This review addresses the current understanding, management strategies and the Parkinson's disease models for translational research.

However, there is an increasing desire to understand mode-of-action (MOA) for DNT effects; thus, this short communication describes initial work on a neuronal differentiation assay. Basically, our laboratory used the human NT2/D1 cell line to develop an assay to evaluate toxicants for effects on all-trans retinoic acid (RA)-induced neuronal differentiation. Based on literature reports, we selected a neuronal protein, neuronal class III β-tubulin (β3-tubulin), as a marker of differentiation. For this assay, cultured RA-treated NT2 cells were trypsinized to individual cells, methanol fixed, and labeled with a β3-tubulin specific monoclonal antibody (TUJ1). Characterization studies using 100,000 cells/sample showed that NT2 cells had appreciable expression of β3-tubulin starting around day 7 of the differentiation process with a peak expression noted around day 12. Methylmercury, 22(R)-hydroxycholesterol, N-(4-hydroxyphenol)retinamide (4HPR), and 9-cis retinoic acid were selected as initial test compounds. Of these, only 9-cis RA, which is known to affect the RA pathway, was positive for specific impacts on differentiation. These results demonstrate the feasibility of using a flow cytometry method targeting specific cellular biomarkers for evaluating effects on neuronal differentiation. Additional assays are needed to detect compounds targeting other (non-RA) neuronal differentiation pathways.

The glucose transporter 1 (GLUT1) is responsible for glucose uptake in a wide variety of cells and appears to be regulated in a tissue specific manner. Therefore, a better understanding of GLUT1 regulation within its various cellular environments is essential for developing therapeutic strategies to treat disorders associated with glucose homeostasis. Previous findings suggest that plasma membrane subdomains called lipid rafts may play a role in regulation of GLUT1 uptake activity. While studying this phenomenon in L929 mouse fibroblast cells, we observed that GLUT1 associates with a low density lipid microdomain distinct from traditionally-defined lipid rafts. These structures are not altered by cholesterol removal with methyl-β-cyclodextrin and lack resistance to cold Triton X-100 extraction. Our data indicate that the GLUT1-containing membrane microdomains in L929 cells, as well as GLUT1's basal activity, are instead sphingolipid-dependent, being sensitive to both myriocin and sphingomyelinase treatment. These microdomains appear to be organized primarily by their lipid composition, as disruption of the actin cytoskeleton or microtubules does not alter the association of GLUT1 with them. Furthermore, the association of GLUT1 with these microdomains appears not to require palmitoylation or glycosylation, as pharmacologic inhibition of these processes had no impact on GLUT1 density in membrane fractions. Importantly, we find no evidence that GLUT1 is actively translocated into or out of low density membrane fractions in response to acute activation in L929 cell.","Production, purification and characterization of an elastin-like polypeptide containing the Ile-Lys-Val-Ala-Val (IKVAV) peptide for tissue engineering applications.",https://www.ncbi.nlm.nih.gov/pubmed/30980843,Journal of biotechnology,2019 05 10,"Elastin-like polypeptides (ELPs) are biocompatible-engineered polypeptides, with promising interest in tissue engineering due to their intrinsic biological and physical properties, and their ease of production. The IKVAV (Ile-Lys-Val-Ala-Val) laminin-1 sequence has been shown to sustain neuron attachment and growth. In this study, the IKVAV adhesion sequence, or a scrambled VKAIV sequence, were incorporated by genetic engineering in the structure of an ELP, expressed in Escherichia coli and purified. The transition temperatures of the ELP-IKVAV and ELP-VKAIV were determined to be 23 °C. Although the phase transition was fully reversible for ELP-VKAIV, we observed an irreversible aggregation for ELP-IKVAV. The corresponding aggregates shared some characteristics with amyloid-like polypeptides. The two ELPs were then reacted with functionalized polyethylene glycol (PEG) to form hydrogels. These hydrogels were characterized for rheological properties, tested with cultures of rat primary sensory neurons, and implanted subcutaneously in mice for 4 weeks. Sensory neurons cultured on high IKVAV concentration hydrogels (20%) formed longer neurite than those of neurons grown on hydrogels containing the scrambled IKVAV sequence. Finally, in vivo evaluation showed the absence of detectable inflammation. In conclusion, this functionalized ELP-IKVAV biomaterial shows interesting properties for tissue engineering requiring neurotization.",Advertising models in the act of eating: How the depiction of different eating phases affects consumption desire and behavior.,https://www.ncbi.nlm.nih.gov/pubmed/30980842,Appetite,2019 06 08,"In print advertising, the use of static pictures depicting models eating food is common practice. However, less is known about how the depiction of models in different phases of consumption (holding food, moving food to mouth, taking a bite, chewing on food) affects consumers. Theories have proposed that not only do individuals mimic actions, but they also adopt the goals and the motivational patterns underlying these actions by observing others. Building on this view, we hypothesized that consumers' desire to eat a food product and their actual consumption of a food product would be greater when the model in the picture was close to engaging in consumption and that desire and actual consumption would be reduced when the model was shown in the process of finishing consumption. In two studies, we found that the participants experienced an increased desire to eat the depicted food (Study 1) and ate more of the advertised food (Study 2) when the model was shown to engage in eating food compared with when the model was shown during completion of a consumption episode. In addition, the results of Study 1 suggest that even subtle differences such as holding food compared with putting food into the mouth might affect consumers' desire to eat. Overall, our results suggest that advertisements may affect consumers' motivation to engage in food intake differently depending on which consumption state they show with the depiction of a model close to engagement in food consumption being most likely to trigger a desire for consumption and an actual engagement in food intake.",Waking qEEG to assess psychophysiological stress and alertness during simulated on-call conditions.,https://www.ncbi.nlm.nih.gov/pubmed/30980841,International journal of psychophysiology : official journal of the International Organization of Psychophysiology,2019 06 07,"On-call schedules are associated with stress and disrupted sleep.

Our present study examines the feasibility of utilizing our 3-dimensional (3D) corneal stromal construct, which consists of human corneal fibroblasts (HCF) and their self-assembled matrix, to observe the development and maturation of human corneal endothelial cells (HCEndoCs) in a co-culture model. Three-dimensional HCF constructs were created by growing the HCFs on Transwell membranes in Eagles' minimum essential medium (EMEM) + 10% FBS + 0.5 mM Vitamin C (VitC) for about 4 weeks. HCEndoCs, either primary (pHCEndoC) or cell line (HCEndoCL), were either seeded in chamber slides, directly on the Transwell membranes, or on the 3D HCF constructs and cultivated for 5 days or 2 weeks. The HCEndoCs that were seeded directly on the Transwell membranes were exposed indirectly to HCF by culturing the HCF on the plate beneath the membrane. Cultures were examined for morphology and ultrastructure using light and transmission electron microscopy (TEM). In addition, indirect-immunofluorescence microscopy (IF) was used to examine tight junction formation (ZO-1), maturation (ALDH1A1), basement membrane formation (Laminin), cell proliferation (Ki67), cell death (caspase-3), and fibrotic response (CTGF). As expected, both pHCEndoCs and HCEndoCLs formed monolayers on the constructs; however, the morphology of the HCEndoCLs appeared to be similar to that seen in vivo, uniform and closely packed, whereas the pHCEndoCs remained elongated. The IF data showed that laminin localization was present in the HCEndoCs' cytoplasm as cell-cell contact increased, and when they were grown in the 3D co-culture, the beginnings of what appears to be a continuous DM-like structure was observed. In addition, in co-cultures, ALDH1A1-positive HCEndoCs were present, ZO-1 expression localized within the tight junctions, minimal numbers of HCEndoCs were Ki67-or Caspase-3-positive, and CTGF was positive in both the HCEndoCs cytoplasm and the matrix of the co-culture. Also, laminin localization was stimulated in HCEndoCs upon indirect stimuli secreted by HCF. The present data suggests our 3D co-culture model is useful for studying corneal endothelium maturation in vitro since the co-culture promotes new DM-like formation, HCEndoCs develop in vivo-like characteristics, and the fibrotic response is activated. Our current findings are applicable to understanding the implications of corneal endothelial injection therapy, such as if the abnormal DM has to be removed from the patient, the newly injected endothelial cells will seed onto the wound area and deposit a new DM-like membrane. However, caution should be observed and as much of the normal DM should be left intact since removal of the DM can cause a posterior stromal fibrotic response.",PEDF peptides promote photoreceptor survival in rd10 retina models.,https://www.ncbi.nlm.nih.gov/pubmed/30980815,Experimental eye research,2019 06 14,"The purpose of the study is to evaluate the protective properties of PEDF peptide fragments on rd10 mouse models of retinal degeneration ex vivo. Human recombinant PEDF and synthetic peptides were used. Rd10 retinal explants as well as wild-type retinal explants treated with zaprinast to mimic the rd10 photoreceptor cell death were employed. PEDF protein was intravitreally administered into rd10 mice. Outer nuclear layer thickness measurements in retinal sections, TUNEL labeling in retinal explants, western blots and immunofluorescence with retinal samples were performed. PEDF protein levels in the RPE of rd10 mice decreased with age (P15 - P25). Levels of PEDF receptor PEDF-R declined in the photoreceptor inner segments from rd10 relative to wild-type mice at P25. PEDF administration increased the outer nuclear layer thickness of rd10 retinas in vivo and decreased the number of TUNEL+ nuclei of photoreceptors in rd10 retinal explant cultures, both relative to untreated controls. Peptides containing the PEDF neurotrophic region decreased the number of TUNEL+ photoreceptors in both rd10 and zaprinast-induced cell death ex vivo models, while peptides without the neurotrophic region and/or lacking affinity for PEDF-R were ineffective in protecting photoreceptors. Thus, retinal explants are a valuable system to evaluate PEDF activity. Short peptides with the photoreceptor-protective property of PEDF may prove useful for the development of therapeutic agents for photoreceptor protection in retinal degenerations.",High-throughput screening identifies compounds that protect RPE cells from physiological stressors present in AMD.,https://www.ncbi.nlm.nih.gov/pubmed/30980814,Experimental eye research,2019 04 13,"Dysfunction and eventual loss of retinal pigment epithelial (RPE) cells is a hallmark of atrophic age-related macular degeneration (AMD), and linked to oxidative and nitrosative damage. Herein, we use high-throughput screening (HTS) to identify compounds that protect human RPE cells from oxidative stress-induced cell death and elucidate the possible mechanism of action. HTS was used to identify compounds that protect RPE cells from oxidative damage. We then tested the identified compound(s) in models of RPE stress, including tert-butyl hydroperoxide (TBHP) exposure, UV-B-mediated light damage and nitrosative stress to the basement membrane using ARPE-19 cells, primary human RPE and induced-pluripotent stem cell (iPSC)-derived RPE cells from patients with AMD. Quantitative reverse transcription polymerase chain reaction (qRT-PCR) was used to detect gene expression of oxidative stress- and apoptosis-related genes and mitochondrial function was measured by the Seahorse XF96 analyzer to elucidate possible mechanisms of action. Five thousand and sixty-five compounds were screened, and of these, 12 compounds were active based on their ability to improve cell viability after exposure to TBHP. After chemical structure review, we identified ciclopirox olamine as a potent inhibitor of oxidative damage to RPE cells. Ciclopirox olamine increased cell viability in ARPE-19 cells treated with TBHP, UV-B light or on nitrite-treated ECM by 1.68-fold, 1.54-fold and 4.3-fold, respectively (p < 0.01). Treatment with TBHP altered expression of genes related to oxidative stress and apoptosis, which was reversed by pretreatment with ciclopirox olamine. Ciclopirox olamine improved mitochondrial function in TBHP-exposed ARPE-19 cells and iPSC-derived RPE cells. Ciclopirox olamine protected primary human RPE cells and iPSC-derived RPE cells from the oxidative stress or damaged basement membrane. HTS of bioactive FDA-approved libraries and follow-up studies can be used to identify small molecules (including ciclopirox olamine) that protect RPE cells exposed to various stressors associated with disease progression of AMD. This strategy can be used to identify potential compounds for treatment and prevention of AMD."

In this study, 302 stool samples were collected from West African Dwarf and Sokoto Red breeds of goats in Ogun State, Nigeria, and screened for Giardia intestinalis coproantigens using enzyme-linked immunosorbent assay (ELISA). The genotypes of G. intestinalis in faecal samples collected from 152 goats raised on selected farms were identified by polymerase chain reaction (PCR) amplification and sequence analyses of the small subunit ribosomal RNA (ssu rRNA), glutamate dehydrogenase (gdh), triosephosphate isomerase (tpi) and β-giardin (bg) genes. Based on ELISA, an overall prevalence of 45.7% was recorded with the infection rates in pre-weaned (60.2%) and post-weaned goat kids (51.5%) being significantly (p < 0.05) higher than in adults (28.2%). Giardia intestinalis DNA was amplified in 31.6% and 29.6% of goat faeces at the ssu rRNA and gdh loci respectively. These were genotyped at the ssu rRNA locus as assemblages B (n = 13) and E (n = 36). Similar results were observed at the gdh locus except that eight isolates contained assemblage E mixed with either assemblage A or B. Additionally, sub-assemblages BI (n = 7) and BIII (n = 2) were identified with up to four single nucleotide polymorphisms (SNPs) occurring in these isolates. Multilocus genotypes (MLG) of all assemblage E isolates were identified using the ssu rRNA and gdh loci while MLG of all isolates containing assemblage B and mixed assemblages were determined after further typing at the tpi and bg loci. Forty-two MLG isolates were identified and these comprised 32, 8 and 2 (sub)-assemblage E, BI and BIII respectively. All isolates with mixed assemblages at the gdh locus were consequently designated as assemblage E by MLG. The assemblage E isolates from goats were genetically related to isolates from cattle, sheep and goats while the assemblage B isolates were related to isolates of human, pig and lemur origin. This suggests that G. intestinalis isolated from goats bred in Ogun State, Nigeria may be capable of cross-species transmission and may be of zoonotic importance.",Ubiquitin-Specific Protease 15 Maintains Transforming Growth Factor-β Pathway Activity by Deubiquitinating Transforming Growth Factor-β Receptor I during Wound Healing.,https://www.ncbi.nlm.nih.gov/pubmed/30980801,The American journal of pathology,2019 05 06,"Wound healing is a process of cutaneous barrier reconstruction that occurs after skin injury and involves diverse cytokines and cell types. Similar to several deubiquitinating enzymes, ubiquitin-specific protease 15 (USP15) can remove ubiquitin chains from specific proteins to rescue them from degradation. However, the regulatory role of USP15 in wound healing remains unclear. We investigated the dynamic function of USP15 in wound healing. First, in USP15 knockout mice, we observed a significant delay in wound closure. In addition, inhibition of cell proliferation and migration was observed in USP15-silenced human dermal fibroblasts. Through RNA sequencing, it was revealed that the transforming growth factor-β (TGF-β) pathway was suppressed after USP15 knockdown. Furthermore, coimmunoprecipitation demonstrated that USP15 could interact with TGF-β receptor I and promote its deubiquitination, thereby maintaining TGF-β signaling pathway activity by enhancing TGF-β receptor I stability. These observations shed light on the function and mechanisms of USP15-mediated modulation of the TGF-β signaling pathway during wound healing, thus providing a novel potential target for the treatment of refractory wounds.","Cognitive Decline, Cerebral-Spleen Tryptophan Metabolism, Oxidative Stress, Cytokine Production, and Regulation of the Txnip Gene in 3xTg-AD Mice.",https://www.ncbi.nlm.nih.gov/pubmed/30980800,The American journal of pathology,2019 05 10,"Pathologic inflammation in response to injury, infection, or oxidative stress is a proposed mechanism relating cognitive decline to dementia. The kynurenine pathway and thioredoxin-interacting protein (TXNIP) activity regulate inflammation and neurotoxicity in Alzheimer disease (AD). We examined cognitive deficits, kynurenine pathway mediators, TXNIP, and oxidative damage in the cerebrum and spleen, as well as inflammatory cytokine production by stimulated splenocytes, from female 3xTg-AD mice in early and late stages of disease progression. We also characterized tissue-specific epigenetic regulation of Txnip gene expression in the cerebrum and spleen. Herein, we show that cognitive deficits in 7-month-old 3xTg-AD mice are associated with a stable increase in cerebrum and spleen tryptophan metabolites, with a concomitant increase in amyloid β 40 (Aβ40)/Aβ42 and tau/hyperphosphorylated tau pathologies and a coordinated reduction in spleen proinflammatory cytokine production in 17-month-old mice. The enhanced cerebrum TXNIP expression is associated with increased histone acetylation, transcription factor (Aβ42 or CTCF) binding, and Txnip promoter hypomethylation, whereas the attenuated spleen TXNIP expression is associated with increased histone methylation, reduced CTCF binding, and Txnip promoter hypermethylation. These results suggest a causal relationship among epigenomic state, TXNIP expression, cerebral-spleen tryptophan metabolism, inflammatory cytokine production, and cognitive decline; and they provide a potential mechanism for Txnip gene regulation in normal and pathologic conditions, suggesting TXNIP levels may be a useful predictive or diagnostic biomarker for Aβ40/Aβ42 targeted AD therapies.",A chromosome-scale genome assembly and dense genetic map for Xenopus tropicalis.,https://www.ncbi.nlm.nih.gov/pubmed/30980799,Developmental biology,2019 06 01,"The Western clawed frog Xenopus tropicalis is a diploid model system for both frog genetics and developmental biology, complementary to the paleotetraploid X. laevis.

The improved genome enables the mapping of specific traits (e.g., the sex locus or Mendelian mutants) and the characterization of chromosome-scale synteny with other tetrapods. We also report an improved annotation of the genome that integrates deep transcriptome sequence from diverse tissues and stages. The exon-intron structures of these genes are highly conserved relative to both X. laevis and human, as are chromosomal linkages (""synteny"") and local gene order.

We aimed to investigate the mechanisms of these two miRNAs in chordoma cells. Patient-derived chordoma cell lines were established in vitro. Expressions of miR-140-3p or miR-155-5p were measured by quantitative real-time polymerase chain reaction and their functions were inhibited by antagomir treatment. Malignancy of chordoma cells was assessed by cell viability, proliferation, apoptosis, colony formation and transwell invasion assays as well as western blot evaluating epithelial-to-mesenchymal transition. Sensitivity of chordoma cells was assessed by cell viability and apoptosis assays. Protein level of phosphatase and tensin homolog (PTEN) and phosphoinositide 3-kinase (PI3K)- protein kinase B (Akt)-mammalian target of rapamycin (mTOR) pathway were assessed by western blot. Interaction of miR-140-3p and miR-155-5p with the 3' untranslated region of PTEN mRNA was verified by luciferase reporter assay. BpV was used to inhibit PTEN activity. The expressions of miR-140-3p and miR-155-5p were enhanced in chordoma cells and inhibited by treatment of antagomirs. Inhibition of miR-140-3p or miR-155-5p significantly reduced the malignancy of patient-derived chordoma cells and activation of PI3K-Akt-mTOR signaling, while significantly increasing the sensitivity to doxorubicin, paclitaxel or cisplatin treatment and PTEN protein level. PTEN was verified as a direct target of miR-140-3p and miR-155-5p and its inhibition by bpV treatment largely abrogated the chemotherapy sensitizing effect of anti-miR-140-3p or anti-miR-155-5p on chordoma cells. Collectively, inhibition of miR-140-3p or miR-155-5p significantly reduced the malignancy of chordoma cells and increased their sensitivity to chemotherapy by releasing PTEN expression.",Short chain fatty acid butyrate uptake reduces expressions of prostanoid EP4 receptors and their mediation of cyclooxygenase-2 induction in HCA-7 human colon cancer cells.,https://www.ncbi.nlm.nih.gov/pubmed/30980797,European journal of pharmacology,2019 05 04,"Microbiota produce short chain fatty acids (SCFAs), which are known to maintain gut homeostasis, by the fermentation of dietary fiber in the human colon. Among SCFAs, butyrate has been considered as the most physiologically effective SCFA in colorectal epithelial cells for growth and differentiation. Here we show that the E-type prostanoid 4 (EP4) receptor expression level is regulated by different concentrations of butyrate, but not by other SCFAs, in human colon cancer HCA-7 cells, through sodium-coupled monocarboxylate transporter-1 (SMCT-1)-mediated uptake followed by the activation of histone acetyltransferase: cAMP response element binding protein-binding protein/p300. Of particular interest, the prostanoid EP4 receptors are known to be expressed in normal colorectal crypt epithelial cells and maintain intestinal homeostasis by preserving mucosal integrity, while they are also known to be involved in the early stage of carcinogenesis. Thus, the links between butyrate and the expression of prostanoid EP4 receptors are both important factors for maintaining homeostasis. Based on in silico analysis, almost half of colorectal cancer tissues have lost the expression of SMCT-1 mRNA when compared with healthy corresponding tissues. Therefore, with the collapse of homeostasis systems such as a decrease in the concentration of butyrate in colorectal tissues, or reduced butyrate uptake, there is a possibility of early stage colorectal cancer development; the transformation of normal cells to the cancerous phenotype may be due to the overexpression of prostanoid EP4 receptors followed by excessive cyclooxygenase-2 induction, which are caused by a reduced amount of butyrate and/or its uptake, in/around colorectal epithelial cells.",Double-balloon enteroscopy-facilitated cyanoacrylate-injection endotherapy of small-bowel varices: an international experience from 2 European tertiary centers (with videos).,https://www.ncbi.nlm.nih.gov/pubmed/30980796,Gastrointestinal endoscopy,2019 04 13,"Small-bowel varices (SBV) are an uncommon consequence of portal hypertension.

Although fetal heart rate monitoring (cardiotocography, CTG) became available a half century ago, its interpretation often differs between institutions and countries, its diagnostic accuracy needs improvement, and a technology to help reduce the unnecessary obstetric interventions that have accompanied the CTG is urgently needed. During the second half of the 20th century, key findings in animal experiments captured the close relationship between myocardial glycogenolysis, myocardial workload, and ST changes, thus demonstrating that ST waveform analysis of the fetal ECG can provide information on oxygenation of the fetal myocardium and establishing the physiological basis for the use of ECG in intrapartum fetal surveillance. Six randomized controlled trials (RCTs), 10 meta-analyses, and more than 20 observational studies have evaluated the technology developed based on this principle. Nonetheless, despite this intensive assessment, differences in study protocols, inclusion criteria, enrollment rates, clinical guidelines, use of fetal blood sampling, and definitions of key outcome parameters, as well as inconsistencies in RCT data handling and statistical methodology, have made this voluminous evidence difficult to interpret. Enormous resources spent on RCTs have failed to guarantee the generalizability of their results to other settings or their ability to reflect everyday clinical practice. The latest meta-analysis used revised data from primary RCTs and data from the largest RCT from the USA to demonstrate a significant reduction of metabolic acidosis rates by 36% (odds ratio, 0.64; 95% confidence interval 0.46-0.88) and of operative vaginal delivery rates by 8% (relative risk, 0.92; 95% confidence interval, 0.86-0.99), compared with CTG alone.",Flow injection ionization-tandem mass spectrometry-based estimation of a panel of lysophosphatidylcholines in dried blood spots for screening of X-linked adrenoleukodystrophy.,https://www.ncbi.nlm.nih.gov/pubmed/30980791,Clinica chimica acta; international journal of clinical chemistry,2019 06 16,Elevated blood C26:0 lysophosphatidylcholine (LPC) is a diagnostic marker for X-linked adrenoleukodystrophy (X-ALD).

MicroRNA-34a (miR-34a), a potential effector of the p53 tumor suppressor gene, is extensively studied for its suppression of cell growth. In the present study, we investigated the function of miR-34a in human lens epithelial cells. Following confirming that miR-34a expression was increased in a P53 dependent manner in human lens epithelial cells after treatment with doxorubicin, we demonstrated that overexpression of miR-34a in the human lens epithelial cell line HLE B3 led to a significant decrease in cell proliferation and migration, with the use of MTS and transwell migration assays. Moreover, HGF enhanced the proliferation and migration of human lens epithelial cells. miR-34a was found to downregulate the expression of c-Met protein by Western blotting. Furthermore, overexpression of miR-34a downregulated the levels of phosphorylated Akt, phosphorylated ERK1/2 and other cell cycle regulators. miR-34a expression was significantly reduced in posterior capsule opacification (PCO) clinical samples. These results demonstrate that miR-34a may act as a suppressor in PCO by regulating human lens epithelial cell proliferation and migration through downregulation of c-Met."

While the comparative biology of neural crest cells has been studied for a century and a half beginning with their discovery by Wilhelm His in 1868, most of our understanding of their development and function has come from a small number of species. Thus, critical gaps exist in our understanding of how neural crest cells mediate evolution and development.

Previously, large-scale SEREX (serological identification of antigens by recombinant cDNA expression cloning) screenings have identified anti-FIR autoantibodies in the sera of cancer patients. In the present study, we revealed the presence and significance of anti-FIR (FIR/FIRΔexon2) Abs in the sera of patients with esophageal squamous cell carcinoma (ESCC). Our results were validated by an amplified luminescence proximity homogeneous assay using sera of patients with various cancer types. We revealed that anti-FIRΔexon2 Ab had higher sensitivity than anti-FIR Ab. Receiver operating characteristic (ROC) analysis was applied for evaluating the use of anti-FIRΔexon2 Ab as candidate markers such as anti-p53 Ab and carcinoembryonic antigen, and the highest area under the ROC curve was observed in the combination of anti-FIRΔexon2 Ab and anti-p53 Ab. In summary, our results suggest the use of anti-FIRΔexon2 Ab in combination with the anti-p53 Ab as a predictive marker for ESCC. The area under the ROC curve was further increased in the advanced stage of ESCC. The value of anti-FIRΔexon2 autoantibody as novel clinical indicator against ESCC and as a companion diagnostic tool is discussed.",Treatment and monitoring of children with chronic hepatitis C in the Pre-DAA era: A European survey of 38 paediatric specialists.,https://www.ncbi.nlm.nih.gov/pubmed/30980773,Journal of viral hepatitis,2019 05 17,"The burden of paediatric Hepatitis C virus (HCV) infection across Europe is unknown, as are current policies regarding monitoring and treatment. This collaborative study aimed to collect aggregate data to characterise the population of ≤18-year-olds with HCV infection in specialist follow up in a 12-month period (2016) across the PENTAHep European consortium, and investigate current policies around monitoring and treatment. A cross-sectional, web-based survey was distributed in April 2017 to 50 paediatricians in 19 European countries, covering patients' profile, and monitoring and treatment practices. Responses were received from 38/50 clinicians collectively caring for 663 children with chronic HCV infection of whom three-quarters were aged ≥6 years and 90% vertically infected. HCV genotype 1 was the most common (n 380; 57.3%), followed by genotype 3, 4 and 2. Seventeen children (3%) with chronic HCV infection were diagnosed with cirrhosis, and six were reported to have received liver transplantation for HCV-related liver disease. The majority (n 425; 64.1%) of the European children with HCV infection remained treatment-naive in 2016. Age affected clinicians' attitudes towards treatment; 94% reported being willing to use direct-acting antivirals, if available, in adolescents (aged ≥11 years), 78% in children aged 6-10 and 42% in those 3-5 years of age (Pearson correlation coefficient -0.98; P 0.0001). This survey provides the largest characterisation of the population of children in clinical follow-up for chronic HCV infection in Europe, alongside important contextual information on their management and treatment. Discussion is needed around strategies and criteria for use of direct-acting antivirals in these children.",The future of organ perfusion and re-conditioning.,https://www.ncbi.nlm.nih.gov/pubmed/30980772,Transplant international : official journal of the European Society for Organ Transplantation,2019 05 08,"Organ preservation and re-conditioning using machine perfusion technologies continue to generate promising results in terms of viability assessment, organ utilization and improved initial graft function. Here, we summarize the latest findings and study the results of ex-vivo/ex-situ hypothermic (HMP) and normothermic machine perfusion (NMP) in the area of abdominal organ transplantation (kidney, liver, pancreas and intestine). We also consider the potential role of normothermic regional perfusion (NRP) to re-condition donors after circulatory death organs before retrieval. The findings from clinical studies reported to date suggest that machine perfusion will offer real benefits when compared with conventional cold preservation. Several randomized trials are expected to report their findings within the next 2 years which may shed light on the relative merits of different perfusion methods and could indicate which perfusion parameters may be most useful to predict organ quality and viability. Further work is needed to identify composite endpoints that are relevant for transplanted organs that have undergone machine preservation. Multi-centre trials to compare and analyse the combinations of NRP followed by HMP and/or NMP, either directly after organ retrieval using transportable devices or when back-to-base, are needed. The potential applications of machine preservation technology beyond the field of solid organ transplantation are also considered.",Alveolar ridge preservation in the posterior maxilla reduces vertical dimensional change: A randomized controlled clinical trial.,https://www.ncbi.nlm.nih.gov/pubmed/30980771,Clinical oral implants research,2019 06 06,To test whether or not alveolar ridge preservation reduces vertical changes in the posterior maxilla compared to spontaneous healing following tooth extraction.,Implant treatment in immunosuppressed renal transplant patients: A prospective case-controlled study.,https://www.ncbi.nlm.nih.gov/pubmed/30980770,Clinical oral implants research,2019 06 06,The aim of this clinical study was to evaluate long-term outcomes of implant therapy in a cohort of immunosuppressed renal transplant patients compared with a matched control group.,Development and validation of nomogram for prediction of malignant transformation in oral leukoplakia: A large-scale cohort study.,https://www.ncbi.nlm.nih.gov/pubmed/30980769,Journal of oral pathology & medicine : official publication of the International Association of Oral Pathologists and the American Academy of Oral Pathology,2019 05 15,"Oral leukoplakia (OL) is the well-known disorder of oral mucosa, which has potential to be malignant and can lead to squamous cell carcinoma (OSCC).
