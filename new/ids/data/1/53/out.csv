Characterisation was completed by proteomic analysis of growth factors and cytokines, evaluation of matrix components and protease inhibition, immunohistochemistry, and in vitro release of key growth factors and cytokines. To evaluate the effect of released factors on cells found within the microenvironment, in vitro assays including: cell proliferation, migration, gene expression, protein production, and intracellular pathway activation were used; additionally, responses of fibroblasts in the context of inflammation were measured. We found that released factors from dehydrated amnion/chorion membranes (dACM) stimulated cell proliferation, migration, and altered gene and protein expression profiles of cells important for wound repair in vitro. When cells were cultured in the presence of pro-inflammatory cytokines, the addition of releasate from dACM resulted in an altered production of cytokines, including a reduction of pro-inflammatory regulated on activation, normal T cell expressed and secreted (RANTES). In sum, the results presented here characterise the components of dACM, and in vitro studies were used to evaluate interactions of dACM with cell types important in wound healing.",Unveiling the Intrinsic Catalytic Activities of Single-Gold-Nanoparticle-Based Enzyme Mimetics.,https://www.ncbi.nlm.nih.gov/pubmed/30854788,Angewandte Chemie (International ed. in English),2019 04 24,"Gold nanoparticles (AuNPs) have been demonstrated to serve as effective nanomaterial-based enzyme mimetics (nanozymes) for a number of enzymatic reactions under mild conditions. The intrinsic glucose oxidase and peroxidase activities of single AuNPs and Ag-Au nanohybrids, respectively, were investigated by single NP collision electrochemical measurements. A significantly high turnover number of nanozymes was obtained from individual catalytic events compared with the results from the classical, ensemble-averaged measurements. The unusual enhancement of catalytic activity of single nanozymes is believed to originate from the high accessible surface area of monodispersed NPs and the high activities of carbon-supported NPs during single-particle collision at a carbon ultramicroelectrode. This work introduces a new method for the precise characterization of the intrinsic catalytic activities of nanozymes, giving further insights to the design of high-efficiency nanomaterial catalysts.",Endothall behavior in Myriophyllum spicatum and Hydrilla verticillata.,https://www.ncbi.nlm.nih.gov/pubmed/30854787,Pest management science,2019 04 17,"Endothall has been used to control submersed aquatic plants since 1960, providing broad-spectrum control of aquatic weeds. Although endothall is considered a contact herbicide, many field observations suggest that it might have systemic activity. The goals of this research were to determine endothall's (i) absorption characteristics, (ii) translocation from shoots to roots, and (iii) potential for desorption in Eurasian watermilfoil (EWM), monoecious and dioecious hydrilla.",Cancer-testis antigens in canine histiocytic sarcoma and other malignancies.,https://www.ncbi.nlm.nih.gov/pubmed/30854786,Veterinary and comparative oncology,2019 06 03,"Cancer-testis antigens (CTAs) are a category of self proteins aberrantly expressed in diverse malignancies, mostly solid tumours, due to epigenetic de-repression. Normally expressed only in fetal or gametogenic tissues, CTAs are tantalizing immunotherapy targets, since autoimmunity risks appear minimal. Few prevalent CTAs have been identified in human hematologic cancers, and just two in their veterinary counterparts. We sought to discover new CTAs in canine hematologic cancers such as histiocytic sarcoma (HS) and lymphoma to foster immunotherapy development. To accomplish this, the ligandome binding the dog leukocyte antigen (DLA)-88*508:01 class I allele overexpressed in an HS line was searched by mass spectrometry to identify possible CTA-derived peptides, which could serve as CD8+ T-cell epitopes. Twenty-two peptides mapped to 5 human CTAs and 12 additional proteins with CTA characteristics. Expression of five promising candidates was then evaluated in tumour and normal tissue by quantitative and end-point RT-PCR. The ortholog of an established CTA, IGF2BP3, had unexpectedly high expression in peripheral blood mononuclear cells (PBMCs). Four other testis-enhanced proteins were also assessed. AKR1E2, SPECC1 and TPX2 were expressed variably in HS and T-cell lymphoma biopsies, but also at high levels in critical tissues, including kidney, brain and marrow, diminishing their utility. A more tissue-restricted candidate, NT5C1B, was detected in T-cell lymphomas, but also at low levels in some normal dog tissues. These results illustrate the feasibility of discovering canine CTAs by a reverse approach, proceeding from identification of MHC class I-presented peptides to a comparative RNA expression survey of tumours and normal tissues.",Pitfalls of using the risk ratio in meta-analysis.,https://www.ncbi.nlm.nih.gov/pubmed/30854785,Research synthesis methods,2019 04 11,"For meta-analysis of studies that report outcomes as binomial proportions, the most popular measure of effect is the odds ratio (OR), usually analyzed as log(OR). Many meta-analyses use the risk ratio (RR) and its logarithm because of its simpler interpretation. Although log(OR) and log(RR) are both unbounded, use of log(RR) must ensure that estimates are compatible with study-level event rates in the interval (0, 1). These complications pose a particular challenge for random-effects models, both in applications and in generating data for simulations. As background, we review the conventional random-effects model and then binomial generalized linear mixed models (GLMMs) with the logit link function, which do not have these complications. We then focus on log-binomial models and explore implications of using them; theoretical calculations and simulation show evidence of biases. The main competitors to the binomial GLMMs use the beta-binomial (BB) distribution, either in BB regression or by maximizing a BB likelihood; a simulation produces mixed results. Two examples and an examination of Cochrane meta-analyses that used RR suggest bias in the results from the conventional inverse-variance-weighted approach. Finally, we comment on other measures of effect that have range restrictions, including risk difference, and outline further research.",FAM175B promotes apoptosis by inhibiting ATF4 ubiquitination in esophageal squamous cell carcinoma.,https://www.ncbi.nlm.nih.gov/pubmed/30854784,Molecular oncology,2019 05 07,"FAM175B is a reported regulator of p53 and suppresses tumorigenesis in numerous types of cancer, but very little is known about its function in esophageal squamous cell carcinomas (ESCCs), almost 70% of which exhibit mutations in p53. Here, we report that FAM175B expression is downregulated in high-grade intraepithelial neoplasia (t = 2.44, P = 0.031) and ESCC (t = 5.664, P < 0.001) tissues relative to that in adjacent normal esophageal tissues. Exogenous expression of FAM175B in ESCC cells resulted in a decrease in proliferation rate, inhibition of colony formation, and an increase in apoptosis rate. Knockdown of FAM175B produced the opposite results. Furthermore, confocal microscopy and coimmunoprecipitation assay showed that Activating transcription factor 4 (ATF4) colocalized and interacted with FAM175B. Ubiquitination assays revealed that FAM175B inhibited ubiquitin-dependent ATF4 degradation and elevated ATF4 protein level. Finally, luciferase reporter experiments further clarified that FAM175B promoted CHOP expression in an ATF4-dependent manner. Accordingly, the proapoptotic activity of FAM175B was significantly rescued by treatment with si-ATF4 and the CHOP inhibitor 4-PBA. In summary, FAM175B inhibited ATF4 ubiquitination and promoted ESCC cell apoptosis in a p53-independent manner. FAM175B expression loss may be an early diagnostic biomarker in ESCC patients.",Thrombopoietin receptor agonist switch in children with persistent and chronic severe immune thrombocytopenia: A retrospective analysis in a large tertiary center.,https://www.ncbi.nlm.nih.gov/pubmed/30854783,Pediatric blood & cancer,2019 04 18,"We retrospectively analyzed sequential therapy with romiplostim and eltrombopag in 23 children with immune thrombocytopenia: switching from romiplostim to eltrombopag (10 patients) or vice versa (13 patients). The median age of patients at enrollment in the study was 5.6 years (2-15 years). Switching from romiplostim to eltrombopag was effective in eight (80%) patients, whereas switching from eltrombopag to romiplostim was effective in eight (62%) patients.

The diagnosis of NCGS/NCWS requires a symptomatic reaction to gluten, or wheat-containing food, and remission of symptoms with gluten or wheat challenge, in patients in whom celiac disease and wheat allergy have been excluded. There have been several randomized clinical trials (RCT) addressing this issue which have produced controversial results. In this issue of Neurogastroenterology and Motility, a double-blind placebo-controlled randomized trial in patients with suspected NCGS on GFD, did not reproduce symptoms after gluten intake compared to placebo. This mini-review addresses outstanding issues related to the diagnosis of NCGS/NCWS as well as areas of interest for future studies that could explain, in part, the controversy in this area.","Ca2 PbGa8 O15 : Rational Design, Synthesis, and Structure Determination of a Purely Tetrahedra-Based Intergrowth Oxide.",https://www.ncbi.nlm.nih.gov/pubmed/30854778,Angewandte Chemie (International ed. in English),2019 04 12,"Intergrowth oxides, like Aurivillius, Ruddlesden-Popper phase, comprise functional layers and exhibit interesting physical properties. The hitherto known intergrowth structures mainly were composed of closed-packing of oxygen ions, and it is very challenging to develop new types of intergrowth structures. We proposed the possible match between the tridymite and grossite, both of which are purely tetrahedra-based structures. We synthesized Ca2 PbGa8 O15 ((Ca0.5 Pb0.5 Ga2 O4 )2 (CaGa4 O7 )) and its structure was solved by ab-initio method. Pb2+ is vitally important to stabilize this first example of tetrahedra-based intergrowth oxide. The appropriate size difference between Pb2+ and Ca2+ causes the layered type cationic ordering, and reduced the thermodynamic potential, in addition, the high hybridization between Pb 6s6p and O 2p orbitals further consolidate the covalency of the tetrahedra-base framework."

Policymakers are therefore increasingly looking to other payment schemes to ensure a more efficient delivery of health care. This study tests whether context plays a role for overprovision under FFS. Using a laboratory experiment involving medical students, we test the extent of overprovision under FFS when the subjects face different fee sizes, patient types, and market conditions. We observe that decreasing the fee size has an effect on overprovision under both market conditions. We also observe that patients who are harmed by excess treatment are at little risk of overprovision. Finally, when subjects face resource constraints but still have an incentive to overprovide high-profit services, they hesitate to do so, implying that the presence of opportunity costs in terms of reduced benefits to other patients protects against overprovision. Thus, this study provides evidence that the risk of overprovision under FFS depends on fee sizes, patients' health profiles, and market conditions.","Exclusive breast-feeding and postnatal changes in blood sodium, ketone, and glucose levels.",https://www.ncbi.nlm.nih.gov/pubmed/30854754,Pediatrics international : official journal of the Japan Pediatric Society,2019 05 27,"Blood sodium and ketone are parameters of dehydration and fasting, respectively.

Although individual differences in WM performance have previously been linked to the blood oxygenation level-dependent (BOLD) response across several large-scale brain networks, the unique and shared contributions of each large-scale brain network to efficient WM processes across different cognitive loads remain elusive. Using a WM paradigm and functional magnetic resonance imaging (fMRI) from the Human Connectome Project, we proposed a framework to assess the association and shared-association strength between imaging biomarkers and behavioral scales. Association strength is the capability of individual brain regions to modulate WM performance and shared-association strength measures how different regions share the capability of modulating performance. Under higher cognitive load (2-back), the frontoparietal executive control network (FPN), dorsal attention network (DAN), and salience network showed significant positive activation and positive associations, whereas the default mode network (DMN) showed the opposite pattern, namely, significant deactivation and negative associations. Comparing the different cognitive loads, the DMN and FPN showed predominant associations and globally shared-associations. When investigating the differences in association from lower to higher cognitive loads, the DAN demonstrated enhanced association strength and globally shared-associations, which were significantly greater than those of the other networks. This study characterized how brain regions individually and collaboratively support different cognitive loads.",Effect of oral supplementation of probiotic strains of Lactobacillus rhamnosus and Enterococcus faecium on the composition of the faecal microbiota of foals.,https://www.ncbi.nlm.nih.gov/pubmed/30854744,Journal of animal physiology and animal nutrition,2019 04 25,"Effects of probiotics on the intestinal microbiota of foals are yet insufficiently studied. The aim of this study was to investigate whether supplementation of Lactobacillus rhamnosus (DSM 7133) and Enterococcus faecium (DSM 7134) influences the bacterial composition of the faecal microbiota of foals. A total of 34 newborn foals were randomly assigned to the placebo group (PG, n = 16) and the treatment group (TG, n = 18). From day 1 to day 14 of life, foals orally received 3 ml of either a probiotic preparation (1.05 × 109 CFU E. faecium and 4.50 × 108 CFU L. rhamnosus) or placebo (carrier) once a day. Faeces were collected directly from the rectum immediately after birth (meconium) and at day 14 and day 56 of life. Samples of 12 foals per group were selected for microbiological analysis. DNA was extracted and used for polymerase chain reaction-denaturing gradient gel electrophoresis (PCR-DGGE) and quantitative PCR. No DNA or amplicons were obtained from meconium. There were no differences in richness of bands and Shannon index of diversity regarding the Clostridium cluster XIVa between groups. Cluster analysis and principal coordinate analysis of DGGE data showed a clear effect of age. Band-based similarity of bacterial clusters (Dice coefficient) decreased from day 14 to day 56 of life (p < 0.001) in PG foals only resulting in lower similarity in PG versus TG foals when 2 month old (p < 0.01). Five of thirty re-amplified bands were identified on species level. Others were assigned either to family (mainly Lachnospiraceae) or genus level (Akkermansia). The bands related to Akkermansia muciniphila or Akkermansia spp. appeared almost in all DGGE profiles. Two-week supplementation of the probiotic preparation to foals had no significant impact on the composition of the faecal microbiota but it appears to have prevented the reduction of bacterial similarity between 2 and 8 weeks of age observed in not treated foals.",The center of olfactory bulb-seeded α-synucleinopathy is the limbic system and the ensuing pathology is higher in male than in female mice.,https://www.ncbi.nlm.nih.gov/pubmed/30854742,"Brain pathology (Zurich, Switzerland)",2019 04 10,"At early disease stages, Lewy body disorders are characterized by limbic vs. brainstem α-synucleinopathy, but most preclinical studies have focused solely on the nigrostriatal pathway. Furthermore, male gender and advanced age are two major risk factors for this family of conditions, but their influence on the topographical extents of α-synucleinopathy and the degree of cell loss are uncertain. To fill these gaps, we infused α-synuclein fibrils in the olfactory bulb/anterior olfactory nucleus complex-one of the earliest and most frequently affected brain regions in Lewy body disorders-in 3-month-old female and male mice and in 11-month-old male mice. After 6 months, we observed that α-synucleinopathy did not expand significantly beyond the limbic connectome in the 9-month-old male and female mice or in the 17-month-old male mice. However, the 9-month-old male mice had developed greater α-synucleinopathy, smell impairment and cell loss than age-matched females. By 10.5 months post-infusion, fibril treatment hastened mortality in the 21.5-month-old males, but the inclusions remained centered in the limbic system in the survivors. Although fibril infusions reduced the number of cells expressing tyrosine hydroxylase in the substantia nigra of young males at 6 months post-infusion, this was not attributable to true cell death. Furthermore, mesencephalic α-synucleinopathy, if present, was centered in mesolimbic circuits (ventral tegmental area/accumbens) rather than within strict boundaries of the nigral pars compacta, which were defined here by tyrosine hydroxylase immunolabel. Nonprimate models cannot be expected to faithfully recapitulate human Lewy body disorders, but our murine model seems reasonably suited to (i) capture some aspects of Stage IIb of Lewy body disorders, which displays a heavier limbic than brainstem component compared to incipient Parkinson's disease; and (ii) leverage sex differences and the acceleration of mortality following induction of olfactory α-synucleinopathy."

They are prolific sources of highly valuable compounds with fascinating chemical structures. Due to their balanced nutritional compositions and health benefits, they are increasingly being used as functional food ingredients. Carotenoid-based pigments and polyunsaturated fatty acids (PUFAs) are examples of high-value nutrients that can be accumulated abundantly in microalgae. Here, the effects of potassium chloride-induced stress on the productions of lipids and carotenoids in the green microalga of the Chlorococcaceae family were investigated. Under normal BG11 medium, this green microalga strain TISTR 9500 accumulated high levels of PUFA and primary carotenoid lutein. Stress tests revealed that KCl enhanced and modulated lipid and carotenoid accumulation levels. The liquid chromatography-tandem mass spectrometry (LC-MS/MS) analysis revealed that secondary carotenoids astaxanthin and canthaxanthin were robustly produced under KCl stress with the similar content of lutein. Further, this stress led to a significant increase in the total FA amount with the higher proportion of unsaturated FA than saturated FA. Thus, this green microalga could be an attractive and alternative natural biosource for canthaxanthin and astaxanthin, as well as for functional lipids. This article is protected by copyright.

Lectins may bind to immune receptors on the surface of insect hemocytes, thus inducing or even disabling common immune functions including hemocyte counts, nodulation/encapsulation, phenoloxidase activity, and synthesis of antimicrobial peptides. In the present study, effect of Polygonum persicaria L. agglutinin (PPA) on immune responses of Helicoverpa armigera Hübner was investigated by feeding artificial diet treated to the larvae. Subsequently hemocyte count and expression of some immune-related genes were considered for analyses. The two groups of larvae including control and PPA-treated (1%) were divided into four subgroups of intact, Tween-80 injected, latex-bead injected and Beauveria bassiana-injected. Except for intact larvae, the highest numbers of total and differential hemocyte counts were recorded 12 hr postinjection, however, the PPA-fed larvae showed a significantly lower hemocyte counts compared to control. The number of nodules in PPA-fed larvae was significantly lower than control, but the injected larvae of both control and PPA showed the highest nodulation 24 hr postinjection. Although the highest activity of phenoloxidase was observed 12 and 24 hr postinjection but its activity significantly decreased in PPA-fed larvae compared to control. Gene expression of antimicrobial peptides including attacin, cecropin, and peptidoglycan receptor proteins were significantly decreased in artificial diet-fed larvae containing PPA and then injected by B. bassiana spores and latex bead compared to control. These results clearly indicate adverse effects of PPA on immune responses in H. armigera.","Characterization of tanning behavior assessed via online survey: Attitudes, habits, and preventive measures with focus on sunscreen use.",https://www.ncbi.nlm.nih.gov/pubmed/30854722,"Photodermatology, photoimmunology & photomedicine",2019 03 26,Incidence of melanoma is increasing globally.

While representing a significant fraction of the drugs in the market, very few have been deliberately designed to interact covalently with their biological target. One of the enzymes that have been both covalently and noncovalently targeted is the Neural Precursor Cell Expressed Developmentally Downregulated gene 4-1 (Nedd4-1). This enzyme has been found to have multiple physiological implications, including its involvement in cancer invasion. A critical gap still remains in the molecular understanding of the structural mechanism upon the covalent and noncovalent binding to Nedd4-1. In this study, we explore the most optimal binding mechanism in the inhibition of the catalytic site of the Nedd4-1. Our results exhibited a greater stability in the covalent complex compared with the noncovalent complex. This was supported by the secondary structure elements that were more dominant in the covalently inhibited complex. This complex disclosed an optimal free binding energy landscape, induced by the catalytic site energy contributions that showed to be more favorable. The insights demonstrating the above binding mechanism of Nedd4-1 establishes covalent inhibition as the preferred method of inhibition of the enzyme. This investigation aids in the understanding of the structural mechanism of Nedd4-1 inhibition and would assist in the design of more potent covalent inhibitors at the catalytic site of Nedd4-1.",Deep cerebellar stimulation reduces ataxic motor symptoms in the shaker rat.,https://www.ncbi.nlm.nih.gov/pubmed/30854718,Annals of neurology,2019 04 16,"Degenerative cerebellar ataxias (DCAs) affect up to 1 in 5,000 people worldwide, leading to incoordination, tremor, and falls.

In view of the need for highly performing and transformable cell lines, QOEC may potentially act as an alternative bioreactor platform to the existing ones, for example, to the Chinese hamster ovary. The aim of this work was to characterize QOECs and their response to nucleofection with a nonviral plasmid DNA carrying the human interferon-α 2a gene (hIFNλ2a), in vitro. Primary QOEC cultures from laying quails (10-15 weeks old) were characterized by their proliferation rate, doubling time, and multilineage differentiation. Electroporation to cell nuclei (nucleofection) was used to deliver nonviral plasmid DNA containing a reporter GFP and hIFN under the ovalbumin promoter. The posttransfection analysis included polymerase chain reaction, Western blot analysis, and liquid chromatography coupled to tandem mass spectrometry. QOEC showed a typical epithelial characteristic in a primary 2D monolayer culture system and retained secretive potential up to the first passage. QOEC showed differentiation into osteoblastic lineage after stimulation. The nucleofection mean efficiency was low (2.3%). Differences of up to 10% in the proteomic profiles between nontransfected and transfected QOEC were found, the most important of these were related to the absence of keratins and cell-adhesion proteins in the transfected QOEC. Concluding, with the practical information provided here, QOEC have the potential to serve as an avian secreting cellular platform. QOEC may be further transformed to cell lineage to meet the requirement for a stable, electrocompetent, and transfectable model. The first proteomic comparison of QOEC delivered in this study showed, in the majority, a stable proteome of the nontransfected vs transfected QOEC."

Altogether, the 323 sequences displayed 53 different haplotypes (45 in Ethiopia, 14 in Egypt, eight in Peru and six in Brazil). Among the four populations, Egyptian donkeys possessed the highest haplotype diversity (0.910 ± 0.032), followed by Brazilian donkeys (0.879 ± 0.060). The Clade I haplotypes dominated in Peruvian donkeys (65%), whereas Clade II haplotypes dominated in Brazilian donkeys (67%). Estimates of FST values showed a high genetic differentiation between Peruvian and Brazilian donkey populations (FST  = 0.4066), which could be explained by the complex introduction history of South American donkeys. Phylogeographic analysis indicates that northeast Africa could be the most probable domestication center for Clade I donkeys. Analysis of molecular variance confirmed a weak genetic structure in domestic donkey populations among four continents (Europe, Asia, Africa and South America).",Involvement of GASL1 in postoperative distant recurrence of gastric adenocarcinoma after gastrectomy distal resection and the possible mechanism.,https://www.ncbi.nlm.nih.gov/pubmed/30854698,Journal of cellular biochemistry,2019 03 11,"As a cancer-related long noncoding RNA, functionality of GASL1 has only been characterized in liver cancer. Our study aimed to investigate the possible involvement of GASL1 in postoperative recurrence of gastric adenocarcinoma. A total of 112 gastric adenocarcinoma patients with a tumor located in the distal third who received gastrectomy distal resection in The Second Hospital of Dalian Medical University from January 2012 to January 2015 were included in this study. Patients were followed up for 3 years. Another 56 healthy people were also included to serve as a control group. Blood was extracted from each subject on the day of discharge, on the day of diagnosis of recurrence or at the end of follow-up. The GASL1 expression vector was transfected into gastric adenocarcinoma cell lines. It was observed that plasma levels of GASL1 were significantly lower, while plasma levels of transforming growth factor-β1 (TGF-β1) were significantly higher in patients than in healthy controls on the day of discharge. Patients with distant recurrence showed significantly lower plasma levels of GASL1 and significantly higher plasma levels of TGF-β1 compared with patients with local recurrence and patients without recurrence. During follow-up, plasma levels of GASL1 and TGF-β1 were negatively correlated in patients with distant recurrence but not in other groups of patients. GASL1 overexpression inhibited, while TGF-β1 treatment promoted cell migration and invasion. Overexpression of GASL1 led to downregulated and GASL1 knockdown led to upregulated TGF-β1. However, TGF-β1 showed no significant effects on GASL1 expression. We conclude that GASL1 may participate in the distant recurrence of gastric adenocarcinoma through the interactions with TGF-β1.","Total flavonoids, extracted from Polygonum knotweed L, exert beneficial hepatoprotection against liver injury.",https://www.ncbi.nlm.nih.gov/pubmed/30854697,Journal of cellular biochemistry,2019 06 14,"Hepatic function is of great concern in metabolic and immunological homeostasis. Traditionally, medical management to liver damage may benefit from phytomedicine, such as Chinese herbs. In southern China, Polygonum perfoliatum L can contribute to alleviating pathological symptoms of liver disease, such as hepatitis. However, bioactive compounds of hepatoprotection in this herb are still less to be investigated. In this study, clinical data of patients with drug-induced liver injury were collected on the basis of serological analyses. In addition, we extracted and identified total flavonoids from Polygonum perfoliatum L (TFPPL) before implementing biochemical experiments in vivo. In human data, the blood contents of liver function enzymes were visibly elevated, and the percentage of immune cells were abnormally changed. The data from the animal study showed that TFPPL-treated carbon tetrachloride-exposed mice resulted in reduced absolute liver mass and lowered blood levels of liver functional enzymes (alanine transaminase and aspartate transaminase). In enzyme-linked immunosorbent assay, the comparable data indicated that serological tumor necrosis factor α (TNF-α), interleukin 6, and heat shock protein 90 (Hsp90) contents were reduced in TFPPL-treated mice. In histopathological observations, TFPPL-treated mice exhibited reduced hepatocellular Hsp90, TNF-α, nuclear factor κ-light-chain-enhancer of activated B cells-p65 positive cells, and lowered Bax and caspase-3-labeled cells in the livers. Further, intrasplenic integrin β1, 5'-nucleotidase, and antigen KI-67 positive cells were increased after TFPPL treatments. Taken together, our present findings demonstrate that herb-extracted TFPPL exert potential hepatoprotective activities against chemical-induced liver damage in mice, possibly through the pharmacological mechanisms of inhibiting inflammatory stress and apoptosis, inactivating Hsp90 bioactivity in the liver, and improving splenic immunocompetence.",Differences in plasma and peritoneal fluid proteomes identifies potential biomarkers associated with survival following strangulating small intestinal disease.,https://www.ncbi.nlm.nih.gov/pubmed/30854696,Equine veterinary journal,2019 03 28,"Strangulating small intestinal disease (SSID) carries a poor prognosis for survival in comparison to other types of colic, particularly if resection is required.

In this study, the regulatory role of miR-19a-3p in RA was investigated. Quantitative polymerase chain reaction analysis of human blood samples showed that the level of miR-19a-3p was significantly lower in the RA patients compared with that in healthy patients (P < 0.05). In RA fibroblast-like synoviocytes (RAFLS), miR-19a-3p and suppressor of cytokine signaling 3 (SOCS3) were also downregulated and upregulated, respectively, compared with those of normal FLS. Transfection of miR-19a-3p mimic in RAFLS inhibited cell proliferation and promoted cell apoptosis. TargetScan identified SOCS3 as a target of miR-19a-3p, which was confirmed by dual-luciferase assay. Western blot indicated that SOCS3 protein level was significantly decreased after miR-19a-3p overexpression. Moreover, SOCS3 silencing through siRNA transfection also enhanced cell proliferation, meanwhile inhibiting RAFLS apoptosis. In addition, SOCS3 overexpression abrogated the effects of miR-19a-3p overexpression on cell proliferation and apoptosis, corroborating that SOCS3 acts as a downstream effector in the miR-19a-3p-mediated function of RAFLS. These findings suggest that miR-19a-3p plays an important role in RA, and the miR-19a-3p/SOCS3 axis may become a potential therapeutic target for RA.",Relationship between resolution of non-alcoholic steatohepatitis and changes in lipoprotein sub-fractions: a post-hoc analysis of the PIVENS trial.,https://www.ncbi.nlm.nih.gov/pubmed/30854694,Alimentary pharmacology & therapeutics,2019 04 14,"Dyslipidaemia is frequent in non-alcoholic steatohepatitis (NASH); however, it is unclear if improvement in liver histology is associated with favourable changes in cardiovascular disease (CVD) risk.",Comparing the clinical success rate of the dorsolateral approach to the medial approach for injection of the centrodistal joint in the horse.,https://www.ncbi.nlm.nih.gov/pubmed/30854693,Equine veterinary journal,2019 04 15,Centrodistal joint injection is an important component of lameness evaluation and treatment.

However, the molecular mechanisms and function of LINC00961 in the TSCC progression remain unknown. In this study, we proved that LINC00961 expression was downregulated in TSCC cells (Tca8113, SCC1, SCC-4, and SCC-15) compared with normal tissue. In addition, we showed that LINC00961 expression was downregulated in TSCC samples compared with matched normal tissues. Moreover, ectopic expression of LINC00961 decreased TSCC cell growth and invasion and suppressed epithelial-mesenchymal transition in TSCC cell. Furthermore, we indicated that overexpression of LINC00961 decreased β-catenin expression. Knockdown of LINC00961 promoted cell proliferation and invasion partly via promoting the Wnt/β-catenin signaling pathway. These results suggested that LINC00961 was downregulated in TSCC tissues and acted as a tumor suppressor gene in the development of TSCC.","Effects of obesity on sperm retrieval, early embryo quality and clinical outcomes in men with nonobstructive azoospermia undergoing testicular sperm aspiration-intracytoplasmic sperm injection cycles.",https://www.ncbi.nlm.nih.gov/pubmed/30854691,Andrologia,2019 06 03,"The objective of this study was to assess the effects of body mass index (BMI) on sperm retrieval, early embryo quality and clinical outcomes in patients with nonobstructive azoospermia (NOA) undergoing testicular sperm aspiration-intracytoplasmic sperm injection (TESA-ICSI).

We found no significant relationship between BMI and sperm retrieval rate (22.4%, 24.3% and 25.1%, p = 0.327) or sperm motility. Among the 705 patients with NOA who underwent TESA-ICSI cycles, obese individuals had lower T levels and higher E2 levels than normal-weight and overweight individuals. However, there were no significant differences in other male hormones (follicle stimulating hormone [FSH], luteinizing hormone [LH], or prolactin [PRL]) among the groups. We also found that the sperm parameters, embryo quality and clinical outcomes of patients with NOA undergoing TESA-ICSI were not influenced by high BMI levels. In conclusion, this study demonstrated a lack of obvious effects of obesity on sperm retrieval, early embryo quality and clinical outcomes in infertile men undergoing TESA-ICSI cycles, although T and E2 levels were affected."

Over-activation of acid sphingomyelinase (ASM)/ceramide (Cer) pathway takes centre stage in hepatocyte injury entailed by various stimulus. We aimed to investigate whether it mediated the noise elicited liver disorder on infrastructure, lipid metabolism, apoptosis, and oxidative stress. Mice were exposed to broad band noise (20-20k Hz, 90-110 dB) for 1, 3, 5 or 7 days by 3 hr/d. Doxepin hydrochloride (DOX), an ASM inhibitor was given by 5 mg/kg/d gavage. We showed that 5 or 7 days intense, broad band noise exposure caused significant infrastructure derangement and lipid droplets storage in hepatocytes. The content of cholesterol, free fatty acids or triglyceride was increased significantly in liver tissue upon noise stimulation. Moreover, the noise promoted apoptosis and superoxide generation in hepatocytes significantly, enhancing activity of aspartate aminotransferase (AST) or alanine amino transferase (ALT) in serum. Acid sphingomyelinase activity and Cer generation in liver tissue were elevated by noise exposure, which was normalized with DOX administrated. Accordingly, DOX alleviated steatosis, apoptosis, oxidative stress and enzymatic change in hepatocytes or serum of noise exposed mice substantially. In summary, our results suggest the ASM/Cer pathway contributes to the broad band noise elicited liver damage in mice.",Quercetin attenuates oxidative stress-induced apoptosis via SIRT1/AMPK-mediated inhibition of ER stress in rat chondrocytes and prevents the progression of osteoarthritis in a rat model.,https://www.ncbi.nlm.nih.gov/pubmed/30854676,Journal of cellular physiology,2019 03 11,"Apoptosis of chondrocytes are the main initiator of osteoarthritis (OA) and can be explained by oxidative stress and endoplasmic reticulum (ER) stress, thus the pharmacological interventions aimed at inhibiting of these pathways may be a promising approach for the management of OA. Quercetin is a member of the flavonoid family and has antioxidant and anti-inflammatory properties in degenerative diseases. However, its effects and potential mechanisms on the pathological process of OA are not very clear. The present study aimed to investigate the protective effects of quercetin on OA and the underlying mechanisms. The tert-butyl hydroperoxide (TBHP)-stimulated rat chondrocytes and destabilization of the medial meniscus OA rat model was used to explore the protective effects of quercetin. Our results showed that quercetin treatment can attenuate oxidative stress, ER stress, and associated apoptosis. Moreover, quercetin inhibited ER stress through activating the sirtuin1/adenosine monophosphate-activated protein kinase (SIRT1/AMPK) signaling pathway. The protective effects of quercetin were also observed in OA rat model which is evidenced by abolished cartilage degeneration and decreased chondrocytes apoptosis in the knee joints. Our results suggested that quercetin is a promising treatment for OA.","Self-reported affective biases, but not all affective performance biases, are present in depression remission.",https://www.ncbi.nlm.nih.gov/pubmed/30854675,The British journal of clinical psychology,2019 03 11,"Individuals with active major depressive disorder (MDD) have shown affective biases in cognitive flexibility and memory, particularly for negatively valenced stimuli.

Wear-particle-induced osteoclastogenesis has been shown to be the primary cause of periprosthetic osteolysis that eventually leads to aseptic prosthesis loosening. Therefore, inhibiting osteoclastogenesis is a promising strategy to control periprosthetic osteolysis. The possible mechanism of action of rhoifolin on osteoclastogenesis and titanium particle-induced calvarial osteolysis was examined in this study. The in vitro study showed that rhoifolin could strongly suppress the receptor activators of nuclear factor-κB (NF-κB) ligand-stimulated osteoclastogenesis, hydroxyapatite resorption, F-actin formation, and the gene expression of osteoclast-related genes. Western blot analysis illustrated that rhoifolin could attenuate the NF-κB and mitogen-activated protein kinase pathways, and the expression of transcriptional factors nuclear factor of activated T cells 1 (NFATc1) and c-Fos. Further studies indicated that rhoifolin inhibited p65 translocation to the nucleus and the activity of NFATc1 and NF-κB rhoifolin could decrease the number of tartrate-resistant acid phosphate-positive osteoclasts and titanium particle-induced C57 mouse calvarial bone loss in vivo. In conclusion, our results suggest that rhoifolin can ameliorate the osteoclasts-stimulated osteolysis, and may be a potential agent for the treatment of prosthesis loosening.",Identification and functional characterization of Histone-like DNA-binding protein in Nocardia seriolae (NsHLP) involved in cell apoptosis.,https://www.ncbi.nlm.nih.gov/pubmed/30854666,Journal of fish diseases,2019 05 10,"Nocardia seriolae, a facultative intracellular bacterium, is the main pathogen of fish nocardiosis. Bioinformatic analysis showed that the histone-like DNA-binding protein (HLP) gene of N. seriolae (nshlp) encoded a secreted protein and might target the mitochondria in the host cell. To further study the preliminary function of HLP in N. seriolae (NsHLP), the gene cloning, extracellular products identification, subcellular localization, overexpression and apoptosis detection assay were carried out in this study. Mass spectrometry analysis of the extracellular products from N. seriolae showed that NsHLP was a secreted protein. Subcellular localization of HLP-GFP fusion proteins mainly assembled in the nucleus, which indicated that the NsHLP was co-located with the nucleus rather than mitochondria in fathead minnow (FHM) cells. Notably, the expression of NsHLP had changed the distribution of mitochondria into lumps in the FHM cell. In addition, apoptotic features were found in the transfected FHM cells by overexpression of NsHLP. Quantitative assays of mitochondrial membrane potential value, caspase-3 activity and pro-apoptotic genes mRNA (Bad, Bid and Bax) expression level demonstrated that the cell apoptosis was induced in the transfected FHM cells. All the results presented in this study provided insight on the function of NsHLP, which suggested that it may participate in the cell apoptosis regulation and play an important role in the pathogenesis of N. seriolae.",Endoplasmic Reticulum Stress Causes Liver Cancer Cells to Release Exosomal miR-23a-3p and Up-regulate Programmed Death Ligand 1 Expression in Macrophages.,https://www.ncbi.nlm.nih.gov/pubmed/30854665,"Hepatology (Baltimore, Md.)",2019 04 25,"Endoplasmic reticulum (ER) stress promotes tumor cell escape from immunosurveillance. However, the underlying mechanisms remain unknown. We hypothesized that ER stress induces hepatocellular carcinoma (HCC) cells to release exosomes, which attenuate antitumor immunity by modulating the expression of programmed death ligand 1 (PD-L1) in macrophages. In this study, we demonstrated that expression of several ER stress markers (glucose-regulated protein 78, activating transcription factor 6, protein kinase R-like ER kinase, and inositol-requiring enzyme 1α) was up-regulated in HCC tissues and negatively correlated with the overall survival and clinicopathological scores in patients with HCC. Expression of ER stress-related proteins positively correlated with CD68+ macrophage recruitment and PD-L1 expression in HCC tissues. High-throughput sequencing analysis identified miR-23a-3p as one of the most abundant microRNAs in exosomes derived from tunicamycin (TM)-treated HCC cells (Exo-TMs). miR-23a-3p levels in HCC tissues negatively correlated with overall survival. Treatment with Exo-TMs up-regulated the expression of PD-L1 in macrophages in vitro and in vivo. Bioinformatics analysis suggests that miR-23a-3p regulates PD-L1 expression through the phosphatase and tensin homolog (PTEN)-phosphatidylinositol 3-kinase-protein kinase B (AKT) pathway. This notion was confirmed by in vitro transfection and coculture experiments, which revealed that miR-23a-3p inhibited PTEN expression and subsequently elevated phosphorylated AKT and PD-L1 expression in macrophages. Finally, coculture of T cells with Exo-TM-stimulated macrophages decreased CD8+ T-cell ratio and interleukin-2 production but increased T-cell apoptosis in vitro. Conclusion: ER-stressed HCC cells release exosomes to up-regulate PD-L1 expression in macrophages, which subsequently inhibits T-cell function through an exosome miR-23a-PTEN-AKT pathway. Our findings provide insight into the mechanism how tumor cells escape from antitumor immunity."

N. (2019). Responses of ant communities to disturbance: Five principles for understanding the disturbance dynamics of a globally dominant faunal group. Journal of Animal Ecology 88, 350-362. Disturbance is a key driver of ecosystem dynamics. Whereas plant community responses to disturbance are relatively well understood, the same does not hold for animals. With rapid changes affecting our world's ecosystems, predicting the response of important ecological groups to ongoing disturbance should be a focus. In particular, ants are ecosystem engineers that create habitats for other organisms and have a crucial role to play in nutrient cycling. Nevertheless, our understanding of ant community response to disturbance is, at best, fragmented. Moreover, how ant communities respond to disturbance on a global scale appears highly idiosyncratic. The perspective article by Andersen (Journal of Animal Ecology 88, 350-362.) proposes five general principles that can help elucidate ant community response to disturbance. Specifically, this synthesis deepens our understanding of how contemporary disturbances, ecological processes and the evolutionary and biogeographic history of lineages interact to influence ant community structure."

In some cases, an alternate reservoir host amplifies pathogen loads and drives disease transmission to less competent hosts in a process called pathogen spillover. Spillover is frequently associated with multi-host disease systems where a single species is more tolerant of infection and more competent in pathogen transmission compared to other hosts. Pathogen spillover must be driven by biotic factors, including host and community characteristics, yet biotic factors interact with the abiotic environment (e.g., temperature) to create disease. Despite its fundamental role in disease dynamics, the influence of the abiotic environment on pathogen spillover has seldom been examined. Improving our understanding of disease processes such as pathogen spillover hinges on disentangling the effects of interrelated biotic and abiotic factors over space and time. We applied 10 yr of fine-scale microclimate, disease, and tree community data in a path analysis to investigate the relative influence of biotic and abiotic factors on pathogen spillover for the emerging infectious forest disease sudden oak death (SOD). Disease transmission in SOD is primarily driven by the reservoir host California bay laurel, which supports high foliar pathogen loads that spillover onto neighboring oak trees and create lethal canker infections. The foliar pathogen load and susceptibility of oaks is expected to be sensitive to forest microclimate conditions. We found that biotic factors of pathogen load and tree diversity had relatively stronger effects on pathogen spillover compared to abiotic microclimate factors, with pathogen load increasing oak infection and tree diversity reducing oak infection. Abiotic factors still had significant effects, with greater heat exposure during summer months reducing pathogen loads and optimal pathogen conditions during the wet season increasing oak infection. Our results offer clues to possible disease dynamics under future climate change where hotter and drier or warmer and wetter conditions could have opposing effects on pathogen spillover in the SOD system. Disentangling direct and indirect effects of biotic and abiotic factors affecting disease processes can provide key insights into disease dynamics including potential avenues for reducing disease spread and predicting future epidemics.","Ailanthus altissima (Miller) Swingle seed oil: chromatographic characterization by GC-FID and HS-SPME-GC-MS, physicochemical parameters, and pharmacological bioactivities.",https://www.ncbi.nlm.nih.gov/pubmed/30854623,Environmental science and pollution research international,2019 05 07,"This study aimed to identify the physicochemical and the chemical properties of Ailanthus altissima (Miller) Swingle seed oil and to evaluate its in vitro antioxidant and antibacterial activities and in vivo analgesic and anti-inflammatory activities. The fatty acids' composition was determined using GC-FID. The oil was screened for antioxidant activity by DPPH test. The analgesic and anti-inflammatory activities were determined using the acetic acid writhing test in mice and the carrageenan-induced paw edema assay in rats, respectively. Volatile compounds were characterized by HS-SPME-GC-MS. A. altissima produces seeds which yielded 17.32% of oil. The seed oil was characterized by a saponification number of 192.6 mg KOH∙g of oil, a peroxide value of 11.4 meq O2∙kg of oil, a K232 of 4.04, a K270 of 1.24, and a phosphorus content of 126.2 ppm. The main fatty acids identified were palmitic (3.06%), stearic (1.56%), oleic (38.35%), and linoleic acids ones (55.76%). The main aroma compounds sampled in the headspace were carbonyl derivatives. The oil presents an important antioxidant activity (IC50 = 24.57 μg/mL) and a modest antimicrobial activity. The seed oil at 1 g/kg showed high analgesic (91.31%) and anti-inflammatory effects (85.17%). The presence of high levels of unsaturated fatty acids and the noteworthy antioxidant capacity of the seed oil can hypothesize its use as an analgesic and anti-inflammatory agent.","Carbon concentrations and their stable isotopic signatures in the upper Han River, China.",https://www.ncbi.nlm.nih.gov/pubmed/30854622,Environmental science and pollution research international,2019 05 07,"Carbon (C) in riverine ecosystems play an important role in regulating terrestrial carbon reservoir to the oceans and atmosphere, thus, understanding C dynamics in riverine ecosystem are essential for understanding global carbon cycle. Here, we investigated the seasonal and spatial variations in concentrations of dissolved inorganic carbon (DIC), particulate organic carbon (POC), and their carbon isotopic signatures (i.e., δ13C-DIC, δ13C-POC) in the tributaries and main channel of the upper Han River, China. Dissolved organic carbon (DOC), total suspended solid (TSS), and other physicochemical parameters including water temperature, pH, dissolved oxygen (DO), and electrical conductivity (EC) were also measured. We found that POC concentration was significantly higher in wet season and in main channel, and DIC concentration did not show significant spatiotemporal variability. DIC and POC were positively related to DOC, and they were also positively correlated with water temperature and TSS, respectively. δ13C-DIC and δ13C-POC had significant seasonal and spatial variations, and δ13C-DIC was significantly higher in dry season and δ13C-POC was significantly higher in the tributaries and in dry season. δ13C-DIC was negatively related to the TSS concentration, while δ13C-POC was negatively correlated with water temperature, DIC, and DOC concentrations.

Castilla y León regional government is currently implementing this programme in the province of Valladolid for the environmental recovery of areas heavily degraded by the deposit of inert waste, which entails the restoration of illegal dumps in the province bigger than 1000 m2, a total of 133. The programme also includes the implementation of an alternative and legal system for the management of construction and demolition waste, amongst other waste streams. The sealing of landfills and tailings is encompassed within the actions that the regional government is developing in the field of integrated management of waste for their prevention, recovery, recycling and disposal in all the provinces of the community, framed within the line established in the 7th Environmental Action Programme of the European Union. The situation of illegal deposits must be corrected both through direct situations on the affected areas and through measures aimed at ensuring proper management of construction and demolition waste and pruning. This paper shows the first results obtained after the implementation of this regional initiative with the focus set on the description of the implemented waste management programme. The programme provided 2518 services in 2017 managing 6000 t of waste which, without the implementation of this programme, would probably have ended up in illegal dumps. These waste streams included debris (33%), discarded appliances (45%) and pruning (22%). The costs associated with the management of these streams were 25.53 €/t debris, 183.16 €/t appliances and 162.40 €/t pruning.","The role of FBXW7, a cell-cycle regulator, as a predictive marker of recurrence of gastrointestinal stromal tumors.",https://www.ncbi.nlm.nih.gov/pubmed/30854619,Gastric cancer : official journal of the International Gastric Cancer Association and the Japanese Gastric Cancer Association,2019 03 11,"Few reliable prognostic markers have been established despite elucidation of the molecular mechanisms of gastrointestinal stromal tumor (GIST) development.

The geology of the watershed is dominated by Tertiary igneous rocks and Cretaceous limestones in the upper basin, and Quaternary alluvial sediments in the lower basin. Seventy percent of the land in the watershed has been deforested, and there are various urban and industrial areas. The JAFS is been widely known as source of trace elements to the coastal zone, and considered as contaminated. So, the aim of this study was to assess the environmental quality of the JAFS, using the total (TC) and the bioavailable (BF) concentrations of Cu and Pb, in surface fluvial sediments samples, in the dry (DS) and rainy (RS) seasons of the 2016. Average concentrations and ranges for the JAFS were CuT 10.2 ± 5.2 μg/g (2.2-41.5 μg/g); CuB 1.1 ± 1.4 μg/g (0.04-10.7 μg/g); PbT 5.0 ± 1.2 μg/g (1.8-10.9 μg/g); and PbB 0.7 ± 0.4 μg/g (0.1-2.0 μg/g). The BF only accounts for the ~ 10% of the total concentration for both elements, and is highly correlated to the mud content. No differences in average concentrations were found between the upper and lower bassins, nor among areas with different lithology. Cu presented higher concentrations during the RS, which suggest an enrichment of fluvial sediments from soil erosion, contrary, to Pb with higher concentrations during the DS. Although, some sampling stations, those located immediately after the Cordoba and Miguel Aleman cities, presented higher than average Cu and Pb concentrations, they did not exceeded the limits established by national environmental regulations, sediment quality guidelines, geoaccumulation index, and potential ecological risk indexes. Hence, the JAFS may be considered as not contaminated by Cu and Pb.",Correction to: Role of β Cell Precursors in the Regeneration of Insulin-Producing Pancreatic β Cells under the Influence of the Pegylated Form of Glucagon-Like Peptide 1.,https://www.ncbi.nlm.nih.gov/pubmed/30854616,Bulletin of experimental biology and medicine,2019 03 21,"The title of the article should read:""Role of β Cell Precursors in the Regeneration of Insulin-Producing Pancreatic β Cells under the Influence of the Pegylated Form of Glucagon-Like Peptide 1"".",Deoxynivalenol inhibits the expression of trefoil factors (TFF) by intestinal human and porcine goblet cells.,https://www.ncbi.nlm.nih.gov/pubmed/30854615,Archives of toxicology,2019 05 11,"Trefoil factors (TFFs) are bioactive peptides expressed by several epithelia, including the intestine, where they regulate key functions such as tissue regeneration, barrier function and inflammation. Although food-associated mycotoxins, including deoxynivalenol (DON), are known to impact many intestinal functions, modulation of TFFs during mycotoxicosis has never been investigated. Here, we analyzed the effect of DON on TFFs expression using both human goblet cells (HT29-16E cells) and porcine intestinal explants. Results showed that very low doses of DON (nanomolar range) inhibit the secretion of TFFs by human goblet cells (IC50 of 361, 387 and 243 nM for TFF1, 2 and 3, respectively) and prevent wound healing. RT-qPCR analysis demonstrated that the inhibitory effect of DON is related to a suppression of TFFs mRNA expression. Experiments conducted on porcine intestinal explants confirmed the results obtained on cells. Finally, the use of specific inhibitors of signal pathways demonstrated that DON-mediated suppression of TFFs expression mainly involved Protein Kinase R and the MAP kinases (MAPK) p38 and ERK1/2. Taken together, our results show for the first time that at very low doses, DON suppresses the expression and production of intestinal TFFs and alters wound healing.

In in vitro experiments, we obtained C-type natriuretic peptide (CNP) gene-modified bone marrow-derived mesenchymal stem cells (BMSCs) by transfection with recombinant adenovirus containing the CNP gene and revealed that CNP gene-modified BMSCs had good chondrogenic differentiation ability. By the freeze-drying method, we successfully synthesized a chitosan/silk fibroin (CS/SF) porous scaffold, which had a suitable aperture size for chondrogenesis. Then, we loaded CNP gene-modified BMSCs onto CS/SF scaffolds and tested their effect on repairing full-thickness cartilage defects in rat joints. The gross morphology and histology examination results showed that the composite of the CNP gene-modified BMSCs and CS/SF scaffolds had better repair effects than those of the other three groups at each time point. Additionally, compared to the group with BMSCs and scaffolds, we found that there was more cartilage matrix in the CNP gene-modified BMSCs and CS/SF scaffolds group.

Different volumes of water samples (6 mL wastewater influent, 15 mL wastewater effluent, and 60 mL river water) were evaporated to 0.3 mL and finally adjusted to 0.4 mL. 0.1 mL of the concentrate were injected into a polar reversed-phase C18 liquid chromatography column coupled with electrospray ionization to high-resolution tandem mass spectrometry. Analyte recoveries were determined for VEC and compared against a mixed-bed multilayer solid-phase extraction (SPE). Both approaches performed equally well (≥ 70% recovery) for a vast number of analytes (n = 327), whereas certain substances were especially amenable to enrichment by either SPE (e.g., 4-chlorobenzophenone, logDow,pH7 4) or VEC (e.g., TRIS, logDow,pH7 - 4.6). Overall, VEC was more suitable for the enrichment of polar analytes, albeit considerable signal suppression (up to 74% in river water) was observed for the VEC-enriched sample matrix. Nevertheless, VEC allowed for accurate and precise quantification down to the sub-nanogram per liter level and required no more than 60 mL of the sample, as demonstrated by its application to several environmental water matrices. By contrast, SPE is typically constrained by high sample volumes ranging from 100 mL (wastewater influent) to 1000 mL (river water).

While numerous studies have been performed identifying new CPP sequences, relatively little is known about their uptake efficiency at the single-cell level. Here, a droplet microfluidic trapping array was used to characterize CPP uptake across a population of single intact cells. The microfluidic device allowed for facile and rapid isolation and analysis of single-cell fluorescence in a 787-member overhead trapping array with > 99% droplet trapping efficiency. The permeability efficiencies of four different CPPs were studied and compared in HeLa cells. Population analysis was performed using linkage hierarchical cluster analysis by R programming to bin cells into subpopulations expressing very low to very high peptide uptake efficiencies. CPP uptake was observed to be heterogeneous across the population of cells with peptide concentration and sequence both playing important roles in the diversity of CPP uptake, the overall peptide uptake efficiency, and the intracellular homogeneity of peptide distribution. This microfluidic-based analytical approach finds application in personalized medicine and provides new insight in the heterogeneity of CPP uptake which has the potential to affect both biosensor and drug internalization in intact cells.

Clearly, there is a strong need to develop training programmes specifically focused on this subject. Regarding Italy, a national study, commenced in 2016, was designed as a cross-sectional survey employing face-to-face interviews between pharmacist and patient using a questionnaire drawn up by experts in compliance with best practice from scientific literature. Six hundred ten pharmacists followed a specific training course; 4425 questionnaires were correctly completed. The use of pharmacies as epidemiological sentinels, given their capillarity and daily contact with the local population in Italy, enabled us to obtain an epidemiological snapshot closer to the real-life situation compared to specialist headache centres. Over the course of this study, data on headaches were gathered in Italian pharmacies with the highest levels of numerosity in the world."

As the use of fingernail polish has been described to alter SpO2 readings, its removal is commonly recommended prior to measurement. Gel-based manicures have gained popularity in recent years due to their attractiveness and longevity. However, the removal of gel nail polish requires a specialised procedure. Valuable time and resources can be saved if removal can be avoided. To our knowledge, there are no available studies on the effect of gel-based manicures on pulse oximetry readings.

In this work, we developed an NGS-assisted antibody discovery platform by integrating phage-displayed, single-framework, synthetic Fab libraries. Due to limitations in attainable read and amplicon lengths, NGS analysis of Fab libraries and selection outputs is usually restricted to either VH or VL. Since this information alone is not sufficient for high-throughput reconstruction of Fabs, we developed a rapid and simple method for linking and sequencing all diversified CDRs in phage Fab pools. Our method resulted in a reliable and straightforward platform for converting NGS information into Fab clones. We used our NGS-assisted Fab reconstruction method to recover low-frequency rare clones from phage selection outputs. While previous studies chose rare clones for rescue based on their relative frequencies in sequencing outputs, we chose rare clones for reconstruction from less-frequent CDRH3 lengths. In some cases, reconstructed rare clones (frequency ∼0.1%) showed higher affinity and better specificity than high-frequency top clones identified by Sanger sequencing, highlighting the significance of NGS-based approaches in synthetic antibody discovery.",Sialyltransferase7A promotes angiotensin II-induced cardiomyocyte hypertrophy via HIF-1α-TAK1 signaling pathway.,https://www.ncbi.nlm.nih.gov/pubmed/30854566,Cardiovascular research,2019 03 11,Sialylation is up-regulated during the development of cardiac hypertrophy.

Here, we show that its transcriptional activity is modulated by ubiquitination at lysine 35 (K35). The level of ubiquitinated ELK-1 rises in mitogen-deprived cells and falls upon mitogen stimulation or oncogene expression. Ectopic expression of USP17, a cell cycle-dependent deubiquitinase, decreases ELK-1 ubiquitination and up-regulates ELK-1 target-genes with a concomitant increase in cyclin D1 expression. In contrast, USP17 depletion attenuates ELK-1-dependent gene expression and slows cell proliferation. The reduced rate of proliferation upon USP17 depletion appears to be a direct effect of ELK-1 ubiquitination because it is rescued by an ELK-1(K35R) mutant refractory to ubiquitination. Overall, our results show that ubiquitination of ELK-1 at K35, and its reversal by USP17, are important mechanisms in the regulation of nuclear ERK signalling and cellular proliferation. Our findings will be relevant for tumours that exhibit elevated USP17 expression and suggest a new target for intervention.",GSK3β-SCFFBXW7α mediated phosphorylation and ubiquitination of IRF1 are required for its transcription-dependent turnover.,https://www.ncbi.nlm.nih.gov/pubmed/30854564,Nucleic acids research,2019 05 21,"IRF1 (Interferon Regulatory Factor-1) is the prototype of the IRF family of DNA binding transcription factors. IRF1 protein expression is regulated by transient up-regulation in response to external stimuli followed by rapid degradation via the ubiquitin-proteasome system. Here we report that DNA bound IRF1 turnover is promoted by GSK3β (Glycogen Synthase Kinase 3β) via phosphorylation of the T181 residue which generates a phosphodegron for the SCF (Skp-Cul-Fbox) ubiquitin E3-ligase receptor protein Fbxw7α (F-box/WD40 7). This regulated turnover is essential for IRF1 activity, as mutation of T181 results in an improperly stabilized protein that accumulates at target promoters but fails to induce RNA-Pol-II elongation and subsequent transcription of target genes. Consequently, the anti-proliferative activity of IRF1 is lost in cell lines expressing T181A mutant. Further, cell lines with dysfunctional Fbxw7 are less sensitive to IRF1 overexpression, suggesting an important co-activator function for this ligase complex. As T181 phosphorylation requires both DNA binding and RNA-Pol-II elongation, we propose that this event acts to clear 'spent' molecules of IRF1 from transcriptionally engaged target promoters.","A late-binding, distributed, NoSQL warehouse for integrating patient data from clinical trials.",https://www.ncbi.nlm.nih.gov/pubmed/30854563,Database : the journal of biological databases and curation,2019 04 04,"Clinical trial data are typically collected through multiple systems developed by different vendors using different technologies and data standards. That data need to be integrated, standardized and transformed for a variety of monitoring and reporting purposes. The need to process large volumes of often inconsistent data in the presence of ever-changing requirements poses a significant technical challenge. As part of a comprehensive clinical data repository, we have developed a data warehouse that integrates patient data from any source, standardizes it and makes it accessible to study teams in a timely manner to support a wide range of analytic tasks for both in-flight and completed studies. Our solution combines Apache HBase, a NoSQL column store, Apache Phoenix, a massively parallel relational query engine and a user-friendly interface to facilitate efficient loading of large volumes of data under incomplete or ambiguous specifications, utilizing an extract-load-transform design pattern that defers data mapping until query time. This approach allows us to maintain a single copy of the data and transform it dynamically into any desirable format without requiring additional storage. Changes to the mapping specifications can be easily introduced and multiple representations of the data can be made available concurrently. Further, by versioning the data and the transformations separately, we can apply historical maps to current data or current maps to historical data, which simplifies the maintenance of data cuts and facilitates interim analyses for adaptive trials. The result is a highly scalable, secure and redundant solution that combines the flexibility of a NoSQL store with the robustness of a relational query engine to support a broad range of applications, including clinical data management, medical review, risk-based monitoring, safety signal detection, post hoc analysis of completed studies and many others."

Series A, Biological sciences and medical sciences",2019 06 10,"Since the initial suggestion that rapamycin, an inhibitor of TOR nutrient signaling, increased lifespan comparable to dietary restriction, investigators have viewed rapamycin as a potential dietary restriction mimetic. Both dietary restriction and rapamycin increase lifespan across a wide range of evolutionarily diverse species (including yeast, C. elegans,Drosophila, and mice) as well as reducing pathology and improving physiological functions that decline with age in mice. The purpose of this article is to review the research comparing the effect of dietary restriction and rapamycin in mice. The current data show that dietary restriction and rapamycin have different effects on many pathways and molecular processes. In addition, these interventions affect the lifespan of many genetically manipulated mouse models differently. In other words, while dietary restriction and rapamycin may have similar effects on some pathways and processes; overall, they affect many pathways/processes quite differently. Therefore, rapamycin is likely not a true dietary restriction mimetic. Rather dietary restriction and rapamycin appear to be increasing lifespan and retarding aging largely through different mechanisms/pathways, suggesting that a combination of dietary restriction and rapamycin will have a greater effect on lifespan than either manipulation alone.",Did apomixis evolve from sex or was it the other way around?,https://www.ncbi.nlm.nih.gov/pubmed/30854543,Journal of experimental botany,2019 06 01,"In angiosperms, there are two pathways of reproduction through seeds: sexual, or amphimictic, and asexual, or apomictic. The essential feature of apomixis is that an embryo in an ovule is formed autonomously. It may form from a cell of the nucellus or integuments in an otherwise sexual ovule, a process referred to as adventitious embryony. Alternatively, the embryo may form by parthenogenesis from an unreduced egg that forms in an unreduced embryo sac. The latter may form from an ameiotic megasporocyte, in which case it is referred to as diplospory, or from a cell of the nucellus or integument, in which case it is referred to as apospory. Progeny of apomictic plants are generally identical to the mother plant. Apomixis has been seen over the years as either a gain- or loss-of-function over sexuality, implying that the latter is the default condition. Here, we consider an additional point of view, that apomixis may be anciently polyphenic with sex and that both reproductive phenisms involve anciently canalized components of complex molecular processes. This polyphenism viewpoint suggests that apomixis fails to occur in obligately sexual eukaryotes because genetic or epigenetic modifications have silenced the primitive sex apomixis switch and/or disrupted molecular capacities for apomixis. In eukaryotes where sex and apomixis are clearly polyphenic, apomixis exponentially drives clonal fecundity during reproductively favorable conditions, while stress induces sex for stress-tolerant spore or egg formation. The latter often guarantees species survival during environmentally harsh seasons.",The effect of an interprofessional pain service on nonmalignant pain control.,https://www.ncbi.nlm.nih.gov/pubmed/30854542,American journal of health-system pharmacy : AJHP : official journal of the American Society of Health-System Pharmacists,2019 03 11,"The primary objective of this project is to evaluate an existing interprofessional, nonmalignant pain service by measuring the difference in patient pain scores (numeric rating scale-11) before and after a pharmacist-led pain education class and medication therapy management (MTM) visit.

We first determine the equilibrium configuration of a single adsorbed particle, and we find that the overall shape of the induced deformation field has a strong hexapolar mode while non-Janus particles of the same shape do not induce any interfacial deformation. We then calculate the capillary interactions between two Janus spherocylinders adsorbed at an interface. The hexapolar deformation field induces capillary attractions for laterally aligned Janus spherocylinders and repulsions for laterally anti-aligned ones. We also experimentally synthesize micrometer-sized charged Janus dumbbells and let them adsorb at a water-decane interface. After several hours we observe the formation of aggregates of dumbbells predominantly induced by interactions that appear to be capillary in nature. Our Janus dumbbells attach laterally and are all aligned, as predicted by our numerical calculations.",Temperature dependence of the cooperative out-of-equilibrium elastic switching in a spin-crossover material.,https://www.ncbi.nlm.nih.gov/pubmed/30854539,Physical chemistry chemical physics : PCCP,2019 03 21,"We present a study of a molecular material, [Feiii(3-MeO-SalEen)2]PF6, undergoing cooperative reversible photo-induced transition between low-spin state and high-spin state.

We rationalize our findings using Monte Carlo simulations, and a mechano-elastic model. The experimental results and the simulations support the existence of a fast mechanism by which molecules cooperatively switch through coupling to the lattice strain. The efficiency of the coupling process is shown to depend on several parameters including the initial thermal population and the instantaneous photo-induced population among others. Far below the crossover temperature, the elastic self-amplification occurs above a threshold photo-excitation. On approaching the thermal crossover, the threshold disappears and the photo-elastic conversion increases.",Cross-linker effect on solute adsorption in swollen thermoresponsive polymer networks.,https://www.ncbi.nlm.nih.gov/pubmed/30854538,Physical chemistry chemical physics : PCCP,2019 03 21,"The selective solute partitioning within a polymeric network is of key importance to applications in which controlled release or uptake of solutes in a responsive hydrogel is required. In this work we investigate the impact of cross-links on solute adsorption in a swollen polymer network by means of all-atom, explicit-water molecular dynamics simulations. We focus on a representative network subunit consisting of poly(N-isopropylacrylamide) (PNIPAM) and N,N'-methylenebisacrylamide (BIS/MBA) cross-linker types. Our studied system consists of one BIS-linker with four atactic PNIPAM chains attached in a tetrahedral geometry. The adsorption of several representative solutes of different polarity in the low concentration limit at the linker region is examined. We subdivide the solute adsorption regions and distinguish between contributions stemming from polymer chains and cross-link parts. In comparison to a single polymer chain, we observe that the adsorption of the solutes to the cross-link region can significantly differ, with details depending on the specific compounds' size and polarity. In particular, for solutes that have already a relatively large affinity to PNIPAM chains the dense cross-link region (where many-body attractions are at play) amplifies the local adsorption by an order of magnitude. We also find that the cross-link region can serve as a seed for the aggregation of mutually attractive solutes at higher solute concentrations. Utilizing the microscopic adsorption coefficients in a mean-field model of an idealized macroscopic polymer network, we extrapolate these results to the global solute partitioning in a swollen hydrogel and predict that these adsorption features may lead to non-monotonic partition ratios as a function of the cross-link density."

The motivation of this study was to take advantage of the temporal associations among longitudinal (sequential) data to improve the predictive performance of outcome models under the circumstance of limited sample sizes. Two composite architectures: (1) a one dimension (1D) convolutional + fully connected and (2) a locally-connected+ fully connected architectures were implemented for this purpose. Compared with the fully-connected architecture (multi-layer perceptron [MLP]), our composite architectures yielded better predictive performance of LC in lung cancer patients who received radiotherapy. Specifically, in a cohort of 98 patients (29 patients failed locally), the composite architecture of 1D convolutional layers and fully-connected layers achieved an AUC (area under receiver operating characteristic curve) of 0.83 (95% confidence interval (CI): 0.807~0.841) with 18 features (14 features are longitudinal data).

Our BN building approach has two steps. First, relevant biophysical predictors influencing LC before and during the treatment are selected through an extended Markov blanket (eMB) method. From this eMB process, the most robust BN structure for LC prediction was found via a wrapper-based approach. Sixty-eight patients with complete feature information were used to identify a full BN model for LC prediction before and during the treatment. Fifty more recent patients with some missing information were reserved for independent testing of the developed pre- and during-therapy BNs. A nested cross-validation (N-CV) was developed to evaluate the performance of the two-step BN approach. An ensemble BN model is generated from the N-CV sampling process to assess its similarity with the corresponding full BN model, and thus evaluate the sensitivity of our BN approach. Our results show that the proposed BN development approach is a stable and robust approach to identify hierarchical relationships among biophysical features for LC prediction.

Small-angle scattering signals were shown to provide unique information about the abnormality of soft tissues that is complementary to the traditional attenuation image. Currently, there is no effective small-angle scattering detection system. In this paper, we propose a new ""collimation"" design dedicated to capture a small-angle scattering radiographic image directly, which carries critical pathological information for differentiation between normal and abnormal tissues. Our design consists of two interlaced gratings so that both the primary flux and Compton scattering photons are effectively blocked to leave the apertures mainly open to small-angle scattering photons.

Energy,2019 03 29,"Na-ion batteries are nowadays receiving renewed attention because of its propitiousness for large-scale stationary applications. Although the Na storage mechanism is still not completely understood, TiO2 nanoparticles are very promising active anode materials in Na-ion batteries provided that a correct dispersion is achieved within the battery electrode. Whilst the structural changes, either in crystallinity or crystalline phase, that occur during operation are receiving much recent attention, the nanometric morphological evolution of the TiO2 nanoparticles within the electrode is yet to be thoroughly addressed, despite its implication in battery efficiency. In the present work, operando small-angle x-ray scattering studies on TiO2/Na-ion batteries show that whereas the nanoparticle size is preserved during the discharge-charge cycles, the mean distance between nanoparticles increases. The observed morphological changes are consistent with electrode swelling and nanoparticle aggregation during operation, being one phenomenon dominant over the other depending on the applied density current; thus, depending on the differences in ion diffusion within the electrode.","Randomized Phase 2 Study of Trebananib (AMG 386) with or without Continued Anti-Vascular Endothelial Growth Factor Therapy in Patients with Renal Cell Carcinoma Who Have Progressed on Bevacizumab, Pazopanib, Sorafenib, or Sunitinib - Results of NCI/CTEP Protocol 9048.",https://www.ncbi.nlm.nih.gov/pubmed/30854497,Kidney cancer,2019 05 08,"In renal cell carcinoma (RCC), angiopoietin (Ang) 2 is elevated at the time of progression on anti-vascular endothelial growth factor (VEGF) therapy and may contribute to resistance.",The 'Achilles Heel' of Metabolism in Renal Cell Carcinoma: Glutaminase Inhibition as a Rational Treatment Strategy.,https://www.ncbi.nlm.nih.gov/pubmed/30854496,Kidney cancer,2019 03 29,"An important hallmark of cancer is 'metabolic reprogramming' or the rewiring of cellular metabolism to support rapid cell proliferation [1-5].

The experimental characterisation of numerous BGCs has led to the elucidation of subclusters of genes within BGCs, jointly responsible for the same biosynthetic function in different genetic contexts. We developed an unsupervised statistical method able to successfully detect a large number of modules (putative functional subclusters) within an extensive set of predicted BGCs in a systematic and automated manner. Multiple already known subclusters were confirmed by our method, proving its efficiency and sensitivity. In addition, the resulting large collection of newly defined modules provides new insights into the prevalence and putative biosynthetic role of these modular genetic entities.

Microbial consortia are promising for diverse bioenergy and environmental applications, yet microbial interactions are not fully understood. Here, we present comprehensive investigation on how two species in an artificial microbial consortium, consisting of Bacillus cereus A1 and Brevundimonas naejangsanensis B1, mutually cooperate to achieve an overall enhancement in hydrogen production and starch utilization. In this consortium, strains A1 and B1 secrete α-amylase and glucoamylase that are functionally complementary in starch hydrolysis. Moreover, strain A1 converts starch into lactate as a carbon source and electron donor, supporting the cell growth and hydrogen generation of strain B1. In return, strain B1 produces formate as an electron shuttle to strain A1 to enhance hydrogen production. The co-culture re-directs the overall metabolic flux, facilitates the cell growth, and up-regulates the key genes of hydrogen production and starch hydrolysis.",Accumulation of genetic and epigenetic alterations in normal cells and cancer risk.,https://www.ncbi.nlm.nih.gov/pubmed/30854468,NPJ precision oncology,2019 03 29,"Cancers develop due to the accumulation of genetic and epigenetic alterations. Genetic alterations are induced by aging, mutagenic chemicals, ultraviolet light, and other factors; whereas, epigenetic alterations are mainly by aging and chronic inflammation. The accumulation and patterns of alterations in normal cells reflect our past exposure levels and life history. Most accumulated alterations are considered as passengers, but their accumulation is correlated with cancer drivers. This has been shown for aberrant DNA methylation but has only been speculated for genetic alterations. However, recent technological advancements have enabled measurement of rare point mutations, and studies have shown that their accumulation levels are indeed correlated with cancer risk. When the accumulation levels of aberrant DNA methylation and point mutations are combined, risk prediction becomes even more accurate. When high levels of alterations accumulate, the tissue has a high risk of developing cancer or even multiple cancers and is considered as a ""cancerization field"", with or without expansion of physiological patches of clonal cells. In this review, we describe the formation of a cancerization field and how we can apply its detection in precision cancer risk diagnosis.",Dietary Supplementation with Anti-Inflammatory Omega-3 Fatty Acids for Cardiovascular Protection: Help or Hoax?,https://www.ncbi.nlm.nih.gov/pubmed/30854465,"Reactive oxygen species (Apex, N.C.)",2019 03 29,"Dietary supplementation with omega-3 fatty acids, also known as n-3 fatty acids, has been widely considered cardiovascular protective in the general human population.

Twenty-four sets of CT images of the ACR CT phantom were attained from a GE Discovery 750HD scanner using 24 different image acquisition settings, combinations of 4 tube currents (25, 50, 100, 200 Effective mAs), 3 slice thicknesses (1.25, 2.5, 5 mm), and 2 convolution kernels (STANDARD and SOFT). Polyethylene (-95 HU) and acrylic (120 HU) of the phantom model were selected for calculating real feature value; a noise-free, computer-generated phantom image series that reproduced the 2 objects and the background was used for calculating reference feature value. Feature reliability was defined as the degree of predicting reference feature value from real feature value. Radiomic features mean, std, skewness, kurtosis, gray-level co-occurrence matrix (GLCM)-energy, GLCM-contrast, GLCM-correlation, GLCM-homogeneity were investigated. The value of R2 ≥ 0.85 was considered to be of high reliability. The reliability of mean and std were high across all image acquisition settings. At 200 Effective mAs, all features except GLCM-homogeneity showed high reliability, whereas at 25 Effective mAs, most features (except mean and std) showed low reliability. From high to low, reliability was ranked in the following order: mean, std, skewness, kurtosis, GLCM-energy, correlation, contrast and homogeneity.

However, the fundamental optimization analysis method is equally important and its impact on pharmacokinetic parameters has been mostly overlooked. We examine the effects of those choices on accuracy and performance of parameter estimation using both computer processing unit and graphical processing unit (GPU) numerical optimization implementations and evaluate the improvements offered by a novel optimization approach. A test framework was developed where experimentally derived population-average arterial input function and randomly sampled parameter sets {Ktrans , Kep , Vb , τ} were used to generate known tissue curves. Five numerical optimization algorithms were evaluated: sequential quadratic programming, downhill simplex (Nelder-Mead), pattern search, simulated annealing, and differential evolution. This was combined with various objective function implementation details: delay approximation, discretization and varying sampling rates. Then, impact of noise and CPU/GPU implementation was tested for speed and accuracy. Finally, the optimal method was compared to conventional implementation as applied to clinical DCE computed tomography. Nelder-Mead, differential evolution and sequential quadratic programming produced good results on clean and noisy input data outperforming simulated annealing and pattern search in terms of speed and accuracy in the respective order of 10-8%, 10-7%, and ×10-6%). A novel approach for DCE numerical optimization (infinite impulse response with fractional delay approximation) was implemented on GPU for speed increase of at least 2 orders of magnitude.

Pre- and posttreatment computed tomography scans of 123 patients (cancers, 129; pre- and posttreatment cancer pairs, 158) undergoing chemotherapy were collected. After chemotherapy 33% of patients had T0 stage cancer (complete response). Regions of interest in pre- and posttreatment scans were extracted from the segmented lesions and combined into hybrid pre -post image pairs (h-ROIs). Training (pairs, 94; h-ROIs, 6209), validation (10 pairs) and test sets (54 pairs) were obtained. The DL-CNN consisted of 2 convolution (C1-C2), 2 locally connected (L3-L4), and 1 fully connected layers. The DL-CNN was trained with h-ROIs to classify cancers as fully responding (stage T0) or not fully responding to chemotherapy. Two radiologists provided lesion likelihood of being stage T0 posttreatment. The test area under the ROC curve (AUC) was 0.73 for T0 prediction by the base DL-CNN structure with randomly initialized weights. The base DL-CNN structure with pretrained weights and transfer learning (no frozen layers) achieved test AUC of 0.79. The test AUCs for 3 modified DL-CNN structures (different C1-C2 max pooling filter sizes, strides, and padding, with transfer learning) were 0.72, 0.86, and 0.69. For the base DL-CNN with (C1) frozen, (C1-C2) frozen, and (C1-C2-L3) frozen, the test AUCs were 0.81, 0.78, and 0.71, respectively. The radiologists' AUCs were 0.76 and 0.77.

These features give us information about a nodule, for example, nodule size, pixel intensity, histogram-based information, and texture information from wavelets or a convolution kernel. Semantic features, on the other hand, can be generated by an experienced radiologist and consist of the common characteristics of a tumor, for example, location of a tumor, fissure, or pleural wall attachment, presence of fibrosis or emphysema, concave cut on nodule surface. These features have been derived for lung nodules by our group. Semantic features have also shown promise in predicting malignancy. Deep features from images are generally extracted from the last layers before the classification layer of a convolutional neural network (CNN). By training with the use of different types of images, the CNN learns to recognize various patterns and textures. But when we extract deep features, there is no specific naming approach for them, other than denoting them by the feature column number (position of a neuron in a hidden layer). In this study, we tried to relate and explain deep features with respect to traditional quantitative features and semantic features. We discovered that 26 deep features from the Vgg-S neural network and 12 deep features from our trained CNN could be explained by semantic or traditional quantitative features. From this, we concluded that those deep features can have a recognizable definition via semantic or quantitative features."

In total, 55 patients underwent 4 DCE-MRI examinations before, during, and after NACT. The shutter-speed model was used to analyze the DCE-MRI data and generate parametric maps within the tumor region of interest. The proposed multiresolution fractal method and the more conventional methods of single-resolution fractal, gray-level co-occurrence matrix, and run-length matrix were used to extract features from the parametric maps. Only the data obtained before and after the first NACT cycle were used to evaluate early prediction of response. With a training (N = 40) and testing (N = 15) data set, support vector machine was used to assess the predictive abilities of the features in classification of pathologic complete response versus non-pathologic complete response. Generally the multiresolution fractal features from individual maps and the concatenated features from all parametric maps showed better predictive performances than conventional features, with receiver operating curve area under the curve (AUC) values of 0.91 (all parameters) and 0.80 (Ktrans), in the training and testing sets, respectively. The differences in AUC were statistically significant (P < .05) for several parametric maps. Thus, multiresolution analysis that decomposes the texture at various spatial-frequency scales may more accurately capture changes in tumor vascular heterogeneity as measured by DCE-MRI, and therefore provide better early prediction of NACT response.",Phantom Validation of DCE-MRI Magnitude and Phase-Based Vascular Input Function Measurements.,https://www.ncbi.nlm.nih.gov/pubmed/30854445,"Tomography (Ann Arbor, Mich.)",2019 03 29,"Accurate, patient-specific measurement of arterial input functions (AIF) may improve model-based analysis of vascular permeability. This study investigated factors affecting AIF measurements from magnetic resonance imaging (MRI) magnitude (AIFMAGN) and phase (AIFPHA) signals, and compared them against computed tomography (CT) (AIFCT), under controlled conditions relevant to clinical protocols using a multimodality flow phantom. The flow phantom was applied at flip angles of 20° and 30°, flow rates (3-7.5 mL/s), and peak bolus concentrations (0.5-10 mM), for in-plane and through-plane flow. Spatial 3D-FLASH signal and variable flip angle T1 profiles were measured to investigate in-flow and radiofrequency-related biases, and magnitude- and phase-derived Gd-DTPA concentrations were compared. MRI AIF performance was tested against AIFCT via Pearson correlation analysis. AIFMAGN was sensitive to imaging orientation, spatial location, flip angle, and flow rate, and it grossly underestimated AIFCT peak concentrations. Conversion to Gd-DTPA concentration using T1 taken at the same orientation and flow rate as the dynamic contrast-enhanced acquisition improved AIFMAGN accuracy; yet, AIFMAGN metrics remained variable and significantly reduced from AIFCT at concentrations above 2.5 mM. AIFPHA performed equivalently within 1 mM to AIFCT across all tested conditions. AIFPHA, but not AIFMAGN, reported equivalent measurements to AIFCT across the range of tested conditions. AIFPHA showed superior robustness.",Habitats in DCE-MRI to Predict Clinically Significant Prostate Cancers.,https://www.ncbi.nlm.nih.gov/pubmed/30854444,"Tomography (Ann Arbor, Mich.)",2019 03 29,"Prostate cancer identification and assessment of clinical significance continues to be a challenge. Routine multiparametric magnetic resonance imaging has shown to be useful in assessing disease progression. Although dynamic contrast-enhanced imaging (DCE) has the ability to characterize perfusion across time and has shown enormous utility, radiological assessment (Prostate Imaging-Reporting and Data System or PIRADS version 2) has limited its use owing to lack of consistency and nonquantitative nature. In our work, we propose a systematic methodology to quantify perfusion dynamics for the DCE imaging. Using these metrics, 7 different subregions or perfusion habitats of the targeted lesions are localized and related to clinical significance. We found that quantitative features describing the habitat based on the late area under the DCE time-activity curve was a good predictor of clinical significance disease. The best predictive feature in the habitat had an AUC of 0.82, CI [0.81-0.83].",Real-Time Quantitative Assessment of Accuracy and Precision of Blood Volume Derived from DCE-MRI in Individual Patients During a Clinical Trial.,https://www.ncbi.nlm.nih.gov/pubmed/30854443,"Tomography (Ann Arbor, Mich.)",2019 03 29,"Accuracy and precision of quantitative imaging (QI) metrics should be assessed in real time in each patient during a clinical trial to support QI-based decision-making. We developed a framework for real-time quantitative assessment of QI metrics and evaluated accuracy and precision of dynamic contrast-enhanced (DCE)-magnetic resonance imaging (MRI)-derived blood volume (BV) in a clinical trial for head and neck cancers. Patients underwent DCE-MRI before and after 2 weeks of radiation therapy (2wkRT). A mean as a reference value and a repeatability coefficient (RC) of BV values established from n patients in cerebellum volumes of interest (VOIs), which were normal and affected little by therapy, served as accuracy and precision measurements. The BV maps of a new patient were called accurate and precise if the values in cerebellum VOIs and the difference between the 2 scans agreed with the respective mean and RC with 95% confidence. The new data could be used to update reference values. Otherwise, the data were flagged for further evaluation before use in the trial. BV maps from 62 patients enrolled on the trial were evaluated. Mean BV values were 2.21 (±0.14) mL/100 g pre-RT and 2.22 (±0.17) mL/100 g at 2wkRT; relative RC was 15.9%. The BV maps from 3 patients were identified to be inaccurate and imprecise before use in the clinical trial.

Histone deacetylase inhibitors (HDACi) are potential pharmacologic agents to improve outcomes for patients with gliomas. We assessed the therapeutic efficacy of belinostat (PXD-101), an HDACi with blood-brain barrier permeability. Belinostat was first tested in an orthotopic rat glioma model to assess in vivo tumoricidal effect. Our results showed that belinostat was effective in reducing tumor volume in the orthotopic rat glioma model in a dose-dependent manner. We also tested the antidepression activity of belinostat in 2 animal models of depression and found it to be effective. Furthermore, we confirmed that myo-inositol levels improved by belinostat treatment in vitro. In a human pilot study, it was observed that belinostat in combination with chemoradiation may delay initial recurrence of disease. Excitingly, belinostat significantly improved depressive symptoms in patients with glioblastoma compared with control subjects.

The constructed iDKI phantoms included negative control monoexponential diffusion materials to independently characterize noise and model-induced bias in quantitative kurtosis parameters. Ten test-retest DKI studies were performed on four scanners at three imaging centers over a six-month period. The tested prototype phantoms exhibited physiologically relevant apparent diffusion, Dapp, and kurtosis, Kapp, parameters ranging between 0.4 and 1.1 (×10-3 mm2/s) and 0.8 and 1.7 (unitless), respectively. Measured kurtosis phantom Kapp exceeded maximum fit model bias (0.1) detected for negative control (zero kurtosis) materials. The material-specific parameter precision [95% CI for Dapp: 0.013-0.022(×10-3 mm2/s) and for Kapp: 0.009-0.076] derived from the test-retest analysis was sufficient to characterize thermal and temporal stability of the prototype DKI phantom through correlation analysis of inter-scan variability.

The current consensus in Western Europe is that ungulates formed the bulk of the human diet during the Lower and Middle Paleolithic, while small fast prey taxa were virtually ignored. Here, we present a multisite taphonomic study of leporid assemblages from Southern France that supports frequent exploitation of small fast game during marine isotope stages 11 to 3. Along with recent evidence from Iberia, our results indicate that the consumption of small fast game was more common prior to the Upper Paleolithic than previously thought and that archaic hominins from the northwestern Mediterranean had broader diets than those from adjacent regions. Although likely of secondary importance relative to ungulates, the frequent exploitation of leporids documented here implies that human diet breadths were substantially more variable within Europe than assumed by current evolutionary models."

Secondary forests recover remarkably fast in species richness but slowly in species composition. Secondary forests take a median time of five decades to recover the species richness of old-growth forest (80% recovery after 20 years) based on rarefaction analysis. Full recovery of species composition takes centuries (only 34% recovery after 20 years). A dual strategy that maintains both old-growth forests and species-rich secondary forests is therefore crucial for biodiversity conservation in human-modified tropical landscapes.",The endogenous retrovirus-derived long noncoding RNA TROJAN promotes triple-negative breast cancer progression via ZMYND8 degradation.,https://www.ncbi.nlm.nih.gov/pubmed/30854423,Science advances,2019 03 29,"Human endogenous retroviruses (HERVs) play pivotal roles in the development of breast cancer. However, the detailed mechanisms of noncoding HERVs remain elusive. Here, our genome-wide transcriptome analysis of HERVs revealed that a primate long noncoding RNA, which we dubbed TROJAN, was highly expressed in human triple-negative breast cancer (TNBC). TROJAN promoted TNBC proliferation and invasion and indicated poor patient outcomes. We further confirmed that TROJAN could bind to ZMYND8, a metastasis-repressing factor, and increase its degradation through the ubiquitin-proteasome pathway by repelling ZNF592. TROJAN also epigenetically up-regulated metastasis-related genes in multiple cell lines. Correlations between TROJAN and ZMYND8 were subsequently confirmed in clinical samples. Furthermore, our study verified that antisense oligonucleotide therapy targeting TROJAN substantially suppressed TNBC progression in vivo. In conclusion, the long noncoding RNA TROJAN promotes TNBC progression and serves as a potential therapeutic target.",The comparative genomics and complex population history of Papio baboons.,https://www.ncbi.nlm.nih.gov/pubmed/30854422,Science advances,2019 03 29,"Recent studies suggest that closely related species can accumulate substantial genetic and phenotypic differences despite ongoing gene flow, thus challenging traditional ideas regarding the genetics of speciation. Baboons (genus Papio) are Old World monkeys consisting of six readily distinguishable species. Baboon species hybridize in the wild, and prior data imply a complex history of differentiation and introgression. We produced a reference genome assembly for the olive baboon (Papio anubis) and whole-genome sequence data for all six extant species. We document multiple episodes of admixture and introgression during the radiation of Papio baboons, thus demonstrating their value as a model of complex evolutionary divergence, hybridization, and reticulation. These results help inform our understanding of similar cases, including modern humans, Neanderthals, Denisovans, and other ancient hominins.",The gravity dependence of pharmacodynamics: the integration of lidocaine into membranes in microgravity.,https://www.ncbi.nlm.nih.gov/pubmed/30854420,NPJ microgravity,2019 03 29,"To realize long-term manned space missions, e.g. to Mars, some important questions about pharmacology under conditions of different gravity will have to be answered to ensure safe usage of pharmaceuticals. Experiments on the International Space Station showed that the pharmacokinetics of drugs are changed in microgravity. On Earth, it is well known that the incorporation of substances into cellular membranes depends on membrane fluidity, therefore the finding that membrane fluidity is gravity dependent possibly has effects on pharmacodynamics of hydrophobic and amphiphilic substances in microgravity. To validate a possible effect of gravity on pharmacodynamics, experiments have been carried out to investigate the incorporation of lidocaine into plain lipid membranes under microgravity conditions. In microgravity, the induced increase in membrane fluidity associated with lidocaine incorporation is smaller compared to 1g controls. This experiment concerning the gravity dependence of pharmacodynamics in real microgravity clearly shows that the incorporation of amphipathic drugs into membranes is changed in microgravity. This might have significant impact on the pharmacology of drugs during long-term space missions and has to be investigated in more detail to be able to assess possible risks.","Multisystem-Involved Youth: A Developmental Framework and Implications for Research, Policy, and Practice.",https://www.ncbi.nlm.nih.gov/pubmed/30854418,Adolescent research review,2019 03 29,"Multisystem-involved youth are children and adolescents concurrently served in the child welfare, behavioral health, and/or juvenile justice systems. These youth are a high risk and vulnerable population, often due to their experience of multiple adversities and trauma, yet little is known about their multiple needs and pathways into multisystem involvement. Multisystem-involved youth present unique challenges to researchers, practitioners, and policymakers. In this article, we summarize the literature on multisystem-involved youth, including prevalence, characteristics, risk factors, and disparities for this population. We then describe a developmental cascade framework, which specifies how exposure to adverse experiences in childhood may have a ""cascading"" or spillover effect later in development, to depict pathways of multisystem involvement and opportunities for intervention. This framework offers a multidimensional view of involvement across service systems and illustrates the complexities of relationships between micro- and macro-level factors at various stages and domains of development. We conclude that multisystem-involved youth are an understudied population that may represent majority of youth who are already served in another service system. Many of these youth are also disproportionately from racial and ethnic minority backgrounds. Currently, for multisystem-involved youth and their families, there is a lack of standardized and integrated screening procedures to identify youth with open cases across service systems; inadequate use of available instruments to assess exposure to complex trauma; inadequate clinical and family-related evidence-based practices specifically for use with this population; and poor cross-systems collaboration and coordination that align goals and targeted outcomes across systems. We make recommendations for research, practice, and systems development to address the needs of multisystem-involved youth and their families.","Acute Cholecystitis in Very Elderly Patients: Disease Management, Outcomes, and Risk Factors for Complications.",https://www.ncbi.nlm.nih.gov/pubmed/30854417,Surgery research and practice,2019 03 29,"The aim of this study was to evaluate the characteristics, management, and outcomes of acute cholecystitis in patients ≥80 years.",Surgical Task Shifting Helps Reduce Neonatal Mortality in Ethiopia: A Retrospective Cohort Study.,https://www.ncbi.nlm.nih.gov/pubmed/30854416,Surgery research and practice,2019 03 29,To improve access to surgical service and to reduce neonatal mortality Ethiopia implemented surgical task shifting to nonphysician surgeons (NPSs).

Differential expression studies usually utilize the strongest upor downregulated genes to generate networks visualizing the relationships among these genes. To include all yeast genes in one analysis and to get broader information on all cellular responses, we test a priori input of predefined genome-wide expression cliques and subsequent statistical analysis of the expression data. To this end, we generate a set of 72 co-regulation cliques using the information from 3196 microarray experiments. The obtained cliques performed highly significant in gene ontology and transcription factor enrichment analyses. We then tested the clique set on individual microarray experiments reporting on responses to pheromone, glycerol versus glucose based growth and the cellular response to heat. In all cases a highly significant determination of affected expression cliques was possible based on their average expression differences, the positions of their genes within hit rankings (UpRegScore) or the enrichment of the Top200 hits in certain cliques. The 72 cliques were finally used to compare experiments, which reported on the transcriptional response to polyglutamine proteins of different lengths. Using the predefined clique set it is possible to identify with high sensitivity and good significance sample and condition specific changes to gene expression. We thus conclude that an analysis, starting with these 72 preformed expression cliques, can complement traditional microarray analyses by visualizing the entire response on a static genome-wide gene set.",Microevolution of the pathogenic yeasts Candida albicans and Candida glabrata during antifungal therapy and host infection.,https://www.ncbi.nlm.nih.gov/pubmed/30854392,"Microbial cell (Graz, Austria)",2019 03 29,"Infections by the pathogenic yeasts Candida albicans and Candida glabrata are among the most common fungal diseases.

This review aims to provide an overview of current developments and challenges in pharmacogenetics in medicine for a veterinary audience and to map these to developments in veterinary pharmacogenetics. Pharmacogenetics has been in development over the past 100 years but has been revolutionized following the publication of the human, and then veterinary species genomes. Genetic biomarkers called pharmacogenes have been identified as specific genetic loci on chromosomes which are associated with either positive or adverse drug responses. Pharmacogene variation may be classified according to the associated drug response, such as a change in (1) the pharmacokinetics; (2) the pharmacodynamics; (3) genes in the downstream pathway of the drug or (4) the effect of ""off-target"" genes resulting in a response that is unrelated to the intended target. There are many barriers to translation of pharmacogenetic information to the clinic, however, in human medicine, international initiatives are promising real change in the delivery of personalized medicine by 2025. We argue that for effective translation into the veterinary clinic, clinicians, international experts, and stakeholders must collaborate to ensure quality assurance and genetic test validation so that animals may also benefit from this genomics revolution.",Search Behavior in Goat (Capra hircus) Kids From Mothers Kept at Different Animal Densities Throughout Pregnancy.,https://www.ncbi.nlm.nih.gov/pubmed/30854371,Frontiers in veterinary science,2019 03 29,"Individual differences in cognitive performance are often reported but factors related to variation within species are rarely addressed. Goats (Capra hircus) have been subjects of many cognitive studies recently but without focus on individual variation. Among others, factors such as prenatal stress and sex of the individual have been proposed as possible explanations for individual variation in cognitive skills. We aimed to study whether prenatal environment, prenatal stress, litter size, sex, and birth weight influences search behavior skills of goat kids. Pregnant Norwegian dairy goats were exposed to different spatial allowance (namely 1.0, 2.0, or 3.0 m2 per animal) within the commercially applied range during pregnancy and their serum cortisol levels were measured six times within this period. Twenty-six of the kids born entered a three-stage searching task with increasing difficulty when they were 6 weeks old. The tasks included finding a bucket of milk: while moving (stage 1), after moving and disappearing behind a curtain (stage 2), and moving behind a displacement device and the device moving behind a curtain while hiding the bucket (stage 3). We found that prenatal animal density had no effect on the search skills of the offspring, while kids with higher prenatal maternal cortisol levels performed better at the highest stage tested: finding an object after single invisible displacement. At this stage, singleton kids and males performed better than twins and females. Birth weight had no effect at this stage. The findings suggest that maternal cortisol in the observed range had a facilitating effect on cognitive development of goat kids.",Caffeine Ingestion With or Without Low-Dose Carbohydrate Improves Exercise Tolerance in Sedentary Adults.,https://www.ncbi.nlm.nih.gov/pubmed/30854370,Frontiers in nutrition,2019 03 29,"Caffeine (CAF) and carbohydrate (CHO) ingestion delay fatigue during prolonged exercise; however, this is primarily documented in endurance trained (ET) athletes. Our purpose was to determine if these ergogenic aids are also effective to improve exercise tolerance in age-matched sedentary (SED) adults. Using a double-blind crossover design, ET and SED (n = 12 each group) completed four exercise trials consisting of 30 min cycling at standardized matched work rates 10% below lactate threshold (MOD-EX) followed by a time to fatigue (TTF) ride at individually prescribed intensity of 5% above lactate threshold. After standardized breakfast, the following drink treatments were given before and throughout exercise: CAF (3 mg/kg of body mass, equivalent to 1.5 cups premium brewed coffee), low calorie CHO (LCHO) (0.4% solution, 2 g total CHO), CAF+LCHO, and artificially-sweetened placebo (PLA). SED and ET had similar perceived exertion (RPE) during MOD-EX and TTF (23.8 ± 3.1 and 24.1 ± 2.6 min in ET, SED, respectively). LCHO did not benefit exercise tolerance compared to PLA and was less effective (p < 0.05) compared to CAF+LCHO for all participants combined. Thus, the two CAF treatments were averaged, resulting in ~5% lower RPE (p < 0.05) and 21% longer TTF (26.3 ± 10.4 min) compared to the no-CAF (21.7 ± 9.9 min) treatments. Blood glucose and lactate were higher (p < 0.05) with CAF vs. no-CAF. SED and ET only differed in metabolic oxidation rates during exercise (higher overall fat oxidation with ET compared to SED). CAF reduces the perceived effort during exercise and increases the capacity for sedentary individuals, as well as trained athletes, to tolerate higher intensity exercise for greater duration; and, these benefits were not further enhanced by ingesting doses of low carbohydrate regularly during exercise.","A Spectroscopic Investigation of Eu3+ Incorporation in LnPO4 (Ln = Tb, Gd1-xLux, X = 0.3, 0.5, 0.7, 1) Ceramics.",https://www.ncbi.nlm.nih.gov/pubmed/30854369,Frontiers in chemistry,2019 03 29,"We have investigated the incorporation of the luminescent Eu3+ cation in different LnPO4 (Ln = Tb, Gd1-xLu

All samples were analyzed with powder X-ray diffraction (PXRD), Raman spectroscopy, and site-selective time-resolved laser-induced luminescence spectroscopy (TRLFS) directly after synthesis and after an aging time of one year at ambient conditions. The PXRD investigations demonstrate the formation of a TbPO4 phase in an uncommon anhydrite-like crystal structure evoked by a pressure-induced preparation step (grinding). In the Gd1-xLu 
x
 PO4 solid solution series, several different crystal structures are observed depending on the composition. The TRLFS emission spectra of LuPO4, Gd0.3Lu0.7PO4, and Gd0.5Lu0.5PO4 indicate Eu3+-incorporation within a xenotime-type crystal structure. TRLFS and PXRD investigations of the Gd0.7Lu0.3PO4 composition show the presence of anhydrite, xenotime, and monazite phases, implying that xenotime no longer is the favored crystal structure due to the predominance of the substantially larger Gd3+-cation in this solid phase. Eu3+-incorporation occurs predominantly in the anhydrite-like structure with smaller contributions of Eu3+ incorporated in monazite and xenotime. The electronic levels of the Eu3+-dopant in Gd0.3Lu0.7PO4 and Gd0.5Lu0.5PO4 xenotime hosts are strongly coupled to external lattice vibrations, giving rise to high-energy peaks in the obtained excitation spectra. The coupling becomes stronger after aging to such an extent that direct excitation of Eu3+ in the xenotime structure is strongly suppressed. This phenomenon, however, is only visible for materials where Eu3+ was predominantly incorporated within the xenotime structure. Single crystals of Eu3+-doped LuPO4 show no changes upon aging despite the presence of vibronically coupled excitation peaks in the excitation spectra measured directly after synthesis. Based on this observation, we propose a lattice relaxation process occurring in the powder samples during aging, resulting in Eu3+ migration within the crystal structure and Eu3+ accumulation at grain boundaries or xenotime surface sites.",Breakthrough Potential in Near-Infrared Spectroscopy: Spectra Simulation. A Review of Recent Developments.,https://www.ncbi.nlm.nih.gov/pubmed/30854368,Frontiers in chemistry,2019 03 29,"Near-infrared (12,500-4,000 cm-1; 800-2,500 nm) spectroscopy is the hallmark for one of the most rapidly advancing analytical techniques over the last few decades. Although it is mainly recognized as an analytical tool, near-infrared spectroscopy has also contributed significantly to physical chemistry, e.g., by delivering invaluable data on the anharmonic nature of molecular vibrations or peculiarities of intermolecular interactions. In all these contexts, a major barrier in the form of an intrinsic complexity of near-infrared spectra has been encountered. A large number of overlapping vibrational contributions influenced by anharmonic effects create complex patterns of spectral dependencies, in many cases hindering our comprehension of near-infrared spectra. Quantum mechanical calculations commonly serve as a major support to infrared and Raman studies; conversely, near-infrared spectroscopy has long been hindered in this regard due to practical limitations. Advances in anharmonic theories in hyphenation with ever-growing computer technology have enabled feasible theoretical near-infrared spectroscopy in recent times. Accordingly, a growing number of quantum mechanical investigations aimed at near-infrared region has been witnessed. The present review article summarizes these most recent accomplishments in the emerging field. Applications of generalized approaches, such as vibrational self-consistent field and vibrational second order perturbation theories as well as their derivatives, and dense grid-based studies of vibrational potential, are overviewed. Basic and applied studies are discussed, with special attention paid to the ones which aim at improving analytical spectroscopy.

This study aimed to identify strategies and solutions to reduce expenditures in HTP in Iran. Methods: To conduct this qualitative study, the researchers held 15 semi-structured interviews with prominent experts in the research arena in 2018. Content analysis was used to analyze the data using MAXQDA 10 software. Results: Data collection yielded 9 main topics, including purchase and provision medicine, prescription, purchase and use of equipment, diagnostic medical services, referral system, human resources, physical space, payment system, and modifying and increasing base salaries. Conclusion: In Iran's health system, some aspects of HTP wasted resources, eg, the waste of resources in the service delivery system; thus, policymakers should consider proper strategies to control the costs based on the nature of their implementation.",Application of the short form of quality of life instrument version 2 in a large population of Tehran.,https://www.ncbi.nlm.nih.gov/pubmed/30854345,Medical journal of the Islamic Republic of Iran,2019 03 29,"Background: Quality of life (QoL) is now considered as a key indicator in health studies. Therefore, this study was conducted to evaluate QoL in the general population of Tehran (capital of Iran) using SF-12v2 questionnaire and determine some factors associated with it. Methods: This was part of a large population-based cross sectional study conducted in Tehran, Iran, in 2011. Participants were selected from all districts of Tehran using multistage cluster random sampling method. Data were collected using the Iranian version of the SF12v2 questionnaire. Linear regression model was used to assess the independent effect of surveyed variables of the study population on their QoL. P< 0.05 was considered statistically significant. Results: Overall, 30 809 individuals over the age of 20 from 22 urban districts were included in this study and evaluated by SF-12v2 questionnaire. The mean age of the study population was 44.5±15.9, and most of them were female (19 967 (64.8%)). The total mean score of SF-12v2 was 60.4 and the lowest and highest mean scores were observed in GH (46.9±26.5) and MH subscales (64.1±24.7), respectively. It was also observed that District 3 of Tehran had the highest mean score (65.2±18.7) in the total QoL and District 12 had the lowest mean score (56.6±18.7), respectively. The results of multiple linear regression model showed that sex, age, education, household size, presence of chronic disease in family, having insurance, smoking, and marital status were significantly related to most subscales and two summary components of QoL. Conclusion: The results of this study showed that the surveyed population of Tehran had a relatively moderate QoL, but it changed from district to district. It was also observed that age and education of the study population were important variables in relation to QoL.",Molecular identification of Sarcocystis spp. in cattle: partial sequencing of Cytochrome C Oxidase subunit 1 (COI).,https://www.ncbi.nlm.nih.gov/pubmed/30854343,Italian journal of food safety,2019 03 29,"Sarcocystis spp. are protozoan parasites with an obligatory two-host life cycle, with herbivores as intermediate hosts and carnivores as definitive hosts. Cattle are intermediate hosts for several species of Sarcocystis: indeed, in addition to S. cruzi, S. hirsuta and S. hominis, at least four new species were recently identified in bovine muscle: S. bovifelis, S. rommeli, S. bovini and S.heydorni. Since is not possible to unambiguously discriminate between S. hominis and the new species either morphologically or by the analysis of the 18S ribosomial (rRNA) gene, the aim of the present study was to use molecular techniques to discriminate cattle Sarcocystis species, taking advantage of the higher discriminative power of the Cytochrome C Oxidase subunit I mitochondrial (mtDNA COI) gene. Therefore, 119 bovine muscle samples were tested to identify S. hominis-like sarcocystis using a multiplex PCR of the 18S rRNA gene; later, positive samples were tested using a newly designed primer set for the PCR amplification of COI gene. Species identification was achieved by sequencing the amplified products: 16 sequences were confirmed to belong to S. bovifelis, while 12 sequences didn't constitute the best BLAST match of any of the published sequences, allowing to speculate the possible presence of S. hominis. This study confirms the higher discriminatory power of COI mitochondrial gene; besides, our work provides the first report of S. bovifelis in Italy.",Detection of Extended- Spectrum Beta-Lactamase producing Escherichia coli from mesenteric lymph nodes of wild boars (Sus scrofa).,https://www.ncbi.nlm.nih.gov/pubmed/30854342,Italian journal of food safety,2019 03 29,"Wild boars (Sus scrofa) are increasing in several European countries, including Italy. In areas with intensive animal farming, like the Italian Emilia-Romagna region, they are likely to be exposed to antimicrobialresistant (AMR) bacteria of livestock origin. In 2017-2018, 108 mesenteric lymph nodes samples were collected from 108 wild boars hunted in Parma province, Emilia-Romagna region, to be tested for ESBL- and carbapenemase-producing Escherichia coli. One isolate (WB-21L) out of 108 (0.9%) was phenotypically confirmed as ESBLproducing E. coli. The strain WB-21L was tested by PCR for the genes blaSHV, blaCTX-M, blaTEM, blaAmpC, blaKPC, blaNDM, blaVIM, blaIMP, blaOXA-48, blaSPM, blaBIC, blaSIM, blaDIM, blaGIM, blaAIM, resulting positive for TEM β- lactamase. Resistance to ampicillin, amoxicillin/clavulanic acid, streptomycin, sulfasomidine, tetracycline and trimethoprim confirmed the multi-resistance nature of the strain WB-21L. Nine E.coli isolates showed resistance to meropenem by the Kirby Bauer test but none of them showed Meropenem MIC values indicative of resistance. In conclusion, the present study shows the presence of ESBL E. coli in wild boars and the possible risk of transfer to game meat handlers and consumers. Future studies are needed to better evaluate the sources of AMR bacteria in wildlife.",Microbiota analysis and microbiological hazard assessment in poultry carcasses from conventional and antibiotic free farms.,https://www.ncbi.nlm.nih.gov/pubmed/30854341,Italian journal of food safety,2019 03 29,"The aim of this study was to assess microbiota and microbiological hazards in poultry carcasses from animals reared in conventional (n=15) and antibiotic free (n=15) farms. An aliquot of neck and breast skin was obtained from each individual carcass at the end of the refrigeration tunnel and submitted to DNA extraction. Total DNA was sequenced in the 16S rRNA and reads analysed with MG-RAST to classify the colonising bacteria up to the genus level and compare each taxonomic group in terms of mean relative frequency of abundance in conventional and antibiotic free carcasses. Firmicutes displayed abundances always higher than 38% but did not show statistically significative differences between conventional and antibiotic free carcasses. On the contrary, Bacteroidetes and Actinobacteria were significantly higher in antibiotic free then conventional carcasses (21.57 vs 10.95%; 19.29 vs 12.05%), whereas Proteobacteria were higher in the latter (33.19 vs 19.52%). The genera significantly higher in antibiotic free than conventional carcasses were Chryseobacterium (10.07 vs 1.94%), Rothia (3.08 vs 0.77%) and Micrococcus (1.12 vs 0.16%), while Shewanella was significantly higher in conventional carcasses (1.38 vs 0.26%). Among Firmicutes, the genera significantly higher in conventional carcasses were Ureibacillus (1.45 vs 0.11%) and Bacillus (3.28 vs 0.56%). The higher abundance of Proteobacteria in conventional carcasses might suggest that hygienic conditions in conventional farms are worse than antibiotic free farms. However, from a food safety point of view, Salmonella was not detected in both kinds of carcasses and the Campylobacter mean relative frequency of abundance was always lower than 0.4%.",Arcobacter spp. in bovine milk: An emerging pathogen with potential zoonotic risk.,https://www.ncbi.nlm.nih.gov/pubmed/30854340,Italian journal of food safety,2019 03 29,"The aim of the present study was to assess the prevalence and genetic characteristics of Arcobacter spp. in bovine bulk tank milk produced in Apulia Region (Italy). Samples collected from 396 dairy farms, after enrichment in a selective broth, were subjected to an Arcobacter genus - specific Real Time PCR. Positive broths, previously filtered, were seeded on Karmali, MCCD and Columbia Blood Agar plates; presumptive Arcobacter spp. colonies were identified using an amplification and sequencing method and then characterized by Multi-Locus Sequence Typing (MLST). Prevalence of Arcobacter spp. in bovine milk samples was 5% (20/396); A. butzleri was the only isolated species, in agreement with previous studies that reported A. butzleri as the most commonly recovered species in milk and dairy products. MLST analysis of the 20 A. butzleri strains identified 81 alleles and 16 STs. Consistent with previous studies, MLST revealed a high level of heterogeneity between the A. butzleri isolates and confirmed the high discriminatory power of this method and its suitability for epidemiological investigations. This study confirmed the importance of raw milk as a possible source of Arcobacter spp. for humans.",Whole genome sequencing based typing and characterisation of Shiga-toxin producing Escherichia coli strains belonging to O157 and O26 serotypes and isolated in dairy farms.,https://www.ncbi.nlm.nih.gov/pubmed/30854339,Italian journal of food safety,2019 03 29,"In the present study, the genetic relationships as well as the virulome and resistome of newly sequenced O26 and O157 Shiga-toxin producing E. coli (STEC) isolates, collected from dairy farms in Italy, were investigated in comparison to publicly available genomes collected worldwide. The whole genome of Italian isolates was sequenced on Illumina MiSeq Platform. Reads quality control, de novo draft genome assembly, species confirmation and the 7- loci Multi-Locus Sequence Type assignment were performed using INNUca pipeline. Reference-based SNPs calling was performed on O157 and O26 genomes, separately, mapping contigs to high-quality finished genomes. Virulence and antimicrobial resistance determinants were detected in silico using the tool ABRicate. Phylogenetic reconstructions revealed that genomes clustered mainly based on their 7-loci MLST type. The virulome of tested genomes included 190 determinants. O157 genomes carried chu genes associated to heme mediated iron uptake, whereas O26 genomes harboured genes ybt associated to siderophore mediated iron uptake. Resistome analysis showed the presence of tet(34) on all but one O157 genomes and on only one O26 genomes. Only 4 genomes carried genes associated to multiresistance. In the present study, the genes chu and ybt were identified as potential biomarker for the differentiation of O157 and O26 serotypes.",Study on microbial communities in domestic kitchen sponges: Evidence of Cronobacter sakazakii and Extended Spectrum Beta Lactamase (ESBL) producing bacteria.,https://www.ncbi.nlm.nih.gov/pubmed/30854338,Italian journal of food safety,2019 03 29,"Domestic environment, in particular, kitchen setting is a well-established source of microbial contamination. Kitchen sponges represent an important vehicle of microbial transmission and maintenance of spoilage bacteria and pathogenic strains responsible for food borne diseases. The aim of this study was to evaluate the microbial communities of 100 'in-use' kitchen sponges, improving the knowledge on their role in cross-contamination in domestic environment and transmission of ESBLproducing strains. Sponges were processed for: aerobic mesophilic bacteria (AMB), Enterobacteriaceae (EB), yeasts and molds (YM), coagulase-positive staphylococci (CPS), micrococci (MCC), anaerobic sulfite reducing bacteria (ASR), and for the detection of Listeria monocytogenes, Salmonella spp. and Yersinia enterocolitica. A total of 309 enterobacteria strains were identified and then processed for ESBL (Extended Spectrum Beta Lactamase) phenotypical expression. A high contamination level of kitchen sponges was observed (mean value AMB 8.25±1.1; EB 5.89±1.2; YM 5.57±1.1; MCC 4.82±0.1 log CFU/g). Identified enterobacteria strains revealed several opportunistic and pathogenic agents such as Enterobacter cloacae (28%), Citrobacter freundii (23.3%), Cronobacter sakazakii (14.6%) and other strains in lower percentage. Listeria monocytogenes was found in only one sponge (1%). A total of 69 (22.3%) enterobacteria resulted ESBL+, with the following prevalence: P. rettgeri (50%), L. adenocarboxilata (30%), K. pneumoniae (25%), K. oxytoca (25%), C. sakazakii (20%), E. cloacae (20.7%), C. freundii (20.1%). Results confirm the potential role of kitchen sponges as vehicle for food-borne pathogens such as, C. sakazakii for the first time, infectious agents and spoilage microorganisms. The observed high contamination level and the presence of several ESBLs opportunistic pathogens, stresses the necessity to improve a proper education of the consumers on the effective treatment to reduce their microbial loads.","Food safety objectives, criteria, ranking and hierarchization.",https://www.ncbi.nlm.nih.gov/pubmed/30854337,Italian journal of food safety,2019 03 29,"The paper describes the terminology of risk in the view of food safety objectives, criteria, ranking and hierarchization: the terms Performance Criterion, Process Criteria, Product Criterion, Microbiological Criteria, Food Safety Objective, Performance standard, Food safety policy objectives, Risk Assessment Policies, Weighing, Precaution, Prevention, Precautionary principle, Prevention principle, Principle of separation between risk assessment and management, Rank, Ranking, Categorization, Ranking, Priorization, ALARA (As Low Reasonably Achievable), ALOP (Appropriate level of protection), Risk Management, Risk management in the public function are reported and discussed.",Detection of fish allergen by droplet digital PCR.,https://www.ncbi.nlm.nih.gov/pubmed/30854336,Italian journal of food safety,2019 03 29,"Fish is one of fourteen allergens that must be highlighted on the label within the ingredients list. The European regulation is very restrictive to allergens with zero tolerance. Therefore, it is important to establish sensitive and specific methods for detecting fish allergen. Applicability to detect and quantify fish allergen by droplet digital polymerase chain reaction (ddPCR) has been evaluated in this work. Genomic DNA of three species belonging to the most common fish families were analyzed. PCR primers were designed to amplify a 166 bp region of the 18S rRNA gene. Comparative studies were performed to establish the optimal primer and probe concentrations. Annealing temperature was determined by using thermal gradient. The results have shown good applicability of the optimized 18S rRNA gene-method to detect and quantify small amounts of the target in samples analyzed. However, validation studies are needed in order to apply ddPCR technology for routine allergens analysis."

A kidney paired donation (KPD) program consists of altruistic or non-directed donors (NDDs) and pairs, each of which comprises a candidate in need of a kidney transplant and her/his willing but incompatible donor. Potential transplants from NDDs or donors in pairs to compatible candidates in other pairs are determined by computer assessment, though various situations involving either the donor, candidate, or proposed transplant may lead to a potential transplant failing to proceed. A KPD program can be viewed as a directed graph with NDDs and pairs as vertices and potential transplants as edges, where failure probabilities are associated with each vertex and edge. Transplants are carried out in the form of directed cycles among pairs and directed paths initiated by NDDs, which we refer to respectively as cycles and chains. Previous research shows that selecting disjoint subgraphs with a view to creating fallback options when failures occur generates more realized transplants than optimal selection of disjoint chains and cycles. In this paper, we define such subgraphs, which are called locally relevant (LR) subgraphs, and present an efficient algorithm to enumerate all LR subgraphs. Its computational efficiency is significantly better than the previous, more restrictive, algorithms.",Clonal Hematopoiesis in Aging.,https://www.ncbi.nlm.nih.gov/pubmed/30854305,Current stem cell reports,2019 03 29,"Clonal hematopoiesis of indeterminate potential (CHIP) is a common, age-associated condition characterized by the acquisition of somatic mutations.

Combinations of two-dimensional electrophoresis (2-DE) and mass spectrometry (MaSp) were used to study proteomic expression changes during SE of the forest tree. Callus was induced from mature seed embryos, and embryogenic callus (EC) obtained at very low frequency after about 6 month culture. Globular embryos were induced from the seed embryo-derived EC and the subsequent stages of the SE. Analysis of the extracted proteins from globular, heart/torpedo-shaped, and maturing embryo stages resolved in the 2-DE gels showed increased protein expression across developmental stages of the somatic embryos. The mass spectrometric analysis with database search aided identification of 55 out of 100 and 54 selected protein spots. Identified proteins classified by the cellular role which they perform are involved in aspects of stress responses, energy metabolism, carbon fixation, secondary metabolism, and other metabolic functions, while three proteins are of unknown cellular role. The putative role of the expressed proteins during SE provided insight into the physiology of somatic embryo development in N. nimmoniana.",An optimized method to obtain high-quality RNA from cassava storage root.,https://www.ncbi.nlm.nih.gov/pubmed/30854278,3 Biotech,2019 03 29,"Extracting RNA with high quality and integrity is crucial for molecular biology studies in eukaryotes. However, RNA isolation from cassava storage root raises a great concern because it contains large amounts of polysaccharides and polyphenol compounds. In the current study, four RNA extraction methods were evaluated for extracting RNA from cassava storage root. We found that the modified TM method (MTM) is timesaving and low-cost extraction method with high quality and quantities of RNA. The effectiveness of the improved method was assessed for qPCR analysis of four selected genes from total RNA of storage root. The improved protocol generated 4.18-5.94 µg RNA/g fresh weight. An A260/280 ratios of RNA samples are ranged from 2.14 to 2.17. The RIN values are ranged from 7.2 to 8.0.

PCR results revealed that 94.32% (482/511) of B. thuringiensis isolates harbored at least one of the detected genes, of which the cry1A, cry1B, cry2A, cry9, and vip3A genes were detected at frequencies of 90.61%, 89.63%, 76.32%, 40.70%, and 48.18%, respectively. Nineteen gene-combination profiles were discovered among 482 B. thuringiensis isolates, of which the most frequently detected profile contained the cry1A, cry1B, cry2A, and vip3A genes. Sixty-one isolates (12.66%), which harbored all of the detected insecticidal toxin genes, were further detected for the exochitinase (chi36) gene and chitinase activity. The results revealed that all 61 isolates contained the chi36 gene and exhibited chitinase activity. Insect bioassays showed that five isolates were highly toxic (more than 80% mortality) against second instar larvae of Spodoptera litura, of which the highest insect mortality (93%) was obtained from the B. thuringiensis isolates 225-15 and 417-1. Scanning electron microscopy revealed that the crystal morphologies of the five effective isolates were bipyramidal and cuboidal shapes. SDS-PAGE analysis of the spore-crystal mixture showed major bands of approximately 65 and 130 kDa.

Oceans,2019 03 29,"We provide a large data set on salinity anomalies in the ocean's skin layer together with temperature anomalies and meteorological forcing. We observed an average salinity anomaly of 0.40 ± 0.41 practical salinity unity (n = 23,743), and in 83% of the observations the salinity anomaly was positive; that is, the skin layer was more saline. Temperature anomalies determined by an infrared camera were -0.23 ± 0.28 °C (upper 20-μm layer in reference to nominal 1-mm depth) and slightly warmer with -0.19 ± 0.25 °C in an upper 80-μm layer in reference to 1-m depth. In 75% of the observations, our data confirmed the presence of a cooler skin layer. Light rain rates (<4 mm/hr) induced an immediate freshening by 0.25 practical salinity unit in the skin layer without any effect in the mixed layer at 1-m depth. Vertical mixing by strong winds (12 m/s) masked freshening during a heavy rain fall (47 mm/hr) by the intrusion of saltier deeper waters, but a freshening was observed after the wind and rain calmed down. We computed density anomalies, which suggest that denser skin layers can remain afloat up to a density anomaly of 1.3 g/L, likely due to the interfacial tension between the skin layer and underlying bulk water. It implies that salinization by evaporation regulates buoyancy fluxes, a key process for the exchange of climate-relevant gases and heat between the ocean and atmosphere.","Scaling, Anisotropy, and Complexity in Near-Surface Atmospheric Turbulence.",https://www.ncbi.nlm.nih.gov/pubmed/30854274,Journal of geophysical research. Atmospheres : JGR,2019 03 29,"The development of a unified similarity scaling has so far failed over complex surfaces, as scaling studies show large deviations from the empirical formulations developed over flat and horizontally homogeneous terrain as well as large deviations between the different complex terrain data sets. However, a recent study of turbulence anisotropy for flat and horizontally homogeneous terrain has shown that separating the data according to the limiting states of anisotropy (isotropic, two-component axisymmetric and one-component turbulence) improves near-surface scaling. In this paper we explore whether this finding can be extended to turbulence over inclined and horizontally heterogeneous surfaces by examining near-surface scaling for 12 different data sets obtained over terrain ranging from flat to mountainous. Although these data sets show large deviations in scaling when all anisotropy types are examined together, the separation according to the limiting states of anisotropy significantly improves the collapse of data onto common scaling relations, indicating the possibility of a unified framework for turbulence scaling. A measure of turbulence complexity is developed, and the causes for the breakdown of scaling and the physical mechanisms behind the turbulence complexity encountered over complex terrain are identified and shown to be related to the distance to the isotropic state, prevalence of directional shear with height in mountainous terrain, and the deviations from isotropy in the inertial subrange.",Modified Nutrition Risk in Critically Ill (mNUTRIC) Score to Assess Nutritional Risk in Mechanically Ventilated Patients: A Prospective Observational Study from the Pakistani Population.,https://www.ncbi.nlm.nih.gov/pubmed/30854273,Cureus,2019 03 29,"Purpose Typical nutritional assessment criteria and screening tools are ineffective in mechanically ventilated patients who are often unable to report their food intake history. The Nutrition Risk in Critically Ill (NUTRIC) score is effective for screening mechanically ventilated patients. This prospective observational study was conducted to identify nutritional risk in mechanically ventilated patients using a modified NUTRIC (mNUTRIC) score (without using interleukin-6 values). Methods All adult patients admitted to the intensive care unit (ICU) for more than 48 hours were included in the study. Data were collected on the variables required to calculate mNUTRIC scores. Patients with mNUTRIC scores ≥5 were considered at high nutritional risk. The assessment data included total ICU length of stay, ventilator-free days, and mortality rates. Results and conclusion A total of 75 patients fit the inclusion criteria of the study, including 40 males and 35 females. The mean age was 55.8 years. Forty-five percent of mechanically ventilated patients had mNUTRIC scores ≥5. Mechanically ventilated patients with mNUTRIC scores ≥5 had longer lengths of stay in the ICU (mean ± SD = 11.5±5 days) as compared with 3.5±4 days in patients with mNUTRIC scores ≤4. Moreover, a higher mortality rate (26%) was observed in patients with mNUTRIC scores ≥5. A high mNUTRIC predicted mortality score shows a receiver operating characteristic curve of 0.637 with a confidence interval between 0.399 and 0.875. Forty-five percent of mechanically ventilated patients admitted to the ICU were at nutritional risk, and their mNUTRIC scores were directly related to higher lengths of stay and mortality."

Assuming that both ontologies are parts of the Unified Medical Language System (UMLS), the method suggests approximate locations where the target ontology could be extended with new concepts from the reference ontology. However, the final decision about each concept has to be made by a human expert. In this paper, we describe the universe of cross-ontology topological patterns in quantitative terms. We then present a theoretical analysis of the number of potential placements of reference concepts in a path in a target ontology, allowing for new cross-ontology synonyms. This provides a rough estimate of what expert resources need to be allocated for the task. One insight in previous work on this topic was the large percentage of cases where importing concepts was impossible, due to a configuration called ""alternative classification."" In this paper, we confirm this observation. Our target ontology is the National Cancer Institute thesaurus (NCIt). However, the methods can be applied to other pairs of ontologies with hierarchical relationships from the UMLS.",Enhanced Catalytic Activity of Nickel Complexes of an Adaptive Diphosphine-Benzophenone Ligand in Alkyne Cyclotrimerization.,https://www.ncbi.nlm.nih.gov/pubmed/30854242,ACS catalysis,2019 03 29,"Adaptive ligands, which can adapt their coordination mode to the electronic structure of various catalytic intermediates, offer the potential to develop improved homogeneous catalysts in terms of activity and selectivity. 2,2'-Diphosphinobenzophenones have previously been shown to act as adaptive ligands, the central ketone moiety preferentially coordinating reduced metal centers. Herein, the utility of this scaffold in nickel-catalyzed alkyne cyclotrimerization is investigated. The complex [( p-tolL1)Ni(BPI)] ( p-tolL1 = 2,2'-bis(di(para-tolyl)phosphino)-benzophenone; BPI = benzophenone imine) is an active catalyst in the [2 + 2 + 2] cyclotrimerization of terminal alkynes, selectively affording 1,2,4-substituted benzenes from terminal alkynes. In particular, this catalyst outperforms closely related bi- and tridentate phosphine-based Ni catalysts. This suggests a reaction pathway involving a hemilabile interaction of the C=O unit with the nickel center. This is further borne out by a comparative study of the observed resting states and DFT calculations.",Collagen type II suppresses articular chondrocyte hypertrophy and osteoarthritis progression by promoting integrin β1-SMAD1 interaction.,https://www.ncbi.nlm.nih.gov/pubmed/30854241,Bone research,2019 03 29,"Hypertrophic differentiation is not only the terminal process of endochondral ossification in the growth plate but is also an important pathological change in osteoarthritic cartilage. Collagen type II (COL2A1) was previously considered to be only a structural component of the cartilage matrix, but recently, it has been revealed to be an extracellular signaling molecule that can significantly suppress chondrocyte hypertrophy. However, the mechanisms by which COL2A1 regulates hypertrophic differentiation remain unclear. In our study, a Col2a1 p.Gly1170Ser mutant mouse model was constructed, and Col2a1 loss was demonstrated in homozygotes. Loss of Col2a1 was found to accelerate chondrocyte hypertrophy through the bone morphogenetic protein (BMP)-SMAD1 pathway. Upon interacting with COL2A1, integrin β1 (ITGB1), the major receptor for COL2A1, competed with BMP receptors for binding to SMAD1 and then inhibited SMAD1 activation and nuclear import. COL2A1 could also activate ITGB1-induced ERK1/2 phosphorylation and, through ERK1/2-SMAD1 interaction, it further repressed SMAD1 activation, thus inhibiting BMP-SMAD1-mediated chondrocyte hypertrophy. Moreover, COL2A1 expression was downregulated, while chondrocyte hypertrophic markers and BMP-SMAD1 signaling activity were upregulated in degenerative human articular cartilage. Our study reveals novel mechanisms for the inhibition of chondrocyte hypertrophy by COL2A1 and suggests that the degradation and decrease in COL2A1 might initiate and promote osteoarthritis progression.",Predicting the Effect of Bilateral Pelvic Osteotomy on Sagittal Alignment Correction and Surrounding Muscles: A Mathematical Model.,https://www.ncbi.nlm.nih.gov/pubmed/30854240,Advances in orthopedics,2019 03 29,"Study Design. Mathematical Model. Objectives. To investigate the relationship between pelvic osteotomy opening angle (OA) and its effect on spinopelvic sagittal parameters as well as the resting length of surrounding muscles. Methods. Predictive equations correlating OA with spinopelvic parameters were derived using geometric relationships. A geometric model calculated spinopelvic parameters (SVA, pelvic incidence [PI], PT, and T1 pelvic angle [TPA]) produced by progressively increasing the OA. These values were compared to optimal balance criteria in the literature. Four muscles crossing the osteotomy site were evaluated: Gluteus Medius (GMED), Gluteus Maximus (GMAX), Piriformis (P), and Tensor Fascia Lata (TFL). Insertion points were obtained from an OpenSim software model. GMAX and GMED were subdivided into 3 (anterior, middle, and posterior). Results. OA correlated negatively with PI, TPA, and SVA and positively with PT. From baseline SVA of 22 cm, OA 21° reduced SVA to 5cm. OA 23° reduced TPA to 14°. OA 30° increased PT to 20°. OA 26° decreased PI-LL to 10°. OA range of 26°-30° resulted in optimal sagittal deformity correction. OA correlated with SR positively for TFL and anterior GMED and negatively for the rest of muscles. For this OA, the SR approximately decreased 6%, 5%, 6%, 8%, and 5% for posterior GMED, anterior GMAX, middle GMAX, posterior GMAX, and P, respectively. It increased 8% and 4% for anterior GMED and TFL, respectively. Conclusion. Predictive relationships between osteotomy OA and spinopelvic parameters were shown, providing proof of concept that sagittal balance may be achieved via pelvic osteotomy.",Glycosylation Profile of the Transferrin Receptor in Gestational Iron Deficiency and Early-Onset Severe Preeclampsia.,https://www.ncbi.nlm.nih.gov/pubmed/30854239,Journal of pregnancy,2019 03 29,"To examine the expression of hypoxia-inducible factor-1α (HIF-1α), TfR1, and TfR1-attached terminal monosaccharides in placentas of women with IDAP and severe preeclampsia.",Predictors of Unsafe Induced Abortion among Women in Ghana.,https://www.ncbi.nlm.nih.gov/pubmed/30854238,Journal of pregnancy,2019 03 29,Unsafe induced abortion is a major contributor to maternal morbidity and mortality in Ghana.,"The Impact of Scientific and Technical Training on Improving Databases' Adequacy for Fetal Growth Chart Development in Limited-Resource Settings: A Case Study in the Province of South Kalimantan, Indonesia.",https://www.ncbi.nlm.nih.gov/pubmed/30854237,Journal of pregnancy,2019 03 29,To assess the impact of scientific and technical training on midwives' abilities in collecting and recording the key performance indicators for fetal growth chart development in limited-resource settings.,Challenges in the Analysis of Longitudinal Pain Data: Practical Lessons from a Randomized Trial of Annular Closure in Lumbar Disc Surgery.,https://www.ncbi.nlm.nih.gov/pubmed/30854236,Pain research and treatment,2019 03 29,"Purpose. To analyze leg pain severity data from a randomized controlled trial (RCT) of lumbar disc surgery using integrated approaches that adjust pain scores collected at scheduled follow-up visits for confounding clinical events occurring between visits. Methods. Data were derived from an RCT of a bone-anchored annular closure device (ACD) following lumbar discectomy versus lumbar discectomy alone (Control) in patients with large postsurgical annular defects. Leg pain was recorded on a 0 to 100 scale at 6 weeks, 3 months, 6 months, 1 year, and 2 years of follow-up. Patients with pain reduction ≥20 points relative to baseline were considered responders. Unadjusted analyses utilized pain scores reported at follow-up visits. Since symptomatic reherniation signifies clinical failure of lumbar discectomy, integrated analyses adjusted pain scores following a symptomatic reherniation by baseline observation carried forward for continuous data or classification as nonresponders for categorical data. Results. Among 550 patients (272 ACD, 278 Control), symptomatic reherniation occurred in 10.3% of ACD patients and in 21.9% of controls (p < 0.001) through 2 years. There was no difference in leg pain scores at the 2-year visit between ACD and controls (12 versus 14; p = 0.33) in unadjusted analyses, but statistically significant differences favoring ACD (19 versus 29; p < 0.001) in integrated analyses. Unadjusted nonresponder rates were 6.0% with ACD and 6.7% with controls (p = 0.89), but 15.7% and 27.8% (p = 0.001) in integrated analyses. The probability of nonresponse was 16.4% with ACD and 18.3% with controls (p = 0.51) in unadjusted analysis, and 23.7% and 31.2% (p = 0.04) in integrated analyses. Conclusion. In an RCT of lumbar disc surgery, an integrated analysis of pain severity that adjusted for the confounding effects of clinical failures occurring between follow-up visits resulted in different conclusions compared to an unadjusted analysis of pain scores reported at follow-up visits only.",Patient Health Seeking and Diagnostic Delay in Extrapulmonary Tuberculosis: A Hospital Based Study from Central India.,https://www.ncbi.nlm.nih.gov/pubmed/30854235,Tuberculosis research and treatment,2019 03 29,"We aimed to investigate the awareness, health care seeking behavior, and diagnostic delay in extrapulmonary tuberculosis (EPTB) in a resource-constrained setting from Central India."

Here, we report a novel, rare SFTPA1 variant in a family with idiopathic interstitial pneumonia (IIP). We performed whole-exome sequencing on germline DNA samples from four members of one family; three of them showed signs of pulmonary fibrosis (idiopathic interstitial pneumonia) with autosomal-dominant inheritance. A heterozygous single nucleotide variant c.532 G > A in the SFTPA1 gene has been identified. This variant encodes the substitution p.(Val178Met), localized within the carbohydrate recognition domain of surfactant protein A and segregates with the genes causing idiopathic interstitial pneumonia. This rare variant has not been previously reported. We also analyzed the detected sequence variant in the protein structure in silico. The replacement of valine by the larger methionine inside the protein may cause a disruption in the protein structure. The c.532 G > A variant was further validated using Sanger sequencing of the amplicons, confirming the diagnosis in all symptomatic family members. Moreover, this variant was also found by Sanger sequencing in one other symptomatic family member and one young asymptomatic family member. The autosomal-dominant inheritance, the family history of IIP, and the evidence of a mutation occurring in part of the SFTPA1 gene all suggest a novel variant that causes FIP.",Comparative transcriptome analysis uncovers the regulatory functions of long noncoding RNAs in fruit development and color changes of Fragaria pentaphylla.,https://www.ncbi.nlm.nih.gov/pubmed/30854215,Horticulture research,2019 06 10,"To investigate the molecular mechanism underlying fruit development and color change, comparative transcriptome analysis was employed to generate transcriptome profiles of two typical wild varieties of Fragaria pentaphylla at three fruit developmental stages (green fruit stage, turning stage, and ripe fruit stage). We identified 25,699 long noncoding RNAs (lncRNAs) derived from 25,107 loci in the F. pentaphylla fruit transcriptome, which showed distinct stage- and genotype-specific expression patterns. Time course analysis detected a large number of differentially expressed protein-coding genes and lncRNAs associated with fruit development and ripening in both of the F. pentaphylla varieties. The target genes downregulated in the late stages were enriched in terms of photosynthesis and cell wall organization or biogenesis, suggesting that lncRNAs may act as negative regulators to suppress photosynthesis and cell wall organization or biogenesis during fruit development and ripening of F. pentaphylla. Pairwise comparisons of two varieties at three developmental stages identified 365 differentially expressed lncRNAs in total. Functional annotation of target genes suggested that lncRNAs in F. pentaphylla may play roles in fruit color formation by regulating the expression of structural genes or regulatory factors. Construction of the regulatory network further revealed that the low expression of Fra a and CHS may be the main cause of colorless fruit in F. pentaphylla.","MdGSTF6, activated by MdMYB1, plays an essential role in anthocyanin accumulation in apple.",https://www.ncbi.nlm.nih.gov/pubmed/30854214,Horticulture research,2019 03 29,"Anthocyanins are biosynthesized on the cytosolic surface of the endoplasmic reticulum and then transported into the vacuole for storage. Glutathione S-transferases (GSTs) are considered to be responsible for the transport of anthocyanins into the vacuole. However, the regulatory mechanisms of GSTs in plants are still unclear. Here, we performed a genome-wide analysis and identified 69 GST genes in apple. The expression of MdGSTF6 was positively correlated with the anthocyanin content (r = 0.949) during 'Yanfu 8' fruit development. The overexpression of MdGSTF6 in the Arabidopsis thaliana tt19 mutant resulted in seedlings of 35S::MdGSTF6-GFP/tt19 that could accumulate anthocyanin and rescue its phenotype, suggesting that MdGSTF6 was an anthocyanin transporter. The silencing of MdGSTF6 affected anthocyanin accumulation in apple fruit. Moreover, the knockdown of MdGSTF6 by RNA interference in cultured 'Gala' seedlings inhibited anthocyanin accumulation. The interaction experiments showed that MdMYB1 could bind directly to the MdGSTF6 promoter to transcriptionally activate its expression. Collectively, our results demonstrate that MdGSTF6 encodes an important GST transporter of anthocyanins in apple fruit and provide evidence for the associated regulatory mechanisms. Therefore, MdMYB1 can not only regulate anthocyanin synthesis, but also control the transport of anthocyanin in apples. This information may be useful for further clarifying the regulation of anthocyanin transport in apple.","What makes turnips: anatomy, physiology and transcriptome during early stages of its hypocotyl-tuber development.",https://www.ncbi.nlm.nih.gov/pubmed/30854213,Horticulture research,2019 03 29,"Brassica species are characterized by their tremendous intraspecific diversity, exemplified by leafy vegetables, oilseeds, and crops with enlarged inflorescences or above ground storage organs. In contrast to potato tubers that are edible storage organs storing energy as starch and are the vegetative propagation modules, the storage organs of turnips, grown from true seed, are swollen hypocotyls with varying degrees of root and stem that mainly store glucose and fructose. To highlight their anatomical origin, we use the term ""hypocotyl-tuber"" for these turnip vegetative storage organs. We combined cytological, physiological, genetic and transcriptomic approaches, aiming to identify the initial stages, molecular pathways and regulatory genes for hypocotyl-tuber induction in turnips (B. rapa subsp. rapa). We first studied the development of the hypocotyl zone of turnip and Pak choi and found that 16 days after sowing (DAS) morphological changes occurred in the xylem which indicated the early tuberization stage. Tissue culture experiments showed a clear effect of auxin on hypocotyl-tuber growth. Differentially expressed genes between 1 and 6 weeks after sowing in turnip hypocotyls, located in genomic regions involved in tuber initiation and/or tuber growth defined by QTL and selective sweeps for tuber formation, were identified as candidate genes that were studied in more detail for their role in hypocotyl-tuber formation. This included a Bra-FLOR1 paralogue with increased expression 16 DAS, when the hypocotyl starts swelling, suggesting dual roles for duplicated flowering time genes in flowering and hypocotyl-tuber induction. Bra-CYP735A2 was identified for its possible role in tuber growth via trans-zeatin. Weigthed Co-expression Network Analysis (WGCNA) identified 59 modules of co-expressed genes. Bra-FLOR1 and Bra-CYP735A2 were grouped in a module that included several genes involved in carbohydrate transport and metabolism, cell-wall growth, auxin regulation and secondary metabolism that serve as starting points to illuminate the transcriptional regulation of hypocotyl-tuber formation and development.",EGTA reduces the inflorescence stem mechanical strength of herbaceous peony by modifying secondary wall biosynthesis.,https://www.ncbi.nlm.nih.gov/pubmed/30854212,Horticulture research,2019 03 29,"The mechanical strength of inflorescence stems is an important trait in cut flowers. Calcium ions (Ca2+) play a pivotal role in maintaining stem strength, but little is known about the underlying molecular mechanisms. In this study, we treated herbaceous peony (Paeonia lactiflora Pall.) with ethyl glycol tetraacetic acid (EGTA), an effective Ca2+ chelator, and used morphology indicators, spectroscopic analysis, histochemical staining, electron microscopy, and proteomic techniques to investigate the role of Ca2+ in inflorescence stem mechanical strength. The EGTA treatment reduced the mechanical strength of inflorescence stems, triggered the loss of Ca2+ from cell walls, and reduced lignin in thickened secondary walls in xylem cells as determined by spectroscopic analysis and histochemical staining. Electron microscopy showed that the EGTA treatment also resulted in significantly fewer xylem cell layers with thickened secondary walls as well as in reducing the thickness of these secondary walls. The proteomic analysis showed 1065 differentially expressed proteins (DEPs) at the full-flowering stage (S4). By overlapping the Kyoto encyclopedia of genes and genomes (KEGG) and gene ontology (GO) analysis results, we identified 43 DEPs involved in signal transduction, transport, energy metabolism, carbohydrate metabolism, and secondary metabolite biosynthesis. Using quantitative real-time polymerase chain reaction (qRT-PCR) analysis, we showed that EGTA treatment inhibited Ca2+ sensors and secondary wall biosynthesis-related genes. Our findings revealed that EGTA treatment reduced the inflorescence stem mechanical strength by reducing lignin deposition in xylem cells through altering the expression of genes involved in Ca2+ binding and secondary wall biosynthesis.",Unbiased subgenome evolution following a recent whole-genome duplication in pear (Pyrus bretschneideri Rehd.).,https://www.ncbi.nlm.nih.gov/pubmed/30854211,Horticulture research,2019 03 29,"Genome fractionation (also known as diploidization) frequently occurs following paleopolyploidization events. Biased fractionation between subgenomes has been found in some paleo-allopolyploids, while this phenomenon is absent in paleo-autopolyploids. Pear (Pyrus bretschneideri Rehd.) experienced a recent whole-genome duplication (WGD, ~30 million years ago); however, the evolutionary fate of the two subgenomes derived from this WGD event is not clear. In this study, we identified the two paleo-subgenomes in pear using peach (Prunus persica) as an outgroup and investigated differences in the gene loss rate, evolutionary rate, gene expression level, and DNA methylation level between these two subgenomes. Fractionation bias was not found between the two pear subgenomes, which evolved at similar evolutionary rates. The DNA methylation level of the two subgenomes showed little bias, and we found no expression dominance between the subgenomes. However, we found that singleton genes and homeologous genes within each subgenome showed divergent evolutionary patterns of selective constraints, expression and epigenetic modification. These results provide insights into subgenome evolution following paleopolyploidization in pear.",Genome-wide comprehensive analysis of transcriptomes and small RNAs offers insights into the molecular mechanism of alkaline stress tolerance in a citrus rootstock.,https://www.ncbi.nlm.nih.gov/pubmed/30854210,Horticulture research,2019 03 29,"Alkaline stress has serious-negative effects on citrus production. Ziyang xiangcheng (Citrus junos Sieb. ex Tanaka) (Cj) is a rootstock that is tolerant to alkaline stress and iron deficiency. Trifoliate orange (Poncirus trifoliata (L.) Raf.) (Pt), the most widely used rootstock in China, is sensitive to alkaline stress. To investigate the molecular mechanism underlying the tolerance of Cj to alkaline stress, next-generation sequencing was employed to profile the root transcriptomes and small RNAs of Cj and Pt seedlings that were cultured in nutrient solutions along a three pH gradient. This two-level regulation data set provides a system-level view of molecular events with a precise resolution. The data suggest that the auxin pathway may play a central role in the inhibitory effect of alkaline stress on root growth and that the regulation of auxin homeostasis under alkaline stress is important for the adaptation of citrus to alkaline stress. Moreover, the jasmonate (JA) pathway exhibits the opposite response to alkaline stress in Cj and Pt and may contribute to the differences in the alkaline stress tolerance and iron acquisition between Cj and Pt. The dataset provides a wealth of genomic resources and new clues to further study the mechanisms underlying alkaline stress resistance in Cj.",Wide transcriptional investigation unravel novel insights of the on-tree maturation and postharvest ripening of 'Abate Fetel' pear fruit.,https://www.ncbi.nlm.nih.gov/pubmed/30854209,Horticulture research,2019 03 29,"To decipher the transcriptomic regulation of the on-tree fruit maturation in pear cv. 'Abate Fetel', a RNA-seq transcription analysis identified 8939 genes differentially expressed across four harvesting stages. These genes were grouped into 11 SOTA clusters based on their transcriptional pattern, of which three included genes upregulated while the other four were represented by downregulated genes. Fruit ripening was furthermore investigated after 1 month of postharvest cold storage. The most important variation in fruit firmness, production of ethylene and volatile organic compounds were observed after 5 days of shelf-life at room temperature following cold storage. The role of ethylene in controlling the ripening of 'Abate Fetel' pears was furthermore investigated through the application of 1-methylcyclopropene, which efficiently delayed the progression of ripening by reducing fruit softening and repressing both ethylene and volatile production. The physiological response of the interference at the ethylene receptor level was moreover unraveled investigating the expression pattern of 12 candidate genes, initially selected to validate the RNA-seq profile. This analysis confirmed the effective role of the ethylene competitor in downregulating the expression of cell wall (PG) and ethylene-related genes (ACS, ACO, ERS1, and ERS2), as well as inducing one element involved in the auxin signaling pathway (Aux/IAA), highlighting a possible cross-talk between these two hormones. The expression patterns of these six elements suggest their use as molecular toolkit to monitor at molecular level the progression of the fruit on-tree maturation and postharvest ripening."

The aim of this study is to assess the prevalence of dental caries among Egyptian children and adolescents in correlation with age, gender, body mass index, socioeconomic status, parental education, biological risk factors and dietary habits. Methods: A total number of 369 Egyptian children and adolescents (age ranges from 3-18 years) were examined over the period from 15 th November 2017 to 13 th January 2018. Socio-demographic data, oral hygiene measures and dietary habits for children were recorded. Dental status was analyzed using decayed, missing and filled tooth index (dmft) for deciduous dentition and (DMFT) index for permanent dentition. For mixed dentition (deft) index was used, d (decayed tooth indicated for filling), e (decayed tooth indicated for extraction) and f (filled tooth). Results: 74% of the children had dental caries with mean dmft: 3.23±4.07; deft: 4.21±3.21; DMFT: 1.04±1.56. In primary dentition, dmft of the children was positively correlated with age, beans, candies, crackers, chocolates and inversely correlated with gender, socio-economic status (SES), parental education, brushing frequency of the parent, brushing frequency of the parent to the child teeth, brushing frequency of the child and consumption of eggs, fruits/vegetables, milk and milk products. In mixed dentition, deft was positively correlated with candies, crackers, citric juices, while negatively correlated with age, SES, parental education, brushing frequency of the parent to the child, brushing frequency of the child, fruits/vegetables. In permanent dentition, DMFT in children was positively correlated with age and chocolates while not correlated with any of the remaining risk factors. Conclusion: The present study clarifies the significant risk factors associated with dental caries amongst Egyptian children. This will help in planning strategies to prevent and treat such disease.","40 years of the human T-cell leukemia virus: past, present, and future.",https://www.ncbi.nlm.nih.gov/pubmed/30854194,F1000Research,2019 03 29,"It has been nearly 40 years since human T-cell leukemia virus-1 (HTLV-1), the first oncogenic retrovirus in humans and the first demonstrable cause of cancer by an infectious agent, was discovered. Studies indicate that HTLV-1 is arguably one of the most carcinogenic agents to humans. In addition, HTLV-1 causes a diverse array of diseases, including myelopathy and immunodeficiency, which cause morbidity and mortality to many people in the world, including the indigenous population in Australia, a fact that was emphasized only recently. HTLV-1 can be transmitted by infected lymphocytes, from mother to child via breast feeding, by sex, by blood transfusion, and by organ transplant. Therefore, the prevention of HTLV-1 infection is possible but such action has been taken in only a limited part of the world. However, until now it has not been listed by the World Health Organization as a sexually transmitted organism nor, oddly, recognized as an oncogenic virus by the recent list of the National Cancer Institute/National Institutes of Health. Such underestimation of HTLV-1 by health agencies has led to a remarkable lack of funding supporting research and development of treatments and vaccines, causing HTLV-1 to remain a global threat. Nonetheless, there are emerging novel therapeutic and prevention strategies which will help people who have diseases caused by HTLV-1. In this review, we present a brief historic overview of the key events in HTLV-1 research, including its pivotal role in generating ideas of a retrovirus cause of AIDS and in several essential technologies applicable to the discovery of HIV and the unraveling of its genes and their function. This is followed by the status of HTLV-1 research and the preventive and therapeutic developments of today.

However, whereas all women experience fluctuations in ovarian hormones across the menstrual cycle, not all women binge eat in response to these fluctuations, suggesting that other factors must contribute. Stress is one potential contributing factor. Specifically, it may be that hormone-BE associations are stronger in women who experience high levels of stress, particularly as stress has been shown to be a precipitant to BE episodes in women. To date, no studies have directly examined stress as a moderator of hormone-BE associations, but indirect data (that is, associations between BE and stress and between ovarian hormones and stress) could provide initial clues about moderating effects. Given the above, the purpose of this narrative review was to evaluate these indirect data and their promise for understanding the role of stress in hormone-BE associations. Studies examining associations between all three phenotypes (that is, ovarian hormones, stress, and BE) in animals and humans were reviewed to provide the most thorough and up-to-date review of the literature on the potential moderating effects of stress on ovarian hormone-BE associations. Overall, current evidence suggests that associations between hormones and BE may be stronger in women with high stress levels, possibly via altered hypothalamic-pituitary-adrenal axis response to stress and increased sensitivity to and altered effects of ovarian hormones during stress. Additional studies are necessary to directly examine stress as a moderator of ovarian hormone-BE associations and identify the mechanisms underlying these effects.",Recent advances in understanding immune phenotypes of thyroid carcinomas: prognostication and emerging therapies.,https://www.ncbi.nlm.nih.gov/pubmed/30854191,F1000Research,2019 03 29,"Tumors modulate the host immune cells within their microenvironment to avoid recognition and elimination by our immune system, a phenotype called cancer immune escape.

Therefore, we will describe the immune-landscape and phenotypes of thyroid cancer, we will summarize studies investigating the expression of immunomodulatory molecules, and we will finally describe the preclinical and clinical trials investigating the utility of immunotherapies in the management of thyroid cancer.",Epidiolex as adjunct therapy for treatment of refractory epilepsy: a comprehensive review with a focus on adverse effects.,https://www.ncbi.nlm.nih.gov/pubmed/30854190,F1000Research,2019 03 29,"Medically refractory epilepsy remains an area of intense clinical and scientific interest since a significant porportion of patients continue to suffer from debilitating seizures despite available therapies. In this setting, recent studies have focused on assessing the benefits of cannabidiol (CBD)-enriched cannabis, a plant based product without psychoactive properties which has been shown to decrease seizure frequency in animal models. More recently, several randomized controlled and open label trials have studied the effects of Epidiolex, a 99% pure oral CBD extract, on patients with refractory epilepsy. This in turn has led to the FDA approval of and more recently, to the Drug Enforcement Administration's placement of Epidiolex into schedule V of the Controlled Substances Act (CSA). In this review, we summarize the major findings of several recent large-scale studies using this product with a focus on its adverse effects.",Automated Subfield Volumetric Analysis of Hippocampus in Patients with Drug-Naïve Nondementia Parkinson's Disease.,https://www.ncbi.nlm.nih.gov/pubmed/30854188,Parkinson's disease,2019 03 29,"Several studies used automated segmentation of hippocampal subfield (ASHS) for detailed measurements of anatomic subregions of the hippocampus, especially in the field of neurodegenerative disorders. In this study, we investigated the hippocampal subfield volume of patients with early-stage nondementia PD compared with normal healthy subjects using the ASHS method. A total of 32 subjects were enrolled in this study (sixteen patients with drug naive nondementia PD and sixteen healthy controls). All subjects were scanned with a 1.5 tesla MRI. The volumes of the seven subfields were calculated separately, and then, the whole hippocampal volume was calculated by the summing of CA1, CA2-3, CA4-DG, subiculum, presubiculum, and fimbria, excluding the hippocampal fissure. There were significant diagnosis-by-hemisphere interactive effects on the total hippocampal volume (F = 5.197; p=0.031) and the subfield volume of CA2-3 (F = 7.586; p=0.010) and CA4-DG (F = 7.403; p=0.011). The volumes of CA2-3 (F = 19.911; p < 0.001), CA4-DG (F = 20.273; p < 0.001), and total hippocampus (F = 10.573; p=0.005) in the left hemisphere were reduced compared to the right hemisphere. We suggest that the hippocampal volume asymmetry, especially in CA4-DG and CA2-3, could be observed in drug-naïve PD patients even in the early stage of the disease.",Cortical Visual Performance Test Setup for Parkinson's Disease Based on Motion Blur Orientation.,https://www.ncbi.nlm.nih.gov/pubmed/30854187,Parkinson's disease,2019 03 29,"Studies on Parkinson's disease (PD) are becoming very popular on multidisciplinary platforms. The development of predictable telemonitored early detection models has become closely related to many different research areas. The aim of this article is to develop a visual performance test that can examine the effects of Parkinson's disease on the visual cortex, which can be a subtitle scoring test in UPDRS. However, instead of showing random images and asking for discrepancies between them, it is expected that the questions to be asked to patients should be provable in the existing cortex models, should be deduced between the images, and produce a reference threshold value to compare with the practical results. In a developed test, horizontal and vertical motion blur orientation was applied to natural image samples, and then neural outputs were produced by representing three (original-horizontal-vertical) image groups with the Layer 4 (L4) cortex model. This image representation is then compared with a filtering model which is very similar to thalamus' functionality. Thus, the linear problem-solving performance of the L4 cortex model is also addressed in the study. According to the obtained classification results, the L4 model produces high-performance success rates compared to the thalamic model, which shows the adaptation power of the visual cortex on the image pattern differences. In future studies, developed motion-based visual tests are planned to be applied to PD patient groups/controls, and their performances with mathematical threshold values will be examined.",Driving with Parkinson's Disease: Exploring Lived Experience.,https://www.ncbi.nlm.nih.gov/pubmed/30854186,Parkinson's disease,2019 03 29,"A growing body of literature has explored the impact of Parkinson's disease (PD) on fitness to drive. As such, evidence now supports the use of specific clinical tests for screening purposes, the predictive validity of risk impressions, and the critical driving errors that predict on-road pass/fail outcomes in this population. However, little is known about the lived experiences of persons with PD as they navigate driving-related concerns such as driving impairments, cessation, potential threats to independence, and community mobility. This qualitative secondary data analysis aimed to explore the driving-related lived experiences of persons with PD. We utilized summative content analysis to identify themes related to driving from transcribed interviews with nineteen community-dwelling individuals with PD who participated in the primary study. Five themes emerged within the analysis: (1) the meaning and significance of driving; (2) driving cessation; (3) modified driving behaviors; (4) factors affecting driving; and (5) accessibility. Participants identified driving as an activity that holds significant importance-both directly (i.e., as a primary activity) and as a means for enabling other activities. This study lays the foundation for the development of client-centred and evidence-informed driving interventions for individuals with PD, as well as the development of driving retirement programs.",The Lived Experiences of Deep Brain Stimulation in Parkinson's Disease: An Interpretative Phenomenological Analysis.,https://www.ncbi.nlm.nih.gov/pubmed/30854185,Parkinson's disease,2019 03 29,"Deep brain stimulation of the subthalamic nucleus (STN-DBS) is an effective treatment for Parkinson's disease (PD).

The first, ""Healed and relieved: all that glitters is not gold,"" highlights the benefits and the personal ""costs"" of surgery. The second, ""The change within: new interpretations of the present and future unfold,"" explores how patients reinterpreted their lives as individuals and members of society in the present and as they face their future. Relief, gratitude, disappointment, and the need for social support are expressed as well as a new appraisal of values and the future. STN-DBS alters the life course of people with PD, and this study provides new insight into psychological and social issues that surgery raises for the patient and their family system. These psychosocial issues should be taken into account when preparing the patient and their family for surgery or supporting them postoperatively."

However, currently there are no systems that list gender as a prognostic factor. We queried a National Cancer Institute database to investigate the prognostic influence of gender on the survival of patients with MDS. We first identified 34,681 qualified patients diagnosed with MDS from 2001-2014 in the Surveillance, Epidemiology, and End Results (SEER) database, and then analyzed the characteristics of these patients using chi-squared tests. The Kaplan-Meier method and the multivariate Cox regression model were used to examine whether gender disparity in the survival of patients with MDS existed. We found that male patients had higher incidence rate of MDS (55.3% vs 44.7%, P<0.001) and a significant survival disadvantage (27.6% vs 33.6%, P<0.001) compared to female patients. Moreover, the less favorable survival rate of male MDS patients was associated with the age at diagnosis, race, marital status at diagnosis and the histological subtypes including refractory anemia (RA), refractory cytopenia with multilineage dysplasia (RCMD), myelodysplastic associated with isolated del 5q (MDS 5q-), myelodysplastic/myeloproliferative neoplasm (MDS/MPN) and not otherwise specified (NOS).

Prognostic nomograms were formulated for OS and RFS prediction of ICC patients. Our results showed Oct4 and Nanog highly expressed in ICC tumor tissues and were identified as independent prognostic factors for patients' OS and RFS. Significant positive correlation was found between Oct4 and Nanog expression. Co-expression of Oct4 and Nanog implied the poorest OS and RFS in ICC patients. Our nomograms comprising Oct4 and Nanog achieved better predictive accuracy in training and validation cohorts compared with AJCC 7th edition and LCSGJ stage for OS and RFS prediction. Our study support the high expression of Oct4 and Nanog in ICC implies aggressive tumor behaviors and suggest a poor clinical prognosis, which emerges as valuable biomarkers for identifying patients at high risk after curative resection.","Survival Benefit of Preoperative Versus Postoperative Radiotherapy in Metastatic Rectal Cancer Treated With Definitive Surgical Resection of Primary Tumor: A Population Based, Propensity Score-Matched Study.",https://www.ncbi.nlm.nih.gov/pubmed/30854140,Journal of Cancer,2019 05 10,"Preoperative chemoradiation followed by surgery has been recommended as a standard treatment for patients with stage II/III rectal cancer. However, the optimal sequencing of radiotherapy for metastatic rectal cancer remains unclear. Between 2004 and 2014, patients diagnosed with metastatic rectal cancer who underwent the resection of primary site and received radiotherapy were retrospectively selected using the Surveillance, Epidemiology, and End Results (SEER) database. The propensity score matching analyses were used to lessen the effects of confounding factors including age, sex, race, marital status, serum carcinoembryonic antigen level, histologic type, differentiation status, tumor size, T stage, N stage and resection of the distant lesions. The cancer-specific survival (CSS) were compared based on the sequencing of radiotherapy. Ultimately, 686 matched pairs were formed for comparison of preoperative versus postoperative radiotherapy. The 5-year CSS estimates were 33.4% (95% CI: 28.9%-37.9%) and 26.8% (95% CI: 22.7%-30.9%) for patients underwent preoperative radiotherapy followed by resection of primary lesion and postoperative radiotherapy after surgery, respectively. Patients underwent preoperative radiotherapy had better CSS as compared to patients received postoperative radiotherapy (p<0.001 for log-rank test). Multivariate analysis demonstrated that preoperative radiotherapy group was associated with significantly decreased risk for cancer death (HR=0.820, 95% CI: 0.712-0.945, p=0.006). Preoperative radiotherapy was superior to postoperative radiotherapy in patients with metastatic rectal cancer.

Patients and methods: We retrospectively analyzed 2439 consecutive non-metastasis nasopharyngeal carcinoma patients between January 2001 and December 2004 at the Sun Yat-sen University Cancer Center. Survival outcomes were compared using Kaplan-Meier method. Univariate and multivariate analysis was performed by Cox regression model. Chi-square test was performed to compare categorical variables. Results: In the whole patients, compared with non-O blood type (A, B, and AB) patients, O blood type patients had significantly lower 5-year distant metastasis-free survival (DMFS) (adjusted hazard ratio (aHR)= 1.268, 95% CI 1.010-1.592, P=0.041). Moreover, we observed in female patients, O blood type patients had significantly lower 5-year overall survival (OS), disease-specific survival (DSS) and DMFS than those with non-O blood type (aHR=1.495, 95% CI 1.032-2.165, P=0.034 for OS; aHR=1.566, 95% CI 1.054-2.328, P=0.026 for DSS; aHR=1.779, 95% CI 1.056-2.998, P=0.030 for DMFS). In male patients, there was no significant difference observed between O blood type patients and non-O blood type patients in any survival endpoints. Conclusion: O blood type was associated with an unfavorable DMFS in female patients with nasopharyngeal carcinoma in epidemic area, which might contribute to unfavorable OS and DSS in female patients, even contribute to a lower DMFS in the whole patients. It might be beneficial to predict metastasis so as to guide the treatment in female patients with nasopharyngeal carcinoma in epidemic area.",Lower Expression of Gelsolin in Colon Cancer and Its Diagnostic Value in Colon Cancer Patients.,https://www.ncbi.nlm.nih.gov/pubmed/30854138,Journal of Cancer,2019 05 10,"Colon cancer is one of the most common malignancies causing the majority of cancer-related deaths. Gelsolin (GSN) has been found to be dysregulated in various cancers. However, the secreted GSN in colon cancer remains largely unknown. In the present study, we explored the expression profile of GSN in colon cancer tissues and the diagnostic value of serum GSN in colon cancer. In addition, the effects of secreted GSN in colon cancer cells were studied. We thus found that immunoreactive GSN levels were significantly lower in colon cancer tissues than those in non-tumor colon tissues. Functional studies demonstrated that secreted GSN could restrain cell invasion and migration in vitro. Mechanistically, dose dependent recombinant GSN down-regulated the expression of MMP2 and MMP9, which might restrain the process of cell invasion and migration. Furthermore, serum levels of GSN were significantly lower in colon cancer patients than those in healthy volunteers, and ROC curves showed serum level of GSN had a better diagnostic value for colon cancer (AUC=0.932) than the traditional tumor biomarker Carcinoembryonic Antigen (CEA) or Carbohydrate Antigen 19-9 (CA199). In conclusion, our results suggest that the secreted GSN restrains the invasion and migration of colon cancer cells. Meanwhile, the serum GSN may be a new biomarker for the diagnosis of colon cancer.",Antitumor activity of histone deacetylase inhibitor chidamide alone or in combination with epidermal growth factor receptor tyrosine kinase inhibitor icotinib in NSCLC.,https://www.ncbi.nlm.nih.gov/pubmed/30854137,Journal of Cancer,2019 03 29,"The study was performed to investigate the antitumor efficacy of histone deacetylase inhibitor (HDACi) chidamide alone or with epidermal growth factor receptor tyrosine kinase inhibitor (EGFR-TKI) icotinib in non-small cell lung cancer (NSCLC). The cell viability, cell cycle, apoptosis, protein expression, and the molecular mechanisms were explored among ten NSCLC cell lines with chidamide and icotinib alone or in combination, and further validated in xenograft models of nude mice. Chidamide significantly reduced the viability of A549, HCC827, HCC827IR (icotinib resistant) cells, increased the sensitivity of icotinib synergistically in EGFR-TKI resistant cell line, especially in H1975 cells. Chidamide alone or combined with icotinib induced cell cycle arrest by inhibiting the activation of RAS/MAPK, PI3K/AKT and/or JAK/STAT pathways, and caused apoptosis by activating caspase 3 and PARP. Chidamide alone or with icotinib suppressed β-catenin expression in HCC827, HCC827IR, and H1975 cells. The sensitivity of H1975 cells to icotinib was increased by chidamide through restoring E-cadherin expression. Furthermore, chidamide alone or in combination with icotinib inhibited HCC827IR and H1975 xenograft growth in athymic nude mice, respectively, with no appreciable side effects. Chidamide or combinating with icotinib exhibits antitumor activity in NSCLC cells, and has potential clinical implication for the treatment of NSCLC.",Development and Validation of Nomograms Predictive of Axillary Nodal Status to Guide Surgical Decision-Making in Early-Stage Breast Cancer.,https://www.ncbi.nlm.nih.gov/pubmed/30854136,Journal of Cancer,2019 05 10,"Purpose: To develop and validate nomogram models using noninvasive imaging parameters with related clinical variables to predict the extent of axillary nodal involvement and stratify treatment options based on the essential cut-offs for axillary surgery according to the ACOSOG Z0011 criteria. Materials and Methods: From May 2007 to December 2017, 1799 patients who underwent preoperative breast and axillary magnetic resonance imaging (MRI) were retrospectively studied. Patients with data on axillary ultrasonography (AUS) were enrolled. The MRI images were interpreted according to Breast Imaging Reporting and Data system (BI-RADS). Using logistic regression analyses, nomograms were developed to visualize the associations between the predictors and each lymph node (LN) status endpoint. Predictive performance was assessed based on the area under the receiver operating characteristic curve (AUC). Bootstrap resampling was performed for internal validation. Goodness-of-fit of the models was evaluated using the Hosmer-Lemeshow test. Results: Of 397 early breast cancer patients, 200 (50.4%) had disease-free axilla, 119 (30.0%) had 1 or 2 positive LNs, and 78 (19.6%) had ≥3 positive LNs. Patient age, MRI features (mass margin, LN margin, presence/absence of LN hilum, and LN symmetry/asymmetry), and AUS descriptors (presence of cortical thickening or hilum) were identified as predictors of nodal disease. Nomograms with these predictors showed good calibration and discrimination; the AUC was 0.809 for negative axillary node (N0) vs. any LN metastasis, 0.749 for 1 or 2 involved nodes vs. N0, and 0.874 for ≥3 nodes vs. ≤2 metastatic nodes. The predictive ability of the 3 nomograms with additional pathological variables was significantly greater. Conclusion: The nomograms could predict the extent of ALN metastasis and facilitate decision-making preoperatively.",Prognosis of EGFR-mutant advanced lung adenocarcinoma patients with different intrathoracic metastatic patterns.,https://www.ncbi.nlm.nih.gov/pubmed/30854135,Journal of Cancer,2019 05 10,"Introduction: Lung cancer diagnosed solely with the presence of intrathoracic metastases is classified as M1a. However, intrathoracic metastases can be further divided into different patterns. The objective of our study was to analyze the differences in survival between the different metastatic patterns of intrathoracic metastases in lung adenocarcinoma patients who have epidermal growth factor receptor (EGFR) mutations. Materials and Methods: Patients who were diagnosed only with intrathoracic metastasis between March 2011 and October 2016 and had EGFR-mutations were selected for this study. Prognosis was determined based on metastatic patterns by univariate and multivariate analysis. Results: A total of 137 patients (60 patients who only had pleural metastasis [Group A], 44 patients who only had contralateral lung metastasis [Group B] and 33 patients who had both pleural and contralateral lung metastasis with or without pericardial effusion [Group C]) were selected for this in the study. The median OS (overall survival) time was 38.1 (95%confidence interval [CI]: 27.8-48.4), 35.7(95%CI: 23.4-48.0), and 29.7(95%CI: 22.8-36.6) months for Group A, Group B, and Group C, respectively (p=0.037). Multivariate analysis demonstrated that Group A and Group B had higher OS compared to Group C (hazard ratio [HR]=0.524, 95%CI: 0.307-0.894, p=0.018; HR=0.473, 95%CI: 0.241-0.931, p=0.030, respectively) among lung adenocarcinoma patients with EGFR mutations. With regard to patients with pleural or contralateral metastasis only, OS benefit (p=0.579) was not significant between the two groups. Subgroup analysis demonstrated that OS benefit in Group A was significant in patients with N0-1 disease and 21L858R mutations but not in EGFR exon 19 deletions, N2-3 stage or T3-4 stage patients. Conclusion: The prognosis of EGFR-mutant lung adenocarcinoma patients diagnosed only with intrathoracic metastasis was different, indicating that M1a staging should be refined.",Overexpression of FZD1 is Associated with a Good Prognosis and Resistance of Sunitinib in Clear Cell Renal Cell Carcinoma.,https://www.ncbi.nlm.nih.gov/pubmed/30854133,Journal of Cancer,2019 05 10,"Frizzled class receptor 1 (FZD1), a receptor for Wnt signaling pathway. Overexpression of FZD1 has been detected in many cancer tissues and cells resulting in tumor development and drug resistance. However, its expression status and prognostic merit in renal cancer still remains unclear. We screened the FZD1 mRNA in clear cell renal cell carcinoma (ccRCC) and papillary renal cell carcinoma (pRCC) from TCGA database and Oncomine database. We then detected FZD1 mRNA expression in sunitinib-resistant cells and the corresponding parental cells by qRT-PCR. FZD1 level was significantly upregulated in renal cancer tissues, renal cancer cell lines and their corresponding sunitinib-resistant cells. FZD1 level was also associated with the clinicopathological characteristics of ccRCC patients that could discriminate metastasis, pathological stage, recurrence and prognosis in ccRCC patients. The Kaplan-Meier survival curve and the log-rank test revealed FZD1 was higher in lower clinical stage and grade that correlated with better overall survival (OS) and disease-free survival (DFS) in total and subgroups of ccRCC patients. Both univariate and multivariate cox regression analysis indicated that high FZD1 level was an independent predictor of good prognosis for OS (HR 0.569, P=0.001) and DFS (HR 0.559, P=0.036) in ccRCC patients. Using cBioportal program, less than 1% mutation in the patients with renal cancer was observed, the alterations in FZD1 were correlated with better OS (P=0.0404) in ccRCC patients. Finally, the result of KEGG pathway analysis predicted seven potential pathways that FZD1 and its related genes got involved in ccRCC, including Hippo signaling pathway. This indicated potential therapeutic targets of ccRCC. In conclusion, our results suggested that expression status of FZD1 had a diagnostic value and prognostic value in ccRCC patients, it also may serve as a potential drug target to relieve sunitinib resistance in renal cancer patients.",Cryoablation versus Partial Nephrectomy for Clinical Stage T1 Renal Masses: A Systematic Review and Meta-Analysis.,https://www.ncbi.nlm.nih.gov/pubmed/30854132,Journal of Cancer,2019 05 10,"Introduction: Cryoablation has been considered as the most efficacious ablative alternative to partial nephrectomy (PN) for selected patients. Our objective is to assess the existing evidence relating to the safety and efficacy of cryoablation compared with PN for clinical T1 renal masses. Materials and Methods: A comprehensive search of PMC, EMBASE, and the Cochrane Library was conducted to identify studies containing comparison of cryoablation and PN. By utilizing those included studies, a systematic review and cumulative meta-analyses were performed to assess the safety and efficacy between cryoablation and PN for T1 renal masses. Results: 17 retrospective studies providing available data were included in our study. Significant differences were found about all oncological variables including all-cause death, cancer-specific death, metastasis and local-recurrence (p < 0.001, p = 0.03, p < 0.001, and p < 0.001, respectively) between the PN group and the cryoablation group. The mean difference between two groups for percent estimated glomerular filtration rate decrease and creatinine increase was -4.84 and 0.15 respectively (p < 0.001 and p = 0.006, respectively). The incidences of overall and postoperative complications in the PN group were significantly higher than that in the cryoablation group (p = 0.001 and p < 0.001, respectively), but the result about intraoperative complications didn't show a significant difference between the two groups (p = 0.53). Conclusions: Comparing with PN, cryoablation for clinical T1 renal tumors is associated with poorer oncological outcomes, but the existing disadvantages are accompanied by lower rate of overall and postoperative complications and superior renal functional preservation. For patients with imperative indications for nephron-sparing surgery who can't risk more invasive PN, cryoablation could be an attractive option. Owing to the inherent limitations of eligible studies, conclusions drawn from our meta-analyses should be interpreted cautiously and be confirmed further with well-designed randomized controlled trials with extensive follow-up length."

However, it remains unclear whether NSBP1 is overexpressed and promotes gastric cancer. In this study we employed RNAi mediated knockdown of NSBP1 to investigate potential oncogenic role of NSBP1 in gastric cancer. In BGC823 and SGC7901 gastric cancer cell lines, we showed that NSBP1 knockdown decreased cell proliferation while increased apoptosis in vitro. Western blot analysis showed that NSBP1 knockdown decreased the levels of anti-apoptotic protein Bcl-2 while increased the levels of pro-apoptotic protein Bax. In addition, NSBP1 knockdown inhibited the growth and increased the apoptosis of SGC7901 cells xenografted in nude mice. In conclusion, this study provides the first evidence that NSBP1 enhances the proliferation while inhibits the apoptosis of gastric cancer cells, and this is related to the regulation of the expression of apoptosis related proteins by NSBP1. These data suggest that NSBP1 plays oncogenic role in gastric cancer.",Risk Factors of Lymph Node Metastasis in Patients with Early Pure and Mixed Signet Ring Cell Gastric Carcinomas.,https://www.ncbi.nlm.nih.gov/pubmed/30854120,Journal of Cancer,2019 03 29,"Background: Early gastric carcinoma (EGC) with pure signet ring cell carcinoma (pSRCC) has been reported to have favourable prognosis and low risk of lymph node metastasis (LNM). However, risk factors of LNM and clinicopathological features for early gastric mixed signet ring cell carcinoma (mSRCC) remain poorly investigated. The aim of this study was to identify risk factors of LNM and compare clinicopathological characteristics and prognosis of early gastric pSRCC with mSRCC. Methods: This retrospective study was conducted at our center between 2005 and 2015 in 796 patients underwent radical gastrectomies combined with lymph node dissections, A total of 160 patients with early gastric SRCC underwent gastrectomies with lymph node dissections were reviewed, in which 79 cases were pSRCC and 81 cases were mSRCC. Risk factors of LNM and clinicopathologic features of these two groups were statistically compared, including age, gender, tumor location, gross pattern, size, invasion depth, lymphovascular invasion (LVI), helicobacter pylori (Hp) infection, atrophic gastritis, ulcer finding and LNM. Patients were follow-up for post-resection survival. The 5-year survival and disease-specific survival rate were estimated with the Kaplain-Meier method with a log-rank test and compared between the two groups. Results: Tumor size (P<0.05), invision depth (P<0.05) and LVI (P < 0.0001) were risk factors of LNM, LVI (P < 0.0001) was independent risk factor of LNM in 160 patients. Univariate analysis reviewed LVI (P < 0.0001) as the risk factor in the pSRCC group, and the risk factors of LNM in the mSRCC included LVI (P < 0.0001) and tumor size (P<0.05). Multivariable analysis revealed two independent risk factors in the mSRCC group: 1) tumor size (P < 0.05), and 2) LVI (P < 0.0001). The significant characteristics in two groups included the male gender (P < 0.0001), gross pattern (P < 0.05), LVI (P < 0.01), and Hp infection (P < 0.01). The difference of LNM rate between expanded indication and out of indication in 160 patients was significant (P=0.03). The overall 5-year survival rate for early gastric SRCC was 96.3%. There was no significant difference in the overall survival and disease-specific survival between the two groups. Conclusions: Although with similar post-resection survival, the independent risk factors of LNM in the early mSRCC group, compared to those in the early pSRCC group, included large tumor size and LVI. Early gastric mSRCC had more aggressive clinicopathological features than pSRCC.",Clinical validation of Ki67 by quantitative reverse transcription-polymerase chain reaction (RT-PCR) in HR+/HER2- early breast cancer.,https://www.ncbi.nlm.nih.gov/pubmed/30854118,Journal of Cancer,2019 05 10,"Objective: To evaluate the clinical value of Ki67 by RT-PCR, we investigated the concordance of Ki67 expression by IHC and by RT-PCR, and assessed their prognostic value in HR+/HER2- early breast cancer. Methods: 1259 HR+/HER2- early breast cancer patients treated at Ruijin Hospital with recurrence score were retrospectively recruited. RT-PCR assay measurement of Ki67 was conducted by 21-gene expression assay and compared with IHC measurement of Ki67 using chi-square tests. X-tile program was used to determine the optimal cutoff point for Ki67 by RT-PCR. Survival analyses were performed by Kaplan-Meier analysis and log-rank tests, and hazard ratios were derived from the Cox proportional hazards model. Results: Ki67 by RT-PCR had a weak positive correlation with Ki67 by IHC. Pathology, grade and Ki67 expression by IHC were significantly related to the concordance between two assays, and most discordance cases were seen in patients with Ki67 ranging from 10 to 29. The estimated 3-year DFS was 96.0% in low, and 92.5% in high expression group of Ki67 by IHC, 97.0% in low and 90.4% in high expression group of Ki67 by RT-PCR. Univariate and multivariate analysis in the whole population indicated that only Ki67 by RT-PCR-but not intrinsic subtype or recurrence score-was an independent factor for DFS. Conclusions: Ki67 assessed by RT-PCR assay was weakly correlated to Ki67 by IHC. Using 5.68 as cutoff point, Ki67 by RT-PCR had shown potential as a prognostic biomarker in HR+/HER2- early breast cancer.",Efficacy and Toxicity of IMRT-Based Simultaneous Integrated Boost for the Definitive Management of Positive Lymph Nodes in Patients with Cervical Cancer.,https://www.ncbi.nlm.nih.gov/pubmed/30854117,Journal of Cancer,2019 05 10,"Background: The optimal radiotherapy regimen for treating metastatic lymphadenopathy in patients with locally advanced cervical cancer remains controversial. This study aimed to investigate the clinical outcomes, as well as associated toxicities, of intensity-modulated radiotherapy (IMRT) with a simultaneous integrated boost (SIB) for pelvic and para-aortic lymph nodes (LNs). Methods: Between 2011 and 2015, 74 patients with 2014 International Federation of Gynecology and Obstetrics stage IIB-IVB cervical cancer exhibiting pelvic or para-aortic LN involvement were examined. The pelvic field planning dose was 45-50 Gy in 25 fractions, and an SIB of 62.5 Gy in 25 fractions was delivered to positive LNs. Next, CT-guided brachytherapy was performed 24 Gy in 3 fractions to 42 Gy in 6 fractions once or twice weekly. Results: The median follow-up duration was 36 (range: 3-62) months. The 3-year local control, distant metastasis-free survival, and overall survival rates were 91.7%, 75.7%, and 71.4%, respectively. No residual or recurrent LNs were detected. Six patients developed grade 3 acute gastrointestinal (GI) toxicity. Twenty-nine (39.2%) and 3 (4.1%) patients developed grade 3 and 4 hematological toxicities, respectively. Twenty patients (28.5%) developed grade ≥2 chronic GI toxicity. Only 1 patient (1.4%) experienced a grade 4 rectovaginal fistula, and 3 patients (4.2%) developed grade 2 genitourinary toxicities. SIB to the LNs did not influence acute or chronic toxicity rates. Conclusions: Our findings demonstrate that a dose of 62.5 Gy to positive LNs using the IMRT with SIB method can achieve excellent clinical outcomes with acceptable toxicity.",Neoadjuvant chemotherapy followed by minimally invasive esophagectomy versus primary surgery for management of esophageal carcinoma: a retrospective study.,https://www.ncbi.nlm.nih.gov/pubmed/30854116,Journal of Cancer,2019 05 10,"There is no consensus about the combined therapeutic strategy for esophageal squamous cell carcinoma in China. The quality control and standardization of surgery procedures were far from satisfactory in past neoadjuvant chemotherapy trials, which may underestimate the survival benefits. Therefore, we tried to evaluate the survival benefit of paclitaxel plus platinum followed by minimally invasive esophagectomy with total two-field lymphadenectomy patterns versus primary surgery. Between 06/2011 and 12/2014, there were 279 consecutive patients who underwent minimally invasive esophagectomy with total two-field lymphadenectomy; 83 received neoadjuvant chemotherapy and 196 primary surgery. Propensity score matching was used to compare neoadjuvant chemotherapy patients and 76 matched primary surgery patients. Effectiveness of neoadjuvant chemotherapy, adverse events, complications after the operation, and survival rates were evaluated. After propensity score matching, and compared with primary surgery, neoadjuvant chemotherapy was significantly associated with a better survival (P = 0.049). The overall clinical response rate of neoadjuvant chemotherapy was 77.1%. The pathological response rate was 20.5%. There was no significant difference in complication rates between two groups. Neoadjuvant chemotherapy with paclitaxel plus platinum followed by minimally invasive esophagectomy and total two-field lymphadenectomy have better OS over the primary surgery without serious adverse events.",Association between TNF-ɑ-308G/A polymorphism and esophageal cancer risk: An updated meta-analysis and trial sequential analysis.,https://www.ncbi.nlm.nih.gov/pubmed/30854115,Journal of Cancer,2019 05 10,"Background: TNF-α-308G/A (rs1800629) polymorphism has been previously implicated in the susceptibility to esophageal cancer, but results of these studies remained controversial or ambiguous. A meta-analysis was conducted to provide a more reliable conclusion about the association between TNF-ɑ-308G/A polymorphism and risk of esophageal cancer. Methods: Databases such as PubMed, EMBASE, Web of Science and CNKI were searched for relevant articles published till June 1, 2018. We used the pooled odds ratios (ORs) with 95% confidence intervals (CIs) to evaluate the strength of such associations. Subgroup analysis was carried out according to ethnicity, source of controls and genotyping method. A trial sequential analysis (TSA) was performed to reduce the risk of type I error and evaluate whether the results of our meta-analysis were credible. Results: A total of 9 published case-control studies with 1,435 esophageal cancer patients and 3,762 healthy controls were identified. Overall, our results indicated no significant correlation between TNF-α-308G/A polymorphism and increased risk of esophageal cancer in the fixed-effects model (allele model: pooled OR=1.11, 95% CI: 0.96-1.27, homozygote model: pooled OR=1.23, 95% CI: 0.77-1.95, heterozygote model: pooled OR=1.14, 95% CI: 0.97-1.35, dominant model: pooled OR=1.14, 95% CI: 0.97-1.34 and recessive model: pooled OR=1.00, 95% CI: 0.64-1.56). Subgroup analysis by ethnicity, source of controls and genotyping method showed no significant increase in the risk of esophageal cancer. TSA results need further investigation with a large sample size to certify such association. Conclusions: This meta-analysis study suggested no significant association between TNF-ɑ-308G/A polymorphism and the risk of esophageal cancer.",Annexin A2 Silencing Inhibits Proliferation and Epithelial-to-mesenchymal Transition through p53-Dependent Pathway in NSCLCs.,https://www.ncbi.nlm.nih.gov/pubmed/30854114,Journal of Cancer,2019 05 10,"Annexin A2 has been involved in cancer cell adhesion, invasion and metastasis. However, the exact function and mechanism of Annexin A2 in tumor progression of NSCLCs have not been elucidated. In this study, we showed that Annexin A2 was evidently overexpressed in human NSCLCs cell lines and NSCLCs tissues. Clinicopathologic analysis showed that Annexin A2 expression was significantly correlated with clinical stage, and lymph node metastasis. Kaplan-Meier analysis revealed that patients with high Annexin A2 expression had poorer overall survival rates than those with low Annexin A2 expression. Moreover, we found that knockdown of Annexin A2 significantly suppressed cell proliferation and invasion of NSCLCs cells. Mechanistically, our studies showed that knockdown of Annexin A2 increased the expression of p53, which in turn, induced cell cycle G2 arrest and inhibited epithelial-to-mesenchymal transition (EMT). Taken together, these data suggest that Annexin A2 plays an important role in NSCLCs progression, which could serve as a potential prognosis marker and a novel therapeutic target for NSCLCs.",Effects of perioperative Eicosapentaenoic acid-enriched oral nutritional supplement on lean body mass after total gastrectomy for gastric cancer.,https://www.ncbi.nlm.nih.gov/pubmed/30854113,Journal of Cancer,2019 03 29,"Background: In previous our phase III study to compare perioperative standard diet with or without Eicosapentaenoic acid (EPA)-enriched oral nutritional supplement (EPA-ON), additional EPA-ON did not contribute to prevent body weight loss after total gastrectomy. This report clarified whether EPA-ON could prevent loss of lean body mass (LBM) after total gastrectomy, a key secondary endpoint, in our phase III trial. Methods: This phase III study was designed as multicenter, open-label, superiority, randomized trial to confirm the preventive effect of EPA-ON body weight loss after total gastrectomy for gastric cancer. Eligible patients were randomized to either Standard-diet group or EPA-ON group by a centralized dynamic method. Standard-diet group was given no additional nutritional supplementation perioperatively (standard diet), while EPA-ON group was given an EPA-enriched supplement (ProSure®, Abbott Japan, Tokyo, Japan) in addition to their standard diet. This supplement included 600 kcal with 2.2 g/day of EPA. For both groups, patients underwent total gastrectomy with Roux-en Y reconstruction. Results: A total of 123 patients (Group A: 60, Group B: 63) were analyzed in the study. All background factors were well balanced between the both groups. Median loss of LBM was 6.74% (range -3.91% to 20.27%) in the Standard-diet group and 6.89% (range -5.11% to 20.04%) in the EPA-ON group at 1 month after surgery and was 8.59% (range -4.40% to 20.27%) in the Standard-diet group and 7.77% (range -5.57% to 23.35%) in the EPA-ON group at 3 months after surgery, which was not significantly different at the both (p=0.794 and p=0.393, respectively). Conclusions: The perioperative EPA-ON could not be recommended to prevent loss of LBM after total gastrectomy.","AAV-Mig-6 Increase the Efficacy of TAE in VX2 Rabbit Model, Is Associated With JNK Mediated Autophagy.",https://www.ncbi.nlm.nih.gov/pubmed/30854112,Journal of Cancer,2019 03 29,"The characterization of high recurrence rate of HCC after TAE provides insights into persistent issues surrounding the role of adjunct therapies administered with TAE. As a regulator of the HER family, Mig-6 is down-regulated in HCC and predicts the prognosis of HCC. In this study, we found up-regulation the expression of Mig-6 enhances autophagy in HCC cells. This function of Mig-6 is related to the activation of the JNK pathway. Next AAV-9 encoding Mitogen inducible gene 6 (Mig-6) was delivered into VX2 liver transplant tumor of rabbits by using hepatic artery catheter. Wild-type AAV is not associated with any human or animal disease and has very low immunogenicity. There are over 100 different AAV serotypes that vary in the amino acid sequence of their capsid protein. We also describe a novel combination therapy coupling AAV-Mig-6 and TAE in a rabbit model resulted in a growth rate decrease in tumor compared with TAE alone. Furthermore, we show that the changes of LC3b and p62, as well as the p-JNK were consistent with changes in vitro experiments. These results suggest that Mig-6 efficiently inhibits tumor progression in vivo. Our findings suggest that Mig-6 induced autophagy inhibition may become a necessary target for adjunct therapy in TAE.",Positive impact of the negative lymph node count on the survival rate of stage III colon cancer with pN1 and right-side disease.,https://www.ncbi.nlm.nih.gov/pubmed/30854111,Journal of Cancer,2019 03 29,"Background: We aimed to investigate the role of the negative lymph node count (NLN) as a predictor of prognosis in patients with stage III colon cancer. Methods: We conducted a retrospective study on patients who were diagnosed with stage III colon cancer at Sun Yat-sen University Cancer Center. According to the number of negative lymph nodes, all patients were divided into the low or high NLN group. Overall survival (OS) and disease-free survival (DFS) were assessed using the Kaplan-Meier method and log-rank test between the two groups. Univariate and multivariate Cox proportional hazards models were used to evaluate the risk factors for survival. Results: The time-dependent receiver operating characteristic (ROC) curve showed that the optimal cutoff value of NLN was nine. In total, 167 and 298 patients were distributed into the low and high NLN groups, respectively. Patients in the high NLN group tended to present with a greater proportion of right-side colon cancer and pN1 stage disease, superior DFS (P < 0.001) and OS (P = 0.001) than those in the low NLN group. Multivariable analyses confirmed increased NLN as a positive prognostic variable, independent of other potential confounding factors. Subgroup analysis showed that in patients with a right-side location, those with 9 or fewer negative lymph nodes had a 5-year OS rate of 35.4% versus 77.1% in those with more than 9 negative lymph nodes evaluated (P < 0.001). For patients with stage pN1, those with NLN ≤9 exhibited an inferior 5-year OS rate than those with NLN > 9 (71.1% vs 84.8%, respectively; P = 0.009). There was no association between the number of negative lymph nodes identified and survival for patients with stage pN2 and left-side disease. Conclusion: NLN is an important prognostic factor for stage III colon cancer patients with right-side and stage pN1 disease other than for patients with stage pN2 and left-side disease, which can be partly explained in terms of inflammation and immunity."

They are not only the result of tumor progression but also the cause of cancer initiation. Pyruvate dehydrogenase kinase 4 (PDK4) is a key metabolic enzyme, which regulates cell metabolism by inhibiting pyruvate dehydrogenase (PDH). However, the function and regulating mechanism of PDK4 in HCC remain unclear. Here, we found that the expression of PDK4 was significantly decreased in HCC tissues, and its downregulation could predict poor prognosis of HCC patients. Silencing PDK4 significantly facilitated proliferation and migration of HCC cells. Knockdown of PDK4 didn't influence the oxidative phosphorylation and glycolysis capacity of HCC cells in vitro. However, knockdown of PDK4 increased expression of key lipogenic enzymes, fatty acid synthase (FASN) and stearoyl-CoA desaturase (SCD), which finally induced lipogenesis. These data suggest that PDK4 inhibits proliferation and migration of HCC cells probably via suppressing lipogenesis.",Expression of DEK in pancreatic cancer and its correlation with clinicopathological features and prognosis.,https://www.ncbi.nlm.nih.gov/pubmed/30854097,Journal of Cancer,2019 03 29,"Background: The oncogene DEK, which was originally identified as part of the protein product of the DEK-CAN fusion oncogene, has been shown to promote tumorigenesis in a variety of cancer cell types. However, little is known about the expression and role of DEK in pancreatic ductal adenocarcinoma (PDAC), which is one of the most refractory malignant tumors worldwide and has poor prognosis. Our study aimed to understand the role of DEK in the development and progression of pancreatic adenocarcinoma. Materials and methods: We used western blotting and immunohistochemistry to examine the expression of DEK in pancreatic adenocarcinoma cells and tissues. We analyzed the correlation between DEK expression and clinicopathological characteristics and prognosis in 163 pancreatic adenocarcinoma patients. Results: Protein levels of DEK in pancreatic adenocarcinoma tissues (76/136, 55.9%) were significantly higher than those in adjacent non-tumor tissues (16.2%, 22/136). A high expression level of DEK was associated with poor prognosis (P<0.001).In addition, the combination of CA19-9 and DEK expression (P<0.001) was a better prognostic indicator than CA19-9 expression alone (P=0.012). Conclusions: DEK may play a significant role as a valuable biomarker in the development and progression of pancreatic adenocarcinoma. The combination of DEK and CA19-9 improves the prognostic prediction in patients with pancreatic adenocarcinoma.",Regulatory sequence analysis of semaphorin 4D 5' non-coding region.,https://www.ncbi.nlm.nih.gov/pubmed/30854096,Journal of Cancer,2019 03 29,"Semaphorin 4D (Sema4D) has been proven to be one of the hypoxia effectors regulated by hypoxia inducible factor (HIF-1) in multiple cells, and play a role in angiogenesis like VEGF. However, the regulatory sequence characteristics of the Sema4D are not clarified. The possible hypoxia response element (HRE) sequences in 5' non-coding Region before ATG start codon of Sema4D were screened, followed by point mutagenesis and luciferase assay analysis. Sequencing and alignment of this region in 11 cancer cell lines and 4 normal cell lines were also performed, followed by cloning, mutation and luciferase assay analysis. The results showed that there were four possible HREs (HRE1-4) sequences in 1275bp range before ATG start codon. Among HRE1-4, HRE2 and HRE4 were functional HIF-1α binding sites. In addition, these two binding sites play different roles in the regulation of Sema4D expression in HUVEC and Caco-2 cells. There were three nucleotide variants (T471C/A600G/C862T) frequently detected in cancer cell lines. The site variation rates of T471C/A600G/C862T were 72.7%, 18.2%, and 72.7% in cancer cells respectively. Luciferase assays showed that T471C and C862T could significantly increase the expression efficiency of downstream target genes. Furthermore, secondary structure prediction showed that mutations at T471C and C862T apparently lead to change of the gene structure. Our study describes the sequence characteristics of 5' non-coding region of Sema4D, enhances our understanding of the regulatory mechanism of Sema4D and benefits the development of a possible anti-angiogenesis therapeutic strategy for malignancies.",A network-based approach to identify DNA methylation and its involved molecular pathways in testicular germ cell tumors.,https://www.ncbi.nlm.nih.gov/pubmed/30854095,Journal of Cancer,2019 03 29,"Background: Testicular germ cell tumors (TGCT) is the most common testicular malignancy threaten young male reproductive health. This study aimed to identify aberrantly methylated-differentially expressed genes and pathways in TGCT by comprehensive bioinformatics analysis. Methods: Data of gene expression microarrays (GSE3218, GSE18155) and gene methylation microarrays (GSE72444) were collected from GEO database. Integrated analysis acquired aberrantly methylated-genes. Functional and pathway enrichment analysis were performed using DAVID database. Protein-protein interaction (PPI) network was constructed by STRING and App Mcode was used for module analysis. GEPIA platform and DiseaseMeth database were used for confirming the expression and methylation levels of hub genes. Finally, Human Protein Atlas database was performed to evaluate the prognostic significance. Results: Totally 604 hypomethylation-high expression and 147 hypermethylation-low genes were identified. The high expressed genes were enriched in biological processes of cell proliferation and migration. The top 8 hub genes of PPI network were GAPDH, VEGFA, PTPRC, RIPK4, MMP9, CSF1R, KRAS and FN1. After validation in GEPIA platform, all hub genes were elevated in TGCT tissues. Only MMP9, CSF1R and PTPRC showed hypomethylation-high expression status, which predicted the poor outcome of TGCT patients. Conclusion: Our study indicated possible aberrantly methylated-differentially expressed genes and pathways in TGCT by bioinformatics analysis, which may provide novel insights for unraveling pathogenesis of TGCT.",The Impact of Afatinib on Survival in Advanced Non-Small Cell Lung Cancer: A Meta-Analysis of Randomized Controlled Trials.,https://www.ncbi.nlm.nih.gov/pubmed/30854094,Journal of Cancer,2019 03 29,"Background: Afatinib is a second-generation epidermal growth factor receptor-tyrosine kinase inhibitor (EGFR-TKI) that has been approved by the Food and Drug Administration for the treatment of advanced non-small cell lung cancer (NSCLC) harboring EGFR mutations. We performed a meta-analysis to assess the efficacy and safety of afatinib in advanced NSCLC. Methods: We searched PubMed, PMC database, EMBASE, Cochrane Library and Web of Science to obtain the relevant literature. The efficacy and safety of afatinib was assessed based on progression-free survival (PFS), overall survival (OS), overall response rate (ORR), primary grade 3/4 adverse events and fatal adverse events (FAEs). A subgroup analysis was performed according to control type for all end-points. Results: Seven randomized controlled trials were included, with a total of 3093 patients. The meta-analysis showed that afatinib treatment significantly prolonged PFS in patients compared with control groups (HR = 0.57, 95% CI: 0.42-0.76; P = 0.00), increased OS (HR = 0.91, 95% CI: 0.83-0.99; P = 0.04) and ORR (RR = 1.82, 95% CI: 1.13-2.93; P = 0.01). In terms of safety, afatinib significantly increased the incidence of diarrhea (RR = 8.9, 95% CI: 5.33-14.93; P = 0.00), rash (RR = 7.31, 95% CI: 1.56-34.12; P = 0.01) and stomatitis (RR = 6.45, 95% CI: 1.27-32.78; P = 0.03), compared with the control group. However, there was no significant difference in FAEs (RR = 0.75, 95% CI: 0.38-1.49; P = 0.41). Conclusions: This meta-analysis confirmed that afatinib extended survival, improved response rates and did not increase the risk of treatment-related mortality in advanced NSCLC. As a novel EGFR-TKI, afitinib has significant potential for clinical application.",MYH9 Promotes Growth and Metastasis via Activation of MAPK/AKT Signaling in Colorectal Cancer.,https://www.ncbi.nlm.nih.gov/pubmed/30854093,Journal of Cancer,2019 06 10,"The contractile protein MYH9 (non-muscle myosin IIA) is an actin-binding protein that plays a fundamental role in cell adhesion, migration, and division. However, its distinct role in colorectal cancer (CRC) still remains unidentified. In this study, we detected significant MYH9 overexpression in CRC samples compared with paired normal tissues using western blotting and tissue microarray immunohistochemistry (IHC). Moreover, analysis of patient clinical information demonstrated that MYH9 overexpression was strongly correlated with lymph node metastasis and poor overall survival. Endogenous overexpression of MYH9 enhanced the ability of cell proliferation and migration in vitro, and accelerated CRC growth in mouse models. Silencing of MYH9 revealed repressive effects on CRC cells in vitro and in vivo. Furthermore, primary biomechanics that involved MAPK/AKT signaling mediated epithelial-mesenchymal transition (EMT) was uncovered underlying MYH9 dependent cell behaviors. Collectively, our data showed that MYH9 significantly promoted tumorigenesis by regulating MAPK/AKT signaling, and was remarkably correlated with poor prognosis in CRC. MYH9 may thus be a novel biomarker and drug target in the diagnosis and treatment of CRC.",Cadherin Related Family Member 2 Acts As A Tumor Suppressor By Inactivating AKT In Human Hepatocellular Carcinoma.,https://www.ncbi.nlm.nih.gov/pubmed/30854092,Journal of Cancer,2019 03 29,"Cadherin related family member 2 (CDHR2) belongs to the protocadherin family and is abundant in normal liver, kidney, and colon tissues, but weakly expressed in cancers arising from these tissues. In this study, we demonstrated that CDHR2 was highly expressed in para-cancer tissues of human hepatocellular carcinoma (HCC), but significantly downregulated or silenced in 85.7% (6/7) of HCC cell lines by both semi-quantitative PCR and western blot, and 79.1% (19/24) and 80.2% (89/111) of tumor tissues from patients with HCC by semi-quantitative PCR, and immunohistochemistry, respectively. Interestingly, CpG islands in the promoter of CDHR2 gene were hypermethylated in HCC cell lines and tissues compared with the para-cancer tissues by methylation-specific PCR analysis, leading to transcriptional repression and silencing of CDHR2 in HCC. In addition, CDHR2 overexpression by lentiviral vectors had suppressive effects on HCC cell growth and proliferation, as evidenced by prolonged cell doubling time and reduced colony-forming ability in vitro, as well as by decreased tumorigenicity in vivo. Mechanistically, CDHR2 overexpression resulted in AKT dephosphorylation along with downregulation of cyclooxygenase-2 (COX2), a downstream target of AKT. This effect was reversed by myristoylated AKT, a constitutively active form of AKT, suggesting an involvement of CDHR2-AKT-COX2 axis in the suppression of HCC growth. Taken together, our study identified CDHR2 as a novel tumor suppressor in HCC and provided a new therapeutic target for HCC.",Comprehensive Analysis of Aberrantly Expressed ceRNA network in gastric cancer with and without H.pylori infection.,https://www.ncbi.nlm.nih.gov/pubmed/30854091,Journal of Cancer,2019 03 29,"Objective: This study mainly focused on revealing ceRNA network in gastric cancer (GC) with Hp infection after comparing with GC without Hp infection and exploring the biological function and prognostic relevance of related molecules. Methods: The RNA expression profile data of GC patients with or without Hp infection were extracted from TCGA GDC data portal, including 20 GC cases with Hp infection and 168 GC cases without Hp infection. Differentially expressed lncRNAs, miRNAs and mRNAs were unveiled by package edgeR of R, and lncRNA-miRNA-mRNA ceRNA network was constructed by integrating the miRNA target information and the expression data of lncRNAs, miRNAs and mRNAs. Gene Ontology (GO) and Kyoto Encyclopedia of Genes and Genomes (KEGG) pathway analyses of aberrantly expressed mRNAs were performed to identify the related biological functions and pathologic pathways, and protein-protein interaction (PPI) network was constructed by STRING database. The overall survival (OS) of aberrantly expression lncRNAs and miRNAs were analyzed by package survival of R. A total of 30 gastric cancer tissues were used to validate the bioinformatics analysis results by real-time PCR. Results: Among the 32 differentially expressed miRNAs, 27 differentially expressed lncRNAs and 257 differentially expressed mRNAs were identified by comparing GC patients with and without Hp infection. Totally 10 miRNA, 11 lncRNA, 219 mRNA were included to build ceRNA network. GO and KEGG analysis revealed that differentially expressed mRNAs involved in the ceRNA network were mainly involved in extracellular exosomes, structural molecular activities, proteolysis and P13K-Akt signaling pathways. And PPI analysis obtained six hub genes of NTS, APOC3, OTX2, KRT13, CALCA, GNG4. Survival analysis showed that four lncRNAs (LINC01254, LINC01287, LINC01524, U95743.1) and four miRNAs (miR-302a, miR-302b, miR-1286, miR-378g) were associated with overall survival of GC with Hp infection. The real-time PCR results showed that, the levels of LINCO1254, LINCO1287, LINCO1524, U95743.1 were significantly higher in Hp positive GC patients than Hp negative patients (P=0.02, 0.048, 0.04, 0.036, respectively). Conclusion: Using TCGA database for data mining, we have successfully constructed a ceRNA regulatory network of GC with Hp infection, consisting of 10 lncRNAs, 11 miRNAs and 219 mRNAs. These findings might provide critical clues for the regulatory role of ceRNA network in the development of GC with Hp infection.",Tripartite motif-containing 15 overexpression in non-small cell lung cancer is associated with poor patient prognoses.,https://www.ncbi.nlm.nih.gov/pubmed/30854090,Journal of Cancer,2019 03 29,"Purpose: This study aimed to comprehensively investigate the differential expression and prognostic indicators of the tripartite motif-containing (TRIM) gene family in non-small cell lung cancer (NSCLC). Methods: The Cancer Genome Atlas (TCGA) Research Network and three datasets from Gene Expression Omnibus (GEO) database were used to assess TRIM gene family expression patterns in NSCLC. Quantitative real-time PCR and immunohistochemistry (IHC) were conducted to confirm differentially expressed genes (DEGs). Kaplan-Meier survival analysis and univariate Cox regression analysis were carried out to analyze the association between TRIM gene expression and NSCLC prognoses. Gene set enrichment analysis (GSEA) was carried on for the predict the biological processes. Results: Of the 78 TRIM family members measured, TRIM15 was selected due to the DEGs and the prognostic value regarding NSCLC. In lung squamous cell carcinoma (LUSC), the Log2 fold change (Log2FC) of TRIM15 was 5.16 (p= 0.00575), whereas in lung adenocarcinoma (LUAD), it was 6.37 (p =6.78E-07). TRIM15 upregulation was related to poor prognoses in both LUSC (HR 1.353; 95%CI 1.023-1.789; p =0.034) and LUAD (HR 1.560; 95%CI 1.159-2.101; p =0.003). Using immunohistochemistry, TRIM15 expression was significantly higher in NSCLC tissues compared with that of matched normal tissues (p =0.0009), and similar findings were generated with tissue microarray analysis (p<0.0001). Conclusion: TRIM15 could act as a diagnostic predictor or therapeutic target for lung cancer treatments.",Prognostic value of preoperative hyponatremia in patients with epithelial ovarian cancer.,https://www.ncbi.nlm.nih.gov/pubmed/30854089,Journal of Cancer,2019 03 29,"Hyponatremia is an emerging issue in cancer patients. However, few studies have explored the prognostic value of preoperative hyponatremia in epithelial ovarian cancer (EOC) patients. We conducted a retrospective study of women diagnosed with EOC at Shengjing Hospital from 2011 to 2015. Preoperative serum sodium levels were measured and classified as normal (136-145 mmol/L) or hyponatremic (≤135 mmol/L) according to the average/most recent measurements of this biomarker. Multivariable Cox proportional hazard regression models were applied to determine the adjusted hazard ratios (HRs) with 95% confidence intervals (CIs) for the association of preoperative hyponatremia with progression-free survival (PFS) and overall survival (OS). We identified 607 EOC patients meeting the inclusion criteria with a median age of 51 years (inter-quartile range: 47-59 years). The median follow-up duration was 3.1 years (inter-quartile range: 2.2-4.2). The recurrence and mortality rates were 56.8% (345/607) and 38.4% (233/607), respectively. Among the patients, 81 (13.3%) were observed as hyponatremic. Preoperative hyponatremia was associated with poorer PFS (HR=1.51; 95%CI=1.07-2.15) as well as OS (HR=1.47; 95%CI=1.03-2.11) after adjusting for potential confounders. Notably, results were in line with the main findings only when using the most recent serum sodium levels before treatment, with corresponding HRs of 1.58 (95%CI=1.12-2.23) for PFS and 1.45 (95%CI=1.02-2.07) for OS. Preoperative hyponatremia is an independent prognostic factor of EOC. Further studies are warranted to confirm our findings as well as to determine whether correction of preoperative hyponatremia may alter clinical outcomes in these patients."

However, the functional role of LIMD1 in non-Hodgkin's lymphoma (NHL) remains unclear. In the present study, it was demonstrated that LIMD1 is associated with the proliferation of NHL and cell adhesion mediated-drug resistance (CAM-DR). It was indicated by western blot analysis that LIMD1expression is lower in progressive lymphoma compared with indolent lymphoma. Furthermore, it was indicated that the role of LIMD1 in cell viability and proliferation remains unclear. Finally, the present study demonstrated that LIMD1 serves an important role in CAM-DR by regulating cell cycle progression. Silencing of LIMD1 may reverse CAM-DR in NHL. Therefore, the findings of the present study suggested that LIMD1 may be a potential therapeutic target for patients with NHL.",miR-544 inhibits the migration and invasion of anaplastic thyroid cancer by targeting Yin Yang-1.,https://www.ncbi.nlm.nih.gov/pubmed/30854076,Oncology letters,2019 03 29,"Anaplastic thyroid cancer (ATC), with a mean survival time of 6 months, was reported in 2012 to account for 1-2% of all thyroid tumor cases in the US. Understanding the molecular mechanisms underlying carcinogenesis and progression in ATC would contribute to determining novel therapeutic targets. The aberrant expression of microRNA-544 (miR-544) has been demonstrated in various cancer types. However, its expression and biological function in human ATC remain largely unknown. Therefore, the present study investigated the expression, function and molecular mechanism of miR-544 in ATC. Results of reverse transcription-quantitative polymerase chain reaction demonstrated that the expression levels of miR-544 in 40 pairs of surgical specimens and human ATC cell lines were significantly decreased, compared with the normal thyroid tissues and cell line. Functional assays indicated that ectopic expression of miR-544 significantly decreased the viability, proliferation and metastasis of SW1736 cells, whereas miR-544 inhibitor significantly enhanced the viability, proliferation and metastasis of 8305C cells. Furthermore, the present study confirmed that the oncogene Yin Yang-1 (YY1) was a direct target of miR-544. It was further demonstrated that YY1 overexpression rescued the inhibitory effect of progression induced by miR-544 in ATC cells. Finally, in vivo study indicated that miR-544 suppressed the tumorigenicity of ATC cells. In conclusion, the present study demonstrated that miR-544 may function as a tumor suppressor in ATC and serve as a future therapeutic target for patients with ATC.",UNBS5162 inhibits SKOV3 ovarian cancer cell proliferation by regulating the PI3K/AKT signalling pathway.,https://www.ncbi.nlm.nih.gov/pubmed/30854075,Oncology letters,2019 03 29,"Ovarian cancer is the gynaecological malignancy with the highest mortality rate worldwide, and effective and safe therapeutic methods are limited. UNBS5162, a derivative of naphthalimide, has a clear inhibitory effect on the proliferation of various tumour cells in vitro and in vivo as a pan-antagonist of CXC chemokine ligand expression, but whether it serves a function in ovarian cancer remains unclear. The aim of the present study was to determine the effects of UNBS5162 on the proliferation, migration and invasion of ovarian cancer cells. The cell viability was detected using a Cell Counting Kit-8 (CCK-8) assay. The invasion and migration of SKOV3 cells were determined using Transwell assays. Cell apoptosis was determined using flow cytometry. The apoptosis-associated proteins and associated factors, such as phosphoinositide 3-kinase (PI3K)/protein kinase B (AKT) signalling pathway members, were detected using western blot analysis. The CCK-8 assay revealed that SKOV3 cell viability was affected by UNBS5162 in a dose- and time-dependent manner. In Transwell assays, UNBS5162 inhibited cell invasion and migration. Furthermore, it was identified that UNBS5162 markedly increased the apoptosis rate of SKOV3 cells. Simultaneously, the expression of the anti-apoptotic protein B-cell lymphoma 2 (Bcl-2) was decreased and the expression of the pro-apoptotic proteins active caspase-3 and Bcl-2-associated X protein were increased in SKOV3 cells treated with UNBS5162. In addition, the expression levels of phospho (p-)AKT/total AKT, p-mammalian target of rapamycin (mTOR)/total mTOR, p-p70 S6 kinase (p70S6K)/total p70S6K and cyclin D1 were decreased in the UNBS5162-treated group. The results of the present study indicated that UNBS5162 inhibits proliferation, migration and invasion, and induces apoptosis in ovarian cancer cells, which may be regulated by the PI3K/AKT signalling pathway. These results suggest that UNBS5162 may be a potential novel drug for clinical ovarian cancer treatment.",Survival analysis with regard to PD-L1 and CD155 expression in human small cell lung cancer and a comparison with associated receptors.,https://www.ncbi.nlm.nih.gov/pubmed/30854074,Oncology letters,2019 03 29,"Immune checkpoints expressed on tumor cells may suppress the cytotoxicity of tumor-infiltrating lymphocytes (TILs) via interaction with their ligands. In the present study, checkpoint proteins and ligands, including programmed death-1 (PD-1), programmed death ligand-1 (PD-L1), cluster of differentiation (CD)155 and T cell immunoreceptor with immunoglobulin and ITIM domains (TIGIT) were systematically analyzed in patients with small cell lung cancer (SCLC). Furthermore their clinicopathological features and survival rates were investigated. Immunohistochemistry was performed in order to analyze the expression of PD-L1, CD155, PD-1 and TIGIT in 60 patients with SCLC, and survival analyses were performed using the Kaplan-Meier method and Cox proportional hazards model. It was reported that CD155/TIGIT and PD-L1/PD-1 were highly expressed on tissues of surgically resected SCLC. High expression levels of PD-L1, CD155 or PD-L1+CD155 were significantly associated with shorter survival. However, high expression levels of PD-1 or TIGIT exhibited no obvious association with shorter survival time. Moreover, patients with SCLC in whom PD-L1 and CD155 levels were highly expressed had the shortest survival rate. Multivariate survival analysis revealed that highly expressed PD-L1 [hazard ratio (HR)=2.55, 95% confidence interval (CI)=1.18-5.51, P=0.017] and CD155 (HR=2.40, 95% CI=1.05-5.50, P=0.038) were independent prognostic factors for overall survival (OS) time in SCLC. In addition, it was reported that TIGIT and PD-1, the receptors of CD155 and PD-L1, respectively, were also constitutively expressed on CD8+ TILs and tumor cells in SCLC.

Numerous stilbenes isolated from R. undulatum have been revealed to possess anticancer effects. The aim of the present study was to evaluate the effect of extracts and compounds isolated from R. undulatum on human gastric cancer cell viability and to elucidate their molecular mechanism of action on the apoptosis pathway. The results demonstrated that aloe-emodin and chrysophanol 1-O-β-D-glucopyranoside, isolated from the methanolic extract of dried rhizomes of R. undulatum, exhibited anti-proliferative effects on the human gastric carcinoma cell line AGS, with IC50 values of 84.66±0.44 and 68.28±0.29 µM, respectively. The percentage of apoptotic cells increased significantly following treatment with each compound at a concentration of 100 µM, compared with that in the non-treated group in the image-based cytometry assay. Western blot analysis revealed that these compounds activated the caspase cascade and inhibited B-cell lymphoma-2, an anti-apoptotic protein.",Impact of prior antibiotic use on the efficacy of nivolumab for non-small cell lung cancer.,https://www.ncbi.nlm.nih.gov/pubmed/30854072,Oncology letters,2019 03 29,"Gut microbiota serves an important role in shaping systemic immune responses. Antibiotics cause changes in the gut microbiota that may influence the efficacy of cancer immunotherapy. In the present study, a retrospective analysis of the data from 90 patients treated with nivolumab for non-small cell lung cancer (NSCLC) was conducted. A total of 13 patients were treated with antibiotics prior to nivolumab therapy. The median progression-free survival time in patients treated with antibiotics was 1.2 months [95% confidence interval (CI), 0.5-5.8], while the time for patients who were not treated with antibiotics was 4.4 months (95% CI, 2.5-7.4). The median overall survival time in patients treated with antibiotics was 8.8 months, while it was not reached in those not treated with antibiotics, respectively. The differences between the survival curves with regard to PFS and OS were statistically significant (P=0.04 and P=0.037, respectively). However, in multivariate analysis, no statistically significant association was indicated between survival and prior antibiotic use, although a certain trend concerning the negative influence of antibiotic use was conveyed.",Knockdown of high mobility group box 3 impairs cell viability and colony formation but increases apoptosis in A549 human non-small cell lung cancer cells.,https://www.ncbi.nlm.nih.gov/pubmed/30854071,Oncology letters,2019 03 29,"Previous research has linked high mobility group box 3 (HMGB3) overexpression to the malignant progression and poor prognosis of non-small cell lung cancer (NSCLC). The present study investigated the role of HMGB3 in cell survival and colony formation of NSCLC cells. Stable knockdown of HMGB3 in A549 cells was achieved by lentiviral-based shRNA interference and verified by detection of the transcriptional and translational level of HMGB3 with reverse transcription-quantitative polymerase chain reaction and western blotting, respectively. The influence of HMGB3 knockdown on A549 cell viability and apoptotic rate was evaluated by Cell Counting Kit-8 assay and flow cytometry following annexin V staining, respectively. The proliferative capacity of A549 cells with or without HMGB3 knockdown was compared by measuring their colony forming efficiency. The results of the current study revealed that HMGB3 knockdown significantly reduced cell viability and colony forming efficiency while promoting apoptosis in A549 cells, indicating that HMGB3 may be pivotal for the survival and colony formation of A549 cells, serving a notable role in NSCLC progression.",MicroRNA-20b promotes proliferation of H22 hepatocellular carcinoma cells by targeting PTEN.,https://www.ncbi.nlm.nih.gov/pubmed/30854070,Oncology letters,2019 03 29,"MicroRNAs (miRNAs/miRs) are small, noncoding RNA molecules that are closely associated with the occurrence and development of tumors. miR-20b is overexpressed in hepatocellular carcinoma cell lines and tissues. However, it is not clear whether miR-20b can promote the proliferation of hepatocellular carcinoma cells. In the present study, the proliferation of H22 mouse hepatocellular carcinoma cells was detected using the Cell Counting Kit-8 assay. MiRanda software was used to predict the binding sites of miR-20b to the 3'-untranslated region (3'-UTR) of phosphatase and tensin homolog (PTEN). The 3'-UTR sequence of the PTEN gene was amplified using the polymerase chain reaction in H22 cells. The recombinant plasmid or empty plasmid was co-transfected with miR-20b mimics or miR-20b scramble into HeLa cells, and luciferase activity was assessed by Dual-Luciferase® Reporter Assay System 24 h post-transfection. In the present study, miR-20b knockdown significantly inhibited the proliferation of H22 mouse hepatocellular carcinoma cells. In addition, miR-20b inhibition upregulated the expression of PTEN, and it was revealed that miR-20b may directly target the 3'-untranslated region of the PTEN gene. Downregulation of PTEN partially reversed the anti-proliferative effect of miR-20b on H22 cells. In conclusion, miR-20b may promote H22 cell proliferation by targeting PTEN, providing a rationale for further study investigating novel therapeutic strategies for liver cancer.","Long non-coding RNA-OIS1 inhibits HPV-positive, but not HPV-negative cervical squamous cell carcinoma by upregulating MTK-1.",https://www.ncbi.nlm.nih.gov/pubmed/30854069,Oncology letters,2019 03 29,"Long non-coding RNA-oncogene-induced senescence 1 (lncRNA-OIS1) is a novel lncRNA that is involved in oncogene-induced senescence, while its functionality in cervical squamous cell carcinoma is unknown. In the present study, 68 human papillomavirus (HPV)-positive and 22 HPV-negative patients with cervical squamous cell carcinoma were recruited. Additionally, 40 healthy females were employed as healthy controls. Tumor tissues and adjacent healthy tissues were collected from all patients with cervical squamous cell carcinoma, and blood samples were obtained. Expression of OIS1 was detected by reverse transcription-quantitative polymerase chain reaction. Receiver operating characteristic curve analysis was used to evaluate the diagnostic value of OIS1 for cervical squamous cell carcinoma. HPV-positive and HPV-negative cervical squamous cell carcinoma and normal cervical cell lines were used, and the effects of OIS1 or mitogen-activated protein kinase kinase kinase 4, (MTK-1) expression vector transfection on the proliferation of cell lines and MTK-1 expression were detected by CCK-8 assay and western blotting, respectively. It was established that a reduction in OIS1 expression level in tumor tissues was apparent only in HPV-positive patients. Serum levels of OIS1 were lower in HPV-positive patients compared with that in HPV-negative patients and healthy controls, and no significant differences were observed between HPV-negative patients and healthy controls. Serum levels of OIS1 were significantly associated with tumor size, but not distant tumor metastasis. OIS1 expression level was lower in HPV-positive cancer cell lines compared with that in HPV-negative cancer cell lines, while no significant differences were observed between HPV-positive and HPV-negative normal cell lines. OIS1 overexpression inhibited and MTK-1 overexpression promoted the proliferation of HPV-positive, but not HPV-negative cancer or normal cell lines. OIS1 transfection also decreased the expression of MTK-1 in HPV-positive cancer cell lines, but not in any of the other cell lines. Therefore, it was concluded that OIS1 inhibited HPV-positive, but not HPV-negative cervical squamous cell carcinoma by upregulating MTK-1.","Analysis of clinicopathological characteristics, MYB rearrangement and prognostic factors in salivary adenoid cystic carcinoma.",https://www.ncbi.nlm.nih.gov/pubmed/30854068,Oncology letters,2019 03 29,"Recent studies have indicated that a recurrent t(6;9)(q22-23;p23-24) chromosomal translocation in salivary adenoid cystic carcinoma (ACC) results in a MYB proto-oncogene transcription factor-nuclear factor I/B (MYB-NFIB) gene fusion, which has not previously been detected in any non-ACC carcinomas of the head and neck. In the present study, data on clinical factors affecting the survival rate of patients with salivary ACC from a single institution was retrospectively analyzed, and the frequency of MYB gene rearrangement determined. A total of 97 patient cases were analyzed, and young adults presenting with ACC (<40 years old) accounted for 19.6% of all patients (n=19). A total of 70.1% (n=68) displayed neurological symptoms, including pain, paraesthesia, tongue deviation, and facial paralysis. A marked majority of the analyzed tumors (85.6%) displayed evidence of MYB rearrangement. MYB rearrangement was significantly higher in patients with late Tumor-Node-Metastasis (TNM) stage cancer compared with that in patients with early TNM stage (P=0.033), as detected by a dual color MYB break-apart fluorescence in situ hybridization probe. Kaplan-Meier analysis revealed significant differences in patient overall survival (OS) time with regard to age, gender, TNM stage, neurological symptoms, margin status and MYB rearrangement. Specifically, young age was significantly associated with a shorter OS time. In summary, the present study suggested that young patients with salivary ACC presented with a worse prognosis, in contrast to the majority of patients with salivary ACC. Moreover, MYB alterations exhibited a high positive rate in salivary ACC, and therefore, the absence of MYB rearrangements may be associated with a better prognosis."

Although BRAF inhibitors have a marked effect on malignant melanoma harboring the BRAFV600E mutation, they have a limited effect on patients with CRC with the same BRAF mutation. A previous study identified a novel gene, monopolar spindle protein kinase 1 (Mps1), a downstream target of BRAFV600E only, rather than of wild-type BRAF as well, which contributes to tumorigenesis in melanoma. In the present study, the incidence of BRAFV600E in patients with CRC was identified and the correlation of Mps1, phospho-extracellular-signal-regulated kinase (p-ERK) and BRAFV600E was investigated. The results indicated that the mutation rate of BRAFV600E was 5.2% in CRC. Poorly differentiated tumors and mucinous tumors have a significantly higher incidence of BRAFV600E compared with well-differentiated tumors and non-mucinous tumors (P<0.05). Kaplan-Meier survival analysis indicated that the survival rate was markedly lower in patients with BRAFV600E compared with in patients with wild-type BRAF (BRAFWT). The expression of p-ERK and Mps1 in CRC with BRAFV600E was significantly higher compared with in CRC with BRAFWT (P<0.05), and their expression is associated with cancer classification, degree of differentiation and lymph node transfusion (P<0.05). In addition p-ERK expression was positively correlated with Mps1 expression, with a contingency coefficient of 0.679 (P=0.002). In conclusion, the results of the present study indicated that Mps1 was significantly associated with BRAFV600E/p-ERK and may serve a crucial function in the development of CRC. The results of the present study raise the possibility that targeting the oncogenic BRAF and Mps1, particularly when in conjunction, could provide promising therapeutic opportunities for the treatment of CRC.",FLOT2 overexpression is associated with the progression and prognosis of human colorectal cancer.,https://www.ncbi.nlm.nih.gov/pubmed/30854055,Oncology letters,2019 03 29,"Altered expression of flotillin-2 (FLOT2) has been identified in certain types of cancer, including breast cancer and melanoma; however, to the best of our knowledge, the association between the FLOT2 expression level and colorectal cancer (CRC) remains to be determined. The aim of the present study was to investigate the clinical and prognostic significance of FLOT2 in CRC. The expression of FLOT2 was determined in seven CRC cell lines and one normal colon cell line, and it was identified that FLOT2 was increased in CRC cell lines, suggesting that FLOT2 exhibited an association with CRCs. In addition, FLOT2 protein levels were investigated in primary CRC tissues and corresponding non-cancerous colon tissues from 8 patients. Compared with non-cancerous tissues, FLOT2 protein was apparently upregulated in CRC tissues. To validate this result, an immunohistochemistry assay was performed and it was identified that FLOT2 levels were increased in CRC tissues. Clinical analysis identified that increased expression of FLOT2 was associated with the depth of invasion, lymph node metastasis, distant metastasis and American Joint Committee on Cancer stage of CRCs. Furthermore, multivariate analysis using the Cox regression model indicated that increased FLOT2 expression was an independent prognostic factor in patients with CRC (P=0.013). Taken together, the results of the present study suggest that overexpression of FLOT2 contributes to the progression of CRC and indicate that FLOT2 is a novel target for the treatment of CRC.",Long non-coding RNA-NEF targets glucose transportation to inhibit the proliferation of non-small-cell lung cancer cells.,https://www.ncbi.nlm.nih.gov/pubmed/30854054,Oncology letters,2019 03 29,"Long non-coding RNA (lncRNA)-NEF is a newly discovered lncRNA, which exhibits an inhibitory function on the metastasis of hepatocellular carcinoma, while its involvement in other types of malignancy are unknown. In the present study, tumor and adjacent healthy tissues were obtained from patients with non-small-cell lung cancer (NSCLC), and blood was obtained from patients with NSCLC and healthy individuals. Expression levels of lncRNA-NEF in tumor tissue samples, healthy tissue samples and serum were detected by reverse transcription-quantitative polymerase chain reaction (RT-qPCR). Receiver operating characteristic curve analysis and survival curve analysis were performed to evaluate the diagnostic and prognostic value of serum lncRNA-NEF for NSCLC. The effects of lncRNA-NEF overexpression in NSCLC cell lines on tumor cell proliferation, glucose uptake, glucose transporter 1 (GLUT1) protein expression and mRNA expression were investigated by Cell Counting kit-8 assay, glucose uptake assay, western blot analysis and RT-qPCR, respectively. It was identified that lncRNA-NEF was downregulated in NSCLC tissues, compared with healthy controls, and the serum level of lncRNA-NEF was negatively associated with primary tumor stage. Therefore, serum lncRNA-NEF may be a sensitive diagnostic and prognostic marker for NSCLC. Overexpression of lncRNA-NEF inhibited NSCLC cell proliferation and glucose uptake, and downregulated GLUT1 expression. Therefore, it can be concluded that lncRNA-NEF can target glucose transportation to inhibit the proliferation of NSCLC cells.",Correlation of OPN gene expression with proliferation and apoptosis of ovarian cancer cells and prognosis of patients.,https://www.ncbi.nlm.nih.gov/pubmed/30854053,Oncology letters,2019 03 29,"Correlation of osteopontin (OPN) gene expression with proliferation and apoptosis of ovarian cancer cells and prognosis of patients was investigated. The expression levels of OPN in 81 pairs of ovarian cancer tissues and para-carcinoma tissues obtained via surgical resection were detected using immunohistochemistry (IHC). The correlation of OPN protein expression with clinicopathological features of patients was analyzed. All patients were followed up for 3 years. The disease-free survival (DFS) and overall survival (OS) curves of patients in high/low OPN expression groups were drawn using the Kaplan-Meier method. The expression levels of OPN in normal ovarian epithelial IOSE80 cells and 5 ovarian cancer cell lines were detected via western blotting. Moreover, two cell lines with high OPN expression were interfered with lentiviral transfection technique. The effects of OPN on ovarian cancer cell proliferation and apoptosis were detected and analyzed via Cell Counting Kit-8 (CCK8) assay and flow cytometry. The positive expression rate of OPN protein in tumor tissues was higher than that in para-carcinoma tissues (P<0.05). Survival curves suggested that both DFS and OS in OPN negative group were superior to those in OPN positive group (P<0.05). Results of western blotting showed that OPN was weakly expressed in IOSE80 cells, whereas it was highly expressed in SKOV-3, COC1, A2780, HO-8910 and OVCAR-3 cells, among which the OPN protein expression levels were relatively higher in SKOV-3 and OVCAR-3 cell lines. After knockdown of OPN gene with sh-OPN, the cell proliferation rates of OVCAR-3 and SKOV-3 were significantly decreased from 48 h (P<0.05), but the apoptosis level was increased remarkably (28.2 vs. 1.3% and 25.3 vs. 3.2%), and differences were statistically significant (P<0.05). In conclusion, overexpression of OPN enhances the proliferation of ovarian cancer cells, which is an adverse factor for patient survival and prognosis.",Grape seed proanthocyanidins inhibit proliferation of pancreatic cancer cells by modulating microRNA expression.,https://www.ncbi.nlm.nih.gov/pubmed/30854052,Oncology letters,2019 03 29,"MicroRNAs (miRNAs) are small non-coding RNAs of 18-25 nucleotides that modulate gene expression at the post-transcriptional level. Grape seed proanthocyanidins (GSPs), which are biologically active components in grape seeds, have been demonstrated to exhibit anticancer effects. The current study investigated whether GSPs can regulate miRNA expression and the possible anticancer molecular mechanisms of GSPs. Pancreatic cancer (PC) cell samples, SS3, SS12 and SS24, were treated with 20 µg/ml GSPs for 3, 12 and 24 h, respectively. Control samples, SC3, SC12 and SC24, were also prepared. Using miRNA-seq, transcriptome analysis identified 24, 83 and 83 differentially expressed (DE) miRNAs in SS3 vs. SC3, SS12 vs. SC12 and SS24 vs. SC24, respectively. This indicated that treatment with GSPs could modulate the expression of miRNAs. Subsequently, 74, 598 and 1,204 target genes for the three sets of DE miRNAs were predicted. Gene Ontology and Kyoto Encyclopedia of Genes and Genomes analysis revealed that multiple target genes were associated with the proliferation and apoptosis of PC cells. In addition, a network was constructed of the DE miRNAs and the target genes associated with PC. The associations identified suggested that treatment with GSPs may inhibit the proliferation of PC cells through the modulation of miRNA expression.","DW-MRI for esophageal squamous cell carcinoma, correlations between ADC values with histologic differentiation and VEGF expression: A retrospective study.",https://www.ncbi.nlm.nih.gov/pubmed/30854051,Oncology letters,2019 03 29,"The aim of the present study was to assess the correlations between diffusion-weighted magnetic resonance imaging (DW-MRI) features with the histologic differentiation and the expression of vascular endothelial growth factor (VEGF) in esophageal squamous cell carcinoma (ESCC). A total of 52 patients with ESCC included in the present study received radiotherapy, and all patients underwent contrast enhanced MRI and DW-MRI prior to and following radiotherapy. The diffusion sensitivity coefficient (b value) was set as 800 s/mm2. Apparent diffusion coefficient (ADC) values were automatically computed. VEGF expression was evaluated by immunohistochemical staining. The results demonstrated that the pathological grading of ESCC was positively correlated with ADC values (r=0.635, P=0.0007), and the VEGF expression was inversely correlated with ADC values (r=-0.321, P=0.008). However, no correlation was identified between the pathological grading and the VEGF expression (r=0.178, P=0.284). All patients were categorized as complete response (CR) or partial response (PR) and the ADC values were increased significantly following radiotherapy. The mean ADC values in the CR group were higher than the PR group prior to radiotherapy (t=5.156, P=0.0004). Therefore, we concluded that the DWI with ADC value measurement may represent the grade of tumor histologic differentiation and the degree of VEGF expression, and may also serve as a useful marker to predict radiotherapy and anti-VEGF response in ESCC. ADC value may be a substitution for assessing tumor angiogenesis and novel prognostic factor and contribute to the treatment of ESCC.",Time profile of nimotuzumab for enhancing radiosensitivity of the Eca109 cell line.,https://www.ncbi.nlm.nih.gov/pubmed/30854050,Oncology letters,2019 03 29,"The aim of the present study was to investigate the ability of Nimotuzumab to increase radiosensitivity at different delivery times in the mixed cancer cell line Eca109, to determine the optimal delivery time. Cultured Eca109 cells were classified into five groups: Control with no treatment (O group); irradiation without Nimotuzumab treatment (R group); treatment with Nimotuzumab 24 h prior to or after irradiation (24NR or 24RN group, respectively); and Nimotuzumab combined with irradiation simultaneously (NR group). Following cells reaching the logarithmic-growth phase, cell survival after exposure to Nimotuzumab was evaluated using an MTT assay; thereafter, the 50% inhibitory concentration (IC50) of the cell line was calculated. Cell-survival curves were generated using a colony-forming assay. Flow cytometry analysis was used to detect apoptosis rates and cell-cycle distribution. The expression level of epidermal growth factor receptor was measured in Eca109 cells with western blotting. Growth inhibition was only observed 72 h after exposure to Nimotuzumab. The IC50 was 768 µg/ml. At a dose of 0.2 IC50 or 0.3 IC50, the sensitization enhancement ratio of radiosensitivity was highest in the 24NR group. Nimotuzumab enhanced radiation-induced apoptosis in Eca109 cells, with the optimal delivery time at 24 h prior to irradiation (P=0.035). The concentration of Nimotuzumab administered was directly proportional to the increase in radiosensitivity of the cells.",SOX5 promotes breast cancer proliferation and invasion by transactivation of EZH2.,https://www.ncbi.nlm.nih.gov/pubmed/30854049,Oncology letters,2019 03 29,"Sex determining region Y-box protein 5 (SOX5) is a transcriptional factor and serves important roles in various cancer types; however, the pathological role of SOX5 in patients with breast cancer remains unclear. In the present study, the expression and potential role of SOX5 in patients with breast cancer and in breast cancer cells was investigated. The data indicated that SOX5 was highly expressed in breast cancer tissues compared with adjacent healthy tissues, and overexpression of SOX5 was associated with a reduced overall survival rate in patients with breast cancer. Gain and loss of function studies with MTT, colony formation, wound healing and Matrigel invasion assays demonstrated that SOX5 significantly promoted breast cancer cell proliferation and invasion. The chromatin immunoprecipitation (ChIP) assay sequence, quantitative ChIP and luciferase reporter assays were used to identify enhancer of zeste 2 polycomb repressive complex 2 subunit (EZH2) as a downstream target gene of SOX5. Furthermore, it was determined that ectopic expression of SOX5 increased EZH2 expression at the mRNA and protein level, while the knockdown of SOX5 decreased EZH2 expression. Additionally, the biological effect of SOX5 was investigated, and it was determined to be dependent on the regulation of EZH2 expression. The present results may provide important insights into the biological significance of SOX5 serving as a candidate therapeutic target in breast cancer progression.",SRC-like adaptor protein negatively regulates Wnt signaling in intrahepatic cholangiocarcinoma.,https://www.ncbi.nlm.nih.gov/pubmed/30854048,Oncology letters,2019 03 29,"Currently, the molecular mechanisms underlying intrahepatic cholangiocarcinoma (IHCC) are poorly understood. In the present study, the focus was primarily on SRC-like adaptor protein (SLAP), an adaptor protein, which is aberrantly expressed in various cancer types. To the best of our knowledge, the present study was the first to demonstrate that SLAP was decreased in IHCC tissues and cells, compared with controls. Further study indicated that SLAP overexpression suppressed IHCC cell proliferation and induced cell cycle arrest, indicating the tumor suppressor role of SLAP in IHCC progression. To demonstrate the effects of SLAP on Wnt signaling, the β-catenin/T cell factor transcription reporter assay was conducted. Compared with the negative adenovirus vector control (Ad-NC), overexpression of SLAP reduced TOPflash activity, and no changes in FOPflash activity were identified. Furthermore, the expression levels of Wnt target genes, including β-catenin, c-Myc, cluster of differentiation 44, Slug, Vimentin and matrix metallopeptidase-9, were reduced in RBE and Huh28 cells overexpressing SLAP. Additionally, the effects of SLAP on IHCC cell invasion and migration were determined. Compared with the Ad-NC control, the migration and invasion capacity was reduced following overexpression of SLAP in RBE and Huh28 cells. In summary, reduced SLAP expression may enhance IHCC malignant progression by activating Wnt signaling.",Higher frequency of dairy intake is associated with a reduced risk of breast cancer: Results from a case-control study in Northern and Eastern China.,https://www.ncbi.nlm.nih.gov/pubmed/30854047,Oncology letters,2019 03 29,"The association between dairy intake and breast cancer risk has not been well investigated, especially in the Chinese population. This study aimed to examine the association between the weekly frequency of dairy intake and the risk of breast cancer among women in Northern and Eastern China, and to investigate whether the association varied by hormone receptor status. A total of 1,286 cases of breast cancer and 1,461 controls were enrolled in this study. Dairy intake was obtained using a food-frequency questionnaire (FFQ). Frequency of dairy intake per week was divided into four categories (<1 day/week, 1-2 days/week, 3-4 days/week and 5-7 days/week). Unconditional multivariate logistic regression analysis was used to estimate odds ratios (ORs) and 95% confidence intervals (95% CI). Stratified analyses were performed by residence, age, and education level. Separate analyses were also conducted for different estrogen receptor (ER) and progesterone receptor (PR) status. This analysis revealed that weekly frequency of dairy intake was strongly inversely associated with breast cancer risk, with an adjusted OR for intake 5-7 days/week of 0.53 (95% CI=0.39-0.72, P<0.001 for trend). In the stratified analyses, women who consumed dairy 5-7 days/week had a lower risk of breast cancer in urban areas (OR=0.45, 95% CI=0.30-0.66, P<0.001 for trend), in the group 45-59 years old (OR=0.39, 95% CI=0.26-0.60, P<0.001 for trend), and in the group educated to senior high school or above (OR=0.39, 95% CI=0.25-0.59, P<0.001 for trend). There was an inverse association between the weekly frequency of dairy intake and the risk of ER+, PR+, and ER+PR+ breast cancer (all P<0.001 for trend). These results indicated that the weekly frequency of dairy intake was inversely associated with the risk of breast cancer among women in Northern and Eastern China."

The lncRNA BX357664 has emerged as a novel lncRNA that was initially recognized by a microarray analysis. The present study aimed to identify the expression and functional roles of lncRNA BX357664 in lung cancer. The transcription level of BX357664 was initially revealed to be downregulated in clinical lung cancer tissues and in a series of lung cancer cell lines. Clinical data demonstrated that the high expression of BX357664 was associated with tumor size, distant metastasis and Tumor-Node-Metastasis stage. Following the overexpression of BX357664 in A549 and 95D cells, the potential of cells to form colonies, as well as the proliferation and motility abilities, were revealed to be decreased. Furthermore, the cell cycle was arrested in the G0/G1 phase by BX357664 modulation. Transwell analysis and a wound-healing assay also demonstrated that overexpression of BX357664 in A549 and 95D cells significantly inhibited cell migration and invasion. These data suggested that BX357664 inhibits cell proliferation and metastasis in lung cancer. The results of the present study provided evidence that BX357664 is a novel lncRNA that may aid in the diagnosis and treatment of lung cancer.",Increased musashi 2 expression indicates a poor prognosis and promotes malignant phenotypes in gastric cancer.,https://www.ncbi.nlm.nih.gov/pubmed/30854035,Oncology letters,2019 03 29,"Musashi 2 (MSI2), a marker of stem and progenitor cells, has been identified as an oncogene. Various investigations have revealed that MSI2 is differently expressed in several types of blood cancer and solid cancers. However, its expression and biological functions in gastric cancer (GC) remain unclear. In the present study, MSI2 mRNA and protein expression were assessed in GC tissue samples. The associations between MSI2 mRNA expression and the clinicopathological characteristics of patients with GC were analyzed, and the effect of MSI2 on the prognosis of patients with GC was verified. The biological functions of MSI2 in GC cells were assessed using gain-of-function assays in vitro. The results revealed that MSI2 was overexpressed in the majority of GC tissue samples, although this difference was not significant. MSI2 mRNA expression levels were associated with invasion depth, tumor-node-metastasis stage, degree of differentiation and tumor size (P<0.05), but were not associated with sex, age, tumor location or human epidermal growth factor receptor 2 expression. Increased MSI2 expression resulted in a poorer prognosis in patients with GC (χ2=4.221; P=0.040). In vitro assays revealed that MSI2 promoted MKN-28 cell proliferation, migration and invasion, and promoted tube formation in HUVECs. Although no significance of MSI2 expression was found, its oncogenic functions in the GC cell line indicated that MSI2 may be a potential oncogene that may serve as a biomarker for GC diagnosis and prognosis with verification from a larger sample and more GC cell lines.",Osteopontin as a biomarker for osteosarcoma therapy and prognosis.,https://www.ncbi.nlm.nih.gov/pubmed/30854034,Oncology letters,2019 03 29,"Osteosarcoma (OS) is the most common bone malignancy, and is particularly prevalent in children and adolescents. OS is an aggressive tumor with a tendency to metastasize and invade to para-carcinoma tissues. The primary treatment for this tumor is a combination of surgery and chemotherapy. However, the prognosis remains poor due to chemoresistance and early metastasis. Osteopontin (OPN), a multifunctional secreted protein, has emerged as an important potential biomarker for diagnosing and treating cancer. The overexpression of OPN has been found in numerous malignant tumors, including breast, lung, gastric and ovarian cancer, as well as melanoma. Recent studies have suggested that OPN may provide an important function in the diagnosis and treatment of OS. The present review summarizes current knowledge and progress in understanding the potential role of OPN as a biomarker in OS.",Combinatorial therapy of immune checkpoint and cancer pathways provides a novel perspective on ovarian cancer treatment.,https://www.ncbi.nlm.nih.gov/pubmed/30854033,Oncology letters,2019 03 29,"An increasing number of studies have reported that immunotherapy serves a significant role in ovarian cancer treatment. In recent years, blockade of checkpoint pathways, including programmed death-ligand 1 (PD-L1)/programmed death-1 and cytotoxic T-lymphocyte-associated protein 4, has demonstrated significant clinical and preclinical benefits in the treatment of ovarian cancer. Additionally, tumor-associated angiogenesis and homologous recombination deficiency frequently occurs in patients with high-grade ovarian cancer, which makes cancer cells more susceptible to targeted therapies, including therapies targeting poly (ADP-ribose) polymerase inhibitor, and anti-angiogenic approaches. Additionally, targeted therapy has been associated with elevated PD-L1 expression in tumor cells, increased T-cell infiltration in tumors and dendritic cell stimulation. This synergistic effect provides the rationale for the joint application of targeted therapy and immunotherapy. Checkpoint blockades are able to elicit durable antitumor immune reactions and complement the transient antitumor effect of targeted therapies. The current review discusses the underlying mechanism of these therapies and novel developments in combined therapy for the treatment of ovarian cancer.",Serum chitotriosidase and neopterin levels in patients with ankylosing spondylitis.,https://www.ncbi.nlm.nih.gov/pubmed/30854031,Therapeutic advances in musculoskeletal disease,2019 03 29,The aim of this study was to assess the serum chitotriosidase (ChT) and neopterin levels in patients with ankylosing spondylitis (AS) and to evaluate whether serum ChT and neopterin levels are related to disease activity.,Eukaryotic Cell Dynamics from Crawlers to Swimmers.,https://www.ncbi.nlm.nih.gov/pubmed/30854030,Wiley interdisciplinary reviews. Computational molecular science,2019 03 29,"Movement requires force transmission to the environment, and motile cells are robustly, though not elegantly, designed nanomachines that often can cope with a variety of environmental conditions by altering the mode of force transmission used. As with humans, the available modes range from momentary attachment to a substrate when crawling, to shape deformations when swimming, and at the cellular level this involves sensing the mechanical properties of the environment and altering the mode appropriately. While many types of cells can adapt their mode of movement to their microenvironment (ME), our understanding of how they detect, transduce and process information from the ME to determine the optimal mode is still rudimentary. The shape and integrity of a cell is determined by its cytoskeleton (CSK), and thus the shape changes that may be required to move involve controlled remodeling of the CSK. Motion in vivo is often in response to extracellular signals, which requires the ability to detect such signals and transduce them into the shape changes and force generation needed for movement. Thus the nanomachine is complex, and while much is known about individual components involved in movement, an integrated understanding of motility in even simple cells such as bacteria is not at hand. In this review we discuss recent advances in our understanding of cell motility and some of the problems remaining to be solved.",Clinical relevance of circulating molecules in cancer: focus on gastrointestinal stromal tumors.,https://www.ncbi.nlm.nih.gov/pubmed/30854029,Therapeutic advances in medical oncology,2019 03 29,"In recent years, growing research interest has focused on the so-called liquid biopsy. A simple blood test offers access to a plethora of information, which might be extremely helpful in understanding or characterizing specific diseases. Blood contains different molecules, of which circulating free DNA (cfDNA), circulating tumor DNA (ctDNA), circulating tumor cells (CTCs) and extracellular vesicles (EVs) are the most relevant. Conceivably, these molecules have the potential for tumor diagnosis, monitoring tumor evolution, and evaluating treatment response and pharmacological resistance. This review aims to present a state-of-the-art of recent advances in circulating DNA and circulating RNA in gastrointestinal stromal tumors (GISTs). To date, progress in liquid biopsy has been scarce in GISTs due to several issues correlated with the nature of the pathology. Namely, heterogeneity in primary and secondary mutations in key driver genes has greatly slowed the development and application in GISTs, unlike in other tumor types in which liquid biopsy has already been translated into clinical practice. However, meaningful novel data have shown in recent years a significant clinical potential of ctDNA, CTCs, EVs and circulating RNA in GISTs.","Breeding progress and preparedness for mass-scale deployment of perennial lignocellulosic biomass crops switchgrass, miscanthus, willow and poplar.",https://www.ncbi.nlm.nih.gov/pubmed/30854028,Global change biology. Bioenergy,2019 05 15,"Genetic improvement through breeding is one of the key approaches to increasing biomass supply. This paper documents the breeding progress to date for four perennial biomass crops (PBCs) that have high output-input energy ratios: namely Panicum virgatum (switchgrass), species of the genera Miscanthus (miscanthus), Salix (willow) and Populus (poplar). For each crop, we report on the size of germplasm collections, the efforts to date to phenotype and genotype, the diversity available for breeding and on the scale of breeding work as indicated by number of attempted crosses. We also report on the development of faster and more precise breeding using molecular breeding techniques. Poplar is the model tree for genetic studies and is furthest ahead in terms of biological knowledge and genetic resources. Linkage maps, transgenesis and genome editing methods are now being used in commercially focused poplar breeding. These are in development in switchgrass, miscanthus and willow generating large genetic and phenotypic data sets requiring concomitant efforts in informatics to create summaries that can be accessed and used by practical breeders. Cultivars of switchgrass and miscanthus can be seed-based synthetic populations, semihybrids or clones. Willow and poplar cultivars are commercially deployed as clones. At local and regional level, the most advanced cultivars in each crop are at technology readiness levels which could be scaled to planting rates of thousands of hectares per year in about 5 years with existing commercial developers. Investment in further development of better cultivars is subject to current market failure and the long breeding cycles. We conclude that sustained public investment in breeding plays a key role in delivering future mass-scale deployment of PBCs.",Understanding the burden of refractory myasthenia gravis.,https://www.ncbi.nlm.nih.gov/pubmed/30854027,Therapeutic advances in neurological disorders,2019 03 29,"Myasthenia gravis (MG) is an autoantibody-mediated disease that compromises the acetylcholine receptors or associated structures of the postsynaptic membrane of the neuromuscular junction. This leads to impaired neuromuscular transmission and subsequent fluctuating fatigability and weakness of ocular, bulbar, and limb skeletal muscles. Over the past few decades, there have been significant advances in our understanding of the disease pathophysiology and improvements in prognosis due to intensive care medicine and immunomodulation. Despite this, an estimated 10-20% of patients with MG do not achieve an adequate response, are intolerant to conventional treatment, or require chronic treatment with intravenous immunoglobulins or plasma separation procedures. Such patients are regarded as having MG that is 'refractory' to treatment and may represent a distinct clinical subgroup. Because the majority of patients with MG have well-controlled disease, the burden of illness in the minority with refractory disease is poorly understood and may be underestimated. However, clinically these patients are liable to experience extreme fatigue, considerable disability owing to uncontrolled symptoms, and frequent myasthenic crises and hospitalizations. Both acute adverse effects and an increased risk of comorbidity from treatment regimens may contribute to reduced quality of life. As yet, little is known concerning the impact of refractory MG on mental health and health-related quality of life. This review aims to highlight the burden of disease and unmet needs in patients with refractory MG.",Smoking detection based on regularity analysis of hand to mouth gestures.,https://www.ncbi.nlm.nih.gov/pubmed/30854022,Biomedical signal processing and control,2019 03 29,"A number of studies have been introduced for the detection of smoking via a variety of features extracted from the wrist IMU data. However, none of the previous studies investigated gesture regularity as a way to detect smoking events. This study describes a novel method to detect smoking events by monitoring the regularity of hand gestures. Here, the regularity of hand gestures was estimated from a one axis accelerometer worn on the wrist of the dominant hand. To quantify the regularity score, this paper applied a novel approach of unbiased autocorrelation to process the temporal sequence of hand gestures. The comparison of regularity score of smoking events with other activities substantiated that hand-to-mouth gestures are highly regular during smoking events and have the potential to detect smoking from among a plethora of daily activities. This hypothesis was validated on a dataset of 140 cigarette smoking events generated by 35 regular smokers in a controlled setting. The regularity of gestures detected smoking events with an F1-score of 0.81. However, the accuracy dropped to 0.49 in the free-living study of same 35 smokers smoking 295 cigarettes. Nevertheless, regularity of gestures may be useful as a supportive tool for other detection methods. To validate that proposition, this paper further incorporated the regularity of gestures in an instrumented lighter based smoking detection algorithm and achieved an improvement in F1-score from 0.89 (lighter only) to 0.91 (lighter and regularity of hand gestures)."

As a part of Traditional Chinese Medicine (TCM), acupuncture has shown the positive efficacy in the management of simple obesity. In this article, we comprehensively review the clinical and animal studies that demonstrated the potential mechanisms of acupuncture treatment for simple obesity. Clinical studies suggested that acupuncture regulates endocrine system, promotes digestion, attenuates oxidative stress, and modulates relevant molecules of metabolism in patients of simple obesity. Evidence from laboratory indicated that acupuncture regulates lipid metabolism, modulates inflammatory responses, and promotes white adipose tissue browning. Acupuncture also suppresses appetite through regulating appetite regulatory hormones and the downstream signaling pathway. The evidence from clinical and animal studies indicates that acupuncture induces multifaceted regulation through complex mechanisms and moreover a single factor may not be enough to explain the beneficial effects against simple obesity.","The Contribution of Complementary and Alternative Medicine to Reduce Antibiotic Use: A Narrative Review of Health Concepts, Prevention, and Treatment Strategies.",https://www.ncbi.nlm.nih.gov/pubmed/30854009,Evidence-based complementary and alternative medicine : eCAM,2019 03 29,The aim of this narrative review was to explore the potential contributions of CAM to reduce antibiotic use.,Effect of Electroacupuncture at Different Acupoints on the Expression of NMDA Receptors in ACC and Colon in IBS Rats.,https://www.ncbi.nlm.nih.gov/pubmed/30854008,Evidence-based complementary and alternative medicine : eCAM,2019 03 29,To observe the effects of electroacupuncture (EA) at different acupoints on the expression of N-methyl-D-aspartate receptor (NMDA receptor ) and behaviors in irritable bowel syndrome (IBS) rats.,Evidence on Integrating Pharmacokinetics to Find Truly Therapeutic Agent for Alzheimer's Disease: Comparative Pharmacokinetics and Disposition Kinetics Profiles of Stereoisomers Isorhynchophylline and Rhynchophylline in Rats.,https://www.ncbi.nlm.nih.gov/pubmed/30854007,Evidence-based complementary and alternative medicine : eCAM,2019 03 29,"Isorhynchophylline (IRN) and rhynchophylline (RN), a pair of stereoisomers, are tetracyclic oxindole alkaloids isolated from Uncaria rhynchophylla, a commonly used Chinese medicinal herb. These two compounds have drawn extensive attention due to their potent neuroprotective effects with promising therapeutic potential for the treatment of Alzheimer's disease (AD). However, IRN and RN can interconvert into each other in vivo after oral administration. The present study aimed to elucidate the pharmacokinetic profiles and disposition kinetics of the administered and generated stereoisomers in the brain and cerebrospinal fluid (CSF) after oral administration of equal dose of IRN or RN to rats. Our study demonstrated that after oral administration, RN showed significantly higher systemic exposure (6.5 folds of IRN, p < 0.001) and disposition in the brain (2.5 folds of IRN, p < 0.01) and CSF (3 folds of IRN, p < 0.001) than IRN. The results indicated that interconversion between IRN and RN occurred. Notably, regardless of the orally administered IRN or RN, RN would always be one of the major or predominant forms present in the body. Our results provided sound evidence supporting further development of RN as a potential therapeutic agent for the treatment of AD. Moreover, the present study sets a solid example that integrating pharmacokinetics is crucial to identify the truly therapeutic agent.","The Efficacy and Safety of a Herbal Toothpaste in Reducing Gingivitis: A Double-Blind, Randomized, Placebo-Controlled, Parallel Allocation Clinical Trial.",https://www.ncbi.nlm.nih.gov/pubmed/30854006,Evidence-based complementary and alternative medicine : eCAM,2019 03 29,To examine the efficacy and safety of the toothpaste containing Rhizoma Chuanxiong and Rhizoma Imperatae extracts in reducing gingivitis.,Study on the Differences between Traditional Chinese Medicine Syndromes in NYHA I-IV Classification of Chronic Heart Failure.,https://www.ncbi.nlm.nih.gov/pubmed/30854005,Evidence-based complementary and alternative medicine : eCAM,2019 03 29,This study investigated the distribution of characteristics of traditional Chinese medicine syndromes and their association with symptoms in 1027 patients with chronic heart failure (CHF).,High Carbohydrate High Fat Diet Induced Hepatic Steatosis and Dyslipidemia Were Ameliorated by Psidium guajava Leaf Powder Supplementation in Rats.,https://www.ncbi.nlm.nih.gov/pubmed/30854003,Evidence-based complementary and alternative medicine : eCAM,2019 03 29,"Psidium guajava leaf is reported to contain many bioactive polyphenols which play an important role in the prevention and treatment of various diseases. Our investigation aimed to study the effect of Psidium guajava leaf powder supplementation on obesity and liver status by using experimental rats. To study the effects of guava leaf supplementation in high fat diet induced obesity, rats were randomly divided into four experimental groups (n=7), control (group I), control + guava leaf (group II), HCHF (group III), and HCHF + guava leaf (group IV). At the end of the experimental period (56 days), glucose intolerance, liver enzymes activities, antioxidant enzymes activities, and lipid and cholesterol profiles were evaluated. Our results revealed that guava leaf powder supplementation showed a significant reduction in fat deposition in obese rats. Moreover, liver enzyme functions were increased in high fat diet fed rats compared to the control rats significantly which were further ameliorated by guava leaf powder supplementation in high fat diet fed rats. High fat diet feeding also decreased the antioxidant enzyme functions and increased the lipid peroxidation products compared to the control rats. Guava leaf powder supplementation in high fat diet fed rats reduced the oxidative stress markers and reestablished antioxidant enzyme system in experimental animals. Guava leaf powder supplementation in high fat diet fed rats also showed a relative decrease in inflammatory cells infiltration and collagen deposition in the liver compared to the high fat diet fed rats. The present study suggests that the supplementation of guava leaf powder prevents obesity, improves glucose intolerance, and decreases inflammation and oxidative stress in liver of high carbohydrate high fat diet fed rats.",A Systems Pharmacology Approach for Identifying the Multiple Mechanisms of Action of the Wei Pi Xiao Decoction for the Treatment of Gastric Precancerous Lesions.,https://www.ncbi.nlm.nih.gov/pubmed/30854000,Evidence-based complementary and alternative medicine : eCAM,2019 03 29,"The Wei Pi Xiao (WPX) decoction, based on the theory of traditional Chinese medicine, has been widely used for the treatment of gastric precancerous lesions (GPL). Although WPX is known to be effective for the treatment of GPL, its active ingredients, cellular targets, and the precise molecular mechanism of action are not known. This study aimed to identify the multiple mechanisms of action of the WPX decoction in the treatment of GPL. The active compounds, drug targets, and the key pathways involved in the therapeutic effect of WPX in the treatment of GPL were analyzed by an integrative analysis pipeline. The information pertaining to the compounds present in WPX and their disease targets was obtained from TCMSP and GeneCards, respectively. The mechanisms underlying the therapeutic effect of WPX were investigated with gene ontology (GO) enrichment analysis and Kyoto Encyclopedia of Genes and Genomes (KEGG) pathway enrichment analysis. A total of 82 bioactive compounds and 146 related targets were identified in this study. Following target analyses, the targets were further mapped to 26 key biological processes and 21 related pathways to construct a target-pathway network and an integrated GPL pathway. The study demonstrated that the WPX formula primarily treats the dysfunctions of GPL arising from cell proliferation, apoptosis, and mucosal inflammation, which offered a novel insight into the pathogenesis of GPL and revealed the molecular mechanism underlying the therapeutic effects of the WPX formula in GPL. This study offers a novel approach for the systematic investigation of the mechanisms of action of herbal medicines, which will provide an impetus to the GPL drug development pipeline.",Flavonol 7-O-Glucoside Herbacitrin Inhibits HIV-1 Replication through Simultaneous Integrase and Reverse Transcriptase Inhibition.,https://www.ncbi.nlm.nih.gov/pubmed/30853999,Evidence-based complementary and alternative medicine : eCAM,2019 03 29,"Here we report the evaluation of the antiretroviral effect of two flavonoid 7-O-glucosides, herbacitrin (1) and gossypitrin (2), together with quercetin (3), a well-studied flavonol. Antiviral activity of the flavonoids was assessed by analyzing HIV-1 p24 core protein levels in the supernatants of HIV-1 infected MT-4 and MT-2 cell cultures. The compounds showed mild to weak cytotoxic activities on the host cells; herbacitrin was the strongest in this regard (CC50=27.8 and 63.64 μM on MT-4 and MT-2 cells, respectively). In nontoxic concentrations, herbacitrin and quercetin reduced HIV-1 replication, whereas gossypitrin was ineffective. Herbacitrin was found to inhibit reverse transcriptase at 21.5 μM, while it was a more potent integrase inhibitor already active at 2.15 μM. Therefore, our observations suggest that herbacitrin exerts antiretroviral activity through simultaneously acting on these two targets of HIV-1 and that integrase inhibition might play a major role in this activity.",Exposure to Secondhand Tobacco Smoke at Airport Terminals.,https://www.ncbi.nlm.nih.gov/pubmed/30853997,Journal of environmental and public health,2019 03 29,"Airports may represent significant sources of secondhand smoke (SHS) exposure for both travelers and employees.

Despite the tremendous clinical success of immunotherapy over other cancer treatments, this approach has shown substantial benefit to only some of the patients while the rest of the patients have not responded due to immune evasion. In recent years, a combination of cancer immunotherapy together with existing anticancer treatments has gained significant attention and has been extensively investigated in preclinical or clinical studies. In this review, we discuss the therapeutic potential of novel regimens combining immune checkpoint inhibitors with therapeutic interventions that (1) increase tumor immunogenicity such as chemotherapy, radiotherapy, and epigenetic therapy; (2) reverse tumor immunosuppression such as TAMs, MDSCs, and Tregs targeted therapy; and (3) reduce tumor burden and increase the immune effector response with rationally designed dual or triple inhibitory chemotypes.",From Whole-Brain Radiotherapy to Immunotherapy: A Multidisciplinary Approach for Patients with Brain Metastases from NSCLC.,https://www.ncbi.nlm.nih.gov/pubmed/30853981,Journal of oncology,2019 03 29,"Non-small cell lung cancer patients with brain metastases have a multitude of treatment options, but there is currently no international and multidisciplinary consensus concerning their optimal treatment. Local therapies have the principal role, especially in symptomatic patients. Advances in surgery and radiation therapy manage considerable local control. Systemic treatments have shown effect in clinical trials and in real life clinical settings; yet, at present, this is restricted to patients with asymptomatic or stable intracranial lesions. Targeted agents can have a benefit only in patients with EGFR mutations or ALK rearrangement. Immunotherapy has shown impressive results in patients with PD-L1 expression in tumor cells. Its effects can be further enhanced by a synergy with radiotherapy, possibly by increasing the percentage of responders.

In the present study, the phytoremediation potential of Chara vulgaris (C. vulgaris) is investigated for treatment of textile effluent. The highly concentrated and toxic textile effluent is diluted to different concentrations 10%, 25%, 50%, and 75% to check the accessibility of macroalgae to bear pollutant load of textile effluent. The toxicity of textile effluent is analysed by determining different water quality parameters, namely, pH, TDS, BOD, COD, and EC. The maximum reductions in TDS (68%), COD (78%), BOD (82%), and EC (86%) were found in the 10% concentrated textile effluent after 120 h of treatment. The highly concentrated textile effluent showed its toxic effect on macroalgae and it was found unable to show a remarkable change in water quality parameters of 75% and 100% textile effluent. The correlation coefficient values are determined using correlation matrix to identify the high correlation between different water quality parameters. The removal of toxic organic pollutants by C. vulgaris was confirmed by using UV-visible absorption spectra. Typical X-ray spectra recorded using EDXRF technique indicated the presence of heavy metals Cd in the dried sample of macroalgae after treatment which show its capability to remove toxic heavy metals from textile effluent. The reliability model has been proposed for treated textile effluents to identify percentage level of toxicity tolerance of waste water by macroalgae.",Phytochemical Screening and Toxicological Study of Aristolochia baetica Linn Roots: Histopathological and Biochemical Evidence.,https://www.ncbi.nlm.nih.gov/pubmed/30853978,Journal of toxicology,2019 03 29,"Aristolochia baetica (A. baetica) is a wild species of Aristolochiaceae family; its roots are used by Moroccan people against cancer for many years ago. The objective of the study was to investigate the phytochemical screening, acute and subacute toxicity of A. baetica roots growing in the north of Morocco. Qualitative and quantitative analyses of A. baetica roots were performed using standard methods; the acute toxicity of the root extract of the studied plant was assessed in mice by gavage of single doses of 1, 2, and 4 g/kg body weight for 14 days; by the time the subacute toxicity was done using repeated doses 1, 1.5, and 2 g/kg/day for 28 days. Histological changes and biochemical parameters as markers of kidney and liver function were evaluated. The results of phytochemical screening showed the presence of polyphenols, tannins, alkaloids, flavonoids, saponins, and the absence of anthraquinones, sterols, and terpenes. The results of acute toxicity showed the absence of mortality and signs of toxicity in groups treated with 1 and 2 g/kg; however, the clinical signs of toxicity were important and the rate of mortality was estimated at 16 % in the group treated with 4 g/kg. The results of subacute toxicity showed several changes of serum parameters registered in groups treated with 1.5 and 2 g/kg/day, respectively. The results showed also the absence of histological injuries in groups treated with 1 and 1.5 g/kg/day; meanwhile, the histological alterations were remarkable in treated group with the highest dose administered of 2 g/kg/day. The outcome of this work showed that the roots' extract of the studied plant was toxic in mice with repeated doses, but no toxic effect was observed with a single dose under 4g/kg.",Association and Functional Analyses Revealed That PPP1R3B Plays an Important Role in the Regulation of Glycogen Content in the Pacific Oyster Crassostrea gigas.,https://www.ncbi.nlm.nih.gov/pubmed/30853975,Frontiers in genetics,2019 03 29,"The Pacific oyster (Crassostrea gigas) is one of the most important aquaculture species worldwide. Glycogen contributes greatly to the special taste and creamy white color of oysters. Previous genome-wide association studies (GWAS) identified several single nucleotide polymorphism (SNP) sites that were strongly related to glycogen content. Genes within 100 kb upstream and downstream of the associated SNPs were screened. One gene annotated as protein phosphatase 1 regulatory subunit 3B (PPP1R3B), which can promote glycogen synthesis together with protein phosphatase 1 catalytic subunit (PPP1C) in mammals, was selected as a candidate gene in this study. First, full-length CgPPP1R3B was cloned and its function was characterized. The gene expression profiles of CgPPP1R3B in different tissues and seasons showed a close relationship to glycogen content. RNA interference (RNAi) experiments of this gene in vivo showed that decreased CgPPP1R3B levels resulted in lower glycogen contents in the experimental group than in the control group. Co-immunoprecipitation (Co-IP) and yeast two-hybrid (Y2H) assays indicated that CgPPP1R3B can interact with CgPPP1C, glycogen synthase (CgGS) and glycogen phosphorylase (CgGP), thus participating in glycogen metabolism. Co-sedimentation analysis in vitro demonstrated that the CgPPP1R3B protein can bind to glycogen molecules directly, and these results indicated the conserved function of the CgPPP1R3B protein compared to that of mammals. In addition, thirteen SNPs were precisely mapped in this gene. Ten of the thirteen SNPs were confirmed to be significantly (p < 0.05) related to glycogen content in an independent wild population (n = 288). The CgPPP1R3B levels in oysters with high glycogen content were significantly higher than those of oysters with low glycogen content, and gene expression levels were significantly associated with various genotypes of four associated SNPs (p < 0.05). The data indicated that the associated SNPs may control glycogen content by regulating CgPPP1R3B expression. These results suggest that CgPPP1R3B is an important gene for glycogen metabolic regulation and that the associated SNPs of this gene are potential markers for oyster molecular breeding for increased glycogen content.",Genetic Incompatibilities Between Mitochondria and Nuclear Genes: Effect on Gene Flow and Speciation.,https://www.ncbi.nlm.nih.gov/pubmed/30853974,Frontiers in genetics,2019 03 29,"The process of speciation is, according to the biological species concept, the reduction in gene flow between genetically diverging populations. Most of the previous theoretical studies analyzed the effect of nuclear genetic incompatibilities on gene flow. There is, however, an increasing number of empirical examples suggesting that cytoplasmically inherited genetic elements play an important role in speciation. Here, we present a theoretical analysis of mitochondrial driven speciation, in which genetic incompatibilities occur between mitochondrial haplotypes and nuclear alleles. Four population genetic models with mainland-island structure were analyzed that differ with respect to the type of incompatibility and the underlying genetics. Gene flow reduction was measured on selectively neutral alleles of an unlinked locus and quantified by the effective migration rate. Analytical formulae for the different scenarios were derived using the fitness graph method. For the models with haploid genetics, we found that mito-nuclear incompatibilities (MtNI) are as strong as nuclear-nuclear incompatibilities (NNI) in reducing gene flow at the unlinked locus, but only if males and females migrate in equal number. For models with diploid genetics, we found that MtNI reduce gene flow stronger than NNI when incompatibilities are recessive, but weaker when they are dominant. For both haploid and diploid MtNI, we found that gene flow reduction is stronger if females are the migrating sex, but weaker than NNI when males are the migrating sex. These results encourage further examination on the role of mitochondria on genetic divergence and speciation and point toward specific factors (e.g., migrating sex) that could be the focus of an empirical test.",Novel Compound Heterozygous Mutations in the TRAPPC9 Gene in Two Siblings With Autism and Intellectual Disability.,https://www.ncbi.nlm.nih.gov/pubmed/30853973,Frontiers in genetics,2019 03 29,"Autism spectrum disorder (ASD) is a highly heterogeneous neurodevelopmental disorder with many contributing risk genes and loci. To date, several intellectual disability (ID) susceptibility genes have frequently been identified in ASD. Here, whole exome sequencing was carried out on a proband with ASD and identified compound heterozygous mutations of the TRAPPC9, which plays a role in the neuronal NF-κB signaling pathway. These mutations consisted of a novel frameshift mutation (c.2415_2416insC, p.His806Profs∗9) and a rare splice site mutation (c.3349+1G>A) that were segregated from an unaffected father and unaffected mother, respectively. These two heterozygous mutations were also identified in the patient's older brother with ID. Quantitative RT-PCR revealed a significant reduction of TRAPPC9 transcript in two siblings. This study first describes compound heterozygous mutations of the TRAPPC9 gene in two siblings with ASD and ID, which is notable as only homozygous mutations or compound heterozygous for copy number variations and rare variant in this gene have been reported to date and associated with autosomal recessive intellectual disability. The two siblings carrying compound heterozygous TRAPPC9 mutations presented with ID, developmental delay, microcephaly and brain abnormalities similarly to the clinical features found in almost cases with homozygous TRAPPC9 mutation in previous studies. Together this study provides evidence that clinical manifestations of TRAPPC9 mutations as seen in our patients with ID and autism may be broader than previous case reports have indicated.",A Novel α-Galactosidase A Splicing Mutation Predisposes to Fabry Disease.,https://www.ncbi.nlm.nih.gov/pubmed/30853972,Frontiers in genetics,2019 03 29,"Fabry disease (FD) is a rare X-linked α-galactosidase A (GLA) deficiency, resulting in progressive lysosomal accumulation of globotriaosylceramide (Gb3) in a variety of cell types. Here, we report a novel splicing mutation (c.801 + 1G > A) that results in alternative splicing in GLA of a FD patient with variable phenotypic presentations of renal involvement. Sequencing of the RT-PCR products from the patient's blood sample reveals a 36-nucleotide (nt) insertion exists at the junction between exons 5 and 6 of the GLA cDNA. Splicing assay indicates that the mutated minigene produces an alternatively spliced transcript which causes a frameshift resulting in an early termination of protein expression. Immunofluorescence shows puncta in cytoplasm for mutated GLA whereas uniform staining small dots evenly distributed inside cytoplasm for wild type GLA in transfected HeLa cells. The increased senescence and decreased GLA enzyme activity suggest that the abnormalities might be due to the altered localization which further might result from the lack of the C-terminal end of GLA.

In contrast, the reciprocal microduplications of 1q43-q44 region have been less frequently reported and patients showed a variable phenotype, including macrocephaly. Reports of a large number of patients with copy number variations involving this region highlighted the AKT3 gene as a likely key player in head size anomalies. We report four novel patients with copy number variations in the 1q43-q44 region: one with a larger deletion (3.7Mb), two with smaller deletions affecting AKT3 and SDCCAG8 genes (0.16 and 0.18Mb) and one with a quadruplication (1Mb) that affects the entire AKT3 gene. All patients with deletions presented MIC without structural brain abnormalities, whereas the patient with quadruplication had macrocephaly, but his carrier father had normal head circumference. Our report also includes a comparison of phenotypes in cases with 1q43-q44 duplications to assist future genotype-phenotype correlations. Our observations implicate AKT3 as a contributor to ID/development delay (DD) and head size but raise doubts about its straightforward impact on the latter aspect of the phenotype in patients with 1q43-q44 deletion/duplication syndrome."

Tumor associated macrophages (TAMs) showing functional plasticity contribute to this process as so called M2-like macrophages can suppress the function of effector T cells and promote their differentiation into regulatory T cells (Tregs). Furthermore, tumor antigen specific CD4+ T effector cells can essentially sustain anti-tumoral immune responses as shown for various tumor entities, thus suggesting that cognate interaction between tumor antigen-specific CD4+ Th1 cells and TAMs might shift the intra-tumoral M1/M2 ratio toward M1. This study demonstrates repolarization of M2-like PECs upon MHC II-restricted interaction with tumor specific CD4+ Th1 cells in vitro as shown by extensive gene and protein expression analyses. Moreover, adoptive transfer of OVA-specific OT-II cells into C57BL/6 mice bearing OVA expressing IAb-/- tumors resulted in increased accumulation of M1-like TAMs with enhanced M1 associated gene and protein expression profiles.

Upon microbial infection, MAIT cells rapidly produce cytokines and cytotoxic effectors, and are thus important players in anti-microbial defense. MAIT cells are protective in experimental models of infection and are decreased in the blood of adult patients with bacterial infections, including Mycobacterium tuberculosis (Mtb). In children, the risk of rapid progression to active tuberculosis (TB) following Mtb infection is higher than in adults. Whether MAIT cells influence the outcome of Mtb infection in children is therefore, an important issue. We analyzed MAIT cell numbers and phenotype in 115 children investigated for pulmonary TB and determined their potential correlation with disease progression. MAIT cells were reduced in numbers and activated in the peripheral blood of children with active TB as compared to those with latent TB infection (LTBI) and healthy children. Moreover, MAIT cells did not accumulate and did not proliferate in the lung of children with active TB. These results suggest that MAIT cells may be important in preventing progression of Mtb infection to active TB in children.",Ways Forward for Tolerance-Inducing Cellular Therapies- an AFACTT Perspective.,https://www.ncbi.nlm.nih.gov/pubmed/30853957,Frontiers in immunology,2019 03 29,"Clinical studies with cellular therapies using tolerance-inducing cells, such as tolerogenic antigen-presenting cells (tolAPC) and regulatory T cells (Treg) for the prevention of transplant rejection and the treatment of autoimmune diseases have been expanding the last decade.

Damage to the gastrointestinal (GI) tract from acute GVHD is a particularly serious event that can result in significant morbidity and mortality. Proinflammatory cytokines play a critical role in the pathophysiology of intestinal GVHD, in part by activating donor T cell populations which subsequently induce tissue damage. In this review, we summarize pre-clinical data derived from experimental murine models that have examined the role of inflammatory cytokine pathways that play critical roles in the pathophysiology of GVHD of the GI tract. Specific areas of focus are on STAT 3-dependent cytokines (e.g., IL-6, IL-23, and IL-21), and members of the IL-1 cytokine family, both of which have been shown to induce pathological damage within the GI tract during this disease.

Among the six fermented cultivars, Shafaq 2006 showed relatively higher degradation of gliadin. In comparison to the other tested wheat varieties, fermentation of Lasani 2006 was associated with minimal toxic effects on Caco-2 cells in terms of ruffle formation, tight junction proteins and TER, which can be attributed to extensive degradation of toxic gliadin fragments.",Diagnostic Parameters of Adenoviremia in Pediatric Stem Cell Transplant Recipients.,https://www.ncbi.nlm.nih.gov/pubmed/30853954,Frontiers in microbiology,2019 03 29,"Despite recent progress in the diagnostic risk assessment of human adenovirus (HAdV) infections in immunocompromised patients, clinical complications mediated by these viruses continue contributing to significant morbidity and mortality, particularly in the pediatric hematopoietic allogeneic stem cell transplant (HSCT) setting.

The advent of novel, more effective antiviral treatment options might permit successful virus control even at the stage of systemic infection, thus increasing the interest in optimized HAdV monitoring in peripheral blood (PB). We have screened over 300 pediatric HCST recipients by serial monitoring of stool and PB specimens, and identified 31 cases of invasive HAdV infection by quantitative pan-adenovirus RQ-PCR analysis of consecutive PB specimens. The diagnostic parameters assessed included HAdV peak levels (PL) and the time-averaged area under the curve (AAUC) of virus copy numbers. The predictive value for patient outcome reflected by non-relapse and HAdV-related mortality was determined. The patients were assigned to quartiles based on their PL and AAUC, and the readouts were highly correlated (p < 0.0001). Non-relapse mortality in patients by AAUC quartile (lowest to highest) was 26, 50, 75, and 86%, respectively, and AAUC was strongly correlated with non-relapse mortality (p < 0.0001), while the association between PL and non-relapse mortality was less pronounced (p = 0.013). HAdV-related mortality was absent or very low in patients within the two lower quartiles of both PL and AAUC, and increased to ≥70% in the upper two quartiles. Despite the significant correlation of PL and AAUC with patient outcome, it is necessary to consider that the risk of non-relapse mortality even within the lowest quartile was still relatively high, and it might be difficult therefore to translate the results into differential treatment approaches. By contrast, the correlation with HAdV-related mortality might permit the identification of a low-risk patient subset. Nevertheless, the well-established correlation of HAdV shedding into the stool and intestinal expansion of the virus with the risk of invasive infection will expectedly remain an essential diagnostic parameter in the pediatric HSCT setting.","Salmonella and Enterohemorrhagic Escherichia coli Serogroups O45, O121, O145 in Wheat Flour: Effects of Long-Term Storage and Thermal Treatments.",https://www.ncbi.nlm.nih.gov/pubmed/30853953,Frontiers in microbiology,2019 03 29,"Salmonella and enterohemorrhagic Escherichia coli (EHEC) are of serious concern in wheat flour and its related products but little is known on their survival and thermal death kinetics. This study was undertaken to determine their long-term viability and thermal inactivation kinetics in flour. Inoculation was performed using mixtures of EHEC serogroups O45, O121, O145 and Salmonella followed by storage at room temperature (23°C) or 35°C (for Salmonella). Plate counting on tryptic soy agar (TSA) and enrichment were used to assess long-term survival. For thermal studies, wheat flour samples were heated at 55, 60, 65, and 70°C and cell counts of EHEC and Salmonella were determined by plating. The δ-values were calculated using the Weibull model. At room temperature, EHEC serovars and Salmonella were quantifiable for 84 and 112 days, and were detectable for the duration of the experiment after 168 and 365 days, respectively. The δ-values were 2.0, 5.54, and 9.3 days, for EHEC O121, O45, and O145, respectively, and 9.7 days for Salmonella. However, the only significant difference among all values was the δ-value for Salmonella and serogroup O121 (p ≤ 0.05). At 35°C, Salmonella counts declined to unquantifiable levels after a week and were not detected upon enrichment after 98 days. Heat treatment of inoculated wheat flour at 55, 60, 65, and 70°C resulted in δ-value ranges of 20.0-42.9, 4.9-10.0, 2.4-3.2, and 0.2-1.6 min, respectively, for EHEC. The δ-values for Salmonella at those temperatures were 152.2, 40.8, 17.9, and 17.4 min, respectively. The δ-values obtained for Salmonella at each temperature were significantly longer than for EHEC (p ≤ 0.05). Weibull model was a good fit to describe the thermal death kinetics of Salmonella and EHEC O45, O121 and O145 in wheat flour. HIGHLIGHTS -EHEC and Salmonella can survive for extended periods of time in wheat flour.-Long-term storage inactivation curves of EHEC and Salmonella were similar.-EHEC was more sensitive to heat than Salmonella.-Weibull model was a good fit to describe thermal death kinetics of EHEC and Salmonella.-Flour storage at 35°C may be a feasible method for microbial reduction.","Porphyrin Excretion Resulting From Mutation of a Gene Encoding a Class I Fructose 1,6-Bisphosphate Aldolase in Rhodobacter capsulatus.",https://www.ncbi.nlm.nih.gov/pubmed/30853951,Frontiers in microbiology,2019 03 29,"This paper describes a mutant (called SB1707) of the Rhodobacter capsulatus wild type strain SB1003 in which a transposon-disrupted rcc01707 gene resulted in a ∼25-fold increase in the accumulation of coproporphyrin III in the medium of phototrophic (anaerobic) cultures grown in a yeast extract/peptone medium. There was little or no stimulation of pigment accumulation in aerobic cultures. Therefore, this effect of rcc01707 mutation appears to be specific for the anaerobic coproporphyrinogen III oxidase HemN as opposed to the aerobic enzyme HemF. The protein encoded by rcc01707 is homologous to Class I fructose 1,6-bisphosphate aldolases, which catalyze a glycolytic reaction that converts fructose 1, 6-bisphosphate to dihydroxyacetone phosphate and glyceraldehyde 3-phosphate, precursors of pyruvate. There were significant differences in coproporphyrin III accumulation using defined media with individual organic acids and sugars as the sole carbon source: pyruvate, succinate and glutamate stimulated accumulation the most, whereas glucose suppressed coproporphyrin III accumulation to 10% of that of succinate. However, although quantitatively lesser, similar effects of carbon source on the amount of accumulated pigment in the culture medium were seen in a wild type control. Therefore, this mutation appears to exaggerate effects also seen in the wild type strain. It is possible that mutation of rcc01707 causes a metabolic bottleneck or imbalance that was not rectified during growth on the several carbon sources tested. However, we speculate that, analogous to other fructose 1,6-bisphosphate aldolases, the rcc01707 gene product has a ""moonlighting"" activity that in this case is needed for the maximal expression of the hemN gene. Indeed, it was found that the rcc01707 gene is needed for maximal expression of a hemN promoter-lacZ reporter. With the decrease in hemN expression due to the absence of the rcc01707 gene product, coproporphyrinogen III accumulates and is released from the cell, yielding the spontaneous oxidation product coproporphyrin III.",Evolutionary Patterns of Thylakoid Architecture in Cyanobacteria.,https://www.ncbi.nlm.nih.gov/pubmed/30853950,Frontiers in microbiology,2019 03 29,"While photosynthetic processes have become increasingly understood in cyanobacterial model strains, differences in the spatial distribution of thylakoid membranes among various lineages have been largely unexplored. Cyanobacterial cells exhibit an intriguing diversity in thylakoid arrangements, ranging from simple parietal to radial, coiled, parallel, and special types. Although metabolic background of their variability remains unknown, it has been suggested that thylakoid patterns are stable in certain phylogenetic clades. For decades, thylakoid arrangements have been used in cyanobacterial classification as one of the crucial characters for definition of taxa. The last comprehensive study addressing their evolutionary history in cyanobacteria was published 15 years ago. Since then both DNA sequence and electron microscopy data have grown rapidly. In the current study, we map ultrastructural data of >200 strains onto the SSU rRNA gene tree, and the resulting phylogeny is compared to a phylogenomic tree. Changes in thylakoid architecture in general follow the phylogeny of housekeeping loci. Parietal arrangement is resolved as the original thylakoid organization, evolving into complex arrangement in the most derived group of heterocytous cyanobacteria. Cyanobacteria occupying intermediate phylogenetic positions (greater filamentous, coccoid, and baeocytous types) exhibit fascicular, radial, and parallel arrangements, partly tracing the reconstructed course of phylogenetic branching. Contrary to previous studies, taxonomic value of thylakoid morphology seems very limited. Only special cases such as thylakoid absence or the parallel arrangement could be used as taxonomically informative apomorphies. The phylogenetic trees provide evidence of both paraphyly and reversion from more derived architectures in the simple parietal thylakoid pattern. Repeated convergent evolution is suggested for the radial and fascicular architectures. Moreover, thylakoid arrangement is constrained by cell size, excluding the occurrence of complex architectures in cyanobacteria smaller than 2 μm in width. It may further be dependent on unknown (eco)physiological factors as suggested by recurrence of the radial type in unrelated but morphologically similar cyanobacteria, and occurrence of special features throughout the phylogeny. No straightforward phylogenetic congruences have been found between proteins involved in photosynthesis and thylakoid formation, and the thylakoid patterns. Remarkably, several postulated thylakoid biogenesis factors are partly or completely missing in cyanobacteria, challenging their proposed essential roles.",Seasonal Occurrence and Carbapenem Susceptibility of Bovine Acinetobacter baumannii in Germany.,https://www.ncbi.nlm.nih.gov/pubmed/30853949,Frontiers in microbiology,2019 03 29,"Acinetobacter baumannii is one of the leading causes of nosocomial infections in humans. To investigate its prevalence, distribution of sequence types (STs), and antimicrobial resistance in cattle, we sampled 422 cattle, including 280 dairy cows, 59 beef cattle, and 83 calves over a 14-month period. Metadata, such as the previous use of antimicrobial agents and feeding, were collected to identify putative determining factors. Bacterial isolates were identified via MALDI-TOF/MS and PCR, antimicrobial susceptibility was evaluated via VITEK2 and antibiotic gradient tests, resistance genes were identified by PCR. Overall, 15.6% of the cattle harbored A. baumannii, predominantly in the nose (60.3% of the A. baumannii isolates). It was more frequent in dairy cows (21.1%) than in beef cattle (6.8%) and calves (2.4%). A seasonal occurrence was shown with a peak between May and August. The rate of occurrence of A. baumannii was correlated with a history of use of 3rd generation cephalosporins in the last 6 months prior to sampling Multilocus sequence typing (Pasteur scheme) revealed 83 STs among 126 unique isolates. Nine of the bovine STs have previously been implicated in human infections. Besides known intrinsic resistance of the species, the isolates did not show additional resistance to the antimicrobial substances tested, including carbapenems. Our data suggest that cattle are not a reservoir for nosocomial A. baumannii but carry a highly diverse population of this species. Nevertheless, some STs seem to be able to colonize both cattle and humans."

In addition to immuno-modulating therapies patients benefit from symptomatic approaches like intrathecal corticosteroid therapy (ICT), which is frequently applied in a growing number of centers in Germany. ICT reduces spasticity, which elongates patient's walking distance and speed, thus improves quality of life. Methods: In our study we set out to investigate cerebrospinal fluid (CSF) parameters and clinical predictors for response to ICT. Therefore, we analyzed 811 CSF samples collected from 354 patients over a time period of 12 years. Patients who received ICT were divided in two groups (improving or active group) depending on their EDSS-progress. As control groups we analyzed data of ICT naïve patients, who were divided in the two groups as well. Additionally we observed the clinical progress after receiving ICT by comparison of patients in both groups. Results: The results showed clinical data had a significant influence on the probability to benefit from ICT. The probability (shown by Odds Ratio of 1.77-2.43) to belong to the improving group in contrast to the active group is significantly (p < 0.0001) higher at later stages of disease with early disease onset (< 35 years, OR = 2.43) and higher EDSS at timepoint of ICT-initiation (EDSS > 6, OR = 2.06). Additionally, we observed lower CSF cell counts (6.68 ± 1.37 μl) and lower total CSF protein (412 ± 18.25 mg/l) of patients who responded to ICT compared to patients who did not (p < 0.05). In the control group no significant differences were revealed. Furthermore analyses of our data revealed patients belonging to the improving group reach an EDSS of 6 after ICT-initiation less often than patients of the active group (after 13 years 39.8% in the improving group, 67.8% in the active group). Conclusion: Our study implies two relevant messages: (i) although the study was not designed to prospectively assess clinical data, in this cohort no severe side effects were observed under ICT; (ii) disease onset, EDSS, CSF cell count, and total protein may serve as predictive markers for therapy response.","Hereditary Spastic Paraplegia Is a Common Phenotypic Finding in ARG1 Deficiency, P5CS Deficiency and HHH Syndrome: Three Inborn Errors of Metabolism Caused by Alteration of an Interconnected Pathway of Glutamate and Urea Cycle Metabolism.",https://www.ncbi.nlm.nih.gov/pubmed/30853934,Frontiers in neurology,2019 03 29,"Hereditary Spastic Paraplegias (HSPs) are a clinically and genetically heterogeneous group of neurodegenerative disorders characterized by a progressive rigidity and weakness of the lower limbs, caused by pyramidal tract lesions. As of today, 80 different forms of HSP have been mapped, 64 genes have been cloned, and new forms are constantly being described. HSPs represent an intensively studied field, and the functional understanding of the biochemical and molecular pathogenetic pathways are starting to be elucidated. Recently, dominant and recessive mutations in the ALDH18A1 gene resulting in the deficiency of the encoded enzyme (delta-1-pyrroline-5-carboxylate synthase, P5CS) have been pathogenetically linked to HSP. P5CS is a critical enzyme in the conversion of glutamate to pyrroline-5-carboxylate, an intermediate that enters in the proline biosynthesis and that is connected with the urea cycle. Interestingly, two urea cycle disorders, Argininemia and Hyperornithinemia-Hyperammonemia-Homocitrullinuria syndrome, are clinically characterized by highly penetrant spastic paraplegia. These three diseases represent a peculiar group of HSPs caused by Inborn Errors of Metabolism. Here we comment on these forms, on the common features among them and on the hypotheses for possible shared pathogenetic mechanisms causing the HSP phenotype.",Standards in Pupillography.,https://www.ncbi.nlm.nih.gov/pubmed/30853933,Frontiers in neurology,2019 04 06,"The number of research groups studying the pupil is increasing, as is the number of publications. Consequently, new standards in pupillography are needed to formalize the methodology including recording conditions, stimulus characteristics, as well as suitable parameters of evaluation. Since the description of intrinsically photosensitive retinal ganglion cells (ipRGCs) there has been an increased interest and broader application of pupillography in ophthalmology as well as other fields including psychology and chronobiology. Color pupillography plays an important role not only in research but also in clinical observational and therapy studies like gene therapy of hereditary retinal degenerations and psychopathology. Stimuli can vary in size, brightness, duration, and wavelength. Stimulus paradigms determine whether rhodopsin-driven rod responses, opsin-driven cone responses, or melanopsin-driven ipRGC responses are primarily elicited. Background illumination, adaptation state, and instruction for the participants will furthermore influence the results. This standard recommends a minimum set of variables to be used for pupillography and specified in the publication methodologies. Initiated at the 32nd International Pupil Colloquium 2017 in Morges, Switzerland, the aim of this manuscript is to outline standards in pupillography based on current knowledge and experience of pupil experts in order to achieve greater comparability of pupillographic studies. Such standards will particularly facilitate the proper application of pupillography by researchers new to the field. First we describe general standards, followed by specific suggestions concerning the demands of different targets of pupil research: the afferent and efferent reflex arc, pharmacology, psychology, sleepiness-related research and animal studies.",Amide Proton Transfer MRI Signal as a Surrogate Biomarker of Ischemic Stroke Recovery in Patients With Supportive Treatment.,https://www.ncbi.nlm.nih.gov/pubmed/30853932,Frontiers in neurology,2019 03 29,"Background: Amide proton transfer (APT) MR imaging has shown great potential in the evaluation of stroke severity because of its sensitivity to acid environments. However, this promising MRI technique has not been used to assess treatment efficacy with regard to stroke recovery. Purpose: To assess the therapeutic effect of supportive treatment in ischemic stroke patients using the pH-sensitive APT MRI technique. Material and Methods: Forty-three ischemic stroke patients at an early stage were recruited and scanned with conventional and APT MRI sequences at 3T before treatment. After treatment, 26 patients underwent a follow-up MRI scan (one to three times on different days). The magnetization-transfer-ratio asymmetry at 3.5 ppm, usually called the APT-weighted (APTW) signal, was measured. The APTW signal changes following treatment were analyzed. Results: Baseline APTW signal intensities in the infarcted lesions inversely correlated with baseline stroke severity. Lesion APTW values gradually increased with time in 24 cases (92.3%) with a follow-up MRI scan, showing clinical symptom improvements. Two cases (7.7%) showed further decreased APTW signal in the follow-up scan, accompanied by clinical symptom aggravation. Compared to the baseline, significant APTW signal increases were found for all post-treatment patients (efficacious), whether based on post-treatment or on stroke onset times. The increase in APTW signal in the ischemic stroke lesion after treatment was associated with an improvement in clinical symptoms. Conclusion: The APTW signal would be a useful imaging biomarker by which to assess the therapeutic efficacy of ischemic stroke treatment.",Astrocyte Mechano-Activation by High-Rate Overpressure Involves Alterations in Structural and Junctional Proteins.,https://www.ncbi.nlm.nih.gov/pubmed/30853931,Frontiers in neurology,2019 03 29,"Primary blast neurotrauma represents a unique injury paradigm characterized by high-rate overpressure effects on brain tissue. One major hallmark of blast neurotrauma is glial reactivity, notably prolonged astrocyte activation. This cellular response has been mainly defined in primary blast neurotrauma by increased intermediate filament expression. Because the intermediate filament networks physically interface with transmembrane proteins for junctional support, it was hypothesized that cell junction regulation is altered in the reactive phenotype as well. This would have implications for downstream transcriptional regulation via signal transduction pathways like nuclear factor kappa-light-chain-enhancer of activated B cells (NF-κB). Therefore, a custom high-rate overpressure simulator was built for in vitro testing using mechanical conditions based on intracranial pressure measurements in a rat model of blast neurotrauma. Primary rat astrocytes were exposed to isolated high-rate mechanical stimulation to study cell junction dynamics in relation to their mechano-activation. First, a time course for ""classical"" features of reactivity was devised by evaluation of glial fibrillary acidic protein (GFAP) and proliferating cell nuclear antigen (PCNA) expression. This was followed by gene and protein expression for both gap junction (connexins) and anchoring junction proteins (integrins and cadherins). Signal transduction analysis was carried out by nuclear localization of two molecules, NF-κB p65 and mitogen-activated protein kinase (MAPK) p38. Results indicated significant increases in connexin-43 expression and PCNA first at 24 h post-overpressure (p < 0.05), followed by structural reactivity (via increased GFAP, p < 0.05) corresponding to increased anchoring junction dynamics at 48 h post-overpressure (p < 0.05). Moreover, increased phosphorylation of focal adhesion kinase (FAK) was observed in addition to increased nuclear localization of both p65 and p38 (p < 0.05) during the period of structural reactivity. To evaluate the transcriptional activity of p65 in the nucleus, electrophoretic mobility shift assay was conducted for a binding site on the promoter region for intracellular adhesion molecule-1 (ICAM-1), an antagonist of tight junctions. A significant increase in the interaction of nuclear proteins with the NF-κB site on the ICAM-1 corresponded to increased gene and protein expression of ICAM-1 (p < 0.05). Altogether, these results indicate multiple targets and corresponding signaling pathways which involve cell junction dynamics in the mechano-activation of astrocytes following high-rate overpressure.",Dynamic Trajectory of Long-Term Cognitive Improvement Up to 10 Years in Young Community-Dwelling Stroke Survivors: A Cohort Study.,https://www.ncbi.nlm.nih.gov/pubmed/30853930,Frontiers in neurology,2019 03 29,"Background and objective: The trajectories of long-term and domain-specific cognitive alterations over a decade after stroke are largely unknown. This study aims to investigate the dynamic alterations of domain-specific cognitive performance among young stroke survivors over 10 years after their first stroke. Methods: A prospective cohort study was carried out on 38 young stroke survivors (aged 18-65 at stroke onset) living in the community at 10 years after their first stroke. The cognitive outcomes were assessed repeatedly at 1 week, 7 months, and 10 years after their first stroke on the sub-domains: process speed (Symbol search and Coding from WAIS, TMT-A), visual attention (Bells test), visuospatial function (Block design from WAIS, RCFT), executive function (TMT-B, verbal fluency), verbal function [Letter fluency (FAS) from D-KEFS and CD], working memory (Digit Span from WAIS), immediate memory (RCFT and CD), and delayed memory (RCFT and CD). Global cognition was evaluated with Mini mental state examination at the two later time-points. Results: We found a delayed significant improvement of working memory with total recovery 10 years after participants' stroke. Visuospatial function recovered already at 7 months and remained stable at 10-year follow-up. Process speed demonstrated a significant decrease at 10 years compared to 7 months after stroke onset, a decrease which could be compensated by enhancements of other cognitive domains. No further deterioration was found in verbal function, immediate-, and delayed memory, and executive function during 10-year follow-up. Global cognition improved by on average two points between 7 months and 10 years. Education level and fatigue showed low to moderate positive correlations with cognitive improvements. Conclusions: The concordance of cognitive improvements between domain-specific and global cognitions strongly suggest that some young stroke survivors do improve their cognitive outcome over a 10-year period following their first stroke. This finding fills a gap of knowledge with respect to the dynamic trajectory of post-stroke cognition, with important implications in clinical practice.","Changes in United States Latino/a High School Students' Science Motivational Beliefs: Within Group Differences Across Science Subjects, Gender, Immigrant Status, and Perceived Support.",https://www.ncbi.nlm.nih.gov/pubmed/30853929,Frontiers in psychology,2019 03 29,"Science motivational beliefs are crucial for STEM (science, technology, engineering, and math) performance and persistence, but these beliefs typically decline during high school. We expanded the literature on adolescents' science motivational beliefs by examining: (1) changes in motivational beliefs in three specific science subjects, (2) how gender, immigrant generation status, and perceived support from key social agents predicted differences in adolescents' science motivational beliefs, and (3) these processes among Latino/as in the United States, whose underrepresentation in STEM is understudied. We used hierarchical linear modeling to estimate the changes in 104 (40% female) Latino/a high school students' physics, chemistry, and biology motivational beliefs from 9th to 11th grade. Subject-specific ability self-concept, interest, and utility were regressed on gender, immigrant generation status, and perceived science support while controlling for family income, parent education, and adolescents' school. Adolescents' utility declined from 9th to 11th grade whereas their interest remained stable for all three science subjects. Adolescents' ability self-concept increased for biology, decreased for physics, but remained stable for chemistry. Gender differences in adolescents' motivational beliefs at 9th grade only emerged for physics utility as well as physics and chemistry interest; yet, there were no gender differences in how adolescents' science motivational beliefs changed over time. Contrary to expectations, immigrant generation status was not significantly associated with adolescents' science motivational beliefs at 9th grade or in terms of how they changed over time. Adolescents who perceived higher science support generally had higher motivational beliefs in 9th grade, but did not differ on their rate of change. Our findings highlight the need to examine specific science subjects, and that typical gender differences in adolescents' motivational beliefs discussed in the literature may not generalize to all racial and ethnic groups.",Self-Compassion and Subjective Well-Being Mediate the Impact of Mindfulness on Balanced Time Perspective in Chinese College Students.,https://www.ncbi.nlm.nih.gov/pubmed/30853928,Frontiers in psychology,2019 03 29,"Balanced time perspective is associated with optimal social functioning and provides psychological benefits in times of stress. Previous studies have found that mindfulness is positively associated with balanced time perspective and might promote it. However, the mechanism through which mindfulness affects balanced time perspective remains unexplored. The purpose of the present study was to investigate the mediating role of self-compassion and subjective well-being in the relationship between mindfulness and balanced time perspective. A total of 754 Chinese college students, aged 17-27 years, completed the Chinese versions of the Five-Facet Mindfulness Questionnaire, Self-Compassion Scale, Subjective Well-Being Scale, and Zimbardo Time Perspective Inventory. There were significant positive correlations between mindfulness, self-compassion, subjective well-being, and balanced time perspective. Structural equation modeling indicated that in addition to the direct influence of mindfulness on balanced time perspective, self-compassion and subjective well-being played a partial mediating role. On the basis of these findings, we conclude that mindfulness has an important positive influence on balanced time perspective, and highlights the crucial role of the self-compassion in cultivating a balanced time perspective. Limitations of the present study are also discussed.",Real-Time Neural Signals of Disorder and Order Perception.,https://www.ncbi.nlm.nih.gov/pubmed/30853927,Frontiers in psychology,2019 03 29,"Order and disorder are prevalent in everyday life, yet little is known about the neural real-time processing that occurs during the perception of disorder relative to order. In the present study, from a cognitive perspective, by adopting the ERP method, we aimed to examine the elicited real-time neural signals of disorder and order perception when participants processed physical environmental and basic visual disorder and order pictures in an irrelevant red or green rectangle detection task, and we attempted to test the hypothesis of cognitive disfluency in disorder perception. Generally, we observed that at each measured time interval, the ERPs elicited by order stimuli were more positive (less negative) in amplitude than those elicited by disorder stimuli at the frontal electrodes (represented by F7/F8, FT7/FT8, Fz, and FCz), whereas at the posterior electrodes (represented by P7/P8, PO7/PO8, Pz, and POz), the opposite was true. These data reveal for the first time the neural underpinnings of disorder and order perception, extending our understanding of the nature of disorder and order. This study also contributes to the cognitive fluency literature and indirectly expands the research on disorder and order stimuli in cognitive fluency.",Different Features of Bilingualism in Relation to Executive Functioning.,https://www.ncbi.nlm.nih.gov/pubmed/30853926,Frontiers in psychology,2019 03 29,"The notion that the long-term practice of managing two languages is beneficial for the executive control system is an ongoing debate. Criticism have been raised that studies demonstrating a bilingual advantage often suffer from small sample sizes, and do not control for fluid intelligence as a possible confound. Taking those suggested factors into account, focusing on older bilingual age groups and investigating the potential effects of linguistic distances, this study aimed to improve the interpretations of the bilinguals' advantages. Measures of inhibition (Flanker, Stroop, Simon task) and switching (Number-letter, Color-Shape, Local-global task) were collected in participants in the ages 50-75 years (n = 193). Despite a large study sample, results did not support any beneficial effects related to improve processing costs in executive functioning. Sub-analyses of the two different language groups (Swedish-Finnish / Swedish-English) intended to investigate the effect of linguistic distances did not change this outcome. Future studies exploring the potential long-term term effects of bilingualism would benefit from identifying tests of cognitive control with greater ecological validity and include other measures of cognitive functioning. Language learning interventions may also be a promising tool for future research."

However, it is unknown whether these receptors are able to modulate morphine antinociception and tolerance during inflammatory pain. Here we used a mouse model to test the modulation of morphine effects by the selective sigma-1 antagonist S1RA (MR309), by determining its effect on inflammatory tactile allodynia (von Frey filaments) and on grip strength deficits induced by joint inflammation (a measure of pain-induced functional disability), and compared the results with those for nociceptive heat pain recorded with the unilateral hot plate (55°C) test. The subcutaneous (s.c.) administration of morphine induced antinociceptive effects to heat stimuli, and restored mechanical threshold and grip strength in mice with periarticular inflammation induced by Complete Freund's Adjuvant. S1RA (80 mg/kg, s.c.) administered alone did not induce any effect on nociceptive heat pain or inflammatory allodynia, but was able to partially reverse grip strength deficits. The association of S1RA with morphine, at doses inducing little or no analgesic-like effects when administered alone, resulted in a marked antinociceptive effect to heat stimuli and complete reversion of inflammatory tactile allodynia. However, S1RA administration did not increase the effect of morphine on grip strength deficits induced by joint inflammation. When S1RA (80 mg/kg, s.c.) was administered to morphine-tolerant animals, it rescued the analgesic-like effects of this opioid in all three pain measures. However, when S1RA was repeatedly given during the induction of morphine tolerance (and not on the day of behavioral evaluation) it failed to affect tolerance to the effects of morphine on nociceptive heat pain or inflammatory allodynia, but completely preserved the effects of this opioid on grip strength deficits. These effects of S1RA on morphine tolerance cannot be explained by pharmacokinetic interactions, given that the administration of S1RA did not modify concentrations of morphine or morphine-3-glucuronide (a major morphine metabolite) in morphine-tolerant animals in plasma or brain tissue. We conclude that sigma-1 receptors play a pivotal role in the control of morphine analgesia and tolerance in nociceptive and inflammatory pain, although in a manner dependent on the type of painful stimulus explored.",Cycling Quiescence in Temozolomide Resistant Glioblastoma Cells Is Partly Explained by microRNA-93 and -193-Mediated Decrease of Cyclin D.,https://www.ncbi.nlm.nih.gov/pubmed/30853911,Frontiers in pharmacology,2019 03 29,"Glioblastoma multiforme (GBM) is a fatal malignancy of the central nervous system, commonly associated with chemoresistance.

These studies reported on mismatch repair gene upregulation, ABC-targeted drug efflux, and cell cycle alterations. The mechanism by which TMZ induces cell cycle arrest has not been well-established. TMZ-resistant GBM cells have been linked to microRNA (miRNA) and exosomes. A cell cycle miRNA array identified distinct miRNAs only in exosomes from TMZ-resistant GBM cell lines and primary spheres. We narrowed the miRs to miR-93 and -193 and showed in computational analyses that they could target Cyclin D1. Since Cyclin D1 is a major regulator of cell cycle progression, we performed cause-effect studies and showed a blunting effects of miR-93 and -193 in Cyclin D1 expression. These two miRs also decreased cell cycling quiescence and induced resistance to TMZ. Taken together, our data provide a mechanism by which GBM cells can exhibit TMZ-induced resistance through miRNA targeting of Cyclin D1. The data provide a number of therapeutic approaches to reverse chemoresistance at the miRNA, exosomal and cell cycle points.",Chronic Pain and Chronic Opioid Use After Intensive Care Discharge - Is It Time to Change Practice?,https://www.ncbi.nlm.nih.gov/pubmed/30853909,Frontiers in pharmacology,2019 03 29,"Almost half of patients treated on intensive care unit (ICU) experience moderate to severe pain. Managing pain in the critically ill patient is challenging, as their pain is complex with multiple causes. Pharmacological treatment often focuses on opioids, and over a prolonged admission this can represent high cumulative doses which risk opioid dependence at discharge. Despite analgesia the incidence of chronic pain after treatment on ICU is high ranging from 33-73%. Measures need to be taken to prevent the transition from acute to chronic pain, whilst avoiding opioid overuse. This narrative review discusses preventive measures for the development of chronic pain in ICU patients. It considers a number of strategies that can be employed including non-opioid analgesics, regional analgesia, and non-pharmacological methods. We reason that individualized pain management plans should become the cornerstone for critically ill patients to facilitate physical and psychological well being after discharge from critical care and hospital.","Learning and Acting in Peripersonal Space: Moving, Reaching, and Grasping.",https://www.ncbi.nlm.nih.gov/pubmed/30853907,Frontiers in neurorobotics,2019 03 29,"The young infant explores its body, its sensorimotor system, and the immediately accessible parts of its environment, over the course of a few months creating a model of peripersonal space useful for reaching and grasping objects around it. Drawing on constraints from the empirical literature on infant behavior, we present a preliminary computational model of this learning process, implemented and evaluated on a physical robot. The learning agent explores the relationship between the configuration space of the arm, sensing joint angles through proprioception, and its visual perceptions of the hand and grippers. The resulting knowledge is represented as the peripersonal space (PPS) graph, where nodes represent states of the arm, edges represent safe movements, and paths represent safe trajectories from one pose to another. In our model, the learning process is driven by a form of intrinsic motivation. When repeatedly performing an action, the agent learns the typical result, but also detects unusual outcomes, and is motivated to learn how to make those unusual results reliable. Arm motions typically leave the static background unchanged, but occasionally bump an object, changing its static position. The reach action is learned as a reliable way to bump and move a specified object in the environment. Similarly, once a reliable reach action is learned, it typically makes a quasi-static change in the environment, bumping an object from one static position to another. The unusual outcome is that the object is accidentally grasped (thanks to the innate Palmar reflex), and thereafter moves dynamically with the hand. Learning to make grasping reliable is more complex than for reaching, but we demonstrate significant progress. Our current results are steps toward autonomous sensorimotor learning of motion, reaching, and grasping in peripersonal space, based on unguided exploration and intrinsic motivation.",Causally Investigating Cortical Dynamics and Signal Processing by Targeting Natural System Attractors With Precisely Timed (Electrical) Stimulation.,https://www.ncbi.nlm.nih.gov/pubmed/30853906,Frontiers in computational neuroscience,2019 03 29,"Electrical stimulation is a promising tool for interacting with neuronal dynamics to identify neural mechanisms that underlie cognitive function. Since effects of a single short stimulation pulse typically vary greatly and depend on the current network state, many experimental paradigms have rather resorted to continuous or periodic stimulation in order to establish and maintain a desired effect. However, such an approach explicitly leads to forced and ""unnatural"" brain activity. Further, continuous stimulation can make it hard to parse the recorded activity and separate neural signal from stimulation artifacts. In this study we propose an alternate strategy: by monitoring a system in realtime, we use the existing preferred states or attractors of the network and apply short and precise pulses in order to switch between those states. When pushed into one of its attractors, one can use the natural tendency of the system to remain in such a state to prolong the effect of a stimulation pulse, opening a larger window of opportunity to observe the consequences on cognitive processing. To elaborate on this idea, we consider flexible information routing in the visual cortex as a prototypical example. When processing a stimulus, neural populations in the visual cortex have been found to engage in synchronized gamma activity. In this context, selective signal routing is achieved by changing the relative phase between oscillatory activity in sending and receiving populations (communication through coherence, CTC). In order to explore how perturbations interact with CTC, we investigate a network of interneuronal gamma (ING) oscillators composed of integrate-and-fire neurons exhibiting similar synchronization and signal routing phenomena. We develop a closed-loop stimulation paradigm based on the phase-response characteristics of the network and demonstrate its ability to establish desired synchronization states. By measuring information content throughout the model, we evaluate the effect of signal contamination caused by the stimulation in relation to the magnitude of the injected pulses and intrinsic noise in the system. Finally, we demonstrate that, up to a critical noise level, precisely timed perturbations can be used to artificially induce the effect of attention by selectively routing visual signals to higher cortical areas.",Classification of Movement Intention Using Independent Components of Premovement EEG.,https://www.ncbi.nlm.nih.gov/pubmed/30853905,Frontiers in human neuroscience,2019 03 29,"Many previous studies on brain-machine interfaces (BMIs) have focused on electroencephalography (EEG) signals elicited during motor-command execution to generate device commands. However, exploiting pre-execution brain activity related to movement intention could improve the practical applicability of BMIs. Therefore, in this study we investigated whether EEG signals occurring before movement execution could be used to classify movement intention. Six subjects performed reaching tasks that required them to move a cursor to one of four targets distributed horizontally and vertically from the center. Using independent components of EEG acquired during a premovement phase, two-class classifications were performed for left vs. right trials and top vs. bottom trials using a support vector machine. Instructions were presented visually (test) and aurally (condition). In the test condition, accuracy for a single window was about 75%, and it increased to 85% in classification using two windows. In the control condition, accuracy for a single window was about 73%, and it increased to 80% in classification using two windows. Classification results showed that a combination of two windows from different time intervals during the premovement phase improved classification performance in the both conditions compared to a single window classification. By categorizing the independent components according to spatial pattern, we found that information depending on the modality can improve classification performance. We confirmed that EEG signals occurring during movement preparation can be used to control a BMI.",The Aim Justifies the Means-Differences Among Musical and Nonmusical Means of Relaxation or Activation Induction in Daily Life.,https://www.ncbi.nlm.nih.gov/pubmed/30853904,Frontiers in human neuroscience,2019 03 29,"Music is an effective means of stress-reduction. However, to date there has been no systematic comparison between musical and language-based means of stress reduction in an ambulatory setting. Furthermore, although the aim for listening to music appears to play a role in its effect, this has not yet been investigated thoroughly. We compared musical means, language-based means like guided relaxation or self-enhancement exercises, and a combination of both with respect to their potential to reduce perceived stress. Furthermore, we investigated whether the aim one wants to achieve by listening to these means had an impact on their effect. We tested 64 participants (age: M = 40.09 years; 18 female) for 3-10 days during their everyday life using an app containing three means: musical means, language-based means, and a combination of both. For the music and the combination conditions participants were asked to select an aim: relaxation or activation. We measured perceived stress, relaxation, activation, and electrical skin resistance (ESR) as a marker of sympathetic nervous system (SNS) activity before and after using the app. Participants were instructed to use the app as often as desired. Overall, perceived stress was reduced after using the app, while perceived relaxation and activation were increased. There were no differences between the three means regarding their effect on perceived stress and relaxation, but music led to a greater increase in ESR and perceived activation compared to the other means. There was a decrease in ESR only for music. Moreover, perceived stress was reduced and perceived relaxation was increased to greater extent if the aim ""relaxation"" had been selected. Perceived activation, however, showed a larger increase if the aim had been ""activation,"" which was even more marked in the case of music listening. Our results indicate that all three means reduced perceived stress and promoted feelings of relaxation and activation. For enhancing feelings of activation music seems to be more effective than the other means, which was reflected in increased SNS activity as well. Furthermore, the choice of an aim plays an important role for the reduction of stress, and promotion of relaxation and activation.",A Preliminary Study Investigating Maternal Neurocognitive Mechanisms Underlying a Child-Supportive Parenting Intervention.,https://www.ncbi.nlm.nih.gov/pubmed/30853903,Frontiers in behavioral neuroscience,2019 03 29,"Although interventions that promote child-supportive parenting for children have been shown to positively impact caregiving behaviors as well as child behavioral and neurobiological functioning, less is known about which aspects of maternal brain functioning are affected by such interventions. In the present study, we conducted a preliminary evaluation of the impact of the Filming Interactions to Nurture Development (FIND) video coaching program on mothers with at least one child age four or younger. We employed a waitlist control design with pre-post data. Compared to mothers in the control condition (n = 16), mothers who received FIND (n = 16) showed changes in neural measures of inhibitory control and behavioral measures of parenting self-evaluation during a series of functional neuroimaging tasks. Specifically, we found a group by time interaction in clusters in the left inferior frontal gyrus (IFG) and insula for the Correct Stop > Correct Go contrast of the stop signal task (SST), where FIND increased brain activity associated with inhibitory control compared to mothers in the control condition; and FIND increased mothers' endorsement of child-supportive parenting traits in the parenting self-evaluation task (PSET). Exploratory moderators, study limitations, and the implications of these findings for strength-based parenting programs are discussed.",Resting State Functional Connectivity of the Rat Claustrum.,https://www.ncbi.nlm.nih.gov/pubmed/30853902,Frontiers in neuroanatomy,2019 06 10,"The claustrum is structurally connected with many cortical areas.A major hurdle standing in the way of understanding claustrum function is the difficulty in assessing the global functional connectivity (FC) of this structure. The primary issues lie in the inability to isolate claustrum signal from the adjacent insular cortex (Ins), caudate/putamen (CPu), and endopiriform nucleus (Endo). To address this issue, we used (7T) fMRI in the rat and describe a novel analytic method to study claustrum without signal contamination from the surrounding structures. Using this approach, we acquired claustrum signal distinct from Ins, CPu, and Endo, and used this claustrum signal to determine whole brain resting state functional connectivity (RSFC). Claustrum RSFC was distinct from the adjacent structures and displayed extensive connections with sensory cortices and the cingulate cortex, consistent with known structural connectivity of the claustrum. These results suggest fMRI and improved analysis can be combined to accurately assay claustrum function.",Compensatory Neural Responses to Cognitive Fatigue in Young and Older Adults.,https://www.ncbi.nlm.nih.gov/pubmed/30853901,Frontiers in neural circuits,2019 03 29,"Prolonged performance of a demanding cognitive task induces cognitive fatigue. We examined the behavioral and neural responses to fatigue-induced cognitive impairments in young and older adults. Particular emphasis was placed on whether the brain exhibited compensatory neural activity in response to cognitive fatigue. High-density EEG was recorded from a young (n = 16; 18-33 years of age) and an older (n = 18; 60-87 years of age) cohort who performed a Stroop task continuously for ∼2 h with no breaks. In the young cohort, behavioral performance declined as the experiment progressed, reflecting the deleterious effects of cognitive fatigue. Neurophysiologically, in addition to declining neural activity as cognitive fatigue developed, there is also evidence of region- and time-specific increase in neural activity, suggesting neural compensation. The compensatory activities followed patterns paralleling that of posterior-anterior shift in aging (PASA) and early to late shift in aging (ELSA) observed in cognitive aging and helped to moderate fatigue-induced behavioral deterioration. In the older cohort, behavioral performance did not decline as the experiment progressed, and neural activity either declined or stayed unchanged, showing no evidence of neural compensation, in contrast to the young. These results suggest that young and older adults coped with cognitive fatigue differently by exhibiting differential responses as a function of time-on-task at both the behavioral level and the neural level."

Defects in the development, differentiation and migration of NCCs give rise to a class of syndromes and diseases that are known as neurocristopathies. NCC development has historically been studied in a variety of animal models, including xenopus, chick and mouse. In the recent years, there have been efforts to study NCC development and disease in human specific models, with protocols being established to derive NCCs from human pluripotent stem cells (hPSCs), and to further differentiate these NCCs to neural, mesenchymal and other lineages. These in vitro differentiation platforms are a valuable tool to gain a better understanding of the molecular mechanisms involved in human neural crest development. The use of induced pluripotent stem cells (iPSCs) derived from patients afflicted with neurocristopathies has also enabled the study of defective human NCC development using these in vitro platforms. Here, we review the various in vitro strategies that have been used to derive NCCs from hPSCs and to specify NCCs into cranial, trunk, and vagal subpopulations and their derivatives. We will also discuss the potential applications of these human specific NCC platforms, including the use of iPSCs for disease modeling and the potential of NCCs for future regenerative applications.",20 Years of Secretagogin: Exocytosis and Beyond.,https://www.ncbi.nlm.nih.gov/pubmed/30853888,Frontiers in molecular neuroscience,2019 03 29,"Calcium is one of the most important signaling factors in mammalian cells. Specific temporal and spatial calcium signals underlie fundamental processes such as cell growth, development, circadian rhythms, neurotransmission, hormonal actions and apoptosis. In order to translate calcium signals into cellular processes a vast number of proteins bind this ion with affinities from the nanomolar to millimolar range. Using classical biochemical methods an impressing number of calcium binding proteins (CBPs) have been discovered since the late 1960s, some of which are expressed ubiquitously, others are more restricted to specific cell types. In the nervous system expression patterns of different CBPs have been used to discern different neuronal cell populations, especially before advanced methods like single-cell transcriptomics and activity recording were available to define neuronal identity. However, understanding CBPs and their interacting proteins is still of central interest. The post-genomic era has coined the term ""calciomics,"" to describe a whole new research field, that engages in the identification and characterization of CBPs and their interactome. Secretagogin is a CBP, that was discovered 20 years ago in the pancreas. Consecutively it was found also in other organs including the nervous system, with characteristic expression patterns mostly forming cell clusters. Its regional expression and subcellular location together with the identification of protein interaction partners implicated, that secretagogin has a central role in hormone secretion. Meanwhile, with the help of modern proteomics a large number of actual and putative interacting proteins has been identified, that allow to anticipate a much more complex role of secretagogin in developing and adult neuronal cells. Here, we review recent findings that appear like puzzle stones of a greater picture.",Impaired Cognitive Function and Altered Hippocampal Synaptic Plasticity in Mice Lacking Dermatan Sulfotransferase Chst14/D4st1.,https://www.ncbi.nlm.nih.gov/pubmed/30853887,Frontiers in molecular neuroscience,2019 03 29,"Chondroitin sulfate (CS) and dermatan sulfate (DS) proteoglycans (PGs) are major extracellular matrix (ECM) components of the central nervous system (CNS). A large body of evidence has shown that CSPGs/DSPGs play critical roles in neuronal growth, axon guidance, and plasticity in the developing and mature CNS. It has been proposed that these PGs exert their function through specific interaction of CS/DS chains with its binding partners in a manner that depends on the sulfation patterns of CS/DS. It has been reported that dermatan 4-O-sulfotransferase-1 (Chst14/D4st1) specific for DS, but not chondroitin 4-O-sulfotransferase-1 (Chst11/C4st1) specific for CS, regulates proliferation and neurogenesis of neural stem cells (NSCs), indicating that CS and DS play distinct roles in the self-renewal and differentiation of NSCs. However, it remains unknown whether specific sulfation profiles of DS has any effect on CNS plasticity. In the present study, Chst14/D4st1-deficient (Chst14-/-) mice was employed to investigate the involvement of DS in synaptic plasticity. First, behavior study using Morris Water Maze (MWM) showed that the spatial learning and memory of Chst14-/- mice was impaired when compared to their wild type (WT) littermates. Corroborating the behavior result, long-term potentiation (LTP) at the hippocampal CA3-CA1 connection was reduced in Chst14-/- mice compared to the WT mice. Finally, the protein levels of N-Methyl-D-aspartate (NMDA) receptor, α-amino-3-hydroxy-5-methyl-4-isoxazolepropionic acid (AMPA) receptor, postsynaptic density 95 (PSD95), growth associated protein 43 (GAP-43), synaptophysin (SYN) and N-ethylmaleimide sensitive factor (NSF) which are important in synaptic plasticity were examined and Chst14/D4st1 deficiency was shown to significantly reduce the expression of these proteins in the hippocampus. Further studies revealed that Akt/mammalian target rapamycin (mTOR) pathway proteins, including protein kinase B (p-Akt), p-mTOR and p-S6, were significantly lower in Chst14-/- mice, which might contribute to the decreased protein expression. Together, this study reveals that specific sulfation of DS is critical in synaptic plasticity of the hippocampus and learning and memory, which might be associated with the changes in the expression of glutamate receptors and other synaptic proteins though Akt/mTOR pathway.","Amyloid β Induces Early Changes in the Ribosomal Machinery, Cytoskeletal Organization and Oxidative Phosphorylation in Retinal Photoreceptor Cells.",https://www.ncbi.nlm.nih.gov/pubmed/30853886,Frontiers in molecular neuroscience,2019 03 29,"Amyloid β (Aβ) accumulation and its aggregation is characteristic molecular feature of the development of Alzheimer's disease (AD). More recently, Aβ has been suggested to be associated with retinal pathology associated with AD, glaucoma and drusen deposits in age related macular degeneration (AMD). In this study, we investigated the proteins and biochemical networks that are affected by Aβ in the 661 W photoreceptor cells in culture. Time and dose dependent effects of Aβ on the photoreceptor cells were determined utilizing tandem mass tag (TMT) labeling-based quantitative mass-spectrometric approach. Bioinformatic analysis of the data revealed concentration and time dependent effects of the Aβ peptide stimulation on various key biochemical pathways that might be involved in mediating the toxicity effects of the peptide. We identified increased Tau phosphorylation, GSK3β dysregulation and reduced cell viability in cells treated with Aβ in a dose and time dependent manner. This study has delineated for the first-time molecular networks in photoreceptor cells that are impacted early upon Aβ treatment and contrasted the findings with a longer-term treatment effect. Proteins associated with ribosomal machinery homeostasis, mitochondrial function and cytoskeletal organization were affected in the initial stages of Aβ exposure, which may provide key insights into AD effects on the photoreceptors and specific molecular changes induced by Aβ peptide.",Neurocalcin Delta Knockout Impairs Adult Neurogenesis Whereas Half Reduction Is Not Pathological.,https://www.ncbi.nlm.nih.gov/pubmed/30853885,Frontiers in molecular neuroscience,2019 03 29,"Neurocalcin delta (NCALD) is a brain-enriched neuronal calcium sensor and its reduction acts protective against spinal muscular atrophy (SMA). However, the physiological function of NCALD and implications of NCALD reduction are still elusive. Here, we analyzed the ubiquitous Ncald knockout in homozygous (NcaldKO/KO) and heterozygous (NcaldKO/WT) mice to unravel the physiological role of NCALD in the brain and to study whether 50% NCALD reduction is a safe option for SMA therapy. We found that NcaldKO/KO but not NcaldKO/WT mice exhibit significant changes in the hippocampal morphology, likely due to impaired generation and migration of newborn neurons in the dentate gyrus (DG). To understand the mechanism behind, we studied the NCALD interactome and identified mitogen-activated protein kinase kinase kinase 10 (MAP3K10) as a novel NCALD interacting partner. MAP3K10 is an upstream activating kinase of c-Jun N-terminal kinase (JNK), which regulates adult neurogenesis. Strikingly, the JNK activation was significantly upregulated in the NcaldKO/KO brains. Contrary, neither adult neurogenesis nor JNK activation were altered by heterozygous Ncald deletion. Taken together, our study identifies a novel link between NCALD and adult neurogenesis in the hippocampus, possibly via a MAP3K10-JNK pathway and emphasizes the safety of using NCALD reduction as a therapeutic option for SMA.",Effects of Perinatal Exposure to Ketamine on the Developing Brain.,https://www.ncbi.nlm.nih.gov/pubmed/30853884,Frontiers in neuroscience,2019 03 29,"Initially used as an analgesic and anesthetic, ketamine has unfortunately been abused as a popular recreational party drug due to its psychotropic effects. Over the last decade, ketamine has also emerged as an effective rapid-onset anti-depressant. The increasingly widespread use and misuse of the drug in infants and pregnant women has posed a concern about the neurotoxicity of ketamine to the immature brains of developing fetuses and children. In this review, we summarize recent research findings on major possible mechanisms of perinatal ketamine-induced neurotoxicity. We also briefly summarize the neuroprotective effects of ketamine in the presence of noxious stimuli. Future actions include implementation of more drug abuse education and prevention campaigns to raise the public's awareness of the harmful effects of ketamine abuse; further investigations to justify the clinical use of ketamine as analgesic, anesthetic and anti-depressant; and further studies to develop alternatives to ketamine or treatments that can alleviate the detrimental effects of ketamine use, especially in infants and pregnant women.",Cell Type-Specific Human APP Transgene Expression by Hippocampal Interneurons in the Tg2576 Mouse Model of Alzheimer's Disease.,https://www.ncbi.nlm.nih.gov/pubmed/30853883,Frontiers in neuroscience,2019 03 29,"Amyloid precursor protein (APP) transgenic animal models of Alzheimer's disease have become versatile tools for basic and translational research. However, there is great heterogeneity of histological, biochemical, and functional data between transgenic mouse lines, which might be due to different transgene expression patterns. Here, the expression of human APP (hAPP) by GABAergic hippocampal interneurons immunoreactive for the calcium binding proteins parvalbumin, calbindin, calretinin, and for the peptide hormone somatostatin was analyzed in Tg2576 mice by double immunofluorescent microscopy. Overall, there was no GABAergic interneuron subpopulation that did not express the transgene. On the other hand, in no case all neurons of such a subpopulation expressed hAPP. In dentate gyrus molecular layer and in stratum lacunosum moleculare less than 10% of hAPP-positive interneurons co-express any of these interneuron markers, whereas in stratum oriens hAPP-expressing neurons frequently co-express these interneuron markers to different proportions. We conclude that these neurons differentially contribute to deficits in young Tg2576 mice before the onset of Abeta plaque pathology. The detailed analysis of distinct brain region and neuron type-specific APP transgene expression patterns is indispensable to understand particular pathological features and mouse line-specific differences in neuronal and systemic functions.",ProNGF and Neurodegeneration in Alzheimer's Disease.,https://www.ncbi.nlm.nih.gov/pubmed/30853882,Frontiers in neuroscience,2019 03 29,"Profound and early basal forebrain cholinergic neuron (BFCN) degeneration is a hallmark of Alzheimer's disease (AD). Loss of synapses between basal forebrain and hippocampal and cortical target tissue correlates highly with the degree of dementia and is thought to be a major contributor to memory loss. BFCNs depend for their survival, connectivity and function on the neurotrophin nerve growth factor (NGF) which is retrogradely transported from its sites of synthesis in the cortex and hippocampus. The form of NGF found in human brain is proNGF. ProNGF binds to the NGF receptors TrkA and p75NTR, but it binds more strongly to p75NTR and more weakly to TrkA than does mature NGF. This renders proNGF more sensitive to receptor balance than mature NGF. In the healthy brain, where BFCNs express both TrkA and p75NTR, proNGF is neurotrophic, activating TrkA-dependent signaling pathways such as MAPK and Akt-mTOR and eliciting cell survival and neurite outgrowth. However, if TrkA is lost or if p75NTR is increased, proNGF activates p75NTR-dependent apoptotic pathways such as JNK. This receptor sensitivity serves as a neurotrophic/apoptotic switch that eliminates BFCNs that cannot maintain TrkA/p75NTR balance and therefore synaptic connections with their targets. TrkA is increasingly lost in mild cognitive impairment (MCI) and AD. In addition, proNGF accumulates at BFCN terminals in cortex and hippocampus, reducing the amount of trophic factor that reaches BFCN cell bodies. The loss of TrkA and accumulation of proNGF occur early in MCI and correlate with cognitive impairment. Increased levels of proNGF and reduced levels of TrkA lead to BFCN neurodegeneration and eventual p75NTR-dependent apoptosis. In addition, in AD BFCNs suffer from reduced TrkA-dependent retrograde transport which reduces neurotrophic support. Thus, BFCNs are particularly vulnerable to AD due to their dependence upon retrograde trophic support from proNGF signaling and transport.",Prenatal Protein Malnutrition Produces Resistance to Distraction Similar to Noradrenergic Deafferentation of the Prelimbic Cortex in a Sustained Attention Task.,https://www.ncbi.nlm.nih.gov/pubmed/30853881,Frontiers in neuroscience,2019 03 29,"Exposure to malnutrition early in development increases likelihood of neuropsychiatric disorders, affective processing disorders, and attentional problems later in life. Many of these impairments are hypothesized to arise from impaired development of the prefrontal cortex. The current experiments examine the impact of prenatal malnutrition on the noradrenergic and cholinergic axons in the prefrontal cortex to determine if these changes contribute to the attentional deficits seen in prenatal protein malnourished rats (6% casein vs. 25% casein). Because prenatally malnourished animals had significant decreases in noradrenergic fibers in the prelimbic cortex with spared innervation in the anterior cingulate cortex and showed no changes in acetylcholine innervation of the prefrontal cortex, we compared deficits produced by malnutrition to those produced in adult rats by noradrenergic lesions of the prelimbic cortex. All animals were able to perform the baseline sustained attention task accurately. However, with the addition of visual distractors to the sustained attention task, animals that were prenatally malnourished and those that were noradrenergically lesioned showed cognitive rigidity, i.e., were less distractible than control animals. All groups showed similar changes in behavior when exposed to withholding reinforcement, suggesting specific attentional impairments rather than global difficulties in understanding response rules, bottom-up perceptual problems, or cognitive impairments secondary to dysfunction in sensitivity to reinforcement contingencies. These data suggest that prenatal protein malnutrition leads to deficits in noradrenergic innervation of the prelimbic cortex associated with cognitive rigidity.",Serotonergic Contributions to Human Brain Aggression Networks.,https://www.ncbi.nlm.nih.gov/pubmed/30853880,Frontiers in neuroscience,2019 03 29,"Aggressive behavior is associated with dysfunctional frontolimbic emotion regulation circuits. Recent findings suggest serotonin as a primary transmitter for prefrontal amygdala control. However, the association between serotonin levels, amygdala regulation, and aggression is still a matter of debate. Neurobehavioral models furthermore suggest a possible mediating influence of the monoamine oxidase A gene (MAOA) on this brain-behavior relationship, with carriers of low expressing allele varieties being a risk group for aggression. In the present study, we investigated the influence of brain serotonin modulation and MAOA genotype on functional amygdala connectivity during aggressive behavior. Modulation of serotonergic neurotransmission with acute tryptophan depletion (ATD) and placebo were administered in a double-blind, cross-over design in 38 healthy male participants. Aggressive behavior was modeled in a violent video game during simultaneous assessment of brain activation with functional magnetic resonance imaging (fMRI). Trait aggression was measured with the Buss-Perry Aggression Questionnaire (BP-AQ), and MAOA genotypes were assessed from blood samples. Voxel-wise functional connectivity with anatomically defined amygdala was calculated from the functional data. Tryptophan depletion with ATD reduced aggression-specific amygdala connectivity with bilateral supramarginal gyrus. Moreover, ATD impact was associated with trait aggression and MAOA genotype in prefrontal cortex regions. In summary, serotonergic corticolimbic projections contribute to aggressive behavior. Genotype-specific vulnerability of frontolimbic projections may underlie the elevated risk in low expressing allele carriers."

Many community detection methods for un-weighted networks have a theoretical basis in a null model. Communities discovered by these methods therefore have interpretations in terms of statistical significance. In this paper, we introduce a null for weighted networks called the continuous configuration model. First, we propose a community extraction algorithm for weighted networks which incorporates iterative hypothesis testing under the null. We prove a central limit theorem for edge-weight sums and asymptotic consistency of the algorithm under a weighted stochastic block model. We then incorporate the algorithm in a community detection method called CCME. To benchmark the method, we provide a simulation framework involving the null to plant ""background"" nodes in weighted networks with communities. We show that the empirical performance of CCME on these simulations is competitive with existing methods, particularly when overlapping communities and background nodes are present. To further validate the method, we present two real-world networks with potential background nodes and analyze them with CCME, yielding results that reveal macro-features of the corresponding systems.",Magmatic Response to Subduction Initiation: Part 1. Fore-arc Basalts of the Izu-Bonin Arc From IODP Expedition 352.,https://www.ncbi.nlm.nih.gov/pubmed/30853858,"Geochemistry, geophysics, geosystems : G(3)",2019 03 29,"The Izu-Bonin-Mariana (IBM) fore arc preserves igneous rock assemblages that formed during subduction initiation circa 52 Ma. International Ocean Discovery Program (IODP) Expedition 352 cored four sites in the fore arc near the Ogasawara Plateau in order to document the magmatic response to subduction initiation and the physical, petrologic, and chemical stratigraphy of a nascent subduction zone. Two of these sites (U1440 and U1441) are underlain by fore-arc basalt (FAB). FABs have mid-ocean ridge basalt (MORB)-like compositions, however, FAB are consistently lower in the high-field strength elements (TiO2, P2O5, Zr) and Ni compared to MORB, with Na2O at the low end of the MORB field and FeO* at the high end. Almost all FABs are light rare earth element depleted, with low total REE, and have low ratios of highly incompatible to less incompatible elements (Ti/V, Zr/Y, Ce/Yb, and Zr/Sm) relative to MORB. Chemostratigraphic trends in Hole U1440B are consistent with the uppermost lavas forming off axis, whereas the lower lavas formed beneath a spreading center axis. Axial magma of U1440B becomes more fractionated upsection; overlying off-axis magmas return to more primitive compositions. Melt models require a two-stage process, with early garnet field melts extracted prior to later spinel field melts, with up to 23% melting to form the most depleted compositions. Mantle equilibration temperatures are higher than normal MORB (1,400 °C-1,480 °C) at relatively low pressures (1-2 GPa), which may reflect an influence of the Manus plume during subduction initiation. Our data support previous models of FAB origin by decompression melting but imply a source more depleted than normal MORB source mantle.",Examining the Associations Between Performance Based and Ratings of Focused Attention in Toddlers: Are We Measuring the Same Constructs?,https://www.ncbi.nlm.nih.gov/pubmed/30853857,Infant and child development,2019 03 29,"The study examines the concurrent and longitudinal associations between ratings-based measures (parents, secondary caregivers, observers) and performance-based measures of focused attention in toddlers aged 30- (n = 147), 36- (n =127), and 42-months (n =107). Parents and secondary caregivers rated focused attention behaviors using the Children's Behavior Questionnaire (Rothbart et al., 2001), and observers rated toddlers' focused attention during a series of laboratory tasks using the Leiter-R Examiner Rating Scale (Roid & Miller, 1997). Toddlers' behaviors on three structured tasks (Token Sort, Toy Play, Lock Box) were used to assess their performance based focused attention in a laboratory setting. Correlations show that parent ratings are not related to observer and teacher ratings, or to the performance-based measures at all ages tested. Second, based on confirmatory factor analyses, a single factor explains the common variance between indicators when the parent ratings are not included in the models. The single factor shows measurement invariance between ages 36 and 42 months based on factor structure, relations of indicators to the factor, and factor scale over time. Third, indicators of focused attention at age 30 months do not seem to measure a common, coherent factor. Interpretations of similarities and differences between ratings and performance-based indicators of focused attention and the presence of a focused attention construct are discussed.",Feminism and Bourdieusian Social Theory in a Sexual Health Empowerment Project with Incarcerated and Recently Released Women.,https://www.ncbi.nlm.nih.gov/pubmed/30853856,Social theory & health : STH,2019 03 29,"Theory is often downplayed or omitted in the research and scholarly literature around public health interventions in carceral settings.

A cross-sectional survey was used to assess residents' walking behaviours, perceived neighbourhood characteristics, and perceived environmental barriers to walking in three types of neighbourhoods: traditional, early conventional suburban and late conventional suburban. Descriptive statistics, one-way analysis of variance (ANOVA) and regression analyses identified environmental factors correlated with walking. A total of 362 surveys were completed and returned by random adult members of the households contacted, for a 38.5% response rate. Perceived aesthetics are significantly associated with more frequent recreational and destination walking in this rural town. Higher perceived accessibility are associated with more frequent destination walking, and greater perceived social environment barriers to walking are associated with sedentary behaviour in the rural population studied. Of all factors related to a neighbourhood's built environment, the most important factor in promoting walking in rural towns is aesthetics. The relationships among accessibility, social environment and walking underscore the importance of community planning in incorporating mixed land uses, providing a connected pedestrian infrastructure and facilitating targeted social interventions to encourage more walking.",Binding thermodynamics of metal ions to HIV-1 ribonuclease H domain.,https://www.ncbi.nlm.nih.gov/pubmed/30853849,Journal of thermal analysis and calorimetry,2019 03 29,"Metal-protein interactions are not necessarily tight in many transient biological processes, such as cellular signaling, enzyme regulation, and molecular recognition. Here, we analyzed the binding thermodynamics and characterized the structural effect of divalent metal ions, i.e. Mn2+, Zn2+, and Mg2+, to the isolated ribonuclease H (RNH) of human immunodeficiency virus (HIV) using isothermal titration calorimetry (ITC) and circular dichroism. The binding thermodynamics of Mg2+ to RNH was determined using competition ITC experiments, and the binding affinity of Mg2+ was found to be about 40- and 400-times lower than those of Mn2+ and of Zn2+, respectively. The structural analysis showed that Mg2+ binding had little effect on the thermal stability of RNH, while Zn2+ and Mn2+ binding increased the stability. The thermodynamic characteristics of RNH metal binding, compared to intact HIV reverse transcriptase, and a possible mechanism of conformational change induced upon metal ion binding, in correlation with the structure-function relationship, are discussed."

Mathematical, physical, and engineering sciences",2019 03 29,"We introduce the idemetric property, which formalizes the idea that most nodes in a graph have similar distances between them, and which turns out to be quite standard amongst small-world network models. Modulo reasonable sparsity assumptions, we are then able to show that a strong form of idemetricity is actually equivalent to a very weak expander condition (PUMP). This provides a direct way of providing short proofs that small-world network models such as the Watts-Strogatz model are strongly idemetric (for a wide range of parameters), and also provides further evidence that being idemetric is a common property. We then consider how satisfaction of the idemetric property is relevant to algorithm design. For idemetric graphs, we observe, for example, that a single breadth-first search provides a solution to the all-pairs shortest paths problem, so long as one is prepared to accept paths which are of stretch close to 2 with high probability. Since we are able to show that Kleinberg's model is idemetric, these results contrast nicely with the well known negative results of Kleinberg concerning efficient decentralized algorithms for finding short paths: for precisely the same model as Kleinberg's negative results hold, we are able to show that very efficient (and decentralized) algorithms exist if one allows for reasonable preprocessing. For deterministic distributed routing algorithms we are also able to obtain results proving that less routing information is required for idemetric graphs than in the worst case in order to achieve stretch less than 3 with high probability: while Ω(n2) routing information is required in the worst case for stretch strictly less than 3 on almost all pairs, for idemetric graphs the total routing information required is O(nlog(n)).",Recent Progress of Polymeric Nanogels for Gene Delivery.,https://www.ncbi.nlm.nih.gov/pubmed/30853837,Current opinion in colloid & interface science,2019 03 29,"With its nearly unrestricted possibilities, gene therapy attracts more and more significance in modern-day research.

Within the scope of this article, recent progress in the employment of nanogels as gene delivery vectors is summarized and different examples of modified, stimuli-responsive, targeted and co-delivering nanogels are discussed in detail. Furthermore, major aspects of successful gene delivery are addressed and critically debated in regards to nanogels, giving insights into what progress has been made and which key issues still need to be further approached.","Four new species of Tremella (Tremellales, Basidiomycota) based on morphology and DNA sequence data.",https://www.ncbi.nlm.nih.gov/pubmed/30853836,MycoKeys,2019 03 29,"In the present study, a total of 33 Tremella specimens in China were collected and examined using molecular phylogenetic analysis based on a combined sequence dataset of the nuc rDNA internal transcribed spacer (ITS) region and nuc 28S rDNA D1/D2 domain in conjunction with the morphological characters.

We report here on a specimen of R.antipai collected in 2016 in the Bulgarian sector of the Danube main stream using a bottom drift net at a depth of 8 m. The species determination is supported by morphological examination including discriminant and cluster analyses in comparison with three syntypes and five non-type specimens of R.antipai, samples of the R.kesslerii species complex and R.vladykovi. Romanogobioantipai most clearly differs from both R.kesslerii and R.vladykovi by proportional measurements (caudal peduncle depth, head width, eye horizontal diameter, and interorbital width), from R.kesslerii also by the number of scales above and below the lateral line (6 and 4, respectively, (vs. commonly 5 and 3), and from R.vladykovi, also by 8½ branched dorsal-fin rays (vs. 7½) and the vertebral caudal region longer than the abdominal vertebral region (abdominal+caudal vertebrae 19+21 or 20+21, vs. commonly 20+20 or variants with a caudal region shorter than the abdominal one). The possibility that R.antipai represents a deep-water cophenotype of either R.kesslerii or R.vladykovi, cannot be excluded.

Moreover, NTHI is now as important a causative agent of acute OM as the pneumococcus. NTHI colonizes the human nasopharynx asymptomatically. However, upon perturbation of the innate and physical defenses of the airway by upper respiratory tract viral infection, NTHI can replicate, ascend the Eustachian tube, gain access to the normally sterile middle ear space, and cause disease. Bacterial biofilms within the middle ear, including those formed by NTHI, contribute to the chronic and recurrent nature of this disease. These multicomponent structures are highly resistant to clearance by host defenses and elimination by traditional antimicrobial therapies. Herein, we review several strategies utilized by NTHI in order to persist within the human host and interventions currently under investigation to prevent and/or resolve NTHI-induced diseases of the middle ear and uppermost airway.",Persistent Malfunction of Glymphatic and Meningeal Lymphatic Drainage in a Mouse Model of Subarachnoid Hemorrhage.,https://www.ncbi.nlm.nih.gov/pubmed/30853828,Experimental neurobiology,2019 03 29,"Subarachnoid hemorrhage (SAH) is a devastating cerebrovascular event that often is followed by permanent brain impairments. It is necessary to explore the pathogenesis of secondary pathological damages in order to find effective interventions for improving the prognosis of SAH. Blockage of brain lymphatic drainage has been shown to worsen cerebral ischemia and edema after acute SAH. However, whether or not there is persistent dysfunction of cerebral lymphatic drainage following SAH remains unclear. In this study, autologous blood was injected into the cisterna magna of mice to establish SAH model. One week after surgery, SAH mice showed decreases in fluorescent tracer drainage to the deep cervical lymph nodes (dcLNs) and influx into the brain parenchyma after injection into the cisterna magna. Moreover, SAH impaired polarization of astrocyte aquaporin-4 (AQP4) that is a functional marker of glymphatic clearance and resulted in accumulations of Tau proteins as well as CD3+, CD4+, and CD8+ cells in the brain. In addition, pathological changes, including microvascular spasm, activation of glial cells, neuroinflammation, and neuronal apoptosis were observed in the hippocampus of SAH mice. Present results demonstrate persistent malfunction of glymphatic and meningeal lymphatic drainage and related neuropathological damages after SAH. Targeting improvement of brain lymphatic clearance potentially serves as a new strategy for the treatment of SAH."

Two explanatory item-response models were developed using alternative nonword scoring procedures. Use of less frequent vowel GPCs was predicted by set for variability, word reading, and rime support for the context-dependent vowel pronunciation. We interpret the results within a developmental word reading model in which initially incomplete and oversimplified GPC representations become more context-dependent with reading experience.",Energy Harvesting and Sensing with Embedded Piezoelectric Ceramics in Knee Implants.,https://www.ncbi.nlm.nih.gov/pubmed/30853785,IEEE/ASME transactions on mechatronics : a joint publication of the IEEE Industrial Electronics Society and the ASME Dynamic Systems and Control Division,2019 04 01,"The knee replacement is one of the most common orthopedic surgical interventions in the United States; however, recent studies have shown up to 20% of patients are dissatisfied with the outcome. One of the key issues to improving these operations is a better understanding of the ligamentous balance during and after surgery. The goal of this work is to investigate the feasibility of embedding piezoelectric transducers in the polyethylene bearing of a total knee replacement to act as self-powered sensors to aid in the alignment and balance of the knee replacement by providing intra- and postoperative feedback to the surgeon. A model consisting of a polyethylene disc with a single embedded piezoelectric ceramic transducer is investigated as a basis for future work. A modeling framework is developed including a biomechanical model of the knee joint, a finite element model of the knee bearing with encapsulated transducer, and an electromechanical model of the piezoelectric transducer. Model predictions show that a peak voltage of 2.3 V with a load resistance of 1.01 MΩ can be obtained from a single embedded piezoelectric stack, and an average power of 12 μW can be obtained from a knee bearing with four embedded piezoelectric transducers. Uniaxial compression testing is also performed on a fabricated sample for model validation. The results found in this work show promising potential of embedded piezoelectric transducers to be utilized for autonomous, self-powered in vivo knee implant force sensors.",Vascular architecture in the bacteriogenic light organ of Euprymna tasmanica (Cephalopoda: Sepiolidae).,https://www.ncbi.nlm.nih.gov/pubmed/30853777,Invertebrate biology : a quarterly journal of the American Microscopical Society and the Division of Invertebrate Zoology/ASZ,2019 03 29,"Symbiosis between southern dumpling squid, Euprymna tasmanica (Cephalopoda: Sepiolidae), and its luminescent symbiont, the bacterium Vibrio fischeri, provides an experimentally tractable system to examine interactions between the eukaryotic host and its bacterial partner. Luminescence emitted by the symbiotic bacteria provides light for the squid in a behavior termed ""counter-illumination,"" which allows the squid to mask its shadow amidst downwelling moonlight. Although this association is beneficial, light generated from the bacteria requires large quantities of oxygen to maintain this energy-consuming reaction. Therefore, we examined the vascular network within the light organ of juveniles of E. tasmanica with and without V. fischeri. Vessel type, diameter, and location of vessels were measured. Although differences between symbiotic and aposymbiotic squid demonstrated that the presence of V. fischeri does not significantly influence the extent of vascular branching at early stages of symbiotic development, these finding do provide an atlas of blood vessel distribution in the organ. Thus, these results provide a framework to understand how beneficial bacteria influence the development of a eukaryotic closed vascular network and provide insight to the evolutionary developmental dynamics that form during mutualistic interactions.",The Development of a Brief Distress Reduction Intervention for Individuals Recently Diagnosed With HIV in China.,https://www.ncbi.nlm.nih.gov/pubmed/30853776,Cognitive and behavioral practice,2019 03 29,"In China, where there are few mental health resources, the majority of HIV-related efforts have focused on medical treatment and transmission prevention rather than psychosocial support. Yet people living with HIV/AIDS (PLWHA) report high levels of psychological distress, especially upon first receiving their HIV diagnosis. We conducted mixed methods research of a qualitative study with (N = 31) individual interviews and 3 focus groups (n = 6 in each group) of HIV-affected participants, and a quantitative survey (N = 200) with individuals living with HIV in Shanghai and Beijing, China. Our qualitative data revealed themes of forms of distress experienced and types of psychosocial support that our participants wished they could have accessed upon diagnosis as well as suggestions for intervention structure that would be most feasible and acceptable. Our quantitative surveys provided further evidence of the high degree of psychosocial distress among recently diagnosed PLWHA. Our findings informed the development of the Psychology Toolbox intervention, a brief CBT skills-based intervention comprising cognitive restructuring, behavioral activation, and paced breathing, designed to be integrated into primary care for recently diagnosed PLWHA. This study describes the intervention development process and contents of each session. Future research should evaluate the intervention for efficacy as well as examine best strategies for eventual implementation and dissemination.",Screening for and preventing perinatal depression.,https://www.ncbi.nlm.nih.gov/pubmed/30853775,Journal of child and family studies,2019 03 29,"New York City (NYC) public hospitals recently mandated that all pregnant women be screened for depression, but no funds were allocated for screening or care coordination/treatment, and research suggests that unfunded mandates are not likely to be successful. To address this, we implemented an on-site depression prevention intervention (NYC ROSE) for positive depression screens among pregnant, mostly Black and Hispanic, lower-income women in one public hospital. In this paper, we used Aarons' implementation model to describe the successes and challenges of screening and intervention. Patient tracking sheets and electronic medical records were abstracted. Key informant interviews and an informal focus group were conducted, and staff observations were reviewed; common implementation themes were identified and fit into Aarons' model. We found that a lack of funding and staff training, which led to minimal psychoeducation for patients, were outer context factors that may have made depression screening difficult, screening results unreliable, and NYC ROSE enrollment challenging. Although leadership agreed to implement NYC ROSE, early involvement of all levels of staff and patients would have better informed important inner context factors, like workflow and logistical/practical challenges. There was also a mismatch between the treatment model and the population being served; patients often lived too far away to receive additional services on site, and economic issues were often a higher priority than mental health services. Screening and interventions for perinatal depression are essential for optimal family health, and a detailed, thoughtful and funded approach can help ensure effectiveness of such efforts.",Inflammation among Children: Evidence of an Immigrant Advantage?,https://www.ncbi.nlm.nih.gov/pubmed/30853774,Advances in medical sociology,2019 03 29,"Past research on the immigrant health paradox suggests that children with immigrant parents may have a health advantage over those with U.S.-born parents, especially if the parent is a recent immigrant. Other research emphasizes the social and economic challenges children with immigrant parents face, in part due to disadvantaged social class and racial/ethnic positions. Underlying physiological changes due to chronic stress exposures among children in immigrant families is one potential health disadvantage that may not yet be apparent in traditional health measures. To explore these biological disparities during childhood, I use national biomarker and survey data from NHANES (N=11,866) to evaluate parent nativity and educational status associations with low-grade inflammation, indicated by C-reactive Protein (CRP), in children ages 2-15 years. I find that children with an immigrant parent, and particularly a low-education immigrant parent, have higher CRP, net of birth, BMI and other factors, than children with a U.S. born parent with either a low or higher education. Comparing children with low-educated parents, those with a foreign-born parent have higher predicted CRP. The findings from this study provide new evidence that children living in immigrant families in the U.S. may be facing higher levels of chronic stress exposure, as indicated by the increased risk of low-grade inflammation, than those with U.S.-born parents. The physiological changes related to increased risk of inflammation could set children in immigrant families on pathways towards mental and physical health problems throughout childhood and later in the life course.",The Use of Fibular Allograft in Complex Periarticular Fractures Around the Knee.,https://www.ncbi.nlm.nih.gov/pubmed/30853772,Operative techniques in orthopaedics,2019 03 29,"Although the use of fibular strut allografts in proximal humerus fractures has gained popularity, their use in other types of fractures is less well described. Fibular allografts have recently been used in the repair of complex periarticular fractures of the proximal tibia and distal femur. Fibular allografts can be inserted in a variety of manners to achieve goals specific to each individual fracture pattern. In the proximal tibia, insertion through a fracture line or cortical window facilitates joint surface elevation, prevents subsidence and enhances overall construct stability. In distal femoral fractures, including complex periarticular fractures, insertion through the fracture or cortical window permits indirect reduction of the medial cortex and provides necessary medial column support. An additional option in distal femur fractures includes fibula insertion as an intramedullary nail, allowing enhanced fixation in short distal fracture segments. In all cases, the use of a fibular allograft augments poor bone stock and provides improved screw purchase and construct stability when combined with conventional plating methods. Here we present a series of cases at our institution illustrating an array of novel techniques utilizing endosteal fibular allografts in the fixation of complex periarticular fractures about the knee.",Caries Management by Risk Assessment: Results from a Practice-Based Research Network Study.,https://www.ncbi.nlm.nih.gov/pubmed/30853771,Journal of the California Dental Association,2019 04 08,"Thirty dentists with clinical practices outside of a university setting were trained and calibrated successfully in DMFS and ICDAS-scoring.

ACM-Sigmod International Conference on Management of Data,2019 03 29,"We study distributed equi-join computation in the presence of join-attribute skew, which causes load imbalance. Skew can be addressed by more fine-grained partitioning, at the cost of input duplication. For random load assignment, e.g., using a hash function, fine-grained partitioning creates a tradeoff between load expectation and variance. We show that minimizing load variance subject to a constraint on expectation is a monotone submodular maximization problem with Knapsack constraints, hence admitting provably near-optimal greedy solutions. In contrast to previous work on formal optimality guarantees, we can prove this result also for self-joins and more general load functions defined as weighted sum of input and output. We further demonstrate through experiments that this theoretical result leads to an effective algorithm for the problem of minimizing running time, even when load is assigned deterministically.","Does Doing More Result in Doing Better?

PHE projects integrate services and messaging from different development sectors, including health (particularly family planning), conservation and livelihoods. However, a question remains: do such projects produce value-added outcomes; that is, synergistic effects as a result of integration across sectors? Using qualitative data to explore value-added outcomes resulting from a PHE project serving communities along Lake Victoria in Kenya and Uganda, this study explores several theories about why this integrated project may be generating value-added outcomes, including changes in established gender roles, as well as substitution of time and investment of new income into sustainable livelihood activities, particularly among women. Integration led to several value-added benefits, particularly for women, although long-term sustainability of project outcomes remains a key concern.",Science identity development trajectories in a gateway college chemistry course: Predictors and relations to achievement and STEM pursuit.,https://www.ncbi.nlm.nih.gov/pubmed/30853745,Contemporary educational psychology,2019 03 29,"This investigation of undergraduates' heterogeneous science identity trajectories within a gateway chemistry course identified three latent classes (High and Stable, Moderate and Slightly Increasing, Moderate and Declining) using growth mixture modeling.

Students with higher perceived competence were more likely classified into the High-and-Stable class compared to the other classes. Students classified into the High-and-Stable class scored significantly higher on the final exam and appeared to be more likely to remain in a STEM major across fall and spring semesters compared to the other two classes. Results suggest that some students' identities shift within a single semester and supporting science perceived competence before college may support students' science identity development.",Use of co-verbal gestures during word-finding difficulty among Cantonese speakers with fluent aphasia and unimpaired controls.,https://www.ncbi.nlm.nih.gov/pubmed/30853744,Aphasiology,2019 03 29,Co-verbal gestures refer to hand or arm movements made during speaking.

The purpose of this work was to examine the process by which communal coping may lead to such benefits. First, we hypothesized that illness-related interactions characterized by more communal coping would involve greater spouse support provision and greater patient receptivity to support. Second, we hypothesized that such interactions would lead to greater perceived problem resolution and more positive perceptions of the interaction. Third, we expected communal coping to predict changes in long-term diabetes outcomes-increased self-efficacy, improved self-care, and reduced diabetes distress-6 months later. Finally, we predicted that these long-term links would be partially explained by the immediate interaction outcomes. We tested these hypotheses in a sample of 123 persons with recently diagnosed type 2 diabetes and their spouses. Patient and spouse communal coping was observed in the laboratory during a diabetes stressor discussion, and patients reported outcomes immediately after the discussion and 6 months later. Results were largely consistent with hypotheses, but spouse communal coping was more consistently linked to support outcomes, and only patient communal coping was linked to changes in long-term outcomes. This work contributes to the literature indicating communal coping is beneficial for individuals with chronic illness and provides insight into the process by which communal coping exerts these effects.",LAGUERRE-INTERSECTION METHOD FOR IMPLICIT SOLVATION.,https://www.ncbi.nlm.nih.gov/pubmed/30853740,International journal of computational geometry & applications,2019 03 29,"Explicit solvent molecular dynamics simulations of a macromolecule are slow as the number of solvent atoms considered typically increases by order of magnitude. Implicit methods introduce surface-dependent corrections to the force field, gaining speed at the expense of accuracy. Properties such as molecular interface surfaces, volumes and cavities are captured by Laguerre tessellations of macromolecules. However, Laguerre cells of exterior atoms tend to be overly large or unbounded. Our method, the inclusion-exclusion based Laguerre-Intersection method, caps cells in a physically accurate manner by considering the intersection of the space-filling diagram with the Laguerre tessellation. We optimize an adjustable parameter, the weight, to ensure the areas and volumes of capped cells exposed to solvent are as close as possible, on average, to those computed from equilibrated explicit solvent simulations. The contact planes are radical planes, meaning that as the solvent weight is varied, interior cells remain constant. We test the consistency of our model using a high-quality trajectory of HIV-protease, a dimer with flexible loops and open-close transitions. We also compare our results with interval-arithmetic Gauss-Bonnet based method. Optimal solvent parameters quickly converge, which we use to illustrate the increased fidelity of the Laguerre-Intersection method over two recently proposed methods as compared to the explicit model.",Protein structure prediction.,https://www.ncbi.nlm.nih.gov/pubmed/30853739,International journal of modern physics.

The rolling window method maintains the nonrevisability of published index numbers while it allows index numbers for new periods and locations be calculated and the basket of items be updated. Meanwhile, the multilateral structure of price comparison eliminates significant downward drift in standard chained indexes. Using county-level bilateral and panel indexes based on retail beverage scanner data, we experimentally adjust for purchasing parity the portion of Supplemental Nutrition Assistance Program (SNAP) benefits that participants spend on beverages. Accounting for temporal and spatial cost differences causes over 2% of SNAP allotment spent on beverages be reallocated, or approximately a 5% change in allotment on average for a county. About 90% of the relocated SNAP fund is to adjust for spatial differences in food cost. We also compare SNAP allotments implied by the retail scanner data indexes with those implied by indexes based on the USDA Quarterly Food-at-Home Price Database (QFAHPD).

Early detection of these molecular changes is a key aspect for the success of interventions aimed at slowing down rates of cognitive decline. Recent evidence indicates that of the two established methods for measuring amyloid, a decrease in cerebrospinal fluid (CSF) amyloid β1-42 (Aβ1-42) may be an earlier indicator of Alzheimer's disease risk than measures of amyloid obtained from Positron Emission Tomography (PET). However, CSF collection is highly invasive and expensive. In contrast, blood collection is routinely performed, minimally invasive and cheap. In this work, we develop a blood-based signature that can provide a cheap and minimally invasive estimation of an individual's CSF amyloid status using a machine learning approach. We show that a Random Forest model derived from plasma analytes can accurately predict subjects as having abnormal (low) CSF Aβ1-42 levels indicative of AD risk (0.84 AUC, 0.78 sensitivity, and 0.73 specificity). Refinement of the modeling indicates that only APOEε4 carrier status and four plasma analytes (CGA, Aβ1-42, Eotaxin 3, APOE) are required to achieve a high level of accuracy. Furthermore, we show across an independent validation cohort that individuals with predicted abnormal CSF Aβ1-42 levels transitioned to an AD diagnosis over 120 months significantly faster than those with predicted normal CSF Aβ1-42 levels and that the resulting model also validates reasonably across PET Aβ1-42 status (0.78 AUC). This is the first study to show that a machine learning approach, using plasma protein levels, age and APOEε4 carrier status, is able to predict CSF Aβ1-42 status, the earliest risk indicator for AD, with high accuracy.",Transient receptor potential Vanilloid 1-based gene therapy alleviates orthodontic pain in rats.,https://www.ncbi.nlm.nih.gov/pubmed/30853711,International journal of oral science,2019 03 29,"Orthodontic pain that is induced by tooth movement is an important sequela of orthodontic treatment and has a significant effect on patient quality of life. Studies have shown that the high expression of transient receptor potential vanilloid 1 (TRPV1) in trigeminal ganglions plays a vital role in the transmission and modulation of orofacial pain. However, little is known about the role of TRPV1 in orthodontic pain. In this study, male Sprague-Dawley rats were randomly assigned to six groups to study the role of TRPV1 in the modulation of tooth-movement pain. The expression levels of TRPV1 mRNA and protein were determined by real-time PCR and western blot, respectively. Moreover, pain levels were assessed using the rat grimace scale (RGS). The role of TRPV1 in modulating tooth-movement pain was examined by injecting a TRPV1 antagonist into the trigeminal ganglia of rats. A lentivirus containing a TRPV1 shRNA sequence was constructed and transduced into the rats' trigeminal ganglia. The results showed that the expression levels of TRPV1 protein and mRNA were elevated following tooth-movement pain. Pain levels increased rapidly on the 1st day, peaked on the 3rd day and returned to baseline on the 14th day. The TRPV1 antagonist significantly reduced tooth-movement pain. The lentivirus containing a TRPV1 shRNA sequence was able to inhibit the expression of TRPV1 and relieved tooth-movement pain. In conclusion, TRPV1-based gene therapy may be a treatment strategy for the relief of orthodontic pain.",Investigation of novel variations of ORAI1 gene and their association with Kawasaki disease.,https://www.ncbi.nlm.nih.gov/pubmed/30853710,Journal of human genetics,2019 05 12,"ORAI1 encodes a calcium channel essential in the store-operated calcium entry mechanism. A previous genetic association study identified a rare in-frame insertion variant of ORAI1 conferring Kawasaki disease (KD). To deepen our understanding of the involvement of rare variants of ORAI1 in KD pathogenesis, we investigated 3812 patients with KD and 2644 healthy individuals for variations in the protein-coding region of ORAI1. By re-sequencing the study participants' DNA, 27 variants with minor allele frequencies (MAFs) < 0.01 that had not been examined in the previous study were identified. Although no significant association with KD was observed either in single-variant analyses or in a collapsing method analysis of the 27 variants, stratification by MAFs, variant types, and predicted deleteriousness revealed that six rare, deleterious, missense variants (MAF < 0.001, CADD C-score ≥ 20) were exclusively present in KD patients, including three refractory cases (OR = ∞, P = 0.046). The six missense variants include p.Gly98Asp, which has been demonstrated to result in gain of function leading to constitutive Ca2+ entry. Conversely, five types of frameshift variants, all identified near the N terminus and assumed to disrupt ORAI1 function, showed an opposite trend of association (OR = 0.35, P = 0.24). These findings support our hypothesis that genetic variations causing the upregulation of the Ca2+/NFAT pathway confer susceptibility to KD. Our findings also provide insights into the usefulness of stratifying the variants based on their MAFs and on the direction of the effects on protein function when conducting association studies using the gene-based collapsing method.",High-Mobility Group Box 1 (HMGB1) and Autophagy in Acute Lung Injury (ALI): A Review.,https://www.ncbi.nlm.nih.gov/pubmed/30853709,Medical science monitor : international medical journal of experimental and clinical research,2019 04 29,"Acute lung injury (ALI) is a life-threatening clinical syndrome in critically ill patients. The identification of novel biological markers for the early diagnosis of ALI and the development of more effective treatments are topics of current research.

Levels of HMGB1 may reflect the severity of inflammation and tissue damage, indicating a potential role for HMGB1 as a prognostic biomarker in ALI, and a potential target for blocking inflammatory pathways. Several studies have shown that HMGB1 regulates autophagy. Autophagy, or type II programmed cell death, is an essential biological process that maintains cellular homeostasis. Studies have shown that HMGB1 and autophagy are involved in the pathogenesis of many lung diseases including ALI but the specific mechanisms underlying this association remain to be determined.

Undifferentiated Pleomorphic Sarcoma, formerly called Malignant Fibrous Histiocytoma, is a rare subtype identified by a lack specific immunohistochemical markers for a specific lineage of differentiation. These soft tissue tumors are aggressive and rapidly enlarge. Risk for metastasis increases almost linearly as the tumor increases in size, emphasizing the importance of early detection, treatment, and post-resection monitoring. CASE REPORT This article reports a case of a large undifferentiated pleomorphic sarcoma of the posterior thigh in a 62-year-old female. Given the patient's history of thrombotic thrombocytopenic purpure, her initial mass was thought to be a hematoma following a hernia repair surgery. After diagnosis of undifferentiated pleomorphic sarcoma, she underwent radical excision revealing a 24×9.5×7cm lesion - one of the largest reported in the literature. CONCLUSIONS Sarcomas are very rare soft tissue neoplasms, but they should not be excluded in a physician's differentials when a patient presents with an enlarging soft tissue mass. Because sarcomas enlarge rapidly, delay in evaluation and management should be avoided and these patients should be quickly referred to a center specializing in sarcoma treatment. Magnetic Resonance Imaging (MRI) is the recommended initial imaging for all soft tissue masses of the extremities, trunk, and head and neck while Computed Tomography (CT) is the recommended imaging choice for retroperitoneal and visceral masses. After successful surgical excision with clean margins, patients should undergo serial monitoring by CT or MRI for surveillance of recurrence or late pulmonary metastases.",A Rare Case of Adenosquamous Carcinoma Arising in the Background of IgG4-Related Lung Disease.,https://www.ncbi.nlm.nih.gov/pubmed/30853707,Journal of pathology and translational medicine,2019 06 10,"IgG4-related disease is a systemic inflammatory disease and is known as IgG4-related lung disease (IgG4-RLD) when it involves the respiratory system.

However, little is known about how microbial community structures change over time after the initial injection of degraders. In this study, we have assessed the ecological impact of bioaugmentation using metagenomic and metatranscriptomic approaches to remove trichlorinated ethylene/cis-dichloroethylene (TCE/cDCE) by Rhodococcus jostii strain RHA1 as an aerobic chemical compound degrader. Metagenomic analysis showed that the number of organisms belonging to the genus Rhodococcus, including strain RHA1, increased from 0.1% to 76.6% of the total microbial community on day 0 at the injection site. Subsequently, the populations of strain RHA1 and other TCE/cDCE-degrading bacteria gradually decreased over time, whereas the populations of the anaerobic dechlorinators Geobacter and Dehalococcoides increased at later stages. Metatranscriptomic analysis revealed a high expression of aromatic compound-degrading genes (bphA1-A4) in strain RHA1 after RHA1 injection. From these results, we concluded that the key dechlorinators of TCE/cDCE were mainly aerobic bacteria, such as RHA1, until day 1, after which the key dechlorinators changed to anaerobic bacteria, such as Geobacter and Dehalococcocides, after day 6 at the injection well. Based on the α-diversity, the richness levels of the microbial community were increased after injection of strain RHA1, and the microbial community composition had not been restored to that of the original composition during the 19 days after treatment. These results provide insights into the assessment of the ecological impact and bioaugmentation process of RHA1 at bioremediation sites."

The transcriptional repressor Bach1 plays an important role in this response through its heme-binding activity. Heme inhibits the transcriptional-repressor activity of Bach1, and can occur in two binding modes: 5- and 6-coordinated binding. The Cys-Pro (CP) motif has been determined to be the heme-binding motif of Bach family proteins. The sequence of Bach1 includes six CP motifs, and four CP motifs are functional. With the aim of elucidating the molecular mechanism of heme-Bach1 regulation, we conducted biophysical analyses focusing on the C-terminal region of mouse Bach1 (residues 631-739) which is located after the bZip domain and includes one functional CP motif. UV-Vis spectroscopy indicated that the CP motif binds heme via 5-coordinated bond. A mutant, which included a cysteine to alanine substitution at the CP motif, did not show 5-coordination, suggesting that this binding mode is specific to the CP motif. Surface plasmon resonance revealed that the binding affinity and stoichiometry of heme with the Bach1 C-terminal region were KD = 1.37 × 10-5 M and 2.3, respectively. The circular dichroism spectrum in the near-UV region exhibited peaks for heme binding to the CP motif. No significant spectral shifts were observed in the far-UV region when samples with and without heme were compared. Therefore, disordered-ordered transition such as ""coupled folding and binding"" is not involved in the Bach1-heme system. Consequently, the heme response of this C-terminal region is accomplished by disorder-disorder conformational alteration.",Impact of Renal Dysfunction on Left Atrial Low-Voltage Areas in Patients With Atrial Fibrillation.,https://www.ncbi.nlm.nih.gov/pubmed/30853681,Circulation journal : official journal of the Japanese Circulation Society,2019 04 25,"The presence of residual left atrial low-voltage areas (LVA) has been shown to be strongly associated with atrial fibrillation (AF) recurrence after pulmonary vein isolation. A preliminary study showed that concomitant chronic kidney disease (CKD) increased the rate of AF recurrence. The association between CKD and LVA, however, has not been elucidated. In the present study, we investigated the association between CKD severity and LVA prevalence. Methods and Results: In total, 183 consecutive AF patients who underwent initial ablation for AF were enrolled in this retrospective observational study. Serum cystatin C before ablation was measured, and the estimated glomerular filtration rate (eGFR) was calculated. LVA were defined as sites of left atrial electrogram amplitude <0.5 mV. Of 183 patients, 76 (42%) had LVA. Patients with LVA had lower eGFR calculated using cystatin C (74±22 vs. 86±24 mL/min/1.73 m2, P=0.001). The optimal cut-off of the calculated eGFR was 71.5 mL/min/1.73 m2, corresponding to a 79.4% sensitivity, 50% specificity, and 67.2% predictive accuracy. LVA occurred more frequently in patients with more severe categories of CKD. On multivariate analysis, eGFR <71.5 mL/min/1.73 m2was an independent predictor of LVA (odds ratio, 3.3; 95% CI: 1.4-7.8; P=0.006).",[Autoimmune pancreatitis with bowel obstruction caused by proximal jejunal stricture:a case report].,https://www.ncbi.nlm.nih.gov/pubmed/30853679,Nihon Shokakibyo Gakkai zasshi = The Japanese journal of gastro-enterology,2019 06 13,We herein report a rare case of autoimmune pancreatitis with small intestinal obstruction.

Ettingsh enhances innate immunity and disease resistance in Oreochromis niloticus (Linn.).",https://www.ncbi.nlm.nih.gov/pubmed/30853657,Fish & shellfish immunology,2019 04 02,"The polysaccharide fraction (PF) isolated from the hemiparasitic mistletoe, Dendrophthoe falcata (L.f.) Ettingsh (DF) leaves was tested for its immunostimulatory properties in Oreochromis niloticus (Linn.). Different groups of experimental fish were fed for 1, 2 or 3 weeks with three different doses [low (0.01%), mid (0.1%), or high (1%)] of D. falcata polysaccharide fraction (DFPF) - supplemented diet. After every feeding regimen, the fish were assessed for non-specific immunological parameters, immune related gene expression and disease protection. The DFPF treated groups showed significant (P < 0.05) enhancement of non-specific immune parameters. Significant (P < 0.05) upregulation of lysozyme and TNF-α gene expression was observed in DFPF treated groups. In pathogen challenge studies using Aeromonas hydrophila, the DFPF treated groups displayed significant (P < 0.05) decrease in percentage mortality and the consequent increase in relative percent survival (RPS). Supplementation of 1% DFPF in the feed for a week conferred the maximum protection against the virulent pathogen challenge, recording a RPS of 100. These results suggest that DFPF has the potential to be used as an immunostimulating feed additive in finfish aquaculture.",Cloning and functional characterization of rockfish peroxiredoxin 4 homolog with its innate immune responses.,https://www.ncbi.nlm.nih.gov/pubmed/30853656,Fish & shellfish immunology,2019 04 02,"The fourth member of the typical 2-cysteine peroxiredoxin (Prx4) is a well-known antioxidant enzyme, which reduces different peroxides in their catalytic process. The present study reports the identification of the rockfish Sebastes schlegelii Prx4 (SsPrx4) at a genomic level, as well as the characterization of its structural and functional features. SsPrx4 harbors a complete ORF of 786 bp encoding a polypeptide (29 kDa) of 262 amino acids (aa) with an isoelectric point of 6.2. Thioredoxin 2 domain was prominent in the SsPrx4 sequence, which has a signal peptide (31 bp) at the N-terminus. Hence, the SsPrx4 may be functionally active in the cytoplasm of rockfish cells. Moreover, two VCP motifs and three catalytic triad residues (112T, 115C, 191R) were identified in the SsPrx4 protein sequence. A peroxidatic cysteine (115CP) and resolving cysteines (236CR) were detected at the VCP motifs. The rockfish Prx4 genome consists of seven exons, which are similar to the architecture of other Prx4 orthologs. The deduced amino acid sequence of SsPrx4 shares a relatively high amino acid sequence identity (91.6%) and close evolutionary relationship with Miichthys miiuy and Stegastes partitus Prx4. The potential for scavenging extracellular H2O2 was evidenced by the purified recombinant SsPrx4 protein (rSsPrx4) in vitro system. Moreover, rSsPrx4 may protect the plasmid DNA in a metal-catalyzed oxidation system and catalyze the reduction of an insulin disulfide bond. Quantitative real-time PCR revealed that SsPrx4 mRNA was ubiquitously expressed in fourteen different tissues, with the highest expression observed in the liver followed by the ovary, and kidney tissues. Transcriptional modulations were observed in liver and spleen tissues of rockfish after injecting them with bacterial stimuli, including Streptococcus iniae, LPS, and a viral mimic of poly I:C. Together, the results suggest that SsPrx4 may play an important role in both the antioxidant and innate immune defense of black rockfish. These findings provide structural and functional insights into the SsPrx4 of the teleost.",Negative regulation of the interferon response by finTRIM82 in the orange spotted grouper.,https://www.ncbi.nlm.nih.gov/pubmed/30853655,Fish & shellfish immunology,2019 04 02,"Tripartite motif (TRIM) proteins have been demonstrated to exhibit critical functions in multiple cellular processes, including development, carcinogenesis, and programmed cell death, and are also widely recognized to be important antiviral restriction factors or modulators of immune and inflammatory signaling pathways. However, in teleosts, additional TRIM members have been identified and their functions remain largely unknown. Here, a novel finTRIM gene from orange spotted grouper (EcfinTRIM82) was cloned and characterized. Sequence analysis indicated that EcfinTRIM82 encoded a 575 amino acid peptide which shared 94% and 82% identity with Asian sea bass (Lates calcarifer), and zebrafish (Danio rerio) finTRIM82, respectively. EcfinTRIM82 contained three conserved domains, including a RING, B-Box, and SPRY domain. Using fluorescence microscopy, we found that green fluorescence aggregates were observed in the cytoplasm of EcfinTRIM82-EGFP transfected grouper spleen (GS) cells. As the infection proceeded, EcfinTRIM82 transcription was significantly upregulated in Singapore grouper iridovirus (SGIV) or red-spotted grouper nervous necrosis virus (RGNNV) infected GS cells. This suggests that EcfinTRIM82 might be involved in fish virus infection. The in vitro overexpression of EcfinTRIM82 in GS cells significantly enhanced the replication of SGIV and RGNNV, evidenced by increased expression of viral genes, including the SGIV major capsid protein (MCP), VP19, ICP-18, RGNNV coat protein (CP), and RNA-dependent RNA polymerase (RdRp). Furthermore, the ectopic expression of EcfinTRIM82 significantly decreased the expression of interferon (IFN)-related signaling molecules, including interferon regulatory factor 3 (IRF3), IRF7, interferon stimulated gene 15 (ISG15), ISG56, IFP35, and myxovirus resistance gene (MXI), suggesting that EcfinTRIM82 regulated viral replication via the negative regulation of the host IFN response. In addition, EcfinTRIM82 overexpression substantially decreased the level of proinflammatory cytokine transcription. Furthermore, the ectopic expression of EcfinTRIM82 significantly weakened the melanoma differentiation-associated protein 5 (MDA5), mediator of IRF3 activation (MITA) and mitochondrial antiviral-signaling (MAVS) protein-induced IFN response by detecting the transcription of interferon related cytokines and the promoter activity of IFN. Together, our results demonstrate that finTRIM82 negatively regulates the innate antiviral immune response against grouper virus infection.",A novel LRR and Ig domain-containing protein could function as an immune effector in Crassostrea gigas.,https://www.ncbi.nlm.nih.gov/pubmed/30853654,Fish & shellfish immunology,2019 04 02,"A variety of combinations of leucine-rich repeat (LRR) and immunoglobulin-like (Ig) domains have been found and discovered in invertebrates and vertebrates, but the functions remain largely unexplored. In the present study, a novel LRR and Ig domain-containing protein (LRRIG), CgLRRIG-3, was identified and characterized from oyster Crassostrea gigas. It contained two typical LRR motifs, a LRRNT motif and an Ig domain and PSI-BALST and phylogeny analysis revealed that the sequence of CgLRRIG-3 was most related with leucine-rich repeat neuronal 1 proteins from vertebrate. Its mRNA transcripts were constitutively expressed in muscle, gill, hepatopancreas, mantle, gonad and hemocytes with the highest level in hepatopancreas. The mRNA expression level of CgLRRIG-3 in hemocytes could respond to the stimulations of variety PAMPs including lipopolysaccharide (LPS), peptidoglycan (PGN), glucan (GLU) and polyinosinic-polycytidylic acid (poly I:C). The recombinant proteins exhibited a wide PAMP binding repertoire to four typical PAMPs and could significantly induce the expression of CgTNF-1 and CgIL17-5 as well as increase phagocytosis in primary cultured oyster hemocytes. In hepatopancreas, CgLRRIG-3 was mainly distributed in the basolateral membrane of digestive tubule and the hemocoel sinusoid between the digestive tubules. And in hemocytes, the positive signal was mainly distributed in a special group of granulocytes. These results collectively indicated that CgLRRIG-3 could not only function as an immune effector.",Maintaining automated measurement of Choosing Wisely adherence across the ICD 9 to 10 transition.,https://www.ncbi.nlm.nih.gov/pubmed/30853653,Journal of biomedical informatics,2019 05 08,"It remains unclear how to incorporate terminology changes, such as the International Classification of Disease (ICD) transition from ICD-9 to ICD-10, into established automated healthcare quality metrics.",The androgen receptor in the hypothalamus positively regulates hind-limb muscle mass and voluntary physical activity in adult male mice.,https://www.ncbi.nlm.nih.gov/pubmed/30853652,The Journal of steroid biochemistry and molecular biology,2019 05 06,"We have previously shown that expression of the androgen receptor (AR) in neurons within the brain positively regulates hind-limb muscle mass and physical activity in male mice. To further investigate the region of the brain responsible for mediating these effects of testosterone and to determine whether they are only important for muscle mass accrual during development or whether they are also important for the maintenance of muscle mass in the adult, we deleted the AR specifically in the hypothalamus of adult male mice (Hyp-ARKOs). Hyp-ARKO mice were generated by bilateral stereotaxic microinjection of an adeno-associated virus (AAV) expressing GFP and iCre recombinase under the control of the e-synapsin promoter into the hypothalamus of 10-week-old exon 3-AR floxed male mice. AR mRNA was deleted by 45% in the hypothalamus of Hyp-ARKOs at 5 weeks post-AAV-eSyn-iCre injection. This led to an increase in the mass of the androgen-dependent organs, seminal vesicles and kidneys, by 30% (P < 0.01) and 10% (P < 0.05) respectively, and an increase in serum luteinizing hormone (LH) by 2 fold (P < 0.05). Whilst the mean value for serum testosterone was higher in the Hyp-ARKOs, this did not reach statistical significance. Despite a phenotype consistent with increased androgen bioactivity in Hyp-ARKOs, which would be expected to increase muscle mass, the mass of the hind-limb muscles, gastrocnemius (Gast) (P = 0.001), extensor digitorum longus (EDL) (P < 0.001) and soleus (Sol) (P < 0.01) were paradoxically decreased by 12-19% compared to controls. Voluntary physical activity was reduced by 65% (P < 0.05) in Hyp-ARKO male mice and was associated with a reduction in gene expression of Drd1a and Maob (P ≤ 0.05) in the hypothalamus, suggesting involvement of the brain dopaminergic system. These data provide compelling evidence that androgen signalling via the AR in the hypothalamus acts to positively regulate the maintenance of hind-limb muscle mass and voluntary activity in adult male mice, independent of AR signalling in peripheral tissues.",Surface protein engineering increases the circulation time of a cell membrane-based nanotherapeutic.,https://www.ncbi.nlm.nih.gov/pubmed/30853651,"Nanomedicine : nanotechnology, biology, and medicine",2019 04 30,"Mammalian cell membranes are often incompatible with chemical modifications typically used to increase circulation half-life. Using cellular nanoghosts as a model, we show that proline-alanine-serine (PAS) peptide sequences expressed on the membrane surface can extend the circulation time of a cell membrane derived nanotherapeutic. Membrane expression of a PAS 40 repeat sequence decreased protein binding and resulted in a 90% decrease in macrophage uptake when compared with non-PASylated controls (P ≤ 0.05). PASylation also extended circulation half-life (t1/2 = 37 h) compared with non-PASylated controls (t1/2 = 10.5 h) (P ≤ 0.005), resulting in ~7-fold higher in vivo serum concentrations at 24 h and 48 h (P ≤ 0.005).

Molecular and cell biology of lipids,2019 04 24,"Lysophospholipid acyltransferases (LPLATs) incorporate a fatty acid into the hydroxyl group of lysophospholipids (LPLs) and are critical for determining the fatty acid composition of phospholipids. Previous studies have focused mainly on their molecular identification and their substrate specificity regarding the polar head groups and acyl-CoAs. However, little is known about the positional specificity of the hydroxyl group of the glycerol backbone (sn-2 or sn-1) at which LPLATs introduce a fatty acid. This is mainly due to the instability of LPLs used as an acceptor, especially for LPLs with a fatty acid at the sn-2 position of the glycerol backbone (sn-2-LPLs), which are essential for the enzymatic assay to determine the positional specificity. In this study, we established a method to determine the positional specificity of LPLAT by preparing stable sn-2-LPLs in combination with PLA2 digestion, and applied the method for determining the positional specificity of several LPLATs including LPCAT1, LYCAT and LPCAT3. We found that LPCAT1 introduced palmitic acid both at the sn-1 and sn-2 positions of palmitoyl-LPC, while LYCAT and LPCAT3 specifically introduced stearic acid at the sn-1 position of LPG and arachidonic acid at the sn-2 position of LPC, respectively. The present method for evaluating the positional specificity could also be used for biochemical characterization of other LPLATs.",Toxicological evaluation of Picralima nitida in rodents.,https://www.ncbi.nlm.nih.gov/pubmed/30853649,Journal of ethnopharmacology,2019 04 05,"Picralima nitida (Stapf) T. Durand and H. Durand (Apocynaceae), over the years has shown wide range of usage in African folk medicine and its safety profile in instances of prolonged use and pregnancy are major concerns. The study aimed to extensively investigate the toxicological effects of Picralima nitida in albino rodents and make appropriate extrapolations to humans. In the first phase of the experiment which evaluated the genotoxicity and subchronic toxicity of P. nitida, a total of 40 albino rats (male and female) were randomized into 4 groups of 10 animals per group. Group 1 (control group) was orally administered with 10 ml/kg of distilled water. Animals in Groups 2 to 4 were administered with aqueous seed extract of the plant at 100, 200, 400 mg/kg body weight/day, respectively. Oral administration at the designated doses was continued for 90 days after which they were sacrificed by cervical dislocation for subchronic toxicological assessment. In the genotoxicity phase, 30 female mice were randomized into 5 groups, the control group was treated with 10 ml/kg of distilled water, groups 2 to 4, treated with 100 mg/kg, 200 mg/kg and 400 mg/kg doses of extract, and the 5th group had cyclophosphamide (0.1 mg/kg). The mice were sacrificed on the 28th day for bone marrow sampling for genotoxicity testing. In the second phase of the experiment which evaluated the teratogenicity of P. nitida, graded doses of the extract were administered to pregnant rats from day 1-19. Three groups of 6 female rats per group were administered 75, 150 and 300 mg/kg aqueous extract of P. nitida and a fourth group of 6 rats used as control was administered distilled water at 10 ml/kg. On day 20, 3 dams from each group were sacrificed and the foetuses were harvested through abdominal incision for physical examination. The 3 remaining dams were allowed to litter. The litters were sacrificed at 6 weeks for biochemical, haematological and histological analyses. The LD50 determined was 707.107 mg/kg. The aqueous seed extract of P. nitida was found to be genotoxic at all the test doses. There were no significant alterations in haematologic and renal parameters following subchronic administration. Notable dynamics were observed in hormonal characteristics: there was a significant dose-dependent reduction in FSH while oestradiol and progesterone showed dose-dependent increase. Furthermore, P. nitida may cause hepatopathy as shown by hepatic venous and sinusoidal congestion on hepatic histology. Also, there is non-significant reduction in total cholesterol and LDL. No significant alteration in glucose level. Furthermore, the extract produced a statistically significant decrease in birth weight (p < 0.0001). The extract induced a significant (p < 0.05) increase in creatinine and transaminase levels in the first filial of group 150 mg/kg. The platelet count was increased in all treated group (p < 0.005). All the histology of kidney in 150 mg/kg group showed vascular congestion. In conclusion, the aqueous seed extract of P. nitida has teratogenic effects and should not be used in pregnant women. Also, P. nitida is highly genotoxic and may cause hepatic damage and depletion of glutathione pool on chronic use, thereby causing oxidative stress and its potential sequelae.",Antiproliferative activity of ionic liquid-graviola fruit extract against human breast cancer (MCF-7) cell lines using flow cytometry techniques.,https://www.ncbi.nlm.nih.gov/pubmed/30853648,Journal of ethnopharmacology,2019 04 05,"Medicinal plants have been used for ages by indigenous communities around the world to help humankind sustain its health.

In a 7-day aerobic batch culture at 30 °C, the biomass and lipid concentrations were maximized using an initial molasses concentration of 80 g/L and ammonium acetate (nitrogen source) concentration of 2.14 g/L. At a fixed initial molasses concentration of 80 g/L, the concentration of the nitrogen source was further fine-tuned to 2.25 g/L, to maximize the lipid content of the biomass to around 30% by dry mass. This medium was used to test the effects of stressing salts (sodium acetate, magnesium sulfate, sodium chloride) on production of lipids and biomass. A two-step bolus feeding with magnesium sulfate and sodium acetate, enhanced the final biomass concentration to around 19 g/L (a 50% increase relative to control), but the lipid content in the biomass was reduced to around 16% w/w. A 33% enhancement in lipid concentration relative to control, was achieved by feeding magnesium sulfate and sodium acetate. Sugarcane molasses could be effectively used to produce biomass and lipids instead of using the much more expensive pure carbon sources such as glucose and sucrose.",Hydroxytyrosol rich-mixture from olive mill wastewater and production of green products by feeding Rhodopseudomonas sp. S16-FVPT5 with the residual effluent.,https://www.ncbi.nlm.nih.gov/pubmed/30853636,Journal of biotechnology,2019 03 26,"This study disserts on the exploitation of olive mill wastewater (OMW) for the production of both bio-based poly-β-hydroxybutyrate (PHB) and hydrogen (H2) by using the residual effluent as feedstock for growing purple bacteria after the recovery of hydroxytyrosol-rich mixtures. In particular, Rhodopseudomonas sp. S16-FVPT5 was fed with either the virgin OMW or dephenolized-OMW (d-OMW). For polyphenols removal, the OMW was treated with activated carbon; subsequently, acidified ethanol (pH = 3.1) at 50 °C was used as extractor solvent for obtaining hydroxytyrosol-rich mixtures. The maximum hydroxytyrosol content in the resultant polyphenolic mixture was 2.02 g/L. The highest co-production of PHB (315 mg PHB/L) and H2 (2236 mL H2/L) were achieved feeding Rhodopseudomonas sp. S16-FVPT5 with pure d-OMW. The highest hydrogen yield (4.55 L(H2)/Ld-OMW) was obtained feeding the bacterium with d-OMW, diluted at 25%; by increasing the content of d-OMW into the culture broth the hydrogen yield progressively decreased. Lower results were obtained by feeding the bacterium with a synthetic medium, the cumulative hydrogen was 1855 mL H2/L); the PHB was 101 mg PHB/L. The highest theoretical light conversion efficiency was 2.36% with the synthetic medium and 1.99% when feeding Rhodopseudomonas sp.

Maize silage was substituted by both 10% and 20% untreated, and 20% ultrasonicated microalgae biomass on a VS (volatile solids) basis. The substitution of maize silage with 20% of either ultrasonicated and untreated microalgae led to significantly lower biogas yields, i.e., 560 dm³ kg-1 VScorr in the reference compared to 516 and 509 dm³ kg-1VScorr for untreated and ultrasonicated microalgae substitution. Further, the viscosities in the different reactors were measured at an OLR of 3.5 g VS dm-3 d-1. However, all treatments with microalgae resulted in significantly lower viscosities. While the mean viscosity reached 0.503 Pa s in the reference reactor, mean viscosities were 53% lower in reactors where maize was substituted by 20% microalgae, i.e. 0.239 Pa s, at a constant rotation speed of 30 rpm. Reactors where maize was substituted by 20% ultrasonicated microalgae had a 32% lower viscosity, for 10% microalgae substitution a decrease of 8% was measured. Decreased viscosities have beneficial effect on the bioprocess and the economy in biogas plants. Nonetheless, with regard to other parameters, no positive effect on biogas yields by partial substitution with microalgae biomass was found. The application of microalgae may be an interesting option in anaerobic digestion when fibrous or lignocellulosic substances lead to high viscosities of the digested slurries. High production costs remain the bottleneck for making microalgae an interesting feedstock.",Atmospheric and room temperature plasma (ARTP) mutagenesis enables xylitol over-production with yeast Candida tropicalis.,https://www.ncbi.nlm.nih.gov/pubmed/30853634,Journal of biotechnology,2019 04 05,"Xylitol is a sugar alcohol that is used as a sweetener in food and confections. Industrially, xylitol is manufactured by chemical hydrogenation of d-xylose, which requires expensive separation and purification steps as well as high pressure and temperature. The microbial production of xylitol has been examined as an alternative to the chemical process. In this study, a xylitol over-producing strain is breeded by mutagenesis of a newly isolated yeast Candida tropicalis with a new mutation breeding system named atmospheric and room temperature plasma. The highest yield strain T31 was screened among more than 200 mutants with a xylitol yield of 0.61 g/g, which represents a yield increase of 22%. Furthermore, a two-stage dissolved oxygen supply strategy was used in a fermentation process resulting the maximum xylitol yield 0.79 g/g, which makes it a promising candidate for xylitol production. Further biochemical analysis indicating the relative gene expression and the enzyme activity of xylose reductase were higher in mutants than those in the original strain, which partly explained the high yield of xylitol. Thus, this study provides a new strategy to breed the over-producing strains for the xylitol industry.",Transient manipulation of the expression level of selected growth rate correlating microRNAs does not increase growth rate in CHO-K1 cells.,https://www.ncbi.nlm.nih.gov/pubmed/30853633,Journal of biotechnology,2019 03 26,"Engineering of Chinese Hamster Ovary cells by manipulating microRNA (miRNA) expression levels has been shown to induce advantageous, desired phenotypes. Most of these studies so far were concerned with increasing productivity or reducing growth rate (with the implied intention of thus freeing cellular resources to also increase productivity). Here we evaluated the ability of growth correlating miRNAs to increase the growth rate of CHO-K1 cells by transient overexpression or knock down, respectively. Candidates were selected based on the correlation between growth rate and miRNA expression levels as observed in previous studies. These candidates were then up- or downregulated initially by transfection of mimics or inhibitors and subsequently by transfection of plasmids bearing the corresponding miRNAs or sponges. None of the 40 selected candidates was able to induce a better growth phenotype under these conditions. Overlap between miRNAs identified to correlate to growth in published miRNA expression studies and those identified to actively increase growth rate in a functional screen is minimal, indicating that the here selected approach of traditional overexpression/knock down engineering of miRNAs may not be a suitable strategy for the purpose of increasing growth rate.",Endoglucanase improve the growth of homofermentative Lactobacillus spp. in ensilages.,https://www.ncbi.nlm.nih.gov/pubmed/30853632,Journal of biotechnology,2019 03 26,"Endoglucanase, an important component of cellulases, is used as additives in ensiling of forage crops. However, its detailed role is unclear in ensilages. In the present study, two endoglucanases Cel5 and Cel9 produced by strain Paenibacillus panacisoli SDMCC050309, previously isolated from ensiled corn stover, were identified in the cultures by microcrystalline cellulose absorption coupled with zymogram analysis. After heterologously expressed in Escherichia coli DE3 and purified, these two proteins were biochemically characterized. Cel5 was 61 kDa and showed maximal activity at pH 7.0 and 45 °C, while the maximum activity was at pH 8.0 and 65 °C for Cel9 with 97 kDa in size. Both of them could degrade carboxymethyl cellulose into cellooligosaccharides, in which cellobiose and cellotriose could be used as substrates for the growth of homofermentative strains Lactobacillus plantarum CGMCC6888 and L. farciminis CCTCC AB2016237, but not for the heterofermentative strains L. brevis SDMCC050297 and L. parafarraginis SDMCC050300. Therefore, we concluded that the added endoglucanase contributed to enhance the growth of homofermentative lactic acid bacteria for high level of lactic acid production in ensilages.",Identification of a promoter element mediating kisspeptin-induced increases in GnRH gene expression in sheep.,https://www.ncbi.nlm.nih.gov/pubmed/30853631,Gene,2019 04 15,"Gonadotropin-releasing hormone (GnRH) plays an important role in regulating the activities of other components downstream of the hypothalamic-pituitary-gonadal (HPG) axis and maintaining the normal reproductive cycle of animals. However, the molecular mechanisms by which GnRH synthesis and secretion are regulated in sheep remains unclear. In this study, a series of eight recombinant vectors with deletion fragments were constructed and cotransfected with pGL3-Basic and pRL-SV40 into sheep hypothalamic neuronal cells. After treatment with 1 nM kisspeptin, the core promoter of the sheep GnRH gene was identified to be in the region of -1912 bp to -1461 bp by dual-luciferase reporter assay. Bioinformatics analysis showed that there was a binding site for the transcription factor Otx-2 in the core promoter region (-1786 to -1770 bp) that was highly conserved among different species. The expression patterns of Kiss-1, Otx-2 and GnRH in the sheep hypothalamus were the same, and the expression of Kiss-1, Otx-2 and GnRH was significantly higher in the breeding season than in nonbreeding season (P < 0.01). In addition, when hypothalamic neurons were cultured in vitro with kisspeptin, kisspeptin induced the expression of GnRH and Otx-2. In conclusion, these results provide evidence that the core promoter region (-1786 to -1770 bp) of the GnRH gene is involved in the regulation of hypothalamic activity by kisspeptin and that binding of the transcription factor Otx-2 mediates this activation.",Synthetic biology and metabolic engineering of actinomycetes for natural product discovery.,https://www.ncbi.nlm.nih.gov/pubmed/30853630,Biotechnology advances,2019 03 16,"Actinomycetes are one of the most valuable sources of natural products with industrial and medicinal importance. After more than half a century of exploitation, it has become increasingly challenging to find novel natural products with useful properties as the same known compounds are often repeatedly re-discovered when using traditional approaches. Modern genome mining approaches have led to the discovery of new biosynthetic gene clusters, thus indicating that actinomycetes still harbor a huge unexploited potential to produce novel natural products. In recent years, innovative synthetic biology and metabolic engineering tools have greatly accelerated the discovery of new natural products and the engineering of actinomycetes. In the first part of this review, we outline the successful application of metabolic engineering to optimize natural product production, focusing on the use of multi-omics data, genome-scale metabolic models, rational approaches to balance precursor pools, and the engineering of regulatory genes and regulatory elements. In the second part, we summarize the recent advances of synthetic biology for actinomycetal metabolic engineering including cluster assembly, cloning and expression, CRISPR/Cas9 technologies, and chassis strain development for natural product overproduction and discovery. Finally, we describe new advances in reprogramming biosynthetic pathways through polyketide synthase and non-ribosomal peptide synthetase engineering. These new developments are expected to revitalize discovery and development of new natural products with medicinal and other industrial applications.",The oral nitrate-reducing capacity correlates with peak power output and peak oxygen uptake in healthy humans.,https://www.ncbi.nlm.nih.gov/pubmed/30853629,Nitric oxide : biology and chemistry,2019 06 16,"Interest in inorganic nitrate and nitrite has grown substantially over the past decade as research has revealed the role of these anions in enhancing nitric oxide (NO) availability through an oral pathway. Nitrite synthesis in the mouth seems to be an important mechanism to feed the circulatory system with this anion. This is interesting since greater plasma nitrite concentration has been associated with better fitness levels in humans, but this question has not been investigated in relation to salivary nitrite concentration. Additionally, no previous study has investigated the oral nitrate-reducing capacity in regards to peak oxygen uptake (VO2peak) or peak power output (Wpeak) in humans. Thus, the main goal of this study was to investigate whether salivary nitrite and nitrate concentration and the oral nitrate-reducing capacity were associated with VO2peak and Wpeak in healthy humans. Fifty individuals (22 females and 28 males; 38.8 ± 14.3 years/old; BMI = 22.8 ± 3.9) performed a graded exercise test on a cycle ergometer to assess their VO2peak and Wpeak. Unstimulated salivary samples were taken before and 20 min after exercise to measure nitrate/nitrite, pH and lactate. The oral nitrate-reducing capacity was also assessed in 25 subjects before and after exercise. Oral nitrate-reducing capacity was positively associated with Wpeak (rs = 0.64; P = 0.001) and the VO2peak (rs = 0.54; P = 0.005). Similar correlations were found when these variables were analysed after exercise. In addition, a significant decrease in salivary pH (pre: 7.28 ± 0.361; post-exercise: 7.16 ± 0.33; P = 0.003) accompanied by an increase of salivary lactate (pre: 0.17 ± 0.14 mmol/L; post-exercise: 0.48 ± 0.38; P < 0.001) was found after exercise. However, these changes did not have any impact on salivary nitrate/nitrite concentration and the oral nitrate-reducing capacity after exercise. In conclusion, this is the first evidence showing a link between the oral nitrate-reducing capacity and markers of aerobic fitness levels in healthy humans.",Concrete processing of action metaphors: Evidence from ERP.,https://www.ncbi.nlm.nih.gov/pubmed/30853628,Brain research,2019 04 22,"The timing of sensory-motor activation during the comprehension of action verbs used in a metaphorical sense is not well understood. In the present Event Related Potential (ERP) study, participants read verbs in metaphoric (The church bent the rules), literal-concrete (The bodyguard bent the rod), and literal-abstract (The church altered the rules) conditions. The literal concreteness effect, obtained by subtracting the abstract from the concrete, was revealed as an N400, frontally distributed. A metaphoric effect, obtained in the metaphor-abstract contrast, was a widespread N400, and included the frontal response seen in the literal concreteness effect. Another metaphoric effect, obtained in the metaphor-concrete contrast, was a posterior N400. Further time window analyses showed that the literal concreteness effect primarily came from 200 to 300 ms, the metaphoric-concrete effect primarily came from 200 to 400 ms, and the metaphoric-abstract effect was significant throughout 200-500 ms. These results suggest that a concrete but underspecified meaning consistent with metaphoric and literal readings, was activated early and was sustained throughout the 200-500 ms window. We concluded that the metaphoric sense is based in concrete action semantics, even if these senses are underspecified."

This is particularly important when considering the immune response that may be triggered by the presence of particles in tissue. This report outlines the design of an injectable microsphere system using a low-inflammatory, degradable-polar-hydrophobic-ionic polyurethane, termed D-PHI, and investigates the system's performance in vitro and in vivo. Crosslinked polyurethane microspheres were prepared via a rapid and controlled process based on membrane emulsion and subsequent photopolymerization. The fabrication process efficiently generated microspheres with a narrow size distribution (12 ± 2 μm, PDI = 0.03). The D-PHI microspheres exhibited a slow and controlled degradation and a high capacity for water uptake. Water within the particles existed primarily within the pores of the particles and to a lesser degree within the polymer matrix itself. D-PHI microspheres supported human endothelial and fibroblast cell growth, and they maintained human blood-derived monocytes in a low-inflammatory state. Sub-acute toxicity was assessed for the particles after being administered via intramuscular injection in the gastrocnemius muscle of rats. Cellular infiltration and vascularization into the tissue region where the particles were deposited were observed along with an absence of a fibrous capsule around the particles. The microspheres did not cause elevated human monocyte induced inflammatory character, and supported tissue integration without a prolonged inflammatory response in the rat muscle. These injectable, degradable and low-inflammatory microspheres provide an attractive system for potential drug delivery and tissue regeneration applications in future studies. STATEMENT OF SIGNIFICANCE: Biodegradable, synthetic polymers are attractive candidates for generating tailored drug delivery vehicles and tissue scaffolds owing to their diverse chemical and physical properties that can be customised for delivering defined macromolecules at specific sites in the body. The past two decades have yielded interesting work exploring the fabrication of polymer microspheres with a narrow size distribution. However, the markedly low number of synthetic polymer chemistries currently used for microsphere production exhibit elevated proinflammatory character, both acute and chronic. Furthermore, a limited number of studies have explored the biocompatibility and immune response of polymeric microspheres with human primary cells and in vivo. In the current study, a method was conceived for efficiently generating low-activating polyurethane microspheres with respect to in vitro monocytes and in vivo macrophages. The biodegradable polyurethane, which contained multiple chemistry function and which has previously demonstrated anti-inflammatory properties in film and mm scale scaffold form, was selected as the base material. In this work we undertook the use of a room temperature membrane emulsification photopolymerization approach to avoid the need for high temperature cures and the use of solvents. The response of immune cells to the microspheres was studied with human primary cells and in the rat gastrocnemius muscle. The present work reveals important progress in the design of microspheres, with well-characterized low monocyte-activating properties and the translational advantages of a synthetic polyurethane which could be investigated in future studies for potential macromolecule delivery and tissue regeneration applications.",Bone extracts immunomodulate and enhance the regenerative performance of dicalcium phosphates bioceramics.,https://www.ncbi.nlm.nih.gov/pubmed/30853609,Acta biomaterialia,2019 04 17,"Immunomodulation strategies are believed to improve the integration and clinical performance of synthetic bone substitutes. One potential approach is the modification of biomaterial surface chemistry to mimic bone extracellular matrix (ECM). In this sense, we hypothesized that coating synthetic dicalcium phosphate (DCP) bioceramics with bone ECM proteins would modulate the host immune reactions and improve their regenerative performance. To test this, we evaluated the in vitro proteomic surface interactions and the in vivo performance of ECM-coated bioceramic scaffolds. Our results demonstrated that coating DCP scaffolds with bone extracts, specifically those containing calcium-binding proteins, dramatically modulated their interaction with plasma proteins in vitro, especially those relating to the innate immune response. In vivo, we observed an attenuated inflammatory response against the bioceramic scaffolds and enhanced peri-scaffold new bone formation supported by the increased osteoblastogenesis and reduced osteoclastogenesis. Furthermore, the bone extract rich in calcium-binding proteins can be 3D-printed to produce customized hydrogels with improved regeneration capabilities. In summary, bone extracts containing calcium-binding proteins can enhance the integration of synthetic biomaterials and improve their ability to regenerate bone probably by modulating the host immune reaction. This finding helps understand how bone allografts regenerate bone and opens the door for new advances in tissue engineering and bone regeneration. STATEMENT OF SIGNIFICANCE: Foreign-body reaction is an important determinant of in vivo biomaterial integration, as an undesired host immune response can compromise the performance of an implanted biomaterial. For this reason, applying immunomodulation strategies to enhance biomaterial engraftment is of great interest in the field of regenerative medicine. In this article, we illustrated that coating dicalcium phosphate bioceramic scaffolds with bone-ECM extracts, especially those rich in calcium-binding proteins, is a promising approach to improve their surface proteomic interactions and modulate the immune responses towards such biomaterials in a way that improves their bone regeneration performance. Collectively, the results of this study may provide a conceivable explanation for the mechanisms involved in presenting the excellent regenerative efficacy of natural bone grafts.",MitraClip device for patients with functional mitral valve regurgitation: A systematic review.,https://www.ncbi.nlm.nih.gov/pubmed/30853608,Hellenic journal of cardiology : HJC = Hellenike kardiologike epitheorese,2019 04 01,"MitraClip device is a novel therapeutic option for patients with degenerative mitral valve regurgitation.

LAT1/LAT2 and y+LAT2 are present in astrocytes, neurons and the blood brain barrier (BBB) - forming cerebral vascular endothelial cells (CVEC), while the location of ASCT2 in the individual cell types is a matter of debate. In the healthy brain, contribution of the exchangers to Gln shuttling from astrocytes to neurons and thus their role in controlling the conversion of Gln to the amino acid neurotransmitters l-glutamate (Glu) and γ-aminobutyric acid (GABA) and Gln flux across the BBB appears negligible as compared to the system A and system N uniporters. Insofar, except for the contribution of LAT1 to the maintenance of Gln homeostasis in the interstitial fluid (ISF), no well-defined CNS-specific function has been established for either of the three transporters in the healthy brain. The Gln-accepting amino acid exchangers appear to gain significance under conditions of excessive brain Gln load (glutaminosis). Excess Gln efflux across the BBB enhances influx into the brain of L-tryptophan (Trp). Excess of Trp is responsible for overloading the brain with neuroactive compounds: serotonin, kynurenic acid, quinolinic acid and/or oxindole, which contribute to neurotransmission imbalance accompanying hyperammonemia. In turn, alterations of y+LAT2-mediated Gln/Arg exchange and Arg uptake in astrocyte, modulate astrocytic nitric oxide synthesis and oxidative/nitrosative stress in ammonia-overexposed brain.",Asprosin impairs insulin secretion in response to glucose and viability through TLR4/JNK-mediated inflammation.,https://www.ncbi.nlm.nih.gov/pubmed/30853600,Molecular and cellular endocrinology,2019 03 20,"Severe inflammation in the islets is observed in obese patients with type 2 diabetes. Inflammation in the islets is caused by obesity-induced serum free fatty acids. Asprosin is a fasting-induced adipokine, which contributes to hepatic glucose production. However, the effects of asprosin on inflammation and cellular dysfunction in pancreatic β-cells remain to be elucidated. Here, we demonstrated that treatment of mouse insulinoma MIN6 cells and human primary islets containing β-cells with palmitate increased asprosin expression and secretion. Treatment of MIN6 cells and human primary islets with palmitate increased phosphorylation of the inflammatory marker nuclear factor-kappa B (NFκB) and the release of pro-inflammatory cytokines including TNF and MCP-1 and decreased glucose-stimulated insulin secretion and cell viability. However, siRNA-mediated suppression of asprosin reversed these changes. Recombinant asprosin treatment of MIN6 cells and human primary islets augmented the inflammation response, cellular dysfunction, and apoptosis in a dose-dependent manner. Asprosin induced toll-like receptor (TLR) 4 expression and JNK phosphorylation. siRNA for TLR4 or JNK mitigated the effects of asprosin on inflammation and cellular dysfunction.

Here, adult female C57BL/6 mice were administered IMZ through their drinking water at levels of 0, 0.025‰ and 0.25‰ during the gestation and lactation periods (the exposed females are marked as F0, and the offspring are marked as F1). Then, we evaluated the physiological, biochemical and gene expression levels in mice after maternal IMZ exposure. The genes involved in sex hormone receptors, cholesterol synthesis and T synthesis were generally inhibited, and the serum total cholesterol (TC), high-density lipoprotein cholesterol (HDL-C) and low-density lipoprotein cholesterol (LDL-C) levels were also decreased in the F0 generation female mice. In addition, after F0 IMZ exposure, ovarian androgen receptor (AR) expression was significantly inhibited, and the androgen levels in the serum increased significantly. This may lead to the appearance of progressive virilization during pregnancy. This phenomenon leads to an aromatase deficiency in the F1 generation mice, which results in a decrease in androgen conversion into estrogen and androgen accumulation. In addition, the mRNA expression of key genes and the serum TC, HDL-C, and LDL-C levels increased in the F1 generation after maternal exposure to IMZ. In addition, testicular TC and LDL-C levels also decreased in the F1 generation male mice. Molecular docking analysis revealed that key hydrogen bonds were formed by nitrogen atoms of the imidazole bonds with Trp751 of the ARs. Our data suggests that maternal IMZ exposure could induce endocrine disruption in the next generation of mice."

Rosemary extracts were blended with FUR/GELH film forming solution at different three concentrations (5, 10, 20%). Analyzing the ζ-potential dependences of complexation polysaccharide-protein hydrolysate, we selected optimal ratio for the film formation. The introduction of rosemary extracts into FUR/GELH films increased thickness, water content and tensile strength. The UV barrier properties of tested films improved with the addition of rosemary extracts into FUR/GELH matrix. The antioxidant activity (DPPH and FRAP) did not improved with the addition of FRE but significantly increased with the addition of DRE, reaching 88% of DPPH inhibition and 207 of μmol Trolox/g of dried film of FRAP value. The color changes in different pH were observed, however, the fish spoilage test showed that those films are not suitable as intelligent films for monitoring freshness of this type of food product. Among all films tested, FUR/GELH film with 20% DRE exhibited the best performance.

Biomembranes,2019 03 27,"Bile acids are biosynthesized from cholesterol in hepatocytes and usually localize in the enterohepatic circulation system. This system is regulated by several transporters that are expressed in the liver and intestine. Organic solute transporter (OST) α/β, which is known as a bidirectional transporter for some organic anions, contributes to the transport of bile acids; however, the transport properties of individual bile acids are not well understood. In this study, we investigated the transport properties of five bile acids (cholic acid [CA], chenodeoxycholic acid [CDCA], deoxycholic acid [DCA], ursodeoxycholic acid [UDCA], and lithocholic acid [LCA]) together with their glycine and taurine conjugates mediated by OSTα/β. Of the unconjugated bile acids, CA, CDCA, DCA, and LCA were taken up by OSTαβ/MDCKII cells more rapidly than mock cells, but no significant increase in the uptake of UDCA was observed. On the contrary, all glycine- and taurine-conjugated bile acids showed a significant increase in the uptake by OSTαβ/MDCKII cells. Saturable OSTα/β-mediated transports of CDCA, DCA, glycochenodeoxycholic acid (GCDCA), glycodeoxycholic acid (GDCA), glycolithocholic acid (GLCA), taurochenodeoxycholic acid (TCDCA), and taurolithocholic acid (TLCA) were observed.

In spite of their proven utility, 31P-MRS/MRSI are not often used primarily because of the challenges imposed by the low sensitivity and low concentration of metabolites leading to low signal to noise ratio (SNR), coarse spatial resolution and prolonged acquisition time. More recently there has been considerable interest in compressed sensing as an acceleration method for MR signal acquisition. This approach takes advantage of the intrinsic sparsity of the spectral data. In this work, we present a 31P-MRSI sequence that combines a flyback EPSI trajectory and compressed sensing, and we compared two different reconstruction methods, L1 norm minimization and low rank Hankel matrix completion. Our phantom results showed good preservation of spectral quality for both ×2.0 and ×3.0 acceleration factors, using both CS reconstruction methods. However, in vivo 31P-MRS brain data showed the low rank reconstruction approach was most suitable.

B2M gene knockout and HLA-homozygous iPSC stocks can address this issue, but the former approach may induce NK cell activity and fail to present antigens, and it is challenging to recruit rare donors for the latter method. Here, we show two genome-editing strategies for making immunocompatible donor iPSCs. First, we generated HLA pseudo-homozygous iPSCs with allele-specific editing of HLA heterozygous iPSCs. Second, we generated HLA-C-retained iPSCs by disrupting both HLA-A and -B alleles to suppress the NK cell response while maintaining antigen presentation. HLA-C-retained iPSCs could evade T cells and NK cells in vitro and in vivo.

Using human induced-pluripotent-stem-cell-derived cardiomyocytes (hiPSC-CMs) and MAP4K4 gene silencing, we demonstrate that death induced by oxidative stress requires MAP4K4. Consequently, we devised a small-molecule inhibitor, DMX-5804, that rescues cell survival, mitochondrial function, and calcium cycling in hiPSC-CMs. As proof of principle that drug discovery in hiPSC-CMs may predict efficacy in vivo, DMX-5804 reduces ischemia-reperfusion injury in mice by more than 50%.

RalA was required within ISCs for efficient regeneration downstream of Wnt signaling. Within the murine intestine, genetic deletion of either mammalian ortholog, Rala or Ralb, reduced ISC function and Lgr5 positivity, drove hypersensitivity to Wnt inhibition, and impaired tissue regeneration following damage. Ablation of both genes resulted in rapid crypt death. Mechanistically, RALA and RALB were required for efficient internalization of the Wnt receptor Frizzled-7.

The stability and structural features of the added coconut milk emulsion were studied. Comparing the mechanical emulsifications, coconut milk with maize kernels was similar to coconut milk with high-amylose maize starch. However, coconut milk with a high proportion of amylopectin had the best stability. After ultrasonic treatment, the particle sizes were found to be smaller than those in the nonultrasound-treated coconut milk, and the particles demonstrated a monomodal size distribution. The electronegativity of the compound system was significantly improved. The electronegativity of the maize kernel and high-amylose maize starch-coconut milk systems was significantly decreased, and this change was beneficial to the stability of the systems. However, ultrasonic treatment did not change the fluid type of the coconut milk compound system (which showed pseudoplastic fluid characteristics). The proportion of amylose in maize had an important influence on the stability of the compound system. The apparent viscosity and crystallization order of the high-amylose maize starch-coconut milk system were high. However, the waxy maize starch system showed high complex viscosity and tended to be liquid with ultrasonic treatment. Ultrasound treatment reduced the particle size of coconut milk and homogenized the distribution of the system. Additionally, the amylase of the system contained amylose encapsulated in the interfacial layer after ultrasound treatment. The tiny gel beads formed by waxy maize starch had a good fusion effect on coconut milk fat/protein droplets. The results indicated that the stability of coconut-grain milk composite systems can be enhanced with the use of maize additives and ultrasound irradiation through space effects, electrostatic effects and continuous phase viscosity.","Effects of ultrasonic irradiation on the synthesis, crystallization, thermal and dissolution behaviour of chloride-intercalated, co-precipitated CaFe-layered double hydroxide.",https://www.ncbi.nlm.nih.gov/pubmed/30853533,Ultrasonics sonochemistry,2019 05 20,"The output power (30-150 W) and the periodicity (20-100%) of ultrasound emission were varied in a wide range to regulate and improve the crystallization process in the commonly used co-precipitation technique of chloride-intercalated CaFe-layered double hydroxides. The influence of ultrasound irradiation on the as-prepared materials was studied by X-ray diffractometry, dynamic light scattering, UV-Vis-NIR diffuse reflectance spectroscopy, specific surface area measurement, pore size analysis, ion-selective electrode potentiometric investigations and thermogravimetry. Additionally, structural alterations due to heat treatment at various temperatures were followed in detail by Fourier-transform infrared and X-ray absorption spectroscopies as well as scanning electron microscopy.

The mice were treated with PCA once per day for 3 days, starting immediately after operation. The modified neurological severity score (mNSS) of mice at 1st, 3rd and 7th day after operation were recorded. And some of mice were euthanized at 3rd day to compare brain water content, pro-inflammatory cytokines expression, and cell apoptosis in perihematomal tissue. Additionally, SH-SY5Y cells were treated hemin to mimic secondary injury of ICH. Cells were incubated with PCA for treatment. The cell viability, ROS, apoptosis rate and protein expression of apoptosis-relative protein and MAPKs and NF-κB were detected and analysed. The results revealed PCA alleviated the cerebral oedema at 3rd post ICH, and significantly improved neurological functions. PCA also attenuated the protein and gene expression of TNF-а, IL-1β and IL-6 vivo. PCA dose-dependently decreased the generation of ROS and apoptosis rate. Furthermore, PCA treatment dose-dependently decreased the expression of bax, cleaved caspase-3, increased bcl-2 expression; PCA downregulated P38/JNK-NF-κB pathway. In conclusion, PCA effectively improves prognosis of ICH mice by inhibiting oxidative stress, inflammation and apoptosis. The mechanism possibly results of downregulating of P38/JNK-NF-κB pathway, and PCA can be a potential therapeutic agent for ICH.",Modulation of urinary frequency via type 1 lysophosphatidic acid receptors: Effect of the novel antagonist ASP6432 in conscious rats.,https://www.ncbi.nlm.nih.gov/pubmed/30853531,European journal of pharmacology,2019 05 04,"Bladder dysfunctions associated with benign prostatic hyperplasia are not sufficiently alleviated by current pharmacotherapies.

ASP6432 inhibited the LPA-induced decrease in MI. In contrast, ASP6432 had no effect on the LPA-induced decrease in threshold pressure. Similarly, ASP6432 had no effect on either baseline pressure or maximum intravesical pressure. We also evaluated the effect of ASP6432 on the urinary frequency induced by the nitric oxide synthase inhibitor L-Nω-nitro arginine methyl ester (L-NAME). Intravenous L-NAME administration decreased the micturition interval. ASP6432 dose-dependently reversed the L-NAME-induced decrease in micturition interval. Our findings demonstrate for the first time that LPA causes bladder overactivity in rats. ASP6432 inhibited the LPA- and L-NAME-induced decrease in micturition interval, suggesting a significant role for the LPA1 receptor in regulating the functional capacity of the bladder. Our results also suggest the potential of ASP6432 as a novel therapy for the treatment of bladder dysfunction associated with lower urinary tract diseases.",Critical role of AMPK in redox regulation under glucose starvation.,https://www.ncbi.nlm.nih.gov/pubmed/30853530,Redox biology,2019 03 11,"Glucose starvation is one of the major forms of metabolic stress in cancer cells. Deprivation of glucose impairs glycolysis and the pentose phosphate pathway, which elicits oxidative stress due to enhanced production of reactive oxygen species (ROS) and impaired antioxidant system, leading to redox imbalance and cell death. Under glucose starvation, the 5' AMP-activated protein kinase (AMPK) plays a critical role in maintaining redox homeostasis and cell survival via multiple pathways, such as regulation of fatty acid metabolism and antioxidant response. Convergence of ROS and the glucose metabolic pathway reveals novel molecular targets for the development of effective cancer therapeutic strategies. Interestingly, AMPK, along with its upstream kinase liver kinase B1 (LKB1), has been regarded to play a tumor suppressor role. However, emerging studies have provided novel insights into the pro-tumor survival function of the LKB1-AMPK pathway. Therefore, targeting metabolic and oxidative stress in cancer cells, with manipulation of AMPK activity, is a promising strategy in developing novel cancer therapeutic agents.",Complex sameness: Separation of mixed poly(lactide-co-glycolide)s based on the lactide:glycolide ratio.,https://www.ncbi.nlm.nih.gov/pubmed/30853529,Journal of controlled release : official journal of the Controlled Release Society,2019 04 13,"Poly (lactide-co-glycolide) (PLGA) has been used for making injectable, long-acting depot formulations for the last three decades. An in depth understanding of PLGA polymers is critical for development of depot formulations as their properties control drug release kinetics. To date, about 20 PLGA-based formulations have been approved by the U.S. Food and Drug Administration (FDA) through new drug applications, and none of them have generic counterparts on the market yet. The lack of generic PLGA products is partly due to difficulties in reverse engineering. A generic injectable PLGA product is required to establish qualitative and quantitative (Q1/Q2) sameness of PLGA to that of a reference listed drug (RLD) to obtain an approval from the FDA. Conventional characterizations of PLGA used in a formulation rely on measuring the molecular weight by gel permeation chromatography (GPC) based on polystyrene molecular weight standards, and determining the lactide:glycolide (L: G) ratio by 1H NMR and the end-group by 13C NMR. These approaches, however, may not be suitable or sufficient, if a formulation has more than one type of PLGA, especially when they have similar molecular weights, but different L:G ratios. Accordingly, there is a need to develop new assay methods for separating PLGAs possessing different L:G ratios when used in a drug product and characterizing individual PLGAs. The current work identifies a series of semi-solvents which exhibit varying degrees of PLGA solubility depending on the L:G ratio of the polymer. A good solvent dissolves PLGAs with all L:G ratios ranging from 50:50 to 100:0. A semi-solvent dissolves PLGAs with only certain L:G ratios. Almost all semi-solvents identified in this study increase their PLGA solubility as the L:G ratio increases, i.e., the lactide content increases. This lacto-selectivity, favoring higher L:G ratios, has been applied for separating individual PLGAs in a given depot formulation, leading to analysis of each type of PLGA. This semi-solvent method allows a simple, practical bench-top separation of PLGAs of varying L:G ratios. This method enables isolation and identification of individual PLGAs from a complex mixture that is critical for the quality control of PLGA formulations, as well as reverse engineering for generic products to establish the Q1/Q2 sameness.",Liposomes for delivery of antioxidants in cosmeceuticals: Challenges and development strategies.,https://www.ncbi.nlm.nih.gov/pubmed/30853528,Journal of controlled release : official journal of the Controlled Release Society,2019 04 13,"Antioxidants (AOs) play a crucial role in the protection and maintenance of health and are also integral ingredients in beauty products. Unfortunately, most of them are sensitive due to their instability and insolubility. The use of liposomes to protect AOs and expand their applicability to cosmeceuticals, thereby, is one of the most effective solutions. Notwithstanding their offered advantages for the delivery of AOs, liposomes, in their production and application, present many challenges. Here, we provide a critical review of the major problems complicating the development of liposomes for AO delivery. Along with issues related to preparation techniques and encapsulation efficiency, the loss of protective function and inefficiency of skin permeability are the main disadvantages of liposomes. Corresponding development strategies for resolving these problems, with their respective advantages and drawbacks, are introduced, discussed in some depth, and summarized in these pages as well. Advanced liposomes have a vital role to play in the development and delivery of AOs in practical cosmeceutical product applications.",Pore-forming bioinks to enable spatio-temporally defined gene delivery in bioprinted tissues.,https://www.ncbi.nlm.nih.gov/pubmed/30853527,Journal of controlled release : official journal of the Controlled Release Society,2019 05 04,"The regeneration of complex tissues and organs remains a major clinical challenge. With a view towards bioprinting such tissues, we developed a new class of pore-forming bioink to spatially and temporally control the presentation of therapeutic genes within bioprinted tissues. By blending sacrificial and stable hydrogels, we were able to produce bioinks whose porosity increased with time following printing. When combined with amphipathic peptide-based plasmid DNA delivery, these bioinks supported enhanced non-viral gene transfer to stem cells in vitro. By modulating the porosity of these bioinks, it was possible to direct either rapid and transient (pore-forming bioinks), or slower and more sustained (solid bioinks) transfection of host or transplanted cells in vivo. To demonstrate the utility of these bioinks for the bioprinting of spatially complex tissues, they were next used to zonally position stem cells and plasmids encoding for either osteogenic (BMP2) or chondrogenic (combination of TGF-β3, BMP2 and SOX9) genes within networks of 3D printed thermoplastic fibers to produce mechanically reinforced, gene activated constructs. In vivo, these bioprinted tissues supported the development of a vascularised, bony tissue overlaid by a layer of stable cartilage. When combined with multiple-tool biofabrication strategies, these gene activated bioinks can enable the bioprinting of a wide range of spatially complex tissues."

To increase the residence time of CLX-based formulations at the application site and consequently reduce the daily dose frequency, new formulations composed of mucoadhesive polymers should be designed. The objective of this work was the development of matrices based on polyanionic polymers, such as sodium alginate, carboxymethylcellulose, xanthan gum and sodium hyaluronate, aimed to prolong the local release of CLX into the buccal or vaginal cavity. Matrices were prepared by freeze-drying and comply with 2 different preparative methods and characterized in terms of resistance to compression, water uptake ability, mucoadhesion, in vitro drug release behavior and antimicrobial activity toward representative pathogens of buccal and vaginal cavities. Results showed that the selection of suitable polymers associated to the adequate preparative method allowed to modulate matrix ability to hydrate, adhere to the mucosa and release the drug as well as to exert antimicrobial activity. In particular, matrix based on sodium hyaluronate was found to be the best performing formulation and could represent a versatile system for local release of CLX with potential application in both buccal and vaginal cavities.",Genomic characterization of hepatitis C virus transmitted founder variants with deep sequencing.,https://www.ncbi.nlm.nih.gov/pubmed/30853512,"Infection, genetics and evolution : journal of molecular epidemiology and evolutionary genetics in infectious diseases",2019 06 10,"Transfer of hepatitis C virus (HCV) infection from a donor to a new recipient is associated with a bottleneck of genetic diversity in the transmitted viral variants. Existing data suggests that one, or very few, variants emerge from this bottleneck to establish the infection (transmitted founder [T/F] variants). In HCV, very few T/F variants have been characterized due to the challenges of obtaining early infection samples and of high throughput viral genome sequencing. This study used a large, acute HCV, deep-sequenced dataset from first viremia samples collected in nine prospective cohorts across four countries, to estimate the prevalence of single T/F viruses, and to identify host and virus-related factors associated with infections initiated by a single T/F variant. The short reads generated by Illumina sequencing were used to reconstruct viral haplotypes with two haplotype reconstruction algorithms. The haplotypes were examined for random mutations (Poisson distribution) and a star-like phylogeny to identify T/F viruses. The findings were cross-validated by haplotype reconstructions across three regions of the genome (Core-E2, NS3, NS5A) to minimize the possibility of spurious overestimation of single T/F variants. Of 190 acute infection samples examined, 54 were very early acute infections (HCV antibody negative, RNA positive), and single transmitted founders were identified in 14 (26%, 95% CI: 16-39%) after cross validation across multiple regions of the genome with two haplotype reconstruction algorithms. The presence of a single T/F virus was not associated with any host or virus-related factors, notably viral genotype or spontaneous clearance. In conclusion, approximately one in four new HCV infections originates from a single T/F virus. Resolution of genomic sequences of single T/F variants is the first step in exploring unique properties of these variants in the infection of host hepatocytes.",Implementing Evidence-Based Care for Women Who Have Experienced Human Trafficking.,https://www.ncbi.nlm.nih.gov/pubmed/30853510,Nursing for women's health,2019 04 12,"Human trafficking is a significant women's health issue in the United States. Clinicians who provide care to women are often unaware of the signs and symptoms of human trafficking and are unprepared to provide appropriate care. Nurses represent one of the few agents of change who women may encounter while they are in captivity; this places nurses at the forefront of their care. To provide safe and effective care, nurses can use the ABCD treatment model, which stands for assessment, buy-in, case management, and diversion programming. Any gaps between recognition of women's health care needs and the provision of appropriate care must be closed.

Whether individuals with increased central sensitization early in their condition are more likely to develop persistent pain or whether it increases over time is unclear. This study aimed to determine whether sensory profiles during acute LBP differ between individuals who did and did not recover by 6 months and to identify subgroups associated with outcomes. Individuals with acute LBP (<2 weeks of onset; N = 99) underwent pain threshold (heat/cold/pressure) and conditioned pain modulation testing after completing questionnaires related to pain/disability, sleep, and psychological status. Sensory measures were compared during the acute phase (baseline) and longitudinally (baseline/6 months) between unrecovered (greater or unchanged pain and disability), partially recovered (improved but not recovered pain and/or disability), and recovered (no pain and disability) participants at 6 months. We assessed baseline patterns of sensory sensitivity alone, and with psychological and sleep data, using hierarchical clustering and related the clusters to outcome (pain/disability) at 3 and 6 months. No sensory measure at either time point differed between groups. Two subgroups were identified that associated with more (""high sensitivity"") or less (""high sensitivity and negative psychological state"") recovery. These data seem to suggest that central sensitization during the acute phase resolves for many patients, but is a precursor to the transition to chronicity when combined with other psychological features. PERSPECTIVE: Central sensitization signs during early acute LBP does not necessarily precede poor outcome, but may be sustained in conjunction with other psychological factors and facilitate pain persistence.",Lack of Antinociceptive Cross-Tolerance With Co-Administration of Morphine and Fentanyl Into the Periaqueductal Gray of Male Sprague-Dawley Rats.,https://www.ncbi.nlm.nih.gov/pubmed/30853505,The journal of pain : official journal of the American Pain Society,2019 04 06,"Tolerance to the antinociceptive effect of mu-opioid receptor agonists, such as morphine and fentanyl, greatly limits their effectiveness for long-term use to treat pain. Clinical studies have shown that combination therapy and opioid rotation can be used to enhance opioid-induced antinociception once tolerance has developed. The mechanism and brain regions involved in these processes are unknown. The purpose of this study was to evaluate the contribution of the ventrolateral periaqueductal gray (vlPAG) to antinociceptive tolerance and cross-tolerance between administration and co-administration of morphine and fentanyl. Tolerance was induced by pretreating rats with morphine or fentanyl or low-dose combination of morphine and fentanyl into the vlPAG followed by an assessment of the cross-tolerance to the other opioid. In addition, tolerance to the combined treatment was assessed. Cross-tolerance did not develop between repeated vlPAG microinjections of morphine and fentanyl. Likewise, there was no evidence of cross-tolerance from morphine or fentanyl to the co-administration of morphine and fentanyl. Co-administration did not cause cross-tolerance to fentanyl. Cross-tolerance was only evident to morphine or morphine and fentanyl combined in rats pretreated with co-administration of low doses of morphine and fentanyl. This finding is consistent with the functionally selective signaling that has been reported for antinociception and tolerance after morphine and fentanyl binding to the mu-opioid receptor. This research supports the notion that combination therapy and opioid rotation may be useful clinical practices to decrease opioid tolerance and other side effects. PERSPECTIVE: This preclinical study shows that there is a decrease in cross-tolerance between morphine and fentanyl within the periaqueductal gray, which is a key brain region in opioid antinociception and tolerance.",Zika virus infection in travellers returning to the United Kingdom during the period of the outbreak in the Americas (2016-17): A retrospective analysis.,https://www.ncbi.nlm.nih.gov/pubmed/30853504,Travel medicine and infectious disease,2019 06 16,"In 2016, Zika virus (ZIKV) spread rapidly throughout the Americas and Caribbean in an explosive outbreak.

The aim of this study was to produce microspheres of biodegradable polylactic-co-glycolic acid (PLGA) tailored to achieve sustained release of VEGF at an appropriate concentration over seven days, avoiding excessive unregulated release of VEGF that has been associated with the formation of leaky blood vessels. Several formulations were examined to produce microspheres loaded with both human serum albumin (HSA) and VEGF to achieve release of VEGF between 3 and 10 ng per ml for seven days to match the therapeutic window desired for angiogenesis. In vitro experiments showed an increase in endothelial cell proliferation in response to microspheres bearing VEGF. Similarly, when microspheres containing VEGF were added to the chorionic membrane of fertilised chicken eggs, there was an increase in the development of blood vessels over seven days in response, which was significant for microspheres bearing VEGF and HSA, but not VEGF alone. There was an increase in both blood vessel density and branching - both signs of proangiogenic activity. Further, there was clearly migration of cells to the VEGF loaded microspheres. In summary, we describe the development of an injectable delivery vehicle to achieve spatiotemporal release of physiologically relevant levels of VEGF for several days and demonstrate the angiogenic response to this.

In the arthroscopic armamentarium, another scope, unknown to many surgeons, is also available: the 45° arthroscope. His field of view provides a wider intraoperative view than that of a 30° scope without the characteristic blind spot of a 70° scope. Therefore, the surgeon's orientation is not compromised. because the optic has always an element of forward vision. With these advantages, the 45° scope can be used in all knee surgical procedures without the need for having two scopes sterilized on the surgical table with less risk of contamination and less surgical time. The 45° scope may also be valuable for the arthroscopic surgery of other joints with the same advantages.",MicroRNA-34a Promotes Renal Fibrosis by Downregulation of Klotho in Tubular Epithelial Cells.,https://www.ncbi.nlm.nih.gov/pubmed/30853453,Molecular therapy : the journal of the American Society of Gene Therapy,2019 06 10,"Renal fibrosis is the main pathological characteristic of chronic kidney disease (CKD), whereas the underlying mechanisms of renal fibrosis are not clear yet. Herein, we found an increased expression of microRNA-34a (miR-34a) in renal tubular epithelial cells of patients with renal fibrosis and mice undergoing unilateral ureteral obstruction (UUO). In miR-34a-/- mice, miR-34a deficiency attenuated the progression of renal fibrosis following UUO surgery. The miR-34a overexpression promoted epithelial-to-mesenchymal transition (EMT) in cultured human renal tubular epithelial HK-2 cells, which was accompanied by sharp downregulation of Klotho, an endogenous inhibitor of renal fibrosis. Luciferase reporter assay revealed that miR-34a downregulated Klotho expression though direct binding with the 3' UTR of Klotho. Conversely, overexpression of Klotho prevented miR-34a-induced EMT in HK-2 cells. Furthermore, results showed that miR-34a was induced by transforming growth factor β1 (TGF-β1) through p53 activation, whereas dihydromyricetin could inhibit TGF-β1-induced miR-34a overexpression. Accordingly, dihydromyricetin administration dramatically restored the aberrant upregulation of miR-34a and Klotho reduction in obstructed kidney, and markedly ameliorated renal fibrosis in the Adriamycin nephropathy and UUO model mice. These findings suggested that miR-34a plays an important role in the progression of renal fibrosis, which provides new insights into the pathogenesis and treatment of CKD.",Instruments assessing parental responsive feeding in children ages birth to 5 years: A systematic review.,https://www.ncbi.nlm.nih.gov/pubmed/30853452,Appetite,2019 04 29,"Responsive feeding of young children has been identified as a protective factor against the development of childhood obesity. Instruments developed to assess responsive feeding by parents of children birth to 5 years of age over the past 17 years were reviewed using the Preferred Reporting Items for Systematic Reviews and Meta-Analyses (PRISMA) checklist. Four electronic databases (PubMed, CINAHL, PsycINFO, and Scopus) were used to search for relevant articles to include at least one parental responsive feeding category (Food Rewards, Pressure to Eat, Parental Control of Intake, Emotional Feeding, or Responsiveness to Cues/Child Autonomy), development, validation, or reliability of the instrument, and evaluated in at least one child between ages birth to 5 years old. The final review included 33 individual responsive feeding related instruments. Risk of bias for each article was assessed using the Risk of Bias in Non-randomized Studies (ROBINS-I) assessment tool. Of the 15 instruments intended for birth to 2-year-olds and the 28 intended for 3- to 5-year-olds, only three instruments showed rigorous validation and reliability testing (Feeding Practices and Structure Questionnaire, Comprehensive Feeding Practices Questionnaire, and Family Food Behavior Survey). The most commonly reported psychometric testing was construct validity and internal reliability. There were limited instruments intended for young children (birth to 2 years), low-income, diverse racial and ethnic groups (Hispanic and non-Hispanic black), and fathers or other caregivers. The most frequently assessed feeding practices included Pressure to Eat, Parental Control, and Food Rewards, but none of the instruments assessed all aspects of responsive feeding. This review identified the need for more comprehensive instruments that measure all aspects of responsive feeding, the need for further testing in diverse populations, and further validity and reliability testing.",Differences in parental feeding styles and practices and toddler eating behaviour across complementary feeding methods: Managing expectations through consideration of effect size.,https://www.ncbi.nlm.nih.gov/pubmed/30853451,Appetite,2019 03 31,"Nutritional experiences during infancy and toddlerhood influence the development of healthy eating habits later in life. Interest into solid food introduction practices has experienced resurgence due to the popularization of the baby-led weaning (BLW) approach as an alternative to more traditional parent-led weaning (PLW) practices. Although the literature shows beneficial effects of BLW on eating behaviours, the magnitude of those effects is unknown making parental expectation management challenging. This study provides an estimation of the size of the difference between the solid feeding practices groups for a variety of practices consistent with the development of healthy food preferences and behaviours. 565 participants with infants between 12 and 36 months old completed a survey concerning their preferred parental feeding styles, parental feeding practices, sources of information on feeding and toddler's eating behaviour. Participants were categorised to one of four groups reflecting the level of infant self-feeding level a month after the introduction of solid food (Strict PLW, Predominant PLW, Predominant BLW and Strict BLW). Estimated effect sizes of the observed significant differences showed that the magnitude of effects was modest to minimal. Moderate effect sizes were observed in comparisons regarding breastfeeding duration, maternal feeding practices, sources of information and types of first food given to the infants at the beginning of solid feeding introduction. When it comes to toddlers' eating behaviour and the family food environment, although some differences were statistically significant, the effect sizes were very small. Considering the long-lasting impact of food preferences developed at this stage along with the stress surrounding infant feeding decisions, it is crucial that the complementary feeding advice parents receive reflects realistic expectations of the outcomes regarding the effects on eating behaviour.",First molecular evidence of ocular transmission of Encephalitozoonosis during the intrauterine period in rabbits.,https://www.ncbi.nlm.nih.gov/pubmed/30853450,Parasitology international,2019 05 15,"Many reports have been published on the suspected vertical transmission of Encephalitozoon cuniculi; however, prior to 2003, these reports were based on circumstantial evidence, such as histopathological, immunohistochemical, or serological diagnosis of the infection. In 2003, vertical transmission of the parasite was confirmed by detection of E. cuniculi DNA in fetuses with the nested polymerase chain reaction (PCR) technique. However, the passage of the parasite to eyes of fetus during the intrauterine stage still requires verification. In the current study, natively infected with parasite spores female rabbits were mated with non-infected males. All resulting offspring that died before ten postpartum days were investigated using molecular techniques to confirm the intrauterine transmission of the parasite to the offspring' eyes. In total, 119 DNA samples from rabbit offspring tissues were collected from blood, kidney, brain, eye (both eyes were used as single samples), lung, placenta, liver and heart were used for PCR. Parasitic DNA in the eyes of offspring was detected (54%) 6 of 11 naturally seropositive mother rabbits. PCR results were found to be positive for the eyes of 63% (19/30) of the offsprings from seropositive rabbits. Therefore, mother rabbits naturally infected with E. cuniculi showed the molecular presence of the parasite in their offspring' eyes. Sequence analysis confirmed the partial DNA sequence data of E. cuniculi and blast analysis identified the agent as genotype I. These results confirm transmission of E. cuniculi to rabbit offspring' eyes in the intrauterine period. This is the first molecular evidence to show ocular transmission of the infection via an intrauterine route in rabbits.",Ultrastructure of the anterior adhesive apparatus of the gill parasite Macrogyrodactylus clarii and skin parasite M. congolensis (Monogenea; Gyrodactylidae) from the catfish Clarias gariepinus.,https://www.ncbi.nlm.nih.gov/pubmed/30853449,Parasitology international,2019 05 15,"Transmission electron microscopy (TEM) was used for the first time to study the anterior adhesive apparatus of the monogeneans Macrogyrodactylus clarii Gussev, 1961 and M. congolensis (Prudhoe, 1957) Yamaguti, 1963 inhabiting gills and skin respectively of the same catfish Clarias gariepinus. Despite the different microhabitats occupied by these parasites, the present study revealed that they have a similar anterior adhesive system. In both parasites, the anterior adhesive apparatus consists of three types of gland cells: G1 cells that produce rod-shaped bodies (S1), G2 cells manufacture irregularly shaped bodies (S2) and G3 cells form mucoid-like secretions (S3). In the cytoplasm of G1 cells, a single layer of microtubules encloses each developing rod-shaped body. A unique feature of S1 secretory bodies is that some fully developed S1 bodies are attached to each other, forming large condensed globules in the cytoplasm of G1 gland cells and terminal portion of the G1 ducts, but none were detected in the adhesive sacs outside the ducts. In the adhesive sacs, G1 ducts open with multiple apertures whereas each of the G2 and G3 ducts have a single opening. The adhesive sacs are lined with two types of tegument (st1 and st2). A third tegument type (st3) connects the st2 tegument with the general body tegument. Only st1 has microvilli. Each adhesive sac is provided with a spike-like sensillum and single uniciliated sense organ. The possible functions of microvilli in increasing the surface area and assistance in spreading and mixing of the adhesive secretion, and the role of sense organs associated with the adhesive sacs are discussed.",The association between GAD65 antibody levels and incident Type 2 Diabetes Mellitus in an adult population: A meta-analysis.,https://www.ncbi.nlm.nih.gov/pubmed/30853448,Metabolism: clinical and experimental,2019 05 12,"Antibodies to the 65 kD isoform of glutamic acid decarboxylase (GAD65) have been associated with incident Type 2 Diabetes Mellitus, however results are inconsistent.",MiR-1a-3p mitigates isoproterenol-induced heart failure by enhancing the expression of mitochondrial ND1 and COX1.,https://www.ncbi.nlm.nih.gov/pubmed/30853447,Experimental cell research,2019 03 20,"MicroRNAs (miRNAs) have become potential targets for the treatment of heart failure (HF). It has been shown that miR-1 can reverse cardiac hypertrophy during the compensatory phase of HF development, but it is unknown whether miR-1 can still reverse cardiac dysfunction and improve cardiac remodeling after HF progresses to the decompensation stage. We established a mouse model of isoproterenol-induced HF and then injected miR-1a-3p agomir (agomir-1) into the tail vein. Echocardiography showed that the mice treated with agomir-1 had significantly increased ejection fraction and fractional shortening. These mice also showed a decrease in the N-terminal pro-B type natriuretic peptide (NT-proBNP) levels, but this remained higher than in controls. Cardiac hypertrophy, myocardial fibrosis, apoptosis, and glycogen deposition were reduced in mice treated with agomir-1. Furthermore, we found that supplementation of agomir-1 increased the expression of two mitochondrial DNA-encoded proteins, mitochondrially encoded NADH dehydrogenase 1 (ND1) and mitochondrially encoded cytochrome c oxidase I (COX1). In conclusion, our study found that miR-1a-3p alleviated the symptoms of ISO-induced HF in mice by enhancing mitochondrial ND1 and COX1. The results of this work may provide new therapeutic strategies for the treatment of HF patients.",Integrin intracellular machinery in action.,https://www.ncbi.nlm.nih.gov/pubmed/30853446,Experimental cell research,2019 04 02,"Integrin-mediated adhesion to the extracellular matrix involves a surprisingly large number of intracellular proteins, the integrin-associated proteins (IAPs), which are a fraction of the total integrin adhesome.

We then begin the process of assembling IAP roles together into an integrated mechanism."

The pattern displays a global distortion that is well described by a shearing transformation of an idealized grid [2]. However, in addition, distortions often differ across parts of the environment, suggesting that the grid interacts with the environment locally [2-5]. How this occurs is poorly understood. To further determine the nature of local distortions, we therefore analyzed the local spatial characteristics of the grid pattern. When rats ran in a large square enclosure, the grid pattern displayed several stereotypical distortions in relation to features of the environment. These distortions were stronger at edges than on open surfaces. Curved axis orientations and distortions of the grid pattern in the corners could be explained by a geometrical model where the pattern, in conjunction with being sheared, is compressed along the walls of the enclosure. The grid compression coincided with stereotypical running behavior where the animals moved faster in the areas where the grid had the most pronounced distortions. However, neither running direction nor speed influenced the distortions on a moment-to-moment basis, raising the possibility that the distortions are a learned feature.",Rapid Change in Mammalian Eye Shape Is Explained by Activity Pattern.,https://www.ncbi.nlm.nih.gov/pubmed/30853430,Current biology : CB,2019 03 19,"The rate of morphological evolution along the branches of a phylogeny varies widely [1-6]. Although such rate variation is often assumed to reflect the strength of historical natural selection resulting in adaptation [7-14], this lacks empirical and analytical evidence. One way to demonstrate a relationship between branchwise rates and adaptation would be to show that rapid rates of evolution are linked with ecological shifts or key innovations. Here, we test for this link by determining whether activity pattern, the time of day at which species are active, explains rapid bursts of evolutionary change in eye shape. Using modern approaches to identify shifts in the rate of morphological evolution [7, 13], we find that over 74% of rapid eye-shape change during mammalian evolutionary history is directly explained by distinct selection pressures acting on nocturnal, cathemeral, and diurnal species. Our results reveal how ecological changes occurring along the branches of a phylogeny can manifest in subsequent changes in the rate of morphological evolution. Although selective pressures exerted by different activity patterns have acted uniformly across all mammals, we find differences in the rate of eye-shape evolution among orders. The key to understanding this is in how ecology itself has evolved. We find heterogeneity in how activity pattern has evolved among mammals that ultimately led to differences in the rate of eye-shape evolution among species. Our approach represents an exciting new way to pinpoint factors driving adaptation, enabling a clearer understanding of the factors that drive the evolution of biological diversity.",Protease activated receptor-2 mediated upregulation of IL-17 receptor signaling on airway epithelial cells is responsible for neutrophilic infiltration during acute exposure of house dust mite allergens in mice.,https://www.ncbi.nlm.nih.gov/pubmed/30853428,Chemico-biological interactions,2019 05 13,"Asthma, a chronic inflammatory disease affecting the airways is primarily caused due to immune system dysfunction. Different inhaled allergens such as house dust mites (HDM), fungi, cockroach allergens are the main contributors to allergic asthma. Protease activated receptor-2 (PAR-2) signaling plays an important role in allergic asthma through modulation of immune mediators in airway epithelial cells (AECs). Interleukin-17A (IL-17A) signals via subunits of IL-17 receptor (IL-17R), i.e. interleukin-17 receptor A (IL-17RA) and interleukin-17 receptor C (IL-17RC), and plays a necessary role in neutrophilic infiltration in response to infectious/allergenic stimuli, however it is not known if PAR-2 activation affects IL-17A/IL-17R signaling during acute exposure to house dust mite (HDM) allergens. Therefore, our study exposed mice to HDM allergens for five days and evaluated its effect on IL-17A/IL-17R signaling, chemokine/cytokines and neutrophilic inflammation in mice. Our study shows that HDM allergens upregulate IL-17A levels in the lung and IL-17RA/IL-17RC expression in AECs. PAR-2 activation by trypsin also upregulates neutrophilic influx and IL-17A/IL-17R signaling in the lung. Upregulated IL-17A/IL-17R signaling was associated with increased BAL neutrophils, pulmonary MPO activity and proinflammatory chemokines and cytokines (IL-23, IL-6, and MCP-1 in AECs/lung) in HDM exposed mice. Further, HDM-induced IL-17A, IL-17R and chemokines/cytokines were attenuated by PAR-2 antagonist, ENMD-1068. Furthermore, HDM-primed mice treated with IL-17A had greater neutrophilic inflammation and higher levels of inflammatory cytokines/chemokines than PBS-exposed mice treated with IL-17A. This proposes that acute exposure to HDM allergens activate AECs at a very early stage where PAR-2/IL-17R signaling serves a crucial role in neutrophilic inflammation.",Identifying Factors That Predict the Prescription of Non-vitamin K Antagonist Oral Anticoagulants in Older Individuals With Atrial Fibrillation.,https://www.ncbi.nlm.nih.gov/pubmed/30853427,Journal of the American Medical Directors Association,2019 03 11,Factors that influence decision of non-vitamin K antagonist oral anticoagulants (NOACs) use among older atrial fibrillation (AF) patients in long-term care (LTC) facilities have not been well studied.

The cases included were those in which the snake was brought to HVB and was correctly identified. Of the 86 cases of snake bites, it was possible to describe the sex of the snake in 52 cases; 31 (59.6%) snakes were male. Only 52 snakes out of 86 could be studied because of their preservation status. The length of snakes (snout-vent length) ranged from 180 to 770 mm. Of the 86 snakes, 72 could be distinguished as adults (n = 63, 87.5%) or juveniles (n = 9, 12.5%). Most bites occurred in the spring and summer seasons (n = 57, 66.3%) and during warmer periods of the day (n = 61, 72.6%), between 9 a.m. and 3 p.m. The mean (±standard deviation) age of the victims was 26.9 ± 17.2 years, and 60 (69.8%) were men. Approximately 90% of the patients sought medical care within 6 h after the bite.

Our previous study found that NA inhibited the spontaneous simple spikes activity of cerebellar Purkinje cells (PC) through activation of molecular layer interneurons (MLIs) in vivo in mice. We here examined the effects of NA on spontaneous complex spikes (CSs) activity of cerebellar PC in urethane-anesthetized mice by electrophysiology recording technique and pharmacological methods. Our results showed that cerebellar surface perfusion of NA significantly reduced the number of spikelets and the area under curve (AUC) of the spontaneous CSs. Application of nonselective adrenergic receptor (AR) antagonist, phentolamine, abolished the NA-induced inhibition of CSs. However applying a nonselective β-AR blocker, propranolol, failed to prevent the NA-induced inhibition of CSs activity. The NA-induced inhibition of CSs activity was not blocked by α1-AR antagonist, prazosin, but it was abolished by α2-AR antagonist, yohimibine. Moreover, application of α2-AR agonist, UK14304 induced a depression of CSs activity and mimicked the NA-induced inhibition of CS activity. These results indicate that NA regulates spontaneous CSs activity of cerebellar PCs via activation of α2-AR in vivo in mice.

In this study, we investigated the effect of BrdU injections on locomotor behavior in a rodent model of ischemic stroke. Ischemic strokes were induced in adult rats, and 50 mg/kg BrdU was intraperitoneally injected over 5 days beginning 2 weeks post-stroke, while control animals received vehicle. Locomotor activity was evaluated by videotaping the rats in their home cages for 30 min, beginning one hour after BrdU injection. BrdU-injected rats showed a nearly three-fold increase in locomotor activity compared to control animals. These findings suggest that BrdU induces a hyperlocomotor effect in rats following brain injury, pointing to the need for caution when interpreting behavioral results in such studies.",2018 Clinical Update in Liver Transplantation.,https://www.ncbi.nlm.nih.gov/pubmed/30853406,Journal of cardiothoracic and vascular anesthesia,2019 03 11,"Liver transplantation (LT) continues to be the gold standard for treating end-stage liver disease, and challenges that are posed to the anesthesiologist during transplantation are well known. Successful liver transplantation requires knowledge, recognition, and treatment of hemodynamic and metabolic disturbances by the anesthesiologist. End-stage liver disease causes unique derangements to the clotting cascade, increasing risk both for hemorrhagic and thrombotic events. Cirrhotic cardiomyopathy may be masked for years because of low systemic vascular resistance in cirrhosis, and overt heart failure can be precipitated by LT. Surveys of high-volume transplant centers show an overall transesophageal echocardiography (TEE) use rate of 95%. Guidelines on the use of TEE in LT have mirrored safety findings in several studies and suggest TEE may be used for patients with esophageal varices if the benefit outweighs the risk. This review will cover organ system dysfunction in liver cirrhosis and the implications for liver cirrhosis patients and review recent advances in pathophysiology and treatments. In addition, the authors will highlight the concept of enhanced recovery after surgery and how it pertains to the LT patient population. Lastly, the authors review recent advances in organ preservation and optimization.",Ventilatory Efficiency Identifies Patients Prone to Hypoxemia During One-Lung Ventilation.,https://www.ncbi.nlm.nih.gov/pubmed/30853404,Journal of cardiothoracic and vascular anesthesia,2019 06 08,"One-lung ventilation (OLV) may be complicated by hypoxemia. Ventilatory efficiency, defined as the ratio of minute ventilation to carbon dioxide output (VE/VCO2), is increased with ventilation/perfusion mismatch and pulmonary artery hypertension, both of which may be associated with hypoxemia. Hence, the authors hypothesized increased VE/VCO2 will predict hypoxemia during OLV.",Mutation in NADPH oxidase 3 (NOX3) impairs SHH signaling and increases cerebellar neural stem/progenitor cell proliferation.,https://www.ncbi.nlm.nih.gov/pubmed/30853403,Biochimica et biophysica acta. Molecular basis of disease,2019 05 06,"Abnormalities in cerebellar structure and function may cause ataxia, a neurological dysfunction of motor coordination. In the course of the present study, we characterized a mutant mouse lineage with an ataxia-like phenotype. We localized the mutation on chromosome 17 and mapped it to position 1534 of the Nox3 gene, resulting in p.Asn64Tyr change. The primary defect observed in Nox3eqlb mice was increased proliferation of cerebellar granule cell precursors (GCPs). cDNA microarray comparing Nox3eqlb and BALB/c neonatal cerebellum revealed changes in the expression of genes involved in the control of cell proliferation. Nox3eqlb GCPs and NSC produce higher amounts of reactive oxygen species (ROS) and upregulate the expression of SHH target genes, such as Gli1-3 and Ccnd1 (CyclinD1). We hypothesize that this new mutation is responsible for an increase in proliferation via stimulation of the SHH pathway. We suggest this mutant mouse lineage as a new model to investigate the role of ROS in neuronal precursor cell proliferation.",The Cargo Receptor NDP52 Initiates Selective Autophagy by Recruiting the ULK Complex to Cytosol-Invading Bacteria.,https://www.ncbi.nlm.nih.gov/pubmed/30853402,Molecular cell,2019 04 28,"Xenophagy, a selective autophagy pathway that protects the cytosol against bacterial invasion, relies on cargo receptors that juxtapose bacteria and phagophore membranes. Whether phagophores are recruited from a constitutive pool or are generated de novo at prospective cargo remains unknown. Phagophore formation in situ would require recruitment of the upstream autophagy machinery to prospective cargo. Here, we show that, essential for anti-bacterial autophagy, the cargo receptor NDP52 forms a trimeric complex with FIP200 and SINTBAD/NAP1, which are subunits of the autophagy-initiating ULK and the TBK1 kinase complex, respectively. FIP200 and SINTBAD/NAP1 are each recruited independently to bacteria via NDP52, as revealed by selective point mutations in their respective binding sites, but only in their combined presence does xenophagy proceed. Such recruitment of the upstream autophagy machinery by NDP52 reveals how detection of cargo-associated ""eat me"" signals, induction of autophagy, and juxtaposition of cargo and phagophores are integrated in higher eukaryotes.",Spatiotemporal Control of ULK1 Activation by NDP52 and TBK1 during Selective Autophagy.,https://www.ncbi.nlm.nih.gov/pubmed/30853401,Molecular cell,2019 04 19,"Selective autophagy recycles damaged organelles and clears intracellular pathogens to prevent their aberrant accumulation. How ULK1 kinase is targeted and activated during selective autophagic events remains to be elucidated. In this study, we used chemically inducible dimerization (CID) assays in tandem with CRISPR KO lines to systematically analyze the molecular basis of selective autophagosome biogenesis. We demonstrate that ectopic placement of NDP52 on mitochondria or peroxisomes is sufficient to initiate selective autophagy by focally localizing and activating the ULK1 complex. The capability of NDP52 to induce mitophagy is dependent on its interaction with the FIP200/ULK1 complex, which is facilitated by TBK1. Ectopically tethering ULK1 to cargo bypasses the requirement for autophagy receptors and TBK1. Focal activation of ULK1 occurs independently of AMPK and mTOR. Our findings provide a parsimonious model of selective autophagy, which highlights the coordination of ULK1 complex localization by autophagy receptors and TBK1 as principal drivers of targeted autophagosome biogenesis.",FIP200 Claw Domain Binding to p62 Promotes Autophagosome Formation at Ubiquitin Condensates.,https://www.ncbi.nlm.nih.gov/pubmed/30853400,Molecular cell,2019 05 08,"The autophagy cargo receptor p62 facilitates the condensation of misfolded, ubiquitin-positive proteins and their degradation by autophagy, but the molecular mechanism of p62 signaling to the core autophagy machinery is unclear. Here, we show that disordered residues 326-380 of p62 directly interact with the C-terminal region (CTR) of FIP200. Crystal structure determination shows that the FIP200 CTR contains a dimeric globular domain that we designated the ""Claw"" for its shape. The interaction of p62 with FIP200 is mediated by a positively charged pocket in the Claw, enhanced by p62 phosphorylation, mutually exclusive with the binding of p62 to LC3B, and it promotes degradation of ubiquitinated cargo by autophagy. Furthermore, the recruitment of the FIP200 CTR slows the phase separation of ubiquitinated proteins by p62 in a reconstituted system. Our data provide the molecular basis for a crosstalk between cargo condensation and autophagosome formation.",Which patients are less likely to improve after arthroscopic rotator cuff repair?,https://www.ncbi.nlm.nih.gov/pubmed/30853399,Acta orthopaedica et traumatologica turcica,2019 03 11,The aim of this study was to evaluate which specific factors influence the improvement in function and to estimate the time to obtain pain relief following arthroscopic rotator cuff repair.

The Mollusca is the second most speciose phylum, in which the Gastropoda forms the largest group. However, the currently proposed hypotheses of gastropod phylogeny are mainly based on part of their taxonomic diversity, notably on the large-sized and shallow-water species. In this study, we aimed at correcting this bias by reconstructing the phylogeny with new mitogenomes of deep-sea gastropods including Anatoma sp., Bathysciadiidae sp., Bayerotrochus teramachii, Calliotropis micraulax, Coccocrater sp., Cocculina subcompressa, Lepetodrilus guaymasensis, Peltospira smaragdina, Perotrochus caledonicus, Pseudococculinidae sp., and Shinkailepas briandi. This dataset provided the first reports of the mitogenomes for the Cocculiniformia, three vetigastropod superfamilies: Pleurotomarioidea, Lepetelloidea, and Scissurelloidea, and the neritimorph family Phenacolepadidae. The addition of deep-sea representatives also allowed us to evaluate the evolution of habitat use in gastropods. Our results showed a strongly supported sister-group relationship between the deep-sea lineages Cocculiniformia and Neomphalina. Within the Vetigastropoda, the Pleurotomarioidea was revealed as the sister-group of the remaining vetigastropods. Although this clade was presently restricted to the deep sea, fossil records showed that it has only recently invaded this habitat, thus suggesting that shallow waters was the ancestral habitat for the Vetigastropoda. The deep-sea Lepetelloidea and Lepetodriloidea formed a well-supported clade, with the Scissurelloidea sister to it, suggesting an early transition from shallow water to deep sea in this lineage. In addition, the switch between different chemosynthetic habitats was also observed in deep-sea gastropod lineages, notably in Neomphalina and Lepetelloidea. In both cases, the biogenic substrates appeared as the putative ancestral habitat, confirming the previously proposed hypothesis of a wooden-step to deep-sea vents scenario of evolution of habitat use for these taxa.",Stearoyl-CoA desaturase-1 is required for flavivirus RNA replication.,https://www.ncbi.nlm.nih.gov/pubmed/30853381,Antiviral research,2019 04 08,"Dengue virus (DENV) is the most prevalent human arthropod-borne virus and causes severe problems worldwide, mainly in tropical and sub-tropical regions. However, there is no specific antiviral drug against DENV infection. We and others recently reported that stearoyl-CoA desaturase-1 (SCD1) inhibitor showed potent suppression of hepatitis C virus replication. In this study, we examined the impact of SCD1 on DENV replication. We found that SCD1 inhibitors (MK8245 and #1716) dramatically suppressed DENV replication in a dose-dependent manner without cytotoxicity. This anti-DENV efficacy was observed against all four DENV serotypes and other flaviviruses, including Zika virus and Japanese encephalitis virus. A subgenomic replicon system of DENV was used to confirm that SCD1 inhibitor suppressed viral RNA replication. Interestingly, exogenous supplementation of unsaturated fatty acids resulted in recovery of the DENV titer even in the presence of SCD1 inhibitor, suggesting that fatty acid biosynthesis contributes to DENV genome replication. These findings indicate that SCD1 is a novel host factor required for DENV replication, and SCD1 inhibitor is a potential candidate for treating dengue fever.","Socioeconomic status, life expectancy and mortality in a universal healthcare setting: An individual-level analysis of >6 million Catalan residents.",https://www.ncbi.nlm.nih.gov/pubmed/30853378,Preventive medicine,2019 05 24,"We evaluated the association between individual-level socioeconomic status (SES), life expectancy, and mortality, in adult men and women from the general population living in Catalonia, a universal healthcare coverage setting. We used the Catalan Health Surveillance System database, which includes individual-level information on sociodemographic characteristics and mortality for all residents of Catalonia (Spain). We categorized individuals as high, medium, low or very low SES based on annual personal income and welfare receipt. We used 2016 mortality data to estimate life expectancy at age 18, and the probability of death by age, sex and SES categories. We followed a total of 6,027,424 Catalan residents in 2016. Men and women of very low SES had 12.0 and 9.4 years lower life expectancy compared to men and women of high SES, respectively. Low SES was also strongly associated with mortality in both men and women of any age. In the entire adult population of Catalonia, despite the availability of universal, high quality healthcare coverage, low SES is associated with lower life expectancy and higher mortality. Solutions to these large inequalities may combine tailored health promotion and management interventions, with solutions coming from outside of the health sector.",Quantitation of low concentrations of polysorbates 80 in protein formulations by Coomassie brilliant blue.,https://www.ncbi.nlm.nih.gov/pubmed/30853377,Analytical biochemistry,2019 04 12,"Polysorbate 80, as pharmaceutical excipient and virus inactivating agent, is commonly used in the protein pharmaceutical industry.

This colorimetric method is based on the interaction of Polysorbate 80 and Coomassie brilliant blue, and suitable for quantitation of Polysorbate 80 in the range of 10-100 μg/ml. Dozens or hundreds of samples can be quantified simultaneously by using microplate.

We found that the reagents studied differentially regulated the NF-κB and the MAP kinases signaling pathways in the human THP-1 macrophage. Additionally, mRNA expression levels of the cytokines, IL-1β and TNF-α in THP-1 macrophage were also induced by selected test reagents. Hence, careful selection of cationic lipid-based transfection reagent for transient transfection is warranted, especially in studies of gene expression and function mediated through NF-κB- and MAP kinases-mediated pathways.",Split luciferase-based assay for simultaneous analyses of the ligand concentration- and time-dependent recruitment of β-arrestin2.,https://www.ncbi.nlm.nih.gov/pubmed/30853375,Analytical biochemistry,2019 04 12,"Functional selectivity of agonists has gained increasing interest in G protein-coupled receptor (GPCR) research, e.g. due to expectations of drugs with reduced adverse effects. Different agonist-dependent GPCR conformations are conceived to selectively activate a balanced or imbalanced intracellular signalling response, involving e.g. different Gα subtypes, Gβγ-subunits and β-arrestins. To discriminate between the different signalling pathways (bias), sensitive techniques are needed that do not interfere with signalling. We applied split luciferase complementation to the GPCR/β-arrestin2 interaction and thoroughly analysed the influence of its implementation on intracellular signalling. This led to an assay enabling the functional characterization of ligands at the hH1R, the hM1,5R and the hNTS1R in live HEK293T cells. As demonstrated at the hM1,5R, the assay was sensitive enough to identify iperoxo as a superagonist. Time-dependent analyses of the recruitment of β-arrestin2 became possible, allowing the identification of class A and class B GPCRs, due to the differential duration of their interaction with β-arrestin2 and their recycling to the cell membrane. The developed β-arrestin2 recruitment assay, which provides concentration- and time-dependent information on the interaction between GPCRs and β-arrestin2 upon stimulation of the receptor, should be broadly applicable and of high value for the analysis of agonist bias."

So far, the exact role of ghrelin in depression and anxiety is still being debated. The p38 mitogen-activated protein kinase (p38-MAPK) is known to be activated in response to various stress stimuli. Thus, we hypothesize that ghrelin has an antidepressant effect, to which the p38-MAPK signaling pathway significantly contributes. To test this hypothesis, chronic social defeat stress (CSDS) was used as a model of depression. We employed the adeno-associated virus-mediated siRNA approach to down-regulate GHSR expression in the hippocampus of mice in vivo. Both ghrelin and the p38 inhibitor, SB203580, were administered to identify the effect of ghrelin on depressive-like behavior of stressed mice and to better assess the role of the p38-MAPK signaling pathway in this process. We found that CSDS activated the endogenous ghrelin-GHSR in hippocampal neurons, which possibly resulted in opposing the formation of depression- and anxiety-like behaviors in mice. Furthermore, the p38-MAPK signaling pathway had an important role in the antidepressant effect of ghrelin. Therefore, we conclude that ghrelin may reduce CSDS-induced depression- and anxiety-like behaviors via inhibiting the p38-MAPK signaling pathway in hippocampal neurons of mice.",Comprehensive analysis of the phospholipids and phytosterols in Schisandra chinensis oil by UPLC-Q/TOF- MSE.,https://www.ncbi.nlm.nih.gov/pubmed/30853340,Chemistry and physics of lipids,2019 05 05,"Characterization of phospholipids (PLs) and phytosterols were determined in Schisandra chinensis (S. chinensis) oil by UPLC-Q/TOF-MSE. The determination process was based on feature fragment information of components generated by the MSE detector. A total of 49 and 39 PLs were identified in S. chinensis oil under negative and positive ion mode, respectively. The classes of PLs included phosphatidic acids (PAs), phosphatidylethanolamines (PEs), phosphatidylglycerols (PGs), phosphatidylinositols (PIs), phosphatidylserines (PSs) and phosphatidylcholines (PCs). The most diverse species of PLs detected were PIs and PCs, accounting for 12 and 14, respectively. The analysis of quantification indicated that PEs and PCs were the most abundant constituents in S. chinensis oil, accounting for 122.85 ± 3.82 and 85.61 ± 2.12 μg/g, respectively. Besides, thirteen kinds of phytosterols were tentatively identified in S. chinensis oil under positive ion mode, among which, conicasterol C was the most abundant component, accounting for 22.02 ± 0.98 μg/g.

There are several analytical methods to avoid its labelling fraud; however, these require opening the ham. The aim of this work is testing a non-destructive sampling method which does not spoil the physical integrity of the ham. It consists of a puncture with a needle imitating a traditional olfactory system. After removing the needle impregnated with fat, its volatiles are analyzed with a Gas Chromatography (GC) coupled to Ion Mobility Spectrometry (IMS). The potential of this methodology was studied analyzing 156 Iberian hams from pigs under two different feeding regimes (acorns versus feed) and from different breed (Iberian versus Duroc crossed). Intensity of GC-IMS plot features was extracted and chemometric differentiation models were obtained; one for feeding regime and another for breed, providing validated classification rates of 91.7% and 100%, respectively. In addition, 29 features used for construction of both models were tentatively identified using chemical standards. The suitability of the method for quality control analysis was characterized by means of a precision study. As a conclusion, GC-IMS becomes a useful tool to guarantee dry-cured Iberian ham authenticity and detect labelling fraud.",Targeting DNA Methylation and EZH2 Activity to Overcome Melanoma Resistance to Immunotherapy.,https://www.ncbi.nlm.nih.gov/pubmed/30853334,Trends in immunology,2019 04 01,"Methylation of DNA at CpG sites is the most common and stable of epigenetic changes in cancer. Hypermethylation acts to limit immune checkpoint blockade immunotherapy by inhibiting endogenous interferon responses needed for recognition of cancer cells. By contrast, global hypomethylation results in the expression of programmed death ligand 1 (PD-L1) and inhibitory cytokines, accompanied by epithelial-mesenchymal changes that can contribute to immunosuppression. The drivers of these contrasting methylation states are not well understood. DNA methylation also plays a key role in cytotoxic T cell 'exhaustion' associated with tumor progression.

Induction of PU.1 expression in a cultured myeloid cell line expressing low PU.1 concentration results in decreased levels of mRNA encoding ATP-Citrate Lyase (ACL) and cell cycle arrest. ACL is an essential enzyme for generating acetyl-CoA, a key metabolite for the first step in fatty acid synthesis and for histone acetylation. We hypothesized that ACL may play a role in cell cycle regulation in the myeloid lineage. In this study, we found that acetyl-CoA or acetate supplementation was sufficient to rescue cell cycle progression in cultured BN cells treated with an ACL inhibitor or induced for PU.1 expression. Acetyl-CoA supplementation was also sufficient to rescue cell cycle progression in BN cells treated with a fatty acid synthase (FASN) inhibitor. We demonstrated that acetyl-CoA was utilized in both fatty acid synthesis and histone acetylation pathways to promote proliferation. Finally, we found that Acly mRNA transcript levels decrease during normal macrophage differentiation from bone marrow precursors. Our results suggest that regulation of ACL activity is a potentially important point of control for cell cycle regulation in the myeloid lineage.","Structure-based design and synthesis of pyrimidine-4,6-diamine derivatives as Janus kinase 3 inhibitors.",https://www.ncbi.nlm.nih.gov/pubmed/30853331,Bioorganic & medicinal chemistry,2019 03 26,"Janus kinases (JAKs) play a key role in the proliferation, apoptosis and differentiation of immune cells, and JAKs are considered as an attractive target for the treatment of inflammatory and autoimmune diseases.

To understand the clinical heterogeneity, we reviewed the pre-clinical data on vitamin D activity in four common autoimmune diseases: multiple sclerosis (MS), rheumatoid arthritis (RA), systemic lupus erythematosus (SLE), and inflammatory bowel disease (IBD), in which patients are commonly maintained on oral vitamin D3 supplementation. In contrast, many pre-clinical studies utilize other methods of manipulation (i.e. genetic, injection). Given the many actions of vitamin D3 and data supporting a vitamin D-independent role of the Vitamin D receptor (VDR), a more detailed mechanistic understanding of vitamin D3 activity is needed to properly translate pre-clinical findings into the clinic.

Rhodopsin, in rod cells, responds to dim light, whereas three types of cone opsins (red, green, and blue) function under bright light and mediate color vision. Cone opsins regenerate with retinal much faster than rhodopsin, but the molecular mechanism of regeneration is still unclear. Recent advances in the area pinpoint transient intermediate opsin conformations, and a possible secondary retinal-binding site, as determinant factors for regeneration.

In wild type plants, the expression of TFL1 in the center of the inflorescence meristem represses the flower meristem identity genes LEAFY (LFY) and APETALA1 (AP1) to maintain indeterminacy. LFY and AP1 are activated by flowering signals that antagonize TFL1. Its characterization in numerous species revealed that the TFL1-mediated regulation of meristem fate has broader impacts on plant development than originally depicted in A. thaliana. By blocking floral transition, TFL1 genes participate in the control of juvenility, shoot growth pattern, inflorescence architecture, and the establishment of life history strategies.

However, little is known as to why KRAS mutations preferentially occur in PDACs and what processes/factors generate these mutations. While abnormal carbohydrate metabolism is associated with a high risk of pancreatic cancer, it remains elusive whether a direct relationship between KRAS mutations and sugar metabolism exists. Here, we show that under high-glucose conditions, cellular O-GlcNAcylation is significantly elevated in pancreatic cells that exhibit lower phosphofructokinase (PFK) activity than other cell types. This post-translational modification specifically compromises the ribonucleotide reductase (RNR) activity, leading to deficiency in dNTP pools, genomic DNA alterations with KRAS mutations, and cellular transformation. These results establish a mechanistic link between a perturbed sugar metabolism and genomic instability that induces de novo oncogenic KRAS mutations preferentially in pancreatic cells.",LINE1 Derepression in Aged Wild-Type and SIRT6-Deficient Mice Drives Inflammation.,https://www.ncbi.nlm.nih.gov/pubmed/30853213,Cell metabolism,2019 04 06,"Mice deficient for SIRT6 exhibit a severely shortened lifespan, growth retardation, and highly elevated LINE1 (L1) activity. Here we report that SIRT6-deficient cells and tissues accumulate abundant cytoplasmic L1 cDNA, which triggers strong type I interferon response via activation of cGAS. Remarkably, nucleoside reverse-transcriptase inhibitors (NRTIs), which inhibit L1 retrotransposition, significantly improved health and lifespan of SIRT6 knockout mice and completely rescued type I interferon response. In tissue culture, inhibition of L1 with siRNA or NRTIs abrogated type I interferon response, in addition to a significant reduction of DNA damage markers. These results indicate that L1 activation contributes to the pathologies of SIRT6 knockout mice. Similarly, L1 transcription, cytoplasmic cDNA copy number, and type I interferons were elevated in the wild-type aged mice. As sterile inflammation is a hallmark of aging, we propose that modulating L1 activity may be an important strategy for attenuating age-related pathologies.","Evaluation of the efficacy of celecoxib and ibuprofen on postoperative pain, swelling, and mouth opening after surgical removal of impacted third molars: a randomized, controlled clinical trial.",https://www.ncbi.nlm.nih.gov/pubmed/30853212,International journal of oral and maxillofacial surgery,2019 03 11,"The objective of this study was to compare the efficacy of celecoxib and ibuprofen in reducing postoperative sequelae following the surgical removal of impacted mandibular third molars.

All subjects were randomly allocated to receive one of the following treatments twice a day for 5days after surgery: placebo (n=32), ibuprofen (n=33), or celecoxib (n=33). The primary outcome chosen was postoperative pain, which was evaluated using the visual analogue scale (VAS) score recorded by each patient. The secondary outcomes chosen were changes in postoperative swelling and maximum mouth opening values compared to preoperative ones. Compared to placebo, treatment with celecoxib and ibuprofen resulted in improvements in the primary outcome. Furthermore, when compared to the other groups, patients in the celecoxib group showed a significant reduction in postoperative pain scores at 6h (P<0.001), 12h (P=0.011), and 24h (P=0.041) after surgery. Regarding swelling and maximum mouth opening values, there were no significant differences between the groups at each follow-up session.

PubMed database was searched for relevant studies. A meta-analysis was performed with Review Manager 5.3 software. Twenty-seven observational studies involving 1103 patients were included in the review. The overall morbidity and 30-day mortality was 27% and 0.5% respectively. The median (range) 5-year overall survival (OS) and disease-free survival (DFS) rates were 87% (60-100%) and 71% (44-100%) respectively. In meta-analyses, factors associated with shorter DFS included male sex, mitotic index >5/50 high-power fields, high risk, tumor size >5 cm, and the PD procedure. Factors associated with shorter OS included mitotic index >5/50 high-power fields and tumor size >5 cm. Patients in PD group had a higher incidence of mitotic index >5/50 HPF, a higher incidence of high-risk classification, a higher incidence of tumors in the second portion of the duodenum, a larger tumor size, a longer duration of operation, more intraoperative blood loss, a greater blood transfusion requirement, a higher morbidity rate, a longer hospital stay, and an increased recurrence rate than those in LR group. In conclusion, the current literature review demonstrates that the postoperative prognosis of duodenal GIST is promising and mainly affected by tumor factors.

Previously, we generated limb bud mesenchyme-specific Cdc42 inactivated mice (Cdc42 conditional knockout mice; Cdc42 fl/fl; Prx1-Cre), which showed short limbs and cranial bone deformities, though the mechanism related to the cranium phenotype was unclear. In the present study, we investigated the role of Cdc42 in cranial bone development. Our results showed that loss of Cdc42 caused a defect of intramembranous ossification in cranial bone tissues which is related to decreased expressions of cranial suture morphogenesis genes, including Indian hedgehog (Ihh) and bone morphogenetic proteins (BMPs). These findings demonstrate that Cdc42 plays a crucial role in cranial osteogenesis, and is controlled by Ihh- and BMP-mediated signaling during cranium development.",Circular RNA hsa_circ_0001368 suppresses the progression of gastric cancer by regulating miR-6506-5p/FOXO3 axis.,https://www.ncbi.nlm.nih.gov/pubmed/30853185,Biochemical and biophysical research communications,2019 03 25,"Gastric cancer (GC) is still a major aggressive malignancy worldwide. While the importance of circular RNAs (circRNAs) involved in carcinogenesis has gradually been acknowledged, their role in human cancers is not largely understood, including in GC. Here, we focused on hsa_circ_0001368 in GC, a novel circRNA that has not been previously reported. In the current study, we found a broad downregulation of hsa_circ_0001368 in GC tissues and cells, which correlates with a worse prognosis in GC patients. Functional experiments suggested that the knockdown of hsa_circ_0001368 promoted cell viability and motility by cell proliferation and invasion assays. In addition, the knockdown of hsa_circ_0001368 led to accelerated tumor growth in vivo. Mechanically, we demonstrated that hsa_circ_0001368 served as a competing endogenous RNA (ceRNA) to sponge miR-6506-5p. Subsequently, FOXO3 may act as the functional target of miR-6506-5p, and the knockdown of hsa_circ_0001368 decreased the expression of the tumor-suppressive gene FOXO3. Taken together, our study revealed that hsa_circ_0001368 plays a tumor-suppression role in GC via the miR-6506-5p/FOXO3 axis and may serve as a potential target for GC therapy.",First description of a compensatory xylosyltransferase I induction observed after an antifibrotic UDP-treatment of normal human dermal fibroblasts.,https://www.ncbi.nlm.nih.gov/pubmed/30853184,Biochemical and biophysical research communications,2019 03 25,"Fibrosis is a serious health problem often leading to accompanying organ failure. During the manifestation of the disease, an accumulation of different extracellular matrix (ECM) molecules, such as proteoglycans, takes place. There is no appropriate therapeutic option available to heal fibrosis to date. Current research focuses primarily on targets such as the cytokine transforming growth factor-β1 (TGF-β1), which is assumed to be one of the key mediators of fibrosis. Both xylosyltransferase isoforms, XT-I and XT-II, catalyze the rate-limiting step of the proteoglycan biosynthesis. Consequently, inhibiting XT activity could be a promising approach to treat fibrosis. It was shown in earlier studies that nucleotides and nucleosides have anti-fibrotic properties and decrease XT activity in cell-free systems. In contrast, we evaluated the mechanisms beyond an UDP-mediated induction of intracellular XT-activity in normal human dermal fibroblasts (NHDF). The observed pseudo-fibrotic XT increasement could be attributed to a compensation of decreased UDP-glucuronate decarboxylase 1 (UXS1) mRNA expression as well as a diminished intracellular UDP-xylose concentration. In summary, our results describe a so far unknown XT-inductive pathway and show that UDP could be a promising molecule for the development of an anti-fibrotic therapy. Nevertheless, XT activity has to be inhibited in parallel intracellularly.",ALDH2 deficiency inhibits Ox-LDL induced foam cell formation via suppressing CD36 expression.,https://www.ncbi.nlm.nih.gov/pubmed/30853183,Biochemical and biophysical research communications,2019 03 25,"Foam cell formation plays an important role in the initiation and progression of atherosclerosis. Aldehyde dehydrogenase 2 (ALDH2), a key enzyme for aldehyde metabolism, is associated with coronary artery disease and affects atherosclerotic plaque vulnerability. However, the role of ALDH2 in foam cell formation remains unclear. Using peritoneal macrophages from ALDH2-deficient and control mice, we found that ALDH2 deficiency suppressed foam cell formation induced by oxidized low-density lipoproteins (ox-LDL) but not acetylated low-density lipoproteins (ac-LDL) ex vivo. After incubation with ox-LDL, ALDH2-deficient macrophages expressed lower levels of CD36 but the expression of other lipid metabolism-related proteins including SRA, LOX-1, ABCA-1, ABCG-1 and ACAT-1 was not changed in ALDH2-/- macrophages. Using CD36 inhibitor, we confirmed that CD36 contributes to the effect of ALDH2 on foam cell formation. PPARγ was downregulated in ox-LDL treated ALDH2-/- macrophages. 4-HNE was increased by ALDH2 deficiency and high concentration of 4-HNE suppressed the expression of PPARγ. These data suggest that ALDH2 plays an important role in foam cell formation via 4-HNE/PPARγ/CD36 pathway.",The long noncoding RNA ST7-AS1 promotes laryngeal squamous cell carcinoma by stabilizing CARM1.,https://www.ncbi.nlm.nih.gov/pubmed/30853182,Biochemical and biophysical research communications,2019 03 25,"The laryngeal squamous cell carcinoma (LSCC) represents a malignant cancer and contributes largely to head and neck tumorigenesis. The molecular mechanisms for LSCC progression are poorly understood. In current work, we identified long non-coding RNA (lncRNA) termed suppressor of tumorigenicity 7 antisense RNA 1 (ST7-AS1) as an oncogenic factor in LSCC. ST7-AS1 is frequently overexpressed in LSCC tissues and cell lines. ST7-AS1 is required for the malignancy of LSCC cells through migration, tumor sphere formation assay and in vivo implantation. Mechanistically, ST7-AS1 could interact with CARM1, a well characterized protein arginine methyltransferase and protect CARM1 from ubiquitin-dependent degradation. CARM1 can methylate Sox-2, a pluripotent transcription factor. Thus, ST7-AS1 might mediate its oncogenic effect by signaling through CARM1-Sox-2 axis to enhance Sox-2 self-association and transactivation activity. Collectively, we have unraveled a ST7-AS1/CARM1/Sox-2 signaling axis in LSCC and may have created novel interconnections between noncoding RNAs and cancer development.",Upregulation of circular RNA circ-ERBB2 predicts unfavorable prognosis and facilitates the progression of gastric cancer via miR-503/CACUL1 and miR-637/MMP-19 signaling.,https://www.ncbi.nlm.nih.gov/pubmed/30853181,Biochemical and biophysical research communications,2019 03 26,"Gastric cancer (GC) is one of the most common malignancies of digestive system with aggressive phenotypes. Circular RNAs (circRNAs) play a pivotal function in cancer initiation and development. Nevertheless, the function and mechanism of circRNAs in gastric cancer (GC) is not fully understood. We found circ-ERBB2 was strikingly increased in GC tissues and cells. Noticeably, circ-ERBB2 upregulation in tumorous tissues was linked to patients' tumor size, depth of invasion, and overall survival. A series of gain and loss-of-function assays indicated its oncogenic role in GC cells, including cell proliferation, apoptosis, migration and invasion. We further predicted and identified circ-ERBB2 sponged miR-503 and miR-637 by bioinformatics analysis and luciferase reporter system. CACUL1 and MMP-19 were then predicted and confirmed as the target of miR-503 and miR-637, respectively. Furthermore, rescue assays indicated that circ-ERBB2 promoted tumor growth and invasion via miR-503/CACUL1 and miR-637/MMP-19 pathways, respectively. In summary, these findings demonstrated that circ-ERBB2 functions as an oncogene in GC and might be useful in developing promising therapies for this fatal malignancy.",Function of the PLZF gene in early development and self-renewal of T cells in mice.,https://www.ncbi.nlm.nih.gov/pubmed/30853180,Biochemical and biophysical research communications,2019 03 26,"The expression of transcription factor Zbtb1 is essential for the maintenance and development of various blood cells in the hematopoietic system.

However, the decrease of thymocytes in PLZF deficient mice was not cell intrinsic. This study adds new information regarding the regulation of the PLZF gene in the development and self-renewal of T cells.",Circular IRE-type RNAs of the NR5A1 gene are formed in adrenocortical cells.,https://www.ncbi.nlm.nih.gov/pubmed/30853179,Biochemical and biophysical research communications,2019 03 25,"The recently discovered circular RNAs (circRNAs) are mostly formed by back-splicing where the downstream 5' splice site splices to the upstream 3' splice site by conventional pre-mRNA splicing. These circRNAs regulate gene expression by acting as sponges for micro-RNAs or RNA-binding proteins. Here we show that the NR5A1 (previously called Ad4BP or SF-1) gene which is exclusively expressed in the adrenal cortex and steroidogenic tissue can form atypical circRNAs by unconventional splicing. Two stem loops with inositol-requiring protein-1α (IRE1α) cleavage sites are connected by an IRE1α cleavage site to form a circRNA (circIRE RNA). From total RNA of normal human adrenal cortex, we detected a circIRE RNA with connected ends by IRE1α cleavage sites in exon 6 and exon 1 (circIRE NR5A1 ex6-1 RNA). circIRE NR5A1 ex6-1 RNA was not detected in the adrenocortical cancer cell line, H295R. When IRE1α was expressed in H295R cells a different circIRE NR5A1 RNA connecting IRE1-cleavage sites in exon 7 and exon 1 was detected (circIRE NR5A1 ex7-1 RNA). The expression of this circIRE RNA was inhibited by the IRE1 inhibitor 1, STF-083010, implicating that it was formed via the ER stress pathway, where IRE1α is a major factor. This is the first report of this type of circular RNA connected by IRE1-cleavage sites found to be expressed in mammalian cells in a tissue-specific manner. To our surprise, the concomitant expression of NR5A1 was increased by IRE1α implicating that NR5A1 was not subjected to IRE1-dependent decay of mRNA (RIDD) but rather activating a transcriptional regulatory network to cope with ER stress in steroidogenic tissue reminiscent to XBP1 in other tissue. We believe this is the first report of such tissue-specific transcriptional cascade responding to ER stress as well as the novel finding of circular RNAs connected by IRE1α cleavage sites expressed in mammalian tissue.",Elevation of circular RNA circ_0003645 forecasts unfavorable prognosis and facilitates cell progression via miR-1179/TMEM14A pathway in non-small cell lung cancer.,https://www.ncbi.nlm.nih.gov/pubmed/30853176,Biochemical and biophysical research communications,2019 03 26,"Non-small cell lung cancer (NSCLC) is a highly aggressive malignancy with increasing incidence across the world.

However, its effects on lesion of peri-implant and related mechanism of action are still not clear, which require further investigation. In this study, we evaluated the effects of PR on polymethylmethacrylate (PMMA)-induced lesion of peri-implant in vitro and in vivo, and explored its possible mechanism of action. Our results indicated that PR could inhibit PMMA-induced osteoclastogenesis in RAW264.7 cells with a dose-dependent manner in vitro and effectively down-regulate mRNA and protein expressions of matrix metalloprotein 9 (MMP-9), tumor necrosis factor (TNF)-α, interleukin (IL)-6, and receptor activator of nuclear factor (NF)-κB (RANK), primarily via the suppression of NF-κB signaling. Furthermore, we found that PMMA induction could directly cause the phosphorylation of IκB and significantly promote the nuclear translocation of p65 in RAW264.7 cells. In other words, PR was able to dose-dependently attenuate the PMMA-induced nuclear translocation of p65 in RAW264.7 cells. In vivo, PR was observed to attenuate PMMA-induced osteoclastogenesis, osteolysis, mRNA expressions of receptor activator of nuclear factor (NF)-κB ligand (RANKL) and RANK, as well as protein levels of MMP-9, TNF-α, IL-6, and p65 in a murine calvarial osteolysis model. These findings suggested that PR might be a potential therapeutic drug to lesion of peri-implant, and provided new insights for understanding its possible mechanism."

The device consisted of a hemispherical electrode sample vial printed from a filament of conductive polylactic acid (PLA), into which sat a smaller hemispherical 3D printed porous membrane acceptor vial. Application of voltage between a point-electrode placed in the center of 20 μL solution inside the acceptor vial and the electrode vial containing 1 mL of sample, enabled anion migration through the 3D printed porous material into the acceptor solution. Electromembrane extraction was proved using fluorescein for imaging of the extraction process, with preconcentration rates of 0.833 μM/sec at 120 V with close to 95% recovery. The performance of the fabricated porous 3D printed device was evaluated for the preconcentration of anions from water prior to capillary electrophoresis detection. Preconcentration factors ranging between 36-44 were obtained for chloride, nitrate, perchlorate and sulfate, while a lower performance was observed for weaker acids as fluoride and phosphate (3-4). The limit of detection (LOD) was determined to be 0.16 μM, 0.18 μM and 0.18 μM for NO3-, ClO4- and SO42- respectively. The extraction and quantitation of ions from a soil slurry without filtration, namely NO3- and SO42- content was determined to be 0.24 and 0.03 mmol/100 g of soil, respectively which are values in the range of those typically reported in soil samples.",Incidence and safety profile of outpatient unicompartmental knee arthroplasty.,https://www.ncbi.nlm.nih.gov/pubmed/30853161,The Knee,2019 06 08,"Outpatient surgery is an increasingly attractive option for patients undergoing procedures with established, acceptable risk profiles. Benefits of outpatient surgery include cost savings, enhanced patient experience and improved resource allocation at busy hospitals. The purpose of this study was to compare 90-day complication and readmission rates for patients undergoing unicompartmental knee arthroplasty (UKA) in the outpatient as opposed to the inpatient setting.","Cross-Cultural Adaptation, Reliability, and Validity of the Chinese Version of the Tampa Scale for Kinesiophobia-11 Among Patients Who Have Undergone Total Knee Arthroplasty.",https://www.ncbi.nlm.nih.gov/pubmed/30853160,The Journal of arthroplasty,2019 05 24,"The shortened version of the Tampa Scale for Kinesiophobia (TSK-11) has been well characterized in the literature. However, to the best of our knowledge, no previous studies have evaluated the reliability and validity of the TSK-11 for Chinese-speaking patients who have undergone total knee arthroplasty (TKA). Thus, the objectives of this study were to translate and adapt the TSK-11 cross-culturally into Chinese and to evaluate its reliability and validity in a sample of Chinese TKA patients.",Improved Range of Motion and Patient-Reported Outcome Scores With Fixed-Bearing Revision Total Knee Arthroplasty for Suboptimal Axial Implant Rotation.,https://www.ncbi.nlm.nih.gov/pubmed/30853158,The Journal of arthroplasty,2019 05 24,Suboptimal implant rotation has consequences with respect to knee kinematics and clinical outcomes.

The purpose of this study was to perform a comparative study of the risk of complications after THA between IA and osteoarthritis.",Physical and Family History Variables Associated With Neurological and Cognitive Development in Sturge-Weber Syndrome.,https://www.ncbi.nlm.nih.gov/pubmed/30853154,Pediatric neurology,2019 06 12,"Sturge-Weber syndrome (SWS) is caused by a somatic mutation in GNAQ leading to capillary venous malformations in the brain presenting with various neurological, ophthalmic, and cognitive symptoms of variable severity. This clinical variability makes accurate prognosis difficult. We hypothesized that the greater extent of physical factors (extent of skin, eye, and brain involvement), presence of possible genetic factors (gender and family history), and age of seizure onset may be associated with greater symptom severity and need for surgery in patients with SWS.","Pharmacokinetic effects of endotracheal, intraosseous, and intravenous epinephrine in a swine model of traumatic cardiac arrest.",https://www.ncbi.nlm.nih.gov/pubmed/30853153,The American journal of emergency medicine,2019 03 11,"Limited prospective data exist regarding epinephrine's controversial role in managing traumatic cardiac arrest (TCA). This study compared the maximum concentration (Cmax), time to maximum concentration (Tmax), plasma concentration over time, return of spontaneous circulation (ROSC), time to ROSC, and odds of ROSC of epinephrine administered by the endotracheal (ETT), intraosseous (IO), and intravenous (IV) routes in a swine TCA model.","Efficacy of primary treatment with immunoglobulin plus ciclosporin for prevention of coronary artery abnormalities in patients with Kawasaki disease predicted to be at increased risk of non-response to intravenous immunoglobulin (KAICA): a randomised controlled, open-label, blinded-endpoints, phase 3 trial.",https://www.ncbi.nlm.nih.gov/pubmed/30853151,"Lancet (London, England)",2019 05 08,"Genetic studies have indicated possible involvement of the upregulated calcium-nuclear factor of activated T cells pathway in the pathogenesis of Kawasaki disease.
