Plague is managed by infusing prairie dog burrows with DeltaDust® 0.05% deltamethrin, a pulicide that kills fleas. Experiments are needed to identify pulicides that can be used in rotation with DeltaDust for integrated plague management. In South Dakota, USA, we tested the efficacy of four pulicide dusts when applied at a rate of 8 g per burrow on colonies of black-tailed prairie dogs (Cynomys ludovicianus): Sevin® 5% carbaryl; Dusta-cide® 6% malathion; Alpine® 0.25% dinotefuran with 95% diatomaceous earth; and Tri-Die® 1% pyrethrum with 40% amorphous silica and 10% piperonyl butoxide. We also tested systemic 0.005% fipronil, which was distributed as ½ cup of laced grain per burrow. We sampled prairie dogs on 3294 occasions and detected 10,041 fleas. Sevin and Dusta-cide suppressed fleas but only for 1 month. Neither Alpine nor Tri-Die had any noticeable, consistent effect on fleas. Fipronil suppressed fleas by 97-100% for 3 months. The residual effect of fipronil persisted for ∼12 months. Efficacy of fipronil seems comparable with DeltaDust, which exhibited a residual effect for ∼10 months in prior studies. Continued research is needed to optimize fipronil treatments for plague management on prairie dog colonies.",The relationship between habit and healthcare professional behaviour in clinical practice: a systematic review and meta-analysis.,https://www.ncbi.nlm.nih.gov/pubmed/30620248,Health psychology review,2019 03 29,"Theories of behaviour used to understand healthcare professional behaviour often focus on the deliberative processes that drive their behaviour; however, less is known about the role that implicit processes such as habit have on healthcare professional behaviour. This systematic review aimed to critically appraise and synthesise research evidence investigating the association between habit and healthcare professional behaviour. A search of five databases (PsycINFO, EMBASE, Scopus and CINAHL) was conducted up until 29 February 2016 to identify studies reporting correlations between habit and healthcare professional behaviours. Meta-analyses were conducted to assess the overall habit-behaviour association across all behaviours. A subgroup analysis assessed whether the habit-behaviour relationship differed depending on whether the behaviour was objectively measured or assessed by self-report. We identified nine eligible studies involving 1975 healthcare professionals that included 28 habit-behaviour correlations. A combined mean r+ of 0.35 (medium effect) was observed between habit and healthcare professional behaviour. The habit-behaviour correlation was not affected by whether behaviour was measured objectively or by self-report. This review suggests that habit plays a significant role in healthcare professional behaviour. Findings may have implications for considering health professionals' habit when promoting the provision of evidence-based health care, and for breaking existing habit when de-implementing outdated, non-evidence-based practices.",Legally Lethal Kratom: A Herbal Supplement with Overdose Potential.,https://www.ncbi.nlm.nih.gov/pubmed/30620247,Journal of psychoactive drugs,2019 02 22,"This case report describes an overdose on kratom, and elicits the potential dangers of overdose on the regulated dietary supplement. A young male presented to the emergency department intubated after being found unresponsive. He was found by his family to be unarousable and agonal breathing with minimal response to naloxone administered by Emergency Medical Services (EMS). Urine toxicology and blood alcohol content were negative. Physical exam was significant for tachycardia, hypotension, and pinpoint pupils with sluggish reactivity to light. Laboratory studies were significant for elevated liver enzymes, blood urea nitrogen, creatinine, lipase, amylase, troponins, and lactic acid. Family members revealed that the patient consumed kratom, which he obtained through an e-commerce business, and had consumed over 500 grams the previous day. Urine sample for kratom on day 3 tested positive with levels of more than 500 ng/dL.

Recommendations for radon testing in multi-family housing focus on testing a percentage of all units. There is considerable variability among recommendations as well as their implementation. I used the hypergeometric distribution to determine the probability of identifying one or more units with radon at or above 4.0 pCi/L for two prevalences (1:15, the U.S. average) and 1:3 (for states with many homes with radon ≥4.0 pCi/L) using two approaches. First, the distribution was used to evaluate the probability of finding one or more units with radon at or above 4.0 pCi/L when: (1) testing 10% or 25% of a range of ground-floor units; or (2) testing a varying percentage of units in 10-, 20-, or 30- ground-floor unit buildings. Second, the method was used to determine the number of units to be tested to identify one or more units with radon at or above 4.0 pCi/L with 95% probability, given a range of total ground-floor units. Analyses identified that testing 10% or 25% of ground-floor units had low probability of identifying at least one unit with radon at or above 4.0 pCi/L, especially at low prevalence. At low prevalence (1:15), at least 10 units need to be tested in structures with 20 or fewer total units; at high prevalence (1:3), at least 5 units need to be tested in units with structures having 10 or fewer units to achieve 95% probability of identifying at least one unit with radon at or above 4.0 pCi/L. These findings indicate that recommendations for radon testing in multi-family housing may be improved by applying a well-established and more rigorous statistical approach than percentage-based testing to more accurately characterize exposure to radon in multi-family housing units, which could improve lung cancer prevention efforts.",Higher Waist Circumference Is Related to Lower Plasma Polyunsaturated Fatty Acids in Healthy Participants: Metabolic Implications.,https://www.ncbi.nlm.nih.gov/pubmed/30620245,Journal of the American College of Nutrition,2019 05 17,We evaluated whether the relationship between waist circumference (WC) and cardiometabolic risk is related to usual diet and plasma fatty acid composition.,Testing a revised inlet for the personal dust monitor.,https://www.ncbi.nlm.nih.gov/pubmed/30620243,Journal of occupational and environmental hygiene,2019 05 12,"A person-wearable dust monitor that provides nearly real-time, mass-based readings of respirable dust was developed for use in underground coal mines. This personal dust monitor (PDM) combined dust sampling instrumentation with a cap lamp (and battery) into one belt-wearable unit, with the air inlet mounted on the cap lamp. However, obsolescence of belt-carried cap lamp and batteries in coal mining ensued and led end users to request that the cap lamp and battery be removed from the PDM. Removal of these components necessitated the design of a new air inlet to be worn on the miner's lapel. The revised inlet was tested for dust collection equivalency against the original cap-mounted inlet design. Using calculated inlet respirable fractions and measured dust mass collection, the performance of the two inlets is shown to be similar. The new inlet requires a 1.02 factor for converting dust masses obtained from it to equivalent masses collected from the original inlet.","Trends in Multivitamin Use Among Women of Reproductive Age: United States, 2006-2016.",https://www.ncbi.nlm.nih.gov/pubmed/30620242,Journal of women's health (2002),2019 01 10,Women of reproductive age can consume 0.4 milligrams of folic acid daily to reduce the risk of a neural tube defect (NTD)-affected pregnancy.

Part A,2019 06 05,"
Background:
 Esophageal thoracic diverticular disease is a rare condition resulting from multiple etiologies. Surgical management is recommended when symptomatic. Traditionally, a thoracotomy was considered the standard approach; however, the use of minimally invasive approaches has been associated with improved outcomes. 
Methods:
 We retrospectively reviewed a single surgeon's experience with minimally invasive esophageal diverticulectomy. 
Results:
 Fifteen patients with symptomatic esophageal diverticular disease underwent minimally invasive diverticulectomy between 2005 and 2018. Most patients (86.7%) had epiphrenic diverticula and 53.3% underwent a video-assisted thoracoscopic surgery approach. All patients had a diverticulectomy, while 14 patients (93.3%) also had an esophageal myotomy. Three patients (20%) underwent an extended myotomy, 4 patients (26.7%) underwent a concomitant fundoplication, and 2 patients (13.3%) underwent a concomitant paraesophageal hernia repair. Median length of hospital stay was 2 days (range, 1-16 days). There were no mortalities. Two patients (13.3%) were readmitted with delayed esophageal leaks. Median follow-up was 10.7 months (range, 10 days to 6.3 years). One patient presented with recurrent disease 5 years after his initial operation. 
Conclusions:
 In experienced hands, a minimally invasive diverticulectomy is safe, effective, and associated with excellent patient outcomes. A minimally invasive approach should be performed when possible and should be tailored to the individual patient's disease and preoperative workup.",Assessment of Arterial Stiffness in Metabolic Syndrome Related to Insulin Resistance in Apparently Healthy Men.,https://www.ncbi.nlm.nih.gov/pubmed/30620239,Metabolic syndrome and related disorders,2019 05 01,Assessment of subclinical atherosclerosis in metabolic syndrome is one of the global health targets' priorities.

So it is of great importance to evaluate the collected EEG signal prior to use. Traditional methods usually use the impedance between skin and electrode to estimate the quality of the EEG signal, which has shortcomings such as monotonous features, high false positive rates, and poor real-time capability. Aiming at addressing these issues, this paper presents a novel model of EEG quality assessment based on Fuzzy Comprehensive Evaluation method. The developed model employs amplitude, power frequency ratio, and alpha band PSD (Power Spectral Density) ratio of resting EEG signal as evaluation factors, and performs a quantitative assessment of the signal quality. Experiments show that the proposed model can significantly determine the EEG signal quality. In addition, the model is simple in implementation with low computational complexity, and is able to present the EEG quality evaluation results in real time. Before the formal measurement, collecting short-term resting EEG data, and evaluating the EEG signal quality and current signal acquisition environment using the model, the collection efficiency of qualified EEG signals can be greatly improved.",The current state of pain education within Canadian physiotherapy programs: a national survey of pain educators.,https://www.ncbi.nlm.nih.gov/pubmed/30620223,Disability and rehabilitation,2019 01 08,To determine the current state of pain education across physiotherapy programs in Canada.,Effects of An Occupational Therapy Memory Strategy Education Group Intervention on Irish Older Adults' Self-Management of Everyday Memory Difficulties.,https://www.ncbi.nlm.nih.gov/pubmed/30620222,Occupational therapy in health care,2019 05 15,"An occupational therapy memory strategy education group (MSEG) was developed to assist clients with varying levels of memory impairment to adopt strategies to manage memory impairment in their daily lives.

However, pEpiSCs and piPSCs have been technically much harder to culture than mouse embryonic stem cells, showing problematic properties such as spontaneous differentiation and apoptosis after cryopreservation. Therefore, we demonstrated that Y-27632 as a Rho-associated coiled-coil containing kinase inhibitor could prevent dissociated pEpiSCs and piPSCs from undesirable differentiation and apoptosis in cryopreservation protocols. pEpiSC 2, 8 lines, Sendai virus-induced pluripotent stem cells (Sev-iPSCs), and lentivirus-induced pluripotent stem cells were cultured with 10 μM Y-27632 before collecting dissociated cells retrieved from colonies using various enzymes. Dissociated single cells were transferred into freezing mediums (open pulled straw vitrification, STEM-CELLBANKER® (SCB), 10% dimethylsulfoxide in serum) for cryopreservation. The rates of viability and colony formation obtained from dissociated porcine stem cells after freezing/thawing were examined in the presence of Y-27632. The characteristics of pluripotency and in vitro differentiation were also examined in these stem cells treated with Y-27632 after cryopreservation. As a result, the viability and efficiency of colony formation of dissociated pEpiSCs (2, 8 lines) and Sev-iPSCs treated with 10 μM Y-27632 using the SCB cryopreservation protocol were significantly increased when compared with those of nontreated Y-27632 (p < 0.05). Pluripotency genes (OCT-3/4, NANOG, and SOX2) were positively expressed in Y-27632-treated porcine pluripotent stem cells. Also, in vitro differentiation of these stem cells was successfully induced in the presence of 10 μM Y-27632. These results indicated that treatment of Y-27632 for single-cell dissociation and the SCB cryopreservation protocol could facilitate handling porcine pluripotent stem cells and provide the widespread use of these stem cells."

Despite intense use, these methods allow neither the removal of the nanoparticles after a measurement nor a defined confinement of the SERS measurement position. So far, tip enhanced Raman spectroscopy is still the key technique in this regard but not adequate for various samples mainly due to diminished signal enhancement compared to other techniques, poor device fabrication reproducibility, and cumbersome experimental setup requirements. Here, we demonstrate that a rational combination of only four gold nanoparticles (AuNPs) on a DNA origami template, and single silicon nanowires (SiNWs) yield functional optical amplifier nanoprobes for SERS. These nanoscale SERS devices offer a spatial resolution below the diffraction limit of light and still a high electric field intensity enhancement factor ( EF) of about 105 despite of miniaturization.","Romantic Surfaces: A Systematic Overview of Stable, Biospecific, and Antifouling Zwitterionic Surfaces.",https://www.ncbi.nlm.nih.gov/pubmed/30620199,Langmuir : the ACS journal of surfaces and colloids,2019 02 10,"This Feature Article focuses on recent advances in the bioconjugation of surface-bound zwitterionic polymers for biospecific antifouling surfaces.

Side-chain functionalization methods can be further classified as those that are achieved through homopolymerization of custom-synthesized zwitterionic monomers equipped with reactive groups, or those that are achieved via synthesis of random or block copolymers combining different monomers with antifouling functionality and others with reactive groups. Several of the pros and cons of these approaches are outlined and discussed.

B,2019 02 07,"Double electron-electron resonance (DEER) measures distances between spin labels attached at well-defined sites in a protein and thus has the potential to report on conformational states of proteins in cells. In this work, we evaluate the suitability of the small and rigid 4PS-PyMTA-Gd(III) spin label for in-cell distance measurements. Three ubiquitin double mutants were labeled with 4PS-PyMTA-Gd(III) and delivered into human HeLa cells by electroporation (EP) and hypotonic swelling (HS). Gd(III)-Gd(III) DEER measurements were carried out on cells frozen after different incubation times, following delivery to test the stability of the spin label inside the cell. For both delivery methods, it was possible to derive distance distributions up to 12 h after delivery, although we observed a decrease in the amount of the delivered protein with time. Surprisingly, only one mutant reported a significant change in the distance distribution with time and only for HS delivery. On the basis of in vitro exchange experiments with Mn(II) and comparison with the same mutant labeled with BrPSPy-DO3MA-Gd(III) and considering the presence of Mn(II) in the cell, we hypothesized that the change occurred as a consequence of partial Gd(III)/Mn(II) exchange with endogenous Mn(II). These experiments also showed that the relative Gd(III)/Mn(II) binding affinity depends on the labeling site in the protein, which accounts for the lack of change with the other mutants delivered under HS conditions. We conclude that 4PS-PyMTA-Gd(III) is a good spin label for in-cell DEER for delivery by EP, but caution should be taken when HS is used.","Divergent Syntheses of Spiroindanones and 2-Substituted 1-Indanones by Ruthenium-Catalyzed Tandem Coupling and Cyclization of Aromatic Acids with α,β-Unsaturated Ketones.",https://www.ncbi.nlm.nih.gov/pubmed/30620196,The Journal of organic chemistry,2019 02 01,"The one-step strategy for the facile syntheses of structurally diverse 1-indanones in moderate to good isolated yields was developed via a ruthenium-catalyzed tandem coupling and cyclization of simple aromatic acids with α,β-unsaturated ketones.

Switchable access to spiroindanones and 2-substituted 1-indanones could be achieved by manganese additive and H2O. Mn(II) additive is found to play an important role in this transformation, and a trace amount of water can promote the formation of 2-substituted 1-indanones.

Biochemical validation was performed in vitro, confirming the in silico results. Structural optimization was performed to mainly target VEGFR-2, but not aldehyde dehydrogenase 1.

Altogether, studies revealed bifunctional duocarmycin analogues as a new class of naturally derived compounds that express a very high cytotoxicity to cancer cells overexpressing aldehyde dehydrogenase 1 as well as VEGFR-2.",The Ba10S(VO3S)6 Oxysulfide: One-Dimensional Structure and Mixed Anion Chemical Bonding.,https://www.ncbi.nlm.nih.gov/pubmed/30620193,Inorganic chemistry,2019 04 26,"The new oxysulfide Ba10V6S7O18, which can be written as Ba10S(VO3S)6, was prepared by solid state reaction. It crystallizes in noncentrosymmetric space group P63 with the following unit cell parameters: a = 18.3018(2) Å and c = 8.6525(2) Å ( R1 = 3.21%). This original phase exhibits (VO3S) units separated by Ba2+ cations; the latter delimit one-dimensional (1D) hexagonal-like cavities filled by disordered sulfur S2- anions and arranged into two kinds of sulfur-deficient 1D channels. Density functional theory calculations were employed to gain insights into the chemical bonding and parameters that determine the structure, particularly the V-O versus V-S bonding inside the mixed anion VO3S tetrahedra, and the contribution of the S2- of the cavities. The title compound can be decomposed with three components mainly interacting by ionic bonds as follows, Ba10V6S7O18 → [Ba10]20+[S]2- [(VO3S)6]18-; this description may pave the way for the design of other phases related to this system with adjusted band gap features. In particular, the effect of the V(O,S)4:Ba ratio is discussed to emphasize the presence of the [S]2- component, in comparison with related structures such as Ba6V4O5S11 [Ba6(VO2S2)2(VS3O)(VS4)], as it contributes strongly just below the Fermi level with subsequent alteration of the band gap.",Palladium-Catalyzed Carbonylative Synthesis of Isoindolinones from Benzylamines with TFBen as the CO Source.,https://www.ncbi.nlm.nih.gov/pubmed/30620192,The Journal of organic chemistry,2019 02 01,"A palladium-catalyzed C-H carbonylation of benzylamines for the synthesis of isoindolinone scaffolds has been developed.

In complex with the KCNE1 accessory protein, it plays a role during the repolarization phase of the cardiac action potential. Mutations in the channel have been associated with several diseases, including congenital deafness and long QT syndrome. Nuclear magnetic resonance (NMR) structural studies in detergent micelles and a cryo-electron microscopy structure of KCNQ1 from Xenopus laevis have shown that the voltage sensor domain (Q1-VSD) of the channel has four transmembrane helices, S1-S4, being overall structurally similar with other VSDs. In this study, we describe a reliable method for the reconstitution of Q1-VSD into (POPC/POPG) lipid bilayer vesicles. Site-directed spin labeling electron paramagnetic resonance spectroscopy was used to probe the structural dynamics and topology of several residues of Q1-VSD in POPC/POPG lipid bilayer vesicles. Several mutants were probed to determine their location and corresponding immersion depth (in angstroms) with respect to the membrane. The dynamics of the bilayer vesicles upon incorporation of Q1-VSD were studied using 31P solid-state NMR spectroscopy by varying the protein:lipid molar ratios confirming the interaction of the protein with the bilayer vesicles. Circular dichroism spectroscopic data showed that the α-helical content of Q1-VSD is higher for the protein reconstituted in vesicles than in previous studies using DPC detergent micelles. This study provides insight into the structural topology and dynamics of Q1-VSD reconstituted in a lipid bilayer environment, forming the basis for more advanced structural and functional studies."

The intrinsically disordered nature of α-Syn makes this protein prone to self-association or heteroassociation with another protein or lipid. While conformational fluctuation and free radical chemistry have been shown to play important roles in its ability toward self- and heteroassociation, any systematic understanding of their contributions is missing. Here, we report an in vitro investigation of the interaction between α-Syn and cytochrome c in the oxidized (cyt c III) and reduced forms (cyt c II), in which cyt c III was found to induce a large compaction of α-Syn and inhibit the aggregation by favoring a hetero-dityrosine bond formation. In contrast, the presence of cyt c II did not result in any compaction and its presence was found to facilitate α-Syn aggregation. The variation in the charge distribution of the surface residues of cyt c III and cyt c II is expected to play a decisive role in their interaction with α-Syn.",Aptamer-Functionalized Exosomes: Elucidating the Cellular Uptake Mechanism and the Potential for Cancer-Targeted Chemotherapy.,https://www.ncbi.nlm.nih.gov/pubmed/30620179,Analytical chemistry,2019 02 06,"Exosomes (Exos) are nanoscale natural vehicles for transporting biomolecules to facilitate cell-to-cell communication, indicating a high potential of them for delivering therapeutics/diagnostics.

In this work, we used diacyllipid-aptamer conjugates as the targeting ligand to develop an aptamer-functionalized Exos (Apt-Exos) nanoplatform for cell type-specific delivery of molecular therapeutics. The cellular uptake mechanism of Apt-Exos was investigated in details, and distinct behavior was observed in comparison to free Exos. By combining the excellent molecular recognition capability of aptamers and the superiority of Exos as natural vehicles, Apt-Exos can efficiently deliver molecular drugs/fluorophores to target cancer cells, providing a promising delivery platform for cancer theranostics.",Lesson from Nature: Biomimetic Self-Assembling Phthalocyanines for High-Efficient Photothermal Therapy within the Biological Transparent Window.,https://www.ncbi.nlm.nih.gov/pubmed/30620178,ACS applied materials & interfaces,2019 06 03,"Development of a facile but high-efficient small organic molecule-based photothermal therapy (PTT) in the in vivo transparent window (800-900 nm) has been regarded as a minimally invasive and most promising strategy for potential clinical cancer treatment. Phthalocyanine (Pc) molecules with remarkable photophysical and photochemical properties as well as high extinction coefficients in the near-infrared region are highly desirable for PTT, but as far satisfying single-component Pc-based PTT within the in vivo transparent window (800-900 nm) has very rarely been reported. Herein, inspired by the self-assembly algorithm of natural bacteriochlorophylls c, d, and e, biomimetic self-assembling tetrahexanoyl Pc Bio-ZnPc with outstanding light-harvesting capacity was demonstrated to exhibit excellent PTT efficacy evidenced by both in vitro and in vivo results, within the biological transparent window.",Palladium-Based Metal-Ligand Assemblies: The Contrasting Behavior upon Addition of Pyridine or Acid.,https://www.ncbi.nlm.nih.gov/pubmed/30620177,Journal of the American Chemical Society,2019 04 20,"The stability of five different [Pd n(N-donor) m]2 n+ assemblies was examined by performing disassembly experiments with pyridine and with trifluoroacetic acid.

Multilevel high specific surface area exposure on fiber together with the hydrophilic decoration enables it to be more attractive to water molecules. These nanocones can capture fog droplet, generate coalesced droplet, and accordingly make droplet transport efficient because of Laplace pressure difference. Especially, a novel mechanism revealed that after the nanocone-decorated fiber was wetted, that is, a water film formed and immediately broke up into droplets, owing to the force relating to Rayleigh instability. Consequent lower retention surface realizes the formation of fast continuous water flow, rather than the traditional intermittent course. Thus, outstanding fog-harvesting efficiency was achieved on N3D, for example, probably reaching 865.1 kg/m2/day, where the mass of collected water within 2 h can raise up to over 240 times higher than the weight of an original 3D web without nanocones.

The SMCF@CNT anode exhibits high specific capacity, good rate performance, and cycling stability. The SMCF@CNT electrode has specific capacities of 236 mAh g-1 at 0.1 C and 108 mAh g-1 at 5 C and maintains over 193 mAh g-1 after 300 cycles at 1 C. Furthermore, a combined capacitive and diffusion-controlled K+ storage mechanism is proposed on the basis of the investigation using in situ Raman and quantitative analyses. By coupling the SMCF@CNT anode with the K0.3MnO2 cathode, a pouch cell with good flexibility delivers a capacity of 74.0 mAh g-1 at 20 mA g-1.

Shift current is a coherent displacement of electron density on the order of a lattice constant upon above-bandgap photoexcitation. A second-order nonlinear effect, it is forbidden by the inversion symmetry in the bulk GeSe crystals. Here, we use terahertz (THz) emission spectroscopy to demonstrate that ultrafast photoexcitation with wavelengths straddling both edges of the visible spectrum, 400 and 800 nm, launches a shift current in the surface layer of a bulk GeSe crystal, where the inversion symmetry is broken. The direction of the surface shift current determined from the observed polarity of the emitted THz pulses depends only on the orientation of the sample and not on the linear polarization direction of the excitation. Strong absorption by the low-frequency infrared-active phonons in the bulk of GeSe limits the bandwidth and the amplitude of the emitted THz pulses. We predict that reducing GeSe thickness to a monolayer or a few layers will result in a highly efficient broadband THz emission. Experimental demonstration of THz emission by the surface shift current in bulk GeSe crystals puts this 2D material forward as a candidate for next-generation shift current photovoltaics, nonlinear photonic devices, and THz sources.",Free-Standing Three-Dimensional CuCo2S4 Nanosheet Array with High Catalytic Activity as an Efficient Oxygen Electrode for Lithium-Oxygen Batteries.,https://www.ncbi.nlm.nih.gov/pubmed/30620172,ACS applied materials & interfaces,2019 02 15,"In this work, a novel free-standing CuCo2S4 nanosheet cathode (CuCo2S4@Ni) with high catalytic activity is fabricated for aprotic lithium-oxygen (Li-O2) battery.

The improved performance can be ascribed to the superb spinel structure of CuCo2S4, in which both Cu and Co exhibit more abundant redox properties, improving oxygen reduction reaction and oxygen evolution reaction kinetics effectively and boosting the electrochemical reactions. Furthermore, the well-designed architecture also plays a critical role in the improved performance.

The high yield of ethylene can be rationalized by the relay catalysis of Ag and Cu component around the Ag/Cu interface."

In combination with impaired mucociliary clearance, and dysregulation of defense function, bacterial infection follows with eventual airway damage and remodeling. Because of these inherent vulnerabilities, viral infections are also more severe and prolonged and appear to render the airway even more prone to bacterial infection. Airway acidity, deficient nitric oxide production and increased iron concentrations, further enhance the airway milieu's susceptibility to infection. Novel diagnostic techniques of the airway microbiome elucidate the coexistence of an array of non-virulent taxa beyond the recognized virulent organisms, predominantly Pseudomonas aeruginosa. The complex interplay between these two bacterial populations, including upregulation of virulence genes and utilization of mucin as a nutrient source, modulates the action of pathogens, modifies the CF airway milieu and contributes to the processes leading to airway derangement. The review provides an update on recent advances of the complex mechanisms that render the CF airway vulnerable to inflammation, infection and ultimately structural damage, the key pathogenetic elements of CF. The recent contributions on CF pathogenesis will hopefully help in identifying new prophylactic measures and therapeutic targets for this highly destructive disorder.","The effectiveness of self-management interventions in adults with chronic orofacial pain: A systematic review, meta-analysis and meta-regression.",https://www.ncbi.nlm.nih.gov/pubmed/30620145,"European journal of pain (London, England)",2019 04 30,"Psychosocial risk factors associated with chronic orofacial pain are amenable to self-management.

We have previously reported significant improvements in behavior, including increased social functioning, improved communication abilities, and decreased clinical symptoms in children with ASD, following treatment with a single infusion of autologous cord blood in a phase I open-label trial. In the current study, we aimed to understand whether these improvements were associated with concurrent changes in brain structural connectivity. Twenty-five 2- to 6-year-old children with ASD participated in this trial. Clinical outcome measures included the Vineland Adaptive Behavior Scales-II Socialization Subscale, Expressive One-Word Picture Vocabulary Test-4, and the Clinical Global Impression-Improvement Scale.

Behavioral improvements were associated with increased white matter connectivity in frontal, temporal, and subcortical regions (hippocampus and basal ganglia) that have been previously shown to show anatomical, connectivity, and functional abnormalities in ASD. The current results suggest that improvements in social communication skills and a reduction in symptoms in children with ASD following treatment with autologous cord blood infusion were associated with increased structural connectivity in brain networks supporting social, communication, and language abilities.

The developed method provides a straightforward and sustainable route towards δ-lactams, which feature strong antiviral properties (EC50 down to 4.6±1.8 μm) against human cytomegalovirus (HCMV). The clear advantages, which are easily available and inexpensive reagents, organic dyes, visible light, air/O2 and atom efficiency, make this system highly appealing for synthesis of versatile Strychnocarpine alkaloid derivatives with antiviral activity.",Supported Co-Re Bimetallic Catalysts with Different Structures as Efficient Catalysts for Hydrogenation of Citral.,https://www.ncbi.nlm.nih.gov/pubmed/30620120,ChemSusChem,2019 05 24,"Bimetallic Co-Re/TiO2 catalysts were developed for efficient citral hydrogenation. Bimetallic catalysts were prepared by co-impregnation (CI), successive-impregnation (SI), and surface redox method (SR). The arrangement between the Co and Re species on these systems was fully characterized using several techniques (TEM-energy-dispersive X-ray spectroscopy, H2 temperature-programmed reduction, temperature-programmed desorption, XRD, CO FTIR spectroscopy, model reaction of cyclohexane dehydrogenation), and their catalytic performances were evaluated for the selective hydrogenation of citral towards unsaturated alcohols. The Re and Co species are completely isolated in the CI sample, presenting a very limited Co-Re interaction. In SI samples, the metals coexist in a Janus-type structure with a concentration of Re around Co. Decoration/core-shell structures are observed for SR samples resulting from the redox exchange between the metallic surface of the parent Co/TiO2 catalyst and the Re7+ species of the modifier precursor salt. The contact degree between the two metals gradually increases as follows: Isolated structure (CI)<Janus-type structure(SI)<decoration/core-shell structure (SR). The unchanging structure of all SI samples independent of the Re loading leads to similar electron transfer, and the increase in Re content results in agglomeration of Re, thus decreasing the catalytic activity. Density-of-state (DOS) calculations prove that the high valence of Re is a disadvantage for the hydrogenation reaction. For SR samples, the increase of Re loading contributes to the electron transfer from Re to Co that is consistent with a change of structure from decoration to core-shell. The lack of directly accessible Co atoms for SR catalysts with fully coated structure decreases the efficiency of Re reduction. The presence of Co-Re interaction resulting from the close contact between metals plays a dominant role in the hydrogenation of citral. Nevertheless, an excessively high contact degree is unnecessary for citral hydrogenation once Co-Re interaction has formed.",MAL-PDT inhibits oral precancerous cells and lesions via autophagic cell death.,https://www.ncbi.nlm.nih.gov/pubmed/30620118,Oral diseases,2019 03 18,"Oral cancer is a common cancer with a high mortality rate.

Approximately 25% of diarrhea cases with secondary decompensation are considered to be idiopathic chronic diarrhea. The purpose of this study was to investigate the suspected but not systematically examined association between rotavirus infection and diarrhea with secondary decompensation among young rhesus macaques at the California National Primate Research Center (CNPRC). Blood and stool samples were collected from 89 randomly selected young animals (age range: 6 months to 1.5 years) and were tested for the presence of rotavirus antibody, and rotavirus antigen, respectively, using enzyme-linked immunosorbent assays (ELISA's). Test and clinical data were analyzed using Fisher's exact tests and multivariate logistic regression model. Our analysis indicates that rotavirus is endemic among young outdoor-housed rhesus macaques at the CNPRC. Although the relationship between detectable rotavirus antigen in stool and symptomatic diarrhea with secondary decompensation was not significant, there was a significant association between rotavirus seropositivity and a history of diarrhea with secondary decompensation within the past 6 months.

In this study on tropical japonica and aus diversity panels (170-220 genotypes), the degree of leaf rolling under drought was more affected by leaf morphology than by stomatal conductance, leaf water status, or maintenance of shoot biomass and grain yield. A range of canopy temperature and leaf rolling (measured as change in normalized difference vegetation index [ΔNDVI]) combinations were observed among aus genotypes, indicating that some genotypes continued transpiration while rolled. Association mapping indicated colocation of genomic regions for leaf rolling score and ΔNDVI under drought with previously reported leaf rolling genes and gene networks related to leaf anatomy. The relatively subtle variation across these large diversity panels may explain the lack of agreement of this study with earlier reports that used small numbers of genotypes that were highly divergent in hydraulic traits driving leaf rolling differences.

SHM pathophysiology relies on cortical spreading depression (CSD), which might be responsible for ischemic brain infarction. Cystic fibrosis (CF) is caused by a monogenic mutation of the chlorine transmembrane conductance regulator (CFTR), possibly altering brain excitability. We describe the case of a patient with CF, who had a migrainous stroke during an SHM attack. A 32-year-old Caucasian male was diagnosed with CF, with heterozygotic delta F508/unknown CFTR mutation. The patient experiences bouts of coughing sometimes triggering SHM attacks with visual phosphenes, aphasia, right-sided paresthesia, and hemiparesis. He had a 48-hour hemiparesis triggered by a bout of coughing with hemoptysis, loss of consciousness, and severe hypoxia-hypercapnia. MRI demonstrated transient diffusion hyperintensity in the left frontal-parietal-occipital regions resulting in a permanent infarction in the primary motor area. Later, a brain perfusion SPECT showed persistent diffuse hypoperfusion in the territories involved in diffusion-weighted imaging alteration. Migrainous infarction, depending on the co-occurrence of 2 strictly related phenomena, CSD and hypoxia, appears to be the most plausible explanation. Brain SPECT hypoperfusion suggests a more extensive permanent neuronal loss in territories affected by aura. CF may be then a risk factor for hemiplegic migraine and stroke since bouts of coughing can facilitate brain hypoxia, triggering auras.",Schwann cell guidance of nerve growth between synaptic sites explains changes in the pattern of muscle innervation and remodeling of synaptic sites following peripheral nerve injuries.,https://www.ncbi.nlm.nih.gov/pubmed/30620049,The Journal of comparative neurology,2019 03 20,"Terminal Schwann cells (SCs) are nonmyelinating glia that are a prominent component of the neuromuscular junction (NMJ) where motor neurons form synapses onto muscle fibers. These cells play important roles not only in development and maintenance of the neuromuscular synapse but also restoring synaptic function after nerve damage. In response to muscle denervation, terminal SCs undergo dramatic changes in their gene expression patterns as well as in their morphology, such as extending elaborate processes into inter-junctional space. These SC processes serve as a path to guide axon terminal sprouts from nearby innervated junctions, promoting rapid reinnervation of denervated fibers. We studied the role of terminal SCs in synapse reformation by using two different fluorescent proteins to simultaneously label motor axons and SCs; we examined these junctions repeatedly in living animals using a fluorescence microscope. Here, we show that alterations in the patterns of muscle innervation following recovery from nerve injury can be explained by SC guidance of regenerating axons.

Limited data exist on the transferability of calculators across healthcare systems. Calculator transferability to Australian community practice was evaluated for 1,401 stage II/III patients. Calibration and discrimination were assessed for overall (OS), cancer-specific (CSS) or recurrence-free survival (RFS). The US patient cohort-based calculators, A!O, MSKCC and MDA, significantly overestimated risks of recurrence and death in Australian patients, with 5-year OS, CSS and RFS prediction differences of -6.5% to -9.9%, -9.1% to -14.4% and - 3.8% to -6.8%, respectively (p < 0.001). Significant heterogeneity in calibration was observed for subgroups by tumor stage and treatment, age, gender, tumor location, ECOG and ASA score. Calibration appeared acceptable for the clinical trial patient-based MC calculator, but restricted tool applicability (stage III patients, ≥12 examined lymph nodes, receiving adjuvant treatment) limited the sample size. Compared to AJCC 7th edition tumor staging, calculators showed improved discrimination for OS, but no improvement for CSS and RFS. In conclusion, deficiencies in calibration limited transferability of US patient cohort-based survival calculators for early-stage colon cancer to the setting of Australian community practice. Our results demonstrate the utility for multi-feature survival calculators to improve OS predictions but highlight the importance for performance assessment of tools prior to implementation in an external health care setting.","Melatonin receptor expression in vocal, auditory, and neuroendocrine centers of a highly vocal fish, the plainfin midshipman (Porichthys notatus).",https://www.ncbi.nlm.nih.gov/pubmed/30620047,The Journal of comparative neurology,2019 03 20,"Melatonin plays a central role in entraining activity to the day-night cycle in vertebrates. Here, we investigate neuroanatomical substrates of melatonin-dependent vocal-acoustic behavior in the nocturnal and highly vocal teleost fish, the plainfin midshipman (Porichthys notatus). Using in situ hybridization (ISH) and quantitative real-time PCR (qPCR), we assess the mRNA distribution and transcript abundance of melatonin receptor subtype 1B (mel1b), shown to be important for vocalization in midshipman fish and songbirds. ISH shows robust mel1b expression in major nodes of the central vocal and auditory networks in the subpallium, preoptic area (POA), anterior hypothalamus, dorsal thalamus, posterior tuberculum, midbrain torus semicircularis and periaqueductal gray, and hindbrain. Mel1b label is also abundant in secondary targets of the olfactory, visual, and lateral line systems, as well as telencephalic regions that have been compared to the amygdala, extended amygdala, striatum, septum, and hippocampus of tetrapods. Q-PCR corroborates mel1b abundance throughout the brain and shows significant increases in the morning compared with nighttime in tissue samples inclusive of the telencephalon and POA, but remains stable in other brain regions. Plasma melatonin levels show expected increase at night. Our findings support the hypothesis that melatonin's stimulatory effects on vocal-acoustic mechanisms in midshipman is mediated, in part, by melatonin binding in vocal, auditory, and neuroendocrine centers. Together with robust mel1b expression in multiple telencephalic nuclei and sensory systems, the results further indicate an expression pattern comparable to that in birds and mammals that is indicative of melatonin's broad involvement in the modulation of physiology and behavior.",Extrastriate connectivity of the mouse dorsal lateral geniculate thalamic nucleus.,https://www.ncbi.nlm.nih.gov/pubmed/30620046,The Journal of comparative neurology,2019 04 04,"The mammalian visual system is one of the most well-studied brain systems. Visual information from the retina is relayed to the dorsal lateral geniculate nucleus of the thalamus (LGd). The LGd then projects topographically to primary visual cortex (VISp) to mediate visual perception. In this view, the VISp is a critical network hub where visual information must traverse LGd-VISp circuits to reach higher order ""extrastriate"" visual cortices, which surround the VISp on its medial and lateral borders. However, decades of conflicting reports in a variety of mammals support or refute the existence of extrastriate LGd connections that can bypass the VISp. Here, we provide evidence of bidirectional extrastriate connectivity with the mouse LGd. Using small, discrete coinjections of anterograde and retrograde tracers within the thalamus and cortex, our cross-validated approach identified bidirectional connectivity between LGd and extrastriate visual cortices. We find robust reciprocal connectivity of the medial extrastriate regions with LGd neurons distributed along the ""ventral strip"" border with the intergeniculate leaflet. In contrast, LGd input to lateral extrastriate regions is sparse, but lateral extrastriate regions return stronger descending projections to localized LGd areas. We show further evidence that axons from lateral extrastriate regions can overlap onto medial extrastriate-projecting LGd neurons in the ventral strip, providing a putative subcortical LGd pathway for communication between medial and lateral extrastriate regions. Overall, our findings support the existence of extrastriate LGd circuits and provide novel understanding of LGd organization in rodent visual system.","Differential innervation within a transverse plane of spinal gray matter by sensorimotor cortices, with special reference to the somatosensory cortices.",https://www.ncbi.nlm.nih.gov/pubmed/30620045,The Journal of comparative neurology,2019 03 20,"The corticospinal (CS) neurons projecting to the cervical cord distribute not only in motor-related cortical areas, but also in somatosensory areas, including the primary somatosensory cortex (S1).

Familial occurrence of the disease was noted in 21 patients (17%): 16 women and five men. Three family members were affected in three patients, two relatives in eight patients, and one relative in 10 patients, giving a total of 35 affected relatives. The patients' sisters (n = 16) were the most commonly involved, followed by mothers (n = 12), daughters (n = 2), brothers (n = 2), grandmothers (n = 2) and an aunt (n = 1). Bilateral manifestation of the disease was noted in 19 patients (90%) and in 31 (88%) of their affected relatives. The results suggest that carpal tunnel syndrome shows a moderate tendency to familial occurrence and, if so, it usually manifests bilaterally."

These species are expected to undergo rapid photochemical processing, affecting atmospheric composition. In this study, the photochemistry of (E)-2-butenedial and both E and Z isomers of 4-oxo-2-pentenal was investigated under natural sunlight conditions at the large outdoor atmospheric simulation chamber EUPHORE. Photochemical loss rates, relative to j(NO2), are determined to be j((E)-2-butenedial)/j(NO2) = 0.14 (±0.02), j((E)-4-oxo-2-pentenal)/j(NO2) = 0.18 (±0.01), and j((Z)-4-oxo-2-pentenal)/j(NO2) = 0.20 (±0.03). The major products detected for both species are a furanone (30-42%) and, for (E)-2-butenedial, maleic anhydride (2,5-furandione) (12-14%). The mechanism appears to proceed predominantly via photoisomerization to a ketene-enol species following γ-H abstraction. The lifetimes of the ketene-enol species in the dark from 2-butenedial and 4-oxo-2-pentenal are determined to be 465 s and 235 s, respectively. The ketene-enol can undergo ring closure to yield the corresponding furanone, or further unimolecular rearrangement which can subsequently form maleic anhydride. A minor channel (10-15%) also appears to form CO directly. This is presumed to be via a molecular elimination route of an initial biradical intermediate formed in photolysis, with an unsaturated carbonyl (detected here but not quantified) as co-product. α-Dicarbonyl and radical yields are very low, which has implications for ozone production from the photo-oxidation of unsaturated 1,4-dicarbonyls in the boundary layer. Photochemical removal is determined to be the major loss process for these species in the boundary layer with lifetimes of the order of 10-15 minutes, compared to >3 hours for reaction with OH.",Crossover in the inelastic electron tunneling spectra of conjugated molecules with direct Au-C links.,https://www.ncbi.nlm.nih.gov/pubmed/30620028,Physical chemistry chemical physics : PCCP,2019 01 17,"We use inelastic electron tunneling spectroscopy (IETS) first-principles simulations to identify and characterize the different vibrational modes of single conjugated molecules bonded to Au metal electrodes. The molecules are polyphenyls (with 1 to 4 benzene units) bonded to Au via highly conducting direct Au-C bonds. The short molecule shows near resonant elastic transmission, with a crossover to tunneling for the longer backbones. The calculated inelastic spectra exhibit dips in the IETS signal of the short molecule and peaks for the longer molecules. We characterize the symmetry of vibrational modes and scattering states and discuss the changes with increasing length, where the inelastic signal of different modes can be amplified, quenched or present a crossover as more benzene units are added to the molecular backbone.

The method is applied to the F- + CH3I reaction, thereby uncovering the role of the minima and transition states in the dynamics of the SN2 inversion, SN2 retention via front-side attack and double inversion, induced inversion, and proton-transfer channels. Stationary-point probability distributions, stationary-point-specific trajectory orthogonal projections, root-mean-square distance distributions, transition probability matrices, and time evolutions of the stationary points reveal long-lived front-side (F-ICH3) and hydrogen-bonded (F-HCH2I) complexes in the entrance channel and significant post-reaction ion-dipole complex (FCH3I-) formation in the SN2 exit channel. Most of the proton-transfer stationary points (FHCH2I-) participate in all the reaction channels with larger distance deviations than the double-inversion transition state. Significant forward-backward transitions are observed between the minima and transition states indicating complex, indirect dynamics.

The particularities and potential of RTM are demonstrated using the examples of DOPC liposomes, exosomes from human urine and rat hepatocytes, and a mixed sample of the transfection reagent FuGENE in diluted DNA solution. The approach of biomolecular component analysis for the estimation of the main biomolecular contributions (proteins, lipids, nucleic acids, carotenoids, etc.) is proposed and discussed. Direct Raman evidence for strong intra-sample biomolecular heterogeneity of individual optically trapped EVs, due to variable contributions from nucleic acids and carotenoids in some preparations, is reported. On the basis of the results obtained, we are making an attempt to convince the scientific community that RTM is a promising method of single-EV research; to our knowledge, it is the only technique available at the moment that provides unique information about the global biomolecular composition of a single vesicle or a small number of vesicles, thus being capable of unravelling the high diversity of EV subpopulations, which is one of the most significant urgent challenges to overcome.

Therefore, we developed a water-assisted transfer printing method for the fabrication and transfer of an AgNW-polydimethylsiloxane (PDMS) electrode. This innovative approach exhibits a robust ability for thin film transfer onto arbitrary substrates and has highly controlled and nondestructive characteristics. The obtained electrodes exhibited a high ratio of DC conductivity to optical conductivity of 200, a low sheet resistance of 9 Ω sq-1 at 82%, tensile strain (0% to 50%), and flexibility (bending radius of less than 2 mm) without significant loss of conductivity compared with devices fabricated through conventional methods. Furthermore, we demonstrated a novel textile-based flexible light-emitting electrochemical cell (PLEC) based on the stretchable AgNW-PDMS electrode and buckling concept, thereby realizing highly stretchable PLECs with excellent performance and mechanical robustness. The luminance intensity of the strained device was optimized to 58 cd m-2 at 7 V under 10% linear strain without damaging the electroluminescence properties. Notably, this effective and practical transfer method provides a way to develop electronic nanowire devices with unique configurations and high performances."

In addition to standard formaldehyde fixation, disuccinimidyl glutarate was included in the procedure, greatly increasing data quality. To illustrate the sensitivity of the optimized protocol, we provide high-quality ChIP-seq data for three independent factors (AR, FOXA1, and H3K27ac) from a single core needle prostate cancer biopsy specimen.

The ability of the thyroid epithelia to concentrate I- is ultimately dependent on functional Na+/ I- symporter (NIS) expression at the plasma membrane. Underscoring the significance of NIS for thyroid physiology, loss-of-function mutations in the NIS-coding SLC5A5 gene cause an I- transport defect, resulting in dyshormonogenic congenital hypothyroidism. Moreover, I- accumulation in the thyroid cell constitutes the cornerstone for radioiodide ablation therapy for differentiated thyroid carcinoma. However, differentiated thyroid tumors often exhibit reduced (or even undetectable) I- transport compared with normal thyroid tissue, and they are diagnosed as cold nodules on thyroid scintigraphy. Paradoxically, immunohistochemistry analysis revealed that cold thyroid nodules do not express NIS or express normal, or even higher NIS levels compared with adjacent normal tissue, but NIS is frequently intracellularly retained, suggesting the presence of posttranslational abnormalities in the transport of the protein to the plasma membrane. Ultimately, a thorough comprehension of the mechanisms that regulate NIS transport to the plasma membrane would have multiple implications for radioiodide therapy, opening the possibility to identify new molecular targets to treat radioiodide-refractory thyroid tumors. Therefore, in this review, we discuss the current knowledge regarding posttranslational mechanisms that regulate NIS transport to the plasma membrane under physiological and pathological conditions affecting the thyroid follicular cell, a topic of great interest in the thyroid cancer field.",Predicted Benign and Synonymous Variants in CYP11A1 Cause Primary Adrenal Insufficiency Through Missplicing.,https://www.ncbi.nlm.nih.gov/pubmed/30620006,Journal of the Endocrine Society,2019 03 06,"Primary adrenal insufficiency (PAI) is a potentially life-threatening condition that can present with nonspecific features and can be difficult to diagnose. We undertook next generation sequencing in a cohort of children and young adults with PAI of unknown etiology from around the world and identified a heterozygous missense variant (rs6161, c.940G>A, p.Glu314Lys) in CYP11A1 in 19 individuals from 13 different families (allele frequency within undiagnosed PAI in our cohort, 0.102 vs 0.0026 in the Genome Aggregation Database; P < 0.0001). Seventeen individuals harbored a second heterozygous rare disruptive variant in CYP11A1 and two had very rare synonymous changes in trans (c.990G>A, Thr330 = ; c.1173C>T, Ser391 =). Although p.Glu314Lys is predicted to be benign and showed no loss-of-function in an Escherichia coli assay system, in silico and in vitro studies revealed that the rs6161/c.940G>A variant, plus the c.990G>A and c.1173C>T changes, affected splicing and that p.Glu314Lys produces a nonfunctional protein in mammalian cells. Taken together, these findings show that compound heterozygosity involving a relatively common and predicted ""benign"" variant in CYP11A1 is a major contributor to PAI of unknown etiology, especially in European populations. These observations have implications for personalized management and demonstrate how variants that might be overlooked in standard analyses can be pathogenic when combined with other very rare disruptive changes.",Pituitary Pathology and Gene Expression in Acromegalic Cats.,https://www.ncbi.nlm.nih.gov/pubmed/30620005,Journal of the Endocrine Society,2019 01 10,"The prevalence of GH-secreting pituitary tumors in domestic cats (Felis catus) is 10-fold greater than in humans. The predominant inhibitory receptors of GH-secreting pituitary tumors are somatostatin receptors (SSTRs) and D2 dopamine receptor (DRD2). The expression of these receptors is associated with the response to somatostatin analog and dopamine agonist treatment in human patients with acromegaly. The aim of this study was to describe pathological features of pituitaries from domestic cats with acromegaly, pituitary receptor expression, and investigate correlates with clinical data, including pituitary volume, time since diagnosis of diabetes, insulin requirement, and serum IGF1 concentration. Loss of reticulin structure was identified in 15 of 21 pituitaries, of which 10 of 15 exhibited acinar hyperplasia. SSTR1, SSTR2, SSTR5, and DRD2 mRNA were identified in the feline pituitary whereas SSTR3 and SSTR4 were not. Expression of SSTR1, SSTR2, and SSTR5 was greater in acromegalic cats compared with controls. A negative correlation was identified between DRD2 mRNA expression and pituitary volume. The loss of DRD2 expression should be investigated as a mechanism allowing the development of larger pituitary tumors.",Identification and Functional Analysis of Six DAX1 Mutations in Patients With X-Linked Adrenal Hypoplasia Congenita.,https://www.ncbi.nlm.nih.gov/pubmed/30620004,Journal of the Endocrine Society,2019 01 10,DAX1 (NR0B1) mutations cause X-linked adrenal hypoplasia congenita (AHC) and hypogonadotropic hypogonadism (HH) in affected male patients.

In this study, we used a reverse genetics system to generate G5 HEV and examined the possibility of zoonotic infection. Capped and uncapped genomic G5 HEV RNAs generated by in vitro transcription were transfected into PLC/PRF/5 cells. Infectious G5 HEV was recovered from the capped G5 HEV RNA-transfected PLC/PRF/5 cells and the subsequently passaged cells. G5 HEV was also recovered from uncapped G5 HEV-transfected PLC/PRF/5 cells after a longer lag phase, suggesting that the 5'-cap structure is not essential but affected the efficiency of G5 HEV replication. G5 HEV infection was neutralized not only by anti-G5 HEV-like particles (HEV-LPs) antibody, but also by anti-G1, anti-G3, anti-G4, and anti-G7 HEV-LPs antibodies. G5 HEV was capable of infecting cynomolgus monkeys negative for anti-HEV antibody but not animals positive for anti-G7 HEV immunoglobulin G (IgG), indicating that cynomolgus monkeys were susceptible to G5 HEV, and the serotype of G5 HEV was identical to that of G7 HEV and human HEVs. Moreover, G5 HEV replication was efficiently inhibited by ribavirin and partially inhibited by sofosbuvir. Conclusion: Infectious G5 HEV was produced using a reverse genetics system, and the antigenicity was identical to that of human HEVs and G7 HEV. Transmission of G5 HEV to primates was confirmed by an experimental infection, providing evidence of the possibility of zoonotic infection by G5 HEV.",Constitutive Androstane Receptor Differentially Regulates Bile Acid Homeostasis in Mouse Models of Intrahepatic Cholestasis.,https://www.ncbi.nlm.nih.gov/pubmed/30620001,Hepatology communications,2019 04 04,"Bile acid (BA) homeostasis is tightly regulated by multiple transcription factors, including farnesoid X receptor (FXR) and small heterodimer partner (SHP). We previously reported that loss of the FXR/SHP axis causes severe intrahepatic cholestasis, similar to human progressive familial intrahepatic cholestasis type 5 (PFIC5). In this study, we found that constitutive androstane receptor (CAR) is endogenously activated in Fxr:Shp double knockout (DKO) mice. To test the hypothesis that CAR activation protects DKO mice from further liver damage, we generated Fxr;Shp;Car triple knockout (TKO) mice. In TKO mice, residual adenosine triphosphate (ATP) binding cassette, subfamily B member 11 (ABCB11; alias bile salt export pump [BSEP]) function and fecal BA excretion are completely impaired, resulting in severe hepatic and biliary damage due to excess BA overload. In addition, we discovered that pharmacologic CAR activation has different effects on intrahepatic cholestasis of different etiologies. In DKO mice, CAR agonist 1,4-bis[2-(3,5-dichloropyridyloxy)]benzene (TCPOBOP; here on TC) treatment attenuated cholestatic liver injury, as expected. However, in the PFIC2 model Bsep knockout (BKO) mice, TC treatment exhibited opposite effects that reflect increased BA accumulation and liver injury. These contrasting results may be linked to differential regulation of systemic cholesterol homeostasis in DKO and BKO livers. TC treatment selectively up-regulated hepatic cholesterol levels in BKO mice, supporting de novo BA synthesis. Conclusion: CAR activation in DKO mice is generally protective against cholestatic liver injury in these mice, which model PFIC5, but not in the PFIC2 model BKO mice. Our results emphasize the importance of the genetic and physiologic background when implementing targeted therapies to treat intrahepatic cholestasis.",Genes and Pathways Promoting Long-Term Liver Repopulation by Ex Vivo hYAP-ERT2 Transduced Hepatocytes and Treatment of Jaundice in Gunn Rats.,https://www.ncbi.nlm.nih.gov/pubmed/30620000,Hepatology communications,2019 01 11,"Hepatocyte transplantation is an attractive alternative to liver transplantation. Thus far, however, extensive liver repopulation by adult hepatocytes has required ongoing genetic, physical, or chemical injury to host liver. We hypothesized that providing a regulated proliferative and/or survival advantage to transplanted hepatocytes should enable repopulation in a normal liver microenvironment. Here, we repopulated livers of DPPIV- (dipeptidyl peptidase-4) rats and Ugt1a1 (uridinediphosphoglucuronate glucuronosyltransferase 1a1)-deficient Gunn rats (model of Crigler-Najjar syndrome type 1), both models without underlying liver injury, for up to 1 year by transplanting lenti-hYAP-ERT2 (mutated estrogen receptor ligand-binding domain 2)-transduced hepatocytes (YAP-Hc). Yap (yes-associated protein) nuclear translocation/function in YAP-Hc was regulated by tamoxifen. Repopulating YAP-Hc and host hepatocytes were fluorescence-activated cell sorting-purified and their transcriptomic profiles compared by RNAseq. After 1 year of liver repopulation, YAP-Hc clusters exhibited normal morphology, integration into hepatic plates and hepatocyte-specific gene expression, without dysplasia, dedifferentiation, or tumorigenesis. RNAseq analysis showed up-regulation of 145 genes promoting cell proliferation and 305 genes suppressing apoptosis, including hepatocyte growth factor and connective tissue growth factor among the top 30 in each category and provided insight into the mechanism of cell competition that enabled replacement of host hepatocytes by YAP-Hc. In Gunn rats transplanted with YAP-Hc+tamoxifen, there was a 65%-81% decline in serum bilirubin over 6 months versus 8%-20% with control-Hc, representing a 3-4-fold increase in therapeutic response. This correlated with liver repopulation as demonstrated by the presence of Ugt1a1-positive hepatocyte clusters in livers and western blot analysis of tissue homogenates. Conclusion: Tamoxifen-regulated nuclear translocation/function of hYAP-ERT2 enabled long-term repopulation of DPPIV-/- and Gunn rat livers by hYAP-ERT2-transduced hepatocytes without tumorigenesis. This cell transplantation strategy may offer a potential therapy for most of the inherited monogenic liver diseases that do not exhibit liver injury."

Methods & clinical development,2019 04 01,"Adeno-associated viral (AAV) vectors packaging the CRISPR-Cas9 system (AAV-CRISPR) can efficiently modify disease-relevant genes in somatic tissues with high efficiency. AAV vectors are a preferred delivery vehicle for tissue-directed gene therapy because of their ability to achieve sustained expression from largely non-integrating episomal genomes. However, for genome editizng applications, permanent expression of non-human proteins such as the bacterially derived Cas9 nuclease is undesirable. Methods are needed to achieve efficient genome editing in vivo, with controlled transient expression of CRISPR-Cas9. Here, we report a self-deleting AAV-CRISPR system that introduces insertion and deletion mutations into AAV episomes. We demonstrate that this system dramatically reduces the level of Staphylococcus aureus Cas9 protein, often greater than 79%, while achieving high rates of on-target editing in the liver. Off-target mutagenesis was not observed for the self-deleting Cas9 guide RNA at any of the predicted potential off-target sites examined. This system is efficient and versatile, as demonstrated by robust knockdown of liver-expressed proteins in vivo. This self-deleting AAV-CRISPR system is an important proof of concept that will help enable translation of liver-directed genome editing in humans.",Procalcitonin-Guided Antibiotic Therapy Reduces Antibiotic Use for Lower Respiratory Tract Infections in a United States Medical Center: Results of a Clinical Trial.,https://www.ncbi.nlm.nih.gov/pubmed/30619913,Open forum infectious diseases,2019 01 10,European trials using procalcitonin (PCT)-guided antibiotic therapy for patients with lower respiratory tract infections (LRTIs) have demonstrated significant reductions in antibiotic use without increasing adverse outcomes.

It can lower financial returns on infected farms by reducing farm productivity through output losses and control expenditures. A farm-level analysis of the economics of the disease was conducted taking account of farm variability and different disease prevalence levels. The aim was to assess the financial impacts of a livestock disease on farms and determine their financial vulnerability if farm support payments were to be removed under future policy reforms. A farm-level optimization model, ScotFarm, was used on 50 Scottish dairy farms taken from the Farm Business Survey to determine the impacts of the disease. A counterfactual comparison of five alternative ""disease"" scenarios with a ""no-disease"" scenario was carried out to evaluate economic impact of the disease. The extent of a farm's reliance on direct support payments was considered to be an indicator of their financial vulnerability. Under this definition, farms were grouped into three financial vulnerability risk categories; ""low risk,"" ""medium risk,"" and ""high risk"" farms. Results show that farms are estimated to incur a loss of 32% on average of their net profit under a standard disease prevalence level. Farms in the ""low risk"" and ""medium risk"" categories were estimated to have a lower financial impact of the disease (22 and 28% reduction on farm net profit, respectively) which, along with their lower reliance on farm direct support payments, indicate they would be more resilient to the disease under future changes in farm payment support. On the contrary, farms in the ""high risk"" category were estimated to have a reduction of 50% on their farm net profit. A majority of these farms (61%) in the ""high risk"" category move from being profitable to loss making under the standard disease scenario when farm support payments are removed. Of these, 15% do so because of the impact of the disease. These farms will be more vulnerable if changes were to be made in farm support payments under future agricultural policy reforms.","Phylogenetic and Genome Analysis of 17 Novel Senecavirus A Isolates in Guangdong Province, 2017.",https://www.ncbi.nlm.nih.gov/pubmed/30619897,Frontiers in veterinary science,2019 01 10,"Senecavirus A (SVA), an emerging RNA virus, is considered to be associated with porcine idiopathic vesicular disease (PIVD). From February to September 2017, 17 novel SVA strains were isolated from samples with the vesicular disease from Guangdong Province, China. Full-length genomes and individual genes of the 17 new SVA isolates were genetically and phylogentically analyzed. Results showed that complete genomes, VP1, 3C, and 3D genes of these 17 novel SVA isolates revealed 96.5-99.8%, 95.1-99.9%, 95.6-100%, and 96.9-99.7% nucleotides identities, respectively. Phylogenetic analyses based on sequences of full-length genomes, VP1, 3C, and 3D genes indicated that 17 novel SVA isolates separated to three well-defined groups.

In this study living strains of Clostridium perfringens type A (CpA) and non-pathogenic Escherichia (E.) coli strains harvested from healthy piglets were administered to piglets prior to first colostrum intake in order to prevent disease caused by pathogenic variants of the same bacterial species by competitive exclusion. In addition, it was investigated whether these potential beneficial colonizers were able to prevent harmful effects of infection with Cystoisospora (C.) suis as a primary invasive pathogen. In a first trial, half of the piglets from four litters were treated with a bacterial cocktail consisting of two E. coli and four CpA strains immediately after birth on two consecutive days, while the other half of the litters served as control group. In a second trial, piglets were treated following the protocol of the first trial, and additionally all piglets were infected 4 h after the end of littering with ~1,000 sporulated oocysts of a C. suis laboratory strain. General health, body weight development, fecal consistency and, in the second trial, oocyst excretion were monitored from birth until weaning. No adverse effects of the cocktail on the health status were observed. Treated piglets of the first trial showed a higher average daily weight gain until weaning. In the second trial, no significant differences were found with respect to average daily weight gain, fecal consistency, amount, and duration of oocyst excretion assessed in daily samples. In treatment group 51.1% and in the control group 38.5% of the fecal samples were positive for oocysts in autofluorescence. The average duration of oocyst excretion was longer in treatment group (7.7 days) than in control group (5.6 days). Application of bacterial cocktail could not effectively minimize disease symptoms caused by C. suis. There was a trend toward an increase in severity of disease symptoms in treated pigs, suggesting that the synergism between CpA and C. suis was independent of the bacterial strains, but is exclusively dominated by the pathogenic effect of C. suis.",Systems Thinking in Practice: Participatory Modeling as a Foundation for Integrated Approaches to Health.,https://www.ncbi.nlm.nih.gov/pubmed/30619895,Frontiers in veterinary science,2019 01 10,"One Health (OH), EcoHealth (EH), and Planetary Health (PH) share an interest in transdisciplinary efforts that bring together scientists, citizens, government and private sectors to implement contextualized actions that promote adaptive health management across human, animal and ecosystem interfaces. A key operational element underlying these Integrated Approaches to Health (IAH) is use of Systems Thinking as a set of tools for integration. In this paper we discuss the origins and epistemology of systems thinking and argue that participatory modeling, informed by both systems theory and expertise in facilitating engagement and social learning, can help ground IAH theoretically and support its development. Participatory modeling is iterative and adaptive, which is necessary to deal with complexity in practice. Participatory modeling (PM) methods actively involve affected interests and stakeholders to ground the field of inquiry in a specific social-ecological context. Furthermore, PM processes act to reconcile the diverse understandings of the empirical world that stem from divergent discipline and community viewpoints. In this perspective article, we argue that PM can support systems thinking in practice and is essential for IAH implementation. Accordingly we invite PH, OH, and EH practitioners to systematically incorporate specialists in systems science and social engagement and facilitation. This will enable the appropriate contextualization of research practice and interventions, and ensure a balanced representation of the roles and relationships of medical, biological, mathematical, and social disciplines. For completeness, funding schemes supporting IAH need to follow the same iterative, adaptive, and participative processes to accompany IAH projects throughout their implementation.",Dog Training Intervention Shows Social-Cognitive Change in the Journals of Incarcerated Youth.,https://www.ncbi.nlm.nih.gov/pubmed/30619894,Frontiers in veterinary science,2019 01 11,"There is limited research assessing the effectiveness of Animal-Assisted Therapy in at-risk adolescent populations. In a recent study, 138 adjudicated adolescents participated in a randomized controlled trial of an animal-assisted intervention, in which participants either trained shelter dogs (Teacher's Pet group) or walked the dogs (control group), with both groups participating in classroom work related to dogs (1). Journal writing was a part of class activities for all youth in the study. Conventional assessments of youth behavior made by staff or youth themselves did not demonstrate the expected differences between the groups favoring the dog training group, as youth in both groups showed a significant increase in staff and youth rated internalizing behavior problems and empathy from the beginning to the end of the project (1). However, subsequent analysis of the journal content from 73 of the adjudicated youth reported here, did reveal significant differences between treatment and control groups, favoring the Teacher's Pet group. Youth participating in the dog training intervention showed through their journal writing greater social-cognitive growth, more attachment, and more positive attitudes toward the animal-assisted intervention compared to youth in the control group. The 73 youth whose journals were available were very similar to youth in the larger group. Their results illustrate that journaling can be a useful method of assessing effects of similar animal-assisted interventions for at-risk youth. Writing done by youth receiving therapy appeared to promote self-reflection, desirable cognitive change, and prosocial attitudes that may signify improving quality of life for such youth. The expressive writing of participants could reveal important effects of treatment beyond the behavioral changes that are often the targeted outcomes of animal-assisted interventions.",Comparison of Three Methods to Assess the Potential for Bushpig-Domestic Pig Interactions at the Wildlife-Livestock Interface in Uganda.,https://www.ncbi.nlm.nih.gov/pubmed/30619893,Frontiers in veterinary science,2019 01 11,"Bushpigs (Potamochoerus larvatus) are considered a nuisance to farmers because of their crop raiding habits. Through their incursions into farmlands, they may interact with free-ranging domestic pigs and potentially cause transmission of infectious diseases such as African Swine Fever (ASF). The role of the bushpig in the epidemiology of ASF is poorly known and one of the gaps of knowledge is precisely the nature of interaction between bushpigs and domestic pigs. Thus, in this study, we investigated the frequency of bushpig visits to crop fields in rural communities where ASF is endemic, at the edge of a wildlife protected area in northwestern Uganda, to better understand the potential for interaction and disease transmission. We used three methods (questionnaires, camera traps, and observations for tracks) to assess bushpig visits to farmland. These methods were implemented concurrently in 28 farms during rainy and dry seasons. The results obtained by each of the three methods were analyzed by generalized linear mixed models. Potential risk factors including crop type, season, and landscape characteristics related to bushpig ecology were tested as explanatory variables. A generalized linear model and the Kendall test were used to compare the results and consistency of the frequency values obtained by the three methods. A high percentage (75%) of interviewed farmers reported visits from bushpigs in 29.6% of assessed crops (n = 145), and a frequency of 0.014 +/-0.05 visits per night was obtained through camera-trapping. Bushpig tracks were detected in 36% of sessions of observation. Cassava (Manihot esculenta) and groundnut (Arachis hypogaea L.) crop fields were the most visited, and these visits were more common during the rainy than the dry season. Distances from crop sites to the boundary of the protected area and to the river also influenced visit frequency. Camera-trapping was the least sensitive method while questionnaires and track observations presented consistent and complementary results to characterize spatial and temporal visits of bushpig into the crop fields. Evidence from our study shows that when used in combination, these methods can provide useful data to improve our understanding of the interactions between bushpigs and domestic pigs at the wildlife-domestic interface.",The Interplay of SIRT1 and Wnt Signaling in Vascular Calcification.,https://www.ncbi.nlm.nih.gov/pubmed/30619890,Frontiers in cardiovascular medicine,2019 01 10,"Vascular calcification is a major health risk and is highly correlated with atherosclerosis, diabetes, and chronic kidney disease. The development of vascular calcification is an active and complex process linked with a multitude of signaling pathways, which regulate promoters and inhibitors of osteogenesis, the balance of which become deregulated in disease conditions. SIRT1, a protein deacetylase, known to be protective in inhibiting oxidative stress and inflammation within the vessel wall, has been shown as a possible key player in modulating the cell-fate determining canonical Wnt signaling pathways. Suppression of SIRT1 has been reported in patients suffering with cardiovascular pathologies, suggesting that the sustained acetylation of osteogenic factors could contribute to their activation and in turn, lead to the progression of calcification. There is clear evidence of the synergy between β-Catenin and elevated Runx2, and with Wnt signaling being β-Catenin dependent, further understanding is needed as to how these molecular pathways converge and interact, in order to provide novel insight into the mechanism by which smooth muscle cells switch to an osteogenic differentiation programme. Therefore, this review will describe the current concepts of pathological soft tissue mineralization, with a focus on the contribution of SIRT1 as a regulator of Wnt signaling and its targets, discussing SIRT1 as a potential target for manipulation and therapy.",Clinical Relevance of Troponin T Profile Following Cardiac Surgery.,https://www.ncbi.nlm.nih.gov/pubmed/30619889,Frontiers in cardiovascular medicine,2019 01 10,"Background: Peak post-operative cardiac troponin T (cTnT) independently predicts mid- and long-term outcome of cardiac surgery patients. A few studies however have reported two peaks of cTnT over the first 48-72 h following myocardial reperfusion. The aim of the current study was to better understand underlying reasons of these different cTnT profiles and their possible relevance in terms of clinical outcome. Methods: All consecutive adult cardiac surgical procedures performed with an extra-corporeal circulation during a >6 years period were retrospectively evaluated. Patients with a myocardial infarction (MI) < 8 days were excluded. cTnT profile of patients with at least one value ≥1 ng/mL value were categorized according to the time occurrence of the peak value. Univariable and multivariable analysis were performed to identify factors influencing early vs. late increase of cTnT values, and to verify the correlation of early vs. late increase with clinical outcome. Results: Data of 5,146 patients were retrieved from our prospectively managed registry. From 953 with at least one cTnT value ≥1 ng/mL, peak occurred ≤ 6 h (n = 22), >6 to ≤ 12 h (n = 366), >12 to ≤ 18 h (n = 176), >18 to ≤ 24 h (171), >24 h (218). Age (OR: 1.023; CI: 1.016-1.030) and isolated CABG (OR: 1.779; CI: 1.114-2.839) were independent predictors of a late increase of cTnT over a limit of 1 ng/ml (p < 0.05), whereas isolated valve procedures (OR: 0.685; CI: 0.471-0.998) and cross-clamp duration (OR: 0.993; CI: 0.990-0.997) independently predicted an early elevation (p < 0.05). Delayed elevation as opposed to early elevation correlated with a higher rate of post-operative complications including MI (19.8 vs. 7.2%), new renal insufficiency (16.3 vs. 6.7%), MACCE (32.0 vs. 15.5%), or death (7.4 vs. 4.4%). Conclusion: Profile of cTnT elevation following cardiac surgery depends on patients' intrinsic factors, type of surgery and duration of cross-clamp time. Delayed increase is of higher clinically relevance than prompt post-operative elevation.",Into the Wild: GWAS Exploration of Non-coding RNAs.,https://www.ncbi.nlm.nih.gov/pubmed/30619888,Frontiers in cardiovascular medicine,2019 01 10,"Genome-wide association studies (GWAS) have proven a fundamental tool to identify common variants associated to complex traits, thus contributing to unveil the genetic components of human disease. Besides, the advent of GWAS contributed to expose unexpected findings that urged to redefine the framework of population genetics. First, loci identified by GWAS had small effect sizes and could only explain a fraction of the predicted heritability of the traits under study. Second, the majority of GWAS hits mapped within non-coding regions (such as intergenic or intronic regions) where new functional RNA species (such as lncRNAs or circRNAs) have started to emerge. Bigger cohorts, meta-analysis and technical improvements in genotyping allowed identification of an increased number of genetic variants associated to coronary artery disease (CAD) and cardiometabolic traits. The challenge remains to infer causal mechanisms by which these variants influence cardiovascular disease development. A tendency to assign potential causal variants preferentially to coding genes close to lead variants contributed to disregard the role of non-coding elements. In recent years, in parallel to an increased knowledge of the non-coding genome, new studies started to characterize disease-associated variants located within non-coding RNA regions. The upcoming of databases integrating single-nucleotide polymorphisms (SNPs) and non-coding RNAs together with novel technologies will hopefully facilitate the discovery of causal non-coding variants associated to disease. This review attempts to summarize the current knowledge of genetic variation within non-coding regions with a focus on long non-coding RNAs that have widespread impact in cardiometabolic diseases.",Endothelial Phenotype Evoked by Low Dose Carvedilol in Pulmonary Hypertension.,https://www.ncbi.nlm.nih.gov/pubmed/30619887,Frontiers in cardiovascular medicine,2019 01 11,"Background: The therapeutic benefits of β-blockers are well established in left heart failure. The Pulmonary Arterial Hypertension Treatment with Carvedilol for Heart Failure [PAHTCH] study showed safety and possible benefit of carvedilol in pulmonary arterial hypertension (PAH) associated right heart failure over 6 months. This study aims at evaluating the short-term cardiovascular effects and early mechanistic biomarkers of carvedilol therapy. Methods: Thirty patients with pulmonary hypertension (PH) received low dose carvedilol (3.125 mg twice daily) for 1 week prior to randomization to placebo, low-dose, or dose-escalating carvedilol therapy. Echocardiography was performed at baseline and 1 week. Exercise capacity was assessed by 6 min walk distance (6MWD). The L-arginine/nitric oxide pathway and other biological markers of endothelial function were measured. Results: All participants tolerated 1 week of carvedilol without adverse effects. After 1 week of carvedilol, 6MWD and heart rate at peak exercise did not vary (both p > 0.1). Heart rate at rest and 1 min post walk dropped significantly (both p < 0.05) with a trend for increase in heart rate recovery (p = 0.08). Right ventricular systolic pressure (RVSP) decreased by an average of 13 mmHg (p = 0.002). Patients who had a decrease in RVSP of more than 10 mm Hg were defined as responders (n = 17), and those with a lesser drop as non-responders (n = 13). Responders had a significant drop in pulmonary vascular resistance (PVR) after 1 week of carvedilol (p = 0.004). In addition, responders had a greater decrease in heart rate at rest and 1 min post walk compared to non-responders (both p < 0.05). Responders had higher plasma arginine and global bioavailability of arginine at baseline compared to non-responders (p = 0.03 and p = 0.05, respectively). After 1 week of carvedilol, responders had greater increase in urinary nitrate (p = 0.04). Responders treated with carvedilol had a sustained drop in RVSP and PVR after 6 months of carvedilol with no change in cardiac output. Conclusions: Low-dose carvedilol for 1 week can potentially identify a PH responder phenotype that may benefit from β-blockers that is associated with less endothelial dysfunction.

While appetite loss and physical inactivity, which are also frequently seen in dementia, appear to contribute to sarcopenia, to date, no study has investigated this association. Objective: The aim of this study was to examine factors associated with sarcopenia, including appetite and physical activity, in patients with MCI and early-stage AD. Methods: The study subjects comprised 205 outpatients (MCI, n = 151; early-stage AD, n = 54) who were being treated at the Memory Clinic, National Center for Geriatrics, and Gerontology and had a Mini-Mental State Examination (MMSE) score of 21 or higher. All subjects were assessed for appetite by using the Council on Nutrition Appetite Questionnaire (CNAQ). Confounding variables assessed included physical activity, activities of daily living, mood, body mass index (BMI), nutritional status, and medications. Sarcopenia was defined as low muscle mass and low handgrip strength or slow gait speed. Multivariate logistic regression analyses were performed with adjustment for age, gender, education, and confounding variables to examine the association of sarcopenia with physical activity and appetite. Furthermore, sub-analyses were also conducted to clarify the relationship between CNAQ sub-items and sarcopenia. Results: The prevalence of sarcopenia among the subjects was 14.6% (n = 30). Patients with sarcopenia had lower CNAQ scores (those with sarcopenia, 26.7 ± 3.5; those without, 29.1 ± 2.5). Multivariate analysis showed that BMI (odds ratio [OR], 0.675; 95% confidence interval [CI], 0.534-0.853), polypharmacy (OR, 4.489; 95% CI, 1.315-15.320), and CNAQ (OR, 0.774; 95% CI, 0.630-0.952) were shown to be associated with sarcopenia. Physical activity was not associated with sarcopenia. Of the sub-items of the CNAQ, appetite (OR, 0.353; 95% CI, 0.155-0.805), feeling full (OR, 0.320; 95% CI = 0.135-0.761), and food tastes compared to when younger (OR, 0.299; 95% CI, 0.109-0.818) were shown to be associated with sarcopenia. Conclusions: These results suggest that appetite could be a modifiable risk factor for sarcopenia in patients with MCI and early-stage AD. A comprehensive approach to improving appetite may prove effective in preventing sarcopenia.",Efficacy of a Therapeutic Diet on Dogs With Signs of Cognitive Dysfunction Syndrome (CDS): A Prospective Double Blinded Placebo Controlled Clinical Study.,https://www.ncbi.nlm.nih.gov/pubmed/30619873,Frontiers in nutrition,2019 01 10,"Cognitive dysfunction syndrome (CDS) is a common condition in senior dogs, which may be analogous to dementia such as Alzheimer's disease (AD) in people. In humans, AD has been associated with many risk factors such as reduced cerebral glucose metabolism, docosahexaenoic acid (DHA) deficiency, chronic oxidative stress, and chronic inflammation. By targeting some of these risk factors, we have developed two nutritional solutions (medium chain triglyceride, MCT and Brain Protection Blend, BPB) to enhance cognitive function and slow aging-induced cognitive decline. These have been positively evaluated in colony housed senior dogs and cats. The objective of this clinical study was to evaluate the effects of diets with MCTs and the BPB on client-owned dogs with CDS. Participating veterinary clinics screened senior dogs for signs of CDS as determined by a Senior Canine Behavior Questionnaire and a Canine Medical Health Questionnaire. Eighty-seven dogs were randomly enrolled into one of three diet groups with 29 dogs per group: Control, 6.5% MCT oil + BPB (6.5% MCT diet), 9% MCT oil + BPB (9% MCT diet). Diets were fed for a period of 90 days, and each dog's CDS signs were re-evaluated at day 30 and day 90. All 6 categories of the CDS signs were significantly improved (p <0.05) in the dogs given the 6.5% MCT diet at the end of the 90-day study. Control only improved in 4 out 6 categories. The 9% MCT diet only improved in dogs that accepted the diet. The results from this dog study confirm the benefits of MCT and BPB in managing clinical signs of CDS in dogs. The results support our hypothesis that targeting known risk factors associated with brain aging and AD is able to improve symptoms of CDS in dogs. These data may facilitate the development of similar nutrient blends to manage MCI and AD.",Herbal Medicine Ninjin'yoeito in the Treatment of Sarcopenia and Frailty.,https://www.ncbi.nlm.nih.gov/pubmed/30619872,Frontiers in nutrition,2019 01 10,"Frailty and sarcopenia have recently gained considerable attention in terms of preventive care in Japan, which has an ever-increasing aging population. Sarcopenia is defined as atrophy of skeletal muscles caused by the age-related decrease in growth hormone/insulin-like growth factor and sex hormones. The Japanese Ministry of Health, Labor and Welfare reports that frailty can lead to impairment of both mental and physical functioning. Chronic diseases such as diabetes and dementia may underlie frailty. It is important to prevent progression of frailty and extend the healthy lifespan. In herbal medicine practice, including Japanese Kampo medicine, ""Mibyo,"" a presymptomatic state, has long been recognized and may be applicable to frailty. Kampo medicines may include several medicinal plants and are thought to have the potential to improve symptoms of frailty, such as loss of appetite and body weight, fatigue, and sarcopenia, as well as anxiety, depression, and cognitive decline. Ninjin'yoeito (Ren Shen Yang Ying Tang) is the most powerful Kampo medicine and has been widely applied to palliative care of cancer patients. This review includes recent anti-aging studies and describes the effects and mechanisms of Ninjin'yoeito (Ren Shen Yang Ying Tang) when used for frailty or to extend a healthy life expectancy.",Lack of Hypothalamus Polysialylation Inducibility Correlates With Maladaptive Eating Behaviors and Predisposition to Obesity.,https://www.ncbi.nlm.nih.gov/pubmed/30619871,Frontiers in nutrition,2019 01 10,"High variability exists in individual susceptibility to develop overweight in an obesogenic environment and the biological underpinnings of this heterogeneity are poorly understood. In this brief report, we show in mice that the vulnerability to diet-induced obesity is associated with low level of polysialic acid-neural cell adhesion molecule (PSA-NCAM), a factor of neural plasticity, in the hypothalamus. As we previously shown that reduction of hypothalamic PSA-NCAM is sufficient to alter energy homeostasis and promote fat storage under hypercaloric pressure, inter-individual variability in hypothalamic PSA-NCAM might account for the vulnerability to diet-induced obesity. These data support the concept that reduced plasticity in brain circuits that control appetite, metabolism and body weight confers risk for eating disorders and obesity.",Proteolytic Surface-Shaving and Serotype-Dependent Expression of SPI-1 Invasion Proteins in Salmonella enterica Subspecies enterica.,https://www.ncbi.nlm.nih.gov/pubmed/30619870,Frontiers in nutrition,2019 01 10,"We performed proteolytic surface-shaving with trypsin on three strains/sevovars of Salmonella enterica enterica (SEE): Newport, Kentucky, and Thompson. Surfaced-exposed proteins of live bacterial cells were digested for 15 min. A separate 20 h re-digestion was also performed on the supernatant of each shaving experiment to more completely digest protein fragments into detectable peptides for proteomic analysis by nano-liquid chromatography-electrospray ionization-Orbitrap mass spectrometry. Control samples (i.e., no trypsin during surface-shaving step) were also performed in parallel. We detected peptides of flagella proteins: FliC (filament), FliD (cap), and FlgL (hook-filament junction) as well as peptides of FlgM (anti-σ28 factor), i.e., the negative regulator of flagella synthesis. For SEE Newport and Thompson, we detected Salmonella pathogenicity island 1 (SPI-1) secreted effector/invasion proteins: SipA, SipB, SipC, and SipD, whereas no Sip proteins were detected in control samples. No Sip proteins were detected for SEE Kentucky (or its control) although sip genes were confirmed to be present. Our results may suggest a biological response (<15 min) to proteolysis of live cells for these SEE strains and, in the case of Newport and Thompson, a possible invasion response.",Food-Aid Quality Correlates Positively With Diet Quality of Food Pantry Users in the Leket Israel Food Bank Collaborative.,https://www.ncbi.nlm.nih.gov/pubmed/30619869,Frontiers in nutrition,2019 01 10,"Introduction: In many affluent countries, including Israel, networks of food banks and pantries have increasing responsibility to alleviate endemic poverty and food insecurity. While they may relieve acute hunger, their long-term influence on health and well-being is poorly understood. Methods: An exploratory cross-sectional telephone survey assessed both adequacy and quality of food aid provided via food pantries in the Leket Israel food bank network, in relation to recipients' dietary needs and health. The quality of food baskets and recipient diets were given a Healthy Portions Score (HPS) to measure compliance with Government guidelines for a ""Basic Healthy Food Basket,"" and a Nutrient Density Score (NDS) to capture how well the food achieved the recommended dietary allowance (RDA) for vital macro and micronutrients. A total of 105 pantry users were surveyed from 16 pantries around the country. Results: The basket HPS correlated positively and highly significantly with dietary quality (individual NDS) after adjusting for gender, marital status and country of birth (standardized β = 0.22, p = 0.03). Nearly half (46%) reported food insecurity with hunger. Two thirds were overweight or obese, and anemia, cardiovascular and metabolic disease were prevalent. The average food basket provides 30% of energy, 55% of protein, 50% of fiber, but only 33% or less of the household requirement for most minerals and vitamins. Only 60% of participants met their estimated energy requirements, and the intake of many essential micronutrients was well below the RDA. Fruits and vegetable portions contributed by Leket Israel correlated positively with the dietary quality (individual NDS) after adjustment for the same covariates (Standardized β = 0.20, p = 0.04). Discussion: A structured telephone survey proved a feasible method to study the impact of food-aid quality on the nutrition and health of food pantry users in an affluent country. Food baskets with fruits, vegetables and higher quality nutrition were correlated with healthier diets among the recipients. Data correlating food-aid quality and recipient diet and health is essential to effective policy making.","The Effect of Kyolic Aged Garlic Extract on Gut Microbiota, Inflammation, and Cardiovascular Markers in Hypertensives: The GarGIC Trial.",https://www.ncbi.nlm.nih.gov/pubmed/30619868,Frontiers in nutrition,2019 01 10,"Background: Previous research suggests Kyolic-aged-garlic-extract to be effective in reducing blood pressure in a large proportion of hypertensive patients similar to first-line standard antihypertensive medication. High blood pressure has been linked to gut dysbiosis, with a significant decrease in microbial richness and diversity in hypertensives compared to normotensives. Furthermore, gut dysbiosis has been associated with increased inflammatory status and risk of cardiovascular events. Objective: To assess the effect of Kyolic aged GARlic extract on Gut microbiota, Inflammation, and Cardiovascular markers, including blood pressure, pulse wave velocity and arterial stiffness. Methods: A total of 49 participants with uncontrolled hypertension completed a double-blind randomized placebo-controlled trial of 12-weeks, investigating the effect of daily intake of aged-garlic-extract (1.2 g containing 1.2 mg S-allylcysteine) or placebo on blood pressure, pulse wave velocity and arterial stiffness, inflammatory markers, and gut microbiota. Results: Mean blood pressure was significantly reduced by 10 ± 3.6 mmHg systolic and 5.4 ± 2.3 mmHg diastolic compared to placebo. Vitamin B12 status played a role in responsiveness to garlic on blood pressure in 17% of patients. Garlic significantly lowered central blood pressure, pulse pressure and arterial stiffness (p < 0.05). Trends observed in inflammatory markers TNF-α and IL-6 need to be confirmed in larger trials. Furthermore, aged-garlic-extract improved gut microbiota, evident by higher microbial richness and diversity with a marked increase in Lactobacillus and Clostridia species after 3 months of supplementation. Conclusions: Kyolic-aged-garlic-extract is effective in reducing blood pressure in patients with uncontrolled hypertension, and has the potential to improve arterial stiffness, inflammation, and gut microbial profile. Aged-garlic-extract is highly tolerable with a high safety profile as a stand-alone or adjunctive antihypertensive treatment, with multiple benefits for cardiovascular health.

Atmospheric cold plasma (ACP) is a potential alternate to customary approaches for non-thermal decontamination of foods. In this study, the efficacy of a dielectric barrier discharge ACP system against Salmonella (Salmonella Typhimurium, ATCC 13311; Salmonella Choleraesuis, ATCC 10708) and Escherichia coli (ATCC 25922, ATCC 11775) was explored. For each bacteria, a two-strain mixture at 8 log10 CFU/ml was spot inoculated on the surface of Golden Delicious apples, air dried, and exposed to ACP at a fixed distance of 35 mm, input power of 200 W for 30, 60, 120, 180, and 240 s. Bacterial inactivation was achieved in all treatment times with highest reduction of 5.3 log10 CFU/cm2 for Salmonella and 5.5 log10 CFU/cm2 for E. coli. Our results showed that reductions were interrelated to exposure time and ranged from 1.3 to 5.3 and 0.6 to 5.5 log10 CFU/cm2 for Salmonella and E. coli, respectively. Salmonella and E. coli significantly decreased (>5.0 log) at 180 and 240 s as compared to 30, 60, and 120 s exposure. Microbial inactivation data was modeled by using Weibull distribution. These findings demonstrate the potential of ACP as a postharvest technology to effectively reduce pathogens on apples, with reference to Salmonella and E. coli.",Gluten-Free Products for Celiac Susceptible People.,https://www.ncbi.nlm.nih.gov/pubmed/30619866,Frontiers in nutrition,2019 01 10,"The gluten protein of wheat triggers an immunological reaction in some gluten-sensitive people with HLA-DQ2/8 genotypes, which leads to Celiac disease (CD) with symptomatic damage in the small intestinal villi. Glutenin and gliadin are two major components of gluten that are essentially required for developing a strong protein network for providing desired viscoelasticity of dough. Many non-gluten cereals and starches (rice, corn, sorghum, millets, and potato/pea starch) and various gluten replacers (xanthan and guar gum) have been used for retaining the physical-sensorial properties of gluten-free, cereal-based products. This paper reviews the recent advances in the formulation of cereal-based, gluten-free products by utilizing alternate flours, starches, gums, hydrocolloids, enzymes, novel ingredients, and processing techniques. The pseudo cereals amaranth, quinoa, and buckwheat, are promising in gluten-free diet formulation. Genetically-modified wheat is another promising area of research, where successful attempts have been made to silence the gliadin gene of wheat using RNAi techniques. The requirement of quantity and quality for gluten-free packaged foods is increasing consistently at a faster rate than lactose-free and diabetic-friendly foods. More research needs to be focused on cereal-based, gluten-free beverages to provide additional options for CD sufferers.",Hypoxia Impairs Initial Outgrowth of Endothelial Colony Forming Cells and Reduces Their Proliferative and Sprouting Potential.,https://www.ncbi.nlm.nih.gov/pubmed/30619865,Frontiers in medicine,2019 01 10,"Vascular homeostasis and regeneration in ischemic tissue relies on intrinsic competence of the tissue to rapidly recruit endothelial cells for vascularization. The mononuclear cell (MNC) fraction of blood contains circulating progenitors committed to endothelial lineage. These progenitors give rise to endothelial colony-forming cells (ECFCs) that actively participate in neovascularization of ischemic tissue. To evaluate if the initial clonal outgrowth of ECFCs from cord (CB) and peripheral blood (PB) was stimulated by hypoxic conditions, MNCs obtained from CB and PB were subjected to 20 and 1% O2 cell culture conditions. Clonal outgrowth was followed during a 30 day incubation period. Hypoxia impaired the initial outgrowth of ECFC colonies from CB and also reduced their number that were developing from PB MNCs. Three days of oxygenation (20% O2) prior to hypoxia could overcome the initial CB-ECFC outgrowth. Once proliferating and subcultured the CB-ECFCs growth was only modestly affected by hypoxia; proliferation of PB-ECFCs was reduced to a similar extent (18-30% reduction). Early passages of subcultured CB- and PB-ECFCs contained only viable cells and few if any senescent cells. Tube formation by subcultured PB-ECFCs was also markedly inhibited by continuous exposure to 1% O2. Gene expression profiles point to regulation of the cell cycle and metabolism as major altered gene clusters. Finally we discuss our counterintuitive observations in the context of the important role that hypoxia has in promoting neovascularization."

Yet Thy-1 is emerging as a key regulator of differentiation in cells of endodermal, mesodermal, and ectodermal origin, acting as both a ligand (for certain integrins and other receptors), and as a receptor, able to modulate signaling and hence differentiation in the Thy-1-expressing cell. This is an extraordinary diversity of molecular pathways to be controlled by a molecule that does not even cross the cell membrane. Here I review aspects of the cell biology of Thy-1, and studies of its role as deduced from gene knock-out studies, that suggest how this protein can participate in so many different signaling-related functions.

Despite their clinical heterogeneity, which remains an open question, laminopathies are commonly caused by mutations in the LMNA gene, encoding the nuclear proteins Lamin A and C. These two proteins are main components of the nuclear lamina and are involved in several biological processes. Besides the well-known structural function in the nucleus, their role in regulating chromatin organization and transcription has emerged in the last decade, supporting the hypothesis that the disruption of this layer of regulation may be mechanism underlying the disease. Indeed, recent studies that show various epigenetic defects in cells carrying LMNA mutations, such as loss of heterochromatin, changes in gene expression and chromatin remodeling, strongly support this view. However, those findings are restricted to few cell types in humans, mainly because of the limited accessibility of primary cells and the difficulties to culture them ex-vivo. On the other hand, animal models might fail to recapitulate phenotypic hallmarks of the disease as of humans. To fill this gap, models based on induced pluripotent stem cell (iPSCs) technology have been recently generated that allowed investigations on diverse cells types, such as mesenchymal stem cells (MSCs), vascular and smooth muscle cells and cardiomyocytes, and provided a platform for investigating mechanisms underlying the pathogenesis of laminopathies in a cell-type specific human context. Nevertheless, studies on iPSC-based models of laminopathy have expanded only in the last few years and, with the advancement of reprogramming and differentiation protocols, their number is expecting to further increase over time. This review will give an overview of models developed thus far, with a focus on the novel insights on epigenetic mechanisms underlying the disease in different human cellular contexts. Perspectives and future directions of the field will be also given, highlighting the potential of those models for preclinical studies for identifying molecular targets and their translational impact on patients' cure.",Possible Role of PHD Inhibitors as Hypoxia-Mimicking Agents in the Maintenance of Neural Stem Cells' Self-Renewal Properties.,https://www.ncbi.nlm.nih.gov/pubmed/30619851,Frontiers in cell and developmental biology,2019 01 10,"Hypoxia is the most critical factor for maintaining stemness. During embryonic development, neural stem cells (NSCs) reside in hypoxic niches, and different levels of oxygen pressure and time of hypoxia exposure play important roles in the development of NSCs. Such hypoxic niches exist in adult brain tissue, where the neural precursors originate. Hypoxia-inducible factors (HIFs) are key transcription heterodimers consisting of regulatory α-subunits (HIF-1α, HIF-2α, HIF-3α) and a constitutive β-subunit (HIF-β). Regulation of downstream targets determines the fate of NSCs. In turn, the stability of HIFs-α is regulated by prolyl hydroxylases (PHDs), whose activity is principally modulated by PHD substrates like oxygen (O2), α-ketoglutarate (α-KG), and the co-factors ascorbate (ASC) and ferrous iron (Fe2+). It follows that the transcriptional activity of HIFs is actually determined by the contents of O2, α-KG, ASC, and Fe2+. In normoxia, HIFs-α are rapidly degraded via the ubiquitin-proteasome pathway, in which PHDs, activated by O2, lead to hydroxylation of HIFs-α at residues 402 and 564, followed by recognition by the tumor suppressor protein von Hippel-Lindau (pVHL) as an E3 ligase and ubiquitin labeling. Conversely, in hypoxia, the activity of PHDs is inhibited by low O2 levels and HIFs-α can thus be stabilized. Hence, suppression of PHD activity in normoxic conditions, mimicking the effect of hypoxia, might be beneficial for preserving the stemness of NSCs, and it is clinically relevant as a therapeutic approach for enhancing the number of NSCs in vitro and for cerebral ischemia injury in vivo. This study will review the putative role of PHD inhibitors on the self-renewal of NSCs.",The Sweet Surrender: How Myeloid Cell Metabolic Plasticity Shapes the Tumor Microenvironment.,https://www.ncbi.nlm.nih.gov/pubmed/30619850,Frontiers in cell and developmental biology,2019 01 10,"Immune cells are one of the most versatile cell types, as they can tailor their metabolic activity according to their required function. In response to diverse environmental cues, immune cells undergo metabolic reprogramming to support their differentiation, proliferation and pro-inflammatory effector functions. To meet a dramatic surge in energetic demand, immune cells rewire their metabolism to utilize aerobic glycolysis. This preferential use of glycolysis even under aerobic conditions is well established in tumor cells, and is known as the ""Warburg effect."" Tumor cells avidly use glucose for aerobic glycolysis, thereby creating a nutrient-starved microenvironment, outcompeting T cells for glucose, and directly inhibiting T-cell anti-tumoral effector function. Given that both immune and tumor cells use similar modes of metabolism in the tumor stroma, it is imperative to identify a therapeutic window in which immune-cell and tumor-cell glycolysis can be specifically targeted. In this review, we focus on the Warburg metabolism as well as other metabolic pathways of myeloid cells, which comprise a notable niche in the tumor environment and promote the growth and metastasis of malignant tumors. We examine how differential immune-cell activation triggers metabolic fate, and detail how this forbidding microenvironment succeeds in shutting down the vigorous anti-tumoral response. Finally, we highlight emerging therapeutic concepts that aim to target immune-cell metabolism. Improving our understanding of immunometabolism and immune-cell commitment to specific metabolic fates will help identify alternative therapeutic approaches to battle this intractable disease.",Heparan Sulfate as a Therapeutic Target in Tauopathies: Insights From Zebrafish.,https://www.ncbi.nlm.nih.gov/pubmed/30619849,Frontiers in cell and developmental biology,2019 01 10,"Microtubule-associated protein tau (MAPT) hyperphosphorylation and aggregation, are two hallmarks of a family of neurodegenerative disorders collectively referred to as tauopathies. In many tauopathies, including Alzheimer's disease (AD), progressive supranuclear palsy (PSP) and Pick's disease, tau aggregates are found associated with highly sulfated polysaccharides known as heparan sulfates (HSs). In AD, amyloid beta (Aβ) peptide aggregates associated with HS are also characteristic of disease. Heparin, an HS analog, promotes misfolding, hyperphosphorylation and aggregation of tau protein in vitro. HS also provides cell surface receptors for attachment and uptake of tau seeds, enabling their propagation. These findings point to HS-tau interactions as potential therapeutic targets in tauopathies. The zebrafish genome contains genes paralogous to MAPT, genes orthologous to HS biosynthetic and chain modifier enzymes, and other genes implicated in AD. The nervous system in the zebrafish bears anatomical and chemical similarities to that in humans. These homologies, together with numerous technical advantages, make zebrafish a valuable model for investigating basic mechanisms in tauopathies and identifying therapeutic targets. Here, we comprehensively review current knowledge on the role of HSs in tau pathology and HS-targeting therapeutic approaches. We also discuss novel insights from zebrafish suggesting a role for HS 3-O-sulfated motifs in tau pathology and establishing HS antagonists as potential preventive agents or therapies for tauopathies.","The Relationship Between Microbial Community Structures and Environmental Parameters Revealed by Metagenomic Analysis of Hot Spring Water in the Kirishima Area, Japan.",https://www.ncbi.nlm.nih.gov/pubmed/30619848,Frontiers in bioengineering and biotechnology,2019 01 10,"Diverse microorganisms specifically inhabit extreme environments, such as hot springs and deep-sea hydrothermal vents. To test the hypothesis that the microbial community structure is predictable based on environmental factors characteristic of such extreme environments, we conducted correlation analyses of microbial taxa/functions and environmental factors using metagenomic and 61 types of physicochemical data of water samples from nine hot springs in the Kirishima area (Kyusyu, Japan), where hot springs with diverse chemical properties are distributed in a relatively narrow area. Our metagenomic analysis revealed that the samples can be classified into two major types dominated by either phylum Crenarchaeota or phylum Aquificae. The correlation analysis showed that Crenarchaeota dominated in nutrient-rich environments with high concentrations of ions and total carbons, whereas Aquificae dominated in nutrient-poor environments with low ion concentrations. These environmental factors were also important explanatory variables in the generalized linear models constructed to predict the abundances of Crenarchaeota or Aquificae. Functional enrichment analysis of genes also revealed that the separation of the two major types is primarily attributable to genes involved in autotrophic carbon fixation, sulfate metabolism and nitrate reduction. Our results suggested that Aquificae and Crenarchaeota play a vital role in the Kirishima hot spring water ecosystem through their metabolic pathways adapted to each environment. Our findings provide a basis to predict microbial community structures in hot springs from environmental parameters, and also provide clues for the exploration of biological resources in extreme environments.",Harvest of the Oleaginous Microalgae Scenedesmus obtusiusculus by Flocculation From Culture Based on Natural Water Sources.,https://www.ncbi.nlm.nih.gov/pubmed/30619847,Frontiers in bioengineering and biotechnology,2019 01 10,"Harvest and dewatering poses a significant economical burden for industrial algae biomass production. To mitigate these effects, energy efficient techniques for these process steps have to be developed. Flocculation of the microalgae Scenedesmus obtusiusculus in salt based medium was induced by pH-shift and alternatively by addition of two biological flocculants, chitosan, and the commercial tannin CFL-PT. This is the first time that CFL-PT is used as an algae flocculant particularly focusing on harvesting of halophilic strains. The method was characterized and subsequently optimized. In comparison to biological flocculants, induction by pH shift is far cheaper, but due to buffering effects of the brackish cultivation medium infeasible amounts of base are required to raise the pH-value. tannin appears to be superior compared to chitosan not only in the absence of algae organic matter (AOM), but tannin-based harvest is also more robust regarding culture pH in presence of AOM. A higher flocculant-demand for modified tannin compared to chitosan is offset by the lower price. Given the employed strain and cultivation conditions, cultivation time had no pronounced effect on flocculation efficiencies (FE) while algae zeta-potential and bacterial communities also remained stable.",Rheological Properties and Age-Related Changes of the Human Vitreous Humor.,https://www.ncbi.nlm.nih.gov/pubmed/30619846,Frontiers in bioengineering and biotechnology,2019 01 10,"The vitreous humor is a fragile, transparent hydrogel situated between the lens and the retina, occupying 80% of the eye's volume. Due to its viscoelastic behavior, the vitreous serves as a mechanical damper for the eye, absorbing impacts, and protecting the lens and retina. The vitreous liquefies with age, which compromises its function as a shock absorber and causes complications including retinal detachment, macular holes, and vitreous hemorrhage. Studies on the viscoelastic properties of the vitreous have been limited. Rheological testing of the vitreous has commonly been done on non-primate mammalian species. Human vitreous rheological properties have been previously reported; however, various measurement techniques were used, resulting in data that differed by orders of magnitude. Shear rheometry is commonly used to characterize soft tissues and hydrogels such as the vitreous humor. However, no human vitreous rheological data have been reported using this technique, preventing direct comparison to other published work. Additionally, no age-related changes in the mechanical properties of the human vitreous humor have been reported. Human vitreous samples (n = 39, aged 62 ± 15 years) were tested using a shear rheometer. Small amplitude oscillatory shear and creep experiments were performed. The linear viscoelastic region of the human vitreous was found to be below 1% strain. The solid phase of the old human vitreous was found to be stiffer than the young human vitreous and the porcine vitreous. The stiffness of the human vitreous gel also appeared to be positively correlated with age. Vitreous dehydration due to a decrease in hyaluronic acid concentration with age was proposed to cause the stiffening of the solid phase of the vitreous gel. Vitreous liquefaction, therefore, might be characterized as a simultaneous increase in liquid volume and localized stiffening of the vitreous gel. The phase separation of the vitreous humor with age has been hypothesized as the cause of many vitreous-related complications. This study provides viscoelastic properties and age-related changes of the human vitreous humor, which will aid in the design of biomimetic vitreous substitutes, enhancement in analyzing intravitreal transport of therapeutics, and understanding the pathological conditions of the vitreous humor.",Ensiled Wet Storage Accelerates Pretreatment for Bioconversion of Corn Stover.,https://www.ncbi.nlm.nih.gov/pubmed/30619843,Frontiers in bioengineering and biotechnology,2019 01 10,"Organic acids produced during ensiled wet storage are beneficial during the storage process, both for biomass preservation, and to aid in mild in-situ pretreatment. However, there is concern these acids could later have negative impacts on downstream processes, especially microbial fermentation. Organic acids can inhibit microbial metabolism or growth, which in turn could affect biofuel productivity or yield. This study investigated the interaction of organic acids produced during ensiled storage with subsequent pretreatment of the resulting corn stover silage, as well as the potential for interference with downstream ethanol fermentation. Interaction with pretreatment was observed by measuring xylan and glucan removal and the formation of inhibitors. The results indicated that organic acids generally do not impede downstream processes and in fact can be beneficial. The levels of organic acids produced during 220 days of storage jar tests at 23°C or 37°C, and their transformation during pretreatment, remained below inhibitory levels. Concentrations of individual acids did not exceed 6 g per liter of the pretreated volume, and < 5% on a dry matter basis. Whereas, unensiled corn stover required 15 min of 190°C pretreatment to optimize sugar release, ensiled corn stover could be treated equally effectively at a lower pretreatment duration of 10 min. Furthermore, the different organic acid profiles that accumulate at various storage moisture levels (35-65%) do not differ significantly in their impact on downstream ethanol fermentation. These results indicate biorefineries using ensiled corn stover feedstock at 35-65% moisture levels can expect as good or better biofuel yields as with unensiled stover, while reducing pretreatment costs.",Magnetic Force-Based Microfluidic Techniques for Cellular and Tissue Bioengineering.,https://www.ncbi.nlm.nih.gov/pubmed/30619842,Frontiers in bioengineering and biotechnology,2019 01 10,"Live cell manipulation is an important biotechnological tool for cellular and tissue level bioengineering applications due to its capacity for guiding cells for separation, isolation, concentration, and patterning.

Furthermore, magnetic-based operations can be readily combined with microfluidic principles by precisely allowing control over the spatiotemporal distribution of physical and chemical factors for cell manipulation. In this review, we present recent applications of magnetic force-based cell manipulation in cellular and tissue bioengineering with an emphasis on applications with microfluidic components. Following an introduction of the theoretical background of magnetic manipulation, components of magnetic force-based cell manipulation systems are described. Thereafter, different applications, including separation of certain cell fractions, enrichment of rare cells, and guidance of cells into specific macro- or micro-arrangements to mimic natural cell organization and function, are explained. Finally, we discuss the current challenges and limitations of magnetic cell manipulation technologies in microfluidic devices with an outlook on future developments in the field."

Due to their porosity and biocompatibility, nano- or microgels can be integrated with various biologics to form a bio-hybrid system. They can support living cells as a scaffold; entrap bioactive molecules as a drug carrier or encapsulate microorganisms as a semi-permeable membrane. Especially, researchers have created various modes of functional dynamics into these bio-hybrid systems. From one side, the encapsulating materials can respond to the external stimulus and release the cargo.

Assessment of the biomedical applications of metallosupramolecular assemblies is an emerging field of research that stems from the recently demonstrated promising results on such systems. After the pioneering works of Therrien and coworkers on organometallic Ru-cages with promising anticancer properties, this topic has evolved to the more recent studies on bioactivity of supramolecular coordination complexes built from different metal ions and various multidentate ligands. Sufficient amount of data on the anticancer activity of metallosupramolecules has already been reported and allows outlining some general tendencies in the structural aspects of the biological activity. The main structural properties of the complexes that can be readily modified to enhance their activity are the size, the shape and charge of the formed complexes. Moreover, the intrinsic properties of the building components could predetermine some of the main characteristics of the overall supramolecular complex, such as its optical properties, chemical reactivity, solubility, etc., and could, thereby, define the areas of its biomedical applications. The unique structural property of most of the metallosupramolecular assemblies, however, is the presence of a discrete cavity that renders a whole range of additional applications resulting from specific host-guest interactions. The encapsulations of small bioactive or fluorescent molecules have been employed for delivery or recognition purposes in many examples. On the other hand, metallosupramolecules have been imbedded into target-specific polymeric nanoparticles that resulted in a successful combination of their therapeutic and diagnostic properties, making them promising for theranostic application in cancer treatment. The aim of this review paper is to mark out some key tendencies in the reported metallosupramolecular structures in relation with their biological activity and potential areas of biomedical application.

This probe consists of two DNA strands, a streptavidin (SA) aptamer labeled by fluorophore and its totally complementary DNA (cDNA) with a phosphate group on the 5' end. Upon ALP introduction, the phosphate group on the cDNA is hydrolyzed, leaving the unhydrolyzed cDNA sequence for lambda exonuclease (λ exo) digestion and releasing SA aptamer for binding to SA beads, which results in fluorescence enhancement of SA beads that can be detected by flow cytometry or microscopy. We have achieved a detection limit of 0.012 U/mL with a detection range of 0.02~0.15 U/mL in buffer and human serum. These figures of merit are better than or comparable to those of other methods. Because the fluorescence signal is localized on the beads, they can be separated to remove fluorescence background from complicated biological systems. Notably, the new strategy not only applies to ALP detection with simple design, easy operation, high sensitivity, and good compatibility in complex solution, but also can be utilized in ALP-linked immunosorbent assays for the detection of a wide range of targets.",Interfaces Between Cathode and Electrolyte in Solid State Lithium Batteries: Challenges and Perspectives.,https://www.ncbi.nlm.nih.gov/pubmed/30619824,Frontiers in chemistry,2019 01 10,"Solid state lithium batteries are widely accepted as promising candidates for next generation of various energy storage devices with the probability to realize improved energy density and superior safety performances. However, the interface between electrode and solid electrolyte remain a key issue that hinders practical development of solid state lithium batteries. In this review, we specifically focus on the interface between solid electrolytes and prevailing cathodes. The basic principles of interface layer formation are summarized and three kinds of interface layers can be categorized. For typical solid state lithium batteries, a most common and daunting challenge is to achieve and sustain intimate solid-solid contact. Meanwhile, different specific issues occur on various types of solid electrolytes, depending on the intrinsic properties of adjacent solid components. Our discussion mostly involves following electrolytes, including solid polymer electrolyte, inorganic solid oxide and sulfide electrolytes as well as composite electrolytes. The effective strategies to overcome the interface instabilities are also summarized. In order to clarify interfacial behaviors fundamentally, advanced characterization techniques with time, and atomic-scale resolution are required to gain more insights from different perspectives. And recent progresses achieved from advanced characterization are also reviewed here. We highlight that the cooperative characterization of diverse advanced characterization techniques is necessary to gain the final clarification of interface behavior, and stress that the combination of diverse interfacial modification strategies is required to build up decent cathode-electrolyte interface for superior solid state lithium batteries.",Selective Hydrolysis of Ovalbumin Promoted by Hf(IV)-Substituted Wells-Dawson-Type Polyoxometalate.,https://www.ncbi.nlm.nih.gov/pubmed/30619823,Frontiers in chemistry,2019 01 10,"The reactivity and selectivity of Wells-Dawson type polyoxometalate (POM), K16[Hf(α2-P2W17O61)2]·19H2O (Hf1-WD2), have been examined with respect to the hydrolysis of ovalbumin (OVA), a storage protein consisting of 385 amino acids. The exact cleavage sites have been determined by Edman degradation experiments, which indicated that Hf1-WD2 POM selectively cleaved OVA at eight peptide bonds: Phe13-Asp14, Arg85-Asp86, Asn95-Asp96, Ala139-Asp140, Ser148-Trp149, Ala361-Asp362, Asp362-His363, and Pro364-Phe365. A combination of spectroscopic methods including 31P NMR, Circular Dichroism (CD), and Tryptophan (Trp) fluorescence spectroscopy were employed to gain better understanding of the observed selective cleavage and the underlying hydrolytic mechanism. 31P NMR spectra have shown that signals corresponding to Hf1-WD2 gradually broaden upon addition of OVA and completely disappear when the POM-protein molar ratio becomes 1:1, indicating formation of a large POM/protein complex. CD demonstrated that interactions of Hf1-WD2 with OVA in the solution do not result in protein unfolding or denaturation even upon adding an excess of POM. Trp fluorescence spectroscopy measurements revealed that the interaction of Hf1-WD2 with OVA (K

However, most of the relevant developmental work has focused on synthesizing novel PDI-based structures, and few paid attentions to the selection of the polymer donor in PDI-based solar cells. Wide bandgap polymer (PBDB-T) and narrow bandgap polymer (PBDTTT-EFT) are known as the most efficient polymer donors in polymer solar cells (PSCs). While PBDB-T is in favor with non-fullerene acceptors achieving power conversion efficiency (PCE) more than 12%, PBDTTT-EFT is one of the best electron donors with fullerene acceptors with PCE up to 10%. Despite the different absorption profiles, the working principle of these benchmark polymer donors with a same electron acceptor, specially PDI-based acceptors, was rarely compared. To this end, we used PBDB-T and PBDTTT-EFT as the electron donors, and 1,1'-bis(2-methoxyethoxyl)-7,7'-(2,5-thienyl) bis-PDI (Bis-PDI-T-EG) as the electron acceptor to fabricate PSCs, and systematically compared their differences in device performance, carrier mobility, recombination mechanism, and film morphology.","Systematic Synthesis and Properties Evaluation of Dicationic Ionic Liquids, and a Glance Into a Potential New Field.",https://www.ncbi.nlm.nih.gov/pubmed/30619821,Frontiers in chemistry,2019 01 10,"Dicationic ionic liquids (DILs), a subset of the ionic liquid (IL) family, have attracted growing interest in recent years, and the range of applications within which they are investigated is constantly expanding. However, data which allows structure to property correlation of a DIL is still limited, and thus selecting an appropriate salt to address a specific challenge can be problematic. In comparison to traditional ILs, DILs physico-chemical properties can be tuned by changing the length and type of spacer which connects the cationic heads as well as the type of cation. This in turn could give rise to symmetrical or asymmetrical DILs. In this work, a systematic study of a homogeneous class of 12 dibromide DILs and 12 di-carboxylate salts has been performed. The latter class of DILs were also compared to mono cation derivatives. The different traditional exchange methods to prepare carboxylate DILs have been evaluated and an insight into the drawbacks encountered is also presented. Prepared DILs were characterized (NMR, TGA, DSC) allowing the influence of the structure on their thermal stability to be understood. Most DILs were obtained as solid salts after careful drying. For some of these compounds, a new possible application was studied, namely their use as hydrogen bond acceptors (HBA) of deep eutectic mixtures, showing again some significant structural related effects.","Magnesium-Sodium Hybrid Battery With High Voltage, Capacity and Cyclability.",https://www.ncbi.nlm.nih.gov/pubmed/30619820,Frontiers in chemistry,2019 01 10,"Rechargeable magnesium battery has been widely considered as a potential alternative to current Li-ion technology. However, the lack of appropriate cathode with high-energy density and good sustainability hinders the realization of competitive magnesium cells. Recently, a new concept of hybrid battery coupling metal magnesium anode with a cathode undergoing the electrochemical cycling of a secondary ion has received increased attention. Mg-Na hybrid battery, for example, utilizes the dendritic-free deposition of magnesium at the anode and fast Na+-intercalation at the cathode to reversibly store and harvest energy. In the current work, the principles that take the full advantage of metal Mg anode and Na-battery cathode to construct high-performance Mg-Na hybrid battery are described. By rationally applying such design principle, we constructed a Mg-NaCrO2 hybrid battery using metal Mg anode, NaCrO2 cathode and a mixture of all-phenyl complex (PhMgCl-AlCl3, Mg-APC) and sodium carba-closo-dodecaborate (NaCB11H12) as dual-salt electrolyte. The Mg-NaCrO2 cell delivered an energy density of 183 Wh kg-1 at the voltage of 2.3 V averaged in 50 cycles. We found that the amount of electrolyte can be reduced by using solid MgCl2 as additional magnesium reservoir while maintaining comparable electrochemical performance.

The shift in the wavelength of the rugate reflectance band maximum at each position along a transect across the two surface chemistries, as derived from the hyperspectral imaging, could discriminate between the different solvents and concentrations of solvents, while the change in hue derived from the color camera data along an analogous transect did not provide discrimination. The discrimination between solvents was mainly due to the two different surface chemistries, and the gradient associated with the change in the rugate reflectance band wavelength did not affect the selectivity significantly. There was spatial variability in the spectral and color responses along the transect independent of the overall rugate reflectance band wavelength gradient and pore-wall surface chemistries, and this was attributed to factors such as the presence of striations in the silicon wafer from which the porous silicon was prepared."

A study implemented in 2010 investigated the prevalence of Cryptosporidium and Giardia sps., as part of a long-term gorilla health-monitoring program at Bwindi through regular fecal sample collection, and comparative pathogen analysis at the human/gorilla/livestock interface. Samples collected from habituated and non-habituated gorillas, community-owned livestock herds and people at Bwindi were screened for Cryptosporidium and Giardia sps. using ImmunoSTAT Commercial Field Kit and doubtful samples confirmed with Direct Fluorescence Antibody Test (DFA). Giardia was found in 5.5% of livestock, 40% of symptomatic humans from the local hospital and 9.5% of asymptomatic park staff, but not in gorillas. Cryptosporidium was found in 3.1% of habituated gorillas, 4.7% of livestock, and 62.4% of park staff. Whereas, previous studies have compared Cryptosporidium and Giardia sps. in gorillas and livestock, this is the first study making a comparison in humans, gorillas and livestock. Unlike previous studies in Bwindi and Virungas, no Giardia sp. was found in gorillas. The improving hygiene and sanitation of local communities sharing a habitat with gorillas through Village Health and Conservation Teams (VHCTs) established in 2007, could have contributed to the decreased prevalence of Giardia in this mountain gorilla population. Cryptosporidium sp. only found in the habituated gorillas could be associated with human interaction, similar to previous studies. A subsequent VHCT was selected for each village with positive human samples and where gorillas often range, local health centers were mobilized to educate patients on the health risks of collecting water from unprotected sources and cattle water troughs were built.

However, WGS has traditionally relied on microbial culture in order to obtain pathogen specific DNA for sequencing. This has severely limited the application of whole genome sequencing on pathogens with fastidious culturing requirements. In addition, the widespread adoption of culture-independent diagnostic tests has reduced availability of cultured isolates for confirmatory testing and surveillance. These recent developments have created demand for the implementation of techniques enabling direct sequencing of microbial genomes in clinical samples without having to culture an isolate. However, sequencing of specific organisms from clinical samples can be affected by high levels of contaminating DNA from the host and other commensal microorganisms. Several methods have been introduced for selective lysis of host cells and/or separate specific organisms from a clinical sample. This review examines the different approaches for sample preparation that have been used in diagnostic and public health laboratories for metagenomic sequencing.","Gender, Personality Traits and Experience With Psychiatric Patients as Predictors of Stigma in Italian Psychology Students.",https://www.ncbi.nlm.nih.gov/pubmed/30619803,Frontiers in public health,2019 01 10,"A sample of undergraduate Psychology students (n = 1005), prevalently females (82.4%), mean age 20.5 (sd 2.5), was examined regarding their attitudes toward people suffering from mental illness. The survey instrument included a brief form for demographic variables, the Attribution Questionnaire-9 (AQ-9), the Ten Items Personality Inventory (TIPI), and two questions exploring attitudes toward open-door and restraint-free policies in Psychiatry. Higher levels of stigmatizing attitudes were found in males (Pity, Blame, Help, and Avoidance) and in those (76.5%) who had never had any experience with psychiatric patients (Danger, Fear, Blame, Segregation, Help, Avoidance and Coercion). A similar trend was also found in those who don't share the policy of no seclusion/restraint, while subjects who are favorable to open-door policies reported higher Coercion scores. No correlations were found between dimensions of stigma and personality traits. A machine learning approach was then used to explore the role of demographic, academic and personality variables as predictors of stigmatizing attitudes. Agreeableness and Extraversion emerged as the most relevant predictors for blaming attitudes, while Emotional Stability and Openness appeared to be the most effective contributors to Anger. Our results confirmed that a training experience in Psychiatry might successfully reduce stigma in Psychology students.

Methods and results: The RE-AIM (reach, effectiveness, adoption, implementation, maintenance) framework was used to guide an iterative evaluation of three translational stages. Stage 1: Before program adoption, Extension health educators were surveyed and interviewed to assess physical activity programming perceptions and factors that may influence their decision to attend training or deliver the program in practice. Results indicated that a virtual, scalable training protocol would be necessary and that training needed to include hands-on instruction and be catered to those who were less confident in physical activity program delivery. Stage 2: Training attendees were surveyed pre- and post-training on factors related to the adoption-decision making process and contacted post-training to assess program delivery status. Training did not influence perceptions of the program, intent to deliver, or confidence in delivering the program. Stage 3: During program implementation, the program was evaluated through the RE-AIM framework by surveying across three key stakeholder groups: (1) program participants, (2) potential delivery personnel, and (3) Extension administrators. Findings indicate that the program has the potential to reach a large and representative proportion of the target audience, especially in rural areas. However, adoption and implementation rates among Extension health educators and community partners were low and data collection for effectiveness, implementation, and maintenance was a challenge. Conclusion: Overall, the results indicate initial struggles to translating and evaluating the program in a large, rural state. Implications for practice include making system-level changes to increase physical activity program adoption rates among Extension health educators and improve data collection and program evaluation through this community-based organization. More work is needed to identify infrastructure support and capacity to scale-out EBIs.","""It's Just Presence,"" the Contributions of Aboriginal and Torres Strait Islander Health Professionals in Cancer Care in Queensland.",https://www.ncbi.nlm.nih.gov/pubmed/30619801,Frontiers in public health,2019 01 10,"Objectives: The aim of this research was to explore health professionals' perspectives on the provision of follow-up cancer care for Aboriginal and Torres Strait Islander patients in Queensland. Methods: Semi-structured interviews were conducted with Indigenous and non-Indigenous health professionals who had experience providing care for Indigenous cancer patients in the primary health care and hospital setting. Results: Participants were recruited from six Aboriginal Community Controlled Health Services (n = 17) and from a tertiary hospital (n = 9) across urban, regional, and remote geographical settings. Culturally safe care, psychological support, determining patient needs, practical assistance, and advocating for Indigenous health were identified as enablers to support the needs of Indigenous patients when accessing cancer care, and Indigenous health professionals were identified as the key enabler. Conclusion: Indigenous health professionals significantly contribute to the provision of culturally competent follow-up cancer care by increasing the accessibility of follow-up cancer care services and by supporting the needs of Indigenous cancer patients. All health professionals need to work together and be sufficiently skilled in the delivery of culturally competent care to improve the Indigenous cancer journey and outcomes for Indigenous people. Effective organizational policies and practices are crucial to enable all health professionals to provide culturally competent and responsive cancer care to Indigenous Australians.","ExtraUterine Growth Restriction (EUGR) in Preterm Infants: Growth Patterns, Nutrition, and Epigenetic Markers. A Pilot Study.",https://www.ncbi.nlm.nih.gov/pubmed/30619799,Frontiers in pediatrics,2019 01 10,"Background/Aims: IntraUterine (IUGR) and ExtraUterine Growth Restriction (EUGR) may induce reprogramming mechanisms, finalized to survive before and after birth. Nutritional factors and other environmental signals could regulate gene expression through epigenetic modification, but the molecular mechanisms involved are not yet well understood. Epigenetic mechanisms could be considered as a bridge between environmental stimuli and long lasting phenotype, acquired during the intrauterine life and the first weeks of life. Our aim was to investigate the relationship between growth patterns, nutritional determinants, and epigenetic pathways. Methods: We enrolled 38 newborns admitted to Neonatal Intensive Care Unit (NICU) at University Hospital of Pisa. Gestational age at birth was <34 weeks and post-menstrual age (PMA) was 36-42 weeks at discharge. We excluded infants with malformations or clinical syndromes. EUGR was defined as the reduction in weight z score between birth and discharge >1 SD. We also evaluated DNA methylation of Imprinting Centre 1 (IC1) at birth and at discharge. Results: We observed a decrease in SD of weight and head circumference mainly during the first weeks of life. We found a correlation between EUGR for weight and for head circumference and an increased IC1 methylation (p = 0.018 and p = 0.0028, respectively). We observed a relationship between reduced protein and lipid intake and IC1 hypermethylation (p = 0.009 and p = 0.043, respectively). Conclusion: IC1 hypermethylation could be a reprogramming mechanism to promote a catch-up growth, by means of an increased Insulin-like growth factor 2 (IGF2) expression, that may have potential effects on metabolic homeostasis later in life.",Inhospital Exercise Training in Children With Cancer: Does It Work for All?,https://www.ncbi.nlm.nih.gov/pubmed/30619798,Frontiers in pediatrics,2019 01 10,"Purpose: Physical exercise training might counteract the weakening effects of both pediatric cancer and anti-cancer treatment. We aimed to analyze the prevalence of ""responders"" and ""non-responders"" to inhospital exercise training in children with cancer and to identify the factors that could influence responsiveness, which might help personalize exercise interventions for this patient population. Methods: We performed an ancillary analysis of the randomized controlled trial ""Physical activity in Pediatric Cancer"" (NCT01645436), in which 49 children with solid tumors were allocated to an inhospital exercise intervention or control group. The present study focused on the children in the former group (n = 24, 10 ± 4 years), who performed 3 weekly training sessions (aerobic + strength exercises). The intervention lasted 19 ± 8 weeks (i.e., from the start to the end of neoadjuvant chemotherapy treatment). A responder-vs-non-responder analysis was performed for physical capacity-related endpoints (five-repetition maximum strength, functional mobility tests, and cardiorespiratory fitness [CRF]). Only those participants showing improvements in a given test of a magnitude greater than both the random error and the threshold for clinically meaningful changes were considered responders. Results: Most participants improved their performance in the strength tests, with 80, 88, and 93% of total showing a positive response for seated bench press, lateral row, and leg press, respectively (p < 0.001). No significant improvements were observed for the functional mobility tests or CRF (p > 0.05, rate of responsiveness ≤ 50%). No differences between responders and non-responders were observed for sex, age, type of cancer, or treatment (i.e., including or not anthracyclines/radiotherapy). However, significant differences (p < 0.05) were observed between responders and non-responders for baseline performance in all the tests, and a significant (p < 0.05) inverse relationship was found between baseline performance and relative improvement for most endpoints. Conclusions: Although most children improved their muscle strength after the exercise intervention, a considerable individual variability was observed for the training responsiveness of functional mobility and CRF. A lower baseline performance was associated with a higher responsiveness for all the study endpoints, with the fittest children at the start of treatment showing the lowest responses. Efforts to individualize exercise prescription are needed to maximize responsiveness in pediatric cancer patients.",Respiratory Bacterial Culture Sampling in Expectorating and Non-expectorating Patients With Cystic Fibrosis.,https://www.ncbi.nlm.nih.gov/pubmed/30619797,Frontiers in pediatrics,2019 01 10,"Purpose: Different respiratory sampling methods exist to identify lower airway pathogens in patients with cystic fibrosis (CF), of which bronchoalveolar lavage (BAL), and expectorated sputum are considered the ""gold standard."" Because BAL cannot be repeated limitless, the diagnosis of lower respiratory tract infections in non-expectorating patients is challenging. Other sampling techniques are nasal swab, cough swab, and induced sputum. The purpose of this study (NCT02363764) was to compare concordance between the microbiological yield of nasal swab, cough swab, and expectorated sputum in expectorating patients; nasal swab, cough swab, and induced sputum in non-expectorating patients; nasal swab, cough swab, induced sputum, and BAL in patients requiring bronchoscopy (""BAL-group""); and to determine the clinical value of cough swab in non-expectorating patients with CF. Methods: Microbiological yield detected by these different sampling techniques was compared between and within 105 expectorating patients, 30 non-expectorating patients and BAL-group (n = 39) in a single CF clinic. Specificity, sensitivity, positive (PPV), and negative (NPV) predictive values were calculated. Results: Overall low sensitivity (6.3-58.0%) and wide-ranging predictive values (0.0-100.0%) indicated that nasal swab was not appropriate to detect lower airway pathogens [Pseudomonas aeruginosa (Pa), Staphylococcus aureus (Sa), and Haemophilus influenzae (Hi)] in all three patient groups. Microbiological yield, specificity, sensitivity, PPV, and NPV of cough swab and induced sputum were largely similar in non-expectorating patients and in BAL-group (except sensitivity (0.0%) of induced sputum for Hi in BAL-group). Calculations for Pa and Hi could not be performed for non-expectorating patients because of low prevalence (n = 2 and n = 3, respectively). In expectorating patients, concordance was found between cough swab and expectorated sputum, except for Hi (sensitivity of 40.0%). Conclusion: Our findings suggest that cough swab might be helpful in detecting the presence of some typical CF pathogens in the lower airways of clinically stable patients with CF. However, in symptomatic patients, who are unable to expectorate and who have a negative cough swab and induced sample, BAL should be performed as it currently remains the ""gold standard.""",Laryngotracheal Abnormalities in Esophageal Atresia Patients: A Hidden Entity.,https://www.ncbi.nlm.nih.gov/pubmed/30619795,Frontiers in pediatrics,2019 01 10,"Importance: Presence of laryngotracheal abnormalities is associated with increased morbidity and higher mortality rate in esophageal atresia patients. Objective: Determine the prevalence of laryngotracheal abnormalities (LTA) in a prospectively collected cohort of patients treated for esophageal atresia and/or tracheoesophageal fistula (EA/TEF). Analysis of the impact of those airway anomalies in early post-operative outcomes was performed. Patients and Methods: This was a review of a prospectively collected database, including patients from January 2008 to December 2017. Patients enrolled in the present study were treated in a high-volume referral center. Present study included all newborn-infants consecutively treated for EA/TEF. All patients were evaluated by flexible laryngotracheoscopy performed under local anesthesia in spontaneous breathing. In case of airway malformation suspected during flexible endoscopy, a rigid endoscopy was performed to complete airway assessment. If post-operative respiratory symptoms (noisy breathing, respiratory difficulty, failure to extubate, or difficulty feeding) were noted, a second laryngotracheoscopy was performed. Primary study outcome was to evaluate the prevalence of LTA in EA/TEF infants, characterizing of LTA, and their impact on early post-operative outcomes. Those primary study outcomes were planned before data collection began. Results: During the study period 207 patients with EA/TEF were treated. LTA had a period prevalence of 40.1% (83/207). Although no differences were recorded in terms of demographics and clinical presentation, LTA+ infants more frequently required tracheostomy (12/52, 23% vs. 0/124, 0%; p 0.0001) and were at increased risk of death (12/83, 14% vs. 5/124, 4%; p 0.009) in comparison with EA/TEF without LTA. Conclusions: Present data suggest a high prevalence of congenital LTA in patients affected by EA. Most of the abnormalities are congenital and a high proportion of patients with LTA require a tracheostomy. Mortality significantly correlates with the presence of LTA. Systematic airway endoscopic preoperative evaluation has to be pushed forward to minimize LTA-related morbidity and mortality.",A Review of Oxygen Use During Chest Compressions in Newborns-A Meta-Analysis of Animal Data.,https://www.ncbi.nlm.nih.gov/pubmed/30619794,Frontiers in pediatrics,2019 01 10,"Background: International consensus statements for resuscitation of newborn infants recommend provision of 100% oxygen once chest compressions are required. However, 100% oxygen exacerbates reperfusion injury and reduces cerebral perfusion in newborn babies. Objective: We aimed to establish whether resuscitation with air during chest compression is feasible and safe in newborn infants compared with 100% oxygen. Methods: Systematic search of PubMed, Google Scholar and CINAHL for articles examining variable oxygen concentrations during chest compressions in term newborns. Results: Overall, no human studies but eight animal studies (n = 323 animals) comparing various oxygen concentrations during chest compression were identified. The pooled analysis showed no difference in mortality rates for animals resuscitated with air vs. 100% oxygen (risk ratio 1.04 [0.35, 3.08], I2 = 0%, p = 0.94). ROSC was also similar between groups with a mean difference of -3.8 [-29.7-22] s, I2 = 0%, p = 0.77. No difference in oxygen damage or adverse events were identified between groups. Conclusions: Air had similar time to ROSC and mortality as 100% oxygen during neonatal chest compression. A large randomized controlled clinical trial comparing air vs. 100% oxygen during neonatal chest compression is warranted."

This modification is unusual because it occurs on the guanidinium groups of arginines, which are poor nucleophiles, and is distinct from the activity of the mammalian O-linked N-acetylglucosaminyltransferase. We conducted high-throughput screening assays to identify small molecules that inhibit NleB/SseK activity. Two compounds, 100066N and 102644N, both significantly inhibited NleB1, SseK1, and SseK2 activities. Addition of these compounds to cultured mammalian cells was sufficient to inhibit NleB1 glycosylation of the tumor necrosis factor receptor type 1-associated DEATH domain protein. These compounds were also capable of inhibiting Salmonella enterica strain ATCC 14028 replication in mouse macrophage-like cells. Neither inhibitor was significantly toxic to mammalian cells, nor showed in vitro cross-reactivity with the mammalian O-linked N-acetylglucosaminyltransferase. These compounds or derivatives generated from medicinal chemistry refinements may have utility as a potential alternative therapeutic strategy to antibiotics or as reagents to further the study of bacterial glycosyltransferases.",Genetic Transformation of a C. trachomatis Ocular Isolate With the Functional Tryptophan Synthase Operon Confers an Indole-Rescuable Phenotype.,https://www.ncbi.nlm.nih.gov/pubmed/30619780,Frontiers in cellular and infection microbiology,2019 05 27,"Chlamydia trachomatis is the leading cause of preventable blindness and the most common bacterial sexually transmitted infection. Different strains are associated with ocular or urogenital infections, and a proposed mechanism that may explain this tissue tropism is the active tryptophan biosynthesis pathway encoded by the genomic trpRBA operon in urogenital strains. Here we describe genetic complementation studies that are essential to confirm the role of tryptophan synthase in the context of an ocular C. trachomatis genomic background. Ocular strain A2497 was transformed with the (urogenital) pSW2::GFP shuttle vector showing that there is no strain tropism barrier to this plasmid vector; moreover, transformation had no detrimental effect on the growth kinetics of A2497, which is important given the low transformation efficiency of C. trachomatis. A derivative of the pSW2::GFP vector was used to deliver the active tryptophan biosynthesis genes from a urogenital strain of C. trachomatis (Soton D1) to A2497 with the aim of complementing the truncated trpA gene common to most ocular strains. After confirmation of intact TrpA protein expression in the transformed A2497, the resulting transformants were cultivated in tryptophan-depleted medium with and without indole or tryptophan, showing that complementation of the truncated trpA gene by the intact and functional urogenital trpRBA operon was sufficient to bestow an indole rescuable phenotype upon A2497. This study proves that pSW2::GFP derived vectors do not conform to the cross-strain transformation barrier reported for other chlamydia shuttle vectors, suggesting these as a universal vector for transformation of all C. trachomatis strains. This vector promiscuity enabled us to test the indole rescue hypothesis by transforming ocular strain A2497 with the functional urogenital trpRBA operon, which complemented the non-functional tryptophan synthase. These data confirm that the trpRBA operon is necessary and sufficient for chlamydia to survive in tryptophan-limited environments such as the female urogenital tract.",The Gastric Microbiome Is Perturbed in Advanced Gastric Adenocarcinoma Identified Through Shotgun Metagenomics.,https://www.ncbi.nlm.nih.gov/pubmed/30619779,Frontiers in cellular and infection microbiology,2019 05 27,"Objective: Dysbiosis of gastric microbiota such as Helicobacter pylori plays a significant role in pathogenesis and progression of gastric cancer. Our aim was to evaluate the composition and functional effects of gastric microbiota in superficial gastritis (SG) and advanced gastric adenocarcinoma (GC). Methods: We carried out shotgun metagenomic sequencing on gastric wash samples from 6 patients with GC and 5 patients with SG. The taxonomic composition was profiled using MetaPhlAn2 and functional gene pathway was profiled using HUMAnN2. Differences in microbial composition and pathways between the two patient groups were assessed via LEfSe. Results: The gastric microbiota in GC patients was characterized by reduced species richness, enrichment of 13 bacterial taxa and depletion of 31 taxa (q < 0.05). The most representative taxa which were abundant in GC corresponded to the commensals or opportunistic pathogens that usually colonize the oral cavity, including genera Neisseria, Alloprevotella, and Aggregatibacter, species Streptococcus_mitis_oralis_pneumoniae and strain Porphyromonas_endodontalis.t_GCF_000174815. Each of the three GC-associated genera could separate GC from SG completely. In particular, Sphingobium yanoikuyae, a bacterium capable of degrading carcinogenic compounds, was depleted in GC. Functionally, pathways associated with the biosynthesis of lipopolysaccharide (LPS) and L-arginine were enriched in GC, whereas pathways involved in the fermentation of short chain fatty acids (SCFAs) and branched amino acid metabolism were more abundant in SG. Conclusions: Our results present new alterations in the gastric microbiome in patients with GC from a whole-genome perspective, suggesting that microbiome composition and function can be used for prognosis and diagnosis of GC.",Comparative Metabolomic Sampling of Upper and Lower Airways by Four Different Methods to Identify Biochemicals That May Support Bacterial Growth.,https://www.ncbi.nlm.nih.gov/pubmed/30619778,Frontiers in cellular and infection microbiology,2019 05 27,"Bacteria need nutrients from the host environment to survive, yet we know little about which biochemicals are present in the airways (the metabolome), which of these biochemicals are essential for bacterial growth and how they change with airway disease. The aims of this pilot study were to develop and compare methodologies for sampling the upper and lower airway metabolomes and to identify biochemicals present in the airways that could potentially support bacterial growth. Eight healthy human volunteers were sampled by four methods: two standard approaches - nasal lavage and induced sputum, and two using a novel platform, synthetic adsorptive matrix (SAM) strips-nasosorption and bronchosorption. Collected samples were analyzed by Ultrahigh Performance Liquid Chromatography-Tandem Mass Spectroscopy (UPLC-MS/MS). Five hundred and eighty-one biochemicals were recovered from the airways belonging to a range of metabolomic super-pathways. We observed significant differences between the sampling approaches. Significantly more biochemicals were recovered when SAM strips were used, compared to standard sampling techniques. A range of biochemicals that could support bacterial growth were detected in the different samples. This work demonstrates for the first time that SAM strips are a highly effective method for sampling the airway metabolome. This work will assist further studies to understand how changes in the airway metabolome affect bacterial infection in patients with underlying airway disease.",Serum Levels of Soluble CD40 Ligand and Neopterin in HIV Coinfected Asymptomatic and Symptomatic Visceral Leishmaniasis Patients.,https://www.ncbi.nlm.nih.gov/pubmed/30619775,Frontiers in cellular and infection microbiology,2019 05 27,"Human Immunodeficiency Virus (HIV) co-infection drastically increases the risk of developing overt visceral leishmaniasis (VL). The asymptomatic Leishmania infection window constitutes an opportunity to identify those HIV patients at highest risk by defining early markers associated with disease susceptibility or resistance. As intracellular parasite killing is essential, we investigated whether serum markers of macrophage activation were notably affected in HIV patients with an asymptomatic Leishmania infection or overt visceral leishmaniasis disease. Serum levels of soluble CD40 ligand and neopterin were assessed in 24 active VL-HIV patients, 35 HIV patients with asymptomatic Leishmania infection and 35 HIV endemic controls. All patients were recruited in L. donovani endemic regions of North-West Ethiopia. The serum levels of sCD40L and neopterin significantly decreased and increased in HIV patients with active VL compared to HIV patients with asymptomatic Leishmania infection, respectively. No statistically significant differences could be detected in neopterin and sCD40L levels between Leishmania asymptomatically infected HIV patients and endemic HIV control patients. However, an inverse trend, between Leishmania antibody positivity or VL development and neopterin levels could be seen. The CD4+ T-cell count was inversely correlated with serum neopterin levels, but not with sCD40L levels. Our results in HIV coinfected patients, correspond with the postulated protective role of sCD40L in VL and underline the importance of the CD40-CD40L pathway in resistance against the parasite. Neopterin levels suggest an increased macrophage activation upon infection and could have a value in clinical algorithms to, although non-specifically, improve prediction of VL development in HIV patients with asymptomatic Leishmania infection.",The Predictive Potentiality of Salivary Microbiome for the Recurrence of Early Childhood Caries.,https://www.ncbi.nlm.nih.gov/pubmed/30619773,Frontiers in cellular and infection microbiology,2019 05 27,"The aim of this study was to investigate the variation of the salivary microbiota in the recurrence of early childhood caries (ECC), and to explore and verify the potential microbial indicators of ECC recurrence. Saliva samples from kindergarten children were tracked every 6 months for 1 year. Finally, in total 28 children and 84 samples were placed on the analysis phase: 7 children with ECC recurrence made up the ECC-recurrence (ER) group, 6 children without ECC recurrence constituted the non-ECC-recurrence (NER) group, and 15 children who kept ECC-free were set as the ECC-free (EF) group. DNA amplicons of the V3-V4 hypervariable region of the bacterial 16S rDNA were generated and sequencing was performed using Illumina MiSeq PE250 platform. No statistically significant differences of the Shannon indices were found in both cross-sectional and longitudinal comparisons. Furthermore, both principal coordinates analysis (PCoA) and heatmap plots demonstrated that the salivary microbial community structure might have potentiality to predict ECC recurrence at an early phase. The relative abundance of Fusobacterium, Prevotella, Leptotrichia, and Capnocytophaga differed significantly between the ER and NER groups at baseline. The values of area under the curve (AUC) of the four genera and their combined synthesis in the prediction for ECC recurrence were 0.857, 0.833, 0.786, 0.833, and 0.952, respectively. The relative abundance of Fusobacterium, Prevotella, Leptotrichia, and Capnocytophaga and their combination showed satisfactory accuracy in the prediction for ECC recurrence, indicating that salivary microbiome had predictive potentiality for recurrence of this disease. These findings might facilitate more effective strategy to be taken in the management of the recurrence of ECC.",Efficacy and Affecting Factors of 131I Thyroid Remnant Ablation After Surgical Treatment of Differentiated Thyroid Carcinoma.,https://www.ncbi.nlm.nih.gov/pubmed/30619772,Frontiers in oncology,2019 01 10,"Purpose: Radioiodine (131I) thyroid remnant ablation is an important treatment of differentiated thyroid carcinoma (DTC) and various factors affecting its efficacy have been reported but not well defined. The aim of our study was to evaluate the efficacy and the affecting factors of 131I ablation after total or near-total thyroidectomy in a relative large DTC cohort. Methods: 261 DTC patients with negative thyroglobulin antibody received 100-200 mCi 131I for thyroid remnant ablation after total or near-total thyroidectomy between January 2012 and October 2015 in our hospital. The efficacy and affecting factors of 131I ablation therapy were retrospectively investigated. Results: The success rate of the first 131I thyroid remnant ablation was 65.90%. Univariate analysis demonstrated that larger tumor size, higher level of pre-ablation stimulated thyroglobulin (sTg), intermediate to high risk stratification for recurrence, and lymph node and distant metastases were associated with a lower success rate of the first 131I ablation (all p < 0.05). Multivariate logistic regression analysis showed that tumor size, pre-ablation sTg, and lymph node and distant metastases were independent factors affecting the efficacy of the first 131I ablation. Areas under receiver operating characteristic curves for sTg, sTg/TSH ratio, and tumor size to predict unsuccessful ablation were 0.831, 0.824, and 0.648, respectively. The threshold values were 4.595 ng/ml, 0.046 mg/IU, and 1.350 cm, respectively. The sensitivities were 95.51, 96.63, and 73.03% and the specificities were 64.54, 61.63, and 49.41%, respectively. The excellent response (ER) ratio of the successful group was significantly higher than that of the unsuccessful group. Conclusions: The efficacy of the first 131I thyroid remnant ablation after surgical treatment of DTC is well demonstrated, and tumor size, pre-ablation sTg, lymph node, and distant metastases are independent factors affecting its efficacy.",Time Trends of Gastrointestinal Cancers Incidence and Mortality in Yangzhong From 1991 to 2015: An Updated Age-Period-Cohort Analysis.,https://www.ncbi.nlm.nih.gov/pubmed/30619771,Frontiers in oncology,2019 01 10,"Background: Gastrointestinal (GI) cancers are the common cause of morbidity and mortality in China which seriously threaten people's health and lives. The aim of this study was to describe the temporal trend in the epidemiology of GI cancers from 1991 to 2015, with an emphasis on the effects of age, period and cohort in Yangzhong City, Jiangsu province, a high-risk area of GI cancers in China. Methods: Our study extracted cases of gastric cancer, esophageal cancer and colorectal cancer diagnosed from 1991 to 2015 from Yangzhong Cancer Registry. Age-standardized rates (ASRs) were calculated and joinpoint regression was used to compute the estimated annual percent changes. Age-period-cohort (APC) model was performed to investigate the independent effects of age, calendar period, and birth cohort. Results: Between 1991 and 2015, 18,006 new cases and 10,262 deaths were registered with GI cancers in Yangzhong. The age-standardized incidence rates (ASIRs) of gastric cancer decreased in both sexes during the study period. And the incidence rates of esophageal cancer stabilized at first then continued to decline, the turning point was in 2005 for men and 2001 for women. Changes in the mortality rates of gastric cancer and esophageal cancer showed significant declined trends around 2000-2010 in both genders. The incidence rates of colorectal cancer increased steadily during the entire study period, and the increase was more pronounced in the mortality rates of men. The results of APC analysis suggest that general decreases in incidence and mortality of esophageal cancer and gastric cancer might be caused by the downward trend of the period and cohort effects, while the increases in colorectal cancer might be caused by the uptrend of the period effects. Conclusions: The incidence and mortality rates of esophageal and gastric cancers showed a downward trend and colorectal cancer was on the rise as a whole in Yangzhong City. The different burden of gastrointestinal cancer indicating heterogeneous risk factors exist and may have contributed to these temporal variations.",Prognostic Impact of Genetic Polymorphism in Mineralocorticoid Receptor and Comorbidity With Hypertension in Androgen-Deprivation Therapy.,https://www.ncbi.nlm.nih.gov/pubmed/30619769,Frontiers in oncology,2019 01 10,"Mineralocorticoid receptor (MR) signaling which is closely associated with hypertension plays important roles in resistance to antiandrogen therapy in prostate cancer. However, its impact on the prognosis in androgen-deprivation therapy (ADT) has not been elucidated. Then, we investigated the impact of genetic variation in MR and comorbidity with hypertension on the prognosis in ADT. This study included 182 Japanese patients with prostate cancer treated with ADT, whose comorbidity status with hypertension were available. The associations of MR polymorphism (rs5522) and comorbidity with hypertension with clinicopathological parameters as well as progression-free survival and overall survival were examined. Clinicopathological characteristics were comparable between genetic variation in MR. However, homozygous variant in MR was associated with shorter time to castration resistance (P = 0.014) and any-cause death (P = 0.024). In patients' background, presence of comorbidity with hypertension showed the trend with lower PSA level at diagnosis and lower biopsy Gleason score, as well as significant association with less incidence of N1. Comorbidity with hypertension was associated with longer time to castration resistance (P = 0.043) and any-cause death (P = 0.046), which was diminished on multivariate analysis including age, PSA level at diagnosis, biopsy Gleason score, clinical stage, and the modality of hormonal therapy. Genetic variation in MR (rs5522) and comorbidity with hypertension were significantly and potentially associated with prognosis when treated with ADT, respectively. This suggests that the individual intensity of MR signaling may be associated with resistance to ADT and a promising biomarker in ADT.",An Integrated Score and Nomogram Combining Clinical and Immunohistochemistry Factors to Predict High ISUP Grade Clear Cell Renal Cell Carcinoma.,https://www.ncbi.nlm.nih.gov/pubmed/30619768,Frontiers in oncology,2019 01 10,"Objective: The International Society of Urological Pathology (ISUP) has proposed a grading system to classify renal cell carcinoma (RCC). However, classification using biopsy specimens remains problematic and, consequently, the accuracy of a biopsy-based diagnosis is relatively poor. This study aims to combine clinical and immunohistochemical (IHC) factors for the prediction of high ISUP grade clear cell RCC (ccRCC) in an attempt to complement and improve the accuracy of a biopsy-based diagnosis. Methods: A total of 362 ccRCC patients were enrolled in this study and used for the training set. We performed IHC analysis of 18 protein markers on standard tissue sections using an automated stainer. Multivariate logistic regression models were developed to evaluate independent predictors for high ISUP grade. We evaluated different prediction models using receiver operating characteristic (ROC) curves and area under the ROC curve (AUC) analysis. A nomogram for the derivation of an integrated score for predicting high ISUP grade ccRCC and a calibration curve were also plotted. Finally, an internal validation cohort was examined to evaluate the performance of our integrated scoring system and nomogram. Results: Multivariate logistic analyses revealed seven credible candidates for predicting high grade ISUP. These were age, tumor diameter, surgery, and CK7, Ki-67, PTEN, and MTOR protein expression. The ROC curves for the clinical, IHC and integrated models were compared in the training set, and the AUC for each was 0.731, 0.744, and 0.801, respectively. DeLong's test showed that the integrated model was significantly better at predicting high ISUP grade, when compared with the other models. Internal validation confirmed the good performance of the integrated score in predicting ISUP grade. Conclusion: We have developed a nomogram integrating clinical and immunohistochemical parameters to predict high ISUP grade for M0 ccRCC patients. This nomogram may offer potentially useful information during preoperative individualized patient risk assessment, and consequently may help urologists when planning personalized management regimens."

However, the low oral bioavailability and efficacy profile hinders its clinical application. To improve the bioavailability, many analogs of curcumin have been developed, among which EF24 is an excellent representative. EF24 has enhanced bioavailability over curcumin and shows more potent bioactivity, including anti-cancer, anti-inflammatory, and anti-bacterial. EF24 inhibits tumor growth by inducing cell cycle arrest and apoptosis, mainly through its inhibitory effect on the nuclear factor kappa B (NF-κB) pathway and by regulating key genes through microRNA (miRNA) or the proteosomal pathway. Based on the current structure, more potent EF24 analogs have been designed and synthesized. However, some roles of EF24 remain unclear, such as whether it induces or inhibits reactive oxygen species (ROS) production and whether it stimulates or inhibits the mitogen activated kinase-like protein (MAPK) pathway. This review summarizes the known biological and pharmacological activities and mechanisms of action of EF24.",Single Nucleotide Polymorphisms in PLCE1 for Cancer Risk of Different Types: A Meta-Analysis.,https://www.ncbi.nlm.nih.gov/pubmed/30619753,Frontiers in oncology,2019 01 10,"Background: Recent studies have investigated the relationships between PLCE1 polymorphisms and cancer susceptibility. However, some findings lack consistency. Objectives: In the current study, we conducted a meta-analysis to more accurately evaluate the relationships between PLCE1 (rs2274223, rs3765524, rs753724, rs11187842, and rs7922612) single nucleotide polymorphisms (SNPs) and risk for different types of cancer. Methods: We performed a comprehensive search strategy in PubMed, Web of Science, Medline, EMbase, and Scopus for articles available until 19 March 2018. A total of 54 case-control studies comprising 17,955 cases and 20,400 controls were included in the current meta-analysis, which together comprised a total of 32 publications. The pooled odds ratios (ORs) with 95% confidence intervals (CIs) were used to evaluate relationships between the PLCE1 polymorphisms and cancer susceptibility. All statistical analyses were performed using Stata 11 software. Results: Results of the meta-analysis demonstrated that the rs2274223 polymorphism showed a significant correlation with increased overall cancer susceptibility (AG vs. AA: OR 1.168, 95% CI 1.084-1.259; GG vs. AA: OR 1.351, 95% CI 1.163-1.570; AG+GG vs. AA: OR 1.193, 95% CI 1.103-1.290; GG vs. AA+AG: OR 1.262, 95% CI 1.102-1.446; G vs. A: OR 1.163, 95% CI 1.089-1.242). Results of subgroup analysis showed that the rs2274223 polymorphism was associated with higher risk for esophageal cancer and gastric cancer relative to colorectal cancer and head and neck cancer. In addition, the rs2274223 polymorphism was found to be associated with increased cancer risk, especially among the subgroups comprising Asians, studies with population-based controls, studies employing the TaqMan genotyping method, and studies consistent with Hardy-Weinberg equilibrium (HWE). The association between the rs3765524 polymorphism and reduced overall cancer risk was detected in one specific genetic model (CT vs. CC: OR 0.681, 95% CI 0.523-0.886). Results of subgroup analysis showed that the rs3765524 polymorphism was associated with cancer risk in a specific genetic model among the subgroups of colorectal cancer, esophageal cancer, Asians, studies with population-based controls, and studies consistent with HWE. However, relationships among the PLCE1 rs753724, rs11187842, and rs7922612 polymorphisms and tumor risk were not identified. Conclusions: Results of the current meta-analysis suggested that PLCE1 (rs2274223, rs3765524) polymorphisms are associated with cancer susceptibility.","Radiation, Immune Checkpoint Blockade and the Abscopal Effect: A Critical Review on Timing, Dose and Fractionation.",https://www.ncbi.nlm.nih.gov/pubmed/30619752,Frontiers in oncology,2019 01 10,"The combination of radiation and immunotherapy is currently an exciting avenue of pre-clinical and clinical investigation. The synergy between these two treatment modalities has the potential to expand the role of radiation from a purely local therapy, to a role in advanced and metastatic disease. Tumor regression outside of the irradiated field, known as the abscopal effect, is a recognized phenomenon mediated by lymphocytes and enhanced by checkpoint blockade. In this review, we summarize the known mechanistic data behind the immunostimulatory effects of radiation and how this is enhanced by immunotherapy. We also provide pre-clinical data supporting specific radiation timing and optimal dose/fractionation for induction of a robust anti-tumor immune response with or without checkpoint blockade. Importantly, these data are placed in a larger context of understanding T-cell exhaustion and the impact of immunotherapy on this phenotype. We also include relevant pre-clinical studies done in non-tumor systems. We discuss the published clinical trials and briefly summarize salient case reports evaluating the abscopal effect. Much of the data discussed here remains at the preliminary stage, and a number of interesting avenues of research remain under investigation.",PCK1 Downregulation Promotes TXNRD1 Expression and Hepatoma Cell Growth via the Nrf2/Keap1 Pathway.,https://www.ncbi.nlm.nih.gov/pubmed/30619751,Frontiers in oncology,2019 01 10,"Gluconeogenesis, generates glucose from small carbohydrate substrates, and drives the metabolic flux in parallel but opposite to glycolysis. The cytoplasmic isoform of phosphoenolpyruvate carboxykinase (PCK1 or PEPCK-C), a rate-limiting enzyme in gluconeogenesis, initiates the gluconeogenesis process and is reportedly dysregulated in multiple types of cancer. Gluconeogenesis mainly occurs in the liver during fasting, and previous studies have demonstrated that PCK1 acts as a tumor suppressor in hepatocellular carcinoma (HCC); however, the role of PCK1 in cancer progression remains incompletely understood. In the current study, we found that PCK1 expression was decreased in HCC as compared to adjacent normal liver tissues, and low PCK1 expression correlated with poor patient prognosis. Furthermore, overexpression of PCK1 suppressed reactive oxygen species (ROS) production and nuclear translocation of Nrf2 in hepatoma cells. In addition, thioredoxin reductase 1 (TXNRD1), an antioxidant enzyme regulated by the Nrf2/Keap1 pathway, was downregulated upon overexpression of PCK1 in HCC cell lines. Furthermore, we verified this axis using nude mouse xenograft model. Finally, we found that auranofin, a TXNRD1 inhibitor, enhanced the sensitivity of PCK1-knockout hepatoma cells to sorafenib-induced apoptosis. Taken together, our findings suggest that PCK1 deficiency promotes hepatoma cell proliferation via the induction of oxidative stress and the activation of transcription factor Nrf2, and that targeting the TXNRD1 antioxidant pathway sensitizes PCK1-knockout hepatoma cells to sorafenib treatment in vitro.",The Potential Clinical Utility of Circulating Tumor DNA in Esophageal Adenocarcinoma: From Early Detection to Therapy.,https://www.ncbi.nlm.nih.gov/pubmed/30619750,Frontiers in oncology,2019 01 10,"Esophageal adenocarcinoma (EAC) is a lethal cancer requiring improved screening strategies and treatment options due to poor detection methods, aggressive progression, and therapeutic resistance. Emerging circulating tumor DNA (ctDNA) technologies may offer a unique non-invasive strategy to better characterize the highly heterogeneous cancer and more clearly establish the genetic modulations leading to disease progression. The presented review describes the potential advantages of ctDNA methodologies as compared to current clinical strategies to improve clinical detection, enhance disease surveillance, evaluate prognosis, and personalize treatment. Specifically, we describe the ctDNA-targetable genetic markers of prognostic significance to stratify patients into risk of progression from benign to malignant disease and potentially offer cost-effective screening of established cancer. We also describe the application of ctDNA to more effectively characterize the heterogeneity and particular mutagenic resistance mechanisms in real-time to improve prognosis and therapeutic monitoring strategies. Lastly, we discuss the inconsistent clinical responses to currently approved therapies for EAC and the role of ctDNA to explore the dynamic regulation of novel targeted and immunotherapies to personalize therapy and improve patient outcomes. Although there are clear limitations of ctDNA technologies for immediate clinical deployment, this review presents the prospective role of such applications to potentially overcome many of the notable hurdles to treating EAC patients. A deeper understanding of complex EAC tumor biology may result in the progress toward improved clinical outcomes.",Emerging Opportunities of Radiotherapy Combined With Immunotherapy in the Era of Breast Cancer Heterogeneity.,https://www.ncbi.nlm.nih.gov/pubmed/30619749,Frontiers in oncology,2019 01 10,"The association of radiotherapy and immunotherapy has recently emerged as an exciting combination that might improve outcomes in many solid tumor settings. In the context of breast cancer, this opportunity is promising and under investigation. Given the heterogeneity of breast cancer, it might be meaningful to study the association of radiotherapy and immunotherapy distinctly among the various breast cancer subtypes. The use of biomarkers, such as tumor infiltrating lymphocytes, which are also associated to breast cancer heterogeneity, might provide an opportunity for tailored studies. This review highlights current knowledge of the association of radiotherapy and immunotherapy in the setting of breast cancer and attempts to highlight the therapeutic opportunities among breast cancer heterogeneity.",Insights Into SND1 Oncogene Promoter Regulation.,https://www.ncbi.nlm.nih.gov/pubmed/30619748,Frontiers in oncology,2019 01 10,"The staphylococcal nuclease and Tudor domain containing 1 gene (SND1), also known as Tudor-SN, TSN or p100, encodes an evolutionarily conserved protein with invariant domain composition. SND1 contains four repeated staphylococcal nuclease domains and a single Tudor domain, which confer it endonuclease activity and extraordinary capacity for interacting with nucleic acids, individual proteins and protein complexes. Originally described as a transcriptional coactivator, SND1 plays fundamental roles in the regulation of gene expression, including RNA splicing, interference, stability, and editing, as well as in the regulation of protein and lipid homeostasis. Recently, SND1 has gained attention as a potential disease biomarker due to its positive correlation with cancer progression and metastatic spread. Such functional diversity of SND1 marks this gene as interesting for further analysis in relation with the multiple levels of regulation of SND1 protein production. In this review, we summarize the SND1 genomic region and promoter architecture, the set of transcription factors that can bind the proximal promoter, and the evidence supporting transactivation of SND1 promoter by a number of signal transduction pathways operating in different cell types and conditions. Unraveling the mechanisms responsible for SND1 promoter regulation is of utmost interest to decipher the SND1 contribution in the realm of both normal and abnormal physiology.",Topical Timolol Vs. Oral Propranolol for the Treatment of Superficial Infantile Hemangiomas.,https://www.ncbi.nlm.nih.gov/pubmed/30619747,Frontiers in oncology,2019 01 10,"Objective: Infantile hemangiomas (IHs) are the most common vascular tumors of infancy. Oral propranolol has achieved great success in treating IHs since 2008. To minimize the systemic side events caused by oral administration of propranolol, topical timolol started to be applied in the treatment of IHs, especially for superficial lesions. Methods: We treated 724 children with superficial IHs using oral propranolol or topical timolol, and investigated the efficacy and safety of the two treatment patterns. Results: Both oral propranolol and topical timolol achieved a satisfactory therapeutic outcome, with an effective response rate of 97 and 96.4%, respectively. No significant differences in visual analog scale (VAS) improvement between the two groups were observed. Occurrence rate of systemic adverse events for patients treated with oral propranolol (3.9%) was significantly higher than that for patients treated with topical timolol (0%). Clinical response was not associated with gender, duration of treatment, lesion location, lesion size, gestational age, and progesterone use during pregnancy, but closely associated with age at treatment initiation, which indicated that younger age at treatment initiation predicted for a better regression rate. Conclusions: We recommend that topical timolol instead of oral propranolol could be the first-line therapy for superficial IHs because of its good efficacy and improved safety.","PD-1/PD-L1 Axis, Rather Than High-Mobility Group Alarmins or CD8+ Tumor-Infiltrating Lymphocytes, Is Associated With Survival in Head and Neck Squamous Cell Carcinoma Patients Who Received Surgical Resection.",https://www.ncbi.nlm.nih.gov/pubmed/30619746,Frontiers in oncology,2019 01 10,"In current studies, the influence of tumor immune microenvironment on tumorigenesis and tumor progression has been widely explored. In the present study, we investigated the expression and significance of high mobility group box 1 (HMGB1), HMG nucleosome-binding protein 1 (HMGN1), the receptor programmed cell death 1 (PD-1) and its ligand programmed cell death ligand 1 (PD-L1) in head and neck squamous cell carcinoma (HNSCC). We explored whether HMGB1 and HMGN1 take part in recruiting T cells to HNSCC microenvironment. Furthermore, we assessed the prognostic value of HMG proteins, TILs, and PD-1/PD-L1 in postoperative patients. Tumor tissue sections were collected from 81 cases of patients with resectable HNSCC. All patients' information was integrated with clinical and pathological records, as well as follow-up data. We used immunohistochemistry to examine the subcellular localization and expression levels of HMGB1 and HMGN1, as well as tumor CD3+, CD8+, FOXP3+ lymphocyte infiltration, and the expression of immune inhibiting molecules PD-1/PD-L1. Results showed that there was no significant difference in the number of CD8+ and FOXP3+ T cells between the two groups with or without HMGB1 cytoplasmic expression in tumor tissues. The number of CD3+ T cells in HMGB1 cytoplasmic expression group (339.39 ± 230.76) was more than that in group without HMGB1 cytoplasmic expression (233.30 ± 230.91, P < 0.05). The number of CD3+, CD8+, and FOXP3+ T cells in HMGN1 cytoplasmic expression group [400.74 ± 224.04, 158.10 ± 112.10, 36.00(15.00, 69.00)] was more than that in group without HMGN1-cytoplasmic expression [222.84 ± 217.78, P < 0.01; 105.10 ± 108.25, P < 0.05; 13.00(6.75, 32.25), P < 0.01]. The positive rates of PD-1 and PD-L1 in tumor tissues were 29.6 and 67.9%, respectively. Multivariate analysis suggested that tumor expression of PD-L1 was an independent prognostic factor and PD-L1 overexpression indicated a poor overall survival (OS) and disease-free survival (DFS). Taken together, we concluded that HMGB1 and HMGN1 secreted by cancer cells may relate to recruitment of tumor infiltrating lymphocytes (TILs) in HNSCC. PD-1/PD-L1 axis, rather than HMG proteins or CD8+ tumor-infiltrating lymphocytes, has a critical role in tumor immune microenvironment and could predict the outcome of HNSCC patients who received surgical resection.",Upfront Cranial Radiotherapy vs. EGFR Tyrosine Kinase Inhibitors Alone for the Treatment of Brain Metastases From Non-small-cell Lung Cancer: A Meta-Analysis of 1465 Patients.,https://www.ncbi.nlm.nih.gov/pubmed/30619745,Frontiers in oncology,2019 01 10,"Background: Epidermal growth factor receptor tyrosine kinase inhibitors (EGFR-TKIs) is revolutionizing the management of brain metastases (BMs). This study was to explore the value of upfront cranial radiotherapy (RT) in EGFR-mutated non-small cell lung cancer (NSCLC) with BMs compared with EGFR-TKIs alone. Methods: We searched all topic-related comparative articles in public databases (MEDLINE, EMBASE, Cochrane Library, and Web of Science) and conference proceedings. Outcomes of interest were intracranial objective response rate (ORR), overall survival (OS), and intracranial progression-free survival (PFS). Statistical analyses were calculated using Review Manager 5.3 software. Results: Thirteen comparative studies that included a total of 1,456 patients were eligible. Upfront brain RT had significantly higher OS (HR = 0.78, 95% CI = 0.65-0.93, P = 0.005) than EGFR-TKI alone. Upfront RT plus TKI had superior OS (HR = 0.71, 95% CI = 0.58-0.86, P = 0.0005) and intracranial PFS (HR = 0.69, 95% CI = 0.49-0.99, P = 0.04). The pooled data favored upfront whole brain RT (WBRT) plus TKI in terms of intracranial PFS (HR = 0.64, 95% CI = 0.48-0.85, P = 0.002) and OS (HR = 0.75, 95% CI = 0.57-1, P = 0.05). Upfront stereotactic radiosurgery (SRS) was associated with better OS (HR = 0.37, 95% CI = 0.26-0.54, P < 0.00001). Similar results were observed when analysis was restricted to the use of erlotinib or geftinib. Conclusions: The upfront use of brain RT seemed critical, especially for SRS. Upfront administration of upfront WBRT plus EGFR-TKI had better survival outcomes and seemed superior to EGFR-TKI alone."

MM cells furthermore reshape the BM to their own needs by affecting the different BM stromal cell types resulting in angiogenesis, bone destruction, and immune suppression. Despite recent advances in treatment modalities, MM remains most often incurable due to the development of drug resistance to all standard of care agents. This underscores the unmet need for these heavily treated relapsed/refractory patients. Disruptions in epigenetic regulation are a well-known hallmark of cancer cells, contributing to both cancer onset and progression. In MM, sequencing and gene expression profiling studies have also identified numerous epigenetic defects, including locus-specific DNA hypermethylation of cancer-related and B cell specific genes, genome-wide DNA hypomethylation and genetic defects, copy number variations and/or abnormal expression patterns of various chromatin modifying enzymes. Importantly, these so-called epimutations contribute to genomic instability, disease progression, and a worse outcome. Moreover, the frequency of mutations observed in genes encoding for histone methyltransferases and DNA methylation modifiers increases following treatment, indicating a role in the emergence of drug resistance. In support of this, accumulating evidence also suggest a role for the epigenetic machinery in MM cell plasticity, driving the differentiation of the malignant cells to a less mature and drug resistant state. This review discusses the current state of knowledge on the role of epigenetics in MM, with a focus on deregulated histone methylation modifiers and the impact on MM cell plasticity and drug resistance.

However, it is frequently diagnosed at the advanced stage. It is necessary by means of biology to identify specific lung tumor biomarkers with high sensitivity. Glycosylation is one of the most important post-translational modifications and is related to many different diseases. It is involved in numerous essential biological processes, such as cell proliferation, differentiation, migration, cell-cell integrity and recognition, and immune modulation. However, little was known about deregulation of glycosylation in lung cancer and contribution to tumor-microenvironment interactions. Among the numerous glycosylations, fucosylation is the most common modification of glycoproteins and glycosylated oligosaccharides. Increased levels of fucosylation have been detected in various pathological conditions, as well as in lung cancer. In this article, we reviewed the role of fucosylation in lung cancer. We highlighted some of the fucosylation alterations currently being pursued in sera or tissues of lung cancer patients. Moreover, we elaborated on the regulation mechanism of fucosylation in proliferative invasion and metastasis of lung tumor cells.

In the last decade, efforts have been made to develop a mathematical framework in order to image the effective sources of hemoglobin variations in brain tissues. Different approaches can be used to impose additional information or constraints when reconstructing the cerebral images of an ill-posed problem. The goal of this study is to compare the performance and limitations of several source localization techniques in the context of fNIRS tomography using individual anatomical magnetic resonance imaging (MRI) to model light propagation. The forward problem is solved using a Monte Carlo simulation of light propagation in the tissues. The inverse problem has been linearized using the Rytov approximation. Then, Tikhonov regularization applied to least squares, truncated singular value decomposition, back-projection, L1-norm regularization, minimum norm estimates, low resolution electromagnetic tomography and Bayesian model averaging techniques are compared using a receiver operating characteristic analysis, blurring and localization error measures. Using realistic simulations (n = 450) and data acquired from a human participant, this study depicts how these source localization techniques behave in a human head fNIRS tomography. When compared to other methods, Bayesian model averaging is proposed as a promising method in DOT and shows great potential to improve specificity, accuracy, as well as to reduce blurring and localization error even in presence of noise and deep sources. Classical reconstruction methods, such as regularized least squares, offer better sensitivity but higher blurring; while more novel L1-based method provides sparse solutions with small blurring and high specificity but lower sensitivity. The application of these methods is also demonstrated experimentally using visual fNIRS experiment with adult participant.",Predictors and Sequelae of Postoperative Delirium in Geriatric Hip Fracture Patients.,https://www.ncbi.nlm.nih.gov/pubmed/30619641,Geriatric orthopaedic surgery & rehabilitation,2019 01 10,Perioperative delirium in elderly hip fracture patients has been correlated with significant morbidity.

The hallmark of inflammatory responses is the activation of inflammasomes - multiprotein oligomers comprising intracellular pattern recognition receptors and inflammatory effectors - such as ASC and pro-cysteine-aspartic protease (pro-caspase)-1. Inflammasomes can be classified as canonical or non-canonical, and their activation in response to various ligands commonly induces caspase-1 activation and gasdermin D (GSDMD) processing, leading to caspase-1-mediated maturation and secretion of the pro-inflammatory cytokines IL-1β and IL-18, and GSDMD-mediated pyroptosis through pore generation in cell membranes. Although inflammation protects the host from harmful stimuli, chronic inflammation is a critical risk factor for inflammatory diseases, and several studies have investigated the role of canonical inflammasomes in inflammatory responses and diseases, with emerging studies focusing on the role of non-canonical inflammasomes. This review discusses recent studies on the regulatory roles of the caspase-11 non-canonical inflammasome in the pathogenesis of inflammatory diseases. Additionally, it provides an insight into the development of novel therapeutics based on targeting caspase-11 non-canonical inflammasome and its downstream effectors to prevent and treat human inflammatory conditions.",Cognitive Load Theory for debriefing simulations: implications for faculty development.,https://www.ncbi.nlm.nih.gov/pubmed/30619626,"Advances in simulation (London, England)",2019 01 10,"The debriefing is an essential component of simulation-based training for healthcare professionals, but learning this complex skill can be challenging for simulation faculty.

In this paper, we conceptualize the debriefer as a learner of debriefing skills and we discuss Cognitive Load Theory to categorize the many potential mental loads that can affect the faculty debriefer as learner.

To clarify the relationships among different populations, the type locality of the species (Clare Island, Ireland) and several Italian localities were sampled. Populations were investigated with an integrated approach, using morphological (LM, CLSM, SEM), morphometric, karyological, and molecular (18S rRNA, cox1 genes) data. Paramacrobiotus richtersi was redescribed and a neotype designed from the Irish bisexual population. Animals of all populations had very similar qualitative and quantitative characters, apart from the absence of males and the presence of triploidy in some of them, whereas some differences were recorded in the egg shell. All populations examined had the same 18S haplotype, while 21 haplotypes were found in the cox1 gene. In four cases, those qualitative characters were correlated with clear molecular (cox1) differences (genetic distance 14.6-21.8%). The integrative approach, which considered the morphological differences in the eggs, the reproductive biology and the wide genetic distances among putative species, led to the description of four new species (Paramacrobiotus arduus sp. n., Paramacrobiotus celsus sp. n., Paramacrobiotus depressus sp. n., Paramacrobiotus spatialis sp. n.) and two Unconfirmed Candidate Species (UCS) within the P. richtersi complex. Paramacrobiotus fairbanksi, the only ascertained parthenogenetic, triploid species, was redescribed and showed a wide distribution (Italy, Spain, Poland, Alaska), while the amphimictic species showed limited distributions.

However, significant morbidity is associated with the harvesting of autologous bone grafts and, for that reason, alternative bone graft substitutes have been developed. In the present case series, a glass-reinforced hydroxyapatite synthetic bone substitute, with osteoinductive and osteoconductive proprieties, was applied. This synthetic bone substitute comprises the incorporation of P2O5-CaO glass-based system within a hydroxyapatite matrix, moulded into spherical pellets with 250-500 μm of diameter. A total of 14 veterinary clinical cases of appendicular bone defects and maxillary / mandibular bone defects are described. In all clinical cases, the synthetic bone substitute was used to fill bone defects, enhancing bone regeneration and complementing the recommended surgical techniques. Results demonstrated that it is an appropriate synthetic bone graft available to be used in veterinary patients. It functioned as a space filler in association with standard orthopaedic and odontological procedures of stabilization, promoting a faster bone fusion without any local or systemic adverse reactions. This procedure improves the animals' quality of life, decreasing pain and post-operative recovery period, as well as increasing bone stability improving positive clinical outcomes.","Social and psychological factors affecting utilization of female condom among youths in Migori County, Kenya.",https://www.ncbi.nlm.nih.gov/pubmed/30619618,Health psychology open,2019 01 10,"The female condom is a dual protection tool for both prevention of HIV/AIDS transmission and conception of unwanted pregnancies.

Thus, the impact of H. defensa infections on life-history characters and the underlying genetic variation for the grain aphid, Sitobion avenae (Fabricius), was explored on three plants (i.e., wheat, oat, and rye). Compared to cured lines, H. defensa infected lines of S. avenae had lower fecundity on wheat and oat, but not on rye, suggesting an infection cost for the aphid on susceptible host plants. However, when tested on rye, the infected lines showed a shorter developmental time for the nymphal stage than corresponding cured lines, showing some benefit for S. avenae carrying the endosymbiont on resistant host plants. The infection of H. defensa altered genetic variation underlying its host S. avenea's life-history characters, which was shown by differences in heritabilities and genetic correlations of life-history characters between S. avenae lines infected and cured of the endosymbiont. This was further substantiated by disparity in G-matrices of their life-history characters for the two types of aphid lines. The G-matrices for life-history characters of aphid lines infected with and cured of H. defensa were significantly different from each other on rye, but not on oat, suggesting strong plant-dependent effects. The developmental durations of infected S. avenae lines showed a lower plasticity compared with those of corresponding cured lines, and this could mean higher adaptability for the infected lines.Overall, our results showed novel functional roles of a common secondary endosymbiont (i.e., H. defensa) in plant-insect interactions, and its infections could have significant consequences for the evolutionary ecology of its host insect populations in nature.",Observer-free experimental evaluation of habitat and distance effects on the detection of anuran and bird vocalizations.,https://www.ncbi.nlm.nih.gov/pubmed/30619599,Ecology and evolution,2019 01 10,"Acoustic surveys of vocalizing animals are conducted to determine density, distribution, and diversity. Acoustic surveys are traditionally performed by human listeners, but automated recording devices (ARD) are becoming increasingly popular. Signal strength decays, or attenuates, with increasing distance between source and receiver and some habitat types may differentially increase attenuation beyond the effects of distance alone. These combined effects are rarely accounted for in acoustic monitoring programs. We evaluated the performance of three playback devices and three ARD models using the calls of six anurans, six birds, and four pure tones. Based on these evaluations, we determined the optimal playback and recording devices. Using these optimal devices, we broadcast and recorded vocalizations in five habitat types along 1,000 m transects. We used generalized linear models to test for effects of habitat, distance, species, environmental, and landscape variables. We predicted detection probabilities for each vocalization, in each habitat type, from 0 to 1,000 m. Among playback devices, only a remote predator caller simulated vocalizations consistently. Differences of ~10 dB were observed among ARDs. For all species, we found differences in detectability between open and closed canopy habitats. We observed large differences in predicted detection probability among species in each habitat type, as well as along 1,000 m transects. Increases in temperature, barometric pressure, and wind speed significantly decreased detection probability. However, aside from differences among species, habitat, and distance, topography impeding a line-of-sight between sound source and receiver had the greatest negative influence on detections. Our results suggest researchers should model the effects of habitat, distance, and frequency on detection probability when performing acoustic surveys. To optimize survey design, we recommend pilot measurements among varying habitats.",Defensive chemicals of neighboring plants limit visits of herbivorous insects: Associational resistance within a plant population.,https://www.ncbi.nlm.nih.gov/pubmed/30619598,Ecology and evolution,2019 01 10,"Despite our understanding of chemical defenses and their consequences for plant performance and herbivores, we know little about whether defensive chemicals in plant tissues, such as alkaloids, and their spatial variation within a population play unappreciated and critical roles in plant-herbivore interactions. Neighboring plants can decrease or increase attractiveness of a plant to herbivores, an example of a neighborhood effect. Chemical defensive traits may contribute to neighborhood effects in plant-herbivore interactions. We examined the effects of nicotine in leaves (a non-emitted defense chemical) on plant-herbivore interactions in a spatial context, using two varieties of Nicotiana tabacum with different nicotine levels. A common garden experiment demonstrated that visits by grasshoppers decreased with increasing density of neighboring plants with a greater nicotine level. In contrast, visits of leaf caterpillars were not affected by neighbors, irrespective of nicotine levels. Thus, our results clearly highlighted that the neighborhood effect caused by the nicotine in leaves depended on the insect identity, and it was mediated by plant-herbivore interactions, rather than plant-plant interactions. This study demonstrates that understanding of effects of plant defensive traits on plant-herbivore interactions requires careful consideration of the spatial distribution of plant defenses, and provides support for the importance of spatial context to accurately capture the ecological and evolutionary consequences of plant-herbivore interactions.",Parental habituation to human disturbance over time reduces fear of humans in coyote offspring.,https://www.ncbi.nlm.nih.gov/pubmed/30619597,Ecology and evolution,2019 01 25,"A fundamental tenet of maternal effects assumes that maternal variance over time should have discordant consequences for offspring traits across litters. Yet, seldom are parents observed across multiple reproductive bouts, with few studies considering anthropogenic disturbances as an ecological driver of maternal effects. We observed captive coyote (Canis latrans) pairs over two successive litters to determine whether among-litter differences in behavior (i.e., risk-taking) and hormones (i.e., cortisol and testosterone) corresponded with parental plasticity in habituation. Thus, we explicitly test the hypothesis that accumulating experiences of anthropogenic disturbance reduces parental fear across reproductive bouts, which should have disparate phenotypic consequences for first- and second-litter offspring. To quantify risk-taking behavior, we used foraging assays from 5-15 weeks of age with a human observer present as a proxy for human disturbance. At 5, 10, and 15 weeks of age, we collected shaved hair to quantify pup hormone levels. We then used a quantitative genetic approach to estimate heritability, repeatability, and between-trait correlations. We found that parents were riskier (i.e., foraged more frequently) with their second versus first litters, supporting our prediction that parents become increasingly habituated over time. Second-litter pups were also less risk-averse than their first-litter siblings. Heritability for all traits did not differ from zero (0.001-0.018); however, we found moderate support for repeatability in all observed traits (r = 0.085-0.421). Lastly, we found evidence of positive phenotypic and cohort correlations among pup traits, implying that cohort identity (i.e., common environment) contributes to the development of phenotypic syndromes in coyote pups. Our results suggest that parental habituation may be an ecological cue for offspring to reduce their fear response, thus emphasizing the role of parental plasticity in shaping their pups' behavioral and hormonal responses toward humans.",Eusociality outcompetes egalitarian and solitary strategies when resources are limited and reproduction is costly.,https://www.ncbi.nlm.nih.gov/pubmed/30619596,Ecology and evolution,2019 01 10,"Explaining the evolution and maintenance of animal groups remains a challenge. Surprisingly, fundamental ecological factors, such as resource variance and competition for limited resources, tend to be ignored in models of cooperation. We use a mathematical model previously developed to quantify the influence of different group sizes on resource use efficiency in egalitarian groups and extend its scope to groups with severe reproductive skew (eusocial groups). Accounting for resource limitation, the model allows calculation of optimal group sizes (highest resource use efficiency) and equilibrium population sizes in egalitarian as well as eusocial groups for a broad spectrum of environmental conditions (variance of resource supply). We show that, in contrast to egalitarian groups, eusocial groups may not only reduce variance in resource supply for survival, thus reducing the risk of starvation, they may also increase variance in resource supply for reproduction. The latter effect allows reproduction even in situations when resources are scarce. These two facets of eusocial groups, resource sharing for survival and resource pooling for reproduction, constitute two beneficial mechanisms of group formation. In a majority of environmental situations, these two benefits of eusociality increase resource use efficiency and lead to supersaturation-a strong increase in carrying capacity. The increase in resource use efficiency provides indirect benefits to group members even for low intra-group relatedness and may represent one potential explanation for the evolution and especially the maintenance of eusociality and cooperative breeding.","Environmental gradients in old-growth Appalachian forest predict fine-scale distribution, co-occurrence, and density of woodland salamanders.",https://www.ncbi.nlm.nih.gov/pubmed/30619595,Ecology and evolution,2019 01 10,"Woodland salamanders are among the most abundant vertebrate animals in temperate deciduous forests of eastern North America. Because of their abundance, woodland salamanders are responsible for the transformation of nutrients and translocation of energy between highly disparate levels of trophic organization: detrital food webs and high-order predators. However, the spatial extent of woodland salamanders' role in the ecosystem is likely contingent upon the distribution of their biomass throughout the forest. We sought to determine if natural environmental gradients influence the fine-scale distribution and density of Southern Ravine Salamanders (Plethodon richmondi) and Cumberland Plateau Salamanders (P. kentucki). We addressed this objective by constructing occupancy, co-occurrence, and abundance models from temporally replicated surveys within an old-growth forest in the Cumberland Plateau region of Kentucky. We found that Plethodon richmondi had a more restricted fine-scale distribution than P. kentucki (mean occupancy probability [

Given the critical role that woodland salamanders play in the maintenance of forest health, regions that support large populations of woodland salamanders, such as those highlighted in this study-mesic forest stands on north-to-east facing slopes with dense canopy and abundant natural cover, may provide enhanced ecosystem services and support the stability of the total forest.",Ecomorphological diversity of Australian tadpoles.,https://www.ncbi.nlm.nih.gov/pubmed/30619594,Ecology and evolution,2019 01 10,"Ecomorphology is the association between an organism's morphology and its ecology. Larval anuran amphibians (tadpoles) are classified into distinct ecomorphological guilds based upon morphological features and observations of their ecology. The extent to which guilds comprise distinct morphologies resulting from convergent evolution, the degree of morphological variability within each guild, and the degree of continuity in shape between guilds has not previously been examined in a phylogenetically informed statistical framework. Here, we examine tadpole ecomorphological guilds at a macroevolutionary scale by examining morphological diversity across the Australian continent. We use ecological data to classify species to guilds, and geometric morphometrics to quantify body shape in the tadpoles of 188 species, 77% of Australian frog diversity. We find that the ecomorphological guilds represented by Australian species are morphologically distinct, but there is substantial morphological variation associated with each guild, and all guilds together form a morphological continuum. However, in a phylogenetic comparative context, there is no significant difference in body shape among guilds. We also relate the morphological diversity of the Australian assemblage of tadpoles to a global sample and demonstrate that ecomorphological diversity of Australian tadpoles is limited with respect to worldwide species. Our results demonstrate that general patterns of ecomorphological variation are upheld in Australian tadpoles, but tadpole body shape is more variable and possibly generalist than generally appreciated.",Trade-offs for butterfly alpha and beta diversity in human-modified landscapes and tropical rainforests.,https://www.ncbi.nlm.nih.gov/pubmed/30619593,Ecology and evolution,2019 01 10,"The accelerating expansion of human populations and associated economic activity across the globe have made maintaining large, intact natural areas increasingly challenging. The difficulty of preserving large intact landscapes in the presence of growing human populations has led to a growing emphasis on landscape approaches to biodiversity conservation with a complementary strategy focused on improving conservation in human-modified landscapes. This, in turn, is leading to intense debate about the effectiveness of biodiversity conservation in human-modified landscapes and approaches to better support biodiversity in those landscapes. Here, we compared butterfly abundance, alpha richness, and beta diversity in human-modified landscapes (urban, sugarcane) and natural, forested areas to assess the conservation value of human-modified landscapes within the Wet Tropics bioregion of Australia. We used fruit-baited traps to sample butterflies and analyzed abundance and species richness in respective land uses over a one-year period. We also evaluated turnover and spatial variance components of beta diversity to determine the extent of change in temporal and spatial variation in community composition. Forests supported the largest numbers of butterflies, but were lowest in each, alpha species richness, beta turnover, and the spatial beta diversity. Sugarcane supported higher species richness, demonstrating the potential for conservation at local scales in human-modified landscapes. In contrast, beta diversity was highest in urban areas, likely driven by spatial and temporal variation in plant composition within the urban landscapes. Thus, while improving conservation on human-modified landscapes may improve local alpha richness, conserving variation in natural vegetation is critical for maintaining high beta diversity.",Linking beaver dam affected flow dynamics to upstream passage of Arctic grayling.,https://www.ncbi.nlm.nih.gov/pubmed/30619592,Ecology and evolution,2019 01 10,"Beaver reintroductions and beaver dam structures are an increasingly utilized ecological tool for rehabilitating degraded streams, yet beaver dams can potentially impact upstream fish migrations. We collected two years of data on Arctic grayling movement through a series of beaver dams in a low gradient mountain stream, utilizing radio-telemetry techniques, to determine how hydrology, dam characteristics, and fish attributes impeded passage and movement rates of spawning grayling. We compared fish movement between a ""normal"" flow year and a ""low"" flow year, determined grayling passage probabilities over dams in relation to a suite of factors, and predicted daily movement rates in relation to the number of dams each fish passed and distance between dams during upstream migration to spawning areas. We found that the average passage probability over unbreached beaver dams was 88%, though we found that it fell below 50% at specific dams. Upstream passage of grayling was affected by three main characteristics: (a) temperature, (b) breach status, and (c) hydrologic linkages that connect sections of stream above and below the dam. Other variables influence passage, but to a lesser degree. Cumulative passage varied with distance upstream and total number of dams passed in low versus normal flow years, while movement rates upstream slowed as fish swam closer to dams. Our findings demonstrate that upstream passage of fish over beaver dams is strongly correlated with hydrologic conditions with moderate controls by dam- and fish-level characteristics. Our results provide a framework that can be applied to reduce barrier effects when and where beaver dams pose a significant threat to the upstream migration of fish populations while maintaining the diverse ecological benefits of beaver activity when dams are not a threat to fish passage.","Ranging patterns, spatial overlap, and association with dolphin morbillivirus exposure in common bottlenose dolphins (Tursiops truncatus) along the Georgia, USA coast.",https://www.ncbi.nlm.nih.gov/pubmed/30619591,Ecology and evolution,2019 01 10,"During 2013-2015, an outbreak of dolphin morbillivirus (DMV) occurred in the western North Atlantic, which resulted in the stranding of over 1,600 common bottlenose dolphins (Tursiops truncatus). There are currently five coastal and 10 bay, sound, and estuary dolphin stocks along the U.S. Atlantic coast, yet there is very limited understanding of which stocks were exposed to DMV during the recent outbreak, or how DMV was transmitted across stocks. In order to address these questions, information is needed on spatial overlap and stock interactions. The goals of this project were to determine ranging patterns, prevalence of DMV, and spatial overlap of the South Carolina-Georgia (SC-GA) Coastal Stock, and adjacent Southern Georgia Estuarine System (SGES) Stock. During September 2015, a health assessment and telemetry study was conducted in which 19 dolphins were captured, tested for antibodies to DMV, and satellite tagged. Dolphins were classified into one of three ranging patterns (Coastal, Sound, or Estuary) based upon telemetry data. Coastal dolphins (likely members of the SC-GA Coastal Stock) had a significantly higher prevalence of positive DMV antibody titers (0.67; N = 2/3), than Sound and Estuary dolphins (likely members of the SGES Stock) (0.13; N = 2/16). These results suggest that the SC-GA Coastal Stock may have experienced greater exposure to DMV as compared to the SGES Stock. However, due to the small size of the SGES Stock and its exposure to high levels of persistent contaminants, this stock may be particularly vulnerable to DMV infection in the future."

Nevertheless, individual tropical insects' phenological patterns are still poorly understood, especially in the Afrotropics. To fill this gap, we investigated biodiversity patterns of Lepidoptera communities at three rainforest localities in the foothills of Mount Cameroon, West Africa, one of the wettest places in the world. Our multitaxa approach covered six lepidopteran groups (fruit-feeding butterflies and moths, the families Sphingidae, Saturniidae, and Eupterotidae, and the subfamily Arctiinae of Erebidae) with diverse life strategies. We sampled adults of the focal groups in three distinct seasons. Our sampling included standardized bait trapping (80 traps exposed for 10 days per locality and season) and attraction by light (six full nights per locality and season). Altogether, our dataset comprised 20,576 specimens belonging to 559 (morpho)species of the focal groups. The biodiversity of Lepidoptera generally increased in the high-dry season, and either increased (fruit-feeding moths, Arctiinae, Saturniidae) or decreased (butterflies, Sphingidae) in the transition to the wet season in particular groups. Simultaneously, we revealed a strong species turnover of fruit-feeding Lepidoptera and Arctiinae among the seasons, indicating relatively high specialization of these communities for particular seasons. Such temporal specialization can make the local communities of butterflies and moths especially sensitive to the expected seasonal perturbations caused by the global change. Because of the key role of Lepidoptera across trophic levels, such changes in their communities could strengthen this impact on entire tropical ecosystems.",Effects of water exchange rate on morphological and physiological characteristics of two submerged macrophytes from Erhai Lake.,https://www.ncbi.nlm.nih.gov/pubmed/30619579,Ecology and evolution,2019 01 10,"Growth patterns of aquatic macrophytes have been shown to vary in response to hydrological properties; however, such properties are typically characterized by water level fluctuation, flow velocity, flooding season, and sedimentation, but not by water exchange rate (WER). Herein, we experimentally investigated how WER (three levels: exchange 0%, 20%, and 40% of total water per day) affects water and sediment properties, and the consequences that these variations have on the individual responses of two submerged macrophytes, Hydrilla verticillata and Myriophyllum aquaticum which were planted in two different sediment types (sand and clay). In the experiment without ramets, it was found that turbidity, pH value, and dissolved carbon dioxide concentration of the system water were statistically unaffected by WER, while water dissolved oxygen (DO) concentration and sediment oxidation-reduction potential (ORP, in both sediments) consistently increased with increasing WER, regardless of experimental time. In the experiment containing ramets, biomass accumulation and relative growth rate (RGR) of both species gradually increased with increasing WER regardless of sediment type. The mechanisms were related to (a) increased oxygen availability, as indicated by gradually increased water DO concentration and sediment ORP; and (b) enhanced phosphorus (P) and nitrogen (N) absorbing abilities associated with stimulated root growth, reflected in increased mean root length, specific root length, and the root/above-ground biomass ratio, with increasing WER. Additionally, in the experiments containing ramets, significant linear relationships were consistently detected between sediment ORP and root parameters, root parameters and plant nutrients (N and P), and plant nutrients and plant growth conditions (biomass accumulation and RGR). These results demonstrate that WER plays an important role in determining oxygen availability and thus impacts the growth of submerged macrophytes by altering the ability of roots to absorb nutrients, indicating that ecosystem functions are more sensitive to WER than previously recognized.",Applying generalized allometric regressions to predict live body mass of tropical and temperate arthropods.,https://www.ncbi.nlm.nih.gov/pubmed/30619578,Ecology and evolution,2019 01 10,"The ecological implications of body size extend from the biology of individual organisms to ecosystem-level processes. Measuring body mass for high numbers of invertebrates can be logistically challenging, making length-mass regressions useful for predicting body mass with minimal effort. However, standardized sets of scaling relationships covering a large range in body length, taxonomic groups, and multiple geographical regions are scarce. We collected 6,212 arthropods from 19 higher-level taxa in both temperate and tropical locations to compile a comprehensive set of linear models relating live body mass to a range of predictor variables. We measured live weight (hereafter, body mass), body length and width of each individual and conducted linear regressions to predict body mass using body length, body width, taxonomic group, and geographic region. Additionally, we quantified prediction discrepancy when using parameters from arthropods of a different geographic region. Incorporating body width into taxon- and region-specific length-mass regressions yielded the highest prediction accuracy for body mass. Using regression parameters from a different geographic region increased prediction discrepancy, causing over- or underestimation of body mass depending on geographical origin and whether body width was included. We present a comprehensive range of parameters for predicting arthropod body mass and provide guidance for selecting optimal scaling relationships. Given the importance of body mass for functional invertebrate ecology and the paucity of adequate regressions to predict arthropod body mass from different geographical regions, our study provides a long-needed resource for quantifying live body mass in invertebrate ecology research.",Timing of maternal exposure to toxic cyanobacteria and offspring fitness in Daphnia magna: Implications for the evolution of anticipatory maternal effects.,https://www.ncbi.nlm.nih.gov/pubmed/30619577,Ecology and evolution,2019 01 10,"Organisms that regularly encounter stressful environments are expected to use cues to develop an appropriate phenotype. Water fleas (Daphnia spp.) are exposed to toxic cyanobacteria during seasonal algal blooms, which reduce growth and reproductive investment. Because generation time is typically shorter than the exposure to cyanobacteria, maternal effects provide information about the local conditions subsequent generations will experience. Here, we evaluate if maternal effects in response to microcystin, a toxin produced by cyanobacteria, represent an inheritance system evolved to transmit information in Daphnia magna. We exposed mothers as juveniles and/or as adults, and tested the offspring's fitness in toxic and non-toxic environments. Maternal exposure until reproduction reduced offspring fitness, both in the presence and in the absence of toxic cyanobacteria. However, this effect was accompanied by a small positive fitness effect, relative to offspring from unexposed mothers, in the presence of toxic cyanobacteria. This effect was mainly elicited in response to maternal exposure to toxic cyanobacteria early in life and less so during reproduction. None of these effects were explained by changes in egg size. A meta-analysis using our and others' experiments suggests that the adaptive value of maternal effects to cyanobacteria exposure is weak at best. We suggest that the beneficial maternal effect in our study is an example of phenotypic accommodation spanning generations, rather than a mechanism evolved to transmit information about cyanobacteria presence between generations.",Context-dependent costs and benefits of tuberculosis resistance traits in a wild mammalian host.,https://www.ncbi.nlm.nih.gov/pubmed/30619576,Ecology and evolution,2019 01 11,"Disease acts as a powerful driver of evolution in natural host populations, yet individuals in a population often vary in their susceptibility to infection. Energetic trade-offs between immune and reproductive investment lead to the evolution of distinct life history strategies, driven by the relative fitness costs and benefits of resisting infection. However, examples quantifying the cost of resistance outside of the laboratory are rare. Here, we observe two distinct forms of resistance to bovine tuberculosis (bTB), an important zoonotic pathogen, in a free-ranging African buffalo (Syncerus caffer) population. We characterize these phenotypes as ""infection resistance,"" in which hosts delay or prevent infection, and ""proliferation resistance,"" in which the host limits the spread of lesions caused by the pathogen after infection has occurred. We found weak evidence that infection resistance to bTB may be heritable in this buffalo population (h2 = 0.10) and comes at the cost of reduced body condition and marginally reduced survival once infected, but also associates with an overall higher reproductive rate. Infection-resistant animals thus appear to follow a ""fast"" pace-of-life syndrome, in that they reproduce more quickly but die upon infection. In contrast, proliferation resistance had no apparent costs and was associated with measures of positive host health-such as having a higher body condition and reproductive rate. This study quantifies striking phenotypic variation in pathogen resistance and provides evidence for a link between life history variation and a disease resistance trait in a wild mammalian host population.",Insect herbivory on seedlings of rainforest trees: Effects of density and distance of conspecific and heterospecific neighbors.,https://www.ncbi.nlm.nih.gov/pubmed/30619575,Ecology and evolution,2019 01 10,"Natural enemies of plants such as insect herbivores can contribute to structuring and maintaining plant diversity in tropical forests. Most research in this area has focused on the role of specialized enemies and the extent to which herbivory on individual plant species is density-dependent. Relatively few insect herbivores specialize on a single host plant species. Insect herbivores that feed on more than one plant species may link the regeneration dynamics of their host species through ""apparent competition"" or ""apparent mutualism."" We investigated herbivory and survival of seedlings of two tropical tree species (Cordia alliodora and Cordia bicolor) in the forests of Barro Colorado Island (Panama). We used experiments and observations to assess seedling fate in relation to the presence of conspecifics and heterospecifics across a range of spatial scales. Herbivory significantly increased seedling mortality and was highest at high local densities of C. alliodora seedlings. There was also evidence that high local densities of C. alliodora increased herbivory on co-occurring C. bicolor seedlings. Synthesis. The elevated rates of seedling herbivory at high densities of conspecifics documented in our study are consistent with the predictions of the Janzen-Connell hypothesis, which explains how so many plant species can coexist in tropical forests. Our data also highlight the possibility that herbivore-mediated density-dependence, facilitated by herbivores that feed on multiple plant species, can also occur across plant species. Enemy-mediated indirect effects of this sort have the potential to structure plant communities.","Effect of rearing conditions on the correlation between larval development time and pupal weight of the rice stem borer, Chilo suppressalis.",https://www.ncbi.nlm.nih.gov/pubmed/30619574,Ecology and evolution,2019 01 10,"A strong positive correlation between development time and body size is commonly assumed. However, the evidence is increasing that the correlation between the two traits can be positive, zero or negative, depending on whether the two traits are under antagonistic or synergistic selection. In the present study, we examined the relation between larval development time and pupal weight of the rice stem borer Chilo suppressalis under laboratory and field conditions. For individuals reared at constant temperatures (22, 25, 28 and 31°C), a longer larval period tended to result in larger pupae, showing a positive correlation between larval development time and pupal weight; whereas for those reared under field conditions, a longer larval period tended to result in smaller pupae at 23.5 and 29.8°C, showing a negative correlation between the two traits. There was no correlation between the two traits at the mean daily temperature of 31°C. At constant temperatures, larval development time shortened significantly as rearing temperature increased, whereas pupae tended to become larger at higher temperatures, although no significant difference was detected among temperatures for pupal weight. Under field conditions, larval development time decreased significantly as the mean daily temperature increased, whereas pupal weight of females increased significantly with the increase in the mean daily temperature, which is an example of the reverse temperature-size rule. Feeding method significantly affected larval development time and pupal weight. For individuals fed on live rice plants, larval development time shortened significantly and pupal weight increased significantly compared with those reared on fresh rice stems.",Temperature effects on prey and basal resources exceed that of predators in an experimental community.,https://www.ncbi.nlm.nih.gov/pubmed/30619572,Ecology and evolution,2019 01 10,"Climate warming alters the structure of ecological communities by modifying species interactions at different trophic levels. Yet, the consequences of warming-led modifications in biotic interactions at higher trophic levels on lower trophic groups are lesser known. Here, we test the effects of multiple predator species on prey population size and traits and subsequent effects on basal resources along an experimental temperature gradient (12-15°C, 17-20°C, and 22-25°C). We experimentally assembled food web modules with two congeneric predatory mites (Hypoaspis miles and Hypoaspis aculeifer) and two Collembola prey species (Folsomia candida and Proisotoma minuta) on a litter and yeast mixture as the basal resources. We hypothesized that warming would modify interactions within and between predator species, and that these alterations would cascade to basal resources via changes in the density and traits (body size and lipid: protein ratio) of the prey species. The presence of congeners constrained the growth of the predatory species independent of warming despite warming increased predator density in their respective monocultures. We found that warming effects on both prey and basal resources were greater than the effects of predator communities. Our results further showed opposite effects of warming on predator (increase) and prey densities (decrease), indicating a warming-induced trophic mismatch, which are likely to alter food web structures. We highlight that warmer environments can restructure food webs by its direct effects on lower trophic groups even without modifying top-down effects.",Sympatry or syntopy? Investigating drivers of distribution and co-occurrence for two imperiled sea turtle species in Gulf of Mexico neritic waters.,https://www.ncbi.nlm.nih.gov/pubmed/30619571,Ecology and evolution,2019 01 10,"Animals co-occurring in a region (sympatry) may use the same habitat (syntopy) within that region. A central aim in ecology is determining what factors drive species distributions (i.e., abiotic conditions, dispersal limitations, and/or biotic interactions). Assessing the degree of biotic interactions can be difficult for species with wide ranges at sea. This study investigated the spatial ecology of two sea turtle species that forage on benthic invertebrates in neritic GoM waters: Kemp's ridleys (Lepidochelys kempii) and loggerheads (Caretta caretta). We used satellite tracking and modeled behavioral modes, then calculated individual home ranges, compared foraging areas, and determined extent of co-occurrence. Using six environmental variables and principal component analysis, we assessed similarity of chosen foraging sites. We predicted foraging location (eco-region) based on species, nesting site, and turtle size. For 127 turtles (64 Kemp's ridleys, 63 loggerheads) tracked from 1989 to 2013, foraging home ranges were nine to ten times larger for Kemp's ridleys than for loggerheads. Species intersected off all U.S. coasts and the Yucatán Peninsula, but co-occurrence areas were small compared to species' distributions. Kemp's ridley foraging home ranges were concentrated in the northern GoM, whereas those for loggerheads were concentrated in the eastern GoM. The two species were different in all habitat variables compared (latitude, longitude, distance to shore, net primary production, mean sea surface temperature, and bathymetry). Nesting site was the single dominant variable that dictated foraging ecoregion. Although Kemp's ridleys and loggerheads may compete for resources, the separation in foraging areas, significant differences in environmental conditions, and importance of nesting location on ecoregion selection (i.e., dispersal ability) indicate that adult females of these species do not interact greatly during foraging and that dispersal and environmental factors more strongly determine their distributions. These species show sympatry in this region but evidence for syntopy was rare.",High genomic diversity and candidate genes under selection associated with range expansion in eastern coyote (Canis latrans) populations.,https://www.ncbi.nlm.nih.gov/pubmed/30619570,Ecology and evolution,2019 01 10,"Range expansion is a widespread biological process, with well-described theoretical expectations associated with the colonization of novel ranges. However, comparatively few empirical studies address the genomic outcomes accompanying the genome-wide consequences associated with the range expansion process, particularly in recent or ongoing expansions. Here, we assess two recent and distinct eastward expansion fronts of a highly mobile carnivore, the coyote (Canis latrans), to investigate patterns of genomic diversity and identify variants that may have been under selection during range expansion. Using a restriction-associated DNA sequencing (RADseq), we genotyped 394 coyotes at 22,935 SNPs and found that overall population structure corresponded to their 19th century historical range and two distinct populations that expanded during the 20th century. Counter to theoretical expectations for populations to bottleneck during range expansions, we observed minimal evidence for decreased genomic diversity across coyotes sampled along either expansion front, which is likely due to hybridization with other Canis species. Furthermore, we identified 12 SNPs, located either within genes or putative regulatory regions, that were consistently associated with range expansion. Of these 12 genes, three (CACNA1C, ALK, and EPHA6) have putative functions related to dispersal, including habituation to novel environments and spatial learning, consistent with the expectations for traits under selection during range expansion. Although coyote colonization of eastern North America is well-publicized, this study provides novel insights by identifying genes associated with dispersal capabilities in coyotes on the two eastern expansion fronts."

How mature forest trees will respond to water deficit is poorly known. We investigated wood anatomy and leaf traits in lowland tropical forest trees after 24 months of experimental rainfall exclusion. Sampling sun-exposed young canopy branches from target species, we found species-specific systematic variation in hydraulic-related wood anatomy and leaf traits in response to drought stress. Relative to controls, drought-affected individuals of different tree species variously exhibited trait measures consistent with increasing hydraulic safety. These included narrower or less vessels, reduced vessel groupings, lower theoretical water conductivities, less water storage tissue and more abundant fiber in their wood, and more occluded vessels. Drought-affected individuals also had thinner leaves, and more negative pre-dawn or mid-day leaf water potentials. Future studies examining both wood and leaf hydraulic traits should improve the representation of plant hydraulics within terrestrial ecosystem and biosphere models, and help fine-tune predictions of how future climate changes will affect tropical forests globally.",Genomic divergence in allopatric Northern Cardinals of the North American warm deserts is linked to behavioral differentiation.,https://www.ncbi.nlm.nih.gov/pubmed/30619558,Ecology and evolution,2019 01 10,"Biogeographic barriers are considered important in initiating speciation through geographic isolation, but they rarely indiscriminately and completely reduce gene flow across entire communities. Explicitly demonstrating which factors are associated with gene-flow levels across barriers would help elucidate how speciation is initiated and isolation maintained. Here, we investigated the association of behavioral isolation on population differentiation in Northern Cardinals (Cardinalis cardinalis) distributed across the Cochise Filter Barrier, a region of transitional habitat which separates the Sonoran and Chihuahuan deserts of North America. Using genomewide markers, we modeled demographic history by fitting the data to isolation and isolation-with-migration models. The best-fit model indicated that desert populations diverged in the Pleistocene with low, historic, and asymmetric gene flow across the barrier. We then tested behavioral isolation using reciprocal call-broadcast experiments to compare song recognition between deserts, controlling for song dialect changes within deserts. We found that male Northern Cardinals in both deserts were most aggressive to local songs and failed to recognize across-barrier songs. A correlation of genomic differentiation and strong song discrimination is consistent with a model where speciation is initiated across a barrier and maintained by behavioral isolation.",Silk properties and overwinter survival in gregarious butterfly larvae.,https://www.ncbi.nlm.nih.gov/pubmed/30619557,Ecology and evolution,2019 01 10,"All organisms are challenged by encounters with parasites, which strongly select for efficient escape strategies in the host. The threat is especially high for gregarious species entering immobile periods, such as diapause. Larvae of the Glanville fritillary butterfly, Melitaea cinxia, spend the winter in diapause in groups of conspecifics each sheltered in a silk nest. Despite intensive monitoring of the population, we have little understanding of the ecological factors influencing larval survival over the winter in the field. We tested whether qualitative and quantitative properties of the silk nest contribute to larval survival over diapause. We used comparative proteomics, metabarcoding analyses, microscopic imaging, and in vitro experiments to compare protein composition of the silk, community composition of the silk-associated microbiota, and silk density from both wild-collected and laboratory-reared families, which survived or died in the field. Although most traits assessed varied across families, only silk density was correlated with overwinter survival in the field. The silk nest spun by gregarious larvae before the winter acts as an efficient breathable physical shield that positively affects larval survival during diapause. Such benefit may explain how this costly trait is conserved across populations of this butterfly species and potentially across other silk-spinning insect species.",Predator size-structure and species identity determine cascading effects in a coastal ecosystem.,https://www.ncbi.nlm.nih.gov/pubmed/30619556,Ecology and evolution,2019 01 10,"Cascading consequences of predator extinctions are well documented, but impacts of perturbations to predator size-structure and how these vary across species remain unclear. Body size is hypothesized to be a key trait governing individual predators' impact on ecosystems. Therefore, shifts in predator size-structure should trigger ecosystem ramifications which are consistent across functionally similar species. Using a US salt marsh as a model system, we tested this hypothesis by manipulating size class (small, medium, and large) and size diversity (combination of all three size classes) within two closely related and functionally similar predatory crab species over 4 months. Across treatments, predators suppressed densities of a dominant grazer and an ecosystem engineer, enhanced plant biomass, and altered sediment properties (redox potential and saturation). Over the metabolically equivalent experimental predator treatments, small size class predators had stronger average impacts on response variables, and size class interacted with predator species identity to drive engineer suppression. Within both predator species, size diversity increased cannibalism and slightly weakened the average impact. These results show that predator impacts in a salt marsh ecosystem are determined by both size class and size diversity; they also highlight that size class can have species-dependent and response-dependent effects, underlining the challenge of generalizing trait effects.",Predator-prey feedback in a gyrfalcon-ptarmigan system?,https://www.ncbi.nlm.nih.gov/pubmed/30619555,Ecology and evolution,2019 01 10,"Specialist predators with oscillating dynamics are often strongly affected by the population dynamics of their prey, yet they are not always the cause of prey cycling. Only those that exert strong (delayed) regulation of their prey can be. Inferring predator-prey coupling from time series therefore requires contrasting models with top-down versus bottom-up predator-prey dynamics. We study here the joint dynamics of population densities of the Icelandic gyrfalcon Falco rusticolus, and its prey, the rock ptarmigan Lagopus muta. The dynamics of both species are likely not only linked to each other but also to stochastic weather variables acting as confounding factors. We infer the degree of coupling between populations, as well as forcing by abiotic variables, using multivariate autoregressive models MAR(p), with p = 1 and 2 time lags. MAR(2) models, allowing for species to cycle independently from each other, further suggest alternative scenarios where a cyclic prey influences its predator but not the other way around (i.e., bottom-up scenarios). The classical MAR(1) model predicts that the time series exhibit predator-prey feedback (i.e., reciprocal dynamic influence between prey and predator), and that weather effects are weak and only affecting the gyrfalcon population. Bottom-up MAR(2) models produced a better fit but less realistic cross-correlation patterns. Simulations of MAR(1) and MAR(2) models further demonstrate that the top-down MAR(1) models are more likely to be misidentified as bottom-up dynamics than vice versa. We therefore conclude that predator-prey feedback in the gyrfalcon-ptarmigan system is likely the main cause of observed oscillations, though bottom-up dynamics cannot yet be excluded with certainty. Overall, we showed how to make more out of ecological time series by using simulations to gauge the quality of model identification, and paved the way for more mechanistic modeling of this system by narrowing the set of important biotic and abiotic drivers.","An expanded molecular phylogeny of Plumbaginaceae, with emphasis on Limonium (sea lavenders): Taxonomic implications and biogeographic considerations.",https://www.ncbi.nlm.nih.gov/pubmed/30619554,Ecology and evolution,2019 01 10,"Plumbaginaceae is characterized by a history of multiple taxonomic rearrangements and lacks a broad molecular phylogenetic framework. Limonium is the most species-rich genus of the family with ca. 600 species and cosmopolitan distribution. Its center of diversity is the Mediterranean region, where ca. 70% of all Limonium species are endemic. In this study, we sample 201 Limonium species covering all described infrageneric entities and spanning its wide geographic range, along with 64 species of other Plumbaginaceae genera, representing 23 out of 29 genera of the family. Additionally, 20 species of the sister family Polygonaceae were used as outgroup. Sequences of three chloroplast (trnL-F, matK, and rbcL) and one nuclear (ITS) loci were used to infer the molecular phylogeny employing maximum likelihood and Bayesian analyses. According to our results, within Plumbaginoideae, Plumbago forms a non-monophyletic assemblage, with Plumbago europaea sister to Plumbagella, while the other Plumbago species form a clade sister to Dyerophytum. Within Limonioideae, Ikonnikovia is nested in Goniolimon, rejecting its former segregation as genus distinct from Goniolimon. Limonium is divided into two major clades: Limonium subg. Pteroclados s.l., including L. sect. Pteroclados and L. anthericoides, and L. subg. Limonium. The latter is divided into three well-supported subclades: the monospecific L. sect. Limoniodendron sister to a clade comprising a mostly non-Mediterranean subclade and a Mediterranean subclade. Our results set the foundation for taxonomic proposals on sections and subsections of Limonium, namely: (a) the newly described L. sect. Tenuiramosum, created to assign L. anthericoides at the sectional rank; (b) the more restricted circumscriptions of L. sect. Limonium (= L. sect. Limonium subsect. Genuinae) and L. sect. Sarcophyllum (for the Sudano-Zambezian/Saharo-Arabian clade); (c) the more expanded circumscription of L. sect.

The maternal phenotype can profoundly influence the potential for such environmentally induced adjustments of the offspring phenotype, causing correlations between offspring and maternal traits. Here, we study potential effects of the maternal phenotype on offspring provisioning prior to and during gestation in the matrotrophic live-bearing fish species Poeciliopsis retropinna. Specifically, we examine how maternal traits such as body fat, lean mass, and length relate to pre- (i.e., allocation to the egg prior to fertilization) and post-fertilization (i.e., allocation to the embryo during pregnancy) maternal provisioning and how this ultimately affects offspring size and body composition at birth. We show that pre- and post-fertilization maternal provisioning is associated with maternal length and body fat, but not with maternal lean mass. Maternal length is proportionally associated with egg mass at fertilization and offspring mass at birth, notably without changing the ratio of pre- to post-fertilization maternal provisioning. This ratio, referred to as the matrotrophy index (MI), is often used to quantify the level of matrotrophy. By contrast, the proportion of maternal body fat is positively associated with post-fertilization, but not pre-fertilization, maternal provisioning and consequently is strongly positively correlated with the MI. We furthermore found that the composition of embryos changes throughout pregnancy. Females invest first in embryo lean mass, and then allocate fat reserves to embryos very late in pregnancy. We argue that this delay in fat allocation may be adaptive, because it delays an unnecessary high reproductive burden to the mother during earlier stages of pregnancy, potentially leading to a more slender body shape and improved locomotor performance. In conclusion, our study suggests that (a) offspring size at birth is a plastic trait that is predicted by both maternal length and body fat, and (b) the MI is a plastic trait that is predicted solely by the proportion of maternal body fat. It herewith provides new insights into the potential maternal causes and consequences of embryo provisioning during pregnancy in matrotrophic live-bearing species.",Does metabolism constrain bird and mammal ranges and predict shifts in response to climate change?,https://www.ncbi.nlm.nih.gov/pubmed/30619552,Ecology and evolution,2019 01 10,"Mechanistic approaches for predicting the ranges of endotherms are needed to forecast their responses to environmental change. We test whether physiological constraints on maximum metabolic rate and the factor by which endotherms can elevate their metabolism (metabolic expansibility) influence cold range limits for mammal and bird species. We examine metabolic expansibility at the cold range boundary (MECRB) and whether species' traits can predict variability in MECRB and then use MECRB as an initial approach to project range shifts for 210 mammal and 61 bird species. We find evidence for metabolic constraints: the distributions of metabolic expansibility at the cold range boundary peak at similar values for birds (2.7) and mammals (3.2). The right skewed distributions suggest some species have adapted to elevate or evade metabolic constraints. Mammals exhibit greater skew than birds, consistent with their diverse thermoregulatory adaptations and behaviors. Mammal and bird species that are small and occupy low trophic levels exhibit high levels of MECRB. Mammals with high MECRB tend to hibernate or use torpor. Predicted metabolic rates at the cold range boundaries represent large energetic expenditures (>50% of maximum metabolic rates). We project species to shift their cold range boundaries poleward by an average of 3.9° latitude by 2070 if metabolic constraints remain constant. Our analysis suggests that metabolic constraints provide a viable mechanism for initial projections of the cold range boundaries for endotherms. However, errors and approximations in estimating metabolic constraints (e.g., acclimation responses) and evasion of these constraints (e.g., torpor/hibernation, microclimate selection) highlight the need for more detailed, taxa-specific mechanistic models. Even coarse considerations of metabolism will likely lead to improved predictions over exclusively considering thermal tolerance for endotherms.",Partitioning genetic and species diversity refines our understanding of species-genetic diversity relationships.,https://www.ncbi.nlm.nih.gov/pubmed/30619550,Ecology and evolution,2019 01 10,"Disentangling the origin of species-genetic diversity correlations (SGDCs) is a challenging task that provides insight into the way that neutral and adaptive processes influence diversity at multiple levels. Genetic and species diversity are comprised by components that respond differently to the same ecological processes. Thus, it can be useful to partition species and genetic diversity into their different components to infer the mechanisms behind SGDCs. In this study, we applied such an approach using a high-elevation Andean wetland system, where previous evidence identified neutral processes as major determinants of the strong and positive covariation between plant species richness and AFLP genetic diversity of the common sedge Carex gayana. To tease apart putative neutral and non-neutral genetic variation of C. gayana, we identified loci putatively under selection from a dataset of 1,709 SNPs produced using restriction site-associated DNA sequencing (RAD-seq). Significant and positive relationships between local estimates of genetic and species diversities (α-SGDCs) were only found with the putatively neutral loci datasets and with species richness, confirming that neutral processes were primarily driving the correlations and that the involved processes differentially influenced local species diversity components (i.e., richness and evenness). In contrast, SGDCs based on genetic and community dissimilarities (β-SGDCs) were only significant with the putative non-neutral datasets. This suggests that selective processes influencing C. gayana genetic diversity were involved in the detected correlations. Together, our results demonstrate that analyzing distinct components of genetic and species diversity simultaneously is useful to determine the mechanisms behind species-genetic diversity relationships.",A broadly applicable COI primer pair and an efficient single-tube amplicon library preparation protocol for metabarcoding.,https://www.ncbi.nlm.nih.gov/pubmed/30619549,Ecology and evolution,2019 01 10,"The nucleotide variation in the cytochrome c oxidase subunit I (COI) gene makes it ideal for assigning sequences to species. However, this variability also makes it difficult to design truly universal primers. Here, we present the forward primer ""Sauron-S878,"" specifically designed to facilitate library preparation for metabarcoding. This primer is modified to improve the coverage of terrestrial species compared to the primer mCOIintF, optimized for aquatic systems, which raised the in silico coverage from 74.4% to 98.3% of available NCBI sequences (perfect match in 3' region, up to three mismatches in remaining primer). When paired with the reverse primer ""jgHCO2198"" (fragment length ~313 bp), these primers amplified 98.4% of 255 tested DNA extracts from various taxa, which are better than many other common COI barcoding primers. Furthermore, a single-tube protocol was developed, wherein these primers amplify the target gene, and attach MIDs and Illumina sequencing adapters in one reaction. This eliminates the need for re-amplification or enzymatic ligation during library preparation while keeping the flexibility to modularly combine primers and MIDs. Using the single-tube approach, three replicates of three mock samples were sequenced on a MiSeq platform with no adverse effects compared to commercial Nextera indexing kits. From this run, 75% of all included taxa could be recovered, with no considerable bias among taxonomic groups. Despite the fact that 98.4% of the extracts were confirmed to amplify in vitro, this number was lower than expected. A reason for this discrepancy was a clear link between the relative concentration of a specific DNA type in the template and the number of returned reads for this DNA. We would argue that such a bias may be especially problematic in metabarcoding where samples usually contain trace DNA in unknown amounts. However, how this affects the completeness of metabarcoding results has yet been poorly investigated."

Method: A cross-sectional study, with two groups (201 informal caregivers, and 187 non-caregivers) was conducted. Participants completed questionnaires on cognitive and affective empathy, and depression, anxiety, and caregiver burden. AN(C)OVA's and multiple hierarchical regression analyses including linear and quadratic terms were used to analyze the data. Results: For caregivers, there was a negative quadratic relationship between depression and cognitive empathy, and a positive linear relationship between anxiety and affective empathy, irrespective of sociodemographic characteristics. For non-caregivers, there were positive quadratic relationships between depression and cognitive and affective empathy, and between anxiety and affective empathy. The empathy levels did not differ between the groups. Conclusions: While caregivers and non-caregivers had the same amount of empathy, the relationships between empathy and depression and anxiety differed between the groups.

A previous study has found out that miR-144-3p was a biomarker of type 2 diabetes, but the role of miR-144-3p in regulating adipogenesis was still unclear. In the present study, the expression of miR-144-3p increased in obese mice and during the 3T3-L1 differentiation process. Overexpression of miR-144-3p suppressed the expression of cell cycle regulatory factors and inhibited pre-adipocytes proliferation. Besides, overexpression of miR-144-3p accelerated lipid accumulation in adipocytes and positively regulated adipogenesis, which was also accompanied by increasing the expression of genes related to fatty acid synthesis and decreasing the expression of genes involved in fatty acid oxidation. Furthermore, luciferase activity assays indicated that miR-144-3p directly targeted Klf3 and CtBP2. The process was also confirmed by the mRNA and protein expression of Klf3 and CtBP2, which were suppressed by miR-144-3p. Furthermore, miR-144-3p targeting Klf3/CtBP2 would induce C/EBPα activity by releasing corepressors (Klf3 and CtBP2) from its promoter region. Moreover, we also observed that miR-144-3p could promote adipogenesis in mice injected with miR-144-3p agomir through tail-vein injection. Taken together, these results support that miR-144-3p can facilitate adipogenesis both in vitro and in vivo, which implies that miR-144-3p could be a target for therapeutic intervention in obesity and metabolic syndrome in the future.",Altered Expression of Mitochondrial NAD+ Carriers Influences Yeast Chronological Lifespan by Modulating Cytosolic and Mitochondrial Metabolism.,https://www.ncbi.nlm.nih.gov/pubmed/30619489,Frontiers in genetics,2019 01 10,"Nicotinamide adenine dinucleotide (NAD+) represents an essential cofactor in sustaining cellular bioenergetics and maintaining cellular fitness, and has emerged as a therapeutic target to counteract aging and age-related diseases. Besides NAD+ involvement in multiple redox reactions, it is also required as co-substrate for the activity of Sirtuins, a family of evolutionary conserved NAD+-dependent deacetylases that regulate both metabolism and aging. The founding member of this family is Sir2 of Saccharomyces cerevisiae, a well-established model system for studying aging of post-mitotic mammalian cells. In this context, it refers to chronological aging, in which the chronological lifespan (CLS) is measured. In this paper, we investigated the effects of changes in the cellular content of NAD+ on CLS by altering the expression of mitochondrial NAD+ carriers, namely Ndt1 and Ndt2. We found that the deletion or overexpression of these carriers alters the intracellular levels of NAD+ with opposite outcomes on CLS. In particular, lack of both carriers decreases NAD+ content and extends CLS, whereas NDT1 overexpression increases NAD+ content and reduces CLS. This correlates with opposite cytosolic and mitochondrial metabolic assets shown by the two types of mutants. In the former, an increase in the efficiency of oxidative phosphorylation is observed together with an enhancement of a pro-longevity anabolic metabolism toward gluconeogenesis and trehalose storage. On the contrary, NDT1 overexpression brings about on the one hand, a decrease in the respiratory efficiency generating harmful superoxide anions, and on the other, a decrease in gluconeogenesis and trehalose stores: all this is reflected into a time-dependent loss of mitochondrial functionality during chronological aging.",Ras-Induced miR-146a and 193a Target Jmjd6 to Regulate Melanoma Progression.,https://www.ncbi.nlm.nih.gov/pubmed/30619488,Frontiers in genetics,2019 01 10,"Ras genes are among the most commonly mutated genes in human cancer; yet our understanding of their oncogenic activity at the molecular mechanistic level is incomplete. To identify downstream events that mediate ras-induced cellular transformation in vivo, we analyzed global microRNA expression in three different models of Ras-induction and tumor formation in zebrafish. Six microRNAs were found increased in Ras-induced melanoma, glioma and in an inducible model of ubiquitous Ras expression. The upregulation of the microRNAs depended on the activation of the ERK and AKT pathways and to a lesser extent, on mTOR signaling. Two Ras-induced microRNAs (miR-146a and 193a) target Jmjd6, inducing downregulation of its mRNA and protein levels at the onset of Ras expression during melanoma development. However, at later stages of melanoma progression, jmjd6 levels were found elevated. The dynamic of Jmjd6 levels during progression of melanoma in the zebrafish model suggests that upregulation of the microRNAs targeting Jmjd6 may be part of an anti-cancer response. Indeed, triple transgenic fish engineered to express a microRNA-resistant Jmjd6 from the onset of melanoma have increased tumor burden, higher infiltration of leukocytes and shorter melanoma-free survival. Increased JMJD6 expression is found in several human cancers, including melanoma, suggesting that the up-regulation of Jmjd6 is a critical event in tumor progression.

Therefore, to deepen our understanding of gene expression regulation, delimitation of these regions with high accuracy is needed. The trypanosomatid lineage includes a variety of parasitic protozoans causing a significant worldwide burden on human health. Given their peculiar mechanisms of gene expression, these organisms depend on post-transcriptional regulation as the main level of gene expression control. In this context, the definition of the UTR regions becomes of key importance. We have developed UTR-mini-exon (UTRme), a graphical user interface (GUI) stand-alone application to identify and annotate 5' and 3' UTR regions in a highly accurate way. UTRme implements a multiple scoring system tailored to address the issue of false positive UTR assignment that frequently arise because of the characteristics of the intergenic regions. Even though it was developed for trypanosomatids, the tool can be used to predict 3' sites in any eukaryote and 5' UTRs in any organism where trans-splicing occurs (such as the model organism C. elegans). UTRme offers a way for non-bioinformaticians to precisely determine UTRs from transcriptomic data. The tool is freely available via the conda and github repositories.",The Importance of Biologic Knowledge and Gene Expression Context for Genomic Data Interpretation.,https://www.ncbi.nlm.nih.gov/pubmed/30619486,Frontiers in genetics,2019 01 10,"Background: Genomic sequencing, including whole exome sequencing (WES), is enabling a higher resolution for defining diseases, understand mechanisms, and improving the practice of clinical care. However, WES routinely identifies genomic variants with uncertain functional effects. Furthering uncertainty in WES data interpretation is that many genes can express multiple transcripts and their relative expression may differ by body tissue. In order to interpret WES data, we not only need to understand which transcript is most relevant, but what tissue is most relevant. Methods: In this work, we quantify how frequently differences in transcript and tissue expression affect WES data interpretation at gene, pathway, disease, and biologic network levels. We combined and analyzed multiple large and publically available datasets to inform genomic data interpretation. Results: Across well-established biologic pathways and genes with pathogenic disease variants, 54 and 40% have a different protein coding effect by transcript selection for, respectively, 25 and 50% of the genes contained. Additionally, strong differences in human tissue expression levels affect 33 and 19% of the same set of pathways and diseases for, respectively, 25 and 50% of the genes contained. Conclusion: Whole exome sequencing identifies genomic variants, but to interpret the functional effects of those variants in high-resolution, we recommend building transcript selection and cross-tissue gene expression levels into hypotheses and analyses. Using current large-scale data, we show how extensively interpretation of genomic variants may differ according to transcript and tissue, across most pathways and disease. Thus, their inclusion is necessary for WES data interpretation.",Whole-Genome Sequencing Identifies a Novel Variation of WAS Gene Coordinating With Heterozygous Germline Mutation of APC to Enhance Hepatoblastoma Oncogenesis.,https://www.ncbi.nlm.nih.gov/pubmed/30619485,Frontiers in genetics,2019 01 10,"Hepatoblastoma (HB), a leading primary hepatic malignancy in children, originates from primitive hepatic stem cells. This study aimed to uncover the genetic variants that are responsible for HB oncogenesis. One family, which includes the healthy parents, and two brothers affected by HB, was recruited. Whole-genome sequencing (WGS) of germline DNA from all the family members identified two maternal variants, located within APC gene and X-linked WAS gene, which were harbored by the two brothers. The mutation of APC (rs137854573, c.C1606T, p.R536X) could result in HB carcinogenesis by activating Wnt signaling. The WAS variant (c.G3T, p.M1-P5del) could promote HB cell proliferation and inhibit T-cell-based immunity by activating PLK1 signaling and inactivating TCR signaling. Further analysis reflected that WAS deficiency might affect the antitumor activity of natural killer and dendritic cells. In summary, the obtained results imply that an APC mutant together with an X-linked WAS mutant, could lead to HB tumorigenesis by activating Wnt and PLK1 signaling, inhibiting TCR signaling, and reducing the antitumor activity of natural killer and dendritic cells.",Zearalenone: A Mycotoxin With Different Toxic Effect in Domestic and Laboratory Animals' Granulosa Cells.,https://www.ncbi.nlm.nih.gov/pubmed/30619484,Frontiers in genetics,2019 01 10,"Zearalenone (ZEA), one of the most prevalent estrogenic mycotoxins, is mainly produced by Fusarium fungi and has been proven to affect the reproductive capacity of animals. Exposure of farm animals to ZEA is a global public health concern because of its toxicity and wide distribution in animal feeds. In vitro and in vivo experiments indicate that ZEA possesses estrogenic activity in mice, swine, Equus asinus and cattle. The precise mechanism of the reproductive toxicity of ZEA has not been established yet. This article reviews evidence on the deleterious effects of ZEA on mammalian folliculogenesis from early to final oogenesis stages. Such effects include impaired granulosa cell (GC) development and follicle steroidogenesis, reduced oocyte nest breakdown, damaged meiotic progression, poor fetal oocyte survival, accelerated primordial follicle activation and enhanced follicle atresia. These phenomena may result in reproductive and non-reproductive problems in domestic animals. In addition, emerging data indicates that ZEA may cause mRNA expression changes in the GCs. In general, E. asinus is more sensitive than swine to ZEA exposure. Finally, results of in vivo animal studies and in vitro tests are reported and discussed."

Using Dense SNP Genotypes.,https://www.ncbi.nlm.nih.gov/pubmed/30619473,Frontiers in genetics,2019 01 10,"Chilean Farmed Atlantic salmon (Salmo salar) populations were established with individuals of both European and North American origins. These populations are expected to be highly genetically differentiated due to evolutionary history and poor gene flow between ancestral populations from different continents. The extent and decay of linkage disequilibrium (LD) among single nucleotide polymorphism (SNP) impacts the implementation of genome-wide association studies and genomic selection and provides relevant information about demographic processes of fish populations. We assessed the population structure and characterized the extent and decay of LD in three Chilean commercial populations of Atlantic salmon with North American (NAM), Scottish (SCO), and Norwegian (NOR) origin. A total of 123 animals were genotyped using a 159 K SNP Axiom® myDesignTM Genotyping Array. A total of 32 K SNP markers, representing the common SNPs along the three populations after quality control were used. The principal component analysis explained 78.9% of the genetic diversity between populations, clearly discriminating between populations of North American and European origin, and also between European populations. NAM had the lowest effective population size, followed by SCO and NOR. Large differences in the LD decay were observed between populations of North American and European origin. An r2 threshold of 0.2 was estimated for marker pairs separated by 7,800, 64, and 50 kb in the NAM, SCO, and NOR populations, respectively. In this study we show that this SNP panel can be used to detect association between markers and traits of interests and also to capture high-resolution information for genome-enabled predictions. Also, we suggest the feasibility to achieve similar prediction accuracies using a smaller SNP data set for the NAM population, compared with samples with European origin which would need a higher density SNP array.",Effect of Genotype and Maternal Affective Disorder on Intronic Methylation of FK506 Binding Protein 5 in Cord Blood DNA.,https://www.ncbi.nlm.nih.gov/pubmed/30619472,Frontiers in genetics,2019 01 11,"A single nucleotide polymorphism (SNP: rs1360780) in FKBP5 (FK506 Binding Protein 5) has been shown to interact with exposure to childhood adversity to promote loss of methylation and increase in gene expression in adults. We asked whether rs1360780 can influence FKBP5 intronic methylation in the context of exposure to maternal affective disorders in utero. Sixty cord blood DNA samples from the Boston Birth Cohort were genotyped at rs1360780 and studied for methylation changes as they relate to genotype and exposure to affective disorders during pregnancy. Linear regression was employed to contrast the risk (TT) genotype to the heterozygous (CT) and homozygous (CC) genotypes with adjustment for potential confounders. The recessive genotype (TT) was associated with increased methylation at multiple CpGs in the FKBP5 intron 5 region (p < 0.01). These findings were enhanced among cases exposed to maternal affective disorders (p = 0.02). A human cell line treated with cortisol showed that changes in intron 5 CpG methylation and FKBP5 expression were inversely associated. These findings suggest that rs1360780 can influence FKBP5 intronic methylation by acting in cis as a methylation quantitative locus and highlight the impact of genotypic risk on methylation in utero. Additionally, prenatal stress exposure compounded with the risk genotype may lead to a compensatory increase in methylation.",Interpreting Non-coding Genetic Variation in Multiple Sclerosis Genome-Wide Associated Regions.,https://www.ncbi.nlm.nih.gov/pubmed/30619471,Frontiers in genetics,2019 01 10,"Multiple sclerosis (MS) is the most common neurological disorder in young adults. Despite extensive studies, only a fraction of MS heritability has been explained, with association studies focusing primarily on protein-coding genes, essentially for the difficulty of interpreting non-coding features. However, non-coding RNAs (ncRNAs) and functional elements, such as super-enhancers (SE), are crucial regulators of many pathways and cellular mechanisms, and they have been implicated in a growing number of diseases. In this work, we searched for possible enrichments in non-coding elements at MS genome-wide associated loci, with the aim to highlight their possible involvement in the susceptibility to the disease. We first reconstructed the linkage disequilibrium (LD) structure of the Italian population using data of 727,478 single-nucleotide polymorphisms (SNPs) from 1,668 healthy individuals. The genomic coordinates of the obtained LD blocks were intersected with those of the top hits identified in previously published MS genome-wide association studies (GWAS). By a bootstrapping approach, we hence demonstrated a striking enrichment of non-coding elements, especially of circular RNAs (circRNAs) mapping in the 73 LD blocks harboring MS-associated SNPs. In particular, we found a total of 482 circRNAs (annotated in publicly available databases) vs. a mean of 194 ± 65 in the random sets of LD blocks, using 1,000 iterations. As a proof of concept of a possible functional relevance of this observation, we experimentally verified that the expression levels of a circRNA derived from an MS-associated locus, i.e., hsa_circ_0043813 from the STAT3 gene, can be modulated by the three genotypes at the disease-associated SNP. Finally, by evaluating RNA-seq data of two cell lines, SH-SY5Y and Jurkat cells, representing tissues relevant for MS, we identified 18 (two novel) circRNAs derived from MS-associated genes. In conclusion, this work showed for the first time that MS-GWAS top hits map in LD blocks enriched in circRNAs, suggesting circRNAs as possible novel contributors to the disease pathogenesis.",DNA Methylation and Gene Expression of Matrix Metalloproteinase 9 Gene in Deficit and Non-deficit Schizophrenia.,https://www.ncbi.nlm.nih.gov/pubmed/30619470,Frontiers in genetics,2019 01 10,"The biological pathology of deficit schizophrenia (DS) remains unclear. Matrix metalloproteinase 9 (MMP9) might be associated with neural plasticity and glutamate regulation, involved in schizophrenia pathogenesis. This study explores gene expression and DNA methylation of MMP9 in peripheral blood mononuclear cells (PBMCs) and their relationship with clinical symptoms in DS and non-deficit schizophrenia (NDS). Pyrosequencing was used to determine DNA methylation at CpG sites in exon 4 and exon 5 of MMP9 in 51 DS patients, 53 NDS patients and 50 healthy subjects (HC). RT-qPCR was used to detect MMP9 expression. Clinical symptoms were assessed by BPRS, SANS and SAPS scales. MMP9 expression in PBMCs was significantly higher in DS than NDS and HC subjects. Compared to NDS patients, DS patients had significantly lower DNA methylation at individual CpG sites in exon 4 and exon 5 of MMP9. Correlation analysis showed that DNA methylation in exon 4 was negatively correlated with gene expression in DS group. Positive correlation was found between MMP9 expression and negative symptoms in total schizophrenic patients. The social amotivation factor of SANS and negative syndrome of BPRS was negatively correlated with DNA methylation of CpG5-1 in DS patients but not in NDS patients. DS patients showed a specific abnormality of peripheral MMP9 expression and DNA methylation, indicating a pathological mechanism underlying DS as a specific subgroup of schizophrenia.",PhageWeb - Web Interface for Rapid Identification and Characterization of Prophages in Bacterial Genomes.,https://www.ncbi.nlm.nih.gov/pubmed/30619469,Frontiers in genetics,2019 01 10,"This study developed a computational tool with a graphical interface and a web-service that allows the identification of phage regions through homology search and gene clustering. It uses G+C content variation evaluation and tRNA prediction sites as evidence to reinforce the presence of prophages in indeterminate regions. Also, it performs the functional characterization of the prophages regions through data integration of biological databases. The performance of PhageWeb was compared to other available tools (PHASTER, Prophinder, and PhiSpy) using Sensitivity (Sn) and Positive Predictive Value (PPV) tests. As a reference for the tests, more than 80 manually annotated genomes were used. In the PhageWeb analysis, the Sn index was 86.1% and the PPV was approximately 87%, while the second best tool presented Sn and PPV values of 83.3 and 86.5%, respectively. These numbers allowed us to observe a greater precision in the regions identified by PhageWeb while compared to other prediction tools submitted to the same tests. Additionally, PhageWeb was much faster than the other computational alternatives, decreasing the processing time to approximately one-ninth of the time required by the second best software.

We exposed C57BL/6J offspring to a high protein/low carbohydrate (HP/LC) or low protein/high carbohydrate (LP/HC) diet during gestation and lactation, and measured metabolic phenotypes between birth and 10 months of age in male offspring. Perinatal HP/LC and LP/HC exposures resulted in a decreased ability to clear glucose in the offspring, with reduced baseline insulin and glucose concentrations in the LP/HC group and a reduced insulin response post-glucose challenge in the HP/LC group. The LP/HC diet group also showed reduced birth and weanling weights, whereas the HP/LC offspring displayed increased weanling weight with increased adiposity beyond 5 months of age. Gene expression profiling of hypothalamus and liver revealed alterations in diverse molecular pathways by both diets. Specifically, hypothalamic transcriptome and pathway analyses demonstrated perturbations of MAPK and hedgehog signaling, processes associated with neural restructuring and transmission, and phosphate metabolism by perinatal protein imbalances. Liver transcriptomics revealed changes in purine and phosphate metabolism, hedgehog signaling, and circadian rhythm pathways. Our results indicate maternal protein imbalances perturbing molecular pathways in central and peripheral metabolic tissues, thereby predisposing the male offspring to metabolic dysfunctions.",Secoisolariciresinol Diglucoside of Flaxseed and Its Metabolites: Biosynthesis and Potential for Nutraceuticals.,https://www.ncbi.nlm.nih.gov/pubmed/30619466,Frontiers in genetics,2019 01 10,"Secoisolariciresinol diglucoside (SDG), found mainly in flaxseed, is one of the essential lignans. SDG, as well as the beneficial fatty acid composition and high fiber content, has made flaxseed an important source of functional food or nutraceutical ingredients. Various studies have shown that SDG offers several health benefits, including protective effects against cardiovascular diseases, diabetes, cancer, and mental stress. These health benefits have been attributed to the antioxidant properties of SDG. Additionally, SDG metabolites, namely mammalian lignans, enterodiol and enterolactone, have shown promising effects against cancer. Therefore, understanding the biosynthetic pathway of SDG and its molecular mechanisms is a key to enable the production of new flaxseed cultivars rich in nutraceutical content. The present review highlights studies on the different health benefits of SDG, as well as lignan biosynthesis in flaxseed and genes involved in the biosynthetic pathway. Since SDG, the predominant lignan in flaxseed, is a glycosylated lignan, we also focus on studies investigating the genes involved in secoisolariciresinol glycosylation. These genes can be used to produce new cultivars with a novel level of glycosylation or lignan composition to maximize the yields of lignans with a therapeutic or protective potential.",Epigenetics of Modified DNA Bases: 5-Methylcytosine and Beyond.,https://www.ncbi.nlm.nih.gov/pubmed/30619465,Frontiers in genetics,2019 01 10,"Modification of DNA bases plays vital roles in the epigenetic control of gene expression in both animals and plants. Though much attention is given to the conventional epigenetic signature 5-methylcytosine (5-mC), the field of epigenetics is attracting increased scientific interest through the discovery of additional modifications of DNA bases and their roles in controlling gene expression. Theoretically, each of the DNA bases can be modified; however, modifications of cytosine and adenine only are known so far. This review focuses on the recent findings of the well-studied cytosine modifications and yet poorly characterized adenine modification which serve as an additional layer of epigenetic regulation in animals and discuss their potential roles in plants. Cytosine modification at symmetric (CG, CHG) and asymmetric (CHH) contexts is a key epigenetic feature. In addition to the ROS1 family mediated demethylation, Ten-Eleven Translocation family proteins-mediated hydroxylation of 5-mC to 5-hydroxymethylcytosine as additional active demethylation pathway are also discussed. The epigenetic marks are known to be associated with the regulation of several cellular and developmental processes, pluripotency of stem cells, neuron cell development, and tumor development in animals. Therefore, the most recently discovered N6-methyladenine, an additional epigenetic mark with regulatory potential, is also described. Interestingly, these newly discovered modifications are also found in the genomes which lack canonical 5-mC, signifying their independent epigenetic functions. These modified DNA bases are considered to be important players in epigenomics. The potential for combinatorial interaction among the known modified DNA bases suggests that epigenetic codon is likely to be substantially more complicated than it is thought today.",Origin and Diversification of South American Polyploid Silene Sect. Physolychnis (Caryophyllaceae) in the Andes and Patagonia.,https://www.ncbi.nlm.nih.gov/pubmed/30619464,Frontiers in genetics,2019 01 10,"The Andes are an important biogeographic region in South America extending for about 8000 km from Venezuela to Argentina. They are - along with the Patagonian steppes - the main distribution area of ca. 18 polyploid species of Silene sect. Physolychnis. Using nuclear ITS and plastid psbE-petG and matK sequences, flow cytometric ploidy level estimations and chromosome counts, and including 13 South American species, we explored the origin and diversification of this group. Our data suggest a single, late Pliocene or early Pleistocene migration of the North American S. verecunda lineage to South America, which was followed by dispersal and diversification of this tetraploid lineage in the Andes, other Argentinian mountain ranges and the Patagonian steppes. Later in the Pleistocene South American populations hybridized with the S. uralensis lineage, which led to allopolyploidisation and origin of decaploid S. chilensis and S. echegarayi occurring at high elevations. Additionally, we show that the morphological differentiation in leaf shape correlated with divergent habitats (high elevation Andes vs. lower elevation Patagonian steppes) is also supported phylogenetically, especially in the ITS tree. Lastly, the species boundaries among the narrow-leaved Patagonian steppe species are poorly resolved and need more thorough taxonomic revision.",The Distribution and Outcomes of the 21-Gene Recurrence Score in T1-T2N0 Estrogen Receptor-Positive Breast Cancer With Different Histologic Subtypes.,https://www.ncbi.nlm.nih.gov/pubmed/30619463,Frontiers in genetics,2019 01 10,"Background: The clinical value of 21-gene recurrence score (RS) in various breast cancer histologic subtypes is not well established. Aims: To assess the distribution and outcomes of the 21-gene RS among various T1-T2N0 estrogen receptor-positive breast cancer histologic subtypes. Methods: Using the Surveillance, Epidemiology and End Results database, we investigated the distribution and outcomes of the 21-gene RS among various breast cancer histologic subtypes between 2004 and 2015. The histologic subtypes with 200 or more cases were further analyzed. Results: We identified 83,665 patients including eight histologic subtypes. The most common subtype was invasive ductal carcinoma not otherwise specified (IDC NOS) (77.9%), followed by lobular carcinoma NOS, mixed infiltrating duct and lobular carcinoma (IDC-L), mucinous adenocarcinoma, tubular adenocarcinoma, micropapillary ductal carcinoma, cribriform carcinoma NOS, and intraductal papillary adenocarcinoma with invasion with 10.8, 7.7, 2.1, 0.6, 0.3, 0.2, and 0.2%, respectively. The 5-years breast cancer specific survival (BCSS) was 98.8, 98.8, 98.9, 99.6, 100, 100, 100, and 100%, respectively (P = 0.011). Patients with IDC NOS (8.9%), micropapillary ductal carcinoma (8.8%), and intraductal papillary adenocarcinoma with invasion (8.2%) had significantly higher percentage of high-risk RS compared to other histologic subtypes (1.0-3.8%) (P < 0.001). The mean RS was higher in IDC NOS, lobular carcinoma NOS, and IDC-L compared to other subtypes. In multivariate analysis, 21-gene RS was the independent prognostic factor in patients with IDC NOS (P < 0.001), lobular carcinoma NOS (P < 0.001), and IDC-L (P < 0.001), patients with a higher RS was associated with poor BCSS. Conclusion: Our results demonstrate that there is a significant difference in distribution of 21-gene RS in T1-T2N0 estrogen receptor-positive breast cancer with different histologic subtypes. Long-term studies with larger series are needed to confirm the role of the 21-gene RS array in prognosis assessment and chemotherapy decision-making in special histologic subtypes with favorable prognosis."

In the earlier stages of cancer, cells may indeed display a series of molecular alterations that allow them to proliferate faster, eventually occupying discrete tissue regions with irrelevant morphological anomalies. This behaviour recalls cell competition, a process based on a reciprocal fitness comparison: when cells with a growth advantage arise in a tissue, they are able to commit wild-type neighbours to death and to proliferate at their expense. It is known that cells expressing high MYC levels behave as super-competitors, able to kill and replace less performant adjacent cells; given MYC upregulation in most human cancers, MYC-mediated cell competition is likely to pioneer field cancerisation. Here we show that MYC overexpression in a sub-territory of the larval wing epithelium of Drosophila is sufficient to trigger a number of cellular responses specific to mammalian pre-malignant tissues. Moreover, following induction of different second mutations, high MYC-expressing epithelia were found to be susceptible to multifocal growth, a hallmark of mammalian pre-cancerous fields. In summary, our study identified an early molecular alteration implicated in field cancerisation and established a genetically amenable model which may help study the molecular basis of early carcinogenesis.",Where to Cross Over? Defining Crossover Sites in Plants.,https://www.ncbi.nlm.nih.gov/pubmed/30619450,Frontiers in genetics,2019 01 10,"It is believed that recombination in meiosis serves to reshuffle genetic material from both parents to increase genetic variation in the progeny. At the same time, the number of crossovers is usually kept at a very low level. As a consequence, many organisms need to make the best possible use from the one or two crossovers that occur per chromosome in meiosis. From this perspective, the decision of where to allocate rare crossover events becomes an important issue, especially in self-pollinating plant species, which experience limited variation due to inbreeding. However, the freedom in crossover allocation is significantly limited by other, genetic and non-genetic factors, including chromatin structure. Here we summarize recent progress in our understanding of those processes with a special emphasis on plant genomes. First, we focus on factors which influence the distribution of recombination initiation sites and discuss their effects at both, the single hotspot level and at the chromosome scale. We also briefly explain the aspects of hotspot evolution and their regulation. Next, we analyze how recombination initiation sites translate into the development of crossovers and their location. Moreover, we provide an overview of the sequence polymorphism impact on crossover formation and chromosomal distribution.",Signatures of Selection in Admixed Dairy Cattle in Tanzania.,https://www.ncbi.nlm.nih.gov/pubmed/30619449,Frontiers in genetics,2019 01 10,"Multiple studies have investigated selection signatures in domestic cattle and other species. However, there is a dearth of information about the response to selection in genomes of highly admixed crossbred cattle in relation to production and adaptation to tropical environments. In this study, we evaluated 839 admixed crossbred cows sampled from two major dairy regions in Tanzania namely Rungwe and Lushoto districts, in order to understand their genetic architecture and detect genomic regions showing preferential selection. Animals were genotyped at 150,000 SNP loci using the Geneseek Genomic Profiler (GGP) High Density (HD) SNP array. Population structure analysis showed a large within-population genetic diversity in the study animals with a high degree of variation in admixture ranging between 7 and 100% taurine genes (dairyness) of mostly Holstein and Friesian ancestry. We explored evidence of selection signatures using three statistical methods (iHS, XP-EHH, and pcadapt). Selection signature analysis identified 108 candidate selection regions in the study population. Annotation of these regions yielded interesting genes potentially under strong positive selection including ABCG2, ABCC2, XKR4, LYN, TGS1, TOX, HERC6, KIT, PLAG1, CHCHD7, NCAPG, and LCORL that are involved in multiple biological pathways underlying production and adaptation processes. Several candidate selection regions showed an excess of African taurine ancestral allele dosage. Our results provide further useful insight into potential selective sweeps in the genome of admixed cattle with possible adaptive and productive importance. Further investigations will be necessary to better characterize these candidate regions with respect to their functional significance to tropical adaptations for dairy cattle.",Absence of AGG Interruptions Is a Risk Factor for Full Mutation Expansion Among Israeli FMR1 Premutation Carriers.,https://www.ncbi.nlm.nih.gov/pubmed/30619448,Frontiers in genetics,2019 01 10,"Introduction: Fragile X syndrome (FXS) is a common form of X-linked intellectual and developmental disability with a prevalence of 1/4000-5000 in males and 1/6000-8000 in females. Most cases of the syndrome result from expansion of a premutation (55-200 CGGs) to a full mutation (>200 CGGs) repeat located in the 5' untranslated region of the fragile X mental retardation (FMR1) gene. The risk for full mutation expansions increases dramatically with increasing numbers of CGG repeats. Recent studies, however, revealed AGG interruptions within the repeat area function as a ""protective factor"" decreasing the risk of intergenerational expansion. Materials and Methods: This study was conducted to validate the relevance of AGG analysis for the ethnically diverse Israeli population. To increase the accuracy of our results, we combined results from Israel with those from the New York State Institute for Basic Research in Developmental Disabilities (IBR). To the best of our knowledge this is the largest cohort of different ethnicities to examine risks of unstable transmissions and full mutation expansions among FMR1 premutation carriers. Results: The combined data included 1471 transmissions of maternal premutation alleles: 369 (25.1%) stable and 1,102 (74.9%) unstable transmissions. Full mutation expansions were identified in 20.6% (303/1471) of transmissions. A total of 97.4% (388/397) of transmissions from alleles with no AGGs were unstable, 79.6% (513/644) in alleles with 1 AGG and 46.7% (201/430) in alleles with 2 or more AGGs. The same trend was seen with full mutation expansions where 40% (159/397) of alleles with no AGGs expanded to a full mutation, 20.2% (130/644) for alleles with 1 AGG and only 3.2% (14/430) in alleles with 2 AGGs or more. None of the alleles with 3 or more AGGs expanded to full mutations. Conclusion: We recommend that risk estimates for FMR1 premutation carriers be based on AGG interruptions as well as repeat size in Israel and worldwide.",Integrating Selection Mapping With Genetic Mapping and Functional Genomics.,https://www.ncbi.nlm.nih.gov/pubmed/30619447,Frontiers in genetics,2019 01 10,"Genomic scans for signatures of selection allow us to, in principle, detect variants and genes that underlie recent adaptations. By combining selection mapping with genetic mapping of traits known to be relevant to adaptation, we can simultaneously investigate whether genes and variants show signals of recent selection and whether they impact traits that have likely been selected. There are three ways to integrate selection mapping with genetic mapping or functional genomics: (1) To use genetic mapping data from other populations as a form of genome annotation. (2) To perform experimental evolution or artificial selection to be able to study selected variants when they segregate, either by performing genetic mapping before selection or by crossing the selected individuals to some reference population. (3) To perform a comparative study of related populations facing different selection regimes. This short review discusses these different ways of integrating selection mapping with genetic mapping and functional genomics, with examples of how each has been done.",Infantile Neuroaxonal Dystrophy: Diagnosis and Possible Treatments.,https://www.ncbi.nlm.nih.gov/pubmed/30619446,Frontiers in genetics,2019 01 10,"Infantile Neuroaxonal Dystrophy (INAD) is a rare neurodegenerative disease that often cuts short the life span of a child to 10 years. With a typical onset at 6 months of age, INAD is characterized by regression of acquired motor skills, delayed motor coordination and eventual loss of voluntary muscle control. Biallelic mutations in the PLA2G6 gene have been identified as the most frequent cause of INAD. We highlight the salient features of INAD molecular pathology and the progress made in molecular diagnostics. We reiterate that enhanced molecular diagnostic methodologies such as targeted gene panel testing, exome sequencing, and whole genome sequencing can help ascertain a molecular diagnosis. We describe how the defective catalytic activity of the PLA2G6 gene could be potentially overcome by enzyme replacement or gene correction, giving examples and challenges specific to INAD. This is expected to encourage steps toward developing and testing emerging therapies that might alleviate INAD progression and help realize objectives of patient formed organizations such as the INADcure Foundation.","Temporal Integrative Analysis of mRNA and microRNAs Expression Profiles and Epigenetic Alterations in Female SAMP8, a Model of Age-Related Cognitive Decline.",https://www.ncbi.nlm.nih.gov/pubmed/30619445,Frontiers in genetics,2019 01 10,"A growing body of research shows that epigenetic mechanisms are critically involved in normal and pathological aging. The Senescence-Accelerated Mouse Prone 8 (SAMP8) can be considered a useful tool to better understand the dynamics of the global epigenetic landscape during the aging process since its phenotype is not fully explained by genetic factors. Here we investigated dysfunctional age-related transcriptional profiles and epigenetic programming enzymes in the hippocampus of 2- and 9-month-old SAMP8 female mice using the Senescent-Accelerated Resistant 1 (SAMR1) mouse strain as control. SAMP8 mice presented 1,062 genes dysregulated at 2 months of age, and 1,033 genes at 9 months, with 92 genes concurrently dysregulated at both ages compared to age-matched SAMR1. SAMP8 mice showed a significant decrease in global DNA methylation (5-mC) at 2 months while hydroxymethylation (5-hmC) levels were increased in SAMP8 mice at 2 and 9 months of age compared to SAMR1. These changes were accompanied by changes in the expression of several enzymes that regulate 5-mC and methylcytosine oxidation. Acetylated H3 and H4 histone levels were significantly diminished in SAMP8 mice at 2-month-old compared to SAMR1 and altered Histone DeACetylase (HDACs) profiles were detected in both young and old SAMP8 mice. We analyzed 84 different mouse miRNAs known to be altered in neurological diseases or involved in neuronal development. Compared with SAMR1, SAMP8 mice showed 28 and 17 miRNAs differentially expressed at 2 and 9 months of age, respectively; 6 of these miRNAs overlapped at both ages. We used several bioinformatic approaches to integrate our data in mRNA:miRNA regulatory networks and functional predictions for young and aged animals. In sum, our study reveals interplay between epigenetic mechanisms and gene networks that seems to be relevant for the progression toward a pathological aging and provides several potential markers and therapeutic candidates for Alzheimer's Disease (AD) and age-related cognitive impairment.",Expanded Somatic Mutation Spectrum of MED12 Gene in Uterine Leiomyomas of Saudi Arabian Women.,https://www.ncbi.nlm.nih.gov/pubmed/30619444,Frontiers in genetics,2019 01 10,"MED12, a subunit of mediator complex genes is known to harbor genetic mutations, (mostly in exon 2), causal to the genesis of uterine leiomyomas among Caucasian, African American, and Asian women. However, the precise relationship between genetic mutations vs. protein or disease phenotype is not well-explained. Therefore, we sought to replicate the MED12 mutation frequency in leiomyomas of Saudi Arabian women, who represents ethnically and culturally distinct population. We performed molecular screening of MED12 gene (in 308 chromosomes belonging to 154 uterine biopsies), analyzed the genotype-disease phenotype correlations and determined the biophysical characteristics of mutated protein through diverse computational approaches. We discovered that >44% (34/77) leiomyomas of Arab women carry a spectrum of MED12 mutations (30 missense, 1 splice site, and 3 indels). In addition to known codon 44, we observed novel somatic mutations in codons 36, 38, and 55. Most genetically mutated tumors (27/30; 90%) demonstrated only one type of genetic change, highlighting that even single allele change in MED12 can have profound impact in transforming the normal uterine myometrium to leiomyomas. An interesting inverse correlation between tumor size and LH is observed when tumor is positive to MED12 mutation (p < 0.05). Our computational investigations suggest that amino acid substitution mutations in exon-2 region of MED12 might contribute to potential alterations in phenotype as well as the stability of MED12 protein. Our study, being the first one from Arab world, confirms the previous findings that somatic MED12 mutations are critical to development and progression of uterine leiomyomas irrespective of the ethnic background. We recommend that mutation screening, particularly codon 44 of MED12 can assist in molecular diagnostics of uterine leiomyomas in majority of the patients.",Rodent-Mediated Seed Dispersal Shapes Species Composition and Recruitment Dynamics in Ecotones.,https://www.ncbi.nlm.nih.gov/pubmed/30619443,Frontiers in plant science,2019 01 10,"Ecotones are considered unique environments, and the concepts of edge effects and ecotonal species have been applied widely. Our understanding of the mechanisms that underlie population and community responses to edge effects has been advanced by recent studies. However, little evidence exists to support an increased density and species richness in ecotones regarding rodent-mediated seed dispersal in response to edge plots between communities. Pinus armandii and Quercus variabilis communities are typical of the Qinling Mountains, China. To elucidate what shapes tree species composition and recruitment dynamics in ecotones, we compared the differences in secondary and tertiary seed dispersal as well as predation in pine and oak by scatter-hoarding rodents as well as the regeneration characteristics of both species in their ecotones with different plots (i.e., 5-8, 15-18, and 27-30 m widths) in the eastern Qinling Mountains. We found that the seeds of pine and oak were removed rapidly, with no differences in the seed removal rates in their ecotones with different plots. Moreover, 13.0 and 36.0% of the scatter hoards of pine and oak, respectively, were established by small rodents in ecotones with a width of 5-8 m, and 3.67 and 7.33% in ecotones with a width of 27-30 m. The seedling densities of pine and oak were significantly higher in ecotones at widths of 5-8 m compared with widths of 15-18 and 27-30 m. According to the seed dispersal and seedling recruitment patterns of pine and oak, the disproportionate abundance of seedlings in ecotones may be due at least partly to patterns of seed caching by rodents.","Infestation by Myzus persicae Increases Susceptibility of Brassica napus cv. ""Canard"" to Rhizoctonia solani AG 2-1.",https://www.ncbi.nlm.nih.gov/pubmed/30619441,Frontiers in plant science,2019 01 10,"Activation of plant defense pathways can be influenced by the presence of different species of attacking organisms. Understanding the complicated interactions triggering plant defense mechanisms is of great interest as it may allow the development of more effective and sustainable disease control methods. Myzus persicae and Rhizoctonia solani anastomosis group (AG) 2-1 are two important organisms attacking oilseed rape (OSR), causing disease and reduced yields. At present, is unclear how these two interact with each other and with OSR defenses and therefore the aim of the present study was to gain a better insight into the indirect interaction between aphids and pathogen. In separate experiments, we assessed the effect of AG 2-1 infection on aphid performance, measured as growth rate and population increase and then the effect of aphid infestation on AG 2-1 by quantifying disease and the amount of fungal DNA in plant stems and compost for two OSR varieties, ""Canard"" and ""Temple."" Additionally, we examined the expression of genes related to jasmonic acid (JA) and salicylic acid (SA) defense pathways. There was no significant effect of AG 2-1 infection on M. persicae performance. However, aphid infestation in one of the varieties, ""Canard,"" resulted in significantly increased disease symptoms caused by AG 2-1, although, the amount of fungal DNA was not significantly different between treatments. This meant that ""Canard"" plants had become more susceptible to the disease. Expression of LOX3 and MYC2 was elevated under AG 2-1 treatment but downregulated in plants with both aphids and pathogen. Therefore it seems plausible that alterations in the JA signaling due to aphid infestation resulted in the increased susceptibility to AG 2-1."

However, the suitability of herbarium samples for chemical analysis is largely unexplored as they are thought to be too degraded. The aim of this study was to explore terpenoid profiles across time and geographic space for four medicinal species of Salvia across the Mediterranean to assess the suitability of using herbarium specimens in chemical analyses. Herbarium samples of Salvia aethiopis, S. multicaulis, S. officinalis, and S. sclarea collected over 150 years across the Mediterranean were compared to modern samples using both targeted and untargeted gas chromatography-mass spectrometry analysis of terpene profiles. There was no effect of collection year on chemical composition, although the total concentration of the 20 assessed standards and two individual standards significantly decreased over time. Instead, chemical profiles were defined by species, with strong species effects identified on both the targeted and untargeted chemical composition. Geographic variation was a factor in regulating the untargeted chemical compositions, suggesting some underlying environmental effects. However, there was no effect of sample altitude on either the targeted or untargeted chemical compositions. Chemical composition of four Salvia species are predominantly defined by species, and there was a substantially smaller effect of year of sampling. Given these results herbarium collections may well represent a considerably underused resource for chemical analyses that can benefit biodiversity and other studies.",Environmentally Sensitive Molecular Switches Drive Poplar Phenology.,https://www.ncbi.nlm.nih.gov/pubmed/30619428,Frontiers in plant science,2019 01 10,"Boreal and temperate woody perennials are highly adapted to their local climate, which delimits the length of the growing period. Moreover, seasonal control of growth-dormancy cycles impacts tree productivity and geographical distribution. Therefore, traits related to phenology are of great interest to tree breeders and particularly relevant in the context of global warming. The recent application of transcriptional profiling and genetic association studies to poplar species has provided a robust molecular framework for investigating molecules with potential links to phenology. The environment dictates phenology by modulating the expression of endogenous molecular switches, the identities of which are currently under investigation. This review outlines the current knowledge of these molecular switches in poplar and covers several perspectives concerning the environmental control of growth-dormancy cycles. In the process, we highlight certain genetic pathways which are affected by short days, low temperatures and cold-induced signaling.",Jasmonate Zim-Domain Protein 9 Interacts With Slender Rice 1 to Mediate the Antagonistic Interaction Between Jasmonic and Gibberellic Acid Signals in Rice.,https://www.ncbi.nlm.nih.gov/pubmed/30619427,Frontiers in plant science,2019 01 10,"The jasmonic acid (JA) and gibberellic acid (GA) signaling pathways interact to coordinate stress responses and developmental processes. This coordination affects plant growth and yield, and is mediated by interactions between the repressors of each pathway, the JASMONATE ZIM-DOMAIN PROTEIN (JAZ) and DELLA proteins. In this study we attempted to identify rice (Oryza sativa) JAZs that interact with rice DELLAs such as SLENDER RICE 1 (SLR1). Analysis of protein-protein interactions showed that OsJAZ8 and OsJAZ9 interact with SLR1; OsJAZ9 also interacted with the SLR1-LIKE (SLRL) protein SLRL2. Based on this broader interaction, we explored the function of OsJAZ9 in JA and GA responses by analyzing transcript levels of the JA-responsive gene OsbHLH148 and the GA-responsive gene OsPIL14 in OsJAZ9-overexpressing (OsJAZ9-Ox) and osjaz9 mutant plants. OsbHLH148 and OsPIL14 encode key transcription factors controlling JA and GA responses, respectively, and JA and GA antagonistically regulate their expression. In OsJAZ9-Ox, the expression of OsbHLH148 was downregulated and the expression of OsPIL14 was upregulated. By contrast, in osjaz9 mutants, the expression of OsbHLH148 was upregulated and the expression of OsPIL14 was downregulated. These observations indicated that OsJAZ9 regulates both JA and GA responses in rice, and this finding was supported by the opposite expression patterns of OsDREB1s, downstream targets of OsbHLH148 and OsPIL14, in the OsJAZ9-Ox and osjaz9 plants. Together, these findings indicate that OsJAZ9 suppresses JA responses and promotes GA responses in rice, and the protein-protein interaction between OsJAZ9 and SLR1 is involved in the antagonistic interplay between JA and GA.",Revisiting the Soybean GmNAC Superfamily.,https://www.ncbi.nlm.nih.gov/pubmed/30619426,Frontiers in plant science,2019 01 10,"The NAC (NAM, ATAF, and CUC) genes encode transcription factors involved with the control of plant morph-physiology and stress responses. The release of the last soybean (Glycine max) genome assembly (Wm82.a2.v1) raised the possibility that new NAC genes would be present in the soybean genome. Here, we interrogated the last version of the soybean genome against a conserved NAC domain structure. Our analysis identified 32 putative novel NAC genes, updating the superfamily to 180 gene members. We also organized the genes in 15 phylogenetic subfamilies, which showed a perfect correlation among sequence conservation, expression profile, and function of orthologous Arabidopsis thaliana genes and NAC soybean genes. To validate our in silico analyses, we monitored the stress-mediated gene expression profiles of eight new NAC-genes by qRT-PCR and monitored the GmNAC senescence-associated genes by RNA-seq. Among ER stress, osmotic stress and salicylic acid treatment, all the novel tested GmNAC genes responded to at least one type of stress, displaying a complex expression profile under different kinetics and extension of the response. Furthermore, we showed that 40% of the GmNACs were differentially regulated by natural leaf senescence, including eight (8) newly identified GmNACs. The developmental and stress-responsive expression profiles of the novel NAC genes fitted perfectly with their phylogenetic subfamily. Finally, we examined two uncharacterized senescence-associated proteins, GmNAC065 and GmNAC085, and a novel, previously unidentified, NAC protein, GmNAC177, and showed that they are nuclear localized, and except for GmNAC065, they display transactivation activity in yeast. Consistent with a role in leaf senescence, transient expression of GmNAC065 and GmNAC085 induces the appearance of hallmarks of leaf senescence, including chlorophyll loss, leaf yellowing, lipid peroxidation and accumulation of H2O2. GmNAC177 was clustered to an uncharacterized subfamily but in close proximity to the TIP subfamily. Accordingly, it was rapidly induced by ER stress and by salicylic acid under late kinetic response and promoted cell death in planta. Collectively, our data further substantiated the notion that the GmNAC genes display functional and expression profiles consistent with their phylogenetic relatedness and established a complete framework of the soybean NAC superfamily as a foundation for future analyses.","Waterlogging of Winter Crops at Early and Late Stages: Impacts on Leaf Physiology, Growth and Yield.",https://www.ncbi.nlm.nih.gov/pubmed/30619425,Frontiers in plant science,2019 01 10,"Waterlogging is expected to increase as a consequence of global climate change, constraining crop production in various parts of the world. This study assessed tolerance to 14-days of early- or late-stage waterlogging of the major winter crops wheat, barley, rapeseed and field pea. Aerenchyma formation in adventitious roots, leaf physiological parameters (net photosynthesis, stomatal and mesophyll conductances, chlorophyll fluorescence), shoot and root growth during and after waterlogging, and seed production were evaluated. Wheat produced adventitious roots with 20-22% of aerenchyma, photosynthesis was maintained during waterlogging, and seed production was 86 and 71% of controls for early- and late-waterlogging events. In barley and rapeseed, plants were less affected by early- than by late-waterlogging. Barley adventitious roots contained 19% aerenchyma, whereas rapeseed did not form aerenchyma. In barley, photosynthesis was reduced during early-waterlogging mainly by stomatal limitations, and by non-stomatal constraints (lower mesophyll conductance and damage to photosynthetic apparatus as revealed by chlorophyll fluorescence) during late-waterlogging. In rapeseed, photosynthesis was mostly reduced by non-stomatal limitations during early- and late-waterlogging, which also impacted shoot and root growth. Early-waterlogged plants of both barley and rapeseed were able to recover in growth upon drainage, and seed production reached ca. 79-85% of the controls, while late-waterlogged plants only attained 26-32% in seed production. Field pea showed no ability to develop root aerenchyma when waterlogged, and its photosynthesis (and stomatal and mesophyll conductances) was rapidly decreased by the stress. Consequently, waterlogging drastically reduced field pea seed production to 6% of controls both at early- and late-stages with plants being unable to resume growth upon drainage. In conclusion, wheat generates a set of adaptive responses to withstand 14 days of waterlogging, barley and rapeseed can still produce significant yield if transiently waterlogged during early plant stages but are more adversely impacted at the late stage, and field pea is not suitable for areas prone to waterlogging events of 14 days at either growth stage.",From in planta Function to Vitamin-Rich Food Crops: The ACE of Biofortification.,https://www.ncbi.nlm.nih.gov/pubmed/30619424,Frontiers in plant science,2019 01 10,"Humans are highly dependent on plants to reach their dietary requirements, as plant products contribute both to energy and essential nutrients. For many decades, plant breeders have been able to gradually increase yields of several staple crops, thereby alleviating nutritional needs with varying degrees of success. However, many staple crops such as rice, wheat and corn, although delivering sufficient calories, fail to satisfy micronutrient demands, causing the so called 'hidden hunger.' Biofortification, the process of augmenting nutritional quality of food through the use of agricultural methodologies, is a pivotal asset in the fight against micronutrient malnutrition, mainly due to vitamin and mineral deficiencies. Several technical advances have led to recent breakthroughs. Nutritional genomics has come to fruition based on marker-assisted breeding enabling rapid identification of micronutrient related quantitative trait loci (QTL) in the germplasm of interest. As a complement to these breeding techniques, metabolic engineering approaches, relying on a continuously growing fundamental knowledge of plant metabolism, are able to overcome some of the inevitable pitfalls of breeding. Alteration of micronutrient levels does also require fundamental knowledge about their role and influence on plant growth and development. This review focuses on our knowledge about provitamin A (beta-carotene), vitamin C (ascorbate) and the vitamin E group (tocochromanols). We begin by providing an overview of the functions of these vitamins in planta, followed by highlighting some of the achievements in the nutritional enhancement of food crops via conventional breeding and genetic modification, concluding with an evaluation of the need for such biofortification interventions. The review further elaborates on the vast potential of creating nutritionally enhanced crops through multi-pathway engineering and the synergistic potential of conventional breeding in combination with genetic engineering, including the impact of novel genome editing technologies.","Interaction and Regulation of Carbon, Nitrogen, and Phosphorus Metabolisms in Root Nodules of Legumes.",https://www.ncbi.nlm.nih.gov/pubmed/30619423,Frontiers in plant science,2019 01 10,"Members of the plant family Leguminosae (Fabaceae) are unique in that they have evolved a symbiotic relationship with rhizobia (a group of soil bacteria that can fix atmospheric nitrogen). Rhizobia infect and form root nodules on their specific host plants before differentiating into bacteroids, the symbiotic form of rhizobia. This complex relationship involves the supply of C4-dicarboxylate and phosphate by the host plants to the microsymbionts that utilize them in the energy-intensive process of fixing atmospheric nitrogen into ammonium, which is in turn made available to the host plants as a source of nitrogen, a macronutrient for growth. Although nitrogen-fixing bacteroids are no longer growing, they are metabolically active. The symbiotic process is complex and tightly regulated by both the host plants and the bacteroids. The metabolic pathways of carbon, nitrogen, and phosphate are heavily regulated in the host plants, as they need to strike a fine balance between satisfying their own needs as well as those of the microsymbionts. A network of transporters for the various metabolites are responsible for the trafficking of these essential molecules between the two partners through the symbiosome membrane (plant-derived membrane surrounding the bacteroid), and these are in turn regulated by various transcription factors that control their expressions under different environmental conditions. Understanding this complex process of symbiotic nitrogen fixation is vital in promoting sustainable agriculture and enhancing soil fertility.",Overexpression of PpSnRK1α in Tomato Promotes Fruit Ripening by Enhancing RIPENING INHIBITOR Regulation Pathway.,https://www.ncbi.nlm.nih.gov/pubmed/30619421,Frontiers in plant science,2019 01 10,"As a conserved kinase complex, sucrose non-fermenting-1-related protein kinase 1 (SnRK1) is a major regulator of plant growth and development. In our previous study, overexpression of MhSnRK1 in tomato (Solanum lycopersicum L.) modified fruit maturation: the transgenic fruit ripened earlier than the wild type (WT). However, the mechanism by which fruit maturation is regulated by SnRK1 is not clear; therefore, the test materials used were the transgenic tomato lines (OE-1, OE-3, and OE-4) overexpressing the coding gene of peach [Prunus persica (L.) Batsch] SNF1-related kinase α subunit (PpSnRK1α). The activity of SnRK1 kinase in transgenic tomato lines OE-1, OE-3, and OE-4 was higher than that in the WT at different periods of fruit development; in the pink coloring period the SnRK1 kinase activity increased the most, with 23.5, 28.8, and 21.4% increases, respectively. The content of starch and soluble sugars in red ripe transgenic fruit significantly increased, while the soluble protein and titratable acid content decreased significantly. We also found that the tomatoes overexpressing PpSnRK1α matured approximately 10 days earlier than the WT. Moreover, the yeast-two-hybrid assay showed that PpSnRK1α interacted with the MADS-box transcription factor (TF) SIRIN, which acts as an essential regulator of tomato fruit ripening. The BiFC technology further validated the location of the PpSnRK1α interaction sites within the nucleus. The quantitative real-time PCR analysis showed that RIN expression was up-regulated by PpSnRK1α overexpression; the expression of RIN-targeted TF genes NOR and FUL1 increased during different stages of fruit development. The expression of key genes, ACS2, ACS4, and E8, in ethylene synthesis also changed accordingly, and the ethylene emitted by the red ripe fruit increased by 36.1-43.9% compared with the WT. These results suggest that PpSnRK1α interacts with SIRIN, increasing the expression of RIN, thereby regulating the expression of downstream ripening-related genes, finally promoting fruit ripening.",A New Role For Green Leaf Volatile Esters in Tomato Stomatal Defense Against Pseudomonas syringe pv. tomato.,https://www.ncbi.nlm.nih.gov/pubmed/30619420,Frontiers in plant science,2019 01 10,"The volatile esters of (Z)-3-hexenol with acetic, propionic, isobutyric, or butyric acids are synthesized by alcohol acyltransferases (AAT) in plants. These compounds are differentially emitted when tomato plants are efficiently resisting an infection with Pseudomonas syringae pv. tomato. We have studied the defensive role of these green leaf volatile (GLV) esters in the tomato response to bacterial infection, by analyzing the induction of resistance mediated by these GLVs and the phenotype upon bacterial infection of tomato plants impaired in their biosynthesis. We observed that treatments of plants with (Z)-3-hexenyl propionate (HP) and, to a greater extent with (Z)-3-hexenyl butyrate (HB), resulted in stomatal closure, PR gene induction and enhanced resistance to the bacteria. HB-mediated stomatal closure was also effective in several plant species belonging to Nicotiana, Arabidopsis, Medicago, Zea and Citrus genus, and both stomatal closure and resistance were induced in HB-treated NahG tomato plants, which are deficient in salicylic acid (SA) accumulation. Transgenic antisense AAT1 tomato plants, which displayed a reduction of ester emissions upon bacterial infection in leaves, exhibited a lower ratio of stomatal closure and were hyper-susceptible to bacterial infection. Our results confirm the role of GLV esters in plant immunity, uncovering a SA-independent effect of HB in stomatal defense. Moreover, we identified HB as a natural stomatal closure compound with potential agricultural applications.","Identification, Molecular Cloning, and Functional Characterization of a Wheat UDP-Glucosyltransferase Involved in Resistance to Fusarium Head Blight and to Mycotoxin Accumulation.",https://www.ncbi.nlm.nih.gov/pubmed/30619419,Frontiers in plant science,2019 01 10,"Plant uridine diphosphate (UDP)-glucosyltransferases (UGT) catalyze the glucosylation of xenobiotic, endogenous substrates and phytotoxic agents produced by pathogens such as mycotoxins. The Bradi5g03300 UGT-encoding gene from the model plant Brachypodium distachyon was previously shown to confer tolerance to the mycotoxin deoxynivalenol (DON) through glucosylation into DON 3-O-glucose (D3G). This gene was shown to be involved in early establishment of quantitative resistance to Fusarium Head Blight, a major disease of small-grain cereals. In the present work, using a translational biology approach, we identified and characterized a wheat candidate gene, Traes_2BS_14CA35D5D, orthologous to Bradi5g03300 on the short arm of chromosome 2B of bread wheat (Triticum aestivum L.). We showed that this UGT-encoding gene was highly inducible upon infection by a DON-producing Fusarium graminearum strain while not induced upon infection by a strain unable to produce DON. Transformation of this wheat UGT-encoding gene into B. distachyon revealed its ability to confer FHB resistance and root tolerance to DON as well as to potentially conjugate DON into D3G in planta and its impact on total DON reduction. In conclusion, we provide a UGT-encoding candidate gene to include in selection process for FHB resistance."

In plant cells, vacuoles are regarded as the terminus of catabolic pathways whereas the selection and transport of vacuolar cargoes are mainly mediated by two types of organelles, multivesicular bodies (MVBs) also termed prevacuolar compartments (PVCs) and autophagosomes. MVBs are single-membrane bound organelles with intraluminal vesicles and mediate the transport between the trans-Golgi network (TGN) and vacuoles, while autophagosomes are double-membrane bound organelles, which mediate cargo delivery to the vacuole for degradation and recycling during autophagy. Great progress has been achieved recently in identification and characterization of the conserved and plant-unique regulators involved in the MVB and autophagosome pathways. In this review, we present an update on the current knowledge of these key regulators and pay special attention to their conserved protein domains. In addition, we discuss the possible interplay between the MVB and autophagosome pathways in regulating vacuolar degradation in plants.",Potential of UAV-Based Active Sensing for Monitoring Rice Leaf Nitrogen Status.,https://www.ncbi.nlm.nih.gov/pubmed/30619407,Frontiers in plant science,2019 01 10,"Unmanned aerial vehicle (UAV) based active canopy sensors can serve as a promising sensing solution for the estimation of crop nitrogen (N) status with great applicability and flexibility. This study was endeavored to determine the feasibility of UAV-based active sensing to monitor the leaf N status of rice (Oryza sativa L.) and to examine the transferability of handheld-based predictive models to UAV-based active sensing. In this 3-year multi-locational study, varied N-rates (0-405 kg N ha-1) field experiments were conducted using five rice varieties. Plant samples and sensing data were collected at critical growth stages for growth analysis and monitoring. The portable active canopy sensor RapidSCAN CS-45 with red, red edge, and near infrared wavebands was used in handheld mode and aerial mode on a gimbal under a multi-rotor UAV. The results showed the great potential of UAV-based active sensing for monitoring rice leaf N status. The vegetation index-based regression models were built and evaluated based on Akaike information criterion and independent validation to predict rice leaf dry matter, leaf area index, and leaf N accumulation. Vegetation indices composed of near-infrared and red edge bands (NDRE or RERVI) acquired at a 1.5 m aviation height had a good performance for the practical application. Future studies are needed on the proper operation mode and means for precision N management with this system.",Duplication and Diversification of REPLUMLESS - A Case Study in the Papaveraceae.,https://www.ncbi.nlm.nih.gov/pubmed/30619406,Frontiers in plant science,2019 01 10,"There is a vast amount of fruit morphological diversity in terms of their texture, the number of carpels, if those carpels are fused or not and how fruits open to disperse the seeds. Arabidopsis thaliana, a model eudicot, has a dry bicarpellate silique, when the fruit matures, the two valves fall apart through the dehiscence zone leaving the seeds attached to the remaining medial tissue, called the replum. Proper replum development in A. thaliana is mediated by REPLUMLESS (RPL), a TALE Homeodomain protein. RPL represses the valve margin genetic program and the downstream dehiscence zone formation in the medial tissue of the siliques and RPL orthologs have conserved roles across the Brassicaceae eudicots. A RPL homolog, qSH1, has been studied in rice, a monocot, and plays a role in fruit shedding making it difficult to predict functional evolution of this gene lineage across angiosperms. Although RPL orthologs have been identified across all angiosperms, expression and functional analyses are scarce. In order to fill the phylogenetic gap between the Brassicaceae and monocots we have characterized the expression patterns of RPL homologs in two poppies with different fruit types, Bocconia frutescens with operculate valvate dehiscence and a persistent medial tissue, similar to a replum, and Papaver somniferum, a poppy with persistent medial tissue in between the multicarpellate gynoecia. We found that RPL homologs in Papaveraceae have broad expression patterns during plant development; in the shoot apical meristem, during flowering transition and in many floral organs, especially the carpels. These patterns are similar to those of RPL in A. thaliana. However, our results suggest that RPL does not have conserved roles in the maintenance of medial persistent tissues of fruits but may be involved with establishing the putative dehiscence zone in dry poppy fruits.",Restoration of a Canopy-Forming Alga Based on Recruitment Enhancement: Methods and Long-Term Success Assessment.,https://www.ncbi.nlm.nih.gov/pubmed/30619405,Frontiers in plant science,2019 01 10,"Marine forests dominated by macroalgae have experienced noticeable regression along some temperate and subpolar rocky shores. Along continuously disturbed shores, where natural recovery is extremely difficult, these forests are often permanently replaced by less structured assemblages. Thus, implementation of an active restoration plan emerges as an option to ensure their conservation. To date, active transplantation of individuals from natural and healthy populations has been proposed as a prime vehicle for restoring habitat-forming species. However, given the threatened and critical conservation status of many populations, less invasive techniques are required. Some authors have experimentally explored the applicability of several non-destructive techniques based on recruitment enhancement for macroalgae restoration; however, these techniques have not been effectively applied to restore forest-forming fucoids. Here, for the first time, we successfully restored four populations of Cystoseira barbata (i.e., they established self-maintaining populations of roughly 25 m2) in areas from which they had completely disappeared at least 50 years ago using recruitment-enhancement techniques. We compared the feasibility and costs of active macroalgal restoration by means of in situ (wild-collected zygotes and recruits) and ex situ (provisioning of lab-cultured recruits) techniques. Mid/long-term monitoring of the restored and reference populations allowed us to define the best indicators of success for the different restoration phases. After 6 years, the densities and size structure distributions of the restored populations were similar and comparable to those of the natural reference populations. However, the costs of the in situ recruitment technique were considerably lower than those of the ex situ technique. The restoration method, monitoring and success indicators proposed here may have applicability for other macroalgal species, especially those that produce rapidly sinking zygotes. Recruitment enhancement should become an essential tool for preserving Cystoseira forests and their associated biodiversity.","Genetic-Based Susceptibility of a Foundation Tree to Herbivory Interacts With Climate to Influence Arthropod Community Composition, Diversity, and Resilience.",https://www.ncbi.nlm.nih.gov/pubmed/30619404,Frontiers in plant science,2019 01 10,"Understanding how genetic-based traits of plants interact with climate to affect associated communities will help improve predictions of climate change impacts on biodiversity. However, few community-level studies have addressed such interactions. Pinyon pine (Pinus edulis) in the southwestern U.S. shows genetic-based resistance and susceptibility to pinyon needle scale (Matsucoccus acalyptus). We sought to determine if susceptibility to scale herbivory influenced the diversity and composition of the extended community of 250+ arthropod species, and if this influence would be consistent across consecutive years, an extreme drought year followed by a moderate drought year. Because scale insects alter the architecture of susceptible trees, it is difficult to separate the direct influences of susceptibility on arthropod communities from the indirect influences of scale-altered tree architecture. To separate these influences, scales were experimentally excluded from susceptible trees for 15 years creating susceptible trees with the architecture of resistant trees, hereafter referred to as scale-excluded trees. Five patterns emerged. (1) In both years, arthropod abundance was 3-4X lower on susceptible trees compared to resistant and scale-excluded trees. (2) Species accumulation curves show that alpha and gamma diversity were 2-3X lower on susceptible trees compared to resistant and scale-excluded trees. (3) Reaction norms of arthropod richness and abundance on individual tree genotypes across years showed genotypic variation in the community response to changes in climate. (4) The genetic-based influence of susceptibility on arthropod community composition is climate dependent. During extreme drought, community composition on scale-excluded trees resembled susceptible trees indicating composition was strongly influenced by tree genetics independent of tree architecture. However, under moderate drought, community composition on scale-excluded trees resembled resistant trees indicating traits associated with tree architecture became more important. (5) One year after extreme drought, the arthropod community rebounded sharply. However, there was a much greater rebound in richness and abundance on resistant compared to susceptible trees suggesting that reduced resiliency in the arthropod community is associated with susceptibility. These results argue that individual genetic-based plant-herbivore interactions can directly and indirectly impact community-level diversity, which is modulated by climate. Understanding such interactions is important for assessing the impacts of climate change on biodiversity.",Knock-Down of the Phosphoserine Phosphatase Gene Effects Rather N- Than S-Metabolism in Arabidopsis thaliana.,https://www.ncbi.nlm.nih.gov/pubmed/30619403,Frontiers in plant science,2019 04 03,"The aim of present study was to elucidate the significance of the phosphorylated pathway of Ser production for Cys biosynthesis in leaves at day and night and upon cadmium (Cd) exposure. For this purpose, Arabidopsis wildtype plants as control and its psp mutant knocked-down in phosphoserine phosphatase (PSP) were used to test if (i) photorespiratory Ser is the dominant precursor of Cys synthesis in autotrophic tissue in the light, (ii) the phosphorylated pathway of Ser production can take over Ser biosynthesis in leaves at night, and (iii) Cd exposure stimulates Cys and glutathione (GSH) biosynthesis and effects the crosstalk of S and N metabolism, irrespective of the Ser source. Glycine (Gly) and Ser contents were not affected by reduction of the psp transcript level confirming that the photorespiratory pathway is the main route of Ser synthesis. The reduction of the PSP transcript level in the mutant did not affect day/night regulation of sulfur fluxes while day/night fluctuation of sulfur metabolite amounts were no longer observed, presumably due to slower turnover of sulfur metabolites in the mutant. Enhanced contents of non-protein thiols in both genotypes and of GSH only in the psp mutant were observed upon Cd treatment. Mutation of the phosphorylated pathway of Ser biosynthesis caused an accumulation of alanine, aspartate, lysine and a decrease of branched-chain amino acids. Knock-down of the PSP gene induced additional defense mechanisms against Cd toxicity that differ from those of WT plants.",Genetic Diversity and Resistance to Fusarium Head Blight in Synthetic Hexaploid Wheat Derived From Aegilops tauschii and Diverse Triticum turgidum Subspecies.,https://www.ncbi.nlm.nih.gov/pubmed/30619402,Frontiers in plant science,2019 01 10,"Synthetic hexaploid wheat (SHW) can serve as a bridge for the transfer of useful genes from Aegilops tauschii and tetraploid wheat (Triticum turgidum) into common wheat (T. aestivum). The objective of this study was to evaluate 149 SHW lines and their 74 tetraploid parents for their genetic diversity, breeding values and inter-genomic interactions for resistance to Fusarium head blight (FHB). The genetic diversity analysis was performed based on the population structure established using 4,674 and 3,330 polymorphic SNP markers among the SHW lines and tetraploid parents, respectively. The results showed that all T. carthlicum and most T. dicoccum accessions formed different clusters and subpopulations, respectively, whereas all the T. durum, T. polonicum, T. turgidum, and T. turanicum accessions were clustered together, suggesting that T. durum was more closely related to T. polonicum, T. turgidum, and T. turanicum than to T. dicoccum. The genetic diversity of the SHW lines mainly reflected that of the tetraploid parents. The SHW lines and their tetraploid parents were evaluated for reactions to FHB in two greenhouse seasons and at two field nurseries for 2 years. As expected, most of the SHW lines were more resistant than their tetraploid parents in all environments. The FHB severities of the SHW lines varied greatly depending on the Ae. tauschii and tetraploid genotypes involved. Most of the SHW lines with a high level of FHB resistance were generally derived from the tetraploid accessions with a high level of FHB resistance. Among the 149 SHW lines, 140 were developed by using three Ae. tauschii accessions CIae 26, PI 268210, and RL 5286. These SHW lines showed FHB severities reduced by 21.7%, 17.3%, and 11.5%, respectively, with an average reduction of 18.3%, as compared to the tetraploid parents, suggesting that the D genome may play a major role in reducing disease severity in the SHW lines. Thirteen SHW lines consistently showed a high level of FHB resistance compared to the resistant check, Sumai 3, in each environment. These SHW lines will be useful for the development of FHB-resistant wheat germplasm and populations for discovery of novel FHB resistance genes.",Sequence-Specific Detection of Aristolochia DNA - A Simple Test for Contamination of Herbal Products.,https://www.ncbi.nlm.nih.gov/pubmed/30619401,Frontiers in plant science,2019 01 10,"Herbal medicines are used globally for their health benefits as an alternative therapy method to modern medicines. The market for herbal products has increased rapidly over the last few decades, but this has in turn increased the opportunities for malpractices such as contamination or substitution of products with alternative plant species. In the 1990s, a series of severe renal disease cases were reported in Belgium associated with weight loss treatment, in which the active species Stephania tetrandra was found to be substituted with Aristolochia fangchi. A. fangchi contains toxic aristolochic acids, which have been linked to kidney failure, as well as cancers of the urinary tract. Because of these known toxicities, herbal medicines containing these compounds, or potentially contaminated by these plants, have been restricted or banned in some countries, but they are still available via the internet and in alternate formulations. In this study, a DNA based method based on quantitative real-time PCR (qPCR) was tested to detect and distinguish Aristolochia subg. Siphisia (Duch.) O.C.Schmidt species from a range of medicinal plants that could potentially be contaminated with Aristolochia material. Specific primers were designed to confirm that Aristolochia subg. Siphisia can be detected, even in small amounts, if it is present in the products, fulfilling the aim of offering a simple, cheaper and faster solution than the chemical methods. A synthetic gBlock template containing the primer sequences was used as a reference standard to calibrate the qPCR assay and to estimate the copy number of a target gene per sample. Generic primers covering the conserved 5.8S rRNA coding region were used as internal control to verify DNA quality and also as a reference gene for relative quantitation. To cope with potentially degraded DNA, all qPCR primer sets were designed to generate PCR products of under 100 bp allowing detection and quantification of A. fangchi gBlock even when mixed with S. tetrandra gBlock in different ratios. All proportions of Aristolochia, from 100 to 2%, were detected. Using standards, associating the copy number to each start quantity, the detection limit was calculated and set to about 50 copies.",Loss-of-Function Alleles of Heading date 1 (Hd1) Are Associated With Adaptation of Temperate Japonica Rice Plants to the Tropical Region.,https://www.ncbi.nlm.nih.gov/pubmed/30619400,Frontiers in plant science,2019 01 10,"Adaptation of temperate japonica rice varieties to tropical regions is impeded by extremely early flowering probably due to photoperiod change from long to short. However, constant breeding efforts led to development of temperate japonica varieties adapted to tropical/subtropical regions, but the genetic factor underlying this is still elusive. We analyzed the 45 diverse rice accessions and 12 tropical-adapted temperate japonica lines for the allele types of seven major flowering genes Hd1, OsPPR37, DTH8, Ghd7, Ehd1, RFT1, and Hd3a and flowering time under three different field conditions in temperate and tropical locations. The accessions originated from the tropical/subtropical regions preferred the non-functional alleles of Hd1 and not other flowering genes. The genetic effect analysis of each gene showed that only the functional Hd1 caused early flowering in the tropical location. All 12 temperate japonica breeding lines adapted to the tropics possessed the loss-of-function alleles of Hd1 with no change of other flowering genes compared to common Korean temperate japonica varieties. A phylogenetic analysis using 2,918 SNP data points revealed that the genome status of the 12 breeding lines were very similar to Korean temperate japonica varieties. These results indicate that the functional Hd1 alleles of temperate japonica varieties induced extremely early flowering in the tropics and the non-functional hd1 alleles brought about the adaptation of temperate japonica rice to tropical regions.",Grape VOCs Response to Postharvest Short-Term Ozone Treatments.,https://www.ncbi.nlm.nih.gov/pubmed/30619399,Frontiers in plant science,2019 01 10,"Ozone has been recently recognized as an efficient sanitizing agent in wine industry because of its powerful oxidizing properties. Furthermore, postharvest treatments of grapes with ozone can stimulate defense responses by synthetizing secondary metabolites against oxidative stress. In this study, the effect of postharvest short-term ozone treatments was assessed for the first time on free and glycosylated volatile organic compounds (VOCs) of winegrapes. Two different ozone concentrations (30 and 60 μL/L) and exposure times (24 and 48 h) were investigated just after treatment (fresh grapes) and after partial dehydration up to 20% weight loss (withered grapes). The study was carried out on Moscato bianco winegrapes (Vitis vinifera L.) due to the importance of terpenes in white aromatic cultivars to produce high quality wines. The results obtained showed that short-term ozone treatment caused a significant decrease in total contents of free VOCs in fresh grapes, mainly due to terpenes. Among them, linalool, geraniol, and nerol are the major aromatic markers of Moscato bianco grapes. Ozone entailed a significant decrease of free linalool contents in fresh grapes, the less stressful ozone treatment showing the smaller linalool degradation. However, the stronger and longer ozone treatment induced the synthesis of this compound probably in response to higher abiotic stress. Instead, significant changes were not observed in geraniol and nerol contents in fresh grapes. This last ozone treatment also reduced the loss of free linalool by water loss in withered grapes even though total VOCs and terpenes remained relatively stable. Furthermore, ozone seems to promote the synthesis of free (+)-4-carene and 4-terpineol in withered grapes under certain treatment conditions. Regarding glycosylated compounds, total VOCs and terpenes were less sensitive to ozone. Our findings highlight that ozone can be used as sanitizing agent in aromatic grape varieties prior to winemaking without affecting sharply the aromatic profile of fresh grapes and even improving it in withered grapes."

Sorbus is an example of a genus where active diversification and speciation are ongoing and, as such, represents an ideal model to investigate the roles of hybridization, polyploidy and apomixis in a reticulate evolutionary process. To elucidate breeding systems and evolutionary origins of a complex of closely related Sorbus taxa, we assessed genotypic diversity and population structure within and among taxa, combining data from nuclear DNA microsatellite markers and flow cytometry. Clonal analysis and low genotypic diversity within the polyploid taxa suggest apomixis is obligate. However, genetic variation has led to groups of 'clone-mates' within apomictic taxa that strongly suggest mutation is responsible for the genotypic diversity of these apomictic lineages. In addition, microsatellite profiles and site demographics suggest hybridization events among apomictic polyploid Sorbus may have contributed to the extant diversity of recognized taxa in this region. This research demonstrates that both macro- and micro-evolutionary processes are active within this reticulate Sorbus complex. Conservation measures should be aimed at maintaining this process and should therefore be prioritized for those areas of Sorbus species richness where the potential for interspecific gene flow is greatest.",Acibenzolar-S-Methyl Reprograms Apple Transcriptome Toward Resistance to Rosy Apple Aphid.,https://www.ncbi.nlm.nih.gov/pubmed/30619387,Frontiers in plant science,2019 01 10,"Acibenzolar-S-methyl (ASM) is a chemical compound, which is able to induce resistance in several model and non-model plants, but the end-players of this induced defense remain ill-defined. Here, we test the hypothesis that treatment with ASM can protect apple (Malus × domestica) against the rosy apple aphid (Dysaphis plantaginea) and investigate the defense molecules potentially involved in resistance. We measured aphid life traits and performed behavioral assays to study the effect of ASM on plant resistance against the aphid, and then combined transcriptomic, bioinformatics, metabolic and biochemical analyses to identify the plant compounds involved in resistance. Plants treated with ASM negatively affected several life traits of the aphid and modified its feeding and host seeking behaviors. ASM treatment elicited up-regulation of terpene synthase genes in apple and led to the emission of (E,E)-α-farnesene, a sesquiterpene that was repellent to the aphid. Several genes encoding amaranthin-like lectins were also strongly up-regulated upon treatment and the corresponding proteins accumulated in leaves, petioles and stems. Our results link the production of specific apple proteins and metabolites to the antibiosis and antixenosis effects observed against Dysaphis plantaginea, providing insight into the mechanisms underlying ASM-induced herbivore resistance.",Productivity and Quality of Alpine Grassland Vary With Soil Water Availability Under Experimental Warming.,https://www.ncbi.nlm.nih.gov/pubmed/30619386,Frontiers in plant science,2019 01 10,"The plant productivity of alpine meadow is predicted to generally increase under a warming climate, but it remains unclear whether the positive response rates will vary with soil water availability. Without consideration of the response of community composition and plant quality, livestock grazing under the current stocking rate might still lead to grassland degradation, even in meadows with high plant biomass. We have conducted a warming experiment from 2010 to 2017 to examine the interactive effects of warming and soil water availability on plant growth and forage quality at individual and functional group levels in an alpine meadow located in the permafrost region of the Qinghai-Tibetan Plateau. Warming-induced changes in community composition, biomass, and forage quality varied with soil water availability. Under dry conditions, experimental warming reduced the relative importance of grasses and the aboveground biomass by 32.37 g m-2 but increased the importance value of forbs. It also increased the crude fat by 0.68% and the crude protein by 3.19% at the end of summer but decreased the acid detergent fiber by 5.59% at the end of spring. The increase in crude fat and protein and the decrease in acid detergent fiber, but the decrease in aboveground biomass and increase the importance value of forbs, which may imply a deterioration of the grassland. Under wet conditions, warming increased aboveground biomass by 29.49 g m-2 at the end of spring and reduced acid detergent fiber by 8.09% at the end of summer. The importance value of grasses and forbs positively correlated with the acid detergent fiber and crude protein, respectively. Our results suggest that precipitation changes will determine whether climate warming will benefit rangelands on the Qinghai-Tibetan Plateau, with drier conditions suppressing grassland productivity, but wetter conditions increasing production while preserving forage quality.",Genome-Wide Analysis of Sorghum GT47 Family Reveals Functional Divergences of MUR3-Like Genes.,https://www.ncbi.nlm.nih.gov/pubmed/30619385,Frontiers in plant science,2019 01 10,"Sorghum (Sorghum bicolor) is an important bioenergy crop. Its biomass mainly consists of the cellulosic and non-cellulosic polysaccharides, both which can be converted to biofuels. The biosynthesis of non-cellulosic polysaccharides involves several glycosyltransferases (GT) families including GT47. However, there was no systemic study on GT47 family in sorghum to date. Here, we identified 39 sorghum GT47 family members and showed the functional divergences of MURUS3 (MUR3) homologs. Sorghum GT47 proteins were phylogenetically clustered into four distinct subfamilies. Within each subfamily, gene structure was relatively conserved between the members. Ten gene pairs were identified from the 39 GT47 genes, of which two pairs might be originated from tandem duplication. 25.6% (10/39) of sorghum GT47 genes were homologous to Arabidopsis MUR3, a xyloglucan biosynthesis gene in primary cell walls. SbGT47_2, SbGT47_7, and SbGT47_8, three most homologous genes of MUR3, exhibited different tissue expression patterns and were selected for complementation into Arabidopsis mur3-3. Physiological and cell wall analyses showed that SbGT47_2 and SbGT47_7 may be two functional xyloglucan galactosyltransferases in sorghum. Further studies found that MUR3-like genes are widely present in the seed plants but not in the chlorophytic alga Chlamydomonas reinhardtii. Our results provide novel information for evolutionary analysis and functional dissection of sorghum GT47 family members.","Effects of Salinity on Tagetes Growth, Physiology, and Shelf Life of Edible Flowers Stored in Passive Modified Atmosphere Packaging or Treated With Ethanol.",https://www.ncbi.nlm.nih.gov/pubmed/30619383,Frontiers in plant science,2019 01 10,"Irrigation with saline water causes significant crop yield loss. However, short-term saline application might cause less negative effects on yield yet at the same time improve quality aspects of edible products. Tagetes (Tagetes patula L.) plants were subjected to salinity (0, 50, and 100 mM NaCl) and harvested flowers were stored up to 14 days in passive modified atmosphere packaging (with or without ethanol application). Salinity of 100 mM NaCl decreased plant biomass and plant size (i.e., height) and had a negative effect on physiological processes such as stomatal closure and chlorophylls content decrease. Salinity increased flower polyphenols, antioxidant activities, and total carotenoids but decreased anthocyanins, and greater impacts were found at salinity of 100 mM NaCl, providing higher antioxidant value of the edible flowers. Short-term saline exposure of tagetes plants activated metabolic processes and as a result there was an accumulation of minerals such as N, P, Na, and Zn on edible flowers. During storage, salinity maintained but ethanol application increased the flower CO2 production. Ethanol application decreased the decay of flowers subjected to 100 mM NaCl. Flower weight losses and marketability accelerated at salinity of 100 mM NaCl after 14 days of storage. Tagetes flowers demonstrated induction in both non-enzymatic (i.e., proline content) and enzymatic mechanisms (catalase) to overcome stress caused by salinity during harvest stage and/or ethanol at storage. Our results have shown that short-term exposure to salinity and/or ethanol is able to achieve higher carotenoids and anthocyanins levels and these compounds can be considered as a new source of nutraceuticals.",Potato miR828 Is Associated With Purple Tuber Skin and Flesh Color.,https://www.ncbi.nlm.nih.gov/pubmed/30619382,Frontiers in plant science,2019 01 10,"Anthocyanins are plant pigments responsible for the colors of many flowers, fruits and storage organs and have roles in abiotic and biotic stress resistance. Anthocyanins and polyphenols are bioactive compounds in plants including potato (Solanum tuberosum L.) which is the most important non-cereal crop in the world, cultivated for its tubers rich in starch and nutrients. The genetic regulation of the flavonoid biosynthetic pathway is relatively well known leading to the formation of anthocyanins. However, our knowledge of post-transcriptional regulation of anthocyanin biosynthesis is limited. There is increasing evidence that micro RNAs (miRNAs) and other small RNAs can regulate the expression level of key factors in anthocyanin production. In this study we have found strong associations between the high levels of miR828, TAS4 D4(-) and purple/red color of tuber skin and flesh. This was confirmed not only in different cultivars but in pigmented and non-pigmented sectors of the same tuber. Phytochemical analyses verified the levels of anthocyanins and polyphenols in different tissues. We showed that miR828 is able to direct cleavage of the RNA originating from Trans-acting siRNA gene 4 (TAS4) and initiate the production of phased small interfering RNAs (siRNAs) whose production depends on RNA-dependent RNA polymerase 6 (RDR6). MYB transcription factors were predicted as potential targets of miR828 and TAS4 D4(-) and their expression was characterized. MYB12 and R2R3-MYB genes showed decreased expression levels in purple skin and flesh in contrast with high levels of small RNAs in the same tissues. Moreover, we confirmed that R2R3-MYB and MYB-36284 are direct targets of the small RNAs. Overall, this study sheds light on the small RNA directed anthocyanin regulation in potato, which is an important member of the Solanaceae family.",Impacts of Sand Burial and Wind Erosion on Regeneration and Growth of a Desert Clonal Shrub.,https://www.ncbi.nlm.nih.gov/pubmed/30619381,Frontiers in plant science,2019 01 10,"Sand burial and wind erosion caused by sand movement are common phenomena in desert environments, but the effects on clonal shrub have rarely been investigated. Here, we assessed how sand movements affect the population regeneration capacity of juvenile clonal fragments of the shrub Calligonum mongolicum growing in mobile desert sand dunes. We investigated the population status and natural regeneration capacity in three types of mobile dunes (heavy wind erosion, heavy sand burial and moderate sand burial). Clonal propagation of C. mongolicum was markedly different across sites. Moderate sand burial sites had the largest ramet density and bud number per unit length of rhizome, and the overwinter survival rate was significantly higher at sand burial sites than at wind erosion sites, suggesting that C. mongolicum may have well adapted to the moderate sand burial environment. We further examined the effects of clonal integration on clonal regeneration of this species. Physiological, biochemical and morphological characteristics of parent and daughter ramets growing in heterogeneous sandy habitats (sand burial or wind erosion) were measured. The results showed that being connected or severed from the maternal plant critically determined survival of daughter ramets on wind eroded rhizomes. When eroded rhizomes remained connected, the mother ramets had the highest chlorophyll a, b and a + b contents. However, both the mother plant and the daughter ramets undergoing erosion had higher proline and soluble protein levels than sand buried ramets. Meanwhile, the daughter ramets undergoing sand burial had higher photosynthetic rates (Pn), chlorophyll fluorescence parameters (Fm and Fo), and phenotypic traits of assimilating shoots, i.e., node number, length and volume than wind-eroded ramets. However, significant differences with mother plants, whether connected or severed, were very limited. It was concluded that moderate sand burial environments promoted clonal reproduction and growth of C. mongolicum. Additionally, physiological integration with mother raments in favorable conditions can alleviate stress on daughter ramets exposed to wind erosion. This physiological effect may do not occur for sand buried daughter ramets. These survival strategies and phenotypic responses should be carefully considered in shrub and sand dune management in sand fixation plantations of C. mongolicum.",Dendritic Cells and CD8 T Cell Immunity in Tumor Microenvironment.,https://www.ncbi.nlm.nih.gov/pubmed/30619378,Frontiers in immunology,2019 01 11,"Dendritic cells (DCs) play a central role in the regulation of the balance between CD8 T cell immunity vs. tolerance to tumor antigens. Cross-priming, a process which DCs activate CD8 T cells by cross-presenting exogenous antigens, plays a critical role in generating anti-tumor CD8 T cell immunity. However, there are compelling evidences now that the tumor microenvironment (TME)-mediated suppression and modulation of tumor-infiltrated DCs (TIDCs) impair their function in initiating potent anti-tumor immunity and even promote tumor progression. Thus, DC-mediated cross-presentation of tumor antigens in tumor-bearing hosts often induces T cell tolerance instead of immunity. As tumor-induced immunosuppression remains one of the major hurdles for cancer immunotherapy, understanding how DCs regulate anti-tumor CD8 T cell immunity in particular within TME has been under intensive investigation. Recent reports on the Batf3-dependent type 1 conventional DCs (cDC1s) in anti-tumor immunity have greatly advanced our understanding on the interplay of DCs and CD8 T cells in the TME, highlighted by the critical role of CD103+ cDC1s in the cross-priming of tumor antigen-specific CD8 T cells. In this review, we will discuss recent advances in anti-tumor CD8 T cell cross-priming by CD103+ cDC1s in TME, and share perspective on future directions including therapeutic applications and memory CD8 T cell responses.",DNA Damage Response Signals Transduce Stress From Rheumatoid Arthritis Risk Factors Into T Cell Dysfunction.,https://www.ncbi.nlm.nih.gov/pubmed/30619377,Frontiers in immunology,2019 01 10,"Rheumatoid arthritis (RA) is an autoimmune-mediated disease that is associated with significant cartilage damage and immunosenescence. Despite decades of research, the major signal pathways that initiate RA are still unclear. The DNA damage response (DDR) is a specific and hierarchical network that includes cell cycle checkpoints, DNA repair, and DNA-damage tolerance pathways. Recent studies suggest that this condition is associated with deficits in telomere maintenance and overall genomic instability in the T cells of RA patients. Analysis of the underlying mechanisms has revealed defects in DDR pathways. Particularly, the DNA repair enzyme, ataxia telangiectasia mutated (ATM), is downregulated, which leaves the damaged DNA breaks in RA-associated T cells unrepaired and pushes them to apoptosis, exhausts the T cell pool, and promotes the arthritogenesis effector function of T cells. This review discusses recent advancements and illustrates that risk factors for RA, such as viral infections, environmental events, and genetic risk loci are combat with DDR signals, and the impaired DDR response of RA-associated T cells, in turn, triggers disease-related phenotypes. Therefore, DDR is the dominant signal that converts genetic and environmental stress to RA-related immune dysfunction. Understanding the orchestration of RA pathogenesis by DDR signals would further our current knowledge of RA and provide novel avenues in RA therapy.",Interleukin-33 in Malignancies: Friends or Foes?,https://www.ncbi.nlm.nih.gov/pubmed/30619376,Frontiers in immunology,2019 01 10,"The human Interleukin-33 (IL-33), a member of the IL-1 family, is the cytokine as a cell endogenous alarmin, released by damaged or necrotic barrier cells (endothelial and epithelial cells). The signal transduction of IL-33 relies on recognition and interaction with specific receptor ST2, mainly expressed in immune cells. In both innate and adoptive immunity, IL-33 regulates the homeostasis in response to stress from within/out the microenvironment. Various, even negative biofunctions of IL-33 pathways have now been widely verified in pathogenesis among immunological mechanisms, like Th2-related immune-stimuli, inflammation/infection-induced tissue protectors. A larger versatility in studies of IL-33 on malignancies now focuses on: (1) promoting myeloid-derived suppressor cells (MDSC), (2) intervention toward CD8+ T, Natural Killer (NK) cell infiltration, group 2 innate lymphoid cells (ILC2) proliferation, dendritic cells (DC) activation, and (3) inhibiting tumor growth and/or further metastasis as an immunoadjuvant. Although IL-33 functioned pro-tumorigenically in various cancers, for some cancer types the findings so far are controversial. This review begins from a summarized introduction of IL-33, to its remarkable implications and molecular transduction pathway in malignant neoplasms, ends with latest inspiration for IL-33 in treatment."

The acquisition of functional competence in these particular NK-cell subsets is termed education. Little is known about the underlying mechanisms that lead to the functional differences between educated and uneducated NK cells. An increasing number of studies suggest that cellular metabolism is a determinant of immune cell functions. Thus, alterations in cellular metabolic pathways may play a role in the process of NK-cell education. Here, we compared the glycolytic profile of educated and uneducated primary human NK cells. KIR-educated NK cells showed significantly increased expression levels of the glucose transporter Glut1 in comparison to NKG2A-educated or uneducated NK cells with and without exposure to target cells. Subsequently, the metabolic profile of NK-cell subsets was determined using a Seahorse XF Analyzer. Educated NK cells displayed significantly higher rates of cellular glycolysis than uneducated NK cells even in a resting state. Our results indicate that educated and uneducated NK cells reside in different metabolic states prior to activation. These differences in the ability to utilize glucose may represent an underlying mechanism for the superior functionality of educated NK cells expressing self-inhibitory receptors.",Identification of Piecemeal Degranulation and Vesicular Transport of MBP-1 in Liver-Infiltrating Mouse Eosinophils During Acute Experimental Schistosoma mansoni Infection.,https://www.ncbi.nlm.nih.gov/pubmed/30619361,Frontiers in immunology,2019 01 18,"Eosinophils have been long associated with helminthic infections, although their functions in these diseases remain unclear. During schistosomiasis caused by the trematode Schistosoma mansoni, eosinophils are specifically recruited and migrate to sites of granulomatous responses where they degranulate. However, little is known about the mechanisms of eosinophil secretion during this disease. Here, we investigated the degranulation patterns, including the cellular mechanisms of major basic protein-1 (MBP-1) release, from inflammatory eosinophils in a mouse model of S. mansoni infection (acute phase). Fragments of the liver, a major target organ of this disease, were processed for histologic analyses (whole slide imaging), conventional transmission electron microscopy (TEM), and immunonanogold EM using a pre-embedding approach for precise localization of major basic protein 1 (MBP-1), a typical cationic protein stored pre-synthesized in eosinophil secretory (specific) granules. A well-characterized granulomatous inflammatory response with a high number of infiltrating eosinophils surrounding S. mansoni eggs was observed in the livers of infected mice. Moreover, significant elevations in the levels of plasma Th2 cytokines (IL-4, IL-13, and IL-10) and serum enzymes (alanine aminotransferase and aspartate aminotransferase) reflecting altered liver function were detected in response to the infection. TEM quantitative analyses revealed that while 19.1% of eosinophils were intact, most of them showed distinct degranulation processes: cytolysis (13.0%), classical and/or compound exocytosis identified by granule fusions (1.5%), and mainly piecemeal degranulation (PMD) (66.4%), which is mediated by vesicular trafficking. Immunonanogold EM showed a consistent labeling for MBP-1 associated with secretory granules. Most MBP-1-positive granules had PMD features (79.0 ± 4.8%). MBP-1 was also present extracellularly and on vesicles distributed in the cytoplasm and attached to/surrounding the surface of emptying granules. Our data demonstrated that liver-infiltrating mouse eosinophils are able to degranulate through different secretory processes during acute experimental S. mansoni infections with PMD being the predominant mechanism of eosinophil secretion. This means that a selective secretion of MBP-1 is occurring. Moreover, our study demonstrates, for the first time, a vesicular trafficking of MBP-1 within mouse eosinophils elicited by a helminth infection. Vesicle-mediated secretion of MBP-1 may be relevant for the rapid release of small concentrations of MBP-1 under cell activation.",CD4 Donor Lymphocyte Infusion Can Cause Conversion of Chimerism Without GVHD by Inducing Immune Responses Targeting Minor Histocompatibility Antigens in HLA Class II.,https://www.ncbi.nlm.nih.gov/pubmed/30619360,Frontiers in immunology,2019 01 10,"Under non-inflammatory conditions HLA class II is predominantly expressed on hematopoietic cells. Therefore, donor CD4 T-cells after allogeneic stem cell transplantation (alloSCT) may mediate graft-vs.-leukemia reactivity without graft-vs.-host disease (GVHD). We analyzed immune responses in four patients converting from mixed to full donor chimerism without developing GVHD upon purified CD4 donor lymphocyte infusion (DLI) from their HLA-identical sibling donor after T-cell depleted alloSCT. In vivo activated T-cells were clonally isolated after CD4 DLI. Of the alloreactive T-cell clones, 96% were CD4 positive, illustrating the dominant role of CD4 T-cells in the immune responses. We identified 9 minor histocompatibility antigens (MiHA) as targets for alloreactivity, of which 8 were novel HLA class II restricted MiHA. In all patients, MiHA specific CD4 T-cells were found that were capable to lyse hematopoietic cells and to recognize normal and malignant cells. No GVHD was induced in these patients. Skin fibroblasts forced to express HLA class II, were recognized by only two MiHA specific CD4 T-cell clones. Of the 7 clones that failed to recognize fibroblasts, two targeted MiHA were encoded by genes not expressed in fibroblasts, presentation of one MiHA was dependent on HLA-DO, which is absent in fibroblasts, and T-cells recognizing the remaining 4 MiHA had an avidity that was apparently too low to recognize fibroblasts, despite clear recognition of hematopoietic cells. In conclusion, purified CD4 DLI from HLA-identical sibling donors can induce conversion from mixed to full donor chimerism with graft-vs.-malignancy reactivity, but without GVHD, by targeting HLA class II restricted MiHA.",Surfactant Protein D Deficiency Aggravates Cigarette Smoke-Induced Lung Inflammation by Upregulation of Ceramide Synthesis.,https://www.ncbi.nlm.nih.gov/pubmed/30619359,Frontiers in immunology,2019 01 10,"Cigarette smoke (CS) is the main cause of chronic obstructive pulmonary disease. Surfactant protein D (SP-D) is an important anti-inflammatory protein that regulates host immune defense in the lungs. Here, we investigated the role of SP-D in a murine model of CS-induced inflammation. Pulmonary SP-D localization and abundance was compared between smoker and non-smoker individuals. For in vivo studies, wildtype, and SP-D-deficient mice were exposed to CS for either 12 weeks or 3 days. Moreover, the effect of therapeutic administration of recombinant fragment of human SP-D on the acute CS-induced changes was evaluated. Pulmonary SP-D appeared with heterogenous expression in human smokers, while mouse lung SP-D was uniformly upregulated after CS exposure. We found that SP-D-deficient mice were more susceptible to CS-induced macrophage-rich airway inflammation. SP-D deficiency influenced local pro-inflammatory cytokine levels, with increased CCL3 and interleukin-6 but decreased CXCL1. Furthermore, CS exposure caused significant upregulation of pro-inflammatory ceramides and related ceramide synthase gene transcripts in SP-D-deficient mice compared to wildtype littermates. Administration of recombinant fragment of human SP-D (rfhSP-D) alleviated CS-induced macrophage infiltration and prevented induction of ceramide synthase gene expression. Finally, rfhSP-D treatment attenuated CS-induced human epithelial cell apoptosis in vitro. Our results indicate that SP-D deficiency aggravates CS-induced lung inflammation partly through regulation of ceramide synthesis and that local SP-D enrichment rescues CS-induced inflammation.",Bovine Neonatal Monocytes Display Phenotypic Differences Compared With Adults After Challenge With the Infectious Abortifacient Agent Neospora caninum.,https://www.ncbi.nlm.nih.gov/pubmed/30619358,Frontiers in immunology,2019 01 10,"The neonatal period represents a window of susceptibility for ruminants given the abundance of infectious challenges in their environment. Maternal transfer of immunity does not occur in utero but post-parturition, however this does not compensate for potential deficits in the cellular compartment. Here we present a cellular and transcriptomic study to investigate if there is an age-related difference in the monocyte response in cattle during intra-cellular protozoan infection. We utilized Neospora caninum, an obligate intracellular protozoan parasite that causes abortion and negative economic impacts in cattle worldwide, to study these responses. We found neonatal animals had a significant greater percentage of CD14+ monocytes with higher CD80 cell surface expression. Adult monocytes harbored more parasites compared to neonatal monocytes; additionally greater secretion of IL-1β was observed in neonates. Microarray analysis revealed neonates have 535 genes significantly upregulated compared to adult with 23 upregulated genes. Biological pathways involved in immune response were evaluated and both age groups showed changes in the upregulation of tyrosine phosphorylation of STAT protein and JAK-STAT cascade pathways. However, the extent to which these pathways were upregulated in neonates was much greater. Our findings suggest that neonates are more resistant to cellular invasion with protozoan parasites and that the magnitude of the responses is related to significant changes in the JAK-STAT network.",Sickening or Healing the Heart? The Association of Ficolin-1 and Rheumatic Fever.,https://www.ncbi.nlm.nih.gov/pubmed/30619357,Frontiers in immunology,2019 01 10,"Rheumatic fever (RF) and its subsequent progression to rheumatic heart disease (RHD) are chronic inflammatory disorders prevalent in children and adolescents in underdeveloped countries, and a contributing factor for high morbidity and mortality rates worldwide. Their primary cause is oropharynx infection by Streptococcus pyogenes, whose acetylated residues are recognized by ficolin-1. This is the only membrane-bound, as well as soluble activator molecule of the complement lectin pathway (LP). Although LP genetic polymorphisms are associated with RF, FCN1 gene's role remains unknown. To understand this role, we haplotyped five FCN1 promoter polymorphisms by sequence-specific amplification in 193 patients (138 with RHD and 55, RF only) and 193 controls, measuring ficolin-1 serum concentrations in 78 patients and 86 controls, using enzyme-linked immunosorbent assay (ELISA). Patients presented lower ficolin-1 serum levels (p < 0.0001), but did not differ according to cardiac commitment. Control's genotype distribution was in the Hardy-Weinberg equilibrium. Four alleles (rs2989727: c.-1981A, rs10120023: c.-542A, rs10117466: c.-144A, and rs10858293: c.33T), all associated with increased FCN1 gene expression in whole blood or adipose subcutaneous tissue (p = 0.000001), were also associated with increased protection against the disease. They occur within the *3C2 haplotype, associated with an increased protection against RF (OR = 0.41, p < 0.0001) and with higher ficolin-1 levels in patient serum (p = 0.03). In addition, major alleles of these same polymorphisms comprehend the most primitive *1 haplotype, associated with increased susceptibility to RF (OR = 1.76, p < 0.0001). Nevertheless, instead of having a clear-cut protective role, the minor c.-1981A and c.-144A alleles were also associated with additive susceptibility to valvar stenosis and mitral insufficiency (OR = 3.75, p = 0.009 and OR = 3.37, p = 0.027, respectively). All associations were independent of age, sex or ethnicity. Thus, minor FCN1 promoter variants may play a protective role against RF, by encouraging bacteria elimination as well as increasing gene expression and protein levels. On the other hand, they may also predispose the patients to RHD symptoms, by probably contributing to chronic inflammation and tissue injury, thus emphasizing the dual importance of ficolin-1 in both conditions.",Heme Drives Susceptibility of Glomerular Endothelium to Complement Overactivation Due to Inefficient Upregulation of Heme Oxygenase-1.,https://www.ncbi.nlm.nih.gov/pubmed/30619356,Frontiers in immunology,2019 01 10,"Atypical hemolytic uremic syndrome (aHUS) is a severe disease characterized by microvascular endothelial cell (EC) lesions leading to thrombi formation, mechanical hemolysis and organ failure, predominantly renal. Complement system overactivation is a hallmark of aHUS. To investigate this selective susceptibility of the microvascular renal endothelium to complement attack and thrombotic microangiopathic lesions, we compared complement and cyto-protection markers on EC, from different vascular beds, in in vitro and in vivo models as well as in patients. No difference was observed for complement deposits or expression of complement and coagulation regulators between macrovascular and microvascular EC, either at resting state or after inflammatory challenge. After prolonged exposure to hemolysis-derived heme, higher C3 deposits were found on glomerular EC, in vitro and in vivo, compared with other EC in culture and in mice organs (liver, skin, brain, lungs and heart). This could be explained by a reduced complement regulation capacity due to weaker binding of Factor H and inefficient upregulation of thrombomodulin (TM). Microvascular EC also failed to upregulate the cytoprotective heme-degrading enzyme heme-oxygenase 1 (HO-1), normally induced by hemolysis products. Only HUVEC (Human Umbilical Vein EC) developed adaptation to heme, which was lost after inhibition of HO-1 activity. Interestingly, the expression of KLF2 and KLF4-known transcription factors of TM, also described as possible transcription modulators of HO-1- was weaker in micro than macrovascular EC under hemolytic conditions. Our results show that the microvascular EC, and especially glomerular EC, fail to adapt to the stress imposed by hemolysis and acquire a pro-coagulant and complement-activating phenotype. Together, these findings indicate that the vulnerability of glomerular EC to hemolysis is a key factor in aHUS, amplifying complement overactivation and thrombotic microangiopathic lesions.",Parasite Recognition and Signaling Mechanisms in Innate Immune Responses to Malaria.,https://www.ncbi.nlm.nih.gov/pubmed/30619355,Frontiers in immunology,2019 01 11,"Malaria caused by the Plasmodium family of parasites, especially P.falciparum and P. vivax, is a major health problem in many countries in the tropical and subtropical regions of the world. The disease presents a wide array of systemic clinical conditions and several life-threatening organ pathologies, including the dreaded cerebral malaria. Like many other infectious diseases, malaria is an inflammatory response-driven disease, and positive outcomes to infection depend on finely tuned regulation of immune responses that efficiently clear parasites and allow protective immunity to develop. Immune responses initiated by the innate immune system in response to parasites play key roles both in protective immunity development and pathogenesis. Initial pro-inflammatory responses are essential for clearing infection by promoting appropriate cell-mediated and humoral immunity. However, elevated and prolonged pro-inflammatory responses owing to inappropriate cellular programming contribute to disease conditions. A comprehensive knowledge of the molecular and cellular mechanisms that initiate immune responses and how these responses contribute to protective immunity development or pathogenesis is important for developing effective therapeutics and/or a vaccine. Historically, in efforts to develop a vaccine, immunity to malaria was extensively studied in the context of identifying protective humoral responses, targeting proteins involved in parasite invasion or clearance. The innate immune response was thought to be non-specific. However, during the past two decades, there has been a significant progress in understanding the molecular and cellular mechanisms of host-parasite interactions and the associated signaling in immune responses to malaria. Malaria infection occurs at two stages, initially in the liver through the bite of a mosquito, carrying sporozoites, and subsequently, in the blood through the invasion of red blood cells by merozoites released from the infected hepatocytes. Soon after infection, both the liver and blood stage parasites are sensed by various receptors of the host innate immune system resulting in the activation of signaling pathways and production of cytokines and chemokines. These immune responses play crucial roles in clearing parasites and regulating adaptive immunity. Here, we summarize the knowledge on molecular mechanisms that underlie the innate immune responses to malaria infection.",Neutrophils and Malaria.,https://www.ncbi.nlm.nih.gov/pubmed/30619354,Frontiers in immunology,2019 01 10,"Neutrophils are abundant in the circulation and are one of the immune system's first lines of defense against infection. There has been substantial work carried out investigating the role of neutrophils in malaria and it is clear that during infection neutrophils are activated and are capable of clearing malaria parasites by a number of mechanisms. This review focuses on neutrophil responses to human malarias, summarizing evidence which helps us understand where neutrophils are, what they are doing, how they interact with parasites as well as their potential role in vaccine mediated immunity. We also outline future research priorities for these, the most abundant of leukocytes.",Antigenic Peptide Prediction From E6 and E7 Oncoproteins of HPV Types 16 and 18 for Therapeutic Vaccine Design Using Immunoinformatics and MD Simulation Analysis.,https://www.ncbi.nlm.nih.gov/pubmed/30619353,Frontiers in immunology,2019 01 10,"Human papillomavirus (HPV) induced cervical cancer is the second most common cause of death, after breast cancer, in females. Three prophylactic vaccines by Merck Sharp & Dohme (MSD) and GlaxoSmithKline (GSK) have been confirmed to prevent high-risk HPV strains but these vaccines have been shown to be effective only in girls who have not been exposed to HPV previously. The constitutively expressed HPV oncoproteins E6 and E7 are usually used as target antigens for HPV therapeutic vaccines. These early (E) proteins are involved, for example, in maintaining the malignant phenotype of the cells. In this study, we predicted antigenic peptides of HPV types 16 and 18, encoded by E6 and E7 genes, using an immunoinformatics approach. To further evaluate the immunogenic potential of the predicted peptides, we studied their ability to bind to class I major histocompatibility complex (MHC-I) molecules in a computational docking study that was supported by molecular dynamics (MD) simulations and estimation of the free energies of binding of the peptides at the MHC-I binding cleft. Some of the predicted peptides exhibited comparable binding free energies and/or pattern of binding to experimentally verified MHC-I-binding epitopes that we used as references in MD simulations. Such peptides with good predicted affinity may serve as candidate epitopes for the development of therapeutic HPV peptide vaccines."

However, the mechanism whereby chitosan-DNA skews IgA class switch recombination (CSR) of B cells in the Gut-associated lymph tissue (GALT) is not fully resolved. In this study, we investigated the effects of nasally administered chitosan-DNA (pcDNA3.1-VP1 plasmid encoding VP1 capsid protein of Coxsackievirus B3) on IgA production, DC activation and Tfh/Th17 response in the intestine. Compared to DNA immunization, intranasal chitosan-DNA vaccination induced antigen-specific IgA production in feces, a pronounced switching of antigen-specific IgA+ plasmablast B cells in the mesenteric lymph nodes (MLNs) and an enhanced expression of post-recombination Iα-CH transcripts/IgA germline transcript (αGT) as well as activation-induced cytidine deaminase (AID) in MLN B cells. MLN Tfh frequency was markedly enhanced by chitosan-DNA, and was associated with VP1-specific IgA titer. 24 h after immunization, intranasal chitosan-DNA induced a recruitment of CD103+DCs into the MLN that paralleled a selective loss of CD103+DCs in the lamina propria (LP). In vivo activated MLN-derived CD103+DCs produced high levels of IL-6 and BAFF in response to chitosan-DNA, which up-regulated transmembrane activator and CAML interactor (TACI) expression on MLN B cells. Upon co-culture with IgM+B in the presence of chitosan-DNA, MLN CD103+DCs induced IgA production in a T-dependent manner; and this IgA-promoting effect of CD103+DC was blocked by targeting TACI and, to a lower extent, by blocking IL-6. MLN CD103+DCs displayed an enhanced capacity to induce an enhanced CD4+Th17 response in vivo and in vitro, and IL-17A deficient mice had a pronounced reduction of specific intestinal IgA following immunization. Taken together, mesenteric CD103+DCs are indispensable for the adjuvant activity of chitosan in enhancing DNA vaccine-specific IgA switching in gut through activating BAFF-TACI and IL-6-IL-6R signaling, and through inducing Th17/Tfh differentiation in the MLN.",Hypomorphic Mutations in the BCR Signalosome Lead to Selective Immunoglobulin M Deficiency and Impaired B-cell Homeostasis.,https://www.ncbi.nlm.nih.gov/pubmed/30619340,Frontiers in immunology,2019 01 10,"B cell activation via the B cell receptor (BCR) signalosome involves participation of signaling molecules such as BTK and BLNK. Genetic defects in these molecules are known to impair B cell differentiation and subsequently lead to agammaglobulinemia. Here we identified novel mutations in BTK and BLNK in two unrelated patients that perturb the intrinsic B-cell receptor signaling pathway and lead to selective IgM deficiency, whereas production of other immunoglobulin isotypes and IgG antibody response remain intact. Currently it is unknown how BCR signaling strength affects mature B cell development in humans. Both patients show reduced levels of BCR signalosome phosphorylation as well as impaired BCR-dependent Ca2+ influx, which was accompanied by a marked decrease in IgD+IgM+CD27+ MZ-like B-cells. We further describe reduced expression of essential B cell differentiation factors such as BAFF-R and T-Bet in the patients' B-cells, which might contribute to the observed deficiency of MZ-like B cells. MZ-like B cells are known to produce natural IgM antibodies that play an essential role in immune homeostasis. By using surface plasmon resonance (SPR) technology and a synthetic blood group A trisaccharide as antigen we were able to show that both patients lack the presence of anti-blood group A IgM considered to be prototypical natural antibodies whereas IgG levels were normal. Antibody binding dynamics and binding affinity of anti-blood group A IgG were comparable between patients and healthy controls. These results indicate that human IgM deficiency can be associated with signaling defects in the BCR signalosome, defective production of natural IgM antibodies in the blood group A/B/0 system and abnormalities in B cell development.",Effects of Epithelial IL-13Rα2 Expression in Inflammatory Bowel Disease.,https://www.ncbi.nlm.nih.gov/pubmed/30619339,Frontiers in immunology,2019 01 10,"Background: Mucosal IL-13 Receptor alpha 2 (IL13RA2) mRNA expression is one of the best predictive markers for primary non-responsiveness to infliximab therapy in patients with inflammatory bowel disease (IBD). The objective of this study was to understand how IL-13Rα2, a negative regulator of IL-13 signaling, can contribute to IBD pathology. Methods:IL13RA2 knockout (KO) and wild type (WT) mice were exposed to dextran sodium sulfate (DSS) in drinking water to induce colitis. Furthermore, mucosal biopsies and resection specimen of healthy individuals and IBD patients before the start of anti-tumor necrosis factor (anti-TNF) therapy were obtained for immunohistochemistry and gene expression analysis. Results: After induction of DSS colitis, IL13RA2 KO mice had similar disease severity, but recovered more rapidly than WT animals. Goblet cell numbers and mucosal architecture were also more rapidly restored in IL13RA2 KO mice. In mucosal biopsies of active IBD patients, immunohistochemistry revealed that IL-13Rα2 protein was highly expressed in epithelial cells, while expression was restricted to goblet cells in healthy controls. Mucosal IL13RA2 mRNA negatively correlated with mRNA of several goblet cell-specific and barrier genes, and with goblet cell numbers. Conclusions: The data suggest that IL-13Rα2 on epithelial cells contributes to IBD pathology by negatively influencing goblet cell recovery, goblet cell function and epithelial restoration after injury. Therefore, blocking IL-13Rα2 could be a promising target for restoration of the epithelial barrier in IBD.",HMGN1 and R848 Synergistically Activate Dendritic Cells Using Multiple Signaling Pathways.,https://www.ncbi.nlm.nih.gov/pubmed/30619338,Frontiers in immunology,2019 01 11,"High mobility group nucleosome-binding protein 1 (HMGN1 or N1) is a Th1-polarizing alarmin, but alone is insufficient to induce antitumor immunity.

Here, we show that co-stimulation with N1 and R848 of human monocyte-derived DCs (MoDCs) markedly upregulated DC's surface expression of CD80, CD83, CD86, and HLA-DR, as well as synergistic production of pro-inflammatory cytokines including IL-12p70, IL-1β, and TNF-α. This combination also synergistically activated NF-κB and multiple MAPKs that are involved in DC maturation. Moreover, N1 and R848 synergistically increased nuclear translocation of interferon (IFN) regulatory transcription factors (e.g., IRF3 and IRF7) and promoted the expression of type 1 IFNs such as IFN-α2, IFN-α4, and IFN-β1. Similar signaling pathways were also induced in mouse bone marrow-derived DCs (BMDCs). RNA-seq analysis in human MoDCs revealed that N1 plus R848 synergistically upregulated the expression of genes predominantly involved in DC maturation pathway, particularly genes critical for the polarization of Th1 immune responses (e.g., IL12A, IL12B, and IFNB1, etc.). Overall, our findings show that (1) N1 synergizes with R848 in activating human and mouse DCs and (2) the synergistic effect based on various intracellular signaling events culminated in the activation of multiple transcriptional factors. These findings have important implications for future clinical trials since N1 and R848 synergistically promoted optimal Th1 lineage immune responses resulting in tumor rejection in mice.",High Levels of Eomes Promote Exhaustion of Anti-tumor CD8+ T Cells.,https://www.ncbi.nlm.nih.gov/pubmed/30619337,Frontiers in immunology,2019 01 10,"Eomes, a T-box transcription factor, is known important for both function and homeostasis of effector and memory T cells, but was recently also implicated in CD8+ T cell exhaustion. However, whether and how Eomes might regulate effector functions or exhaustion of CD8+ T cells, especially in the tumor setting, is unknown. Here we first show, as tumor progressed, Eomes expression was elevated in tumor-infiltrating CD8+ T cells, especially in PD-1+Tim-3+ exhausted CD8+ T cells. Complete loss of Eomes in T cells resulted in impaired development of anti-tumor CTLs, whereas deletion of one allele of Eomes in T cells decreased development of exhausted CD8+ T cells, which offered better tumor control. Integrative analysis of RNAseq and ChIPseq of Eomes-overexpressing T cells revealed that high levels of Eomes expression directly controlled expression of T cell exhaustion genes, such as Havcr2. In addition, Eomes might compete with T-bet binding to regulatory genomic loci to antagonize T-bet functions. Collectively, Eomes exerts bimodal functions in CD8+ T cells in tumor.",Hepatocyte-Derived Lipotoxic Extracellular Vesicle Sphingosine 1-Phosphate Induces Macrophage Chemotaxis.,https://www.ncbi.nlm.nih.gov/pubmed/30619336,Frontiers in immunology,2019 01 11,"Background: The pathophysiology of non-alcoholic steatohepatitis involves hepatocyte lipotoxicity due to excess saturated free fatty acids and concomitant proinflammatory macrophage effector responses. These include the infiltration of macrophages into hepatic cords in response to incompletely understood stimuli. Stressed hepatocytes release an increased number of extracellular vesicles (EVs), which are known to participate in intercellular signaling and coordination of the behavior of immune cell populations via their cargo. We hypothesized that hepatocyte-derived lipotoxic EVs that are enriched in sphingosine 1-phosphate (S1P) are effectors of macrophage infiltration in the hepatic microenvironment. Methods: Lipotoxic EVs were isolated from palmitate treated immortalized mouse hepatocytes and characterized by nanoparticle tracking analysis. Lipotoxic EV sphingolipids were quantified using tandem mass spectrometry. Wildtype and S1P1 receptor knockout bone marrow-derived macrophages were exposed to lipotoxic EV gradients in a microfluidic gradient generator. Macrophage migration toward EV gradients was captured by time-lapse microscopy and analyzed to determine directional migration. Fluorescence-activated cell sorting along with quantitative PCR and immunohistochemistry were utilized to characterize the cell surface expression of S1P1 receptor on intrahepatic leukocytes and hepatic expression of S1P1 receptor, respectively. Results: Palmitate treatment induced the release of EVs. These EVs were enriched in S1P. Palmitate-induced S1P enriched EVs were chemoattractive to macrophages. EV S1P enrichment depended on the activity of sphingosine kinases 1 and 2, such that, pharmacological inhibition of sphingosine kinases 1 and 2 resulted in a significant reduction in EV S1P cargo without affecting the number of EVs released. When exposed to EVs derived from cells treated with palmitate in the presence of a pharmacologic inhibitor of sphingosine kinases 1 and 2, macrophages displayed diminished chemotactic behavior. To determine receptor-ligand specificity, we tested the migration responses of macrophages genetically deleted in the S1P1 receptor toward lipotoxic EVs. S1P1 receptor knockout macrophages displayed a marked reduction in their chemotactic responses toward lipotoxic palmitate-induced EVs. Conclusions:Palmitate-induced lipotoxic EVs are enriched in S1P through sphingosine kinases 1 and 2. S1P-enriched EVs activate persistent and directional macrophage chemotaxis mediated by the S1P1 receptor, a potential signaling axis for macrophage infiltration during hepatic lipotoxicity, and a potential therapeutic target for non-alcoholic steatohepatitis.",A Mass Spectrometry-Based Profiling of Interactomes of Viral DDB1- and Cullin Ubiquitin Ligase-Binding Proteins Reveals NF-κB Inhibitory Activity of the HIV-2-Encoded Vpx.,https://www.ncbi.nlm.nih.gov/pubmed/30619335,Frontiers in immunology,2019 01 10,"Viruses and hosts are situated in a molecular arms race. To avoid morbidity and mortality, hosts evolved antiviral restriction factors. These restriction factors exert selection pressure on the viruses and drive viral evolution toward increasingly efficient immune antagonists. Numerous viruses exploit cellular DNA damage-binding protein 1 (DDB1)-containing Cullin RocA ubiquitin ligases (CRLs) to induce the ubiquitination and subsequent proteasomal degradation of antiviral factors expressed by their hosts. To establish a comprehensive understanding of the underlying protein interaction networks, we performed immuno-affinity precipitations for a panel of DDB1-interacting proteins derived from viruses such as mouse cytomegalovirus (MCMV, Murid herpesvirus [MuHV] 1), rat cytomegalovirus Maastricht MuHV2, rat cytomegalovirus English MuHV8, human cytomegalovirus (HCMV), hepatitis B virus (HBV), and human immunodeficiency virus (HIV). Cellular interaction partners were identified and quantified by mass spectrometry (MS) and validated by classical biochemistry. The comparative approach enabled us to separate unspecific interactions from specific binding partners and revealed remarkable differences in the strength of interaction with DDB1. Our analysis confirmed several previously described interactions like the interaction of the MCMV-encoded interferon antagonist pM27 with STAT2. We extended known interactions to paralogous proteins like the interaction of the HBV-encoded HBx with different Spindlin proteins and documented interactions for the first time, which explain functional data like the interaction of the HIV-2-encoded Vpr with Bax. Additionally, several novel interactions were identified, such as the association of the HIV-2-encoded Vpx with the transcription factor RelA (also called p65). For the latter interaction, we documented a functional relevance in antagonizing NF-κB-driven gene expression. The mutation of the DDB1 binding interface of Vpx significantly impaired NF-κB inhibition, indicating that Vpx counteracts NF-κB signaling by a DDB1- and CRL-dependent mechanism. In summary, our findings improve the understanding of how viral pathogens hijack cellular DDB1 and CRLs to ensure efficient replication despite the expression of host restriction factors.",Circular RNAs and Their Emerging Roles in Immune Regulation.,https://www.ncbi.nlm.nih.gov/pubmed/30619334,Frontiers in immunology,2019 01 10,"Circular ribonucleic acid (RNA) molecules (circRNAs) are covalently closed loop RNA molecules with no 5' end caps or 3' poly (A) tails, which are generated by back-splicing. Originally, circRNAs were considered to be byproducts of aberrant splicing. However, in recent years, development of high-throughput sequencing has led to gradual recognition of functional circRNAs, and increasing numbers of studies have elucidated their roles in cancer, neurologic diseases, and cardiovascular disorders. Nevertheless, studies of the functions of circRNAs in the immune system are relatively scarce. In this review, we detail relevant research on the biogenesis and classification of circRNAs, describe their functional mechanisms and approaches to their investigation, and summarize recent studies of circRNA function in the immune system.",Beyond Killing Mycobacterium tuberculosis: Disease Tolerance.,https://www.ncbi.nlm.nih.gov/pubmed/30619333,Frontiers in immunology,2019 01 10,"Host defense strategies against infectious diseases are comprised of both host resistance and disease tolerance. Resistance is the ability of the host to prevent invasion or to eliminate the pathogen, while disease tolerance is defined by limiting the collateral tissue damage caused by the pathogen and/or the immune response without exerting direct effects on pathogen growth. Our incomplete understanding of host immunity against tuberculosis (TB) is predominately rooted in our bias toward investigating host resistance. Thus, we must refocus our efforts to understand the entire spectrum of immunity against M. tuberculosis to control TB."

Orthopedic implant loosening, in the absence of infection, is mostly attributable to the generation of wear debris. Dental peri-implantitis is characterized by a multifactorial etiology and is the main cause of implant failure. It consists of a peri-implant inflammatory lesion that often results in loss of supporting bone. Disease management includes cleaning the surrounding flora by hand instruments, ultrasonic tips, lasers, or chemical agents. We recently published a paper indicating that US scaling of titanium (Ti) implants releases particles that provoke an inflammatory response and osteolysis. Here we show that a strong inflammatory response occurs; however, very few of the titanium particles are phagocytosed by the macrophages. We then measured a dramatic Ti particle-induced stimulation of IL1β, IL6, and TNFα secretion by these macrophages using multiplex immunoassay. The particle-induced expression profile, examined by FACS, also indicated an M1 macrophage polarization. To assess how the secreted cytokines contributed to the paracrine exacerbation of the inflammatory response and to osteoclastogenesis, we treated macrophage/preosteoclast cultures with neutralizing antibodies against IL1β, IL6, or TNFα. We found that anti-TNFα antibodies attenuated the overall expression of both the inflammatory cytokines and osteoclastogenesis. On the other hand, anti-IL1β antibodies affected osteoclastogenesis but not the paracrine expression of inflammatory cytokines, whereas anti-IL6 antibodies did the opposite. We then tested these neutralizing antibodies in vivo using our mouse calvarial model of Ti particle-induced osteolysis and microCT analysis. Here, all neutralizing antibodies, administered by intraperitoneal injection, completely abrogated the particle-induced osteolysis. This suggests that blockage of paracrine inflammatory stimulation and osteoclastogenesis are similarly effective in preventing bone resorption induced by Ti particles. Blocking both the inflammation and osteoclastogenesis by anti-TNFα antibodies, incorporated locally into a slow-release membrane, also significantly prevented osteolysis. The osteolytic inflammatory response, fueled by ultrasonic scaling of Ti implants, results from an inflammatory positive feedback loop and osteoclastogenic stimulation. Our findings suggest that blocking IL1β, IL6, and/or TNFα systemically or locally around titanium implants is a promising therapeutic approach for the clinical management of peri-implant bone loss.",Signal Distortion: How Intracellular Pathogens Alter Host Cell Fate by Modulating NF-κB Dynamics.,https://www.ncbi.nlm.nih.gov/pubmed/30619320,Frontiers in immunology,2019 01 11,"By uncovering complex dynamics in the expression or localization of transcriptional regulators in single cells that were otherwise hidden at the population level, live cell imaging has transformed our understanding of how cells sense and orchestrate appropriate responses to changes in their internal state or extracellular environment. This has proved particularly true for the nuclear factor-kappaB (NF-κB) family of transcription factors, key regulators of the inflammatory response and innate immune function, which are capable of encoding information about the mode and intensity of stimuli in the dynamics of NF-κB nuclear accumulation and loss. While live cell imaging continues to serve as a useful tool in ongoing efforts to characterize the feedbacks that shape these dynamics and to connect dynamics to downstream gene expression, it is also proving invaluable for recent studies that seek to determine how intracellular pathogens subvert NF-κB signaling to survive and replicate within host cells by providing quantitative information about the pathogen and changes in NF-κB activity during different stages of an infection. Here, we provide a brief overview of NF-κB signaling in innate immune cells and review recent literature that uses live imaging to investigate the mechanisms by which bacterial and yeast pathogens modulate NF-κB in a variety of different host cell types to evade destruction or maintain the viability of an intracellular growth niche.",To B or Not to B: Understanding B Cell Responses in the Development of Malaria Infection.,https://www.ncbi.nlm.nih.gov/pubmed/30619319,Frontiers in immunology,2019 01 10,"Malaria is a widespread disease caused mainly by the Plasmodium falciparum (Pf) and Plasmodium vivax (Pv) protozoan parasites. Depending on the parasite responsible for the infection, high morbidity and mortality can be triggered. To escape the host immune responses, Plasmodium parasites disturb the functionality of B cell subsets among other cell types. However, some antibodies elicited during a malaria infection have the potential to block pathogen invasion and dissemination into the host. Thus, the question remains, why is protection not developed and maintained after the primary parasite exposure? In this review, we discuss different aspects of B cell responses against Plasmodium antigens during malaria infection. Since most studies have focused on the quantification of serum antibody titers, those B cell responses have not been fully characterized. However, to secrete antibodies, a complex cellular response is set up, including not only the activation and differentiation of B cells into antibody-secreting cells, but also the participation of other cell subsets in the germinal center reactions. Therefore, a better understanding of how B cell subsets are stimulated during malaria infection will provide essential insights toward the design of potent interventions.",Maternal Schistosomiasis: Immunomodulatory Effects With Lasting Impact on Allergy and Vaccine Responses.,https://www.ncbi.nlm.nih.gov/pubmed/30619318,Frontiers in immunology,2019 01 10,"Early exposure to immune stimuli, including maternal infection during the perinatal period, is increasingly recognized to affect immune predisposition during later life. This includes exposure to not only viral and bacterial infection but also parasitic helminths which remain widespread. Noted effects of helminth infection, including altered incidence of atopic inflammation and vaccine responsiveness, support further research into the impact these infections have for skewing immune responses. At the same time, despite a sea of recommendations, clear phenotypic and mechanistic understandings of how environmental perturbations in pregnancy and nursing modify immune predisposition and allergy in offspring remain unrefined. Schistosomes, as strong inducers of type 2 immunity embedded in a rich network of regulatory processes, possess strong abilities to shift inflammatory and allergic diseases in infected hosts, for example by generating feedback loops that impair T cell responses to heterologous antigens. Based on the current literature on schistosomiasis, we explore in this review how maternal schistosome infection could drive changes in immune system development of offspring and how this may lead to identifying factors involved in altering responses to vaccination as well as manifestations of immune disorders including allergy.",CD4+ T Cells Alter the Stromal Microenvironment and Repress Medullary Erythropoiesis in Murine Visceral Leishmaniasis.,https://www.ncbi.nlm.nih.gov/pubmed/30619317,Frontiers in immunology,2019 02 16,"Human visceral leishmaniasis, a parasitic disease of major public health importance in developing countries, is characterized by variable degrees of severity of anemia, but the mechanisms underlying this change in peripheral blood have not been thoroughly explored. Here, we used an experimental model of visceral leishmaniasis in C57BL/6 mice to explore the basis of anemia following infection with Leishmania donovani. 28 days post-infection, mice showed bone marrow dyserythropoiesis by myelogram, with a reduction of TER119+ CD71-/+ erythroblasts. Reduction of medullary erythropoiesis coincided with loss of CD169high bone marrow stromal macrophages and a reduction of CXCL12-expressing stromal cells. Although the spleen is a site of extramedullary erythropoiesis and erythrophagocytosis, splenectomy did not impact the extent of anemia or affect the repression of medullary hematopoiesis that was observed in infected mice. In contrast, these changes in bone marrow erythropoiesis were not evident in B6.Rag2-/- mice, but could be fully reconstituted by adoptive transfer of IFNγ-producing but not IFNγ-deficient CD4+ T cells, mimicking the expansion of IFNγ-producing CD4+ T cells that occurs during infection in wild type mice. Collectively, these data indicate that anemia during experimental murine visceral leishmaniasis can be driven by defects associated with the bone marrow erythropoietic niche, and that this represents a further example of CD4+ T cell-mediated immunopathology affecting hematopoietic competence.",Perspective on the Development and Validation of Ab Reagents to Fish Immune Proteins for the Correct Assessment of Immune Function.,https://www.ncbi.nlm.nih.gov/pubmed/30619316,Frontiers in immunology,2019 01 11,"Understanding of immune function in humans and model organisms, such as mice, has advanced in the last few decades because of technological breakthroughs and availability of reagents. While novel genomic technologies have helped to increase knowledge of many aspects of immunology, most developments in immunology have occurred because of the availability of antibodies to identify and sort different cell types, as well as to identify and quantify the protein products of cells. Unfortunately, many studies performed in fish make use of poorly characterized antibody reagents that may affect the conclusions of those studies. In light of this, we would like to offer some insight and discussion points based on our research experience on the strategies and techniques that are required for proper validation of antibody reagents to fish immune molecules. Our main goal is to encourage a much needed discussion in our field to foster the use of correctly validated reagents that enable the study of fish immune function.",The Role of Histone Methyltransferases and Long Non-coding RNAs in the Regulation of T Cell Fate Decisions.,https://www.ncbi.nlm.nih.gov/pubmed/30619315,Frontiers in immunology,2019 01 11,"T cell lineage decisions are critical for the development of proper immune responses to pathogens as well as important for the resolution of inflammatory responses. This differentiation process relies on a combination of intrinsic and extrinsic factors converging upon epigenetic regulation of transcriptional networks relevant to specific T cell lineages. As these biochemical modifications represent therapeutic opportunities in cancer biology and autoimmunity, implications of writers and readers of epigenetic marks to immune cell differentiation and function are highly relevant. Given the ready adoption of histone methyltransferase inhibitors in the clinic, we focus this review on the role of three histone modifying complexes: PRC-1, PRC-2, and G9A in modulating T cell fate decisions. Furthermore, we explore the role of long non-coding RNAs in regulating these processes, and discuss recent advances and challenges of implementing epigenetic therapies into clinical practice.",mPGES-1-Mediated Production of PGE2 and EP4 Receptor Sensing Regulate T Cell Colonic Inflammation.,https://www.ncbi.nlm.nih.gov/pubmed/30619314,Frontiers in immunology,2019 03 29,"PGE2 is a lipid mediator of the initiation and resolution phases of inflammation, as well as a regulator of immune system responses to inflammatory events. PGE2 is produced and sensed by T cells, and autocrine or paracrine PGE2 can affect T cell phenotype and function. In this study, we use a T cell-dependent model of colitis to evaluate the role of PGE2 on pathological outcome and T-cell phenotypes. CD4+ T effector cells either deficient in mPGES-1 or the PGE2 receptor EP4 are less colitogenic. Absence of T cell autocrine mPGES1-dependent PGE2 reduces colitogenicity in association with an increase in CD4+RORγt+ cells in the lamina propria. In contrast, recipient mice deficient in mPGES-1 exhibit more severe colitis that corresponds with a reduced capacity to generate FoxP3+ T cells, especially in mesenteric lymph nodes. Thus, our research defines how mPGES-1-driven production of PGE2 by different cell types in distinct intestinal locations impacts T cell function during colitis. We conclude that PGE2 has profound effects on T cell phenotype that are dependent on the microenvironment.",Selective Effects of mTOR Inhibitor Sirolimus on Naïve and CMV-Specific T Cells Extending Its Applicable Range Beyond Immunosuppression.,https://www.ncbi.nlm.nih.gov/pubmed/30619313,Frontiers in immunology,2019 01 10,"Cytomegalovirus (CMV) infection/reactivation remains among the most important complications of immunosuppression after transplantation. However, recent clinical observations indicate that mammalian target of rapamycin (mTOR) inhibition with sirolimus may improve the outcome of CMV complications. Underlying mechanisms of this observation, particularly the effect of sirolimus on naïve- and CMV-specific cytotoxic CD8+ T-cell (CMV-CTL) functionality is still undiscovered. Here, the influence of sirolimus on naïve and memory CMV-CTLs was determined by CD3/CD28 crosslinking and alloreactivity assays. After stimulating CMV-CTL with HLA-A*02:01-restricted CMVpp65-peptide loaded artificial antigen-presenting cells (aAPCs), we measured the effect of sirolimus on T-cell proliferation, phenotype, and functionality. Sirolimus significantly improved CMV-specific effector memory T-cell function and negatively influenced naïve T cells. This unique mechanism of action was further characterized by increased secretion of interferon-gamma (IFN-γ), granzyme B (GzB) and enhanced target-cell-dependent cytotoxic capacity of activated CMV-CTLs. Next-generation-sequencing (NGS) was applied to monitor T-cell receptor (TCR)-repertoire dynamics and to verify, that the increased functionality was not related to sirolimus-resistant CTL-clones. Instead, modulation of environmental cues during CMV-CTL development via IL-2 receptor (IL-2R)-driven signal transducer and activator of transcription-5 (STAT-5) signaling under mTOR inhibition allowed fine-tuning of T-cell programming for enhanced antiviral response with stable TCR-repertoire dynamics. We show for the first time that sirolimus acts selectively on human naïve and memory T cells and improves CMV-specific T-cell function via modulation of the environmental milieu. The data emphasize the importance to extend immune monitoring including cytokine levels and T-cell functionality which will help to identify patients who may benefit from individually tailored immunosuppression."

However, these stress ligands are also transiently expressed by activated T cells implying that NKG2D-based T cells may undergo self-killing (fratricide) during cell manufacturing or during the freeze thaw cycle prior to infusion in patients. To avoid target-driven fratricide and enable the production of NKG2D-CAR T cells for clinical application, two distinct approaches were investigated. The first focused upon the inclusion of a Phosphoinositol-3-Kinase inhibitor (LY294002) into the production process. A second strategy involved the inclusion of antibody blockade of NKG2D itself. Both processes impacted T cell fratricide, albeit at different levels with the antibody process being the most effective in terms of cell yield. While both approaches generated comparable NKG2D-CAR T cells, there were subtle differences, for example in differentiation status, that were fine-tuned through the phasing of the inhibitor and antibody during culture in order to generate a highly potent NKG2D-CAR T cell product. By means of targeted inhibition of NKG2D expression or generic inhibition of enzyme function, target-driven CAR T fratricide can be overcome. These strategies have been incorporated into on-going clinical trials to enable a highly efficient and reproducible manufacturing process for NKG2D-CAR T cells.",Regulatory Immune Mechanisms in Tolerance to Food Allergy.,https://www.ncbi.nlm.nih.gov/pubmed/30619299,Frontiers in immunology,2019 01 10,"Oral tolerance can develop after frequent exposure to food allergens. Upon ingestion, food is digested into small protein fragments in the gastrointestinal tract. Small food particles are later absorbed into the human body. Interestingly, some of these ingested food proteins can cause allergic immune responses, which can lead to food allergy. So far it has not been completely elucidated how these proteins become immunogenic and cause food allergies. In contrast, oral tolerance helps to prevent the pathologic reactions against different types of food antigens from animal or plant origin. Tolerance to food is mainly acquired by dendritic cells, epithelial cells in the gut, and the gut microbiome. A subset of CD103+ DCs is capable of inducing T regulatory cells (Treg cells) that express anti-inflammatory cytokines. Anergic T cells also contribute to oral tolerance, by reducing the number of effector cells. Similar to Treg cells, B regulatory cells (Breg cells) suppress effector T cells and contribute to the immune tolerance to food allergens. Furthermore, the human microbiome is an essential mediator in the induction of oral tolerance or food allergy. In this review, we outline the current understanding of regulatory immune mechanisms in oral tolerance. The biological changes reflecting early consequences of immune stimulation with food allergens should provide useful information for the development of novel therapeutic treatments.",Mesenchymal Stem Cells in Systemic Sclerosis: Allogenic or Autologous Approaches for Therapeutic Use?,https://www.ncbi.nlm.nih.gov/pubmed/30619298,Frontiers in immunology,2019 01 10,"Systemic sclerosis (SSc) is a rare autoimmune disease, which is potentially lethal. The physiopathology of the disease is still incompletely elucidated although the role of fibroblasts, endothelial cells (ECs), immune cells. and the environment (i.e., oxidative stress) has been demonstrated. This is an intractable disease with an urgent need to provide better therapeutic options to patients. Mesenchymal stem cells (MSCs) represent a promising therapeutic approach thanks to the number of trophic and pleiotropic properties they exert. Among these, MSCs display anti-fibrotic, angiogenic, and immunomodulatory capacities that might be of interest in the treatment of SSc by acting on different processes that are dysregulated in the disease. In the recent years, the therapeutic effectiveness of MSCs has been demonstrated in different preclinical animal models and is being investigated in phase I clinical trials. Both allogenic and autologous transplantation of MSCs isolated from bone marrow or adipose tissue is being evaluated. The rationale for using allogenic MSCs in SSc, as well as in other autoimmune diseases, is based on the possibility that autologous MSCs might be altered in these diseases. In SSc, reports from the literature are controversial. Nevertheless, the role of the oxidative environment and of the crosstalk with neighboring cells (fibroblasts and ECs) on the functional properties of MSCs has been reported. Here, we review the preclinical and clinical data reporting the interest of MSC-based treatment in SSc and question the use of autologous or allogeneic MSCs in perspective of clinical applications.",Trained Immunity-Based Vaccines: A New Paradigm for the Development of Broad-Spectrum Anti-infectious Formulations.,https://www.ncbi.nlm.nih.gov/pubmed/30619296,Frontiers in immunology,2019 01 10,"Challenge with specific microbial stimuli induces long lasting epigenetic changes in innate immune cells that result in their enhanced response to a second challenge by the same or unrelated microbial insult, a process referred to as trained immunity. This opens a new avenue in vaccinology to develop Trained Immunity-based Vaccines (TIbV), defined as vaccine formulations that induce training in innate immune cells. Unlike conventional vaccines, which are aimed to elicit only specific responses to vaccine-related antigens, TIbV aim to stimulate broader responses. As trained immunity is generally triggered by pattern recognition receptors (PRRs), TIbV should be formulated with microbial structures containing suitable PRR-ligands. The TIbV concept we describe here may be used for the development of vaccines focused to promote host resistance against a wide spectrum of pathogens. Under the umbrella of trained immunity, a broad protection can be achieved by: (i) increasing the nonspecific effector response of innate immune cells (e.g., monocyte/macrophages) to pathogens, (ii) harnessing the activation state of dendritic cells to enhance adaptive T cell responses to both specific and nonrelated (bystander) antigens. This capacity of TIbV to promote responses beyond their nominal antigens may be particularly useful when conventional vaccines are not available or when multiple coinfections and/or recurrent infections arise in susceptible individuals. As the set of PRR-ligands chosen is essential not only for stimulating trained immunity but also to drive adaptive immunity, the precise design of TIbV will improve with the knowledge on the functional relationship among the different PRRs. While the TIbV concept is emerging, a number of the current anti-infectious vaccines, immunostimulants, and even vaccine adjuvants may already fall in the TIbV category. This may apply to increase immunogenicity of novel vaccine design approaches based on small molecules, like those achieved by reverse vaccinology.",Clara Cell 10 kDa Protein Alleviates Murine Hepatitis Virus Strain 3-Induced Fulminant Hepatitis by Inhibiting Fibrinogen-Like Protein 2 Expression.,https://www.ncbi.nlm.nih.gov/pubmed/30619295,Frontiers in immunology,2019 01 10,"Background: Fulminant hepatitis (FH) is a serious threat to human life, accompanied by massive and rapid necroinflammation. Kupffer cells, the major immune cell population involved in innate immune responses, are considered to be central for FH. Fibrinogen-like protein 2 (Fgl2) is a pro-coagulant protein that is substantially induced in macrophages upon viral infection, and Fgl2 depletion represses murine hepatitis virus strain 3 (MHV-3) infection. Clara cell 10 kDa (CC10) protein is a secretory protein with anti-inflammatory properties in allergic rhinitis and asthma. However, its mechanisms of action and pathogenic roles in other disease are still unclear. In this study, we aimed to determine the role of CC10 in FH and the regulation of Fgl2 by CC10. Methods: A mouse FH model was established by peritoneal injection of MHV-3. The mice received CC10 protein through tail vein injection before viral infection. Survival rate, liver function, liver histology, fibrin deposition, and necrosis were examined. The regulatory effect of CC10 on Fgl2 expression was investigated using THP-1 cells and mouse peritoneal macrophages in vitro. Results: In the mouse FH model induced by MHV-3, the survival rate increased from 0 to 12.5% in the CC10 group compared to that in the saline-only control group. Meanwhile, the levels of ALT and AST in serum were significantly decreased and liver damage was reduced. Furthermore, hepatic Fgl2, TNF-α, and IL-1β expression was obviously downregulated together with fibrin deposition, and hepatocyte apoptosis was reduced after administration of CC10 protein. In vitro, CC10 was found to significantly inhibit the expression of Fgl2 in IFN-γ-treated THP-1 cells and MHV-3-infected mouse peritoneal macrophages by western blot and real-time PCR. However, there was no direct interaction between CC10 and Fgl2 as shown by co-immunoprecipitation. Microarray investigations suggested that HMG-box transcription factor 1 (HBP1) was significantly low in CC10-treated and IFN-γ-primed THP-1 cells. HBP1-siRNA treatment abrogated the inhibitory effect of CC10 on Fgl2 expression in Human Umbilical Vein Endothelial cells (HUVECs). Conclusion:CC10 protects against MHV-3-induced FH via suppression of Fgl2 expression in macrophages. Such effects may be mediated by the transcription factor HBP1.",Long Interleukin-22 Binding Protein Isoform-1 Is an Intracellular Activator of the Unfolded Protein Response.,https://www.ncbi.nlm.nih.gov/pubmed/30619294,Frontiers in immunology,2019 01 10,"The human IL22RA2 gene co-produces three protein isoforms in dendritic cells [IL-22 binding protein isoform-1 (IL-22BPi1), IL-22BPi2, and IL-22BPi3]. Two of these, IL-22BPi2 and IL-22BPi3, are capable of neutralizing the biological activity of IL-22. The function of IL-22BPi1, which differs from IL-22BPi2 through an in-frame 32-amino acid insertion provided by an alternatively spliced exon, remains unknown. Using transfected human cell lines, we demonstrate that IL-22BPi1 is secreted detectably, but at much lower levels than IL-22BPi2, and unlike IL-22BPi2 and IL-22BPi3, is largely retained in the endoplasmic reticulum (ER). As opposed to IL-22BPi2 and IL-22BPi3, IL-22BPi1 is incapable of neutralizing or binding to IL-22 measured in bioassay or assembly-induced IL-22 co-folding assay. We performed interactome analysis to disclose the mechanism underlying the poor secretion of IL-22BPi1 and identified GRP78, GRP94, GRP170, and calnexin as main interactors. Structure-function analysis revealed that, like IL-22BPi2, IL-22BPi1 binds to the substrate-binding domain of GRP78 as well as to the middle domain of GRP94. Ectopic expression of wild-type GRP78 enhanced, and ATPase-defective GRP94 mutant decreased, secretion of both IL-22BPi1 and IL-22BPi2, while neither of both affected IL-22BPi3 secretion. Thus, IL-22BPi1 and IL-22BPi2 are bona fide clients of the ER chaperones GRP78 and GRP94. However, only IL-22BPi1 activates an unfolded protein response (UPR) resulting in increased protein levels of GRP78 and GRP94. Cloning of the IL22RA2 alternatively spliced exon into an unrelated cytokine, IL-2, bestowed similar characteristics on the resulting protein. We also found that CD14++/CD16+ intermediate monocytes produced a higher level of IL22RA2 mRNA than classical and non-classical monocytes, but this difference disappeared in immature dendritic cells (moDC) derived thereof. Upon silencing of IL22RA2 expression in moDC, GRP78 levels were significantly reduced, suggesting that native IL22RA2 expression naturally contributes to upregulating GRP78 levels in these cells. The IL22RA2 alternatively spliced exon was reported to be recruited through a single mutation in the proto-splice site of a Long Terminal Repeat retrotransposon sequence in the ape lineage. Our work suggests that positive selection of IL-22BPi1 was not driven by IL-22 antagonism as in the case of IL-22BPi2 and IL-22BPi3, but by capacity for induction of an UPR response.",Genetics and Functional Genomics of Spondyloarthritis.,https://www.ncbi.nlm.nih.gov/pubmed/30619293,Frontiers in immunology,2019 01 10,"Spondyloarthritis (SpA) is a chronic inflammatory disorder with high heritability but with complex genetics. It encompasses several entities that share common clinical features. Most of the genetic studies in SpA have been restricted to ankylosing spondylitis (AS), the prototypical form of SpA. However, there is growing evidence of shared genetic background between all the SpA subtypes and also with some other immune-mediated diseases. The most important part of SpA heritability comes from the HLA-B27 allele in the major histocompatibility complex (MHC) that explains around 25% of the attributable heredity. Several other loci outside of the MHC have been shown to be involved in the disease. However, all these non-MHC loci explain only a small additional fraction of disease predisposition. Thus, a substantial fraction of SpA genetic basis remains poorly understood. Gene expression profiling is a complementary approach to elucidate the underlying mechanisms and pathways that drive the disease. Several expression profiling studies have been undertaken in SpA. However, results have been quite disappointing with little overlap between the studies largely due to the small sample sizes, resulting in limited power to discover small effects. In this review, we summarize current knowledge on genetic findings concerning SpA and we describe strategic approaches for identification of additional variants, with a focus on rare variants in familial forms. We also provide an overview of gene expression studies in SpA and discuss the possibilities offered by high-throughput RNA sequencing technologies, in particular in sorted cells. Finally, issues in establishing molecular mechanisms underlying genetic association hits and potential translational applications will be addressed.",Herpes Simplex Virus Type 2 Infection-Induced Expression of CXCR3 Ligands Promotes CD4+ T Cell Migration and Is Regulated by the Viral Immediate-Early Protein ICP4.,https://www.ncbi.nlm.nih.gov/pubmed/30619292,Frontiers in immunology,2019 01 10,"HSV-2 infection-induced CXCR3 ligands are important for the recruitment of virus-specific CD8+ T cells, but their impact on CD4+ T cell trafficking remains to be further determined. Given that recruitment of CD4+ T cells to infection areas may be one of the mechanisms that account for HSV-2 infection-mediated enhancement of HIV-1 sexual transmission, here we investigated the functionality of HSV-2 infection-induced CXCR3 ligands CXCL9, CXCL10, and CXCL11 in vivo and in vitro, and determined the viral components responsive for such induction and the underlying mechanisms. We first found that the expression of CXCR3 ligands CXCL9, CXCL10, and CXCL11 was increased in mice following vaginal challenge with HSV-2, while CXCL9 played a predominant role in the recruitment of CD4+ T cells to the vaginal foci of infected mice. HSV-2 infection also induced the production of CXCL9, CXCL10, and CXCL11 in human cervical epithelial cells. Of note, although HSV-2 induced the expression of all the three CXCR3 ligands, the induced CXCL9 appeared to play a predominant role in promoting CD4+ T cell migration, reflecting that the concentrations of CXCL10 and CXCL11 required for CD4+ T cell migration are higher than that of CXCL9. We further revealed that, ICP4, an immediate-early protein of HSV-2, is crucial in promoting CXCR3 ligand expression through the activation of p38 MAPK pathway. Mechanistically, ICP4 binds to corresponding promoters of CXCR3 ligands via interacting with the TATA binding protein (TBP), resulting in the transcriptional activation of the corresponding promoters. Taken together, our study highlights HSV-2 ICP4 as a vital viral protein in promoting CXCR3 ligand expression and CXCL9 as the key induced chemokine in mediating CD4+ T cell migration. Findings in this study have shed light on HSV-2 induced leukocyte recruitment which may be important for understanding HSV-2 infection-enhanced HIV-1 sexual transmission and the development of intervention strategies.","Epigenetic and Transcriptional Regulation in the Induction, Maintenance, Heterogeneity, and Recall-Response of Effector and Memory Th2 Cells.",https://www.ncbi.nlm.nih.gov/pubmed/30619290,Frontiers in immunology,2019 01 10,"Antigen-primed T cells respond to restimulation much faster than naïve T cells and form the cellular basis of immunological memory. The formation of memory Th2 cells starts when naïve CD4 T cells are transformed into effector Th2 cells and is completed after antigen clearance and a long-term resting phase accompanied by epigenetic changes in the Th2 signature genes. Memory Th2 cells maintain their functions and acquired heterogeneity through epigenetic machinery, on which the recall-response of memory Th2 cells is also dependent. We provide an overview of the epigenetics in the whole Th2 cell cycle, mainly focusing on two different histone lysine methyltransferase complexes: the Polycomb and Trithorax groups. We finally discuss the pathophysiology and potential therapeutic strategies for the treatment of Th2-mediated inflammatory diseases in mice and humans.",Interleukin-4 Receptor Alpha Expressing B Cells Are Essential to Down-Modulate Host Granulomatous Inflammation During Schistosomasis.,https://www.ncbi.nlm.nih.gov/pubmed/30619289,Frontiers in immunology,2019 01 11,"Schistosomiasis (bilharzia) is a parasitic helminth disease that can cause severe inflammatory pathology leading to organ damage in humans. Failure of the host to regulate egg-driven granulomatous inflammation causes host morbidity during chronic infection with Schistosoma mansoni. Although the importance of B cells in regulating pathology during chronic infection has been well defined, the specific contribution of IL-4Rα-expressing B cells is still unknown. To address this, we examined B cell-specific IL-4Rα-deficient (mb1creIL-4Rα-/lox) mice in three experimental models of schistosomiasis: high-dose (100 cercariae), low dose (30 cercariae), and a synchronous egg challenge. In the high dose model, we found that mice deficient in IL-4Rα-expressing B cells were more susceptible to acute schistosomiasis than B cell-deficient (μMT) mice, succumbing to infection at the acute stage whereas μMT mice survived until the chronic stage. An S. mansoni egg challenge model demonstrated that deleting IL-4Rα expression specifically on B cells resulted in increased lung granulomatous pathology, suggesting a role for this B cell subset in controlling granulomatous pathology. In agreement with this, a low dose model of schistosomiasis-which mimics the course of clinical chronic disease-demonstrated that depleting IL-4Rα-expressing B cells in mb1creIL-4Rα-/lox mice considerably impaired the host ability to down-modulate granulomatous inflammation in the liver and gut during chronic schistosomiasis. Taken together, our findings indicate that within the B cell compartment, IL-4Rα-expressing B cells in particular down-modulate the deleterious egg-driven tissue granulomatous inflammation to enable host survival during schistosomiasis in mice."

Arginine can be supplied from our diet or de novo synthesis from citrulline. In conditions of sepsis or endotoxemia, arginine may be deficient and be accompanied with altered immune response. L-arginine supplementation can ameliorate dysregulated immune condition and improve prognosis. Many studies had tried L-arginine or L-citrulline supplementation to examine the effect on immune response in the adult population. Few had studied on the young children. In this study, we determined the effect of L-arginine and L-citrulline supplementation on the immune response of infantile rats. Male infantile rats received normal saline, L-arginine (200 mg/kg/day) or L-citrulline (200 mg/kg/day) intraperitoneally over postnatal day 8 to day 14. The infantile rats were then sacrificed. The blood was analyzed while the spleen was indicated for immune analysis after stimulation with concanavalin A (Con A) or lipopolysaccharide (LPS). We found L-arginine supplementation enhanced Th1 immune response by increasing IFN-γ production. Both the L-arginine and L-citrulline therapy can modulate regulatory T-cell (Treg) immune effects by increasing the IL-10 level. Only the L-citrulline group showed a TGF-β1 increase. Both L-arginine and L-citrulline therapy were also noted to decrease SMAD7 expression and enhance SIRT-1 abundance. However, FOXP3 expression was only modulated by L-citrulline treatment. We then concluded that L-arginine and L-citrulline supplementation can modulate the regulatory T-cells function differently for infantile rats.",EF-Tu From Non-typeable Haemophilus influenzae Is an Immunogenic Surface-Exposed Protein Targeted by Bactericidal Antibodies.,https://www.ncbi.nlm.nih.gov/pubmed/30619274,Frontiers in immunology,2019 01 10,"Non-typeable Haemophilus influenzae (NTHi), a commensal organism in pre-school children, is an opportunistic pathogen causing respiratory tract infections including acute otitis media. Adults suffering from chronic obstructive pulmonary disease (COPD) are persistently colonized by NTHi. Previous research has suggested that, in some bacterial species, the intracellular elongation factor thermo-unstable (EF-Tu) can moonlight as a surface protein upon host encounter. The aim of this study was to determine whether EF-Tu localizes to the surface of H. influenzae, and if such surface-associated EF-Tu is a target for bactericidal antibodies. Using flow cytometry, transmission immunoelectron microscopy, and epitope mapping, we demonstrated that EF-Tu is exposed at the surface of NTHi, and identified immunodominant epitopes of this protein. Rabbits immunized with whole-cell NTHi produced significantly more immunoglobulin G (IgG) directed against EF-Tu than against the NTHi outer membrane proteins D and F as revealed by enzyme-linked immunosorbent assays. Chemical cleavage of NTHi EF-Tu by cyanogen bromide (CNBr) followed by immunoblotting showed that the immunodominant epitopes were located within the central and C-terminal regions of the protein. Peptide epitope mapping by dot blot analysis further revealed four different immunodominant peptide sequences; EF-Tu41-65, EF-Tu161-185, EF-Tu221-245, and EF-Tu281-305. These epitopes were confirmed to be surface-exposed and accessible by peptide-specific antibodies in flow cytometry. We also analyzed whether antibodies raised against NTHi EF-Tu cross-react with other respiratory tract pathogens. Anti-EF-Tu IgG significantly detected EF-Tu on unencapsulated bacteria, including the Gram-negative H. parainfluenzae, H. haemolyticus, Moraxella catarrhalis and various Gram-positive Streptococci of the oral microbiome. In contrast, considerably less EF-Tu was observed at the surface of encapsulated bacteria including H. influenzae serotype b (Hib) and Streptococcus pneumoniae (e.g., serotype 3 and 4). Removal of the capsule, as exemplified by Hib RM804, resulted in increased EF-Tu surface density. Finally, anti-NTHi EF-Tu IgG promoted complement-dependent bacterial killing of NTHi and other unencapsulated Gram-negative bacteria as well as opsonophagocytosis of Gram-positive bacteria. In conclusion, our data demonstrate that NTHi EF-Tu is surface-exposed and recognized by antibodies mediating host innate immunity against NTHi in addition to other unencapsulated respiratory tract bacteria.",Immunomodulation of the Tumor Microenvironment: Turn Foe Into Friend.,https://www.ncbi.nlm.nih.gov/pubmed/30619273,Frontiers in immunology,2019 01 10,"Immunotherapy, where the patient's own immune system is exploited to eliminate tumor cells, has become one of the most prominent new cancer treatment options in the last decade. The main hurdle for classical cancer vaccines is the need to identify tumor- and patient specific antigens to include in the vaccine. Therefore, in situ vaccination represents an alternative and promising approach. This type of immunotherapy involves the direct intratumoral administration of different immunomodulatory agents and uses the tumor itself as the source of antigen. The ultimate aim is to convert an immunodormant tumor microenvironment into an immunostimulatory one, enabling the immune system to eradicate all tumor lesions in the body. In this review we will give an overview of different strategies, which can be exploited for the immunomodulation of the tumor microenvironment and their emerging role in the treatment of cancer patients.",HRV16 Impairs Macrophages Cytokine Response to a Secondary Bacterial Trigger.,https://www.ncbi.nlm.nih.gov/pubmed/30619272,Frontiers in immunology,2019 01 10,"Human rhinovirus is frequently seen as an upper respiratory tract infection but growing evidence proves the virus can cause lower respiratory tract infections in patients with chronic inflammatory lung diseases including chronic obstructive pulmonary disease (COPD). In addition to airway epithelial cells, macrophages are crucial for regulating inflammatory responses to viral infections. However, the response of macrophages to HRV has not been analyzed in detail. We used in vitro monocyte-derived human macrophages to study the cytokine secretion of macrophages in response to the virus. Our results showed that macrophages were competent at responding to HRV, as a robust cytokine response was detected. However, after subsequent exposure to non-typeable Haemophilus influenzae (NTHi) or to LPS, HRV-treated macrophages secreted reduced levels of pro-inflammatory or regulatory cytokines. This ""paralyzed"" phenotype was not mimicked if the macrophages were pre-treated with LPS or CpG instead of the virus. These results begin to deepen our understanding into why patients with COPD show HRV-induced exacerbations and why they mount a defective response toward NTHi.",Transcription Factor ZNF281: A Novel Player in Intestinal Inflammation and Fibrosis.,https://www.ncbi.nlm.nih.gov/pubmed/30619271,Frontiers in immunology,2019 01 10,"Background and aims: Recent evidences reveal the occurrence of a close relationship among epithelial to mesenchymal transition (EMT), chronic inflammation and fibrosis. ZNF281 is an EMT-inducing transcription factor (EMT-TF) involved in the regulation of pluripotency, stemness, and cancer. The aim of this study was to investigate in vitro, in vivo, and ex vivo a possible role of ZNF281 in the onset and progression of intestinal inflammation. A conceivable contribution of the protein to the development of intestinal fibrosis was also explored. Methods: Human colorectal adenocarcinoma cell line, HT29, and C57BL/6 mice were used for in vitro and in vivo studies. Mucosal biopsy specimens were taken during endoscopy from 29 pediatric patients with Crohn's disease (CD), 24 with ulcerative colitis (UC) and 16 controls. ZNF281 was knocked down by transfecting HT29 cells with 20 nM small interference RNA (siRNA) targeting ZNF281 (siZNF281). Results: We show for the first time that ZNF281 is induced upon treatment with inflammatory agents in HT29 cells, in cultured uninflamed colonic samples from CD patients and in DSS-treated mice. ZNF281 expression correlates with the disease severity degree of CD and UC patients. Silencing of ZNF281 strongly reduces both inflammatory (IL-8, IL-1beta, IL-17, IL-23) and EMT/fibrotic (SNAIL, Slug, TIMP-1, vimentin, fibronectin, and α-SMA) gene expression; besides, it abolishes the increase of extracellular-collagen level as well as the morphological modifications induced by inflammation. Conclusions: The identification of transcription factor ZNF281 as a novel player of intestinal inflammation and fibrosis allows a deeper comprehension of the pathogenetic mechanisms underlying inflammatory bowel disease (IBD) and provide a new target for their cure.",Long Non-coding RNAs Are Central Regulators of the IL-1β-Induced Inflammatory Response in Normal and Idiopathic Pulmonary Lung Fibroblasts.,https://www.ncbi.nlm.nih.gov/pubmed/30619270,Frontiers in immunology,2019 01 11,"There is accumulating evidence to indicate that long non-coding RNAs (lncRNAs) are important regulators of the inflammatory response. In this report, we have employed next generation sequencing to identify 14 lncRNAs that are differentially expressed in human lung fibroblasts following the induction of inflammation using interleukin-1β (IL-1β). Knockdown of the two most highly expressed lncRNAs, IL7AS, and MIR3142HG, showed that IL7AS negatively regulated IL-6 release whilst MIR3142HG was a positive regulator of IL-8 and CCL2 release. Parallel studies in fibroblasts derived from patients with idiopathic pulmonary fibrosis showed similar increases in IL7AS levels, that also negatively regulate IL-6 release. In contrast, IL-1β-induced MIR3142HG expression, and its metabolism to miR-146a, was reduced by 4- and 9-fold in IPF fibroblasts, respectively. This correlated with a reduced expression of inflammatory mediators whilst MIR3142HG knockdown showed no effect upon IL-8 and CCL2 release. Pharmacological studies showed that IL-1β-induced IL7AS and MIR3142HG production and release of IL-6, IL-8, and CCL2 in both control and IPF fibroblasts were mediated via an NF-κB-mediated pathway. In summary, we have cataloged those lncRNAs that are differentially expressed following IL-1β-activation of human lung fibroblasts, shown that IL7AS and MIR3142HG regulate the inflammatory response and demonstrated that the reduced inflammatory response in IPF fibroblast is correlated with attenuated expression of MIR3142HG/miR-146a.","Anti-cancer Therapies Employing IL-2 Cytokine Tumor Targeting: Contribution of Innate, Adaptive and Immunosuppressive Cells in the Anti-tumor Efficacy.",https://www.ncbi.nlm.nih.gov/pubmed/30619269,Frontiers in immunology,2019 01 10,"Antibody-cytokine fusion proteins (immunocytokine) exert a potent anti-cancer effect; indeed, they target the immunosuppressive tumor microenvironment (TME) due to a specific anti-tumor antibody linked to immune activating cytokines. Once bound to the target tumor, the interleukin-2 (IL-2) immunocytokines composed of either full antibody or single chain Fv conjugated to IL-2 can promote the in situ recruitment and activation of natural killer (NK) cells and cytotoxic CD8+ T lymphocytes (CTL). This recruitment induces a TME switch toward a classical T helper 1 (Th1) anti-tumor immune response, supported by the cross-talk between NK and dendritic cells (DC). Furthermore, some IL-2 immunocytokines have been largely shown to trigger tumor cell killing by antibody dependent cellular cytotoxicity (ADCC), through Fcγ receptors engagement. The modulation of the TME can be also achieved with immunocytokines conjugated with a mutated form of IL-2 that impairs regulatory T (Treg) cell proliferation and activity. Preclinical animal models and more recently phase I/II clinical trials have shown that IL-2 immunocytokines can avoid the severe toxicities of the systemic administration of high doses of soluble IL-2 maintaining the potent anti-tumor effect of this cytokine. Also, very promising results have been reported using IL-2 immunocytokines delivered in combination with other immunocytokines, chemo-, radio-, anti-angiogenic therapies, and blockade of immune checkpoints. Here, we summarize and discuss the most relevant reported studies with a focus on: (a) the effects of IL-2 immunocytokines on innate and adaptive anti-tumor immune cell responses as well as immunosuppressive Treg cells and (b) the approaches to circumvent IL-2-mediated severe toxic side effects.",Th22 Cells Promote Osteoclast Differentiation via Production of IL-22 in Rheumatoid Arthritis.,https://www.ncbi.nlm.nih.gov/pubmed/30619268,Frontiers in immunology,2019 01 10,"T helper (Th) cells can differentiate into functionally distinct subsets and play a pivotal role in inflammatory and autoimmune diseases such as rheumatoid arthritis (RA). Th22 cells have been identified as a new subset secreting interleukin (IL)-22. Although elevated levels of IL-22 in the synovial fluids of RA patients were reported, its pathological roles remain unclear. Here, we demonstrated that IL-22 was characteristically produced from CD3+CD4+CC-chemokine receptor (CCR)4+CCR6+CCR10+ cells and their ability of the production of IL-22 markedly exceeded that of other Th subsets and the subset, thereby, designated Th22 cells. Th22 cells were efficiently induced by the stimulation with tumor necrosis factor-α, IL-6, and IL-1β. Th22 cells were markedly infiltrated in synovial tissue in patients with active RA, but not in patients with osteoarthritis (OA). CCL17, CCL20, and CCL28, which are chemokine ligands of CCR4, CCR6, and CCR10, respectively, were abundantly expressed in RA synovial tissue compared to OA. By in vitro Trans-well migration assay, Th22 cells efficiently migrated toward CCL28. Co-culture of Th22 cells, which were sorted from peripheral blood, with monocytes in the presence of macrophage colony-stimulating factor and receptor activator of nuclear factor (NF)-κB ligand induced osteoclasts formation more efficiently than that of either Th1 cells or Th17 cells. Furthermore, IL-22 markedly augmented osteoclast differentiation by promoting nuclear factor of activated T cells c1 expression in CD14+ monocytes. Contrarily, the addition of IFN-γ to the culture significantly decreased osteoclasts number, whereas IL-17 had marginal effects. IL-22 neutralizing antibody inhibited osteoclast formation in the co-culture of Th22 cells with CD14+ monocytes. Collectively, the results indicated that Th22 cells, which co-express chemokine receptors CCR4, CCR6, and CCR10, possess strong potency of tissue migration and accumulate into inflamed synovial tissues where the ligands such as CCL28 are highly expressed. Thus, Th22 cells have the capacity to promote osteoclast differentiation through production of IL-22 and thus play a pivotal role in bone destruction in patients with RA.",Immune Correlates of Natural HIV Elite Control and Simultaneous HCV Clearance-Supercontrollers.,https://www.ncbi.nlm.nih.gov/pubmed/30619267,Frontiers in immunology,2019 01 11,"HIV-elite controllers are a minority group of HIV-infected patients with the ability to maintain undetectable HIV viremia for long time periods without antiretroviral treatment.

There are no studies that explore immune correlates looking for the mechanisms implicated in this extraordinary phenomenon. Herein, we have analyzed HCV- and HIV-specific T-cell responses, as well as T, dendritic and NK cell phenotypes. The higher HCV-specific CD4 T-cell polyfunctionality, together with a low activation and exhaustion T-cell phenotype was found in supercontrollers. In addition, the frequency of CD8 CD161high T-cells was related with HIV- and HCV-specific T-cells polyfunctionality. Interesting features regarding NK and plasmacytoid dendritic cells (pDCs) were found. The study of the supercontroller's immune response, subjects that spontaneously controls both chronic viral infections, could provide further insights into virus-specific responses needed to develop immunotherapeutic strategies in the setting of HIV cure or HCV vaccination.",Recruitment of Antigen Presenting Cells to Skin Draining Lymph Node From HPV16E7-Expressing Skin Requires E7-Rb Interaction.,https://www.ncbi.nlm.nih.gov/pubmed/30619266,Frontiers in immunology,2019 01 10,"""High-risk"" human papillomaviruses (HPV) infect keratinocytes of squamous epithelia. The HPV16E7 protein induces epithelial hyperplasia by binding Rb family proteins and disrupting cell cycle termination. Murine skin expressing HPV16E7 as a transgene from a keratin 14 promoter (K14.E7) demonstrates epithelial hyperplasia, dysfunctional antigen presenting cells, ineffective antigen presentation by keratinocytes, and production of immunoregulatory cytokines. Furthermore, grafted K14.E7 skin is not rejected from immunocompetent non-transgenic recipient animals. To establish the contributions of E7, of E7-Rb interaction and of epithelial hyperplasia to altered local skin immunity, K14.E7 skin was compared with skin from K14.E7 mice heterozygous for a mutant Rb unable to bind E7 (K14.E7xRbΔL/ΔL mice), that have normoplastic epithelium. Previously, we demonstrated that E7-speicfic T cells do not accumulate in K14.E7xRbΔL/ΔL skin grafts. Here, we further show that K14.E7xRbΔL/ΔL skin, like K14.E7 skin, is not rejected by immunocompetent non-transgenic animals. There were fewer CD11b+ antigen presenting cells in skin draining lymph nodes from animals recipient of K14.E7xRbΔL/ΔL grafts, when compared with animals receiving K14.E7 grafts or K5mOVA grafts. Maturation of migratory DCs derived from K14.E7xRbΔL/ΔL grafts found in the draining lymph nodes is significantly lower than that of K14.E7 grafts. Surprisingly, K14.E7xRbΔL/ΔL keratinocytes, unlike K14.E7 keratinocytes, are susceptible to E7 directed CTL-mediated lysis in vitro. We conclude that E7-Rb interaction and its associated epithelial hyperplasia partially contribute to the suppressive local immune responses in area affected by HPV16E7 expression."

For decades, GC B cells have been defined by their reactivity to the plant lectin peanut agglutinin (PNA), which binds serine/threonine (O-linked) glycans containing the asialylated disaccharide Gal-β1,3-GalNAc-Ser/Thr (also called T-antigen). In T cells, acquisition of PNA binding by activated T cells and thymocytes has been linked with altered tissue homing patterns, cell signaling, and survival. Yet, in GC B cells, the glycobiological basis and significance of PNA binding remains surprisingly unresolved. Here, we investigated the basis for PNA reactivity of GC B cells. We found that GC B cell binding to PNA is associated with downregulation of the α2,3 sialyltransferase, ST3GAL1 (ST3Gal1), and overexpression of ST3Gal1 was sufficient to reverse PNA binding in B cell lines. Moreover, we found that the primary scaffold for PNA-reactive O-glycans in B cells is the B cell receptor-associated receptor-type tyrosine phosphatase CD45, suggesting a role for altered O-glycosylation in antigen receptor signaling. Consistent with similar reports in T cells, ST3Gal1 overexpression in B cells in vitro induced drastic shortening in O-glycans, which we confirmed by both antibody staining and mass spectrometric O-glycomic analysis. Unexpectedly, ST3Gal1-induced changes in O-glycan length also correlated with altered binding of two glycosylation-sensitive CD45 antibodies, RA3-6B2 (more commonly called B220) and MEM55, which (in humans) have previously been reported to favor binding to naïve/GC subsets and memory/plasmablast subsets, respectively. Analysis of primary B cell binding to B220, MEM55, and several plant lectins suggested that B cell differentiation is accompanied by significant loss of O-glycan complexity, including loss of extended Core 2 O-glycans. To our surprise, decreased O-glycan length from naïve to post-GC fates best correlated not with ST3Gal1, but rather downregulation of the Core 2 branching enzyme GCNT1. Thus, our data suggest that O-glycan remodeling is a feature of B cell differentiation, dually regulated by ST3Gal1 and GCNT1, that ultimately results in expression of distinct O-glycosylation states/CD45 glycoforms at each stage of B cell differentiation.",T Lymphocytes Contribute to the Control of Baseline Neural Precursor Cell Proliferation but Not the Exercise-Induced Up-Regulation of Adult Hippocampal Neurogenesis.,https://www.ncbi.nlm.nih.gov/pubmed/30619254,Frontiers in immunology,2019 01 10,"Cross-talk between the peripheral immune system and the central nervous system is important for physiological brain health. T cells are required to maintain normal baseline levels of neural precursor proliferation in the hippocampus of adult mice. We show here that neither T cells, B cells, natural killer cells nor natural killer T cells are required for the increase in hippocampal precursor proliferation that occurs in response to physical exercise. In addition, we demonstrate that a subpopulation of T cells, regulatory T cells, is not involved in maintaining baseline levels of neural precursor proliferation. Even when applied at supraphysiological numbers, populations of both naive and stimulated lymphocytes had no effect on hippocampal precursor proliferation in vitro. In addition, physical activity had no effect on peripheral immune cells in terms of distribution in the bone marrow, lymph nodes or spleen, activation state or chemokine receptor (CXCR4 and CCR9) expression. Together these results suggest that lymphocytes are not involved in translating the peripheral effects of exercise to the neurogenic niche in the hippocampus and further support the idea that the exercise-induced regulation of adult neurogenesis is mechanistically distinct from its baseline control.",Coinfection With Trypanosoma brucei Confers Protection Against Cutaneous Leishmaniasis.,https://www.ncbi.nlm.nih.gov/pubmed/30619253,Frontiers in immunology,2019 01 10,"Infection with certain bacteria, parasites, and viruses alters the host immune system to Leishmania major influencing disease outcome. Here, we determined the outcome of a chronic infection with Trypanosoma brucei brucei on cutaneous leishmaniasis (CL) caused by L. major. C57BL/6 mice infected with T. b. brucei were given a sub-curative treatment with diminazene aceturate then coinfected with L. major by vector bites. Our results revealed that infection with T. b. brucei controls CL pathology. Compared to controls, coinfected mice showed a significant decrease in lesion size (P < 0.05) up to 6 weeks post-infection and a significant decrease in parasite burden (P < 0.0001) at 3 weeks post-infection. Protection against L. major resulted from a non-specific activation of T cells by trypanosomes. This induced a strong immune response characterized by IFN-γ production at the site of bites and systemically, creating a hostile inflammatory environment for L. major parasites and conferring protection from CL.",Chronic Kidney Disease Severity Is Associated With Selective Expansion of a Distinctive Intermediate Monocyte Subpopulation.,https://www.ncbi.nlm.nih.gov/pubmed/30619252,Frontiers in immunology,2019 01 11,"Chronic kidney disease (CKD) affects 11-13% of the world's population and greatly increases risk of atherosclerotic cardiovascular disease (ASCVD) and death. It is characterized by systemic inflammation and disturbances in the blood leukocytes that remain incompletely understood. In particular, abnormalities in the numbers and relative proportions of the three major monocyte subsets-classical, intermediate, and non-classical-are described in CKD and end-stage renal disease. In this study, we characterized absolute numbers of blood leukocyte subtypes in adults with renal function varying from normal to advanced CKD. The primary aim was to identify monocyte subpopulations that associated most closely with current estimated glomerular filtration rate (eGFR) and subsequent rate of eGFR decline. Leucocyte and monocyte populations were enumerated by multi-color flow cytometry of whole blood and peripheral blood mononuclear cell (PBMC) samples from adults with CKD stage 1-5 (n = 154) and healthy adults (n = 33). Multiple-linear regression analyses were performed to identify associations between numbers of leucocyte and monocyte populations and clinical characteristics including eGFR and rate of eGFR decline with adjustment for age and gender. In whole blood, total monocyte and neutrophil, but not lymphocyte, numbers were higher in adults with CKD 1-5 compared to no CKD and were significantly associated with current eGFR even following correction for age. In PBMC, classical and intermediate monocyte numbers were higher in CKD 1-5 but only intermediate monocyte numbers were significantly associated with current eGFR in an age-corrected analysis. When intermediate monocytes were further sub-divided into those with mid- and high-level expression of class II MHC (HLA-DRmid and HLA-DRhi intermediate monocytes) it was found that only DRhi intermediate monocytes were increased in number in CKD 1-5 compared to no CKD and were significantly associated with eGFR independently of age among the total (No CKD + CKD 1-5) study cohort as well as those with established CKD (CKD 1-5 only). Furthermore, blood number of DRhi intermediate monocytes alone proved to be significantly associated with subsequent rate of renal functional decline. Together, our data confirm neutrophil and monocyte subset dysregulation in CKD and identify a distinct subpopulation of intermediate monocytes that is associated with higher rate of loss of kidney function.",Cardioprotection of Ginkgolide B on Myocardial Ischemia/Reperfusion-Induced Inflammatory Injury via Regulation of A20-NF-κB Pathway.,https://www.ncbi.nlm.nih.gov/pubmed/30619251,Frontiers in immunology,2019 01 10,"Inflammation urges most of the characteristics of plaques involved in the pathogenesis of myocardial ischemia/reperfusion injury (MI/RI). In addition, inflammatory signaling pathways not only mediate the properties of plaques that precipitate ischemia/reperfusion (I/R) but also influence the clinical consequences of the post-infarction remodeling and heart failure. Here, we studied whether Ginkgolide B (GB), an effective anti-inflammatory monomer, improved MI/RI via suppression of inflammation. Left anterior descending (LAD) coronary artery induced ischemia/reperfusion (I/R) of rats or A20 silencing mice, as well as hypoxia/reoxygenation (H/R) induced damages of primary cultured rat neonatal ventricular myocytes or A20 silencing ventricular myocytes, respectively, served as MI/RI model in vivo and in vitro to discuss the anti-I/R injury properties of GB. We found that GB significantly alleviated the symptoms of MI/RI evidently by reducing infarct size, preventing ultrastructural changes of myocardium, depressing Polymorphonuclears (PMNs) infiltration, lessening histopathological damage and suppressing the excessive inflammation. Further study demonstrated that GB remarkably inhibited NF-κB p65 subunit translocation, IκB-α phosphorylation, IKK-β activity, as well as the downstream inflammatory cytokines and proteins expressions via zinc finger protein A20. In conclusion, GB could alleviate MI/RI-induced inflammatory response through A20-NF-κB signal pathway, which may give us new insights into the preventive strategies for MI/RI disease.",Cross Type Neutralizing Antibodies Detected in a Unique HIV-2 Infected Individual From India.,https://www.ncbi.nlm.nih.gov/pubmed/30619250,Frontiers in immunology,2019 01 10,"Background: Infection with HIV-2, a retrovirus that is closely related to HIV-1, is characterized by slower disease progression and transmission, longer latency period and low or undetectable viremia. Host immunity, including production of potent neutralizing antibodies, may be one of the possible contributors to the distinction between the two infections. In an attempt to understand whether HIV-2 infection results in production of neutralizing antibodies and to characterize the nature of the neutralization response we screened plasma of 37 HIV-2 infected individuals for the presence of broadly neutralizing antibodies. Materials and Methods: Thirty seven asymptomatic, ART-naïve, HIV-2 infected individuals were recruited for the study. Plasma obtained from these individuals were screened for the presence of broadly cross reactive neutralizing antibodies (BCNabs) using the standard neutralization screening protocol with a panel of HIV-1 and HIV-2 pseudoviruses. Plasma exhibiting broad neutralization activity were assessed for their potency employing a titration assay. Further, an attempt was made to characterize the neutralization specificity of the plasma exhibiting broad and potent neutralization activity. Result: While majority of the samples tested were capable of neutralizing HIV-2 pseudoviruses with high to moderate potency, one unique sample demonstrated broad cross clade and cross type neutralization with ability to strongly neutralize the vast majority of both HIV-1 and HIV-2 viruses tested (19/20). Preliminary analyses indicate the possible presence of antibodies with multiple glycan epitope binding specificities. Conclusion: The study identified a unique HIV-2 sample with exceptional ability to neutralize HIV-2 viruses and cross-neutralize HIV-1 viruses with great breadth and potency. This sample holds promise for isolation of novel monoclonal antibodies that may exploited as potential therapeutic tools for HIV infection.","Butyrate Produced by Commensal Bacteria Down-Regulates Indolamine 2,3-Dioxygenase 1 (IDO-1) Expression via a Dual Mechanism in Human Intestinal Epithelial Cells.",https://www.ncbi.nlm.nih.gov/pubmed/30619249,Frontiers in immunology,2019 01 30,"Commensal bacteria are crucial for the development and maintenance of a healthy immune system therefore contributing to the global well-being of their host. A wide variety of metabolites produced by commensal bacteria are influencing host health but the characterization of the multiple molecular mechanisms involved in host-microbiota interactions is still only partially unraveled. The intestinal epithelial cells (IECs) take a central part in the host-microbiota dialogue by inducing the first microbial-derived immune signals. Amongst the numerous effector molecules modulating the immune responses produced by IECs, indoleamine 2,3-dioxygenase-1 (IDO-1) is essential for gut homeostasis. IDO-1 expression is dependent on the microbiota and despites its central role, how the commensal bacteria impacts its expression is still unclear. Therefore, we investigated the impact of individual cultivable commensal bacteria on IDO-1 transcriptional expression and found that the short chain fatty acid (SCFA) butyrate was the main metabolite controlling IDO-1 expression in human primary IECs and IEC cell-lines. This butyrate-driven effect was independent of the G-protein coupled receptors GPR41, GPR43, and GPR109a and of the transcription factors SP1, AP1, and PPARγ for which binding sites were reported in the IDO-1 promoter. We demonstrated for the first time that butyrate represses IDO-1 expression by two distinct mechanisms. Firstly, butyrate decreases STAT1 expression leading to the inhibition of the IFNγ-dependent and phosphoSTAT1-driven transcription of IDO-1. In addition, we described a second mechanism by which butyrate impairs IDO-1 transcription in a STAT1-independent manner that could be attributed to its histone deacetylase (HDAC) inhibitor property. In conclusion, our results showed that IDO-1 expression is down-regulated by butyrate via a dual mechanism: the reduction of STAT1 level and the HDAC inhibitor property of SCFAs.",β2-Glycoprotein I-Reactive T Cells in Autoimmune Disease.,https://www.ncbi.nlm.nih.gov/pubmed/30619248,Frontiers in immunology,2019 01 10,"Anti-phospholipid syndrome (APS) and systemic lupus erythematosus (SLE) are autoimmune diseases characterized by autoantibody production and autoantibody-related pathology. Anti-phospholipid antibodies (aPL) are found in all patients with APS and in 20-30% of individuals with SLE. aPL recognize a number of autoantigens, but the primary target in both APS and SLE is β2-glycoprotein I (β2GPI). The production of IgG aPL in APS and SLE, as well as the association of aPL with certain MHC class II molecules, has led to investigation of the role of β2GPI-reactive T helper (Th). β2GPI-reactive CD4 Th cells have been associated with the presence of aPL and/or APS in both primary APS and secondary APS associated with SLE, as well as in SLE patients and healthy controls lacking aPL. CD4 T cells reactive with β2GPI have also been associated with atherosclerosis and found within atherosclerotic plaques. In most cases, the epitopes targeted by autoreactive β2GPI-reactive CD4 T cells in APS and SLE appear to arise as a consequence of antigenic processing of β2GPI that is structurally different from the soluble native form. This may arise from molecular interactions (e.g., with phospholipids), post-translational modification (e.g., oxidation or glycation), genetic alteration (e.g., β2GPI variants), or molecular mimicry (e.g., microbiota). A number of T cell epitopes have been characterized, particularly in Domain V, the lipid-binding domain of β2GPI. Possible sources of negatively charged lipid that bind β2GPI include oxidized LDL, activated platelets, microbiota (e.g., gut commensals), and dying (e.g., apoptotic) cells. Apoptotic cells not only bind β2GPI, but also express multiple other cellular autoantigens targeted in both APS and SLE. Dying cells that have bound β2GPI thus provide a rich source of autoantigens that can be recognized by B cells across a wide range of autoantigen specificities. β2GPI-reactive T cells could potentially provide T cell help to autoantigen-specific B cells that have taken up and processed apoptotic (or other dying) cells, and subsequently present β2GPI on their surface in the context of major histocompatibility complex (MHC) class II molecules. Here, we review the literature on β2GPI-reactive T cells, and highlight findings supporting the hypothesis that these T cells drive autoantibody production in both APS and SLE.",DNA-Mediated Interferon Signature Induction by SLE Serum Occurs in Monocytes Through Two Pathways: A Mechanism to Inhibit Both Pathways.,https://www.ncbi.nlm.nih.gov/pubmed/30619247,Frontiers in immunology,2019 01 11,"A primary mechanism for activation of innate immunity is recognition of damage or pathogen associated molecular patterns by pattern recognition receptors (PRRs). Nucleic acid is a damage associated molecular pattern molecule that when internalized into a monocyte and recognized by intracellular nucleic acid sensing toll like receptors will cause production of type 1 interferon. The process by which DNA or RNA is delivered into the cytosol of monocytes in systemic lupus erythematosus remains incompletely understood, and therapeutic approaches to prevent DNA-mediated monocyte activation are needed. We identified two mechanisms for internalization of DNA by monocytes. IgG-bound DNA was internalized by interacting with Fc gamma receptor IIa, while high-mobility group box-1 protein-bound DNA was internalized by interacting with the receptor for advanced glycation end products. Both pathways contribute to an inflammatory phenotype in monocytes exposed to serum from patients with SLE. Moreover, both of these pathways can be inhibited by a pentapeptide, DWEYS, which is a DNA mimetope. In one instance DWEYS directly competes with DNA for antibody binding and in the other DWEYS binds high-mobility group box-1 and blocks its interaction with RAGE. Our data highlight distinct pathways involved in nucleic acid enters monocytes in SLE, and identify a potential therapeutic to prevent nucleic acid internalization in SLE.",Pollen Lipids Can Play a Role in Allergic Airway Inflammation.,https://www.ncbi.nlm.nih.gov/pubmed/30619246,Frontiers in immunology,2019 01 10,"In seed plants, pollen grains carry the male gametes to female structures. They are frequent in the ambient air, and cause airway inflammation in one out of four persons in the population. This was traditionally attributed to soluble glycoproteins, leaking into the nasal mucosa or the conjunctiva, and able to bind antibodies. It is now more and more recognized that also other immunomodulating compounds are present. Lipids bind to Toll-like and PPARγ receptors belonging to antigen-presenting cells in the mammal immune system, activate invariant Natural Killer T-cells, and are able to induce a Type 2 reaction in effector cells. They may also mimic lipid mediators from mammal mast cells. Pollen grains have a rich lipodome of their own. Among the lipids that have been associated with an atopic reaction are saturated and unsaturated fatty acids, glycophospholipids, sphingolipids, sterols, and oxylipids, as well as lipopolysaccharides from the microbiome on the pollen surface. Lipids can be ligands to allergenic proteins."

Many ecological environmental problems have been found in urban river because of the unreasonable use and long-term wastewater discharge. In this study, we explored the bacterial community composition, abundance of 14 antibiotics and 21 antibiotic resistance genes (ARGs), and water environment features in seven water samples and seven sediment samples from Ba River in Xi'an, China. Results showed Proteobacteria and Bacteroidetes were the dominant phyla in all samples, and sediment samples had a higher bacterial diversity and richness than it in water. Bacterial communities of site 5 and 6 were clustered in discrepant patterns compared to those at remaining sites from other samples. It might be influenced by nutrients, heavy metals and antibiotics. Antibiotics concentrations ranged from 1.26 to 1.61 × 103 ng L-1 in water samples and 1.55 to 4.05 × 102 μg kg-1 in sediment samples. Sulfamerazine (SM1) and erythromycin (ERY) were the chief antibiotics in water samples, while the level of oxytetracycline (OTC) and cefazolin (CFZ) were higher in sediment samples. Canonical correspondence analysis showed that trimethoprim (TMP) was significantly related to Acinetobacter in W6, and that SM1 and OTC had positive correlation with Arcobacter in W5. The tetC, blaTEM,ermF and sul1 had higher pollution abundance ranging from 10-4 to 100 copies/16S rRNA gene copies in all samples. Significant correlations were observed between ARGs and matching antibiotics, suggesting that antibiotics can pose the selective pressure on ARGs in this river. In summary, these finding might provide some new data to the limited information available on the bacterial community characteristics, abundance of antibiotics and ARGs in urban river of China.",Specific Effect of Trace Metals on Marine Heterotrophic Microbial Activity and Diversity: Key Role of Iron and Zinc and Hydrocarbon-Degrading Bacteria.,https://www.ncbi.nlm.nih.gov/pubmed/30619234,Frontiers in microbiology,2019 01 10,"Marine microbes are an important control on the biogeochemical cycling of trace metals, but simultaneously, these metals can control the growth of microorganisms and the cycling of major nutrients like C and N. However, studies on the response/limitation of microorganisms to trace metals have traditionally focused on the response of autotrophic phytoplankton to Fe fertilization. Few reports are available on the response of heterotrophic prokaryotes to Fe, and even less to other biogeochemically relevant metals. We performed the first study coupling dark incubations with next generation sequencing to specifically target the functional and phylogenetic response of heterotrophic prokaryotes to Fe enrichment. Furthermore, we also studied their response to Co, Mn, Ni, Zn, Cu (individually and mixed), using surface and deep samples from either coastal or open-ocean waters. Heterotrophic prokaryotic activity was stimulated by Fe in surface open-ocean, as well as in coastal, and deep open-ocean waters (where Zn also stimulated). The most susceptible populations to trace metals additions were uncultured bacteria (e.g., SAR324, SAR406, NS9, and DEV007). Interestingly, hydrocarbon-degrading bacteria (e.g., Thalassolituus, Marinobacter, and Oleibacter) benefited the most from metal addition across all waters (regions/depths) revealing a predominant role in the cycling of metals and organic matter in the ocean.","Genome Sequencing and Pan-Genome Analysis of 23 Corallococcus spp. Strains Reveal Unexpected Diversity, With Particular Plasticity of Predatory Gene Sets.",https://www.ncbi.nlm.nih.gov/pubmed/30619233,Frontiers in microbiology,2019 01 10,"Corallococcus is an abundant genus of predatory soil myxobacteria, containing two species, C. coralloides (for which a genome sequence is available) and C. exiguus. To investigate the genomic basis of predation, we genome-sequenced 23 Corallococcus strains. Genomic similarity metrics grouped the sequenced strains into at least nine distinct genomospecies, divided between two major sub-divisions of the genus, encompassing previously described diversity. The Corallococcus pan-genome was found to be open, with strains exhibiting highly individual gene sets. On average, only 30.5% of each strain's gene set belonged to the core pan-genome, while more than 75% of the accessory pan-genome genes were present in less than four of the 24 genomes. The Corallococcus accessory pan-proteome was enriched for the COG functional category ""Secondary metabolism,"" with each genome containing on average 55 biosynthetic gene clusters (BGCs), of which only 20 belonged to the core pan-genome. Predatory activity was assayed against ten prey microbes and found to be mostly incongruent with phylogeny or BGC complement. Thus, predation seems multifactorial, depending partially on BGC complement, but also on the accessory pan-genome - genes most likely acquired horizontally. These observations encourage further exploration of Corallococcus as a source for novel bioactive secondary metabolites and predatory proteins.",Potential Application of MicroRNA Profiling to the Diagnosis and Prognosis of HIV-1 Infection.,https://www.ncbi.nlm.nih.gov/pubmed/30619232,Frontiers in microbiology,2019 01 10,"MicroRNAs (miRNAs) were first identified in Caenorhabditis briggsae and later recognized as playing pivotal roles in a vast range of cellular activities. It has been shown that miRNAs are an important mechanism not only for host defense against virus but also for the establishment of viral infection. During human immunodeficiency virus type 1 (HIV-1) infection, host miRNA profiles are altered either as a host response against the virus or alternatively as a mechanism for the virus to facilitate viral replication and infection or to maintain latency. The altered miRNA profiles can be detected and quantified by various advanced assays, and potentially serve as more sensitive, accurate and cost-efficient biomarkers for HIV-1 diagnosis and disease progression than those detected by currently available standard clinical assays. Such new biomarkers are critical for optimizing treatment regimens. In this review, we focus on the potential application of miRNA profiling to the diagnosis of HIV-1 infection and the monitoring of disease progression.",Iron Regulation in Clostridioides difficile.,https://www.ncbi.nlm.nih.gov/pubmed/30619231,Frontiers in microbiology,2019 01 10,"The response to iron limitation of several bacteria is regulated by the ferric uptake regulator (Fur). The Fur-regulated transcriptional, translational and metabolic networks of the Gram-positive, pathogen Clostridioides difficile were investigated by a combined RNA sequencing, proteomic, metabolomic and electron microscopy approach. At high iron conditions (15 μM) the C. difficile fur mutant displayed a growth deficiency compared to wild type C. difficile cells. Several iron and siderophore transporter genes were induced by Fur during low iron (0.2 μM) conditions. The major adaptation to low iron conditions was observed for the central energy metabolism. Most ferredoxin-dependent amino acid fermentations were significantly down regulated (had, etf, acd, grd, trx, bdc, hbd). The substrates of these pathways phenylalanine, leucine, glycine and some intermediates (phenylpyruvate, 2-oxo-isocaproate, 3-hydroxy-butyryl-CoA, crotonyl-CoA) accumulated, while end products like isocaproate and butyrate were found reduced. Flavodoxin (fldX) formation and riboflavin biosynthesis (rib) were enhanced, most likely to replace the missing ferredoxins. Proline reductase (prd), the corresponding ion pumping RNF complex (rnf) and the reaction product 5-aminovalerate were significantly enhanced. An ATP forming ATPase (atpCDGAHFEB) of the F0F1-type was induced while the formation of a ATP-consuming, proton-pumping V-type ATPase (atpDBAFCEKI) was decreased. The [Fe-S] enzyme-dependent pyruvate formate lyase (pfl), formate dehydrogenase (fdh) and hydrogenase (hyd) branch of glucose utilization and glycogen biosynthesis (glg) were significantly reduced, leading to an accumulation of glucose and pyruvate. The formation of [Fe-S] enzyme carbon monoxide dehydrogenase (coo) was inhibited. The fur mutant showed an increased sensitivity to vancomycin and polymyxin B. An intensive remodeling of the cell wall was observed, Polyamine biosynthesis (spe) was induced leading to an accumulation of spermine, spermidine, and putrescine. The fur mutant lost most of its flagella and motility. Finally, the CRISPR/Cas and a prophage encoding operon were downregulated. Fur binding sites were found upstream of around 20 of the regulated genes. Overall, adaptation to low iron conditions in C. difficile focused on an increase of iron import, a significant replacement of iron requiring metabolic pathways and the restructuring of the cell surface for protection during the complex adaptation phase and was only partly directly regulated by Fur.",Physical-Chemical Properties of Biogenic Selenium Nanostructures Produced by Stenotrophomonas maltophilia SeITE02 and Ochrobactrum sp. MPV1.,https://www.ncbi.nlm.nih.gov/pubmed/30619230,Frontiers in microbiology,2019 01 10,"Stenotrophomonas maltophilia SeITE02 and Ochrobactrum sp. MPV1 were isolated from the rhizosphere soil of the selenium-hyperaccumulator legume Astragalus bisulcatus and waste material from a dumping site for roasted pyrites, respectively. Here, these bacterial strains were studied as cell factories to generate selenium-nanostructures (SeNS) under metabolically controlled growth conditions. Thus, a defined medium (DM) containing either glucose or pyruvate as carbon and energy source along with selenite () was tested to evaluate bacterial growth, oxyanion bioconversion and changes occurring in SeNS features with respect to those generated by these strains grown on rich media. Transmission electron microscopy (TEM) images show extra- or intra-cellular emergence of SeNS in SeITE02 or MPV1 respectively, revealing the presence of two distinct biological routes of SeNS biogenesis. Indeed, the stress exerted by upon SeITE02 cells triggered the production of membrane vesicles (MVs), which surrounded Se-nanoparticles (SeNPsSeITE02-G_e and SeNPsSeITE02-P_e with average diameter of 179 ± 56 and 208 ± 60 nm, respectively), as highlighted by TEM and scanning electron microscopy (SEM), strongly suggesting that MVs might play a crucial role in the excreting mechanism of the SeNPs in the extracellular environment. On the other hand, MPV1 strain biosynthesized intracellular inclusions likely containing hydrophobic storage compounds and SeNPs (123 ± 32 nm) under pyruvate conditioning, while the growth on glucose as the only source of carbon and energy led to the production of a mixed population of intracellular SeNPs (118 ± 36 nm) and nanorods (SeNRs; average length of 324 ± 89). SEM, fluorescence spectroscopy, and confocal laser scanning microscopy (CLSM) revealed that the biogenic SeNS were enclosed in an organic material containing proteins and amphiphilic molecules, possibly responsible for the high thermodynamic stability of these nanomaterials. Finally, the biogenic SeNS extracts were photoluminescent upon excitation ranging from 380 to 530 nm, whose degree of fluorescence emission (λem = 416-640 nm) was comparable to that from chemically synthesized SeNPs with L-cysteine (L-cys SeNPs). This study offers novel insights into the formation, localization, and release of biogenic SeNS generated by two different Gram-negative bacterial strains under aerobic and metabolically controlled growth conditions. The work strengthens the possibility of using these bacterial isolates as eco-friendly biocatalysts to produce high quality SeNS targeted to possible biomedical applications and other biotechnological purposes.","Bacteria of the Genus Xenorhabdus, a Novel Source of Bioactive Compounds.",https://www.ncbi.nlm.nih.gov/pubmed/30619229,Frontiers in microbiology,2019 01 10,"The genus Xenorhabdus of the family Enterobacteriaceae, are mutualistically associated with entomopathogenic nematodes of the genus Steinernema. Although most of the associations are species-specific, a specific Xenorhabdus sp. may infect more than one Steinernema sp. During the Xenorhabdus-Steinernema life cycle, insect larvae are infected and killed, while both mutualists produce bioactive compounds. These compounds act synergistically to ensure reproduction and proliferation of the nematodes and bacteria. A single strain of Xenorhabdus may produce a variety of antibacterial and antifungal compounds, some of which are also active against insects, nematodes, protozoa, and cancer cells. Antimicrobial compounds produced by Xenorhabdus spp. have not been researched to the same extent as other soil bacteria and they may hold the answer to novel antibacterial and antifungal compounds. This review summarizes the bioactive secondary metabolites produced by Xenorhabdus spp. and their application in disease control. Gene regulation and increasing the production of a few of these antimicrobial compounds are discussed. Aspects limiting future development of these novel bioactive compounds are also pointed out.",Nicosulfuron Degradation by an Ascomycete Fungus Isolated From Submerged Alnus Leaf Litter.,https://www.ncbi.nlm.nih.gov/pubmed/30619225,Frontiers in microbiology,2019 01 10,"Nicosulfuron is a selective herbicide belonging to the sulfonylurea family, commonly applied on maize crops. Its worldwide use results in widespread presence as a contaminant in surface streams and ground-waters. In this study, we isolated, for the first time, the Plectosphaerella cucumerina AR1 nicosulfuron-degrading fungal strain, a new record from Alnus leaf litter submerged in freshwater. The degradation of nicosulfuron by P. cucumerina AR1 was achieved by a co-metabolism process and followed a first-order model dissipation. Biodegradation kinetics analysis indicated that, in planktonic lifestyle, nicosulfuron degradation by this strain was glucose concentration dependent, with a maximum specific degradation rate of 1 g/L in glucose. When grown on natural substrata (leaf or wood) as the sole carbon sources, the Plectosphaerella cucumerina AR1 developed as a well-established biofilm in 10 days. After addition of nicosulfuron in the medium, the biofilms became thicker, with rising mycelium, after 10 days for leaves and 21 days for wood. Similar biofilm development was observed in the absence of herbicide. These fungal biofilms still conserve the nicosulfuron degradation capacity, using the same pathway as that observed with planktonic lifestyle as evidenced by LC-MS analyses. This pathway involved first the hydrolysis of the nicosulfuron sulfonylurea bridge, leading to the production of two major metabolites: 2-amino-4,6-dimethoxypyrimidine (ADMP) and 2-(aminosulfonyl)-N,N-dimethyl-3-pyridinecarboxamide (ASDM). One minor metabolite, identified as 2-(1-(4,6-dimethoxy-pyrimidin-2-yl)-ureido)-N,N-dimethyl-nicotinamide (N3), derived from the cleavage of the C-S bond of the sulfonylurea bridge and contraction by elimination of sulfur dioxide. A last metabolite (N4), detected in trace amount, was assigned to 2-(4,6-dimethoxy-pyrimidin-2-yl)-N,N-dimethyl-nicotinamide (N4), resulting from the hydrolysis of the N3 urea function. Although fungal growth was unaffected by nicosulfuron, its laccase activity was significantly impaired regardless of lifestyle. Leaf and wood surfaces being good substrata for biofilm development in rivers, P. cucumerina AR1 strain could thus have potential as an efficient candidate for the development of methods aiming to reduce contamination by nicosulfuron in aquatic environments.",Identification of Microbial Dark Matter in Antarctic Environments.,https://www.ncbi.nlm.nih.gov/pubmed/30619224,Frontiers in microbiology,2019 01 25,"Numerous studies have applied molecular techniques to understand the diversity, evolution, and ecological function of Antarctic bacteria and archaea. One common technique is sequencing of the 16S rRNA gene, which produces a nearly quantitative profile of community membership. However, the utility of this and similar approaches is limited by what is known about the evolution, physiology, and ecology of surveyed taxa. When representative genomes are available in public databases some of this information can be gleaned from genomic studies, and automated pipelines exist to carry out this task. Here the paprica metabolic inference pipeline was used to assess how well Antarctic microbial communities are represented by the available completed genomes. The NCBI's Sequence Read Archive (SRA) was searched for Antarctic datasets that used one of the Illumina platforms to sequence the 16S rRNA gene. These data were quality controlled and denoised to identify unique reads, then analyzed with paprica to determine the degree of overlap with the closest phylogenetic neighbor with a completely sequenced genome. While some unique reads had perfect mapping to 16S rRNA genes from completed genomes, the mean percent overlap for all mapped reads was 86.6%. When samples were grouped by environment, some environments appeared more or less well represented by the available genomes. For the domain Bacteria, seawater was particularly poorly represented with a mean overlap of 80.2%, while for the domain Archaea glacial ice was particularly poorly represented with an overlap of only 48.0% for a single sample. These findings suggest that a considerable effort is needed to improve the representation of Antarctic microbes in genome sequence databases.",Characterization of Efficiency and Mechanisms of Cold Atmospheric Pressure Plasma Decontamination of Seeds for Sprout Production.,https://www.ncbi.nlm.nih.gov/pubmed/30619223,Frontiers in microbiology,2019 01 10,"The consumption of fresh fruit and vegetable products has strongly increased during the past few decades. However, inherent to all minimally processed products is the short shelf life, and the risk of foodborne diseases, which have been increasingly related to such products in many parts of the world. Because of the favorable conditions for the growth of bacteria during the germination of seeds, sprouts are a frequent source for pathogenic bacteria, thus highlighting the need for seed decontamination to reduce the risk of foodborne illness. Consequently, this study focused on cold atmospheric pressure plasma (CAPP) treatment of artificially inoculated seeds in a diffuse coplanar surface barrier discharge to determine the inactivation efficiency for relevant foodborne pathogens and fungal spores. Plasma treatment of seeds resulted in a highly efficient reduction of microorganisms on the seed surface, while preserving the germination properties of seeds, at least for moderate treatment times. To characterize the mechanisms that contribute to microbial inactivation during plasma treatment, an experimental setup was developed to separate ultraviolet light (UV) and other plasma components. The combination of bacterial viability staining with confocal laser scanning microscopy was used to investigate the impact of ozone and other reactive species on the bacterial cells in comparison to UV. Further characterization of the effect of CAPP on bacterial cells by atomic force microscopy imaging of the same Escherichia coli cells before and after treatment revealed an increase in the surface roughness of treated E. coli cells and a decrease in the average height of the cells, which suggests physical damage to the cell envelope. In conclusion, CAPP shows potential for use as a decontamination technology in the production process of sprouts, which may contribute to food safety and prolonged shelf life of the product."

Representatives of this genus have mainly been isolated from soil, mud, sludge or sewage, and are usually mesophiles. In recent years, the presence of Arthrobacter spp. was also confirmed in various extreme, including permanently cold, environments. In this study, 36 psychrotolerant and metalotolerant Arthrobacter strains isolated from petroleum-contaminated soil from the King George Island (Antarctica), were screened for the presence of plasmids. The identified replicons were thoroughly characterized in order to assess their diversity and role in the adaptation of Arthrobacter spp. to harsh Antarctic conditions. The screening process identified 11 different plasmids, ranging in size from 8.4 to 90.6 kb. A thorough genomic analysis of these replicons detected the presence of numerous genes encoding proteins that potentially perform roles in adaptive processes such as (i) protection against ultraviolet (UV) radiation, (ii) resistance to heavy metals, (iii) transport and metabolism of organic compounds, (iv) sulfur metabolism, and (v) protection against exogenous DNA. Moreover, 10 of the plasmids carry genetic modules enabling conjugal transfer, which may facilitate their spread among bacteria in Antarctic soil. In addition, transposable elements were identified within the analyzed plasmids. Some of these elements carry passenger genes, which suggests that these replicons may be actively changing, and novel genetic modules of adaptive value could be acquired by transposition events. A comparative genomic analysis of plasmids identified in this study and other available Arthrobacter plasmids was performed. This showed only limited similarities between plasmids of Antarctic Arthrobacter strains and replicons of other, mostly mesophilic, isolates. This indicates that the plasmids identified in this study are novel and unique replicons. In addition, a thorough meta-analysis of 247 plasmids of psychrotolerant bacteria was performed, revealing the important role of these replicons in the adaptation of their hosts to extreme environments.",Genomic and in-situ Transcriptomic Characterization of the Candidate Phylum NPL-UPL2 From Highly Alkaline Highly Reducing Serpentinized Groundwater.,https://www.ncbi.nlm.nih.gov/pubmed/30619209,Frontiers in microbiology,2019 01 10,"Serpentinization is a process whereby water interacts with reduced mantle rock called peridotite to produce a new suite of minerals (e.g., serpentine), a highly alkaline fluid, and hydrogen. In previous reports, we identified abundance of microbes of the candidate phylum NPL-UPA2 in a serpentinization site called The Cedars. Here, we report the first metagenome assembled genome (MAG) of the candidate phylum as well as the in-situ gene expression. The MAG of the phylum NPL-UPA2, named Unc8, is only about 1 Mbp and its biosynthetic properties suggest it should be capable of independent growth. In keeping with the highly reducing niche of Unc8, its genome encodes none of the known oxidative stress response genes including superoxide dismutases. With regard to energy metabolism, the MAG of Unc8 encodes all enzymes for Wood-Ljungdahl acetogenesis pathway, a ferredoxin:NAD+ oxidoreductase (Rnf) and electron carriers for flavin-based electron bifurcation (Etf, Hdr). Furthermore, the transcriptome of Unc8 in the waters of The Cedars showed enhanced levels of gene expression in the key enzymes of the Wood-Ljungdahl pathway [e.g., Carbon monoxide dehydrogenase /Acetyl-CoA synthase complex (CODH/ACS), Rnf, Acetyl-CoA synthetase (Acd)], which indicated that the Unc8 is an acetogen. However, the MAG of Unc8 encoded no well-known hydrogenase genes, suggesting that the energy metabolism of Unc8 might be focused on CO as the carbon and energy sources for the acetate formation. Given that CO could be supplied via abiotic reaction associated with deep subsurface serpentinization, while available CO2 would be at extremely low concentrations in this high pH environment, CO-associated metabolism could provide advantageous approach. The CODH/ACS in Unc8 is a Bacteria/Archaea hybrid type of six-subunit complex and the electron carriers, Etf and Hdr, showed the highest similarity to those in Archaea, suggesting that archaeal methanogenic energy metabolism was incorporated into the bacterial acetogenesis in NPL-UPA2. Given that serpentinization systems are viewed as potential habitats for early life, and that acetogenesis via the Wood-Ljungdahl pathway is proposed as an energy metabolism of Last Universal Common Ancestor, a phylogenetically distinct acetogen from an early earth analog site may provide important insights in primordial lithotrophs and their habitat.",Evaluation of a Novel MALDI Biotyper Algorithm to Distinguish Mycobacterium intracellulare From Mycobacterium chimaera.,https://www.ncbi.nlm.nih.gov/pubmed/30619208,Frontiers in microbiology,2019 01 10,"Accurate and timely mycobacterial species identification is imperative for successful diagnosis, treatment, and management of disease caused by nontuberculous mycobacteria (NTM). The current most widely utilized method for NTM species identification is Sanger sequencing of one or more genomic loci, followed by BLAST sequence analysis. MALDI-TOF MS offers a less expensive and increasingly accurate alternative to sequencing, but the commercially available assays used in clinical mycobacteriology cannot differentiate between Mycobacterium intracellulare and Mycobacterium chimaera, two closely related potentially pathogenic species of NTM that are members of the Mycobacterium avium complex (MAC). Because this differentiation of MAC species is challenging in a diagnostic setting, Bruker has developed an improved spectral interpretation algorithm to differentiate M. chimaera and M. intracellulare based on differential spectral peak signatures. Here, we utilize a set of 185 MAC isolates that have been characterized using rpoB locus sequencing followed by whole genome sequencing in some cases, to test the accuracy of the Bruker subtyper software to identify M. chimaera (n = 49) and M. intracellulare (n = 55). 100% of the M. intracellulare and 82% of the M. chimaera isolates were accurately identified using the MALDI Biotyper algorithm. This subtyper module is available with the MALDI Biotyper Compass software and offers a promising mechanism for rapid and inexpensive species determination for M. chimaera and M. intracellulare.",Genome Mining of Streptomyces sp. YIM 130001 Isolated From Lichen Affords New Thiopeptide Antibiotic.,https://www.ncbi.nlm.nih.gov/pubmed/30619207,Frontiers in microbiology,2019 01 10,"Streptomyces bacteria are recognized as an important source for antibiotics with broad applications in human medicine and animal health. Here, we report the isolation of a new lichen-associating Streptomyces sp. YIM 130001 from the tropical rainforest in Xishuangbanna (Yunnan, China), which displayed antibacterial activity against Bacillus subtilis. The draft genome sequence of this isolate strain revealed 18 putative biosynthetic gene clusters (BGCs) for secondary metabolites, which is an unusually low number compared to a typical streptomycete. Inactivation of a lantibiotic dehydrogenase-encoding gene from the BGC presumed to govern biosynthesis of a thiopeptide resulted in the loss of bioactivity. Using comparative HPLC analysis, two peaks in the chromatogram were identified in the extract from the wild-type strain, which were missing in the extract from the mutant. The compounds corresponding to the identified peaks were purified, and structure of one compound was elucidated using NMR. The compound, designated geninthiocin B, showed high similarity to several 35-membered macrocyclic thiopeptides geninthiocin, Val-geninthiocin and berninamycin A. Bioinformatics analysis of the geninthiocin B BGC revealed its close homology to that of berninamycins.",Dynamics of Gut Microbiome in Giant Panda Cubs Reveal Transitional Microbes and Pathways in Early Life.,https://www.ncbi.nlm.nih.gov/pubmed/30619206,Frontiers in microbiology,2019 01 10,"Adult giant pandas (Ailuropoda melanoleuca) express transitional characteristics in that they consume bamboos, despite their carnivore-like digestive tracts. Their genome contains no cellulolytic enzymes; therefore, understanding the development of the giant panda gut microbiome, especially in early life, is important for decoding the rules underlying gut microbial formation, inheritance and dietary transitions. With deep metagenomic sequencing, we investigated the gut microbiomes of two newborn giant panda brothers and their parents living in Macao, China, from 2016 to 2017. Both giant panda cubs exhibited progressive increases in gut microbial richness during growth, particularly from the 6th month after birth. Enterobacteriaceae dominated the gut microbial compositions in both adult giant pandas and cubs. A total of 583 co-abundance genes (CAGs) and about 79 metagenomic species (MGS) from bacteria or viruses displayed significant changes with age. Seven genera (Shewanella, Oblitimonas, Helicobacter, Haemophilus, Aeromonas, Listeria, and Fusobacterium) showed great importance with respect to gut microbial structural determination in the nursing stage of giant panda cubs. Furthermore, 10 orthologous gene functions and 44 pathways showed significant changes with age. Of the significant pathways, 16 from Escherichia, Klebsiella, Propionibacterium, Lactobacillus, and Lactococcus displayed marked differences between parents and their cubs at birth, while 29 pathways from Escherichia, Campylobacter and Lactobacillus exhibited significant increase in cubs from 6 to 9 months of age. In addition, oxidoreductases, transferases, and hydrolases dominated the significantly changed gut microbial enzymes during the growth of giant panda cubs, while few of them were involved in cellulose degradation. The findings indicated diet-stimulated gut microbiome transitions and the important role of Enterobacteriaceae in the guts of giant panda in early life.",Genomic and Virulence Characterization of Intrauterine Pathogenic Escherichia coli With Multi-Drug Resistance Isolated From Cow Uteri With Metritis.,https://www.ncbi.nlm.nih.gov/pubmed/30619205,Frontiers in microbiology,2019 01 10,"Metritis is a major disease in dairy cows causing animal death, decrease of birth rate, milk production, and economic loss. Antibiotic treatment is generally used to treat such disease but has a high failure rate of 23-35%. The reason for the treatment failure remains unclear, although antibiotic resistance is postulated as one of factors. Our study investigated the prevalence of extended spectrum β-lactamase (ESBL) producing bacteria in uterine samples of cows with metritis and characterized the isolated intrauterine pathogenic Escherichia coli (IUPEC) strains using whole genome sequencing. We found that the cows with metritis we examined had a high percentage of ESBL producing IUPEC with multi-drug resistance including ceftiofur which is commonly used for metritis treatment. The ESBL producing IUPEC strains harbored versatile antibiotic resistance genes conferring resistance against 29 antibiotic classes, suggesting that transmission of these bacteria to other animals and humans may lead to antibiotic treatment failure. Furthermore, these strains had strong adhesion and invasion activity, along with critical virulence factors, indicating that they may cause infectious diseases in not only the uterus, but also in other organs and hosts.","Dairy Cattle, a Potential Reservoir of Human Campylobacteriosis: Epidemiological and Molecular Characterization of Campylobacter jejuni From Cattle Farms.",https://www.ncbi.nlm.nih.gov/pubmed/30619204,Frontiers in microbiology,2019 01 10,"Campylobacter jejuni is a major foodborne pathogen that is increasingly found worldwide and that is transmitted to humans through meat or dairy products. A detailed understanding of the prevalence and characteristics of C. jejuni in dairy cattle farms, which are likely to become sources of contamination, is imperative and is currently lacking. In this study, a total of 295 dairy cattle farm samples from 15 farms (24 visits) in Korea were collected. C. jejuni prevalence at the farm level was 60% (9/15) and at the animal level was 23.8% (68/266). Using the multivariable generalized estimating equation (GEE) model based on farm-environmental factors, we estimated that a high density of cattle and average environmental temperature (7 days prior to sampling) below 24°C affects the presence and survival of C. jejuni in the farm environment. Cattle isolates, together with C. jejuni from other sources (chicken and human), were genetically characterized based on analysis of 10 virulence and survival genes. A total of 19 virulence profile types were identified, with type 01 carrying eight genes (all except hcp and virB11) being the most prevalent. The prevalence of virB11 and hcp was significantly higher in isolates from cattle than in those from other sources (p < 0.05). Multilocus sequence typing (MLST) of C. jejuni isolates from three different sources mainly clustered in the CC-21 and CC-48. Within the CC-21 and CC-48 clusters, cattle isolates shared an indistinguishable pattern with human isolates according to pulsed-field gel electrophoresis (PFGE) and flaA-restriction fragment length polymorphism (RFLP) typing. This suggests that CC-21 and CC-48 C. jejuni from dairy cattle are genetically related to clinical campylobacteriosis isolates. In conclusion, the farm environment influences the presence and survival of C. jejuni, which may play an important role in cycles of cattle re-infection, and dairy cattle represent potential reservoirs of human campylobacteriosis. Thus, environmental management practices could be implemented on cattle farms to reduce the shedding of C. jejuni from cattle, subsequently reducing the potential risk of the spread of cattle-derived C. jejuni to humans through the food chain.","CtsR, the Master Regulator of Stress-Response in Oenococcus oeni, Is a Heat Sensor Interacting With ClpL1.",https://www.ncbi.nlm.nih.gov/pubmed/30619203,Frontiers in microbiology,2019 01 10,"Oenococcus oeni is a lactic acid bacterium responsible for malolactic fermentation of wine. While many stress response mechanisms implemented by O. oeni during wine adaptation have been described, little is known about their regulation. CtsR is the only regulator of stress response genes identified to date in O. oeni. Extensively characterized in Bacillus subtilis, the CtsR repressor is active as a dimer at 37°C and degraded at higher temperatures by a proteolytic mechanism involving two adapter proteins, McsA and McsB, together with the ClpCP complex. The O. oeni genome does not encode orthologs of these adapter proteins and the regulation of CtsR activity remains unknown. In this study, we investigate CtsR function in O. oeni by using antisense RNA silencing in vivo to modulate ctsR gene expression. Inhibition of ctsR gene expression by asRNA leads to a significant loss in cultivability after heat shock (58%) and acid shock (59%) highlighting the key role of CtsR in the O. oeni stress response. Regulation of CtsR activity was studied using a heterologous expression system to demonstrate that O. oeni CtsR controls expression and stress induction of the O. oeni hsp18 gene when produced in a ctsR-deficient B. subtilis strain. Under heat stress conditions, O. oeni CtsR acts as a temperature sensor and is inactivated at growth temperatures above 33°C. Finally, using an E. coli bacterial two-hybrid system, we showed that CtsR and ClpL1 interact, suggesting a key role for ClpL1 in controlling CtsR activity in O. oeni.",Can Sulfate Be the First Dominant Aqueous Sulfur Species Formed in the Oxidation of Pyrite by Acidithiobacillus ferrooxidans?,https://www.ncbi.nlm.nih.gov/pubmed/30619202,Frontiers in microbiology,2019 01 10,"According to the literature, pyrite (FeS2) oxidation has been previously determined to involve thiosulfate as the first aqueous intermediate sulfur product, which is further oxidized to sulfate. In the present study, pyrite oxidation by Acidithiobacillus ferrooxidans was studied using electrochemical and metabolic approaches in an effort to extend existing knowledge on the oxidation mechanism. Due to the small surface area, the reaction rate of a compact pyrite electrode in the form of polycrystalline pyrite aggregate in A. ferrooxidans suspension was very slow at a spontaneously formed high redox potential. The slow rate made it possible to investigate the oxidation process in detail over a term of 100 days. Using electrochemical parameters from polarization curves and levels of released iron, the number of exchanged electrons per pyrite molecule was estimated. The values close to 14 and 2 electrons were determined for the oxidation with and without bacteria, respectively. These results indicated that sulfate was the dominant first aqueous sulfur species formed in the presence of bacteria and elemental sulfur was predominantly formed without bacteria. The stoichiometric calculations are consistent with high iron-oxidizing activities of bacteria that continually keep the released iron in the ferric form, resulting in a high redox potential. The sulfur entity of pyrite was oxidized to sulfate by Fe3+ without intermediate thiosulfate under these conditions. Cell attachment on the corroded pyrite electrode surface was documented although pyrite surface corrosion by Fe3+ was evident without bacterial participation. Attached cells may be important in initiating the oxidation of the pyrite surface to release iron from the mineral. During the active phase of oxidation of a pyrite concentrate sample, the ATP levels in attached and planktonic bacteria were consistent with previously established ATP content of iron-oxidizing cells. No significant upregulation of three essential genes involved in energy metabolism of sulfur compounds was observed in the planktonic cells, which represented the dominant biomass in the pyrite culture. The study demonstrated the formation of sulfate as the first dissolved sulfur species with iron-oxidizing bacteria under high redox potential conditions. Minor aqueous sulfur intermediates may be formed but as a result of side reactions.",Detection of Foodborne Pathogens Using Proteomics and Metabolomics-Based Approaches.,https://www.ncbi.nlm.nih.gov/pubmed/30619201,Frontiers in microbiology,2019 01 10,"Considering the short shelf-life of certain food products such as red meat, there is a need for rapid and cost-effective methods for pathogen detection. Routine pathogen testing in food laboratories mostly relies on conventional microbiological methods which involve the use of multiple selective culture media and long incubation periods, often taking up to 7 days for confirmed identifications. The current study investigated the application of omics-based approaches, proteomics using matrix-assisted laser desorption ionization time-of-flight mass spectrometry (MALDI-ToF MS) and metabolomics using gas chromatography-mass spectrometry (GC-MS), for detection of three red meat pathogens - Listeria monocytogenes, Salmonella enterica and Escherichia coli O157:H7. Species-level identification was achieved within 18 h for S. enterica and E. coli O157:H7 and 30 h for L. monocytogenes using MALDI-ToF MS analysis. For the metabolomics approach, metabolites were extracted directly from selective enrichment broth samples containing spiked meat samples (obviating the need for culturing on solid media) and data obtained using GC-MS were analyzed using chemometric methods. Putative biomarkers relating to L. monocytogenes, S. enterica and E. coli O157:H7 were observed within 24, 18, and 12 h, respectively, of inoculating meat samples. Many of the identified metabolites were sugars, fatty acids, amino acids, nucleosides and organic acids. Secondary metabolites such as cadaverine, hydroxymelatonin and 3,4-dihydroxymadelic acid were also observed. The results obtained in this study will assist in the future development of rapid diagnostic tests for these important foodborne pathogens."

A4B-17 produces secondary metabolites such as 4-hydroxybenzoic acid (4HBA) and esters of 4HBA (parabens). 4HBA is a useful material in the synthesis of the liquid crystal. Parabens are man-made compounds that have been extensively used since the 1920s in the cosmetic, pharmaceutical, and food industries for their effective antimicrobial activity. In this study, we completed the sequencing and annotation of the A4B-17 strain genome and found all genes for glucose utilization and 4HBA biosynthesis. Strain A4B-17 uses the Embden-Meyerhof-Parnas (EMP), hexose monophosphate (HMP), and Entner-Doudoroff (ED) pathways to utilize glucose. Other sugars such as fructose, sucrose, xylose, arabinose, galactose, mannitol, and glycerol supported cell growth and 4HBA synthesis. Reverse transcriptional analysis confirmed that the key genes involved in the glucose metabolism were functional. Paraben concentrations were proportionally increased by adding alcohols to the culture medium, indicating that strain A4B-17 synthesizes the 4HBA and the alcohols separately and an esterification reaction between them is responsible for the paraben synthesis. A gene that codes for a carboxylesterase was proposed to catalyze this reaction. The temperature and NaCl concentration for optimal growth were determined to be 35°C and 22.8 g/L.",Aphicidal Activity of Surfactants Produced by Bacillus atrophaeus L193.,https://www.ncbi.nlm.nih.gov/pubmed/30619189,Frontiers in microbiology,2019 01 10,"The biosurfactants produced by Bacillus atrophaeus L193 was examined by their use in the control of the aphid Rhopalosiphum padi in order to suggest a friendly alternative to chemical pesticides. A screening of different culture media demonstrated the highest biosurfactant production by L193 in TSB supplemented with colloidal chitin. Surfactants, which are produced in large quantities (2.04 g/L), reduce surface tension to 33 mN/m. Electrospray Q-TOFS MS analysis demonstrated that lipopeptides, such as surfactins, fengycins, bacillomycins and iturins, are the predominant metabolites present in biosurfactants produced by strain L193. Treatment with L193 surfactants led to an aphid mortality rate of 59.8% within 24 h. Microscopy analysis showed that these compounds caused insect death by affecting cuticle membranes. An evaluation of aphid feeding activity also demonstrated that aphid feeding capacity is affected by treatment with surfactants. Moreover, microbial cultures of strain L193 and their supernatants also showed high levels of activity against R. padi, which is probably due to the presence of surfactants and hydrolytic enzymes such as proteases and glucanases. This study demonstrates that B. atrophaeus L193 is an effective treatment for plants affected by aphids.",A Phylogeny-Regularized Sparse Regression Model for Predictive Modeling of Microbial Community Data.,https://www.ncbi.nlm.nih.gov/pubmed/30619188,Frontiers in microbiology,2019 01 11,"Fueled by technological advancement, there has been a surge of human microbiome studies surveying the microbial communities associated with the human body and their links with health and disease. As a complement to the human genome, the human microbiome holds great potential for precision medicine. Efficient predictive models based on microbiome data could be potentially used in various clinical applications such as disease diagnosis, patient stratification and drug response prediction. One important characteristic of the microbial community data is the phylogenetic tree that relates all the microbial taxa based on their evolutionary history. The phylogenetic tree is an informative prior for more efficient prediction since the microbial community changes are usually not randomly distributed on the tree but tend to occur in clades at varying phylogenetic depths (clustered signal). Although community-wide changes are possible for some conditions, it is also likely that the community changes are only associated with a small subset of ""marker"" taxa (sparse signal). Unfortunately, predictive models of microbial community data taking into account both the sparsity and the tree structure remain under-developed. In this paper, we propose a predictive framework to exploit sparse and clustered microbiome signals using a phylogeny-regularized sparse regression model. Our approach is motivated by evolutionary theory, where a natural correlation structure among microbial taxa exists according to the phylogenetic relationship. A novel phylogeny-based smoothness penalty is proposed to smooth the coefficients of the microbial taxa with respect to the phylogenetic tree. Using simulated and real datasets, we show that our method achieves better prediction performance than competing sparse regression methods for sparse and clustered microbiome signals.",Deconstructing the Dissimilatory Sulfate Reduction Pathway: Isotope Fractionation of a Mutant Unable of Growth on Sulfate.,https://www.ncbi.nlm.nih.gov/pubmed/30619187,Frontiers in microbiology,2019 01 10,"The sulfur isotope record provides key insight into the history of Earth's redox conditions. A detailed understanding of the metabolisms driving this cycle, and specifically microbial sulfate reduction (MSR), is crucial for accurate paleoenvironmental reconstructions. This includes a precise knowledge of the step-specific sulfur isotope effects during MSR. In this study, we aim at resolving the cellular-level fractionation factor during dissimilatory sulfite reduction to sulfide within MSR, and use this measured isotope effect as a calibration to enhance our understanding of the biochemistry of sulfite reduction. For this, we merge measured isotope effects associated with dissimilatory sulfite reduction with a quantitative model that explicitly links net fractionation, reaction reversibility, and intracellular metabolite levels. The highly targeted experimental aspect of this study was possible by virtue of the availability of a deletion mutant strain of the model sulfate reducer Desulfovibrio vulgaris (strain Hildenborough), in which the sulfite reduction step is isolated from the rest of the metabolic pathway owing to the absence of its QmoABC complex (ΔQmo). This deletion disrupts electron flux and prevents the reduction of adenosine phosphosulfate (APS) to sulfite. When grown in open-system steady-state conditions at 10% maximum growth rate in the presence of sulfite and lactate as electron donor, sulfur isotope fractionation factors averaged -15.9‰ (1 σ = 0.4), which appeared to be statistically indistinguishable from a pure enzyme study with dissimilatory sulfite reductase. We coupled these measurements with an understanding of step-specific equilibrium and kinetic isotope effects, and furthered our mechanistic understanding of the biochemistry of sulfite uptake and ensuing reduction. Our metabolically informed isotope model identifies flavodoxin as the most likely electron carrier performing the transfer of electrons to dissimilatory sulfite reductase. This is in line with previous work on metabolic strategies adopted by sulfate reducers under different energy regimes, and has implications for our understanding of the plasticity of this metabolic pathway at the center of our interpretation of modern and palaeo-environmental records.",CRISPR/Cas9 Genome Editing to Disable the Latent HIV-1 Provirus.,https://www.ncbi.nlm.nih.gov/pubmed/30619186,Frontiers in microbiology,2019 01 11,"HIV-1 infection can be successfully controlled with anti-retroviral therapy (ART), but is not cured. A reservoir of cells harboring transcriptionally silent integrated provirus is able to reestablish replicating infection if ART is stopped. Latently HIV-1 infected cells are rare, but may persist for decades. Several novel strategies have been proposed to reduce the latent reservoir, including DNA sequence targeted CRISPR/Cas9 genome editing of the HIV-1 provirus. A significant challenge to genome editing is the sequence diversity of HIV-1 quasispecies present in patients. The high level of quasispecies diversity will require targeting of multiple sites in the viral genome and personalized engineering of a CRISPR/Cas9 regimen. The challenges of CRISPR/Cas9 delivery to the rare latently infected cells and quasispecies sequence diversity suggest that effective genome editing of every provirus is unlikely. However, recent evidence from post-treatment controllers, patients with controlled HIV-1 viral burden following interruption of ART, suggests a correlation between a reduced number of intact proviral sequences and control of the virus. The possibility of reducing the intact proviral sequences in patients by a genome editing technology remains intriguing, but requires significant advances in delivery to infected cells and identification of effective target sites.",Bradykinin Sequestration by Plasmodium berghei Infected Erythrocytes Conditions B2R Signaling and Parasite Uptake by Fetal Trophoblasts.,https://www.ncbi.nlm.nih.gov/pubmed/30619185,Frontiers in microbiology,2019 01 10,"Plasmodium infection during pregnancy causes placental malfunction reducing fetus sustainability and leading to abortions, stillbirths, low birth weight or premature delivery. Accumulation of infected erythrocytes (IE) in the placenta is a key factor in placental malaria pathogenesis but the role played by fetal trophoblast that contact maternal blood has been neglected. Here we explore the hypothesis that interactions between Plasmodium-IE and fetal trophoblast cells impact on vasoactive alterations underlying placental dysfunction. We screened gene expression of key mediators in vasoactive pathways. We found that mRNA of bradykinin receptor 2 (B2R) and nitric oxide synthase (eNOS), as well as levels of bradykinin (BK), were decreased in late gestation placentas of pregnant Plasmodium berghei-infected mice. Co-culturing mouse trophoblasts with IE down-regulated B2R transcription and interleukin (IL)-6 secretion in a B2R-signaling dependent manner. IE showed increased levels of surface B2R and enhanced capacity to bind BK. We propose that down-regulation of B2R signaling in the course of IE-trophoblast interactions is due to BK sequestration by IE. In corroboration, levels of BK were lower in infected placentas and the positive correlation of B2R gene expression and fetal weight was disrupted by infection. This indicates that deregulation of the BK-B2R pathway is associated to placental dysfunction provoked by malaria infection. We further found that upon inhibition of B2R signaling, trophoblasts engulf IE to a lesser extent and show reduced production of IL-6. Our data suggest that BK sequestration by P. berghei represents a strategy for the parasite to ameliorate the risk of phagocytic capture by down modulating B2R activation.",Relevance of Bacteriophage 933W in the Development of Hemolytic Uremic Syndrome (HUS).,https://www.ncbi.nlm.nih.gov/pubmed/30619183,Frontiers in microbiology,2019 01 10,"Hemolytic uremic syndrome (HUS), principally caused by shiga toxins (Stxs), is associated with Shiga toxin-producing Escherichia coli (STEC) infections. We previously reported Stx2 expression by host cells in vitro and in vivo. As the genes encoding the two Stx subunits are located in bacteriophage genomes, the aim of the current study was to evaluate the role of bacteriophage induction in HUS development in absence of an E. coli O157:H7 genomic background. Mice were inoculated with a non-pathogenic E. coli strain carrying the lysogenic bacteriophage 933W (C600Φ933W), and bacteriophage excision was induced by an antibiotic. The mice died 72 h after inoculation, having developed pathogenic damage typical of STEC infection. As well as renal and intestinal damage, markers of central nervous system (CNS) injury were observed, including aberrant immunolocalization of neuronal nuclei (NeuN) and increased expression of glial fibrillary acidic protein (GFAP). These results show that bacteriophage 933W without an E. coli O157:H7 background is capable of inducing the pathogenic damage associated with STEC infection. In addition, a novel mouse model was developed to evaluate therapeutic approaches focused on the bacteriophage as a new target.",Effect of Acidic Industrial Effluent Release on Microbial Diversity and Trace Metal Dynamics During Resuspension of Coastal Sediment.,https://www.ncbi.nlm.nih.gov/pubmed/30619182,Frontiers in microbiology,2019 01 10,"Both industrial effluent discharge and the resuspension of contaminated marine sediments are important sources of trace metals in seawater which potentially affect marine ecosystems. The aim of this study was to evaluate the impact of the industrial wastewaters having acidic pH (2-3) and containing trace metals on microbial diversity in the coastal ecosystem of the Gulf of Gabès (Tunisia, southern Mediterranean Sea) subjected to resuspension events of marine sediments. Four trace elements (As, Cd, U, and V) were monitored during 10-day sediment resuspension experiments. The highest enrichment in the seawater dissolved phase was observed for Cd followed by U, V, and As. Cd remobilization was improved by indigenous microbial community, while U release was mainly abiotic. Acidic effluent addition impacted both trace metal distribution and microbial diversity, particularly that of the abundant phylum Bacteroidetes. Members of the order Saprospirales were enriched from sediment in natural seawater (initial pH > 8), while the family Flavobacteriaceae was favored by acidified seawater (initial pH < 8). Some Flavobacteriaceae members were identified as dominant species in both initial sediment and experiments with acidic wastewater, in which their relative abundance increased with increasing dissolved Cd levels. It could be therefore possible to consider them as bioindicators of metal pollution and/or acidification in marine ecosystems.",Negative Effects of Copper Oxide Nanoparticles on Carbon and Nitrogen Cycle Microbial Activities in Contrasting Agricultural Soils and in Presence of Plants.,https://www.ncbi.nlm.nih.gov/pubmed/30619181,Frontiers in microbiology,2019 01 10,"Metal-oxide nanoparticles (NPs) such as copper oxide (CuO) NPs offer promising perspectives for the development of novel agro-chemical formulations of pesticides and fertilizers. However, their potential impact on agro-ecosystem functioning still remains to be investigated. Here, we assessed the impact of CuO-NPs (0.1, 1, and 100 mg/kg dry soil) on soil microbial activities involved in the carbon and nitrogen cycles in five contrasting agricultural soils in a microcosm experiment over 90 days. Additionally, in a pot experiment, we evaluated the influence of plant presence on the toxicity of CuO-NPs on soil microbial activities. CuO-NPs caused significant reductions of the three microbial activities measured (denitrification, nitrification, and soil respiration) at 100 mg/kg dry soil, but the low concentrations (0.1 and 1 mg/kg) had limited effects. We observed that denitrification was the most sensitive microbial activity to CuO-NPs in most soil types, while soil respiration and nitrification were mainly impacted in coarse soils with low organic matter content. Additionally, large decreases in heterotrophic microbial activities were observed in soils planted with wheat, even at 1 mg/kg for soil substrate-induced respiration, indicating that plant presence did not mitigate or compensate CuO-NP toxicity for microorganisms. These two experiments show that CuO-NPs can have detrimental effects on microbial activities in soils with contrasting physicochemical properties and previously exposed to various agricultural practices. Moreover, we observed that the negative effects of CuO-NPs increased over time, indicating that short-term studies (hours, days) may underestimate the risks posed by these contaminants in soils.",Chlamydia Persistence: A Survival Strategy to Evade Antimicrobial Effects in-vitro and in-vivo.,https://www.ncbi.nlm.nih.gov/pubmed/30619180,Frontiers in microbiology,2019 01 10,"The Chlamydiaceae comprise a group of highly adapted bacterial pathogens sharing a unique intracellular lifestyle. Three Chlamydia species are pathogenic to humans: Chlamydia trachomatis, Chlamydia pneumoniae, and Chlamydia psittaci. C. trachomatis is the leading bacterial cause of sexually-transmitted infections and infectious blindness worldwide. Chlamydia pneumoniae is a major cause of community-acquired atypical pneumonia. C. psittaci primarily affects psittacine birds and can be transmitted to humans causing psittacosis, a potentially fatal form of pneumonia. As opposed to other bacterial pathogens, the spread of clinically relevant antimicrobial resistance genes does not seem to be a major problem for the treatment of Chlamydia infections. However, when exposed to stressing conditions, like those arising from exposure to antimicrobial stimuli, these bacteria undergo a temporary interruption in their replication cycle and enter a viable but non-cultivable state known as persistence. When the stressing conditions are removed, Chlamydia resumes replication and generation of infectious particles. This review gives an overview of the different survival strategies used by Chlamydia to evade the deleterious effects of penicillin and IFNγ, with a focus on the different models used to study Chlamydia persistence, their contribution to elucidating the molecular basis of this complex phenomenon and their potential implications for studies in animal models of infection."

However, high levels of heme are toxic to bacteria. We have previously shown that excess heme has a growth-inhibitory effect on the Gram-positive foodborne pathogen Listeria monocytogenes, and we have learned that the LhrC1-5 family of small RNAs, together with the two-component system (TCS) LisRK, play a role in the adaptation of L. monocytogenes to heme stress conditions. However, a broader knowledge on how this pathogen responds to heme toxicity is still lacking. Here, we analyzed the global transcriptomic response of L. monocytogenes to heme stress. We found that the response of L. monocytogenes to excess heme is multifaceted, involving various strategies acting to minimize the toxic effects of heme. For example, heme exposure triggers the SOS response that deals with DNA damage. In parallel, L. monocytogenes shuts down the transcription of genes involved in heme/iron uptake and utilization. Furthermore, heme stress resulted in a massive increase in the transcription of a putative heme detoxification system, hrtAB, which is highly conserved in Gram-positive bacteria. As expected, we found that the TCS HssRS is required for heme-mediated induction of hrtAB and that a functional heme efflux system is essential for L. monocytogenes to resist heme toxicity. Curiously, the most highly up-regulated gene upon heme stress was lmo1634, encoding the Listeria adhesion protein, LAP, which acts to promote the translocation of L. monocytogenes across the intestinal barrier. Additionally, LAP is predicted to act as a bifunctional acetaldehyde-CoA/alcohol dehydrogenase. Surprisingly, a mutant lacking lmo1634 grows well under heme stress conditions, showing that LAP is not required for L. monocytogenes to resist heme toxicity. Likewise, a functional ResDE TCS, which contributes to heme-mediated expression of lmo1634, is not required for the adaptation of L. monocytogenes to heme stress conditions. Collectively, this study provides novel insights into the strategies employed by L. monocytogenes to resist heme toxicity. Our findings indicate that L. monocytogenes is using heme as a host-derived signaling molecule to control the expression of its virulence genes, as exemplified by lmo1634.",Traits of Exogenous Species and Indigenous Community Contribute to the Species Colonization and Community Succession.,https://www.ncbi.nlm.nih.gov/pubmed/30619168,Frontiers in microbiology,2019 01 10,"Introducing exogenous species into an environment is an effective method to strengthen ecological functions. The traits of the exogenous species and the indigenous communities, as well as the resistance and subsequent succession of the community to exogenous species, are not well-understood. Here, three different functional consortia were introduced into two extremely acidic systems, leaching heap (LH) and leaching solution (LS), derived from the Zijin copper mine in China. The results showed that the structures of both LS and LH communities were affected by the three consortia, but not all the structural changes were in line with variations of community function. Among the three consortia, only the complementary sulfur oxidizers greatly enhanced copper extraction efficiency of LS (by 50.42%). This demonstrated that functional niche novelty gave exogenous species an advantage to occupy an ecological niche in a complementary manner, thus leading to successful colonization. The resistance to, and subsequent succession by, exogenous organisms varied between the two indigenous communities. More specifically, the LS community with low community diversity and simple composition was susceptible to exogenous species, and the community structural changes of LS were both divergent and irreversible. In comparison, the LH community with greater community diversity and more complex composition was more resistant to exogenous species, with the community structures showing a convergent trend over time despite different species being introduced. Therefore, we propose that diverse communities compete for resources more intensely with exogenous species and resist their introduction, and that communities with complex composition are able to cope with exogenous disturbances.",Effect of Aerosolization and Drying on the Viability of Pseudomonas syringae Cells.,https://www.ncbi.nlm.nih.gov/pubmed/30619167,Frontiers in microbiology,2019 01 10,"Airborne dispersal of microorganisms influences their biogeography, gene flow, atmospheric processes, human health and transmission of pathogens that affect humans, plants and animals. The extent of their impact depends essentially on cell-survival rates during the process of aerosolization. A central factor for cell-survival is water availability prior to and upon aerosolization. Also, the ability of cells to successfully cope with stress induced by drying determines their chances of survival. In this study, we used the ice-nucleation active, plant pathogenic Pseudomonas syringae strain R10.79 as a model organism to investigate the effect of drying on cell survival. Two forms of drying were simulated: drying of cells in small droplets aerosolized from a wet environment by bubble bursting and drying of cells in large droplets deposited on a surface. For drying of cells both in aerosol and surface droplets, the relative humidity (RH) was varied in the range between 10 and 90%. The fraction of surviving cells was determined by live/dead staining followed by flow cytometry. We also evaluated the effect of salt concentration in the water droplets on the survival of drying cells by varying the ionic strength between 0 and 700 mM using NaCl and sea salt. For both aerosol and surface drying, cell survival increased with decreasing RH (p < 0.01), and for surface drying, survival was correlated with increasing salt concentration (p < 0.001). Imaging cells with TEM showed shrunk cytoplasm and cell wall damage for a large fraction of aerosolized cells. Ultimately, we observed a 10-fold higher fraction of surviving cells when dried as aerosol compared to when dried on a surface. We conclude that the conditions, under which cells dry, significantly affect their survival and thus their success to spread through the atmosphere and colonize new environments as well as their ability to affect atmospheric processes.",Aspartic Acid Residue 51 of SaeR Is Essential for Staphylococcus aureus Virulence.,https://www.ncbi.nlm.nih.gov/pubmed/30619166,Frontiers in microbiology,2019 01 11,"Staphylococcus aureus is a common Gram-positive bacteria that is a major cause of human morbidity and mortality. The SaeR/S two-component sensory system of S. aureus is important for virulence gene transcription and pathogenesis. However, the influence of SaeR phosphorylation on virulence gene transcription is not clear. To determine the importance of potential SaeR phosphorylation sites for S. aureus virulence, we generated genomic alanine substitutions at conserved aspartic acid residues in the receiver domain of the SaeR response regulator in clinically significant S. aureus pulsed-field gel electrophoresis (PFGE) type USA300. Transcriptional analysis demonstrated a dramatic reduction in the transcript abundance of various toxins, adhesins, and immunomodulatory proteins for SaeR with an aspartic acid to alanine substitution at residue 51. These findings corresponded to a significant decrease in cytotoxicity against human erythrocytes and polymorphonuclear leukocytes, the ability to block human myeloperoxidase activity, and pathogenesis during murine soft-tissue infection. Analysis of SaeR sequences from over 8,000 draft S. aureus genomes revealed that aspartic acid residue 51 is 100% conserved. Collectively, these results demonstrate that aspartic acid residue 51 of SaeR is essential for S. aureus virulence and underscore a conserved target for novel antimicrobial strategies that treat infection caused by this pathogen.",A Fluorescence Based-Proliferation Assay for the Identification of Replicating Bacteria Within Host Cells.,https://www.ncbi.nlm.nih.gov/pubmed/30619165,Frontiers in microbiology,2019 01 10,"Understanding host pathogen interactions is paramount to the development of novel antimicrobials. An important facet of this pursuit is the accurate characterization of pathogen replication within infected host cells. Here we describe the use of a fluorescence-based proliferation assay to identify intracellular populations of replicating bacteria at the subcellular level. Using Staphylococcus aureus as a model Gram-positive bacterial pathogen and macrophages as a model host phagocyte, we demonstrate this assay can be used to reliably identify individual phagocytes that contain replicating bacteria. Furthermore, we demonstrate this assay is compatible with additional cellular probes that enable characterization of cellular compartments in which replicating bacteria reside. Finally, we demonstrate that this assay facilitates the investigation of both Gram-negative and Gram-positive bacteria within host cells.",Quantitative Phosphoproteome Analysis of Clostridioides difficile Toxin B Treated Human Epithelial Cells.,https://www.ncbi.nlm.nih.gov/pubmed/30619164,Frontiers in microbiology,2019 01 10,"The large clostridial glucosylating toxin B (TcdB) is a major virulence factor of the nosocomial pathogen Clostridioides difficile. TcdB inhibits small GTPases by glucosylation leading to impaired downstream signaling. TcdB also possesses a glucosyltransferase independent effect described as pyknosis. To elucidate the impact of TcdB and its glucosylation-inactive mutant TcdBNXN on the kinome of human cells, SILAC labeled HEp-2 cells were treated with 2 nM TcdB for 8 h. Phosphopeptides were enriched using SCX chromatography, IMAC and TiO2 followed shotgun mass spectrometry analysis. Overall 4,197 phosphopeptides were identified; more than 1,200 phosphosites responded to treatment with TcdB or TcdBNXN. The data suggested that predominantly stress-activated MAPK-dependent signaling pathways were triggered by toxin B treatment.",Biochemical Characterization and Phylogenetic Analysis of the Virulence Factor Lysine Decarboxylase From Vibrio vulnificus.,https://www.ncbi.nlm.nih.gov/pubmed/30619163,Frontiers in microbiology,2019 01 10,"Cadaverine is produced in organisms from the amino acid lysine in a decarboxylation reaction catalyzed by lysine decarboxylase (EC 4.1.1.18). The inducible lysine decarboxylase CadA plays a vital role in acid stress response for enteric bacteria. Vibrio vulnificus is an extremely virulent human pathogen causing gastroenteritis when the acid conditions that prevent survival of V. vulnificus in the stomach or small intestine are overcome. A gene encoding CadA was identified from V. vulnificus. Subsequent analyses showed that CadA from V. vulnificus (VvCadA) is a decamer with a 82-kDa subunit. Homogenous VvCadA was purified from Escherichia coli and used for lysine decarboxylation with an optimal pH of 6.0 and optimal temperature of 37°C. The apparent Vmax and Km for lysine were 9.45 ± 0.24 μM/min and 0.45 ± 0.05 mM, respectively. Mutation analysis suggested that the amino-acid-binding pyridoxal phosphate, the cofactor of the enzyme, plays a vital role in the reaction. Mutation of the negatively charged residues interacting with lysine also affected the activity of the enzyme to some extent. Quantitative RT-PCR showed that expression of VvcadA was up-regulated under low pH, low salinity, and oxidative stresses. Furthermore, the concentration of cadaverine released to the cell exterior also increased under these stresses. Protein sequence similarity network (SSN) analysis indicated that lysine decarboxylases with ornithine decarboxylases and arginine decarboxylases shared a common ancestor, and that lysine decarboxylases are more conserved during evolution. Our data provide evidence for the biochemical characteristics and important roles of VvCadA under stress conditions.",AU-Rich Long 3' Untranslated Region Regulates Gene Expression in Bacteria.,https://www.ncbi.nlm.nih.gov/pubmed/30619162,Frontiers in microbiology,2019 01 10,"3' untranslated regions (3' UTRs) and particularly long 3' UTRs have been shown to act as a new class of post-transcriptional regulatory element. We previously reported that hmsT mRNA stability is negatively regulated by the 3' UTR of hmsT in Yersinia pestis. To investigate more general effects of 3' UTRs in Y. pestis, we selected 15 genes potentially possessing long 3' UTRs with different AU content and constructed their 3' UTR deletion mutants. Deletion of AU-rich 3' UTRs increased mRNA levels, whereas deletion of 3' UTRs with normal AU content resulted in slight or no changes in the mRNA level. In addition, we found that PNPase was important for 3' UTR-mediated mRNA decay when the transcriptional terminator was Rho-dependent. Finally, we showed that ribosomes promote mRNA stability when bound to a 3' UTR. Our findings suggest that functional 3' UTRs might be broadly distributed in bacteria and their novel regulatory mechanisms require further investigation.",Microbial Synthesis and Transformation of Inorganic and Organic Chlorine Compounds.,https://www.ncbi.nlm.nih.gov/pubmed/30619161,Frontiers in microbiology,2019 01 19,"Organic and inorganic chlorine compounds are formed by a broad range of natural geochemical, photochemical and biological processes. In addition, chlorine compounds are produced in large quantities for industrial, agricultural and pharmaceutical purposes, which has led to widespread environmental pollution. Abiotic transformations and microbial metabolism of inorganic and organic chlorine compounds combined with human activities constitute the chlorine cycle on Earth. Naturally occurring organochlorines compounds are synthesized and transformed by diverse groups of (micro)organisms in the presence or absence of oxygen. In turn, anthropogenic chlorine contaminants may be degraded under natural or stimulated conditions. Here, we review phylogeny, biochemistry and ecology of microorganisms mediating chlorination and dechlorination processes.

Important findings based on model iZBM1060 and its predictions are as follows: (i) The extracellular polysaccharide (EPS) biosynthetic pathway was elucidated completely. (ii) A new fermentation strategy is proposed: addition of phenylalanine increased EPS production by 32.80% in simulations and by 38.00% in experiments. (iii) Eight genes for key enzymes were proposed for EPS overproduction. Model iZBM1060 provides a useful platform for regulating EPS production in terms of system metabolic engineering for G. lucidum, as well as a guide for future metabolic pathway construction of other high value-added edible/ medicinal mushroom species."

Although Lactobacillus are the predominant strains in fermented doughs, such as sourdoughs, and non-nixtamalized fermented maize foods, the pozol microbiota is markedly different. This may be the result of the nixtamalization process, which could act as a selective force of some strains. Sii-25124 has been reported as the main amylolytic LAB in pozol; starch is the primary carbon source on nixtamal since monosaccharides and disaccharides are lost during nixtamalization; however, non-amylolytic LAB counts are higher than amylolytic LAB in pozol after 24-h fermentation suggesting that another carbon source is being used by the former bacteria. Hemicellulose (arabinoxylan in maize) becomes available via nixtamalization and is subsequently metabolized by LAB. The aim of this work was to determine whether this bacterium is able to use arabinoxylan as the only carbon source in a defined medium containing arabinoxylan extracted from either nejayote (wash water produced during nixtamal preparation), or beechwood xylan. Xylanase activity in the presence of nejayote arabinoxylan (135.8 ± 48.7 IU/mg protein) was higher than that of beechwood (62.5 ± 19.8 IU/mg protein). Other enzymatic activities, such as arabinofuranosidase and acetyl esterase, were also detected, suggesting the adaptation of the bacterium studied to nixtamal dough. It was concluded that Streptococcus infantarius 25124 isolated from pozol was able to use arabinoxylans, which are present in nixtamal dough, so fermentation does not depend exclusively on free sugars and starch.",Differences in the Characteristics and Pathogenicity of Colletotrichum camelliae and C. fructicola Isolated From the Tea Plant [Camellia sinensis (L.) O. Kuntze].,https://www.ncbi.nlm.nih.gov/pubmed/30619146,Frontiers in microbiology,2019 01 10,"Colletotrichum, the causative agent of anthracnose, is an important pathogen that invades the tea plant (Camellia sinensis). In this study, 38 isolates were obtained from the diseased leaves of tea plants collected in different areas of Zhejiang Province, China. A combination of multigene (ITS, ACT, GAPDH, TUB2, CAL, and GS) and morphology analyses showed that the 38 strains belonged to two different species, namely, C. camelliae (CC), and C. fructicola (CF). Pathogenicity tests revealed that CC was more invasive than CF. In vitro inoculation experiments demonstrated that CC formed acervuli at 72 hpi and developed appressoria on wound edges, but CF did not develop these structures. Under treatment with catechins and caffeine, the growth inhibition rates of CF were remarkably higher than those of CC, indicating that the nonpathogenic species CF was more vulnerable to catechins and caffeine. Growth condition testing indicated that CF grew at a wide temperature range of 15-35°C and that the optimum temperature for CC growth was 25°C. Growth of both CC and CF did not differ between acidic and weakly alkaline environments (pH 5-8), but the growth of CC was significantly reduced at pH values of 9 and 10. Furthermore, the PacC/RIM101 gene, which associated with pathogenicity, was identified from CC and CF genomes, and its expression was suppressed in the hyphae of both species under pH value of 5 and 10, and much lower expression level was detected in CC than that in CF at pH 6. These results indicated that temperature has more important effect than pH for the growth of two Colletotrichum species. In conclusion, the inhibition by secondary metabolite is an important reason why the pathogenicity by CC and CF are different to tea plant, although the environmental factors including pH and temperature effect the growth of two Colletotrichum species.","Genomic and Genetic Insights Into a Cosmopolitan Fungus, Paecilomyces variotii (Eurotiales).",https://www.ncbi.nlm.nih.gov/pubmed/30619145,Frontiers in microbiology,2019 01 10,"Species in the genus Paecilomyces, a member of the fungal order Eurotiales, are ubiquitous in nature and impact a variety of human endeavors. Here, the biology of one common species, Paecilomyces variotii, was explored using genomics and functional genetics. Sequencing the genome of two isolates revealed key genome and gene features in this species. A striking feature of the genome was the two-part nature, featuring large stretches of DNA with normal GC content separated by AT-rich regions, a hallmark of many plant-pathogenic fungal genomes. These AT-rich regions appeared to have been mutated by repeat-induced point (RIP) mutations. We developed methods for genetic transformation of P. variotii, including forward and reverse genetics as well as crossing techniques. Using transformation and crossing, RIP activity was identified, demonstrating for the first time that RIP is an active process within the order Eurotiales. A consequence of RIP is likely reflected by a reduction in numbers of genes within gene families, such as in cell wall degradation, and reflected by growth limitations on P. variotii on diverse carbon sources. Furthermore, using these transformation tools we characterized a conserved protein containing a domain of unknown function (DUF1212) and discovered it is involved in pigmentation.","Cell Wall Synthesis, Development of Hyphae and Metabolic Pathways Are Processes Potentially Regulated by MicroRNAs Produced Between the Morphological Stages of Paracoccidioides brasiliensis.",https://www.ncbi.nlm.nih.gov/pubmed/30619144,Frontiers in microbiology,2019 01 10,"MicroRNAs are molecules involved in post-transcriptional gene regulation. In pathogenic fungi, microRNAs have been described at different morphological stages by regulating targets involved in processes such as morphogenesis and energy production. Members of the Paracoccidioides complex are the main etiological agents of a systemic mycosis in Latin America. Fungi of the Paracoccidioides complex present a wide range of plasticity to colonize different niches. In response to environmental changes these fungi undergo a morphological switch, remodel their cellular metabolism and modulate structural cell wall components. However, the underlying mechanisms regulating the gene expression is not well understood. By using high performance sequencing and bioinformatics analyses, this work characterizes microRNAs produced by Paracoccidioides brasiliensis. Here, we demonstrated that the transcript encoding proteins involved in microRNA biogenesis were differentially expressed in each morphological stage. In addition, 49 microRNAs were identified in cDNA libraries with 44 differentially regulated among the libraries. Sixteen microRNAs were differentially regulated in comparison to the mycelium in the mycelium-to-yeast transition phase. The yeast parasitic phase revealed a complete remodeling of the expression of these small RNAs. Analyses of targets of the induced microRNAs, from the different libraries, revealed that these molecules may potentially regulate in the cell wall, by repressing genes involved in the synthesis and degradation of glucans and chitin. Furthermore, mRNAs involved in cellular metabolism and development were predicted to be regulated by microRNAs. Therefore, this work describes a putative post transcriptional regulation, mediated by microRNAs in P. brasiliensis and its influence on the adaptive processes of thermal dimorphic fungus.",Evolution of the Population Structure of Staphylococcus pseudintermedius in France.,https://www.ncbi.nlm.nih.gov/pubmed/30619143,Frontiers in microbiology,2019 01 10,"Staphylococcus pseudintermedius is a colonizer as well as an important pathogen of dogs where it is responsible for skin, ear and post-operative infections. The emergence of methicillin-resistant S. pseudintermedius (MRSP) in the early 2000s, which were additionally resistant to most veterinary-licensed antibiotics, drew specific attention to these pathogens due to the limitations created in veterinary therapeutic options. Multiple studies showed that the sequence type (ST)71 was the most frequently identified clone in Europe. A few years ago, several publications have suggested a decline of the ST71 clone and the emergence of the ST258 lineage in Northern Europe. In this study, we show that ST71 is also decreasing over time in France and that the non-ST71 population is highly heterogeneous. Globally, the non-ST71 clones are more susceptible to antibiotics, which might be good news for veterinarians. Two other lineages, ST258 and ST496, seem to be successful in France. These isolates, as well as representatives of the ST71 clone, underwent whole-genome sequence. This study shows that the ST71 and ST496 clusters are highly homogenous while the ST258 cluster is more diverse. Each ST possesses a specific pattern of resistance and virulence genes. The reasons for the apparent and simultaneous success of the ST258 and ST496 clones remain unclear. But the emergence of the ST496 clone will require monitoring given its multi-resistant genotype and threat to canine health.",Family A DNA Polymerase Phylogeny Uncovers Diversity and Replication Gene Organization in the Virioplankton.,https://www.ncbi.nlm.nih.gov/pubmed/30619142,Frontiers in microbiology,2019 01 11,"Shotgun metagenomics, which allows for broad sampling of viral diversity, has uncovered genes that are widely distributed among virioplankton populations and show linkages to important biological features of unknown viruses. Over 25% of known dsDNA phage carry the DNA polymerase I (polA) gene, making it one of the most widely distributed phage genes. Because of its pivotal role in DNA replication, this enzyme is linked to phage lifecycle characteristics. Previous research has suggested that a single amino acid substitution might be predictive of viral lifestyle. In this study Chesapeake Bay virioplankton were sampled by shotgun metagenomic sequencing (using long and short read technologies). More polA sequences were predicted from this single viral metagenome (virome) than from 86 globally distributed virome libraries (ca. 2,100, and 1,200, respectively). The PolA peptides predicted from the Chesapeake Bay virome clustered with 69% of PolA peptides from global viromes; thus, remarkably the Chesapeake Bay virome captured the majority of known PolA peptide diversity in viruses. This deeply sequenced virome also expanded the diversity of PolA sequences, increasing the number of PolA clusters by 44%. Contigs containing polA sequences were also used to examine relationships between phylogenetic clades of PolA and other genes within unknown viral populations. Phylogenic analysis revealed five distinct groups of phages distinguished by the amino acids at their 762 (Escherichia coli IAI39 numbering) positions and replication genes. DNA polymerase I sequences from Tyr762 and Phe762 groups were most often neighbored by ring-shaped superfamily IV helicases and ribonucleotide reductases (RNRs). The Leu762 groups had non-ring shaped helicases from superfamily II and were further distinguished by an additional helicase gene from superfamily I and the lack of any identifiable RNR genes. Moreover, we found that the inclusion of ribonucleotide reductase associated with PolA helped to further differentiate phage diversity, chiefly within lytic podovirus populations. Altogether, these data show that DNA Polymerase I is a useful marker for observing the diversity and composition of the virioplankton and may be a driving factor in the divergence of phage replication components.","Rhizosphere Microbial Communities of Spartina alterniflora and Juncus roemerianus From Restored and Natural Tidal Marshes on Deer Island, Mississippi.",https://www.ncbi.nlm.nih.gov/pubmed/30619140,Frontiers in microbiology,2019 01 11,"The U. S. Gulf of Mexico is experiencing a dramatic increase in tidal marsh restoration actions, which involves planting coastal areas with smooth cordgrass (Spartina alterniflora) and black needlerush (Juncus roemerianus) for erosion control and to provide habitat for fish and wildlife. It can take decades for sedimentary cycles in restored marshes to approach reference conditions, and the contribution of the sediment microbial communities to these processes is poorly elucidated. In this study, we addressed this gap by comparing rhizosphere microbiomes of S. alterniflora and J. roemerianus from two restored marshes and a natural reference marsh located at Deer Island, MS. Our results revealed that plants from the restored and reference areas supported similar microbial diversity indicating the rapid colonization of planted grasses with indigenous soil microbiota. Although close in composition, the microbial communities from the three studied sites differed significantly in the relative abundance of specific taxa. The observed differences are likely driven by the host plant identity and properties of sediment material used for the creation of restored marshes. Some of the differentially distributed groups of bacteria include taxa involved in the cycling of carbon, nitrogen, and sulfur, and may influence the succession of vegetation at the restored sites to climax condition. We also demonstrated that plants from the restored and reference sites vary in the frequency of culturable rhizobacteria that exhibit traits commonly associated with the promotion of plant growth and suppression of phytopathogenic fungi. Our findings will contribute to the establishment of benchmarks for the assessment of the outcome of coastal restoration projects in the Gulf of Mexico and better define factors that affect the long-term resiliency of tidal marshes and their vulnerability to climate change.",Microbiota Changes in the Musk Gland of Male Forest Musk Deer During Musk Maturation.,https://www.ncbi.nlm.nih.gov/pubmed/30619139,Frontiers in microbiology,2019 01 10,"The musk gland in an adult male forest musk deer is an organ that synthesizes, stores, and secretes musk, a cream-colored liquid upon initial secretion that gradually transforms into a blackish-brown solid substance upon full maturation. In this study, four healthy adult male forest musk deer were selected and a total of 12 musk samples were collected for analysis. The samples were in three different states depending on the different seasonal collection dates, which were in June, August, and October. High-throughput 16S-rRNA gene sequencing technology was used to detect microbiota changes in the gland. The results indicate that microbial richness gradually declined during the musk maturation process. The microbiota composition between the initial liquid and final solid musk samples was varied significantly (P < 0.05). The dominant bacterial phyla were similar at all three stages included Firmicutes, Proteobacteria, Actinobacteria, and Bacteroidetes. However, the abundances were differences in terms of the dominant bacterial genera. PICRUSt analysis showed the highest represented category was ""Amino acid transport and metabolism"" (24.8%), followed by ""Transcription"" (22.04%), and ""Carbohydrate transport and metabolism"" (20.74%). Our findings indicate that the microbiota in the musk gland plays an important role in the maturation process of musk.","Mutagenesis of PhaR, a Regulator Gene of Polyhydroxyalkanoate Biosynthesis of Xanthomonas oryzae pv. oryzae Caused Pleiotropic Phenotype Changes.",https://www.ncbi.nlm.nih.gov/pubmed/30619137,Frontiers in microbiology,2019 01 10,"Polyhydroxyalkanoates (PHAs) are intracellular carbon and energy storage materials produced in various microorganisms under nutrient-limited conditions. PhaR is a regulatory protein involved in PHA synthesis. Xanthomonas oryzae pv. oryzae (Xoo) is one of the most important bacterial pathogens in rice and has PHA biosynthesis genes in its genome, but the biological function of phaR in Xoo is unknown. In this study, we investigated the effects of the mutagenesis of phaR gene in Xoo strain PXO99A. Compared to the wildtype, the PhaR gene knock-out mutant PXO99ΔphaR was hypermotile and showed decreased growth rates in both rich and limited nutrient media. PXO99ΔphaR also showed almost 75% decrease in extracellular polysaccharide (EPS) production. When inoculated in rice leaves by leaf-clipping method, PXO99ΔphaR displayed reduced virulence in terms of lesion length and bacterial multiplication compared with the wildtype strain. PXO99ΔphaR also showed enhanced hypersensitive response (HR) induction in the leaves of non-host Nicotiana benthamiana with elevated hpa1 gene expression. Introduction of a cosmid containing the phaR coding sequence restored the phenotypes of the mutant to those of the wildtype strain. These results suggest that PhaR gene is an important gene that affects multiple bacterial characteristics, including EPS production, growth rate, defense response induced harpin production and motility, related to its virulence in plant.",Gut Microbiota Is a Major Contributor to Adiposity in Pigs.,https://www.ncbi.nlm.nih.gov/pubmed/30619136,Frontiers in microbiology,2019 01 10,"Different breeds of pigs vary greatly in their propensity for adiposity. Gut microbiota is known to play an important role in modulating host physiology including fat metabolism. However, the relative contribution of gut microbiota to lipogenic characteristics of pigs remains elusive. In this study, we transplanted fecal microbiota of adult Jinhua and Landrace pigs, two breeds of pigs with distinct lipogenic phenotypes, to antibiotic-treated mice. Our results indicated that, 4 weeks after fecal transplantation, the mice receiving Jinhua pigs' ""obese"" microbiota (JM) exhibited a different intestinal bacterial community structure from those receiving Landrace pigs' ""lean"" microbiota (LM). Notably, an elevated ratio of Firmicutes to Bacteroidetes and a significant diminishment of Akkermansia were observed in JM mice relative to LM mice. Importantly, mouse recipients resembled their respective porcine donors in many of the lipogenic characteristics. Similar to Jinhua pig donors, JM mice had elevated lipid and triglyceride levels and the lipoprotein lipase activity in the liver. Enhanced expression of multiple key lipogenic genes and reduced angiopoietin-like 4 (Angptl4) mRNA expression were also observed in JM mice, relative to those in LM mice. These results collectively suggested that gut microbiota of Jinhua pigs is more capable of enhancing lipogenesis than that of Landrace pigs. Transferability of the lipogenic phenotype across species further indicated that gut microbiota plays a major role in contributing to adiposity in pigs. Manipulation of intestinal microbiota will, therefore, have a profound impact on altering host metabolism and adipogenesis, with an important implication in the treatment of human overweight and obesity."

This is especially true for the physiologically complex actinobacteria. Here we report the development of a robust gene deletions system for Streptomyces lividans TK24 based on a BAC library combined with the λ-Red recombination technique. The developed system was validated by systematically deleting the most highly expressed genes encoding alternative sigma factors and several other regulatory genes within the chromosome of S. lividans TK24. To demonstrate the possibility of large scale genomic manipulations, the major part of the undecylprodigiosin gene cluster was deleted as well. The resulting mutant strains were characterized in terms of morphology, growth parameters, secondary metabolites production and response to thiol-oxidation and cell-wall stresses. Deletion of SLIV_12645 gene encoding S. coelicolor SigR1 ortholog has the most prominent phenotypic effect, resulted in overproduction of actinorhodin and coelichelin P1 and increased sensitivity to diamide. The secreted proteome analysis of SLIV_12645 mutant revealed SigR1 influence on trafficking of proteins involved in cell wall biogenesis and refactoring. The reported here gene deletion system will further facilitate work on S. lividans strain improvement as a host for either secondary metabolites or protein production and will contribute to basic research in streptomycetes physiology, morphological development, secondary metabolism. On the other hand, the systematic deletion of sigma factors encoding genes demonstrates the complexity and conservation of regulatory processes conducted by sigma factors in streptomycetes.",Genomic Analyses of the Quinol Oxidases and/or Quinone Reductases Involved in Bacterial Extracellular Electron Transfer.,https://www.ncbi.nlm.nih.gov/pubmed/30619124,Frontiers in microbiology,2019 01 10,"To exchange electrons with extracellular substrates, some microorganisms employ extracellular electron transfer (EET) pathways that physically connect extracellular redox reactions to intracellular metabolic activity. These pathways are made of redox and structural proteins that work cooperatively to transfer electrons between extracellular substrates and the cytoplasmic membrane. Crucial to the bacterial and archaeal EET pathways are the quinol oxidases and/or quinone reductases in the cytoplasmic membrane where they recycle the quinone/quinol pool in the cytoplasmic membrane during EET reaction. Up to date, three different families of quinol oxidases and/or quinone reductases involved in bacterial EET have been discovered. They are the CymA, CbcL/MtrH/MtoC, and ImcH families of quinol oxidases and/or quinone reductases that are all multiheme c-type cytochromes (c-Cyts). To investigate to what extent they are distributed among microorganisms, we search the bacterial as well as archaeal genomes for the homologs of these c-Cyts. Search results reveal that the homologs of these c-Cyts are only found in the Domain Bacteria. Moreover, the CymA homologs are only found in the phylum of Proteobacteria and most of them are in the Shewanella genus. In addition to Shewanella sp., CymA homologs are also found in other Fe(III)-reducing bacteria, such as of Vibrio parahaemolyticus. In contrast to CymA, CbcL/MtrH/MtoC, and ImcH homologs are much more widespread. CbcL/MtrH/MtoC homologs are found in 15 phyla, while ImcH homologs are found in 12 phyla. Furthermore, the heme-binding motifs of CbcL/MtrH/MtoC and ImcH homologs vary greatly, ranging from 3 to 23 and 6 to 10 heme-binding motifs for CbcL/MtrH/MtoC and ImcH homologs, respectively. Moreover, CymA and CbcL/MtrH/MtoC homologs are found in both Fe(III)-reducing and Fe(II)-oxidizing bacteria, suggesting that these families of c-Cyts catalyze both quinol-oxidizing and quinone-reducing reactions. ImcH homologs are only found in the Fe(III)-reducing bacteria, implying that they are only the quinol oxidases. Finally, some bacteria have the homologs of two different families of c-Cyts, which may improve the bacterial capability to exchange electrons with extracellular substrates.","Characterization and Genomic Analysis of SFPH2, a Novel T7virus Infecting Shigella.",https://www.ncbi.nlm.nih.gov/pubmed/30619123,Frontiers in microbiology,2019 01 10,"Shigellosis, caused by Shigella, is a major global health concern, with nearly 164.7 million cases and over a million deaths occurring annually worldwide. Shigella flexneri is one of the most common subgroups of Shigella with a high incidence of multidrug-resistance. The phage therapy approach is an effective method for controlling multidrug-resistant bacteria. However, only a few Shigella phages have been described to date. In this study, a novel lytic bacteriophage SFPH2 was isolated from a sewage sample obtained from a hospital in Beijing, China, using a multidrug-resistant S. flexneri 2a strain (SF2) isolated from the fecal sample of a dysentery patient. SFPH2 is a member of the Podoviridae virus family with an icosahedral capsid and a short, non-contractile tail. It was found to be stable over a wide range of temperatures (4-50°C) and pH values (pH 3-11). Moreover, SFPH2 could infect two other S. flexneri serotypes (serotypes 2 variant and Y). High-throughput sequencing revealed that SFPH2 has a linear double-stranded DNA genome of 40,387 bp with 50 open reading frames. No tRNA genes were identified in the genome. Comparative analysis of the genome revealed that the SFPH2 belongs to the subfamily Autographivirinae and genus T7virus. The genome shows high similarity with other enterobacterial T7virus bacteriophages such as Citrobacter phage SH4 (95% identity and 89% coverage) and Cronobacter phage Dev2 (94% identity and 92% coverage). A comparison of the fiber proteins showed that minor differences in the amino acid residues might specify different protein binding regions and determine host species. In conclusion, this is the first report of a T7virus that can infect Shigella; SFPH2 has a functional stability under a wide range of temperatures and pH values, showing the potential to be widely applied to control Shigella-associated clinical infections and reduce the transmission rates of S. flexneri serotype 2a and its variants in the environment.",Lactobacillus gasseri LA39 Activates the Oxidative Phosphorylation Pathway in Porcine Intestinal Epithelial Cells.,https://www.ncbi.nlm.nih.gov/pubmed/30619122,Frontiers in microbiology,2019 01 10,"Intestinal microbial interactions with the host epithelium have important roles in host health. Our previous data have suggested that Lactobacillus gasseri LA39 is the predominant intestinal Lactobacillus in weaned piglets. However, the regulatory role of L. gasseri LA39 in the intestinal epithelial protein expression in piglets remains unclear. In the present study, we conducted comparative proteomics approach to investigate the intestinal epithelial protein profile alteration caused by L. gasseri LA39 in piglets. The expressions of 15 proteins significantly increased, whereas the expressions of 13 proteins significantly decreased in the IPEC-J2 cells upon L. gasseri LA39 treatment. Bioinformatics analyses, including COG function annotation, GO annotation, and KEGG pathway analysis for the differentially expressed proteins revealed that the oxidative phosphorylation (OXPHOS) pathway in IPEC-J2 cells was significantly activated by L. gasseri LA39 treatment. Further data indicated that two differentially expressed proteins UQCRC2 and TCIRG1, associated with the OXPHOS pathway, and cellular ATP levels in IPEC-J2 cells were significantly up-regulated by L. gasseri LA39 treatment. Importantly, the in vivo data indicated that oral gavage of L. gasseri LA39 significantly increased the expression of UQCRC2 and TCIRG1 and the cellular ATP levels in the intestinal epithelial cells of weaned piglets. Our results, both in vitro and in vivo, reveal that L. gasseri LA39 activates the OXPHOS pathway and increases the energy production in porcine intestinal epithelial cells. These findings suggest that L. gasseri LA39 may be a potential probiotics candidate for intestinal energy production promotion and confers health-promoting functions in mammals.",Tobacco Exposure Enhances Human Papillomavirus 16 Oncogene Expression via EGFR/PI3K/Akt/c-Jun Signaling Pathway in Cervical Cancer Cells.,https://www.ncbi.nlm.nih.gov/pubmed/30619121,Frontiers in microbiology,2019 01 10,"High-risk human papillomavirus (HR-HPV) infection is not a sufficient condition for cervical cancer development because most infections are benign and naturally cleared. Epidemiological studies revealed that tobacco smoking is a cofactor with HR-HPV for cervical cancer initiation and progression, even though the mechanism by which tobacco smoke cooperates with HR-HPV in this malignancy is poorly understood. As HR-HPV E6/E7 oncoproteins overexpressed in cervical carcinomas colocalize with cigarette smoke components (CSC), in this study we addressed the signaling pathways involved in a potential interaction between both carcinogenic agents. Cervical cancer-derived cell lines, CaSki (HPV16; 500 copies per cell) and SiHa (HPV16; 2 copies per cell), were acutely exposed to CSC at various non-toxic concentrations and we found that E6 and E7 levels were significantly increased in a dose-dependent manner. Using a reporter construct containing the luciferase gene under the control of the full HPV16 long control region (LCR), we also found that p97 promoter activity is dependent on CSC. Non-synonymous mutations in the LCR-resident TPA (12-O-tetradecanoylphorbol 13-acetate)-response elements (TRE) had significantly decreased p97 promoter activation. Phosphoproteomic arrays and specific inhibitors revealed that CSC-mediated E6/E7 overexpression is at least in part reliant on EGFR phosphorylation. In addition, we showed that the PI3K/Akt pathway is crucial for CSC-induced E6/E7 overexpression. Finally, we demonstrated that HPV16 E6/E7 overexpression is mediated by JUN. overexpression, c-Jun phosphorylation and recruitment of this transcription factor to TRE sites in the HPV16 LCR. We conclude that acute exposure to tobacco smoke activates the transcription of HPV16 E6 and E7 oncogenes through p97 promoter activation, which involves the EGFR/PI3K/Akt/C-Jun signaling pathway activation in cervical cancer cells.",Metabolomic Fingerprinting of Salinispora From Atlantic Oceanic Islands.,https://www.ncbi.nlm.nih.gov/pubmed/30619120,Frontiers in microbiology,2019 01 10,"Salinispora (Micromonosporaceae) is an obligate marine bacterium genus consisting of three species that share over 99% 16S rRNA identity. The genome and biosynthetic pathways of the members of this genus have been widely investigated due to their production of species-specific metabolites. However, despite the species' high genetic similarity, site-specific secondary metabolic gene clusters have been found in Salinispora strains collected at different locations. Therefore, exploring the metabolic expression of Salinispora recovered from different sites may furnish insights into their environmental adaptation or their chemical communication and, further, may lead to the discovery of new natural products. We describe the first occurrence of Salinispora strains in sediments from the Saint Peter and Saint Paul Archipelago (a collection of islets in Brazil) in the Atlantic Ocean, and we investigate the metabolic profiles of these strains by employing mass-spectrometry-based metabolomic approaches, including molecular networking from the Global Natural Products Social Molecular Networking platform. Furthermore, we analyze data from Salinispora strains recovered from sediments from the Madeira Archipelago (Portugal, Macaronesia) in order to provide a wider metabolomic investigation of Salinispora strains from the Atlantic Oceanic islands. Overall, our study evidences a broader geographic influence on the secondary metabolism of Salinispora than was previously proposed. Still, some biosynthetic gene clusters, such as those corresponding to typical chemical signatures of S. arenicola, like saliniketals and rifamycins, are highly conserved among the assessed strains.",Contribution of the Alkylquinolone Quorum-Sensing System to the Interaction of Pseudomonas aeruginosa With Bronchial Epithelial Cells.,https://www.ncbi.nlm.nih.gov/pubmed/30619119,Frontiers in microbiology,2019 01 11,"Pseudomonas aeruginosa causes infections in patients with compromised epithelial barrier function. Multiple virulence factors produced by P. aeruginosa are controlled by quorum sensing (QS) via 2-alkyl-4(1H)-quinolone (AQ) signal molecules. Here, we investigated the impact of AQs on P. aeruginosa PAO1 infection of differentiated human bronchial epithelial cells (HBECs). The pqsA-E operon is responsible for the biosynthesis of AQs including the 2-alkyl-3-hydroxy-4-quinolones, 4-hydroxy-2-alkylquinolines, and 4-hydroxy-2-alkylquinoline N-oxides as exemplified by pseudomonas quinolone signal (PQS), 2-heptyl-4-hydroxyquinoline (HHQ), and 2-heptyl-4-hydroxyquinoline N-oxide (HQNO), respectively. PQS and HHQ both act as QS signal molecules while HQNO is a cytochrome inhibitor. PqsE contributes both to AQ biosynthesis and promotes virulence in a PQS-independent manner. Our results show that PQS, HHQ, and HQNO were produced during PAO1 infection of HBECs, but no differences in growth or cytotoxicity were apparent when PAO1 and an AQ-negative ΔpqsA mutant were compared. Both strains promoted synthesis of inflammatory cytokines TNF-α, interleukin (IL)-6, and IL-17C by HBECs, and the provision of exogenous PQS negatively impacted on this response without affecting bacterial growth. Expression of pqsE and the PQS-independent PqsE-regulated genes mexG and lecA was detected during HBEC infection. Levels were reduced in the ΔpqsA mutant, that is, in the absence of PQS, and increased by exogenous PQS. These results support an AQ-independent role for PqsE during initial infection of HBEC by P. aeruginosa and for PQS as an enhancer of PqsE and PqsE-controlled virulence determinants and as an immunomodulator.",Zika Virus Infection Produces a Reduction on Aedes aegypti Lifespan but No Effects on Mosquito Fecundity and Oviposition Success.,https://www.ncbi.nlm.nih.gov/pubmed/30619118,Frontiers in microbiology,2019 01 10,"A Zika virus (ZIKV) pandemic started soon after the first autochthonous cases in Latin America. Although Aedes aegypti is pointed as the primary vector in Latin America, little is known about the fitness cost due to ZIKV infection. We investigated the effects of ZIKV infection on the life-history traits of Ae. aegypti females collected in three districts of Rio de Janeiro, Brazil (Barra, Deodoro, and Porto), equidistant ~25 km each other. Aedes aegypti mosquitoes were classified into infected (a single oral challenge with ZIKV) and superinfected (two ZIKV-infected blood meals spaced by 7 days each other). ZIKV infection reduced Ae. aegypti survival in two of the three populations tested, and superinfection produced a sharper increase in mortality in one of those populations. We hypothesized higher mortality with the presence of more ZIKV copies in Ae. aegypti females from Porto. The number of eggs laid per clutch was statistically similar between vector populations and infected and uninfected mosquitoes. Infection by ZIKV not affected female oviposition success. ZIKV infection impacted Ae. aegypti vectorial capacity by reducing its lifespan, although female fecundity remained unaltered. The outcome of these findings to disease transmission intensity still needs further evaluation.",Comparison of Mothur and QIIME for the Analysis of Rumen Microbiota Composition Based on 16S rRNA Amplicon Sequences.,https://www.ncbi.nlm.nih.gov/pubmed/30619117,Frontiers in microbiology,2019 01 10,"Background: Microbiome studies need to analyze massive sequencing data, which requires the use of sophisticated bioinformatics pipelines. Up to date, several tools are available, although the literature is scarce on studies that compare the performance of different bioinformatics pipelines on rumen microbiota when 16S rRNA amplicons are analyzed. The impact of the pipeline on the outcome of the results is also unknown, mainly in terms of the output from studies using these tools as an intermediate phenotype (pseudophenotypes). This study compares two commonly used software (Quantitative Insights Into Microbial Ecology) (QIIME) and mothur, and two microbial gene data bases (GreenGenes and SILVA) for 16S rRNA gene analysis, using metagenome read data collected from rumen content of a cohort of dairy cows. Results: We compared the relative abundance (RA) of the identified OTUs at the genus level. Both tools presented a high degree of agreement at identifying the most abundant genera: Bifidobacterium, Butyrivibrio, Methanobrevibacter, Prevotella, and Succiniclasticum (RA > 1%), regardless the database. There were no statistical differences between mothur and QIIME (P > 0.05) at estimating the overall RA of the most abundant (RA > 10%) genera, either using SILVA or GreenGenes. However, differences were found at RA < 10% (P < 0.05) when using GreenGenes as database, with mothur assigning OTUs to a larger number of genera and in larger RA for these less frequent microorganisms. With this database mothur resulted in larger richness (P < 0.05), more favorable rarefaction curves and a larger analytic sensitivity. These differences caused significant and relevant differences between tools at identifying the dissimilarity of microbiotas between pairs of animals. However, these differences were attenuated, but not erased, when SILVA was used as the reference database. Conclusion: The findings showed that the SILVA database seemed a preferred reference dataset for classifying OTUs from rumen microbiota. If this database was used, both QIIME and mothur produced comparable richness and diversity, and also in the RA of most common rumen microbes. However, important differences were found for less common microorganisms which impacted on the beta diversity calculated between pipelines. This may have relevant implications at studying global rumen microbiota.",Inactivation of Escherichia coli Using Nanosecond Electric Fields and Nisin Nanoparticles: A Kinetics Study.,https://www.ncbi.nlm.nih.gov/pubmed/30619116,Frontiers in microbiology,2019 01 10,"Nisin is a recognized bacteriocin widely used in food processing, however, being ineffective against gram-negative bacteria and in complex food systems. As a result, the research of methods that have cell wall-permeabilizing activity is required. In this study, electroporation to trigger sensitization of gram-negative bacteria to nisin-loaded pectin nanoparticles was used. As a model microorganism, bioluminescent strain of E. coli was introduced. Inactivation kinetics using nanosecond pulsed electric fields (PEFs) and nisin nanoparticles have been studied in a broad range (100-900 ns, 10-30 kV/cm) of pulse parameters. As a reference, the microsecond range protocols (100 μs × 8) have been applied. It was determined that the 20-30 kV/cm electric field with pulse duration ranging from 500 to 900 ns was sufficient to cause significant permeabilization of E. coli to trigger a synergistic response with the nisin treatment. The kinetics of the inactivation was studied with a time resolution of 2.5 min, which provided experimental evidence that the efficacy of nisin-based treatment can be effectively controlled in time using PEF. The results and the proposed methodology for rapid detection of bacteria inactivation rate based on bioluminescence may be useful in the development and optimization of protocols for PEF-based treatments."

However, when these bacteria are organized in biofilm, they could be involved in several skin disorders such as acne or psoriasis. They inhabit in hollows of hair follicles and skin glands, where they form biofilms. There, they are continuously exposed to human hormones, including human natriuretic peptides (NUPs). We first observed that the atrial natriuretic peptide (ANP) and the C-type natriuretic peptide (CNP) have a strong effect S. aureus and C. acnes biofilm formation on the skin. These effects are significantly dependent on the aero-anaerobic conditions and temperature. We also show that both ANP and CNP increased competitive advantages of C. acnes toward S. aureus in mixed biofilm. Because of their temperature-dependent effects, NUPs appear to act as a thermostat, allowing the skin to modulate bacterial development in normal and inflammatory conditions. This is an important step toward understanding how human neuroendocrine systems can regulate the cutaneous microbial community and should be important for applications in fundamental sciences, medicine, dermatology, and cosmetology.",Resveratrol-Mediated Attenuation of Staphylococcus aureus Enterotoxin B-Induced Acute Liver Injury Is Associated With Regulation of microRNA and Induction of Myeloid-Derived Suppressor Cells.,https://www.ncbi.nlm.nih.gov/pubmed/30619104,Frontiers in microbiology,2019 01 11,"Resveratrol (RES) is a polyphenolic compound found abundantly in plant products including red grapes, peanuts, and mulberries. Because of potent anti-inflammatory properties of RES, we investigated whether RES can protect from Staphylococcal enterotoxin B (SEB)-induced acute liver injury in mice. SEB is a potent super antigen that induces robust inflammation and releases inflammatory cytokines that can be fatal. We observed that SEB caused acute liver injury in mice with increases in enzyme aspartate transaminase (AST) levels, and massive infiltration of immune cells into the liver. Treatment with RES (100 mg/kg body weight) attenuated SEB-induced acute liver injury, as indicated by decreased AST levels and cellular infiltration in the liver. Interestingly, RES treatment increased the number of myeloid derived suppressor cells (MDSCs) in the liver. RES treatment led to alterations in the microRNA (miR) profile in liver mononuclear cells (MNCs) of mice exposed to SEB, and pathway analysis indicated these miRs targeted many inflammatory pathways. Of these, we identified miR-185, which was down-regulated by RES, to specifically target Colony Stimulating Factor (CSF1) using transfection studies. Moreover, the levels of CSF1 were significantly increased in RES-treated SEB mice. Because CSF1 is critical in MDSC induction, our studies suggest that RES may induce MDSCs by down-regulating miR-185 leading to increase the expression of CSF1. The data presented demonstrate for the first time that RES can effectively attenuates SEB-induced acute liver injury and that this may result from its action on miRs and induction of MDSCs.","Clinical Impact of Antifungal Susceptibility, Biofilm Formation and Mannoside Expression of Candida Yeasts on the Outcome of Invasive Candidiasis in ICU: An Ancillary Study on the Prospective AmarCAND2 Cohort.",https://www.ncbi.nlm.nih.gov/pubmed/30619103,Frontiers in microbiology,2019 01 10,"Background: The link between Candida phenotypical characteristics and invasive candidiasis (IC) prognosis is still partially unknown. Methods:Candida strains isolated during the AmarCAND2 study were centrally analyzed for species identification, antifungal susceptibility, biofilm formation, and expression of surface and glycoconjugate mannosides. Correlation between these phenotypical features and patient outcome was sought using a multivariable Cox survival model. Results:Candida albicans was predominant (65.4%, n = 285), with a mortality rate significantly lower than that in patients with non-albicans strains [HR 0.67 (0.46-1.00), p = 0.048]. The rate of fluconazole-resistant strains was low (C. albicans and Candida glabrata: 3.5 and 6.2%, respectively) as well as caspofungin-resistant ones (1 and 3.1%, respectively). Early biofilm formation was less frequent among C. albicans (45.4%) than among non-albicans (81.2%). While the strains of C. albicans showed variable levels of surface mannosides expression, strains isolated from candidemia exhibited a high expression of β-man, which was correlated with an increased mortality (p = 0.02). Conclusion:Candida albicans IC were associated with lower mortality, and with strains that exhibited less frequently early biofilm formation than non-albicans strains. A high expression of β-man was associated with increased IC mortality. Further studies are warranted to confirm this data and to evaluate other virulence factors in yeasts.","Low-Abundance Members of the Firmicutes Facilitate Bioremediation of Soil Impacted by Highly Acidic Mine Drainage From the Malanjkhand Copper Project, India.",https://www.ncbi.nlm.nih.gov/pubmed/30619102,Frontiers in microbiology,2019 01 10,"Sulfate- and iron-reducing heterotrophic bacteria represented minor proportion of the indigenous microbial community of highly acidic, oligotrophic acid mine drainage (AMD), but they can be successfully stimulated for in situ bioremediation of an AMD impacted soil (AIS). These anaerobic microorganisms although played central role in sulfate- and metal-removal, they remained inactive in the AIS due to the paucity of organic carbon and extreme acidity of the local environment. The present study investigated the scope for increasing the abundance and activity of inhabitant sulfate- and iron-reducing bacterial populations of an AIS from Malanjkhand Copper Project. An AIS of pH 3.5, high soluble SO42- (7838 mg/l) and Fe (179 mg/l) content was amended with nutrients (cysteine and lactate). Thorough geochemical analysis, 16S rRNA gene amplicon sequencing and qPCR highlighted the intrinsic metabolic abilities of native bacteria in AMD bioremediation. Following 180 days incubation, the nutrient amended AIS showed marked increase in pH (to 6.6) and reduction in soluble -SO42- (95%), -Fe (50%) and other heavy metals. Concomitant to physicochemical changes a vivid shift in microbial community composition was observed. Members of the Firmicutes present as a minor group (1.5% of total community) in AIS emerged as the single most abundant taxon (∼56%) following nutrient amendments. Organisms affiliated to Clostridiaceae, Peptococcaceae, Veillonellaceae, Christensenellaceae, Lachnospiraceae, Bacillaceae, etc. known for their fermentative, iron and sulfate reducing abilities were prevailed in the amended samples. qPCR data corroborated with this change and further revealed an increase in abundance of dissimilatory sulfite reductase gene (dsrB) and specific bacterial taxa. Involvement of these enhanced populations in reductive processes was validated by further enrichments and growth in sulfate- and iron-reducing media. Amplicon sequencing of these enrichments confirmed growth of Firmicutes members and proved their sulfate- and iron-reduction abilities. This study provided a better insight on ecological perspective of Firmicutes members within the AMD impacted sites, particularly their involvement in sulfate- and iron-reduction processes, in situ pH management and bioremediation.",Surface-Enhanced Raman Scattering (SERS) With Silver Nano Substrates Synthesized by Microwave for Rapid Detection of Foodborne Pathogens.,https://www.ncbi.nlm.nih.gov/pubmed/30619101,Frontiers in microbiology,2019 01 10,"Rapid and sensitive methods have been developed to detect foodborne pathogens, a development that is important for food safety. The aim of this study is to explore Surface-enhanced Raman scattering (SERS) with silver nano substrates to detect and identify the following three foodborne pathogens: Escherichia coli O157: H7, Staphylococcus aureus and Salmonella. All the cells were resuspended with 10 mL silver colloidal nanoparticles, making a concentration of 107 CFU/mL, and were then exposed to 785 nm laser excitation. In this study, the results showed that all the bacteria can be sensitively and reproducibly detected directly by SERS. The distinctive differences can be observed in the SERS spectral data of the three food-borne pathogens, and the silver colloidal nanoparticles can be used as highly sensitive SERS-active substrates. In addition, the assay time required only a few minutes, which indicated that SERS coupled with the silver colloidal nanoparticles is a promising method for the detection and characterization of food-borne pathogens. At the same time, principle component analysis (PCA) and hierarchical cluster analysis (HCA) made the different bacterial strains clearly differentiated based on the barcode spectral data reduction. Therefore, the SERS methods hold great promise for the detection and identification of food-borne pathogens and even for applications in food safety.",Microglia Increase Inflammatory Responses in iPSC-Derived Human BrainSpheres.,https://www.ncbi.nlm.nih.gov/pubmed/30619100,Frontiers in microbiology,2019 01 11,"Human induced pluripotent stem cells (iPSCs), together with 21st century cell culture methods, have the potential to better model human physiology with applications in toxicology, disease modeling, and the study of host-pathogen interactions. Several models of the human brain have been developed recently, demonstrating cell-cell interactions of multiple cell types with physiologically relevant 3D structures. Most current models, however, lack the ability to represent the inflammatory response in the brain because they do not include a microglial cell population. Microglia, the resident immunocompetent phagocytes in the central nervous system (CNS), are not only important in the inflammatory response and pathogenesis; they also function in normal brain development, strengthen neuronal connections through synaptic pruning, and are involved in oligodendrocyte and neuronal survival. Here, we have successfully introduced a population of human microglia into 3D human iPSC-derived brain spheres (BrainSpheres, BS) through co-culturing cells of the Immortalized Human Microglia - SV40 cell line with the BS model (μBS). We detected an inflammatory response to lipopolysaccharides (LPS) and flavivirus infection, which was only elicited in the model when microglial cells were present. A concentration of 20 ng/mL of LPS increased gene expression of the inflammatory cytokines interleukin-6 (IL-6), IL-10, and IL-1β, with maximum expression at 6-12 h post-exposure. Increased expression of the IL-6, IL-1β, tumor necrosis factor alpha (TNF-α), and chemokine (C-C motif) ligand 2 (CCL2) genes was observed in μBS following infection with Zika and Dengue Virus, suggesting a stronger inflammatory response in the model when microglia were present than when only astrocyte, oligodendrocyte, and neuronal populations were represented. Microglia innately develop within cerebral organoids (Nature communications), our findings suggest that the μBS model is more physiologically relevant and has potential applications in infectious disease and host-pathogen interactions research.",Thin Endometrium Is Also Associated With Lower Clinical Pregnancy Rate in Unstimulated Menstrual Cycles: A Study Based on Natural Cycle IVF.,https://www.ncbi.nlm.nih.gov/pubmed/30619099,Frontiers in endocrinology,2019 01 10,"Introduction: Does the endometrial thickness (EMT) at the time of follicle aspiration correlate with the pregnancy rate in unstimulated menstrual cycles? Materials and Methods: This is a retrospective, observational single center study.105 women with regular menstrual cycles undergoing their first NC-IVF cycle with an embryo transfer were analyzed. Clinical pregnancy and live birth rates were calculated and data were adjusted for women's age, cycle day of follicle aspiration and body mass index (BMI). Results: Age of participants was 35.0 y [32.0; 37.0]. Follicle aspiration was performed on day 14.0 [12.0; 15.0] of the cycle. Total clinical pregnancy rate was 24.8% and live birth rate 15.2% per transfer. Pregnancy rate in women with endometrial thickness ≤7 mm (n = 27) was 7.4 and 30.8% in women >7 mm (n = 78) (OR 5.56, 1.22-25.36) (P = 0.03). Live birth rates were not significantly different. Quadratic regression analysis revealed lower pregnancy rates in women with thin (around <8 mm) as well as with thick (around >11 mm) endometria. P-value after crude quadratic analysis was 0.028 and after adjustment for age, day of aspiration and BMI was 0.039. Significance was not reached for live birth rates. Conclusion: Thin endometrium should also be considered as an independent negative prognostic factor for achieving pregnancy in women without ovarian stimulation.",Phloretin Prevents Diabetic Cardiomyopathy by Dissociating Keap1/Nrf2 Complex and Inhibiting Oxidative Stress.,https://www.ncbi.nlm.nih.gov/pubmed/30619098,Frontiers in endocrinology,2019 01 10,"Hyperglycemia induces chronic inflammation and oxidative stress in cardiomyocyte, which are the main pathological changes of diabetic cardiomyopathy (DCM). Treatment aimed at these processes may be beneficial in DCM. Phloretin (PHL), a promising natural product, has many pharmacological activities, such as anti-inflammatory, anticancer, and anti-oxidative function. The aim of this study was to investigate whether PHL could ameliorate the high glucose-mediated oxidation, hypertrophy, and fibrosis in H9c2 cells and attenuate the inflammation- and oxidation-mediated cardiac injury. In this study, PHL induced significantly inhibitory effect on the expression of pro-inflammatory, hypertrophy, pro-oxidant, and fibrosis cytokines in high glucose-stimulated cardiac H9c2 cells. Furthermore, PHL decreased the levels of serum lactate dehydrogenase, aspartate aminotransferase, and creatine kinase-MB, and attenuated the progress in the fibrosis, oxidative stress, and pathological parameters via Kelch-like ECH-associated protein 1 (Keap1)/nuclear factor E2-related factor 2 (Nrf2) pathway in diabetic mice. In additional, molecular modeling and immunoblotting results confirmed that PHL might obstruct the interaction between Nrf2 and Keap1 through direct binding Keap1, and promoting Nrf2 expression. These results provided evidence that PHL could suppress high glucose-induced cardiomyocyte oxidation and fibrosis injury, and that targeting Keap1/Nrf2 may provide a novel therapeutic strategy for human DCM in the future.",17β-Estradiol Promotes Apoptosis in Airway Smooth Muscle Cells Through CD38/SIRT1/p53 Pathway.,https://www.ncbi.nlm.nih.gov/pubmed/30619097,Frontiers in endocrinology,2019 01 10,"17β-Estradiol (E2) is the major estrogen secreted by the premenopausal ovary and shows dual effects on cell apoptosis under pathological conditions. E2 was previously shown to increase CD38 mRNA and protein expression in myometrial smooth muscle, but its function and mechanism remain largely unknown. Here we investigated the role of E2 in hypoxia-induced apoptosis in mouse airway smooth muscle cells (ASMCs) and explored the underlying mechanisms. Results showed that E2 significantly increased CD38 expression at both mRNA and protein levels, accompanied with decreased SIRT1 levels in ASMCs. By using primary ASMCs from the wild type (WT) and the smooth muscle-specific CD38 knockout (CD38 KO) mice, we found that the down-regulation of SIRT1 induced by E2 was abolished in CD38 KO AMSCs. E2 promoted the acetylation of p53 in WT cells, and this effect was also diminished in the absence of CD38. In addition, E2 further activated CD38/SIRT1/p53 signal pathway and promoted cell apoptosis during hypoxia. However, these effects were reversed in CD38 KO ASMCs and by the specific SIRT1 activator Resveratrol. We also found that E2 enhanced CD38 expression through estrogen receptor. The data suggested that CD38 is a direct target for E2 which promotes hypoxia-induced AMSC apoptosis through SIRT1/p53 signal pathway.","Obesity, Male Reproductive Function and Bariatric Surgery.",https://www.ncbi.nlm.nih.gov/pubmed/30619096,Frontiers in endocrinology,2019 01 10,"Overweight and obesity are associated with several chronic complications, such as type 2 diabetes, arterial hypertension and atherosclerotic cardiovascular diseases, with relevant consequences for patients and public health systems. Reproductive function abnormalities, such as obesity-related secondary hypogonadism, erectile dysfunction and infertility, represent other abnormalities negatively affecting the quality of life of men suffering from obesity but, despite their high prevalence, these are often understated because of a general lack of awareness in clinical practice. Obesity and gonadal function are closely related, with obesity being associated with hypogonadism that is reversed by body weight reduction thus ameliorating reproductive and sexual health. Clinical studies specifically evaluating the impact of non-surgical weight loss on testosterone levels sometimes showed conflicting results, whereas extensive literature has demonstrated that weight loss after bariatric surgery is correlated with an increase in testosterone levels greater than that obtained with only lifestyle interventions, suggesting the role of surgery also for the treatment of hypogonadism in obese male. However, studies concerning the consequences of bariatric surgery on overall reproductive function in the male, including also sexual activity and fertility, are limited and data regarding long-term effects are lacking. Here we present a brief review summarizing the evidence regarding the interplay between obesity and reproductive abnormalities in the obese male, together with the role of bariatric surgery for the treatment of these complications, describing both the positive effects and the limitations of this procedure."

To investigate the mechanisms underlying adverse effects of contaminants, fathead minnows were exposed to a number of endocrine disruptive chemicals (EDCs) including Nonylphenol (NP), bisphenol-A (BPA), Di(2-ethylhexyl) phthalate (DEHP), and a mixture of the three chemicals for 21 days, followed by determination of the liver transcriptome by expression microarrays. Pathway analysis revealed a distinct mode of action for the individual chemicals and their mixture. The results showed expression changes in over 980 genes in response to exposure to these EDC contaminants individually and in mixture. Ingenuity Pathway core and toxicity analysis were used to identify the biological processes, pathways and the top regulators affected by these compounds. A number of canonical pathways were significantly altered, including cell cycle & proliferation, lipid metabolism, inflammatory, innate immune response, stress response, and drug metabolism. We identified 18 genes that were expressed in all individual and mixed treatments. Relevant candidate genes identified from expression microarray data were verified using quantitative PCR. We were also able to identify specific genes affected by NP, BPA, and DEHP individually, but were also affected by exposure to the mixture of the contaminants. Overall the results of this study provide novel information on the adverse health impact of contaminants tested based on pathway analysis of transcriptome data. Furthermore, the results identify a number of new biomarkers that can potentially be used for screening environmental contaminants.",Effects of FSH on Sperm DNA Fragmentation: Review of Clinical Studies and Possible Mechanisms of Action.,https://www.ncbi.nlm.nih.gov/pubmed/30619081,Frontiers in endocrinology,2019 01 10,"Sperm DNA fragmentation (sDF) is an important reproductive problem, associated to an increased time-to-pregnancy and a reduced success rate in natural and in vitro fertilization. sDF may virtually originate at any time of sperm's life: in the testis, in the epididymis, during transit in the ejaculatory ducts and even following ejaculation. Studies demonstrate that an apoptotic pathway, mainly occurring in the testis, and oxidative stress, likely acting in the male genital tract, are responsible for provoking the DNA strand breaks present in ejaculated spermatozoa. Although several pharmacological anti-oxidants tools have been used to reduce sDF, the efficacy of this type of therapies is questioned. Clearly, anti-apoptotic agents cannot be used because of the ubiquitous role of the apoptotic process in the body. A notable exception is represented by Follicle-stimulating hormone (FSH), which regulates testis development and function and has been demonstrated to exert anti-apoptotic actions on germ cells. Here, we review the existing clinical studies evaluating the effect of FSH administration on sDF and discuss the possible mechanisms through which the hormone may reduce sDF levels in infertile subjects. Although there is evidence for a beneficial effect of the hormone on sDF, further studies with clear and univocal patient inclusion criteria, including sDF cut-off levels and considering the use of a pharmacogenetic approach for patients selection are warranted to draw firm conclusions.",,,,2019 01 10,,Gait Rehabilitation Using Functional Electrical Stimulation Induces Changes in Ankle Muscle Coordination in Stroke Survivors: A Preliminary Study.,https://www.ncbi.nlm.nih.gov/pubmed/30619077,Frontiers in neurology,2019 02 08,"Background: Previous studies have demonstrated that post-stroke gait rehabilitation combining functional electrical stimulation (FES) applied to the ankle muscles during fast treadmill walking (FastFES) improves gait biomechanics and clinical walking function. However, there is considerable inter-individual variability in response to FastFES. Although FastFES aims to sculpt ankle muscle coordination, whether changes in ankle muscle activity underlie observed gait improvements is unknown. The aim of this study was to investigate three cases illustrating how FastFES modulates ankle muscle recruitment during walking. Methods: We conducted a preliminary case series study on three individuals (53-70 y; 2 M; 35-60 months post-stroke; 19-22 lower extremity Fugl-Meyer) who participated in 18 sessions of FastFES (3 sessions/week; ClinicalTrials.gov: NCT01668602). Clinical walking function (speed, 6-min walk test, and Timed-Up-and-Go test), gait biomechanics (paretic propulsion and ankle angle at initial-contact), and plantarflexor (soleus)/dorsiflexor (tibialis anterior) muscle recruitment were assessed pre- and post-FastFES while walking without stimulation. Results:Two participants (R1, R2) were categorized as responders based on improvements in clinical walking function. Consistent with heterogeneity of clinical and biomechanical changes commonly observed following gait rehabilitation, how muscle activity was altered with FastFES differed between responders. R1 exhibited improved plantarflexor recruitment during stance accompanied by increased paretic propulsion. R2 exhibited improved dorsiflexor recruitment during swing accompanied by improved paretic ankle angle at initial-contact. In contrast, the third participant (NR1), classified as a non-responder, demonstrated increased ankle muscle activity during inappropriate phases of the gait cycle. Across all participants, there was a positive relationship between increased walking speeds after FastFES and reduced SOL/TA muscle coactivation. Conclusion:Our preliminary case series study is the first to demonstrate that improvements in ankle plantarflexor and dorsiflexor muscle recruitment (muscles targeted by FastFES) accompanied improvements in gait biomechanics and walking function following FastFES in individuals post-stroke. Our results also suggest that inducing more appropriate (i.e., reduced) ankle plantar/dorsi-flexor muscle coactivation may be an important neuromuscular mechanism underlying improvements in gait function after FastFES training, suggesting that pre-treatment ankle muscle status could be used for inclusion into FastFES. The findings of this case-series study, albeit preliminary, provide the rationale and foundations for larger-sample studies using similar methodology.",Metabolomics Biomarkers: A Strategy Toward Therapeutics Improvement in ALS.,https://www.ncbi.nlm.nih.gov/pubmed/30619076,Frontiers in neurology,2019 01 10,"Biomarkers research in amyotrophic lateral sclerosis (ALS) holds the promise of improving ALS diagnosis, follow-up of patients, and clinical trials outcomes. Metabolomics have a big impact on biomarkers identification. In this mini-review, we provide the main findings of metabolomics studies in ALS and discuss the most relevant therapeutics attempts that targeted some prominent alterations found in ALS, like glutamate excitotoxicity, oxidative stress, alterations in energetic metabolism, and creatinine levels. Metabolomics studies have reported putative diagnosis or prognosis biomarkers, but discrepancies among these studies did not allow validation of metabolic biomarkers for clinical use in ALS. In this context, we wonder whether metabolomics knowledge could improve ALS therapeutics. As metabolomics identify specific metabolic pathways modified by disease progression and/or treatment, we support that adjuvant or combined treatment should be used to rescue these pathways, creating a new perspective for ALS treatment. Some ongoing clinical trials are already trying to target these pathways. As clinical trials in ALS have been disappointing and considering the heterogeneity of the disease presentation, we support the application of a pharmacometabolomic approach to evaluate the individual response to drug treatments and their side effects, enabling the development of personalized treatments for ALS. We suggest that the best strategy to apply metabolomics for ALS therapeutics progress is to establish a metabolic signature for ALS patients in order to improve the knowledge of patient metabotypes, to choose the most adequate pharmacological treatment, and to follow the drug response and side effects, based on metabolomics biomarkers.",Impact of Reducing the Procedure Time on Thromboembolism After Coil Embolization of Cerebral Aneurysms.,https://www.ncbi.nlm.nih.gov/pubmed/30619075,Frontiers in neurology,2019 01 10,"Background: There is still controversy regarding which procedure-related factors affect the occurrence of periprocedural thromboembolism. This study aimed to investigate which procedure-related risk factors can be modified to prevent adverse thromboembolic events after coil embolization of intracranial aneurysm. Methods: Using a single-center database, we retrospectively identified a consecutive series of patients with symptomatic and asymptomatic cerebral aneurysms treated with coil embolization. We evaluated the following procedure-related factors: procedure time, procedure methods (simple coiling, stent-assisted coiling, and use of multiple microcatheters), and number of coils inserted. The primary outcome was the development of thromboembolism before and after coil embolization confirmed by diffusion-weighted imaging (DWI) irrespective of the location of the procedure. Pearson's chi-square, Student's t-test, multivariable logistic regression analysis, and sensitivity analysis with multinomial logistic regression analysis were used in the statistical analyses. Results: Of 180 cases enrolled, 146 (81.1%) had evidences of thromboembolism confirmed by DWI, and 13 (7.2%) had neurologic symptoms. Among the documented modifiable procedure-related factors, every 10 min increase in the procedure time was independently associated with the risk of thromboembolism, after adjusting the analysis (adjusted odds ratio 1.11; 95% confidence interval 1.01-1.21). The coiling methods, use of multiple catheters, and number of coils inserted did not change the effect of the procedure time on thromboembolic events (p for interactions > 0.05). Conclusion: This study showed that the procedure time might be the most effective modifiable factor for reducing thromboembolic events irrespective of the procedure methods used during coil embolization of cerebral aneurysms.",Abnormalities of Otoacoustic Emissions in Myasthenia Gravis: Association With Serological and Electrophysiological Features.,https://www.ncbi.nlm.nih.gov/pubmed/30619074,Frontiers in neurology,2019 01 10,"Objective: To investigate whether otoacoustic emissions (OAEs) are impaired in patients with myasthenia gravis (MG) and whether such dysfunction is associated with serological and electrophysiological features of MG. Methods: We tested 15 patients with MG (30 ears) and 10 healthy age- and sex-matched subjects (20 ears) for transiently evoked OAE (TEOAE) and distortion product OAE (DPOAE). Results: Compared with controls, MG patients revealed a significant reduction in the amplitude of TEOAEs (p < 0.05) and DPOAEs at higher frequencies between 2,026 and 4,053 Hz (p < 0.05). In the subgroup analysis, TEOAE and DPOAE amplitudes were significantly lower in the acetylcholine receptor (AChR) antibody-positive group (p < 0.05) as well as in the repetitive nerve stimulation (RNS)-positive (p < 0.05) group. In particular, the OAE alteration significantly correlated with anti-AChR antibody titers. No significant difference of the OAEs was found between thymomatous and non-thymomatous MG or between purely ocular and generalized MG. Conclusions: Our study confirms that OAEs reveal subclinical dysfunction of the cholinergic neurotransmission of cochlear outer hair cells and correlate well with electrophysiological and serological characteristics of MG patients. Our findings imply that the measurement of OAEs might increase the diagnostic accuracy and help to monitor the severity of MG.",Direct Bypass Surgery Vs. Combined Bypass Surgery for Hemorrhagic Moyamoya Disease: A Comparison of Angiographic Outcomes.,https://www.ncbi.nlm.nih.gov/pubmed/30619072,Frontiers in neurology,2019 01 10,"Objective: Extracranial-intracranial bypass is currently recognized as the optimal treatment for hemorrhagic-type moyamoya disease (MMD) which reduces incidence of rebleeding. Recent studies have reported the advantage of combined bypass over direct bypass for the general MMD patients. However, the effect of direct bypass and combined bypass surgery specifically for hemorrhagic-type MMD had not been investigated yet. Methods: Hemorrhagic-type MMD patients who underwent direct and combined bypass surgery with complete clinical and radiological documentation from a multicenter cohort between 2009 and 2017 were retrospectively included. Surgical methods included superficial temporal artery-middle cerebral artery (STA-MCA) anastomosis (direct bypass), combined STA-MCA bypass with encephalodurosynangiosis (EDS), and combined STA-MCA bypass with encephaloduroarteriosynangiosis (EDAS). Matsushima standard on follow-up catheter angiography was used to assess surgical outcome. Modified Rankin Scale, incidence of rebleeding and ischemia during follow-up were recorded. Rebleeding-free survival rates between direct and combined bypass were compared by Kaplan-Meier analysis. Results: Sixty eight hemorrhagic-onset MMD patients were included in this study, among which 71 hemispheres were treated with surgery (direct bypass: 17; bypass+EDS: 24; bypass+EDAS: 30). Forty six (64.8%) hemispheres had satisfactory revascularization (Matsushima level 2-3) and 26 (36.6%) had poor neoangiogenesis. Matsushima level was not significantly different between surgical groups (P = 0.258). Good neoangiogenesis from dural grafts was achieved in 26 (36.6%) hemispheres, and good neoangiogenesis from STA grafts was only seen in 4 (out of 30, 12.5%) hemispheres. Multivariate analysis showed bypass patency [P < 0.001, OR (95%CI): 13.41 (3.28-54.80)] and dural neoangiogenesis [P < 0.001, OR (95%CI): 13.18 (3.26-53.36)] both independently contributed to good angiographic outcome. During follow-up, incidences of rebleeding or ischemic events, and re-bleeding free survival rate were not significantly different between surgical groups (P = 0.433, P = 0.559, and P = 0.997). However, patients who underwent combined bypass surgery had significantly lower mRS at follow-up comparing to patients who underwent direct bypass (P = 0.006). Conclusion: Combined bypass surgery and direct bypass surgery offered similar revascularization for hemorrhagic MMD. Bypass patency and dural angiogenesis both contributed to revascularization independently. The potential of indirect bypass to grow new vessels in hemorrhagic-MMD patients was generally limited, but dural leaflets offered better neoangiogenesis than STA grafts and was therefore recommended for surgical revascularization of hemorrhagic MMD.",Neuromodulation and a Reconceptualization of Autism Spectrum Disorders: Using the Locus Coeruleus Functioning as an Exemplar.,https://www.ncbi.nlm.nih.gov/pubmed/30619071,Frontiers in neurology,2019 01 10,"The Autism Spectrum Disorders (ASD) are a heterogeneous group of developmental disorders. Although, ASD can be reliably diagnosed, the etiology, pathophysiology, and treatment targets remain poorly characterized. While there are many atypical findings in anatomy, genetics, connectivity, and other biologic parameters, there remains no discreet hypothesis to explain the core signs as well as the very frequent comorbidities. Due to this, designing targets for treatments can only be done by assuming each symptom is a result of a discreet abnormality which is likely not the case. Neuronal circuity remains a major focus of research but rarely taking into account the functioning of the brain is highly dependent on various systems, including the neuromodulatory substances originating in the midbrain. A hypothesis is presented which explores the possibility of explaining many of the symptoms found in ASD in terms of inefficient neuromodulation using the functioning of the locus coeruleus and norepinephrine (LC/NE) as exemplars. The basic science of LC/NE is reviewed. Several functions found to be impaired in ASD including learning, attention, sensory processing, emotional regulation, autonomic functioning, adaptive and repetitive behaviors, sleep, language acquisition, initiation, and prompt dependency are examined in terms of the functioning of the LC/NE system.

In patients with complete brachial plexus avulsion and subsequent reconnection of the end of the musculocutaneous nerve to the side of a phrenic nerve, reorganization leads to a doubled arm representation in the primary motor cortex. Despite, homuncular organization being one of the most fundamental principles of the human brain, movements of the affected arm now activate 2 loci: the completely denervated arm representation and the diaphragm representation. Here, we investigate the details behind this peripherally triggered reorganization, which happens in healthy brains. fMRI effective connectivity changes within the motor network were compared between a group of patients and age matched healthy controls at 7 Tesla (6 patients and 12 healthy controls). Results show the establishment of a driving input of the denervated arm area to the diaphragm area which is now responsible for arm movements. The findings extend current knowledge about neuroplasticity in primary motor cortex: a denervated motor area may drive an auxilliary area to reroute its motor output."

Evidence indicates a pivotal role of catecholamines in TTS, and researchers have discussed multiple hypotheses on the etiology, including multivessel coronary spasm, myocardial stunning, excessive transient ventricular afterload, and cardiac sympathetic overactivity with local noradrenaline spillover. Although central nervous system disorders, such as stroke and epilepsy, are known to trigger TTS, the incidence and clinical features of TTS in neurodegenerative disorders are poorly understood. Here, we retrospectively examined TTS cases in a single-center cohort composed of 250 patients with amyotrophic lateral sclerosis (ALS) and 870 patients with synucleinopathies [582 patients with Parkinson's disease (PD), 125 patients with dementia with Lewy bodies (DLB), and 163 patients with multiple system atrophy (MSA)] and identified 4 (1.6%, including 2 women) cases with ALS and no cases with synucleinopathies. Two ALS patients underwent autopsy and the pathological findings were compatible with the chronological changes identified in catecholamine-induced cardiomyopathy. A literature review identified 16 TTS cases with ALS, 1 case each with PD and DLB, and no cases with MSA. When current and previous TTS cases with ALS were concatenated: 55% (11/20) were female; 35% (7/20) had a bulbar-onset and 45% (9/20) had a limb-onset; the mean age of TTS onset was 63.3 ± 9.0 years and the mean interval time from ALS onset to TTS development was 4.9 ± 3.0 years; no (0/16) patients developed TTS within 12 months after ALS onset; 50% (10/20) underwent artificial ventilations; the mortality was 17% (3/18); and most cases had precipitating factors, and TTS development was associated with gastrostomy, tracheostomy, or infections in 45% (9/20) of the patients. This study demonstrated that ALS is a considerable predisposing factor of TTS and that synucleinopathies rarely cause TTS. The distinct TTS incidence between ALS and synucleinopathies may be due to cardiac sympathetic overactivity in ALS and may also be affected by cardiac sympathetic denervation in synucleinopathies. Moreover, the etiology of TTS in ALS may be reasonably explained by the two-hit theory.",Alterations of Sub-cortical Gray Matter Volume and Their Associations With Disease Duration in Patients With Restless Legs Syndrome.,https://www.ncbi.nlm.nih.gov/pubmed/30619055,Frontiers in neurology,2019 01 10,"Object: The purpose of this study was to uncover the pathology of restless legs syndrome (RLS) by exploring brain structural alterations and their corresponding functional abnormality. Method: Surface-based morphometry (SBM) and voxel-based morphometry (VBM) were performed to explore the alterations in cortical and sub-cortical gray matter volume (GMV) in a cohort of 20 RLS and 18 normal controls (NC). Furthermore, resting-state functional connectivity (RSFC) was also performed to identify the functional alterations in patients with RLS. Results: We found significant alterations of sub-cortical GMV, especially the bilateral putamen (PUT), rather than alterations of cortical GMV in patients with RLS compared to NC using both SBM and VBM. Further sub-regional analysis revealed that GMV alterations of PUT was mostly located in the left dorsal caudal PUT in patients with RLS. In addition, altered RSFC patterns of PUT were identified in patients with RLS compared to NC. Moreover, correlation analyses showed that the GMV of the left caudate and the left ventral rostral PUT were positively correlated with disease duration in patients with RLS. Conclusions: The alterations of subcortical GMV might imply that the primarily affected areas are located in sub-cortical areas especially in the sub-region of PUT by the pathologic process of RLS, which might be used as potential biomarkers for the early diagnosis of RLS.",Impact of Non-vitamin K Antagonist Oral Anticoagulant Withdrawal on Stroke Outcomes.,https://www.ncbi.nlm.nih.gov/pubmed/30619054,Frontiers in neurology,2019 01 10,"Introduction: Discontinuation of oral anticoagulants such as non-vitamin K antagonist oral anticoagulants (NOACs) may induce a hypercoagulable state, leading to severe stroke and poor outcomes. This study aimed to compare stroke outcomes between NOACs withdrawal and other prior medication statuses in patients with non-valvular atrial fibrillation (NVAF). Methods: Consecutive patients who had pre-existing NVAF and were admitted for an acute ischemic stroke or transient ischemic attack- at five hospitals between January 2013 and December 2016 were included. Prior medication status was categorized into seven groups such as no antithrombotics, antiplatelet-only, warfarin with subtherapeutic intensity, warfarin with therapeutic intensity, NOAC, warfarin withdrawal, and NOAC withdrawal. We compared initial National Institute of Health Stroke Scale (NIHSS) scores between groups Results: Among 719 patients with NVAF, The median NIHSS score at admission was 5 (IQR 1-13). The NOAC withdrawal group had the highest median NIHSS scores at stroke onset [16, interquartile range, IQR (1-17)], followed by the warfarin withdrawal group [11, IQR (1-14, 18)], the no antithrombotic group [5, IQR (1-13, 18, 19)], and the warfarin with subtherapeutic intensity group [5, IQR (1-10, 18, 19)]. A Multivariable analysis demonstrated that NOAC withdrawal was independently associated with higher NIHSS scores at stroke onset (B 4.645, 95% confidence interval 0.384-8.906, P = 0.033). The median interval from drug withdrawal to ischemic stroke or TIA was 7 days (IQR 4-15) in the NOAC group. Conclusions: Stroke that occurred after stopping oral anticoagulants, especially NOAC, and was more severe at presentation and associated with poorer outcomes.",Dermal Phospho-Alpha-Synuclein Deposition in Patients With Parkinson's Disease and Mutation of the Glucocerebrosidase Gene.,https://www.ncbi.nlm.nih.gov/pubmed/30619053,Frontiers in neurology,2019 01 10,"Heterozygous mutations in the glucocerebrosidase gene (GBA1) represent the most common genetic risk factor for Parkinson's disease (PD) and are histopathologically associated with a widespread load of alpha-synuclein in the brain. Therefore, PD patients with GBA1 mutations are a cohort of high interest for clinical trials on disease-modifying therapies targeting alpha-synuclein. There is evidence that detection of phospho-alpha-synuclein (p-syn) in dermal nerve fibers might be a biomarker for the histopathological identification of PD patients even at premotor or very early stages of disease. It is so far unknown whether dermal p-syn deposition can also be found in PD patients with GBA1 mutations and may serve as a biomarker for PD in these patients. Skin biopsies of 10 PD patients with different GBA1 mutations (six N370S, three E326K, one L444P) were analyzed by double-immunofluorescence labeling with anti-p-syn and anti-protein gene product 9.5 (PGP9.5, axonal marker) to detect intraaxonal p-syn deposition. Four biopsy sites (distal, proximal leg, paravertebral Th10, and C7) per patient were studied. P-syn was found in six patients (three N370S, three E326K). P-syn deposition was mainly detected in autonomic nerve fibers, but also in somatosensory fibers and was not restricted to a certain GBA1 mutation. In summary, dermal p-syn in PD patients with GBA1 mutations seems to offer a similar distribution and frequency as observed in patients without a known mutation. Skin biopsy may be suitable to study p-syn deposition in these patients or even to identify premotor patients with GBA1 mutations.",Outcome Prediction by 40-Hz Steady-State Response After Large Hemispheric Infarction.,https://www.ncbi.nlm.nih.gov/pubmed/30619052,Frontiers in neurology,2019 01 10,"Background and Purpose: The 40-Hz steady state response (SSR) reflects early sensory processing and has the potential to differentiate disease severity. This study aims to evaluate the predictive value of 40-Hz SSRs on the prognosis of patients with large hemispheric infarction (LHI). Methods: We conducted a retrospective study in patients with LHI admitted to the neurological intensive care unit (NICU) of Nanfang Hospital, Southern Medical University, Guangzhou, China, between June 2008 and December 2014. Forty-hertz SSRs were recorded within 72 h of onset and categorized into 3 grades. The correlation between 40-Hz SSR grading and clinical outcome was examined. Results: Of the 97 eligible participants, 41 (42.3%) died within 30 days and 68 (70.1%) exhibited a poor outcome (modified Rankin Scale of 5 and 6) at 90 days after the onset of LHI. We found that 40-Hz SSRs correlated significantly with NIHSS scores at admission and patient outcome. Moreover, Grade III 40-Hz SSR (bilateral sine waves that either disappeared or were not clearly identifiable) had a specificity of 97% and a positive predictive value of 94% in predicting 90-days poor outcome; Grade III 40-Hz SSR also had a specificity of 91% and a positive predictive value of 74% in predicting 30-days mortality. Conclusions: 40-Hz SSR could be used as a simple and specific method in predicting poor prognosis after LHI.",Improving the Predictions of Computational Models of Convection-Enhanced Drug Delivery by Accounting for Diffusion Non-gaussianity.,https://www.ncbi.nlm.nih.gov/pubmed/30619051,Frontiers in neurology,2019 02 16,"Convection-enhanced delivery (CED) is an innovative method of drug delivery to the human brain, that bypasses the blood-brain barrier by injecting the drug directly into the brain. CED aims to target pathological tissue for central nervous system conditions such as Parkinson's and Huntington's disease, epilepsy, brain tumors, and ischemic stroke. Computational fluid dynamics models have been constructed to predict the drug distribution in CED, allowing clinicians advance planning of the procedure. These models require patient-specific information about the microstructure of the brain tissue, which can be collected non-invasively using magnetic resonance imaging (MRI) pre-infusion. Existing models employ the diffusion tensor, which represents Gaussian diffusion in brain tissue, to provide predictions for the drug concentration. However, those predictions are not always in agreement with experimental observations. In this work we present a novel computational fluid dynamics model for CED that does not use the diffusion tensor, but rather the diffusion probability that is experimentally measured through diffusion MRI, at an individual-participant level. Our model takes into account effects of the brain microstructure on the motion of drug molecules not taken into account in previous approaches, namely the restriction and hindrance that those molecules experience when moving in the brain tissue, and can improve the drug concentration predictions. The duration of the associated MRI protocol is 19 min, and therefore feasible for clinical populations. We first prove theoretically that the two models predict different drug distributions. Then, using in vivo high-resolution diffusion MRI data from a healthy participant, we derive and compare predictions using both models, in order to identify the impact of including the effects of restriction and hindrance. Including those effects results in different drug distributions, and the observed differences exhibit statistically significant correlations with measures of diffusion non-Gaussianity in brain tissue. The differences are more pronounced for infusion in white-matter areas of the brain. Using experimental results from the literature along with our simulation results, we show that the inclusion of the effects of diffusion non-Gaussianity in models of CED is necessary, if reliable predictions that can be used in the clinic are to be generated by CED models.","The Gaps Between Current Management of Intracerebral Hemorrhage and Evidence-Based Practice Guidelines in Beijing, China.",https://www.ncbi.nlm.nih.gov/pubmed/30619050,Frontiers in neurology,2019 01 10,"Background: The leading cause of death in China is stroke, a condition that also contributes heavily to the disease burden. Nontraumatic intracerebral hemorrhage (ICH) is the second most common cause of stroke. Compared to Western countries, in China the proportion of ICH is significantly higher. Standardized treatment based on evidence-based medicine can help reduce ICH's burden. In the present study we aimed to explore the agreement between the management strategies during ICH's acute phase and Class I recommendations in current international practice guidelines in Beijing (China), and to elucidate the reasons underlying any inconsistencies found. Method: We retrospectively collected in-hospital data from 1,355 ICH patients from 15 hospitals in Beijing between January and December 2012. Furthermore, a total of 75 standardized questionnaires focusing on ICH's clinical management were distributed to 15 cooperative hospitals. Each hospital randomly selected five doctors responsible for treating ICH patients to complete the questionnaires. Results: Numerous approaches were in line with Class I recommendations, as follows: upon admission, all patients underwent radiographic examination, about 93% of the survivors received health education and 84.5% of those diagnosed with hypertension were prescribed antihypertensive treatment at discharge, in-hospital antiepileptic drugs were administered to 91.8% of the patients presenting with seizures, and continuous monitoring was performed for 88% of the patients with hyperglycemia on admission. However, several aspects were inconsistent with the guidelines, as follows: only 14.2% of the patients were initially managed in the neurological intensive care unit and 22.3% of the bedridden patients received preventive treatment for deep vein thrombosis (DVT) within 48 h after onset. The questionnaire results showed that imaging examination, blood glucose monitoring, and secondary prevention of ICH were useful to more clinicians. However, the opposite occurred for the neurological intensive care unit requirement. Regarding the guidelines' recognition, no significant differences among the 3 education subgroups were observed (p > 0.05). Conclusions: Doctors have recognized most of ICH's evidence-based practice guidelines. However, there are still large gaps between the management of ICH and the evidence-based practice guidelines in Beijing (China). Retraining doctors is required, including focusing on preventing DVT providing a value from the National Institutes of Health Stroke Scale and Glasgow Coma Scalescores at the time of admission.",Cerebrospinal Fluid Pressure-Related Features in Chronic Headache: A Prospective Study and Potential Diagnostic Implications.,https://www.ncbi.nlm.nih.gov/pubmed/30619049,Frontiers in neurology,2019 01 10,"Objective: To identify the pressure-related features of isolated cerebrospinal fluid hypertension (ICH) in order to differentiate headache sufferers with ICH from those with primary headache disorder. Methods: In this prospective study, patients with refractory chronic headaches and suspected of having cerebrospinal fluid-pressure elevation without papilledema or sixth nerve palsy, together with controls, underwent 1-h lumbar cerebrospinal fluid pressure monitoring via a spinal puncture needle. Results: We recruited 148 consecutive headache patients and 16 controls. Lumbar cerebrospinal fluid pressure monitoring showed high pressure and abnormal pressure pulsations in 93 (63 %) patients with headache: 37 of these patients with the most abnormal pressure parameters (opening pressure above 250 mm H2O, mean pressure 301 mm H2O, mean peak pressure 398 mm H2O, and severe abnormal pressure pulsations) had the most severe headaches and associated symptoms (nocturnal headache, postural headache, transient visual obscuration); 56 patients with the less abnormal pressure parameters (opening pressure between 200 and 250 mm H2O, mean pressure 228 mm H2O, mean peak pressure 316 mm H2O, and abnormal pressure pulsations) had less severe headaches and associated symptoms. Conclusions: Nocturnal and postural headache, and abnormal pressure pulsations are the more common pressure-related features of ICH in patients with chronic headache. Abnormal pressure pulsations may be considered a marker of ICH in chronic headache.",A Concomitant Muscle Injury Does Not Worsen Traumatic Brain Injury Outcomes in Mice.,https://www.ncbi.nlm.nih.gov/pubmed/30619048,Frontiers in neurology,2019 01 10,"Traumatic brain injury (TBI) often involves multitrauma in which concurrent extracranial injury occurs. We previously demonstrated that a long bone fracture exacerbates neuroinflammation and functional outcomes in mice given a TBI. Whether other forms of concomitant peripheral trauma that are common in the TBI setting, such as skeletal muscle injury, have similar effects is unknown. As such, here we developed a novel mouse multitrauma model by combining a closed-skull TBI with a cardiotoxin (CTX)-induced muscle injury to investigate whether muscle injury affects TBI outcomes. Adult male mice were assigned to four groups: sham-TBI + sham-muscle injury (SHAM); sham-TBI + CTX-muscle injury (CTX); TBI + sham-muscle injury (TBI); TBI + CTX-muscle injury (MULTI). Some mice were euthanized at 24 h post-injury to assess neuroinflammation and cerebral edema. The remaining mice underwent behavioral testing after a 30-day recovery period, and were euthanized at 35 days post-injury for post-mortem analysis. At 24 h post-injury, both TBI and MULTI mice had elevated edema, increased expression of GFAP (i.e., a marker for reactive astrocytes), and increased mRNA levels of inflammatory chemokines. There was also an effect of injury on cytokine levels at 35 days post-injury. However, the TBI and MULTI mice did not significantly differ on any of the measures assessed. These initial findings suggest that a concomitant muscle injury does not significantly affect preclinical TBI outcomes. Future studies should investigate the combination of different injury models, additional outcomes, and other post-injury time points."

In earlier studies it has been concluded that symptom burden of late stage PD patients is similar to or even higher compared with oncological patients. However, although all nine residents who took part in our study had severe limitations in performing their daily activities and experienced enormous restrictions in their mobility, they were quite content with their present living situations and did not show significant symptom burden. From the ethnographic family interviews that we conducted the following features emerged: a strong closeness in the family, an improved quality of life when the patients lived in the nursing home and fears about the future. Therefore, we concluded that living in a nursing home that provides for the needs of these patients is the best option for PD patients in the final stages of their disease as well as for their relatives.",Solitaire Thrombectomy for Acute Stroke Due to Intracranial Atherosclerosis-Related Occlusion: ROSE ASSIST Study.,https://www.ncbi.nlm.nih.gov/pubmed/30619033,Frontiers in neurology,2019 01 10,"Background: Solitaire, a representative stent retriever, has shown high performance in removing embolic clots. However, its reperfusion potential in intracranial atherosclerotic stenosis (ICAS)-related occlusions has rarely been reported. In this ROSE ASSIST study, we hypothesized that Solitaire device is as effective and safe for removing in situ thrombi in ICAS-related occlusions as it is for removal of embolic occlusions. Methods: Data from ASIAN KR, an observational multicenter registry (n = 720) enrolling patients who have undergone endovascular treatment for acute cervicocephalic artery occlusions, were retrospectively reviewed. Through blinded evaluations, occlusions were classified as ICAS-related (significant fixed focal stenosis observed at the occlusion site during endovascular treatment) or embolic (no or minimal stenosis observed). Among patients treated within 720 min after stroke onset, those who undertook Solitaire thrombectomy and whose underlying etiology was ICAS-related or embolic were included. The primary endpoint was immediate successful reperfusion (modified Treatment In Cerebral Ischemia 2b-3) after Solitaire stent retrieval. The safety endpoint included intracerebral hemorrhagic transformation and subarachnoid hemorrhage. Comparative analyses were performed between embolic and ICAS-related occlusions with 2:1 propensity score matching. Results: In total, 303 patients (embolic, 228; ICAS-related, 75) were included in the analyses. As for the primary endpoint, the immediate successful reperfusion rate following Solitaire thrombectomy did not differ between the two etiologic groups after propensity score matching (73.1% embolic vs. 65.8% ICAS-related, p = 0.261). The final successful reperfusion grade was also similar in the two groups (79.3 vs. 72.0%, p = 0.219). The grades and frequencies of intracerebral hemorrhagic transformation and subarachnoid hemorrhage did not differ between groups (p = 0.134 and p = 0.269, respectively). Conclusions: The immediate reperfusion performance in terms of thrombus removal of Solitaire thrombectomy for ICAS-related occlusions was similar to that for embolic occlusions.",The Multidisciplinary Approach to Alzheimer's Disease and Dementia. A Narrative Review of Non-Pharmacological Treatment.,https://www.ncbi.nlm.nih.gov/pubmed/30619031,Frontiers in neurology,2019 01 10,"Background: Alzheimer's disease (AD) and dementia are chronic diseases with progressive deterioration of cognition, function, and behavior leading to severe disability and death. The prevalence of AD and dementia is constantly increasing because of the progressive aging of the population. These conditions represent a considerable challenge to patients, their family and caregivers, and the health system, because of the considerable need for resources allocation. There is no disease modifying intervention for AD and dementia, and the symptomatic pharmacological treatments has limited efficacy and considerable side effects. Non-pharmacological treatment (NPT), which includes a wide range of approaches and techniques, may play a role in the treatment of AD and dementia. Aim: To review, with a narrative approach, current evidence on main NPTs for AD and dementia. Methods: PubMed and the Cochrane database of systematic reviews were searched for studies written in English and published from 2000 to 2018. The bibliography of the main articles was checked to detect other relevant papers. Results: The role of NPT has been largely explored in AD and dementia. The main NPT types, which were reviewed here, include exercise and motor rehabilitation, cognitive rehabilitation, NPT for behavioral and psychological symptoms of dementia, occupational therapy, psychological therapy, complementary and alternative medicine, and new technologies, including information and communication technologies, assistive technology and domotics, virtual reality, gaming, and telemedicine. We also summarized the role of NPT to address caregivers' burden. Conclusions: Although NPT is often applied in the multidisciplinary approach to AD and dementia, supporting evidence for their use is still preliminary. Some studies showed statistically significant effect of NPT on some outcomes, but their clinical significance is uncertain. Well-designed randomized controlled trials with innovative designs are needed to explore the efficacy of NPT in AD and dementia. Further studies are required to offer robust neurobiological grounds for the effect of NPT, and to examine its cost-efficacy profile in patients with dementia.",Eslicarbazepine Acetate Modulates EEG Activity and Connectivity in Focal Epilepsy.,https://www.ncbi.nlm.nih.gov/pubmed/30619030,Frontiers in neurology,2019 01 10,"Introduction: Eslicarbazepine acetate (ESL) is an antiepileptic drug approved as monotherapy or add-on for the treatment of epilepsy with seizures of focal onset. ESL owns a good profile in terms of efficacy and tolerability, but its effects on EEG activity and connectivity are unknown. The purpose of this study was to investigate EEG activity and connectivity changes after ESL treatment in persons with focal epilepsy (PFE). Material and Methods: We performed a multicentre, longitudinal, retrospective, quantitative EEG study on a population of 22 PFE, and a group of 40 controls. We investigated the ESL-related changes of EEG power spectral activity and global connectivity [phase locking value (PLV), amplitude envelope correlation (AEC) and amplitude envelope correlation of orthogonalized signals (Ortho-AEC)] for standard frequency bands (delta to gamma). Seizure frequency was evaluated to assess ESL efficacy in our cohort. Results: ESL significantly enhanced both global power spectral density and connectivity for all frequency bands, similarly for all connectivity measures. When compared to the control group, Post-ESL power was significantly higher in theta and gamma band. Pre-ESL connectivity values were significantly lower than control for all frequency bands. Post-ESL connectivity increased and the gap between the two groups was no longer significant. ESL induced a 52.7 ± 41.1% reduction of seizure frequency, with 55% of clinical responders (reduction of seizures ≥50%). Discussion: ESL therapy induces significant enhancement of brain activity and connectivity. Post-ESL connectivity profile of epilepsy patients was similar to the one of healthy controls.",Endovascular Treatment of Atherosclerotic Tandem Occlusions in Anterior Circulation Stroke: Technical Aspects and Complications Compared to Isolated Intracranial Occlusions.,https://www.ncbi.nlm.nih.gov/pubmed/30619028,Frontiers in neurology,2019 01 10,"Background and Purpose: Endovascular treatment of tandem occlusions is an emerging option. We describe our multicenter experience with endovascular management of atherosclerotic tandem occlusions in the anterior circulation, particularly the technical aspects and complications in comparison to isolated intracranial occlusions. Materials and Methods: Consecutive patients with tandem occlusions due to atherosclerotic causes who underwent mechanical thrombectomy at two major stroke centers between January 2010 and September 2015 were reviewed. Clinical data, procedural aspects, recanalization rates, complication rates, and clinical outcome were analyzed and compared to findings in patients with isolated intracranial occlusions. Results: One hundred and twenty-one patients with tandem occlusions and 456 patients with isolated intracranial occlusions (carotid-T/M1) were included. Mean intervention time was faster (33 min vs. 57 min, p < 0.001) and recanalization success was higher (TICI 2b/3 83.6 vs. 70.2%, p = 0.002) in patients with isolated occlusions. No difference was seen in clinical outcome and complications, except for a higher rate of asymptomatic hemorrhage in the tandem group (29.8 vs. 17.1%, p = 0.003). Choice of recanalization approach (antegrade vs. retrograde) in the tandem group made no difference, except for a trend toward less distal emboli using the retrograde approach (4.0 vs. 13.0%, p = 0.082). Stenting of the extracranial internal carotid artery (ICA) was performed in 81%, PTA alone in 7.4%, and deferred stenting in 11.6%. Rate of stent/ICA occlusion within 7 days was 10.3% after stenting and 33.3% after PTA (p = 0.127). In the tandem group, age (p = 0.034), National Institutes of Health Stroke Scale score (NIHSS) at admission (p = 0.002), recanalization rate (p < 0.001), complications (p = 0.016), and symptomatic intracranial hemorrhage (sICH) (p = 0.001) were associated with poor outcome, whereas extracranial treatment modality and stent/ICA occlusion within 7 days did not affect outcome. Conclusion: Endovascular treatment of tandem occlusions is technically feasible, achieves recanalization rates and rates of good clinical outcome comparable to those in patients with isolated intracranial occlusions. Following acute ICA stenting, the risk of stent occlusion and sICH appeared to be low, but was associated with an increased rate of asymptomatic ICH.",Reliability of Wearable-Sensor-Derived Measures of Physical Activity in Wheelchair-Dependent Spinal Cord Injured Patients.,https://www.ncbi.nlm.nih.gov/pubmed/30619026,Frontiers in neurology,2019 01 10,"Physical activity (PA) has been shown to have a positive influence on functional recovery in patients after a spinal cord injury (SCI). Hence, it can act as a confounder in clinical intervention studies. Wearable sensors are used to quantify PA in various neurological conditions. However, there is a lack of knowledge about the inter-day reliability of PA measures. The objective of this study was to investigate the single-day reliability of various PA measures in patients with a SCI and to propose recommendations on how many days of PA measurements are required to obtain reliable results. For this, PA of 63 wheelchair-dependent patients with a SCI were measured using wearable sensors. Patients of all age ranges (49.3 ± 16.6 years) and levels of injury (from C1 to L2, ASIA A-D) were included for this study and assessed at three to four different time periods during inpatient rehabilitation (2 weeks, 1 month, 3 months, and if applicable 6 months after injury) and after in-patient rehabilitation in their home-environment (at least 6 months after injury). The metrics of interest were total activity counts, PA intensity levels, metrics of wheeling quantity and metrics of movement quality. Activity counts showed consistently high single-day reliabilities, while measures of PA intensity levels considerably varied depending on the rehabilitation progress. Single-day reliabilities of metrics of movement quantity decreased with rehabilitation progress, while metrics of movement quality increased. To achieve a mean reliability of 0.8, we found that three continuous recording days are required for out-patients, and 2 days for in-patients. Furthermore, the results show similar weekday and weekend wheeling activity for in- and out-patients. To our knowledge, this is the first study to investigate the reliability of an extended set of sensor-based measures of PA in both acute and chronic wheelchair-dependent SCI patients. The results provide recommendations for sensor-based assessments of PA in clinical SCI studies.",Multimodal Data and Machine Learning for Detecting Specific Biomarkers in Pediatric Epilepsy Patients With Generalized Tonic-Clonic Seizures.,https://www.ncbi.nlm.nih.gov/pubmed/30619025,Frontiers in neurology,2019 01 10,"Previous neuroimaging studies of epilepsy with generalized tonic-clonic seizures (GTCS) focus mainly on adults. However, the neural mechanisms that underline this type of epilepsy remain unclear, especially for children. The aim of the present study was to detect the effect of epilepsy on brains of children with GTCS and to investigate whether the changes in the brain can be used to discriminate between epileptic children and healthy children at the level of the individual. To achieve this purpose, we measured gray matter (GM) volume and fractional amplitude of low-frequency fluctuation (fALFF) differences on multimodel magnetic resonance imaging in 14 children with GTCS and 30 age- and gender-matched healthy controls. The patients showed GM volume reduction and a fALFF increase in the thalamus, hippocampus, temporal and other deep nuclei. A significant decrease of fALFF was mainly found in the default mode network (DMN). In addition, epileptic duration was significantly negatively related to the GM volumes and significantly positively related to the fALFF value of right thalamus. A support vector machine (SVM) applied to the GM volume of the right thalamus correctly identified epileptic children with a statistically significant accuracy of 74.42% (P < 0.002). A SVM applied to the fALFF of the right thalamus correctly identified epileptic children with a statistically significant accuracy of 83.72% (P < 0.002). The consistent neuroimaging results indicated that the right thalamus plays an important role in reflecting the chronic damaging effect of GTCS epilepsy in children. The length of time of a child's epileptic history was correlated with greater GM volume reduction and a fALFF increase in the right thalamus. GM volumes and fALFF values in the right thalamus can identify children with GTCS from the healthy controls with high accuracy and at an individual subject level. These results are likely to be valuable in explaining the clinical problems and understanding the brain abnormalities underlying this disorder.",Monitoring Motor Symptoms During Activities of Daily Living in Individuals With Parkinson's Disease.,https://www.ncbi.nlm.nih.gov/pubmed/30619024,Frontiers in neurology,2019 01 10,"This literature review addressed wearable sensor systems to monitor motor symptoms in individuals with Parkinson's disease (PD) during activities of daily living (ADLs). Specifically, progress in monitoring tremor, freezing of gait, dyskinesia, bradykinesia, and hypokinesia was reviewed. Twenty-seven studies were found that met the criteria of measuring symptoms in a home or home-like setting, with some studies examining multiple motor disorders. Accelerometers, gyroscopes, and electromyography sensors were included, with some studies using more than one type of sensor. Five studies measured tremor, five studies examined bradykinesia or hypokinesia, thirteen studies included devices to measure dyskinesia or motor fluctuations, and ten studies measured akinesia or freezing of gait. Current sensor technology can detect the presence and severity of each of these symptoms; however, most systems require sensors on multiple body parts, which is challenging for remote or ecologically valid observation. Different symptoms are detected by different sensor placement, suggesting that the goal of detecting all symptoms with a reduced set of sensors may not be achievable. For the goal of monitoring motor symptoms during ADLs in a home setting, the measurement system should be simple to use, unobtrusive to the wearer and easy for an individual with PD to put on and take off. Machine learning algorithms such as neural networks appear to be the most promising way to detect symptoms using a small number of sensors. More work should be done validating the systems during unscripted and unconstrained ADLs rather than in scripted motions.",A Meta-Analysis of α-Synuclein Multiplication in Familial Parkinsonism.,https://www.ncbi.nlm.nih.gov/pubmed/30619023,Frontiers in neurology,2019 01 10,"Chronic alpha-synuclein (SNCA) overexpression is a relatively homogenous and well-defined cause of parkinsonism and dementia. Parkinson's disease (PD), PD with dementia, dementia with Lewy bodies and multiple system atrophy all manifest in SNCA multiplication families. Herein we summarize genealogic, clinical and genetic data from 59 families (25 not previously published) with parkinsonism caused by SNCA multiplications. Longitudinal clinical assessments and genealogic relationships were documented for all family members. All probands were genotyped with an Illumina MEGA high-density genotyping array to identify copy number variants (CNV) and enable SNCA multiplication breakpoints to be defined. Three SNCA short tandem repeat (STR) markers were genotyped in all available samples to validate genomic dosage and inheritance. A web-application was built as a forum for future data sharing. CNV analysis identified 49 subjects with heterozygous SNCA duplication (CNV3), 2 with homozygous duplication (CNV4) and 7 with a triplication mutation (CNV4). Clinical presentations varied greatly throughout the cohort. SNCA dosage correlates with disease onset (mean age of onset CNV3: 46.9 ± 10.5 years vs. 34.5 ± 7.4 CNV4, p = 0.003). Atypical or more severe clinical courses were described in several patients and dementia was noted in 50.9% of the probands. Neither the multiplication size (average 2.05 ± 2.45 Mb) nor the number of genes included (range 1-50) was associated with motor symptom onset or dementia. Families with SNCA multiplication are rare and globally-distributed. Nevertheless, they may both inform and benefit from the development of SNCA targeted therapeutic strategies relevant to the treatment of all alpha-synucleinopathies.",Searching for Judgment Biases Among Elite Basketball Referees.,https://www.ncbi.nlm.nih.gov/pubmed/30619022,Frontiers in psychology,2019 01 10,"An attacking basketball player initiating significant physical contact with a defender who has already established a legal and stationary position, should be called with an offensive foul. Offensive foul situations are particularly ambiguous and complex, making the referee's task a difficult one. In such conditions of complexity and constraints of time, the referee is likely to be prone to systematic biases, as has been documented by previous research in other sport settings. We analyzed the referees' decisions in 250 instances of collisions between an attacking player and a defender. In these collisions the defender fell, and potentially an offensive foul could be called. We found no evidence of favoritism granted to the home team, to star players, or to high-reputation teams, or of small players being tackled by significantly larger opponents. The findings suggest that these biases are not very robust, and are sensitive to the context, and that proper training of referees and enhanced awareness can help to alleviate referees' biases."

Less is known about the influence of aerobic exercise in healthy samples (particularly working age), and of different fitness levels on cognition. Two hypotheses were posed: (1) low fitness levels, compared to moderate and high, will be related to poorer cognitive performance, and (2) breakpoints for the beneficial relationship between VO2 and cognition will be observed within the moderate-to-high fitness span. Design and Methods: The sample consisted of n=362 office workers. A submaximal cycle ergometer test estimated maximal oxygen consumption (VO2max, mL·kg-1·min-1). Based on estimated VO2max participants were split into tertiles; low (n = 121), moderate (n = 119), and high (n = 122). A cognitive test battery (9 tests), assessed processing speed, working memory, executive functions and episodic memory. Results: Both hypotheses were confirmed. Groups of moderate (≈40) and high (≈49) fitness outperformed the group of low (≈31) fitness for inhibition and episodic recognition, whereas no significant differences between moderate and high fitness were observed (ANCOVAs). Breakpoints between benefits fromVO2max for inhibition and recognition were estimated to ≈44/43 mL·kg-1·min-1 (multivariate broken line regressions). Conclusions: Results suggest that it is conceivable to expect a beneficial relationship between VO2max and some cognitive domains up to a certain fitness level. In a sample of healthy office workers, this level was estimated to 44 mL·kg-1·min-1. This has implications on organizational and societal levels; where incentives to improve fitness levels from low to moderate could yield desirable cognitive and health benefits in adults.",A Review of Behavioral Observation Coding Approaches for the Trier Social Stress Test for Children.,https://www.ncbi.nlm.nih.gov/pubmed/30619010,Frontiers in psychology,2019 01 10,"The Trier Social Stress Test (TSST) has become one of the most widely-used protocols for inducing moderate psychosocial stress in laboratory settings. Observational coding has been used to measure a range of behavioral responses to the TSST including performance, reactions to the task, and markers of stress induced by the task, with clear advantages given increased objectivity of observational measurement over self-report measures. The current review systematically examined all TSST and TSST-related studies with children and adolescents published since the original work of Kirschbaum et al. (1993) to identify behavioral observation coding approaches for the TSST. The search resulted in 29 published articles, dissertations, and master's theses with a wide range of coding approaches used. The take-home finding from the current review is that there is no standard way to code the Trier Social Stress Test for Children (TSST-C), which appears to stem from the uniqueness of investigators' research questions and sample demographics. This lack of standardization prohibits conclusive comparisons between studies and samples. We discuss relevant implications and offer suggestions for future research.","Spatial Presentations, but Not Response Formats Influence Spatial-Numerical Associations in Adults.",https://www.ncbi.nlm.nih.gov/pubmed/30619009,Frontiers in psychology,2019 01 10,"According to theories of embodied numerosity, processing of numerical magnitude is anchored in bodily experiences. In particular, spatial representations of number interact with movement in physical space, but it is still unclear whether the extent of the movement is relevant for this interaction. In this study, we compared spatial-numerical associations over response movements of differing spatial expansion. We expected spatial-numerical effects to increase with the extent of physical response movements. In addition, we hypothesized that these effects should be influenced by whether or not a spatial representation of numbers was presented. Adult participants performed two tasks: a magnitude classification (comparing numbers to the fixed standard 5), from which we calculated the Spatial Numerical Association of Response Codes (SNARC) effect; and a magnitude comparison task (comparing two numbers against each other), from which we calculated a relative numerical congruity effect (NCE), which describes that when two relatively small numbers are compared, responses to the smaller number are faster than responses to the larger number; and vice versa for large numbers. A SNARC effect was observed across all conditions and was not influenced by response movement extent but increased when a number line was presented. In contrast, an NCE was only observed when no number line was presented. This suggests that the SNARC effect and the NCE reflect two different processes. The SNARC effect seems to represent a highly automated classification of numbers as large or small, which is further emphasized by the presentation of a number line. In contrast, the NCE likely results from participants not only classifying numbers as small or large, but also processing their relative size within the relevant section of their mental number line representation. An additional external presentation of a number line might interfere with this process, resulting in overall slower responses. This study follows up on previous spatial-numerical training studies and has implications for future spatial-numerical trainings. Specifically, similar studies with children showed contrasting results, in that response format but not number line presentation influenced spatial-numerical associations. Accordingly, during development, the relative relevance of physical experiences and presentation format for spatial-numerical associations might change.",Analysis of the Mediating Role of Self-Efficacy and Self-Esteem on the Effect of Workload on Burnout's Influence on Nurses' Plans to Work Longer.,https://www.ncbi.nlm.nih.gov/pubmed/30619007,Frontiers in psychology,2019 01 10,"At the present time, we know that there is a positive relationship between self-efficacy and self-esteem in which positive beliefs about one's own efficacy increase one's sense of self-worth as stressful situations of a heavy workload are coped with successfully, and this, in turn, affects the nurses' plans to work longer. Analyze the mediating role of self-efficacy and self-esteem in the effect of workload, measured as the number of users attended to during a workday, on burnout in nursing professionals. A sample of 1307 nurses aged 22 to 60 years who were administered the Brief Burnout Questionnaire, the General Self-Efficacy Scale, and the Rosenberg Self-Esteem Scale, and workload, measured as the number of users attended to during the workday. The results show that professionals with high levels of self-efficacy also scored higher on global self-esteem. Burnout correlated negatively with both variables (self-efficacy and self-esteem). Three clusters were found with the variables (self-efficacy, self-esteem, and workload) showing significant differences in burnout scores among clusters. Self-efficacy and self-esteem function as buffers of the negative effects of workload on burnout. Organizations should design interventions for promoting the personal resources of their workers through training activities and organizational resources (e.g., redesigning job positions) to promote satisfaction and wellbeing of employees, making their stay at work greater.",Internet Use Influences Self-Related Process: Evidence From Behavior and ERPs.,https://www.ncbi.nlm.nih.gov/pubmed/30619006,Frontiers in psychology,2019 01 10,"The present study aimed to examine whether a self-related stimulus produces a self-related process bias between pathological-tendency Internet users and ordinary Internet users. Participants were asked to judge the color of the target stimulus' frame (Internet pictures) in an implicit priming task, which enclosed the prime of self/other related words and the target of the online image in sequence. Results from Experiment 1 showed that response time (RT) in the self-related condition was significantly longer than that of the other related condition. Further analysis showed that RT in the self-related condition was significantly longer than that under the other related conditions for pathological-tendency Internet users but not for ordinary Internet users. In Experiment 2, behavior results demonstrated that RT under the self-related condition was significantly longer than that in the other-related condition for both groups, and the RT was shorter for pathological-tendency Internet users than that of the ordinary Internet users. Moreover, ERP data showed that the N2 amplitude was larger in the self-related condition than that of other related conditions for pathological-tendency Internet users but not for ordinary Internet users. The amplitudes of late positive component (LPC) was smaller in the self-related condition than those of the other related conditions. Hence, the Internet use influenced the inhibition control in self-unrelated stimuli and automatically retrieved the self-related stimuli.",Testing Is More Desirable When It Is Adaptive and Still Desirable When Compared to Note-Taking.,https://www.ncbi.nlm.nih.gov/pubmed/30619005,Frontiers in psychology,2019 01 10,"Testing is a well-established desirable difficulty. Yet there are still some open issues regarding the benefits of testing that need to be addressed. First, the possibility to increase its benefits by adapting the sequence of test questions to the learners' level of knowledge has scarcely been explored. In view of theories that emphasize the benefits of adapting learning tasks to learner knowledge, it is reasonable to assume that the common practice of providing all learners with the same test questions is not optimal. Second, it is an open question as to whether the testing effect prevails if stronger control conditions than the typical restudy condition are used. We addressed these issues in an experiment with N = 200 university students who were randomly assigned to (a) adaptive testing, (b) non-adaptive testing, or note-taking (c) without or (d) with focus guidance. In an initial study phase, all participants watched an e-lecture. Afterward, they processed its content according to their assigned conditions. One week later, all learners took a posttest. As main results, we found that adaptive testing yielded higher learning outcomes than non-adaptive testing. These benefits were mediated by the adaptive learners' higher testing performance and lower perceived cognitive demand during testing. Furthermore, we found that both testing groups outperformed the note-taking groups. Jointly, our results show that the benefits of testing can be enhanced by adapting the sequence of test questions to learners' knowledge and that testing can be more effective than note-taking.","Strategies to Deal With Suicide and Non-suicidal Self-Injury in Borderline Personality Disorder, the Case of DBT.",https://www.ncbi.nlm.nih.gov/pubmed/30619004,Frontiers in psychology,2019 01 10,"One of the most problematic aspects of borderline personality disorder resides in repeated non-suicidal self-injury (NSSI) and suicide attempts. These behaviors constitute the prime therapeutic target and a factor that complicates patient care, namely in terms of therapeutic continuity. It has been demonstrated that Dialectical Behavior Therapy (DBT) is efficient in reducing the symptomatology of this disorder, as well as NSSI and suicide. DBT is a multi-component psychotherapeutic treatment, and the effectiveness of its individual constituents is therefore a relevant question. Studies comparing its various components (individual therapy, group therapy, and standard DBT) have not revealed any marked difference between them, other than a tendency toward improved patient retention rates in the standard version of the treatment. The aim of this study is to review the various components of DBT and their constituent parts, in order to highlight the importance of focusing on self-harm behaviors within the therapy as a whole. Although therapeutic strategies may differ and target directly suicide or NSSI, managing the quality of life, and the persistence of the therapeutic alliance (and of the interpersonal alliance) is equally important in terms of treatment efficacy.",Neurodiversity and Artistic Performance Characteristic of Children With Autism Spectrum Disorder.,https://www.ncbi.nlm.nih.gov/pubmed/30619003,Frontiers in psychology,2019 01 10,"Neurodiversity refers to the notion that seemingly 'impaired' cognitive as well as emotional features characteristic of developmental disorders such as autism spectrum disorder (ASD) fall into normal human behavioral variations that should enjoy some selective advantages. In the present experiment, the author compared what was depicted in subjects' drawings after they experienced an identical event, e.g., going on a picnic to a garden in the vicinity of their nursery school, between children with ASD and IQ-matched, typically developing (TD) children. When the material was coded according to types of drawn objects, such as human, animal, plant, food, vehicle, building, and others, the overall variability of the objects did not differ between TD children and children with ASD. However, TD children were more likely than children with ASD to depict human images. Conversely, other objects were more likely to be drawn by children with ASD than by TD children. While TD children were more likely to focus on humans than on non-human objects when drawing, children with ASD were more likely to focus on non-human objects than on humans even after both had experienced an identical event. The author argues that such findings are empirical evidence for the claim that there is some selective advantage of enhanced capabilities characteristic of ASD, i.e., neurodiversity, that may represent a balance toward ""folk physics"" at the expense of ""folk psychology.""",Beyond PTSD and Fear-Based Conditioning: Anger-Related Responses Following Experiences of Forced Migration-A Systematic Review.,https://www.ncbi.nlm.nih.gov/pubmed/30619002,Frontiers in psychology,2019 01 10,"Introduction: Experiences of forced migration include traumas that are interpersonal in nature, as well as ongoing emotional responses, stress, and frustration in post-migration setti ngs. Open questions exist, regarding anger/anger-like responses following experiences of persecution and ongoing stress. The aim of this study was to explore the adaptive and maladaptive underlying mechanisms of anger/anger-like responses, cultural, linguistic, and social contingencies, and possible interventions for problematic anger behavior. Method: We searched two databases (PsycINFO and PILOTS) with the following search terms: (refugee OR ""asylum seek*"" OR IDP OR ""internal* displac*"" OR ""forced migra*"" OR ""involuntary migra*"") AND anger. Findings: This search yielded 34 studies that were included in the final review. Although, anger is a moral, adaptive, and prosocial response, dysfunctional anger/anger-like responses arise from PTSD, ""moral injury,"" complicated grief, and independent forms of anger behavior. Cultural, linguistic, and social issues also emerged from the search. Finally, considerations for treatment and intervention are discussed. Discussion: Anger responses following experiences of forced migration may require assessment beyond PTSD models currently framed by DSM and ICD. A very promising framework is the Adaptation and Development after Persecution and Trauma (ADAPT) model. Implications: Further longitudinal and epidemiological research will be necessary to continue testing the ADAPT model and to begin the process of assessing its cross-cultural coherence in other refugee populations (e.g., see Hinton et al., 2003). As anger behavior is also a societal issue, avenues for reconciliation, expression of grievances, employment, civic participation, and integration are needed.",Anthropomorphism in Human-Animal Interactions: A Pragmatist View.,https://www.ncbi.nlm.nih.gov/pubmed/30619001,Frontiers in psychology,2019 01 10,"This paper explores anthropomorphism in human-animal interactions from the theoretical perspectives of pragmatism and anthropology of human-animal communication. Its aim is to challenge the conception of anthropomorphism as the attribution/inference of human properties to a non-human animal - particularly as a special case of the theory of mind. The author's goal is to articulate a plausible an alternative conception of anthropomorphism as a situated direct perception of human properties by someone who is engaged in a given situation and sensitive to what the animal is doing to them. Rooted in pragmatist theory as well as in contemporary anthropological studies, this paper offers an original perspective for in depth ethnographic and empirical studies of anthropomorphism-in-situation. Such studies could bring new insights in the study of how ordinary people make sense of animal behaviors in real-life situations."

Mental Health Trainees' Perceptions of a Client With Anorexia Nervosa Symptoms.,https://www.ncbi.nlm.nih.gov/pubmed/30618990,Frontiers in psychology,2019 01 10,"This study examined the effect of client body mass index (BMI) on diagnostic impressions and perceptions of mental health trainees. Participants read a vignette of a mock female client presenting for treatment with symptoms of anorexia nervosa. Participants were randomly assigned to one of three conditions in which the client was described as ""underweight,"" ""normal weight,"" or ""overweight."" Results revealed that participants assigned to the ""underweight"" condition diagnosed the client with anorexia nervosa or atypical anorexia nervosa more frequently than participants assigned to the ""overweight"" or ""normal weight"" conditions. There was no difference based on client BMI when the more general diagnosis of other specified feeding or eating disorder (OSFED; previously known as eating disorder not otherwise specified [EDNOS]) was included, however. Participants in the ""overweight"" and ""normal weight"" conditions recommended fewer therapy sessions for the client than participants in the ""underweight"" condition. Furthermore, participants more strongly endorsed weight-based stereotypes to describe the client when she was ""overweight"" than ""normal weight"" or ""underweight."" Contrary to hypotheses, however, participants reported moderately positive attitudes toward treating the client regardless of BMI. These preliminary findings support initiatives aimed at providing training on weight stigma and eating disorders to mental health professionals.",The Projective Consciousness Model and Phenomenal Selfhood.,https://www.ncbi.nlm.nih.gov/pubmed/30618988,Frontiers in psychology,2019 01 10,"We summarize our recently introduced Projective Consciousness Model (PCM) (Rudrauf et al., 2017) and relate it to outstanding conceptual issues in the theory of consciousness. The PCM combines a projective geometrical model of the perspectival phenomenological structure of the field of consciousness with a variational Free Energy minimization model of active inference, yielding an account of the cybernetic function of consciousness, viz., the modulation of the field's cognitive and affective dynamics for the effective control of embodied agents. The geometrical and active inference components are linked via the concept of projective transformation, which is crucial to understanding how conscious organisms integrate perception, emotion, memory, reasoning, and perspectival imagination in order to control behavior, enhance resilience, and optimize preference satisfaction. The PCM makes substantive empirical predictions and fits well into a (neuro)computationalist framework. It also helps us to account for aspects of subjective character that are sometimes ignored or conflated: pre-reflective self-consciousness, the first-person point of view, the sense of minenness or ownership, and social self-consciousness. We argue that the PCM, though still in development, offers us the most complete theory to date of what Thomas Metzinger has called ""phenomenal selfhood.""",State Anxiety Impairs Proactive but Enhances Reactive Control.,https://www.ncbi.nlm.nih.gov/pubmed/30618987,Frontiers in psychology,2019 01 11,"Cognitive control is a construct that prioritizes how we process stimuli and information to flexibly and efficiently adapt to internal goals and external environmental changes. The Dual Mechanism of Control (DMC) theory delineates two distinct cognitive control operations: proactive control and reactive control (Braver, 2012). Anxiety has been posited to differentially affect proactive and reactive control, due to its influence on working memory and attention allocation (Eysenck et al., 2007; Fales et al., 2008). However, no study has yet directly compared the influence of anxiety on proactive and reactive control in the same individuals. In this study, we examined how state anxiety affected proactive control, using the AX-continuous performance task (AX-CPT), and reactive control, using the classic Stroop task. Based on theory and previous investigations, we expected that state anxiety would enhance reactive control but impair proactive control. Consistent with our predictions, we found that state anxiety, induced with a threat of shock manipulation, inhibited proactive control on the AX-CPT test, but increased reactive control in the Stroop task. Anxiety may impair proactive control in contexts requiring goal maintenance by occupying limited working memory capacity, whereas it may enhance reactive control via facilitated attention allocation to threat and engaging the conflict monitoring system to quickly modify behavior.",Unconditional Perseveration of the Short-Term Mental Set in Chunk Decomposition.,https://www.ncbi.nlm.nih.gov/pubmed/30618985,Frontiers in psychology,2019 01 10,"A mental set generally refers to the brain's tendency to stick with the most familiar solution to a problem and stubbornly ignore alternatives. This tendency is likely driven by previous knowledge (the long-term mental set) or is a temporary by-product of procedural learning (the short-term mental set). A similar problem situation is considered the factor required for perseveration of the long-term mental set, which may not be essential for the short-term mental set. To reveal the boundary conditions for perseveration of the short-term mental set, this study adopted a Chinese character decomposition task. Participants were asked to perform a practice problem that could be solved by a familiar loose chunk decomposition (loose solution) followed by a test problem, or they were asked to repeatedly perform 5-8practice problems followed by a test problem; the former is the base-set condition, and the latter is the enhanced-set condition. In Experiment 1, the test problem situation appeared to be similar to the practice problem and could be solved using the reinforced loose solution and also an unfamiliar tight chunk decomposition (tight solution) (a 2-solution problem). In Experiment 2, the test problem situation differed from the practice problem and could only be solved using an unfamiliar tight solution (a 1-solution problem). The results showed that, when comparing the enhanced-set and base-set conditions, both the accuracy rate and the response times for solving the test problem with a tight solution were worse in Experiment 1, whereas the response times were worse in Experiment 2. We concluded that perseveration of the short-term mental set was independent of the similarity between problem situations and discuss the differences in perseveration between two types of fixation.",The N1-N2-LPC Pattern in Processing Advertising Pictorial Metaphors: An ERP Study.,https://www.ncbi.nlm.nih.gov/pubmed/30618984,Frontiers in psychology,2019 01 10,"We investigated what the temporal processing is of advertising pictorial metaphors. After presenting ""a word of product"" and ""its advertising pictures,"" the experiment instructed participants to make a follow-up true-false judgment considering what the picture intended to suggest. A repeated-measures ANOVAs for a 2 (picture type: metaphor, non-metaphor) × 2 (prime-target condition: congruent, incongruent) × 3 (electrode site: Fz, Cz, Pz) experimental condition was conducted on three components, N1 (100-150 ms), N2 (200-300 ms), and LPC (400-600 ms and 600-1,000 ms). The results show that metaphor pictures elicited larger amplitude in N1 (broadly distributed), N2 (frontally biased) and LPC (parietally biased), roughly reflecting an entire process with an initial response to visual onsets, an early recognition of semantic violations and a prolonged reanalysis process of semantic integration. We argue that, different than verbal metaphors, this faster processing occurred due to the involvement of visual pathway.",Developmental Differences in Filtering Auditory and Visual Distractors During Visual Selective Attention.,https://www.ncbi.nlm.nih.gov/pubmed/30618983,Frontiers in psychology,2019 01 10,"The current experiment examined changes in visual selective attention in young children, older children, young adults, and older adults while participants were instructed to ignore auditory and visual distractors. The aims of the study were to: (a) determine if the Perceptual Load Hypothesis (PLH) (distraction greater under low perceptual load) could predict which irrelevant stimuli would disrupt visual selective attention, and (b) if auditory to visual shifts found in modality dominance research could be extended to selective attention tasks. Overall, distractibility decreased with age, with incompatible distractors having larger costs in young and older children than adults. In regard to accuracy, visual distractibility did not differ across age nor load, whereas, auditory interference was more pronounced early in development and correlated with age. Auditory and visual distractors also slowed down responses in young and older children more than adults. Finally, the PLH did not predict performance. Rather, children often showed the opposite pattern, with visual distractors having a greater cost in the high load condition (older children) and auditory distractors having a greater cost in the high load condition (young children). These findings are consistent with research examining the development of modality dominance and shed light on changes in multisensory processing and selective attention across the lifespan.",Sex Differences in Gains Among Hispanic Pre-kindergartners' Mental Rotation Skills.,https://www.ncbi.nlm.nih.gov/pubmed/30618982,Frontiers in psychology,2019 01 10,"The current study explores change in mental rotation skills throughout the pre-kindergarten year in a Hispanic population to better understand the development of early sex differences in mental rotation. Ninety-six Hispanic children (M = 4 years 8 months) completed a mental rotation task at the beginning and end of pre-kindergarten. Results suggest Hispanic boys and girls differed in gains on mental rotation ability, with boys improving significantly more than girls during pre-kindergarten on a mental rotation task. This study highlights the significance of studying mental rotation abilities in a Hispanic population of pre-kindergarten aged children and suggests the importance of examining sex differences in mental rotation over time, rather than at one time-point, to better understand when sex differences in spatial skills develop. We discuss various factors that potentially affect the growth of spatial skills including the role of early education, spatial experiences, and spatial language input.",Expectations About Satiety and Thirst Are Modified by Acute Motivational State.,https://www.ncbi.nlm.nih.gov/pubmed/30618980,Frontiers in psychology,2019 01 10,"Prior research has shown that consumers have clear and measurable expectations about the likely effects of food and drink items on their appetite and thirst, which are acquired with experience and influenced by a product's taste and texture. What is unclear is whether expression of these expectations also varies with current appetitive state. It is possible that current appetite could increase or decrease the relevance of these expectations for future food choice and magnify a product's expected impact on appetite. To test this, we contrasted expectations about satiety and thirst for four products consumed 2 h after an appetite manipulation at breakfast, achieved through ad libitum access to low-energy drinks only (hunger condition), cereal only but no drinks (thirst condition) or both foods and drinks (sated condition). The test products were two soups and two drinks, with a thicker and thinner version of each product type to act as positive control to ensure sensitivity in detecting differences in expectations. For satiety, the predicted differences between products were seen: soups and thicker products were expected to be more filling and to suppress subsequent hunger more than drinks and thinner products, but these differences were more pronounced in the hunger than thirsty or sated conditions. Being thirsty also enhanced expectations of how much drinks would appease immediate thirst. Overall the data show that expectations were adjusted subtly by a person's current appetitive state, suggesting that we have mechanisms that highlight the most important features of a product at the time when it may be most beneficial to the consumer.",Current Practices in Data Analysis Procedures in Psychology: What Has Changed?,https://www.ncbi.nlm.nih.gov/pubmed/30618979,Frontiers in psychology,2019 01 10,"This paper analyzes current practices in psychology in the use of research methods and data analysis procedures (DAP) and aims to determine whether researchers are now using more sophisticated and advanced DAP than were employed previously. We reviewed empirical research published recently in prominent journals from the USA and Europe corresponding to the main psychological categories of Journal Citation Reports and examined research methods, number of studies, number and type of DAP, and statistical package. The 288 papers reviewed used 663 different DAP. Experimental and correlational studies were the most prevalent, depending on the specific field of psychology. Two-thirds of the papers reported a single study, although those in journals with an experimental focus typically described more. The papers mainly used parametric tests for comparison and statistical techniques for analyzing relationships among variables. Regarding the former, the most frequently used procedure was ANOVA, with mixed factorial ANOVA being the most prevalent. A decline in the use of non-parametric analysis was observed in relation to previous research. Relationships among variables were most commonly examined using regression models, with hierarchical regression and mediation analysis being the most prevalent procedures. There was also a decline in the use of stepwise regression and an increase in the use of structural equation modeling, confirmatory factor analysis, and hierarchical linear modeling. Overall, the results show that recent empirical studies published in journals belonging to the main areas of psychology are employing more varied and advanced statistical techniques of greater computational complexity.",Spatial and Spectral Auditory Temporal-Order Judgment (TOJ) Tasks in Elderly People Are Performed Using Different Perceptual Strategies.,https://www.ncbi.nlm.nih.gov/pubmed/30618978,Frontiers in psychology,2019 01 10,"The Temporal-Order Judgment (TOJ) paradigm has been widely investigated in previous studies as an accurate measure of temporal resolution and sequencing abilities in the millisecond time range. Two auditory TOJ tasks are often used: (1) a spatial TOJ task, in which two identical stimuli are presented in rapid succession monaurally and the task is to indicate which ear received the first stimulus and which ear received the second one (left-right or right-left), and (2) a spectral TOJ task, in which two tones of different frequencies are presented asynchronously to both ears binaurally and the task is to report the sequence of these tones (low-high or high-low). The previous literature studies conducted on young volunteers indicated that the measured temporal acuity on these two tasks depended on the procedure used. As considerable data are now available about age-related decline in temporal resolution ability, the aim of the present study was to compare in elderly subjects the pattern of performance on these two tasks. A total of 40 normal healthy volunteers aged from 62 to 78 years performed two TOJ tasks. The measurement was repeated in two consecutive sessions. Temporal resolution was indexed by the Auditory Temporal-Order Threshold (ATOT), i.e., the minimum time gap between successive stimuli necessary for a participant to report a before-after relation with 75% correctness. The main finding of the present study was the indication of differences in the elderly in performance on two tasks. In the spatial task, the distribution of obtained ATOT values did not deviate from the Gaussian distribution. In contrast, the distribution of data in the spectral task deviated significantly from the Gaussian and was spread more to the right. Although lower ATOT values were usually observed in Session 2 than in Session 1, such difference was significant only in the spectral task. We conclude that although temporal acuity and sequencing abilities in the millisecond time range are probably based in neuronal oscillatory activity, the measured ATOTs in the elderly seem to be stimulus-dependent, procedure-related, and influenced by the perceptual strategies used by participants."

Surprisingly, there is no study that directly examines whether country moderates the workaholism-burnout association. To address this research question, we have collected independent work samples from two culturally diverse countries, namely the People's Republic of China and the United States. A total of 2243 participants (1243 American respondents and 1000 Chinese respondents) were recruited. Preliminary group comparison suggested that there were statistical differences among participants from different industries on the key variables, including workaholism, job demands, autonomy and emotional exhaustion. Therefore, we have divided our participants into three subsamples [i.e., (1) natural resources, mining and construction industry, (2) manufacturing industry, and (3) service industry] and separate analyses were conducted. In the moderated regression analyses, workaholism significantly predicted two dimensions of job burnout, namely emotional exhaustion and depersonalization, even when job demand and job autonomy were controlled. Finally, although two significant moderating effects were found, there was a lack of consistent empirical support to the hypothesized moderating effect of country on workaholism-burnout association.

In this study, facial expressions of emotion produced by community participants in an initial screening interview in a mock crime experiment were coded for occurrence and duration. Various expression durations were tested concerning whether they differentiated between truthtellers and liars concerning their intent to commit a malicious act in the future. We operationalized microexpressions as expressions occurring less than the duration of spontaneously occurring, non-concealed, non-repressed facial expressions of emotion based on empirically documented findings, that is ≤0.50 s, and then more systematically ≤0.40, ≤0.30, and ≤0.20 s. We also compared expressions occurring between 0.50 and 6.00 s and all expressions ≤6.00 s. Microexpressions of negative emotions occurring ≤0.40 and ≤0.50 s differentiated truthtellers and liars. Expressions of negative emotions occurring ≤6.00 s also differentiated truthtellers from liars but this finding did not survive when expressions ≤1.00 s were filtered from the data. These findings provided the first systematic evidence for the existence of microexpressions at various durations and their possible ability to differentiate truthtellers from liars about their intent to commit an act of malfeasance in the future.",Letting Go of Self: The Creation of the Nonattachment to Self Scale.,https://www.ncbi.nlm.nih.gov/pubmed/30618965,Frontiers in psychology,2019 01 10,"The Buddhist notion of nonattachment relates to an engagement with experience with flexibility and without fixation on achieving specified outcomes. The present study sought to define, create and validate a new measure of nonattachment as it applies to notions of the self. A new construct of ""nonattachment to self"" (NTS) was developed, defined the absence of fixation on self-related concepts, thoughts and feelings, and a capacity to flexibly interact with these concepts, thoughts and feelings without trying to control them. Two studies were conducted in the development of the new scale. With expert consultation, study 1 (n = 445) established a single factor, internally consistent 7-item scale via exploratory factor analysis. Study 2 (n = 388, n = 338) confirmed the factor structure of the new 7-item scale using confirmatory factor analyses. Study 2 also found the new scale to be internally consistent, with evidence supporting its test-retest reliability, criterion, and construct validity.

These triggers may become supporting elements for our memory system when we are ""constructing the realities"" in a Brunerian sense when we are ordering, differentiating, comparing, and handling information, stories and experiences in our mind.

This study presents the Reading Flow Short Scale (RFSS), the first reading-specific flow measurement tool. The RFSS was applied to 229 readers via online survey after 20 min of reading in self-selected novels. In a systematic analysis of psychometric properties, the RFSS' factorial structure, reliability, and associations with theoretically related constructs were examined. As expected, the RFSS showed a two-factor structure, positive correlations with variables related to reading pleasure and flow, and an inverted U-shaped association with perceived fit between reader skills and text challenge. Comparisons of confirmatory factor analysis model confirmed that RFSS items loaded on different latent variables than items assessing other narrative engagement concepts, namely presence, identification, suspense, and cognitive mastery, and hence distinctly capture flow states in fiction reading. In sum, our findings indicate that the RFSS is a useful instrument for assessing flow states in fiction reading, thereby enriching the portfolio of measurement instruments in reading research.",Confirmatory Composite Analysis.,https://www.ncbi.nlm.nih.gov/pubmed/30618962,Frontiers in psychology,2019 01 10,"This article introduces confirmatory composite analysis (CCA) as a structural equation modeling technique that aims at testing composite models. It facilitates the operationalization and assessment of design concepts, so-called artifacts. CCA entails the same steps as confirmatory factor analysis: model specification, model identification, model estimation, and model assessment. Composite models are specified such that they consist of a set of interrelated composites, all of which emerge as linear combinations of observable variables. Researchers must ensure theoretical identification of their specified model. For the estimation of the model, several estimators are available; in particular Kettenring's extensions of canonical correlation analysis provide consistent estimates. Model assessment mainly relies on the Bollen-Stine bootstrap to assess the discrepancy between the empirical and the estimated model-implied indicator covariance matrix. A Monte Carlo simulation examines the efficacy of CCA, and demonstrates that CCA is able to detect various forms of model misspecification.",A Two-Dimensional Multiple-Choice Model Accounting for Omissions.,https://www.ncbi.nlm.nih.gov/pubmed/30618961,Frontiers in psychology,2019 01 10,"This paper presents a new two-dimensional Multiple-Choice Model accounting for Omissions (MCMO). Based on Thissen and Steinberg multiple-choice models, the MCMO defines omitted responses as the result of the respondent not knowing the correct answer and deciding to omit rather than to guess given a latent propensity to omit. Firstly, using a Monte Carlo simulation, the accuracy of the parameters estimated from data with different sample sizes (500, 1,000, and 2,000 subjects), test lengths (20, 40, and 80 items) and percentages of omissions (5, 10, and 15%) were investigated. Later, the appropriateness of the MCMO to the Trends in International Mathematics and Science Study (TIMSS) Advanced 2015 mathematics and physics multiple-choice items was analyzed and compared with the Holman and Glas' Between-item Multi-dimensional IRT model (B-MIRT) and with the three-parameter logistic (3PL) model with omissions treated as incorrect responses. The results of the simulation study showed a good recovery of scale and position parameters. Pseudo-guessing parameters (d) were less accurate, but this inaccuracy did not seem to have an important effect on the estimation of abilities. The precision of the propensity to omit strongly depended on the ability values (the higher the ability, the worse the estimate of the propensity to omit). In the empirical study, the empirical reliability for ability estimates was high in both physics and mathematics. As in the simulation study, the estimates of the propensity to omit were less reliable and their precision varied with ability. Regarding the absolute item fit, the MCMO fitted the data better than the other models. Also, the MCMO offered significant increments in convergent validity between scores from multiple-choice and constructed-response items, with an increase of around 0.02 to 0.04 in R2 in comparison with the two other methods. Finally, the high correlation between the country means of the propensity to omit in mathematics and physics suggests that (1) the propensity to omit is somehow affected by the country of residence of the examinees, and (2) the propensity to omit is independent of the test contents.",Assessment of Burden Among Family Caregivers of Schizophrenia: Psychometric Testing for Short-Form Zarit Burden Interviews.,https://www.ncbi.nlm.nih.gov/pubmed/30618960,Frontiers in psychology,2019 01 10,"Objective: Although various short forms of Zarit Burden Interview (ZBI) have been developed, there is a lack of standard psychometric testing and comparison among them. The study aims to examine the psychometric properties of ten short versions of the most frequently used ZBI among a sample of schizophrenia caregivers and to find the one with the best performance. Methods: Cross-sectional door-to-door survey of ZBI-22 and a series of validated instrument data from 327 family caregivers of schizophrenia patients in a Chinese rural community were conducted from October 2015 to January 2016. Reliability was assessed using McDonald's omega coefficient (ω). Validity including concurrent validity, known group's validity, and criterion validity were assessed by Spearman correlations and Mann-Whitney U tests. Overall discrimination ability was evaluated using the area under the receiver operating characteristic curve (AUC). Results: Reliability was generally good for all short forms (ω = 0.69-0.84), except for the Gort ZBI-4 (ω = 0.58), which is acceptable considering its small item numbers. Concurrent validity was good across all various ZBI forms with significant negative correlations with patient's function (r = -0.34 to -0.48, p < 0.01), as well as significant positive correlations with caregiver's depression (r = 0.49-0.65, p < 0.01), and anxiety symptoms (r = 0.45-0.58, p < 0.01). Known groups' validity (carers with disease vs. without disease; carers being parents vs. spouse vs. others) showed inconsistent results among various short forms. Criterion validity was generally good for all short forms with significant positive correlations with Family Burden Interview Schedule (r = 0.67-0.75, p < 0.01), except for the Higginson ZBI-1(r = 0.57, p < 0.01). Discriminative ability was also good for all short forms (AUC range: 0.85-0.99), with various cutpoints proposed. Among all ten short forms, the Ballesteros ZBI-12 and the Gort ZBI-7 outperformed others with almost equally good performance in comprehensive psychometric testing. Conclusions: This study provides support for the reliability, validity, and discriminative ability of the ten various short forms of ZBI for use among schizophrenia family caregivers, with the Ballesteros ZBI-12 and the Gort ZBI-7 endorsed as the best ones.",Norms for a Pictographic System: The Aragonese Portal of Augmentative/Alternative Communication (ARASAAC) System.,https://www.ncbi.nlm.nih.gov/pubmed/30618959,Frontiers in psychology,2019 01 10,"Different systems are used to facilitate communication for people with speech problems. Among these, pictographic systems offer an extraordinary solution for many people with severe communication disorders; for example, people with autism spectrum disorders, aphasia, cognitive impairment, cerebral palsy, etc. The pictographic system called Aragonese Portal of Augmentative and Alternative Communication (ARASAAC http://arasaac.org), freely distributed under the Creative Commons License (BY-NC-SA), is an important reference in many countries. Although these images are widely used, there are no previous studies on their reliability and validity. In order to obtain a useful tool in the clinical context, scores of name agreement, H index, tip-of-the-tongue responses, conceptual familiarity, image agreement, visual complexity, and response times were collected for the 295 most frequent images in the ARASAAC dataset. The psychometric analyses showed adequate validity and reliability values. The regression analysis indicated that naming times were explained by picture-name agreement, age of acquisition, and conceptual familiarity, while the tip-of-the-tongue states were mainly predicted by picture-name agreement and name agreement. In conclusion, these norms from the ARASAAC dataset offer a valuable tool for clinical intervention as well as for psycholinguistic research.",Audio-Visual Spatiotemporal Perceptual Training Enhances the P300 Component in Healthy Older Adults.,https://www.ncbi.nlm.nih.gov/pubmed/30618958,Frontiers in psychology,2019 01 10,"In older adults, cognitive abilities, such as those associated with vision and hearing, generally decrease with age. According to several studies, audio-visual perceptual training can improve perceived competence regarding visual and auditory stimuli, suggesting that perceptual training is effective and beneficial. However, whether audio-visual perceptual training can induce far-transfer effects in other forms of untrained cognitive processing that are not directly trained in older adults remains unclear. In this study, the classic P300 component, a neurophysiological indicator of cognitive processing of a stimulus, was selected as an evaluation index of the training effect. We trained both young and older adults on the ability to judge the temporal and spatial consistency of visual and auditory stimuli. P300 amplitudes were significantly greater in the posttraining session than in the pretraining session in older adults (P = 0.001). However, perceptual training had no significant effect (P = 0.949) on the P300 component in young adults. Our results illustrate that audio-visual perceptual training can lead to far-transfer effects in healthy older adults. These findings highlight the robust malleability of the aging brain, and further provide evidence to motivate exploration to improve cognitive abilities in older adults."

The Relationship Between Exploration Before Ball Possession and On-Ball Performance in Association Football.,https://www.ncbi.nlm.nih.gov/pubmed/30618946,Frontiers in psychology,2019 01 10,"Visual exploratory action - scanning movements expressed through left and right rotation of the head - allows perception of a surrounding environment and supports prospective actions. In the dynamically changing football environment, the extent to which exploratory action benefits a player's subsequent performance with the ball is likely influenced by how and when the exploratory action occurs. Although few studies have examined the relationship between visual exploration and on-pitch football performance, it has been reported that a higher frequency of exploratory head movement up to 10-s before receiving the ball increases the likelihood of successful performance with the ball. This study investigated the relationship between head turn frequency and head turn excursion, and how and when exploratory head movement - within 10-s before ball possession - is related to performance with the ball in 11v11 match-play. Thirty-two semi-elite football players competed in 11v11 match-play. Head turn frequency and head turn excursion before ball possession were quantified with wearable inertial measurement units, and actions with the ball were coded via notational analysis. Odds ratio calculations were conducted to determine the associations between exploration variables and on-ball performance outcomes. A total of 783 actions with the ball were analyzed. Results revealed a strong relationship between head turn frequency and head turn excursion. Further, a higher than average head turn frequency and head turn excursion before receiving the ball resulted in a higher likelihood of turning with the ball, playing a pass in the attacking direction, and playing a pass to an area that is opposite to which it was received from. The strength of these outcomes varied for different time periods before receiving the ball. When players explored their environment with higher than average head turn frequency and excursion, they used more complex action opportunities afforded by the surrounding environment. Considerations for future research and practical implications are discussed.",Age-Dependent Performance on Pro-point and Anti-point Tasks.,https://www.ncbi.nlm.nih.gov/pubmed/30618945,Frontiers in psychology,2019 01 10,"Changes in prefrontal cortex are thought to be responsible for many of the characteristic behavioral changes that are seen during adolescence and late adulthood. Disruption of prefrontal cortex is an early sign for many developmental, neurological, and psychiatric disorders. Goal directed eye movements, such as Anti-saccades, have been shown to have high sensitivity as a gross assessment of prefrontal lobe function. Previous studies on the developmental changes of saccades across age have shown that stimulus-driven and goal-directed eye movements follow a U-shaped trend with peaks in performance occuring during adolescence. Using novel tablet-based pointing tasks, modeled on eye movement tests, this study aims to provide a preliminary understanding of how age affects manual pointing performance, in order to more easily track behavioral changes of the prefrontal cortex. In this study, 82 participants between the ages of 10 and 63 were recruited to participate. Results show that similarly to saccades, manual pointing responses are age dependent with fastest response times found during late adolescence to early adulthood (U-shaped curves). Importantly, we also demonstrated significant differences in the effect of age in stimulus-driven (Pro-point) and goal-directed (Anti-point) pointing tasks. The effect of age on response time (RT) is greater on Anti-point compared to Pro-point task (with a 79 ms greater mean decrease during early development and a 148 ms greater mean increase during later aging). Further, for Pro-point task, the U-shaped curve flattens at about 45 years whereas for Anti-point task the U-shaped curve continues up to the maximum age tested (about 60 years). This dissociation between age-related changes in sensorimotor and cognitive performance suggests independent development of associated brain circuity. Thus, changes of performance in disease that are specific for age and task may be able to help identify brain circuitry involved. Finally, given that these tablet-based pointing tasks show similar age-related patterns reported previously with eye-tracking technology, our findings suggest that such tablet-based tasks may provide an inexpensive, quick, and more practical way of detecting neurological deficits or tracking cognitive changes.","""Turn Around and Forget"": Assessment of the Cognitive Inhibitory Effect of Working Memory Information Using the List-Before-Last Paradigm.",https://www.ncbi.nlm.nih.gov/pubmed/30618944,Frontiers in psychology,2019 01 10,"This study mainly discusses whether the cognitive inhibitory effect of working memory information is affected by the nature of the signified information and the number of retrieval cues in the inhibitory information. Experiment 1 of our study examined the effect of concreteness on the information retrieval phase under different cognitive inhibition scenarios that were distinguished by the nature of the signified information and the number of retrieval cues in the inhibitory information. Experiment 2 of our study examined the effect of the number of retrieval cues in the inhibitory information on the cognitive inhibitory effect under different cognitive inhibition scenarios. The results of both experiments showed that information displaying more concrete characteristics exerted a greater the cognitive inhibitory effect during the working memory task, and a greater cognitive inhibitory effect was produced when all of inhibition retrieval information clues are provided than when none of the clues are provided in the working memory task. Based on these results, the concreteness effect on cognitive inhibition exists, and when all retrieval clues for inhibitory information are provided, the cognitive inhibitory effect might be greater.","Confronting Co-workers: Role Models, Attitudes, Expectations, and Perceived Behavioral Control as Predictors of Employee Voice in the Military.",https://www.ncbi.nlm.nih.gov/pubmed/30618943,Frontiers in psychology,2019 01 10,"Speaking up and confronting co-workers when they behave undesirably is important for the well-being of the personnel and organizational performance. In some organizations, a culture of silence prevails, however. Although a number of organizational environments are particularly receptive to employee voice, others are less open to voice behavior, which gives rise to a risk of undesirable behavior. Direct communication (voice) can reduce this enhanced risk. In this study, we used the Theory of Planned Behavior to examine the extent to which attitude, social norm and perceived behavioral control determine voice in hierarchical contexts, which, in general, tend to inhibit voice behavior. For this purpose, a survey study was conducted among military and civilian personnel of the Netherlands Ministry of Defense (n = 374). Results showed that employee voice is rather high, regardless of rank, position or gender. Structural equation modeling showed that voice was significantly predicted by perceived behavioral control and injunctive norms (i.e., what is considered to be normal in a certain working-environment). Contrary to expectations, voice was not predicted by attitude and descriptive social norms (i.e., what people see that others are doing in this respect). Stimulating confronting skills and creating a climate in which speaking up is perceived as normal may be beneficial for organizations in general and hierarchical organizations in particular.",Normative Data for 84 UK English Rebus Puzzles.,https://www.ncbi.nlm.nih.gov/pubmed/30618942,Frontiers in psychology,2019 01 10,"Recent investigations have established the value of using rebus puzzles in studying the insight and analytic processes that underpin problem solving. The current study sought to validate a pool of 84 rebus puzzles in terms of their solution rates, solution times, error rates, solution confidence, self-reported solution strategies, and solution phrase familiarity. All of the puzzles relate to commonplace English sayings and phrases in the United Kingdom. Eighty-four rebus puzzles were selected from a larger stimulus set of 168 such puzzles and were categorized into six types in relation to the similarity of their structures. The 84 selected problems were thence divided into two sets of 42 items (Set A and Set B), with rebus structure evenly balanced between each set. Participants (N = 170; 85 for Set A and 85 for Set B) were given 30 s to solve each item, subsequently indicating their confidence in their solution and self-reporting the process used to solve the problem (analysis or insight), followed by the provision of ratings of the familiarity of the solution phrases.

Findings suggest that the much more parsimonious models that we proposed performed similarly to the current polytomous DCMs and offered useful item-level information in addition to option-level information. We then performed a small simulation study using the applied study condition and demonstrated that the proposed models can provide unbiased parameter estimates and correctly classify individuals. In practice, the proposed models can accommodate much smaller sample sizes than current polytomous DCMs and thus prove useful in many small-scale testing scenarios.",Evaluating the Effects of Metalinguistic and Working Memory Training on Reading Fluency in Chinese and English: A Randomized Controlled Trial.,https://www.ncbi.nlm.nih.gov/pubmed/30618940,Frontiers in psychology,2019 01 10,"Children traditionally learn to read Chinese characters by rote, and thus stretching children's memory span could possibly improve their reading in Chinese. Nevertheless, 85% of Chinese characters are semantic-phonetic compounds that contain probabilistic information about meaning and pronunciation. Hence, enhancing children's metalinguistic skills might also facilitate reading in Chinese. In the present study, we tested whether training children's metalinguistic skills or training their working-memory capacity in 8 weeks would produce reading gains, and whether these gains would be similar in Chinese and English. We recruited 35 second graders in Hong Kong and randomly assigned them to a metalinguistic training group (N = 13), a working-memory training group (10), or a waitlist control group (12). In the metalinguistic training, children were taught to analyze novel Chinese characters into phonetic and semantic radicals and novel English words into onsets and rimes. In the working-memory training, children were trained to recall increasingly long strings of Cantonese or English syllables in correct or reverse order. All children were tested on phonological skills, verbal working memory, and word reading fluency in Chinese and in English before and after training. Analyses of the pre- and post-test data revealed that only the metalinguistic training group, but not the other two groups, showed significant improvement on phonological skills in Chinese and English. Working-memory span in Chinese and English increased from the pre- to post-test in the working-memory training group relative to other two groups. Despite these domain-specific training effects, the two training groups improved similarly in word reading fluency in Chinese and English compared to the control group. Our findings suggest that increased metalinguistic skills and a larger working-memory span appear equally beneficial to reading fluency, and that these effects are similar in Chinese and English.",Neural Oscillations and the Initiation of Voluntary Movement.,https://www.ncbi.nlm.nih.gov/pubmed/30618939,Frontiers in psychology,2019 01 10,"The brain processes involved in the planning and initiation of voluntary action are of great interest for understanding the relationship between conscious awareness of decisions and the neural control of movement. Voluntary motor behavior has generally been considered to occur when conscious decisions trigger movements. However, several studies now provide compelling evidence that brain states indicative of forthcoming movements take place before a person becomes aware of a conscious decision to act. While such studies have created much debate over the nature of 'free will,' at the very least they suggest that unconscious brain processes are predictive of forthcoming movements. Recent studies suggest that slow changes in neuroelectric potentials may play a role in the timing of movement onset by pushing brain activity above a threshold to trigger the initiation of action. Indeed, recent studies have shown relationships between the phase of low frequency oscillatory activity of the brain and the onset of voluntary action. Such studies, however, cannot determine whether this underlying neural activity plays a causal role in the initiation of movement or is only associated with the intentional behavior. Non-invasive transcranial alternating current brain stimulation can entrain neural activity at particular frequencies in order to assess whether underlying brain processes are causally related to associated behaviors. In this review, we examine the evidence for neural coding of action as well as the brain states prior to action initiation and discuss whether low frequency alternating current brain stimulation could influence the timing of a persons' decision to act.",Virtual Reality Analgesia During Venipuncture in Pediatric Patients With Onco-Hematological Diseases.,https://www.ncbi.nlm.nih.gov/pubmed/30618938,Frontiers in psychology,2019 01 11,"Background: Venipuncture is described by children as one of the most painful and frightening medical procedures. Objective: To evaluate the effectiveness of Virtual Reality (VR) as a distraction technique to help control pain in children and adolescents undergoing venipuncture. Methods: Using a within-subjects design, fifteen patients (mean age 10.92, SD = 2.64) suffering from oncological or hematological diseases received one venipuncture with ""No VR"" and one venipuncture with ""Yes VR"" on two separate days (treatment order randomized). ""Time spent thinking about pain"", ""Pain Unpleasantness"", ""Worst pain"" the quality of VR experience, fun during the venipuncture and nausea were measured. Results: During VR, patients reported significant reductions in ""Time spent thinking about pain,"" ""Pain unpleasantness,"" and ""Worst pain"". Patients also reported significantly more fun during VR, and reported a ""Strong sense of going inside the computer-generated world"" during VR. No side effects were reported. Conclusion: VR can be considered an effective distraction technique for children and adolescents' pain management during venipuncture. Moreover, VR may elicit positive emotions, more than traditional distraction techniques. This could help patients cope with venipuncture in a non-stressful manner.

By means of a novel action-based version of the rubber hand illusion (RHI), in which participants could actively self-stroke the rubber hand, with (Version 1) or without visual feedback (Version 2) of their own actions, we showed that self-generated actions promote the emergence of a sense of ownership over the rubber hand in children, while it interferes with the embodiment of the rubber hand in adults. When the movement is missing (Version 3, i.e., mere view of the rubber hand being stroked concurrently with one's own hand), the pattern of results is reversed, with adults showing embodiment of the rubber hand, but children lacking to do so. Our novel findings reveal a dynamic and plastic contribution of the motor system to the emergence of a coherent bodily self, suggesting that the development of the sense of body ownership is shaped by motor experience, rather than being purely sensory."
