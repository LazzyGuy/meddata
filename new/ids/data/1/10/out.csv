Here, we describe two unique modes used by desert date palms (Phoenix dactylifera L.) to protect their meristematic tissues during early organogenesis. We used X-ray micro-computed tomography combined with high-resolution tissue imaging to reveal that, after germination, development of the embryo pauses while it remains inside a dividing and growing cotyledonary petiole. Transcriptomic and hormone analyses show that this developmental arrest is associated with the low expression of development-related genes and accumulation of hormones that promote dormancy and confer resistance to stress. Furthermore, organ-specific cell type mapping demonstrates that organogenesis occurs inside the cotyledonary petiole, with identifiable root and shoot meristems and their respective stem cells. The plant body emerges from the surrounding tissues with developed leaves and a complex root system that maximizes efficient nutrient and water uptake. We further show that, similar to its role in Arabidopsis thaliana, the SHORT-ROOT (SHR) homologue from date palms functions in maintaining stem cell activity and promoting formative divisions in the root ground tissue. Our findings provide insight into developmental programs that confer adaptive advantages in desert plants that thrive in hostile habitats.",The Community Access to Child Health (CATCH) Program: A 25-Year Retrospective.,https://www.ncbi.nlm.nih.gov/pubmed/31142579,Pediatrics,2019 06 04,"For 25 years, the American Academy of Pediatrics (AAP) Community Access to Child Health (CATCH) program has supported pediatricians in collaborating within their communities to advance the health of all children. CATCH grants support pediatric residents and pediatricians in planning or implementing community-based child health initiatives. The CATCH program has provided almost 10 million dollars through 842 planning, 585 resident, and 305 implementation grants to >1700 pediatricians. Urban, rural, suburban, and tribal communities in every state as well as the District of Columbia and Puerto Rico have benefited from CATCH-funded projects. Collaborations with community partners such as schools, homeless shelters, and mental health centers have led to programs serving children and families, especially those living in poverty and in minority groups. The most recent program data reveal that 87.5% of the projects are operating 2 years after funding. Many CATCH projects have not only sustained themselves but have grown into larger programs with funding from other sources. CATCH has influenced pediatricians' careers by providing important skills, networking opportunities, career legitimacy, mentoring opportunities, and increased engagement with the AAP. More than 350 pediatricians have served the AAP as CATCH facilitators, the network of physicians that provides technical assistance to applicants and reviews grant applications. Responding to changing trends, CATCH leaders have looked at other funding models and recently launched the CATCH-On initiative. CATCH-On creates and provides templates from successful CATCH projects to busy pediatricians who can then implement the project in their communities with minimal funding.",Severe Acute Respiratory Failure in Healthy Adolescents Exposed to Trimethoprim-Sulfamethoxazole.,https://www.ncbi.nlm.nih.gov/pubmed/31142578,Pediatrics,2019 06 04,"Pulmonary toxicity induced by trimethoprim-sulfamethoxazole (TMP-SMX) has been described, although the disease process is poorly understood. We report 5 previously healthy adolescent patients who developed acute respiratory failure while taking TMP-SMX. Four of the 5 adolescents required extracorporeal membrane oxygenation support, and 2 of the teenagers died. All children required a tracheostomy, and all cases were complicated by pneumothoraces and pneumomediastinum. The majority of children were prescribed TMP-SMX for the treatment of acne vulgaris.",Beyond Messiaen's birds: the post-verbal world of dementia.,https://www.ncbi.nlm.nih.gov/pubmed/31142577,Medical humanities,2019 05 30,"This paper investigates the use of verbatim musical transcription as a research method in dementia care. It reports on an art-based ethnographic study (Aesthetic Research in Everyday Life (Aeriel)) in which verbatim transcription was applied to everyday interactions in dementia care, making use of musical-instead of verbal-notation. Starting from the notion that medical and healthcare settings can be sites of 'found performance', the paper reviews literature relating to artistic methodologies within medical humanities, music, ethnography and dementia care. From this review, it proposes a research design and method of verbatim musical transcription as a potential avenue of investigating communication between carer and cared for in dementia care. The paper offers an illustrative example from Aeriel and draws conclusions from the synthesis of verbal and musical data analysis. Findings indicate an important advance in studies of dementia care communication towards a concept of the 'post-verbal' enabled by a musical research method and the clinical applications that it offers.",Graph algorithms for condensing and consolidating gene set analysis results.,https://www.ncbi.nlm.nih.gov/pubmed/31142576,Molecular & cellular proteomics : MCP,2019 06 15,"Gene set analysis plays a critical role in the functional interpretation of omics data. Although this is typically done for one omics experiment at a time, there is an increasing need to combine gene set analysis results from multiple experiments performed on the same or different omics platforms, such as in multi-omics studies. Integrating results from multiple experiments is challenging, and annotation redundancy between gene sets further obscures clear conclusions. We propose to use a weighted set cover algorithm to reduce redundancy of gene sets identified in a single experiment. Next, we use affinity propagation to consolidate similar gene sets identified from multiple experiments into clusters and to automatically determine the most representative gene set for each cluster. Using three examples from over representation analysis and gene set enrichment analysis, we showed that weighted set cover outperformed a previously published set cover method and reduced the number of gene sets by 52-77%. Focusing on overlapping genes between the list of input genes and the enriched gene sets in over-representation analysis and leading-edge genes in gene set enrichment analysis further reduced the number of gene sets. A use case combining enrichment analysis results from RNA-Seq and proteomics data comparing basal and luminal A breast cancer samples highlighted the known difference in proliferation and DNA damage response. Finally, we used these algorithms for a pan-cancer survival analysis. Our analysis clearly revealed prognosis-related pathways common to multiple cancer types or specific to individual cancer types, as well as pathways associated with prognosis in different directions in different cancer types. We implemented these two algorithms in an R package, Sumer, which generates tables and static and interactive plots for exploration and publication. Sumer is publicly available at https://github.com/bzhanglab/sumer.",A meta-proteogenomic approach to peptide identification incorporating assembly uncertainty and genomic variation.,https://www.ncbi.nlm.nih.gov/pubmed/31142575,Molecular & cellular proteomics : MCP,2019 05 30,"Matching metagenomic and/or metatranscriptomic data, currently often under-utilized, can be useful reference for metaproteomic tandem mass spectra (MS/MS) data analysis. Here we developed a software pipeline for identification of peptides and proteins from metaproteomic MS/MS data using proteins derived from matching metagenomic (and metatranscriptomic) data as the search database, based on two novel approaches Graph2Pro (published) and Var2Pep (new). Graph2Pro retains and utilizes uncertainties of metagenome assembly for reference-based MS/MS data analysis. Var2Pep considers the variations found in metagenomic/metatranscriptomic sequencing reads that are not retained in the assemblies (contigs). The new software pipeline provides one stop application of both tools, and it supports the use of metagenome assembly from commonly used assemblers including MegaHit and metaSPAdes. When tested on two collections of multi-omic microbiome datasets, our pipeline significantly improved the identification rate of the metaproteomic MS/MS spectra by about two folds, comparing to conventional contig- or read-based approaches (the Var2Pep alone identified 5.6% to 24.1% more unique peptides, depending on the dataset). We also showed that identified variant peptides are important for functional profiling of microbiomes. All results suggested that it is important to take into consideration of the assembly uncertainties and genomic variants to facilitate metaproteomic MS/MS data interpretation.","Cholesterol Efflux Capacity, HDL Cholesterol, and Risk of Coronary Heart Disease: a Nested Case-Control Study in Men.",https://www.ncbi.nlm.nih.gov/pubmed/31142574,Journal of lipid research,2019 05 30,"The capacity of high-density lipoproteins (HDL) to accept cholesterol effluxing from macrophages has been proposed as a new biomarker of HDL's anti-atherogenic function. Whether cholesterol efflux capacity (CEC) is independent of HDL cholesterol (HDL-C) as a biomarker for coronary heart disease (CHD) risk in a generally healthy, primary-prevention population remains unanswered. Therefore, in this nested case-control study, we simultaneously assessed CEC (using J774 cells) and plasma HDL-C levels as predictors of CHD in healthy middle age and older men not receiving treatment affecting blood lipid concentrations. We used risk-set sampling of participants free of disease at baseline from the Health Professionals Follow-Up Study, and matched cases (n=701) to controls 1:1 for age, smoking, and blood sampling date. We applied conditional logistic regression models to calculate the multivariable relative risk and 95% confidence intervals (CI) of CHD over 16 years of follow-up. CEC and HDL-C were correlated (r=0.50, p<0.0001). The risk (95% CI) of CHD per 1 standard deviation (SD) higher CEC was 0.82 (0.71-0.96), but completely attenuated to 1.08 (0.85-1.37) with HDL-C in the model. The association per 1 SD between HDL-C and CHD (0.66; 0.58-0.76) was essentially unchanged (0.68; 0.53-0.88) after adjustment for CEC. These findings indicate that CEC's ability to predict CHD may not be independent of HDL-C in a cohort of generally healthy men.",Von Hippel-Lindau Acts as a Metabolic Switch Controlling Nephron Progenitor Differentiation.,https://www.ncbi.nlm.nih.gov/pubmed/31142573,Journal of the American Society of Nephrology : JASN,2019 06 10,"Nephron progenitors, the cell population that give rise to the functional unit of the kidney, are metabolically active and self-renew under glycolytic conditions. A switch from glycolysis to mitochondrial respiration drives these cells toward differentiation, but the mechanisms that control this switch are poorly defined. Studies have demonstrated that kidney formation is highly dependent on oxygen concentration, which is largely regulated by von Hippel-Lindau (VHL; a protein component of a ubiquitin ligase complex) and hypoxia-inducible factors (a family of transcription factors activated by hypoxia).",Changes of synaptic proteins involved in synaptic plasticity after chronic intraocular pressure elevation and modulation by brain-derived neurotrophic factor in glaucoma animal model.,https://www.ncbi.nlm.nih.gov/pubmed/31142572,Disease models & mechanisms,2019 05 30,"The dendrites of retinal ganglion cells (RGCs) synapse with the axon terminals of bipolar cells in the inner plexiform layer (IPL). Changes in the RGC dendrites and synapses between the bipolar cells in the inner retinal layer may critically alter the function of RGCs in glaucoma. The present study attempted to find out changes in the synapse using brain-derived neurotrophic factor (BDNF) after glaucoma induction by chronic intraocular pressure elevation. Immunohistochemical staining revealed that the BDNF-injected group had a significant increase in the level of synaptophysin, which is a presynaptic vesicle protein, in the innermost IPL compared with the phosphate buffer solution (PBS)-injected group. SMI-32, which is a marker of RGCs, was co-localized with synaptophysin in RGC dendrites, and these levels significantly increased in the BDNF-injected group. After the induction of glaucoma, the BDNF-injected group exhibited increases in the total number of ribbon synapses using electron microscopy. Expression of calcium/calmodulin-dependent protein kinase II, cAMP-response element binding protein, and F-actin, which are key molecules involved in synaptic changes were up-regulated after BDNF injection. These initial findings show the capability of BDNF to induce beneficial synaptic changes in glaucoma.",RAB6 and microtubules restrict protein secretion to focal adhesions.,https://www.ncbi.nlm.nih.gov/pubmed/31142554,The Journal of cell biology,2019 05 30,"To ensure their homeostasis and sustain differentiated functions, cells continuously transport diverse cargos to various cell compartments and in particular to the cell surface. Secreted proteins are transported along intracellular routes from the endoplasmic reticulum through the Golgi complex before reaching the plasma membrane along microtubule tracks. Using a synchronized secretion assay, we report here that exocytosis does not occur randomly at the cell surface but on localized hotspots juxtaposed to focal adhesions. Although microtubules are involved, the RAB6-dependent machinery plays an essential role. We observed that, irrespective of the transported cargos, most post-Golgi carriers are positive for RAB6 and that its inactivation leads to a broad reduction of protein secretion. RAB6 may thus be a general regulator of post-Golgi secretion."

Cardiac cells from different regions of the growing embryonic heart exhibit distinct patterns of gene expression, which are thought to contribute to heart development and morphogenesis. Single cell RNA sequencing allows genome-wide analysis of gene expression at the single cell level. Here, we have analyzed cardiac cells derived from early stage developing hearts by single cell RNA-seq and identified cell cycle gene expression as a major determinant of transcriptional variation. Within cell cycle stage-matched CMs from a given heart chamber, we found that CMs in the G2/M phase downregulated sarcomeric and cytoskeletal markers. We also identified cell location-specific signaling molecules that may influence the proliferation of other nearby cell types. Our data highlight how variations in cell cycle activity selectively promote cardiac chamber growth during development, reveal profound chamber-specific cell cycle-linked transcriptional shifts, and open the way to deeper understanding of pathogenesis of congenital heart disease.",Lgr5+ stem and progenitor cells reside at the apex of a heterogeneous embryonic hepatoblast pool.,https://www.ncbi.nlm.nih.gov/pubmed/31142540,"Development (Cambridge, England)",2019 06 13,"During mouse embryogenesis, progenitors within the liver known as hepatoblasts give rise to adult hepatocytes and cholangiocytes. Hepatoblasts, which are specified at E8.5-E9.0, have been regarded as a homogeneous progenitor population that initiate differentiation from E13.5. Recently, scRNA-seq analysis has identified sub-populations of transcriptionally distinct hepatoblasts at E11.5. Here, we show that hepatoblasts are not only transcriptionally but also functionally heterogeneous, and that a subpopulation of E9.5-E10.0 hepatoblasts exhibit a previously unidentified early commitment to cholangiocyte fate. Importantly, we also identify a subpopulation constituting 2% of E9.5-E10.0 hepatoblasts that express the adult stem cell marker Lgr5, and generate both hepatocyte and cholangiocyte progeny that persist for the lifespan of the mouse. Combining lineage tracing and scRNA-seq, we show that Lgr5 marks E9.5-E10.0 bipotent liver progenitors residing at the apex of a hepatoblast hierarchy. Furthermore, isolated Lgr5+ hepatoblasts can be clonally expanded in vitro into embryonic liver organoids, which can commit to either hepatocyte or cholangiocyte fates. Our study demonstrates functional heterogeneity within E9.5 hepatoblasts and identifies Lgr5 as a marker for a subpopulation of bipotent liver progenitors.",Whole organism small molecule screen identifies novel regulators of pancreatic endocrine development.,https://www.ncbi.nlm.nih.gov/pubmed/31142539,"Development (Cambridge, England)",2019 05 30,"An early step in pancreas development is marked by the expression of the Pdx1 transcription factor within the pancreatic endoderm where it is required for the specification of all endocrine cell types. Subsequently, Pdx1 expression becomes restricted to the β-cell lineage where it plays a central role in β-cell function. This pivotal role of Pdx1 at various stages of pancreas development makes it an attractive target to enhance pancreatic β-cell differentiation and increase β-cell function. In this study, we used a newly generated zebrafish reporter to screen over 8,000 small molecules for modulators of pdx1 expression. We found four hit compounds and validated their efficacy at different stages of pancreas development. Valproic acid (VPA), a HDAC inhibitor, induces pancreatic endoderm formation, while inhibition of TGF-β signaling leads to the transdifferentiation of α-cells to β-cells. HC Toxin, another HDAC inhibitor, enhances β-cell function in primary mouse and human islets. Thus, using a whole-organism screening strategy, this study identified new pdx1 expression modulators which can be used to influence different steps in pancreas and β-cell development.",Violence against older women: a protocol for a systematic review of qualitative literature.,https://www.ncbi.nlm.nih.gov/pubmed/31142538,BMJ open,2019 05 30,"There is sparse evidence globally concerning patterns of and types of violence against women aged 50 and older.

Health literacy interventions typically take the 'universal precautions approach' where all consumers are presented with simplified materials. Although this approach can improve knowledge and comprehension, its impact on complex behaviours is less clear. Systematic reviews also suggest that health literacy interventions underuse volitional strategies (such as planning) that play an important role in behaviour change. A recent study found volitional strategies may need to be tailored to the participant's health literacy. The current study aims to replicate these findings in a sample of people who have diabetes and/or are overweight or obese as measured by body mass index, and to investigate the most effective method of allocating an action plan to a participant to reduce unhealthy snacking.",Factors associated with the responsive behaviours of older adults living in long-term care homes towards staff: a systematic review protocol.,https://www.ncbi.nlm.nih.gov/pubmed/31142535,BMJ open,2019 05 30,"In the last decade, increasing research interest has been expressed in responsive behaviours of older adults living in long-term care (LTC) homes, including nursing homes and assisted living facilities.

The structural, molecular, and biological basis by which the most recurrent EMCA-specific mutation site P179 facilitates features of EMCA malignancy have yet to be fully determined. Here we used a series of structural, biochemical, and biological approaches to investigate the impact of the P179R missense mutation on PP2A function. Enhanced sampling molecular dynamics simulations showed that arginine-to-proline substitution at the P179 residue changes the protein's stable conformation profile. A crystal structure of the tumor-derived PP2A mutant revealed marked changes in A-subunit conformation. Binding to the PP2A catalytic subunit was significantly impaired, disrupting holoenzyme formation and enzymatic activity. Cancer cells were dependent on PP2A disruption for sustained tumorigenic potential, and restoration of wildtype Aα in a patient-derived P179R mutant cell line restored enzyme function and significantly attenuated tumorigenesis and metastasis in vivo. Furthermore, small molecule-mediated therapeutic reactivation of PP2A significantly inhibited tumorigenicity in vivo. These outcomes implicate PP2A functional inactivation as a critical component of high-grade EMCA disease pathogenesis. Moreover, they highlight PP2A reactivation as a potential therapeutic strategy for patients who harbor P179R PPP2R1A mutations.",mTORC2 suppresses GSK3-dependent Snail degradation to positively regulate cancer cell invasion and metastasis.,https://www.ncbi.nlm.nih.gov/pubmed/31142514,Cancer research,2019 05 30,"Mammalian target of rapamycin (mTOR) complex 1 (mTORC1) positively regulates cell invasion and metastasis by enhancing translation of Snail. A connection between mTOR complex 2 (mTORC2) and cell invasion and metastasis has also been suggested, yet the underlying biology or mechanism is largely unknown and thus is the focus of this study. Inhibition of mTOR with both mTOR inhibitors and knockdown of key components of mTORC, including rictor, Sin1 and raptor, decreased Snail protein levels. Inhibition of mTOR enhanced the rate of Snail degradation, which could be rescued by inhibition of the proteasome. Critically, inhibition of mTORC2 (by knocking down rictor) but not mTORC1 (by knocking down raptor) enhanced Snail degradation. Therefore, only mTORC2 inhibition induces Snail proteasomal degradation, resulting in eventual Snail reduction. Interestingly, inhibition of GSK3 but not SCF/β-TrCP rescued the Snail reduction induced by mTOR inhibitors, suggesting GSK3-dependent, but SCF/β-TrCP-independent proteasomal degradation of Snail. Accordingly, mTOR inhibitors elevated E-cadherin levels and suppressed cancer cell migration and invasion in vitro and metastasis in vivo. Collectively, this study reveals that mTORC2 positively regulates Snail stability to control cell invasion and metastasis.",The immune contexture associates with the genomic landscape in lung adenomatous premalignancy.,https://www.ncbi.nlm.nih.gov/pubmed/31142513,Cancer research,2019 06 10,"Epithelial cells in the field of lung injury can give rise to distinct premalignant lesions that may bear unique genetic aberrations.

To identify somatic mutations and the extent of immune cell infiltration in adenomatous premalignancy and associated lung adenocarcinomas, we sequenced exomes from 41 lung cancer resection specimens including 89 premalignant atypical adenomatous hyperplasia lesions, 15 adenocarcinomas in situ, and 55 invasive adenocarcinomas and their adjacent normal lung tissues. We defined non-synonymous somatic mutations occurring in both premalignancy and the associated tumor as progression-associated mutations whose predicted neoantigens were highly correlated with infiltration of CD8+ and CD4+ T cells as well as upregulation of PD-L1 in premalignant lesions, suggesting the presence of an adaptive immune response to these neoantigens. Each patient had a unique repertoire of somatic mutations and associated neoantigens. Collectively, these results provide evidence for mutational heterogeneity, pathway dysregulation, and immune recognition in pulmonary premalignancy.",Integrative pharmacogenomics analysis of patient-derived xenografts.,https://www.ncbi.nlm.nih.gov/pubmed/31142512,Cancer research,2019 05 30,"Identifying robust biomarkers of drug response constitutes a key challenge in precision medicine. Patient-derived tumor xenografts (PDX) have emerged as reliable preclinical models that more accurately recapitulate tumor response to chemo- and targeted therapies. However, the lack of computational tools makes it difficult to analyze high-throughput molecular and pharmacological profiles of PDX. We have developed Xeva (XEnograft Visualization & Analysis), an open-source software package for in vivo pharmacogenomic datasets that allows for quantification of variability in gene expression and pathway activity across PDX passages. We found that only a few genes and pathways exhibited passage-specific alterations and were therefore not suitable for biomarker discovery. Using the largest PDX pharmacogenomic dataset to date, we identified 87 pathways that are significantly associated with response to 51 drugs (FDR<0.05). We found novel biomarkers based on gene expressions, copy number aberrations and mutations predictive of drug response (concordance index>0.60; FDR<0.05). Our study demonstrates that Xeva provides a flexible platform for integrative analysis of preclinical in vivo pharmacogenomics data to identify biomarkers predictive of drug response, representing a major step forward in precision oncology."

Cystic fibrosis (CF) is a classical example of this phenomenon, wherein a dysfunctional, hyperinflammatory immune response combined with chronic pulmonary infections wreak havoc upon the airway, leading to a disease course of substantial morbidity and shortened life span. Pseudomonas aeruginosa is an opportunistic pathogen that commonly infects the CF lung, promoting an accelerated decline of pulmonary function. Importantly, P. aeruginosa exhibits significant resistance to innate immune effectors and to antibiotics, in part, by expressing specific virulence factors (e.g., antioxidants and exopolysaccharides) and by acquiring adaptive mutations during chronic infection. In an effort to review our current understanding of the host-pathogen interface driving CF pulmonary disease, we discuss (i) the progression of disease within the primitive CF lung, specifically focusing on the role of host versus bacterial factors; (ii) critical, neutrophil-derived innate immune effectors that are implicated in CF pulmonary disease, including reactive oxygen species (ROS) and antimicrobial peptides (e.g., LL-37); (iii) P. aeruginosa virulence factors and adaptive mutations that enable evasion of the host response; and (iv) ongoing work examining the distribution and colocalization of host and bacterial factors within distinct anatomical niches of the CF lung.",Host-Pathogen Interactions in Gram-Positive Bacterial Pneumonia.,https://www.ncbi.nlm.nih.gov/pubmed/31142498,Clinical microbiology reviews,2019 05 30,"SUMMARYCommunity-acquired pneumonia (CAP) is a leading cause of morbidity and mortality worldwide. Despite broad literature including basic and translational scientific studies, many gaps in our understanding of host-pathogen interactions remain. In this review, pathogen virulence factors that drive lung infection and injury are discussed in relation to their associated host immune pathways. CAP epidemiology is considered, with a focus on Staphylococcus aureus and Streptococcus pneumoniae as primary pathogens. Bacterial factors involved in nasal colonization and subsequent virulence are illuminated. A particular emphasis is placed on bacterial pore-forming toxins, host cell death, and inflammasome activation. Identified host-pathogen interactions are then examined by linking pathogen factors to aberrant host response pathways in the context of acute lung injury in both primary and secondary infection. While much is known regarding bacterial virulence and host immune responses, CAP management is still limited to mostly supportive care. It is likely that improvements in therapy will be derived from combinatorial targeting of both pathogen virulence factors and host immunomodulation.",A Laboratory Medicine Best Practices Systematic Review and Meta-analysis of Nucleic Acid Amplification Tests (NAATs) and Algorithms Including NAATs for the Diagnosis of Clostridioides (Clostridium) difficile in Adults.,https://www.ncbi.nlm.nih.gov/pubmed/31142497,Clinical microbiology reviews,2019 05 30,"SUMMARYThe evidence base for the optimal laboratory diagnosis of Clostridioides (Clostridium) difficile in adults is currently unresolved due to the uncertain performance characteristics and various combinations of tests. This systematic review evaluates the diagnostic accuracy of laboratory testing algorithms that include nucleic acid amplification tests (NAATs) to detect the presence of C. difficile The systematic review and meta-analysis included eligible studies (those that had PICO [population, intervention, comparison, outcome] elements) that assessed the diagnostic accuracy of NAAT alone or following glutamate dehydrogenase (GDH) enzyme immunoassays (EIAs) or GDH EIAs plus C. difficile toxin EIAs (toxin). The diagnostic yield of NAAT for repeat testing after an initial negative result was also assessed. Two hundred thirty-eight studies met inclusion criteria. Seventy-two of these studies had sufficient data for meta-analysis. The strength of evidence ranged from high to insufficient. The uses of NAAT only, GDH-positive EIA followed by NAAT, and GDH-positive/toxin-negative EIA followed by NAAT are all recommended as American Society for Microbiology (ASM) best practices for the detection of the C. difficile toxin gene or organism. Meta-analysis of published evidence supports the use of testing algorithms that use NAAT alone or in combination with GDH or GDH plus toxin EIA to detect the presence of C. difficile in adults. There is insufficient evidence to recommend against repeat testing of the sample using NAAT after an initial negative result due to a lack of evidence of harm (i.e., financial, length of stay, or delay of treatment) as specified by the Laboratory Medicine Best Practices (LMBP) systematic review method in making such an assessment. Findings from this systematic review provide clarity to diagnostic testing strategies and highlight gaps, such as low numbers of GDH/toxin/PCR studies, in existing evidence on diagnostic performance, which can be used to guide future clinical research studies.","Trends of Nontraumatic Lower Extremity Amputation in End-Stage Renal Disease and Diabetes, United States, 2000-2015.",https://www.ncbi.nlm.nih.gov/pubmed/31142496,Diabetes care,2019 05 30,"Nontraumatic lower extremity amputation (NLEA) is a complication of end-stage renal disease (ESRD) and diabetes.

In addition to timely identification of the precipitating cause, the first step in acute management of these disorders includes aggressive administration of intravenous fluids with appropriate replacement of electrolytes (primarily potassium). In patients with diabetic ketoacidosis, this is always followed by administration of insulin, usually via an intravenous insulin infusion that is continued until resolution of ketonemia, but potentially via the subcutaneous route in mild cases. Careful monitoring by experienced physicians is needed during treatment for diabetic ketoacidosis and HHS. Common pitfalls in management include premature termination of intravenous insulin therapy and insufficient timing or dosing of subcutaneous insulin before discontinuation of intravenous insulin.

ASM hydrolyzes sphingomyelins to produce ceramides but protein targets of ASM remain largely unclear. Our mass-spectrometry-based proteomic analyses have identified >100 proteins associated with the ASM-dependent, detergent-resistant membrane microdomains (lipid rafts), with >60% of these proteins being palmitoylated, including SNAP23, Src-family kinases Yes and Lyn, and Ras and Rab family small GTPases. Inactivation of ASM abolished the presence of these proteins in the plasma membrane, with many of them trapped in the Golgi. While palmitoylation inhibitors and palmitoylation mutants phenocopied the effects of ASM inactivation, we demonstrated that ASM is required for the transport of palmitoylated proteins, such as SNAP23 and Lyn, from the Golgi to the plasma membrane without affecting palmitoylation directly. Importantly, ASM delivered extracellularly can regulate the trafficking of SNAP23 from the Golgi to the plasma membrane. Our studies suggest that ASM, acting at the plasma membrane to produce ceramides, regulates the localization and trafficking of the palmitoylated proteins.","Eyes and negative phototaxis in juvenile crown-of-thorns starfish, Acanthaster species complex.",https://www.ncbi.nlm.nih.gov/pubmed/31142469,Biology open,2019 06 11,"As a corallivore, the crown-of-thorns starfish (COTS; Acanthaster species complex), has significant impacts on coral mortality and community structure on tropical reefs throughout its Indo-Pacific range. COTS form aggregations which systematically move through and across reefs causing significant loss in hard coral cover. Previous work has shown that their behaviours on the reef are influenced by rheotaxis, olfaction and vision, with vision guiding adult animals to their coral habitat at short distances. As the compound eye of starfish grows throughout life the visual capacity of juvenile eyes is putatively less than for adult animals. Here we show this to be the case. Juvenile eyes have approximately the same visual field as adult eyes but significantly lower spatial resolution. They display negative phototaxis, as observed in adults, but we found no direct proof for the use of spatial resolution in this behaviour. Our results show that juveniles are able to use their eyes to locate their habitat: the coral reef. However, their putatively lower spatial resolution would make this visual task more difficult than for the adults.This article has an associated First Person interview with the first author of the paper.",Zebra finch (Taeniopygia guttata) shift toward aerodynamically efficient flight kinematics in response to an artificial load.,https://www.ncbi.nlm.nih.gov/pubmed/31142468,Biology open,2019 06 07,"We investigated the effect of an added mass emulating a transmitter on the flight kinematics of zebra finches (Taeniopygia guttata), both to identify proximal effects of loading and to test fundamental questions regarding the intermittent flight of this species. Zebra finch, along with many species of relatively small birds, exhibit flap-bounding, wherein the bird alternates periods of flapping with flexed-wing bounds. Mathematical modeling suggests that flap-bounding is less aerodynamically efficient than continuous flapping, except in limited circumstances. This has prompted the introduction of two major hypotheses for flap-bounding - the 'fixed-gear' and 'cost of muscle activation/deactivation' hypotheses - based on intrinsic properties of muscle. We equipped zebra finches flying at 10 m s-1 with a transmitter-like load to determine if their response was consistent with the predictions of these hypotheses. Loading caused finches to diverge significantly from their unloaded wingbeat kinematics. Researchers should carefully consider whether these effects impact traits of interest when planning telemetry studies to ensure that tagged individuals can reasonably be considered representative of the overall population. In response to loading, average wingbeat amplitude and angular velocity decreased, inconsistent with the predictions of the fixed-gear hypothesis. If we assume that finches maintained muscular efficiency, the reduction in amplitude is inconsistent with the cost of the muscle activation/deactivation hypothesis. However, we interpret the reduction in wingbeat amplitude and increase in the proportion of time spent flapping as evidence that loaded finches opted to increase their aerodynamic efficiency - a response which is consistent with the latter hypothesis."

Here we examined whether neutrophils from patients with GPA have dysregulated protein expressions associated with apoptosis. A global proteomic analysis was performed comparing neutrophils from patients with GPA, with healthy individuals under basal conditions and during apoptosis. At disease onset, the cytosolic proteome of neutrophils of patients with GPA before treatment was significantly different from healthy controls, and this dysregulation was more pronounced following ex vivo apoptosis. Proteins involved in cell death/survival were altered in neutrophils of patients with GPA. Several proteins identified were PR3-binding partners involved in the clearance of apoptotic cells, namely calreticulin, annexin-A1 and phospholipid scramblase 1. These proteins form a platform at the membrane of apoptotic neutrophils in patients with GPA but not healthy individuals and this was associated with the clinical presentation of GPA. Thus, our study shows that neutrophils from patients with GPA have an intrinsic dysregulation in proteins involved in apoptotic cell clearance, which could contribute to the unabated inflammation and autoimmunity in GPA. Hence, harnessing these dysregulated pathways could lead to novel biomarkers and targeted therapeutic opportunities to treat kidney disease.",Analysis from the EMPA-REG OUTCOME® trial indicates empagliflozin may assist in preventing the progression of chronic kidney disease in patients with type 2 diabetes irrespective of medications that alter intrarenal hemodynamics.,https://www.ncbi.nlm.nih.gov/pubmed/31142441,Kidney international,2019 05 30,"In patients with type 2 diabetes mellitus (T2DM) and cardiovascular (CV) disease, empagliflozin (EMPA) decreased progression of chronic kidney disease (CKD), likely via a reduction in intraglomerular pressure. Due to prevalent comorbidities, such as hypertension and albuminuria, patients often receive other agents that alter intrarenal hemodynamics, including angiotensin converting enzyme inhibitors/angiotensin receptor blockers (ACEi/ARBs), calcium channel blockers (CCBs) and diuretics. Nonsteroidal anti-inflammatory drugs (NSAIDs) may also be used by some individuals. In this exploratory, non-prespecified analysis, we investigated whether the kidney benefits of EMPA are altered in individuals already using the medications in these categories. In the BI 10773 (Empagliflozin) Cardiovascular Outcome Event Trial in Type 2 Diabetes Mellitus Patients (EMPA-REG OUTCOME®) trial, 7020 patients were essentially equally randomized to EMPA 10 mg, 25 mg or placebo added to their standard care. Differences in risk of incident or worsening nephropathy for pooled EMPA vs placebo across subgroups by baseline background medications (to which patients were not randomized) were assessed using a Cox proportional hazards model. Risk reductions in incident or worsening nephropathy with EMPA were consistent across medication subgroups, with no heterogeneity of treatment effect. As a representative example, the risk for acute renal failure was overall slightly increased in patients using ACEi/ARBs in all groups (placebo, EMPA 10 mg or EMPA 25 mg) but incidence rates were numerically lower in those assigned to EMPA. Similar patterns were observed for other medications included in this analysis. Thus, EMPA may assist to prevent CKD progression in patients with T2DM with CV disease, irrespective of common background medications that alter intrarenal hemodynamics, and without increasing acute renal adverse events.","Clinical and patient-reported outcomes following Low Intensity Pulsed Ultrasound (LIPUS, Exogen) for established post-traumatic and post-surgical nonunion in the foot and ankle.",https://www.ncbi.nlm.nih.gov/pubmed/31142440,Foot and ankle surgery : official journal of the European Society of Foot and Ankle Surgeons,2019 05 30,Biophysical methods including Low Intensity Pulsed Ultrasound (LIPUS) are emerging as potential alternatives to revision surgery for treating established nonunions.

The studied evidence suggests that food resources were commonly abundant, but some water scarcity and increase in summer rains occurred during MIS 5e, when soils and C3 vegetation were eliminated, causing soil erosion. This was followed by penetration of summer rainfall and lightning storms from the south, and associated C4 vegetation and fires. Faunal resources remained abundant, and humans using the southern Levant corridor enjoyed also a favorable passage through the greening Sahara Desert during MIS 5e, which was crucial for human and faunal dispersion. Qafzeh and Rantis caves' environmental records indicate xeric grassland-type ecosystem with Afro-Arabian elements that can be attributed to MIS 5e. As the environmental conditions of MIS 5e were unique, faunal and isotopic records within this region can be used in the future as chronologic markers for MIS 5e. During the last glacial period, conditions became gradually cooler and wetter, and C3 vegetation dominated the Mediterranean zone. Lower temperatures promoted the entry of Palearctic mammals. Fluctuations of speleothem δ13C increased during the latest Pleistocene - early Holocene, indicating environmental instability through the deglaciation. Significantly, the δ13C records indicate that vegetation did not change from the last glacial period to the Holocene in spite of the observed fluctuations.

Data set included test-day productive records of cows which were provided by the Animal Breeding Center and Promotion of Animal Products of Iran during 1983 to 2014. In the DHGLM method, a random regression model was fitted which included two parts of mean and residual variance. A random regression model (mean model) and a residual variance model were used to study the genetic variation of micro-environmental sensitivities. In order to consider macro-environmental sensitivities, DHGLM was extended using a reaction norm model, and a sire model was applied. Based on the mean model, additive genetic variances for the mean were 38.25 for milk yield, 0.23 for fat yield and 0.03 for protein yield in the first lactation, respectively. Based on the residual variance model, additive genetic variances for residual variance were 0.039 for milk yield, 0.030 for fat yield and 0.020 for protein yield in the first lactation, respectively. Estimates of genetic correlation between milk yield and macro- and micro-environmental sensitivities were 0.660 and 0.597 in the first lactation, respectively. The results of this study indicated that macro- and micro-environmental sensitivities were present for milk production traits of Iranian Holsteins. High genetic coefficient of variation for micro-environmental sensitivities indicated the possibility of reducing environmental variation and increase in uniformity via selection.",Berberine inhibits lipopolysaccharide-induced expression of inflammatory cytokines by suppressing TLR4-mediated NF-ĸB and MAPK signaling pathways in rumen epithelial cells of Holstein calves.,https://www.ncbi.nlm.nih.gov/pubmed/31142385,The Journal of dairy research,2019 05 30,"Subacute ruminal acidosis (SARA) can increase the level of inflammation and induce rumenitis in dairy cows. Berberine (BBR) is the major active component of Rhizoma Coptidis, which is a type of Chinese anti-inflammatory drug for gastrointestinal diseases. The purpose of this study was to investigate the anti-inflammatory effects of BBR on lipopolysaccharide (LPS)-stimulated rumen epithelial cells (REC) and the underlying molecular mechanisms. REC were cultured and stimulated with LPS in the presence or absence of different concentrations of BBR. The results showed that cell viability was not affected by BBR. Moreover, BBR markedly decreased the concentrations and mRNA expression of pro-inflammatory cytokines, including tumor necrosis factor-α, interleukin-1β, and interleukin-6 in the LPS-treated REC in a dose-dependent manner. Importantly, Western blotting analysis showed that BBR significantly suppressed the protein expression of toll-like receptor 4 (TLR4) and myeloid differentiation primary response protein (MyD88) and the phosphorylation of nuclear factor-κB (NF-κB), inhibitory kappa B (IκBα), p38 mitogen-activated protein kinase (MAPK), and c-Jun N-terminal kinase (JNK) in LPS-treated REC. Furthermore, the results of immunocytofluorescence showed that BBR significantly inhibited the nuclear translocation of NF-κB p65 induced by LPS treatment. In conclusion, the protective effects of BBR on LPS-induced inflammatory responses in REC may be due to its ability to suppress the TLR4-mediated NF-κB and MAPK signaling pathways. These findings suggest that BBR can be used as an anti-inflammatory drug to treat inflammation induced by SARA.",Metastatic Merkel cell carcinoma and myasthenia gravis: contraindication for therapy with immune checkpoint inhibitors?,https://www.ncbi.nlm.nih.gov/pubmed/31142383,Journal for immunotherapy of cancer,2019 06 10,"PD-1/PD-L1 inhibitors are promising approaches for advanced Merkel cell carcinoma (MCC).

While the structural characteristics of the disease-related proteinase K-resistant prion protein (resPrPD) associated with the CJD group are fairly well established, many features of GSS-associated resPrPD are unclear. Electrophoretic profiles of resPrPD associated with GSS variants typically show 6-8 kDa bands corresponding to the internal PrP fragments as well as a variable number of higher molecular weight bands, the molecular nature of which has not been investigated. Here we have performed systematic studies of purified resPrPD species extracted from GSS cases with the A117V (GSSA117V) and F198S (GSSF198S) PrP gene mutations. The combined analysis based on epitope mapping, deglycosylation treatment and direct amino acid sequencing by mass spectrometry provided a conclusive evidence that high molecular weight resPrPD species seen in electrophoretic profiles represent covalently-linked multimers of the internal ~ 7 and ~ 8 kDa fragments. This finding reveals a mechanism of resPrPD aggregate formation that has not been previously established in prion diseases.",Improved efficacy against malignant brain tumors with EGFRwt/EGFRvIII targeting immunotoxin and checkpoint inhibitor combinations.,https://www.ncbi.nlm.nih.gov/pubmed/31142380,Journal for immunotherapy of cancer,2019 06 10,"D2C7-IT is a novel immunotoxin (IT) targeting wild-type epidermal growth factor receptor (EGFRwt) and mutant EGFR variant III (EGFRvIII) proteins in glioblastoma.

The efficiency of the intervention was determined according to the time taken for a severe case to be downgraded to mild at ≤213.8 μmol/L. Results: A total of 486 patients were studied, 343 controls and 143 cases. Mean (SD) postnatal age was 6 days (0.7) for cases and 5 (0.9) for controls, for gestational age (GA) in completed weeks was 36 (0.5) for cases and 37 (0.7) for controls and for birthweight was 2.7 kg (0.25) for cases and 2.7 (0.22) for controls. Mean (SD) pre-intervention TSB was 299.3 (35.7) μmol/L for cases and 327.3 (13.9) for controls. Severity downgrade day was Day 2 (0.4) for cases and Day 5 (1.1) for controls. Overall relative EBT rate was 6% for cases and 55% for controls (p= 0.0001), and early preterm relative EBT rate was 0% for cases and 68% for controls (p < 0.01). Conclusion: TBPE was quicker and safer for reduction of hyperbilirubinaemia and patients rarely required EBT. TBPE is recommended for rapid reduction of serum bilirubin levels and the reduction of treatment costs, morbidity and mortality in low- and middle-income countries.

Little is known of the roles of AP-4, despite its loss of function leading to a severe early onset neurological disorder, AP-4 deficiency syndrome. Here we demonstrate an AP-4 epsilon subunit knockout mouse model that recapitulates characteristic neuroanatomical phenotypes of AP-4 deficiency patients. We show that ATG9A, critical for autophagosome biogenesis, is an AP-4 cargo, which is retained within the trans-Golgi network (TGN) in vivo and in culture when AP-4 function is lost. TGN retention results in depletion of axonal ATG9A, leading to defective autophagosome generation and aberrant expansions of the distal axon. The reduction in the capacity to generate axonal autophagosomes leads to defective axonal extension and de novo generation of distal axonal swellings containing accumulated ER, underlying the impaired axonal integrity in AP-4 deficiency syndrome.

Ultrasonic vocalization (USV) was used as an indicator of pain during the recovery period. The objective was to evaluate the physiological parameters and the analgesic effect of each protocol to determine which protocol was the safest and fulfil the requirements of a balanced anaesthesia. The better protocols were the XKA protocol for both sexes and the XKMe protocol for females because the combinations achieve surgical plane of anaesthesia in rats. However, pain assessment during the formalin test revealed that rats anaesthetized with XKA produced more numbers of USV, suggesting that it is not a good protocol for the control of immediate postoperative pain. All protocols produced depression in body temperature and respiratory and heart rates, and had important effects, such as micturition and maintenance of open eyes. Only rats anaesthetized with XKA protocol did not present piloerection. These results demonstrated that good monitoring and care during anaesthesia must be included to prevent complications that compromise the life of the animal and to ensure a good recovery. The inclusion of analgesia in anaesthesia protocols must be used routinely, ensuring minimal presence of pain and thus more reliable results in the experimental procedures.",Vitamin D and the nervous system.,https://www.ncbi.nlm.nih.gov/pubmed/31142227,Neurological research,2019 05 30,"Objective: to summarise the activities that Vitamin D (VD) carries out in the brain and to clarify the potential role of VD in neurological diseases. Methods: a literature research has been performed in Pubmed using the following keywords: 'Vitamin D', 'nervous system', 'brain'. Results: the studies reviewed show that VD contributes to cerebral activity in both embryonic and adult brain, helping the connectivity of neural circuits responsible for locomotor, emotional and reward-dependent behavior. Low VD serum levels have been found in patients affected by Alzheimer Disease, Parkinson Disease, Multiple Sclerosis, Autism Spectrum Disorders, Sleep Disorders and Schizophrenia. Discussion: findings are controversial and should be interpreted with caution, since most of the studies performed have observational study set and few interventional studies are available, producing conflicting results. Overall, it can be stated that the potential role of Vitamin D in neurological diseases is mostly unclear and further randomised controlled trials are needed to understand better whether Vitamin D supplementation treatment can be useful in brain disorders.",Cardiac-gated steady-state multifrequency magnetic resonance elastography of the brain: Effect of cerebral arterial pulsation on brain viscoelasticity.,https://www.ncbi.nlm.nih.gov/pubmed/31142226,Journal of cerebral blood flow and metabolism : official journal of the International Society of Cerebral Blood Flow and Metabolism,2019 05 30,"In-vivo brain viscoelasticity measured by magnetic resonance elastography (MRE) is a sensitive imaging marker for long-term biophysical changes in brain tissue due to aging and disease; however, it is still unknown whether MRE can reveal short-term periodic alterations of brain viscoelasticity related to cerebral arterial pulsation (CAP). We developed cardiac-gated steady-state MRE (ssMRE) with spiral readout and stroboscopic sampling of continuously induced mechanical vibrations in the brain at 20, 31.25, and 40 Hz frequencies. Maps of magnitude |G*| and phase ϕ of the complex shear modulus were generated by multifrequency dual visco-elasto inversion with a temporal resolution of 40 ms over 4 s. The method was tested in 12 healthy volunteers. During cerebral systole, |G*| decreased by 6.6 ± 1.9% (56 ± 22 Pa, p < 0.001, mean ± SD), whereas ϕ increased by 0.5 ± 0.5% (0.006 ± 0.005 rad, p = 0.002). The effect size of CAP-induced softening slightly decreased with age by 0.10 ± 0.05% per year ( p = 0.04), indicating lower cerebral vascular compliance in older individuals. Our data show for the first time that the brain softens and becomes more viscous during systole, possibly due to an effect of CAP-induced arterial expansion and increased blood volume on effective-medium tissue properties. This sensitivity to vascular-solid tissue interactions makes ssMRE potentially useful for detection of cerebral vascular disease.",Contrast leakage distant from the hematoma in patients with spontaneous ICH: A 7 T MRI study.,https://www.ncbi.nlm.nih.gov/pubmed/31142225,Journal of cerebral blood flow and metabolism : official journal of the International Society of Cerebral Blood Flow and Metabolism,2019 05 30,"Disruption of the blood-brain barrier (BBB) might play a role in the pathophysiology of cerebral small vessel disease-related ICH. The aim of this study was to assess presence and extent of contrast agent leakage distant from the hematoma as a marker of BBB disruption in patients with spontaneous ICH. We prospectively performed 7 tesla MRI in adult patients with spontaneous ICH and assessed contrast leakage distant from the hematoma on 3D FLAIR images. Thirty-one patients were included (mean age 60 years, 29% women). Median time between ICH and MRI was 20 days (IQR 9-67 days). Seventeen patients (54%; seven lobar, nine deep, one infratentorial ICH) had contrast leakage, located cortical in 16 and cortical and deep in one patient. Patients with contrast leakage more often had lobar cerebral microbleeds (CMBs; 77%) than those without (36%; RR 2.5, 95% CI 1.1-5.7) and a higher number of lobar CMBs (patients with contrast leakage: median 2, IQR 1-8 versus those without: median 0, IQR 0-2; p = 0.02). This study shows that contrast leakage distant from the hematoma is common in days to weeks after spontaneous ICH. It is located predominantly cortical and related to lobar CMBs and therefore possibly to cerebral amyloid angiopathy."

In this study, the balance of these subsets was investigated in pediatric immune thrombocytopenia (ITP) patients, and the frequencies of Bregs and Bmems before and after first-line therapy were measured. Methods: Forty-nine pediatric ITP patients and 19 normal controls were enrolled in this study. The total CD19+ B cells, Bregs and Bmems in the peripheral blood (PB) of all cases were measured by flow cytometry. Results: We found higher frequencies of total CD19+ B cells and Bmems in newly diagnosed ITP patients than those in normal controls (p < 0.01), whereas the frequencies of CD19+CD24hiCD38hi Bregs was significantly lower in ITP patients (p < 0.001). After therapy with MP + IVIG, the level of CD19+CD24hiCD38hi Bregs and Bmems were almost normalized.

In all, 487 undergraduate students (59.2% females) with a mean age of 20.66 ± 1.42 were recruited using a multistage clustering sampling method from eight schools from the fields of humanities, engineering, and basic sciences. Suicide Behavior Questionnaire-Revised form (SBQ-R) was employed for assessing past year suicidal ideation (PYSI, once or more), the meaningful likelihood of future suicide (mLoFS, a score of 2 or more), and suicide risk (SR ≥7). Relational ACEs were assessed in the form of a yes/no question, including caregivers' maltreatment, household relational dysfunction, family loss events, school events, and sexual abuse. Analyses were conducted using Fisher's exact test, chi-square test, and univariate binary logistic regression. The rates of PYSI, LoFS, and SR were, respectively, 37.2%, 44.6%, and 30.8%. The most experienced event was witnessing verbal violence (68.8%) and the least was divorce/separation (6.2%). All the events and domains (except family loss events), the interaction of domains, and cumulative events significantly increased the odds of suicide outcomes, in which females were more affected by all types of relational ACEs. Students whose ethnicity was Azari & Turk and who were studying in humanities or basic sciences showed a higher suicide risk than their counterparts. The study showed that the rates of relational ACEs and suicide outcomes were remarkable, in Iran. Because of the detrimental effects of relational ACEs on suicidality, mostly for females, it is necessary to improve the initiatives promoting child protection and legal support for health professionals to address child abuse. There is also an urgent need for providing young students with supports and effective interventions.",Robotic cholecystectomy for duplicated gallbladder.,https://www.ncbi.nlm.nih.gov/pubmed/31142212,Scottish medical journal,2019 05 30,Duplication of gallbladder is a rare congenital condition.

He defined the ""true philosopher"" as someone who eschewed monetary gain for his scientific work, preferring instead to give knowledge freely for the public good, and as someone working at a higher level than the mere experimentalist. Specifically, Davy presented himself as using the method of analogy to reach his discoveries and emphasised that he understood the ""principle"" behind his findings. He portrayed himself as one who perceived analogies because he had a wider perspective on the world than many others in his society. The poem in which he describes the ""true philosopher"" offers us Davy's private view of this character; the essay then demonstrates how Davy attempted to depict his own character in this way during critical moments in his career.",Concurrent Eosinophilic Solid and Cystic Renal Cell Carcinoma and Angiomyolipoma With Epithelial Cysts in the Setting of Tuberous Sclerosis Complex: A Rare Synchronous Occurrence of 2 Distinct Entities.,https://www.ncbi.nlm.nih.gov/pubmed/31142207,International journal of surgical pathology,2019 05 30,"Eosinophilic solid and cystic renal cell carcinoma (ESCRCC) is a recently described distinct renal neoplasm known to occur almost exclusively in female patients with or without tuberous sclerosis complex (TSC). We report a case of ESCRCC with 2 synchronous angiomyolipomas, including 1 angiomyolipoma with epithelial cysts (AMLEC), a rare cystic variant of AML that typically arises sporadically in the absence of TSC, in a 46-year-old woman with TSC. Besides additional copy number alterations identified in ESCRCC via molecular karyotyping, we also report a unique histologic feature of TSC-associated ESCRCC previously not described in detail, with formation of semicircular multinucleated neoplastic giant cells engulfing an additional intact neoplastic cell, simulating emperipolesis. To the best of our knowledge, this is the first reported case of ESCRCC with concurrent AMLEC in a patient with TSC, confirmed through additional genetic testing showing a germline heterozygous mutation in TSC1. Awareness of ESCRCC helps avoid the pitfall of a diagnosis of unclassified renal cell carcinoma, a typically much more aggressive tumor.","Workers' Fight for Justice: A Retrospective Exposure Profile Study of the GE Factory in Peterborough, Ontario.",https://www.ncbi.nlm.nih.gov/pubmed/31142206,New solutions : a journal of environmental and occupational health policy : NS,2019 05 30,"Occupational disease recognition is often hampered by lack of historical exposure data.

The Leisure-Time Exercise Questionnaire assessed frequency of exercise and of any activity ""long enough to work up a sweat."" We also measured optimism, exercise self-efficacy, depression, anxiety, and stress. Because hope emphasizes planning and motivation (both likely needed in fitness regimens), we expected it to relate to exercise frequency after controlling for these other variables. Indeed, exercise goal-specific hope was correlated with frequency of exercise and activity long enough to sweat, though general hope was not. This relationship held after controlling for all other variables. Future research may be useful in investigating causality, including whether hope-based interventions result in increased exercise engagement.","The Development of Autobiographical Memory, Autobiographical Narratives, and Autobiographical Consciousness.",https://www.ncbi.nlm.nih.gov/pubmed/31142189,Psychological reports,2019 05 30,"In this article, we expand on aspects of autobiographical memory initially laid out in our earlier exposition of the sociocultural developmental model. We present a developmental account of the integration of an extended subjective perspective within an extended narrative framework both of which are mediated through language and shared cultural narratives that culminate in autobiographical consciousness. Autobiographical consciousness goes beyond simple memories of past events to create a sense of extended self through time that has experienced and reflexively evaluated events. We argue from philosophical, evolutionary, and developmental psychological perspectives that narratives are a critical form of human consciousness, and that this form is learned through everyday social interactions that are linguistically mediated. Language has ""double-duality"" in that it is both outward facing, allowing more explicit, organized and differentiated communication to and with others, and language is also inward facing, in that language provides tools for organizing and differentiating internal consciousness. Although consciousness itself is multifaceted, we argue that language is the mechanism without which this particular form of human autobiographical consciousness would not develop.",Molecular characterization and expression of α-gliadin genes from wheat cultivar Dacke in Bg 250 rice variety.,https://www.ncbi.nlm.nih.gov/pubmed/31142188,GM crops & food,2019 06 13,"The main seed storage protein in wheat is gluten.

In addition to the myriad challenges that immigrants face in accessing health care in their new communities, undocumented immigrants living in Atlanta at that time faced the legal barrier presented by Georgia's new ""show me your papers"" law, which imbued public space with the risk of deportation for those who are undocumented. This law complicated health care access by making the trip to the doctor's office risky. Immigrants' health care decisions were thus shaped by the ""geography of fear"" that permeated their new communities. This fear presented itself not only in public space but also in clinics and hospitals, where many immigrants feared - and sometimes received - bad treatment. Despite the obstacles fear and immigrant policing presented, many of the women I interviewed showed boldness in their health care decisions, staking their claim to medical attention where they saw fit. Additionally, many maintained transnational networks and continued with familiar health practices from home. Combined, these strategies worked to create complex and shifting ""therapeutic landscapes"" in an environment permeated by insecurity and fear.",Social Inequalities in Following Official Guidelines on Healthy Diet During the Period of Economic Crisis in Spain.,https://www.ncbi.nlm.nih.gov/pubmed/31142185,"International journal of health services : planning, administration, evaluation",2019 06 10,"In Spanish society, social inequalities continue in connection with diet; however, no data examines whether these inequalities altered during the period of economic crisis. This article aims to analyze trends in inequalities related to adherence to government guidelines concerning healthy diet during the period of economic crisis based on the data obtained from the National Health Surveys conducted by the National Statistics Institute. The approach involves studying first the data from the 2006 survey, shortly before the crisis, and then comparing these with the data from the 2011-2012 survey. Applying models of logistic regression shows that certain social inequalities were accentuated by the crisis. However, the general and widespread pattern of eating habits does not disappear in times of crisis. Inequalities are more commonly seen when socioeconomic factors affect foods that the guidelines indicate should be eaten daily. However, with respect to more expensive products, socioeconomic factors did not have so much negative effect on how far a healthy diet was followed because it is recommended that consumption of these foods should be limited. The results suggest that food policy should have specific focuses during times of economic recession.",Counterfactual Thinking Among Victims of Sexual Assault: Relationships With Posttraumatic Stress and Posttraumatic Growth.,https://www.ncbi.nlm.nih.gov/pubmed/31142184,Journal of interpersonal violence,2019 05 30,"Counterfactual thinking is thinking of alternatives to events that have already occurred.

Upward counterfactual thinking-that is, thinking of preferable alternative outcomes-specific to sexual assault was associated with greater posttraumatic stress and greater posttraumatic growth, while downward counterfactual thinking-that is, thinking how things could have been worse-was associated with lower posttraumatic stress. Women endorsed approximately equal levels of upward and downward counterfactual thinking.

Recently, we showed that the oncolytic vaccinia virus GLV-1h68 has a therapeutic potential in treating human prostate and hepatocellular carcinomas in xenografted mice. In this study, we describe the use of dynamic boolean modeling for tumor growth prediction of vaccinia virus-injected human tumors. Antigen profiling data of vaccinia virus GLV-1h68-injected human xenografted mice were obtained, analyzed and used to calculate differences in the tumor growth signaling network by tumor type and gender. Our model combines networks for apoptosis, MAPK, p53, WNT, Hedgehog, the T-killer cell mediated cell death, Interferon and Interleukin signaling networks. The in silico findings conform very well with in vivo findings of tumor growth. Similar to a previously published analysis of vaccinia virus-injected canine tumors, we were able to confirm the suitability of our boolean modeling for prediction of human tumor growth after virus infection in the current study as well. In summary, these findings indicate that our boolean models could be a useful tool for testing of the efficacy of VACV-mediated cancer therapy already before its use in human patients.",Avascular necrosis of the capitate: case series of five patients and review of literature.,https://www.ncbi.nlm.nih.gov/pubmed/31142182,"The Journal of hand surgery, European volume",2019 05 30,"Avascular necrosis of the capitate is a rare disorder of unknown aetiology that causes wrist pain and limits function.

All patients had scaphocapitate and lunocapitate arthritis confirmed by arthroscopy. The mean follow-up was 5 years (range 1-9). At the latest follow-up, the mean wrist flexion-extension was 95° (versus 105° before surgery). Grip strength was 90% relative to the contralateral side. Functional scores were all significantly improved following treatment. Radiologically, fusion was achieved in all cases and there was no displacement or fracture of the bone fixation material.

However, despite being a critical component in early social theorizing, the physical environment remains in large part underdeveloped in most research programs. In this article, I outline an ecological framework for understanding the person-environment relationship. After introducing this perspective, I describe how this approach helps reveal the critical role played by the physical environment in a variety of social processes, including childhood development, interpersonal relationships, and social identity. Finally, I review a topic in environmental psychology that has received little attention among social psychologists: territories. I provide an ecological perspective on how the design, use, and personalization of this type of environment guide and constrain regulatory processes involving social behavior, identity expression, and emotional experience."

Leukemia inhibitory factor (LIF) is a pleiotropic cytokine from interleukin-6 family. Previous studies demonstrate that LIF is associated with several tolerogenic events; yet the exact effect of this cytokine on the generation and function of DCs was not explicitly identified. Materials and methods: To clarify the role of LIF in DCs development, immature DCs were differentiated from mouse bone marrow (BM) in a GM-CSF and IL-4 containing medium with or without LIF. Afterwards, in maturation process, the differentiated DCs were exposed to TNF-α in the presence or absence of LIF. Results: Immature DCs differentiated in the presence of LIF, proved a significant enhancement in the expression of MHCII, CD40, or CD86 molecules and in the antigen uptake function. LIF treatment of normal DCs while stimulating for maturation, caused a significant decrement in the expression of phenotypic markers as well as an increment in the antigen uptake function in comparison with TNF-α-only stimulated cells; however, the reduced ability for induction of allogenic T-cell proliferation proved no statistical significance. Conclusions: Our results can reflect a role for LIF in the generation and particularly maturation of DCs. It can be assumed that LIF rather modulates the maturation level, leading to the development of semi-mature and tolerogenic DCs. According to the high levels of LIF in immune-privileged sites like brain and uterine, it seems that the cytokine may account for the formation of local DCs that help the establishment of immunosuppressive environments.",Encounters with adenovirus.,https://www.ncbi.nlm.nih.gov/pubmed/31142167,Upsala journal of medical sciences,2019 06 10,"In this paper I describe aspects of work on the human adenoviruses in which my laboratory has participated.

This loss might be due to the likely toxicity of the bacteria involved, effects of inflammatory cytokines, or constant use of ototoxic antibiotics. All the studies evaluated up to the present date compared the affected ear with the normal contralateral ear. From the digitized archive of otological surgery files of the Department of Otorhinolaryngology, the ears of patients with chronic otorrhea were evaluated visually and compared with the normal contralateral ears. Ears with otorrhea were also compared to ears with dry tympanic perforation of other patients. Ears with suppuration were evaluated for cholesteatoma. The duration of otorrhea was taken into account. The sensorineural hearing threshold was evaluated for the frequencies of 500, 1000, 2000, and 4000 Hz. A total of 98 patients with chronic otorrhea and 60 with dry tympanic membrane perforation were evaluated. From a statistical study, a correlation between sensorineural hearing loss and the chronic otorrhea was observed, in comparison both with contralateral normal ears and with dry perforated ears of other patients. There was no relationship with the duration of suppuration or with whether this was due to cholesteatoma. Sensorineural hearing loss occurs in ears with chronic otorrhea. The duration of otorrhea and the etiology of suppuration did not influence the hearing loss.

A total of 43 patients with BTM were included in the study. Forty-three patients without any nasal complaints, history of facial trauma, or nasal surgery were included as the controls. All participants had nasal endoscopy. The iron-chelating agents used, their duration of use, as well as hemoglobin and ferritin levels of the BTM patients were recorded. Sniffin' Sticks test (SST) was used to assess olfactory functions, and BTM and control groups were compared for the results. The correlations of SST scores with the other study parameters were analyzed. Eight (18.6%) of 43 patients in the BTM group had hyposmia while none of the patients in the control group had hyposmia ( P < .001). Older age, low-hemoglobin level, and longer use of deferoxamine were found to be correlated with olfactory dysfunction.

Laboratory investigations revealed that the farms had been infected by the H9N2 influenza subtype. Virological and molecular characterization of the viruses identified in Ghana is described here for the first time. Whole genome analysis showed that the viruses belong to the G1-lineage and cluster with viruses identified in North and West Africa. The low pathogenicity of the virus was confirmed by the intravenous pathogenicity index assay. Further investigations revealed the co-infection with infectious bronchitis virus of the GI-19 lineage, which very likely explained the severity of the disease observed during the outbreaks. The H9N2 outbreaks in Ghana highlight the importance of performing a differential diagnosis and an in-depth characterization of emerging viruses. In addition, the detection of a potentially zoonotic subtype such as the H9N2 in a region where highly pathogenic avian influenza H5Nx is currently circulating highlights the urgency of implementing enhanced monitoring strategies and supporting improved investments in regional diagnostic technologies.

Here, it is investigated how the triboelectric charge formed upon contact with water drops depends on the microscale surface statistics of the polymer. In particular, it is found that the transition to a superhydrophobic fakir state results in a considerable reduction in triboelectric contact charge, due to a reduced liquid-solid contact area. Thus, when processing charge-sensitive electronic systems one may want to utilize such surfaces promoting reduced tribocharging. This also has implications for energy harvesting purposes, where one may collect electrical energy by letting water droplets move on the polymer with an interdigitated current-collecting electrode on its back side. In such a situation, it is observed that the surfaces promoting the superhydrophobic fakir state give rise to larger water droplet velocities and smaller collected charge, which explains the need for careful assessment of surface treatment before applying microstructured polymers for water droplet energy harvesting.",Water-Soluble Defect-Rich MoS2 Ultrathin Nanosheets for Enhanced Hydrogen Evolution.,https://www.ncbi.nlm.nih.gov/pubmed/31142117,The journal of physical chemistry letters,2019 06 11,"In this work, we report a facile cryo-mediated liquid phase exfoliation method to synthesize water-soluble defect-rich MoS2 ultrathin nanosheets (d-MoS2 NSs) with the assistance of NaBH4 in the solvent.

Development of antimicrobial dendritic polymers is considered promising as an alternative infection control strategy. For antimicrobial dendritic polymers to effectively kill bacteria residing in infectious biofilms, they have to penetrate and accumulate deep into biofilms. Biofilms are often recalcitrant to antimicrobial penetration and accumulation. Therefore, this work aims to determine the role of compact dendrons with different peripheral composition in their penetration into Pseudomonas aeruginosa biofilms. Red fluorescently labeled dendrons with pH-responsive NH3+ peripheral groups initially penetrated faster from a buffer suspension at pH 7.0 into the acidic environment of P. aeruginosa biofilms than dendrons with OH or COO- groups at their periphery. In addition, dendrons with NH3+ peripheral groups accumulated near the top of the biofilm due to electrostatic double-layer attraction with negatively charged biofilm components. However, accumulation of dendrons with OH and COO- peripheral groups was more evenly distributed across the depth of the biofilms than NH3+ composed dendrons and exceeded accumulation of NH3+ composed dendrons after 10 min of exposure. Unlike dendrons with NH3+ groups at their periphery, dendrons with OH or COO- peripheral groups, lacking strong electrostatic double-layer attraction with biofilm components, were largely washed-out during exposure to PBS without dendrons. Thus, penetration and accumulation of dendrons into biofilms is controlled by their peripheral composition through electrostatic double-layer interactions, which is an important finding for the further development of new antimicrobial or antimicrobial-carrying dendritic polymers.",Conformation Search Across Multiple-Level Potential-Energy Surfaces (CSAMP): A Strategy for Accurate Prediction of Protein-Ligand Binding Structures.,https://www.ncbi.nlm.nih.gov/pubmed/31142115,Journal of chemical theory and computation,2019 06 13,"Accurate protein binding structure determination presents a great challenge to both experiment and theory. Here, in this work, we propose a new DOX protocol which combines the ensemble molecular Docking as the coarse-level, structure Optimization with the semiempirical quantum mechanics methods as the medium level, and the eXtended ONIOM ( XO) calculations as the fine level. The fundamental of the DOX protocol relies on the Conformation Search Across Multiple-level Potential-energy surfaces (CSAMP) strategy, where the conformation spaces of a funnel-like structure are searched from the coarse level with hundreds of candidates to the medium level with around 10 top candidates to the fine level with the final top 1 or 2 binding modes. An in-depth test for the protocol set up against 28 crystallographic data consisting of HMGR-statins, SDase-inhibitors, 3HNRase-inhibitors, and NA-inhibitors yielded a satisfactory result with ∼0.5 Å root-mean-square deviations (RMSDs) on geometries and ∼0.8 kcal/mol absolute error of relative binding energies on average.

However, no effective means has been developed for specific detection of glutamate released from primary cultured neurons. Here we present a reduced graphene oxide (RGO)-based field effect transistor (FET) biosensor functionalized with synthesized glutamate receptor for real-time monitoring of glutamate release from primary cultured rat hippocampus neurons. Metabotropic glutamate receptors (mGluR) was specifically synthesized and then immobilized on the RGO surface by 1-pyrenebutanoic acid succinimidyl ester (PASE) linker, after which target glutamate (pI = 3.22) could specifically bind to the synthesized mGluR in the neutral buffer, causing the charge density change. After the neurons were cultured on the sensing channel with a self-made liquid reservoir, the FET biosensor could discriminate glutamate in the femtomolar range in complete cell culture medium and generate encouraging results in real-time monitoring of glutamate release from primary rat hippocampus neurons. This work is the first report of specific and direct detection of glutamate molecules released from primary culture of differentiated central neurons, which may further help understand the nature of neuronal communication. Moreover, this work paves a way for the detection of electrochemically inactive small molecules released by cells.",On the use of interaction energies in QM/MM free energy simulations.,https://www.ncbi.nlm.nih.gov/pubmed/31142113,Journal of chemical theory and computation,2019 05 30,"The use of the most accurate (i.e., QM or QM/MM) levels of theory for free energy simulations (FES) is typically not possible. Primarily, this is because the computational cost associated with the extensive configurational sampling needed for converging FES is prohibitive. To ensure the feasibility of QM-based FES, the ``indirect'' approach is generally taken, necessitating a free energy calculation between the MM and QM/MM potential energy surfaces. Ideally, this step is performed with standard free energy perturbation (Zwanzig's equation) as it only requires simulations be carried out at the low level of theory; however, work from several groups over the past few years has conclusively shown that Zwanzig's equation is ill-suited to this task. As such, many approximations have arisen to mitigate difficulties with Zwanzig's equation. One particularly popular notion is that the convergence of Zwanzig's equation can be improved by using interaction energy differences instead of total energy differences. Although problematic numerical fluctuations (a major problem when using Zwanzig's equation) are indeed reduced, our results and analysis demonstrate that this ``interaction energy approximation'' (IEA) is theoretically incorrect, and the implicit approximation invoked is spurious at best. Herein, we demonstrate this via solvation free energy calculations using IEA from two different low levels of theory to the same target high level. Results from this proof-of-concept consistently yield the wrong results, deviating by $\sim$1.5 kcal/mol from the rigorously obtained value.",Tackling Halogenated Species with PBSA: Effect of Emulating the σ-Hole.,https://www.ncbi.nlm.nih.gov/pubmed/31142112,Journal of chemical theory and computation,2019 06 14,"To model halogen-bond phenomena using classical force fields, an extra point (EP) of charge is frequently introduced at a given distance from the halogen (X) to emulate the σ-hole. The resulting molecular dynamics (MD) trajectories can be used in subsequent molecular mechanics (MM) combined with Poisson-Boltzmann and surface area calculations (PBSA) to estimate protein-ligand binding free energies (Δ Gbind). While EP addition improves the MM/MD description of halogen-containing systems, its effect on the calculation of solvation free energies (Δ Gsolv) using the PBSA approach is yet to be assessed. As the PBSA calculations depend, among other parameters, on the empirical assignment of radii (PB radii), a problematic issue arises, since standard halogen radii are smaller than the typical X···EP distances, thus placing the EP within the solvent dielectric. Herein, we took a common literature EP parametrization scheme, which uses X···EP = Rmin and RESP charges in the context of GAFF, and performed a comprehensive study on the performance of PBSA (using three different setups) in the calculation of Δ Gsolv values for 142 halogenated compounds (bearing Cl, Br, or I) for which the experimental values are known. By conducting an optimization (minimizing the error against experimental values), we provide a new optimized set of halogen PB radii, for each PBSA setup, that should be used in the context of the aforementioned scenario. A simultaneous optimization of PB radii and X···EP distances shows that a wide range of distance/radius pairs can be used without significant loss of accuracy, therefore laying the basis for expanding this halogen radii optimization strategy to other force fields and EP implementations. As ligand Δ Gsolv estimation is an important term in the determination of protein-ligand Δ Gbind, this work is particularly relevant in the framework of structure-based virtual screening and related computer-aided drug design routines.",Dual Imide-Functionalized Unit-Based Regioregular D-A1-D-A2 Polymers for Efficient Unipolar n-Channel Organic Transistors and All-Polymer Solar Cells.,https://www.ncbi.nlm.nih.gov/pubmed/31142111,ACS applied materials & interfaces,2019 06 12,"The demand for the development of more promising n-type semiconducting polymers with excellent electron mobilities and air stabilities is growing fast. In this study, we designed and synthesized a series of new dual imide-functionalized derivative-based regioregular D-A1-D-A2 copolymers with different side chains (namely, PNT-R, R = 2-decyltetradecyl (DT), 2-octadecyldodecyl (OD), and 2-hexyldecyl (HD)). These new polymers PNT-R showed strong electron affinities with deep lowest unoccupied molecular orbital (LUMO) levels down to -4.01 eV, indicating that they are promising electron-transporting materials. To optimize the electron mobility, side-chain engineering was adopted. Thus, the effects of the side-chain length on their optoelectronic and charge-transport properties as well as the performances of all-polymer solar cells (all-PSCs) were systematically investigated. Shortening the side-chain length significantly expanded the absorption range, deepened the LUMO energy level, strengthened the molecular packing properties, and developed more crystalline microstructures in the solid state, as evidenced by the ultraviolet-visible absorption spectra, cyclic voltammetry, synchrotron two-dimensional grazing-incidence wide-angle X-ray scattering, and atomic force microscopy measurements. Consequently, the highest electron mobility of 1.05 cm2 V-1 s-1 was achieved in PNT-HD-based organic thin-film transistors (OTFTs). Also, PNT-R polymers were successfully applied as electron acceptors in all-PSCs. In good agreement with the OTFT results, the highest power conversion efficiency of 6.62% was obtained for the PNT-HD-blend film due to its excellent short-circuit current ( Jsc) value (12.07 mA cm-2), which was much higher than that of the PNT-DT- and PNT-OD-based all-PSCs (7.67 and 10.19 mA cm-2, respectively). By further investigating the dependence of the Jsc and open-circuit voltage ( Voc) on the illuminated light intensity ( P), the high Jsc value of the PNT-HD-based device was found to originate from its highly suppressed mono- and bimolecular recombination as well as efficient exciton dissociation and charge transfer at the donor-acceptor interfaces. Overall, this study provides insights into the naphthalenediimide-based regioregular D-A1-D-A2 copolymers used in all-PSCs and offers important design guidelines for future development of n-type semiconducting polymers.",Predicting Molecular Energy Using Force-Field Optimized Geometries and Atomic Vector Representations Learned from an Improved Deep Tensor Neural Network.,https://www.ncbi.nlm.nih.gov/pubmed/31142110,Journal of chemical theory and computation,2019 06 12,"The use of neural networks to predict molecular properties calculated from high level quantum mechanical calculations has made significant advances in recent years, but most models need input geometries from DFT optimizations which limit their applicability in practice. In this work, we explored how machine learning can be used to predict molecular atomization energies and conformation stability using optimized geometries from Merck Molecular Force Field (MMFF). On the basis of the recently introduced deep tensor neural network (DTNN) approach, we first improved its training efficiency and performed an extensive search of its hyperparameters, and developed a DTNN_7ib model which has a test accuracy of 0.34 kcal/mol mean absolute error (MAE) on QM9 data set. Then using atomic vector representations in the DTNN_7ib model, we employed transfer learning (TL) strategy to train readout layers on the QM9M data set, in which QM properties are the same as in QM9 [calculated at the B3LYP/6-31G(2df,p) level] while molecular geometries are corresponding local minima optimized with MMFF94 force field. The developed TL_QM9M model can achieve an MAE of 0.79 kcal/mol using MMFF optimized geometries. Furthermore, we demonstrated that the same transfer learning strategy with the same atomic vector representation can be used to develop a machine learning model that can achieve an MAE of 0.51 kcal/mol in molecular energy prediction using MMFF geometries for an eMol9_CM conformation data set, which consists of 9959 molecules and 88 234 conformations with energies calculated at the B3LYP/6-31G* level. Our results indicate that DFT-level accuracy of molecular energy prediction can be achieved using force-field optimized geometries and atomic vector representations learned from deep tensor neural network, and integrated molecular modeling and machine learning would be a promising approach to develop more powerful computational tools for molecular conformation analysis.","Correlation of Optical, Structural, and Compositional Properties with V-Pit Distribution in InGaN/GaN Multiquantum Wells.",https://www.ncbi.nlm.nih.gov/pubmed/31142109,ACS applied materials & interfaces,2019 06 12,"InGaN/GaN double heterostructures and multiquantum wells (MQWs) have been successfully developed since more than 20 years for LED lightning applications. Recent developments show that state-of-the-art LEDs benefit from artificially generated V-pit defects. However, the control of structural and chemical properties plays a tremendous role. In this paper, we report on the lateral distribution of V-pit defects and photoluminescence of InGaN/GaN MQWs grown on thick GaN on patterned sapphire substrates. The synchrotron-based scanning X-ray diffraction microscopy technique K-map was employed to locally correlate these properties with the local tilt, strain, and composition of the InGaN/GaN MQW. Compositional fluctuation is the main factor for the variation of photoluminescence intensity and broadening. In turn, V-pit defects align along small-angle grain boundaries and their strain fields are identified as a reason for promoting the InGaN segregation process on a microscale."

Methods: The pregnant Sprague Dawley (SD) rats (n=10) were randomly divided into the diabetic group (a single intraperitoneal injection of 35 mg/kg streptozotocin on day 0 of gestation) and control group (injected with the equal volume of 0.9% saline on day 0 of gestation) according to the random number table (n=5 each group). The offspring rats were divided into 4 groups including offspring of control dams treated with vehicle, offspring of control dams treated with antioxidant, offspring of diabetic dams treated with vehicle and offspring of diabetic dams treated with antioxidant (n=10 each group). After birth, the offspring rats were treated with normal drinking water or antioxidant (tempol, 1.0 mmol/L) from the age of 4 weeks until the end of the study (20 weeks). The blood pressure was monitored continuously by non-invasive tail-cuff method. The renal oxidative markers including superoxide dismutase (SOD) and malondialdehyde (MDA) activity and D(1) receptor agonist (fenoldopam)-mediated urinary and sodium excretion were detected. Furthermore, the protein expression of renal G protein-coupled receptor kinase 2 (GRK2), GRK4, dopamine D(1) receptor and the phosphorylation level of D(1) receptor were detected. Results: The mean arterial pressure of offspring from the diabetic dams treated with vehicle was significantly higher than that of offspring from control dams treated with vehicle (P=0.013), while the mean arterial pressure of offspring from diabetic dams treated with antioxidant was significantly lower than that of offspring from the diabetic dams treated with vehicle (P=0.038). The fenoldopam-mediated urinary flow and urinary sodium excretion rate were significantly lower in offspring of diabetic dams treated with vehicle than those in offspring of control dams treated with vehicle (P<0.01), which were significantly higher in offspring of diabetic dams treated with antioxidant as compared to offspring of diabetic dams treated with vehicle (both P<0.01). There was no significant difference in fenoldopam-mediated urinary flow and urinary sodium excretion rate in offspring of control dams treated with antioxidant or vehicle (urinary flow: P=0.772; urinary sodium excretion rate: P=0.716). Compared with offspring of control dams treated with vehicle, the renal MDA activity was significantly increased, while the SOD activity was significantly decreased in offspring of diabetic dams treated with vehicle (MDA: P<0.01; SOD: P=0.013). The renal MDA activity was significantly decreased, while the SOD activity was significantly increased in offspring of diabetic dams treated with antioxidant in comparison with offspring of diabetic dams treated with vehicle (MDA: P<0.01; SOD: P=0.035).The renal GRK2 and GRK4 protein expression in offspring of diabetic dams treated with vehicle were significantly higher than those in offspring of control dams treated with vehicle (P<0.01), while the expression levels of renal GRK2 and GRK4 in offspring of diabetic dams treated with antioxidant were significantly downregulated compared with offspring of diabetic dams treated with vehicle (P<0.01).

Methods: A total of 3 578 patients (age<18 years old) received surgery for congenital heart diseases from January to December 2015 in Fuwai hospital were enrolled, and the clinical data were retrospectively analyzed. The congenital heart disease patients were 1.7 (0.8, 4.5) years old, and the male accounted for 54.3% (1 943 cases).Death after surgery and major complications including use of extracorporeal membrane oxygenation, bedside thoracotomy, peritoneal dialysis for renal failure, bedside hemofiltration for renal failure, tracheotomy, reoperation for mediastinum infection, reoperation for heart in hospital were observed. The area under the receiver operating characteristic (ROC) curve was calculated to evaluate the predictive value for mortality after surgery and major complications with RACHS-1, ABC, and STAT risk scoring systems. Results: The mortality after surgery was 0.4% (14/3 578) , and the rate of major complications was 3.2% (113/3 578) . For mortality after surgery, areas under the ROC curve were 0.682 (95%CI 0.570-0.795, P=0.002), 0.722 (95%CI 0.612-0.832, P<0.001), and 0.753 (95%CI 0.659-0.847, P<0.001) with RACHS-1, ABC and STAT risk scoring systems, respectively.

Methods: This study was a clinical case control study. Two hundred and sixty-six elderly patients (≥60 years old), who were hospitalized between April 2016 and November 2017 in Geriatric Department of Peking University First Hospital, were included. They were divided into direct standing group and indirect standing group. Direct standing group involved 102 patients, they changed posture from supine directly to standing position, and the blood pressures at the moments of supine, immediately after standing and the first, second, and third minute after standing were recorded by continuous noninvasive arterial pressure (CNAP) system. Indirect standing group involved 164 patients, and they changed posture from supine to sitting for 3 minutes, and then changed to standing position. Blood pressures at the moments of supine, immediately after sitting, the third minute after sitting, immediately after standing and the third minute after standing was recorded by CNAP. Blood pressure changes after different postural changes mode and the rates of OH were compared. The related factors of OH was analyzed by binary logistic regression analysis. Results: The lowest systolic blood pressures (SBP) mostly occurred immediately after postural change: immediately after standing for direct standing group (86.3%(88/102)), and immediately after sitting for indirect standing group (59.1%(97/164)). The lowest diastolic blood pressures (DBP) mostly occurred immediately after standing in the two groups: 87.3%(89/102) for direct standing group and 43.3% (71/164) for indirect standing group. The maximum SBP drop (SBP of supine minus the lowest SBP during postural changes) of direct standing group was significantly higher than indirect standing group (median 20.5(14.0, 29.3) vs. 18.0(11.0, 26.0) mmHg (1 mmHg=0.133 kPa, P<0.05). The rates of OH occurred immediately and within 3 minutes from supine to standing position were significantly higher in direct standing group than in indirect standing group (65.7% (67/102) vs. 43.9% (72/164), and 70.6% (72/102) vs. 49.4% (81/164), both P<0.05). Binary logistic regression analysis showed that brachial-ankle pulse wave velocity was positively associated with OH after a transition from supine to standing position (immediately and within 3 minutes, OR=1.002 (95%CI 1.000-1.004), 1.003 (95%CI 1.001-1.006), P=0.014, 0.006) in direct standing group. Conclusions: OH is common in elderly hospitalized patients. The most obvious blood pressure changes are likely to occur immediately after position changes. Adding a sitting position during the transition of supine to standing position may decrease the amplitude of SBP drop. Brachial-ankle pulse wave velocity is associated with OH after the transition from the supine to standing position in the elderly inpatients."

The VAS-1 were significantly lower in observation group than in control group (F=3.904, P=0.000). Conversely, the VNS-1 were higher in observation group (F=3.526, P=0.000). At 30-minute postoperative, the VAS-2 and VNS-2 were 0.7±0.4 and 3.7±0.2 in the control group, respectively. The VAS-2 and VNS-2 were 0.6±0.5 and 3.8±0.1 in the observation group, respectively. There were no significant differences in the pain scores or the satisfaction scores between the 2 groups (F=1.429, 2.825; P=0.136, 0.083). The incidence of overall complications was 26.4% (23/87) in the control group and 25.3% (20/79) in the observation group, with no statistical difference between the 2 groups (χ(2)=0.027, P=0.869). And the complications had no statistically significant difference among the 2 groups including hematuria, urinary retention, infection, hematospermia, vascular and neurological reactions, nausea, vomiting, dizziness, headache, and respiratory depression (P>0.05).

Methods: Data of 582 de novo mPCa patients between January 2011 and December 2017 diagnosed at Departments of Urology, West China Hospital, Sichuan University were retrospectively analyzed. The age was (70±8) years (range: 45 to 89 years). IDC-P was identified from 12-core prostate biopsy. The prognostic role of IDC-P was assessed by Kaplan-Meier curves and Cox regression. Subgroup analysis was conducted by the forest plot. The endpoints were castration-resistant prostate cancer free survival (CFS) and overall survival (OS). Results: In total, 177/582 (30.4%) patients harbored IDC-P. Patients with IDC-P had poorer CFS and OS than those without IDC-P (mCFS: 12.1 months vs. 16.9 months, P=0.000; mOS: 39.7 months vs. not reached, P=0.000). Multivariate Cox regression analysis indicated that, the existence of IDC-P was an independent prognosticator of both CFS (HR=1.40, 95% CI: 1.10 to 1.79, P=0.006) and OS (HR=1.51, 95% CI: 1.02 to 2.25, P=0.041). Subanalysis indicated that, in most subgroups, IDC-P was an adverse prognosticator of both CFS and OS. Even in subgroups with adverse clinicopathological features, e.g. Gleason score 9 to 10 (CFS: HR=1.467, P=0.007; OS: HR=1.807, P=0.013), baseline prostate specific antigen≥50 μg/L (CFS: HR=1.616, P=0.000; OS: HR=1.749, P=0.006), anemia (CFS: HR=1.653, P=0.036; OS: HR=2.100, P=0.038), alkaline phosphatase≥160 U/L (CFS: HR=1.326, P=0.038; OS: HR=1.725, P=0.010) or abnormal lactate dehydrogenase level (CFS: HR=1.614, P=0.001; OS: HR=1.900, P=0.003), IDC-P was still closely associated with shorter CFS and OS. Conclusions: The presence of IDC-P was closely related to poor survival outcomes for patients with mPCa. IDC-P was an adverse prognosticator in most subgroup patients. The description of IDC-P in the pathological report of prostate biopsy would help clinicians to evaluate the prognosis of mPCa patients more accurately and make better treatment choices.",[Chemotherapy combined with androgen-deprivation therapy in high-volume metastatic hormone sensitive prostate cancer: a short-term efficacy and safety analysis].,https://www.ncbi.nlm.nih.gov/pubmed/31142065,Zhonghua wai ke za zhi [Chinese journal of surgery],2019 05 30,"Objective: To investigate the short-term efficacy and adverse events of chemotherapy combined with androgen-deprivation therapy in high-volume metastatic hormone sensitive prostate cancer. Methods: From March 2015 to August 2017, 55 patients with high-volume metastatic hormone sensitive prostate cancer were enrolled at Department of Urology, Fudan University Shanghai Cancer Center receiving chemotherapy combined with androgen-deprivation therapy. The age was 65(8) years (M(Q(R))) (range: 46 to 79 years). Patients were enrolled in the study for continuous androgen-deprivation therapy (medical or surgical castration), combined with docetaxel 75 mg/m(2) intravenous injection on the first day, repeated every 21 days (6 cycles). Endpoints included overall survival, progression-free survival of prostate cancer, prostate specific antigen (PSA) response rate, and adverse events. Results: The follow-up time was 21.2(11.7) months. The PSA value before chemotherapy was 144.9(415.3) μg/L. The days in patients undergoing androgen deprivation therapy before chemotherapy was 14(23) days. Four patients (7.3%) presented 0 in Eastern Cooperative Oncology Group scoring system and 51 patients(92.7%) presented 1. Thirty-nine patients (70.9%) completed more than 6 cycles of combined chemotherapy, 17 patients (30.9%) showed PSA<0.2 μg/L at 6 months after treatment, and 14 patients (25.5%) showed PSA<0.2 μg/L at 12 months after treatment.

The Academician Mengchao Wu divided the liver into five sections and four segments base on its anatomy, this classification is very direct and visual, thus had been using till now. In order to overcome those complicated problems, it is considered to develop a new classification based on actual anatomic location similar to that for liver cancer, which is easy to remember and to directly determine the treatment strategy. All kinds of classifications have their own characteristics and advantages and disadvantages.

Most of HCC patients are associated with varied degrees of liver cirrhosis.Severity of liver cirrhosis adversely affects the outcomes of liver resection, and also plays a vital role in making an appropriate surgical strategy for HCC.In current surgical practice for HCC, liver function and functional reserve are the focus of preoperative evaluation. Liver cirrhosis is still widely regarded as an one-stage entity. The pathological severity of liver cirrhosis is largely ignored. As neither liver function nor functional reserve can reflect the pathological severity of liver cirrhosis when liver function is at the stage of compensation. Preoperative evaluation on the severity of cirrhosis has not been established in a surgical setting.Thus, there is an urgent need to stage the severity of cirrhosis in surgical practice in order to make more precise surgical modalities for individual patients.This article mainly introduces the ongoing research progress in staging the severity of liver cirrhosis while treating HCC at Hepatic Surgery Center, Tongji Hospital, Tongji Medical College, Huazhong University of Science and Technology, and emphasizes the importance of staging the severity of cirrhosis in surgical treatment of HCC.",[Consensus statements and operation guidelines on breast lesions and lymph nodes biopsy guided by ultrasound].,https://www.ncbi.nlm.nih.gov/pubmed/31142062,Zhonghua wai ke za zhi [Chinese journal of surgery],2019 05 30,"With the advancement of clinical concepts and techniques in diagnosis and treatment of breast diseases, pathological evaluation of breast lesions and regional lymph nodes using tissue biopsy has been widely recognized in clinical practice.

Low-frequency electrical stimulation (LFS) of various anti-nociceptive targets improves outcomes after SCI, including motor recovery and mechanical allodynia. However, the mechanisms of these beneficial effects are incompletely delineated and probably multiple. Our aim was to explore near-term effects of LFS in the hindbrain's nucleus raphe magnus (NRM) on cellular proliferation in a rat SCI model. Starting 24 h after incomplete contusional SCI at C5, intermittent LFS at 8 Hz was delivered wirelessly to NRM. Controls were given inactive stimulators. At 48 h, 5-bromodeoxyuridine (BrdU) was administered and, at 72 h, spinal cords were extracted and immunostained for various immune and neuroglial progenitor markers and BrdU at the level of the lesion and proximally and distally. LFS altered cell marker counts predominantly at the dorsal injury site. BrdU cell counts were decreased. Individually and in combination with BrdU, there were reductions in CD68 (monocytes) and Sox2 (immature neural precursors) and increases in Blbp (radial glia) expression. CD68-positive cells showed increased co-staining with iNOS. No differences in the expression of GFAP (glia) and NG2 (oligodendrocytes) or in GFAP cell morphology were found. In conclusion, our work shows that LFS of NRM in subacute SCI influences the proliferation of cell types implicated in inflammation and repair, thus providing mechanistic insight into deep brain stimulation as a neuromodulatory treatment for this devastating pathology.",Fecal Microbiota Transplantation Controls Murine Chronic Intestinal Inflammation by Modulating Immune Cell Functions and Gut Microbiota Composition.,https://www.ncbi.nlm.nih.gov/pubmed/31142049,Cells,2019 05 30,"Different gastrointestinal disorders, including inflammatory bowel diseases (IBD), have been linked to alterations of the gut microbiota composition, namely dysbiosis. Fecal microbiota transplantation (FMT) is considered an encouraging therapeutic approach for ulcerative colitis patients, mostly as a consequence of normobiosis restoration. We recently showed that therapeutic effects of FMT during acute experimental colitis are linked to functional modulation of the mucosal immune system and of the gut microbiota composition. Here we analysed the effects of therapeutic FMT administration during chronic experimental colitis, a condition more similar to that of IBD patients, on immune-mediated mucosal inflammatory pathways. Mucus and feces from normobiotic donors were orally administered to mice with established chronic Dextran Sodium Sulphate (DSS)-induced colitis. Immunophenotypes and functions of infiltrating colonic immune cells were evaluated by cytofluorimetric analysis. Compositional differences in the intestinal microbiome were analyzed by 16S rRNA sequencing. Therapeutic FMT in mice undergoing chronic intestinal inflammation was capable to decrease colonic inflammation by modulating the expression of pro-inflammatory genes, antimicrobial peptides, and mucins. Innate and adaptive mucosal immune cells manifested a reduced pro-inflammatory profile in FMT-treated mice. Finally, restoration of a normobiotic core ecology contributed to the resolution of inflammation. Thus, FMT is capable of controlling chronic intestinal experimental colitis by inducing a concerted activation of anti-inflammatory immune pathways, mechanistically supporting the positive results of FMT treatment reported in ulcerative colitis patients.",High Normal Range of Free Thyroxine is Associated with Decreased Triglycerides and with Increased High-Density Lipoprotein Cholesterol Based on Population Representative Data.,https://www.ncbi.nlm.nih.gov/pubmed/31142048,Journal of clinical medicine,2019 05 30,"Background: We aimed to evaluate the association between thyroid hormone (free thyroxine, free T4) level and lipid profiles in nationally representative data. Methods: This study was based on cross-sectional survey data from the sixth Korea National Health and Nutrition Examination Survey IV. After exclusion of subjects with a history of thyroid disease or abnormal thyroid function test and those on medication for dyslipidemia and/or cardiovascular disease, a total of 3548 subjects were included in the study. Results: There was a significant decrease in serum triglyceride levels and increase in serum high-density lipoprotein (HDL) cholesterol levels with high free T4 quartiles after adjustment for confounding factors (p for trend = 0.001 and p for trend = 0.014, respectively). Risk of hypertriglyceridemia was significantly decreased (odds ratio of 0.72 (95% confidential interval 0.53-0.98)) in the highest free T4 quartile compared to the lowest free T4 quartile, p = 0.044). Conclusions: Serum free T4 levels within normal range negatively correlated with serum triglyceride level and positively correlated with HDL-cholesterol level. Therefore, a close surveillance in terms of lipid profiles could be considered in subjects with low normal serum free T4 levels.",The Impact of Environmental Transmission and Epidemiological Features on the Geographical Translocation of Highly Pathogenic Avian Influenza Virus.,https://www.ncbi.nlm.nih.gov/pubmed/31142047,International journal of environmental research and public health,2019 05 30,"The factors affecting the transmission and geographic translocation of avian influenza viruses (AIVs) within wild migratory bird populations remain inadequately understood. In a previous study, we found that environmental transmission had little impact on AIV translocation in a model of a single migratory bird population. In order to simulate virus transmission and translocation more realistically, here we expanded this model system to include two migratory bird flocks. We simulated AIV transmission and translocation while varying four core properties: 1) Contact transmission rate; 2) infection recovery rate; 3) infection-induced mortality rate; and 4) migration recovery rate; and three environmental transmission properties: 1) Virion persistence; 2) exposure rate; and 3) re-scaled environmental infectiousness; as well as the time lag in the migration schedule of the two flocks. We found that environmental exposure rate had a significant impact on virus translocation in the two-flock model. Further, certain epidemiological features (i.e., low infection recovery rate, low mortality rate, and high migration transmission rate) in both flocks strongly affected the likelihood of virus translocation. Our results further identified the pathobiological features supporting AIV intercontinental dissemination risk.",Reformulation and Priorities for Reducing Energy Density; Results from a Cross-Sectional Survey on Fat Content in Pre-Packed Cakes and Biscuits Sold in British Supermarkets.,https://www.ncbi.nlm.nih.gov/pubmed/31142046,Nutrients,2019 05 30,"Cakes and biscuits contribute to energy, total and saturated fat and sugar in British diets. So far, the UK government has prompted manufacturers to reduce energy density in these products through a reduction of their sugar content. We conducted a cross-sectional survey of the fat content of cakes and biscuits available in nine UK supermarket chains. In cakes (n = 381), the mean total fat content was 17.9 ± 5.2 g/100 g (39% of the overall energy); range (1.4-35.6 g/100 g) and the average saturated fat content in cakes was 5.9 ± 3.4 g/100 g (13% of the overall energy); range (0.3-20 g/100 g). In biscuits (n = 481), the mean total fat content was 21.8 g ± 6.3 g/100 g (40% of the overall energy); range (0.7-38.9 g/100 g) and the average saturated fat content was 11.4 ± 4.9 g/100 g (23% of the overall energy); range (0.3-22.3 g/100 g). In both cakes and biscuits, total and saturated fat content was positively correlated with energy density. Our results show that cakes and biscuits sold in UK supermarkets are high in total and saturated fat, and that fat content contributes substantially to product energy density. Fat reformulation in these products would effectively reduce energy density, calorie intake and help prevent obesity. Fat reformulation should be implemented simultaneously with sugar reformulation and be focused on saturated fat, as this will have the additional effect of lowering LDL cholesterol.",Usnic Acid Potassium Salt: Evaluation of the Acute Toxicity and Antinociceptive Effect in Murine Model.,https://www.ncbi.nlm.nih.gov/pubmed/31142045,"Molecules (Basel, Switzerland)",2019 05 30,"To obtain usnic acid potassium salt (PS-UA), the usnic acid (UA) was extracted and purified from the lichen Cladoniasubstellata, and modified to produce PS-UA.

Antinociceptive activity was detected through contortions in mice induced by acetic acid and formalin (phases I and II) after treatments with 10 and 20 mg/kg of PS-UA, indicating interference in both non-inflammatory and inflammatory pain. After oral administration at doses of 500, 1000 and 2000 mg/kg, no deaths of mice with treatments below 2000 mg/kg were observed. Except for body weight gain, food and water consumption decreased with treatments of 1000 and 2000 mg/kg, and the number of segmented leukocytes was higher for both treatments. Regarding serum levels, cholesterol and triglycerides decreased, however, there was an increase in hepatic transaminases with both treatments. Liver and kidney histological changes were detected in treatments of 2000 mg/kg, while the spleen was preserved.

To evaluate cell integrity and body cell mass, PA and BIVA were evaluated in children orally supplemented with zinc at different concentrations. Anthropometric, bioelectrical (resistance and reactance) and serum zinc variables were collected from two randomized, triple-blind, controlled clinical trials. Sampling was composed of 71 children consisting of three groups: a control group who received a placebo and two experimental groups who received oral supplementation of 5 or 10 mg-Zn/day for three months. The three groups presented increases (p < 0.001) in the linear height and weight. In the group supplemented with 10 mg-Zn/day, there was an increase in reactance values (p = 0.036) and PA (p = 0.002), in addition to vector displacement (p < 0.001) in relation to the confidence ellipses. An increase in serum zinc concentration was found (p < 0.001) in all three groups.

The effects of the cumulative proton irradiation fluence on the evolution of the microstructure of AISI 420 were studied by transmission electron microscopy (TEM). Scratch tests were performed using a Tribo Indenter nanomechanical tester, in order to investigate the effects of the cumulative fluence on the tribological properties of the AISI 420 stainless steel. The results indicate that the dislocation density of the microstructure near the surface of the AISI 420 stainless steel increases with higher cumulative proton irradiation fluences. Under the same load, the nanoscale friction coefficient and wear rate both decreased with increasing cumulative proton irradiation fluence. This indicates that the surface hardening effect induced by proton irradiation can diminish the nanoscale friction coefficient and wear rate.",The Evaluation of Indicators Used to Assess the Suitability of Agricultural Waste for Fermentation.,https://www.ncbi.nlm.nih.gov/pubmed/31142042,International journal of environmental research and public health,2019 05 30,"To ensure high fermentation efficiency, it is necessary to assess the biodegradability of a substrate. These parameters are most often determined on the basis of the amount of loss on ignition and total organic carbon. We are more and more often using chemical indices. However, these indices do not provide information on how much an organic substance is susceptible to biodegradation. The actual assessment of the content of easily biodegradable matter in substrates that are used for fermentation should be performed on the basis of aerobic (AT4) and anaerobic tests (BMP), which require specialised equipment and are time consuming. The AT4 index is being more and more frequently adopted for the analysis of substrates that are used in the fermentation process, because AT4 takes a much shorter time than BMP and provides information on the biodegradability of substrates. The aim of the article is to answer the question of whether the AT4 parameter can be used to assess the suitability of the substrate from the agricultural sector for the fermentation process. The results show that the AT4 index could be used instead of the BMP parameter."

BARD1 is a potentially predisposing BC gene, however, the rarity of its mutations and an insufficient family/study size have hampered corroboration and estimation of the associated cancer risks. To clarify the role of BARD1 mutations in BC predisposition, a comprehensive case-control association study of a recurring nonsense mutation c.1690C>T (p.Q564X) was performed, comprising ~14,000 unselected BC patients and ~5900 controls from Polish and Belarusian populations. For comparisons, two BARD1 variants of unknown significance were also genotyped. We detected the highest number of BARD1 variants in BC cases in any individual BARD1-specific study, including 38 p.Q564X mutations. The p.Q564X was associated with a moderately increased risk of BC (OR = 2.30, p = 0.04). The estimated risk was even higher for triple-negative BC and bilateral BC. As expected, the two tested variants of unknown significance did not show significant associations with BC risk. Our study provides substantial evidence for the association of a deleterious BARD1 mutation with BC as a low/moderate risk allele. The p.Q564X was shown to be a Central European recurrent mutation with potential relevance for future genetic testing.","Reply to Comment on Chen, J., Su, Y., Si, H., Chen, J.

This extract showed also an antioxidant activity, corresponding to 170.960 ± 16. mmol Trolox equivalent/g (oxygen radical absorbance capacity assay-ORAC) and to 30.554 ± 2.30 mmol Trolox equivalent/g (Trolox equivalent antioxidant capacity assay-TEAC). The chemical characterization of the extract, performed by 1D and 2D NMR spectroscopy, highlighted the presence of free, saturated (SAFAs), unsaturated (UFAs) and polyunsaturated (PUFAs) fatty acids. The high content of ω-6 and ω-3 PUFAs confirmed also by gas chromatography indicates the potentiality of this algal species in the production of fortified food. The antibacterial activity seems related to the presence of linolenic acid present at high density, while the antioxidant activity could be likely ascribable to molecules such as carotenoids and chlorophylls (characterized also by thin-layer chromatography), known for this property. The presence of polyhydroxybutyrate, a biopolymer with potentiality in the field of biodegradable bioplastics was also detected. The exploitation of C. linum for a future biotechnological application is also encouraged by the results from a first attempt of cultivating this species in an integrated multi-trophic aquaculture (IMTA) system.",Effect of Protein Denaturation and Enzyme Inhibitors on Proteasomal-Mediated Production of Peptides in Human Embryonic Kidney Cells.,https://www.ncbi.nlm.nih.gov/pubmed/31142026,Biomolecules,2019 05 30,"Peptides produced by the proteasome have been proposed to function as signaling molecules that regulate a number of biological processes. In the current study, we used quantitative peptidomics to test whether conditions that affect protein stability, synthesis, or turnover cause changes in the levels of peptides in Human Embryonic Kidney 293T (HEK293T) cells. Mild heat shock (42 °C for 1 h) or treatment with the deubiquitinase inhibitor b-AP15 led to higher levels of ubiquitinated proteins but did not significantly increase the levels of intracellular peptides. Treatment with cycloheximide, an inhibitor of protein translation, did not substantially alter the levels of intracellular peptides identified herein. Cells treated with a combination of epoxomicin and bortezomib showed large increases in the levels of most peptides, relative to the levels in cells treated with either compound alone. Taken together with previous studies, these results support a mechanism in which the proteasome cleaves proteins into peptides that are readily detected in our assays (i.e., 6-37 amino acids) and then further degrades many of these peptides into smaller fragments.",Understanding the Factors and the Corresponding Interactions That Influence Construction Worker Safety Performance from a Competency-Model-Based Perspective: Evidence from Scaffolders in China.,https://www.ncbi.nlm.nih.gov/pubmed/31142025,International journal of environmental research and public health,2019 05 30,"Purpose: Construction workers' reactions to safety-related issues during operation vary from person to person due to their different occupational levels, which can be attributed to various influencing factors and their correspondingly complicated interactions. This research aims to propose an integrated framework to combine the concepts of these factors and provide a holistic interpretation of the interrelationship among them. Methods: Based on items that were mainly extracted from competency theory, exploratory factor analysis (EFA) and confirmatory factor analysis (CFA) were conducted to identify the critical factors from the data collected from 243 scaffolders on Wuhan Metro construction sites. The interactions among the identified factors were then analyzed, and the safety competency model was thus established with the use of structural equation modeling (SEM). Results: A total of 17 items were identified as critical to workers' safety competency, and these were further tested and attributed to four factors: (1) individual character and inclination; (2) self-adjustment and adaptability; (3) working attitudes; (4) safety-related operation qualification. Subsequent analysis showed that all the factors significantly contributed to one's safety competency, and individual character and inclination contributed most to the formation of one's ability, while the intermediating effects of self-adjustment and adaptability should not be neglected both in theoretical and practical terms. The resultant safety competency model consisting of these four factors was revealed to share a hierarchical structure with the classical competency model. Significance: This study provided an integrated theoretical framework and a set of modeling approaches to combine the related concepts and facilitate a greater understanding of construction safety in terms of workers' characteristics and behaviors. Practical implications: This study presented a tentative approach for assessing construction workers' safety competency, as well as emphasized to the managers and professionals the necessity of developing training systems to ensure workers are integrated into a crew in an appropriate and smooth manner. Limitations and Future Work: The volume and the scope of samples impeded the study from achieving a more generalized result and a more cost-efficient data collection approach is in need of development for a comprehensive and in-depth investigation.",Susceptibility Profiles of Helicoverpa armigera (Hübner) (Lepidoptera: Noctuidae) to Deltamethrin Reveal a Contrast between the Northern and the Southern Benin.,https://www.ncbi.nlm.nih.gov/pubmed/31142024,International journal of environmental research and public health,2019 05 30,"Helicoverpa armigera is an indigenous species in Africa and has been reported in the destruction of several crops in Benin. Management of H. armigera pest is mainly focused on the use of synthetic pyrethroids, which may contribute to resistance selection. This study aimed to screen the susceptibility pattern of field populations of H. armigera to deltamethrin in Benin. Relevant information on the type of pesticides used by farmers were gathered through surveys. Collected samples of Helicoverpa (F0) were reared to F1. F0 were subjected to morphological speciation followed by a confirmation using restriction fragment length polymorphism coupled with a polymerase chain reaction (RFLP-PCR). F1 (larvae) were used for insecticide susceptibility with deltamethrin alone and in the presence of the P450 inhibitor Piperonyl Butoxide (PBO). Deltamethrin and lambda-cyhalothrin were the most used pyrethroids in tomato and cotton farms respectively. All field-sampled Helicoverpa were found to be H. armigera. Susceptibility assays of H. armigera to deltamethrin revealed a high resistance pattern in cowpea (resistance factor (RF) = 2340), cotton (RF varying from 12 to 516) and tomato (RF=85) farms which is a concern for the control of this major polyphagous agricultural pest. There was a significant increase of mortality when deltamethrin insecticide was combined with piperonyl butoxide (PBO), suggesting the possible involvement of detoxification enzymes such as oxidase. This study highlights the presence of P450 induced metabolic resistance in H. armigera populations from diverse cropping systems in Benin. The recorded high levels of deltamethrin resistance in H. armigera is a concern for the control of this major agricultural pest in Benin as the country is currently embarking into economical expansion of cotton, vegetables and grain-legumes cropping systems.",Analysis of miRNAs Targeted Storage Regulatory Genes during Soybean Seed Development Based on Transcriptome Sequencing.,https://www.ncbi.nlm.nih.gov/pubmed/31142023,Genes,2019 05 30,"Soybeans are an important cash crop and are widely used as a source of vegetable protein and edible oil. MicroRNAs (miRNA) are endogenous small RNA that play an important regulatory role in the evolutionarily conserved system of gene expression. In this study, we selected four lines with extreme phenotypes, as well as high or low protein and oil content, from the chromosome segment substitution line (CSSL) constructed from suinong (SN14) and ZYD00006, and planted and sampled at three stages of grain development for small RNA sequencing and expression analysis. The sequencing results revealed the expression pattern of miRNA in the materials, and predicted miRNA-targeted regulatory genes, including 1967 pairs of corresponding relationships between known-miRNA and their target genes, as well as 597 pairs of corresponding relationships between novel-miRNA and their target genes. After screening and annotating genes that were targeted for regulation, five specific genes were identified to be differentially expressed during seed development and subsequently analyzed for their regulatory relationship with miRNAs. The expression pattern of the targeted gene was verified by Real-time Quantitative PCR (RT-qPCR). Our research provides more information about the miRNA regulatory network in soybeans and further identifies useful genes that regulate storage during soy grain development, providing a theoretical basis for the regulation of soybean quality traits.",Digital Attention-Related Augmented-Reality Game: Significant Correlation between Student Game Performance and Validated Clinical Measures of Attention-Deficit/Hyperactivity Disorder (ADHD).,https://www.ncbi.nlm.nih.gov/pubmed/31142022,"Children (Basel, Switzerland)",2019 05 30,"As many as half of school children with autism spectrum disorder (ASD) exhibit symptoms of attention-deficit/hyperactivity disorder (ADHD), resulting in marked negative academic, social, and behavioral outcomes. The focus of the US Food and Drug Administration (FDA) on real-world data from novel digital sources, and the emergence of Current Procedural Terminology (CPT) codes to reimburse for digital monitoring and neurobehavioral testing suggest an increasing acceptance of the role of technology in augmenting clinical care and research. Empowered Brain is an augmented reality and artificial intelligence-based social-emotional communication aid for students with ASD. In this study, student performance on Empowered Brain is correlated to validated clinical measures of ADHD. Seven high school students with a diagnosis of ASD were recruited from a public high school. All students were assessed for severity of ADHD-related symptoms via three clinical gold-standard assessments, namely the Aberrant Behavioral Checklist (ABC), Social Responsiveness Scale 2 (SRS-2), and Teacher Report Form (TRF). Students used Empowered Brain over a one-week period. We measured the correlation of student in-game performance (as measured by point- and star-based rewards) relative to the hyperactivity subscale of the ABC (ABC-H), and the ADHD-subscale of the TRF. All seven students completed the study and managed to successfully use Empowered Brain. Students received a culminative total of 32 sessions, an average of 4.6 sessions per student (range 2-8). Student in-game performance demonstrated highly significant correlation relative to ABC-H (points: p = 0.0013; stars: p = 0.0013)., and significant correlation to TRF ADHD scores (points: p = 0.012; stars: p = 0.012). No adverse effects were noted among students who used Empowered Brain. New technologies may herald novel ways of identifying and characterizing symptoms of ADHD in student populations. This study provides evidence that Empowered Brain in-game performance correlates with ADHD symptom severity in students with ASD. Larger samples are required to validate these findings, with more diverse participants that can also widen the generalizability of these findings to a broader range of brain conditions that manifest with inattention, impulsivity, and hyperactivity. Through further research, we may find that such technologies can help us to identify and longitudinally monitor such symptoms, and potentially aid in severity stratification and digital phenotyping.","Lipid Metabolism and Endocrine Resistance in Prostate Cancer, and New Opportunities for Therapy.",https://www.ncbi.nlm.nih.gov/pubmed/31142021,International journal of molecular sciences,2019 05 30,"Prostate cancer (PCa) is the most common cancer in men, and more than 10% of men will be diagnosed with PCa during their lifetime. Patients that are not cured with surgery or radiation are largely treated with endocrine therapies that target androgens or the androgen receptor (AR), a major driver of PCa. In response to androgen deprivation, most PCas progress to castrate resistant PCa, which is treated with anti-androgens like enzalutamide, but tumors still progress and become incurable. Thus, there is a critical need to identify cellular pathways that allow tumors to escape anti-androgen therapies. Epidemiological studies suggest that high-fat diets play important roles in PCa progression. Lipid metabolism rewires the PCa metabolome to support growth and resistance to endocrine therapies, although the exact mechanisms remain obscure. Therapeutic effects have been observed inhibiting several aspects of PCa lipid metabolism: Synthesis, uptake, and oxidation. Since AR remains a driver of PCa in advanced disease, strategies targeting both lipid metabolism and AR are starting to emerge, providing new opportunities to re-sensitize tumors to endocrine therapies with lipid metabolic approaches."

In these assays, acacetin had consistently higher IC50 values than isoginkgetin. Subsequently, the acacetin was incubated with 4-methoxy-2,2,6,6-tetramethylpiperidine-1-oxy radicals (4-methoxy-TEMPO) and then analyzed by ultra-performance liquid chromatography coupled with electrospray ionization quadrupole time-of-flight tandem mass spectrometry (UHPLC-ESI-Q-TOF-MS) technology. The results of the UHPLC-ESI-Q-TOF-MS analysis suggested the presence of a dimer with m/z 565, 550, 413, 389, 374, 345, 330, and 283 peaks. By comparison, standard isoginkgetin yielded peaks at m/z 565, 533, 518, 489, 401, 389, 374, and 151 in the mass spectra. Based on these experimental data, MS interpretation, and the relevant literature, we concluded that isoginkgetin had higher electron transfer potential than its monomer because of the 3',8″-dimerization. Additionally, acacetin can produce a dimer during its antioxidant process; however, the dimer is not isoginkgetin.",Human Osteoblast Cell Behaviour on Titanium Discs Treated with Argon Plasma.,https://www.ncbi.nlm.nih.gov/pubmed/31142007,"Materials (Basel, Switzerland)",2019 05 30,"(1) Background. Titanium is characterized by its biocompatibility and resistance to stress and fatigue. Treatment with argon plasma may favour growth of human osteoblasts with respect to cell adhesion and proliferation. The aim of this study was to analyse the behaviour of human osteoblasts (MG-63) on Grade IV and V titanium possessing a sand-blasted, acid-etched (SLA) surface. SLA is a widely used surface treatment to create micro- and macroretentions to enhance osteoconductive properties on the surface. (2) Methods. One group of each grade of titanium was decontaminated with argon plasma and compared. On each disc, 20 × 104 cells were cultivated for morphological analysis, study of cell viability (regarding a negative control [100% viability]) and mitochondrial energy balance. (3) Results. At 24 h titanium treated with SLA showed a higher percentage of cell viability (47.3 ± 8.1%) compared to titanium IV treated with argon plasma, which presented a percentage of 79.1 ± 1.1%. Grade V titanium treated with argon plasma presented a higher viability percentage 91.3 ± 3.0% whereas nontreated Grade V titanium presented 53.3 ± 4.0%. Cells cultivated on the surfaces with an argon-plasma treatment were enlarged in comparison to non-treated discs. The cells with smaller circularity with a greater spread and spindle shape were the ones cultivated on the Grade V titanium surface. Cells seeded on treated titanium IV and titanium V, treated or not, showed higher mitochondrial activity over nontreated titanium IV. (4) Conclusions. Cells cultivated on those Grade V titanium discs that were decontaminated with argon plasma presented higher levels of cell adhesion and proliferation, lower mitochondrial damage and a higher mean cell area compared to those not decontaminated with argon plasma.",ConvNet and LSH-Based Visual Localization Using Localized Sequence Matching.,https://www.ncbi.nlm.nih.gov/pubmed/31142006,"Sensors (Basel, Switzerland)",2019 05 30,"Convolutional Network (ConvNet), with its strong image representation ability, has achieved significant progress in the computer vision and robotic fields. In this paper, we propose a visual localization approach based on place recognition that combines the powerful ConvNet features and localized image sequence matching. The image distance matrix is constructed based on the cosine distance of extracted ConvNet features, and then a sequence search technique is applied on this distance matrix for the final visual recognition. To speed up the computational efficiency, the locality sensitive hashing (LSH) method is applied to achieve real-time performances with minimal accuracy degradation. We present extensive experiments on four real world data sets to evaluate each of the specific challenges in visual recognition. A comprehensive performance comparison of different ConvNet layers (each defining a level of features) considering both appearance and illumination changes is conducted. Compared with the traditional approaches based on hand-crafted features and single image matching, the proposed method shows good performances even in the presence of appearance and illumination changes.","Associations of Cognitive Function with BMI, Body Fat Mass and Visceral Fat in Young Adulthood.",https://www.ncbi.nlm.nih.gov/pubmed/31142005,"Medicina (Kaunas, Lithuania)",2019 05 30,"Background and objectives: Existing studies concerning the associations of cognitive function with adiposity in young adults are sparse. The purpose of the study was to examine the associations of adiposity with cognitive control in young adults. Materials and Methods: Participants were 213 young adults (98 women and 115 men). Cognitive control was measured using a modified task-switching paradigm. Anthropometrics were measured by standardized procedures. Body fat mass and visceral fat area were measured by bioelectrical impedance analysis. Results: The results showed that increased body mass index (BMI, p = 0.02), body fat percentage (p = 0.02), and visceral fat area (p = 0.01) were significantly correlated with larger global switch costs of accuracy in women. In men, high levels of body fat percentage (p = 0.01) and visceral fat area (p = 0.03) were significantly correlated with larger local switch costs of reaction time. Conclusions: The results indicated that elevated adiposity was associated with worse performance on measures of cognitive control in young adults.","Illegitimate and Repeated Genomic Integration of Cell-Free Chromatin in the Aetiology of Somatic Mosaicism, Ageing, Chronic Diseases and Cancer.",https://www.ncbi.nlm.nih.gov/pubmed/31142004,Genes,2019 05 30,"Emerging evidence suggests that an individual is a complex mosaic of genetically divergent cells. Post-zygotic genomes of the same individual can differ from one another in the form of single nucleotide variations, copy number variations, insertions, deletions, inversions, translocations, other structural and chromosomal variations and footprints of transposable elements. High-throughput sequencing has led to increasing detection of mosaicism in healthy individuals which is related to ageing, neuro-degenerative disorders, diabetes mellitus, cardiovascular diseases and cancer. These age-related disorders are also known to be associated with significant increase in DNA damage and inflammation. Herein, we discuss a newly described phenomenon wherein the genome is under constant assault by illegitimate integration of cell-free chromatin (cfCh) particles that are released from the billions of cells that die in the body every day. We propose that such repeated genomic integration of cfCh followed by dsDNA breaks and repair by non-homologous-end-joining as well as physical damage to chromosomes occurring throughout life may lead to somatic/chromosomal mosaicism which would increase with age. We also discuss the recent finding that genomic integration of cfCh and the accompanying DNA damage is associated with marked activation of inflammatory cytokines. Thus, the triple pathologies of somatic mosaicism, DNA/chromosomal damage and inflammation brought about by a common mechanism of genomic integration of cfCh may help to provide an unifying model for the understanding of aetiologies of the inter-related conditions of ageing, degenerative disorders and cancer.",Effects of Regulating Visitor Viewing Proximity and the Intensity of Visitor Behaviour on Little Penguin (Eudyptula minor) Behaviour and Welfare.,https://www.ncbi.nlm.nih.gov/pubmed/31142003,Animals : an open access journal from MDPI,2019 05 30,"We examined the effects of regulating the viewing proximity of visitors and the intensity of visitor behaviour on behaviours indicative of fear and stress physiology of 15 zoo-housed little penguins (Eudyptula minor). A 2 × 2 factorial fully randomised design was used to examine the effects of regulating: 1) the viewing proximity of visitors to enclosure, 'normal viewing distance' and 'increased viewing distance' (using a physical barrier set up 2 m away from the enclosure), and 2) the intensity of visitor behaviour, 'unregulated visitor behaviour' and 'regulated visitor behaviour' (using signage and uniformed personnel). In addition, a treatment consisting of closing the enclosure to visitors was included. Penguin behaviour, visitor numbers and visitor behaviour were recorded by CCTV video recordings and direct observations, respectively. Penguin faecal glucocorticoid metabolites were also analysed as a measure of stress physiology. We found that increased viewing distance reduced (p < 0.05) all visitor behaviours except for loud vocalisations and tactile contact with penguins. However, there were no direct effects of signage and uniformed personnel on visitor behaviour (p > 0.05). As the regulation of viewing proximity increased from a closed exhibit to an open exhibit with increased viewing distance, and then to an open exhibit with normal viewing distance, this increased the proportion of penguins huddling (p = 0.0011), vigilant (p = 0.0060) and retreating (p = 0.00013), and decreased the proportion of penguins within 1 m of the visitor viewing area (p = 0.00066), surface swimming (p = 0.00091) and preening in the water (p = 0.042). There were also limited effects of regulating visitor behaviour on penguin behaviour. No treatment effects were found on faecal glucocorticoid metabolites (p > 0.05). These results indicate that regulating visitor viewing proximity affects penguin behaviours indicative of fear and visitor behaviour. This suggests that close visitor contact can be fear-provoking for little penguins but increasing the distance between visitors and penguins can reduce fear responses of penguins by regulating both viewing proximity and visitor behaviour. However, it is unclear whether these changes in penguin behaviour are due to the increased separation between visitors and penguins and/or specific visitor behaviours associated with close viewing proximity to the enclosure, such as leaning over the enclosure or tactile contact with the pool, which are impeded when visitors are further away.",Enhanced Homing of Mesenchymal Stem Cells Overexpressing Fibroblast Growth Factor 21 to Injury Site in a Mouse Model of Traumatic Brain Injury.,https://www.ncbi.nlm.nih.gov/pubmed/31142002,International journal of molecular sciences,2019 05 30,"Mesenchymal stem cells (MSCs) are emerging as a potential therapeutic intervention for brain injury due to their neuroprotective effects and safe profile. However, the homing ability of MSCs to injury sites still needs to be improved. Fibroblast Growth Factor 21 (FGF21) was recently reported to enhance cells migration in different cells type. In this study, we investigated whether MSCs that overexpressing FGF21 (MSC-FGF21) could exhibit enhanced homing efficacy in brain injury. We used novel Molday IONEverGreen™ (MIEG) as cell labeling probe that enables a non-invasive, high-sensitive and real-time MRI tracking. Using a mouse model of traumatic brain injury (TBI), MIEG labeled MSCs were transplanted into the contralateral lateral ventricle followed by real-time MRI tracking. FGF21 retained MSC abilities of proliferation and morphology. MSC-FGF21 showed significantly greater migration in transwell assay compared to control MSC. MIEG labeling showed no effects on MSCs' viability, proliferation and differentiation. Magnetic resonance imaging (MRI) revealed that FGF21 significantly enhances the homing of MSC toward injury site. Histological analysis further confirmed the MRI findings. Taken together, these results show that FGF21 overexpression and MIEG labeling of MSC enhances their homing abilities and enables non-invasive real time tracking of the transplanted cells, provides a promising approach for MSC based therapy and tracking in TBI.",Perspectives of Stakeholders on Technology Use in the Care of Community-Living Older Adults with Dementia: A Systematic Literature Review.,https://www.ncbi.nlm.nih.gov/pubmed/31141999,"Healthcare (Basel, Switzerland)",2019 05 30,"Although technology has the potential to promote aging in place, the use of technology remains scarce among community-living older adults with dementia. A reason might be that many stakeholders are involved who all have a different perspective on technology use (i.e., needs, wishes, attitudes, possibilities, and difficulties). We systematically searched the literature in order to provide an overview of perspectives of different stakeholders on technology use among community-living older adults with dementia. After selection, 46 studies were included. We mainly found perspectives of informal caregivers and, to a lesser extent, of persons with dementia and formal caregivers. Perspectives of suppliers of technology were not present. Shared perspectives among persons with dementia and informal and formal caregivers were, among other things, ease of use, stability and flexibility of technology, importance of privacy, and confidentiality. We also found that among older persons, fun and pleasure, in addition to enhancing freedom and independence, facilitates technology use. Informal caregivers' peace of mind and relief of burden also appeared to be important in using technologies. Formal caregivers value the potential of technologies to improve monitoring and communication. Insight in shared, and conflicting perspectives of stakeholders are essential to enhance the use of technology.",Differential Plasma Expression Profiles of Long Non-Coding RNAs Reveal Potential Biomarkers for Systemic Lupus Erythematosus.,https://www.ncbi.nlm.nih.gov/pubmed/31141998,Biomolecules,2019 05 30,"Identify long non-coding RNAs (lncRNAs) that might serve as biomarkers for systemic lupus erythematosus (SLE) and explore the biological functions of the identified lncRNAs. In the screening phase, we examined the lncRNA expression profile of plasma samples from 24 patients with SLE and 12 healthy controls (HCs) using lncRNA microarray with pooled samples. The candidate lncRNAs were verified in individual samples by quantitative real-time (qRT)-PCR. In the independent validation stage, the identified lncRNAs were evaluated in 240 patients with SLE and 120 HCs. The identified lncRNAs were assessed further in an external validation stage including patients with rheumatoid arthritis (RA) and primary Sjögren's syndrome (pSS). In addition, we constructed correlated expression networks including coding-non-coding co-expression and competing endogenous RNAs (ceRNAs). Plasma levels of linc0597, lnc0640, and lnc5150 were elevated in SLE patients compared with those of HCs, whereas levels of GAS5 and lnc7074 were decreased. Five lncRNAs were identified as potential SLE biomarkers with an area under the receiver operating characteristic curve (AUC) ranging from 0.604 to 0.833 in the independent validation phase. This panel of five lncRNAs had high diagnostic accuracy for SLE (AUC = 0.966) and distinguished SLE from RA and pSS (AUC = 0.683 and 0.910, respectively). Co-expression analysis showed that GAS5, lnc0640, and lnc5150 may participate in the SLE pathogenesis through the MAPK pathway. The ceRNA network indicated that GAS5, lnc0640, lnc3643, lnc6655, and lnc7074 bind competitively with microRNAs regulating the expression of target genes. Aberrant expression and related pathways suggest the important role of lncRNAs in SLE pathogenesis. In addition, the panel of five lncRNAs (GAS5, lnc7074, linc0597, lnc0640, and lnc5150) in plasma could be used as SLE biomarkers.",Evaluation of Antibiotics Residues in Chicken Meat Samples in Lebanon.,https://www.ncbi.nlm.nih.gov/pubmed/31141997,"Antibiotics (Basel, Switzerland)",2019 05 30,"Antibiotic residue in chicken is a human health concern due to its harmful effects on consumer health.

An optimized multi-class method for identification and quantification of 30 antibiotics from four different chemical classes (sulfonamides, tetracyclines, quinolones, and beta-lactams) has been developed by using liquid chromatography-mass spectrometry. The evaluation of antibiotics residues in 80 chicken muscles samples has shown that 77.5% of samples were at least contaminated with antibiotics residues, out of which 53.75% were exposed to co-occurrence of multidrug residues. The screening of the four antibiotics families has shown that ciprofloxacin (quinolones) represents the highest occurrence percentage (32.5%), followed by amoxicillin (β-lactams) (22.5%) and then tetracyclines (17.5%). Means of sarafloxacin, amoxicillin, and penicillin G residues levels were above the Maximum Residue Limit (MRL) recommended limit according to the European Union EC. This study revealed that chicken samples collected from Lebanese farms contain antibiotic residues.

We obtained 600 and 1785 differentially expressed genes in GK rats compared to those Wistar rats at three and four weeks of age, respectively. Specifically, Tbc1d4, involved in glucose uptake, was significantly downregulated in the skeletal muscle of GK aged both three and four weeks compared to those of age-matched Wistar rats. Pdk4, related to glucose uptake and oxidation, was significantly upregulated in the skeletal muscle of GK aged both three and four weeks compared to that of age-matched Wistar rats. Genes (Acadl, Acsl1 and Fabp4) implicated in fatty acid oxidation were significantly upregulated in the skeletal muscle of GK aged four weeks compared to those of age-matched Wistar rats. The overexpression or knockout of Tbc1d4, Pdk4, Acadl, Acsl1 and Fabp4 has been reported to change glucose uptake and fatty acid oxidation directly in rodents. By taking the results of previous studies into consideration, we speculated that dysregulation of key dysregulated genes (Tbc1d4, Pdk4, Acadl, Acsl1 and Fabp4) may lead to a decrease in glucose uptake and oxidation, and an increase in fatty acid oxidation in GK skeletal muscle at three and four weeks, which may, in turn, contribute to postprandial hyperglycemia. Our research revealed transcriptome changes in GK skeletal muscle at three and four weeks. Tbc1d4, Acadl, Acsl1 and Fabp4 were found to be associated with early diabetes in GK rats for the first time, which may provide a new scope for pathogenesis of postprandial hyperglycemia.",Gastric Leptin and Tumorigenesis: Beyond Obesity.,https://www.ncbi.nlm.nih.gov/pubmed/31141984,International journal of molecular sciences,2019 05 30,"Leptin, an adipocyte-derived hormone and its receptor (ObR) expressed in the hypothalamus are well known as an essential regulator of appetite and energy expenditure. Obesity induces abundant leptin production, however, reduced sensitivity to leptin leads to the development of metabolic disorders, so called leptin resistance. The stomach has been identified as an organ that simultaneously expresses leptin and ObR. Accumulating evidence has shown gastric leptin to perform diverse functions, such as those in nutrient absorption and carcinogenesis in the gastrointestinal system, independent of its well-known role in appetite regulation and obesity. Overexpression of leptin and phosphorylated ObR is implicated in gastric cancer in humans and in murine model, and diet-induced obesity causes precancerous lesions in the stomach in mice. While the underlying pathomechanisms remain unclear, leptin signaling can affect gastric mucosal milieu. In this review, we focus on the significant role of the gastric leptin signaling in neoplasia and tumorigenesis in stomach in the context of hereditary and diet-induced obesity.","Multiple Antibiotic Resistance (MAR), Plasmid Profiles, and DNA Polymorphisms among Vibrio vulnificus Isolates.",https://www.ncbi.nlm.nih.gov/pubmed/31141983,"Antibiotics (Basel, Switzerland)",2019 05 30,"Sixty strains (n = 60) of Vibrio vulnificus were examined for their multiple antibiotic resistance (MAR) index, plasmid profiles, and DNA polymorphisms. Thirty-seven strains (n = 37) were isolated from cockles (Anadaragranosa) in Malaysia, while 23 (n = 23) isolates were isolated from clams (Mercenariamercenaria) in Qatar. All isolates were resistant to two or more of the antibiotics tested, with the most common resistances were demonstrated towards penicillin (93%), ampicillin (70%), cephalothin (65%), clindamycin (66%), vancomycin (64%), and erythromycin (51%). The antibiotic that experienced the least resistance was kanamycin (6%), and all isolates were susceptible to cefoperazone, streptomycin, and tetracycline. The MAR index for the V. vulnificus isolated from Malaysia and Qatar, possessed similar values which ranged from 0.2 to 0.7, respectively. Plasmid analysis demonstrated that 65% of V. vulnificus strains harbored plasmids, while 35% were not. Nineteen (P1-P19) plasmids profiles were observed. No specific cluster or group was observed although they were isolated from different sample sources and locations by phylogenetic analysis using GelCompar II software at an 80% similarity level. Results demonstrated the high MAR index and genomic heterogeneity of V. vulnificus, which are of great concern to the human health of those who have consumed cockles and clams from the study area.",Adsorptive Removal of Methylene Blue from Aquatic Environments Using Thiourea-Modified Poly(Acrylonitrile-co-Acrylic Acid).,https://www.ncbi.nlm.nih.gov/pubmed/31141981,"Materials (Basel, Switzerland)",2019 05 30,"The paper evaluates the adsorptive potential of thiourea-modified poly(acrylonitrile-co-acrylic acid), (TA-poly(AN-co-AA)) for the uptake of cationic methylene blue (MB) from aquatic environments via a batch system. TA-poly(AN-co-AA) polymer was synthesized through redox polymerization and modified with thiourea (TA) where thioamide groups were introduced to the surface. Fourier transform infrared (FT-IR) spectroscopy, scanning electron microscopy (SEM), CHNS and Zetasizer were used to characterize the physico-chemical and morphological properties of prepared TA-poly(AN-co-AA). Afterwards, it was confirmed that incorporation of thioamide groups was successful. The adsorption kinetics and equilibrium adsorption data were best described, respectively, by a pseudo-second-order model and Freundlich model. Thermodynamic analysis showed the exothermic and spontaneous nature of MB uptake by TA-poly(AN-co-AA). The developed TA-poly(AN-co-AA) polymer demonstrated efficient separation of MB dye from the aqueous solution and maintained maximum adsorption capacity after five regeneration cycles. The findings of this study suggested that synthesized TA-poly(AN-co-AA) can be applied successfully to remove cationic dyes from aquatic environments.",Cardiovascular Risk Factors and Their Association with Vitamin D Deficiency in Mexican Women of Reproductive Age.,https://www.ncbi.nlm.nih.gov/pubmed/31141980,Nutrients,2019 05 30,"Based on a nationally representative sample of young Mexican women aged 20 to 49 years (n = 3260), we sought to explore whether cardiovascular risk factors and acute myocardial infarction (AMI) were associated with vitamin D deficiency (VDD, defined as 25-OH-D <50 nmol/L). To this end, we obtained sociodemographic, serum and anthropometric data from the 2012 National Health and Nutrition Survey (ENSANUT 2012). Analyses were developed through logistic regression models adjusted for potential confounders. The prevalence of VDD was significantly higher in obese women (42.5%, 95% CI; 37.3-47.9) compared to women with a normal body mass index (29.9%, 95% CI; 23.5-37.1, p = 0.05), in those with high total cholesterol (TC) (45.6% 95% CI; 39.4-51.9) compared to those with normal TC levels (33.9%, 95% CI 30-38.1, p = 0.03), and in those with insulin resistance (IR) (44%, 95% CI; 36.9-51.7) or type 2 diabetes mellitus (T2DM) (58.6%, 95% CI 46.9-69.4) compared to those with normal glycemia (no insulin resistance: 34.7%, 95% CI; 30.9-38.8, p = 0.04 and no T2DM: 34.9%, 95% CI 31.4-38.6, p < 0.001). Utilizing individual models to estimate cardiovascular risk according to VDD, we found that the odds of being obese (odds ratio, OR: 1.53, 95% CI 1.02-2.32, p = 0.05), or having high TC levels (OR: 1.43, 95% CI; 1.05-2.01, p = 0.03), T2DM (OR: 2.64, 95% CI; 1.65-4.03, p < 0.001), or IR (OR: 1.48, 95% CI 1.04-2.10, p = 0.026) were significantly higher in women with VDD (p < 0.05). Odds were not statistically significant for overweight, high blood pressure, sedentarism, AMI, high serum concentration of triglycerides, homocysteine, or C-reactive protein models. In conclusion, our results indicate that young Mexican women with VDD show a higher prevalence of cardiovascular risk factors.",Frequent Usage of Convenience Stores is Associated with Low Diet Quality.,https://www.ncbi.nlm.nih.gov/pubmed/31141979,Nutrients,2019 05 30,"Previous studies have revealed that the density of convenience stores in the neighborhood was associated with chronic diseases. In Japan, convenience stores are more common, and it is thus more important to assess whether people use convenience stores than the density or availability of the convenience stores. In this cross-sectional study of patients with type 2 diabetes, the association between the usage of the convenience stores and dietary habits or the prevalence of hypertension was evaluated. Among the 206 men and 161 women in the study, 24 men and 9 women used convenience stores three or more times per week. Fruit and vegetable intake (men, 132 (102-191) vs. 192 (128-267) g/1000 kcal, p = 0.019; and women, 178 (132-207) vs. 239 (172-313) g/1000 kcal, p = 0.063) of patients who frequently use convenience stores was lower compared to those who did not.

Additionally, frequent usage of convenience stores was associated with the prevalence of hypertension after adjusting for covariates (5.01; 95% confidence interval, 1.12-22.50; p = 0.035). In conclusion, frequent usage of convenience stores is associated with low diet quality and the prevalence of hypertension.",Controlled Growth of LDH Films with Enhanced Photocatalytic Activity in a Mixed Wastewater Treatment.,https://www.ncbi.nlm.nih.gov/pubmed/31141978,"Nanomaterials (Basel, Switzerland)",2019 05 30,"Due to multiple charge transport pathways, adjustable layer spacing, compositional flexibility, low manufacturing cost, and absorption of visible light, layered double hydroxides (LDHs) are a promising material for wastewater treatment. In this study, LDH films and Fe-doped LDH films with different metal ions (Ni, Al, Fe) on the surface of conductive cloth were successfully prepared and applied for the photocatalytic degradation of wastewater containing methyl orange and Ag ions under visible-light irradiation. The chemical state of Fe ions and the composition of LDHs on methyl orange photodegradation were investigated. The experimental results showed that LDH films exhibited high photocatalytic activity. The photocatalytic activity of LDH films on methyl orange improved in the mixed wastewater, and the Fe-doped NiAl-LDH films exhibited best visible-light photocatalytic performance. The analysis showed that Ag ions in the mixed wastewater were reduced by the LDH films and subsequently deposited on the surface of the LDH films. The Ag nanoparticles acted as electron traps and promoted the photocatalytic activity of the LDH films on methyl orange. Thus, we have demonstrated that prepared LDH films can be used in the treatment of mixed wastewater and have broad application prospects in environmental remediation and purification processes.",Removal of Linear and Branched Alkylphenols with the Combined Use of Polyphenol Oxidase and Chitosan.,https://www.ncbi.nlm.nih.gov/pubmed/31141977,Polymers,2019 05 30,"Removal of linear and branched alkylphenols with different alkyl chain lengths or different branchings (normal, secondary, and tertiary), some of which are suspected as endocrine disrupting chemicals, from an aqueous medium were investigated through quinone oxidation by polyphenol oxidase (PPO) and subsequent quinone adsorption on chitosan beads or powders at pH 7.0 and 40 °C. PPO-catalyzed quinone oxidation increased with an increase in alkyl chain length of the alkylphenols used. Although a higher PPO dose was required for quinone oxidation of branched alkylphenols, they were completely or mostly removed by quinone adsorption on chitosan beads or powders. The apparent activity of PPO increased by a decrease in quinone concentration. On the other hand, in the homogeneous systems with solutions of chitosan and PPO at pH 6.0, longer reaction times were required to generate insoluble aggregates, and a small amount of quinone derivatives were left in the solution even under optimum conditions. These results support that the two-step reaction, that is, PPO-catalyzed quinone oxidation and subsequent quinone adsorption on chitosan beads or powders, in the heterogeneous system is a good procedure for removing linear and branched alkylphenols from aqueous medium.",Optimal Design of Shape Memory Alloy Compositeunder Deflection Constraint.,https://www.ncbi.nlm.nih.gov/pubmed/31141976,"Materials (Basel, Switzerland)",2019 05 30,"Shape-adaptive or morphing capability in both aerospace structures and wind turbineblade design is regarded as significant to increase aerodynamic performance and simplifymechanisms by reducing the number of moving parts.

An understanding of drought tolerance mechanisms offers guidance for cultivar improvement. In order to understand how a well-known wheat genotype Jinmai 47 responds to drought, we adopted the iTRAQ and LC/MS approaches and conducted proteomics analysis of leaves after exposure to 20% of polyethylene glycol-6000 (PEG)-induced stress for 4 days. The study identified 176 differentially expressed proteins (DEPs), with 65 (36.5%) of them being up-regulated, and 111 (63.5%) down-regulated. DEPs, located in cellular membranes and cytosol mainly, were involved in stress and redox regulation (51), carbohydrate and energy metabolism (36), amino acid metabolism (24), and biosynthesis of other secondary metabolites (20) primarily. Under drought stress, TCA cycle related proteins were up-regulated. Antioxidant system, signaling system, and nucleic acid metabolism etc. were relatively weakened. In comparison, the metabolism pathways that function in plasma dehydration protection and protein structure protection were strongly enhanced, as indicated by the improved biosynthesis of 2 osmolytes, sucrose and Proline, and strongly up-regulated protective proteins, LEA proteins and chaperones. SUS4, P5CSs, OAT, Rab protein, and Lea14-A were considered to be important candidate proteins, which deserve to be further investigated."

A simple and sensitive liquid chromatography-tandem mass spectrometry (LC-MS/MS) method was developed and validated for the quantification of desoxo-narchinol A in two different biological matrices, i.e., rat plasma and mouse plasma, using sildenafil as an internal standard (IS). The method involved simple protein precipitation with acetonitrile and the analyte was separated by gradient elution using 100% acetonitrile and 0.1% formic acid in water as a mobile phase. The MS detection was performed with a turbo electrospray in positive ion mode. The lower limit of quantification was 10 ng/mL in both rat and mouse plasma. Intra- and inter-day accuracies were in the ranges of 97.23-104.54% in the rat plasma and 95.90-110.11% in the mouse plasma. The precisions were within 8.65% and 6.46% in the rat and mouse plasma, respectively. The method was applied to examine the pharmacokinetics of desoxo-narchinol A, and the oral bioavailability of desoxo-narchinol A was 18.1% in rats and 28.4% in mice.

Fructose intake and relative abundance (RA) of Lactobacillus reuteri (L. reuteri) in the intestinal microbiota are associated with obesity and diabetes in adults, but studies in children are limited. This study evaluates the association between fructose intake and L. reuteri RA with adiposity and cardiometabolic risk markers in Mexican children dietary information, microbiota profiles, adiposity indicators (Body Mass Index, BMI and Waste Circumference, WC), and cardiometabolic markers were analyzed in 1087 children aged 6-12 years. Linear regression and path analysis models were used. High-tertile fructose intake and L. reuteri RA were positively associated with BMI (βTertil 3 vs. Tertil 1= 0.24 (95% CI, 0.04; 0.44) and βT3 vs. T1 = 0.52 (95% CI, 0.32; 0.72)) and WC (βT3 vs. T1 = 2.40 (95% CI, 0.93; 3.83) and βT3 vs. T1 = 3.40 (95% CI, 1.95; 4.90)), respectively. Also, these factors mediated by adiposity were positively correlated with high triglycerides and insulin concentrations and HOMA-IR (p ≤ 0.03) and negatively associated with HDL-C concentration (p < 0.01). High-tertile fructose intake and L. reuteri RA were directly associated with adiposity and indirectly associated though adiposity with metabolic disorders in children.

The metallic NWs and their nanocomposites, as a promising alternative for conventional building materials, have been extensively studied recently, but review works on these novel versatile nanostructures and their various uses in the building and construction industry are still lacking. We present a comprehensive review on current state-of-the-art research and progress regarding multifunctional metallic NWs and their specific building applications, including thermal energy storage (TES), thermal transport, electrochromic windows (ECW), as well as photovoltaic (PV) cells. The nanosynthesis techniques and nanocharacterization of silver nanowires (AgNWs) and copper nanowires (CuNWs) are overviewed and compared with each other.

A study comparing the degree of difficulty among those procedures could serve as a guide for decision making in bariatric surgery and further improve training programs for general surgery trainees. The aim of this study was to compare the subjective level of technical difficulty of LSG, LRYGB, and OAGB-MGB as perceived by surgeons and surgical residents. Materials andMethods: An anonymous internet-based survey was designed to evaluate the subjective opinions of surgeons and surgical residents in training in Poland. It covered baseline characteristics of the participants, difficulty of LSG, OAGB-MGB, LRYGB and particular stages of each operation assessed on a 1-5 scale. Results: Overall, 70 surgeons and residents participated in our survey. The mean difficulty degree of LSG was 2.34 ± 0.89. The reinforcing staple line with sutures was considered most difficult stage of this operation (3.17 ± 1.19). The LRYGB operation had an average difficulty level of 3.87 ± 1.04. Creation of the gastrojejunostomy was considered the most difficult stage of LRYGB with a mean difficulty level (3.68 ± 1.16). Responders to our survey assessed the mean degree of difficulty of OAGB-MGB as 2.34 ± 0.97. According to participating surgeons, creating the gastrojejunostomy is the most difficult phase of this operation (3.68 ± 1.16). Conclusion: The LSG is perceived by surgeons as a relatively easy operation. The LRYGB was considered to be the most technically challenging procedure in our survey. Operative stages, which require intra-abdominal suturing with laparoscopic instruments, seem to be the most difficult phases of each operation.","Hiseq Base Molecular Characterization of Soil Microbial Community, Diversity Structure, and Predictive Functional Profiling in Continuous Cucumber Planted Soil Affected by Diverse Cropping Systems in an Intensive Greenhouse Region of Northern China.",https://www.ncbi.nlm.nih.gov/pubmed/31141960,International journal of molecular sciences,2019 05 30,"Cover crops are key determinants of the ecological stability and sustainability of continuous cropping soils. However, their agro-ecological role in differentially reshaping the microbiome structure and functioning under a degraded agroecosystem remains poorly investigated. Therefore, structural and metabolic changes in soil bacterial community composition in response to diverse plant species were assessed. Winter catch leafy vegetables crops were introduced as cover plants in a cucumber-fallow period. The results indicate that cover crop diversification promoted beneficial changes in soil chemical and biological attributes, which increased crop yields in a cucumber double-cropping system. Illumina high-throughput sequencing of 16S rRNA genes indicated that the bacterial community composition and diversity changed through changes in the soil properties. Principal component analysis (PCA) coupled with non-metric multidimensional scaling (NMDS) analysis reveals that the cover planting shaped the soil microbiome more than the fallow planting (FC). Among different cropping systems, spinach-cucumber (SC) and non-heading Chinese cabbage-cucumber (NCCC) planting systems greatly induced higher soil nutrient function, biological activity, and bacterial diversity, thus resulting in higher cucumber yield. Quantitative analysis of linear discriminant analysis effect size (LEfSe) indicated that Proteobacteria, Actinobacteria, Bacteroidetes, and Acidobacteria were the potentially functional and active soil microbial taxa. Rhizospheres of NCCC, leaf lettuce-cucumber (LLC), coriander-cucumber (CC), and SC planting systems created hotspots for metabolic capabilities of abundant functional genes, compared to FC. In addition, the predictive metabolic characteristics (metabolism and detoxification) associated with host-plant symbiosis could be an important ecological signal that provides direct evidence of mediation of soil structure stability. Interestingly, the plant density of non-heading Chinese cabbage and spinach species was capable of reducing the adverse effect of arsenic (As) accumulation by increasing the function of the arsenate reductase pathway. Redundancy analysis (RDA) indicated that the relative abundance of the core microbiome can be directly and indirectly influenced by certain environmental determinants. These short-term findings stress the importance of studying cover cropping systems as an efficient biological tool to protect the ecological environment. Therefore, we can speculate that leafy crop diversification is socially acceptable, economically justifiable, and ecologically adaptable to meet the urgent demand for intensive cropping systems to promote positive feedback between crop-soil sustainable intensification.","Effects of the Natural Peptide Crotamine from a South American Rattlesnake on Candida auris, an Emergent Multidrug Antifungal Resistant Human Pathogen.",https://www.ncbi.nlm.nih.gov/pubmed/31141959,Biomolecules,2019 05 30,"Invasive Candida infections are an important growing medical concern and treatment options are limited to a few antifungal drug classes, with limited efficacies depending on the infecting organism. In this scenario, invasive infections caused by multiresistant Candida auris are emerging in several places around the world as important healthcare-associated infections. As antimicrobial peptides (AMPs) exert their activities primarily through mechanisms involving membrane disruption, they have a lower chance of inducing drug resistance than general chemical antimicrobials. Interestingly, we previously described the potent candicidal effect of a rattlesnake AMP, crotamine, against standard and treatment-resistant clinical isolates, with no hemolytic activity. We evaluated the antifungal susceptibility of several Candida spp. strains cultured from different patients by using the Clinical and Laboratory Standards Institute (CLSI) microdilution assay, and the antifungal activity of native crotamine was evaluated by a microbial growth inhibition microdilution assay. Although all Candida isolates evaluated here showed resistance to amphotericin B and fluconazole, crotamine (40-80 µM) exhibited in vitro activity against most isolates tested. We suggest that this native polypeptide from the South American rattlesnake Crotalus durissus terrificus has potential as a structural model for the generation of a new class of antimicrobial compounds with the power to fight against multiresistant Candida spp.",Biotin-Avidin-Mediated Capture of Microspheres on Polymer Fibers.,https://www.ncbi.nlm.nih.gov/pubmed/31141958,"Molecules (Basel, Switzerland)",2019 05 30,"Systems for efficient and selective capture of micro-scale objects and structures have application in many areas and are of particular relevance for selective isolation of mammalian cells.

Fibrous poly(ethylene terephthalate) (PET) meshes were hydrolyzed under controlled alkaline conditions to obtain activated surfaces with COOH groups allowing for the functionalization of the PET with biotin of various spacer length. The system capture efficiency was optimized by varying the length of spacer presenting the biotin against streptavidin. In a proof of concept experiment, avidin-functionalized microspheres were used as surrogates for cells, and their capture under dynamic conditions including virous mixing and high-flow rate perfusion is demonstrated. Functionalization of PET meshes with biotin conjugated to longest spacer yielded the most efficient capture of microspheres. These preliminary results lay the foundation for the development of biosystems for capture of specific cells under physiologically relevant conditions, using biorthogonal avidin-biotin interactions.",Recent Progress in TRPM8 Modulation: An Update.,https://www.ncbi.nlm.nih.gov/pubmed/31141957,International journal of molecular sciences,2019 05 30,"The transient receptor potential melastatin subtype 8 (TRPM8) is a nonselective, multimodal ion channel, activated by low temperatures (<28 °C), pressure, and cooling compounds (menthol, icilin). Experimental evidences indicated a role of TRPM8 in cold thermal transduction, different life-threatening tumors, and other pathologies, including migraine, urinary tract dysfunction, dry eye disease, and obesity. Hence, the modulation of the TRPM8 channel could be essential in order to understand its implications in these pathologies and for therapeutic intervention. This short review will cover recent progress on the TRPM8 agonists and antagonists, describing newly reported chemotypes, and their application in the pharmacological characterization of TRPM8 in health and disease. The recently described structures of the TRPM8 channel alone or complexed with known agonists and PIP2 are also discussed.",Recent Advances in Inflammation and Treatment of Small Airways in Asthma.,https://www.ncbi.nlm.nih.gov/pubmed/31141956,International journal of molecular sciences,2019 05 30,"Small airways were historically considered to be almost irrelevant in the development and control of pulmonary chronic diseases but, as a matter of fact, in the past few years we have learned that they are not so ""silent"". Asthma is still a worldwide health issue due to the great share of patients being far from optimal management. Several studies have shown that the deeper lung inflammation plays a critical role in asthma pathogenesis, mostly in these not well-controlled subjects. Therefore, assessing the degree of small airways inflammation and impairment appears to be a pivotal step in the asthmatic patient's management. It is now possible to evaluate them through direct and indirect measurements, even if some obstacles still affect their clinical application. The success of any treatment obviously depends on several factors but reaching the deeper lung has become a priority and, for inhaled drugs, this is strictly connected to the molecule's size. The aim of the present review is to summarize the recent evidence concerning the small airway involvement in asthma, its physiopathological characteristics and how it can be evaluated in order to undertake a personalized pharmacological treatment and achieve a better disease control.",Clinical Applicability of a Textile 1-Lead ECG Device for Overnight Monitoring.,https://www.ncbi.nlm.nih.gov/pubmed/31141955,"Sensors (Basel, Switzerland)",2019 05 30,"Even for 1-lead electrocardiography (ECG), single-use gel conductive electrodes are employed in a clinical setting. However, gel electrodes show limited applicability for long-term monitoring due to skin irritation and detachment. In the present study, we investigated the validity of a textile ECG-belt suitable for long-term measurements in clinical use. In order to assess the signal quality and validity of the ECG-belt during sleep, 242 patients (186 males and 56 females, age 52 (interquartile range 42-60) years, body mass index 29 (interquartile range 26-33) kg·m-2) with suspected sleep apnoea underwent overnight polysomnography including standard 1-lead ECG recording. The single intervals between R-peaks (RR-intervals) were calculated from the ECG-signals. We found a mean difference for average RR-intervals of -2.9 ms, a standard error of estimate of 0.39%, as well as a Pearson r of 0.91. Furthermore, we found that the validity of the ECG-belt decreases when lying on the side, which was potentially due to the fitting of the belt. In conclusion, the validity of RR-interval measurements using the ECG-belt is high and it may be further improved for future applications by optimizing wear fitting."

They play a key role in the regulation of cellular processes such as genome integrity, chromatin organization, gene expression, translation regulation, and signal transduction. Recent studies indicated that lncRNAs are not only dysregulated in different types of diseases but also function as direct effectors or mediators for many pathological symptoms. This review focuses on the current findings of the lncRNAs and their dysregulated signaling pathways in senescence. Different functional mechanisms of lncRNAs and their downstream signaling pathways are integrated to provide a bird's-eye view of lncRNA networks in senescence. This review not only highlights the role of lncRNAs in cell fate decision but also discusses how several feedback loops are interconnected to execute persistent senescence response. Finally, the significance of lncRNAs in senescence-associated diseases and their therapeutic and diagnostic potentials are highlighted.",Associations of Neighborhood Walkability with Sedentary Time in Nigerian Older Adults.,https://www.ncbi.nlm.nih.gov/pubmed/31141942,International journal of environmental research and public health,2019 05 30,"Previous studies have investigated the potential role of neighborhood walkability in reducing sedentary behavior. However, the majority of this research has been conducted in adults and Western developed countries. The purpose of the present study was to examine associations of neighborhood environmental attributes with sedentary time among older adults in Nigeria. Data from 353 randomly-selected community-dwelling older adults (60 years and above) in Maiduguri, Nigeria were analyzed. Perceived attributes of neighborhood environments and self-reported sedentary time were assessed using Nigerian-validated and reliable measures. Outcomes were weekly minutes of total sedentary time, minutes of sitting on a typical weekday, and minutes of sitting on a typical weekend day. In multivariate regression analyses, higher walkability index, proximity to destinations, access to services, traffic safety, and safety from crime were associated with less total sedentary time and sedentary time on both a weekday and a weekend day. Moderation analysis showed that only in men was higher walking infrastructure and safety found to be associated with less sedentary time, and higher street connectivity was associated with more sedentary time. The findings suggest that improving neighborhood walkability may be a mechanism for reducing sedentary time among older adults in Nigeria.",Thymoquinone-Induced Tristetraprolin Inhibits Tumor Growth and Metastasis through Destabilization of MUC4 mRNA.,https://www.ncbi.nlm.nih.gov/pubmed/31141941,International journal of molecular sciences,2019 05 30,"Tristetraprolin (TTP), a well-characterized AU-rich element (ARE) binding protein, functions as a tumor suppressor gene. The purpose of this study was to investigate whether a bioactive substance derived from a natural medicinal plant affects the induction of TTP and to elucidate its mechanism. We examined the effects of natural bioactive materials including Resveratrol (RSV), thymoquinone (TQ) and curcumin on the expression of TTP in cancer cell. TQ derived from a natural plant Nigella sativa increased the expression levels of TTP mRNA and proteins in a dose-dependent manner in gastric and breast cancer cells. TQ-induced TTP increased the instability of MUC4 mRNA by direct binding of TTP to ARE in the 3'UTR of MUC4 mRNA. The induction of TTP by TQ also reduced the proliferation, migration and invasion of cancer cells. The expression of the epithelial-mesenchymal (EMT)-related genes, which were target genes of TTP, was also decreased by the TQ treatment. In the in vivo experiments using mouse melanoma cells, TQ-induced TTP inhibited metastasis of tumor cells. We have found that TQ-induced TTP might inhibit metastasis by reducing tumor cell migration and invasion through destabilization of MUC4 mRNA, which suggest the MUC4 as a novel target to TTP.",Antidepressant-Like Effect and Mechanism of Action of Honokiol on the Mouse Lipopolysaccharide (LPS) Depression Model.,https://www.ncbi.nlm.nih.gov/pubmed/31141940,"Molecules (Basel, Switzerland)",2019 05 30,"There is growing evidence that neuroinflammation is closely linked to depression. Honokiol, a biologically active substance extracted from Magnolia officinalis, which is widely used in traditional Chinese medicine, has been shown to exert significant anti-inflammatory effects and improve depression-like behavior caused by inflammation. However, the specific mechanism of action of this activity is still unclear. In this study, the lipopolysaccharide (LPS) mouse model was used to study the effect of honokiol on depression-like behavior induced by LPS in mice and its potential mechanism. A single administration of LPS (1 mg/kg, intraperitoneal injection) increased the immobility time in the forced swimming test (FST) and tail suspension test (TST), without affecting autonomous activity. Pretreatment with honokiol (10 mg/kg, oral administration) for 11 consecutive days significantly improved the immobility time of depressed mice in the FST and TST experiments. Moreover, honokiol ameliorated LPS-induced NF-κB activation in the hippocampus and significantly reduced the levels of the pro-inflammatory cytokines; tumor necrosis factor α (TNF-α), interleukin 1β (IL-1β), and interferon γ (IFN-γ). In addition, honokiol inhibited LPS-induced indoleamine 2,3-dioxygenase (IDO) activation and quinolinic acid (a toxic product) increase and reduced the level of free calcium in brain tissue, thereby inhibiting calcium overload. In summary, our results indicate that the anti-depressant-like effects of honokiol are mediated by its anti-inflammatory effects. Honokiol may inhibit the LPS-induced neuroinflammatory response through the NF-κB signaling pathway, reducing the levels of related pro-inflammatory cytokines, and furthermore, this may affect tryptophan metabolism and increase neuroprotective metabolites.",Encapsulation of Thermo-Sensitive Lauric Acid in Silica Shell: A Green Derivate for Chemo-Thermal Therapy in Breast Cancer Cell.,https://www.ncbi.nlm.nih.gov/pubmed/31141939,"Molecules (Basel, Switzerland)",2019 05 30,"Lauric acid is a green derivate that is abundant in some seeds such as coconut oil where it represents the most relevant fatty acid. Some studies have emphasized its anticancer effect due to apoptosis induction. In addition, the lauric acid is a Phase Change Material having a melting temperature of about 43.2 °C: this property makes it a powerful tool in cancer treatment by hyperthermal stress, generally induced at 43 °C. However, the direct use of lauric acid can have some controversial effects, and it can undergo degradation phenomena in the extracellular environment. For this reason, we have encapsulated lauric acid in a silica shell with a one-step and reproducible synthetic route in order to obtain a monodispersed SiO2@LA NPs with a good encapsulation efficiency. We have used these NPs to expose breast cancer cell lines (MCF-7) at different concentrations in combination with hyperthermal treatment. Uptake, viability, oxidative stress induction, caspases levels, and morphometric parameters were analyzed. These nanovectors showed double action in anticancer treatments thanks to the synergic effect of temperature and lauric acid activity.","Molecular Insights into FaEG1, a Strawberry Endoglucanase Enzyme Expressed during Strawberry Fruit Ripening.",https://www.ncbi.nlm.nih.gov/pubmed/31141938,"Plants (Basel, Switzerland)",2019 05 30,"The endo-β-1,4-glucanases (EGs) that belong to the glycosyl hydrolase family 9 (GH9) have roles in cell wall synthesis, remodeling and degradation. Previous studies have suggested that EGs may play a key role in the ripening of different fruits including strawberries. In this study, we used reverse-transcription quantitative polymerase chain reaction (RT-qPCR) assays to determine the transcript accumulation of an endo-β-1,4-glucanase (FaEG1) during fruit development in two different strawberry 'Camarosa' and 'Monterey' with contrasting softening ratios. Phylogenetic analyses suggest that FaEG1 belongs to the α group of the GH9 family with other proteins previously described with roles in elongation, abscission and ripening. Comparative modeling was used to obtain the FaEG1 structure. The model displays a α-barrel-type structure that is typical of the GH9 enzyme family, and comprises 12 α-helices, 2 310 helices and 6 β-sheets. The catalytic residues were oriented to the solvent in the middle of an open groove. Protein-ligand interactions were explored with cellulose and two xyloglucans as ligands; the results suggest that the FaEG1-cellulose and FaEG1-XXXGXXXG (the most abundant xyloglucan in strawberries) complexes were more stable complexes than XXFGXXFG. The cell wall degradation was observed by scanning electron microscopy (SEM). The data are congruent with the probable role of the FaEG1 protein in the dissembly of the cellulose-hemicellulose fraction during the ripening of strawberry fruit.",Effects of Long-Term Citrate Treatment in the PC3 Prostate Cancer Cell Line.,https://www.ncbi.nlm.nih.gov/pubmed/31141937,International journal of molecular sciences,2019 05 30,"Acute administration of a high level of extracellular citrate displays an anti-proliferative effect on both in vitro and in vivo models. However, the long-term effect of citrate treatment has not been investigated yet. Here, we address this question in PC3 cells, a prostate-cancer-derived cell line. Acute administration of high levels of extracellular citrate impaired cell adhesion and inhibited the proliferation of PC3 cells, but surviving cells adapted to grow in the chronic presence of 20 mM citrate. Citrate-resistant PC3 cells are significantly less glycolytic than control cells. Moreover, they overexpress short-form, citrate-insensitive phosphofructokinase 1 (PFK1) together with full-length PFK1. In addition, they show traits of mesenchymal-epithelial transition: an increase in E-cadherin and a decrease in vimentin. In comparison with PC3 cells, citrate-resistant cells display morphological changes that involve both microtubule and microfilament organization. This was accompanied by changes in homeostasis and the organization of intracellular organelles. Thus, the mitochondrial network appears fragmented, the Golgi complex is scattered, and the lysosomal compartment is enlarged. Interestingly, citrate-resistant cells produce less total ROS but accumulate more mitochondrial ROS than control cells. Consistently, in citrate-resistant cells, the autophagic pathway is upregulated, possibly sustaining their survival. In conclusion, chronic administration of citrate might select resistant cells, which could jeopardize the benefits of citrate anticancer treatment.",Porosity Distribution in Apically Perforated Curved Root Canals Filled with Two Different Calcium Silicate Based Materials and Techniques: A Micro-Computed Tomography Study.,https://www.ncbi.nlm.nih.gov/pubmed/31141936,"Materials (Basel, Switzerland)",2019 05 30,"The present study evaluated the porosity distribution of BioRoot RCS/single gutta-percha point (BR/SC) and MTA flow (MF) fillings, which were used as plugs for the apical perforation repair in curved canals of extracted mandibular molars using micro-computed tomography (μCT). Forty mesial root canals of mandibular first molars were shaped with ProTaper NEXT X1-X5 files 2 mm beyond the apex to simulate apical perforations that were randomly divided into two groups (n = 20) according to the material and technique used for the apical plug: BR/SC or MF. The specimens were scanned before and after canal filling at an isotropic resolution of 9.9 μm. The volumetric analysis of voids in the apical 5 mm of the fillings was performed. Data were analyzed using one-way ANOVA with Bonferroni correction (p < 0.05). Micro-computed tomography (µCT) evaluation revealed significant differences between the groups in terms of porosity: the total volume and percentage volume of voids was lower in the BR/SC group in comparison with the MF group (p < 0.05), with the predominance of open pores in both groups. Neither of the materials and/or application techniques were able to produce void-free root fillings in the apical region of artificially perforated curved roots of mandibular molars.",Consumption of Yogurt in Canada and Its Contribution to Nutrient Intake and Diet Quality Among Canadians.,https://www.ncbi.nlm.nih.gov/pubmed/31141935,Nutrients,2019 05 30,"The current study utilizes a nationally representative nutrition survey data (Canadian Community Health Survey 2015, nutrition component, n = 20,487) in order to evaluate patterns of yogurt consumption among Canadians. Overall, 20% of Canadians have reportedly consumed yogurt on a given day in 2015. Higher prevalence of yogurt consumption was noted among children aged 2-5 years old (47%) when compared to adults aged 19-54 years (18%). When the prevalence of yogurt consumption at the regional level in Canada was assessed, Quebec had the most consumers of yogurt (25%) compared to other regions, namely the Atlantic (19%), Ontario (18%), Prairies (19%) and British Columbia (20%). Yogurt consumers reported consuming higher daily intakes of several key nutrients including carbohydrates, fibre, riboflavin, vitamin C, folate, vitamin D, potassium, iron, magnesium, and calcium when compared to yogurt non-consumers. Additionally, the diet quality, measured using NRF 9.3 scoring method, was higher among yogurt consumers compared to non-consumers. Nearly 36% of Canadians who meet the dietary guidelines for milk and alternative servings from the Food Guide Canada (2007) reported consuming yogurt. Lastly, no significant difference in BMI was noted among yogurt consumers and non-consumers. Overall, yogurt consumers had a higher intake of key nutrients and had a better diet quality.",Epidemiological Study of Lung Cancer Incidence in Lebanon.,https://www.ncbi.nlm.nih.gov/pubmed/31141934,"Medicina (Kaunas, Lithuania)",2019 05 30,"Background and Objectives: Lung cancer (LC) is the most common cancer in the world. Developing countries in the Middle East and North Africa (MENA) region, including Lebanon, have witnessed a great increase in the incidence rates of this disease. The aim of our study is to investigate the incidence rates of lung cancer in Lebanon from 2005 to 2015 and to compare these rates to other countries from the MENA region and other regions of the world. Material and Methods: Lung cancer data for the years 2005-2015 were collected from the National Cancer Registry of Lebanon and stratified by gender and age group. Age-specific and age-standardized incidence rates were calculated and analyzed using joinpoint regression. Age-standardized incidence rates to the world population (ASR(w)) for other countries were obtained from two online databases. Results: Lung cancer ranked as the second most common cancer in Lebanon and accounted for 9.2% of all newly diagnosed cancers. Lung cancer ASR(w) showed a significantly increasing trend over the period studied for males and females. Lung cancer ASR(w) among males in Lebanon came second after Malta when compared to other MENA countries, but it was among the lowest when compared to non-MENA countries. For females, Lebanon ranked first when compared to other MENA countries but was among the lowest when compared to countries in other regions of the world. The lung cancer incidence rate increased with age in both sexes and 89.2% of patients were 50 years of age or older. Conclusion: Lebanon has the highest incidence of LC in females and the second highest for males in the MENA region. The lung cancer incidence rate is on the rise and older age groups are much more burdened by this disease than the young ones. Several risk factors, particularly smoking, play a role in increased LC incidence among the Lebanese population."

However, the success and popularity of point-of-care diagnosis lies with the generation of instantaneous and reliable results through in situ tests conducted in a painless, non-invasive manner. This work presents the development of a simple, hybrid integrated optical microfluidic biosensor for rapid detection of analytes in test samples. The proposed biosensor works on the principle of colorimetric optical absorption, wherein samples mixed with suitable chromogenic substrates induce a color change dependent upon the analyte concentration that could then be detected by the absorbance of light in its path length. This optical detection scheme has been hybrid integrated with an acoustofluidic micromixing unit to enable uniform mixing of fluids within the device. As a proof-of-concept, we have demonstrated the real-time application of our biosensor format for the detection of potassium in whole saliva samples. The results show that our lab-on-a-chip technology could provide a useful strategy in biomedical diagnoses for rapid analyte detection towards clinical point-of-care testing applications.",Milk Protein Fractionation by Means of Spiral-Wound Microfiltration Membranes: Effect of the Pressure Adjustment Mode and Temperature on Flux and Protein Permeation.,https://www.ncbi.nlm.nih.gov/pubmed/31141922,"Foods (Basel, Switzerland)",2019 05 30,"Protein fractionation by means of microfiltration (MF) is significantly affected by fouling, especially when spiral-wound membranes (SWMs) are used. We investigated the influence of the mode of transmembrane pressure (ΔpTM) increase to target level and the deposit layer pressure history on the filtration performance during skim milk MF at temperatures of 10 °C and 50 °C. Two filtration protocols were established: No. 1: ΔpTM was set directly to various target values. No. 2: Starting from a low ΔpTM, we increased and subsequently decreased ΔpTM stepwise. The comparison of both protocols tested the effect of the mode of ΔpTM increase to target level. The latter protocol alone tested the effect of the deposit layer history with regard to the ΔpTM. As expected, flux and protein permeation were both found to be functions of the ΔpTM. Further, both measures were independent of the filtration protocol as long as ΔpTM was held at a constant level or, as part of protocol No. 2, ΔpTM was increased. Thus, we can state that the mode of ΔpTM increase to target level does not affect filtration performance in SWM. We found that after completion of a full cycle of stepping ΔpTM up from 0.5 bar to 3.0 bar and back down, flux and deposit layer resistance were not affected by the deposit layer history at 10 °C, but they were at 50 °C. Protein permeation, however, was lower for both 10 °C and 50 °C, when the ΔpTM cycle was completed. The processing history had a significant impact on filtration performance due to remaining structural compression effects in the deposited layer, which occur most notably at higher temperatures. Furthermore, temperatures of 50 °C lead to deposit layer aging, which is probably due to an enhanced crosslinking of particles in the deposit layer. Apart from that, we could show that fouling resistance does not directly correlate with protein permeation during skim milk MF using SWM.",Untargeted Metabolomics to Evaluate the Stability of Extra-Virgin Olive Oil with Added Lycium barbarum Carotenoids during Storage.,https://www.ncbi.nlm.nih.gov/pubmed/31141920,"Foods (Basel, Switzerland)",2019 05 30,"A carotenoid-rich extract from Lycium barbarum L. was added to extra virgin olive oil (EVOO), obtaining a carotenoid-enriched oil (EVOOCar). The oxidative stability of EVOO and EVOOCar was evaluated during long-term storage of 28 weeks at room temperature, by measuring some classical parameters (acidity and peroxide values, spectrophotometric coefficients, fatty acid composition) and the content of minor compounds (i.e., α-tocopherol and lutein). At the end of the storage, higher content (p < 0.01) of α-tocopherol in EVOOCar in respect to EVOO were observed. Zeaxanthin dipalmitate, the most abundant carotenoid compound of Goji berries, decreased slightly (p < 0.05) in EVOOCar until the end of the storage. In regard to polyphenols, an ultra-high-performance liquid chromatography coupled to quadrupole time-of-flight mass spectrometry (UHPLC/QTOF-MS) using untargeted metabolomics was carried out. This latter approach discriminated the two oil samples during long-term storage, allowing to identify also the phenolic classes most exposed to significant variations during storage (i.e., mainly lignans and flavones). Besides, the addition of Goji carotenoids preserved the stability of tyrosol equivalents in EVOOCar during long-term storage. These results highlighted that the enrichment of EVOO with a carotenoid-rich extract can improve the shelf-life and nutritional value of added-oil, protecting EVOO natural antioxidants during long-term storage.",Hepatitis E Virus Drug Development.,https://www.ncbi.nlm.nih.gov/pubmed/31141919,Viruses,2019 05 30,"Hepatitis E virus (HEV) is an underestimated disease, leading to estimated 20 million infections and up to 70,000 deaths annually. Infections are mostly asymptomatic but can reach mortality rates up to 25% in pregnant women or become chronic in immunocompromised patients. The current therapy options are limited to the unspecific antivirals Ribavirin (RBV) and pegylated Interferon-α (pegIFN-α). RBV leads to viral clearance in only 80% of patients treated, and is, similar to pegIFN-α, contraindicated in the major risk group of pregnant women, emphasizing the importance of new therapy options. In this review, we focus on the urgent need and current efforts in HEV drug development. We provide an overview of the current status of HEV antiviral research.

The factors controlling the dynamic network formation and their properties were discussed. Evolution of structure during both dynamic nonequilibrium and isothermal equilibrium network formation/breaking was followed by monitoring the modulus and conversion of the monomer. The gelation, postgel growth, and properties of the thermoreversible networks from tetrafunctional furan (F4) and different bismaleimides (M2) were controlled by the structure of the maleimide monomer. The substitution of maleimides with alkyl (hexamethylene bismaleimide), aromatic (diphenyl bismaleimide), and polyether substituents affects differently the kinetics and thermodynamics of the thermoreversible DA reaction, and thereby the formation of dynamic networks. The gel-point temperature was tuned in the range Tgel = 97-122 °C in the networks of the same functionality (F4-M2) with different maleimide structure. Theory of branching processes was used to predict the structure development during formation of the dynamic networks and the reasonable agreement with the experiment was achieved. The experimentally inaccessible information on the sol fraction in the reversible network was received by applying the theory.

In 2017, the international consensus guidelines for the diagnosis and management of FPIES were published. They cover all aspects of this syndrome, which in recent decades has attracted the attention of pediatric allergists. In particular, the consensus proposed innovative diagnostic criteria. However, the diagnosis of acute FPIES is still currently discussed because the interest in this disease is relatively recent and, above all, there are no validated panels of diagnostic criteria. We propose some ideas for reflection on the diagnostic and suspicion criteria of acute FPIES with exemplary stories of children certainly or probably suffering from acute FPIES. For example, we believe that new definitions should be produced for mild forms of FPIES, multiple forms, and those with IgE-mediated symptoms. Moreover, we propose two clinical criteria to suspect acute FPIES and to refer the child to the diagnostic oral food challenge.","Hydration, Arginine Vasopressin, and Glucoregulatory Health in Humans: A Critical Perspective.",https://www.ncbi.nlm.nih.gov/pubmed/31141915,Nutrients,2019 05 30,"Glucoregulatory diseases, such as type 2 diabetes are currently a key public health priority. Public health messages have started to include the addition of water in their dietary guidelines. Such guidelines however are not based on causal evidence pertaining to the health effects of increased water intake, but rather more heavily based upon non-causal or mechanistic data. One line of thinking linking fluid intake and health is that hypohydration induces elevated blood concentrations of arginine vasopressin (AVP). Research in the 1970s and 1980s implicated AVP in glucoregulation, supported by observational evidence. This important area of research subsequently appeared to stop until the 21st century during which interest in hypertonic saline infusion studies, animal AVP receptor knockout models, dietary and genetic associations, and human interventions manipulating hydration status have resurged. This narrative review briefly describes and critically evaluates the usefulness of the current AVP-glucoregulatory research. We offer suggestions on how to test the independent glucoregulatory effects of body water changes compared to elevated circulating AVP concentrations, such as investigating hydration manipulations using 3,4-Methylenedioxymethamphetamine. Whilst much research is still needed before making firm conclusions, the current evidence suggests that although AVP may be partially implicated in glucoregulation, more ecologically valid models using human participants suggests this effect might be independent of the hydration status. The key implication of this hypothesis if confirmed in future research is that manipulating the hydration status to reduce circulating AVP concentrations may not be an effective method to improve glucoregulatory health.",Synthesis of Human Milk Oligosaccharides: Protein Engineering Strategies for Improved Enzymatic Transglycosylation.,https://www.ncbi.nlm.nih.gov/pubmed/31141914,"Molecules (Basel, Switzerland)",2019 05 30,"Human milk oligosaccharides (HMOs) signify a unique group of oligosaccharides in breast milk, which is of major importance for infant health and development. The functional benefits of HMOs create an enormous impetus for biosynthetic production of HMOs for use as additives in infant formula and other products. HMO molecules can be synthesized chemically, via fermentation, and by enzymatic synthesis. This treatise discusses these different techniques, with particular focus on harnessing enzymes for controlled enzymatic synthesis of HMO molecules. In order to foster precise and high-yield enzymatic synthesis, several novel protein engineering approaches have been reported, mainly concerning changing glycoside hydrolases to catalyze relevant transglycosylations. The protein engineering strategies for these enzymes range from rationally modifying specific catalytic residues, over targeted subsite -1 mutations, to unique and novel transplantations of designed peptide sequences near the active site, so-called loop engineering. These strategies have proven useful to foster enhanced transglycosylation to promote different types of HMO synthesis reactions. The rationale of subsite -1 modification, acceptor binding site matching, and loop engineering, including changes that may alter the spatial arrangement of water in the enzyme active site region, may prove useful for novel enzyme-catalyzed carbohydrate design in general.","The Effect of Consumer Involvement in Light Lamb Meat on Behavior, Sensory Perception, and Health-Related Concerns.",https://www.ncbi.nlm.nih.gov/pubmed/31141913,Nutrients,2019 05 30,"Involvement can explain behavioral consequences, such as consumer decision-making and consumption. The first aim of this study is to identify the profiles of consumers based on their involvement in light lamb meat. The second aim is to study the influence of involvement on consumers' attitudes, behaviors, beliefs, preferences, quality cues, and sensory perception regarding light lamb meat. Two consumer profiles are identified. The first cluster includes consumers who enjoyed eating light lamb meat, were conscious of their self-image, and perceived the consequences of poor choices; these consumers also perceived the probability of making an incorrect choice as high. The second cluster includes consumers who truly loved eating lamb meat, were also conscious of their self-image, and perceived the consequences of poor choices; however, these consumers were confident in not making incorrect choices. Although both involvement-based profiles showed high involvement in light lamb meat, it can be concluded that the second cluster had a higher involvement. In general, the involvement-based profiles did not influence health-related attitudes, preferences, or sensory perceptions of light lamb meat, while beliefs, behavior and quality cues were influenced by involvement.",Omega 3-DHA and Delta-Tocotrienol Modulate Lipid Droplet Biogenesis and Lipophagy in Breast Cancer Cells: the Impact in Cancer Aggressiveness.,https://www.ncbi.nlm.nih.gov/pubmed/31141912,Nutrients,2019 05 30,"Omega 3-docosahexaenoic acid (DHA) and vitamin E Delta-tocotrienol (Delta-T3) are extensively studied as protective nutrients against cancer development. Little is known about the biological mechanisms targeted by these bioactive molecules on lipid droplet (LD) biogenesis, an important breast cancer aggressiveness marker, and the occurrence of lipophagy in breast cancer cells. The aim of this study was to investigate the effect of DHA, Delta-T3 and DHA plus Delta-T3 co-treatment in LD biogenesis and lipophagy process in triple negative breast cancer cell line MDA-MB-231. Cells were treated with 50 μM DHA and/or 5 μM Delta-T3. Our results demonstrated that DHA can trigger an increase in LD biogenesis and co-treatment with Delta-T3 was able to reduce this LD biogenesis. In addition, we showed that a higher cytoplasmic LD content is associated with a higher breast cancer cells malignance and proliferation. Reduction of cytoplasmic LD content by silencing ADRP (adipose differentiation-related protein), a structural LD protein, also decreased cell proliferation in MDA-MB-231 cells. Treatment with DHA and Delta-T3 alone or co-treatment did not reduce cell viability. Moreover, we showed here that DHA can trigger lipophagy in MDA-MB-231 cells and DHA plus Delta-T3 co-treatment was able to enhance this lipophagy process. Our findings demonstrated that co-treatment with DHA plus Delta-T3 in MDA-MB-231 cells could reduce LD biogenesis and potentiate lipophagy in these cells, possibly having a positive impact to inhibit breast cancer malignancy. Therefore, suitable doses of DHA and Delta-T3 vitamin E isoform supplementation can be a prominent tool in therapeutic treatments against breast cancer."

However, no consensus exists on the best models to study these syndromes. Knowing that different diets can precipitate different metabolic disease phenotypes, herein we characterized several hypercaloric rat models of obesity and type 2 diabetes, comparing each with a genetic model, with the aim of identifying the most appropriate model of metabolic disease. The effect of hypercaloric diets (high fat (HF), high sucrose (HSu), high fat plus high sucrose (HFHSu) and high fat plus streptozotocin (HF+STZ) during different exposure times (HF 3 weeks, HF 19 weeks, HSu 4 weeks, HSu 16 weeks, HFHSu 25 weeks, HF3 weeks + STZ) were compared with the Zucker fatty rat. Each model was evaluated for weight gain, fat mass, fasting plasma glucose, insulin and C-peptide, insulin sensitivity, glucose tolerance, lipid profile and liver lipid deposition, blood pressure, and autonomic nervous system function. All animal models presented with insulin resistance and dyslipidemia except the HF+STZ and HSu 4 weeks, which argues against the use of these models as metabolic syndrome models. Of the remaining animal models, a higher weight gain was exhibited by the Zucker fatty rat and wild type rats submitted to a HF diet for 19 weeks. We conclude that the latter model presents a phenotype most consistent with that observed in humans with metabolic disease, exhibiting the majority of the phenotypic features and comorbidities associated with type 2 diabetes in humans.",Characterization and Efficient Management of Big Data in IoT-Driven Smart City Development.,https://www.ncbi.nlm.nih.gov/pubmed/31141899,"Sensors (Basel, Switzerland)",2019 05 30,"Smart city is an emerging initiative for integrating Information and Communication Technologies (ICT) in effective ways to support development of smart cities with enhanced quality of life for its citizens through safe and secure context-aware services. Major technical challenges to realize smart cities include resource use optimization, service delivery without interruption at all times in all aspects, minimization of costs, and reduction of resource consumption. To address these challenges, new techniques and technologies are required for modeling and processing the big data generated and used through the underlying Internet of Things (IoT). To this end, we propose a data-centric approach to IoT in conceptualizing the ""things"" from a service-oriented perspective and investigate efficient ways to identify, integrate, and manage big data. The data-centric approach is expected to better support efficient management of data with complexities inherent in IoT-generated big data. Furthermore, it supports efficient and scalable query processing and reasoning techniques required in development of smart city applications.

Various types of biomedical signals collected by different sensing channels provide different aspects of patient health information. However, due to the uncertainty and variability in clinical observation, not all the channels are relevant and important to the target task. Thus, in order to extract informative representations from multi-channel biosignals, channel awareness has become a key enabler for deep learning in biosignal processing and has attracted increasing research interest in health informatics. Towards this end, we propose FusionAtt-a deep fusional attention network that can learn channel-aware representations of multi-channel biosignals, while preserving complex correlations among all the channels. FusionAtt is able to dynamically quantify the importance of each biomedical channel, and relies on more informative ones to enhance feature representation in an end-to-end manner. We empirically evaluated FusionAtt in two clinical tasks: multi-channel seizure detection and multivariate sleep stage classification. Experimental results showed that FusionAtt consistently outperformed the state-of-the-art models in four different evaluation measurements, demonstrating the effectiveness of the proposed fusional attention mechanism.","Inhibitory Effects of a Novel Chrysin-Derivative, CPD 6, on Acute and Chronic Skin Inflammation.",https://www.ncbi.nlm.nih.gov/pubmed/31141897,International journal of molecular sciences,2019 05 30,"The skin is an important physiological barrier against external stimuli, such as ultraviolet radiation (UV), xenobiotics, and bacteria. Dermal inflammatory reactions are associated with various skin disorders, including chemical-induced irritation and atopic dermatitis. Modulation of skin inflammatory response is a therapeutic strategy for skin diseases. Here, we synthesized chrysin-derivatives and identified the most potent derivative of Compound 6 (CPD 6). We evaluated its anti-inflammatory effects in vitro cells of macrophages and keratinocytes, and in vivo dermatitis mouse models. In murine macrophages stimulated by lipopolysaccharide (LPS), CPD 6 significantly attenuated the release of inflammatory mediators such as nitric oxide (NO) (IC50 for NO inhibition: 3.613 μM) and other cytokines. In cultured human keratinocytes, CPD 6 significantly attenuated the release of inflammatory cytokines induced by the combination of IFN-γ and TNF-α, UV irradiation, or chemical irritant stimulation. CPD 6 inhibited NFκB and JAK2/STAT1 signaling pathways, and activated Nrf2/HO-1 signaling. In vivo relevancy of anti-inflammatory effects of CPD 6 was observed in acute and chronic skin inflammation models in mice. CPD 6 showed significant anti-inflammatory properties both in vitro cells and in vivo dermatitis animal models, mediated by the inhibition of the NFκB and JAK2-STAT1 pathways and activation of Nrf2/HO-1 signaling. We propose that the novel chrysin-derivative CPD 6 may be a potential therapeutic agent for skin inflammation.",Intrinsic Physical Unclonable Function (PUF) Sensors in Commodity Devices.,https://www.ncbi.nlm.nih.gov/pubmed/31141896,"Sensors (Basel, Switzerland)",2019 05 30,"The environment-dependent feature of physical unclonable functions (PUFs) is capable of sensing environment changes. This paper presents an analysis and categorization of a variety of PUF sensors. Prior works have demonstrated that PUFs can be used as sensors while providing a security authentication assurance. However, most of the PUF sensors need a dedicated circuit. It can be difficult to implemented in commercial off-the-shelf devices. This paper focuses on the intrinsic Dynamic Random Access Memory (DRAM) PUF-based sensors, which requires no modifications for hardware. The preliminary experimental results on Raspberry Pi have demonstrated the feasibility of our design. Furthermore, we configured the DRAM PUF-based sensor in a DRAM PUF-based key generation scheme which improves the practicability of the design.","Isolation of Subtype 3c, 3e and 3f-Like Hepatitis E Virus Strains Stably Replicating to High Viral Loads in an Optimized Cell Culture System.",https://www.ncbi.nlm.nih.gov/pubmed/31141895,Viruses,2019 05 30,"The hepatitis E virus (HEV) is transmitted via the faecal-oral route in developing countries (genotypes 1 and 2) or through contaminated food and blood products worldwide (genotypes 3 and 4). In Europe, HEV subtypes 3c, 3e and 3f are predominant. HEV is the leading cause of acute hepatitis globally and immunocompromised patients are particularly at risk. Because of a lack of cell culture systems efficiently propagating wild-type viruses, research on HEV is mostly based on cell culture-adapted isolates carrying uncommon insertions in the hypervariable region (HVR). While optimizing the cell culture system using the cell culture-adapted HEV strain 47832c, we isolated three wild-type strains derived from clinical specimens representing the predominant spectrum of HEV in Europe. The novel isolates 14-16753 (3c), 14-22707 (3e) and 15-22016 (3f-like) replicate to high viral loads of 108, 109 and 106.5 HEV RNA copies/mL at 14 days post-inoculation, respectively. In addition, they could be kept as persistently infected cell cultures with constant high viral loads (~109 copies/mL) for more than a year. In contrast to the latest isolates 47832c, LBPR-0379 and Kernow-C1, the new isolates do not carry genome insertions in the HVR. Optimization of HEV cell culture identified amphotericin B, distinct salts and fetal calf serum (FCS) as important medium supplements. Overconfluent cell layers increased infectivity and virus production. PLC/PRF/5, HuH-7-Lunet BLR, A549 and HepG2/C3A supported replication with different efficiencies. The novel strains and optimized cell culture system may be useful for studies on the HEV life cycle, inactivation, specific drug and vaccine development.",Preclinical Characteristics of the Irreversible Pan-HER Kinase Inhibitor Neratinib Compared with Lapatinib: Implications for the Treatment of HER2-Positive and HER2-Mutated Breast Cancer.,https://www.ncbi.nlm.nih.gov/pubmed/31141894,Cancers,2019 05 30,"An estimated 15-20% of breast cancers overexpress human epidermal growth factor receptor 2 (HER2/ERBB2/neu). Two small-molecule tyrosine kinase inhibitors (TKIs), lapatinib and neratinib, have been approved for the treatment of HER2-positive (HER2+) breast cancer. Lapatinib, a reversible epidermal growth factor receptor (EGFR/ERBB1/HER1) and HER2 TKI, is used for the treatment of advanced HER2+ breast cancer in combination with capecitabine, in combination with trastuzumab in patients with hormone receptor-negative metastatic breast cancer, and in combination with an aromatase inhibitor for the first-line treatment of HER2+ breast cancer. Neratinib, a next-generation, irreversible pan-HER TKI, is used in the US for extended adjuvant treatment of adult patients with early-stage HER2+ breast cancer following 1 year of trastuzumab. In Europe, neratinib is used in the extended adjuvant treatment of adult patients with early-stage hormone receptor-positive HER2+ breast cancer who are less than 1 year from the completion of prior adjuvant trastuzumab-based therapy. Preclinical studies have shown that these agents have distinct properties that may impact their clinical activity. This review describes the preclinical characterization of lapatinib and neratinib, with a focus on the differences between these two agents that may have implications for patient management.",Maintenance and Development of Social Connection by People with Long-term Conditions: A Qualitative Study.,https://www.ncbi.nlm.nih.gov/pubmed/31141893,International journal of environmental research and public health,2019 05 30,"Social connection is important for people's health and well-being. Social isolation arising from a lack of meaningful connection with others can result in deterioration of well-being with negative consequences for health. For people living with multiple long-term conditions, the building and maintaining of social connection may be challenging. The aim of this study was to explore with people with long-term conditions how they perceive they maintain and develop social connections. We undertook semi-structured interviews with seventeen adults, and analyzed the data for themes. Themes were ""Meaningful connection"", ""Wherewithal for social connection"" and ""Impact of a major change in life course"". The findings suggest that social connection is valued, and facilitates meaningful ways to reciprocate support with others, thus enabling access to knowledge and resources for better health and well-being. However, people with long-term conditions can experience challenges to developing and maintaining social connectedness after a major change in life course. We suggest that healthcare providers are well placed to facilitate ways for people with long-term conditions to socially connect with others in their neighbourhood and community, and that this in particular be attended to after a major life change.",The Use of Deep Learning to Predict Stroke Patient Mortality.,https://www.ncbi.nlm.nih.gov/pubmed/31141892,International journal of environmental research and public health,2019 05 30,"The increase in stroke incidence with the aging of the Korean population will rapidly impose an economic burden on society. Timely treatment can improve stroke prognosis. Awareness of stroke warning signs and appropriate actions in the event of a stroke improve outcomes. Medical service use and health behavior data are easier to collect than medical imaging data. Here, we used a deep neural network to detect stroke using medical service use and health behavior data; we identified 15,099 patients with stroke. Principal component analysis (PCA) featuring quantile scaling was used to extract relevant background features from medical records; we used these to predict stroke. We compared our method (a scaled PCA/deep neural network [DNN] approach) to five other machine-learning methods. The area under the curve (AUC) value of our method was 83.48%; hence; it can be used by both patients and doctors to prescreen for possible stroke.",Evaluation and Modeling of the Fatigue Damage Behavior of Polymer Composites at Reversed Cyclic Loading.,https://www.ncbi.nlm.nih.gov/pubmed/31141891,"Materials (Basel, Switzerland)",2019 05 30,"Understanding the composite damage formation process and its impact on mechanical properties is a key step towards further improvement of material and higher use. For its accelerated application, furthermore, practice-related modeling strategies are to be established. In this collaborative study, the damage behavior of carbon fiber-reinforced composites under cyclic loading with load reversals is analyzed experimentally and numerically. The differences of crack density evolution during constant amplitude and tension-compression block-loading is characterized with the help of fatigue tests on cross-ply laminates. For clarifying the evolving stress-strain behavior of the matrix during static and fatigue long-term loading, creep, and fatigue experiments with subsequent fracture tests on neat resin samples are applied. The local stress redistribution in the composite material is later evaluated numerically using composite representative volume element (RVE) and matrix models under consideration of viscoelasticity. The experimental and numerical work reveals the strong influence of residual stresses and the range of cyclic tension stresses to the damage behavior. On the microscopic level, stress redistribution dependent on the mean stress takes place and a tendency of the matrix towards embrittlement was found. Therefore, it is mandatory to consider stress amplitude and means stress as inseparable load characteristic for fatigue assessment, which additionally is influenced by production-related and time-dependent residual stresses. The phenomenological findings are incorporated to a numerical simulation framework on the layer level to provide an improved engineering tool for designing composite structures."

Accompanied by the proliferation of video is the increasing number of attacks against surveillance systems. Among the attacks, False Frame Injection (FFI) attacks that replay video frames from a previous recording to mask the live feed has the highest impact. While many attempts have been made to detect FFI frames using features from the video feeds, video analysis is computationally too intensive to be deployed on-site for real-time false frame detection. In this paper, we investigated the feasibility of FFI attacks on compromised surveillance systems at the edge and propose an effective technique to detect the injected false video and audio frames by monitoring the surveillance feed using the embedded Electrical Network Frequency (ENF) signals. An ENF operates at a nominal frequency of 60 Hz/50 Hz based on its geographical location and maintains a stable value across the entire power grid interconnection with minor fluctuations. For surveillance system video/audio recordings connected to the power grid, the ENF signals are embedded. The time-varying nature of the ENF component was used as a forensic application for authenticating the surveillance feed. The paper highlights the ENF signal collection from a power grid creating a reference database and ENF extraction from the recordings using conventional short-time Fourier Transform and spectrum detection for robust ENF signal analysis in the presence of noise and interference caused in different harmonics. The experimental results demonstrated the effectiveness of ENF signal detection and/or abnormalities for FFI attacks.",Nuclear Receptors Are Differentially Expressed and Activated in KAIMRC1 Compared to MCF7 and MDA-MB231 Breast Cancer Cells.,https://www.ncbi.nlm.nih.gov/pubmed/31141879,"Molecules (Basel, Switzerland)",2019 05 30,"We recently established a KAIMRC1 cell line that has unique features compared to the known breast cancer cell lines, MCF7 and MDA-MB231. To characterize it further, we investigated the expression profile of nuclear receptors and their respective co-factors in these cell lines. We confirm that in contrast to the triple negative cell line MDA-MB231, the MCF7 and KAIMRC1 are estrogen receptor alpha (ERa) and progesterone receptor alpha (PRa) positive, with significant lower expression of these receptors in KAIMRC1. KAIMRC1 cell is a vitamin D receptor (VDR) negative and V-ErbA-Related Protein 2 (EAR2) positive in contrast to MCF7 and MDA-MB231. Remarkably, the histone deacetylases (HDACs) are highly expressed in KAIRMC1 with HDAC6 and HDAC 7 are exclusively expressed in KAIMRC1 while thyroid hormone receptor-associated protein 80 (TRAP80), telomeric DNA binding protein 1 (TBP1) and TGF-beta receptor interacting protein (TRIP1) are absent in KAIMRC1 but present in MCF7 and MDA-MB231. In a luciferase reporter assay, the ERa coexpression is needed for estrogen receptor element (ERE)-luciferase activation by estradiol in KAIMRC1 but not in MCF7. The co-expression of exogenous Liver X receptor alpha (LXRa)/retinoid X receptor alpha (RXRa) are necessary for LXR responsive element (LXRE) activation by the GW3696 in the three cell lines. However, the activity of peroxisome proliferator-activated receptor response element (PPARE)-tk-luciferase reporter increased when peroxisome proliferator-activated receptors alpha (PPARa)/RXRa were coexpressed but the addition of PPARa agonist (GW7647) did not stimulate further the reporter. The signal of the PPARE reporter increased in a dose-dependent manner with rosiglitazone (PPARg agonist) in KAIMRC1, MCF7, and MDA-MB231 when the proliferator-activated receptors gamma (PPARg)/RXRa receptors were cotransfected. Retinoic acid-induced activation of retinoic acid receptor response element (RARE)-tk-luciferase is dependent on exogenous expression of retinoic acid receptor alpha (RARa)/RXRa heterodimer in MDA-MB 231 but not in MCF7 and KAIMRC1 cell lines. In the three cell lines, Bexarotene-induced retinoid X receptor response element (RXRE)-luciferase reporter activation was induced only if the RXRa/LXRa heterodimer were co-expressed. The vitamin D receptor response element (VDRE)-luciferase reporter activity showed another distinct feature of KAIMRC1, where only co-expression of exogenous vitamin D receptor (VDR)/RXRa heterodimer was sufficient to reach the maximum rate of activation of VDRE reporter. In the proliferation assay, nuclear receptors ligands showed a distinct effect on KAIMRC1 compared to MCF7 and MDA-MB231. Growth inhibition effects of used ligands suggest that KAIMRC1 correlate more closely to MDA-MB231 than MCF7. Vitamin D3, rosiglitazone, novel RXR compound (RXRc) and PPARa compound (GW6471) have the most profound effects. In conclusion, we showed that nuclear receptors are differentially expressed, activated and also their ligand produced distinct effects in KAIMRC1 compared to MCF7 and MDA-MB231. This finding gives us confidence that KAIMRC1 has a unique biological phenotype.",Examining the Impact of Victimization on Girls' Delinquency: A Study of Direct and Indirect Effects.,https://www.ncbi.nlm.nih.gov/pubmed/31141877,International journal of environmental research and public health,2019 05 30,"Previous research has acknowledged that there is a relationship between victimization and later delinquency, but the specific attributes of this relationship are unclear because measures of both direct and indirect victimization are rarely explored in a single study. We included both indirect and direct victimization to examine which form of victimization was a stronger predictor of substance use, fighting, running away, and sex work among girls committed to a juvenile justice facility. Findings indicated that direct victimization was typically a more salient predictor of delinquency than indirect forms of victimization. Further, running away and sex work appear to be unique outcomes that are particularly likely when girls experience direct rather than indirect victimization. Findings are summarized with implications for health and public policy.",A Highly Selective Turn-on Fluorescent Probe for the Detection of Aluminum and Its Application to Bio-Imaging.,https://www.ncbi.nlm.nih.gov/pubmed/31141876,"Sensors (Basel, Switzerland)",2019 05 30,"Aluminum is the most abundant metallic element in the Earth's crust and acts as a non-essential element for biological species. The accumulation of excessive amounts of aluminum can be harmful to biological species. Thus, the development of convenient and selective tools for the aluminum detection is necessary. In this work, a highly selective aluminum ion fluorescent probe N'-(2,5-dihydroxybenzylidene)acetohydrazide (Al-II) has been successfully synthesized and systemically characterized. The fluorescence intensity of this probe shows a significant enhancement in the presence of Al3+, which is subject to the strong quench effects caused by Cu2+ and Fe3+. The binding ratio of probe-Al3+ was determined from the Job's plot to be 1:1. Moreover, the probe was demonstrated to be effective for in vivo imaging of the intracellular aluminum ion in both living Drosophila S2 cells and Malpighian tubules.",Osmoprotectants in Hybrid Liposome/HPMC Systems as Potential Glaucoma Treatment.,https://www.ncbi.nlm.nih.gov/pubmed/31141875,Polymers,2019 05 30,"The combination of acetazolamide-loaded nano-liposomes and Hydroxypropyl methylcellulose (HPMC) with similar components to the preocular tear film in an osmoprotectant media (trehalose and erythritol) is proposed as a novel strategy to increase the ocular bioavailability of poorly soluble drugs. Ophthalmic formulations based on acetazolamide-loaded liposomes, dispersed in the osmoprotectant solution (ACZ-LP) or in combination with HPMC (ACZ-LP-P) were characterized and in vivo evaluated. The pH and tonicity of both formulations resulted in physiological ranges. The inclusion of HPMC produced an increment in viscosity (from 0.9 to 4.7 mPa·s. 64.9 ± 2.6% of acetazolamide initially included in the formulation was retained in vesicles. In both formulations, a similar onset time (1 h) and effective time periods were observed (7 h) after a single instillation (25 μL) in normotensive rabbits' eyes. The AUC0-8h of the ACZ-LP-P was 1.5-fold higher than of ACZ-LP (p < 0.001) and the maximum hypotensive effect resulted in 1.4-fold higher (p < 0.001). In addition, the formulation of ACZ in the hybrid liposome/HPMC system produced a 30.25-folds total increment in ocular bioavailability, compared with the drug solution. Excellent tolerance in rabbits' eyes was confirmed during the study.",Actinic Keratosis: Current Therapies and Insights Into New Treatments,https://www.ncbi.nlm.nih.gov/pubmed/31141862,Journal of drugs in dermatology : JDD,2019 05 29,"Actinic keratosis (AK) develops on chronically sun-exposed skin and constitutes one of the most common diseases managed by dermatologists. The incidence of AKs continues to rise among aging as well as younger sun damaged populations worldwide, underscoring the importance of effective therapy options. Various treatments are available, including light-based therapies, topical therapies, and destructive therapies. Herein, we review the current management options for AKs and discuss emerging therapeutic agents.

J Drugs Dermatol. 2019;18(5 Suppl 1):s161-166.",Addressing the Challenges of Treating Actinic Keratosis,https://www.ncbi.nlm.nih.gov/pubmed/31141861,Journal of drugs in dermatology : JDD,2019 05 29,"Actinic keratosis (AK) represents one of the most common diagnoses in our dermatology practices. The incidence of AK lesions continues to rise, along with that of non-melanoma skin cancers. Numerous risk factors have now been implicated, including chronic sun exposure, history of sunburns, fair skin, advanced age, male gender, and immunosuppression. Although an individual lesion’s likelihood of progression to malignancy remains very low, AKs seldom occur in isolation. Indeed, the condition can most accurately be described as a “field disease”, with a mix of clinical and subclinical lesions present in the same region. Studies have shown that the majority of squamous cell carcinomas arise in sites of pre-existing AKs, highlighting the importance of diagnosis and appropriate management.",Evaluation of Onychomycosis Information on the Internet,https://www.ncbi.nlm.nih.gov/pubmed/31141860,Journal of drugs in dermatology : JDD,2019 05 29,"Onychomycosis is a common and significant nail condition causing both physical and social impairment. Since patients often search for health information online, the accuracy of this information has become important. In this study, we sought to assess the reliability and comprehensibility of accessible internet information for patients searching for onychomycosis. We identified the top search engine hits, evaluating websites on several categories: Accountability, Quality of Medical Information, Readability, Display, Support Features, and Transparency/Disclosures. Utilizing a pro forma based on established internet codes of conduct, website readability scores, and peer-reviewed papers, we objectively analyzed and scored the most commonly-listed websites on onychomycosis. Fifty-one total websites were reviewed with a maximum possible overall score of 43. The mean overall score for all websites was 20 and 1/43 (range, 4-35) with varied Accountability (mean, 4.9/10; range, 0-10) and Quality (mean, 6.4/13; range,1-12/13). Readability was poor overall with only 1/3 of sites meeting the acceptable 7th grade reading level for patients. In addition, while sites such as the American Academy of Dermatology website were well-organized and highly readable (Readability score, 5/5), this may compromise the quality of medical information presented (Quality score, 6/13). Because online education materials set the expectations and concerns of patients with onychomycosis, the variability in website reliability necessitates more efficient and regulated methods of presenting health information.",Use of a Buried Intradermal (Subcutaneous) Running Suture for Superficial Repair to Optimize Cosmetic Outcome,https://www.ncbi.nlm.nih.gov/pubmed/31141859,Journal of drugs in dermatology : JDD,2019 05 29,"Superficial repair after excisions helps to optimize cosmetic outcomes. Possibly due to how wound closures are traditionally taught in dermatology, simple interrupted or continuous sutures are overwhelmingly favored by dermatologic surgeons in superficial repair, especially on cosmetically sensitive areas such as face and ears. However, this repair method risks wound overgrowth around the points where the suture traverses through the epidermis, and long-term postsurgical healing frequently leaves behind scars with ‘railroad track’ suture marks rather than a fine line. Here, we present buried intradermal running suture technique as an alternative superficial repair method compared to the simple interrupted or running suture techniques. We demonstrate the superior cosmetic outcome offered by buried intradermal suture with 2 patient cases, who had defects on the temple and shin. While dermatologists can now offer energy-based devices and neuromodulators to improve cosmesis, our approach helps optimize scar appearance so that patients can have the best possible surgical outcome without necessitating further interventions.

The use of this therapy modality resulted in near complete resolution of all of the patient’s lesions except for those on her palms, soles, and scalp. Excellent wound care and treatment adherence were major factors contributing to the success of this treatment option. Our results ultimately provide an alternative approach to treating multiple arsenical keratoses in patients who are limited to a drug plan involving 5-FU and oral nicotinamide and who are able to be rigorously compliant with application of medication and wound care.
