Several lines of evidence suggest that BACE1 is a key enzyme in the pathogenesis of AD and its inhibition is of particular importance in AD treatment. Ten new 3-hydrazinyl-1,2,4-triazines bearing pendant aryl phenoxy methyl-1,2,3-triazole were synthesized as multifunctional ligands against AD. We show that compounds containing Cl and NO2 groups at the para position of the phenyl ring, namely compounds 7c (IC50 = 8.55 ± 3.37 µM) and 7d (IC50 = 11.42 ± 2.01 µM), possess promising BACE1 inhibitory potential. Furthermore, we assessed the neuroprotective activities of 7c and 7d derivatives in PC12 neuronal cell line, which showed moderate protection against amyloid β peptide toxicity. In addition, compound 7d demonstrated metal chelating activity and moderate antioxidant potential (IC50 = 44.42 ± 7.33 µM). Molecular docking studies of these molecules revealed high-affinity binding to several amino acids of BACE1, which are essential for efficient inhibition. These results demonstrate that 1,2,4-triazine derivatives bearing an aryl phenoxy methyl-1,2,3-triazole have promising properties as therapeutic agents for AD.",Combined molecular modeling and cholinesterase inhibition studies on some natural and semisynthetic O-alkylcoumarin derivatives.,https://www.ncbi.nlm.nih.gov/pubmed/30530106,Bioorganic chemistry,2019 02 12,"Coumarins of synthetic or natural origins are an important chemical class exerting diverse pharmacological activities. In the present study, 26 novel O-alkylcoumarin derivatives were synthesized and have been tested at 100 µM for their in vitro inhibitory potential against acetylcholinesterase (AChE) and butyrlcholinesterase (BChE) targets which are the key enzymes playing role in the pathogenesis of Alzheimer's disease. Among the tested coumarins, none of them could inhibit AChE, whereas 12 of them exerted a marked and selective inhibition against BChE as compared to the reference (galanthamine, IC50 = 46.58 ± 0.91 µM). In fact, 10 of the active coumarins showed higher inhibition (IC50 = 7.01 ± 0.28 µM - 43.31 ± 3.63 µM) than that of galanthamine. The most active ones were revealed to be 7-styryloxycoumarin (IC50 = 7.01 ± 0.28 µM) and 7-isopentenyloxy-4-methylcoumarin (IC50 = 8.18 ± 0.74 µM). In addition to the in vitro tests, MetaCore/MetaDrug binary QSAR models and docking simulations were applied to evaluate the active compounds by ligand-based and target-driven approaches. The predicted pharmacokinetic profiles of the compounds suggested that the compounds reveal lipophilic character and permeate blood brain barrier (BBB) and the ADME models predict higher human serum protein binding percentages (>50%) for the compounds. The calculated docking scores indicated that the coumarins showing remarkable BChE inhibition possessed favorable free binding energies in interacting with the ligand-binding domain of the target. Therefore, our results disclose that O-alkylcoumarins are promising selective inhibitors of cholinesterase enzymes, particularly BChE in our case, which definitely deserve further studies.",16 α-Hydroxyestrone induced adduct generate high affinity autoantibodies in SLE.,https://www.ncbi.nlm.nih.gov/pubmed/30530105,Advances in medical sciences,2019 05 29,"Increased 16 α-hydroxyestrone (16 α-OHE1) and autoantibodies against histone H1 (H1) have been well described in systemic lupus erythematosus (SLE), but the combination effects of 16 α-OHE1 and H1 remains unclear.

Chromosome 5/7 involvement was common (78.22%, 79/101) and associated with shorter OS (12 months vs. 28 months, P < 0.01) Monosomal karyotype (MK) is overlapped with CK in 79 patients, but was not statistically associated with shorter OS. While in 59 cases with genes sequenced, 57 (96.61%) patients were found to have at least one mutation of known significance, and TP53 was the most frequent (74.58%, 44/59), the median OS of patients with TP53 mutation was shorter than those without (10 vs. 27 months, P < 0.01). Multivariate analysis demonstrated that only TP53 mutation was the strongest independent prognostic factor for OS. Moreover, high variant allele frequency (VAF) of TP53 mutation (median VAF was 70.00%) was seen and associated with adverse survival (9 months vs. 13 months, p = 0.04). In conclusion, MDS patients with CK implied an unfavorable outcome regardless of any treatment, TP53 mutation occurs at a high frequency and has a higher VAF, both were associated with worse survival.",Chromophoric dissolved organic matter influence correction of algal concentration measurements using three-dimensional fluorescence spectra.,https://www.ncbi.nlm.nih.gov/pubmed/30530100,"Spectrochimica acta. Part A, Molecular and biomolecular spectroscopy",2019 01 31,"In view of the adverse effects of CDOM (chromophoric or colored dissolved organic matter) on in vivo algal pigment concentration measurements in natural water bodies, a CDOM influence correction method for algal concentration measurements based on three-dimensional fluorescence spectra is investigated. The three-dimensional fluorescence spectra of five common species of algae belonging to five categories, HA (humic acid), and natural water sampled from the Dongpu reservoir, Hefei were analyzed, and the spectral similarity of endogenous/exogenous CDOM in the algal fluorescence spectra region was compared. HA was selected to represent the CDOM spectrum group. The CDOM modified algal pigment concentration measurement method was developed using three-dimensional fluorescence spectra coupled with non-negative weighted least squares linear regression analysis. The results show that under the presence of CDOM interference factors, the recognition accuracy rate of Pyrrophyta, Bacillariophyta, Cyanophyta, and Chlorophyta increased 100%, 100%, 40%, and 40%, respectively. The average recovery rate of Cryptomonas, Pyrrophyta, Bacillariophyta, and Chlorophyta increased 162.7%, 50.3%, 106.4%, and 19.1%, respectively. In addition, the classification accuracy of Pyrrophyta, Bacillariophyta, Cyanophyta, Chlorophyta increased 83.9%, 100%, 38.2%, and 48%, respectively. This was concluded by comparing these results with the results of the algal pigment concentration measurement method without the CDOM modification.

In this work, we demonstrate how the use of complex-valued peak descriptions can improve peak fitting in the frequency domain - incorporating phase and baseline correction as well as apodization while working with commonly used Fourier-transformed data. The method has been implemented in an open source R package called rnmrfit that is available for download on GitHub (https://github.com/ssokolen/rnmrfit). Application to real data suggests that this approach can also result in dramatically higher precision than can be achieved with existing software. Simulation data indicates that coefficients of variation below 0.1% can be readily achieved at signal to noise (SNR) ratios of approximately 100. The use of complex-valued data in the frequency domain is demonstrated as a relatively simple and effective means of improving peak fitting for quantitative NMR analysis."

The population was stratified according to the estimated glomerular filtration rates (eGFR) that accompany the stages of kidney disease, designated as glomerular function-1 (GF-1, eGFR>90 mL/min/1.73 m2); GF-2 (eGFR 60-89 mL/min/1.73 m2), GF-3A (eGFR 45-59 mL/min/1.73 m2), and GF-3B and 4 combined (eGFR 15-44 mL/min/1.73 m2). Unadjusted as well as adjusted geometric means for serum PFOA, PFDA, PFHxS, and PFNA increased as expected through stage GF-3A but decreased below the concentrations associated with GF-1 for those who were in GF-3B/4. For example, unadjusted geometric means for PFOA were 2.59, 3.02, 3.01, and 2.22 ng/mL for GF-1, GF-2, GF-3A, and GF-3B/4 respectively. Adjusted geometric means for PFOA were 2.34, 2.83, 2.83, and 1.81 ng/mL for GF-1, GF-2, GF-3A, and GF-3B/4 respectively. Thus, PFAS were found to follow inverted U-shaped distributions across different stages of glomerular function. For females, decreases in adjusted PFAS serum levels were initiated at GF-3A, while decreases for males began as early as GF-2. Usually, females are known to have lower levels of PFAS but when in GF-3A and GF-3B/4, females were found to have higher levels of PFAS than males. Thus, inverted U-shaped curves for males and females intersected between GF-2 and GF-3A for PFOA and PFHxS and at GF-3A for PFOS and PFNA. Associations between PFAS and biomarkers of kidney function may be modified in both magnitude and even in direction as kidney function deteriorates. These findings have implications for studies that evaluate associations between PFAS and disease states that affect kidney function, as well as outcome biomarkers known to be affected by kidney function.",Changes in thyroid function of nestling tree swallows (Tachycineta bicolor) in relation to polycyclic aromatic compounds and other environmental stressors in the Athabasca Oil Sands Region.,https://www.ncbi.nlm.nih.gov/pubmed/30530086,Environmental research,2019 01 25,"In the Canadian Athabasca Oil Sands Region (AOSR), nestling tree swallows (Tachycineta bicolor) raised near mining-related activities accumulated greater concentrations of polycyclic aromatic compounds (PACs) that contributed to their poorer condition, growth, and reproductive success. Here, we report changes in thyroid function of the same 14 day old (do) nestlings (N ≤ 68) at these mining-related sites (OS1, OS2) compared to reference nestlings (REF1), and in relation to multiple environmental stressors that influence avian thyroid function. Thyroid function was compromised for OS1 nestlings but generally comparable between OS2 and REF1 chicks. In 2012, circulating total triiodothyronine (TT3) and thyroxine (TT4) were similar among all nestlings. The OS1 chicks had more active thyroid glands based on histological endpoints. Hepatic T4 outer-ring deiodinase (T4-ORD) activity was suppressed in OS1 and OS2 chicks. Despite inter-annual differences, OS1 chicks continued experiencing compromised thyroid function with significantly higher circulating TT4 and more active thyroid glands in 2013. The OS2 chicks had less active thyroid glands, which conceivably contributed to their suppressed growth (previously reported) relative to the heavier OS1 nestlings with more active thyroid glands. Thyroid gland activity was more influenced by the chicks' accumulation of (muscle), than exposure (feces) to naphthalene, C2-naphthalenes, and C1-fluorenes. Of four major volatile organic contaminants, sulfur dioxide (SO2) primarily influenced thyroid gland activity and structure, supporting previous findings with captive birds. When collectively considering environmental-thyroidal stressors, chicks had a greater thyroidal response when they experienced colder temperatures, accumulated more C2-naphthalenes, and consumed aquatic-emerging insects with higher PAC burdens than terrestrial insects (carbon (δ13C)). We hypothesize that the more active thyroid glands and higher circulating TT4 of the OS1 chicks supported their growth and survival despite having the highest PAC burdens, whereas the lack of thyroid response in the OS2 chicks combined with high PAC burdens, contributed to their smaller size, poorer condition and poorer survival.",Health effects of wind turbines on humans in residential settings: Results of a scoping review.,https://www.ncbi.nlm.nih.gov/pubmed/30530085,Environmental research,2019 01 25,"As the global number of wind turbines has increased steadily in recent years, as has the number of studies about putative health effects in residential settings, it is the review purpose to give an overview of the characteristics and methodologies of the scientific literature around the topic in order to identify research gaps and to derive implications for research and practice.

The adsorbent was characterized by multiple modern surface and microstructure analyzing techniques. CMNTs were composed of three components including carbon dots (CDs), carbon nanotubes (CNTs) and magnetite. CDs and CNTs introduce abundant carboxyl groups onto CMNTs and magnetite allows rapid magnetic separation of the adsorbent realizable after batch adsorption. This adsorbent has a moderately high adsorption capacity of 65 mg-carbamazepine/g-adsorbent at pH 7.0 ± 0.2, which is superior to many reported adsorbents. Carbamazepine was uptaken well in a wide pH range, regardless of the surface charging of CMNTs. Its adsorption on CMNTs was quite fast and reached 80% of removal during the initial 3 h. The mass transfer within CMNTs and the time-dependent utilization, exhaustion and depletion of the adsorption capacity were successfully described using a simplified homogeneous surface diffusion model (HSDM). The surface diffusion coefficients (Ds) rose with increasing initial carbamazepine concentrations. After six regeneration and recycle experiments, the capacity loss of CMNTs was less than 2.2% at the conditions tested. FTIR spectra showed the characteristics of the components. Raman spectra implied a π-π electron donor-acceptor (EDA) interaction during adsorption. This work proposed a method of combining π-bond-rich materials (CNTs and CDs) and magnetite to make separable composite adsorbents with high affinity interactions between carbamazepine and carbon materials. The prepared adsorbent is attractive for carbamazepine removal due to its good performance, moderate cost, ease of separation, and ability to regenerate.",Co-Al nanosheets derived from LDHs and their catalytic performance for syngas conversion.,https://www.ncbi.nlm.nih.gov/pubmed/30530082,Journal of colloid and interface science,2019 02 15,"Layered double hydroxides (LDHs) were innovatively employed in this study as catalyst for synthesis gas conversion to chemicals, such as oxygenates.

The samples were characterized by SEM, TEM and AFM, and separately dispersed nanosheets can be clearly observed. The prepared lamellas were applied in aqueous-phase synthesis gas conversion reaction. The catalysts generated a superior activity of 0.055-0.675 molCO·molCo-1·h-1 and greater oxygenated product (acetaldehyde) selectivity (SOxy = 75-88%) than conventional cobalt Fisher-Tropsch (FT) synthesis catalysts.

Herein, three-dimensional channel-structured graphene (CSG), which was synthesized via exothermic reaction between liquid potassium and carbon monoxide gas, was demonstrated as an efficient electrode material for CDI. Namely, the CSG electrode exhibited a specific capacity of 207.4 F/g at 0.2 A/g in 1 M NaCl aqueous solution. In a batch-mode recycling system, the electrosorption capacity of CSG can achieve 5.70 and 9.60 mg/g at 1.5 V in 50 and 295 mg/l NaCl aqueous solutions, respectively. The excellent electrosorption capacity of CSG, especially under low saline concentration, can be attributed to the synergistic effect of its large surface area (711.9 m2/g), unique channel structure, and oxygen functional groups.",Effects of oxidation on the physicochemical properties of polyunsaturated lipid membranes.,https://www.ncbi.nlm.nih.gov/pubmed/30530078,Journal of colloid and interface science,2019 02 03,"The exposure of biological membranes to reactive oxygen species (ROS) plays an important role in many pathological conditions such as inflammation, infection, or sepsis. ROS also modulate signaling processes and produce markers for damaged tissue. Lipid peroxidation, mainly affecting polyunsaturated phospholipids, results in a complex mixture of oxidized products, which may dramatically alter membrane properties. Here, we have employed a set of biophysical and surface-chemical techniques, including neutron and X-ray scattering, to study the structural, compositional, and stability changes due to oxidative stress on phospholipid bilayers composed of lipids with different degrees of polyunsaturation. In doing so, we obtained real-time information about bilayer degradation under in situ UV exposure using neutron reflectometry. We present a set of interrelated physicochemical effects, including gradual increases in area per molecule, head group and acyl chain hydration, as well as bilayer thinning, lateral phase separation, and defect formation leading to content loss upon membrane oxidation. Such effects were observed to depend on the presence of polyunsaturated phospholipids in the lipid membrane, suggesting that these may also play a role in the complex oxidation processes occurring in cells.","Development of Ca2+-based, ion-responsive superabsorbent hydrogel for cement applications: Self-healing and compressive strength.",https://www.ncbi.nlm.nih.gov/pubmed/30530077,Journal of colloid and interface science,2019 02 15,"Superabsorbent polymers (SAPs) are broadly applied in cement and concrete. However, the increased macrovoids resulting from the absorption/desorption of SAPs, remarkably reduced the resulting mechanical properties. In this study, we prepared superabsorbent CaAlg hydrogels by crosslinking Ca2+ and sodium alginate (NaAlg). The ion-responsive behavior of CaAlg was measured, and results showed at lower the Ca2+ concentrations, higher swelling potentials were observed, which was consistent with what was expected with the formation of a less dense network. This interesting dependence on Ca2+ concentration likely avoids the formation of large macro-pores during the mixing process of cement and results in increased swelling when cracks occur and water enters the crevices. The results of compressive strength measurements demonstrated that the addition of 0.5 wt% CaAlg resulted in a negligible reduction (0.014%) in compressive strength due to the limited swelling capacity in pore solution. Interestingly, in the sodium silicate self-healing system, in addition to the widely reported self-sealing effects upon adsorption of additional water, CaAlg also accelerates the precipitation of calcium silicate hydrates (CSH) by providing Ca2+, which makes the healing process more efficient."

Part A, Molecular and biomolecular spectroscopy",2019 01 22,"Two novel acceptor-donor-acceptor-donor-acceptor (A2-D-A1-D-A2) type pi-conjugated symmetrical squaraine dyes, denoted by PQSQ 1 and PQSQ 2 based on 2, 3, 3, 8-tetramethyl -3H-pyrrolo [3,2-h] quinoline were successfully synthesized for the first time to arrive absorption and emission at NIR region. These dyes comprise indolenines as electron donor units, squaryl ring as a central electron acceptor and pyridines as terminal electron acceptor units. The relationship between molecular structures and photophysical properties of these dyes was studied in comparison with their parent compounds (ISQ and N-Et ISQ). These novel squaraine dyes displayed an intense absorption within the range 671 to 692 nm in polar to non- polar solvents respectively with good molar extinction coefficients (˃105 Lmol-1 cm-1). Compared to their parent squaraines, both dyes showed red-shifted absorption (33-44 nm) as well as emission (38-59 nm) due to the electron-accepting ability of the ancillary pyridine acceptors and extended pi-conjugation. These dyes exhibited negative solvatochromism and Reichardt's ET (30) scale was applied to propose a quantitative relationship of the relative stability of ground and excited-state of these squaraines with solvent polarity. The electrochemical and computational properties of these symmetrical squaraines were investigated with the help of cyclic voltammetry and density functional theory (DFT). Moreover, PQSQ 1-2 exhibited high thermal and photo-stability. These A2-D-A1-D-A2 type dyes showed improved photostabilities compared to their parent D-A-D type dyes.",Binding of Clitoria ternatea L. flower extract with α-amylase simultaneously monitored at two wavelengths using a photon streaming time-resolved fluorescence approach.,https://www.ncbi.nlm.nih.gov/pubmed/30530062,"Spectrochimica acta. Part A, Molecular and biomolecular spectroscopy",2019 02 15,"The binding of an extract from the flowers of Clitoria ternatea L. to the digestive enzyme α-amylase was investigated. This extract is a mixture of flavonoids, including anthocyanins, and has been previously shown to inhibit the activity this enzyme. This has implications for modulating starch digestion. In order to investigate the kinetics, we made use of time-resolved fluorescence to simultaneously monitor two different emission bands emanating from the extract. This measurement was enabled by the use of a ""photon streaming"" approach and changes in fluorescence lifetime and intensity were used to follow the interaction. A longer wavelength band (655 nm) was ascribed to anthocyanins in the mixture and these were observed to bind at a rate an order of magnitude slower than other flavonoids present in the extract, monitored at a shorter wavelength (485 nm). Changes in the fluorescence emission of the extract upon binding were further assessed by the use of decay associated spectra.",Cloning and functional analysis of squalene synthase gene from Dryopteris fragrans (L.) Schott.,https://www.ncbi.nlm.nih.gov/pubmed/30530061,Protein expression and purification,2018 12 30,"Dryopteris fragrans (L.) Schott is a traditional herbal medicine containing medicinal sterols and triterpenoids. Squalene synthase (SQS) is the first crucial enzyme in the biosynthesis pathway of sterols and triterpenoids. The full-length cDNA named DfSQS1 was isolated by RACE. It was predicted that DfSQS1 contained an open reading frame (ORF) of 1239 bp coding 412 amino acid residues with molecular weight of 46.6 kDa. It had 18 potential phosphorylation sites, 1 potential N-glycosylation site and 2 transmembrane domains. In neighbor-joining (NJ) phylogenetic tree, DfSQS1 was away from branch of gymnosperms and angiosperms. One hydrophobic domain at the C-terminal of DfSQS1 was deleted to express soluble recombinant enzyme. The truncated DfSQS1 (tDfSQS1) was expressed in Escherichia coli BL21 (DE3). Then, tDfSQS1 was obtained and incubated with farnesyl diphosphate (FPP) to identify its enzymatic activity. The result demontrated that squalene, the product of enzyme catalyzed reaction, was detected by HPLC. Quantitative real-time PCR (qRT-PCR) analysis revealed that the transcription level of DfSQS1 in D. fragrans was the highest in roots, followed by leaves and rhizomes. This work is the first report on cloning, characteration and expression of SQS from D. fragrans. It will be helpful to understand the regulatory role of SQS on the biosynthesis of triterpenoids in the fern.","The relation of alexithymia, chronic perceived stress and declarative memory performance: Results from the general population.",https://www.ncbi.nlm.nih.gov/pubmed/30530059,Psychiatry research,2019 05 06,"Previous evidence showed associations of alexithymia with altered declarative memory performance. However, these findings were not fully consistent and the underlying mechanism remains unclear. Alexithymic subjects may be at specific risk for chronic psychosocial stress, which in turn represents a predictor for poorer memory performance. We investigated independent and interaction effects of alexithymia and chronic perceived stress on declarative memory performance. Data were used from two independent general-population samples from the Study of Health in Pomerania (SHIP). In sample 1 (N = 1981), the Auditory Verbal Learning Test, the Toronto Alexithymia Scale (TAS-20) and the Screening Scale for Chronic Stress (SSCS) were applied. In sample 2 (N = 3799), the word list of the Nuremburg Age Inventory and TAS-20 were administered to replicate findings. Alexithymia was significantly associated with poorer immediate and delayed word recall. Chronic stress negatively predicted immediate, but not delayed recall. Alexithymia and particularly ""Difficulties Identifying Feelings"" showed significant associations with chronic perceived stress. Our findings provide clear evidence for an association of alexithymia with impaired declarative memory performance for words. The strong association of alexithymia with perceived chronic stress could contribute to explain the association of alexithymia with stress-related disorders.",Does improvement in symptoms and quality of life in chronic schizophrenia reduce family caregiver burden?,https://www.ncbi.nlm.nih.gov/pubmed/30530058,Psychiatry research,2019 05 06,"The longitudinal association of changes in clinical status among adults with schizophrenia and changes in family caregiver burden has not been demonstrated. Using data from the NIMH-funded CATIE schizophrenia trial (n = 446 family caregivers), we examined the association of changes in patient symptoms and quality of life with changes in measures of family caregiver burden. Clinical changes in patient symptoms and quality of life were not significantly associated with changes in family caregiver burden. The weak association likely reflects that small clinical changes in chronically ill adults are insufficient to affect long established experiences of burden.","Self-stigma versus stigma resistance in schizophrenia: Associations with resilience, premorbid adjustment, and clinical symptoms.",https://www.ncbi.nlm.nih.gov/pubmed/30530057,Psychiatry research,2019 05 06,"Self-stigma is regarded as a barrier to recovery from schizophrenia and the identification of factors protecting from its development may help identify vulnerable patients and subsequently, implement effective preventive and therapeutic interventions. Hence, this study aimed to assess whether resilience, premorbid adjustment, and psychopathology might differently impact self-stigma and stigma resistance among 54 regular attendees of a specialized outpatient clinic. There was no significant association between sociodemographic variables and self-stigma/stigma resistance, while resilience was negatively correlated with self-stigma and positively correlated with stigma resistance. In addition, we detected a negative correlation between self-stigma and both academic and social functioning during late adolescence. Most residual symptoms correlated with self-stigma, while no association was found between stigma resistance and psychopathology, except for depressed symptoms. These data provide evidence that future self-stigma reduction interventions may consider to focus on the improvement of resilience in order to promote schizophrenia patients' stigma resistance. In addition, the improvement of depressive symptoms as well as interventions focusing on the strengthening of social adjustment during the prodromal phase may be effective in preventing self-stigma.",Cytotoxicity studies of quantum dots with the electroporation method.,https://www.ncbi.nlm.nih.gov/pubmed/30530056,"Bioelectrochemistry (Amsterdam, Netherlands)",2019 02 27,"In this study, the cytotoxicity of CdTe quantum dots (QDs) of various dimensions was examined using the electroporation method. The influence of the size of QDs on normal and tumour cell viability after 24 h of incubation with nanomaterials was examined. The three human cell lines were chosen for the tests: A549 (a tumour cell line derived from the lung), MRC-5 (normal fibroblasts from the lung) and HaCaT (normal keratinocytes from the skin). Accordingly, we modelled the effect of nanocrystals on various human tissues because nanoparticles can be introduced into an organism through different routes. We were also able to study which cells are more sensitive to nanoparticles: normal or tumour cells. The nanoparticles were introduced into cells through pores in the cell membranes that were generated by electrical pulses. The effectiveness of introducing nanocrystals into cells was determined as a function of the nanocrystal dimensions and accumulation locations. Moreover, the cytotoxicity of quantum dots was tested, and cell viability after electroporation was evaluated. We also investigated whether the introduced nanocrystals released cadmium ions.","Synthesis of anticorrosion nanohybrid films based on bioinspired dopamine, L-cys/CNT@PDA through self-assembly on 304 stainless steel in 3.5% NaCl.",https://www.ncbi.nlm.nih.gov/pubmed/30530055,"Bioelectrochemistry (Amsterdam, Netherlands)",2019 02 27,"Nanohybrid films containing multiwalled carbon nanotubes (MWCNTs) were successfully coated on 304-stainless steel (304ss) for anti-corrosion use.

Antiepileptic drugs often use in reproductive age, through reproductive progress and maturation. On the other side, cold-pressed oils are rich in bioactive phytochemicals with health-promoting traits. The target of this work was to appraise the sexual dysfunction of antiepileptic Topiramate (TPM) and cold pressed ginger oil (CPGO) as antiepileptic alternative medicine in male mice. Fifty-four adult male albino mice were divided into nine groups (n = 6 mice). One group given saline and used as negative control; another one was given corn oil as vehicle. Six groups administered orally with TPM or CPGO at 100, 200 and 400 mg/kg. Moreover, group of animals co-administrated orally CPGO with TPM (400 mg/kg) to study their interaction. Fatty acid profile and tocols composition of CPGO were determined. in vitro assays were undertaken to evaluate radical scavenging traits of CPGO utilizing sable 1,1-diphenyl-2-picrylhydrazyl (DPPH·) and galvinoxyl radicals. The study investigated antioxidant and oxidative stress markers, sexual hormones levels, mRNA levels of vascular endothelial growth factor (Vegfa), synaptonemal complex protein (Sycp3), Wilms tumor gene (Wt1) as well as histopathological and immunohistochemical examination. Strong radical scavenging potential of CPGO against stable DPPH· and galvinoxyl radicals was recorded. The results revealed that TPM caused a dose-dependent reduction in the antioxidant activities and testosterone content, while, malonaldehyde (MDA) and nitric oxide (NO) as oxidative stress markers were elevated. Vegfa and Sycp3 mRNA expression down-regulated at all Topiramate tested doses, but Wt1 up-regulated at 400 mg/kg. TPM (400 mg/kg) revealed histological alterations associated with strong positive Bax immune reactive spermatogoneal and Leydig cells. Ginger oil elevated the CAT and SOD (antioxidant enzymes), serum testosterone and diminished the oxidative stress, up regulated the expression of Vegfa and Sycp3 and down-regulated the Wt1 expression. Meanwhile, CPGO revealed no histopathological alterations and no Bax immune-reactive cells. CPGO co-administration with TPM (400 mg/kg) attenuated the TPM toxicity. High doses of TPM may exhibit sexual dysfunction but CPGO is safe and has androgenic property. CPGO co-administration could protect the antiepileptic patient from the TPM sexual dysfunction.",The roles of ZEB1 in tumorigenic progression and epigenetic modifications.,https://www.ncbi.nlm.nih.gov/pubmed/30530042,Biomedicine & pharmacotherapy = Biomedecine & pharmacotherapie,2019 04 22,"Highly expressed Zinc-finger E-box binding protein 1 (ZEB1) is significantly associated with the malignancy of various cancers. Signal transduction and activation of ZEB1 play important roles in cancer transformation and epithelial-mesenchymal transition (EMT). Emerging evidence suggests that ZEB1 drives the induction of EMT with activation of stem cell traits, immune evasion and epigenetic reprogramming. As an ideal target for EMT research, ZEB1 has been extensively studied for decades. However, the link between ZEB1 and epigenetic regulation of EMT has only recently been discovered. ZEB1 facilitates the epigenetic silencing of E-cadherin by recruiting multiple chromatin enzymes of E-cadherin promoter, such as histone deacetylases (HDACs), DNA methyltransferase (DNMT) and ubiquitin ligase. Destruction of the connection between ZEB1 and these chromatin-modifying enzymes may represent an efficient for treating cancer. In this review, we outlined the biological function of ZEB1 in tumorigenic progression and epigenetic modifications and elucidate its transcriptional network, which is a suitable potential target for the design of novel anticancer drugs.",Targeting Nrf2/HO-1 signaling by crocin: Role in attenuation of AA-induced ulcerative colitis in rats.,https://www.ncbi.nlm.nih.gov/pubmed/30530041,Biomedicine & pharmacotherapy = Biomedecine & pharmacotherapie,2019 04 22,"Ulcerative colitis (UC) is usually a mildly active disease; however, it can be associated with serious systemic complications. The current study was undertaken to evaluate the anti-ulcerogenic and coloprotective properties of crocin; the major biologically active ingredient of saffron against experimentally-induced UC, by intracolonic instillation of AA (AA). Rats received either felodipine (3 mg/kg) or crocin (20 mg/kg) orally for 8 successive days as protective and curative therapies. Either as a protective or as a curative remedy, crocin significantly reversed AA-induced colonic damage. Intracolonic AA-induced a significant functional, biochemical and inflammatory colon injury. On the other hand, crocin significantly attenuated AA-induced oxidative, inflammatory and apoptotic activity. Crocin significantly enhanced colon anti-oxidant defenses and reduced colon tumor necrosis factor-α (TNF-α) and Ca+2 contents with down-regulation of the inflammatory response and oxidative load. The anti-ulcerogenic effect of crocin appears to be Ca+2 dependent. Most importantly, crocin enhanced colon Nuclear Factor, Erythroid-Derived 2 like Protein 2 (Nrf2) content and Heme Oxygenase-1 (HO-1) activity and attenuated caspase-3 activity. In conclusion; crocin demonstrated anti-ulcerogenic and coloprotective effect mediated primarily by its antioxidant, anti-inflammatory and anti-apoptotic properties. The therapeutic impact is mediated primarily via enhancement of colon Nrf2 content by 211% in protective protocol and by 350% in curative and HO-1 signaling by 49% in protective protocol and, 288% in the curative protocol. Enhancement of Nrf2 and HO-1 signaling and down-regulation of caspase-3 activity are believed to underly the observed therapeutic effect.",EEG recording during an emotional face-matching task in children of mothers with interpersonal violence-related posttraumatic stress disorder.,https://www.ncbi.nlm.nih.gov/pubmed/30530040,Psychiatry research. Neuroimaging,2019 02 18,"The aim of this study was to examine the effects of maternal interpersonal violence-related posttraumatic disorder (IPV-PTSD) on child appraisal of emotion, as measured by high-density electroencephalography (HD-EEG) during an Emotional Face-matching Task (EFMT). We recorded HD-EEG in 47 children of mothers with and without IPV-PTSD during an Emotional Face-matching Task (EFMT). Mothers and children each performed the EFMT. Behavioral results demonstrated that both mothers who were directly exposed to violent events, and their children, presented attentional bias toward negative emotions when processing facial stimuli. EEG findings confirmed differences in emotion appraisal between children of IPV-PTSD mothers and non-PTSD controls at scalp-level and in terms of source localization upon which children of IPV-PTSD mothers demonstrated decreased activation of the right dorsolateral prefrontal cortex (dlPFC) in response to angry and fearful faces as compared to non-PTSD children with respect to the N170 component. Our study, to our knowledge, is the first to show that maternal IPV-PTSD significantly affects a mother's own and her child's neural activity in response to facial expressions of negative emotion. These findings are potentially important to the development and study of effective interventions to interrupt intergenerational cycles of violence and trauma.","Volatile, stored and phloem exudate-located compounds represent different appearance levels affecting aphid niche choice.",https://www.ncbi.nlm.nih.gov/pubmed/30530039,Phytochemistry,2019 03 15,"Intraspecific and intra-individual differences in emitted volatile compounds and in surface and phloem sap-related metabolites do not only affect host plant choice of monophagous aphids but may also guide them to the plant part that provides their ideal niche by maximising their fitness. However, little is known about the variation at these different plant appearance levels. We investigated the preferences of the monophagous aphid species Macrosiphoniella tancetaria and Uroleucon tanaceti for different plant parts (inflorescence stems, young and old leaves) of Tanacetum vulgare plants from two chemotypes, testing their reactions towards volatile, surface and phloem sap-related cues. Furthermore, we studied the variation in leaf glandular trichome density as well as in the composition of volatile, stored and phloem exudate-located specialised (secondary) plant compounds from the different plant parts of these chemotypes. Aphid species showed differences in their preferences. Aphids of M. tanacetaria had to assess the entire plant to choose the stem, whereas U. tanaceti only needed volatile cues to locate the old leaves, which are the plant parts representing their respective niches. Volatiles and stored metabolites varied in their composition and concentration between chemotypes. Stored metabolites additionally differed among plant parts, which was reflected in distinct trichome densities. The composition of phloem exudate-located specialised compounds mostly varied among plant parts. These pronounced differences in plant chemistry on multiple levels provide distinct perception levels for aphids probably driving their niche choice. This study demonstrates the importance to consider these multiple levels to elucidate plant-herbivore interactions with high resolution.",Spatial deconvolution of aerial radiometric survey and its application to the fallout from a radiological dispersal device.,https://www.ncbi.nlm.nih.gov/pubmed/30530038,Journal of environmental radioactivity,2019 01 09,"Mapping radioactive contamination using aerial survey measurements is an area under active investigation today. The radiometric aerial survey technique has been extensively applied following reactor accidents and also would provide a key tool for response to a malicious radiological or nuclear incident. Methods exist to calibrate the aerial survey system for quantification of the concentration of natural radionuclides, which can provide guidance. However, these methods have anticipated a spatial distribution of the source which is large in comparison to the survey altitude. In rapid emergency-response aerial surveys of areas of safety concern, deposits of relatively small spatial extent may be expected. The activity of such spatially restricted hot spots is underestimated using the traditional methods. We present here a spatial deconvolution method which can recover some of the variation smoothed out by the averaging due to survey at altitude. We show that the method can recover the true spatial distribution of concentration of a synthetic source. We then apply the method to real aerial survey data collected following detonation of a radiological dispersal device. The findings and implications of the deconvolution are then discussed by reference to a groundbased truckborne survey over the same contamination.",Nutrient sulfur acquisition strategies employed by bacterial pathogens.,https://www.ncbi.nlm.nih.gov/pubmed/30530037,Current opinion in microbiology,2019 05 29,"Pathogens have evolved elegant mechanisms to acquire essential nutrients from host environments.

A growing body of evidence suggests that pathogens are capable of scavenging both types of sulfur sources to fulfill the nutritional requirement. While therapeutic strategies focusing on inhibiting inorganic sulfate assimilation and cysteine synthesis show promise in vitro, in vivo efficacy maybe limited due to the diversity of host-derived sulfur sources and the fact that most pathogens are capable of acquiring multiple sources of sulfur.",Interfacial uploading of luminescent hexamolybdenum cluster units onto amino-decorated silica nanoparticles as new design of nanomaterial for cellular imaging and photodynamic therapy.,https://www.ncbi.nlm.nih.gov/pubmed/30530036,Journal of colloid and interface science,2019 02 03,"The present work introduces a facile synthetic route to embed phosphorescent K2[{Mo6I8}I6] and (nBu4N)2[{Mo6I8}(CH3COO)6] clusters (C) onto silica-water interface of amino-decorated silica nanoparticles (SNs, 60 ± 6 nm).

High uptake capacity of the clusters (8700 of K2[{Mo6I8}I6] and 6500 of (nBu4N)2[{Mo6I8}(CH3COO)6] per the each nanoparticle) derives from ionic self-assembly and coordination bonds between the cluster complexes and ionic (amino- and siloxy-) groups at the silica surface. The coordination via amino- or siloxy-groups restricts aquation and hydrolysis of the embedded clusters, in comparison with the parent K2[{Mo6I8}I6] and (nBu4N)2[{Mo6I8}(CH3COO)6. High potential of the assembled nanoparticles in the ROS generation was revealed by EPR measurements facilitated by spin trapping. The high positive charge and convenient colloid stability of the assembled C-SNs hybrids are the prerequisite for their efficient cellular uptake, which is exemplified in the work by MCF-7 cell line. The measured dark and photoinduced cytotoxicity of the C-SNs hybrids reveals significant photodynamic therapy effect on the MCF-7 cancer cell line versus the normal cells.

MCNFs with surface O-functionalities were first constructed by morphology-conserved transformation of zinc-trimesic acid fibers, which provide scaffolds to anchor trisodium citrate-induced Ni-Co hydroxide nanosheets. Upon calcination, the resultant core-shell MCNF@NiCo2O4 nanostructures were fabricated and characterized by SEM, TEM, X-ray diffraction, Raman spectroscopy, thermogravimetric analysis (TGA), X-ray photoelectron spectroscopy (XPS) and N2 adsorption/desorption techniques. The anchored NiCo2O4 nanosheets were dense (75 wt%) but well-dispersed on the surface of MCNF (pore size 4.0 nm), and proved to be highly active and stable towards the reduction of 4-nitrophenol to 4-aminophenol. It showed a large activity factor of 2.53 s-1 g-1, exceeding most transition metal oxide catalysts, and MCNF@NiCo2O4 could be cycled at least 20 times without obvious loss of activity. Temperature-programmed desorption and reduction by hydrogen (H2-TPD and H2-TPR) studies showed that, the metal oxide dispersion and thereby the amount of H2 adsorbed were enhanced, and the interfacial interaction was also strengthened. These should be responsible for the excellent activity and stability of MCNF@NiCo2O4 towards 4-nitrophenol reduction."

O2 and SO2 were successfully co-doped onto carbon surface by applying non-thermal plasma technique. Porous carbon possessing excellent textural properties is effective to adsorb the radicals generated by plasma. Plasma promotes the adsorption of O2 and SO2 on carbon surface with the formation of abundant CO, C-S and C-SOx (x = 1-3) groups. The O2/SO2 dual-doped porous carbon was utilized to adsorb elemental mercury (Hg0) from the flue gas of coal combustion. The Hg0 adsorption ability of the O2/SO2 dual-doped porous carbon is closely related with the concentrations of O2 and SO2 for plasma treatment and the treatment time. The optimal O2/SO2 dual-doped porous carbon exhibited far greater Hg0 adsorption capacity than a commercial brominated activated carbon. Density functional theory was employed to understand the Hg0 adsorption mechanism at the molecular level. CO, C-S and C-SOx (x = 1-3) groups enhanced the interaction of Hg0 with surface carbon atom. The activity of them for enhancing Hg0 adsorption is in the order of C-SO2 >  CO > C-S > C-SO > C-SO3.

First, the selective deposition of CdS on {001} facets of TiO2 nanosheet ({001}TiO2/CdS) would form the Type-II heterostructure, which seriously weakened the redox ability of {001}TiO2/CdS and directly resulted in the low photocatalytic performance (4-Chlorophenol (4-CP), 61.92% in 40 min) and serious photocorrosion of CdS.

The hybrids were further modified by carbon nanodots (CDots) ({101}TiO2/CdS/CDots) to enhance photocatalytic performance (99.84%). The obtained direct Z-scheme {101}TiO2/CdS/CDots showed excellent stability and anti-photocorrosion ability. The synergistic effect between TiO2 nanosheet, CdS and CDots was expounded through characterization analyses, and the photocatalytic reaction mechanism was proposed in detail. Toxicity assessment authenticated good biocompatibility and low cytotoxicity of {101}TiO2/CdS/CDots. Our discovery was expected to drive great advances in the use of TiO2 nanosheet for environmental remediation.",The essentialness of glutathione reductase GorA for biosynthesis of Se(0)-nanoparticles and GSH for CdSe quantum dot formation in Pseudomonas stutzeri TS44.,https://www.ncbi.nlm.nih.gov/pubmed/30530022,Journal of hazardous materials,2019 02 17,"Pseudomonas stutzeri TS44 was able to aerobically reduce Se(IV) into SeNPs and transform Se(IV)/Cd(II) mixture into CdSe-QDs. The SeNPs and CdSe-QDs were systematically characterized by surface feature analyses, and the molecular mechanisms of SeNPs and CdSe-QD formation in P. stutzeri TS44 were characterized in detail. In vivo, under 2.5 mmol/L Se(IV) exposure, GorA was essential for catalyzing of Se(IV) reduction rate decreased by 67% when the glutathione reductase gene gorA was disrupted, but it was not decreased in the glutathione synthesis rate-limiting gene gshA mutated strain compared to the wild type. The complemented strains restored the phenotypes. While under low amount of Se(IV) (0.5 mmol/L), GSH played an important role for Se(IV) reduction. In vitro, GorA catalyzed Se(IV) reduction with NADPH as the electron donor (Vmax of 3.947 ± 0.1061 μmol/min/mg protein under pH 7.0 and 28℃). In addition, CdSe-QDs were successfully synthesized by a one-step method in which Se(IV) and Cd(II) were added to bacterial culture simultaneously. GSH rather than GorA is necessary for CdSe-QD formation in vivo and in vitro. In conclusion, the results provide new findings showing that GorA functions as a selenite reductase under high amount Se(IV) and GSH is essential for bacterial CdSe-QD synthesis.",Engineered biochar composite fabricated from red mud and lipid waste and synthesis of biodiesel using the composite.,https://www.ncbi.nlm.nih.gov/pubmed/30530021,Journal of hazardous materials,2019 02 17,"Co-pyrolysis of lipid waste and red mud was investigated to achieve valorization of red mud by fabricating biochar composite. For the further sustainable approach, this study intentionally employed carbon dioxide (CO2) as reaction medium in the co-pyrolysis process. The use of CO2 on co-pyrolysis of lipid waste and red mud enabled manipulation of the carbon distributions between pyrogenic products. CO2 expedited the thermal cracking of lipid waste and further reacted with lipid waste during the thermolysis. These mechanistic roles of CO2 were catalytically enhanced by the presence of mineral phases (Fe2O3) in red mud, thereby resulting in the enhanced formation of CO (40 times more at 550 °C). However, CO2 suppressed dehydrogenation of lipid waste (∼ 50%), which resulted in the different pathway for reducing iron oxide in red mud. Moreover, as an aspect of valorization of red mud, catalytic capability of biochar composite was evaluated. As a case study, biodiesel (FAMEs) were synthesized, and all experimental findings suggested that biochar composite could be an effective catalyst for biodiesel synthesis. As compare to biodiesel synthesis using silica (92% yield at 360 °C), the equivalent biodiesel yield was achieved with the biochar at much lower temperature (130 °C).",Experimental study on optimization models for evaluation of fireball characteristics and thermal hazards induced by LNG vapor Cloud explosions based on colorimetric thermometry.,https://www.ncbi.nlm.nih.gov/pubmed/30530020,Journal of hazardous materials,2019 02 17,"In order to facilitate transport, natural gas is cooled down by a cycle process of compression, condensation, expansion, and evaporation that transforms the gas into a liquid form, as known as Liquefied Natural Gas (LNG). However, once any leak happens in the transportation pipeline, it will result in serious thermal radiant damage due to the explosion fireball induced by LNG Vapor cloud explosions. In this work, an optimization fireball model is proposed by introducing the atmospheric transmission rate τ into the original TNO dynamic model. Based on the colorimetric thermometry technology, a full-scale LNG pipeline explosion experiment has been conducted and a series of testing data for the thermal radiant by VCEs' fireball have been obtained. It is found that theoretical predictions by using optimization model agree well with experimental data. According to the thermal radiant damage criterion, it is concluded that a near 100% fatality radius is expected within the range of 266.3 m and there is a safety area with an ellipse diameter of 1180.1 m. This work attempts to develop optimization fireball models to predict the thermal radiant damage more accurately, and improve the performance of risk assessment on LNG transport and storage industrial process.",Calorimetry of explosive thermal decomposition of graphite oxide.,https://www.ncbi.nlm.nih.gov/pubmed/30530019,Journal of hazardous materials,2019 02 17,"Graphite oxide (GO) has shown immense potential in energy storage and composite filler applications, and large-scale production of GO is of increasing commercial and academic interest. However, prior studies show that GO has the potential to undergo explosive decomposition. In this study, Advanced Reactive System Screening Tool was used to track the temperature and pressure of the explosive decomposition of GO. The data showed that the explosive decomposition temperature of GO strongly depends on sample size. The temperature and pressure generation are on the order of 1000s of °C per minute and 1000s of psig per minute respectively for less than a gram of material. Therefore, the rapid decomposition of bulk GO can lead to catastrophic consequences. The paper further compared the thermal stability of GO from different sources and found that the GO surface area has significant effects on GO stability. Finally, the Frank-Kamenetskii model was used to predict the critical mass necessary for GO to undergo explosive decomposition, the model predicted the mass within a factor of experimental data. The results of this study are beneficial in assessing and predicting the hazards of bulk GO during storage and handling.",Biogenic magnetite nanoparticles: A potent and environmentally benign agent for efficient removal of azo dyes and phenolic contaminants from water.,https://www.ncbi.nlm.nih.gov/pubmed/30530018,Journal of hazardous materials,2019 02 17,"A comprehensive study was conducted toward the green and facile synthesis of biocompatible magnetite nanoparticles for the efficient removal of organic contaminants from water. The nanoparticles were synthesized using a modified co-precipitation method and functionalized by the taxane diterpenoids extracted from Taxus baccata L., and fully characterized using UV-vis spectroscopy, SEM, FTIR, VSM, and XRD. The synthesized monodisperse magnetite nanoparticles, with a narrow size distribution of less than 50 nm, displayed significant and stable magnetic activity without surface oxidation after several months. The batch experiments clearly indicated the efficient iron-catalyzed removal of Nile blue, methylene blue, methylene orange, and 4-nitrophenol for several cycles without significant loss of catalytic activity. The relevant kinetic data of the dyes removal reactions were fitted to a pseudo-first order model. Moreover, in vitro MTT assay revealed high biocompatibility of the nanoparticles with no significant toxicity on different human cell lines. The overall results indicated high potential of green synthesized, biocompatible magnetite nanoparticles for the environmental applications especially wastewater remediation.",H-bonding effect of oxyanions enhanced photocatalytic degradation of sulfonamides by g-C3N4 in aqueous solution.,https://www.ncbi.nlm.nih.gov/pubmed/30530017,Journal of hazardous materials,2019 02 17,"In this study, the effect of oxyanions on the photodegradation of sulfonamides by graphitic carbon nitride (g-C3N4) was investigated. The results showed that the presence of disilicate (DS) could substantially improve the photodegradation of sulfamethazine (SMZ) in g-C3N4 aqueous suspension. The primary mechanism for the enhancing effect of DS was hydrogen bonding (H-bonding) interaction. The hydroxyl groups (OH) and bridging oxygen (SiOSi) of DS can form H-bonds with the amine groups of g-C3N4 particles and sulfonamides, therefore soluble DS can act as a bridge to enhance the transfer and adsorption of SMZ onto the surface of g-C3N4 particles. The presence of DS did not change the mechanism of photodegradation, but there was an optimal concentration for DS to achieve the strongest enhancing effect. H-bonding effect was also found for other oxyanions derived from weak acids, such as silicate, dihydrogen phosphate and borate ions, because the partial ionization of these oxyanions allowed the existence of hydroxyl groups to form H-bonds. The present study not only deepens our understanding of the interface process of the photodegradation of sulfonamides in g-C3N4 aqueous suspension, but also provides a potential method to enhance the photocatalytic degradation of antibiotics in wastewater streams.",Performance of Cu-cathode/Fe3+/peroxymonosulfate process on iohexol degradation.,https://www.ncbi.nlm.nih.gov/pubmed/30530016,Journal of hazardous materials,2019 02 17,"Copper was used as a non-inert cathode material in a Cathode/Fe3+/peroxymonosulfate(PMS) system, and the performance of this novel Cu-cathode/Fe3+/PMS system was tested with a typical iodinated X-ray contrast media (iohexol) as target organics. The reaction mechanisms and the iohexol degradation pathways were investigated. The operational conditions of Cu-cathode/Fe3+/PMS process on iohexol degradation were optimized to be 1.0 mM Fe3+ dosage, 3.0 mM PMS dosage and 0.50 mA/cm2 of current input. The much lower current applied in the present study than previous reports would help to save energy and be more economical. Compared with typical inert cathode (Pt-cathode), the Cu-cathode/Fe3+/PMS process has better performance on both iohexol removal and deiodination, due to that Cu-cathode participated in Fe2+ regeneration and PMS activation via surface Cu°-Cu+(s)-Cu2+-Cu° redox cycle. Fe2+ could be produced via reactions between Fe3+ and Cu/Cu+(s) as well as cathodic reduction of Fe3+. SO4- was generated from PMS activation by Fe2+, Cu/Cu+(s) and cathodic reduction. OH was also generated in this process but SO4- played a dominant role in iohexol degradation. The intermediate products of iohexol and its transformation pathways were complex due to the varied reaction mechanisms involving both oxidation and reduction in Cu-cathode/Fe3+/PMS process.",Structural defects in 2D MoS2 nanosheets and their roles in the adsorption of airborne elemental mercury.,https://www.ncbi.nlm.nih.gov/pubmed/30530015,Journal of hazardous materials,2019 02 17,"In this research, ab initio calculations and experimental approach were adopted to reveal the mechanism of Hg0 adsorption on MoS2 nanosheets that contain various types of defects. The ab initio calculation showed that, among different structural defects, S vacancies (Vs) in the MoS2 nanosheets exhibited outstanding potential to strongly adsorb Hg0. The MoS2 material was then prepared in a controlled manner under conditions, such as temperature, concentration of precursors, etc., that were determined by adopting the new method developed in this study. Characterisation confirmed that the MoS2 material is of graphene-like layered structure with abundant structural defects. The integrated dynamic and steady state (IDSS) testing demonstrated that the Vs-rich nanosheets showed excellent Hg0 adsorption capability. In addition, ab initial calculation on charge density difference, PDOS, and adsorption pathways revealed that the adsorption of Hg0 on the Vs-rich MoS2 surface is non-activated chemisorption."

B, Biointerfaces",2019 06 13,"Porous CaCO3 microparticles are considered as one of the most popular and effective carriers for protein loading. Most of current studies have centered on elucidating particle formation and enhancing the protein loading efficiency, very few reports on the kinetics, driving forces and factors on protein loading process. Here, we took lysozyme as the basic model protein to investigate the kinetics, driving forces on protein loading and factors controlling loading efficiency into porous Hep/CaCO3 microparticles by various techniques (protein quantification assay, QCM-D, SEM, BET, Zeta sizer, TGA, CLSM, CD spectrum, bioactive assay). As revealed, the adsorption process obeyed the pseudo second-order kinetics and Langmuir adsorption model. Doping heparin greatly influenced the detailed texture, pore size, surface area, and maximum loading capacity of lysozyme (LCLys,m). The dependence of LCLys,m on pH reflected the electrostatic interaction mainly contributed to lysozyme adsorption, especially below IEP of lysozyme. But the hydrophobic interaction also played the critical role on lysozyme adsorption at pH around IEP of lysozyme. Accompanying with pH change, the lysozyme orientation shifted from ""side on"" at lower pH to ""end on"" at pH around IEP. At proper concentration of NaCl (CNaCl), the loaded lysozyme could be released from Hep/CaCO3 microparticles, making them available for lysozyme reloading. Most importantly, such release-reloading cycle didn't disturb the bioactivity of released lysozyme and following reloading ability. We believe our work will contribute to understand protein adsorption behaviors, improve protein loading efficacy, biomaterials design, tissue engineering and disease treatment.",A carefully designed nanoplatform based on multi walled carbon nanotube wrapped with aptamers.,https://www.ncbi.nlm.nih.gov/pubmed/30530003,"Colloids and surfaces. B, Biointerfaces",2019 06 13,"The interaction between carbon nanotubes (CNTs) and biological molecules of diagnostic and therapeutic interest, as well as the internalization of the CNTs-biomolecules complexes in different types of cell, has been extensively studied due to the potential use of these nanocomplexes as multifunctional nanoplatforms in a great variety of biomedical applications. The effective use of these nanobiotechnologies requires broad multidisciplinary studies of biocompatibility, regarding, for example, the in vitro and in vivo nanotoxicological assays, the capacity to target specific cells and the evaluation of their biomedical potential. However, the first step to be reached is the careful obtainment of the nanoplatform and the understanding of the actual surface composition and structural integrity of the complex system. In this work, we show the detailed construction of a nanoplatform created by the noncovalent interaction between oxidized multi walled carbon nanotubes (MWCNTs) and a DNA aptamer targeting tumor cells. The excess free aptamer was removed by successive washes, revealing the actual surface of the nanocomplex. The MWCNT-aptamer interaction by π-stacking was evidenced and shown to contribute in obtaining a stable nanocomplex compatible with aqueous media having good cell viability. The nucleotide sequence of the aptamer remained intact after the functionalization, allowing its use in further studies of specificity and binding affinity and for the construction of functional nanoplatforms.",Clotrimazole multiple W/O/W emulsion as anticandidal agent: Characterization and evaluation on skin and mucosae.,https://www.ncbi.nlm.nih.gov/pubmed/30530002,"Colloids and surfaces. B, Biointerfaces",2019 06 03,"Clotrimazole (CLT) was formulated in a multiple W/O/W emulsion (ME) with the aim of evaluating its potential as topical anticandidal agent and comparing with marketed products. A previously evaluated CLT-ME was selected and physicochemically characterized. The in vitro release behavior and the ex vivo permeation profiles were assessed using Franz diffusion cells using three different types of biological membranes: human skin and porcine buccal, sublingual and vaginal mucosae. The antifungal activity against Candida strains was also tested. Results showed CLT-MEs sizes of 29.206 and 47.678 μm with skin compatible pH values of 6.47 and 6.42 exhibiting high zeta potential values of -55.13 and -55.59 mV with dependence on the pH variation. The physicochemical stability was kept for a period of 180 days of storage at room temperature. CLT-MEs exhibited pseudoplastic behavior with hysteresis areas and viscosities of 286 and 331 mPa⋅s showing higher spreadability properties than commercial counterparts. An improved CLT release pattern was supplied by the ME system following a hyperbolic model. Likewise, ME system gave higher skin permeation flux of CLT than commercial reference. CLT amounts retained in the skin and mucosae were also higher than commercial references, which coupled with the higher antimycotic efficacy make CLT-MEs a great tool for clinical investigation of topical candidiasis treatments.",Study on MgxSr3-x(PO4)2 bioceramics as potential bone grafts.,https://www.ncbi.nlm.nih.gov/pubmed/30530001,"Colloids and surfaces. B, Biointerfaces",2019 06 03,"Magnesium (Mg) and strontium (Sr), which are essential nutrient elements in the natural bone, positively affect the osteogenic activity even in wide ranges of ion concentrations. However, it remains unknown whether magnesium-strontium phosphates [MgxSr3-x(PO4)2] are potential bone grafts for accelerating bone regeneration. Herein, a serial of MgxSr3-x(PO4)2, including Mg3(PO4)2, Mg2Sr(PO4)2, Mg1.5Sr1.5(PO4)2, MgSr2(PO4)2 and Sr3(PO4)2, were synthesized using a solid-state reaction approach. The physicochemical properties and cell behaviors of MgxSr3-x(PO4)2 bioceramics were characterized and compared with the common bone graft β-tricalcium phosphate (β-TCP). The results indicated that various MgxSr3-x(PO4)2 bioceramics differed in compressive strength and in vitro degradation rate. All the MgxSr3-x(PO4)2 bioceramics had excellent biocompatibility. In contrast to β-TCP, the MgxSr3-x(PO4)2 enhanced alkaline phosphatase activity of mouse bone mesenchymal stem cells (mBMSCs), and inhibited osteoclastogenesis-related gene expression of RAW264.7 cells, but did not enhance osteogenesis-related gene expression of mBMSCs which were treated with osteogenesis induction supplements. However, Mg3(PO4)2 stimulated osteogenesis-related gene expression of mBMSCs without the treatment of osteogenesis induction supplements. This work contributes to the design of bone graft and may open a new avenue for the bone regeneration field.",Topical gel of Metformin solid lipid nanoparticles: A hopeful promise as a dermal delivery system.,https://www.ncbi.nlm.nih.gov/pubmed/30530000,"Colloids and surfaces. B, Biointerfaces",2019 06 03,"The aim of the present study was to enhance the skin delivery of metformin by making solid lipid nanoparticles containing metformin using the ultra-sonication method. To achieve the optimum skin delivery for metformin, the effects of the ratio of two surfactants (Tween:Span) on nanoparticles properties and their performance were investigated. Photon correlation spectroscopy, scanning electron microscopy (SEM), Powder X-ray Diffractometer (PXRD), Fourier transform infrared spectroscopy (FTIR) and differential scanning calorimetry (DSC) were used to characterize the solid state of metformin in solid lipid nanoparticles. Generally, the particle size of nanoparticles decreased by the addition of co-emulsifier (Span®60). Results showed that all formulations made by binary mixtures of surfactants had low particle size, low Polydispersity index and high zeta potential. It was interesting to note that the smallest nanoparticles (203.8 ± 15.356) was obtained when the HLB of the binary surfactants (HLB of 11.67) was closer to the HLB of beeswax (HLB of 12) used in the preparation of SLN. It was also found that by decreasing the HLB of the system from 14.9 to 10.06 the zeta potential of SLNs increased from -0.651 ± 0.315 to -6.18 ± 0.438 mV. But, a further reduction in the HLB from 10.06 to 8.45 caused a reduction in the zeta potential from -6.18 to -3.596 ± 0.255. Results showed that the highest entrapment efficiency of 45.98 ± 9.20% was obtained for formulation with larger particle size and with the highest HLB value (HLB 14.9). DSC study showed that metformin in SLN is in an amorphous form. FT-IR spectra of Met-SLN showed that the prominent functional groups existed in the formulations which could be an indication of good entrapment of metformin in a lipid matrix. FT-IR results also ruled out any chemical interaction between the drug and the excipients. The amounts of metformin detected in the skin layers and the receptor chamber at all sampling times were higher for nanogel compared to metformin gel. This is an indication of a better performance of Metformin nanogel ex-vivo and could be developed further for clinical studies.",Enhanced oral bioavailability and brain uptake of Darunavir using lipid nanoemulsion formulation.,https://www.ncbi.nlm.nih.gov/pubmed/30529999,"Colloids and surfaces. B, Biointerfaces",2019 06 03,"The present work aimed to formulate Darunavir loaded lipid nanoemulsion to increase its oral bioavailability and enhance brain uptake. Various batches of lipid nanoemulsion of Darunavir were prepared by high pressure homogenization using soya bean oil, egg lecithin and Tween 80. The optimized batch DNE-3 had globule size of 109.5 nm, zeta potential of -41.1 mV, entrapment efficiency 93% and creaming volume 98%. The batch remained stable at 4 °C for 1 month with an insignificant change in globule size and zeta potential (P > 0.05). In-vivo pharmacokinetics male wistar rats indicated 223% bioavailability of Darunavir relative to drug suspension. Cmax of DNE-3 was twofold higher than suspension form. The organ biodistribution study indicated 2.65 fold higher brain uptake for DNE-3 than that for suspension. The higher bioavailability of Darunavir from nanoemulsion could lessen the dose related side effects. Moreover, high organ distribution results in passive uptake of Darunavir to HIV reservoir organs.",Evaluation of a drug and alcohol safety education program in aviation using interrupted time series and the Kirkpatrick framework.,https://www.ncbi.nlm.nih.gov/pubmed/30529998,Evaluation and program planning,2019 03 11,"Compliance with drug and alcohol regulations are required by 14 CFR Part 120/ and 49 CFR Part 40.

Front End Analysis (FEA) was conducted to determine specific performance problems and provide five tailored educational interventions to address them. Program evaluation was conducted using Interrupted Time Series (ITS) modeling. Results showed significant (p < .05) decreases in nonconformities across all five models with small to moderate effect sizes. Based on the relative effects, values for reductions in civil penalty costs between 16% and 47%, were predicted. Actual sanction reductions from the pre-to-post-intervention periods were confirmed to be 24.21%.

Seminal plasma is a highly complex biological fluid containing proteins, amino acids, enzymes, fructose and other carbohydrates, lipids, major minerals and trace elements. Seminal plasma proteins are involved in regulation of osmotic pressure and pH of seminal plasma, transport of ions, lipid and hormones. The objective was to compare sperm and seminal plasma proteomes of bulls with differing fertility and to relate differences to biological processes. Semen was collected from bulls with high or low fertility (4 bulls in each category). Sperm and seminal plasma proteins were isolated, purified, subjected to 2-D gel electrophoresis, protein identification and ontology. In sperm and seminal plasma, binder of sperm proteins (BSP)-1, -3 and -5, and spermadhesin-1, ALB, TIMP, AKI and PEBP1 were higher for high-versus low-fertility bulls (P < 0.05), whereas proteins CLU, CCT5 and 8, ELSPbP1, and PSMA6 were more abundant in sperm and seminal plasma of low- versus high-fertility bulls (P < 0.05). Further, HSP90, ZFP34, IFNRF4, BCL62, NADHD, TUBB3 and Histone H1 were in greater abundance in sperm of high- compared with low-fertility bulls. The two key biological processes of proteins differentially expressed in high- and low-fertility bulls were metabolic processes and biological regulation. The most prominent molecular functions for proteins that differed are binding, catalytic and receptor activities. The main cellular components for proteins that differed are cellular, extracellular, and plasma membrane. Since protein content differed in high- versus low-fertility bulls, we inferred that the efficiency of associated sperm functions that are necessary for fertility may also differ between high- and low-fertility semen. In conclusion, differences between high- and low-fertility bulls regarding abundance of sperm and seminal plasma proteins likely contributed to differences in fertility.",Effects of ammonia nitrogen on gill mitochondria in clam Ruditapes philippinarum.,https://www.ncbi.nlm.nih.gov/pubmed/30529996,Environmental toxicology and pharmacology,2019 02 15,"Ammonia nitrogen exposure has been found to significantly increase the early apoptosis rates of gill cells, affect the contents of ATP and disturb expressions of calcium-related genes in clam Ruditapes philippinarum. Mitochondria are the centers for energy production, initiation of apoptosis and calcium signal regulation. It is hypothesized that gill mitochondrion is a target organelle for the ammonia nitrogen. Thus, ATP metabolism together with ATP-consuming functions would be interfered by ammonia exposure. In the present study, mitochondrial transmembrane potential (MTP), ATPase activities, gill functions in clearance and respiration, and histological changes were detected to characterize the effects of ammonia to the gill mitochondria in clam R. philippinarum. Results indicated that ammonia exposure led to significant decreases in MTP, Ca2+-ATPase activity and clearance rates. However, different concentrations of ammonia nitrogen induced different variations on H+, K+-ATPase activity and respiration rates. Histological observation revealed that subacute exposure of ammonia damaged the microstructure of gill tissues. Therefore, ammonia exposure dramatically damaged the normal structure and function of mitochondria, resulting in irreversible damage in energy formation and supply. In addition, it affected Ca2+ and K+ metabolism and inhibited food intake and respiration in clam R. philippinarum.",Psychometric properties of a Chinese version of the Brief Young Adult Alcohol Consequences Questionnaire (B-YAACQ).,https://www.ncbi.nlm.nih.gov/pubmed/30529995,Addictive behaviors,2019 01 08,This study evaluated the psychometric properties of the Chinese version of the Brief Young Adult Alcohol Consequences Questionnaire (B-YAACQ).

A decellularised porcine superflexor tendon (pSFT) has been developed previously as an alternative to current reconstruction methods and subjected to biomechanical analysis. The application of varied strain rates to biological tissues is known to alter their biomechanical properties, however the effects of decellularisation on strain rate dependent and dynamic mechanical behaviour of tissues have not been explored. This study utilised tensile testing to investigate the material properties of native and decellularised pSFTs at three different strain rates (1%.s-1, 10%.s-1 and 100%.s-1). In addition, dynamic mechanical analysis (DMA) was used to ascertain the relative contributions of the solid and fluid phase components of the tissues. Ultimate tensile strength was significantly reduced in decellularised compared with native untreated pSFTs but was unaffected by strain rate. In contrast, toe region moduli increased with increasing strain rate for native tissues, but this effect was not observed in decellularised pSFTs. Linear region moduli were unaffected by strain rate, but were significantly reduced in decellularised pSFT compared with native tissue. Following DMA, significant reductions in dynamic modulus, storage modulus and loss modulus were seen in decellularised compared with native pSFT. Interestingly, the damping ability of the tendons was unaffected by decellularisation, suggesting that solid and fluid phases of the tissue were affected equally. These results, alongside previous studies, suggest that decellularisation affects collagen crimp, tissue swelling and collagen fibre sliding. However, despite these findings, the biomechanical properties of decellularised pSFT remain sufficient to act as an off-the-shelf solution for ACL reconstruction.",The denticulate ligament - Tensile characterisation and finite element micro-scale model of the structure stabilising spinal cord.,https://www.ncbi.nlm.nih.gov/pubmed/30529981,Journal of the mechanical behavior of biomedical materials,2019 02 02,"Damage to the spinal cord is one of the most debilitating pathologies with considerable health, economic and social impact. Improved prevention, treatment and rehabilitation after spinal cord injury (SCI) requires the complex biomechanics of the spinal cord with all its structural elements and the injury mechanism to be understood. This comprehensive understanding will also allow development of models and tools enabling better diagnosis, surgical treatment with increased safety and efficacy and possible development of regenerative therapies. The denticulate ligaments play an important role in stabilising spinal cord within the spinal canal. They participate in spinal cord movements and play a role in determining the stress distribution during physiological but also traumatic loading. We present detailed tensile characterisation of the denticulate ligaments and a Finite Element micro-scale model of the ligament relating its structure with the distribution of stress under physiological loading.",In vitro differentiation of tracheary elements is induced by suppression of Arabidopsis phytoglobins.,https://www.ncbi.nlm.nih.gov/pubmed/30529980,Plant physiology and biochemistry : PPB,2019 01 22,"Differentiation of tracheary elements (TEs) in vitro was affected by the expression level of the Arabidopsis thaliana Col-0 phytoglobins (Pgbs). Over-expression of Pgb1 or Pgb2 (35S:Pgb1 or 35S:Pgb2 lines) reduced the differentiation process while suppression of either Pgb (Pgb1-RNAi or pgb2 lines) enhanced the production of TEs. The inductive effect of Pgb suppression on TE differentiation was linked to the reduced expression of the transcription factor MYC2. Suppression of this gene, observed under conditions of high NO levels or low Pgb expression, was sufficient to promote TE differentiation, while its over-expression abolished the promotive effect of Pgb suppression on the differentiation process. Cells in which MYC2 was mutated accumulated ethylene which induced the expression of the homeodomain-leucine zipper (HD-Zip) III ATHB8. Production of ethylene was reduced in cells over-expressing MYC2 in a WT or a pgb mutant background. While stabilizing procambial cell specification, ATHB8 in known to activate downstream components triggering programmed cell death (PCD) and modifications of cell wall components, required steps of the TE differentiation process. Collectively, we provide evidence that in addition to their recognised participation in stress responses, Pgbs may play a key role in the specification of cell fate during development.","The involvement of a herbivore-induced acyl-CoA oxidase gene, CsACX1, in the synthesis of jasmonic acid and its expression in flower opening in tea plant (Camellia sinensis).",https://www.ncbi.nlm.nih.gov/pubmed/30529979,Plant physiology and biochemistry : PPB,2019 01 22,"The biosynthesis of jasmonic acid (JA) in plant peroxisomes requires the action of acyl-CoA oxidase (ACX; EC 1.3.3.6). Multiple isoforms of ACXs have been identified in various annual herbaceous plants, but the genes encoding these enzymes in perennial woody plants are yet to be fully investigated. In this study, an ACX gene named CsACX1 (GeneBank accession: KX650077.1) was isolated from tea plant (Camellia sinensis L.). CsACX1 was predicted to consist of 664 amino acid residues. Transcriptional analysis revealed that CsACX1 can be induced by mechanical wounding, JA application, and infestation by the tea geometrid Ectropis obliqua Prout and the tea green leafhopper Empoasca (Matsumurasca) onukii Matsuda. To further elucidate the function of CsACX1, it was heterologously expressed in a bacterial system and characterized. Recombinant CsACX1 showed preference for C12 ∼ C16-CoA substrates. The constitutive expression of CsACX1 can rescue wound-related JA biosynthesis in Arabidopsis mutant acx1. CsACX1 was expressed in different organs, predominantly in flowers. Notably, CsACX1 transcripts were detected up-regulated during flower opening, and the JA levels were correlated with CsACX1 expression. All these results enrich our knowledge of the regulatory pathway involved in the JA biosynthesis in tea, and helps further understand the defense mechanism of tea plant against insects.","Fatty acids, triterpenes and cycloalkanes in ficus seed oils.",https://www.ncbi.nlm.nih.gov/pubmed/30529978,Plant physiology and biochemistry : PPB,2019 01 22,"The compositions of the seed oils obtained by hexane extraction of three members of the Ficus genus of the Moraceae plant family was determined, namely Ficus nota, Ficus septica, Ficus ulmifolia. Linolenic acid is the most prominent fatty acid in the seed oils followed by linoleic acid, with these two fatty acid comprising about 75% of the fatty acids in the oils. The high level of polyunsaturated fatty acids coincides with high levels of these acids predominating among the fatty acids observed in various plant parts of other Ficus species. Besides the fatty acids, a variety of phytochemicals also found in other plant parts of Ficus species were observed in the seed oils, including squalene, pentacyclic triterpenes such as α-amyrin, β-amyrin and lupeol, as well as sterols such as cholesterol and γ-sitosterol, the former at unusually elevated levels. The levels of these phytochemicals vary from species to species and location of harvest, with F. ulmifolia showing by far the highest level of these materials and with α-amyrin, β-amyrin and lupeol being the most common, their amounts exceeding those of fatty acids for samples from one specific location.

Intriguingly, glucose has emerged as a crucial signaling molecule where hexokinase1 acts as the conserved glucose sensor. On the molecular scale, an extensive crosstalk between glucose and phytohormone signaling has been observed where glucose signals trigger multiple hexokinase1-dependent as well as hexokinase1-independent pathways to mediate diverse developmental, physiological and molecular mechanisms.

In this manner, mindfulness training has found its way into the realm of government, with parliamentary programmes seeding ambition amongst politicians to research and employ its transformative potential at both interpersonal and policy levels. In a high-stakes, adversarial setting, mindfulness practice helps elected representatives to cope with specific challenges, and an inquiry by the UK Mindfulness All-Party Parliamentary Group has contributed to the emergence of mindfulness training in numerous policy narratives. By developing a new kind of familiarity with their own inner lives, a growing number of politicians are finding a new way to approach political discourse, and a corresponding enthusiasm for policy that tackles society's problems at the level of the human heart and mind. Some are starting to ask whether mindfulness might be more than a targeted intervention for specific issues, and may in fact contribute to the flourishing of society more broadly - marking an important development from concern with individual benefits to benefits for the whole.","The future of mindfulness training is digital, and the future is now.",https://www.ncbi.nlm.nih.gov/pubmed/30529975,Current opinion in psychology,2019 05 23,"Digital mindfulness-based interventions (d-MBIs) present a promising path for the scalable dissemination of mindfulness instruction in the 21st century.

It is critical for the global sustainable development by decoupling economic growth from carbon emissions at country level, specifically for the largest emitter, China. This study conducts a decoupling analysis from the perspective of carbon intensity (CI), per capita carbon emissions (PC) and total carbon emissions (TC) with reference to 30 Chinese provinces, covering the period of 2001-2015. Based on the Log Mean Divisa Index (LMDI) method, the effects of energy structure (ES), energy intensity (EI), economic output (EO) and population size (P) on TC at provincial level are investigated. Results show that: (1) a strong decoupling relation between GDP and CI is found in most provinces except Hainan, Qinghai and Xinjiang, while there is large room for China to decouple completely from PC and TC; (2) EO and EI are the dominated inhibiting and promoting factors respectively for carbon emission reduction; (3) ES effect on increasing carbon emission changes between positive and negative, while P has a positive but insignificant effect on the increase of carbon emissions for most provinces. The results help local governments formulate measures to coordinate regional economic development and carbon emission reduction.",Areas under high ozone and nitrogen loads are spatially disjunct in Czech forests.,https://www.ncbi.nlm.nih.gov/pubmed/30529961,The Science of the total environment,2019 02 21,"It is widely accepted that excessive loads of nitrogen (N) deposition and ambient ozone (O3) endanger natural ecosystems and the environment. Despite substantial reductions in emissions since the early 1990s both in the Czech Republic and in neighbouring countries, neither O3 exposures nor N deposition have yet decreased to acceptable levels relative to the recommended thresholds. Based on long-term monitoring and high-quality data, we have indicated the areas of special risk due to high N deposition and O3 exposures in Czech forests in 2000-2015. The areas of potential risk denote those forests under the highest loads of N deposition and O3 exposure on a regular basis. The underlying classification approach is relativistic, i.e. based ultimately on quartiles of pollution intensities and not derived from critical limits or loads. The forest areas under the highest O3 exposures and N deposition are spatially disjunct. The highest O3 exposures are in the southern and the highest N deposition is in the northern Czech Republic. In contrast to our assumption, only 1322 km2, i.e. 4.6% of the total forested area (28,782 km2) are overlapping areas with a potential risk due both to high O3 exposures and to N deposition. Our results provide valuable input information for a more detailed environmental analysis, anticipated in the future, addressing to what extent the indicated areas at potential risk are associated with the actual negative impacts on forests.",Constructed wetlands combined with disinfection systems for removal of urban wastewater contaminants.,https://www.ncbi.nlm.nih.gov/pubmed/30529960,The Science of the total environment,2019 02 21,"The removal efficiency of an urban wastewater treatment plant (WWTP) to obtain an effluent suitable for agriculture reuse was evaluated in a one-year period, taking into account the Italian wastewater limits and the recent European proposal for the minimum requirements water quality for agricultural irrigation. The secondary effluent of WWTP was treated by three full-scale horizontal sub-surface flow (H-SSF) constructed wetlands (CWs), working in parallel, planted with different macrophytes species, and combined with a UV device and a lagooning system running in series. The H-SSF CW system effectively reduced physico-chemical pollutants and its efficiency was steady over the investigation period, while, Escherichia coli densities always exceed the Italian limits required for wastewater reuse in agriculture. The UV system significantly reduced the microbiological indicators, eliminating E. coli, in compliance with the Italian regulation, and somatic coliphages, although a variable efficacy against total coliforms and enterococci, especially in winter season, was achieved. Although the lagooning unit provides a high removal of the main microbial groups, it did not reduce physico-chemical parameters. Even if the overall performance target, for the whole treatment chain, met the recent log10 reduction (≥5.0), required by the European Commission, the persistence of enterococci, especially in winter season, poses a matter of concern for public health, for the potential risk to serve as a genetic reservoir of transferable antibiotic-resistance.",Determining groundwater recharge and vapor flow in dune sediments using a weighable precision meteo lysimeter.,https://www.ncbi.nlm.nih.gov/pubmed/30529959,The Science of the total environment,2019 01 31,"Dune belts are crucial for the recharge of coastal aquifers. In spite of their hydrological relevance for the maintenance of precious natural wetland and wildlife environments and a range of other ecosystem services, only limited knowledge of soil water dynamics in dune belts is currently available. This study presents soil water balance components measured during one hydrological year using a high precision meteo-lysimeter with lower boundary control installed in a coastal dune belt under a dry subhumid climate in southern Spain close to the Atlantic Ocean. The site is equipped with a cylindrical lysimeter of 1 m2 surface and 1.50 m height (METER Group, Inc. USA) and a weighing resolution of 10 g, 2 SC650 soil moisture sensors (Campbell Scientific, Logan, UT) and 1 automatic meteorological station. The lower boundary condition at the bottom of the lysimeter is controlled at 1.4 m depth by a bidirectional peristaltic pump to maintain field conditions. Results show a recharge rate of 64% of the precipitation measured by the lysimeter. Diurnal oscillations of the measured upper boundary flow during days without rainfall represented vapor adsorption and real evaporation rates ranging between 0.3 and 0.4 mm/day and 0.4 and 0.6 mm/day, respectively throughout the whole year summing up an annual vapor adsorption of 77 mm. The measured precipitation of the lysimeter exceeded pluviometer data by 13% as a result of vapor adsorption.

Recent research revealed generation of a variety of halogenated organics during online chemical cleaning of MBR with sodium hypochlorite (NaClO) which has been commonly practiced for fouling control and permeability recovery of MBR. These exogenous halogenated organics may likely migrate into natural water bodies and soils through the discharge of MBR permeate, while they tend to bioaccumulate in aquatic food chains (e.g. aquatic animals and plants), leading to a dangerous concentration level for human health. It should be realized that the potent environmental and public health risks associated with produced halogenated organics in MBR permeate have not yet been aware and assessed in consideration of the entire water life cycles.

This study aims to investigate the potential exposure to benzene, toluene, ethylbenzene and xylenes (BTEX) compounds among workers of composting facilities by measuring un-metabolized BTEX in urine and to investigate the effect that several lifestyle factors (i.e. smoking and residential traffic), using personal protective equipment, and religious practices such as Ramadan fasting can have on the urinary BTEX concentrations. We assessed concentrations of BTEX in the urine of a composting facility workers. Samples were collected in May 2018. Overall, 25 workers chosen as the exposed group and 20 inhabitants living close to the composting facility as a control group. The urine samples were collected from studied subjects. Identification and quantification of un-metabolized BTEX was performed using a headspace gas chromatography-mass spectrometry (GC-MS). Detailed information of participants was gathered by a comprehensive questionnaire. The geometric mean levels of urinary benzene, toluene, ethylbenzene, m‑p xylene, and o‑xylene in the exposed subjects were 1.27, 2.12, 0.54, 1.22 and 1.51 μg/L, respectively; 1.4 to 3.7-time higher than values in control group (p < 0.05). Post-shift levels were significantly higher than pre-shift for all chemicals (p < 0.05). Smoking habits, exposure to environmental tobacco smoke, and Ramadan fasting predicted urinary BTEX levels. Personal protective equipment which included a simple N95 mask did not protected workers from BTEX emissions. Composting facilities represent a significant source BTEX emissions and exposure for staff. More effective protective strategies are required to minimize exposure and related occupational hazards.",Microalgae biochar-derived carbon dots and their application in heavy metal sensing in aqueous systems.,https://www.ncbi.nlm.nih.gov/pubmed/30529956,The Science of the total environment,2019 02 21,"This research seeks a coupled solution for managing the large amounts of biochar produced by microalgae biofuel production, and the necessity for novel, economic and accurate heavy metal sensing methods. Therefore, this study evaluated the transformation of microalgae biochar (MAB) into carbon dots (Cdots) and their subsequent application as heavy metal ion sensors in aqueous systems. The experimental phase included the transformation of MAB into microalgae biochar-derived carbon dots (MAB-Cdots), MAB-Cdot characterisation and the evaluation of the MAB-Cdots as transducers for the detection of four heavy metal ions (Pb2+, Cu2+, Cd2+, and Ni2+). MAB-Cdot fluorescence was stable over a wide range of pH and resistant to photo-bleaching, making them suitable as fluorescence probes. The MAB-Cdot fluorescence was quenched by all of the metal ions and displayed different quenching levels. Depending upon the ions involved, MAB-Cdots were used to detect the presence of heavy metal ions from concentrations of 0.012 μM up to 2 mM by measuring the reduction in fluorescence intensity. Neutral and slightly alkaline pHs were optimal for Cu2+ Ni2+ and Pb2+ heavy metal quenching. To quantify the concentration of the heavy metal ions, linear and logarithmic functions were used to model the MAB-Cdot fluorescence quenching. The sensing mechanism was determined to be reversible and purely collisional with some fluorophores less accessible than the others. This work demonstrated the ability to produce Cdots from microalgae biochar, examined their application as a transducer for detecting heavy metal ions in aqueous systems and paves the way for novel sensing systems using MAB-Cdots.","Molecular characteristics, proton dissociation properties, and metal binding properties of soil organic matter: A theoretical study.",https://www.ncbi.nlm.nih.gov/pubmed/30529955,The Science of the total environment,2019 01 31,"Soil organic matter (SOM) is a key soil sorbent with a large number of reactive binding sites that may complex with metals, controlling their fate, transport, and bioavailability in soil. However, due to the complex and heterogeneous nature of SOM, it is not easy to probe its physical and chemical properties at the molecular level. In this study, an a priori method was developed to predict the molecular properties of SOM, which incorporated computational molecular modeling, SPARC Performs Automated Reasoning in Chemistry's (SPARC's) chemical reactivity models, and linear free energy relationships (LFERs). Specifically, the method uses SOM models simulated by molecular dynamics modeling based on the experimental elemental composition and functional group information of SOM. For the molecular characteristics, the molecular H/C and O/C ratios, molecular weight, aromatic index, and double bond equivalence of the SOM molecules were calculated. For the proton binding constants, the SPARC was used to calculate the microscopic pKa values of every binding sites of individual molecules of the SOM model. Based on the pKa values, the metal binding constants for individual monodentate binding sites were calculated using the Irving-Rossotti LFERs for different heavy metals. The results agreed reasonably with the default values used in the Windermere Humic Aqueous Model (WHAM) (VI) for the investigated metals. The theoretical SOM models, to some extent, represented the average properties of the investigated SOM. Overall, this study gives new quantitative and molecular insight into the structure and chemical properties of SOM. Detailed deprotonation and metal-SOM complexation information was gained for individual SOM binding sites. Such feasible and straightforward predictive scheme is useful to assess the risk of heavy metals in various aquatic and terrestrial environment involving heterogeneous natural organic matter.",Evidence for co-selection of antibiotic resistance genes and mobile genetic elements in metal polluted urban soils.,https://www.ncbi.nlm.nih.gov/pubmed/30529954,The Science of the total environment,2019 02 21,"Antibiotic resistance genes (ARGs) constitute emerging environmental pollutants and pose risks to public health. Toxic metals are known to select for metal-resistant bacteria in metal-contaminated soils, but there is growing concern that metal contaminants can also act as co-selective agents thereby causing environmental proliferation of antibiotic resistance. In this study, we quantified ARGs and selected mobile genetic elements (MGEs) known to constitute potential ARG hosts in 50 archived urban and suburban soils from the Belfast metropolitan area using a high-throughput qPCR ARG chip. ARG prevalence was linked to concentrations of individual metals and a soil metal toxicity index calculated based on the relative toxicity of different metals to soil microbial processes. A total of 164 ARGs were detected across the 50 soils analyzed with an average absolute abundance of 3.4 × 107 ARG gene copies per gram of soil. A significant correlation between abundance of ARGs and MGEs was observed, suggesting the importance of horizontal gene transfer for ARG dissemination. Network analysis revealed significant co-occurrence patterns between specific metals (As, Cd, Co, Cr, Cu. Hg, Ni and Zn) and associated ARGs. Path analysis further indicated that the soil metal toxicity index significantly affected the number of detected ARGs (λ = 0.32, P < 0.001) and the abundance of metal co-occurring ARGs (λ = 0.612, P < 0.001) via effects on MGEs. Collectively, our results indicate a role of soil metals in co-selection of ARGs and MGEs in urban and semi-urban soils and suggest a risk for environmental ARG dissemination via horizontal gene transfer.","A Trace Amount of Galactose, a Major Component of Milk Sugar, Allows Maturation of Glycoproteins during Sugar Starvation.",https://www.ncbi.nlm.nih.gov/pubmed/30529953,iScience,2018 12 19,"Milk sugar is composed of glucose and galactose. Galactose is less suitable as an energy source than glucose. Thus, it has been a puzzle as to why mammals utilize galactose as a major component of milk sugar. Here we show that in hypoglycemic conditions, the presence of a trace amount of galactose, but not glucose, is able to maintain the production of mature glycoproteins and to abolish cell-death-inducing endoplasmic reticulum stress. In severely sugar-limited conditions, both glucose and galactose enter into the glycolytic pathway, but galactose is not able to raise the phosphofructokinase 1 activity, leading to the accumulation of fructose-6-phosphate, which in turn is utilized for the maturation of glycoproteins (e.g., growth factor receptors) and allows the activation of their intracellular signaling and prevents cell death from hypoglycemic conditions. Thus trace amounts of galactose may play unexpectedly important roles in the growth of infants and their protection during starvation."

Soil column incubations were conducted using three livestock antibiotics (monensin, lincomycin and sulfamethazine) to better understand the fate of the antibiotics, their effect on nitrogen transformation, and their impact on soil microbial communities under aerobic, anoxic, and denitrifying conditions. While monensin was not recovered in the effluent, lincomycin and sulfamethazine concentrations decreased slightly during transport through the columns. Sorption, and to a limited extent degradation, are likely to be the primary processes leading to antibiotic attenuation during leaching. Antibiotics also affected microbial respiration and clearly impacted nitrogen transformation. The occurrence of the three antibiotics as a mixture, as well as the occurrence of lincomycin alone affected, by inhibiting any nitrite reduction, the denitrification process. Discontinuing antibiotics additions restored microbial denitrification. Metagenomic analysis indicated that Proteobacteria, Bacteroidetes, Actinobacteria, and Chloroflexi were the predominant phyla observed throughout the study. Results suggested that episodic occurrence of antibiotics led to a temporal change in microbial community composition in the upper portion of the columns while only transient changes occurred in the lower portion. Thus, the occurrence of high concentrations of veterinary antibiotic residues could impact nitrogen cycling in soils receiving wastewater runoff or manure applications with potential longer-term microbial community changes possible at higher antibiotic concentrations.",The source of lead determines the relationship between soil properties and lead bioaccessibility.,https://www.ncbi.nlm.nih.gov/pubmed/30529941,"Environmental pollution (Barking, Essex : 1987)",2019 03 18,"Lead (Pb) contaminated soil is of particular concern for infants and children due to their susceptibility to exposure, fast metabolic rates and rapidly developing neuronal systems. Determining the bioaccessibility of Pb in soils is critical in human health risk assessments, which can vary due to different soil properties and sources of Pb contamination. In this study, the potential relationships between soil properties and Pb bioaccessibility from various Pb sources including Pb contamination from mining (specifically, Broken Hill), three shooting ranges, a smelter and two industry sites (pottery and battery), were investigated using the Relative Bioavailability Leaching Procedure (RBALP). We found the following: (1) CEC, TOC, sand and silt content, and total Pb were significantly different (p < 0.05) between the two particle size fractions of < 2 mm and < 250 μm; (2) EC, CEC and total Pb were significantly correlated to Pb bioaccessibility (p < 0.05); and (3) soil analyses based on source of Pb demonstrated a strongly significant relationship between Pb bioaccessibility and soil properties (CEC, EC, clay content and total Pb) for mining soils from Broken Hill (r2 = 0.86, p < 0.05, n = 18). These results demonstrated the influences of Pb contamination sources, soil properties and particle size fractions on Pb bioaccessibility as well as the prediction of Pb bioaccessibility using soil properties. The findings documented here will help in developing a predictive tool for human health risk assessment and the remediation of Pb contaminated soils.",Omics approach reveals metabolic disorders associated with the cytotoxicity of airborne particulate matter in human lung carcinoma cells.,https://www.ncbi.nlm.nih.gov/pubmed/30529940,"Environmental pollution (Barking, Essex : 1987)",2019 03 18,"Exposure to airborne particulate matter (PM) 2.5 induced various adverse health effects, such as metabolic syndrome, systemic inflammation and respiratory infection. However, a global influence of PM2.5-induced metabolic and proteomic disorders remains confusing, and the underlying mechanism is still under-explored. Herein, LC-MS/MS-based metabolomics, lipidomics and isobaric tags for relative and absolute quantification (iTRAQ)-based proteomics were applied to analyze the toxicological characteristics of PM2.5 from Taiyuan City in China (Taiyuan-PM2.5) on human lung carcinoma cells (A549) after the 24-h treatment. Metabolites, lipids and proteins that have distinctive differences were screened by SIEVE, LipidSearch and Proteome Discoverer, respectively. The abundance of 56 metabolites (40 increased and 16 decreased), 22 lipids (19 increased and 3 decreased) and 81 proteins (55 up-regulated and 26 down-regulated) were significantly changed upon the PM2.5 treatment. Among the proteomics analysis, 16 proteins were specifically related to RNA splicing, mainly including up-regulated serine/arginine-rich splicing factor 1 (SRSF1), SRSF2, small nuclear ribonucleoprotein 70 kDa (snRNP70), small nuclear ribonucleoprotein polypeptide B (SNRPB), SNRPC, SNRPE and down-regulated heterogeneous nuclear ribonucleoprotein U-like 2 (hnRNP UL2). At the metabolic level, PM2.5 exposure significantly altered the sphingolipid metabolism, including ceramide, serine, sphingosine and sphingomyelin. It was proposed that excessive accumulation of ceramide and expression of key enzymes (ceramide synthases, phingomyelinase, sphingosine kinase types 2 and protein phosphatase-1) induced the secretion of pro-inflammatory cytokines, generation of lipotoxicity and alterations of RNA splicing in PM2.5-treated A549  cells. In general, our results demonstrated that ceramide accumulation and altered RNA splicing could becritical contributors to PM2.5-induced cytotoxicity at metabolic and proteomic level, which might be considered as potential markers for toxicological evaluation of PM2.5 samples.","Distribution, partitioning behavior and positive matrix factorization-based source analysis of legacy and emerging polyfluorinated alkyl substances in the dissolved phase, surface sediment and suspended particulate matter around coastal areas of Bohai Bay, China.",https://www.ncbi.nlm.nih.gov/pubmed/30529939,"Environmental pollution (Barking, Essex : 1987)",2019 03 18,"The concentrations and spatial occurrences of 17 legacy per- and polyfluoroalkyl substances (PFAS) and 4 emerging PFAS in the coastal water-dissolved phase, surface sediment phase and suspended particulate matter (SPM) in the coastal areas of Bohai Bay were investigated. In addition, the partition behaviors of PFAS in the water-SPM system and water-sediment system and the potential sources of PFAS in the marine environment were revealed. The total concentrations of PFAS (∑PFAS) in the water-dissolved phase, surface sediment and SPM were 20.5-684 ng/L, 2.69-25.0 ng/g dry weight (dw) and 4.39-527 ng/g dw, respectively. The level of PFAS contamination in the coastal areas of Shandong Province was higher than that in other areas. The average partition coefficients (log Kd) of PFAS in the water-SPM system and water-sediment system were 1.56-3.57 and 0.72-2.95, respectively. Long-chain PFAS and PFECHS (perfluoroethylcyclohexane sulfonate) have a higher log Kd than that of short-chain PFAS. PFAS with short carbon chains were mainly detected in the water-dissolved phase, but long-chain PFAS mainly occurred in the surface sediment and SPM phases. Source analysis based on the positive matrix factorization (PMF) model found that erosion inhibitor factories, aqueous film-forming foam factories, metal plating plants, fluoropolymer chemical manufacture and food contact materials were the main sources of PFAS in Bohai Bay. These results improved our understanding of the partitioning behavior and sources of PFAS in aquatic environments.",Sorption behavior and mechanism of hydrophilic organic chemicals to virgin and aged microplastics in freshwater and seawater.,https://www.ncbi.nlm.nih.gov/pubmed/30529938,"Environmental pollution (Barking, Essex : 1987)",2019 03 18,"Virgin microplastics undergo aging and form oxygen-containing functional groups when they enter the environment. Therefore, the sorption of organic pollutants onto microplastics is not limited to hydrophobic organic pollutants and can also occur with hydrophilic organic pollutants. Therefore, understanding the sorption behaviors and mechanism between aged microplastics and hydrophilic organic pollutants is essential for evaluating the real effects of microplastics in the environment. We investigated the impacts of the UV-accelerated aging of polystyrene (PS) and polyvinylchloride (PVC) on their sorption interactions with ciprofloxacin (CIP). The results of infrared spectroscopy (IR) and scanning electron microscopy (SEM) showed significant surface oxidation and localized microcracks on the aged microplastics. The sorption kinetics and isotherms models indicated that the sorption capacity of aged microplastics is higher than that of pristine microplastics, and their physical interactions, including partitioning, electrostatic interactions, and intermolecular hydrogen bonding, were the dominant mechanism, as demonstrated by FTIR analysis. Moreover, the sorption capacity of the pristine microplastics decreased as the degree of crystallinity increased, whereas the opposite trend was observed with aged microplastics, which means that the crystallinity is not the controlling factor. In addition, salinity suppressed adsorption on all the tested microplastics. The pH influences the electrostatic attraction between the microplastics and CIP because CIP has a different charge at different pH values. The results presented herein confirm the importance of studying the adsorption between hydrophilic organic pollutants and aged microplastics because ultimately, all microplastics become aged. Moreover, the effects of aged microplastics with adsorbed hydrophilic chemicals on organisms need to be further studied.",The effect of major cations on the toxicity of cadmium to Folsomia candida in a sand-solution medium analyzed by biotic ligand modeling.,https://www.ncbi.nlm.nih.gov/pubmed/30529937,"Environmental pollution (Barking, Essex : 1987)",2019 03 18,"The aim of this study was to assess the effect of major cations (Ca2+, Mg2+, Na+, K+, and H+) on cadmium toxicity to the springtail Folsomia candida. Survival of the animals was determined after seven days exposure to different cadmium concentrations in an inert sand-solution medium, in different experimental setups with modification of the cation concentrations. Among the cations tested, Ca2+ and Mg2+ had protective effects on the toxicity of cadmium to the springtails while Na+, K+, and H+ showed less competition with free cadmium ions for binding to the uptake sites of the collembolans. Toxicity predicted with a biotic ligand model agreed well with the observed values. Calculated conditional binding constants and the fraction of biotic ligands occupied by cadmium to show 50% effects were similar to values reported in the literature. The results emphasize the important role of solution chemistry in determining metal toxicity to soil invertebrates.",Particulate matter pollution in Chinese cities: Areal-temporal variations and their relationships with meteorological conditions (2015-2017).,https://www.ncbi.nlm.nih.gov/pubmed/30529935,"Environmental pollution (Barking, Essex : 1987)",2019 03 18,"As the second largest economy in the world, China experiences severe particulate matter (PM) pollution in many of its cities. Meteorological factors are critical in determining both areal and temporal variations in PM pollution levels; understanding these factors and their interactions is critical for accurate forecasting, comprehensive analysis, and effective reduction of this pollution. This study analyzed areal and temporal variations in concentrations of PM2.5, PM10, and PMcoarse (PM10 - PM2.5) and PM2.5 to PM10 ratios (PM2.5/PM10) and their relationships with meteorological conditions in 366 Chinese cities from January 1, 2015 to December 31, 2017. On the national scale, PM2.5 and PM10 decreased from 48 to 42 μg m-³ and from 88 to 84 μg m-³, respectively, and the annual mean concentrations were 45 μg m-³ (PM2.5) and 84 μg m-³ (PM10) during the time period (2015-2017). In most regions, largest PM concentrations occurred in winter. However, in northern China, in spring PMcoarse concentrations were highest due to dust. The PM2.5/PM10 ratio was higher in southern than in northern China. There were large regional disparities in PM diurnal variations. Generally, PM concentrations were negatively correlated with precipitation, relative humidity, air temperature, and wind speed, but were positively correlated with surface pressure. The sunshine duration showed negative and positive impacts on PM in northern and southern cities, respectively. Meteorological factors impacted particulates of different size differently in different regions and over different periods of time.",Association of serum levels of 4-tertiary-octylphenol with cardiovascular risk factors and carotid intima-media thickness in adolescents and young adults.,https://www.ncbi.nlm.nih.gov/pubmed/30529934,"Environmental pollution (Barking, Essex : 1987)",2019 03 19,"In the family of alkylphenolic compounds, 4-tertiary-Octylphenol (4-t-OP) is extensively used in many products. In animal and in vitro studies, 4-t-OP exposure has been linked to cardiovascular disease (CVD) risk factors; however, there are no previous human epidemiological studies. In this study, 886 subjects were recruited from a cohort of Taiwanese adolescents and young adults to study the relationship between serum levels of 4-t-OP, CVD risk factors, and common carotid artery intima-media thickness (CIMT). The geometric mean (SD) 4-t-OP concentration was 32.52 (1.71) ng/mL. We found that serum levels of 4-t-OP were negatively associated with markers of glucose homeostasis (insulin, homeostasis model assessment of insulin resistance (HOMA-IR) and homeostasis model assessment of β-cell function (HOMA-β)), z score of body mass index (BMI z score) and CIMT but were positively associated with lipid profiles (high density lipoprotein cholesterol (HDL-C), Apolipoprotein A1). A one-unit elevation in natural log-transformed 4-t-OP (ng/mL) was negatively correlated with CIMT (mm) (β = -0.029, SE = 0.003, P < 0.001) in multiple linear regression analyses. The relationship between 4-t-OP and CIMT remained the same in all subgroups or if bisphenol A (BPA) was considered a covariate. In this study, we observed that higher levels of 4-t-OP levels were negatively correlated with markers of glucose homeostasis, BMI z score, and CIMT; positively correlated with lipid profiles (HDL-C and apolipoprotein A) in this cohort.

Sorption and transport behaviors of ADPs, and their hydrolysates dialkyl phosphinic acids (DPAs) were studied by batch and column experiments. ADPs are less mobile in soil columns with more than half (>52.6%) of ADPs retained in the soil and residues in the topmost 2-cm layer account for more than 57% of total residues. Dissolution and dispersion of fine grain ADPs were responsible for the transport of ADPs. Sorption DPAs (logKoc) was significantly related to the lipophilicity of DPAs (logD) (p < 0.05). Soil pH and clay content were the dominant factors governing the sorption and transport of DPAs in soils, indicating the importance of electrostatic interactions. The retardation factors (R) of DPAs derived from leaching experiments were pH-dependent with larger R values in the acidic soil (pH = 4.0) where anionic and neutral species of DPAs coexisted. Both physical and chemical non-equilibrium convection-dispersion equations (CDE) yield appropriate modeling for DPAs transport. In most cases, R values estimated from column tests differed from those derived from the batch experiments, which might be attributed to non-equilibrium sorption processes in dynamic conditions.",An immunohistochemical study of T and B lymphocyte density in prostatic hyperplasia and prostate carcinoma in dogs.,https://www.ncbi.nlm.nih.gov/pubmed/30529932,Research in veterinary science,2019 03 11,"The aim of this study was to characterise T and B lymphocyte density in 6 normal prostates, 15 benign prostatic hyperplasia (BPH) and 24 prostate carcinomas (PCs) in dogs by immunohistochemistry. Results revealed a statistically significant increase of T and B cells in PC compared to normal specimens and BPH. Regarding PC histological variants, lower number of CD3+ and CD79+ lymphocytes were observed in the most undifferentiated (solid) type. CD3+ cell density was positively correlated with survival time. These results may help in understanding the immunological mechanisms regulating BPH and PC development and progression, as well as providing background data for future immunotherapeutic trials."

Cd can impair the immune system and cause irreversible damage to fish and other aquatic organisms. The immunoprotection activities of exogenous metallothionein (MT) and vitamin E (VE) were investigated in Cd poisoned grass carp, Ctenopharyngodon idellus, in the present study. C. idellus were divided into three groups: Cd+phosphate-buffered saline (PBS) group; Cd+MT; and Cd+VE. All fish were injected with cadmium chloride (CdCl2) on the first day and then treated with PBS, MT or VE four days post-injection. Fish not injected with Cd were used as a negative control. Cd exposure caused severe head-kidney and splenic injury in C. idellus, mainly expressed as an increase in Cd content, histological damage, percentage of head-kidney and splenic cells apoptosis and decreases in immune-related gene mRNA transcript expression. However, MT and VE treatments protected against Cd-induced immunotoxicity in C. idellus by decreasing Cd contents, lessening histological damage, reducing the percentage of apoptosis and recovering immune-related mRNA transcript expression. Our results demonstrate that MT and VE can alleviate Cd-induced immunotoxicity and that MT has a more powerful effect than VE, indicating that MT could be a potential antidote in cases of Cd poisoning.","Source apportionment of selenium and influence factors on its bioavailability in intensively managed greenhouse soil: A case study in the east bank of the Dianchi Lake, China.",https://www.ncbi.nlm.nih.gov/pubmed/30529918,Ecotoxicology and environmental safety,2019 03 20,"Selenium (Se) is an essential trace element for humans and animals. In China, intensive agricultural inputs in greenhouse vegetable production (GVP) have resulted in great changes in Se concentration and bioavailability in soil, which have great influences on Se flux to living organisms through food chains. It is crucial to understand the factors on Se concentration and bioavailability in greenhouse soil. Thus, we chose the east bank of the Dianchi Lake, a typical GVP area covering 177 km2 in Southwest China, as the study area to quantify source contributions to soil Se and estimate relative importance of influence factors on its bioavailability in GVP with a receptor model (absolute principal component scores-multiple linear regression, APCS-MLR) after principal component analysis (PCA). According to the enrichment factor (EF), total Se in greenhouse soil was accumulated at a minor level (1 < EF < 3) by long-term and intensive fertilization. Source contributions to total Se decreased in the sequence of parent materials > fertilization > atmospheric deposition. It suggested that fertilization, especially manure, might be an important way to increase total Se in greenhouse soils in Se-deficient areas. The bioavailability of Se was affected by several factors, among of which total Se was the foremost one. In comparison with organic matter and clay, Fe/Al oxides exerted more controls on Se bioavailability, which was dependent on pH. Increasing Olsen P was helpful in improving soil Se bioavailability in greenhouse. More attention should be paid to soil physicochemical characteristics when Se-containing fertilizers are applied to increase Se levels in greenhouse vegetables.","Developmental neurotoxicity of maneb: Notochord defects, mitochondrial dysfunction and hypoactivity in zebrafish (Danio rerio) embryos and larvae.",https://www.ncbi.nlm.nih.gov/pubmed/30529917,Ecotoxicology and environmental safety,2019 03 20,"Broad applications and exposure to the fungicide maneb can lead to toxicity in non-target organisms. Maneb is also associated with neurogenerative diseases such as Parkinson's disease (PD). The objectives of this study were to determine the acute toxicity of maneb to zebrafish by measuring mitochondrial bioenergetics, locomotor activity, and the expression of genes related to the oxidative damage response, as well as those related to dopamine signaling due to its association with PD. Zebrafish embryos at 6 h post-fertilization (hpf) were exposed to either solvent control (0.1% DMSO, v/v), or one dose of 0.1, 0.5, 1.0 and 10.0 µM maneb for 96 h. Maneb was moderately toxic to zebrafish embryos, and had a 96-h LC50 value of 4.29 μM (~ 1.14 mg/L). Maneb induced a dose-dependent increase in mortality, decreased hatching rate, and increased notochord deformity rate at both 1.0 and 10.0 µM after 72 and 96 h. Total body length was also significantly reduced with 1.0 µM maneb. A 50-60% decrease in mean basal oxygen consumption rate was also observed in embryos following a 24 hpf exposure to 10.0 µM maneb but oligomycin-induced ATP production and FCCP-induced maximum respiration remained unaffected. No change was detected in the expression levels of genes associated with oxidative stress (sod1 and sod2), nor those related to dopamine synthesis (th1), dopamine transporter (dat), dopamine receptors (drd1, drd2a, drd3, and drd4b). Thus, modifying the expression of these transcripts may not be a mechanism for maneb-induced developmental toxicity in zebrafish. To assess the potential for neurotoxicity, a dark photokinesis assay was conducted in larvae following 7 d exposure to 0.1, 0.5 and 1.0 μM maneb. Larvae exposed to 0.5 and 1.0 μM maneb showed signs related to hypoactivity, and this reduced activity is hypothesized to be associated with notochord defects as this deformity was prevalent at higher concentrations of maneb. Overall, these data demonstrate that maneb negatively affects embryonic development (i.e. notochord development), affects basal oxygen consumption rates of embryos, and induces hypoactivity in larval fish. This study improves understanding regarding the developmental neurotoxicity of the fungicide maneb to zebrafish.",Study on the influence of soil microbial community on the long-term heavy metal pollution of different land use types and depth layers in mine.,https://www.ncbi.nlm.nih.gov/pubmed/30529916,Ecotoxicology and environmental safety,2019 03 20,"To understand the importance of the response of soil microbial communities to the stress of heavy metals around mining areas by assessing the feedback of soil ecosystems in different soil habitats, this article selected different land use types (Mining area, Dressing area, Heap mine area, Tailings area and Vegetable field) and surface soil samples of different depths (0-10 cm, 10-20 cm, 20-30 cm) as the variables related to the mining activities in the Shizishan mining area in Tongling, Anhui Province, China. Soil physicochemical properties and heavy metal concentrations of the different land use types and soil depths were compared. Illumina MiSeq. 2500 Sequencing Technology was used to analyze the abundance and structural diversity of the microbial community in soil samples. The relationship between mine soil pollution characteristics and microbial community were investigated. The results showed that soil physicochemical properties and heavy metals significantly affected the microbial community. The microbial community structure was significantly variable in vertical soil depth-layer habitats. The relative abundance (1%) of the soil microbial community at the phylum level was represented by a total of 14 phyla, where the two most dominant phyla were Proteobacteria (41.71%) and Firmicutes (20.44%). The two bacteria were positively related with Cu, Zn, Pb, and pH but negatively associated with soil organic matter (SOM), available potassium (AK), and moisture content (MC). Therefore, Proteobacteria and Firmicutes were highly resistant to heavy metals.

The results indicated that N fertilizer treatment (N) and N fertilizer plus straw treatment (NS) promoted T. patula growth, while straw treatment (S) decreased T. patula biomass relative to the control. NS and S treatments increased Cd mobility in the soil and facilitated its uptake by T. patula in Acidic Ferralsols (AF) and Calcaric Cambisols (CC), but the promotion effect was much greater in CC than in AF. The Cd concentrations in the Tagetes shoots in the S and NS treatments were 40% and 27% greater, respectively, than those in the control treatment for AF, and 111% and 80% greater, respectively, for CC. Decreases in soil pH and increases in dissoluble organic carbon concentration after adding N fertilizer and straw were associated with an increase in soil Cd availability and in Cd uptake by T. patula. The results indicate that the NS treatment can alter the soil microenvironment, increasing Cd bioavailability and thus facilitating Cd uptake by T. patula. This work highlights that the combined application of N fertilizer with straw may be a useful way to increase the phytoextraction efficiency of Cd-contaminated soil by the Cd-hyperaccumulator T. patula.",Immobilized bacterial biosensor for rapid and effective monitoring of acute toxicity in water.,https://www.ncbi.nlm.nih.gov/pubmed/30529914,Ecotoxicology and environmental safety,2019 03 20,"The use of biosensors by using microorganisms such as bacteria have short life cycles and provide other advantages. One colorimetric biosensor technique that has been developed is the use of a biosensor utilizing the incorporation of Prussian blue formation reactions mediated by E. coli bioreactors with ferricyanide. Immobilization is a method that allows the bacteria can be used for long-term without reducing its ability as bioreceptor. This study aimed to develop a novel and rapid immobilized bacterial biosensor for the detection of toxic compound in water and to evaluate their analytical performances. Immobilization of E. coli performed by trapping method using alginate material support. The bacterial suspension was mixed with sodium alginate (1:1 v/v), and the mixture was continuously dropped in CaCl2 solution to be a form of beads. The beads were used as bioreceptor to detect toxicants regarding cadmium, arsenic, mercury, chromium and lead solutions with Prussian blue as a colorimetric indicator. The linearity and sensitivity of detection of beads to the toxicants were tested, the stability of repeated use and storage were evaluated as well. The results showed that E. coli could be immobilized using alginate with response value was correlated with toxic concentration.

This correlation empirically limits the purity of the characterization of ""numerical error monitoring"".

Previous studies suggested that this trypophobia is caused by the specific power spectrum of the images; this idea has not been fully investigated empirically. In the present study, we used breaking continuous flash suppression (b-CFS) to clarify whether the trypophobic images affect access to visual awareness, and what features of trypophobic images contribute to rapid access of awareness. In the b-CFS paradigms, a dynamic masking pattern presented to one eye suppresses the target images shown to the other eye. The participants' task was to indicate where the target image appeared in a dichoptic display through a mirror stereoscope. The target images consisted of trypophobic, fear-related, clusters or neutral images. The trypophobic images emerged into awareness faster than the other types of images. However, the phase-scrambled versions of the trypophobic images did not show any differences across the image types, suggesting that the trypophobic power spectra themselves did not affect access to awareness. Moreover, the phase-scrambled trypophobic images without CFS tended to be detected earlier than the phase-scrambled fearful and neutral images. These findings indicate that trypophobic power spectra might affect post-perceptual processing, such as response production.",Body image as a predictor of nonsuicidal self-injury in women: A longitudinal study.,https://www.ncbi.nlm.nih.gov/pubmed/30529911,Comprehensive psychiatry,2018 12 15,"To determine whether Body Image Dissatisfaction (BID) predicted NonSuicidal Self-Injury (NSSI) cross-sectionally and longitudinally, independent of comorbidity between NSSI and Disordered Eating (DE).

At present, no such biomarkers are available to inform on the health of the inner ear. Previously, we proposed the outer-hair-cell-specific protein prestin, as a possible biomarker and provided proof of concept in noise- and cisplatin-induced hearing loss. Our ototoxicity data suggest that circulatory prestin changes after inner ear injury are not static and that there is a temporal pattern of change that needs to be further characterized before practical information can be extracted. To achieve this goal, we set out to 1) describe the time course of change in prestin after intense noise exposure, and 2) determine if the temporal patterns and prestin levels are sensitive to severity of injury. After assessing auditory brainstem thresholds and distortion product otoacoustic emission levels, rats were exposed to intense octave band noise for 2 h at either 110 or 120 dB SPL. Auditory function was re-assessed 1 and 14 days later. Blood samples were collected at baseline, 4, 24, 48, 72 h and 7 and 14 days post exposure and prestin concentrations were measured using enzyme-linked immunosorbent assay (ELISA). Functional measures showed temporary hearing loss 1 day after exposure in the 110 dB SPL group, but permanent loss through Day 14 in the 120 dB SPL group. Prestin levels temporarily increased 5% at 4 h after 120 dB SPL exposure, but not in the 110 dB SPL group. There was a gradual decline in prestin levels in both groups thereafter, with prestin being below baseline on Day 14 by 5% in the 110 dB group (NS) and more than 10% in the 120 dB SPL group (p = 0.043). These results suggest that there is a temporal pattern of change in serum prestin level after noise-induced hearing loss that is related to severity of hearing loss.

Herein, a label-free electrochemical method was developed for quantitative detection of microRNAs by integrating Y-shaped DNA (Y-DNA) structures with non-linear hybridization chain reaction (non-linear HCR). The Y-DNA structures consisting of three sequences (Y1, Y2 and Y3) serve as stable and specific probes for recognizing target miRNAs. In the presence of target miRNA, competitive hybridization occurs between miRNA and Y-DNA, resulting in the release of Y3 and the disintegration of the Y-DNA structure. The triggers, which were blocked by Y3 previously, were exposed and initiated the non-linear HCR. Remarkable electrochemical signal changes were produced after the isothermal amplification reaction. Therefore, the proposed biosensor achieved sensitive detection of microRNAs (miRNAs). Under optimal conditions, the limit of detection (LOD) was reduced to 0.3334 fM and linear range was from 1 fM to 10 pM. The special design of Y-DNA helped the biosensor obtain the ability to distinguish between single base mutations. What's more, this biosensor was capable of detecting miRNAs in clinical serum samples. We hope that this developed biosensor would provide a potential application for DNA nanomaterials in the field of microRNAs detection and inspire more interests in the development of DNA nanomaterial biosensors.",Graphene-oxide quenching-based molecular beacon imaging of exosome-mediated transfer of neurogenic miR-193a on microfluidic platform.,https://www.ncbi.nlm.nih.gov/pubmed/30529896,Biosensors & bioelectronics,2019 04 15,"Graphene-oxide (GO) quenching-based molecular beacon was developed for rapid and sensitive detection of RNAs in living cells and tissues. Here, we applied GO quenching-based molecular beacon sensor to visualize neurogenic miR-193a levels delivered via exosomes during cell-non-autonomous neurogenesis in neural progenitor cells on a microfluidic platform. Exosomal transport was visualized using CD63-RFP plasmid vector, and FAM-labeled peptide nucleic acid (PNA) probe for the miR-193 sequence was designed to detect endogenous miR-193 expression. Fluorescence signals of FAM-PNA193a-GO were recovered in dibutyryl-cAMP-induced F11 cells, resulting from increased expression of miR-193a after neuronal differentiation. We observed delivery of miR-193a-containing exosomes released from differentiated donor F11 cells to recipient undifferentiated F11 cells. Fluorescence recovery was evident in exosome-stimulated recipient individual F11 cells in the microfluidic system. We propose molecular beacon imaging using PNA-GO complex for visualization of individual cellular expression of mature microRNAs. This system reveals the precise spatial localization and temporal sequences of mature miRNAs by intercellular exosomal delivery of messages for processes such as cell-non-autonomous neurogenesis.",Detection of liquids by magnetic resonance force microscopy in the gradient-on-cantilever geometry.,https://www.ncbi.nlm.nih.gov/pubmed/30529895,"Journal of magnetic resonance (San Diego, Calif. : 1997)",2018 12 25,"We demonstrate the detection of picoliter amounts of water and triethylenetetramine by a magnetic-resonance-force-microscopy (MRFM) setup operated in the gradient-on-cantilever geometry at room temperature.

Such 13C-1H photo-CIDNP MAS-J-HMQC and photo-CIDNP MAS-J-HSQC experiments are applied to acquire the 2D 13C-1H correlation spectra of selectively 13C-labeled photochemically active cofactors in the frozen quinone-blocked photosynthetic reaction center (RC) of the purple bacterium Rhodobacter (R.) sphaeroides wild-type (WT). Resulting spectra contain no correlation peaks arising from the protein backbone, which greatly simplifies the assignment of aliphatic region. Based on the photo-CIDNP MAS-J-HMQC NMR experiment, we obtained assignment of selective 1H NMR resonances of the cofactors involved in the electron transfer process in the RC and compared them with values theoretically predicted by density functional theory (DFT) calculation as well as with the chemical shifts obtained from monomeric cofactors in the solution. We also compared proton chemical shifts obtained by photo-CIDNP MAS-J-HMQC experiment under continuous illumination with the ones obtained in dark by classical cross-polarization (CP) HETCOR. We expect that the proposed approach will become a method of choice for obtaining 1H chemical shift maps of the active cofactors in photosynthetic RCs and will aid the interpretation of heteronuclear spin-torch experiments.",Magnetic field gradient waveform correction of motion-sensitized SPRITE by pre-equalization.,https://www.ncbi.nlm.nih.gov/pubmed/30529892,"Journal of magnetic resonance (San Diego, Calif. : 1997)",2018 12 25,"Eddy currents caused by pulsed field gradients in magnetic resonance measurements of high-speed flow cause the magnetic field gradient amplitude waveform experienced by the sample to be different from the waveform demanded of the magnetic field gradient amplifiers. By measuring and using the system impulse response, pre-equalization magnetic field gradient waveform correction can be used to counteract the resulting errors in measured signal phase at the cost of minimal additional experimental time. The effectiveness of the pre-equalization method of magnetic field gradient waveform correction is tested with a motion-sensitized (pulsed field gradient) version of the SPRITE imaging pulse sequence which requires extreme gradient slew rates in excess of 1000 T/m/s in a 6.7-cm-bore set of gradient windings.

Genetics,2019 03 14,"The application of massively parallel sequencing (MPS) in forensic sciences enables high-resolution short tandem repeat (STR) genotyping for the characterization of biological evidence. While MPS supports multiplexing of a large number of forensic markers, the performance of an MPS-STR panel depends on good primer design and optimal PCR conditions. However, conventional strategies for multifactorial assay optimization are labor-intensive and do not necessarily allow the experimenter to identify optimum factor settings. Here we describe our new multiplex PCR assay, monSTR, which supports the simultaneous amplification of 21 forensic markers followed by targeted sequencing on the Illumina MiSeq. The selection of STR markers adapts on the expanded European Standard Set (ESS), including the highly polymorphic locus SE33, for compatibility with existing forensic DNA databases. Primer engineering involved bioinformatics tools to create a multiplex-compatible primer set. Primer quality was evaluated in silico and in vitro. We demonstrate the systematic optimization of multiplex PCR thermocycling conditions using Design of Experiments (DOE) methodology. The objective was to yield a specific, balanced, low-noise amplification of forensic targets. A central composite face design of experiments enabled an efficient simultaneous investigation of multiple critical process parameters and their interactions. Optimal multiplex PCR conditions were predicted using software-aided modelling based on DOE data. Verification experiments suggested a balanced, reproducible amplification of all markers with reduced formation of artefacts. Fully concordant STR profiles were obtained for the investigated reference samples even with challenging input DNA concentrations. We found that application of DOE principles enabled an experimentally practical and economically justifiable assay development and optimization, even beyond the field of forensic genetics.",Correlation and temporal variability of urinary biomarkers of chemicals among couples: Implications for reproductive epidemiological studies.,https://www.ncbi.nlm.nih.gov/pubmed/30529890,Environment international,2019 06 13,"Exposure to some environmental chemicals is ubiquitous and linked to a variety of adverse outcomes, including children's health.

It is assumed that information is conveyed in the frequency, amplitude and shape of these oscillations. In particular, calcium signalling in mammalian liver cells has repeatedly been reported to display frequency coding so that an increasing amount of stimulus is translated into an increasing frequency of the oscillations. However, recently, we have shown that calcium oscillations in fish liver cells rather exhibit amplitude coding with increasing stimuli being translated into increasing amplitudes. Practical consequences of this difference are unknown so far. Here we investigated advantages and disadvantages of frequency vs. amplitude coding, in particular in environments with substantially changing temperatures (e.g. 10-20 degrees). For this purpose, we use computational modelling and a new approach to generate a calcium model exactly displaying a specific frequency and/or amplitude. We conclude that despite the advantages in flexibility that frequencies might offer for the transmission of information in the cell, amplitude coding is obviously more robust with respect to changes in environmental temperatures. This potentially explains the observed differences between two classes of organisms, one operating at constant temperatures whereas the other is not.",The impact of financial strain on medication non-adherence: Influence of psychiatric medication use.,https://www.ncbi.nlm.nih.gov/pubmed/30529876,Psychiatry research,2019 04 15,"Non-adherence to prescribed medications is a systemic public health concern. Financial strain, the extent to which an individual is unable to afford necessary items, may represent an important factor related to adherence. This study evaluated the association between financial strain and medication adherence as a function of medication type. Participants reporting a daily prescription for psychiatric or other chronic health conditions (N = 231) were sampled from the crowdsourcing website Amazon Mechanical Turk (mTurk). All participants completed measures of financial strain and other individual-difference factors related to adherence. Medication adherence was evaluated using a subjective scale (i.e., ARMS) and past month non-adherence rates. General financial strain showed a modest relationship with subjective scales of adherence, but not past month non-adherence rates. Medication-specific financial strain was associated with greater non-adherence, even after controlling for relevant demographic, socio-economic, and personality factors. Medication-specific financial strain also disproportionately affected individuals taking psychiatric medications relative to those not taking psychiatric medications. These findings emphasize the role that financial strain plays in medication adherence, and in particular, in psychiatric conditions. Future studies could design interventions targeting financial strain to improve clinical adherence, broadly, and psychiatric medication adherence, specifically.",Methadone maintenance treatment patients with a history of childhood trauma succeed more in a cognitive paradigm that is associated with a negative reward.,https://www.ncbi.nlm.nih.gov/pubmed/30529875,Psychiatry research,2019 04 15,"Previously we showed that methadone maintenance treatment (MMT) patients displayed difficulties in generalization and reversal learning in the presence of drug-related context, compared to prolonged abstinence individuals. We now tested how history of childhood trauma, affects their reversal learning abilities. Fifty-one MMT patients were evaluated on a performance- based paradigm which assesses the ability to acquire and reverse stimulus-outcome associations in neutral and drug-related context. Patients with a history of childhood trauma (n = 32) as compared to patients without such a history showed decreased ability to learn associations with positive outcome, and had poorer performance in drug compare to neutral-related context. Most importantly, while individuals with childhood trauma history showed higher success rates in conditions of positive to negative reversals, an opposite pattern was observed in conditions of negative to positive reversal; whereas patients with trauma history preformed significantly worse than patients with no history. The results are in line with other studies which tested the effects of childhood trauma both in clinical and in healthy populations. Recognizing this trait that more disturbed by drug related context, may contribute to develop and improve personalized treatments which takes into account the difficulties as well as the strength associated with childhood trauma.",Early recovery and employment outcome 13 years after first episode psychosis.,https://www.ncbi.nlm.nih.gov/pubmed/30529874,Psychiatry research,2019 04 15,"175 cases of first episode psychosis were recruited to the Parachute project in 1996-97. The program offered highly available and continuous psychosocial support and a cautious use of antipsychotic medication for 5 years from inclusion.

During the first year after inclusion the cohort improved in the scores of the Brief Psychiatric Rating Scale (BPRS) and Global Assessment of Function (GAF) to median levels that later remained rather stable. By month 12 the median GAF score was 65. 68% of the cases were in remission from psychotic symptoms as assessed with BPRS. 38% of the cases in remission and 60% not in remission had prescriptions of antipsychotic medication by month 12.

Here, we devised a strategy to enhance maturation of human CM in vitro by assembly of three-dimensional (3D) cardiac organoids (CO) containing human embryonic stem cell-derived cardiac progenitor cells (hESC-CPCs), endothelial cells (ECs), and mesenchymal stem cells (MSCs). In contrast to corresponding 2D cultures, 3D CO not only developed into structures containing spontaneously beating CM, but also showed enhanced maturity as indicated by increased expressions of sarcomere and ion channel genes and reduced proliferation. Heterotopic implantation of CO into the peritoneal cavity of immunodeficient mice induced neovascularization, and further stimulated upregulation of genes coding for the contractile apparatus, Ca2+ handling and ion channel proteins. In addition, CM in implanted CO were characterized by a more mature ultrastructure compared to CM implanted without CO support. Functional analysis revealed the presence of working cardiomyocytes in both in vivo and ex ovo chorioallantoic membrane implanted CO. Our results demonstrate that cultivation in 3D CO and subsequent heterotopic implantation enhance maturation of CM towards an adult-like phenotype. We reason that CO-derived CM represent an attractive source for drug discovery and other biomedical applications.",Lithium-containing biomaterials stimulate bone marrow stromal cell-derived exosomal miR-130a secretion to promote angiogenesis.,https://www.ncbi.nlm.nih.gov/pubmed/30529871,Biomaterials,2019 01 14,"The chemical signals of biomaterials could influence bone marrow stromal cells (BMSCs)-endothelial cells (ECs) communication during vascularized bone regeneration. However, the underlying mechanisms still remain unknown. Exosomes, a series of extracellular vesicles, have recently emerged as potential paracrine mediators in cell-cell communication. However, whether exosomes and exosomal microRNAs (miRNAs) are involved in the chemical signals of biomaterials-modulated BMSCs-ECs communication are unknown. Hence, in the present study, a model Li-incorporated bioactive glass ceramic (Li-BGC) was applied to explore the chemical signals of biomaterials mediated cell-cell communication between BMSCs and ECs. Our results showed that Li-BGC directly promoted the pro-angiogenic capability of HUVECs in vitro and new blood vessel ingrowth in vivo. Moreover, Li-BGC activated Wnt/β-catenin, AKT and NF-κB signaling pathways, while AKT signaling pathway might function as the upstream of Wnt/β-catenin and NF-κB signaling pathways. More importantly, Li-BGC further facilitated the pro-angiogenic capacity of HUVECs by eliciting the expression of exosomal pro-angiogenic miR-130a in BMSCs-derived exosomes, which subsequently leading to the downregulation of PTEN protein and activation of AKT pathway, ultimately resulting in the elevated proliferation, migration and tube formation of endothelial cells, as well as the upregulated expression of pro-angiogenic genes. Our findings may provide new insights into the regulatory roles of the chemical signals of biomaterials in BMSCs-ECs communication via stimulating exosomal miR-130a secretion and PTEN/AKT signaling pathway in the angiogenic process of bone remodelling.",Engineering advanced neural tissue constructs to mitigate acute cerebral inflammation after brain transplantation in rats.,https://www.ncbi.nlm.nih.gov/pubmed/30529870,Biomaterials,2019 01 18,"Stroke, traumatic brain injuries, and other similar conditions often lead to significant loss of functional brain tissue and associated disruption of neuronal signaling. A common strategy for replacing lost neurons is the injection of dissociated neural stem cells or differentiated neurons. However, this method is unlikely to be suitable for replacing large brain cavities, and the resulting distribution of neurons may lack the necessary architecture to support appropriate brain function. Engineered neural tissues may be a viable alternative. Cell death is a prominent concern in neuronal grafting studies, a problem that could be magnified with the transplantation of engineered neural tissues. Here, we examined the effect of one contributor to cell death, acute cerebral inflammation, on neuronal survival after the transplantation of bioengineered constructs based on silk scaffolds. We found evidence of a high degree of inflammation and poor neuronal survival after introducing engineered constructs into the motor cortex of rats. Integrating a corticosteroid (methylprednisolone) into the constructs resulted in significantly improved neuron survival during the acute phase of inflammation. The improved construct survival was associated with decreased markers of inflammation and an anti-inflammatory state of the immune system due to the steroid treatment.",Cerrado ecoregions: A spatial framework to assess and prioritize Brazilian savanna environmental diversity for conservation.,https://www.ncbi.nlm.nih.gov/pubmed/30529869,Journal of environmental management,2019 02 16,"The Brazilian Cerrado is the second largest biome in Latin America, extending over more than 200 million ha and hosts some of the most intensive agricultural activities for grain and beef production in the world. Because of the biodiversity richness and high levels of endemism, Cerrado is considered one of world's hotspot for biodiversity conservation. The objectives of this study are three-fold: to present a comprehensive division of Cerrado into different ecoregions that reflect the environmental heterogeneity within the biome; to analyze the ecoregions in terms of biophysical characteristics, protected areas, environmental liability in riparian permanent protection areas along watercourses, and priorities for biodiversity conservation; and to rank the ecoregions in terms of endangerment for biodiversity conservation and restoration. A previous study that delineated 22 ecoregions using geomorphology, vegetation, soil, geology, and plant diversity maps was revised using topography, vegetation, precipitation, and soil maps. Our new ecoregion map consists of 19 units that are unique in terms of landscape characteristics and has been adjusted to the current official boundary map of Cerrado. Some of the ecoregions consist of only one geomorphological compartment, whereas others are heterogeneous, consisting of up to eight compartments. Ferralsols comprise the dominant soil type in 14 of the ecoregions. The percentage of protected areas within ecoregions ranges from 1.7% to 51.5%. The most endangered ecoregion, where land use change critically threatens habitat integrity, is the Depressão Cárstica do São Francisco (states of Bahia, Minas Gerais, and Piauí), where environmental liability along riparian permanent protection areas amounts to 85.6% of the total area. Our proposed ecoregion map provides a spatial framework for regional and local assessments to improve decision-making processes to reconcile conservation and restoration planning, sustainable agriculture, and provision of ecosystem services. Besides de adjustment of the previous Cerrado's ecoregion map to the official biome boundary (relevant for the implementation of public policies of conservation as those regulated by the Brazilian Forest Code), the new analyses of the ecoregion map represent a substantial improvement in comparison to the ones conducted by the previous study in 2003. In addition, current web resources allow us to make all the information used or derived from this study available to other users. This opens the possibility of additional improvements of our findings by the scientific community or to be used effectively by decision makers."

This study assessed water quality at the dam and investigated the impacts of this water on some soil characteristics of irrigated lands. The physicochemical parameters of the water were measured monthly at eight sites and related to soil characteristics sampled from six irrigated areas, which were compared to non-irrigated soils. The chemical facies of the water were chloride sulfate and calcium magnesium. The water had low levels of cadmium (8.9 μg/L) and lead (4.55 μg/L), excessive contents of chloride and bicarbonate, while pH ranged between 6.5 and 8.4. High levels of electrical conductivity were measured in 39% of samples that exceeded standard for irrigation use. Richard diagram identified four classes of water: (i) C3S1 with 61.5% of samples having moderate or poor quality, (ii) C4S1 (30.2%) having poor or bad quality, (iii) C4S2 (5.2%) having very bad quality, and (iv) C5S3 (3.1%) determined unsuitable for irrigation. A Wilcox diagram revealed that 58% of samples had good quality while 42% were inappropriate for irrigation. Soil pH, EC and OM increased in irrigated soils, particularly in the surface horizon, compared to the control sites; whereas total CaCO3 decreased at all soil depths measured. High levels of bioavailable lead (35.82 μg/g) and cadmium (0.22 μg/g) were recorded in the surface soil. The study suggests that adequate protection measures with appropriate guidelines for various water and soil parameters are needed to minimize the detrimental effects of irrigation water on agricultural lands.",Preparation of magnetic polyimide@ Mg-Fe layered double hydroxides core-shell composite for effective removal of various organic contaminants from aqueous solution.,https://www.ncbi.nlm.nih.gov/pubmed/30529855,Chemosphere,2019 02 21,"In this work, a novel core-shell structured magnetic polyimide@layered double oxides (LDO) composites coating a porous polyimide (PI)-coated Fe3O4 magnetic core and layered double hydroxide (LDH) has been successfully synthesized by solve-thermal synthesis and co-precipitation process. The magnetic PI@LDO composites were characterized by scanning and transmission electron microscopy (SEM and TEM), X-ray diffraction (XRD), thermogravimetry analysis (TGA) and magnetic properties analysis. The composite materials displayed core-shell structure with flower-like morphology. The magnetic PI@LDO composites were applied to remove tetracycline (TC), 2,4-dichlorophenol (2,4-DCP) and glyphosate (GP) from aqueous solution. The action pH value was ranged from 5 to 9 for TC and GP and 3 to 7 for 2,4-DCP, respectively. Cl- showed a weak competitive adsorption effect to TC, 2, 4-DCP and GP. In addition, the presence of humic acid (HA) could slightly reduce the adsorption capacity of magnetic PI@LDO composites. The adsorption process could be well described by pseudo-second-order model for TC and GP, while pseudo-first-order model for 2,4-DCP. The experimental data of TC and 2,4-DCP could be fitted better with Freundlich model, while that of GP were fitted better with Langmuir model. The adsorptions of TC, 2,4-DCP and GP were both spontaneous and endothermic. The adsorption capacity decreased slightly after adsorption-desorption cycles repeated five times.

In a glasshouse pot experiment, top-soil and sub-soil layering was simulated, generating an artificial sub-soil medium by mixing two quarry non-commercial by-products, i.e. silt and overburden. These were blended in three ratios (100:0, 70:30, 50:50). Pots were packed to two bulk densities (1.3 and 1.5 g cm-3) and sown with three cover crops used in the early restoration process namely winter rye (Secale cereale), white mustard (Sinapis alba) and a grassland seed mixture (Lolium perenne, Phleum pratense, Poa pratensis, Festuca rubra). Three weeks into growth, the first signs of nitrogen (N) deficiency were observed in mustard plants, with phosphorus (P) and potassium (K) deficiencies observed at 35 days. Rye exhibited minor N deficiency symptoms four weeks into growth, whilst the grassland mixture showed no deficiency symptoms. The 70:30 silt:overburden sub-soil blend resulted in significantly higher Root Mass Densities of grassland seed mixture and rye in the sub-soil layer as compared with the other blends. The innovation in this work is the detailed physical, chemical and biological characterisation of silt:overburden blends and effects on root development of plants commonly used in early restoration to bio-engineer soil structural improvements.",An unnoticed issue: Organochlorine pesticides in tobacco products around the world.,https://www.ncbi.nlm.nih.gov/pubmed/30529853,Chemosphere,2019 02 21,"In this work we assessed the presence of two well-known pesticides (DDT and lindane) along with their main metabolite or isomer in tobacco products from 11 countries.

In this work, we extend this model to the whole range of physiological relevant air volume fractions. The results agree very well with in vivo measurements in human lung tissue.","Artemisianins A-D, new stereoisomers of seco-guaianolide involved heterodimeric [4+2] adducts from Artemisia argyi induce apoptosis via enhancement of endoplasmic reticulum stress.",https://www.ncbi.nlm.nih.gov/pubmed/30529847,Bioorganic chemistry,2019 02 12,"Artemisianins A-D (1-4), four stereoisomers of sesquiterpenoid dimers, forming via [4+2] cycloaddition from a 1, 10-seco-guaianolide dienophile and a guaianolide diene, along with two biosynthetically related precurors 5 and 6, were isolated from the famous traditional Chinese medicine Artemisia argyi.

However, due to the relatively weak activation on the Wnt/β-catenin signalling pathway, HLY78 is insufficient for further pharmacological study. Herein, the structural optimization of HLY78 and analyses of the structure-activity relationships (SARs) of HLY78-derived phenanthridine derivatives as agonists of the Wnt/β-catenin signalling pathway are presented. In this work, 36 derivatives were designed and synthesized with some derivatives exhibiting stronger Wnt activity than the activity of HLY78. In particular, one of them, 8-((1,3-dimethy-pyrazol-5-yl)methoxy)-5-ethyl-4-methyl-5,6-dihydro-phenanthridin-9-ol, exhibited strong Wnt active activity and is 10 times more potent than HLY78. The following SAR analysis suggests that a pyrazole group, especially at the C-8 position, is important for Wnt activation; a methyl group at the C-4position seems to be more beneficial for Wnt activation than ethyl; and oxidation of the C-6 position reduces the Wnt activation."

The first estimation given served as an anchor for all following estimates. If the first estimation was highly biased in one direction, then subsequent estimates were more likely to also be biased in the same direction. Additionally, separate estimates for a number of individual tasks differed from the estimates for all of the tasks combined. This incongruity happened even though all estimates were given in sequence.

A novel immobilized trypsin microreactor based on monolithic capillary column was developed for rapid proteolytic digestion in this work. The monolithic support was prepared using itaconic acid as functional monomer within a silanized fused-silica capillary. By taking advantage of itaconic acid with two carboxylic functional groups, trypsin was covalently immobilized onto the monolithic support by condensation reaction. The performance of proteolytic digestion by the microreactor was evaluated with cytochrome C and bovine serum albumin, and the digests were further analyzed by CE and HPLC. Compared to those obtained by conventional in-solution digestion, the digestion time was shortened from 12 h to 40 s, demonstrating the high digestion efficiency of the prepared microreactor. Difference of protein separation results obtained by CE and HPLC highlighted the potential of CE in fast and highly efficient peptide separation in proteomic study. All the results demonstrated that the microreactor combined with CE could be a promising tool in workflow of proteomic analysis.","Exploring the halophyte Cistanche phelypaea (L.)

The extracts had a higher activity towards BuChE, and the roots extract had the highest capacity to inhibit tyrosinase. Samples showed a low capacity to inhibit carbohydrate hydrolysing enzymes, except for the root extract with a good inhibition on glucosidase. Samples were then characterized by NMR (1D and 2D): the main metabolites identified in the flowers extract were iridoid glycosides, in particular gluroside and bartsioside. In stems, phenylehanoid glycosides (PhGs) and iridoids were detected, especially acteoside. In roots were detected essentially PhGs, mainly echinacoside and tubuloside A. Docking studies were performed on the identified compounds. A favorable binding energy of tubuloside A to tyrosinase was calculated, and indicated this compound as a possible competitive inhibitor of α-glucosidase and tyrosinase.

In this work, red emitting water soluble fluorophores bearing push-pull substituents were synthesized and examined for their interaction with human telomeric G4 and duplex (ds) -DNAs. The presence of a strong electron donating (dimethylamino) and electron withdrawing (cationic pyridinium) groups linked through a conjugated double bond helps in water solubility and enabling the emission in the near IR region (>700-nm).

We found that miRNA-29b (miR-29b) was dynamically downregulated by silica and influenced the promotion of MET in RLE-6TN cells. Furthermore, delivery of miR-29b to mice significantly inhibited silica-induced EMT, prevented lung fibrosis, and improved lung function. Together, our results clearly demonstrated that miR-29b acted as a novel negative regulator of silicosis fibrosis-inhibited lung fibrosis, probably by promoting MET and by suppressing EMT in the lung.

The study aimed to identify in the rat muscle factors that contribute to sag in two types of fast MUs: fast fatigable (FF) and fast resistant to fatigue (FR). First, we performed mathematical decomposition of sagging tetanic contractions of FF and FR MUs into twitch-like responses to consecutive stimuli. This process indicated an increase in the amplitudes of a few initial responses (up to the 2nd-3rd for FF and up to the 2nd-7th for FR MUs), followed by a decrease in the amplitudes of later responses. In comparison to the first twitch, the relative increase in force amplitudes of the several subsequent decomposed responses was smaller, and their contraction and relaxation times were shorter for FF than for FR units, which corresponded to observed differences in their sag profiles. Additionally, after occlusion of the blood circulation, sag disappeared, but it reappeared after restoration of the blood supply. This indicates that the presence of sag depends on the proper circulation in the muscle.",Rural-urban differences in the association between disability and body mass index among the oldest-old in China.,https://www.ncbi.nlm.nih.gov/pubmed/30529805,Archives of gerontology and geriatrics,2019 02 04,"The issue of disability prevention is considered as a priority for research in geriatrics in modern society, especially for the oldest-old.

Here, we showed that DHA could repress the migration and invasion of GBM U251 cells and promote their apoptosis in a dose- and time-dependent manner, indicating that DHA has an anticancer effect on GBM cells. Whole-transcriptome analysis indicated that DHA treatment mainly regulates the genes associated with receptor binding, oxidoreductase activity, organic acid transmembrane transporter activity, and carboxylic acid transmembrane transporter activity. Long non-coding RNAs (LncRNAs) involved in the regulation network of DHA were also identified, and their targets were assigned to the Gene Ontology (GO) categories.

However, how to instantly deliver multiple neoantigens for efficient anti-tumor immunity is still challenging. Here, we established a SpyCatcher-modified ferritin nanoparticle platform, which permits convenient and stable covalent conjugation with tumor specific antigens containing SpyTag in a click-link manner. These ferritin nanoparticles are rapidly drained to lymph nodes and target dendritic cells, especially CD8α+ population, upon subcutaneous immunization. Ferritin nanoparticles carrying HPV16 oncogene E7 peptide antigen or MC38 tumor derived mutant neoantigens elicit about 2-3 folds enhanced antigen-specific cytotoxic T lymphocyte (CTL) response than soluble peptide antigens and significantly suppress the growth of E7-related or MC38 tumors. The anti-tumor effect was further enhanced in combination with PD-1 checkpoint blockade.

Little is known, however, about their genotoxicity and potential to induce gene expression regulation. Despite recent efforts to study the underlying mechanisms of genotoxicity of SNPs, inconsistent results create a challenge. A variety of factors determine particle-cell interactions and underlying mechanisms. Further, high-throughput studies are required to carefully assess the impact of silica nanoparticle physicochemical properties on induction of genotoxic response in different cell lines and animal models. In this article, we review the strategies available for evaluation of genotoxicity of nanoparticles (NPs), survey current status of silica nanoparticle gene alteration and genotoxicity, discuss particle-mediated inflammation as a contributing factor to genotoxicity, identify existing gaps and suggest future directions for this research.",Linking chromatin composition and structural dynamics at the nucleosome level.,https://www.ncbi.nlm.nih.gov/pubmed/30529788,Current opinion in structural biology,2019 05 28,"Nucleosomes are fundamental units of chromatin compaction, which organize ∼200 DNA base pairs using an octamer of histone proteins. Their ubiquitous presence in the cell nucleus since the first eukaryotes compelled the chromatin machinery to coevolve and learn how to exploit various modes of nucleosome dynamics and sense differences in nucleosome composition. Alterations to histone or DNA sequences, post-translational modifications (PTM) of histones, recruitment of chromatin proteins modulate nucleosome dyn amics and provide epigenetic regulation to the DNA processing pathways (transcription, replication, repair, etc.). Our understanding of this complex interplay between nucleosome composition, dynamics and functioning is constantly evolving through new insights and discoveries.

In this study the influence of the type and concentration of divalent metal cation present was investigated on a single arginyl-glycinyl-aspartic acid (RGD) ligand across the αv integrin sub-family and single αv integrin (αvβ6) with different ligands. These relationships were determined using radioligand binding studies completed with [3H] ligands and purified αv integrin protein preparations. The binding of [3H]compound 1 to the RGD site on individual αv integrins demonstrated a unique profile in relation to the type and concentration of divalent metal cation present. The use of physiological concentrations of Mg2+ and Ca2+ in simulated lung fluid altered the αv integrin selectivity profile of [3H]compound 1 in terms of affinity and the level of receptor occupancy. In addition, different RGD ligands for the αvβ6 integrin behaved differently under the same divalent metal cation conditions. In conclusion, this study demonstrates the need to determine the individual relationship between RGD ligands and the integrins they may engage in vivo, especially when determining selectivity profiles for potential RGD-mimetic small molecule therapeutics, with organ and disease state also considered.",Antiproliferative and antiangiogenic effect of Amblyomma sculptum (Acari: Ixodidae) crude saliva in endothelial cells in vitro.,https://www.ncbi.nlm.nih.gov/pubmed/30529768,Biomedicine & pharmacotherapy = Biomedecine & pharmacotherapie,2019 04 18,"Neovascularization, a process that includes vasculogenesis and angiogenesis, may be a physiological or pathologic event, but in any cases the phenomenon is related to the formation of vascular net and sprouting of endothelial cells from preexisting blood vessel. The tumor environment, which counts on the tumor cell proliferation, is plenty of proangiogenic factors, such as angiogenin, TGF (α and β), FGF, VEGF, all of them playing a crucial role in angiogenesis, an important hallmark of cancer frequently related to a poor prognosis. Therefore, therapies focusing the inhibition of cancer neovasculogenesis have become an interesting strategy for the development of antitumor therapies. In this work, we investigate the effect of tick saliva on the human endothelial cells, in order to understand its inhibitory effects on angiogenesis. To this end, the HUVEC cells were used as model of angiogenesis in vitro and the anti-proliferative, anti-migratory, cytotoxicity was evaluated. Our data depicts that saliva impairs cell development by causing structural changes while precludes cell proliferation and migration, that are crucial events related to angiogenesis.

Breast cancer constitutes the predominant cancer encountered in women. Triple negative breast cancer (TNBC) is the most notorious form of breast cancer which involves absence of the estrogen, progesterone and human epidermal growth factor receptor (EGFR) on breast cancer cells. It is a real challenge for oncologists owing to the recurrence and metastasis which result in poor prognosis. Conventional therapies employed in treatment of TNBC suffer from issues of poor bioavailability, poor cellular uptake, resistance, and undesirable off-site toxicities. Nanosized delivery systems, herein designated as nanosoldiers can be smartly designed to be equipped with multiple weapons (drugs, genetic materials, photosensitizers, etc.) to fight the battle against recalcitrant TNBC in a myriad of ways such as bioavailability enhancement, targeted uptake by the TNBC cells, on-demand drug delivery at tumour site, combination therapy, multimodal therapy, photodynamic therapy, photothermal therapy, anti-metastatic approaches, theranostics, etc. The versatility of nanosoldiers with respect to their material of composition, their mechanism of drug loading and release, ability to modify in vivo drug disposition, multifunctional characteristics enabling detection, treatment, and monitoring, etc. endows them with incredible potential to destroy the intractable TNBC cells. The focus of the review is to highlight the extraordinary potential of nanocarriers in treatment of TNBC and few challenges which need to be overcome for these nanosoldiers to form a part of the clinical armamentarium of anticancer agents.",Polygenic risk for schizophrenia and associated brain structural changes: A systematic review.,https://www.ncbi.nlm.nih.gov/pubmed/30529765,Comprehensive psychiatry,2018 12 15,"Genome wide association studies (GWAS) of schizophrenia allow the generation of Polygenic Risk Scores (PRS).

The brain-related enhancer map was collected from ENCODE and Roadmap Epigenomics (ENCODE + Roadmap) including 489,581 enhancers. Firstly, the chromosomal enhancer maps of four brain regions were aligned with the ADHD GWAS summary data in order to obtain enhancer SNPs. Then the significant enhancers SNPs were subjected to the gene set enrichment analysis (GSEA) for identifying ADHD associated gene sets. A total of 866 pathways and 4 brain tissues were analyzed in this study. We detected several candidate genes for ADHD, such as AHI1, ALG2 and DNM1. We also detected several candidate biological pathways associated with ADHD, such as Reactome SEMA4D in semaphorin signaling and Reactome NCAM1 interactions. Our findings may provide a novel insight into the complex genetic mechanism of ADHD.",TGFβ and BMPRII signalling pathways in the pathogenesis of pulmonary arterial hypertension.,https://www.ncbi.nlm.nih.gov/pubmed/30529762,Drug discovery today,2019 03 28,"Pulmonary arterial hypertension (PAH) is a severe condition characterised by remodelling of precapillary pulmonary arteries sometimes associated with mutations in the bone morphogenetic protein receptor type 2 (BMPR2) gene.

In this Keynote, we review the potential mechanisms by which the imbalance of BMP/TGFβ signalling contributes to endothelial dysfunction, vascular remodelling, inflammation and disordered angiogenesis in PAH. Additionally, we highlight how currently used drugs can influence BMP/TGFβ signalling.

While animal studies have examined the long-term detrimental effects of early-life ketamine exposure, there is a paucity of information on the immediate effects of ketamine following subchronic administration in the adolescence period. Adolescent rats were assigned into four groups of 10 animals each, administered intraperitoneal (i.p) injections of vehicle or one of three doses of ketamine (7.5, 15 or 30 mg/kg daily) for 8 weeks, and then exposed to behavioural paradigms. Rats were then euthanised after an overnight fast, and blood taken was used for measurement of metabolic indices. The brains were dissected out and either homogenised for estimation of neurochemical parameters, or processed for histological and immunohistochemical studies. Results showed that subchronic administration of ketamine was associated with a lesser weight gain inspite of an increase in food intake across the treatment groups. There was a dose-dependent increase in open-field novelty-induced behaviours, a decline in spatial working-memory, and an anxiolytic effect in the elevated-plus maze. There was associated derangement of serum triglyceride, and increase in brain glutamate levels, acetylcholinesterase activity, plasma/brain oxidative stress parameters, caspase-3 activity and biochemical indices of hepatic and renal function. Ketamine administration was also associated with neurodegenerative changes in the cerebral cortex, hippocampus, cerebellum and the pons. In conclusion, subchronic administration of ketamine to adolescent rats was associated with dose-related memory loss, oxidative stress and possibly caspase-3 mediated neurodegenerative changes.",Structural Basis of Interleukin-5 Inhibition by the Small Cyclic Peptide AF17121.,https://www.ncbi.nlm.nih.gov/pubmed/30529748,Journal of molecular biology,2019 02 15,"Interleukin-5 (IL-5) is a T-helper cell of subtype 2 cytokine involved in many aspects of eosinophil life. Eosinophilic granulocytes play a pathogenic role in the progression of atopic diseases, such as allergy, asthma and atopic dermatitis and hypereosinophilic syndromes. Here, eosinophils upon activation degranulate leading to the release of proinflammatory proteins and mediators stored in intracellular vesicles termed granula thereby causing local inflammation, which when persisting leads to tissue damage and organ failure. As a key regulator of eosinophil function, IL-5 therefore presents a major pharmaceutical target and approaches to interfere with IL-5 receptor activation are of great interest. Here we present the structure of the IL-5 inhibiting peptide AF17121 bound to the extracellular domain of the IL-5 receptor IL-5Rα. The small 18mer cyclic peptide snugly fits into the wrench-like cleft of the IL-5 receptor, thereby blocking access of key residues for IL-5 binding. While AF17121 and IL-5 seemingly bind to a similar epitope at IL-5Rα, functional studies show that recognition and binding of both ligands differ. Using the structure data, peptide variants with improved IL-5 inhibition have been generated, which might present valuable starting points for superior peptide-based IL-5 antagonists.",Assessing the Intricate Balance of Intermolecular Interactions upon Self-Association of Intrinsically Disordered Proteins.,https://www.ncbi.nlm.nih.gov/pubmed/30529747,Journal of molecular biology,2019 01 28,"Attractive interactions between intrinsically disordered proteins can be crucial for the functionality or, on the contrary, lead to the formation of harmful aggregates. For obtaining a molecular understanding of intrinsically disordered proteins and their interactions, computer simulations have proven to be a valuable complement to experiments. In this study, we present a coarse-grained model and its applications to a system dominated by attractive interactions, namely, the self-association of the saliva protein Statherin. SAXS experiments show that Statherin self-associates with increased protein concentration, and that both an increased temperature and a lower ionic strength decrease the size of the formed complexes. The model captures the observed trends and provides insight into the size distribution. Hydrophobic interaction is considered to be the major driving force of the self-association, while electrostatic repulsion represses the growth. In addition, the model suggests that the decrease of association number with increased temperature is of entropic origin.",Crystal Structure of Aldehyde Dehydrogenase 16 Reveals Trans-Hierarchical Structural Similarity and a New Dimer.,https://www.ncbi.nlm.nih.gov/pubmed/30529746,Journal of molecular biology,2019 02 19,"The aldehyde dehydrogenase (ALDH) superfamily is a vast group of enzymes that catalyze the NAD+-dependent oxidation of aldehydes to carboxylic acids. ALDH16 is perhaps the most enigmatic member of the superfamily, owing to its extra C-terminal domain of unknown function and the absence of the essential catalytic cysteine residue in certain non-bacterial ALDH16 sequences. Herein we report the first production of recombinant ALDH16, the first biochemical characterization of ALDH16, and the first crystal structure of ALDH16. Recombinant expression systems were generated for the bacterial ALDH16 from Loktanella sp. and human ALDH16A1. Four high-resolution crystal structures of Loktanella ALDH16 were determined. Loktanella ALDH16 is found to be a bona fide enzyme, exhibiting NAD+-binding, ALDH activity, and esterase activity. In contrast, human ALDH16A1 apparently lacks measurable aldehyde oxidation activity, suggesting that it is a pseudoenzyme, consistent with the absence of the catalytic Cys in its sequence. The fold of ALDH16 comprises three domains: NAD+-binding, catalytic, and C-terminal. The latter is unique to ALDH16 and features a Rossmann fold connected to a protruding β-flap. The tertiary structural interactions of the C-terminal domain mimic the quaternary structural interactions of the classic ALDH superfamily dimer, a phenomenon we call ""trans-hierarchical structural similarity."" ALDH16 forms a unique dimer in solution, which mimics the classic ALDH superfamily dimer-of-dimer tetramer. Small-angle X-ray scattering shows that human ALDH16A1 has the same dimeric structure and fold as Loktanella ALDH16. We suggest that the Loktanella ALDH16 structure may be considered to be the archetype of the ALDH16 family.",Ecotoxicoproteomics: A decade of progress in our understanding of anthropogenic impact on the environment.,https://www.ncbi.nlm.nih.gov/pubmed/30529745,Journal of proteomics,2019 03 12,"Anthropogenic pollutants are found worldwide. Their fate and effects on human and ecosystem health must be appropriately monitored. Today, ecotoxicology is focused on the development of new methods to assess the impact of pollutant toxicity on living organisms and ecosystems. In situ biomonitoring often uses sentinel animals for which, ideally, molecular biomarkers have been defined thanks to which environmental quality can be assessed. In this context, high-throughput proteomics methods offer an attractive approach to study the early molecular responses of organisms to environmental stressors. This approach can be used to identify toxicity pathways, to quantify more precisely novel biomarkers, and to draw the possible adverse outcome pathways. In this review, we discuss the major advances in ecotoxicoproteomics made over the last decade and present the current state of knowledge, emphasizing the technological and conceptual advancements that allowed major breakthroughs in this field, which aims to ""make our planet great again"". SIGNIFICANCE: Ecotoxicoproteomics is a protein-centric methodology that is useful for ecotoxicology and could have future applications as part of chemical risk assessment and environmental monitoring. Ecotoxicology employing non-model sentinel organisms with highly divergent phylogenetic backgrounds aims to preserve the functioning of ecosystems and the overall range of biological species supporting them. The classical proteomics workflow involves protein identification, functional annotation, and extrapolation of toxicity across species. Thus, it is essential to develop multi-omics approaches in order to unravel molecular information and construct the most suitable databases for protein identification and pathway analysis in non-model species. Current instrumentation and available software allow relevant combined transcriptomic/proteomic studies to be performed for almost any species. This review summarizes these approaches and illustrates how they can be implemented in ecotoxicology for routine biomonitoring.",A proteomic approach to identify novel disease biomarkers in LCAT deficiency.,https://www.ncbi.nlm.nih.gov/pubmed/30529744,Journal of proteomics,2019 03 12,"Genetic LCAT deficiency is a rare recessive autosomal disease due to loss-of-function mutations in the gene coding for the enzyme lecithin:cholesterol acyltransferase (LCAT). Homozygous carriers are characterized by corneal opacity, haemolytic anaemia and renal disease, which represent the first cause of morbidity and mortality in these subjects. Diagnostic and prognostic markers capable of early detecting declining kidney function in these subjects are not available, and the specific serum or urine proteomic signature of LCAT deficient carriers has never been assessed. Taking advantage of a proteomic approach, we performed 2-DE analysis of carriers' plasma and identified proteins present at different concentration in samples from homozygous carriers. Our data confirm the well-known alterations in the concentration of circulating apolipoproteins, with a statistically significant decrease of both apoA-I and apoA-II and a statistically significant increase of apoC-III. Furthermore, we observed increased level of alpha-1-antitrypsin, zinc-alpha-2-glycoprotein and retinol-binding protein 4, and reduced level of clusterin and haptoglobin. Interestingly, only beta but not alpha subunit of haptoglobin is significant reduced in homozygous subjects. Despite the limited sample size, our findings set the basis for assessing the identified protein in a larger population and for correlating their levels with clinical markers of renal function and anaemia. SIGNIFICANCE: This investigation defines the effects of LCAT deficiency on the level of the major plasma proteins in homozygous and heterozygous carriers. Increase for some proteins, with different function, together with a drop for haptoglobin, and specifically for haptoglobin beta chains, are reported for the first time as part of a coherent signature. We are glad to have the opportunity to report our findings on this subject, which is one of the main interests for our research group, when Journal of Proteomics celebrates its 10th anniversary. With its various sections devoted to different areas of research, this journal is a privileged forum for publishing proteomic investigations without restrictions either in sample type or in technical approach. It is as well a privileged forum for reviewing literature data on various topics related to proteomics investigation, as colleagues in our research group have done over the years; by the way, a good share of the reviewed papers were as well reports published in Journal of Proteomics itself. The journal also offers opportunities for focused surveys through thematic issues devoted to a variety of subjects, timely selected for their current relevance in research; it was an honour for colleagues in our group to recently act as editors of one of those.

Indeed, managing huge amounts of data imposes the replacement of the classical deductive approach with a data-driven inductive approach, so to generate mechanistical hypotheses from data. Data reduction is a crucial step in the process of proteomics data analysis, because of the sparsity of significant features in big datasets. Thus, feature selection methods are applied to obtain a set of features based on which a proteomics signature can be drawn, with a functional significance (e.g., classification, diagnosis, prognosis). In this frame, the aim of the present review article is to give an overview of the methods available for proteomics data analysis, with a focus on biomedical translational research. Suggestions for the choice of the most appropriate standard statistical procedures are presented to perform data reduction by feature selection, cross-validation and functional analysis of proteomics profiles. SIGNIFICANCE: The proteome, including all so-called ""proteoforms"", represents the highest level of complexity of biomolecules when compared to the other ""-omes"" (i.e., genome, transcriptome). For this reason, the use of proper data reduction strategies is mandatory for proteomics data analysis. However, the strategies to be employed for feature selection must be carefully chosen, since many different approaches exist based on both input data and desired output. So far, a well-established decision-making workflow for proteomics data analysis is lacking, opening up to misleading and incorrect data analysis and interpretation. In this review article many statistical approaches are described and compared for their application in the field of biomedical research, in order to suggest the reader the most suitable analysis pathway and to avoid mistakes.",Postmortem protein stability investigations of the human hepatic drug-metabolizing cytochrome P450 enzymes CYP1A2 and CYP3A4 using mass spectrometry.,https://www.ncbi.nlm.nih.gov/pubmed/30529742,Journal of proteomics,2019 02 06,"Variability in expression and activity of hepatic drug-metabolizing cytochrome P450 (CYP) enzymes can play a causal role in fatal intoxication cases and is thus of forensic interest. We investigated the feasibility of LC-MS/MS based quantification and in vitro enzyme activity measurements of two major drug-metabolizing enzymes CYP1A2 and CYP3A4 in postmortem human liver microsomes (HLM). In autopsy cases (postmortem interval 24-36 h) we found CYP1A2 and CYP3A4 protein levels similar to that measured in a non-decayed reference HLM pool, whereas CYP1A2 and CYP3A4 enzyme activities were absent or severely decreased. Stability studies showed that CYP1A2 and CYP3A4 protein abundances were relatively stable in tissue stored in vitro for up to seven days at 4 °C. When tissue was stored for more than one day at 21 °C variable and case-specific decay patterns were observed, and CYP abundances declined especially after 3-4 days storage. Investigations of 50 autopsy cases revealed mean CYP1A2 and CYP3A4 levels of 49 and 47 pmol per mg HLM protein and inter-individual variabilities similar to those reported in other studies. This study supports postmortem quantification of CYP proteins in autopsy hepatic tissue by mass spectrometry. SIGNIFICANCE: This study indicates that MS-based detection of drug-metabolizing cytochrome P450 (CYP) proteins is achievable in postmortem hepatic tissue and that acceptable quantification data are obtainable but dependent on the storage conditions and postmortem sampling time. CYP abundance data could contribute to a conceivable way of assessing individual CYP activity phenotypes in a postmortem context.",Proteomic analysis of protein homeostasis and aggregation.,https://www.ncbi.nlm.nih.gov/pubmed/30529741,Journal of proteomics,2019 03 12,"Protein homeostasis (proteostasis) refers to the ability of cells to preserve the correct balance between protein synthesis, folding and degradation. Proteostasis is essential for optimal cell growth and survival under stressful conditions. Various extracellular and intracellular stresses including heat shock, oxidative stress, proteasome malfunction, mutations and aging-related modifications can result in disturbed proteostasis manifested by enhanced misfolding and aggregation of proteins. To limit protein misfolding and aggregation cells have evolved various strategies including molecular chaperones, proteasome system and autophagy. Molecular chaperones assist folding of proteins, protect them from denaturation and facilitate renaturation of the misfolded polypeptides, whereas proteasomes and autophagosomes remove the irreversibly damaged proteins. The impairment of proteostasis results in protein aggregation that is a major pathological hallmark of numerous age-related disorders, such as cataract, Alzheimer's, Parkinson's, Huntington's, and prion diseases. To discover protein markers and speed up diagnosis of neurodegenerative diseases accompanied by protein aggregation, proteomic tools have increasingly been used in recent years. Systematic and exhaustive analysis of the changes that occur in the proteomes of affected tissues and biofluids in humans or in model organisms is one of the most promising approaches to reveal mechanisms underlying protein aggregation diseases, improve their diagnosis and develop therapeutic strategies. Significance: In this review we outline the elements responsible for maintaining cellular proteostasis and present the overview of proteomic studies focused on protein-aggregation diseases. These studies provide insights into the mechanisms responsible for age-related disorders and reveal new potential biomarkers for Alzheimer's, Parkinson's, Huntigton's and prion diseases.",Osteoarthritis year in review 2018: rehabilitation and outcomes.,https://www.ncbi.nlm.nih.gov/pubmed/30529739,Osteoarthritis and cartilage,2019 02 26,"Conduct a systematic review of systematic reviews and randomised controlled trials (RCTs) from the past year evaluating rehabilitation for people with osteoarthritis, and provide narrative synthesis of findings focused on core recommended treatments for osteoarthritis (exercise, education, biomechanical interventions, weight loss)."

We previously developed wrapsome® (WS), an ~100 nm liposomal nanoparticle that can encapsulate siRNA, and reported that WS accumulates in tumors in vivo and inhibits their growth by an enhanced permeability and retention effect. In the present study, we evaluated the pharmacokinetics of nucleic acid-containing nanoparticles by combining dynamic positron emission tomography (PET) imaging and liquid chromatography-tandem mass spectrometry (LC/MS/MS) analysis. An 18-mer phosphorothioate oligodeoxynucleotide (ODN), trabedersen, was used as a model drug and was encapsulated in WS. Dynamic PET imaging and time-activity curve analysis of WS-encapsulated 64Cu-labeled ODNs administered to mice with MIA PaCa-2 subcutaneous xenograft tumors showed tumor accumulation (~3% injected dose per gram (%ID/g)) and liver accumulation (~30 %ID/g) at 24 h. Under these conditions, LC/MS/MS analysis showed that the level of intact ODNs was 1.62 %ID/g in the tumor and 1.70 %ID/g in the liver. From these pharmacokinetic data, the intact/accumulated ODN ratios were calculated using the following equation: intact/accumulated ODN ratio (%) = %ID/g LC/MS/MS, tissue, mean/%ID/g PET, tissue, mean × 100. Interestingly, the ratios for the tumor and kidney were maintained at 20-50% over 48 h after administration of the WS-encapsulated form. In contrast, the ratio for the liver rapidly decreased at 24 h, showing the same pattern as that for naked ODN. These different patterns indicate that WS effectively protected the ODN in the tumor and kidney, but protected it less efficiently in the liver. A combined approach of dynamic PET imaging and LC/MS/MS analysis will assist the development of nanoparticle-encapsulated nucleic acid drugs, such as those using WSs, to determine their detailed pharmacokinetics.",A multifunctional drug nanocarrier for efficient anticancer therapy.,https://www.ncbi.nlm.nih.gov/pubmed/30529724,Journal of controlled release : official journal of the Controlled Release Society,2019 01 20,"So far, the success of anticancer nanomedicines has been moderate due to their lack of adequate targeting properties and/or to their difficulties for penetrating tumors. Here we report a multifunctional drug nanocarrier consisting of hyaluronic acid nanocapsules conjugated with the tumor homing peptide tLyp1, which exhibits both, dual targeting properties (to the tumor and to the lymphatics), and enhanced tumor penetration. Data from a 3D co-culture in vitro model showed the capacity of these nanocapsules to interact with the NRP1 receptors over-expressed in cancer cells. The targeting capacity of the nanocapsules was evidenced in orthotopic lung cancer-bearing mice, using docetaxel as a standard drug. The results showed a dramatic accumulation of docetaxel in the tumor (37-fold the one achieved with Taxotere®). This biodistribution profile correlated with the high efficacy shown in terms of tumor growth regression and drastic reduction of metastasis in the lymphatics. When efficacy was validated in a pancreatic patient-derived tumor, the nanocapsule's activity was comparable to that of a dose ten times higher of Abraxane®. Multi-functionality was found to be the key to the success of this new therapy.",Towards the enzymatic formation of artificial metal base pairs with a carboxy-imidazole-modified nucleotide.,https://www.ncbi.nlm.nih.gov/pubmed/30529723,Journal of inorganic biochemistry,2018 12 23,"The identification of synthetic nucleotides that sustain the formation of orthogonal, unnatural base pairs is an important goal in synthetic biology. Such artificial synthons have been used for the generation of semi-synthetic organisms as well as functional nucleic acids with enhanced binding properties. The enzymatic formation of artificial metal-base pairs is a vastly underexplored and alluring alternative to existing systems. Here, we report the synthesis and biochemical characterization of 1‑(2-deoxy‑β‑d‑ribofuranosyl) imidazole‑4‑carboxylate nucleoside triphosphate (dImCTP) which is equipped with a carboxylic acid moiety on the imidazole moiety in order to increase the coordination environment to [2 + 2] and [2 + 1]. A clear metal dependence was observed for the single incorporation of the modified nucleotide into DNA by the DNA polymerase from Thermus aquaticus (Taq). The presence of AgI in primer extension reactions conducted with combinations of 1‑(2‑deoxy‑β‑d‑ribofuranosyl) imidazole nucleoside triphosphate (dImTP) and dImCTP supported the unusual [2 + 1] coordination pattern. The efficiency of the tailing reactions mediated by the terminal deoxynucleotidyl transferase (TdT) was markedly improved when using dImCTP instead of dImTP. Even though products with multiple modified nucleotides were not observed, the appendage of additional metal binding ligands on the imidazole nucleobase appears to be a valid approach to improve the biochemical properties of modified triphosphates in the context of an expansion of the genetic alphabet with metal base pairs.",How copper ions and membrane environment influence the structure of the human and chicken tandem repeats domain?,https://www.ncbi.nlm.nih.gov/pubmed/30529722,Journal of inorganic biochemistry,2018 12 23,"Prion proteins (PrPs) from different species have the enormous ability to anchor copper ions. The N-terminal domain of human prion protein (hPrP) contains four tandem repeats of the -PHGGGWGQ- octapeptide sequence. This octarepeat domain can bind up to four Cu2+ ions. Similarly to hPrP, chicken prion protein (chPrP) is able to interact with Cu2+ through the tandem hexapeptide -HNPGYP- region (residues 53-94). In this work, we focused on the human octapeptide repeat (human Octa4, hPrP60-91) (Ac-PHGGGWGQPHGGGWGQPHGGGWGQPHGGGWGQ-NH2) and chicken hexapeptide repeat (chicken Hexa4, chPrP54-77) (Ac-HNPGYPHNPGYPHNPGYPHNPGYP-NH2) prion protein fragments. Due to the fact that PrP is a membrane-anchored glycoprotein and its unstructured and flexible N-terminal domain may interact with the lipid bilayer, our studies were carried out in presence of the surfactant sodium dodecyl sulfate (SDS) mimicking the membrane environment in vitro. The main objective of this work was to understand the effects of copper ion on the structural rearrangements of the human and chicken N-terminal repeat domain. The obtained results provide a fundamental first step in describing the thermodynamic (potentiometric titrations) and structural properties of Cu(II) binding (UV-Vis, NMR, CD spectroscopy) to both human Octa4 and chicken Hexa4 repeats in both a DMSO/water and SDS micelle environment. Interestingly, in SDS environment, both ligands indicate different copper coordination modes, which results of the conformational changes in micelle environment. Our results strongly support that copper binding mode strongly depends on the protein backbone structure. Moreover, we focused on previously obtained results for amyloidogenic human and chicken fragments in membrane mimicking environment.","Isolation and phylogenetic analysis of an emerging Senecavirus A in China, 2017.",https://www.ncbi.nlm.nih.gov/pubmed/30529721,"Infection, genetics and evolution : journal of molecular epidemiology and evolutionary genetics in infectious diseases",2019 02 04,"Senecavirus A (SVA), which is associated with porcine vesicular disease and high mortality in neonatal piglets, is a small non-enveloped RNA virus and a member of Picornaviridae family.

In our study, the complete genome sequence of SVA CH/FuJ/2017 strain has been determined. The viral genome was 7285 nt in length. The homology analysis indicated that the gene sequences of polyprotein and VP1 in SVA CH/FuJ/2017 shared highest nucleotide identities with American SVA isolates; and polyprotein showed the highest similarity with American SVA isolates. The phylogenetic analysis based on polyprotein and VP1 nucleotide sequences indicated that SVA CH/FuJ/2017 was closely related to American SVA isolates. The results revealed that the novel SVA strain was closely related to those SVA strains that were isolated in America. Hence, the retrospective study is important for tracing the probable origin of China SVA strains.",Detection of three novel atypical porcine pestivirus strains in newborn piglets with congenital tremor in southern China.,https://www.ncbi.nlm.nih.gov/pubmed/30529720,"Infection, genetics and evolution : journal of molecular epidemiology and evolutionary genetics in infectious diseases",2019 02 04,"Atypical porcine pestivirus (APPV) have been discovered in swine herds from three provinces in China, suggesting a wide distribution in China. This study reports the occurrence of three novel APPV strains in China. They were detected from newborn piglets with clinical signs of congenital tremors (CT) in Guangdong Province, China. The complete genomic sequences of three novel APPV strains exhibited only 80.5%-84.1% nucleotide sequences homology with other APPV reference sequences available in GenBank. Phylogenetic analysis showed that these novel APPV strains formed independent branch from the American, German, Netherlandish, Australian and other Chinese strains. These results will help us better understand the epidemiology and genetic characteristics of APPV in China.",Detection and genetic characterization of kobuvirus in cats: The first molecular evidence from Northeast China.,https://www.ncbi.nlm.nih.gov/pubmed/30529719,"Infection, genetics and evolution : journal of molecular epidemiology and evolutionary genetics in infectious diseases",2019 02 04,"Feline kobuvirus (FeKoV), a novel picornavirus of the genus kobuvirus, was initially identified in the feces of cats with diarrhea in South Korea in 2013. To date, there is only one report of the circulation of kobuvirus in cats in southern China. To investigate the presence and genetic variability of FeKoV in northeast China, 197 fecal samples were collected from 105 cats with obvious diarrhea and 92 asymptomatic cats in Shenyang, Jinzhou, Changchun, Jilin and Harbin regions, Northeast China, and viruses were detected by RT-PCR with universal primers targeting all kobuviruses. Kobuvirus was identified in 28 fecal samples with an overall prevalence of 14.2% (28/197) of which 20 samples were co-infected with feline parvovirus (FPV) and/or feline bocavirus (FBoV). Diarrhoeic cats had a higher kobuvirus prevalence (19.1%, 20/105) than asymptomatic cats (8.7%, 8/92). By genetic analysis based on partial 3D gene, all kobuvirus-positive samples were more closely related to previous FeKoV strains with high identities of 90.5%-97.8% and 96.6%-100% at the nucleotide and amino acid levels. Additionally, phylogenetic analysis based on the complete VP1 gene indicated that all FeKoV strains identified in this study were placed into a cluster, which separated from other reference strains previously reported, and three identical amino acid substitutions were present at the C-terminal of the VP1 protein for these FeKoV strains. Furthermore, two complete FeKoV polyprotein genomes were successfully obtained from two positive samples and designated 16JZ0605 and 17CC0811, respectively. The two strains shared 92.9%-94.9% nucleotide identities and 96.8%-98.4% amino acid identities to FeKoV prototype strains. Phylogenetic analysis indicated that FeKoVs were clustered according to their geographical regions, albeit with limited sequences support. This study provides the first molecular evidence that FeKoV circulates in cats in northeast China, and these FeKoVs exhibit genetic diversity and unique evolutionary trend.",Age-dependent semiology of frontal lobe seizures.,https://www.ncbi.nlm.nih.gov/pubmed/30529718,Epilepsy research,2019 06 04,"Frontal lobe epilepsy is the second most frequent origin of focal epilepsy.

It is responsive to social experiences in close relationships, though evidence across studies is not entirely consistent. Guided by previous literature, we investigated individual and environmental factors predicting and presumably affecting children's oxytocin (OT) response during mother-child interaction. by focusing on children's OXTR genotype, and maternal behavior, respectively. This was achieved by assessing salivary OT levels of 88 Portuguese preschoolers prior to and following a mother-child interaction task, and by genotyping children's OXTR SNP rs53576. Maternal interactive behavior was assessed using Ainsworth scales. Results indicated that child genotype and mother's sensitive responsiveness interacted in predicting change in child OT concentrations from before to after the interaction. Specifically, Genotypic differences emerged under conditions of low maternal sensitive responsiveness: OT levels increased over time for children with the GG genotype when maternal sensitive responsiveness was low, but no such genotypic differences were evident when mothers were highly sensitive responsive. Findings provide preliminary support for the notion that increased understanding of children's OT and close relationships requires consideration of both individual and environmental factors.",Resting amygdala connectivity and basal sympathetic tone as markers of chronic hypervigilance.,https://www.ncbi.nlm.nih.gov/pubmed/30529716,Psychoneuroendocrinology,2019 03 15,"Chronic hypervigilance, a state of sustained alertness and hyperarousal in the absence of threat, has been shown to predict poorer clinical outcomes post-trauma. An exaggerated and persistent amygdala alerting response to affective information has been proposed as a reactivity-based, and thus indirect, marker of hypervigilance. However, because chronic hypervigilance is a persistent rather than reactive state, it should be directly observable under resting-state conditions without the need for exposure to affectively charged stimuli."

The evaluation of the efficacy of therapies on pain has been driven by static measures, and a circadian cycle has been suggested. The aim of this study is to evaluate the pain dynamics in SFN. A total of 165 patients completed a standardized pain diary 4 times per week over a 4-week period. Patients used the 11-point numeric rating scale for average diurnal, nocturnal, and maximum pain, taking into account the circumstances in which pain emerged most. Medication used, SFN-related complaints, sleep quality, and anatomic location of pain were also assessed. Neuropathic pain showed a length-dependent pattern. For pain intensity, marginal higher pain scores at night than during the day were shown, likely not clinically meaningful, with stable lower pain intensities in weekends compared with weekdays. The average pain intensity was stable during the 4-week period. Maximum pain was experienced mainly at rest and during sleep. Besides, pain intensity at night showed an inverse relationship with quality of sleep. In conclusion, for trials in SFN it is justified to use pain scores from any time of the day during short measurement periods. PERSPECTIVE: This article presents for the first time the pain dynamics of SFN. The effect of pharmacologic treatment in SFN is often disappointing, partly owing to insufficient trial designs. The results of this study have added value in the development of new proper clinical trials in SFN.",Differential Predictors of Pain Severity Over 12 Months Following Noncatastrophic Injury Sustained in a Road Traffic Crash.,https://www.ncbi.nlm.nih.gov/pubmed/30529696,The journal of pain : official journal of the American Pain Society,2019 06 11,"There is paucity of prospective studies that have examined rates and prognostic indicators of pain severity after a road traffic crash injury. This cohort study involved 1,854 participants aged ≥17 years with a noncatastrophic injury. Primary analyses of pain severity involved 1604 individuals who reported any pain since the injury at baseline Of these, 1,188 and 972 participants were reexamined at the 6- and 12-month follow-up, respectively. The mean pain severity (primary study outcome) was assessed using a numeric rating scale (NRS), and a range of possible pain predictors were assessed. A mean pain NRS score of 4.9 was observed at baseline, and the mean NRS score was 2.1 at the 12-month follow-up. At the 6- and 12-month follow-up, 21% and 17.5% reported clinically significant pain (NRS score of ≥5), respectively. After multivariable adjustment, key predictors of pain severity ratings over the 12 months included the following, which were measured at baseline: age, sex, education, claim compensation, spine/back injury, being a bicyclist, physical well-being, pain-related catastrophizing, pain-related disability, and trauma-related and general psychological distress. Clinically significant pain was experienced by just >1 in 6 participants 12 months after injury. Several independent contributors to chronic pain identified in this study are modifiable, reinforcing their inclusion as targets in pain management programs. PERSPECTIVE: This cohort study involving participants who sustained a noncatastrophic injury in a road traffic crash established the predictors of pain severity over 12 months. Study findings reiterate and reinforce the importance of being cognizant of a wide spectrum of biopsychosocial predictors both in the management and rehabilitation of injured persons.",Disrupted Resting-State Functional Connectivity in Hippocampal Subregions After Sleep Deprivation.,https://www.ncbi.nlm.nih.gov/pubmed/30529694,Neuroscience,2019 03 18,"Previous studies have revealed that sleep deprivation (SD) alters hippocampal functional connectivity (FC). However, the effects of SD on the FC of hippocampal subregions are still unknown. In this study, we used a masked independent component analysis (mICA) to partition the hippocampus into several small regions and investigated the changes in the FC of each small region within the whole brain after 24 h of SD in 40 normal young subjects. First, we determined the optimal number of hippocampal subregions in a data-driven manner using a reproducibility analysis and chose 17 as the optimal number of hippocampal subregions. Second, we compared the FC of each subregion between rested wakefulness and SD states using mCIA. Reduced FC was found between the left junction of anterior and anterolateral hippocampal region and the default mode network and bilateral thalamus after SD (p < 0.05/17, Threshold-Free Cluster Enhancement correction, Bonferroni's corrected for the number of subregions). The FC between the left posterior of the anterolateral and the left lateral posterior of the anterior hippocampal regions and somatomotor network changed more negative after SD. However, increased FC was identified between the left middle hippocampal region and vision-related regions after SD. Our results reflect differential effects of SD on the FC in specific hippocampal regions and provide new insights into the impact of SD on the resting-state functional organization in the human brain.",Chronic Intermittent Hypoxia Induces Robust Astrogliosis in an Alzheimer's Disease-Relevant Mouse Model.,https://www.ncbi.nlm.nih.gov/pubmed/30529693,Neuroscience,2019 03 18,"Sleep disturbances are a common early symptom of neurodegenerative diseases, including Alzheimer's disease (AD) and other age-related dementias, and emerging evidence suggests that poor sleep may be an important contributor to development of amyloid pathology. Of the causes of sleep disturbances, it is estimated that 10-20% of adults in the United States have sleep-disordered breathing (SDB) disorder, with obstructive sleep apnea accounting for the majority of the SBD cases. The clinical and epidemiological data clearly support a link between sleep apnea and AD; yet, almost no experimental research is available exploring the mechanisms associated with this correlative link. Therefore, we exposed an AD-relevant mouse model (APP/PS1 KI) to chronic intermittent hypoxia (IH) (an experimental model of sleep apnea) to begin to describe one of the potential mechanisms by which SDB could increase the risk of dementia. Previous studies have found that astrogliosis is a contributor to neuropathology in models of chronic IH and AD; therefore, we hypothesized that a reactive astrocyte response might be a contributing mechanism in the neuroinflammation associated with sleep apnea. To test this hypothesis, 10-11-month-old wild-type (WT) and APP/PS1 KI mice were exposed to 10 hours of IH, daily for four weeks. At the end of four weeks brains were analyzed from amyloid burden and astrogliosis. No effect was found for chronic IH exposure on amyloid-beta levels or plaque load in the APP/PS1 KI mice. A significant increase in GFAP staining was found in the APP/PS1 KI mice following chronic IH exposure, but not in the WT mice.

Here, carbon felt (CF) is coated with manganese dioxide (MnO2) which acts as electron mediator in electroactive biofilm. A wrapping layer of conducting Poly 3,4-ethylenedioxythiophene is developed to protect the MnO2 and enhance electron transfer efficiency of MnO2 mediator. The hybrid bioanode (PEDOT/MnO2/CF bioanode) delivered the highest electron transfer efficiency (6.3 × 10-9 mol cm-2 s-1/2) and the highest capacitance of 4.78 F, much higher than bare CF bioanode (1.50 ± 0.04 × 10-9 mol cm-2 s-1/2 and 0.42 F). As a result, microbial fuel cells could produce a maximum power density of 1534 ± 13 mW m-2, approximately 57.7% higher than that with the bare carbon felt anode (972 ± 21 mW m-2). Possible mechanisms are proposed to help understanding the different function of the PEDOT and MnO2 on the anodic layer.

However, major efforts are needed to reduce their toxicity, optimize their efficacy, and reduce cancer chemoresistance to these agents. We previously identified a pyrrolo[2,3d]pyrimidine-based microtubule-depolymerizing agent (PP-13) that binds to the colchicine site of β-tubulin and exhibits anticancer properties in solid human cancer cells, including chemoresistant subtypes. Here, we investigated the therapeutic potential of PP-13 in vitro and in vivo. PP-13 induced a mitotic blockade and apoptosis in several cancer cells cultured in two-dimensions or three-dimensions spheroids, in conjunction with reduced cell proliferation. Capillary-like tube formation assays using HUVECs showed that PP-13 displayed antiangiogenic properties. It also inhibited cancer cell motility and invasion, in in vitro wound-healing and transwell migration assays. Low concentration PP-13 (130 nmol.L-1) treatment significantly reduced the metastatic invasiveness of human cancer cells engrafts on chicken chorioallantoic membrane. In nude mice, 0.5 or 1 mg.kg-1 PP-13 intraperitoneally administered three-times a week reduced the sizes of paclitaxel-refractory orthotopic breast tumors, delayed the progression of metastasis, and decreased the global metastatic load compared to 0.5 mg.kg-1 paclitaxel or vehicle alone. PP-13 did not show any apparent early adverse effect in vivo. These data suggest that PP-13 is a promising alternative to standard chemotherapy in antimitotic drug-refractory tumors, especially through its impact on metastasis.","Alcohol-induced ketonemia is associated with lowering of blood glucose, downregulation of gluconeogenic genes, and depletion of hepatic glycogen in type 2 diabetic db/db mice.",https://www.ncbi.nlm.nih.gov/pubmed/30529690,Biochemical pharmacology,2019 01 29,"Alcoholic ketoacidosis and diabetic ketoacidosis are life-threatening complications that share the characteristic features of high anion gap metabolic acidosis. Ketoacidosis is attributed in part to the massive release of ketone bodies (e.g., β-hydroxybutyrate; βOHB) from the liver into the systemic circulation. To date, the impact of ethanol consumption on systemic ketone concentration, glycemic control, and hepatic gluconeogenesis and glycogenesis remains largely unknown, especially in the context of type 2 diabetes. In the present study, ethanol intake (36% ethanol- and 36% fat-derived calories) by type 2 diabetic db/db mice for 9 days resulted in significant decreases in weight gain (∼19.5% ↓) and caloric intake (∼30% ↓). This was accompanied by a transition from macrovesicular-to-microvesicular hepatic steatosis with a modest increase in hepatic TG (∼37% ↑). Importantly, ethanol increased systemic βOHB concentration (∼8-fold ↑) with significant decreases in blood glucose (∼4-fold ↓) and plasma insulin and HOMA-IR index (∼3-fold ↓). In addition, ethanol enhanced hepatic βOHB content (∼5-fold ↑) and hmgcs2 mRNA expression (∼3.7-fold ↑), downregulated key gluconeogenic mRNAs (e.g., Pcx, Pck1, and G6pc), and depleted hepatic glycogen (∼4-fold ↓). Furthermore, ethanol intake led to significant decreases in the mRNA/protein expression and allosteric activation of glycogen synthase (GS) in liver tissues regardless of changes in the phosphorylation of GS, GSK-3β, or Akt. Together, our findings suggest that ethanol-induced ketonemia may occur in concomitance with significant lowering of blood glucose concentration, which may be attributed to suppression of gluconeogenesis in the setting of glycogen depletion in type 2 diabetes."

Solutions containing 20%, w/w mannitol-HPMC were freeze-dried and milled to obtain excipients of size fractions 125-355 μm and 355-710 μm to understand the impact of the formulation variables on the molecular, particle and bulk properties of the excipients. Results showed that the freeze-dried mannitol-HPMC excipients were mainly differentiated by 3 overarching properties, in the order of their contribution to the variation in the principal component analysis (PCA) model: (i) freeze-dried cake strength and bulk fill-related properties, (ii) compression behaviour-related properties, and (iii) flow-related properties. These properties were influenced by the HPMC viscosity grade, HPMC proportion and size fraction of excipient used. Freeze-dried excipients containing vLV or lower HPMC proportions had higher bulk densities, thus displaying better packing within the die. For larger excipients, densification by plastic deformation was likely preceded by fragmentation, thus accounting for the higher yield pressure values. The establishment of inter-variable relationships between the physical properties would be useful in further studies on the functional properties of tablets containing these co-freeze-dried mannitol-HPMC tableting excipients.",Searching for physiologically relevant in vitro dissolution techniques for orally inhaled drugs.,https://www.ncbi.nlm.nih.gov/pubmed/30529665,International journal of pharmaceutics,2019 04 04,"Inhalation is the preferred route for the treatment of lung diseases. More recently, also formulations for systemic treatment have been developed. For efficient development of inhalation products it is necessary to identify a link between particle parameters and in vivo performance. Such a relation exists for oral drugs where dissolution and permeation across Caco-2 monolayers are correlated to in vivo absorption. By contrast, the only in vitro parameter with established link to absorption for inhalation is particle size. In vitro dissolution could be another important parameter because low solubility determines bioavailability of inhaled drugs. The review highlights the importance of dissolution for drug availability in general and lists important differences in dissolution testing of oral and inhaled formulations. Dissolution testing protocols are summarized with focus on the composition of the various fluids, which are used to mimic particle dissolution in the deep lung. Finally, a role of in silico modelling in identification of physiologically relevant dissolution fluids and in in vitro in vivo correlation is suggested.",Optimization and in-vitro/in-vivo evaluation of doxorubicin-loaded chitosan-alginate nanoparticles using a melanoma mouse model.,https://www.ncbi.nlm.nih.gov/pubmed/30529664,International journal of pharmaceutics,2019 04 04,"The present study evaluates the potential of encapsulated doxorubicin to reduce both the viability of melanoma cells and the tumor growth in a mouse melanoma model. The prepared doxorubicin loaded chitosan/alginate nanoparticles possessed mean diameter around 300 nm and negative zeta-potential. Classical molecular dynamic simulations revealed that the high encapsulation efficiency (above 90%) was mainly due to electrostatic interaction between doxorubicin and sodium alginate, although dipole-dipole and hydrophobic interactions might also contribute. The in vitro dissolution tests showed slower doxorubicin release in slightly alkaline medium (pH = 7.4) and faster release in acid one (pH = 5.5), indicating that higher concentration of doxorubicin might reach the acidic tumor tissue. The free and the encapsulated doxorubicin decreased the viability of melanoma cell lines (B16-F10 and B16-OVA) in a similar degree. However, the cytotoxic effect of the encapsulated doxorubicin still occurred in the more resistant B16-F10 cells even after removing the extracellular drug. The experiments on a syngeneic melanoma mouse model revealed that free and encapsulated doxorubicin elicited the control of the tumor growth (dose of 3 mg/kg). Thus, the encapsulation of doxorubicin into chitosan/alginate nanoparticles could be considered advantageous because of the better intracellular accumulation and longer cytotoxic effect on the investigated melanoma cells."

The purpose of this study was to evaluate the effectiveness of transsphenoidal surgery (TSS) in restoring fertility in women with proloactinomas. A systematic search of the literature was conducted in accordance with PRISMA guidelines through 6/13/2017. PubMed, Embase, and Cochrane databases were utilized to select studies reporting on patients with pituitary prolactinomas removed via TSS. Outcomes extracted included pre- and post-operative rates of menses, lactation, and fertility. Pooled effect estimates were calculated using random-effects. After removal of duplicates, 900 articles remained, of which 14 were meta-analyzed. The mean difference between pre- and post-operative prolactin level was 186.9 (95% CI = 133.7, 240.1; I2 = 69.9%; P-heterogeneity<0.01; 7 studies). The pooled prevalence of pre-operative amenorrhea was 96% (95% CI = 92%, 98%; I2 = 45.8%; P-heterogeneity = 0.09; 11 studies) and significantly larger than post-operative amenorrhea of 40% (95% CI = 27%, 55%; P- I2 = 85%; heterogeneity<0.01; 11 studies); (P-interaction comparing the 2 groups <0.01).

To accomplish this task, foragers have a navigational toolbox, which relies on olfactory, idiothetic, visual and magnetic cues. Desert ants have been widely studied with regards to these abilities, including a heavy focus on learned visual cues, the most prominent being the terrestrial panorama. Nest cues are first acquired during pre-foraging learning walks. Once foragers leave the nest area, they also learn a number of cues to aid them when returning both back to the nest and to known food sites, using experience of previous trips to navigate on future trips. In this review, we describe the learning processes involved in accurate navigation in desert ants. We first focus on recent research on nest-site panorama learning during pre-foraging learning walks as well as panorama learning away from the nest during foraging. We also review learning cues beyond the terrestrial panorama, including tactile, magnetic, olfactory and vibrational cues. These studies provide a basis for future work to further explore how these navigators, despite their small brains, acquire, retain and use many cue sets present in their environments. We call for more experimental ethology focussed on learning processes, both by exploring run-by-run and step-by-step acquisition of information for navigation, as well as for other natural tasks in an animal's life.",Involvement of catecholaminergic and GABAAergic mediations in the anxiety-related behavior in long-term powdered diet-fed mice.,https://www.ncbi.nlm.nih.gov/pubmed/30529642,Neurochemistry international,2019 05 23,"Dietary habits are important factors which affect metabolic homeostasis and the development of emotion. We have previously shown that long-term powdered diet feeding in mice increases spontaneous locomotor activity and social interaction (SI) time. Moreover, that diet causes changes in the dopaminergic system, especially increased dopamine turnover and decreased dopamine D4 receptor signals in the frontal cortex. Although the increased SI time indicates low anxiety, the elevated plus maze (EPM) test shows anxiety-related behavior and impulsive behavior. In this study, we investigated whether the powdered diet feeding causes changes in anxiety-related behavior. Mice fed a powdered diet for 17 weeks from weaning were compared with mice fed a standard diet (control). The percentage (%) of open arm time and total number of arm entries were increased in powdered diet-fed mice in the EPM test. We also examined the effects of diazepam, benzodiazepine anti-anxiety drug, bicuculline, GABA-A receptor antagonist, methylphenidate, dopamine transporter (DAT) and noradrenaline transporter (NAT) inhibitor, atomoxetine, selective NAT inhibitor, GBR12909, selective DAT inhibitor, and PD168077, selective dopamine D4 receptor agonist, on the changes of the EPM in powdered diet-fed mice. Methylphenidate and atomoxetine are clinically used to treat attention deficit/hyperactivity disorder (ADHD) symptoms. The % of open arm time in powdered diet-fed mice was decreased by treatments of atomoxetine, methylphenidate and PD168077. Diazepam increased the % of open arm time in control diet-fed mice, but not in powdered diet-fed mice. The powdered diet feeding induced a decrease in GABA transaminase, GABA metabolic enzymes, in the frontal cortex. Moreover, the powdered diet feeding induced an increase in NAT expression, but not DAT expression, in the frontal cortex. These results suggest that the long-term powdered diet feeding may cause low anxiety or impulsivity, possibly via noradrenergic and/or dopaminergic, and GABAAergic mediations and increase the risk for onset of ADHD-like behaviors.",Genome analysis provides insights into crude oil degradation and biosurfactant production by extremely halotolerant Halomonas desertis G11 isolated from Chott El-Djerid salt-lake in Tunisian desert.,https://www.ncbi.nlm.nih.gov/pubmed/30529640,Genomics,2018 12 15,"Here, we report the genomic features and the bioremediation potential of Halomonas desertis G11, a new halophilic species which uses crude oil as a carbon and energy source and displays intrinsic resistance to salt stress conditions (optimum growth at 10% NaCl).

Annotation predicted 38 genes involved in osmotic stress including the biosynthesis of osmoprotectants glycine-betaine, ectoine and osmoregulated periplasmic glucans. Genome analysis revealed also the versatility of the strain for emulsifying crude oil and metabolizing hydrocarbons. The ability of G11 to degrade crude oil components and to secrete a glycolipid biosurfactant with satisfying properties was experimentally confirmed and validated.

It is shown here that this apparently paradoxical result is explained when the resultant differences in energy inputs to the whole multi-patch system are taken into account. We examine both Pearl-Verhulst and Original Verhulst logistic models and show that, when total input of energy or limiting resource, is constrained to be the same in the homogeneous and heterogeneous cases, the total population in the heterogeneous patches can never reach an asymptotic equilibrium that is greater than the sum of the carrying capacities over the homogeneous patches. We further show that, when the dynamics of the limiting resources are explicitly modeled, as in a chemostat model, the paradoxical result of the logistic models does not occur.

On the basis of anti-tumor properties of cordycepin, we examined the effects of cordycepin on sensitizing breast cancer cells toward radiotherapy. Cordycepin administration promoted G2/M arrest and apoptosis of MCF-7 and MDA-MB-231 cells resulting in restraining the proliferation of the cells in vitro and in vivo following irradiation. Mechanistic investigations showed that the breast cancer cells cultured with cordycepin harbored higher levels of intracellular reactive oxygen species (ROS) and incremental numbers of γ-H2AX foci after irradiation exposure. Importantly, cordycepin treatment down-regulated the expression levels of Nuclear factor erythroid 2-related factor (Nrf2) and a series of downstream genes, such as heme oxygenase-1 (HO-1), to enhance ROS in breast cancer cells exposed to irradiation. Together, our observations demonstrate that cordycepin treatment sensitizes breast carcinoma cells toward irradiation via Nrf2/HO-1/ROS axis. Thus, our findings provide novel insights into the function and the underlying mechanism of cordycepin in radiotherapy, and suggest that cordycepin might be employed as a radiosensitizer during radiotherapy toward breast cancer in a pre-clinical setting.",Adsorption of gaseous elemental mercury on soils: Influence of chemical and/or mineralogical characteristics.,https://www.ncbi.nlm.nih.gov/pubmed/30529625,Ecotoxicology and environmental safety,2019 03 20,"Gaseous elemental Hg is stable enough to be transported over long distances. Some of the most important sources of Hg in the atmosphere are artisanal gold mining activities and forest fires. Both of these sources are particularly prevalent in the Amazonia region. Information regarding the capacity of soils for retaining Hg transported by the atmosphere is very important for understanding the metal cycle in the environment. The aim of this work was to study gaseous elemental Hg adsorption in soils with different physical and chemical characteristics. For this purpose, soils from different regions in Brazil and Colombia influenced or possibly influenced by gold mining activities and forest fires were studied. Hg adsorption tests were conducted by exposing soil samples to a gaseous elemental Hg atmosphere for 144 h. The total Hg concentration (THg) and Hg oxidation states were monitored using a direct Hg analyzer. Sample characterization analyses were performed. THg values obtained before the adsorption tests were 43-413 and 144-590 µg kg-1 for grain size fractions below 2 and 0.063 mm, respectively. The predominant species found was Hg2+, with abundance levels from 68% to 99%. The results show a wide range of enhanced Hg retention capacities among the samples, ranging from 13 to 2236 times the initial concentration, and the speciation results demonstrate a decrease in the oxidized species range, from 21% to 78%. The statistical analysis indicated the importance of Mn-bearing minerals for the processes of adsorption/oxidation of gaseous elemental Hg in soils. These results contribute to the elucidation of the processes that occur with Hg at the soil/atmosphere interface and may help to explain the high concentrations of Hg found in Amazonian soils where no gold mining activities are practiced.","Iron mediated hematological, oxidative and histological alterations in freshwater fish Labeo rohita.",https://www.ncbi.nlm.nih.gov/pubmed/30529624,Ecotoxicology and environmental safety,2019 03 20,"Iron is an essential element for many physiological functions of several organisms but in excess it causes toxicity. High iron content in water bodies of mountainous states is considered as one of the major factor, responsible for low productivity in aquaculture systems. But, till date comprehensive reports on the adverse effect of iron overload in aquatic organisms, especially cultured fishes are scanty. Therefore, the present study was undertaken to investigate the adverse effects of iron overload in economically important aquaculture fish species Labeo rohita. Three sub-lethal test concentration of iron (ferrous) viz., 1/16th, 1/8th and 1/4th of LC50 (post 96 h) i.e. 8.25, 16.51 and 33.01 mg L-1, respectively, were used for in vivo exposure. Blood cells and tissue samples of the control & exposed specimens were sampled at intervals of 24, 48, 72 and 96 h to assess alterations in hematological, oxidative stress and histological parameters. Significant changes in erythrocyte and leukocyte counts, hemoglobin, lipid peroxidation, antioxidant enzyme activity (super oxide dismutase and catalase) and tissue iron accumulation were observed in the exposed fish. Significant increase in lipid peroxidation, coupled with significant reduction in free radicals scavengers like super oxide dismutase and catalase revealed a compromised anti-oxidative defense mechanism in the fishes exposed to iron overload. Histological examination of gills and liver showed severe tissue injury and histological alternations. Severity was found to increase in time and concentration dependent manner. Perl's staining revealed accumulation of excess iron in liver of the exposed fish. The observed patho-physiological changes in the present study provide the most comprehensive insight of iron overload stress in L. rohita.",Biocorona formation contributes to silver nanoparticle induced endoplasmic reticulum stress.,https://www.ncbi.nlm.nih.gov/pubmed/30529623,Ecotoxicology and environmental safety,2019 03 20,"Prior research has demonstrated cells exposed to silver nanoparticles (AgNPs) undergo endoplasmic reticulum (ER) stress leading to cellular apoptosis and toxicity, however, the fundamental mechanism underlying AgNP-induced ER stress is unknown. We hypothesize the biophysical interactions between AgNPs and adsorbed proteins lead to misfolded proteins to elicit an ER stress response. Our investigation examined rat aortic endothelial cells (RAEC) exposed to 20 or 100 nm AgNPs with or without a biocorona (BC) consisting of bovine serum albumin (BSA), high density lipoprotein (HDL) or fetal bovine serum (FBS) to form a complex BC. The presence of a BC consisting of BSA or FBS proteins significantly reduced uptake of 20 nm and 100 nm AgNPs in RAEC. Western blot analysis indicated robust activation of the IREα and PERK pathways in RAEC exposed to 20 nm despite the reduction in uptake by the presence of a BC. This was not observed for the 100 nm AgNPs. Hyperspectral darkfield microscopy qualitatively confirmed that the preformed BC was maintained following uptake by RAEC. Transmission electron microscopy demonstrated a size dependent effect on the sub-cellular localization of AgNPs. Overall, these results suggest that AgNP size, surface area and BC formation governs the induction of ER stress and alterations in intracellular trafficking.",Foliar spraying of melatonin confers cadmium tolerance in Nicotiana tabacum L.,https://www.ncbi.nlm.nih.gov/pubmed/30529622,Ecotoxicology and environmental safety,2019 03 20,"Melatonin is a multifunctional signaling molecule that regulates broad aspects of responses to environmental stresses in plants. Cadmium (Cd) is a persistent soil contaminant that is toxic to all living organisms. Recent reports have uncovered the protective role of melatonin in alleviating Cd phytotoxicity, but little is known about its regulatory mechanisms in plants. In this study, we found that foliar application of melatonin (in particular 100 μmol L-1) remarkably enhanced Cd tolerance of tobacco (Nicotiana tabacum L.) leaves, as evidenced by less Cd accumulation and alleviation of growth inhibition and photoinhibition, compared with nontreated Cd-stressed plants. The addition of melatonin also controlled oxidative damage of Cd on tobacco through direct scavenging and by enhancing the activities of antioxidative enzymes. Melatonin application promoted Cd sequestration in the cell wall and vacuoles based on the analysis of subcellular distribution of Cd in tobacco cells. Structural equation modeling (SEM) analysis revealed that melatonin-induced Cd tolerance in tobacco leaves was modulated by the expression of Cd-transport genes. Molecular evidence illustrated that modulation of IRT1, Nramp1, HMA2, HMA4, and HMA3 genes caused by melatonin could be responsible for weakening Cd uptake, Cd transportation to xylem, and intensifying Cd sequestration into the root vacuoles.",Oil sands process-affected water impairs the olfactory system of rainbow trout (Oncorhynchus mykiss).,https://www.ncbi.nlm.nih.gov/pubmed/30529621,Ecotoxicology and environmental safety,2019 03 20,"Oil sands process-affected water (OSPW), a byproduct of the extraction of bitumen in the surface mining of oil sands, is currently stored in massive on-site tailings ponds. Determining the potential effects of OSPW on aquatic ecosystems is of main concern to oil sands companies and legislators concerned about the reclamation of mining sites. In the present study, the interaction of OSPW with the chemosensory system of rainbow trout was studied. Using an electro-olfactography (EOG) technique, a 24 h inhibition curve was established and concentrations that inhibit the olfactory system by 20% and 80% (IC20 and IC80) were estimated at 3% and 22% OSPW, respectively. To study the interaction of exposure time and concentration along with the mechanism of the toxic effects, rainbow trout were exposed to 3% and 22% OSPW for 2, 24, and 96 h. An EOG investigation of olfactory sensitivity demonstrated a positive interaction between exposure time and concentration of OSPW concentration, because an increase in either or both elevated the inhibitory effect. To investigate whether or not structural damage of the olfactory epithelium could account for the observed inhibitory effects of OSPW on fish olfaction, the ultrastructure of the olfactory epithelium of exposed fish was investigated using scanning electron microscopy (SEM) and light microscopy (LM). The SEM micrographs showed no changes in the structure of the olfactory epithelium. The light micrographs revealed an increase in the number of mucous cells in 22% OSPW. The results of the present study demonstrated that exposure to OSPW impairs the olfactory system of rainbow trout and its effects increase gradually with increasing exposure time. The present study demonstrated that structural epithelial damage did not contribute to the inhibitory effects of OSPW on the olfactory system.",Soil pollution and toxicity in an area affected by emissions from a bauxite processing plant and a power plant in Gardanne (southern France).,https://www.ncbi.nlm.nih.gov/pubmed/30529620,Ecotoxicology and environmental safety,2019 03 20,"Soil pollution and toxicity have been investigated in the Gardanne area (southern France) at a range of sites around a recognized pollution source, a bauxite processing plant (BPP), and a power plant (PP). Soil samples were submitted to inorganic and organic analyses and tested for toxicity in two invertebrate models. Inorganic analysis was based on determining elemental concentrations by ICP-MS, encompassing a total of 26 elements including 13 rare earth elements (REEs), of the soil samples and their leachates after 24 or 48 h in seawater. Organic analyses were performed by measuring the sums of 16 polycyclic aromatic hydrocarbons (PAHs) and of total hydrocarbons (C-10 to C-40). Bioassays were carried out on the early life stages of three sea urchin species (Arbacia lixula, Paracentrotus lividus and Sphaerechinus granularis), and on a nematode (Caenorhabditis elegans). Sea urchin bioassays were evaluated by the effects of soil samples (0.1-0.5% dry wt/vol) on developing embryos and on sperm, and scored as: a) % developmental defects, b) inhibition of sperm fertilization success and offspring damage, and c) frequencies of mitotic aberrations. C. elegans 24 h-mortality assay showed significant toxicity associated with soil samples. The effects of soil samples showed heightened toxicity at two groups of sites, close to the BPP main entrance and around the PP, which was consistent with the highest concentrations found for metals and PAHs, respectively. Total hydrocarbon concentrations displayed high concentrations both close to BPP main entrance and to the PP. Further studies of the health effects of such materials in Gardanne are warranted.","Insight into occurrence, profile and spatial distribution of organochlorine pesticides in soils of solid waste dumping sites of Pakistan: Influence of soil properties and implications for environmental fate.",https://www.ncbi.nlm.nih.gov/pubmed/30529619,Ecotoxicology and environmental safety,2019 03 20,"Waste dumping sites are considered as significant disposal pathway for waste contaminants including pesticides. In the present study OCPs were analyzed in soils of waste dumping sites of Pakistan. The mean concentrations of OCPs were in the order: ∑DDTs>∑HCHs>∑Endosulfan>∑HCB>Heptachlor. Order of overall ∑OCPs contamination with respect to location was Lahore>Sukkur>Karachi>Kamoki>Faisalabad>Hyderabad>Losar>Gujrat>Peshawar. Distribution of OCPs in solid waste dumping site was mainly influenced by textural classes, input history and pollution source. Soil texture was the dominant factor for retention of OCPs, whereas TOC and black carbon has not significantly impacted the concentrations of OCPs. Diagnostic ratios indicated the historical input, anaerobic degradation pathway and use of technical mixtures of DDTs in majority of waste dumping sites whereas for HCHs recent as well as past usage of technical mixture was prevalent in most of the areas. Regression analysis revealed a weak positive correlation of OCPs with socioeconomic indices (HDI, Population, waste generation) which is linked with history of use of these contaminants in the respective areas. Forecasted waste generation quantity for the year 2026 showed that waste generation amount will get doubled by the year 2026 suggesting the need properly designed waste management system.",MAPK/AP-1 pathway activation mediates AT1R upregulation and vascular endothelial cells dysfunction under PM2.5 exposure.,https://www.ncbi.nlm.nih.gov/pubmed/30529618,Ecotoxicology and environmental safety,2019 03 20,"Acute and chronic exposure to particulate matter (PM) 2.5 is associated with adverse health effect upon the cardiovascular (CV) system. However, the molecular mechanism by which PM2.5 evokes CV injuries has not been fully clarified. In our recent report, we demonstrate that exposure to PM2.5 leads to elevation of circulating angiotensin II (ANGII) levels and local expressions of angiotensinogen (AGT, the precursor of ANGII), angiotensin-converting enzyme (ACE) and ANGII type 1 receptor (AT1R) in the vascular endothelial cells, which subsequently instigates the oxidative stress and proinflammatory response in the vascular endothelium. In the present study, we disclosed that PM2.5 exposure induced the activation of the transcriptional factor AP-1 and its components, c-Jun and ATF2, in the human vascular endothelial cells. Although the DNA-binding sites for AP-1 were identified within the promoter regions of AGT, ACE and AT1R genes, RT-PCR and immunoblot assays indicated that AP-1 transactivation was only involved in AT1R upregulation, but did not affect the induction of AGT and ACE expression under the same conditions. Furthermore, ERKs and p38K functioned as the upstream protein kinases involving in AP-1 transactivation and AT1R upregulation under PM2.5 stimulation. In addition, the oxidative stress and proinflammatory responses in the PM2.5-treated vascular endothelial cells were significantly reduced when MAPKs and AP-1 activation were inhibited. Therefore, we conclude that PM2.5 exposure induces MAPK/AP-1 cascade activation, which contributes to AT1R upregulation and vascular endothelial dysfunction. Identifying novel therapeutic targets to alleviate AP-1 transactivation and restore AT1R expression may be helpful for the management of PM2.5-induced CV burden.","Microplastic abundance, distribution and composition in water, sediments, and wild fish from Poyang Lake, China.",https://www.ncbi.nlm.nih.gov/pubmed/30529617,Ecotoxicology and environmental safety,2019 03 20,"Microplastic pollution in global aquatic environments has aroused increasing concern in recent years. In this study, the occurrence of microplastics in multiple environmental compartments was investigated in Poyang Lake, the largest freshwater lake of China. The abundance of microplastics was respectively 5-34 items/L for surface waters, 54-506 items/kg for sediments, and 0-18 items per individual for wild crucians (Carassius auratus). The distribution of microplastics in Poyang Lake varied heterogeneously in space, with the highest abundance being observed in the middle region of the lake for surface waters and in the northern region for sediments. Anthropogenic and topographic factors were speculated to be the major factors affecting the abundance and distribution of microplastics. The majority of the detected microplastics were found with a size of < 0.5 mm, with fibrous and coloured being the predominant characteristics. Polypropylene (PP) and polyethylene (PE) were the major polymer types of the selected plastic particles, indicating that domestic sewage and fishing activities might be the main sources of microplastics in the lake. No significant correlation was observed between microplastic abundance in surface water and sediment samples. Our results demonstrated the wide occurrence of microplastics in water, sediment and biota of the Poyang Lake, which may assist in extending our knowledge regarding microplastics pollution in inland freshwater systems."

While delayed motor neuron apoptosis is implicated in the pathogenesis, no effective treatment or preventive measures is available for delayed paraplegia. Hydrogen sulfide exerts anti-apoptotic effects. Here, we examined effects of hydrogen sulfide breathing on the recovery from transient spinal cord ischemia. Breathing hydrogen sulfide starting 23 h after reperfusion for 5 h prevented delayed paraplegia after 5 min of spinal cord ischemia. Beneficial effects of hydrogen sulfide were mediated by upregulation of anti-apoptotic Bcl-XL and abolished by nitric oxide synthase 2 deficiency. S-nitrosylation of NFkB p65 subunit, which is induced by nitric oxide derived from nitric oxide synthase 2, facilitated subsequent sulfide-induced persulfidation of p65 and transcription of anti-apoptotic genes. These results uncover the molecular mechanism of the anti-apoptotic effects of sulfide based on the interaction between nitric oxide and sulfide. Exploitation of the anti-apoptotic effects of delayed hydrogen sulfide breathing may provide a new therapeutic approach for delayed paraplegia.",Biomarkers for tau pathology.,https://www.ncbi.nlm.nih.gov/pubmed/30529601,Molecular and cellular neurosciences,2019 06 15,"The aggregation of fibrils of hyperphosphorylated and C-terminally truncated microtubule-associated tau protein characterizes 80% of all dementia disorders, the most common neurodegenerative disorders. These so-called tauopathies are hitherto not curable and their diagnosis, especially at early disease stages, has traditionally proven difficult. A keystone in the diagnosis of tauopathies was the development of methods to assess levels of tau protein in vivo in cerebrospinal fluid, which has significantly improved our knowledge about these conditions. Tau proteins have also been measured in blood, but the importance of tau-related changes in blood is still unclear. The recent addition of positron emission tomography ligands to visualize, map and quantify tau pathology has further contributed with information about the temporal and spatial characteristics of tau accumulation in the living brain. Together, the measurement of tau with fluid biomarkers and positron emission tomography constitutes the basis for a highly active field of research. This review describes the current state of biomarkers for tau biomarkers derived from neuroimaging and from the analysis of bodily fluids and their roles in the detection, diagnosis and prognosis of tau-associated neurodegenerative disorders, as well as their associations with neuropathological findings, and aims to provide a perspective on how these biomarkers might be employed prospectively in research and clinical settings.",Global dynamics of a discrete age-structured SIR epidemic model with applications to measles vaccination strategies.,https://www.ncbi.nlm.nih.gov/pubmed/30529600,Mathematical biosciences,2019 06 02,"We investigate an SIR epidemic model with discrete age groups to understand the transmission dynamics of an infectious disease in a host population with an age structure.

If R0>1,E0 is unstable, the model is uniformly persistent, and an endemic equilibrium exists. The global stability of the endemic equilibrium when R0>1 is established under a sufficient condition.

It is well known that time delay is inevitable in gene regulatory networks due to transcription and translation not being physically co-located. In this paper, we systematically consider the effect of time delay on the dynamical behavior of the three-node circuit with three time delays. Based on linear stability analysis and bifurcation theory, sufficient conditions for stability of equilibria and oscillatory behaviors via Hopf bifurcation are derived when choosing positive and negative feedback strengths as well as time delays τ1, τ2, τ3 as the bifurcation parameters, respectively. Moreover, stability and direction of the Hopf bifurcation of time delay are studied by using the normal form method and the center manifold theorem. Finally, several examples are performed to illustrate some analytical results we obtained.","Biomarkers in Lung Cancer Screening: Achievements, Promises, and Challenges.",https://www.ncbi.nlm.nih.gov/pubmed/30529598,Journal of thoracic oncology : official publication of the International Association for the Study of Lung Cancer,2019 05 03,"The present review is an update of the research and development efforts regarding the use of molecular biomarkers in the lung cancer screening setting.

The Masc protein possesses two CCCH-type zinc finger domains (ZFs), a nuclear localization signal, and an 11-amino-acid region that is highly conserved among lepidopteran insects. Using a cell-based assay system, we revealed that two cysteine residues localized in the conserved region, but not ZFs, are required for masculinization. In addition, nuclear localization of the Masc protein is not associated with masculinizing activity. Because dosage compensation is considered to occur in the nucleus, we inferred that the two ZFs play a role in the establishment of dosage compensation. To investigate this hypothesis at the organism level, we utilized the CRISPR/Cas9 system and established three B. mori strains whose Masc is partially deleted at different regions. The strain lacking the 210 C-terminal amino acids of the Masc protein showed male-specific embryonic lethality due to its low abundance and/or instability. The male embryos of this strain expressed the female-type splice variants of B. mori doublesex and did not express the male-type mRNA of B. mori IGF-II mRNA-binding protein. Furthermore, mRNA levels of Z-linked genes were abnormally enhanced only in male embryos. In contrast, the strain lacking both ZFs grew normally and did not show any defective phenotypes including sexual differentiation and the expression of Z-linked genes, demonstrating that the two CCCH-type ZFs, which are conserved in lepidopteran Masc homologs, are dispensable for masculinization and dosage compensation.",Identification of novel ejaculate proteins in a seed beetle and division of labour across male accessory reproductive glands.,https://www.ncbi.nlm.nih.gov/pubmed/30529580,Insect biochemistry and molecular biology,2019 02 08,"The male ejaculate contains a multitude of seminal fluid proteins (SFPs), many of which are key reproductive molecules, as well as sperm. However, the identification of SFPs is notoriously difficult and a detailed understanding of this complex phenotype has only been achieved in a few model species. We employed a recently developed proteomic method involving whole-organism stable isotope labelling coupled with proteomic and transcriptomic analyses to characterize ejaculate proteins in the seed beetle Callosobruchus maculatus. We identified 317 proteins that were transferred to females at mating, and a great majority of these showed signals of secretion and were highly male-biased in expression in the abdomen. These male-derived proteins were enriched with proteins involved in general metabolic and catabolic processes but also with proteolytic enzymes and proteins involved in protection against oxidative stress. Thirty-seven proteins showed significant homology with SFPs previously identified in other insects. However, no less than 92 C. maculatus ejaculate proteins were entirely novel, receiving no significant blast hits and lacking homologs in extant data bases, consistent with a rapid and divergent evolution of SFPs. We used 3D micro-tomography in conjunction with proteomic methods to identify 5 distinct pairs of male accessory reproductive glands and to show that certain ejaculate proteins were only recovered in certain male glands. Finally, we provide a tentative list of 231 candidate female-derived reproductive proteins, some of which are likely important in ejaculate processing and/or sperm storage.","The Role of Government in Precision Medicine, Precision Public Health and the Intersection With Healthy Living.",https://www.ncbi.nlm.nih.gov/pubmed/30529579,Progress in cardiovascular diseases,2019 03 14,"This paper focuses on the significant role of government in promoting precision medicine and public health and the potential intersection with healthy living (HL) and population health.

These interactions between longitudinal behaviors, epigenetics, and expression of the human genome have the potential to transform health and well-being, even within a single generation. Precision medicine can elucidate these longitudinal interactions with a granularity that has not been previously possible across the exposome. Understanding the interactions between genes, epigenetics, proteins, metabolites, and the exposome may inform more evidence-based, effective policy, system, and environmental change to optimize individual and population health. Government has an important role in helping to fund primary research in precision medicine and precision public health, as well as creating and enforcing standards related to food systems, air quality, and access to health care, defining and optimizing measures of health care quality and safety, and ensuring data privacy standards and protections, interoperability, and integration with surveillance systems.

Empirical evidence reveals that little is known about the dynamic aspects of human knowledge. Precise dissection of the expansion of scientific knowledge could help us to better understand the evolutionary dynamics of science. In this paper, we analyzed the dynamic properties and growth principles of the MEDLINE bibliographic database using network analysis methodology. The basic assumption of this work is that the scientific evolution of the life sciences can be represented as a list of co-occurrences of MeSH descriptors that are linked to MEDLINE citations. The MEDLINE database was summarized as a complex system, consisting of nodes and edges, where the nodes refer to knowledge concepts and the edges symbolize corresponding relations. We performed an extensive statistical evaluation based on more than 25 million citations in the MEDLINE database, from 1966 until 2014. We based our analysis on node and community level in order to track temporal evolution in the network. The degree distribution of the network follows a stretched exponential distribution which prevents the creation of large hubs. Results showed that the appearance of new MeSH terms does not also imply new connections. The majority of new connections among nodes results from old MeSH descriptors. We suggest a wiring mechanism based on the theory of structural holes, according to which a novel scientific discovery is established when a connection is built among two or more previously disconnected parts of scientific knowledge. Overall, we extracted 142 different evolving communities. It is evident that new communities are constantly born, live for some time, and then die.

Finite element analysis (FEA) has been widely applied to study the stent fatigue behaviours, but physiological deformation and atherosclerotic plaque were not considered simultaneously in previous studies. In this work, to show the necessity and feasibility of considering both factors in evaluation of the stent fatigue behaviours, a comprehensive FEA framework considering both factors is established, and an easy loading method for the complex boundary condition is proposed. Four comparative simulations are successfully conducted, and the stent fatigue behaviours are analysed based on the distributions and maximum values of the self-defined mean and alternating strains. Results show that both the physiological deformation and atherosclerotic plaque significantly contribute to the stent fatigue life. The case with the complex boundary condition and atherosclerotic plaque is the most critical of the four cases, and the minimum safety factor is 0.62. In conclusion, it is necessary to consider both physiological deformation and atherosclerotic plaque in the evaluation of stent fatigue behaviours, and ignoring any of them would lead to overestimation of the stent fatigue life. The work in this paper offers a solid foundation for accurate evaluation of the stent fatigue lifetime in patient-specific surgery plans via FEA."

Currently, four major lineages: lineage 1 (NADC30-like), 3 (QYYZ-like), 5.1 (VR2332-like) and 8.7 (JXA1-like) of type 2 PRRSV (North American type) have been circulating in China based on classification system, which have caused concern about the potential of virus recombination. In the present study, a novel variant of PRRSV strain named FJLIUY-2017 was isolated from abortion rate (25%) in pregnant gilts in Fujian Province in China in 2017. To further our knowledge about the novel virus strain, we characterized the complete genome of FJLIUY-2017. Comparison to PRRS sequences in GenBank confirmed the absence of close relatives (<92%), but indicated FJLIUY-2017 belonged to NADC30-like PRRSV. The full length of FJLIUY-2017 was determined to be 15017 nucleotides (nt), excluding the poly(A) tail, shared 86.2-86.6% identity with JXA1-like strains (JXA1, TJ and FJYR), 88.9-90.6% with NADC30-like PRRSVs (NADC30, FJZ03 and CHsx1401), 86.4-86.5% with VR2332-like (VR2332, RespPRRS MLV and BJ-4) and only 60.8% with LV (European type). Recombination analyses revealed genomic breakpoints in structural (ORF3, ORF4 and ORF7) and nonstructural (Nsp1, Nsp2, Nsp6, Nsp9, Nsp11 and Nsp12) regions of the genomes with evidence for recombination events between lineages 1, 3, 5.1 and 8.7. Taken altogether, the results of our study provide further confirmation that PRRSV is prone to undergo recombination events. Thus, it is critical to monitor PRRSV evolution in China and establish an effective strategy for the control of PRRS.",Antioxidant activities of phosphorylated pumpkin polysaccharide.,https://www.ncbi.nlm.nih.gov/pubmed/30529557,International journal of biological macromolecules,2019 05 21,"Pumpkin polysaccharide was extracted with hot water, and it was chemically modified with phosphorus oxychloride-pyridine to obtain phosphorylated pumpkin polysaccharides (PP1, PP2) with different degrees of substitution.

The CS is grafted into the carbonaceous materials like graphene oxide, multi-walled carbon nanotubes etc. to provide the large surface area, high porosity and a large number of amine group which facilitates the adsorption of CO2 gas. CS and carbonaceous materials undergo crosslinking by using cross-linker reagents, and freeze-drying technique to yield CS based aerogels with ordered porous structures. Crosslinking between CS and carbonaceous materials was confirmed by FT-IR. Physical properties of the CS-based aerogels were studied using SEM, TGA, XRD, BET isotherm analysis. The adsorption capacity of CO2 gas by CS grafted graphene oxide aerogels is around 0.257 mmol g-1 at 1 bar, that is significantly higher in comparison to the adsorption capacity of pure CS. We believe that this study helps to reduce the cost of adsorbents due to the large availability of marine waste (CS) and thus aims to reduce the anthropogenic CO2 gas at low cost, favourable temperature and pressure as compared to previously reported.",Antibacterial efficacy of a fucoidan fraction (Fu-F2) extracted from Sargassum polycystum.,https://www.ncbi.nlm.nih.gov/pubmed/30529554,International journal of biological macromolecules,2019 05 16,"In this study therapeutic potential of fucoidan fraction-2 (Fu-F2) isolated from Sargassum polycystum was evaluated for the development of antibacterial agent against the human and animal pathogenic bacteria by in vitro and in vivo analysis. The Fu-F2 contained 51.12 ± 0.86% of total sugar and 20.41 ± 0.91% of sulfate. The structural characterization of Fu-F2 was performed by HPLC, FTIR and NMR analysis and reported in our earlier study. The in vitro antibacterial assays such as MIC, MBC, killing kinetics, disk diffusion, protein leakage, ROS and confocal laser scanning microscopy demonstrate that Fu-F2 possesses the highest antibacterial activity against the tested pathogens. Among the tested pathogens, the highest antibacterial activity (21 ± 1.0 mm) was recorded at the concentration of 50 μg/ml against Pseudomonas aeruginosa and the lowest activity (16 ± 0.53 mm) was registered against Staphylococcus aureus. In the in vivo analysis, the pre-treatment group with Fu-F2 at the concentration of 15 mg/0.1 kg through feed exhibited the highest survival (83.4%) and antioxidant activities (p < 0.05) than the fish infected with pathogen.

Survival of this Gram-positive bacterium in rapidly-growing pathogens in hostile environments is strongly dependent on the existence of a robust DNA repair system to prevent DNA mutations and contribute to bacterial colonization and virulence. The adenine/guanine-specific DNA glycosylase (MutY) is evolutionarily conserved and has been well characterized due to its central role in the prevention of mutagenesis and DNA repair. The aim of this study was the characterization of the target protein interaction with free adenine, suramin, and heparin, as well as the binding competition characterization between the molecules. The dissociation constant for free adenine interaction with Corynebacterium pseudotuberculosis MutY (Cp-MutY) was determined, 86 ± 2.5 μM. NMR competition experiments demonstrated, that the polyanions heparin and suramin compete with adenine for the protein active site. The determined dissociation constant for the heparin/Cp-MutY interaction was 5.9 ± 1.0 μM and for suramin was 16 ± 1.5 μM. Docking of both polyanions with Cp-MutY revealed a possible mode of interaction and indicates that these molecules can interfere with the protein interaction with damaged DNA or prevent the binding of the adenine base in the enzyme active site.",Inhibitory effect of epigallocatechin-3-O-gallate on α-glucosidase and its hypoglycemic effect via targeting PI3K/AKT signaling pathway in L6 skeletal muscle cells.,https://www.ncbi.nlm.nih.gov/pubmed/30529552,International journal of biological macromolecules,2019 05 16,"Epigallocatechin-3-O-gallate (EGCG), a tea polyphenol is renowned for its anti-diabetic properties, however limited studies elucidate its hypoglycemic mechanism from multi-perspectives. In the present study, the interaction between EGCG and α-glucosidase was investigated through kinetics analysis, fluorescence spectra, Fourier transform infrared (FT-IR) spectra and molecular docking studies. Additionally, the effect of EGCG on glucose uptake and its related signaling pathway in L6 muscle cells were also investigated. The results showed that the α-glucosidase inhibitory activity of EGCG (IC50 = 19.5 ± 0.3 μM) was higher than that acarbose (IC50 = 278.7 ± 1.1 μM). EGCG inhibited α-glucosidase in a reversible and non-competitive manner. EGCG quenched the fluorescence of α-glucosidase due to the complex formation between EGCG and α-glucosidase, where the hydrogen bonds played a critical role. Microenvironment and the secondary structure of α-glucosidase were highly influenced by EGCG. Molecular docking results indicated that the binding sites on α-glucosidase for EGCG were close to the active site pocket of the enzyme. EGCG was also found to enhance the glucose uptake and promote GLUT4 translocation to plasma membrane via PI3K/AKT signaling pathway in L6 skeletal muscle cells. Overall, these results revealed the possible hypoglycemic mechanism of EGCG.",Complete mitochondrial genome of Japalura flaviceps: Deep insights into the phylogeny and gene rearrangements of Agamidae species.,https://www.ncbi.nlm.nih.gov/pubmed/30529551,International journal of biological macromolecules,2019 05 16,"Japalura flaviceps is a subarboreal species, which is endemically distributed in China.

Our phylogenetic result using 15 genes divided all Agamidae lizards into six subfamilies and showed (((((Agaminae, Draconinae), Amphibolurinae), Hydrosaurinae), Uromastycinae), Leiolepinae), which was different from the previous studies. J. flaviceps had a closer relationship to Pseudocalotes species than Acanthosaura species, and they formed a well-supported lineage of Draconinae subfamily. There were nine mitochondrial gene rearrangement types among the 27 Agamidae species, and six of them were found in the Agaminae group. The trnP gene of J. flaviceps mitogenome was encoded on the heavy strand instead of its typical light strand position, providing an example of gene inversion in vertebrate mitogenomes. J. flaviceps shared the same gene arrangement type (inverted trnP gene) with other Draconinae species, strongly implying a single occurrence of the trnP inversion in the ancestral draconine lineage.

X-ray photoelectron spectroscopy analysis had profound ~2.91% increment in overall oxygen group and ~1% increment was noticed with a specific carboxyl content owing to CO and OCO bonding. The interaction between split RNA aptamer and HIV-1 Tat protein was quantified by electrical measurements with the current signal (Ids) over a gate voltage (Vgs). Initially, 34.4 mV gate voltage shift was observed by the immobilization of aptamer on MWCNT. With aptamer and HIV-1 Tat interaction, the current flow was decreased with the concomitant gate voltage shift of 23.5 mV. The attainment of sensitivity with split aptamer and HIV-1 Tat interaction on the fabricated device was 600 pM. To ensure the genuine interaction of aptamer with HIV-1 Tat, other HIV-1 proteins, Nef and p24 were interacted with aptamer and they displayed the negligible interferences with gate voltage shift of 3.5 mV and 5.7 mV, which shows 4 and 2.5 folds lesser than HIV-1 Tat interaction, respectively.",Global analysis of RNA metabolism using bio-orthogonal labeling coupled with next-generation RNA sequencing.,https://www.ncbi.nlm.nih.gov/pubmed/30529548,"Methods (San Diego, Calif.)",2019 05 26,"Many open questions in RNA biology relate to the kinetics of gene expression and the impact of RNA binding regulatory factors on processing or decay rates of particular transcripts. Steady state measurements of RNA abundance obtained from RNA-seq approaches are not able to separate the effects of transcription from those of RNA decay in the overall abundance of any given transcript, instead only giving information on the (presumed steady-state) abundances of transcripts. Through the combination of metabolic labeling and high-throughput sequencing, several groups have been able to measure both transcription rates and decay rates of the entire transcriptome of an organism in a single experiment. This review focuses on the methodology used to specifically measure RNA decay at a global level.

The tooth had a history of root canal therapy by a general dentist. Clinically the tooth was sensitive to palpation/percussion. Radiographic evaluation showed concurrent root/furcal perforations associated with radiolucent lesions, an inadequate root canal treatment and massive gutta-percha overextensions via perforation sites. The tooth was atraumatically extracted. After mesial root amputation and root-end/furcal preparations, the cavities were filled with calcium-enriched mixture cement.

Proteins from the same family are found to cluster together, leading to the principle that the convex hull surrounding protein points from the same family do not intersect with the convex hulls of other protein families. This principle was verified computationally for all available and reliable protein kinases and human proteins. In addition, we generated 2,328,761 figures to show that the convex hulls of different families were disjoint from each other.

By combining a certain protein called transcription factor, the promoter provides the starting point for regulated gene transcription, and hence plays a vitally important role in gene transcriptional regulation. With explosive growth of DNA sequences in the post-genomic age, it has become an urgent challenge to develop computational method for effectively identifying promoters because the information thus obtained is very useful for both basic research and drug development. Although some prediction methods were developed in this regard, most of them were limited at merely identifying whether a query DNA sequence being of a promoter or not. However, based on their strength-distinct levels for transcriptional activation and expression, promoter should be divided into two categories: strong and weak types. Here a new two-layer predictor, called ""iPSW(2L)-PseKNC"", was developed by fusing the physicochemical properties of nucleotides and their nucleotide density into PseKNC (pseudo K-tuple nucleotide composition). Its 1st-layer serves to predict whether a query DNA sequence sample is of promoter or not, while its 2nd-layer is able to predict the strength of promoters. It has been observed through rigorous cross-validations that the 1st-layer sub-predictor is remarkably superior to the existing state-of-the-art predictors in identifying the promoters and non-promoters, and that the 2nd-layer sub-predictor can do what is beyond the reach of the existing predictors. Moreover, the web-server for iPSW(2L)-PseKNC has been established at http://www.jci-bioinfo.cn/iPSW(2L)-PseKNC, by which the majority of experimental scientists can easily get the results they need.",Exploring the effect of library preparation on RNA sequencing experiments.,https://www.ncbi.nlm.nih.gov/pubmed/30529531,Genomics,2019 06 10,"RNA sequencing (RNA-seq) has become the widely preferred choice for surveying the genome-wide transcriptome complexity in many organisms.

Further, studies on the molecular interaction of Morin with global regulatory protein (SarA) of Staphylococcus aureus, suggested the effective role of Morin as an anti-quorum sensing agent and interpolating the further studies to suit it as drug candidate against the pathogenic bacteria.",The sex differences of the behavior response to early Life immune stimulation: Microglia and astrocytes involvement.,https://www.ncbi.nlm.nih.gov/pubmed/30529512,Physiology & behavior,2018 12 30,"It is well known that inflammatory challenge during the prenatal period results in permanent changes in glial cells and behavior in adulthood. However, it is unknown whether inflammatory challenge during the infantile period may have permanent sexually-dimorphic effects on microglia and astrocytes in vivo, which in turn may be associated with sex differences in adult behavior. In this study, we have evaluated whether postnatal injection of lipopolysaccharide (LPS; 250μg/kg, i.p. on postnatal day 14) induces depressive and less anxiety-like behaviors, glial cell activation, pro-inflammatory cytokine (TNF-alpha) secretion and sexually dimorphic responses in adulthood. Postnatal day 14 (P14) male and female Wistar rats received an intraperitoneal (ip) injection of LPS or PBS. Three months later, animals were tested in the Open Field (OF), the Elevated Plus Maze (EPM) and the Forced Swimming Test (FST) to assess the level of anxiety and depression-like behavior. Hippocampal proinflammatory cytokine TNF-alpha concentration and the number of astrocytes and microglia were estimated in the dentate gyrus, CA1, and CA3 in two regions of the hippocampus (ventral and dorsal). Our results showed that the administration of LPS resulted in less anxiety and depression-like behavior in males but not in females. However, the LPS-administration increased the number of microglia in the dorsal and ventral hippocampus areas in females more than male, while no significant differences in TNFα level had been detected between the LPS-rats treated and their controls. Interestingly, LPS resulted in an increase in the number of astrocytes in both areas of the hippocampus in a female. While in a male, our results showed a decrease in astrocytes number in the dorsal hippocampus, but no significant differences observed in ventral hippocampus. These findings indicate that an immune challenge in infantile rats induces a ventral and dorsal hippocampus damage in female more than in male, without affecting significantly the affective behavior changes in the female. The results also showed that small changes in the male hippocampus can affect the behavior and induce a depression-like behavior.","In-season training load quantification of one-, two- and three-game week schedules in a top European professional soccer team.",https://www.ncbi.nlm.nih.gov/pubmed/30529511,Physiology & behavior,2019 02 17,"Top European soccer teams that play in UEFA competitions often participate in one, two- or three-games per week. Therefore, it is necessary to ensure optimal match-day performance and full recovery. The aim of this study was to quantify internal and external training load (TL) within five microcycles: M1 and M2 - one-game weeks; M3 and M4 - two-game weeks; M5 - three-game week). Thirteen elite soccer players participated in this study. A global positioning system (GPS) was used to measure the total distance covered and distances of different exercise training zones (1-5), the session ratings of perceived exertion (s-RPE) scores and the amount of creatine kinase (CK) created during daily training sessions for the 2015-2016 in-season period. The data were analysed with respect to the number of days prior to a given match. The main results indicate that there was a significant difference in training intensity for zone 1 between M2 and M4 (4010.2 ± 103.5 and 4507.6 ± 133.0 m, respectively); a significant difference in training intensity for zone 3 between M1 and M5 (686.1 ± 42.8 and 801.2 ± 61.2 m, respectively); a significant difference in the duration of the training sessions and matches between M2 and M5 (69.2 ± 2.1 and 79.6 ± 2.3) and M3 and M5 (69.7 ± 1.0 and 79.6 ± 2.3); and finally, there was a significant difference in CK between M3 and M2 (325.5 ± 155.0 and 194.4 ± 48.9). Moreover, there was a significant decrease in TL in the last day prior to a match, for all microcycles and all variables. There was no significant difference with respect to s-RPE. This study provides the first report of daily external and internal TLs and weekly accumulated load (training sessions and match demands) during one, two, and three-game week schedules in a group of elite soccer players. Expected significant differences are found in daily and accumulated loads for within- and between-game schedules. A similar pattern is exhibited for one- and two-game week microcycles regarding the day before the match, which exhibits a decrease in all variables. Despite the different number of games played per week, TL remain similar between microcycles for zone 2 and 5, plus s-RPE.",Effects of Moringa oleifera Lam Extract (MOLE) in the heat shock protein 70 expression and germ cell apoptosis on experimentally induced cryptorchid testes of rats.,https://www.ncbi.nlm.nih.gov/pubmed/30529510,Gene,2019 02 15,"Moringa oleifera (Moringaceae) is a plant known for having high antioxidant potency, anticancer, hepatoprotective, cardioprotective etc. and many more activities. Besides these, Moringaceae has the potential for attenuating the male sexual dysfunction. Reactive oxygen species/ROS were increased in cryptorchidism and therefore cause infertility by damaging sperm DNA and germ cell apoptosis. There was an increase in heat shock proteins (HSP) in cells, which is affected by heat shock. In the present study, the antioxidant effects of two different doses of M. oleifera Lam Extract (MOLE) on experimentally induced cryptorchid testes of rats was investigated. Forty two male rats (16 days old) were divided into four groups: a normal control group, a cryptorchidism-induced control group and two cryptorchidism-induced groups treated orally with either 400 or 800 mg/kg MOLE for 2 weeks. Our study showed that there were ruptures from interstitial spaces, separation of the germ cells from basal membrane, falling of the germ cells into the lumen, perivascular fibrosis, oedema, increased level of HSP70, apoptosis, malondialdehyde (MDA) and decrease in the level of superoxide dismutase (SOD) after the cryptorchidism. We found that pathological damages, oxidative stress, expression of the HSP70 and germ cell apoptosis were decreased in treated groups with MOLE. In brief, we can say that aqueous extract of M. oleifera reduces the oxidative stress in a unilateral cryptorchidism induced rats, and it might attenuate histopathological damages, HSP expression and germ cell apoptosis.",Changes in functional connectivity dynamics with aging: A dynamical phase synchronization approach.,https://www.ncbi.nlm.nih.gov/pubmed/30529509,NeuroImage,2019 06 14,"The dynamics of the human brain network has attracted broad attention, in recognition of the concept that functional connectivity is not static, but changes its pattern over time, even in the resting state. We hypothesized that analysis of continuously captured time-varying instantaneous phase synchronization between signals from different brain regions might add another dimension to already identified network dynamics. To validate this hypothesis as an aid to elucidating the physiological mechanisms of aging, we examined time-series of instantaneous phase synchronization events in resting-state EEG activity across the brain, in healthy younger and healthy older subjects. We then characterized the temporal dynamics of phase synchronization using multiscale entropy, which quantifies the complexity of brain signal dynamics over multiple time scales. The results of surrogate analyses confirmed that the temporal dynamics of phase synchronization arise from deterministic processes in the neural network system. Group comparison showed region-specific enhanced complexity of temporal dynamics of phase synchronization in older subjects in alpha band predominantly in frontal brain regions, which was not identified by a comparative phase synchronization approach such as phase lag index. Enhanced complexity of temporal dynamics of functional connectivity in older subjects might reflect a general network alteration theory in aging. This is a first report describing the importance of capturing the dynamics of instantaneous phase synchronization and characterizing its temporal organization. Applying this method to neurophysiologic data may provide a novel understanding of dynamical neural network processes in both healthy and pathological conditions.","Nutrient biomarker patterns, cognitive function, and fMRI measures of network efficiency in the aging brain.",https://www.ncbi.nlm.nih.gov/pubmed/30529508,NeuroImage,2019 06 14,"A central aim of research in the psychological and brain sciences is to establish therapeutic interventions to promote healthy brain aging. Accumulating evidence indicates that diet and the many bioactive substances present in food are reasonable interventions to examine for dementia prevention. However, interdisciplinary research that applies methods from nutritional epidemiology and network neuroscience to investigate the role of nutrition in shaping functional brain network efficiency remains to be conducted. The present study therefore sought to combine methods across disciplines, applying nutrient biomarker pattern (NBP) analysis to capture the effects of plasma nutrients in combination and to examine their collective influence on measures of functional brain network efficiency (small-world propensity). We examined the contribution of NBPs to multiple indices of cognition and brain health in non-demented elders (n = 116), investigating performance on measures of general intelligence, executive function, and memory, and resting-state fMRI measures of brain network efficiency within seven intrinsic connectivity networks. Statistical moderation investigated whether NBPs influenced network efficiency and cognitive outcomes. The results revealed five NBPs that were associated with enhanced cognitive performance, including biomarker patterns high in plasma: (1) ω-3 and ω-6 polyunsaturated fatty acids (PUFAs), (2) lycopene, (3) ω-3 PUFAs, (4) carotenoids, and (5) vitamins B (riboflavin, folate, B12) and D. Furthermore, three NBPs were associated with enhanced functional brain network efficiency, including biomarker patterns high in plasma: (1) ω-6 PUFAs, (2) ω-3 PUFAs, and (3) carotene. Finally, ω-3 PUFAs moderated the fronto-parietal network and general intelligence, while ω-6 PUFAs and lycopene moderated the dorsal attention network and executive function. In sum, NBPs account for a significant proportion of variance in measures of cognitive performance and functional brain network efficiency. The results motivate a multidisciplinary approach that applies methods from nutritional epidemiology (NBP analysis) and cognitive neuroscience (functional brain network efficiency) to characterize the impact of nutrition on human health, aging, and disease.",Impact of penicillin allergy records on carbapenem prescribing: an observational retrospective cohort study.,https://www.ncbi.nlm.nih.gov/pubmed/30529507,The Journal of hospital infection,2019 04 29,"Penicillin allergy labels have been associated with second-line antibiotic prescribing. This study measured the impact of penicillin allergy labels on meropenem prescribing. Rates of meropenem prescribing were compared between patients with a penicillin allergy record and patients without such a record. Potential confounders were also collected (i.e. age, sex and co-morbidities). Of the 21,272 patients with no penicillin allergy, 225 (1.06%) were prescribed meropenem, whereas of the 3443 patients with penicillin allergy, 240 (6.97%) were prescribed meropenem. Meropenem prescribing is associated with a patient's penicillin allergy record. Given that many penicillin allergy records are incorrect, addressing spurious penicillin allergy labels may reduce meropenem prescribing.","Prospective investigation of carbapenem-resistant Klebsiella pneumonia transmission among the staff, environment and patients in five major intensive care units, Beijing.",https://www.ncbi.nlm.nih.gov/pubmed/30529506,The Journal of hospital infection,2019 03 04,"Following the alarming outbreak of carbapenem-resistant Klebsiella pneumonia (CRKP) in five intensive care units (ICUs) of a tertiary care hospital in China, a prospective investigation of CRKP colonized/infected patients was conducted.",Spring ligament tear decreases static stability of the ankle joint.,https://www.ncbi.nlm.nih.gov/pubmed/30529505,"Clinical biomechanics (Bristol, Avon)",2019 02 18,Spring ligament tear is often found in advanced adult acquired flatfoot deformity and its reconstruction in conjunction with the deltoid ligament has been proposed to restore the tibiotalar and talonavicular joint stability.

The present study focuses on the Schistosomiasis vector snail Biomphalaria glabrata, in which a specific genotype-dependent immunological memory was demonstrated as a shift from a cellular to a humoral immune response. Herein, we investigate the complex molecular bases associated with this genotype-dependant immunological memory response. We demonstrate that Biomphalaria regulates a polymorphic set of immune recognition molecules and immune effector repertoires to respond to different strains of Schistosoma parasites. These results suggest a combinatorial usage of pathogen recognition receptors (PRRs) that distinguish different strains of parasites during the acquisition of immunological memory. Immunizations also show that snails become resistant after exposure to parasite extracts. Hemolymph transfer and a label-free proteomic analysis proved that circulating hemolymph compounds can be produced and released to more efficiently kill the newly encountered parasite of the same genetic lineage.",Economic growth and mental health in 21st century China.,https://www.ncbi.nlm.nih.gov/pubmed/30529490,Social science & medicine (1982),2018 12 21,"Though there are many inconsistencies in the literature, in market economies periods of economic growth, i.e., expansions, have been generally found associated with better mental health than economic contractions, i.e., recessions.

Mental health was assessed by indicators of depression symptoms, cognition impairment, and life dissatisfaction. We found higher rates of GDP growth per capita associated with a deterioration of mental health, manifested by higher scores of depression symptoms, cognitive impairment, and life dissatisfaction. The effects were small in size, quite similar in men and women and were modified by level of income, with the population of lower income being the most harmed by economic growth.",Human Tau isoform-specific presynaptic deficits in a Drosophila Central Nervous System circuit.,https://www.ncbi.nlm.nih.gov/pubmed/30529489,Neurobiology of disease,2019 05 16,"Accumulation of normal or mutant human Tau isoforms in Central Nervous System (CNS) neurons of vertebrate and invertebrate models underlies pathologies ranging from behavioral deficits to neurodegeneration that broadly recapitulate human Tauopathies. Although some functional differences have begun to emerge, it is still largely unclear whether normal and mutant Tau isoforms induce differential effects on the synaptic physiology of CNS neurons. We use the oligosynaptic Giant Fiber System in the adult Drosophila CNS to address this question and reveal that 3R and 4R isoforms affect distinct synaptic parameters. Whereas 0N3R increased failure rate upon high frequency stimulation, 0N4R compromised stimulus conduction and response speed at a specific cholinergic synapse in an age-dependent manner. In contrast, accumulation of the R406W mutant of 0N4R induced mild, age-dependent conduction velocity defects. Because 0N4R and its mutant isoform are expressed equivalently, this demonstrates that the defects are not merely consequent of exogenous human Tau accumulation and suggests distinct functional properties of 3R and 4R isoforms in cholinergic presynapses.",Contemporary IncI1 plasmids involved in the transmission and spread of antimicrobial resistance in Enterobacteriaceae.,https://www.ncbi.nlm.nih.gov/pubmed/30529488,Plasmid,2018 12 14,"IncI1 has become one of the most common plasmid families in contemporary Enterobacteriaceae from both human and animal sources.

This is especially the case in image-based modeling where the inherently quantitative output of the model is measured against image data, which is typically noisy and non-quantitative. In addition, these models can have a high computational cost, limiting the number of feasible simulations, and therefore rendering most traditional parameter estimation methods unsuitable. In this paper, we present a pipeline that uses Gaussian process learning to estimate biological parameters from noisy, non-quantitative image data when the model has a high computational cost. This approach is first successfully tested on a parametric function with the goal of retrieving the original parameters. We then apply it to estimating parameters in a biological setting by fitting artificial in-situ hybridization (ISH) data of the developing murine limb bud. We expect that this method will be of use in a variety of modeling scenarios where quantitative data is missing and the use of standard parameter estimation approaches in biological modeling is prohibited by the computational cost of the model.",A mathematical model to investigate the key drivers of the biogeography of the colon microbiota.,https://www.ncbi.nlm.nih.gov/pubmed/30529486,Journal of theoretical biology,2018 12 23,"The gut microbiota, mainly located in the colon, is engaged in a complex dialogue with the large intestinal epithelium through which important regulatory processes for the health and well-being of the host take place. Imbalances of the microbial populations, called dysbiosis, are related to several pathological status, emphasizing the importance of understanding the gut bacterial ecology. Among the ecological drivers of the microbiota, the spatial structure of the colon is of special interest: spatio-temporal mechanisms can lead to the constitution of spatial interactions among the bacterial populations and of environmental niches that impact the overall colonization of the colon. In the present study, we introduce a mathematical model of the colon microbiota in its fluid environment, based on the explicit coupling of a population dynamics model of microbial populations involved in fibre degradation with a fluid dynamics model of the luminal content. This modeling framework is used to study the main drivers of the spatial structure of the microbiota, specially focusing on the dietary fibre inflow, the epithelial motility, the microbial active swimming and viscosity gradients in the digestive track. We found 1) that the viscosity gradients allow the creation of favorable niches in the vicinity of the mucus layer; 2) that very low microbial active swimming in the radial direction is enough to promote bacterial growth, which sheds a new light on microbial motility in the colon and 3) that dietary fibres are the main driver of the spatial structure of the microbiota in the distal bowel whereas epithelial motility is preponderant for the colonization of the proximal colon; in the transverse colon, fibre levels and chemotaxis have the strongest impact on the distribution of the microbial communities.",Regulation of phosphate uptake kinetics in the bloom-forming dinoflagellates prorocentrum donghaiense with emphasis on two-stage dynamic process.,https://www.ncbi.nlm.nih.gov/pubmed/30529485,Journal of theoretical biology,2019 01 06,"Phosphorus is an essential element for the growth and reproduction of algae. In recent years, the frequent outbreaks of algal blooms caused by eutrophication have drawn much attention to the influence of phosphate (P) uptake on the growth of algal cells. The previous study only considered the effect of total P pools on the P uptake process of algal cells and considered the process as one stage, which is insufficient. P uptake by algae is actually a two-stage kinetic process because in many algae species, surface-adsorbed P pools account for a large proportion of total P pools. In this paper, we fit one-stage and two-stage models of P uptake by algae to our experimental data on short-term uptake kinetics of algae Prorocentrum donghaiense under P-deplete and P-replete conditions at 24°C. According to the experimental results, P. donghaiense possesses different P uptake characteristics under different P concentrations. P. donghaiense grows faster and exponentially for longer periods of time under P-replete condition. Ranges of change of Qc (cell quota of intracellular P) and Sp (cell quota of surface-adsorbed P) during the culture time are obviously larger under P-replete condition than those under P-deplete condition. The value of Kp (represents the impact of P-starvation on P uptake rate) in one-stage model under P-deplete condition is smaller than that under P-replete condition, which is opposite to results of two-stage model and does not meet the actual biological significance of Kp. The two-stage model gives more reasonable and realistic explanations to the process of P uptake by algae no matter from the perspective of intuitive fitting effect, biological significance of parameters, statistical test results or essential dynamic process. These results, combined with long-term lab and field data in ocean, could be used to effectively predict algal blooms.",Efficacy of bilevel ventilatory support in the treatment of stable patients with obesity hypoventilation syndrome: systematic review and meta-analysis.,https://www.ncbi.nlm.nih.gov/pubmed/30529484,Sleep medicine,2019 02 03,To systematically review the effects of bilevel ventilatory support (BVS) in patients with Obesity Hypoventilation Syndrome (OHS).,Efficacy of parent training incorporated in behavioral sleep interventions for children with autism spectrum disorder and/or intellectual disabilities: a systematic review.,https://www.ncbi.nlm.nih.gov/pubmed/30529483,Sleep medicine,2019 02 03,Behavioral sleep interventions are regularly used to improve sleep problems experienced by children with autism spectrum disorder (ASD) and/or intellectual disability (ID).

The aim of the present study was to investigate the electrophysiological characteristics of sulcardine on the hERG and hNav1.5 channels. The hERG and hNav1.5 channels were heterologously stably expressed in human embryonic kidney 293 cells, and the effects of sulcardine on the hERG and hNav1.5 channels were recorded using the standard whole-cell patch-clamp technique. Sulcardine inhibited hERG channels in a concentration-dependent and reversible manner (IC50 = 94.3 μM). In addition, sulcardine shifted the activation curve of hERG channels to more negative potentials. The relative block of sulcardine on hERG channels was close to zero at the time point corresponding to channel opening, which was achieved by applying a depolarizing voltage, and quickly increased afterward. Sulcardine inhibited hNav1.5 channels in a concentration-dependent and reversible manner (IC50 = 15.0 μM) and shifted the inactivation curve of hNav1.5 channels to more negative potentials. The blockade of sulcardine on hNav1.5 channels was use-dependent. In conclusion, sulcardine is a potent hNav1.5 channel blocker with a mild inhibitory effect on hERG channels and preferentially binds to both hERG and hNav1.5 channels in the open and inactivated states rather than in the resting state.",Progression in migraine: Role of mast cells and pro-inflammatory and anti-inflammatory cytokines.,https://www.ncbi.nlm.nih.gov/pubmed/30529470,European journal of pharmacology,2019 05 01,"Migraine is a common painful neurovascular disorder usually associated with several symptoms, such as photophobia, phonophobia, nausea, vomiting and inflammation, and involves immune cells. Mast cells (MCs) are immune cells derived from hematopoietic pluripotent stem cells which migrate and mature close to epithelial, blood vessels, and nerves. In almost all vascularized tissues there are MCs that produce, contain and release biologically active products including cytokines, arachidonic acid compounds, and proteases. In addition, MCs participate in innate and adaptive immune responses. Innate responses in the central nervous system (CNS) occur during neuroinflammatory phenomena, including migraine. Antigens found in the environment have a crucial role in inflammatory response, causing a broad range of diseases including migraine. They can be recognized by several innate immune cells, such as macrophages, microglia, dendritic cells and MCs, which can be activated trough Toll-like receptor (TLR) signaling. MCs reside close to primary nociceptive neurons, associate with nerves, and are capable of triggering local inflammation. MCs are involved in the pathophysiology of various tissues and organs, especially where there is an increase of angiogenesis. Activated MCs release preformed mediators include histamine, heparin, proteases (tryptase, chimase), hydrolases, cathepsin, carboxypeptidases, and peroxidase, and they also generate pro-inflammatory cytokines/chemokines. In addition, activated macrophages, microglia and MCs in the CNS release pro-inflammatory cytokines which provoke an increase of arachidonic acid product levels and lead to migraine and other neurological manifestations including fatigue, nausea, headaches and brain fog. Innate immunity and pro-inflammatory interleukin (IL)-1 cytokine family members can be inhibited by IL-37, a relatively new member of the IL-1 family. In this article, we report that some pro-inflammatory cytokines inducing migraine may be inhibited by IL-37, a natural suppressor of inflammation, and innate and acquired immunity.","Parecoxib, a selective blocker of cyclooxygenase-2, directly inhibits neuronal delayed-rectifier K+ current, M-type K+ current and Na+ current.",https://www.ncbi.nlm.nih.gov/pubmed/30529469,European journal of pharmacology,2019 05 01,"Parecoxib, a prodrug of valdecoxib, is a selective inhibitor of cyclooxygenase-2 and widely used for traumatic and postoperative patients to avoid opioid-induced side effects. It is a potent analgesic and has a role in multimodal analgesic and enhanced recovery after surgery. Whether parecoxib exerts any actions on these types of ionic currents remains unclear. In this study, we investigated whether it exerts any effects on ion currents in differentiated NG108-15 neuronal cells. Cell exposure to parecoxib (1-30 μM) caused a reversible reduction in the amplitude of IK(DR) with an IC50 value of 9.7 μM. The time course for the IK(DR) inactivation in response to a long-lasting pulse was changed to the biexponential process during cell exposure to 3 μM parecoxib. Other agents known to inhibit the cyclooxygenase activity have minimal effects on IK(DR). Parecoxib enhanced the degree of excessive accumulative inhibition of IK(DR) inactivation evoked by a train of brief repetitive stimuli. This compound suppressed the amplitude of M-type K+ current. It depressed the peak amplitude of voltage-gated Na+ current with no change in the current-voltage relationship of this current. However, it did not have any effect on hyperpolarization-activated cation current. No change in the expression level of KV3.1 mRNA was detected in the presence of parecoxib. The effects of parecoxib on ion currents are direct and unrelated to its inhibition of the enzymatic activity of cyclooxygenase-2. The inhibition of these ion channels by parecoxib may partly contribute to the underlying mechanisms by which it affects neuronal function in vivo.",Tenofovir disoproxil fumarate induces pheochromocytoma cells apoptosis.,https://www.ncbi.nlm.nih.gov/pubmed/30529468,European journal of pharmacology,2019 05 01,"Despite the triumph of highly active antiretroviral therapy (HAART) in anti-HIV infection, more than half of the HIV infection individuals receiving antiretroviral therapy acquire HIV-associated neurocognitive disorder (HAND). Previously researches had reported that the HAART neurotoxicity is implicated in HAND-related morbidity. The molecular mechanism of HAND is not clear. Tenofovir disoproxil fumarate (TDF) is a novel nucleotide reverse transcriptase inhibitor (NRTI), which was recommended as first-line therapeutic schedule for free AIDS antiviral drugs. Whether the neurotoxicity of TDF is associated with HAND is not well known. In this study, the cell viability of TDF-treated pheochromocytoma cells (PC-12) line was detected using MTT assay, while apoptosis was evaluated by Hoechst 33342 staining, TUNEL assay, as well as flow cytometry. In addition, the level of reactive oxygen species and BAX protein expression were evaluated using DCFH-DA staining and western blotting. The results showed that the proliferation of PC-12 cells was significantly inhibited by TDF. The morphological assay, TUNEL assay and flow cytometry showed that TDF efficiently triggered apoptosis in PC-12 cells. The reactive oxygen species levels were BAX expression was markedly up-regulated in PC-12 cells after treatment with TDF. These findings indicated that TDF may induce PC-12 cell apoptosis. TDF has neural toxicity effect that is relevant to the cell apoptosis, which may be related to the increasing prevalence of HAND.",Differential expressions and functions of phosphodiesterase enzymes in different regions of the rat heart.,https://www.ncbi.nlm.nih.gov/pubmed/30529467,European journal of pharmacology,2019 05 01,"Phosphodiesterase enzymes (PDEs) are responsible for the adjustment of cyclic nucleotide levels. Alterations in PDE expressions in different tissues cause conflicts between functional and clinical effects of PDE inhibitors. Therefore, the aim of this study was to investigate the gene and protein expressions and the functional role of PDEs in atrium and ventricle of rat heart. The expressions of PDEs were examined in cardiac intact tissues and enzymatically isolated cells. The effects of PDE1-5 inhibitors (vinpocetine, EHNA, milrinone, rolipram, sildenafil, and IBMX) on basal and isoprenaline-stimulated contractions and sinus rate were recorded in the isolated spontaneously beating right atrium and electrically stimulated left papillary muscles. The mRNA and protein levels of PDEs were significantly different in atrial and ventricular intact tissues and isolated myocytes. Atrial contractions were increased with vinpocetine while suppressed by EHNA, milrinone, rolipram, sildenafil and IBMX. Milrinone, sildenafil and IBMX increased the heart rate whereas vinpocetine caused negative chronotropy. Papillary muscle contractions have been increased only with the vinpocetine and IBMX. Both the expression and the action of PDE-1-5 show atrial and ventricular differences. Therefore, these differences should be taken into account in the experimental or therapeutic approaches of the heart.",Patellar tendon enthesis abnormalities and their association with knee pain and structural abnormalities in older adults.,https://www.ncbi.nlm.nih.gov/pubmed/30529466,Osteoarthritis and cartilage,2019 02 26,"To describe associations between presence of patellar tendon enthesis (PTE) abnormalities and symptoms, structural abnormalities, and total knee replacement (TKR) in older adult cohort.",Identification and functional characterization of interferon-γ-inducible lysosomal thiol reductase (GILT) gene in common Chinese cuttlefish Sepiella japonica.,https://www.ncbi.nlm.nih.gov/pubmed/30529465,Fish & shellfish immunology,2019 05 23,"Interferon-γ-inducible lysosomal thiol reductase (GILT) is a pivotal enzyme involved in the histocompatibility complex (MHC) class II-restricted antigen processing whereby it catalyzes the disulfide bond reduction in the endocytic pathway. Here, a novel GILT homologue termed as SjGILT firstly identified from common Chinese cuttlefish Sepiella japonica. SjGILT shared domain topology containing a signal peptide, a signature sequence CQHGX2ECX2NX4C, an activate-site CXXC motif, two potential N-glycosylation sites and six conserved cysteins with its counterparts in other animals. SjGILT transcripts were constitutively expressed in all examined tissues in S. japonica, with the higher expression levels in immune-related tissues such as pancreas, intestines, liver and gills. Upon lipopolysaccharide (LPS) challenge, SjGILT transcripts were significantly induced in liver and gill tissues, and SjGILT protein transferred to late endosomes and lysosomes in HeLa cells. Further study showed that recombinant SjGILT had obvious thiol reductase activity demonstrated by reducing the interchain disulfide bonds of IgG under acidic conditions. Taken together, these results suggested that SjGILT may be involved in the immune response to bacteria challenge, and then might play an important role in the processing of MHC class II-restricted antigens in S. japonica.","Molecular and transcriptional insights into viperin protein from Big-belly seahorse (Hippocampus abdominalis), and its potential antiviral role.",https://www.ncbi.nlm.nih.gov/pubmed/30529464,Fish & shellfish immunology,2019 05 23,"Viperin is recognized as an antiviral protein that is stimulated by interferon, viral exposures, and other pathogenic molecules in vertebrate. In this study, a viperin homolog in the Big-belly seahorse (Hippocampus abdominalis; HaVip) was functionally characterized to determine its subcellular localization, expression pattern, and antiviral activity in vitro. The HaVip coding sequence encodes a 348 amino acid polypeptide with predicted molecular weight of 38.48 kDa. Sequence analysis revealed that HaVip comprises three main domains: the N-terminal amphipathic α-helix, a radical S-adenosyl-l-methionine (SAM) domain, and a conserved C-terminal domain. Transfected GFP-tagged HaVip protein was found to localize to the endoplasmic reticulum (ER). Overexpressed-HaVip in FHM cells was found to significantly reduce viral capsid gene expression in VHSV infection in vitro. Under normal physiological conditions, HaVip expression was ubiquitously detected in all 14 examined tissues of the seahorse, with the highest expression observed in the heart, followed by skin and blood. In vivo studies showed that HaVip was rapidly and predominantly upregulated in blood, kidney, and intestinal tissue upon poly (I:C) stimulus. LPS and Streptococus iniae challenges caused a significant increase in expression of HaVip in all the analyzed tissues. The obtained results suggest that HaVip is involved in the immune system of the seahorse, triggering antiviral and antibacterial responses, upon viral and bacterial pathogenic infections.",Molecular cloning and functional characterization of a short peptidoglycan recognition protein from triangle-shell pearl mussel (Hyriopsis cumingii).,https://www.ncbi.nlm.nih.gov/pubmed/30529463,Fish & shellfish immunology,2019 05 23,"Peptidoglycan (PGN) is an important target of recognition in invertebrate innate immunity. PGN recognition proteins (PGRPs) are responsible for PGN recognition. In this study, we cloned and functionally analyzed a short PGRP (HcPGRP2) from the triangle-shell pearl mussel Hyriopsis cumingii. The full-length cDNA sequence of HcPGRP2 gene was 1185 bp containing an open reading frame of 882 bp encoding a 293 amino acid protein. HcPGRP2 was predicted to have two SH3b domains and a conserved C-terminal PGRP domain. Quantitative real-time RT-PCR showed that HcPGRP2 was expressed in all examined tissues and its expression was induced most significantly by Staphylococcus aureus and Vibrio parahaemolyticus in the hepatopancreas and gills. RNA interference by siRNA results revealed that HcPGRP2 was involved in the regulation of whey acidic protein, theromacin, and defensin expression. As a pattern-recognition receptor, recombinant HcPGRP2 (rHcPGRP2) protein can bind and agglutinate (Ca2+ dependent) all tested bacteria. rHcPGRP2 exhibited specific binding to PGN but not to lipopolysaccharide. Moreover, rHcPGRP2 inhibited the growth activities of S. aureus and V. parahaemolyticus in vitro and accelerated the clearance of V. parahaemolyticus in vivo. Overall, our results indicated that HcPGRP2 may play an important role in the antibacterial immune mechanisms of H. cumingii.",Subchronic toxicity evaluation of isoeugenyl methyl ether in F344/DuCrj rats by 13-week oral administration.,https://www.ncbi.nlm.nih.gov/pubmed/30529462,Regulatory toxicology and pharmacology : RTP,2019 02 22,"Isoeugenyl methyl ether (CAS No. 93-16-3) is a food additive used as a nature identical flavoring agent. To determine the toxicity profile and the no-observed-adverse-effect level (NOAEL), we performed a subchronic toxicity test in male and female F344/DuCrj rats by intragastric administration of isoeugenyl methyl ether at doses of 8, 40, and 200 mg/kg body weight (BW)/day for 13 weeks. In this study, BW gain in the male 200 mg/kg BW/day group was decreased from week 9. In serum biochemistry, decreased triglycerides were observed in the male 200 mg/kg BW/day group. In organ weights, increases in both absolute and relative liver weights were observed in both sexes in the 200 mg/kg BW/day group. In histopathological examination, hepatocyte hypertrophy was observed in the male 200 mg/kg BW/day group. Based on these results, we concluded that the main target organ of isoeugenyl methyl ether was the liver and that the NOAEL of isoeugenyl methyl ether for both male and female F344/DuCrj rats was estimated to be 40 mg/kg BW/day."

Neurocysticercosis, caused by Taenia solium, tends to affect the poor in developing countries and control is hampered by inadequate infrastructure and financial resources coupled with lack of adequate information about its significance and distribution. The risk factors for human cysticercosis are closely associated with the characteristics of smallholder or backyard pig farming systems prevalent in this region. Poverty, ignorance and lack of political will militate against successful eradication, while tools for effective diagnosis, prevention and treatment, including vaccines for pigs, are not yet available in many countries. Cysticercosis was targeted for control by The World Health Organization global plan for 2008-2015; however, measures for control are yet to be undertaken in a coordinated manner in West Africa. Diagnostic tools, including neuroimaging facilities, should be strategically situated and made accessible to rural populations in West Africa. Community education in combination with a multipronged approach consisting of vaccination of pigs using TSOL18 vaccine and treatment with oxfendazole along with mass chemotherapy of humans with praziquantel could eliminate taeniasis and should be considered. In-depth and extensive epidemiological studies are required in West Africa in order to fully elucidate the prevalence of T. solium and to support more coordinated and effective control of human and porcine cysticercosis.",Wing morphometric analysis of forensically important flesh flies (Diptera: Sarcophagidae) in Thailand.,https://www.ncbi.nlm.nih.gov/pubmed/30529446,Acta tropica,2019 03 14,"Flesh flies are insects of forensic importance as the larvae associated with human remains can be used to estimate a minimum post-mortem interval (PMImin) in most cases. And, because life-history traits can vary across species, correct identification is a mandatory step before being used as evidence. Adult flesh flies are extremely similar in general appearance, which causes difficulty in species identification as it is largely based on the morphology of the male genitalia; this also makes it difficult to identify females. Currently, landmark-based geometric morphometric analysis of insect wings has proven to be a valuable tool for species identification. Herein, we applied wing morphometric analysis of 524 flesh fly specimens comprising 12 species from Thailand. The right wing of each specimen was removed, mounted on a microscope slide, photographed, and digitized using 18 landmarks. Wing shape variation among genera and species were analyzed using canonical variate analysis, while wing shape variation between sexes of each species was analyzed using discriminant function analysis. A cross-validation test was used to evaluate the reliability of classification. Results of this study demonstrate wing shape can be used to separate genera and species, and distinguish between sexes of the same species, with high reliability. Therefore, the landmark-based geometric morphometric analysis of wings is a useful additional method for species and sex discrimination of flesh flies.",Growth-disrupting Murraya koenigii leaf extracts on Anopheles gambiae larvae and identification of associated candidate bioactive constituents.,https://www.ncbi.nlm.nih.gov/pubmed/30529445,Acta tropica,2019 03 14,"Plant-based constituents have been proposed as eco-friendly alternatives to synthetic insecticides for control of mosquito vectors of malaria. In this study, we first screened the effects of methanolic leaf extracts of curry tree (Murraya koenigii) growing in tropical (Mombasa, Malindi) and semi-arid (Kibwezi, and Makindu) ecological zones of Kenya on third instar An. gambiae s.s. larvae. Extracts of the plant from the semi-arid region, and particularly from Kibwezi, led to high mortality of the larvae. Bioassay-guided fractionation of the methanolic extract of the leaves of the plants from Kibwezi was then undertaken and the most active fraction (20 fold more potent than the crude extract) was then analyzed by Liquid chromatography quadruple time of flight coupled with mass spectrometry (LC-QtoF-MS) and a number of constituents were identified, including a major alkaloid constituent, Neplanocin A (5). Exposure of the third instar larvae to a sub-lethal dose (4.43 ppm) of this fraction over 7-day periods induced gross morphogenetic abnormalities in the larvae, with reduced locomotion, and delayed pupation. Moreover, the few adults that emerged from some pupae failed to fly from the water surface, unlike in the untreated control group. These results demonstrate subtle growth-disrupting effects of the phytochemical blend from M. koenigii leaves on aquatic stages An. gambiae mosquito. The study lays down some useful groundwork for the downstream development of phytochemical blends that can be evaluated for integration into eco-friendly control of An. gambiae vector population targeting the often overlooked but important immature stages of the malaria vector.","Evaluation of pain, functional capacity and kinesiophobia in women in the chronic stage of chikungunya virus infection: a cross-sectional study in northeastern Brazil.",https://www.ncbi.nlm.nih.gov/pubmed/30529444,Acta tropica,2018 12 11,"Arboviral diseases have been considered a global public health problem due to their growing territorial dispersion and impact on the population around the world. Individuals affected by the chikungunya virus go through an acute febrile illness associated with severe pain and long-lasting polyarthralgia. After the initial stage, infected individuals may progress to the chronic stage, which has an epidemic character and a high rate of disability and reduced mobility, impacting negatively on their quality of life. The aim of this study was to evaluate the relationship between pain, functional capacity, and kinesiophobia in individuals in the chronic stage of chikungunya virus infection. A cross-sectional study was conducted in the city of Natal, in Rio Grande do Norte, Brazil, between July and September 2018. The participants were 59 women in the chronic stage of chikungunya virus infection. Data were collected in at physical therapy outpatient clinic of the Federal University of Rio Grande do Norte (UFRN), using a socio-demographic questionnaire, the Visual Analogue Scale (VAS), the Nordic Musculoskeletal Questionnaire (NMQ), the Brief Pain Inventory (BPI), the Health Assessment Questionnaire (HAQ), and the Tampa Scale for Kinesiophobia (TSK). Descriptive statistics and bivariate analysis of the time data were conducted by simple regression. The participants' mean age was just over 50 years and average duration of virus infection was 21.54 months. Most participants had moderate to severe pain intensity that more frequent in the ankle and wrist joints. Functional capacity was low, and there was moderate fear of performing exercises and activities of daily living. Duration of infection was associated with increased pain intensity and loss of functional capacity. We can conclude that women in the chronic stage of chikungunya infection have significant pain, reduced functional capacity, and fear of performing common movements of daily living.",Leishmania infection: Misdiagnosis as cancer and tumor-promoting potential.,https://www.ncbi.nlm.nih.gov/pubmed/30529443,Acta tropica,2018 12 11,"Given the prevalence of cancer and leishmaniasis worldwide, the presence of these two pathologies in the same tissue sample may be merely fortuitous. The clinical outcome of both diseases is under the control of innate and adaptive immunity, and in both cases these progressive diseases are characterized by an impaired host Th1 response. As a consequence, the Th2 cytokine microenvironment occurring in progressive leishmaniasis may potentially promote tumor cell proliferation and vice versa. On the other hand, clinical aspects of subclinical cutaneous or visceral leishmaniasis sometimes closely resemble those observed in various neoplasms thus leading to misdiagnosis. In this review, we present recent findings on the association between leishmaniasis and malignant disorders. Our review includes HIV positive, HIV negative subjects and patients whose HIV status has not been established. Leishmaniasis mimicking a malignant disorder was confirmed and extended to unreported neoplastic disorders including squamous cell carcinoma, T-cell and B-cell lymphoma, oral and intranasal tumors and granulomas. Thus, leishmaniasis should be considered in the differential diagnosis and course of various cancers in Leishmania endemic areas or in patients with travel history to these areas. We also listed recent reports showing that Leishmania can promote cancer development in immunocompromised as well as in immunocompetent patients. The potential mechanisms supporting this promoting effect are discussed.",Comparative Responsiveness of the PROMIS Pain Interference Short Forms With Legacy Pain Measures: Results From Three Randomized Clinical Trials.,https://www.ncbi.nlm.nih.gov/pubmed/30529442,The journal of pain : official journal of the American Pain Society,2019 06 13,"The Patient-Reported Outcomes Measurement Information System Pain Interference (PROMIS-PI) scales are reliable and publicly accessible; however, little is known about how responsive they are to detect change in clinical trials and how their responsiveness compares with legacy measures.

The clinical trials included patients with chronic low back pain (n = 261), chronic back or osteoarthritis pain (n = 240), and a history of stroke (n = 258). At both baseline and follow-up, participants completed PROMIS-PI scales and legacy pain measures (Brief Pain Inventory Interference scale; Pain, Enjoyment, General Activity scale; 36-Item Short Form Survey (SF-36) Bodily Pain scale; and Roland-Morris Disability Questionnaire). We measured global ratings of pain change, both prospectively and retrospectively, as anchors to identify patients as improved, unchanged, or worsened. Responsiveness was assessed with standardized response means, statistical tests comparing change groups, and area under the curve analysis. The PROMIS-PI scales had largely comparable responsiveness with the Brief Pain Inventory Interference and Pain, Enjoyment, General Activity scales. The 4 PROMIS-PI short forms had comparable responsiveness. For all pain questionnaires, responsiveness varied based on the study population and whether pain improved or worsened. PERSPECTIVE: This article presents 1) how responsive the PROMIS-PI scales were to detect change over time in the context of 3 clinical trials and 2) how their responsiveness compared with legacy pain measures. The findings can help researchers and clinicians choose between different patient-reported pain outcome measures.",Efficacy of the cardiac septal occluder in the treatment of post-bariatric surgery leaks and fistulas.,https://www.ncbi.nlm.nih.gov/pubmed/30529441,Gastrointestinal endoscopy,2019 04 02,"Endoscopy has evolved to become first-line therapy for the treatment of post-bariatric leaks; however, many sessions are often required with variable success rates.

According to future scenarios, mountain regions are highly vulnerable to climate impacts, including changes in the water cycle (e.g. rainfall extremes, melting of glaciers, river runoff), loss of biodiversity and ecosystems services, damages to local economy (drinking water supply, hydropower generation, agricultural suitability) and human safety (risks of natural hazards). This is due to their exposure to recent climate warming (e.g. temperature regime changes, thawing of permafrost) and the high degree of specialization of both natural and human systems (e.g. mountain species, valley population density, tourism-based economy). These characteristics call for the application of risk assessment methodologies able to describe the complex interactions among multiple hazards, biophysical and socio-economic systems, towards climate change adaptation. Current approaches used to assess climate change risks often address individual risks separately and do not fulfil a comprehensive representation of cumulative effects associated to different hazards (i.e. compound events). Moreover, pioneering multi-layer single risk assessment (i.e. overlapping of single-risk assessments addressing different hazards) is still widely used, causing misleading evaluations of multi-risk processes. This raises key questions about the distinctive features of multi-risk assessments and the available tools and methods to address them. Here we present a review of five cutting-edge modelling approaches (Bayesian networks, agent-based models, system dynamic models, event and fault trees, and hybrid models), exploring their potential applications for multi-risk assessment and climate change adaptation in mountain regions. The comparative analysis sheds light on advantages and limitations of each approach, providing a roadmap for methodological and technical implementation of multi-risk assessment according to distinguished criteria (e.g. spatial and temporal dynamics, uncertainty management, cross-sectoral assessment, adaptation measures integration, data required and level of complexity). The results show limited applications of the selected methodologies in addressing the climate and risks challenge in mountain environments. In particular, system dynamic and hybrid models demonstrate higher potential for further applications to represent climate change effects on multi-risk processes for an effective implementation of climate adaptation strategies.",Classifying private landowners to improve understanding of management decisions and conservation opportunities in urbanizing forested landscapes.,https://www.ncbi.nlm.nih.gov/pubmed/30529417,Journal of environmental management,2019 02 16,"Viewed as coupled natural and human systems, urbanizing forested landscapes exhibit fascinating and complex dynamics, where landowner decisions and biophysical processes together influence conservation and development outcomes. To improve understanding of land management decisions and conservation opportunities on private lands in these landscapes, we developed a landowner typology that accounts for heterogeneity among landowners that goes beyond ownership objectives and investigated its usefulness in predicting individual private landowners' stated intentions to implement diverse land management actions. Using survey responses collected from private landowners in two metropolitan areas in Maine, USA, we focused on understanding differences in owners' stated likelihood of implementing four conservation practices (i.e., forest management plan, conservation easement, water quality protection, and wildlife habitat conservation) and three land tenure actions (i.e., land sales and large and small subdivisions). Cluster analysis based on measures of place attachment values, stewardship beliefs, and forest production objectives revealed four distinct landowner classes that, in turn, increased the explanatory power of our predictive models of management intentions. Our findings support consideration of heterogeneity beyond production objectives to improve understanding of landowner decision-making, the design and performance of conservation programs, and engagement with landowners. Adjusting data, analysis, and communication strategies to recognize these multiple motivations of landowners has potential to advance the science and practice of conserving forested landscapes."

By using c-Fos immunohistochemistry, we assessed the piriform cortex activity induced by flavor familiarity. The results indicated increased activity in the rostral region of the posterior piriform cortex elicited by the most familiar cider vinegar solution after six exposures. Aged rats exhibited overall increased activity in the posterior, but not the anterior piriform cortex, which was not related to flavor familiarity. This suggests that the posterior piriform cortex is related to flavor recognition memory and that aging modifies its activity pattern which might underlie their slower attenuation of flavor neophobia.",Evaluation of the effects of chemotherapy-induced fatigue and pharmacological interventions in multiple mouse behavioral assays.,https://www.ncbi.nlm.nih.gov/pubmed/30529403,Behavioural brain research,2019 05 02,"Fatigue is a common symptom in many diseases and disorders and can reduce quality of life, yet lacks an adequate pharmacological intervention. To identify and develop such interventions, and to better understand fatigue, additional preclinical research is necessary. However, despite numerous mouse behavioral assays reportedly detecting fatigue-like behavior, the assumption that fatigue-like behavior is detected in many assays has not been validated through a cross-assay study. Thus, we modeled fatigue in mice by administering 5-fluorouracil, a chemotherapy drug known to cause fatigue in humans and fatigue-like behavior in mice, then evaluated its effects via voluntary wheel running activity (VWRA), locomotor activity in the open field test (OFT), immobility in the forced swim test (FST), and distance run in the treadmill fatigue test (TFT) and treadmill exercise capacity test. Additionally, taltirelin or methylphenidate was administered to alleviate fatigue-like behavior. As a result of 5-fluorouracil treatment, VWRA and the TFT were markedly reduced, indicating fatigue. The OFT, FST, and treadmill exercise capacity test, however, failed to detect fatigue-like behavior. Interestingly, both taltirelin and methylphenidate alleviated fatigue-like behavior in TFT. These data suggest that, of the current assays, only the TFT and VWRA should be expected to detect fatigue-like behavior. Moreover, this study provides additional evidence that taltirelin may provide a novel treatment for chemotherapy-induced fatigue and warrants further evaluation as an anti-fatigue therapeutic.",Admixing MPTP-resistant and MPTP-vulnerable mice enhances striatal field potentials and calbindin-D28K expression to avert motor behaviour deficits.,https://www.ncbi.nlm.nih.gov/pubmed/30529402,Behavioural brain research,2019 05 02,"Asian-Indians are less vulnerable to Parkinson's disease (PD) than the Caucasians. Their admixed populace has even lesser risk. Studying this phenomenon using 1-methyl-4-phenyl-1,2,3,6-tetrahydropyridine (MPTP)-susceptible C57BL/6J, MPTP-resistant CD-1 and their resistant crossbred mice revealed differences in the nigrostriatal cyto-molecular features. Here, we investigated the electrophysiological and behavioural correlates for differential MPTP-susceptibility and their outcome upon admixing. We recorded local field potentials (LFPs) from dorsal striatum and assessed motor co-ordination using rotarod and grip strength measures. Nigral calbindin-D28K expression, a regulator of striatal activity through nigrostriatal projections was evaluated using immunohistochemistry. The crossbreds had significantly higher baseline striatal LFPs. MPTP significantly increased the neuronal activity in delta (0.5-4 Hz) and low beta (12-16 Hz) ranges in C57BL/6J; significant increase across frequency bands till high beta (0.5-30 Hz) in CD-1, and caused no alterations in crossbreds. MPTP further depleted the already low nigral calbindin-D28K expression in C57BL/6J. While in crossbreds, it was further up-regulated. MPTP affected the rotarod and grip strength performance of the C57BL/6J, while the injected CD-1 and crossbreds performed well. The increased striatal β-oscillations are comparable to that in PD patients. Higher power in CD-1 may be compensatory in nature, which were also reported in pre-symptomatic monkeys. Concurrent up-regulation of nigral calbindin-D28K may assist maintenance of striatal activity by buffering calcium overload in nigra. Thus, preserved motor behaviour in PD reminiscent conditions in CD-1 and crossbreds complement compensated/unaffected striatal LFPs. Similar electrophysiological correlates and cytomorphological features are envisaged in human phenomenon of differential PD prevalence, which are modulated upon admixing.",Moderate prenatal alcohol exposure impairs performance by adult male rats in an object-place paired-associate task.,https://www.ncbi.nlm.nih.gov/pubmed/30529401,Behavioural brain research,2019 05 02,"Memory impairments, including spatial and object processing, are often observed in individuals with Fetal Alcohol Spectrum Disorders. The neurobiological basis of memory deficits after prenatal alcohol exposure (PAE) is often linked to structural and functional alterations in the medial temporal lobe, including the hippocampus. Recent evidence suggests that the medial temporal lobe plays a critical role in processing high-order sensory stimuli such as complex objects and their associated locations in space. In the first experiment, we tested male rat offspring with moderate PAE in a medial temporal-dependent object-place paired-associate (OPPA) task. The OPPA task requires a conditional discrimination between an identical pair of objects presented at two spatial locations 180° opposite arms of a radial arm maze. Food reinforcement is contingent upon selecting the correct object of the pair for a given spatial location. Adult rats were given a total of 10 trials per day over 14 consecutive days of training. PAE male rats made significantly more errors than male saccharin (SACC) control rats during acquisition of the OPPA task. In Experiment 2, rats performed an object-discrimination task in which a pair of objects were presented in a single arm of the maze. Moderate PAE and SACC control rats exhibited comparable performance. The results suggest that moderate PAE rats can learn to discriminate objects, but are impaired when required to discriminate between objects on the basis of spatial location in the environment.",Tonic thermonociceptive stimulation selectively modulates ongoing neural oscillations in the human posterior insula: Evidence from intracerebral EEG.,https://www.ncbi.nlm.nih.gov/pubmed/30529399,NeuroImage,2019 06 14,"The human insula is an important target for spinothalamic input, but there is still no consensus on its role in pain perception and nociception. In this study, we show that the human insula exhibits activity preferential for sustained thermonociception. Using intracerebral EEG recorded from the insula of 8 patients (2 females) undergoing a presurgical evaluation of focal epilepsy (53 contacts: 27 anterior, 26 posterior), we ""frequency-tagged"" the insular activity elicited by sustained thermonociceptive and vibrotactile stimuli, by periodically modulating stimulation intensity at a fixed frequency of 0.2 Hz during 75 s. Both types of stimuli elicited an insular response at the frequency of stimulation (0.2 Hz) and its harmonics, whose magnitude was significantly greater in the posterior insula compared to the anterior insula. Compared to vibrotactile stimulation, thermonociceptive stimulation exerted a markedly greater 0.2 Hz modulation of ongoing theta-band (4-8 Hz) and alpha-band (8-12 Hz) oscillations. These modulations were also more prominent in the posterior insula compared to the anterior insula. The identification of oscillatory activities preferential for thermonociception could lead to new insights into the physiological mechanisms of nociception and pain perception in humans.",Improved EEG source localization with Bayesian uncertainty modelling of unknown skull conductivity.,https://www.ncbi.nlm.nih.gov/pubmed/30529398,NeuroImage,2019 06 14,"Electroencephalography (EEG) source imaging is an ill-posed inverse problem that requires accurate conductivity modelling of the head tissues, especially the skull. Unfortunately, the conductivity values are difficult to determine in vivo. In this paper, we show that the exact knowledge of the skull conductivity is not always necessary when the Bayesian approximation error (BAE) approach is exploited. In BAE, we first postulate a probability distribution for the skull conductivity that describes our (lack of) knowledge on its value, and model the effects of this uncertainty on EEG recordings with the help of an additive error term in the observation model. Before the Bayesian inference, the likelihood is marginalized over this error term. Thus, in the inversion we estimate only our primary unknown, the source distribution. We quantified the improvements in the source localization when the proposed Bayesian modelling was used in the presence of different skull conductivity errors and levels of measurement noise. Based on the results, BAE was able to improve the source localization accuracy, particularly when the unknown (true) skull conductivity was much lower than the expected standard conductivity value. The source locations that gained the highest improvements were shallow and originally exhibited the largest localization errors. In our case study, the benefits of BAE became negligible when the signal-to-noise ratio dropped to 20 dB.",A longitudinal study of infant view-invariant face processing during the first 3-8 months of life.,https://www.ncbi.nlm.nih.gov/pubmed/30529397,NeuroImage,2019 05 14,"View-invariant face processing emerges early in life. A previous study (Nakato et al., 2009) measured infant hemodynamic responses to faces from the frontal and profile views in the bilateral temporal areas, which have been reported to be involved in face processing using near-infrared spectroscopy. It was reported that 5-month-old infants showed increased oxyhemoglobin (oxy-Hb) responses to frontal faces, but not to profile faces. In contrast, 8-month-old infants displayed increased oxy-Hb responses to profile faces as well as to frontal faces. In this study, we used the experimental method developed in the previous study to investigate the development of view-invariant face processing, every month for 5 months (from the first 3-8 months of life). We longitudinally measured hemodynamic responses to faces from the frontal and profile views in 14 infants. The longitudinal measurements allowed us to investigate individual differences in each participant. We modeled each infant's hemodynamic oxy-Hb responses to frontal and profile faces using linear regression analysis. Processing of profile faces emerged later and underwent larger improvements than that of frontal faces. We also found an anticorrelation between the speed of improvement in face processing and the hemodynamic response to faces at the age of 3- months. Group analysis of the averaged hemodynamic data from the 14 infants using linear regression revealed that the processing of profile faces emerged between 5 and 6 months of age. Infant view-invariant face processing developed first for frontal faces. This was followed by the emergence of processing of profile faces.",Olfactory loss is associated with reduced hippocampal activation in response to emotional pictures.,https://www.ncbi.nlm.nih.gov/pubmed/30529396,NeuroImage,2019 06 14,"Emotional processing evolved within brain structures that were originally dedicated to olfactory function. Reduced olfactory function, absence of the olfactory bulb and the experimental removal of the olfactory bulb are associated with depressive behavior. Against this background, we hypothesized that olfactory dysfunction modifies the neural processing of non-olfactory emotion information. Using a functional magnetic resonance imaging design, we therefore tested whether people with and without impaired olfactory function differ in emotional perception and processing. Neural activity of 17 patients with acquired olfactory loss and 23 age- and sex-matched control participants were monitored in the MRI scanner, while they were presented with emotional and neutral pictures. Participants rated the valence and arousal for each picture after scanning. Patients showed reduced right hippocampal brain responses to emotional but not neutral pictures independent of their depressive symptoms. In addition, emotion-dependent activation in the hippocampus and insula was positively associated with the olfactory bulb (OB) volumes in healthy participants. Taken together, these findings suggest a disrupted neural processing of emotional pictures among patients with olfactory loss. This indicates a significant role of the neural olfactory trajectories for general emotion processing. Central emotion processing is reduced in olfactory disorders and relates to the OB volume in normosmic individuals.",Functional characterization of a cDNA encoding Piwi protein in Penaeus monodon and its potential roles in controlling transposon expression and spermatogenesis.,https://www.ncbi.nlm.nih.gov/pubmed/30529395,"Comparative biochemistry and physiology. Part A, Molecular & integrative physiology",2019 01 21,"Piwi proteins comprise a subfamily of Argonaute that plays a major role in germline development by association with a distinct class of small RNAs called Piwi interacting RNA (piRNA). Although the functions of Piwi in the development of germline cells as well as transposon regulation were reported in a number of mammalians and insects, developmental expression and function of Piwi subfamily in crustaceans is poorly known. This study is aimed at cloning and characterization of a Piwi cDNA in the black tiger shrimp, Penaeus monodon. The cDNA encoding a Piwi protein of P. monodon (PmPiwi1) was obtained by rapid amplification of cDNA ends (RACE). The PmPiwi1 coding cDNA contains 2811 nt encoding a putative protein of 936 amino acids, and was specifically expressed in testis and ovary, suggesting its possible function in gametogenesis. RNAi experiment showed that suppression of PmPiwi1 expression led to a significant up-regulation of retrotransposon gypsy2 and DNA element transposon mariner in shrimp testis. Investigation of the function of PmPiwi1 in spermatogenesis by sperm count showed significantly lower number of sperms in the spermatophore sac of PmPiwi1-knockdown shrimp compared with that in the control shrimp. Our study thus reported for the first time the cDNA encoding a Piwi protein in the shrimp P. monodon. Its roles in controlling transposons and spermatogenesis as implied by the results in this study will be important for understanding sperm development and could be useful for the improvement of reproduction in male shrimp in the future.","Auricular acupuncture as an adjunct for pain management during first trimester abortion: a randomized, double-blinded, three arm trial.",https://www.ncbi.nlm.nih.gov/pubmed/30529393,Contraception,2019 03 18,"To assess pain-management using auricular acupuncture as an adjunct to ibuprofen and paracervical block during first trimester uterine aspiration, and to assess auricular acupuncture's effect on anxiety."

The toxicity was subsided in broilers received a specific aflatoxin-binding probiotic i.e., Lactobacillus plantarum 299v (Lp299v). There was a substantial (30-90%) increase in antioxidant activity of plasma, which was suppressed due to dietary aflatoxins. Probiotic also reduced serum lactate dehydrogenase and alanine amino transferase together with lipid peroxidation products in liver, which were elevated due to aflatoxin. Because of Lp299v consumption, there was ∼20-55% recovery in body weight gain in broilers intoxicated with aflatoxins. Comparison of the Lp299v effects with that of a commercial aflatoxin binder revealed that, improved antioxidant activity of the chicks was associated with growth performance. These data suggest that aflatoxin-binding probiotics are beneficial with multi-functional effects and can efficiently help reducing aflatoxins in food chain associated with poultry industry.",Queen venom isosolenopsin A delivers rapid incapacitation of fire ant competitors.,https://www.ncbi.nlm.nih.gov/pubmed/30529381,Toxicon : official journal of the International Society on Toxinology,2019 06 05,"Fire ant venom contains insecticidal alkaloids named 'solenopsins'. Whilst species-specific differences are reported, little attention has been given to caste-specific venom adaptations. The venom of fire ant queens has remained particularly poorly studied, though studies have shown it to be strikingly similar across different species, in being primarily composed of the alkaloid isosolenopsin A, regardless of the chemical configuration in workers. We predict that this is the evolutionary outcome of stabilising selection, implying that a shared mechanism is responsible for the conserved venom composition among fire ant queens. The present investigation tests whether venom plays a role in nest founding, when queens must succeed in isolation in the field against competitor species. Here, we report that fire ant queen venom and isosolenopsin A are faster to incapacitate alien ants than the venom of fire ant workers. Representative sympatric competitor ant species were selected and exposed on their heads to the venom of workers and queens of the invasive fire ant species Solenopsis invicta and S. geminata. Queen venom was found to incapacitate rival foragers quicker than worker venom. The effects were reproduced using synthetic solenopsins, establishing that solenopsin A analogues are particularly effective contact neurotoxins. Overall, the venom of S. invicta is more lethal than of S. geminata, regardless of the incapacitation speed. We believe these are fundamental aspects of the chemical ecology of the invasive ants which remain overlooked, and emphasise the need for further studies into the venom biology of founding queens.","A review of cardiac glycosides: Structure, toxicokinetics, clinical signs, diagnosis and antineoplastic potential.",https://www.ncbi.nlm.nih.gov/pubmed/30529380,Toxicon : official journal of the International Society on Toxinology,2019 06 05,"Cardiac glycosides (CGs) are secondary compounds found in plants and amphibians and are widely distributed in nature with potential cardiovascular action. Their mechanism is based on the blockage of the heart's sodium potassium ATPase, with a positive inotropic effect. Some of the most well-known CGs are digoxin, ouabain, oleandrin, and bufalin. They have similar chemical structures: a lactone ring, steroid ring, and sugar moiety. Digoxin, ouabain, and oleandrin are classified as cardenolides, consisting of a lactone ring with five carbons, while bufalin is classified as bufodienolides, with a six-carbon ring. Small structural differences determine variations in the toxicokinetics and toxicodynamics of such substances. Most case reports of poisoning caused by CGs are associated with cardiovascular toxicity, causing a variety of arrhythmias and lesions in the heart tissue. Experimental studies also describe important similarities among different CGs, especially regarding species sensitivity. Recent studies furthermore focus on their antineoplastic potential, with controversial results. Data from research studies and case reports were reviewed to identify the main characteristics of the CGs, including toxicokinetics, toxicodynamics, clinical signs, electrocardiographic, pathological findings, antineoplastic potential and the main techniques used for diagnostic purposes.",Evaluation of vasoactivity after haemotoxic snake venom administration.,https://www.ncbi.nlm.nih.gov/pubmed/30529379,Toxicon : official journal of the International Society on Toxinology,2019 06 05,"The chick chorioallantoic membrane (CAM) is a widely used model in medical research and fulfils the requirements laid out in the 3 R's.

More than 300 different mutations in the SHOX gene responsible for short stature syndrome have been described. The phenotypic expression of SHOX haploinsufficiency is remarkably varied. The 3 typical clinical presentations, from least to most severe, are idiopathic short stature without skeletal malformations, Leri-Weill dyschondrosteosis (LWD), and Langer mesomelic dysplasia, which is believed to represent the homozygous form of LWD. Despite a higher prevalence in women, suggesting the potentiating action of high estrogen levels on the effects of SHOX deficiency, the syndrome was initially believed to have an autosomal pattern of inheritance. In reality, heterozygous SHOX mutations can be transferred from the Y to the X chromosome and vice versa. This phenomenon is called ""the jumping SHOX gene"" and corresponds to a pseudoautosomal dominant inheritance. LWD is characterized by mesomelic short stature and Madelung deformity defined by an upward and medial displacement of the radial joint surface, which restricts range of motion. Less specific dysmorphic signs associated with LWD, such as short hands and feet, scoliosis, or muscular hypertrophy, have been described. When reviewing the dental and maxillofacial signs, only limited and summary data (micrognathia and high arched palate) have been published in the literature.

Deficits in this executive function have been associated with a variety of brain disorders, and it has been shown to rely on various concomitant neurobiological mechanisms. However, the involvement of the glutamatergic system in general, and NMDA receptors in particular, has been debated. Therefore, we injected C57BL/6 mice repeatedly with low-doses of the non-competitive NMDA receptor antagonist MK-801 (dizocilpine, 0.1 mg/kg, i.p.). Reversal learning and the use of specific cognitive strategies were assessed in a non-spatial discrimination touchscreen task and the Morris water maze (MWM) spatial learning task. In addition, mice were subjected to a non-mnemonic test battery. Although initial acquisition learning was not affected by MK-801 administration, it did induce deficits in reversal learning, both in the non-spatial and spatial task. Defects in non-spatial reversal learning appeared to be caused by perseverative errors. Also, MK-801 administration induced perseverative behaviours as well as inefficient spatial strategy use during MWM reversal learning. These effects could not be reduced to changes in exploratory (anxiety-related) behaviours, nor to motor deficits. This was consistent with results in the non-mnemonic test battery, during which MK-801 evoked hyperlocomotion and subtle motor defects, but failed to alter general motor activity and exploratory behaviours. In conclusion, NMDA receptors appear to be involved in the flexible cognitive processes that underlie reversal learning in spatial as well as non-spatial tasks. Our results also indicate that reversal learning as well as the use of cognitively demanding strategies are more sensitive to NMDA receptor blockage than some other functions that have been suggested to be NMDA receptor dependent.",A Functional Immune System Is Required for the Systemic Genotoxic Effects of Localized Irradiation.,https://www.ncbi.nlm.nih.gov/pubmed/30529375,"International journal of radiation oncology, biology, physics",2019 03 22,"Nontargeted effects of ionizing radiation, by which unirradiated cells and tissues are also damaged, are a relatively new paradigm in radiobiology.

However, the impact of acute mental stress on endothelial function in the context of clinical depression is unknown. This study examined the impact of acute mental stress on FMD in women with a diagnosis of a depressive disorder. Forty-three otherwise healthy women (33 ± 14 years) participated. Brachial artery diameter and blood velocity were assessed with ultrasound. FMD was assessed immediately prior to and 15 min following the Trier Social Stress Test (TSST). The FMD protocol included 5 min of forearm cuff occlusion (pressure = 250 mm Hg), followed by release. Shear stress was estimated by calculating shear rate (SR = brachial artery blood velocity/diameter). Stress reactivity was assessed via changes in mean arterial pressure (MAP), heart rate (HR) and salivary cortisol. Results are mean ± SD. A significant stress response was elicited by the TSST [MAP, HR and salivary cortisol increased (p < 0.05)]. Neither the SR stimulus nor FMD response differed pre-versus post-stress (p = 0.124 and p = 0.641, respectively). There was a modest negative correlation between cortisol reactivity and change in FMD from pre- to post-stress (R = -0.392, p = 0.011). To conclude, acute mental stress did not consistently impair endothelial function in women diagnosed with a depressive disorder; however, higher cortisol reactivity may increase the likelihood of post-stress endothelial dysfunction. Further research is required to better understand the factors influencing the relationship between acute mental stress, cortisol and endothelial function in women with depression.",Clinical evidence for the immunogenicity and immune persistence of vaccination with yellow fever virus strain 17D in Chinese peacekeepers deployed to Africa.,https://www.ncbi.nlm.nih.gov/pubmed/30529359,Antiviral research,2019 01 28,"Yellow fever is a serious disease caused by infection with the yellow fever virus (YFV). A live-attenuated YFV vaccine strain, 17D (YFV-17D) is the only virus strain available for the production of the YFV vaccine. This study evaluated the immunogenicity and immune persistence of vaccination with YFV-17D and identified their influencing factors in Chinese peacekeepers deployed to Africa. Serum specimens were collected before and ≥21 days after primary vaccination with YFV-17D in 349 Chinese peacekeepers who were subsequently deployed to Africa for the first time from 2016 to 2017 (population 1). Serum specimens were collected from 1 to 11 years after vaccination with YFV-17D in 2062 returned Chinese peacekeepers who were deployed to Africa from 2005 to 2015 (population 2). We found that YFV-17D exhibited an excellent protective effect in the Chinese peacekeepers deployed to Africa early following vaccination. In the Chinese peacekeepers one year after vaccination, the serum antibody titer against YFV increased with increasing age at vaccination; in those two or more years after vaccination, the serum antibody titer against YFV decreased over years and was similar to but greater than the minimum protective level 11 years after vaccination. The number of peacekeeping missions exhibited an almost negligible influence on the serum antibody titer against YFV.

According to a recent estimate, the disease burden due to DENV infections is ∼390 million infections per year globally in ∼100 countries including the southern US, Puerto Rico and Hawaii, resulting in nearly ∼25,000 deaths mostly among children. Despite the significant morbidity and mortality that results from DENV infections, there is currently no effective chemotherapeutic treatment for DENV infections. We identified curcumin as an inhibitor of DENV2 NS2B/NS3protease in a previous high-throughput screening (HTS) campaign. We synthesized four analogues of curcumin (curcuminoids) and tested the in vitro protease inhibition activity and inhibition of replication by cell-based assays. The results revealed that curcumin is a weak inhibitor of the viral protease. However, the analogues exhibited more potent inhibition of DENV infectivity in plaque assays suggesting that the cellular pathway(s) required for viral replication and/or assembly are targeted by these compounds. Further analysis shows that inhibition of genes involved in lipid biosynthesis, and of actin polymerization by curcuminoids, are likely to be involved as their mode of action in DENV2-infected cells. Three of the curcumin derivatives possess good selectivity indices (SI) (>10) when compared to the parent curcumin.",Safety and efficacy of hot avulsion as an adjunct to EMR (with videos).,https://www.ncbi.nlm.nih.gov/pubmed/30529357,Gastrointestinal endoscopy,2019 04 22,Excision of all visible neoplastic tissue is the goal of EMR of colorectal laterally spreading tumors.

Such similarities allow the hydrogels to be biocompatible and, as a consequence, they are very attractive to be applied as biomaterials. This study presents a new strategy for developing a biohybrid complex based on a natural/synthetic polymer conjugate as gel type structure enriched with quercetin, which can be a relevant biomaterial for its antimicrobial properties. There are evidenced the preparation possibilities for the natural/synthetic structure as complex gel based on hyaluronic acid conjugated with poly(itaconic anhydride‑co‑3,9‑divinyl‑2,4,8,10‑tetraoxaspiro[5.5] undecane) copolymer decorated with quercetin. The effects of the composition on various properties were assessed. The chemical composition of bioconjugate gels was confirmed by FTIR spectroscopy. It was established that the new gel structures have enhanced swelling capacity and a typical gel-like behavior. The investigations evidenced the gels responsiveness to stimuli and their high elasticity. The new structures were tested as drug delivery systems. The in vitro release shows the dependence of the mechanism of release on the composition of the gels, evidencing a transport behavior which varies from the Fickian to super case II.

The conformational transitions of the studied poly-amino acids in the concentrated PEG solutions depend on the polymerization degree of these homopolypeptides, the size of their side chains, the charge distribution of the side chains, and the crowding agent concentration. The results obtained for poly-amino acids are valid for IDPs having a significant total charge. The overcrowded conditions promote a significant increase in the cooperativity of the pH-induced coil-α-helix transition of ProTα and provoke histone H1 aggregation. The most favorable conditions for the pH-induced structural transitions in concentrated PEG solutions are realized when the charged residues are grouped in blocks, and when the distance between the end of the side group carrying charge and the backbone is small. Therefore, the block-wise distribution of charged residues within the IDPs not only plays an important role in the liquid-liquid phase transitions, but may also define the expressivity of structural transitions of these proteins in the overcrowded conditions of the membrane-less organelles.",Physicochemical properties of polysaccharides separated from Camellia oleifera Abel seed cake and its hypoglycemic activity on streptozotocin-induced diabetic mice.,https://www.ncbi.nlm.nih.gov/pubmed/30529353,International journal of biological macromolecules,2019 05 20,"Two homogeneous polysaccharide fractions named SCP-1 (7.16 × 106 Da) and SCP-2 (2.00 × 104 Da) were purified by DEAE-52 cellulose and Sephadex G-200 column chromatography successively from Camellia oleifera Abel seed cake. They were characterized by Fourier transformed infrared (FT-IR), high performance liquid chromatography (HPLC), nuclear magnetic resonance (NMR) spectroscopy and differential scanning calorimetry (DSC). The monosaccharide compositions of SCP-1 were d‑mannose, d‑glucose and l‑xylose with a molar ratio of 1.77:0.93:1 and that of the SCP-2 were d‑mannose, l‑rhamnose, d‑glucose and l‑xylose with a molar ratio of 5.27:1.21:0.16:1. Animal experiments suggested that the plasma glucose levels in hyperglycemia mice were reduced by 11.34%, 30.70%, 46.83% after administration of high, medium and low doses of SCP-1, and reduced by 16.67%, 23.93% and 33.00% after administration of high, medium and low doses of SCP-2, respectively. SCP-1 and SCP-2 also increased the activities of glutathione peroxidase (GSH-Px), catalase (CAT) and superoxide dismutase (SOD), as well as decreased the content of malondialdehyde (MDA) in the hyperglycemia mice. These results suggested that SCP-1 and SCP-2 possessed strong hypoglycemic activities in streptozotocin-induced model mice. In addition, the hypoglycemic activity of SCP-1 was stronger than that of SCP-2.",Silver nanoparticles in situ synthesized by polysaccharides from Sanghuangporus sanghuang and composites with chitosan to prepare scaffolds for the regeneration of infected full-thickness skin defects.,https://www.ncbi.nlm.nih.gov/pubmed/30529352,International journal of biological macromolecules,2019 05 16,"In recent years, silver nanoparticles have widely been used in antibacterial dressings to solve antibiotic resistance problems. However, traditional methods for reducing silver nanoparticles are usually toxic. To overcome this problem, Sanghuangporus sanghuang polysaccharides (FSHPs) were used as a green reducing agent to prepare silver nanoparticles (AgNPs) with a size of 3-35 nm. The FSHPs‑silver nanoparticles (FSHPs-Ag) composite with chitosan solution were then freeze-dried to obtain a porous sponge dressing of chitosan-FSHPs-Ag (CS-FSHPs-Ag). The internal pores of CS-FSHPs-Ag were between 50 and 100 μm and had good swelling and water retention properties, which could provide a moist environment for wounds. Based on the experimental results, the appropriate concentration of AgNPs required for CS-FSHPs-Ag to inhibit Escherichia coli and Staphylococcus aureus was determined. Moreover, there was no statistically significant difference between the material treatment and the blank control group, indicating that the material almost showed no toxicity to L929 cells. Finally, this material was used for dressing animal wounds. The results showed that the CS-FSHPs-Ag promoted wound contraction and internal tissue growth better than the wounds treated with Aquacel® Ag, which indicated that the CS-FSHPs-Ag has a great potential as an ideal wound dressing material.",Study on preparation and physicochemical properties of hydroxypropylated starch with different degree of substitution under microwave assistance.,https://www.ncbi.nlm.nih.gov/pubmed/30529351,International journal of biological macromolecules,2019 05 21,"Compared with the traditional method, the microwave assisted method can greatly shorten the reaction time of hydroxypropyl starch and improve product quality. The microwave assisted conditions and physicochemical properties of natural corn starch were studied.

The optimum parameters were as follows: the additive amount of propylene oxide was 8%, the radiation time was 6.08 min, and the microwave power was 303.43 W. The optimal degree of substitution (DS) of hydroxypropyl starch was determined by the optimal conditions predicted by RSM, which was 0.0729 mg/g.

Fourier transform infrared spectroscopy showed that the enhancement of peak intensity at 1149 cm-1 indicated the successful introduction of hydroxypropyl group. Scanning electron microscopy showed that the surface morphology of corn starch was affected to some extent. The modification did not change the crystalline type of starch, which was still A type."

Expressed reasons for participation are often delayed outcomes i.e. health threats and benefits, but also enjoyment. However, we do not know how people evaluate exercise as a reward. The value of rewards diminish the longer we have to wait for them and the discounting effect can undermine decision-making. Here, we investigated delay-discounting of exercise perception and its valuation with time delays; we conducted self-paced exercise sessions on treadmill and compared the discounting rates of exercise (kex) with those of established rewards of food (kfo) and money (km). Outcomes show, that young, moderately active participants (n = 70) preferred walking/running intensity with low to moderate cardiovascular strain and light perceived exertion. Delay discounting rates (k) indicated that exercise was discounted like other consumable rewards at the same rate as food and more rapidly than monetary rewards. Significant associations were detected of kex with preferred speed and with extrinsic exercise motivation. Exercise training (n = 16) reduced kex specifically, not affecting kfo. Our studies show, that participants perceived and discounted self-paced walking/running like a consumable reward. Exercise discounting was quicker in individuals who preferred lower speeds being less physically active and exercise training reduced the decay rate of exercise specifically.",Outcomes after Robotic-assisted Pyeloplasty in Patients Presenting with Pain Versus Nonpain Presenting Symptoms.,https://www.ncbi.nlm.nih.gov/pubmed/30529338,Urology,2019 06 06,To assess the impact of presenting symptom or incidental finding on symptomatic and radiographic outcomes after robotic-assisted pyeloplasty (RAP).,Co-liquefaction of Prosopis juliflora with polyolefin waste for production of high grade liquid hydrocarbons.,https://www.ncbi.nlm.nih.gov/pubmed/30529335,Bioresource technology,2019 01 01,"In this study, co-liquefaction (HTL) of Prosopis juliflora (PJ) biomass with polyolefin waste (PO) was performed to produce bio-oil.

Solid-state anaerobic digestion (SAD) is a high efficiency livestock manure treatment, but the changes in ARGs and microbial communities during SAD are unknown. Therefore, thermophilic SAD (55 °C), mesophilic SAD (35 °C), and liquid anaerobic digestion (35 °C) were conducted to investigate the impacts of SAD on ARGs, mobile genetic elements, and microbial communities. Compared with liquid anaerobic digestion, SAD significantly reduced at least 7/10 ARGs and all of the mobile genetic elements considered, where the total abundance of ARG was 23.7% higher in the thermophilic SAD product than the mesophilic SAD product. Firmicutes and Proteobacteria were the main potential hosts for ARGs, and their decreased abundances were mainly responsible for the reductions in ARGs during SAD.

The variations in the products distribution of cellulose fast pyrolysis, and their dependence on the structure of cellulose, and the temperature of fast pyrolysis were illustrated. Fast pyrolysis of pretreated cellulose yielded more levoglucosan than crystalline cellulose (14.7%) at 300 °C. Nevertheless, the levoglucosan achieved higher yield (64.3%) from crystalline cellulose at 400 °C. At last, a comparison between fast pyrolysis and enzymatic hydrolysis for cellulose saccharifaction was made. Fast pyrolysis was a promising alternative to liberate levoglucosan from cellulose.

Compared with Brij 58 and Triton X-100, Brij 58 most increased the total lipids, with a yield up to 2.84 g/L (extracellular lipid up to 47%). Brij 58 also increased the metabolic flow of acetic acid to lipid accumulation (maximum conversion of 0.54 g/g at 1.0 g/L Brij 58) and limited its conversion to non-lipid biomass (minimum conversion 0.12 g/g at 0.5 g/L Brij 58). The improvement in the proportion of extracellular lipid by tea saponin and Brij 58 was due to changes in cell membrane permeability and improvement of cell membrane fluidity. Triton X-100, having weaker surface activity, promoted release of extracellular lipid and also increased the proportion of polyunsaturated fatty acid (C22:6, docosahexaenoic acid).",Bioethanol production from bamboo with alkali-catalyzed liquid hot water pretreatment.,https://www.ncbi.nlm.nih.gov/pubmed/30529330,Bioresource technology,2019 01 01,"Altering recalcitrant structures of bamboo is essential to obtain high yield of bioethanol via bioconversion process.

The relationship between these changes and substrate digestibility was addressed by separate enzymatic hydrolysis and fermentation (SHF). The results indicated that pretreatments partly removed and degraded hemicelluloses and lignin, reducing yields of substrates and molecular weights of carbohydrates. With the change of cell wall structure, specific surface area of materials increased after LHW pretreatment but decreased with further removal of lignin and hemicellulosic fractions.

We investigated its pumping function by analyzing its photocycle and the effect of amino acid replacements. MrHR can bind I- similar to Cl- but cannot transport it. I--bound MrHR undergoes a photocycle but lacks the intermediates after L, suggesting that, in the Cl--pumping photocycle, Cl- moves to the cytoplasmic (CP) channel during L decay. A photocycle similar to that of the I--bound form was also observed for a mutant of the Asp200 residue, which is superconserved and assumed to be deprotonated in most microbial rhodopsins. This residue is probably close to the Cl--binding site and the protonated Schiff base, in which a chromophore retinal binds to a specific Lys residue. However, the D200N mutation affected neither the Cl--binding affinity nor the absorption spectrum, but completely eliminated the Cl--pumping function. Thus, the Asp200 residue probably protonates in the dark state but deprotonates during the photocycle. Indeed, a H+ release was detected for photolyzed MrHR by using an indium‑tin oxide electrode, which acts as a good time-resolved pH sensor. This H+ release disappeared in the I--bound form of the wild-type and Cl--bound form of the D200N mutant. Thus, Asp200 residue probably deprotonates during L decay and then drives the Cl- movement to the CP channel."

Pituitary fshb and lhb mRNA levels showed a differential expression pattern, fshb mRNA levels increasing significantly from the perinucleolus (PN) to the oil droplet stage (OD) before slightly decreasing (not significantly) in the early vitellogenic stage (EV). A similar trend was observed in relative Fsh protein levels analyzed by slot blot and immunohistochemistry, but this trend was not reflected in the plasma levels of sex steroids. In contrast, pituitary lhb mRNA levels increased significantly from the PN to EV stage. A higher expression of Fsh at both mRNA and protein levels in the pituitary of eels at the OD stage compared to other investigated stages suggests that synthesis of Fsh production in the pituitary may reach a peak at the OD stage. In the ovary, transcript abundances of fshr and lhr gradually increased during previtellogenic follicle growth, but markedly and significantly increased thereafter. Taken together, our data suggest i) that Fsh release may be very limited, or absent, prior to onset of puberty in shortfinned eels and ii) that Lh is not functionally important in this fish during the EV stage.","Induction of sperm hypermotility through membrane progestin receptor alpha (mPRα): A teleost model of rapid, multifaceted, nongenomic progestin signaling.",https://www.ncbi.nlm.nih.gov/pubmed/30529310,General and comparative endocrinology,2019 06 02,"Rapid progestin effects on sperm physiology have been described in a variety of vertebrate species. Here, we briefly review the signaling pathways mediating rapid progestin induction of sperm hypermotility and increased fertility in two teleost species, Atlantic croaker and southern flounder. Acute in vitro treatment of teleost sperm with the progestin hormone, 20β-S, causes activation of progestin membrane receptor alpha (mPRα, or Paqr7) coupled to a stimulatory olfactory G protein (Golf), resulting in increased cAMP and calcium concentrations and hypermotility upon activation in a hyperosmotic medium. Pharmacological tools were used to investigate the involvement of mPRα and several intracellular signaling pathways in the hypermotility response. Evidence was obtained using the specific mPRα agonist, Org OD 02-0, that this progestin action is mediated through mPRα and not through the nuclear PR. The results indicate that progestins induce hypermotility through activation of a membrane adenylyl cyclase (Acy)/cAMP pathway, an epidermal growth factor receptor (Egfr)/Mapkinase pathway, and a Pi3kinase/Akt/phosphodiesterase (Pde) pathway which result in increased sperm calcium concentrations within 10 s. The finding that inhibition of any one of these pathways is sufficient to prevent hypermotility along with the calcium increase suggests that activation of all of them and the associated calcium increase are required for the progestin hypermotility response. On the basis of these findings a model of progestin induction of sperm hypermotility in teleosts is proposed. As teleosts lack CatSper, the model described here is a non-CatSper mediated one and may therefore be applicable to a wide variety of nonmammalian vertebrates.",Therapeutic medications against diabetes: What we have and what we expect.,https://www.ncbi.nlm.nih.gov/pubmed/30529309,Advanced drug delivery reviews,2018 12 17,"Diabetes has become one of the largest global health and economic burdens, with its increased prevalence and high complication ratio. Stable and satisfactory blood glucose control are vital to reduce diabetes-related complications. Therefore, continuous attempts have been made in antidiabetic drugs, treatment routes, and traditional Chinese medicine to achieve better disease control. New antidiabetic drugs and appropriate combinations of these drugs have increased diabetes control significantly. Besides, novel treatment routes including oral antidiabetic peptide delivery, nanocarrier delivery system, implantable drug delivery system are also pivotal for diabetes control, with its greater efficiency, increased bioavailability, decreased toxicity and reduced dosing frequency. Among these new routes, nanotechnology, artificial pancreas and islet cell implantation have shown great potential in diabetes therapy. Traditional Chinese medicine also offer new options for diabetes treatment. Our paper aim to overview these therapeutic methods for diabetes therapy. Proper combinations of these existing anti-diabetic medications and searching for novel routes are both necessary for better diabetes control.",Aggregation-induced emission (AIE) fluorophores as imaging tools to trace the biological fate of nano-based drug delivery systems.,https://www.ncbi.nlm.nih.gov/pubmed/30529308,Advanced drug delivery reviews,2018 12 16,"The vigorous development of nanotechnology has been accompanied by an equally strong interest and research efforts in nano-based drug delivery systems (NDDSs). However, only a few NDDSs have been translated into clinic thus far. One of the important hurdles is the lack of tools to comprehensively and directly trace the biological fate of NDDSs. Recently, aggregation-induced emission (AIE) fluorophores have emerged as attractive bioimaging tools due to flexible controllability, negligible toxicity and superior photostability. Herein, we recapitulate the current advances in the application of AIE fluorophores to monitor NDDSs both in vitro and in vivo. Particularly, we discuss the cellular fates of self-indicating and stimuli-responsive NDDSs with AIE fluorophores. Moreover, we highlight the in vivo application of AIE agents on the long-term tracking of therapeutics and the multi-modal monitoring of diagnostics in NDDSs. Challenges and opportunities in AIE-guided exploration of NDDSs are also discussed in detail.",Molecular imaging of diabetes and diabetic complications: Beyond pancreatic β-cell targeting.,https://www.ncbi.nlm.nih.gov/pubmed/30529307,Advanced drug delivery reviews,2018 12 15,"Diabetes is a chronic non-communicable disease affecting over 400 million people worldwide. Diabetic patients are at a high risk of various complications, such as cardiovascular, renal, and other diseases. The pathogenesis of diabetes (both type 1 and type 2 diabetes) is associated with a functional impairment of pancreatic β-cells. Consequently, most efforts to manage and prevent diabetes have focused on preserving β-cells and their function. Advances in imaging techniques, such as magnetic resonance imaging, magnetic resonance spectroscopy, positron emission tomography, and single-photon-emission computed tomography, have enabled noninvasive and quantitative detection and characterization of the population and function of β-cells in vivo. These advantages aid in defining and monitoring the progress of diabetes and determining the efficacy of anti-diabetic therapies. Beyond β-cell targeting, molecular imaging of biomarkers associated with the development of diabetes, e.g., lymphocyte infiltration, insulitis, and metabolic changes, may also be a promising strategy for early detection of diabetes, monitoring its progression, and occurrence of complications, as well as facilitating exploration of new therapeutic interventions. Moreover, molecular imaging of glucose uptake, production and excretion in specified tissues is critical for understanding the pathogenesis of diabetes. In the current review, we summarize and discuss recent advances in noninvasive imaging technologies for imaging of biomarkers beyond β-cells for early diagnosis of diabetes, investigation of glucose metabolism, and precise diagnosis and monitoring of diabetic complications for better management of diabetic patients.",Strategies for improving diabetic therapy via alternative administration routes that involve stimuli-responsive insulin-delivering systems.,https://www.ncbi.nlm.nih.gov/pubmed/30529306,Advanced drug delivery reviews,2018 12 15,"The encapsulation of insulin in micro- or nanodelivery systems may eliminate the need for frequent subcutaneous injections, improving the quality of life of diabetic patients. Formulations for oral, intranasal, pulmonary, subcutaneous, and transdermal administration have been developed. The use of stimuli-responsive polymeric carriers that can release the encapsulated drug in response to changes of the environmental stimuli or external activation enables the design of less invasive or non-invasive systems for smart insulin delivery from depots in the body. This article will look at strategies for the development of responsive delivery systems and the future meeting of the demands of new modes of insulin delivery.",Engineering lymphocytes with RNAi.,https://www.ncbi.nlm.nih.gov/pubmed/30529305,Advanced drug delivery reviews,2018 12 13,"Lymphocytes are the gatekeepers of the body's immune system and are involved in pathogenesis if their surveillance is stalled by inhibitory molecules or when they act as mediators for viral entry. Engineering lymphocytes in order to restore their functions is an unmet need in immunological disorders, cancer and in lymphotropic viral infections. Recently, the FDA approved several therapeutic antibodies for blocking inhibitory signals on T cells. This has revolutionized the field of solid tumor care, together with chimeric antigen receptor T cell (CAR-T) therapy that did the same for hematological malignancies. RNA interference (RNAi) is a promising approach where gene function can be inhibited in almost all types of cells. However, manipulation of genes in lymphocyte subsets are difficult due to their hard-to-transfect nature and in vivo targeting remains challenging as they are dispersed throughout the body. The ability of RNAi molecules to gain entry into cells is almost impossible without delivery strategy. Nanotechnology approaches are rapidly growing and their impact in the field of drug and gene delivery applications to transport payloads inside cells have been extensively studied. Here we discuss various technologies available for RNAi delivery to lymphocytes. We shed light on the importance of targeting molecules in order to target lymphocytes in vivo. In addition, we discuss recent developments of RNAi delivery to lymphocyte subsets, and detail the potential implication for the future of molecular medicine in leukocytes implicated diseases.",Locoregional irradiation including internal mammary nodal region for left-sided breast cancer after breast conserving surgery: Dosimetric evaluation of 4 techniques.,https://www.ncbi.nlm.nih.gov/pubmed/30529304,Medical dosimetry : official journal of the American Association of Medical Dosimetrists,2018 12 11,"The present study aimed to compare 4 techniques in the planning of locoregional irradiation including internal mammary nodal region for left-sided breast cancer. Ten patients with left-sided breast cancer undergoing breast conservation surgery were enrolled. For each patient, 4 treatment plans were performed: a helical tomotherapy (HT) plan, a volumetric modulated arc therapy (VMAT) plan, a static intensity modulated radiation therapy (IMRT) plan, and a hybrid IMRT plan, designed to encompass the whole breast, internal mammary, and supraclavicular nodal regions. The prescribed dose of radiation was 50 Gy in 25 fractions. The dosimetric parameters of the target and organs at risk, as well as the dose delivery time, were evaluated and compared using an independent-samples t-test. The HT and VMAT plans had the best conformity and homogeneity. For the HT, VMAT, IMRT, and hybrid IMRT plans, the mean conformity index (CI) and homogeneity index (HI) were 0.83, 0.82, 0.8, and 0.77 (p < 0.001); and 1.07, 1.11, 1.14, and 1.14 (p < 0.001), respectively. The corresponding V55 values were 0.3%, 11.4%, 27.02%, and 23.29% (p < 0.001). The Dmean and V20 of the left lung obtained using the HT plan were significantly lower than those of VMAT, IMRT, and hybrid IMRT plans (p = 0.002, p = 0.004). There were no significant differences in D max of LAD descending coronary artery, or the Dmean of the heart among the 4 types of plans. The HT and VMAT plans had a lower dose to other organ at risk (OARs) compared with the IMRT and hybrid IMRT plans. The mean delivery times were 1042 ± 33 seconds, 136 ± 12 seconds, 450 ± 65 seconds, and 451 ± 70 seconds for the HT, VMAT, IMRT, and hybrid IMRT plans, respectively (p < 0.001). For whole breast plus supraclavicular and internal mammary nodal irradiation in left-sided breast cancer, the VMAT technique is recommended considering both the dose distribution and the delivery time. Under circumstances in which dose distribution is a priority, the HT technique is a valid option.",Efficacy of lanthionine-stabilized angiotensin-(1-7) in type I and type II diabetes mouse models.,https://www.ncbi.nlm.nih.gov/pubmed/30529303,Peptides,2019 04 23,"Native angiotensin-(1-7) exerts many therapeutic effects. However, it is rapidly degraded by ACE and other peptidases. This drawback is largely eliminated for lanthionine-stabilized angiotensin-(1-7), termed cAng-(1-7), which is fully resistant to ACE and has strongly increased resistance to other peptidases. Goal of the present study was to test whether cAng-(1-7) has therapeutic activity in diabetes mouse models: in a multiple low dose streptozotocin-induced model of type I diabetes and / or in a db/db model of type II diabetes. In the type I diabetes model cAng-(1-7) caused in an increase in the insulin level of 133% in week 4 (p < 0.001) compared to vehicle, and in the type II diabetes model an increase of 55% of the insulin level in week 8 (p < 0.05) compared to vehicle. cAng-(1-7) reduced blood glucose levels in the type I model by 37% at day 22 (p < 0.001) and in the type II diabetes model by 17% at day 63 of treatment (p < 0.001) and in an oral glucose tolerance test in a type II diabetes model, by 17% at week 4 (p < 0.01). cAng-(1-7) also caused a reduction of glycated hemoglobin levels in the type II diabetes model of 21% in week 6 (p < 0,001). These data are consistent with therapeutic potential of cAng-(1-7) in type I and II diabetes."

The moderating role of Callous-Unemotional and anxiety traits was evaluated. Lower resting heart rate and decreased skin conductance across picture types was associated with ADHD symptoms. Decreased heart rate reactivity to fear and sad stimuli was associated with ADHD and ODD/CD. Corrugator and zygomaticus responses were not associated with ADHD or ODD/CD. Findings are mostly consistent with a fearlessness account of disruptive behavior, and seem to also pertain to ADHD, with intact valence systems. Findings are discussed in light of the significance of identifying common pathogenic mechanisms across traditional diagnostic categories, consistent with trans-diagnostic approaches to the study of psychopathology.",Efficacy and safety of a novel nitric oxide generator for the treatment of neonatal pulmonary hypertension: Experimental and clinical studies.,https://www.ncbi.nlm.nih.gov/pubmed/30529287,Pulmonary pharmacology & therapeutics,2019 04 16,"Persistent pulmonary hypertension of the newborn (PPHN) is a complex pathology resulting from a failure of the post-natal reduction in pulmonary vascular resistance leading to hypoxemia. The standard therapy is inhaled Nitric Oxide (NO) improving oxygenation but its availability is limited, especially in hospitals with restricted financial resources. We evaluated the efficacy and safety of a new device generating NO (TAS + PLUS), in three experimental piglet models of pulmonary hypertension (PH), and we later tested its application in a pilot study of newborn patients suffering from PPHN. Piglets with experimentally induced PH showed a decrease in pulmonary arterial pressure (PAP) after breathing NO. Both acute and chronic exposure of piglets and rats did not cause any adverse effect in blood gas levels and biological parameters. A pilot study including 32 patients suffering from PPHN showed an increase in oxygen saturation (SatO2) and partial pressure of oxygen in arterial blood (PaO2) leading to a decrease of Oxygenation Index (OI) after compassionate treatment with NO from TAS + PLUS device. The device showed effectiveness and safety both in experimental PH and in the clinical setting.

Ubiquitin and ubiquitin-like modifications play an important role in DDR, from signaling DNA damage to mediating DNA repair. In this report, we found that the E3 ligase ring finger protein 126 (RNF126) was recruited to UV laser micro-irradiation-induced stripes in a RNF8-dependent manner. RNF126 directly interacted with and ubiquitinated another E3 ligase, RNF168. Overexpression of wild type RNF126, but not catalytically-inactive mutant RNF126 (CC229/232AA), diminished ubiquitination of H2A histone family member X (H2AX), and subsequent bleomycin-induced focus formation of total ubiquitin FK2, TP53-binding protein 1 (53BP1), and receptor-associated protein 80 (RAP80). Interestingly, both RNF126 overexpression and RNF126 downregulation compromised homologous recombination (HR)-mediated repair of DNA double-strand breaks (DSBs). Taken together, our findings demonstrate that RNF126 negatively regulates RNF168 function in DDR and its appropriate cellular expression levels are essential for HR-mediated DSB repair.",Reference genes for accurate normalization of gene expression in wood-decomposing fungi.,https://www.ncbi.nlm.nih.gov/pubmed/30529285,Fungal genetics and biology : FG & B,2019 04 26,"Wood-decomposing fungi efficiently decompose plant lignocellulose, and there is increasing interest in characterizing and perhaps harnessing the fungal gene regulation strategies that enable wood decomposition. Proper interpretation of these fungal mechanisms relies on accurate quantification of gene expression, demanding reliable internal control genes (ICGs) as references. Commonly used ICGs such as actin, however, fluctuate among wood-decomposing fungi under defined conditions. In this study, by mining RNA-seq data in silico and validating ICGs in vitro using qRT-PCR, we targeted more reliable ICGs for studying transcriptional responses in wood-decomposing fungi, particularly responses to changing environments (e.g., carbon sources, decomposition stages) in various culture conditions. Using the model brown rot fungus Postia placenta in a first-pass study, our mining efforts yielded 15 constitutively-expressed genes robust in variable carbon sources (e.g., no carbon, glucose, cellobiose, aspen) and cultivation stages (e.g., 15 h, 72 h) in submerged cultures. Of these, we found 7 genes as most suitable ICGs. Expression stabilities of these newly selected ICGs were better than commonly used ICGs, analyzed by NormFinder algorithm and qRT-PCR. In a second-pass, multi-species study in solid wood, our RNA-seq mining efforts revealed hundreds of highly constitutively expressed genes among four wood-decomposing fungi with varying nutritional modes (brown rot, white rot), including a shared core set of ICGs numbering 11 genes. Together, the newly selected ICGs highlighted here will increase reliability when studying gene regulatory mechanisms of wood-decomposing fungi.",Mapping Salmonella typhimurium pathways using 13C metabolic flux analysis.,https://www.ncbi.nlm.nih.gov/pubmed/30529284,Metabolic engineering,2019 03 04,"In the last years, Salmonella has been extensively studied not only due to its importance as a pathogen, but also as a host to produce pharmaceutical compounds. However, the full exploitation of Salmonella as a platform for bioproduct delivery has been hampered by the lack of information about its metabolism. Genome-scale metabolic models can be valuable tools to delineate metabolic engineering strategies as long as they closely represent the actual metabolism of the target organism. In the present study, a 13C-MFA approach was applied to map the fluxes at the central carbon pathways of S. typhimurium LT2 growing at glucose-limited chemostat cultures. The experiments were carried out in a 2L bioreactor, using defined medium enriched with 20% 13C-labeled glucose. Metabolic flux distributions in central carbon pathways of S. typhimurium LT2 were estimated using OpenFLUX2 based on the labeling pattern of biomass protein hydrolysates together with biomass composition. The results suggested that pentose phosphate is used to catabolize glucose, with minor fluxes through glycolysis. In silico simulations, using Optflux and pFBA as simulation method, allowed to study the performance of the genome-scale metabolic model. In general, the accuracy of in silico simulations was improved by the superimposition of estimated intracellular fluxes to the existing genome-scale metabolic model, showing a better fitting to the experimental extracellular fluxes, whereas the intracellular fluxes of pentose phosphate and anaplerotic reactions were poorly described.","A steady state system for in vitro evaluation of steroidogenic pathway dynamics: Application for CYP11B1, CYP11B2 and CYP17 inhibitors.",https://www.ncbi.nlm.nih.gov/pubmed/30529282,The Journal of steroid biochemistry and molecular biology,2019 05 21,"Disorders featuring dysregulated adrenal steroidogenesis, such as primary aldosteronism, can benefit from targeted therapies. The aldosterone and cortisol producing enzymes, aldosterone synthase (CYP11B2) and 11-beta-hydroxylase (CYP11B1), share 93% homology requiring selective drugs for pharmacological treatment. Herein, we introduce an effective in vitro assay for evaluation of steroidogenic enzyme kinetics based on intracellular flux calculations. H295RA cells were cultured in chambers under constant medium flow. Four hourly samples were collected (control samples), followed by collections over an additional four hours after treatment with fadrozole (10 nM), metyrapone (10 μM), SI_191 (5 nM), a novel CYP11B2 inhibitor or SI_254 (100 nM), a newly synthesized 17-alpha-hydroxylase/17,20-lyase inhibitor. Mass spectrometric measurements of multiple steroids combined with linear system computational modeling facilitated calculation of intracellular fluxes and changes in rate constants at different steroidogenic pathway steps, enabling selectivity of drugs for those steps to be evaluated. While treatment with fadrozole, metyrapone and SI_191 all reduced fluxes of aldosterone, corticosterone and cortisol production, treatment with SI_254 led to increased flux through the mineralocorticoid pathway and reduced production of steroids downstream of 17-alpha-hydroxylase/17,20-lyase. Drug-induced decreases in rate constants revealed higher selectivity of SI_191 compared to other drugs for CYP11B2 over CYP11B1, this reflecting additional inhibitory actions of SI_191 on catalytic steps of CYP11B2 downstream from the initial 11-beta-hydroxlase step. By culturing cells under perfusion the described system provides a realistic model for simple and rapid calculations of intracellular fluxes and changes in rate constants, thereby offering a robust procedure for investigating drug or other effects at specific steps of steroidogenesis.",Adverse events from large dose vitamin D supplementation taken for one year or longer.,https://www.ncbi.nlm.nih.gov/pubmed/30529281,The Journal of steroid biochemistry and molecular biology,2019 05 21,"In recent years, clinical trials increasingly have given large doses of vitamin D supplements to investigate possible health benefits beyond bone at high 25-hydroxyvitamin D levels. However, there are few publications on the safety of high-dose vitamin D given long term. The study objective was to investigate the cumulative relative risk (RR) of total adverse events, kidney stones, hypercalcemia and hypercalciuria from ≥2800 IU/d vitamin D2 or D3 supplementation, followed for one year or more in randomized controlled trials (RCTs). A systematic review was conducted in Medline Ovid, EMBASE and Cochrane in March 2018 to update results of studies published since a previous review in October 2015. RCTs were included if they gave vitamin D2 or D3 at ≥2800 IU/d for at least one year and reported on total adverse events or at least one calcium-related adverse event. There were a total of 32 studies that met the inclusion criteria. Of these, only 15 studies (3150 participants) reported one or more event of the outcomes of interest. Long-term high-dose vitamin D supplementation did not increase total adverse events compared to placebo in 1731 participants from 10 studies (RR = 1.05; 95% CI = 0.88, 1.24; p = 0.61), nor kidney stones in 1336 participants from 5 studies (RR = 1.26; 95% CI = 0.35, 4.58; p = 0.72). However, there was a trend for vitamin D to increase risk of hypercalcemia in 2598 participants from 10 studies (RR = 1.93; 95% CI = 1.00, 3.73; p = 0.05); while its effect on hypercalciuria in only 276 participants from 3 studies was inconclusive (RR = 1.93; 95% CI = 0.83, 4.46; p = 0.12). In conclusion, one year or longer supplementation with a large daily, weekly or monthly dose of vitamin D2 /D3 did not significantly increase a risk of total adverse events or kidney stones, although there was a trend towards increased hypercalcemia, and possibly for hypercalciuria.",Diagnostic protocols for the detection of Acheta domesticus densovirus (AdDV) in cricket frass.,https://www.ncbi.nlm.nih.gov/pubmed/30529278,Journal of virological methods,2019 04 15,"The European house cricket (Acheta domesticus) is a species of interest for the emerging insect-as-food industry. Acheta domesticus densovirus (AdDV) is a member of the Parvoviridae virus family which infects A. domesticus, causing widespread mortality and even extinction of local cricket populations. Despite the well-known detrimental effects of AdDV in commercial rearing of A. domesticus there are no optimized protocols to accurately and non-destructively detect and quantify the virus. This study establishes a new protocol for the detection of AdDV in faecal material from A.domesticus. The protocol includes methodological improvements, such as upgrading from conventional PCR to quantitative real-time PCR and is much more sensitive than previously published protocols. Moreover, this study shows that cricket faeces are a suitable, non-destructive sample substrate to infer reliably if a cricket population is infected with AdDV or not. Early detection of lethal or economic threats, such as disease-causing viruses, is an essential part of commercial cricket management as well as for monitoring the risk of spread to wild cricket populations or to (human) consumers.",Repetitive transcranial magnetic stimulation promotes functional recovery and differentiation of human neural stem cells in rats after ischemic stroke.,https://www.ncbi.nlm.nih.gov/pubmed/30529277,Experimental neurology,2019 01 22,"Stem cells hold great promise as a regenerative therapy for ischemic stroke by improving functional outcomes in animal models. However, there are some limitations regarding the cell transplantation, including low rate of survival and differentiation. Repetitive transcranial magnetic stimulation (rTMS) has been widely used in clinical trials as post-stroke rehabilitation in ischemic stroke and has shown to alleviate functional deficits following stroke. The present study was designed to evaluate the therapeutic effects and mechanisms of combined human neural stem cells (hNSCs) with rTMS in a middle cerebral artery occlusion (MCAO) rat model. The results showed that human embryonic stem cells (hESCs) were successfully differentiated into forebrain hNSCs for transplantation and hNSCs transplantation combined with rTMS could accelerate the functional recovery after ischemic stroke in rats. Furthermore, this combination not only significantly enhanced neurogenesis and the protein levels of brain-derived neurotrophic factor (BDNF), but also rTMS promoted the neural differentiation of hNSCs. Our findings are presented for the first time to evaluate therapeutic benefits of combined hNSCs and rTMS for functional recovery after ischemic stroke, and indicated that the combination of hNSCs with rTMS might be a potential novel therapeutic target for the treatment of stroke.","The ORMs interact with transmembrane domain 1 of Lcb1 and regulate serine palmitoyltransferase oligomerization, activity and localization.",https://www.ncbi.nlm.nih.gov/pubmed/30529276,Biochimica et biophysica acta. Molecular and cell biology of lipids,2019 02 14,"Serine palmitoyltransferase (SPT), an endoplasmic reticulum-localized membrane enzymecomposed of acatalytic LCB1/LCB2 heterodimer and a small activating subunit (Tsc3 in yeast; ssSPTs in mammals), is negatively regulated by the evolutionarily conserved family of proteins known as the ORMs. In yeast, SPT, the ORMs, and the PI4P phosphatase Sac1, copurify in the ""SPOTs"" complex. However, neither the mechanism of ORM inhibition of SPT nor details of the interactions of the ORMs and Sac1 with SPT are known. Here we report that the first transmembrane domain (TMD1) of Lcb1 is required for ORM binding to SPT. Loss of binding is not due to altered membrane topology of Lcb1 since replacing TMD1 with a heterologous TMD restores membrane topology but not ORM binding. TMD1 deletion also eliminates ORM-dependent formation of SPT oligomers as assessed by co-immunoprecipitation assays and in vivo imaging. Expression of ORMs lacking derepressive phosphorylation sites results in constitutive SPT oligomerization, while phosphomimetic ORMs fail to induce oligomerization under any conditions. Significantly, when LCB1-RFP and LCB1ΔTMD1-GFP were coexpressed, more LCB1ΔTMD1-GFP was in the peripheral ER, suggesting ORM regulation is partially accomplished by SPT redistribution. Tsc3 deletion does not abolish ORM inhibition of SPT, indicating the ORMs do not simply prevent activation by Tsc3. Binding of Sac1 to SPT requires Tsc3, but not the ORMs, and Sac1 does not influence ORM-mediated oligomerization of SPT. Finally, yeast mutants lacking ORM regulation of SPT require the LCB-P lyase Dpl1 to maintain long-chain bases at sublethal levels."

Systemic morphine produced a dose-dependent biphasic change in mechanical nociceptive threshold. At lower doses (0.003-0.03 mg/kg, s.c.) morphine induced mechanical hyperalgesia, while higher doses (1-10 mg/kg, s.c.) induced analgesia. Intrathecal (i.t.) oligodeoxynucleotide (ODN) antisense to mu-opioid receptor (MOR) mRNA, attenuated both hyperalgesia and analgesia. 5 days after systemic morphine (0.03-10 mg/kg s.c.), mechanical hyperalgesia produced by intradermal (i.d.) prostaglandin E2 (PGE2) was prolonged, indicating hyperalgesic priming at the peripheral terminal of the nociceptor. The hyperalgesia induced by i.t. PGE2 (400 ng/10 µl), in groups that received 0.03 (that induced hyperalgesia) or 3 mg/kg (that induced analgesia) morphine, was also prolonged, indicating priming at the central terminal of the nociceptor. The prolongation of the hyperalgesia induced by i.d. or i.t. PGE2, in rats previously treated with either a hyperalgesic (0.03 mg/kg, s.c.) or analgesic (3 mg/kg, s.c.) dose, was reversed by i.d. or i.t. injection of the protein translation inhibitor cordycepin (1 µg), indicative of Type I priming at both terminals. Although pretreatment with MOR antisense had no effect on priming induced by 0.03 mg/kg morphine, it completely prevented priming by 3 mg/kg morphine, in both terminals. Thus, the induction of hyperalgesia, but not priming, by low-dose morphine, is MOR-dependent. In contrast, induction of both hyperalgesia and priming by high-dose morphine is MOR-dependent. The receptor at which low-dose morphine acts to produce priming remains to be established.",RNA-seq Analysis of the SCN1A-KO Model based on CRISPR/Cas9 Genome Editing Technology.,https://www.ncbi.nlm.nih.gov/pubmed/30529264,Neuroscience,2019 03 18,"Dravet syndrome (DS) is a disease that is primarily caused by the inactivation of the SCN1A-encoded voltage-gated sodium channel alpha subunit (Nav1.1). In this study, we constructed an SCN1A gene knockout model using CRISPR/Cas9 genome editing technology to deprive the Nav1.1 function in vitro. With mRNA-seq analysis we found abundant gene changes after SCN1A knockout, which associated with various signaling pathways, such as cancer pathways, the PI3K-AKT signaling pathway, the MAPK signaling pathway, and pathways involved in HTLV-I infection. We also noticed changes in the spliceosome, decreased glycolytic capacity, disturbances in calcium signaling pathways, and changes in the potassium, sodium, chloride, and calcium plasma channels after SCN1A knockout. In this study, we have been the first time to discover these changes and summarize them here and hope it would provide some clue for the study of Nav1.1 in the nervous system.",Consumption and exposure to finished cosmetic products: A systematic review.,https://www.ncbi.nlm.nih.gov/pubmed/30529261,Food and chemical toxicology : an international journal published for the British Industrial Biological Research Association,2019 04 23,"According to the European Regulation (EC) No. 1223/2009, cosmetic products should be safe for human health when used under normal or foreseeable conditions of use.

Hepatic disorders affect the physiological and biochemical functions of the body. These disorders include hepatitis B, hepatitis C, alcoholic liver disease (ALD), nonalcoholic fatty liver disease (NAFLD), liver cirrhosis, hepatic failure and hepatocellular carcinoma (HCC). Drugs related hepatotoxicity is one of the major challenges facing by clinicians as it is a leading cause of liver failure. During post-marketing surveillance studies, detection and reporting of drug-induced hepatotoxicity may lead to drug withdrawal or warnings. Several mechanisms are involved in hepatotoxicity such as cell membrane disruption, initiating an immune response, alteration of cellular pathways of drug metabolism, accumulation of reactive oxygen species (ROS), lipid peroxidation and cell death. Curcumin, the active ingredient of turmeric and exhibits therapeutic potential for the treatment of diabetes, cardiovascular disorders and various types of cancers. Curcumin is strong anti-oxidant and anti-inflammatory effects and thus it possesses hepatoprotective properties. Despite its low bioavailability, its hepatoprotective effects have been studied in various protocols of hepatotoxicity including acetaminophen, alcohol, lindane, carbon tetrachloride (CCL4), diethylnitrosamine and heavy metals induced hepatotoxicities. This report reviews the hepatoprotective effects of curcumin with a focus on its mechanistic insights in various hepatotoxic protocols.",Cabazitaxel-loaded Poly(2-ethylbutyl cyanoacrylate) nanoparticles improve treatment efficacy in a patient derived breast cancer xenograft.,https://www.ncbi.nlm.nih.gov/pubmed/30529259,Journal of controlled release : official journal of the Controlled Release Society,2018 12 25,"The effect of poly(2-ethyl-butyl cyanoacrylate) nanoparticles containing the cytotoxic drug cabazitaxel was studied in three breast cancer cell lines and one basal-like patient-derived xenograft model grown in the mammary fat pad of immunodeficient mice. Nanoparticle-encapsulated cabazitaxel had a much better efficacy than similar concentrations of free drug in the basal-like patient-derived xenograft and resulted in complete remission of 6 out of 8 tumors, whereas free drug gave complete remission only with 2 out of 9 tumors. To investigate the different efficacies obtained with nanoparticle-encapsulated versus free cabazitaxel, mass spectrometry quantification of cabazitaxel was performed in mice plasma and selected tissue samples. Nanoparticle-encapsulated drug had a longer circulation time in blood. There was approximately a three times higher drug concentration in tumor tissue 24 h after injection, and two times higher 96 h after injection of nanoparticles with drug compared to the free drug. The tissue biodistribution obtained after 24 h using mass spectrometry analyses correlates well with biodistribution data obtained using IVIS® Spectrum in vivo imaging of nanoparticles labeled with the fluorescent substance NR668, indicating that these data also are representative for the nanoparticle distribution. Furthermore, immunohistochemistry was used to estimate infiltration of macrophages into the tumor tissue following injection of nanoparticle-encapsulated and free cabazitaxel. The higher infiltration of anti-tumorigenic versus pro-tumorigenic macrophages in tumors treated with the nanoparticles might also contribute to the improved effect obtained with the nanoparticle-encapsulated drug. Tumor infiltration of pro-tumorigenic macrophages was four times lower when using nanoparticles containing cabazitaxel than when using particles without drug, and we speculate that the very good therapeutic efficacy obtained with our cabazitaxel-containing particles may be due to their ability to reduce the level of pro-tumorigenic macrophages in the tumor. In summary, encapsulation of cabazitaxel in poly(2-ethyl-butyl cyanoacrylate) nanoparticles seems promising for treatment of breast cancer.",Incidence of epilepsy and associated factors in elderly patients in Germany.,https://www.ncbi.nlm.nih.gov/pubmed/30529258,Epilepsy & behavior : E&B,2019 04 30,"Little is known about the recent epidemiology of epilepsy in the elderly in Germany.

Periodontitis has been associated with cardiovascular diseases and considered a cardiovascular risk factor. Several mechanisms have been proposed to explain this association, such as the infection of atherosclerotic plaques by periodontal pathogens, the pro-atherogenic effect on the lipid profile, the systemic dissemination of pro-inflammatory mediators or the contribution to type 2 diabetes mellitus. Periodontal treatment has also been related to improvement in cardiometabolic risk variables, and oral hygiene techniques may be useful in reducing cardiometabolic risk.

This research aimed at establishing a new oligonucleotide combination that allows for a better exclusion of dead Legionella pneumophila on basis of the mip gene. Propidium monoazide (PMA) was chosen as viability dye. An oligonucleotide combination for the amplification of a 633 bp sequence was established with 100% specificity for different Legionella pneumophila strains compared with 17 other Legionella species tested. Apart from increasing amplicon length, the study aimed at optimizing dye incubation time and temperature. An incubation temperature of 45 °C for 10 min was found optimal. Dye treatment of heat-killed bacteria in the presence of EDTA improved signal suppression, whereas deoxycholate also affected signals from live intact bacteria. Suppression of signals from heat-treated bacteria was found to be approx. twice as efficient compared to a commercial kit, although the detection sensitivity is superior when targeting short amplicons. With a limit of detection of 10 genome copies per PCR well and a 6-log signal reduction of bacteria killed at 80 °C, the assay appears useful for applications where pathogen numbers are not limiting and where the priority is on the distinction between intact and damaged Legionella pneumophila for the evaluation of hygienic risk and of disinfection efficiency.","Multiplex real-time PCR assays to detect Stenotrophomonas maltophilia carrying sul1, sul2, and sul3 genes.",https://www.ncbi.nlm.nih.gov/pubmed/30529240,Journal of microbiological methods,2019 02 02,"Nosocomial infections caused by Stenotrophomonas maltophilia resistant to SXT are increasingly reported worldwide. In this study, a novel melting-curve based multiplex real-time PCR assay for the simultaneous detection of the ssrA and sul1, sul2 and sul3 genes was first established. The assays were performed on a Roche LightCycler® 480 II system. The results for target and non-target amplification showed that the multiplex real-time PCR assays were specific, the limit of detection for each target was 10 copies per 20 μL reaction volume, the assays were linear over six log dilutions of the target genes (r2 > 0.99), and the Ct values of the coefficients of variation for intra- and interassay reproducibility were <5%. The sensitivity for the target DNA in simulated blood samples was 102 CFU/mL. The multiplex real-time PCR assays showed 100% concordance with conventional PCR when tested against 20 SXT-susceptible and 20 SXT-resistant S. maltophilia from clinical samples. Therefore, the multiplex real-time PCR is a rapid, affordable and sensitive assay for direct detection of the ssrA and sul1, sul2 and sul3 genes.",aMSGE: advanced multiplex site-specific genome engineering with orthogonal modular recombinases in actinomycetes.,https://www.ncbi.nlm.nih.gov/pubmed/30529239,Metabolic engineering,2019 03 04,"Chromosomal integration of genes and pathways is of particular importance for large-scale and long-term fermentation in industrial biotechnology. However, stable, multi-copy integration of long DNA segments (e.g., large gene clusters) remains challenging. Here, we describe a plug-and-play toolkit that allows for high-efficiency, single-step, multi-locus integration of natural product (NP) biosynthetic gene clusters (BGCs) in actinomycetes, based on the innovative concept of ""multiple integrases-multiple attB sites"". This toolkit consists of 27 synthetic modular plasmids, which contain single- or multi-integration modules (from two to four) derived from five orthogonal site-specific recombination (SSR) systems. The multi-integration modules can be readily ligated into plasmids containing large BGCs by Gibson assembly, which can be simultaneously inserted into multiple native attB sites in a single step. We demonstrated the applicability of this toolkit by performing stabilized amplification of acetyl-CoA carboxylase genes to facilitate actinorhodin biosynthesis in Streptomyces coelicolor. Furthermore, using this toolkit, we achieved a 185.6% increase in 5-oxomilbemycin titers (from 2.23 to 6.37 g/L) in Streptomyces hygroscopicus via the multi-locus integration of the entire 5-oxomilbemycin BGC (72 kb) (up to four copies). Compared with previously reported methods, the advanced multiplex site-specific genome engineering (aMSGE) method does not require the introduction of any modifications into host genomes before the amplification of target genes or BGCs, which will drastically simplify and accelerate efforts to improve NP production. Considering that SSR systems are widely distributed in a variety of industrial microbes, this novel technique also promises to be a valuable tool for the enhanced biosynthesis of other high-value bioproducts.",Ontogenesis of human fetal testicular steroidogenesis at early gestational age.,https://www.ncbi.nlm.nih.gov/pubmed/30529237,Steroids,2019 06 13,"The onset of steroidogenesis in human fetal testes (HFT) during the first trimester is poorly investigated. One important unresolved question is the ontogeny of steroidogenic enzymes and formation of steroidogenic pathways in the HFT at early pregnancy. Our aim was to explore steroidogenesis, the expression of steroidogenic enzymes and their maturation in the HFT at gestational weeks (GW) 8-12. Steroids in the HFT were analyzed by gas chromatography/coupled to tandem mass spectrometry. The expression of steroidogenic enzymes in the HFT at GW8-12 was investigated by qPCR, automated Western blotting and immunohistochemistry. We demonstrated that the HFT at GW8-9 produced low level of testosterone via the Δ4 pathway and progesterone was the major steroid found in the testicular tissue. In contrast, more mature Leydig cells from the HFT at GW11-12 synthesized high levels of androgens via the Δ5 pathway. We also observed a significant upregulation of the expression of StAR, CYP11A1, CYP17A1 and its accessory proteins, P450 oxidoreductase (POR) and cytochrome b5 in the HFT at GW11-12 compared to GW8-9. Altogether, our data suggest that that human fetal Leydig cells differentiate rapidly at the end of the first trimester by acquiring capacity to express high levels of steroidogenic enzymes and switch from the Δ4 to the Δ5 pathways to synthesize high levels of androgens due to maturation of the CYP17-POR-b5 complex.",Sporadic short temperature events cannot be neglected in predicting impacts of climate change on small insects.,https://www.ncbi.nlm.nih.gov/pubmed/30529236,Journal of insect physiology,2019 01 06,"Climate warming is characterized by increase in extreme heat events (EHEs). EHEs and mild temperature periods alternate with each other and form complex climate scenarios. Among these scenarios, low-frequency and short-duration extreme heat events during long mild periods (sporadic short EHEs) and low-frequency and short-duration mild periods during long extreme heat events (sporadic short mild periods) commonly occur in nature. The biological effects of these two types of temperature events have not been thoroughly elucidated to date. To clarify the biological effects of these temperature events on organisms, we selected the English grain aphid, a globally important cereal pest, as our model system. We exposed aphids to simulated 24-h diurnal fluctuating temperatures, inserted these events during the wheat growing season and then investigated development, adult longevity, fecundity, survival, and demographic parameters. We found that sporadic short mild periods during a long EHE could improve their life history traits. Increasing the duration of mild periods from 1 day to 2 days did not significantly change their demographic performance. Sporadic short EHEs during a long mild period did not significantly affect vital rates, while increasing the duration of EHEs from 1 day to 2 days worsened the aphids' performance. We found that short mild episodes in the hot season may benefit small insects to buffer long duration heatwaves. We discussed how sporadic short mild periods during a long EHE supplied aphids a chance to recover from heat stress. Thus, we suggest that sporadic temperature events should be considered in population prediction of small insects under climate change and should be integrated into pest management.","Fowl adenovirus 9 ORF19, a lipase homolog, is nonessential for virus replication and is suitable for foreign gene expression.",https://www.ncbi.nlm.nih.gov/pubmed/30529235,Virus research,2019 01 22,"Fowl adenovirus 9 (FAdV-9) has one of the largest genomes (45 kb) so far sequenced from all adenoviruses studied. Genus-specific genes located within the early (E) regions at the right and left ends of the viral genome have unknown functions except for ORF8 (Gam-1 gene), ORF22 and ORF1 (dUTPase gene). ORF19, located at the right end of the genome (nts 34,220-36,443), is predicted to encode a lipase protein and its homologs are also found in all FAdV genomes so far sequenced. The role of ORF19 in virus replication and virulence is unknown. To study ORF19 and explore its potential as a locus for foreign gene insertion, we generated one ORF19-deleted mutant virus (rFAdV-9Δ19-SwaI) and three FAdV-9Δ19-based recombinant viruses replacing ORF19 as follows: rFAdV-9Δ19-CAT and enhanced-green fluorescent protein (EGFP) cassette (CMV promoter-EGFP-poly A) in a rightward (rFAdV-9Δ19-EGFP-R) and leftward orientation (rFAdV-9Δ19-EGFP-L). All recombinant viruses were stable after three passages. In chicken hepatoma cells, rFAdV-9Δ19-SwaI, rFAdV-9Δ19-CAT and rFAdV-9Δ19-EGFP-R replicated at titers similar to that of the wild-type virus, whilst rFAdV-9Δ19-EGFP-L replicated at a much lower titer. Interestingly, FAdV-9Δ19-SwaI replicated at higher titers in cells and in embryonated eggs, respectively than those of wild-type and recombinant viruses. These observations suggest ORF19 is nonessential for replication and can be used as a novel cloning site for engineering FAdV-9-based recombinant viruses and rFAdV-9Δ19-SwaI could be used to determine its role for virus replication in vivo.",Classification of fetal resilience to porcine reproductive and respiratory syndrome (PRRS) based on temporal viral load in late gestation maternal tissues and fetuses.,https://www.ncbi.nlm.nih.gov/pubmed/30529234,Virus research,2019 01 22,"Although porcine reproductive and respiratory syndrome virus (PRRSV) readily crosses the maternal fetal interface (MFI) in third trimester, fetal resilience varies within litters. The aim of this study was to characterize PRRSV-2 concentration in MFI and fetuses at five time points after experimental inoculation of late gestation gilts and use this information to classify potentially resistant, resilient and susceptible fetuses. The secondary objective was to verify the relationship between PRRS viral load and intrauterine growth retardation (IUGR). Three PRRSV-inoculated pregnant gilts and 1 sham-inoculated control were euthanized at five time points in days post infection (DPI; 2, 5, 8, 12, 14). The preservation status of each fetus was determined and MFI samples adjacent to the umbilical stump of each fetus, as well as serum, thymus, umbilical cord and amniotic fluid were collected. Viral load was quantified using probe-based reverse-transcriptase quantitative PCR (RT-qPCR) targeting PRRSV NVSL 97-7895 ORF7. Our result show the MFI was largely PRRSV infected by 2 DPI and virus was first detected in fetal sera and umbilical cord by 5 DPI, and in fetal thymus and amniotic fluid by 8 DPI. This indicates that PRRSV-2 quickly crossed the placenta and traveled toward the fetus via umbilical circulation within one week of the dam's inoculation. Fetal compromise was first observed on 8 DPI and increased progressively through to 14 DPI. However, several factors were associated with fetal resilience. The random forest model identified that 'viral load in fetal thymus' and duration of infection ('DPI') as the most important factors predicting fetal resilience and resistance. Moreover, IUGR fetuses had lower viral load and were less frequently compromised or dead compared to non-IUGR and average cohorts. Understanding the mechanisms of fetal resilience to PRRSV will improve selection strategies for replacement gilts.",Single-cell branching morphogenesis in the Drosophila trachea.,https://www.ncbi.nlm.nih.gov/pubmed/30529233,Developmental biology,2019 05 15,"The terminal cells of the tracheal epithelium in Drosophila melanogaster are one of the few known cell types that undergo subcellular morphogenesis to achieve a stable, branched shape. During the animal's larval stages, the cells repeatedly sprout new cytoplasmic processes. These grow very long, wrapping around target tissues to which the terminal cells adhere, and are hollowed by a gas-filled subcellular tube for oxygen delivery. Our understanding of this ramification process remains rudimentary. This review aims to provide a comprehensive summary of studies on terminal cells to date, and attempts to extrapolate how terminal branches might be formed based on the known genetic and molecular components. Next to this cell-intrinsic branching mechanism, we examine the extrinsic regulation of terminal branching by the target tissue and the animal's environment. Finally, we assess the degree of similarity between the patterns established by the branching programs of terminal cells and other branched cells and tissues from a mathematical and conceptual point of view.",Acute respiratory failure in immunocompromised adults.,https://www.ncbi.nlm.nih.gov/pubmed/30529232,The Lancet. Respiratory medicine,2019 02 02,"Acute respiratory failure occurs in up to half of patients with haematological malignancies and 15% of those with solid tumours or solid organ transplantation. Mortality remains high. Factors associated with mortality include a need for invasive mechanical ventilation, organ dysfunction, older age, frailty or poor performance status, delayed intensive care unit admission, and acute respiratory failure due to an invasive fungal infection or unknown cause. In addition to appropriate antibacterial therapy, initial clinical management aims to restore oxygenation and predict the most probable cause based on variables related to the underlying disease, acute respiratory failure characteristics, and radiographic findings. The cause of acute respiratory failure must then be confirmed using the most efficient, least invasive, and safest diagnostic tests. In patients with acute respiratory failure of undetermined cause, a standardised diagnostic investigation should be done immediately at admission before deciding whether to perform more invasive diagnostic procedures or to start empirical treatments. Collaborative and multidisciplinary clinical and research networks are crucial to improve our understanding of disease pathogenesis and causation and to develop less invasive diagnostic strategies and more targeted treatment options.",Endoplasmic reticulum stress enhances endocytosis in calreticulin deficient cells.,https://www.ncbi.nlm.nih.gov/pubmed/30529231,Biochimica et biophysica acta. Molecular cell research,2019 02 11,"Calreticulin an endoplasmic reticulum (ER) chaperone that is involved in the quality control process and plays an important role as a regulator of intracellular calcium homeostasis. Previously, we illustrated that loss of calreticulin (crt-/-) results in the activation of ubiquitin-proteasome pathway facilitating the increased resistance to apoptosis. Our preliminary data illustrated a significant increase in the endocytosis in the calreticulin knockout mouse embryonic fibroblast cells (crt-/-). Therefore, we hypothesized that the mechanism for this increased endocytosis in the crt-/- cells is due to onset of ER stress. To test this hypothesis, we measured endocytosis in the wild type (wt) and crt-/- cells using uptake of fluorescent dextran and showed a significant increase in the rate of its uptake in crt-/- cells as compared to wt cells. To determine the endocytic pathway involved we examined both clathrin and caveolin-1 dependent endocytosis. Our results illustrated no change in the expression of clathrin heavy chain while there was a significant increase in the expression of caveolin-1 in the crt-/- cells as compared to the wt cells. Furthermore, using shRNA we illustrated that knockdown of clathrin heavy chain had no effect on endocytosis in the crt-/- cells. While knock-down of caveolin-1 significantly reduced endocytosis in the crt-/- cells. Finally, we illustrated that a chemical chaperone, 4‑phenylbutyrate significantly reduced both the endoplasmic reticulum stress and endocytosis in the crt-/- cells. Our data shows for the first time, that ER stress led to enhanced caveolin-1 mediated endocytosis and reversal of ER stress reduces endocytosis."

Infectious diseases,2019 04 02,"HIV-exposed but uninfected (HEU) infants are at an increased risk of many infectious diseases that can contribute to the high mortality seen among HEU children. Maternal immunisation could be a promising strategy to reduce infections in HEU infants. However, very little research has explored the effect of HIV on the immunogenicity and effectiveness of vaccines given during pregnancy. We review the available evidence on maternal immunisation among women living with HIV (WLWH) for all vaccines recommended, considered, or being investigated for routine or risk-based use during pregnancy. Of the 11 vaccines included, only three have been investigated in WLWH. Available evidence suggests that maternal HIV infection limits the immunogenicity of several vaccines, leaving HEU infants more susceptible to infection during their first few months of life. Whether maternal immunisation reduces the infectious morbidity and mortality associated with infectious diseases in HEU children remains unknown. We conclude the Review by identifying future research priorities.",Promising neuroprotective effects of β-caryophyllene against LPS-induced oligodendrocyte toxicity: A mechanistic study.,https://www.ncbi.nlm.nih.gov/pubmed/30529211,Biochemical pharmacology,2019 01 06,"Myelin loss subsequent to oligodendrocyte death has been reported in a variety of myelin-associated disorders such as multiple sclerosis (MS). Lipopolysaccharide (LPS) has been shown to elicit cellular responses in the central nervous system (CNS) and trigger immune infiltrates and glial cells to release a variety of inflammatory cytokines and mediators. LPS-induced oligodendrocytes toxicity may be chosen as an efficient model to evaluate the role of oligodendrocytes in neuroprotective activities of compounds. β-Caryophyllene (BCP) is a selective type 2 cannabinoid (CB2) receptor agonist. However, the mechanisms underlying the anti-inflammatory effects of BCP are not completely understood. On this basis, we aimed to investigate the protective effects of a wide range of BCP concentrations against LPS-induced toxicity in a proliferative oligodendrocyte cell line (OLN-93) and evaluate the possible correlation between BCP concentration and selective modulation of CB2, Nrf2, sphingomyelinase (SMase) and peroxisome proliferator-activated receptors (PPAR)-γ signaling pathways. We found that LPS significantly increases the levels of reactive oxygen species (ROS), nitric oxide (NO) metabolite and tumor necrosis factor (TNF)-α production while decreases the level of GSH. BCP could prevent LPS-induced cytotoxicity and excessive production of NO, ROS, and TNF-α. Also, we demonstrated that BCP's protective effects against LPS-induced oligodendrocytes toxicity were mediated via the CB2 receptor through different pathways including Nrf2/HO-1/anti-oxidant axis, and PPAR-γ, at low (0.2 and 1 µM), and high (10-50 µM) concentrations, respectively. Additionally, we observed that the addition of SMase inhibitors imipramine (IMP) and fluoxetine (FLX) synergistically increased the protective effects of BCP. Finally, BCP at low concentrations exerted promising protective effects that could be considered for the treatment of neurodegenerative disorders such as MS. However, more studies using other models of neurodegenerative diseases should be undertaken to assess different parameters such as the activity or expression of SMase.",Biomimetic nanocomposite based on hydroxyapatite mineralization over chemically modified cellulose nanowhiskers: An active platform for osteoblast proliferation.,https://www.ncbi.nlm.nih.gov/pubmed/30529209,International journal of biological macromolecules,2019 05 21,"Functionalized-cellulose nanowhiskers (CNWs) were obtained and used to improve hydroxyapatite (HAp) growth by the biomimetic method. CNWs were obtained through HCl hydrolysis and then submitted to chemical functionalization with carboxylate or amine groups that can induce selective HAp mineralization efficiently. Functionalized-CNWs were tested against HAp growth through the biomimetic method using a simulated body fluid (SBF) as a medium during 14 and 28 days of mineralization. Both chemical surface nature (bearing carboxylate or amine reactive groups) and contact time with SBF influenced the nucleation and growth of HAp crystals over CNWs surface. Nanocomposites immersed for 28 days showed a higher amount of HAp crystals compared to bare CNWs or the ones immersed for 14 days. Biocompatibility of the nanomaterials immersed for 14 days in SBF was evaluated through cell viability test using pre-osteoblasts (MC3T3-E1). In general, functionalized-CNWs containing HAp crystals deposited through biomimetic method showed promising results, with CNWs bearing amine groups showing a slightly larger biocompatibility compared to the ones bearing carboxylate groups during an incubation period of 24 h.",Identification and characterization of a novel thermostable xylanase from camel rumen metagenome.,https://www.ncbi.nlm.nih.gov/pubmed/30529208,International journal of biological macromolecules,2019 05 31,"Metagenomics has emerged to isolate novel enzymes from the uncultured microbiota in the environment. In this study, the metagenomic data obtained from camel rumen was considered as the potential source of microbial xylanase enzymes with proper activity in extreme conditions. The metagenomic data were assembled and contigs were used for in-silico identification of candidate thermostable enzyme. A novel thermostable xylanase enzyme, named PersiXyn1, with 1146 bp full-length gene which encodes a 381 amino acid protein was identified. Using the DNA template extracted from camel rumen metagenomic samples, the candidate enzyme genes were cloned and expressed in proper E. coli strains. The phylogenetic analysis showed the evolutionary position of PersiXyn1 among the known thermostable xylanases. The results of the CD analysis and determining the secondary structure of the enzyme, confirmed the presence of a high percentage of β-sheets as an important characteristic of thermophilic xylanases. The PersiXyn1 was active at a broad range of pH (6-11) and temperature (25-90 °C). The optimum pH and temperature were 8 and 40 °C respectively, and the enzyme maintained 80% of its maximum activity in the pH 8 and temperature 40 °C for 1 h. The Scanning electron microscope (SEM) micrograph of enzyme treated pulp clearly showed that the effective use of enzymes in fiber separation may reduce the cost of carton paper production. The novelty of this enzyme lies in the fact that it is highly active and stable in a broad range of pH and temperature. This study highlights the potential importance of camel microbiome for discovering novel thermostable enzymes with applications in agriculture and industries.",Bioinspired catecholamine/starch composites as superadsorbent for the environmental remediation.,https://www.ncbi.nlm.nih.gov/pubmed/30529207,International journal of biological macromolecules,2019 05 16,"Focusing on the encouraging properties of starch-based composite materials, starch‑g‑(acrylic acid‑co‑acrylamide) superabsorbent was synthesized using solution polymerization method, and then the catecholamine functional groups were introduced on to pore surface of the absorbent via oxidative polymerization of dopamine (DA).

However, its use is associated with several debilitating adverse effects such as intestinal mucositis (IM) and myelosuppression. Oxidative stress and inflammation are major contributors in the development of mucositis. Diadzein is known for its potent anti-inflammatory and anti-oxidative activities from decades. The present study focused on investigating the effects of diadzein on intestinal mucositis induced by 5-FU by mainly focusing on oxidative stress and inflammatory markers in mice. Mucositis was induced in mice by administration of 5-FU (50 mg/kg, i.p.), once daily for three days and ﻿diadzein (1, 5, 10 mg/kg) was administered once daily for seven days. Diadzein pretreatment was found to reduce the severity of mucosal injury in a dose-dependent manner. Diadzein significantly reversed weight loss, relieved diarrhea, and improved histopathological deformities associated with inflammation. Moreover, diadzein remarkably improved the intestinal wall histopathology by reducing inflammatory mediators infiltration and prevented suppression of﻿ antioxidants (glutathione, glutathione sulfo-transferase, and catalase) by 5-FU administration. Furthermore, nitrite production in intestinal tissue was reduced by diadzein consistent with the observed modulation of inflammatory markers. Additionally, diadzein also improved the amended microflora profile, by reducing the number of pathogenic bacteria and increasing the abundance of probiotics. Taken together, the behavioral, biochemical and histological outcomes of the present study demonstrates that diadzein has significant anti-mucositis properties in 5-FU induced mucositis model, and the attenuative potential of diadzein might be due to inhibition of oxidative stress and inflammatory mediators.",Overexpression of TBL1XR1 confers tumorigenic capability and promotes recurrence of osteosarcoma.,https://www.ncbi.nlm.nih.gov/pubmed/30529193,European journal of pharmacology,2019 05 01,"Osteosarcoma is the most common malignant bone tumor in childhood and adolescence; however, the mechanism of this malignancy remains uncertain. Transducin (beta)-like 1 × -linked receptor 1 (TBL1XR1) plays an important role in controlling the transcriptional switch between gene activation and gene repression. However, the clinical significance and the precise biological function of TBL1XR1 in osteosarcoma remain unclear. In the present study, we revealed that TBL1XR1 is markedly upregulated in osteosarcoma cell lines and tissues, at both the mRNA and protein levels. Overexpression of TBL1XR1 dramatically enhanced, whereas inhibition of TBL1XR1 reduced, the cancer stem cell (CSC)-like phenotype and tumorigenicity of osteosarcoma cells, both in vitro and in vivo. Importantly, TBL1XR1 enhanced the tumorigenicity of osteosarcoma cells via activating STAT3 signaling and TBL1XR1 expression correlated significantly with STAT3 phosphorylation in osteosarcoma. Taken together, our results provide new evidence that TBL1XR1 overexpression induces CSCs-like phenotypes and tumorigenic capability of osteosarcoma and might represent a novel therapeutic target for its treatment.",Targeting the DNA-PK complex: Its rationale use in cancer and HIV-1 infection.,https://www.ncbi.nlm.nih.gov/pubmed/30529192,Biochemical pharmacology,2019 01 26,"The DNA-PK complex is the major component of the predominant mechanism of DSB repair in humans. In addition, this complex is involved in many other processes such as DNA recombination, genome maintenance, apoptosis and transcription regulation. Several studies have linked the decrease of the DNA-PK activity with cancer initiation, due to defects in the repair. On another hand, higher DNA-PK expression and activity have been observed in various other tumor cells and have been linked with a decrease of the efficiency of anti-tumor drugs. It has also been shown that DNA-PK is critical for the integration of the HIV-1 DNA into the cell host genome and promotes replication and transcription of the virus. Targeting this complex makes therefore sense to treat these two pathologies. However, according to the status of HIV-1 replication (active versus latent replication) or to the tumor grade cells (initiation versus metastasis), the way to target this DNA-PK complex might be rather different. In this review, we discuss the importance of DNA-PK complex in two major pathologies i.e. HIV-1 infection and cancer, and the rationale use of therapies aiming to target this complex.",Effects of inorganic nanoparticles on liver fibrosis: Optimizing a double-edged sword for therapeutics.,https://www.ncbi.nlm.nih.gov/pubmed/30529191,Biochemical pharmacology,2019 01 26,"Liver fibrosis is a condition of sustained wound healing in response to chronic liver injury caused by various factors such as viral, cholestatic and inflammatory diseases. Despite significant advances in the understanding of the mechanistic details of fibrosis, therapeutic intervention with the use of anti-fibrotic drugs achieved only marginal efficacy. Among which, pharmacokinetics profile of agents leading to off-targeting and suboptimal distribution are the principal limiting factors. Concurrently, inorganic nanoparticles (NPs) have gained significant recognition in biomedicine, owning to their unique physicochemical properties. Since NPs are known to accumulate in well vascularised organs, the intuitive therapeutic targeting of the liver using engineered NPs seems to be a plausible approach in treating liver fibrosis. However, the application of inorganic NPs also raised concerns of its potential long-term impact to humans. Current literatures have reported both negative risks as well as surprising benefits, thus sparking off a needful discussion about the feasibility of using inorganic NPs in treating liver fibrosis. Inorganic NPs entrapped in the liver may pose health risks, particularly due to their non-biodegradability and potential toxicity when accumulated in undesirable concentrations. This highlighted the need to assess the health risk of using inorganic NPs, and also to establish a framework to evaluate the conditions when the beneficial effects of these NPs would outweigh potential risks. Hence, this review takes a balanced approach on assessing the mechanistic details behind inorganic NP-induced biochemical perturbations, which could either alleviate or worsen liver fibrosis. Consequently, it attempts to chart out possibilities for future directions through optimizing therapeutic outcomes by design.",Innate lymphoid cell sensing of tissue vitality.,https://www.ncbi.nlm.nih.gov/pubmed/30529190,Current opinion in immunology,2019 04 19,"Innate lymphoid cells (ILCs) constitute a heterogeneous population of cytokine-secreting cells that colonize different tissues and are heavily reliant on cytokines and other secreted factors for their development, maintenance and effector functions. Most ILCs are tissue resident and differentiate in non-lymphoid peripheral tissues. As tissue-resident sentinels, ILCs must rapidly identify pathogens or malignancy in an effort to return the tissue to homeostasis. Here we review the mechanisms that ILCs employ to sense cytokines and other potent immunoregulatory factors that promote their development in different tissues as well as the ability to distinguish pathogenic versus healthy tissue microenvironments and highlight the importance of these pathways for human disease.",VIP modulates the ALX/FPR2 receptor axis toward inflammation resolution in a mouse model of bacterial keratitis.,https://www.ncbi.nlm.nih.gov/pubmed/30529189,Prostaglandins & other lipid mediators,2019 04 15,"Vasoactive intestinal peptide (VIP) has been shown to regulate corneal inflammation. Formyl peptide receptor 2 (FPR2) is a transmembrane protein belonging to the GPCR family. Ligands include pro-resolving lipids, lipoxin A4 (LXA4) and resolvin D1 (RvD1). The current study focuses on the effect of VIP regarding the FPR2 receptor axis in improving disease outcome in a mouse model of bacterial keratitis. Infection was induced in C57BL/6 (B6) mice using P. aeruginosa (PA) ATCC 19660. Mice received topical treatment (VIP or PBS) 3× daily after infection. Mean clinical scores, bacterial plate counts, Griess and myeloperoxidase (MPO) assays indicate that topical VIP effectively abrogates the disease response. Findings also reveal that VIP influences FPR2 pathway activation independent of archetypal VIP receptors. Exploring the immunoresolving role of FPR2, its ligand RvD1 and related enzymes (5-LOX, 12/15-LOX), our results suggest a mechanism by which VIP treatment influences the disease response in bacterial keratitis, which could offer a therapeutic point of intervention for enhancing this pro-resolving circuit.","Vitamin D, muscle recovery, sarcopenia, cachexia, and muscle atrophy.",https://www.ncbi.nlm.nih.gov/pubmed/30529188,"Nutrition (Burbank, Los Angeles County, Calif.)",2019 02 16,"The relevance of vitamin D to skeletal muscle metabolism has been highlighted in recent years. The interest arises from the important findings of studies demonstrating multiple effects of vitamin D on this tissue, which can be divided into genomic (direct effects) and non-genomic effects (indirect effects). Another important aspect to be considered in the study of vitamin D and muscle fiber metabolism is related to different expression of vitamin D receptor (VDR), which varies in muscle tissue depending on age, sex, and pathology. The correlation between low circulating levels of vitamin D and muscle metabolism disorders is documented in various contexts, including muscle recovery, atrophy, sarcopenia, and cachexia. The aim of this review was to analyze recent results of both in vitro and in vivo studies to address the relationship between vitamin D and skeletal muscle biology. The words muscle atrophy, muscle hypertrophy, sarcopenia, and cachexia were crossed over with vitamin D in a Pubmed search. All original contributions, along with reviews on the topic, were included, and no publications in the past 10 y were discarded.

This study investigated the uptake of six gold nanoparticles (AuNPs) into the human bronchial epithelial cell line BEAS-2B. The AuNPs studied included colloidal citrate-stabilised AuNPs of 14 nm in diameter; and 14 nm AuNPs conjugated to functional groups via polyethylene glycol (PEG), namely hydroxyl-PEG (POH), carboxyl-PEG (PCOOH), biotin-PEG (PBtn), nitrilotriacetic acid-PEG (PNTA), and azide-PEG (PAZ). Uptake was visualised by dark field microscopy using the CytoViva Hyperspectral Imaging system and after a 2 hour incubation at 37 °C, uptake was observed in cells treated with the citrate-stabilised and PCOOH AuNPs. However, no uptake was observed for the POH, PBtn, PNTA, or PAZ AuNPs, even after 24 h of incubation. An investigation into the energy dependence of uptake of the citrate-stabilised and PCOOH AuNPs showed that uptake was an active process. Cells pre-treated with either chlorpromazine or genistein as endocytosis inhibitors for clathrin- and caveolae-mediated pathways respectively, prior to addition of AuNPs, suggested a caveolae-dependent mechanism of endocytosis. These results further support recent findings on the mechanism of intracellular uptake and localisation and the subsequent toxicity of nanoparticles.",Sulforaphane enriched transcriptome of lung mitochondrial energy metabolism and provided pulmonary injury protection via Nrf2 in mice.,https://www.ncbi.nlm.nih.gov/pubmed/30529165,Toxicology and applied pharmacology,2019 01 14,"Nrf2 is essential to antioxidant response element (ARE)-mediated host defense. Sulforaphane (SFN) is a phytochemical antioxidant known to affect multiple cellular targets including Nrf2-ARE pathway in chemoprevention. However, the role of SFN in non-malignant airway disorders remain unclear. To test if pre-activation of Nrf2-ARE signaling protects lungs from oxidant-induced acute injury, wild-type (Nrf2+/+) and Nrf2-deficient (Nrf2-/-) mice were given SFN orally or as standardized broccoli sprout extract diet (SBE) before hyperoxia or air exposure. Hyperoxia-induced pulmonary injury and oxidation indices were significantly reduced by SFN or SBE in Nrf2+/+ mice but not in Nrf2-/- mice. SFN upregulated a large cluster of basal lung genes that are involved in mitochondrial oxidative phosphorylation, energy metabolism, and cardiovascular protection only in Nrf2+/+ mice. Bioinformatic analysis elucidated ARE-like motifs on these genes. Transcript abundance of the mitochondrial machinery genes remained significantly higher after hyperoxia exposure in SFN-treated Nrf2+/+ mice than in SFN-treated Nrf2-/- mice. Nuclear factor-κB was suggested to be a central molecule in transcriptome networks affected by SFN. Minor improvement of hyperoxia-caused lung histopathology and neutrophilia by SFN in Nrf2-/- mice implies Nrf2-independent or alternate effector mechanisms. In conclusion, SFN is suggested to be as a preventive intervention in a preclinical model of acute lung injury by linking mitochondria and Nrf2. Administration of SFN alleviated acute lung injury-like pathogenesis in a Nrf2-dependent manner. Potential AREs in the SFN-inducible transcriptome for mitochondria bioenergetics provided a new insight into the downstream mechanisms of Nrf2-mediated pulmonary protection.",Association of astragaloside IV-inhibited autophagy and mineralization in vascular smooth muscle cells with lncRNA H19 and DUSP5-mediated ERK signaling.,https://www.ncbi.nlm.nih.gov/pubmed/30529164,Toxicology and applied pharmacology,2019 01 14,"Defective autophagy in vascular smooth muscle cells (VSMCs) is the principal cause of atherosclerosis. This study aimed to investigate the effect of astragaloside IV (AS-IV) on VSMCs autophagy. In vivo, ApoE-/- mice were fed with high-fat diet ad libitum for eight weeks, with or without AS-IV (25 mg/kg, daily). In vitro, human VSMCs were cultured and treated with β-Glycerophosphate (10 mmol/L) and AS-IV (50 μg/ml). VSMCs autophagy, mineralization, expression of p-ERK1/2, p-mTOR, and autophagy-related proteins (LC3 II/I, p62, and Beclin 1) were detected. Increased autophagy and mineralization was observed in VSMCs in thoracic aorta of mice and in in vitro VSMCs model of atherosclerosis. AS-IV administration attenuated the autophagy and mineralization in VSMCs. Reverse expression profiles of H19 and DUSP5 were observed. AS-IV inhibited DUSP5 and autophagy-related proteins and increased expression of H19, level of p-ERK1/2 and p-mTOR. Further, autophagy and mineralization level in VSMCs were in line with DUSP5 expression level, but in contrast to H19, p-ERK1/2, and p-mTOR profiles. We demonstrated that AS-IV could attenuate autophagy and mineralization of VSMCs in atherosclerosis, which may be associated with H19 overexpression and DUSP5 inhibition.",Bone loss in MPTP mouse model of Parkinson's disease is triggered by decreased osteoblastogenesis and increased osteoclastogenesis.,https://www.ncbi.nlm.nih.gov/pubmed/30529163,Toxicology and applied pharmacology,2019 01 01,"Bone loss is a non-motor symptom of Parkinson's disease (PD). It is unclear whether a patient's immobility or the endocrine changes in the body causes bone deterioration. To address this issue, we used an animal model of the disease where Swiss albino mice were injected with 1-methyl-4-phenyl-1,2,3,6-tetrahydropyridine (MPTP) on day 1 and were left untreated for eight weeks. Behavioral phenotypes of PD, and striatal acetylcholinesterase and dopamine levels were measured. Cortical and trabecular bones were assessed by μ-CT and histology. Gene expression studies were done through quantitative real-time PCR. Effect of MPP+ and MPTP-treated mice serum on MC3T3E-1, SH-SY5Y, and primary osteoclast cells were also studied. Our results demonstrated that MPTP treatment leads to PD like symptoms. It shows a loss of trabecular bone mass and quality by decreasing osteoblast and increased osteoclast number and activity. This effect was accompanied by reduced osteogenic and elevated osteoclastogenic genes expression. While MPP+ had a cytotoxic effect on dopaminergic neurons, it did not affect bone cells. However, ex-vivo treatment of the serum from MPTP-treated mice decreased osteoblastogenesis and increased osteoclastogenesis in cell culture. In conclusion, our study suggests that MPTP-induced parkinsonian features in mice leads to trabecular bone loss by decreased bone formation and increased bone resorption due to changes in the serum circulating factors. This study characterizes the microarchitectural and cellular changes in the skeleton of a mouse model of PD that can be further utilized to investigate therapeutic avenues to treat bone loss in PD patients.",Localization of the Metastatic Site Within a Lymph Node Using Endobronchial Elastography.,https://www.ncbi.nlm.nih.gov/pubmed/30529162,Seminars in thoracic and cardiovascular surgery,2019 05 18,"Endobronchial elastography is a novel imaging technology which visualizes the relative stiffness of the targeted tissue.

During nodal staging using endosonographic technology, a false negative result was known as a limitation of needle biopsy modality that could be caused by the micrometastasis within the lymph node. We report the identification of mediastinal lymph node metastasis in a patient with squamous cell carcinoma by visualization of the metastatic site using endobronchial elastography.",True Lumen Stabilization to Overcome Malperfusion in Acute Type I Aortic Dissection.,https://www.ncbi.nlm.nih.gov/pubmed/30529161,Seminars in thoracic and cardiovascular surgery,2019 01 05,"Acute type I aortic dissection (AD) complicated by true lumen (TL) collapse and malperfusion downstream is associated with devastating prognosis. The study reports an institutional mid-term experience with TL stabilization by uncovered stents to restore perfusion as a supplement to proximal thoracic aortic surgery. Between January 2007 and May 2017, 181 out of 270 acute type A AD patients were operated on type I AD. Eighteen uncovered stents (10%) were used to expand the aortic TL in presence of visceral and/or peripheral malperfusion. The procedures took place in a hybrid operating room and were combined with proximal aortic surgery. During follow-up (mean ± standard deviation 3.44 ± 2.1 years), the fate of AD was evaluated by computed tomography. Indication for TL stenting included visceral (44%) or peripheral malperfusion (11%) or both (45%). Stenting of aortic branches followed in 33%. All patients underwent proximal repair and were combined with frozen elephant trunk (67%) or retrograde descending aorta stent grafting (11%). Thirty-day mortality was 16.7%. Two-year survival was 71.8%. The false lumen around the uncovered stents remained patent in 89% and the aortic diameter increased 0.1 cm/y. No intimal rupture or occlusion of arteries occurred. In 1 patient, the stented aortic lumen was visualized after 6.3 years and neointima ingrowth covering the nitinol frame was found. In acute type I AD, combined endovascular-surgical procedures in a hybrid operation room setting can be used safely to resolve distal malperfusion. Encapsulation of uncovered stents within the intimal wall provides a stable fundament for endovascular techniques to close entry tears and false lumen.",Resection of Kommerell Diverticulum and Reimplantation of Aberrant Left Subclavian Artery in Right Aortic Arch Vascular Ring.,https://www.ncbi.nlm.nih.gov/pubmed/30529160,Seminars in thoracic and cardiovascular surgery,2019 01 18,"A right aortic arch vascular ring consists of an anomalous aortic arch course with a ligamentum arteriosum and an aberrant left subclavian artery arising from a Kommerell diverticulum. Division of the ligamentum arteriosum is required for the relief of symptoms in these patients. However, to prevent recurrent symptoms, resection of the Kommerell diverticulum and reimplantation of the subclavian artery to the left carotid artery is advocated. Here we describe our standardized surgical approach to this pathology.",Esophagectomy Surgical Apgar Score May Not Be Associated With Postoperative Morbidity.,https://www.ncbi.nlm.nih.gov/pubmed/30529159,Seminars in thoracic and cardiovascular surgery,2019 01 06,"This study was performed to investigate the association between the esophagectomy surgical Apgar score (eSAS) and 30-day morbidity after esophagectomy. We retrospectively identified patients who underwent esophagectomy in our facilities database from January 2011 through December 2015. We calculated the eSAS and modified eSAS, which was adjusted for the blood loss volume, according to our patients' data. After estimating the cut-off point of the eSAS using a receiver operating curve, the morbidity rates between the 2 groups were compared using Fisher's exact test. In addition, logistic regression analysis was performed to adjust the results by factors associated with morbidity. In total, 246 patients were included. Of these patients, 144 presented with major morbidity. The optimal cut-off value of the eSAS was 4 points. A total of 145 patients had an eSAS of <4 points, and 89 of them developed morbidity. A total of 101 patients had an eSAS of ≥4 points, and 55 of them developed morbidity. Fisher's exact test showed that an eSAS of <4 points was not significantly associated with morbidity after esophagectomy (P = 0.29). The association was improved after modification for the blood loss volume (P = 0.004). Multivariable analysis revealed that the modified eSAS and age were significantly associated with morbidity (odds ratio, 0.47 and 1.04, respectively). The validity of the eSAS to predict morbidity after esophagectomy could be low, and the modified blood loss volume may improve the predictive effect.",Comparison of Survival After Aortic Valve Replacement With Mitroflow or Perimount Prostheses.,https://www.ncbi.nlm.nih.gov/pubmed/30529158,Seminars in thoracic and cardiovascular surgery,2019 01 11,"Bioprosthetic aortic valves degenerate over time, and differences between brands could be expected. We compared 2 brands implanted in 3 different centers serving 3.3 million people. Between 2000 and 2014, we identified 1241 bioprosthetic aortic valve replacements using Mitroflow (Sorin, Milan, Italy) and 3212 using Perimount (Edwards Lifesciences, Irvine, CA) covering 88% of all aortic valve replacements in the region. Average differences in t-year mortality were derived from Cox regression. The complete case analyses included 881 Mitroflow replacements and 2488 Perimount replacements. The median follow-up time and 25/75 percentiles were 5.0 years (3.3-7.2) and 8.4 years (5.1-10.6) for Perimount and Mitroflow, respectively. Multiple Cox regression analyses demonstrated significantly higher mortality with Mitroflow valves compared with Perimount (hazard ratio 1.27; 95% CI: 1.1-1.5; P < 0.001). Average risk of death within 5 years was 25.0% with Mitroflow and 20.4% with Perimount. Average difference in 5-year mortality based on Cox regression was 4.60% in favor of Perimount (95% CI: 1.02-8.02%; P = 0.01) and the number needed to harm was 21.9 (95% CI: 12.7-80.5) within 5 years. Propensity matching confirmed 2-year survival differences 4.6% in favor of Perimount (95% CI: 1.2-7.9%; P = 0.004), and further confirmed in a series of subgroups and a double robust analysis that takes into account both propensity for treatment and covariate relation to outcome.

Despite major advances in analgesia, patients still experience severe shoulder, central back and surgical incision site pain in the postoperative period. This study aimed to assess whether intraoperative phrenic nerve infiltration reduces the incidence of postoperative pain and improves peak flow volume measurements during incentive spirometry. 90 patients undergoing open lobectomy were randomly assigned to have phrenic nerve infiltration (n = 46) or not (n = 44). The phrenic nerve infiltration group received 10 mL of 0.25% bupivacaine into the periphrenic fat pad. Preoperative assessments of spirometry and pain scores were recorded (at rest and with movement). Postoperative assessments included peak flow and pain measurements at intervals up to 72 hours. Less shoulder pain was experienced with phrenic nerve infiltration up to 6 hours postsurgery at rest (P = 0.005) and up to 12 hours with movement (P < 0.001). Reduced back pain was reported in the phrenic nerve infiltration group up to 6 hours after surgery both at rest (P = 0.001) and with movement (P = 0.00). Phrenic nerve infiltration reduced pain at the incision site for up to 3 hours both at rest (P < 0.001) and with movement (P = 0.001). Spirometry readings dropped in both groups with consistently lower readings at baseline and follow-up in the PNI group (P = 0.007). Lower analgesic usage of patient controlled analgesia morphine (P < 0.0001), epipleural bupivacaine (P = 0.001), and oramorph/zomorph (P = 0.0002) were recorded. Our findings indicate that the use of phrenic nerve infiltration significantly reduced patient pain scores during the early postoperative period, particularly during movement. We believe that each technique has advantages and disadvantages; however, further studies with large sample size are warranted."

Molecular basis of disease,2018 12 28,"Increasing evidence shows that the endoplasmic reticulum (ER) stress is an early event that injures pancreatic acinar cells and contributes to the pathogenesis of acute pancreatitis. In the present work we sought to establish whether atrial natriuretic peptide (ANP) alleviated ER stress in rats with cerulein-induced pancreatitis. The major components of the unfolded protein response (UPR) and their downstream effectors were assessed by immunoblotting or fluorimetry and the ultrastructure of ER evaluated by electron transmission microscopy. Cross-talk with autophagy was evaluated by beclin-1 expression. ANP reduced binding immunoglobulin protein (Bip) expression (UPR major controller) which under non-stress conditions keeps inactive the stress sensor proteins: protein kinase-like ER kinase (PERK), inositol-requiring enzyme-1 (IRE1) and activating transcription factor 6 (ATF6). Although ANP did not change PERK expression it decreased p-eIF2α and enhanced downstream effector CHOP, suggesting that ANP stimulates ER-dependent apoptosis. In accordance, ANP also decreased Bcl2 expression and enhanced proapoptotic proteins Bax and Bak. The atrial peptide enhanced ATF6 expression and although it did not affect IRE1/sXBP1 signaling, it increased caspase-2 activity, also involved in ER-dependent apoptosis. Furthermore, ANP decreased beclin-1 expression. The ultrastructure of the RE revealed decreased swelling and conserved ribosomes in the presence of ANP. Present findings support that ANP alleviates ER stress in acute pancreatitis by modulating the three branches of the UPR and stimulates ER-dependent apoptosis. Gaining insights into the modulation of ER stress may help to develop specific therapeutic strategies for acute pancreatitis and/or medical interventions at risk of its developing like endoscopic retrograde cholangiopancreatography.",Methodological issues in a prospective study on plasma concentrations of persistent organic pollutants and pancreatic cancer risk within the EPIC cohort.,https://www.ncbi.nlm.nih.gov/pubmed/30529143,Environmental research,2019 01 25,"The use of biomarkers of environmental exposure to explore new risk factors for pancreatic cancer presents clinical, logistic, and methodological challenges that are also relevant in research on other complex diseases.",Drinking water lead and socioeconomic factors as predictors of blood lead levels in New Jersey's children between two time periods.,https://www.ncbi.nlm.nih.gov/pubmed/30529142,Environmental research,2019 01 25,"As blood lead levels have decreased over time, the relative contributions of alternative lead sources warrant further examination. Much attention has been paid to the relative contribution of lead in drinking water, particularly after the discovery of contaminated drinking water in Flint, Michigan which has also renewed interest in the persistent socioeconomic and racial disparities in children's exposure to lead. As the environmental sources of lead exposure are shifting in importance over time, we decided to examine how demographic, socioeconomic, and environmental factors may confound or interact with each other, and whether these relationships have changed over time. The study population included all New Jersey resident children aged 6-26 months with at least one blood lead specimen collected between 2000 and 2004 (n = 288,758) or 2010 and 2014 (n = 326,530). Reported 90th percentile water lead data (in parts per billion) was summarized annually for each water system statewide. Children's blood lead levels have decreased over time from a statewide geometric mean of 2.47 µg/dL (95% CI 2.46, 2.48) between 2000 and 2004 to 1.57 µg/dL (95% CI 1.57, 1.57) between 2010 and 2014. Individual-level factors of child's age and season of blood draw and area-based measures of race, older housing, and poverty were predictors of children's blood lead levels. Conclusions regarding area-based measure of Hispanic ethnicity are limited and require further research. The narrow range and low levels of area-based lead concentrations in drinking water limits the ability to detect associations with blood lead levels. Racial disparities in blood lead continue to persist but economic disparities may be narrowing as blood lead concentrations continue to decline.",Exposure to phthalates in couples undergoing in vitro fertilization treatment and its association with oxidative stress and DNA damage.,https://www.ncbi.nlm.nih.gov/pubmed/30529141,Environmental research,2019 01 25,"This prospective study of 599 couples seeking fertility treatment and who were recruited between 2015 and 2017 was conducted to (a) explore the associations between phthalate exposure and in vitro fertilization (IVF) outcomes; and (b) examine the implication of oxidative stress as a mediator of these. We measured eight phthalate metabolites in two spot urine samples; oxidative stress biomarkers such as malondialdehyde, 8-hydroxy-2-deoxyguanosine, hydrogen peroxide, catalase (CAT), and total antioxidant capacity in follicular fluid and seminal plasma. We also examined DNA damage in sperm and granulosa cells. Couples were exposed to a broad range of phthalate compounds and seven metabolites were detected in over 94% of the urine samples, whereas monobenzyl phthalate was found in only 24% of women and 26% of men. Our results showed high levels of seven urinary phthalate metabolites (except monobenzyl phthalate) and a notable increase in many oxidative stress markers in both follicular fluid and seminal plasma. However, their associations with exposure were rather limited. Multivariate binomial regression modeling showed higher levels of follicular CAT levels reduced the probability of fertilization rate (≤ 50%) [Adjusted relative risk (RRadj) = 0.52, p = 0.005] and unsuccessful live birth (RRadj = 0.592, p = 0.023). We observed a 46% decrease in the probability of clinical pregnancy in association with an elevated percentage of DNA in the tail (RRadj = 0.536, p = 0.04). There was a 32% and 22% increase in the probability of clinical pregnancy and unsuccessful live birth associated with higher levels of mono-(2-ethylhexyl) phthalate (RRadj = 1.32, p = 0.049) and monoethyl phthalate (RRadj = 1.22, p = 0.032) in women, respectively. In contrast, the probability of clinical pregnancy reduced by 20% with higher levels of mono-(2-ethyl-5-carboxypentyl) phthalate (RRadj = 0.797, p = 0.037) and 19.6% with mono-(2-ethyl-5-oxohexyl) phthalate (MEOHP) (RRadj = 0.804, p = 0.041) in men. Other oxidative stress biomarkers or urinary phthalate metabolites showed suggestive relationships with certain IVF outcomes. Lastly, our results demonstrated that elevated levels of CAT in follicular fluid might have a positive impact on fertilization rate ≥ 50% and successful live birth. CAT seems to play a potential role in mediating the relationship between the risk of poor fertilization rate and MEOHP and mono-isobutyl phthalate. Additional data are required to understand the clinical implications of oxidative stress and its contribution to the reproductive toxicity of phthalate exposure.","Effect of body length, trophic position and habitat use on mercury concentrations of sharks from contrasted ecosystems in the southwestern Indian Ocean.",https://www.ncbi.nlm.nih.gov/pubmed/30529140,Environmental research,2019 01 25,"The non-essential metal mercury (Hg) can have deleterious effects on health of organisms, and tends to bioaccumulate with age in long-lived organisms and to biomagnify along food webs. Because elasmobranchs are fished for human consumption and their Hg levels are frequently above the maximum Hg concentration recommended for fish consumption, understanding the drivers of Hg concentration is of considerable interest. Total Hg concentrations were analysed in muscle tissues of 14 shark and 2 batoid species (n = 339 individuals) sampled across multiple habitats (coastal, open ocean and bathyal) in the southwestern Indian Ocean. Stable isotope ratios of carbon (δ13C) and nitrogen (δ15N) were analysed to assess whether relative trophic position and foraging habitats affected Hg concentrations. Hg concentrations increased with δ15N and body length, highlighting the mechanisms of bioaccumulation and biomagnification in relation with the trophic position and size of the individuals. Habitats where elasmobranchs were collected also affected their Hg concentrations. Bathyal sharks had high Hg concentrations that were almost similar to those of oceanic species, despite their lower relative trophic position. Higher bioavailability of Hg due to its enhanced methylation in deeper waters was considered as the most likely explanation for this result. These results highlight that multiple factors contribute to mercury accumulation in elasmobranchs.","Impact of fullerenes in the bioaccumulation and biotransformation of venlafaxine, diuron and triclosan in river biofilms.",https://www.ncbi.nlm.nih.gov/pubmed/30529139,Environmental research,2019 01 25,"A huge variety of organic microcontaminants are presently detected in freshwater ecosystems, but there is still a lack of knowledge about their interactions, either with living organisms or with other contaminants. Actually, carbon nanomaterials like fullerenes (C60) can act as carriers of organic microcontaminants, but their relevance in processes like bioaccumulation and biotransformation of organic microcontaminants by organisms is unknown. In this study, mesocosm experiments were used to assess the bioaccumulation and biotransformation of three organic microcontaminants (venlafaxine, diuron and triclosan) in river biofilms, and to understand how much the concomitant presence of C60 at environmental relevant concentrations could impact these processes. Results indicated that venlafaxine exhibited the highest bioaccumulation (13% of the initial concentration of venlafaxine in water), while biotransformation was more evident for triclosan (5% of the initial concentration of triclosan in water). Furthermore, biotransformation products such as methyl-triclosan were also present in the biofilm, with levels up to 42% of the concentration of accumulated triclosan. The presence of C60 did not involve relevant changes in the bioaccumulation and biotransformation of microcontaminants in biofilms, which showed similar patterns. Nevertheless, the study shows that a detailed evaluation of the partition of the organic microcontaminants and their transformation products in freshwater systems are important to better understand the impact of the co-existence of others microcontaminants, like carbon nanomaterials, in their possible routes of bioaccumulation and biotransformation.",Solidification to improve the biopharmaceutical performance of SEDDS: Opportunities and challenges.,https://www.ncbi.nlm.nih.gov/pubmed/30529138,Advanced drug delivery reviews,2018 12 16,"Self-emulsifying drug delivery systems (SEDDS) offer potential for overcoming the inherent slow dissolution and poor oral absorption of hydrophobic drugs by retaining them in a solubilised state during gastrointestinal transit. However, the promising biopharmaceutical benefits of liquid lipid formulations has not translated into widespread commercial success, due to their susceptibility to long term storage and in vivo precipitation issues. One strategy that has emerged to overcome such limitations, is to combine the solubilisation and dissolution enhancing properties of lipids with the stabilising effects of solid carrier materials. The development of intelligent hybrid drug formulations has presented new opportunities to harness the potential of emulsified lipids in optimising oral bioavailability for lipophilic therapeutics.

To determine their EMT and metastasis levels, in vitro wound healing, wound invasion, Western blotting, RT-PCR, luciferase activity and immunofluorescence assays were performed, while the in vivo anti-metastatic efficacy of AS was evaluated in BALB/c-nu mice through bioluminescence imaging, HE staining, and immunohistochemical staining. MDA-MB-231 cells, when treated with AS concentrations (25-100 μg/mL) resulted in significant reduction of invasion and migration as well as the downregulation of VEGF, uPAR, uPA and MMP-9 (inhibition of PI3K/AKT/NFκB pathways). AS treatment prevented morphological changes and reversed EMT through the upregulation of E-cadherin and the downregulation of N-cadherin, Slug, Twist, and Vimentin. Inhibition of Smad3 signaling pathway, downregulation of β-catenin pathway and upregulation of GSK3β expression were also observed while, suppression of metastasis and EMT in TGF-β1-stimulated non-tumorigenic MCF-10A cells was observed when treated with AS.

The present study was conducted to evaluate the protective role of aqueous bark extract of Terminalia arjuna (TA) against Cd induced oxidative damage in hepatic and cardiac tissues as the TA bark extract has folkloric medicinal use in the treatment of various hepatic and cardiac disorders. Male Wistar rats were divided into 4 groups. The control group was treated with normal saline as the vehicle; the second group orally administered with TA (20 mg/kg bw) daily for 15 days; the third group injected with Cd-acetate (0.44 mg/kg bw, s.c.) every alternate day for a period of 15 days; and the fourth group was administered with TA, 60 min prior to Cd treatment. The biomarkers of organ damage were significantly increased in the Cd treated groups. Besides, a significant alteration in the tissue levels of biomarkers of oxidative stress, the activities and the levels of antioxidant enzymes was observed following treatment with Cd. Additionally, some of the enzymes were found to be inhibited uncompetitively by Cd when tested in an in vitro system. Furthermore, evidence gathered from studies on the histological parameters and mitochondrial membrane potential in both the tissues argue in favour of the possible protective role of TA against Cd induced damage. Finally, gas chromatography-mass spectrometry revealed the presence of eight major bioactive phytochemicals in aqueous bark extract of TA having potent free radical scavenging property.

In this study, the polyphenols from H. serotina (HSP) were mainly composed by caffeic acid dimer, (-)-epicatechin-3-(3'-o-methyl)-gallic acid dimer, quercetin-acetyl-rutinoside hexoside, (-)-epigallocatechin derivatives, rutin derivatives, catechin trimer and 3-caffeoylquinic acid. HSP significantly inhibited the proliferation of HeLa cells in vitro, and induced intracellular ROS accumulation. It was also observed that induction of HeLa cells apoptosis and termination of cell cycle at G0/G1 phase were associated with the anti-tumor activity of HSP. On the basis of the expanded investigations of anti-neoplasm mechanism, HSP could decrease the mRNA expressions of cell cycle related genes including cyclin D1, Ckd2 and Cdk4, and increase the mRNA expressions of p53 and p21. In addition, the mitochondrial apoptosis pathway in HeLa cells was initiated by HSP through activation of Bax, cytochrome c and Caspase-3, as well as inhibition of Bcl-2.

However, determining the viability of these organisms is challenging. Most microorganisms in stool are refractory to culture using standard techniques, and culture-independent PCR-based methods derive signal from both viable and non-viable cells. Propidium monoazide (PMA) treatment has been shown to be effective in preventing PCR amplification of DNA from non-viable bacteria in a range of contexts. However, this methodology can be sensitive to factors such as bacterial load and sample turbidity. We describe the optimisation of a PMA treatment methodology for FS that restricts quantitative PCR-based bacterial enumeration to viable cells. When applied to concentrated FS (10-25% stool content), PMA treatment at 100 μM concentration was ineffective in preventing DNA amplification from heat-killed cells. Efficacy was not significantly improved by doubling the PMA concentration. However, PMA treatment efficacy was improved markedly following 10-fold sample dilution, and was found to be optimal at 100-fold dilution. Substantial reductions in viable bacterial load could be observed following both freeze-thaw and heat-treatment of FS. This method successfully prevented DNA amplification of heat-killed Pseudomonas and Staphylococcus spiked into stool and could reliably determine the proportion of live bacteria and viable E. coli counts present in fresh and heat-treated stool.

Because of their safety and healthfulness when applied to humans, bifidobacteria are suitable as genetically engineered bacteria for applications to benefit human physiology and pathology. However, molecular biological studies of bifidobacteria have been limited due to insufficient genetic tools including effective transformation methods. The aim of this study is to improve the electroporation-mediated transformation efficiency of bifidobacteria to a reproducibly high level. The crucial factors that determine electroporation efficiency are the restriction-modification system, together with the cell wall and cell membrane structure of the bacteria. We optimized the bifidobacterial electroporation conditions by focusing on these factors as well as the amount of plasmid DNA used, the electrical parameters and the bacterial growth phase. As a result, the electroporation efficiency of B. bifidum BGN4 drastically and consistently increased from 103 to 105 CFU / μg DNA. The most significant factor for increasing the electroporation efficiency was the cell wall weakening mediated by NaCl, which improved the electroporation frequency by 20 times. Because the optimized electrotransformation conditions reported here should be widely applicable to other Bifidobacterium species, these could promote the extensive genetic manipulation of the various Bifidobacterium species in future studies.",High density placental mesenchymal stromal cells provide neuronal preservation and improve motor function following in utero treatment of ovine myelomeningocele.,https://www.ncbi.nlm.nih.gov/pubmed/30529115,Journal of pediatric surgery,2019 03 04,The purpose of this study was to determine whether seeding density of placental mesenchymal stromal cells (PMSCs) on extracellular matrix (ECM) during in utero repair of myelomeningocele (MMC) affects motor function and neuronal preservation in the ovine model.,DID it or DIDn't it? Exploration of a failure to replicate binge-like alcohol-drinking in C57BL/6J mice.,https://www.ncbi.nlm.nih.gov/pubmed/30529114,"Pharmacology, biochemistry, and behavior",2019 02 22,"We previously reported that commercially-sourced C57BL/6J (B6) male mice with a history of adult-onset binge-drinking exhibit anxiety-like behavior in early withdrawal, while the negative affective state incubates during protracted withdrawal in adolescent-onset binge-drinking males. As the results of such studies are potentially confounded by age-related differences in reactivity to environmental stress, we employed a 2-bottle-choice DID procedure (20 and 40% alcohol; 20 min habituation to the drinking cage) to examine the effects of binge-drinking on negative affect in male and female, adult and adolescent, B6 mice from our university colony. Unexpectedly, the mice in the initial experiment exhibited very low alcohol intake, with little sign of withdrawal-induced negative affect. This failure to replicate prompted us to examine how the duration of drinking cage habituation, the number of alcohol concentrations presented and the animal source might influence the propensity to binge-drink. Herein, we show that both male and female adult mice from our colony will binge-drink when allowed 45 min to habituate to the drinking cages, irrespective of whether mice are offered a choice between 2, 3 or 4 alcohol concentrations. Further, when drinking under 4-bottle-choice procedures (5, 10, 20 and 40% alcohol), adult-onset binge-drinking females exhibit robust negative affect in early withdrawal akin to that reported previously for adult males; however, the negative affective state persists for at least 30 days into withdrawal. Also unlike males, adolescent-onset binge-drinking females exhibit some signs of negative affect, as well as potentiated alcohol intake, in early withdrawal, which persist into later withdrawal. These latter data suggest that the age-related differences in the temporal patterning of the negative affective state produced by alcohol withdrawal may vary as a function of sex, which may have implications for understanding sex differences in the etiology of affective disorders and alcoholism co-morbidity.",Research Pioneers in Emergency Medicine-Reflections on Their Paths to Success and Advice to Aspiring Researchers: A Qualitative Study.,https://www.ncbi.nlm.nih.gov/pubmed/30529113,Annals of emergency medicine,2019 05 28,"Research in basic, translational, and clinical emergency medicine has made great strides since the formalization of emergency medicine as a specialty.

We evaluate the association between MTHFR 677 C>T polymorphisms and non-recurrent spontaneous abortion and its interaction with PON1 polymorphisms involved in homocysteine metabolism in women living in floricultural areas in Mexico. Sociodemographic, reproductive history, folic acid consumption during pregnancy and environmental exposure data of 264 women who had been pregnant sometime during the 10 years prior to study enrolment were collected. MTHFR 677 C>T, PON1 192Q>R and PON1 55L>M genotypes were determined by PCR amplification. Information on pregnancy outcome and maternal genotypes was obtained for 484 pregnancies: 34 non-recurrent spontaneous abortions (gestational age < 20 weeks) and 450 controls. GEE models were used to evaluate the association between MTHFR polymorphism and non-recurrent spontaneous abortion, and its interaction with PON1 polymorphisms.

Along with white feathers and a black bill and feet, the Fengtou duck has a high feather crest. This breed can be used for ornamental purposes or as a model organism; however, little is known about the genetic basis and development of its distinct morphological features. In this study, we observed the skull and feather crest of Fengtou duck in the embryonic stages. As a result, the protuberances of the head integument could be clearly observed at embryonic stage E9, and small perforations in the skull were first visible at E13 and were clearer at E15. Besides, intracranial fat in a small number of individuals was found starting at E15, and a small number of osteophytes was found at E18. In addition, hematoxylin-eosin (HE) and Oil Red-O staining of the crest cushion and intracranial tissue revealed fat tissue accumulation. Previous studies demonstrated that homeobox c8 (HOXC8) played a critical role in chicken crest formation. Here, we cloned the HOXC8 from Fengtou duck and determined that its transcript was highly expressed in the crest cushion; moreover, HOXC8 was detected in this tissue with a molecular weight of 38 kDa in the Fengtou duck. In conclusion, embryos of Fengtou duck have different small protuberances and perforations in the skull, including accumulation of intracranial tissue and osteophytes in some cases. Furthermore, HOXC8 may regulate the formation of the crest. These findings provide novel insight into the ontogenesis of the crest cushion in crested ducks and a basis for future studies on their evolutionary origins.",Integrated miRNA and mRNA transcriptomes of spleen profiles between Yorkshire and Queshan black pigs.,https://www.ncbi.nlm.nih.gov/pubmed/30529098,Gene,2019 02 15,"Disease causes large economic losses to the pig industry worldwidely, immunity plays an important role in the process of resistance to disease.

The results showed that 85 miRNAs and 5093 genes were differentially expressed in Y-F vs Y-N, and 20 miRNAs and 1283 genes were differentially expressed in Q-F vs Y-F. Gene ontology analysis of these differentially expressed genes revealed their critical roles in response to immune response-related signaling pathways. To investigate the molecular mechanisms underlying immune diversity based on differentially expressed miRNAs and genes, the regulatory network between the node miRNAs and genes were established using Cytoscape. The results showed that the identified candidate miRNAs and genes were associated with immune response, and also indicated their potential roles in disease resistance variance between different pig breeds and stages. From the above, this research detected the key factors that were involved in disease resistance, and provide useful information for disease resistance breeding.",Association of ATP binding cassette transporter 1 (ABCA 1) gene polymorphism with type 2 diabetes mellitus (T2DM) in Bangladeshi population.,https://www.ncbi.nlm.nih.gov/pubmed/30529097,Gene,2019 02 15,ATP-binding cassette transporter 1 (ABCA1) gene polymorphism has been reported as one of the genetic risk factors for T2DM in various populations with conflicting results.

Drosophila uses a single genetic locus - the Achaete-Scute Complex - to demarcate the regions of the body where bristles can form. We found 4-5 Achaete-Scute Complex homologue genes (ASH) in the mammalian genome, which are homologous with scute in Drosophila. Although ASH2 and ASH3 have gained new functions during evolution, the function of ASH4 and its evolutionary changes are still unclear. In this study, we overexpressed mouse and human ASH1 and ASH4 in the Drosophila notum respectively. The results show that both the protein sequence and cis-regulatory elements of mammalian ASH1 have conserved an ancient proneural function during evolution. However, mouse ASH4 has lost proneural function partly due to truncation of a C-terminal amino acid domain. Interestingly, instead of a similar loss of proneural function, we found human ASH4 can actually inhibit Drosophila bristle development, implying that human ASH4 may be a potential factor relating to skin development in human being. Our results demonstrate gene duplication of the ASH family may have led to a novel function during evolution.",Donor one‑carbon metabolism gene single nucleotide polymorphisms predict the susceptibility of cancer recurrence after liver transplantation.,https://www.ncbi.nlm.nih.gov/pubmed/30529095,Gene,2019 02 15,"Many enzymes involved in one‑carbon metabolism (OCM) are considered to have important roles in carcinogenesis, especially in hepatocellular carcinoma (HCC).

It was shown that RcLEC1-B was specifically expressed in PLB of R. canina and its subcellular localization is in the nucleus. Overexpression of RcLEC1-B in Arabidopsis resulted in a decrease in endogenous ABA level, an increase in GA, IAA and CTK contents, and an increased number of branches. RcLEC1-B promotes the formation of spontaneous embryoids, suggesting that it may be a homolog of the Arabidopsis LEC1 gene. RcLEC1-B-OE changed the number and morphology of flower organs and resulted in open carpels and exposed ovules, along with a reduced percentage of fertile fruit. This is the first observation that overexpression of a homolog of LEC1 in Arabidopsis can lead to morphological changes in floral organs, cuticle defects, and adhesions between organs; this may result from the increased level of gibberellin in the transgenic plants.",Strongyloides venezuelensis infection augments arterial blood pressure in male wistar rats.,https://www.ncbi.nlm.nih.gov/pubmed/30529092,Acta tropica,2019 03 14,"Strongyloidiasis is an intestinal parasitosis that occurs in humans infected by Strongyloides stercoralis mostly. At its acute phase, symptoms like constipation, diarrhea and abdominal pain can be observed, but become asymptomatic for a long time, until an immunosuppression will start a hyperinfection and the dissemination of the disease, prevalent on the elderly population in tropical countries. Ivermectina treatment is the currently choice for this disease, due to its great efficacy and the results reported. It is expected that around one hundred million individuals have been infected around the world. Strongyloides venezuelensis is an intestinal helminth utilized on Strongyloidiasis investigations, in rodents. As the parasites reach the blood stream after subcutaneous infection, the larvae migrate to the lung by systemic circulation, but the effects of S. venezuelensis in the circulation remain widely unknown. Moreover, the role played by S. venezuelensis in the cardiovascular function has been understudied. Thus, the aim of this study is to determine whether acute infection with S. venezuelensis alters systemic blood pressure or not. Male wistar rats were infected subcutaneously with 2000 L3 larvae of S. venezuelensis and monitored during 21 days (Infected group), compared to a Healthy group, no infected. Oviposition, body and faeces weight, water and food intake were determined every 3 days. Moreover, systemic blood pressure was assessed by tail cuff plethysmography. At the end of experiments, the animals were euthanized and the number of worms, ventricles, lung and thymus and small intestine weight were registered. It was possible to observe that systolic blood pressure (126.86 ± 2.74 vs 155.08 ± 7.61 at 9°-day post infection - dpi - and 134.44 ± 5.22 vs 157.77 ± 9.55 at 21° dpi) and mean arterial pressure (71.72 ± 1.59 vs 80.51 ± 2.32 at 21° dpi) were markedly higher (P <  0.001) in infected group in comparison to the Healthy group. Those changes occurred after larvae passes through the circulation and demonstrated a late response to the presence of this parasite. These results suggest that host circulatory system reacts to this infection resulting in a significant increase in blood pressure.",Estimating returns to hospital volume: Evidence from advanced cancer surgery.,https://www.ncbi.nlm.nih.gov/pubmed/30529091,Journal of health economics,2019 02 20,"High-volume hospitals typically perform better than low-volume hospitals.

Using detailed register data on more than 100,000 treatment episodes of advanced cancer surgery, our results suggest substantial positive effects of operation volume on survival.

The objective of this study is to develop a liquid-type antiadhesion agent and evaluate its efficacy in preventing tissue adhesion in a rat peritoneal adhesion model. The liquid-type agent was prepared by submicron-sized emulsification of C17 glycerin ester (C17GE), squalene, pluronic F127, ethanol, and water with a high-pressure homogenizer. The primary component was C17GE, which is an amphiphilic lipid of one isoprenoid-type hydrophobic chain and can form two phases of self-assembly nonlamellar liquid crystals. The C17GE agent consisted of nanoparticles with an internal inverted hexagonal phase when evaluated by small-angle X-ray scattering (SAXS) and cryo-transmission electron microscopy (cryo-TEM). Upon contact with the biological tissue, this agent formed a thin membrane with a bioadhesive property. After this agent was applied to a sidewall injury of rats, it showed a percentage average of adhesion significantly less than that obtained with the Seprafilm® antiadhesion membrane in a rat model. Additionally, the retention of the agent prolonged at the applied site in the peritoneal cavity of rats. In conclusion, the C17GE agent is promising as an antiadhesion material. STATEMENT OF SIGNIFICANCE: Postoperative adhesion remains a common adverse effect. Although various materials have been investigated, there are few products commercially available to prevent adhesion. For the sheet-type agent, it is inconvenient to be applied through small laparotomy, especially in laparoscopic surgery. Additionally, the liquid-type agent currently used requires a complicated procedure to spray at the targeted site. Our liquid-type antiadhesion agent can form liquid crystals and act as a thin membrane-like physical barrier between the peritoneum and tissues to prevent adhesion. Indeed, the antiadhesion agent used in our present study significantly prevents adhesion compared with the antiadhesion membrane most used clinically. Moreover, our agent is highly stable by itself and easy to use in laparoscopic surgery, thus leading to a promising new candidate as an antiadhesion material.",Different roles for aspartates and glutamates for cation permeation in bacterial sodium channels.,https://www.ncbi.nlm.nih.gov/pubmed/30529079,Biochimica et biophysica acta. Biomembranes,2018 12 28,"A key driving force for ion channel selectivity is represented by the negative charge of the Selectivity Filter carried by aspartate (D) and glutamate (E) residues. However, the structural effects and specific properties of D and E residues have not been extensively studied. In order to investigate this issue we studied the mutants of NaChBac channel with all possible combinations of D and E in the charged rings in position 191 and 192. Electrophysiological measurements showed significant Ca2+ currents only when position 191 was occupied by E. Equilibrium Molecular Dynamics simulations revealed the existence of two binding sites, corresponding to the charged rings and another one, more internal, at the level of L190. The simulations showed that the ion in the innermost site can interact with the residue in position 191 only when this is glutamate. Based on the MD simulations, we suggest that a D in position 191 leads to a high affinity Ca2+ block site resulting from a significant drop in the free energy of binding for an ion moving between the binding sites; in contrast, the free energy change is more gradual when an E residue occupies position 191, resulting in Ca2+ permeability. This scenario is consistent with the model of ion channel selectivity through stepwise changes in binding affinity proposed by Dang and McCleskey. Our study also highlights the importance of the structure of the selectivity filter which should contribute to the development of more detailed physical models for ion channel selectivity.",Membrane interaction of off-pathway prion oligomers and lipid-induced on-pathway intermediates during prion conversion: A clue for neurotoxicity.,https://www.ncbi.nlm.nih.gov/pubmed/30529078,Biochimica et biophysica acta. Biomembranes,2018 12 28,"Soluble oligomers of prion proteins (PrP), produced during amyloid aggregation, have emerged as the primary neurotoxic species, instead of the fibrillar end-products, in transmissible spongiform encephalopathies. However, whether the membrane is among their direct targets, that mediate the downstream adverse effects, remains a question of debate. Recently, questions arise from the formation of membrane-active oligomeric species generated during the β-aggregation pathway, either in solution, or in lipid environment. In the present study, we characterized membrane interaction of off-pathway oligomers from recombinant prion protein generated along the amyloid aggregation and compared to lipid-induced intermediates produced during lipid-accelerated fibrillation. Using calcein-leakage assay, we show that the soluble prion oligomers are the most potent in producing leakage with negatively charged vesicles. Binding affinities, conformational states, mode of action of the different PrP assemblies were determined by thioflavin T binding-static light scattering experiments on DOPC/DOPS vesicles, as well as by FTIR-ATR spectroscopy and specular neutron reflectivity onto the corresponding supported lipid bilayers. Our results indicate that the off-pathway PrP oligomers interact with lipid membrane via a distinct mechanism, compared to the inserted lipid-induced intermediates. Thus, separate neurotoxic mechanisms could exist following the puzzling intermediates generated in the different cell compartments. These results not only reveal an important regulation of lipid membrane on PrP behavior but may also provide clues for designing stage-specific and prion-targeted therapy.",Agreement and illusion of disagreement: An ERP study on Basque.,https://www.ncbi.nlm.nih.gov/pubmed/30529077,Cortex; a journal devoted to the study of the nervous system and behavior,2019 06 08,"Agreement is a syntactic relation involving a controller (e.g., a noun) and a target with matching inflectional morphology (e.g., a verb).

The current study focuses on person agreement in Basque to investigate whether online processing routines are modulated by the relative semantic prominence of nominal and verbal person features. In an event-related potentials experiment in Basque, we manipulated the semantic markedness of nominal and verbal person features, creating 1st (marked) and 3rd (unmarked) person correct and incorrect sentences [Japoniarrok1pleuskara ikasi dugu1pl/*dute3plgustora (We Japanese have1pl/*3pl learn Basque with pleasure); Japoniarrek3pleuskara ikasi dute3pl/*dugu1pl gustora (The Japanese have3pl/*1pl learnt Basque with pleasure)]. Both mismatches elicited an N400 effect, but only marked 1st person mismatches (Japoniarrok1pl … *dute3.pl) generated a P600, suggesting that (i) mismatches with unmarked 3rd person subjects (Japoniarrek3.pl… *dugu1.pl) are not treated as outright violations; (ii) the emergence of late positive effects is sensitive to fine-grained discourse information.

Here, we investigated the role of Notch signaling in the cross talk between ECs and MM cells enabling angiogenesis. MMECs showed higher expression of Jagged1/2 ligands, of activated Notch1/2 receptors, and of Hes1/Hey1 Notch target genes than ECs from monoclonal gammopathy of undetermined significance patients, suggesting that homotypic activation of Notch pathway occurs in MM. MM cells co-cultured with MMECs triggered Notch activation in these cells through a cell-to-cell contact-dependent way via Jagged1/2, resulting in Hes1/Hey1 overexpression. The angiogenic effect of Notch pathway was analyzed through Notch1/2·siRNAs and the γ-secretase inhibitor MK-0752 by in vitro (adhesion, migration, chemotaxis, angiogenesis) and in vivo (Vk12598/C57B/6 J mouse model) studies. Activated Notch1/2 pathway was associated with the overangiogenic MMEC phenotype: Notch1/2 knockdown or MK-0752 treatment reduced Hes1/Hey1 expression, impairing in vitro angiogenesis of both MMECs alone and co-cultured with MM cells. MM cells were unable to restore angiogenic abilities of treated MMECs, proving that MMEC angiogenic activities closely rely on Notch pathway. Furthermore, Notch1/2 knockdown affected VEGF/VEGFR2 axis, indicating that the Notch pathway interferes with VEGF-mediated control on angiogenesis. MK-0752 reduced secretion of proangiogenic/proinflammatory cytokines in conditioned media, thus inhibiting blood vessel formation in the CAM assay. In the Vk12598/C57B/6 J mouse, MK-0752 treatment restrained angiogenesis by reducing microvessel density. Overall, homotypic and heterotypic Jagged1/2-mediated Notch activation enhances MMECs angiogenesis. Notch axis inhibition blocked angiogenesis in vitro and in vivo, suggesting that the Notch pathway may represent a novel therapeutic target in MM.",Fornix deep brain stimulation induces reduction of hippocampal synaptophysin levels.,https://www.ncbi.nlm.nih.gov/pubmed/30529072,Journal of chemical neuroanatomy,2019 02 17,"Fornix deep brain stimulation (DBS) has the ability to refurbish memory functions in animal models with experimental dementia.

Here, we want to test the hypothesis that acute fornix DBS can also lead to long-term effects on neuroplasticity. Rats received DBS at 100 Hz, 100 μA and 100 μs pulse width for 4 h with electrodes placed bilaterally in the fornix. Seven weeks after stimulation, rats were sacrificed. BDNF, p-CREB, SV2 and synaptophysin immunohistochemistry was performed for their brains. No differences were found in the number of BDNF, p-CREB or SV2 positive cells for fornix DBS rats when compared to sham. Surprisingly, the density of synaptophysin immunoreactive presynaptic boutons was significantly decreased in the CA1 and CA3 subregion of the hippocampus for DBS rats. Therefore, fornix DBS might induce long-term depression related mechanisms.",Obstructive sleep apnea as a predictor of reduced heart rate variability.,https://www.ncbi.nlm.nih.gov/pubmed/30529071,Sleep medicine,2019 02 19,This study aimed to analyze the relationship between the occurrence of obstructive sleep apnea (OSA) and heart rate variability (HRV) in a group of patients with clinical suggestion of OSA.,Suicidal thought and behavior in individuals with restless legs syndrome.,https://www.ncbi.nlm.nih.gov/pubmed/30529070,Sleep medicine,2019 02 19,"Restless legs syndrome (RLS) is associated with an unrelenting urge to move at night, which can cause chronic sleeplessness, depression, and despondency; thus increasing risk of suicide.

Some aspects of clinical management of OC might be improved by the use of validated TMs, such as differentiating subtypes, defining the most appropriate treatment, monitoring the course of the disease, or predicting clinical outcome. The Food and Drug Administration (FDA) has approved a few TMs for OC: CA125 (cancer antigen 125; monitoring), HE4 (Human epididymis protein; monitoring), ROMA (Risk Of Malignancy Algorithm; HE4+CA125; prediction of malignancy) and OVA1 (Vermillion's first-generation Multivariate Index Assay [MIA]; prediction of malignancy).

In addition, overexpression of miR-204-5p resulted in increase of osteosarcoma cell apoptosis and decrease of osteosarcoma cell migration and invasion. Besides, our in vivo xenograft data showed strong inhibitory role of miR-204-5p in tumor growth. Importantly, our data showed that miR-204-5p regulates the mRNA stability of Early B Cell Factor 2 (EBF2), a crucial regulator in osteosarcoma apoptosis, by directly binding to 3' UTR of EBF2. Besides, our data further revealed that overexpressed EBF2 inhibited apoptosis and facilitated migration and invasion of osteosarcoma cells. Additionally, EBF2 overexpression rescued the phenotype caused by miR-204-5p.Our data indicated that miR-204-5p is an anti-oncogenic miRNA in osteosarcoma which functions through inhibiting oncogenic transcription factor EBF2.

Many influenza vaccination programmes target the elderly and persons at high risk of complications. Some countries have recommended or even implemented a paediatric vaccination programme. Such a programme is expected to reduce influenza transmission in the population, offering direct protection to the vaccinated children and indirect protection to the elderly. We study the impact of a child vaccination programme with an age- and risk-structured transmission model, calibrated to data of 11 influenza seasons in the Netherlands. The model tracks the build-up of immunes and susceptibles in each age cohort over time, and it allows for seasonal variation in vaccine match and antigenic drift. Different vaccination strategies are evaluated for three target age groups (2-3, 2-12 and 2-16 year olds) over the full range of vaccination coverages (0-100%). The results show that the paediatric vaccination programme has only a limited impact on the elderly age groups, which account for most influenza morbidity and mortality. This is due to two notable changes in infection dynamics. First, an age shift is observed: influenza infections are reduced in vaccinated children, but are increased in young adults with limited natural immunity after years of vaccination. These young adults assume the role of driving the epidemic. Second, a year with low influenza activity can be followed by a large epidemic due to build-up of susceptibles. This variation of the infection attack rate increases with increasing vaccination coverage. The increased variability in the infection attack rate implies that health care facilities should be prepared for rare but larger peaks in influenza patients. Moreover, vaccinating the group with the highest transmission potential, results in a larger dependency on a secure vaccine supply. These arguments should be taken into account in the decision to introduce mass vaccination of school-aged children against influenza.",The Human Microbiome and Child Growth - First 1000 Days and Beyond.,https://www.ncbi.nlm.nih.gov/pubmed/30529020,Trends in microbiology,2019 01 18,"The assembly of microbial communities within the gastrointestinal tract during early life plays a critical role in immune, endocrine, metabolic, and other host developmental pathways.

Here, we review the human microbiome in the first 1000 days - referring to the period from conception to 2 years of age - and using a developmental model, we examine the role of early microbial succession in growth and development. We propose that an 'undernourished' microbiome is intergenerational, thereby perpetuating growth impairments into successive generations.

In our study, we compared the performances of the two methods using transcriptome and methylome profiles generated simultaneously from single mouse oocytes. Our results showed that the beads-based approach could capture maximum quantity of mRNA but loss of DNA was inevitable, while the non-beads-based approach could obtain more DNA due to the undamaged nucleus obtained but at a cost of partial loss of mRNA. As the sequencing coverage of methylome sequencing in a single cell was relatively low, single-cell whole genome bisulfite sequencing (scWGBS) was preferable to generate the methylome map in single-cell parallel sequencing in comparison to single-cell reduced representation bisulfite sequencing (scRRBS). To the best of our knowledge, this is the first study to compare the two methods of single-cell parallel sequencing which offers a basic idea for deciding between the two methods and a direction of single-cell parallel sequencing development.","Cigarette smoking, alcohol consumption, and risk of colorectal cancer in South Korea: A case-control study.",https://www.ncbi.nlm.nih.gov/pubmed/30529018,"Alcohol (Fayetteville, N.Y.)",2019 05 06,"The current case-control study comprehensively evaluated the status, quantity, and duration of smoking and alcohol drinking for both men and women, considering the subsites of colorectal cancer.

Here a high-resolution computerized method was employed in the same cohort to evaluate four regions where neuroimaging studies have found atrophy in smokers and alcoholics: insula, thalamus, prefrontal cortex, and anterior cingulate cortex. Brain images from 44 cases comprising 16 non-smoking controls, nine smoking controls, eight non-smoking alcoholics, and 11 smoking alcoholics were quantified. No significant differences between the groups were found, although the alcoholic groups tended to have smaller volumes in most regions. Furthermore, there were no smoking or interactive effects, and no correlation between gray matter volumes and either tobacco pack-years or lifetime alcohol consumption.

Although the underlying pathophysiology of ADHD remains unclear, dopamine and norepinephrine signaling originating from the ventral tegmental area (VTA) and locus coeruleus (LC) is thought to be critically involved. In this study, we employ Designer Receptor Exclusively Activated by Designer Drugs (DREADDs) together with the mouse 5-Choice Serial Reaction Time Task (5-CSRTT) to investigate the necessary roles of these catecholamines in ADHD-related behaviors, including attention, impulsivity, and motivation. By selective inhibition of tyrosine hydroxylase (TH)-positive VTA dopamine neurons expressing the Gi-coupled DREADD (hM4Di), we observed a marked impairment of effort-based motivation and subsequently speed and overall vigor of responding. At the highest clozapine N-oxide (CNO) dose tested (i.e. 2 mg/kg) to activate hM4Di, we detected a reduction in locomotor activity. DREADD-mediated inhibition of LC norepinephrine neurons reduced attentional performance in a variable stimulus duration test designed to increase task difficulty, specifically by increasing trials omissions, reducing mean score, and visual processing speed. These findings show that VTA dopamine and LC norepinephrine neurons differentially affect attention, impulsive and motivational control. In addition, this study highlights how molecular genetic probing of selective catecholamine circuits can provide valuable insights into the mechanisms underlying ADHD-relevant behaviors.",Theranostic pharmacology in PTSD: Neurobiology and timing.,https://www.ncbi.nlm.nih.gov/pubmed/30529001,Progress in neuro-psychopharmacology & biological psychiatry,2019 04 22,"Recent reviews and treatment guidelines regard trauma-focused cognitive-behavior therapies as the treatments of choice for chronic post-traumatic stress disorder (PTSD). However, many patients do not engage in this treatment when it is available, drop out before completion, or do not respond. Medications remain widely used, alone and in conjunction with psychotherapy, although the limitations of traditional monoamine-based pharmacotherapy are increasingly recognized. This article will review recent developments in psychopharmacology for PTSD, with a focus on current clinical data that apply putative neurobiologic mechanisms to medication use-i.e., a theranostic approach. A theranostic approach however, also requires consideration of timing, pre, peri or post trauma in conjunction with underlying dynamic processes affecting synaptic plasticity, the HPA axis, hippocampal activation, PFC-amygdala circuitry and fear memory.",Oxidative and inflammatory mediators are upregulated in neutrophils of autistic children: Role of IL-17A receptor signaling.,https://www.ncbi.nlm.nih.gov/pubmed/30529000,Progress in neuro-psychopharmacology & biological psychiatry,2019 04 22,"Autism spectrum disorder (ASD) is characterized by repetitive behaviors, impaired social communication and stereotyped interests, and often associated with dysregulations in innate/adaptive immune cells. IL-17A has been linked with abnormal behavioral patterns observed in autistic children and animal models of autism. However, it is yet to be investigated if IL-17A and its receptors are implicated in regulation of oxidative and inflammatory mediators in neutrophils of ASD patients. Therefore, we pursued to identify the effect of IL-17 receptor (IL-17R), and its inflammatory potential in neutrophils from ASD (n = 45) and typically developing control (TDC; n = 40) subjects. IL-17A, its receptor (IL-17R), associated signaling pathways [nuclear transcription factor nuclear factor-kappa B (NF-κB), IL-6 and oxidative stress parameters such as NADPH oxidase (NOX2), inducible nitric oxide synthase (iNOS), reactive oxygen species (ROS), and nitrotyrosine] were determined in the neutrophils from TDC and ASD subjects. Our data show that IL-17A expression, and IL-17R are increased in neutrophils of ASD patients. Further, inflammatory signaling pathways such as such as phospho-NFκB, and ROS generating enzymes, i.e. NOX2/iNOS are increased in neutrophils of ASD patients as compared TDC subjects. Furthermore, activation of IL-17A/IL-17R signaling in neutrophils of ASD subjects leads to upregulation of phospho-NFκB, IL-6 and NOX2/ROS, thus suggesting a compelling role of IL-17A in modulation of inflammation. Our study displays for the first time that IL-17A/IL-17R signaling in neutrophils could play a pivotal role in autism through upregulation of oxidative and inflammatory mediators.","Biophysical, molecular dynamics and cellular studies on the interaction of nickel oxide nanoparticles with tau proteins and neuron-like cells.",https://www.ncbi.nlm.nih.gov/pubmed/30528999,International journal of biological macromolecules,2019 05 16,"Nickel oxide nanoparticles (NiO NPs) have been used in the biological and medical sciences.

Therefore, the adverse effect of NiO NPs on tau structure was investigated by fluorescence and CD spectroscopic methods as well as TEM study. Also, molecular dynamic study was run to extend the experimental data. Cytotoxic activity of NiO NPs against SH-SY5Y cell was determined by trypan blue exclusion, cell morphology, ROS, and apoptosis assays. ANS, Nile red, ThT assays and electron micrograph investigation revealed that NiO NPs can increase the hydrophobic portions of tau and induce the formation of amorphous tau aggregates. Far and near CD spectroscopic methods revealed that NiO NPs can change the secondary and tertiary structure of tau, respectively. Theoretical studies depicted that NiO NPs lead to folding of tau structure. In the cellular view, NiO NPs induced significant mortality and morphological effects against SH-SY5Y cells. NiO NPs also provided a significant impact on generating intracellular ROS and apoptosis induction. This study determined that NiO NPs could mediate the induction of some undesired effects on the nervous system.",Acid pH promotes bispecific antibody formation by the redox procedure.,https://www.ncbi.nlm.nih.gov/pubmed/30528998,International journal of biological macromolecules,2019 05 16,"Bispecific antibodies (BsAbs), are potential theranostics. Chemical procedures of preparation of BsAbs, in which two monospecific antibodies are split into half molecules and heterodimerized, continue to attract attention in view of their simplicity. Poor dissociation of antibodies with reduced inter-heavy chain disulfides into half molecules under neutral conditions however restricts the BsAbs formation. In this study, we report that the heterodimerization of antibodies can be improved leading to over 6-fold increase in the yield of BsAbs, by carrying out the redox procedure at pH 4.0. In view of improvement in heterodimerization, BsAbs could be conveniently prepared starting from partially purified ion-exchange fraction of the antiserum and purified by twin affinity chromatography on antigen supports. The UV, CD, intrinsic and extrinsic fluorescence spectral analysis of BsAbs prepared by the modified redox procedure were comparable with the native IgG, which suggest the absence of significant acid-pH-induced damage.

To overcome these limitations, blending PLA with other polymers is an inexpensive approach that could also tailor the final properties of PLA-based products. During the last two decades, researchers investigated the synthesis, processing, properties, and development of various PLA-based blend systems including miscible blends of poly l-lactide (PLLA) and poly d-lactide (PDLA), which generate stereocomplex crystals, binary immiscible/miscible blends of PLA with other thermoplastics, multifunctional ternary blends using a third polymer or fillers such as nanoparticles, as well as PLA-based blend foam systems. This article reviews all these investigations and compares the syntheses/processing-morphology-properties interrelationships in PLA-based blends developed so far for various applications.",Prediction and analysis of GH14 family β-amylases in oat seedling extract: Structure and function insights using in silico approaches.,https://www.ncbi.nlm.nih.gov/pubmed/30528996,International journal of biological macromolecules,2019 05 21,"Oat (Avena sativa L.) seedling extract exhibited a high degree of catalytic activities. Bioinformatics were used to identify β-amylases as abundant enzymes in the oat seedling extract. These identified oat enzymes are a member of the GH14 family. Proteins in the Avena sativa seedling extract were separated by SDS-PAGE and 2 major protein bands with an apparent molecular weights of 53 and 42 kDa were the subject of this study. These materials were digested with trypsin and the amino acid sequences of the tryptic peptides were determined by LC/ESI/MS/MS and database searches. These sequences were used to identify cDNAs from expressed sequence tags (EST) and Transcriptome Shotgun Assembly (TSA) of Avena sativa. Based upon EST and TSA sequences, at least 6 predicted different sequences were identified and assigned as β-amylases. Insights into structural characterization of the oat predicted β-amylases were analyzed using in silico approaches. The identified β-amylases conserved the two Glu residues assigned as the ""putative"" catalytic residues, which would act as an acid and base pair in the catalytic process. A similar core (β/α)8-barrel architecture was found in the predicted oat β-amylases with a specific location of the active site in a pocket-like cavity structure made at one end of this core (β/α)8-barrel domain. This suggests an accessibility of the non-reducing end of the substrate towards the oat β-amylases and thus confirming that are exo-acting hydrolases. The results provide a detailed view of the main residues involved in catalysis in this kind of enzyme.",Structural dynamics of DNA binding to tea catechins.,https://www.ncbi.nlm.nih.gov/pubmed/30528995,International journal of biological macromolecules,2019 05 21,"We determined the conjugation and binding efficacy of tea catechins (+)-catechin (C), (-)-epicatechin gallate (ECG) and (-)-epigallocatechin gallate (EGCG) with calf thymus DNA in aqueous solution at physiological pH. Thermodynamic analysis showed that tea catechins bind DNA via hydrophilic and hydrophobic interactions with the binding efficacy of 45-60%. Larger catechins form more stable DNA adducts with the order of stability EGCG > ECG > C. Modeling showed catechin-DNA conjugation occurs via both G-C and A-T base pairs with the free binding energy of -4.46 (C), -4.51 (EGC) and -4.59 kcal/mol (EGCG).

Lactobacillus fermentum was selected to ferment longan pulp and the polysaccharides from unfermented and fermented longan pulp (denoted as LP and LP-F, respectively) were isolated. Their physicochemical, immunomodulatory and prebiotic activities were investigated. The results revealed that LP-F, the molecular weight of which was lower than that of LP, contained less neutral sugar, uronic acid and glucose but more arabinose, galactose, rhamnose and mannose. Compared with LP, LP-F had better solubility, lower apparent viscosity and particle size. LP-F exhibited stronger stimulation on macrophages secretion of NO and IL-6, as well as better proliferation of Leuconostoc mesenteroides and Lactobacillus casei. In summary, fermentation treatment could change the physicochemical properties and enhance the bioactivity of polysaccharides from longan pulp.",Preparation of nanochitin-contained magnetic chitosan microfibers via continuous injection gelation method for removal of Ni(II) ion from aqueous solution.,https://www.ncbi.nlm.nih.gov/pubmed/30528993,International journal of biological macromolecules,2019 05 16,"In this study, nanochitin-contained magnetic chitosan (FPCC) microfibers were prepared successfully via continuous injection gelation method and employed to remove Ni(II) ion from aqueous solution. Firstly, Fe3O4-nanoparticles were encapsulated into ε-caprolactam (CL) monomer solution in the presence of polystyrene (PSE), followed by CL anionic ring-opening polymerization and PSE removal, and obtained magnetic polyamide 6 (PA 6) microparticles (FP). After that, the economical FPCC microfibers can be prepared by adding FP microparticles and nanochitin (n-CT) into poly(vinyl alcohol)/chitosan hybrids (PVA/CTS). The obtained FPCC microfibers had shown significant advantages in production, separation, and adsorption when compared to the hydrogel beads prepared by the traditional method (instantaneous gelation method). Within 10 h, 99.7% Ni(II) could be adsorbed by FPCC magnetic microfibers (adsorbent dosage: 1 g, pH: 4.1, and temperature: 293 K). More attractively, the hybridized microfibers could be easily separated from the aqueous solution through a magnetic separation method after Ni(II) adsorption. Ni(II) adsorption behaviors of the hybrid microfibers conform to the Langmuir isotherm model and pseudo-second-order kinetic model. Besides, the possible adsorption mechanism was also discussed."

The aim of present study was the assessment of macrophages in the polyp tissue and monocytes in the peripheral blood in the course of CRSwNP, and their functional immunophenotype. We analyzed 31 patients with CRSwNP. Nasal mucosa tissue was obtained via functional endoscopic sinus surgery (FESS). The control group included 10 patients with deviated nasal septum (DNS). Fluorochrome stained cells were proceed to acquisition using FACS Canto flow cytometer, and the results were analyzed using the software FACS Diva. In our study, we observed a significantly higher level of CD80, CD274, CD273 and TLR1 in nasal polyps compared to blood samples from patients with CRSwNP. This finding may suggest the importance of the PD-1 pathway as a therapeutic target in CRS and an important role for TLR1 in nasal polyp formation and maintenance.

We reviewed the usefulness of diffusion methods in discriminating the affected WM regions and its relation to cognitive impairment. These studies were categorized based on the diffusion MRI techniques used. The most common method was the diffusion tensor imaging, whereas other methods included diffusion weighted imaging, diffusion kurtosis imaging, intravoxel incoherent motion, and studies based on diffusion tractography. The diffusion measures showed correlation with cognitive scores and disease progression, with mean diffusivity being the most robust parameter. Future studies should focus on incorporating multi-compartment and higher order diffusion models, which can handle the presence of multiple and crossing fibers inside a voxel.","Isoform selective PLD inhibition by novel, chiral 2,8-diazaspiro[4.5]decan-1-one derivatives.",https://www.ncbi.nlm.nih.gov/pubmed/30528979,Bioorganic & medicinal chemistry letters,2019 06 13,"This letter describes the on-going SAR efforts to develop PLD1, PLD2 and dual PLD1/2 inhibitors with improved physiochemical and disposition properties as well as securing intellectual property position.

Ganetespib, a most promising candidate among several HSP90 inhibitors under clinical trials, has entered Phase III clinical trials for cancer therapy. Despite numerous evidences validating HSP90 as a target of anticancer, there are few studies on PET agents targeting oncogenic HSP90. In this study, we synthesized and biologically evaluated a novel 18F-labeled 5-resorcinolic triazolone derivative (1, [18F]PTP-Ganetespib) based on ganetespib. [18F]PTP-Ganetespib was labeled by click chemistry of Ganetespib-PEG-Alkyne (10) and [18F]PEG-N3 (11) with 37.3 ± 5.11% of radiochemical yield and 99.7 ± 0.09% of radiochemical purity. [18F]PTP-Ganetespib showed proper LogP (0.96 ± 0.06) and good stability in human serum over 97% for 2 h. [18F]PTP-Ganetespib showed high uptakes in breast cancer cells containing triple negative breast cancer (TNBC) MDA-MB-231 and Her2-negative MCF-7 cells, which are target breast cancer cell lines of HSP90 inhibitor, ganetespib, as an anticancer. Blocking of HSP90 by the pretreatment of ganetespib exhibited significantly decreased accumulation of [18F]PTP-Ganetespib in MDA-MB-231 and MCF-7 cells, indicating the specific binding of [18F]PTP-Ganetespib to MDA-MB-231 and MCF-7 cells with high HSP90 expression. In the biodistribution and microPET imaging studies, the initial uptake into tumor was weaker than in other thoracic and abdominal organs, but [18F]PTP-Ganetespib was retained relatively longer in the tumor than other organs. The uptake of [18F]PTP-Ganetespib in tumors was not sufficient for further development as a tumor-specific PET imaging agent by itself, but this preliminary PET imaging study of [18F]PTP-Ganetespib can be basis for developing new PET imaging agents based on HSP90 inhibitor, ganetespib.",Glycyrrhetinic acid derivatives containing aminophosphonate ester species as multidrug resistance reversers that block the NF-κB pathway and cell proliferation.,https://www.ncbi.nlm.nih.gov/pubmed/30528976,Bioorganic & medicinal chemistry letters,2019 05 30,"Novel NF-κB inhibitors based on Glycyrrhetinic acid (GA) derivatives containing aminophosphonate ester moieties were rationally designed and synthesized as well as evaluated their antitumor activities using MTT assay.

Among them, compound 12e possessed excellent antitumor activities against the tested human cancer cell lines and showed low cytotoxicity toward to human normal liver cells. Moreover, 12e caused obvious loss of MMP and significantly induced ROS production, and displayed inhibition of cell migration against A549 cells in vitro. Importantly, 12e arrested the cell cycle at the S phases and ultimately induced cell apoptosis in A549 cells through blockage of NF-κB signaling pathway.

Molecular cell research,2019 02 11,"Lead (Pb) is a known nephrotoxicant that causes damage to proximal tubular cells. PERK pathway plays an important role in the pathogenesis of renal diseases, but its role in Pb-induced nephrotoxicity remains largely unknown. In this study, data showed that Pb could induce ER stress as shown by increased phosphorylation of PERK with subsequent activation of the eIF2α-ATF4-CHOP axis in primary rat proximal tubular (rPT) cells, indicating the activation of PERK-eIF2α-ATF4-CHOP pathway due to excessive ER stress. Pb-activated PERK pathway can be effectively inhibited by 4-phenylbutyric acid and PERK gene silencing, respectively; whereas continuously up-regulated by tunicamycin (TM) treatment. Moreover, Pb-induced apoptosis and inhibition of autophagic flux in rPT cells were significantly augmented and aggravated by co-treatment with TM, respectively. Pharmacological or genetic inhibition of the PERK pathway results in alleviation of apoptosis and restoration of autophagy inhibition in Pb-exposed rPT cells. Mechanistically, activation of PERK-eIF2α-ATF4-CHOP axis triggered by excessive ER stress in rPT cells leads to Pb-induced apoptosis and blockage of autophagic flux, resulting in nephrotoxicity.",A fresh look at cortical dopamine D2 receptor expressing neurons.,https://www.ncbi.nlm.nih.gov/pubmed/30528973,Pharmacological research,2019 05 14,"The dopamine D2 receptor (DRD2) remains the principal target of antipsychotic drugs used for the management of schizophrenia and other psychotic disorders. This receptor is highly expressed within the basal ganglia, more specifically the striatal caudate nucleus and the nucleus accumbens. The general functions, signaling and behavioral contributions of striatal DRD2 are well understood. However, the study of cortical DRD2 expression and functions has for the most part been restricted to a subset of pyramidal neurons and interneurons (e.g. parvalbumine positive) of the pre frontal cortex where DRD2 regulated local circuits are believed to contribute to the regulation of emotional and cognitive functions. The further investigations of cortical DRD2 functions have been hindered by relatively low receptor expression and the sensitivity of detection methods. Here we report recent findings by our group using high sensitivity approaches to map cortical DRD2 expression. Results from these investigations revealed different scales of heterogeneity within DRD2 expressing neurons. These variations affected the types of neurons expressing DRD2 as well as the co-expression of DRD2 with other receptors across several cortical regions. Furthermore several cortical regions showing higher clusters of DRD2 expressing neurons are involved in the regulation of emotional, cognitive and sensory functions that can be involved in the expression of psychotic symptoms. These findings underscore the need for a reexamination of cortical DRD2 mediated synaptic plasticity in the context of schizophrenia and other psychotic disorders.",Investigating spectroscopic and copper-binding characteristics of organic matter derived from sediments and suspended particles using EEM-PARAFAC combined with two-dimensional fluorescence/FTIR correlation analyses.,https://www.ncbi.nlm.nih.gov/pubmed/30528972,Chemosphere,2019 02 21,"Different environmental dynamics of sediment organic matter (SOM) and suspended particulate organic matter (SPOM) result in great disparities in characteristics and subsequent interactions with heavy metals. In this study, sediments and suspended particles were collected from two large and shallow lakes (Taihu and Hongze Lake) to study the difference in the characteristics and copper binding properties between SOM and SPOM through spectroscopy method. Our results showed that SPOM in Taihu Lake was dominated by autochthonous tyrosine-like substance and SOM was dominated by terrestrial humic-like substance, whereas SPOM in Hongze Lake was dominated by terrestrial humic-like substances. Furthermore, dissolved organic matter (DOM) in Taihu and Hongze Lake was controlled by autochthonous protein and terrestrial humic substances, respectively. Comparison of SPOM between these two lakes indicated that various organic matter sources could be responsible for the organic matter characteristics in suspended particles. Meanwhile, relatively higher binding affinities and more binding sites were observed for SPOM in both two lakes compared to SOM through two-dimensional correlation spectroscopy (2D-COS) analysis of synchronous fluorescence spectra. Moreover, 2D-COS analysis of FTIR spectra revealed that hydrophobic groups (i.e., phenolic groups) had higher binding affinity than hydrophilic groups (i.e., polysaccharide groups) for both SOM and SPOM. Our results provide a new angle for understanding the suspended particles in shallow lakes, which might play a more important role in the environmental behaviors of heavy metals, than has been previously thought."

Based on PCA patients' clinical features, we hypothesized that, in addition to early decreased integrity within the visuospatial network, patients with PCA would show increases in SN connectivity despite relative preservation of DMN.

Lack of compliance with the dosing schedule may result in recurrence of active wet macular degeneration, leading to irreversible vision impairment. Gene therapy providing sustained anti-vascular endothelial growth factor levels in the retina following a single injection could drastically reduce the treatment burden and improve visual outcomes. ADVM-022, an adeno-associated virus vector encoding aflibercept, is optimized for intravitreal delivery and strong protein expression.

All studies were conducted at 25 ± 1 °C temperature, 70 ± 5% relative humidity and a light cycle of 16 h in a climate room. The result of the Petri dish experiments showed that the supernatants had little or no effect on the egg stage, as less than 4% mortality was recorded. Depending on the bacterial supernatant, mortality in the other stages was 46-97% for larvae, 30-96% for protonymphs, 41-92% for deutonymphs, 92-100% for adult males and 46-93% for adult females. Control mortalities ranged from 1-7% for larvae, 2-9% for protonymphs, 4-10% for deutonymphs, 6-10% for adult males and 4-8% for adult females. Among supernatants tested, X. szentirmaii and X. nematophila were the most efficacious with mortality greater than 90% on the mobile stages of T. urticae. According to the results from pot experiments, the supernatants of X. szentirmaii and X. nematophila, singularly and in combination, significantly reduced the T. urticae population. However, the mixture of X. szentirmaii and X. nematophila supernatants did not increase efficiency to reduce T. urticae population compared to each supernatant alone. Further studies are warranted to find the active compound(s) in the supernatants of X. szentirmaii or and X. nematophila and assess whether the supernatant(s) has the potential of being a practical and economical control agent for T. urticae.",SOS genes contribute to Bac8c induced apoptosis-like death in Escherichia coli.,https://www.ncbi.nlm.nih.gov/pubmed/30528927,Biochimie,2019 02 26,"Antimicrobial peptides are one of the promising substitutes for conventional antibiotics. To examine their potential usefulness for controlling bacterial infections, the present study aimed to determine the induction of the self-destruction of Escherichia coli mediated by bac8c, which was modified from template peptide bactenecin. The potential of bac8c (RIWVIWRR) was reflected by the change in physiological following exposure, which led to the accumulation of reactive oxygen species (ROS) with an imbalance in the antioxidant system and damage to the intracellular lipids. In addition, bac8c-mediated death exhibited typical features to bacterial apoptosis-like death (ALD). The pathway was not enhanced in the absence of autocleavage of RecA and LexA, the SOS response proteins. We observed that elevated levels of intracellular ROS induced ALD, but this effect was insufficient before preceding RecA activation and LexA autocleavage. Furthermore, dinF, which encodes a member of the toxic compound extrusion (MATE) family, was evaluated to examine the role of the ALD pathway. dinF protein was required to accelerate the ALD-mediated bac8c in combination with RecA. Taken together, bac8c-mediated cell death underlies the severe SOS response, leading to RecA activation, LexA proteolysis, and dinF overexpression. Since then, overproduction of intracellular ROS facilitated the cell death.",Bullying victimization in typically developing and clinical high risk (CHR) adolescents: A multimodal imaging study.,https://www.ncbi.nlm.nih.gov/pubmed/30528926,Schizophrenia research,2019 06 10,"Bullying has been shown to increase the risk of developing a psychotic disorder.

It has been strongly suggested that saturated fat is not harmful and that polyunsaturated fat is either not beneficial or even harmful. Given that dietary lipids and fibre can influence serum lipids which are strongly linked to the risk of coronary artery disease I have reviewed recent evidence linking diet and serum lipids to confirm a diet-heart disease link. Over 84 studies have been included in a recent meta-analysis and meta-regression which examined the effects of changes in fat type on lipid levels. An absolute 1% reduction in saturated fat or trans fat intake as a percentage of energy with replacement by n-6 polyunsaturated fat would lead to a reduction in low density lipoprotein (LDL) cholesterol of 0.05 mmol/L. In most Western countries the difference in intake between the highest quintile and the lowest quintile of saturated fat is about 7%, so moving from the highest to the lowest quintile should lower LDL cholesterol by 0.35 mmol/L or about 10%. This change should lower cardiovascular disease rates by at least 10%. Replacing this amount of saturated fat with carbohydrate of average quality would lower LDL cholesterol by 0.21 mmol/L and increase fasting triglyceride by 0.17 mmol/L. This combination of effects would have a neutral effect on cardiovascular disease rates. However, replacement of trans fat appears to reduce disease rates and total mortality. Substituting low glycaemic index carbohydrates for high glycaemic index carbohydrates will lower triglyceride by 15-25% and reduce cardiovascular risk. Large doses of fish oil will lower triglyceride with a mean lowering of 0.45 mmol/L for a 3.5 g/day amount. Large doses of soluble fibre (3.5-7.0 g/day) lower LDL cholesterol by 0.2-0.35 mmol/L with Konjac glucomannan being the most effective per gram. Plant sterols or stanols lower LDL cholesterol by about 10% for a 2 g/day dose, while exercise and weight loss lower cardiovascular risk predominantly by lowering fasting triglyceride. In conclusion, diet lowers LDL cholesterol and triglyceride and dietary changes should be ultimately linked to a reduced risk of heart disease.",Intratumoral heterogeneity of esophageal squamous cell carcinoma and its clinical significance.,https://www.ncbi.nlm.nih.gov/pubmed/30528923,"Pathology, research and practice",2019 03 22,"Recent studies have shown that intratumoral heterogeneity is prevalent in esophageal squamous cell cancer (ESCC) based on DNA sequencing and chromosome analysis in multiple regions from the same tumor. This study aimed to investigate the expression of ZNF750, EP300, MTOR and KMT2D and their intratumoral heterogeneity (ITH) in patients with ESCC. A total of 106 cases, who underwent esophagectomy from 2008 to 2010, with two foci from each case, were tested by immunohistochemistry(IHC) as well as 12 cases were tested by RNAscope in this study.We found that 58/106 (54.72%), 66/106 (62.26%), 75/106 (70.75%%) of ESCC showed high expression of ZNF750, EP300, MTOR, respectively by IHC, and 8/12 (66.67%), 10/12 (83.33%), 4/12 (33.33%) and 6/12 (50%) showed high expression of ZNF750, EP300, MTOR and KMT2D, respectively by RNAscope. Multivariate analysis showed that MTOR expression was an independent infavorable prognostic factor of overall survival (OS) (HR = 1.921; P = 0.000). This study also found that 44/106(4151%), 37/106 (34.91%), 39/106(36.79%) of ESCC showed heterogeneous expression of ZNF750, EP300 and MTOR respectively by IHC, 8/12(66.67%), 8/12(66.67%), 4/12(33.33%), 4/12(33.33%) of ZNF750, EP300, MTOR and KMT2D respectively by RNAscope, IHC and RNAscope could successfully detect a high prevalence of ITH. In conclusion, findings of this study showed that ZNF750, EP300, MTOR and KMT2D heterogeneously expressed in ESCC. High expression of ZNF750 related to a better outcome, while EP300 and MTOR related to a poor prognosis.",Contribution of flow MRI in the therapeutic management of middle face high flow arteriovenous malformation: a case report.,https://www.ncbi.nlm.nih.gov/pubmed/30528922,"Journal of stomatology, oral and maxillofacial surgery",2018 12 11,"Backround:The radiosurgical management of high flow arteriovenous malformations (HFAVM) in the ""destructive"" stage requires a precise hemodynamic and anatomical assessment.

With the aim to achieve good ecological and chemical status of all European water bodies, the ""European Water Framework Directive"" (WFD) was enacted. With the framework, bioanalytical techniques have been recognized as an important aspect. However, there are limitations to the application of bioassays directly for water quality assessment. Such approaches often fail to identify pollutants of concern, since the defined priority and monitored pollutants often fail to explain the observed toxicity. In this study, we integrated an effect-based risk assessment with a zebrafish-based investigation strategy to evaluate water sample extracts and fractions collected from the Danube. Four tiered bioassays were implemented, namely RNA-level gene expression assay, protein-level ethoxyresorufin-O-deethylase (EROD) assay, cell-level micronucleus assay and organism-level fish embryo test (FET). The results show that teratogenicity and lethality during embryonic development might be induced by molecular or cellular damages mediated by the aryl hydrocarbon receptor (AhR) -mediated activity, estrogenic activity and genotoxic activity. With the combination of high-throughput fractionation, this effect-based strategy elucidated the major responsible mixtures of each specific toxic response. In particularly, the most toxic mixture in faction F4, covering a log Kow range from 2.83 to 3.42, was composed by 12 chemicals, which were then evaluated as a designed mixture. Our study applied tiered bioassays with zebrafish to avoid interspecies differences and highlights effect-based approaches to address toxic mixtures in water samples. This strategy can be applied for large throughput screenings to support the main toxic compounds identification in water quality assessment."

Thus, there is a compelling need to discover and engineer CYPs for terpenoid biosynthesis to fully realize their great potential for industrial application. This review article summarizes the current state of CYP discovery and engineering in terpenoid biosynthesis, focusing on recent synthetic biology approaches toward prototyping CYPs in heterologous hosts.

The electron-producing reaction via DIET is thermodynamically more favorable and exhibits a more negative Gibbs free energy value (-60.0 kJ/mol) than indirect hydrogen transfer (-33.4 kJ/mol). The Gompertz model indicated that the kinetic parameters exhibited linear correlations with graphene addition from 0.25 to 1.0 g/L, leading to the highest increase in peak biomethane production rate of 28%. Sedimentibacter (7.8% in abundance) and archaea Methanobacterium (71.1%) and Methanosarcina (11.3%) might be responsible for DIET.

Here, we identify miR-124 as a regulator of triglyceride (TG) metabolism. This study advances our knowledge of the role of miR-124 in human hepatoma cells. Transcriptional profiling of Huh7.5 cells overexpressing miR-124 reveals enrichment for host factors involved in fatty acid oxidation among repressed miRNA targets. In addition, miR-124 down-regulates arylacetamide deacetylase (AADAC) and adipose triglyceride lipase, lipases proposed to mediate breakdown of hepatic TG stores for lipoprotein assembly and mitochondrial β-oxidation. Consistent with the inhibition of TG and fatty acid catabolism, miR-124 expression promotes cellular TG accumulation. Interestingly, miR-124 inhibits the production of hepatitis C virus, a virus that hijacks lipid pathways during its life cycle. Antiviral activity of miR-124 is consistent with repression of AADAC, a pro-viral host factor.

RAPD better distinguished major S. suis CCs than the PCR-RFLP method. The assay was capable of simultaneously distinguishing CC1, CC16, CC25, CC28, CC104, CC221/234, and CC233/379. PCR-RFLP could not clearly differentiate among most CCs in this study except CC16.

Loss-of-EDTP is lethal at early developmental stages. Hypomorphic mutation of EDTP causes impaired muscle performance and shortened lifespan. Mutation of MTMR14, a mammalian homolog to EDTP, is associated with muscle fatigue in rodents and a rare genetic disease called centronuclear myopathy in humans. Despite the deleterious consequences, downregulation of MTMR14 promotes autophagy. It is proposed that selective downregulation of EDTP/MTMR14 in non-muscle tissues improves the survivorship to cellular wastes and extends lifespan. Here, we show that downregulation of EDTP in glial cells suppressed the expression of polyglutamine (polyQ) protein aggregates and improved survival. Downregulation of EDTP in glial cells also extended lifespan. These effects were not observed by targeting pan-neurons in the nervous system, suggesting the significance of tissue-specificity. Additionally, flies carrying an EDTP mutant had increased survival to prolonged anoxia and altered dynamics of polyQ expression. These data supported the proposal that selective downregulation of EDTP in non-muscle tissues improved survivorship to cellular protein aggregates and extended lifespan. Our findings suggest that EDTP/MTMR14 could be a novel molecular target for the treatment of neurodegeneration.",Muscular effort increases hand-blink reflex magnitude.,https://www.ncbi.nlm.nih.gov/pubmed/30528879,Neuroscience letters,2019 06 10,"Defensive motor responses elicited by sudden environmental stimuli are finely modulated by their behavioural relevance to maximise the organism's survival. One such response, the blink reflex evoked by intense electrical stimulation of the median nerve (Hand-Blink Reflex; HBR), has been extensively used to derive fine-grained maps of defensive peripersonal space. However, as other subcortical reflexes, the HBR might also be modulated by lower-level factors that do not bear direct relevance to the defensive value of blinking, thus posing methodological and interpretive problems. Here, we tested whether HBR magnitude is affected by the muscular effort present when holding the hand in certain postures. We found that HBR magnitude increases with muscular effort, an effect most likely mediated by the increased corticospinal drive. However, we found strong evidence that this effect is substantially smaller than the well-known effect of eye-hand proximity on HBR magnitude. Nonetheless, care should be taken in future experiments to avoid erroneous interpretations of the effects of muscular effort as indicators of behaviour relevance.",Bradykinin and interleukin-1β synergistically increase the expression of cyclooxygenase-2 through the RNA-binding protein HuR in rat dorsal root ganglion cells.,https://www.ncbi.nlm.nih.gov/pubmed/30528878,Neuroscience letters,2019 05 15,"Synergistic expression of cyclooxygenase-2 (COX-2) by interleukin-1β (IL-1β) and bradykinin (BK) in peri-sensory neurons results in the production of prostanoids, which affects sensory neuronal activity and responsiveness and causes hyperalgesia. To evaluate the effects of pro-inflammatory mediators on COX-2 expression, cultured rat dorsal root ganglion (DRG) cells were treated with IL-1β and BK, which caused persistent increased COX-2 expression. Co-treatment increased COX-2 transcriptional activities in an additive manner by a COX-2 promoter luciferase assay. Immunoprecipitated HuR, an RNA-binding protein, in co-treated DRG cells contained more COX-2 mRNA than that of the control. The synergistic effects of IL-1β and BK on COX-2 expression may be a result of RNA stabilization mediated by HuR in peri-sensory neurons. Multiple pro-inflammatory cytokines and mediators are produced during neurogenic inflammation and aberrant control of COX-2 mRNA turnover may be implicated in diseases including chronic inflammation, which results in inflammation-derived hyperalgesia around primary sensory neurons.",Fenamates inhibit human sodium channel Nav1.7 and Nav1.8.,https://www.ncbi.nlm.nih.gov/pubmed/30528877,Neuroscience letters,2019 05 29,"Fenamates are N-substituted anthranilic acid derivatives, clinically used as nonsteroidal anti-inflammatory drugs (NSAIDs) in fever, pain and inflammation treatments.

In this study, fenamates, including mefenamic acid, flufenamic acid and tolfenamic acid, were examined by whole-cell patch clamp techniques on the sodium channels hNav1.7 and hNav1.8, which are closely associated with pain. The results showed that the mefenamic acid, flufenamic acid, and tolfenamic acid inhibited the peak currents of hNav1.7 and hNav1.8 in CHO cells stably expressing hNav1.7 and hNav1.8. However, much lighter inhibition effects of hNav1.8 were registered in the experimental system.

Thus, fostering the intrinsic regenerative potential and minimizing neuronal cell death could be a promising therapeutic approach. Pyrroloquinoline quinone (PQQ) was previously reported for its neuroprotective and regenerative potential on peripheral nerves. Here, we investigated the ability of PQQ to induce neurite re-growth in a wound healing model on cultured cerebellar granular neurons (CGNs), an integral part of cerebellar circuitry, as one of the most affected areas following TBI. The neuroprotective effect was also examined utilizing K+/FCS deprivation-induced apoptosis model in CGNs. Resveratrol (RVT), an effective promoter of neuroprotection and regeneration both centrally and peripherally was also investigated separately and in combination with PQQ to establish a possible synergistic effect. RVT (5 μM) and PQQ (0.5 μM) showed a tendency to promote neurite re-growth in the wound healing assay, however the effect observed was statistically insignificant. Higher concentrations of PQQ (1 and 2 μM) were found to be less effective. Resveratrol did not affect neurite length in CGNs culture; however, it did significantly increase the number of viable CGNs. For the neuroprotective effect; PQQ and RVT showed a significant increase in the survival of CGNs following K+/FCS deprivation of culture. Thus, both compounds showed a tendency to support neurite outgrowth in addition to a significant neuroprotective effect, but no synergistic effect was detected.",Local application of MDL28170-loaded PCL film improves functional recovery by preserving survival of motor neurons after traumatic spinal cord injury.,https://www.ncbi.nlm.nih.gov/pubmed/30528875,Neuroscience letters,2019 05 15,"Neuronal death and organization degeneration can happen inordinately after spinal cord injury (SCI), which lead to nerve dysfunction.

The PCL film was non-toxic, biological compatibility, and had good neuron adhension and slow release characteristic. MDL28170 increased VSC4.1 motor neurons' viability under tunicamycin (an endoplasmic reticulum stress) induced injury. In a traumatic SCI rat model, MDL28170-loaded PCL film reduced the area of lesion cavity, and promoted recovery of locomotor behavior. Moreover, the expression of GAP-43 was upregulated after MDL28170-loaded PCL film treatment. Thus, our findings demonstrated that localized delivery of MDL28170 could promote SCI recovery by inhibiting endoplasmic reticulum stress, preserving survival of the motor neurons, which may point out a promising therapeutic target for treating SCI patient.",Heading in a new direction? Recommendations for future research on patient decision aids.,https://www.ncbi.nlm.nih.gov/pubmed/30528874,Patient education and counseling,2019 04 30,"Decision aids can improve a number of patient outcomes, but they are not commonly used in clinical practice. This commentary paper provides suggestions for potential next steps of decision aid research, with the aim to facilitate their implementation. We suggest to further standardise clinically meaningful outcomes and outcome measures that should be used to examine the impact of decision aids. Second, using mediation analysis and active control groups could help tease out and explore variables that influence decision aids' effectiveness to help healthcare providers decide when and how to use them in clinical practice. Third, effectiveness trials should be clearly reported and replicated to investigate under what circumstances decision aids work best. Specific checklists for decision aid trials should be used to ensure that all relevant factors are reported in detail. Addressing the above issues will help identify what specific components of decision aids are effective and should be implemented. We can then move towards conducting implementation trials which help increase the use of decision aids in ""real-world"" healthcare.","Addressing possible problems with patients' expectations, plans and decisions for the future: One strategy used by experienced clinicians in advance care planning conversations.",https://www.ncbi.nlm.nih.gov/pubmed/30528873,Patient education and counseling,2019 04 03,"Giving terminally ill people opportunities to participate in advance care planning involves tensions between: endorsing and supporting patients' expectations, plans and decisions, and addressing how realistic these are.

Nuclear factor kappa B (NF-κB) signaling facilitates the onset of microglia activation. However, the molecular mechanisms underlying the negative regulation of NF-κB remain to be fully elucidated. In the present study, our results indicated that H4R expression increased in a rat model of lipopolysaccharide (LPS)-induced CNS inflammation. Knockdown of H4R in microglia HAPI cells enhanced the production of cytokines following LPS stimulation. Co-immunoprecipitation experiments further revealed an interaction between H4R and tumor necrosis factor receptor-associated factor 6 (TRAF6) in microglia, which was verified both in vivo and in vitro. Our experimental results support our hypothesis that H4R interacts with TRAF6 to inhibit the release of inflammatory cytokines in LPS-induced microglia cells by decreasing TRAF6-mediated ubiquitination of K63. These findings provide theoretical and experimental evidence regarding the role of H4R in the microglia inflammatory response, which may aid in the development of novel treatments for inflammation.",Developmental Changes in EEG Phenotypes in a Mouse Model of Fragile X Syndrome.,https://www.ncbi.nlm.nih.gov/pubmed/30528856,Neuroscience,2019 03 18,"Fragile X Syndrome (FXS) is a leading genetic cause of autism and intellectual disabilities. Sensory-processing deficits are common in humans with FXS and an animal model, the Fmr1 knockout (KO) mouse, manifesting in the auditory system as debilitating hypersensitivity and abnormal electroencephalographic (EEG) and event-related potential (ERP) phenotypes. FXS is a neurodevelopmental disorder, but how EEG/ERP phenotypes change during development is unclear. Therefore, we characterized baseline and stimulus-evoked EEG in auditory and frontal cortex of developing (postnatal day (P) 21 and P30) and adult (P60) wildtype (WT) and Fmr1 KO mice with the FVB genetic background. We found that baseline gamma-band power and N1 amplitude of auditory ERP were increased in frontal cortex of Fmr1 KO mice during development and in adults. Baseline gamma power was increased in auditory cortex at P30. Genotype differences in stimulus-evoked gamma power were present in both cortical regions, but the direction and strength of the changes were age-dependent. These findings suggest that cortical deficits are present during early development and may contribute to sensory-processing deficits in FXS, which in turn may lead to anxiety and delayed language. Developmental changes in EEG measures indicate that observations at a single time-point during development are not reflective of FXS disease progression and highlight the need to identify developmental trajectories and optimal windows for treatment.",Nox4 Promotes Neural Stem/Precursor Cell Proliferation and Neurogenesis in the Hippocampus and Restores Memory Function Following Trimethyltin-Induced Injury.,https://www.ncbi.nlm.nih.gov/pubmed/30528855,Neuroscience,2019 03 18,"Reactive oxygen species (ROS) modulate the growth of neural stem/precursor cells (NS/PCs) and participate in hippocampus-associated learning and memory. However, the origin of these regulatory ROS in NS/PCs is not fully understood. In the present study, we found that Nox4, a ROS-producing NADPH oxidase family protein, is expressed in primary cultured NS/PCs and in those of the adult mouse brain. Nox inhibitors VAS 2870 and GKT137831 or Nox4 deletion attenuated bFGF-induced proliferation of cultured NS/PCs, while lentivirus-mediated Nox4 overexpression increased the production of H2O2, the phosphorylation of Akt, and the proliferation of cultured NS/PCs. Nox4 did not significantly affect the potential of cultured NS/PCs to differentiate into neurons or astrocytes. The histological and functional development of the hippocampus appeared normal in Nox4-/- mice. Although pathological and functional damages in the hippocampus induced by the neurotoxin trimethyltin were not significantly different between wild-type and Nox4-/- mice, the post-injury reactive proliferation of NS/PCs and neurogenesis in the subgranular zone (SGZ) of the dentate gyrus were significantly impaired in Nox4-/- animals. Restoration from the trimethyltin-induced impairment in recognition and spatial working memory was also significantly attenuated in Nox4-/- mice. Collectively, our findings suggest that Nox4 participates in NS/PC proliferation and neurogenesis in the hippocampus following injury, thereby helping to restore memory function.",Fatal atlantoaxial dislocation due to an odontoid synchondrosis fracture in a child with chromosome 9 abnormality: A case report.,https://www.ncbi.nlm.nih.gov/pubmed/30528850,Journal of forensic and legal medicine,2019 01 31,"A 5-year-old boy with a chromosome-9 abnormality and multiple external and visceral malformations was found in cardiopulmonary arrest during a regular visit to the hospital; he did not respond to cardiopulmonary resuscitation and died. An odontoid process fracture and calcification and fibrosis of the muscles around the superior cervical vertebra were observed during the autopsy. Postmortem computed tomography revealed an anterior dislocation of the atlas; odontoid synchondrosis fracture; and delayed, incomplete bony fusion of the odontoid process relative to his age. The cause of his death was a superior spinal cord injury. The tissue surrounding the upper cervical spine presented with myositis ossificans, suggesting a prior injury. He experienced a minor traffic accident 3 months before his death. It was concluded that the odontoid synchondrosis fracture occurred during the accident based on the incomplete bony fusion and atlantoaxial instability, which were consistent with the findings of myositis ossificans. Delayed fatal dislocation may then have occurred under the influence of a minor external force. Odontoid process abnormalities and atlantoaxial instability are common in patients with trisomy 21 and other congenital diseases; however, the condition's association with chromosome-9 abnormalities has not been reported. In children with various chromosomal abnormalities, periodic assessment of instability and morphology of the cervical spine, and a lowered examination threshold for the children at risk, could prove useful in the prevention injuries leading to fatality, and provide additional information to rule out abuse.",[Comparative ultrasound study of gastric emptying between an isotonic solution and a nutritional supplement].,https://www.ncbi.nlm.nih.gov/pubmed/30528849,Revista brasileira de anestesiologia,2019 04 01,Preoperative fasting may lead to undesirable effects in the surgical patient in whom there is a stimulus to ingesting clear liquids until 2hours before anesthesia.

Previously, we found Escherichia coli or lipopolysaccharides (LPS) can induce grooming behavior via activation of contact chemoreceptors on Drosophila wing. This suggested that specific taste receptors may contribute to this detection. In this study, we examined the perception of commercially available LPS on Drosophila wing chemoreceptors in grooming reflex. Behavioral tests conducted with bitter, sweet and salty gustation such as caffeine, sucrose and salt, using flies carrying a defect in one of their taste receptors related to the detection of bitter molecules (Gr66a, Gr33a), sugars (Gr5a, Gr64f), or salt (IR76b). LPS and tastants of each category were applied to wing sensilla of these taste defectflies and to wild-type Canton Special (CS) flies. Our results indicate that the grooming reflex induced by LPS requires a wide range of gustatory genes, and the inactivation of any of tested genes expressing cells causes a significant reduction of the behavior. This suggests that, while the grooming reflex is strongly regulated by cues perceived as aversive, other sapid cues traditionally related to sweet and salty tastes are also contributing to this behavior."

Currently, no gold standard of outcome choice for dermatology trials and reviews exists. We systematically assessed concordance between efficacy outcomes in a random sample of 10 Cochrane Skin systematic reviews and the 220 dermatology trials included. Reviews did not include 742 (68%) of the 1,086 trial outcomes. Of the 60 outcomes the reviews sought, 17 (28%) were not reported in any trial, while 12 were assessed in <50% of trials. For 11 of 23 (48%) primary review outcomes, meta-analysis was impossible, because trial outcomes were absent or unclear. This small overlap of review/trial outcomes could suggest that trials are not measuring the outcomes perceived to be the most important by patients, clinicians, systematic reviewers, and trialists. The lack of standardized outcome measures, poor reporting of outcomes in trials, and low concordance of outcomes between reviews and primary studies could be improved by the development and implementation of Core Outcome Sets.

Despite the high burden for the patients, pathogenetic pathways underlying HS alterations remain obscure. When we examined the HS cytokine pattern, IL-1β turned out to be a highly prominent cytokine, overexpressed even compared with psoriatic lesions. Analyses of IL-1β-induced transcriptome in various cell types showed overlapping profiles, with upregulations of molecules causing immune cell infiltration and extracellular matrix degradation, and of specific cytokines including IL-6, IL-32, and IL-36. Matching cellular IL-1 receptor levels, dermal fibroblasts showed both the strongest and broadest IL-1β response, which was not clearly shared or strengthened by other cytokines. The IL-1β signature was specifically present in HS lesions and could be reversed by application of IL-1 receptor antagonist. Search for blood parameters associated with IL-1β pathway activity in HS identified serum amyloid A, which was synergistically induced by IL-1β and IL-6 in hepatocytes. Consequently, strongly elevated blood serum amyloid A levels in HS correlated positively with the extent of inflammatory skin alterations. In summary, the IL-1β pathway represents a pathogenetic cascade, whose activity may be therapeutically targeted and monitored by blood SAA levels.",Neutrophil Extracellular Traps Induce Human Th17 Cells: Effect of Psoriasis-Associated TRAF3IP2 Genotype.,https://www.ncbi.nlm.nih.gov/pubmed/30528823,The Journal of investigative dermatology,2019 05 25,"Psoriasis lesions are rich in IL-17-producing T cells as well as neutrophils, which release webs of DNA-protein complexes known as neutrophil extracellular traps (NETs). Because we and others have observed increased NETosis in psoriatic lesions, we hypothesized that NETs contribute to increased T helper type 17 (Th17) cells in psoriasis. After stimulating peripheral blood mononuclear cells with anti-CD3/CD28 beads for 7 days, we found significantly higher percentages of CD3+CD4+IL-17+ (Th17) cells in the presence versus absence of NETs, as assessed by flow cytometry, IL-17 ELISA, and IL17A/F and RORC mRNAs. Memory, but not naïve, T cells were competent and monocytes were required for CD3/CD28-mediated Th17 induction, with or without NETs. Th17 induction was enhanced by the T allele of rs33980500 (T/C), a psoriasis risk-associated variant in the TRAF3IP2 gene encoding the D10N variant of Act1, a key mediator of IL-17 signal transduction. Global transcriptome analysis of CD3/CD28-stimulated peripheral blood mononuclear cells by RNA sequencing confirmed the stimulatory effects of NETs, demonstrated NET-induced enhancement of cytokine gene expression, and verified that the effect of Act1 D10N was greater in the presence of NETs. Collectively, these results implicate NETs and the Act1 D10N variant in human Th17 induction from peripheral blood mononuclear cells, with ramifications for immunogenetic studies of psoriasis and other autoimmune diseases.",Gain-of-Function Mutations in TRPM4 Activation Gate Cause Progressive Symmetric Erythrokeratodermia.,https://www.ncbi.nlm.nih.gov/pubmed/30528822,The Journal of investigative dermatology,2019 04 23,"Transient receptor potential (TRP) channels respond to various chemical and physical stimuli by mediating cation influx. The skin expresses abundant TRP channels of different subtypes, which play an essential role in the maintenance of skin functionality. Here, we report cases of mutations in TRPM4, which encodes TRPM4, a Ca2+-activated monovalent cation channel, as a cause of an autosomal dominant form of progressive symmetric erythrokeratodermia. In three separate families with progressive symmetric erythrokeratodermia, we identified two missense mutations (c.3099C>G and c.3119T>C) that produce p.Ile1033Met and p.Ile1040Thr, both of which are located in the S6 transmembrane domain of the TRPM4 protein. The substitutions are expected to directly affect activation gating of TRPM4 according to the cryo-EM structures. Electrophysiological studies of the mutants showed substantial hyperactivity, as evidenced by pronounced baseline activity, enhanced sensitivity to intracellular Ca2+, and an elevated resting membrane potential. In vitro studies showed enhanced proliferation in keratinocytes overexpressing either of the mutants. We also detected an up-regulation of markers for proliferation and differentiation of keratinocytes in the affected skin tissues. Our study identified TRPM4 as an important player in the pathogenesis of skin TRP channelopathies and a potential target for treatment of skin hyperkeratotic disorders.","The Opioid Crisis and Surgeons: National Survey of Prescribing Patterns and the Influence of Motivators, Experience, and Gender.",https://www.ncbi.nlm.nih.gov/pubmed/30528821,American journal of surgery,2019 05 26,Surgeons are the fifth largest prescribers of opioids in the US.

Both enzymes have been suggested as an alternative pathway for ammonia production during urea shortage. Urea was proved key in the transcriptional regulation of formamidases/amidases, connecting urea level to amide metabolism. In addition, different amidases have also been shown to be inhibited by urea, pointing to urea-regulation at the enzymatic level. Although amidases have been widely studied due to its biotechnological application in the hydrolysis of aliphatic amides, up to date, only two formamidases have been extensively characterized, belonging to Helicobacter pylori (HpyAmiF) and Bacillus cereus (BceAmiF). In this work, we report the first structure of an acyl-intermediate of BceAmiF. We also report the inhibition of BceAmiF by urea, together with mass spectrometry studies confirming the S-carbamoylation of BceAmiF after urea treatment. X-ray studies of urea-soaked BceAmiF crystals showed short- and long-range rearrangements affecting oligomerization interfaces. Since cysteine-based switches are known to occur in the regulation of different metabolic and signaling pathways, our results suggest a novel S-carbamoylation-switch for the regulation of BceAmiF. This finding could relate to previous observations of unexplained modifications in the catalytic cysteine of different nitrilase superfamily members and therefore extending this regulation mechanism to the whole nitrilase superfamily.",MiR-219 represses expression of dFMR1 in Drosophila melanogaster.,https://www.ncbi.nlm.nih.gov/pubmed/30528775,Life sciences,2019 03 01,"Fragile X mental retardation protein (FMRP) plays a vital role in mRNA trafficking and translation inhibition to regulate the synthesis of local proteins in neuronal axons and dendritic terminals.

In this study, the role of the zinc uptake regulator Zur in the susceptibility and oxidative stress response of A. baumannii to antibiotics was evaluated. Inactivation of zur increased the susceptibility of A. baumannii AB5075 to colistin, gentamicin, rifampicin and tigecycline. Furthermore, activities of superoxide dismutase and catalase decreased significantly in the Δzur mutant compared with the parental strain. Colistin, gentamicin, rifampicin and tigecycline raised the superoxide anion radical (·O2-) and hydrogen peroxide (H2O2) contents of the Δzur mutant compared with the parental strain. In addition, the antibiotics lowered glutathione and concomitantly raised glutathione disulphide levels in the Δzur mutant. All of the antibiotics, except tigecycline, significantly raised the NAD+/NADH and ADP/ATP ratios in A. baumannii. We conclude that decreased capability of the Δzur mutant to detoxify reactive oxygen species increased its susceptibility to antibiotics.",Autophosphorylation of F-actin binding domain of CaMKIIβ is required for fear learning.,https://www.ncbi.nlm.nih.gov/pubmed/30528771,Neurobiology of learning and memory,2019 05 22,"CaMKII is a pivotal kinase that plays essential roles in synaptic plasticity. Apart from its signaling function, the structural function of CaMKII is becoming clear. CaMKII - F-actin interaction stabilizes actin cytoskeleton in a dendritic spine. A transient autophosphorylation at the F-actin binding region during LTP releases CaMKII from F-actin and opens a brief time-window of actin reorganization. However, the physiological relevance of this finding in learning and memory was not presented. Using a knock-in (KI) mouse carrying phosphoblock mutations in the actin-binding domain of CaMKIIβ, we demonstrate that proper regulation of CaMKII - F-actin interaction is important for fear conditioning memory tasks.

While this is a worthwhile goal, it has yielded little progress in improved therapeutics in the last several decades in the field of mood disorders. Recent advancements in our understanding of pathophysiology suggests that an impairment of neuroplasticity may be a critical part of the development of neuropsychiatric disorders. Interventions that enhance or modulate neuroplasticity often reduce depressive symptoms when applied as stand-alone treatments. Unfortunately, when treatments are discontinued, the disease state often returns as patients relapse. However, treatments that enhance or modulate plasticity not only reduce symptom burden, but also may provide an opportune window wherein cognitive or behavioral interventions could be introduced to harness a state of enhanced neuroplasticity and lead to improved longer-term clinical outcomes. Here, we review the potential of synergistically combining plasticity-enhancing and behavioral therapies to develop novel translational treatment approaches for depression. After reviewing relevant neuroplasticity deficits in depression, we survey biological treatments that appear to reverse such deficits in humans, including N-methyl-D-aspartate receptor modulators (ketamine, D-cycloserine), electroconvulsive therapy, and transcranial brain stimulation. We then review evidence that either directly or indirectly supports the hypothesis that a robust enhancement of neuroplasticity through these methods might promote the uptake of cognitive and behavioral interventions to enhance longer-term treatment outcomes through a synergistic effect. We identify key missing pieces of evidence and discuss future directions to enhance this emerging line of research.",Clinical respiratory infections and pneumonia during the Hajj pilgrimage: A systematic review.,https://www.ncbi.nlm.nih.gov/pubmed/30528743,Travel medicine and infectious disease,2019 05 07,"The Islamic Hajj pilgrimage to Mecca is one of the world's largest annual mass gatherings.

E3 ubiquitin ligase JADE1 is stabilized by pVHL interaction through its plant homeodomains (PHDs). JADE1 acts as a renal tumor suppressor that promotes the ubiquitination and degradation of β-catenin by inhibiting canonical WNT signalling. Current study focuses on the structural characterization of reported missense mutations in pVHL through in silico approaches. The predicted 3-dimensional structures of pVHLWT, pVHLY98H, pVHLY112H, pVHLL118P and pVHLR167W were subjected to binding analysis against JADE1 through molecular docking and simulation assays. In all cases, JADE1 binding was observed at the β-domain, except pVHLL118P that exhibited binding with JADE1 through its α-domain. Our results signify that JADE1 stabilization is induced by pVHL α-domain, while β-domain is required for JADE1 binding. pVHL binding was mediated through β1 and β2-strands against the concave surface of the JADE1-PHD domain. The pVHL-JADE1 complex was evaluated to scrutinize the β-catenin-binding interface, which suggested the contribution of both α and β-domains of pVHL in β-catenin binding. The eleven-residue (Tyr30-Thr40) β-catenin segment exhibited association in a bipartite manner with pVHL-JADE1 complex. The presented model depicts a pVHL-JADE1 interface for the cooperative regulation of β-catenin binding. We propose that reduced JADE1 stabilization in case of pVHLL118P and pVHLR167W may correlate with the increased activity of β-catenin that may lead to renal cancer through β-catenin de-repression. Overall, β-catenin targeting mechanism coupled with the structural knowledge of JADE1-pVHL complex will provide better understanding of renal cancer pathogenesis.",MicroRNA-15 family targets the hedgehog signaling pathway during postnatal development of porcine intestine.,https://www.ncbi.nlm.nih.gov/pubmed/30528739,Biochemical and biophysical research communications,2018 12 27,The hedgehog signaling pathway is a crucial regulator of the postnatal intestinal development.

However, recent reports of successful clinical outcomes and regulatory approvals for graft-versus-host disease, Crohn's disease and critical limb ischemia have prompted a shift in this perspective. With hundreds of clinical trials involving MSCs currently underway and an increasing demand for large-scale manufacturing protocols, there is a critical need to develop standards that can be applied to processing methods and to establish consensus assays for both MSC processing control and MSC product release. Reference materials and validated, uniformly applied tests for quality control of MSC products are needed. Here, we review recent developments in MSC manufacturing technologies, release testing and potency assays. We conclude that, although MSCs hold considerable promise clinically, economies of scale have yet to be achieved although numerous bioreactor technologies for scalable production of MSCs exist. Additionally, rigorous disease-specific product testing and comprehensive understanding of mechanisms of action, which are linked to relevant process and product release potency assays, will be required to ensure that these therapies continue to be successful.",Paracervical Block as a Strategy to Reduce Postoperative Pain after Laparoscopic Hysterectomy: A Randomized Controlled Trial.,https://www.ncbi.nlm.nih.gov/pubmed/30528725,Journal of minimally invasive gynecology,2019 01 14,To determine if performing a paracervical block with .5% bupivacaine before laparoscopic hysterectomy reduces postoperative pain.,Influence of anterolateral ligament injuries on stability and second-look arthroscopic findings after allograft transtibial anterior cruciate ligament reconstruction.,https://www.ncbi.nlm.nih.gov/pubmed/30528724,The Knee,2019 04 08,The purpose of this study was to evaluate the influence of anterolateral ligament (ALL) injuries on stability and second-look arthroscopic findings after anterior cruciate ligament (ACL) reconstruction.,Clinical features and myofascial pain syndrome in older adults with knee osteoarthritis by sex and age distribution: A cross-sectional study.,https://www.ncbi.nlm.nih.gov/pubmed/30528723,The Knee,2019 04 08,"A source of myofascial pain and myofascial trigger points (MTrPs) in muscles of the knee area could play a crucial role in the management of pain in osteoarthritis patients.

Assessing aggression is challenging because aggression constitutes multiple subtraits, such as anger, reactive aggression, and overt aggression. Conventional methods of assessing aggression are susceptible to bias because they mainly rely upon self-reports. Thus, more objective methods that provide a multifaceted understanding of aggression in individuals are required. Here, we propose a supportive method of assessing specific aggression subtraits in Koreans using electroencephalography (EEG) and electrocardiography (ECG). Our evaluations and statistical analyses revealed that EEG and ECG signals in subjects responding to video cues that induced aggression are associated with aggression subtraits. In particular, we identified spectral differences in EEG signals in response to stimuli with situation-dependent aggression. The α and β signals of the Fp2 site (the right ventromedial prefrontal region) are highly associated with anger, reactive aggression, and overt aggression. Moreover, ECG signals are associated with anger and overt aggression. These results link neurobiological findings to psychological explanations of aggression and multiple aspects of human behavior. Our findings can potentially be applied to supportive assessment methods for psychological counseling or psychiatric diagnoses.",The Optimal Plasma Volume Status in Heart Failure in Relation to Clinical Outcome.,https://www.ncbi.nlm.nih.gov/pubmed/30528705,Journal of cardiac failure,2019 04 13,"Progressive plasma volume (PV) expansion is a hallmark of chronic heart failure (HF), ultimately contributing to decompensated heart failure.

Toxicology & pharmacology : CBP,2019 04 01,"This study investigated acute arsenic toxicity and bioconcentration capacity in Litopenaeus vannamei because it has been frequently exposed to lower salinities than its isosmotic point (25 g L-1). Juveniles (9.9 ± 0.4 g) were exposed to low (5-10 g L-1) and isosmotic salinity (25 g L-1) levels; As values were 30.8, 20.2, 16.8 and 13.9 mg L-1 at 5 g L-1; 30.4, 19.1, 16.8 and 14.8 mg L-1 at 10 g L-1; 31.5, 19.0, 15.0 and 11.9 mg L-1 at 25 g L-1 at 24, 48, 72 and 96 h LC50, respectively. No significant differences were found among As LC50 values calculated for different salinity levels and same exposure times, concluding that low salinity did not affect shrimp sensitivity to As. Likewise, no significant differences were observed in As bioconcentration in shrimp exposed to the same waterborne As and distinct salinity, supporting the results of acute toxicity. Bioconcentration factors of As maintained a relatively stable tendency where all values (0.8 ± 0.2 to 1.7 ± 0.4) were statistically comparable to 1, indicating that As was accumulated in a similar proportion to waterborne As concentration at three salinity levels. This study proposed 135.3 ± 12.1 μg L-1 for salinities from 5 to 25 g L-1 as provisional safe As concentration. According to these results, the hypothesis that sustains an effect of low salinity on As acute toxicity and its bioconcentration capacity cannot be acceptable. Therefore, the information provided allows knowing the threshold levels of As in water to avoid ecological and economic losses.","Influences of dietary selenomethionine exposure on tissue accumulation, blood biochemical profiles, gene expression and intestinal microbiota of Carassius auratus.",https://www.ncbi.nlm.nih.gov/pubmed/30528703,Comparative biochemistry and physiology. Toxicology & pharmacology : CBP,2019 04 01,"A 30-days feeding trail was conducted to determine the sensitivity of Carassius auratus to the toxicological effects of elevated dietary Selenomethionine (Se-Met). C. auratus averaging 23.56 ± 1.82 g were exposed to four Se-Met concentrations (mg Se/kg): 0 (Se-Met0), 5 (Se-Met5), 10 (Se-Met10) and 20 (Se-Met20) to estimate the effects on tissue selenium (Se) accumulation, blood biochemical profiles, transcript expression and intestinal microbiota. Se accumulated in the kidney, liver and muscle in a dose-dependent manner and followed this order: kidney > liver > muscle, the highest accumulation were obtained in kidney of Se-Met20 diet after 30 days of feeding. Serum contents of alanine transaminase (ALT), aspartate transaminase (AST) and alkaline phosphatase (ALP) in fish exposed to Se-Met20 group was significantly highest among Se-Met exposure groups. Hydrogen peroxide (H2O2) concentrations in liver were affected by dietary Se-Met exposures. Liver contents of total antioxidant capacity (TAC), catalase (CAT), glutathione peroxidase (GPx) and malondialdehyde (MDA) in fish exposure to Se-Met5 group was significantly highest among Se-Met exposure groups. Growth hormone receptor (GHR), insulin-like growth factor 1 (IGF-1) and antioxidant enzyme related genes including glutathione peroxidase (GPx), catalase (CAT) and glutathione S-transferase (GST) expression in liver were down-regulated with the concentration of Se-Met exposure groups. The results of high-throughput sequencing showed that gut microbial communities and hierarchy cluster heatmap analysis were significantly affected by Se-Met exposure. The abundances of Cetobacterium and Vibrio increased while fish exposed to Se-Met20 group. The abundance of Ralstonia increased when the Se-Met exposure dose reached 10 mg Se kg-1. The results suggested that the exposure to elevated dietary Se-Met may result toxic effects in C. auratus.","Responses of antioxidant defenses in the clam Mactra veneriformis to 2,2',4,4'‑tetrabromodiphenyl ether exposure.",https://www.ncbi.nlm.nih.gov/pubmed/30528702,Comparative biochemistry and physiology. Toxicology & pharmacology : CBP,2019 02 25,"Antioxidant enzymes play essential roles against oxidative stress caused by 2,2',4,4'-tetrabromodiphenyl ether (BDE-47), which is ubiquitous in marine environment and organisms. However, research on antioxidant responses to BDE-47 in marine bivalves is scarce. In this study, we identified the full-length cDNA of catalase (CAT), and glutathione peroxidase (GPx) in the clam Mactra veneriformis. Subsequently, the responses of CAT, GPx, and copper, zinc-superoxide dismutase (Cu, Zn-SOD) were investigated in the clams exposed to 0.1, 1, and 10 μg/L BDE-47 for 7 days, and then depurated in natural seawater for 3 days. MvCAT and MvGPx contained conserved sequences. The deduced amino acid sequences shared high similarity with CATs and GPxs in other mollusks. M. veneriformis accumulated BDE-47 in a dose-dependent manner and eliminated BDE-47 poorly. BDE-47 induced a time- and dose-dependent increase of malondialdehyde content. Both the dose and the duration had significant effect on mRNA expressions and activities of the three antioxidants. Cu, Zn-SOD responded to BDE-47 earlier than CAT and GPx. The antioxidant responses could recover after depuration. These results suggested that M. veneriformis could accumulate BDE-47 efficiently. Antioxidant enzymes were triggered to counter the oxidative stress generated by BDE-47. Cu, Zn-SOD acted as the first defense against oxidative stress, while CAT and GPx intervened later. This study is therefore helpful in understanding the antioxidant responses to PBDEs in marine bivalves.","Azinphos-methyl causes in Planorbarius corneus toxic effects on reproduction, offspring survival and B-esterases depending on the exposure time.",https://www.ncbi.nlm.nih.gov/pubmed/30528701,Comparative biochemistry and physiology. Toxicology & pharmacology : CBP,2019 02 25,"This work aimed to study in the freshwater gastropod Planorbarius corneus the effects of acute (2 days) and subchronic (14 days) exposures to an environmental concentration of the organophosphate azinphos-methyl on different reproductive parameters, offspring survival and B-esterase activities in gonads and in the whole organism soft tissue. The acute exposure inhibited only carboxylesterase activity in both tissues while the subchronic exposure also inhibited cholinesterase activity, decreased the number of hatched-eggs and increased offspring lethality (92%). On the other hand, B-esterases in gonads were more effective biomarkers than B-esterases in the whole organism due their inhibition appeared earlier in time (cholinesterase activity) and their activity remained inhibited for a longer time (carboxylesterase activity) when recovery studies were performed. We concluded that B-esterases and reproductive parameters can be used as effect biomarkers of aquatic contamination with azinphos-methyl. Our studies showed that a 14 days exposure to an environmental concentration of azinphos-methyl produced severe signs of toxicity in adult organisms, egg masses and juveniles that could cause negative effects at the population level in contaminated environments.","Evaluation of development, locomotor behavior, oxidative stress, immune responses and apoptosis in developing zebrafish (Danio rerio) exposed to TBECH (tetrabromoethylcyclohexane).",https://www.ncbi.nlm.nih.gov/pubmed/30528700,Comparative biochemistry and physiology. Toxicology & pharmacology : CBP,2019 02 25,"Tetrabromoethylcyclohexane (TBECH), as one emerging brominated flame retardants, is ubiquitous in the environment, including water and aquatic organisms. TBECH was found to exhibit endocrine-disrupting effects in different models, whereas a survey of comprehensive toxic effects of TBECH on zebrafish is limited. In the present study, zebrafish (Danio rerio) were waterborne exposed continuously to TBECH from embryonic stage (3 h post-fertilization (hpf)) to the time when the respective parameters were evaluated. Exposure to TBECH reduced hatchability of zebrafish embryos at 72 and 96 hpf, diminished heart rate of zebrafish larvae at 48 hpf, and increased malformation in zebrafish larvae at 96 hpf. In addition, exposure to TBECH diminished free swimming distance both in the light and under a photoperiod of 10 min light/10 min dark cycles in zebrafish larvae at 6 days post-fertilization (dpf). Moreover, exposure to TBECH elevated activities of superoxide dismutase (SOD) and catalase (CAT), malondialdehyde (MDA) content, whereas it reduced glutathione (GSH) content, in zebrafish larvae at 6 dpf. Accordingly, RT-qPCR analysis demonstrated that TBECH exposure increased the mRNA levels of sod1, sod2, cat, and gpx1 in zebrafish larvae at 6 dpf. With respect to the immune aspect, the mRNA levels of pro-inflammatory genes, including il-1b, il-6, il-8, and tnfa, in larval zebrafish at 6 dpf were increased by exposure to TBECH, while pretreatment with TBECH inhibited 24 h of exposure to LPS-stimulated elevation in the mRNA levels of the abovementioned four pro-inflammatory genes in zebrafish larvae at 6 dpf. Furthermore, TBECH treatment increased caspase-3 enzyme activities and regulated apoptosis-related genes in larval zebrafish at 6 dpf. Taken together, the data obtained in this study demonstrated that TBECH caused developmental and locomotor behavioral toxicity, immunotoxicity, oxidative stress and proapoptotic effects in early life zebrafish. The present study will help to understand the comprehensive toxicity of TBECH in zebrafish.",Effect of PD-L1 testing on the cost-effectiveness and budget impact of pembrolizumab for advanced urothelial carcinoma of the bladder in the United States.,https://www.ncbi.nlm.nih.gov/pubmed/30528699,Urologic oncology,2019 02 18,Our purpose was to evaluate the effect of PD-L1 testing on the cost-effectiveness of pembrolizumab for second-line treatment of advanced urothelial carcinoma in the bladder from the U.S. societal perspective.,Reducing unnecessary biopsies while detecting clinically significant prostate cancer including cribriform growth with the ERSPC Rotterdam risk calculator and 4Kscore.,https://www.ncbi.nlm.nih.gov/pubmed/30528698,Urologic oncology,2019 04 28,"The use of risk calculators predicting clinically significant prostate cancer (csCaP) on biopsy reduces unnecessary biopsies and overdiagnosis of indolent disease compared to a Prostate Specific Antigen (PSA) strategy.

The structures of the new compounds were elucidated by detailed spectroscopic analysis and by the comparison of their spectroscopic data with those reported in the literature. In addition, the absolute stereochemistry of the previously reported diepoxycembrene (9) was first time determined by the X-ray diffraction analysis. In bioassays, compounds 6-8 exhibited strong anti-inflammatory effect with IC50 values of 2.7, 4.7, and 4.2 μM, respectively, whereas compound 5 displayed cytotoxicity against several cancer cells with IC50 values ranging from 8.9 to 27.4 μM.

We have previously demonstrated that prenatal caffeine exposure (PCE) resulted in adrenal dysplasia. However, its molecular mechanism has not been clarified. In the present study, a rat model of intrauterine growth retardation (IUGR) was established by PCE, and offspring were sacrificed. Moreover, NCI-H295 A cells were used to confirm glucocorticoid-related molecular mechanism. Results showed that PCE fetal weight decreased, and the IUGR rate increased, while serum corticosterone levels increased but insulin-like growth factor 1 (IGF1) levels decreased. Fetal adrenals exhibited an activated glucocorticoid-activation system, and the downregulated expression of IGF1 signal pathway and steroidal synthetases. For adult rats, there was no significant change in the glucocorticoid-activation system in the PCE group, the IGF1 signal pathway showed increased trend, and the expression levels of adrenal steroidal synthetases were close to normal. The data in vitro showed that the cortisol of 1200 nM can inhibit the expression of adrenocortical cell steroidal synthetases and IGF1 signal pathway when compared with the control. Meanwhile, the glucocorticoid-activation system was activated while GR inhibitor mifepristone can reverse the effect of cortisol. Furthermore, cortisol can also promote GR into the nucleus after its activation. Based on these findings, we speculated that high concentrations of glucocorticoid in utero led to GR in the nucleus through its activation and then inhibited the IGF1 signaling pathway by activating the glucocorticoid-activation system, which could further downregulate steroid synthesis.",Protection versus rights: age of marriage versus age of sexual consent.,https://www.ncbi.nlm.nih.gov/pubmed/30528681,The Lancet. Child & adolescent health,2019 03 17,"As many governments worldwide have raised the legal age of marriage to 18 years, some are also considering raising the age of sexual consent. Without close-in-age exemptions, arguments to align the legal age of sexual consent with that of marriage would restrict the ability of adolescents to legally have sex. In contrast to international agreements that affirm 18 years as the minimum age for consent to marriage, international human-rights standards do not recommend specific age limits for sexual consent but urge recognition of adolescents as rights holders, including rights in relation to sexuality. The majority of the world's young people are having sex before the age of 18 years. Laws that increase the age of sexual consent can be harmful and are often used to curb adolescents' agency, including denial of adolescents' rights to make decisions about whether, when, and with whom to have sex. Such laws can also result in stigmatisation or criminalisation (or both) of individuals who have sex before marriage, and increase barriers to accessing sexual and reproductive health. By contrast, providing adolescents with appropriate information and services supports healthy development, agency, and empowerment around their rights, including the right to be informed about their bodies and the right to consent (or not) to sex. Raising the legal age of sexual consent risks restricting adolescents from accessing the health care they need to protect themselves, and there is no evidence that it prevents consensual sex or sexual coercion. Because the consideration to marry and to have sex are very different, the minimum ages need not be aligned.",Haloperidol affects coupling between QT and RR intervals in guinea pig isolated heart.,https://www.ncbi.nlm.nih.gov/pubmed/30528680,Journal of pharmacological sciences,2019 01 24,"Prolonged QT interval is an independent risk factor for development of ventricular arrhythmias. Haloperidol is one of the drugs inducing QT prolongation. Previous studies showed that haloperidol affects not only QT duration but also heart rate (RR interval). The present work focused on relationship between QT and RR and its changes under acute and chronic haloperidol administration. The study included 14 male guinea pigs divided into control and haloperidol-treated group. After 21-days administration of haloperidol or vehiculum, electrograms in isolated hearts were recorded. QT/RR and dQT/dRR coupling were calculated. Chronic haloperidol administration significantly decreases the coupling between QT and RR. Acute haloperidol exposure significantly decreases the dQT/dRR coupling in both treated and untreated guinea pig hearts. Flatter QT/RR relationship reveals a lack of QT adaptation to increased heart rate. It should be emphasized that in such situation ECG recording will not show significant QT prolongation evaluated according to clinical rules. However, if QT interval does not adapt to increased heart rate sufficiently, the risk of ventricular arrhythmias may be increased despite practically normal QT interval length. The results are supported by findings in biochemical analyses, which proved eligibility of the used model.",New concepts to reduce glucocorticoid toxicity.,https://www.ncbi.nlm.nih.gov/pubmed/30528678,"Joint, bone, spine : revue du rhumatisme",2019 01 14,"70 years after their first use, low-dose glucocorticoids are a common part of pharmacological rheumatoid arthritis treatment. This is due to their well-proven capacities in symptom severity and disease activity reduction, in particular when combined with a disease-modifying anti-rheumatic drug, such as methotrexate. Nevertheless, glucocorticoid administration, in long-term especially, is also seen critically because of its potential adverse conditions. In order to achieve a reduction in treatment-related adverse events, modern therapy regimes should take into consideration patients' risk factors and therefore be individual. The Glucocorticoid Toxicity Index is a method to measure side effects of glucocorticoid therapy objectively and will be central in future studies comparing different therapy regimes. Such a new therapy regime is modified-release prednisone, which - thanks to a different time of liberation - seems to capable of reducing morning stiffness much more effectively than conventional prednisone, whilst showing similar properties in disease activity reduction and safety. Still, confirmation of these first data in further trials will be necessary. Eventually, other innovative concepts are liposomal glucocorticoids, dissociated agonists of glucocorticoid receptors and intramuscular application of glucocorticoids. Though these approaches appear to be promising, additional research will be required.",The Learning Curve by Operative Time for Soft Tissue Balancing in Total Knee Arthroplasty Using Electronic Sensor Technology.,https://www.ncbi.nlm.nih.gov/pubmed/30528677,The Journal of arthroplasty,2019 04 24,Electronic sensor devices can provide an objective assessment of soft tissue balancing in total knee arthroplasty (TKA) which may potentially decrease postoperative pain.

Changes in normal miRNA expression have been linked to a number of pathological disease processes. Additionally, with aging, it is noted that there is dysregulation in the normal function of stem cell differentiation, bone formation/degradation, chondrocyte function, and muscle degeneration. Due to the change in expression of miRNA in degenerative musculoskeletal pathology, it is believed that these molecules may be at least partially responsible for cellular dysfunction. A number of miRNAs have already been identified to play a role in osteoarthritis, osteoporosis and sarcopenia. One miRNA that has become of interest recently is miRNA 141.

Reviews on cancer,2019 01 25,"In the last decade, it has become clear that anti-cancer therapy is more successful when it can also induce an immunogenic form of cancer cell death (ICD). ICD is an umbrella term covering several cell death modalities, including apoptosis and necroptosis. In general, ICD is characterized by the emission of damage-associated molecular patterns (DAMPs) and/or cytokines/chemokines, leading to the induction of strong anti-tumor immune responses. In experimental cancer therapy, new observations indicate that the immunogenicity of dying cancer cells can be improved by the use of biomaterials. In this review, after a brief overview of the basic principles of the concept of ICD and discussion of the potential use of DAMPs as biomarkers of therapy efficacy, we discuss an emerging role of nanomaterials as a promising strategy to modulate the immunogenicity of cancer cell death. We address how nanocarriers can be used to increase the immunogenicity of ICD and then turn our attention to their dual action. Nanocarriers can be used to increase the immunogenicity of dying cancer cells and to reduce the side effects of chemotherapy. Future studies will show whether biomaterials are truly an optimal strategy to modulate the immunogenicity of dying cancer cells and will provide the insights needed for the development of novel treatment strategies for cancer.",Is mitochondrial DNA copy number a good prognostic marker in resectable pancreatic cancer?,https://www.ncbi.nlm.nih.gov/pubmed/30528645,Pancreatology : official journal of the International Association of Pancreatology (IAP) ...

Levofloxacin (LVX) inhaled solution is already an effective option. In this study, the aim was the development of LVX-loaded PLGA microspheres (MS) for pulmonary administration as a dry powder. MS were prepared, for the first time, by a modified double emulsion solvent evaporation method with premix membrane homogenization. Aqueous phases were saturated with LVX and a fatty acid (lauric acid) was added to avoid the drug escaping from the organic phase. MS were characterized in terms of size, drug content, morphology and in vitro release properties. X-ray diffraction, Fourier-transform infrared spectroscopy, differential and gravimetric thermal analysis, and cytotoxicity analyses were performed. Results showed this new method increased the drug loading while maintaining an adequate (∼5 µm) particle size and controlled release. Compared to a solution for inhalation, these properties combined with the dry-powder nature of these MS will improve patient compliance. The incorporation of lauric acid was not advantageous because the particle size was higher and no improvements concerning the sustained release occurred. LVX was molecularly dispersed in the matrix, or it was in amorphous state, as confirmed by the physico-chemical analyses. Calu-3 cell viability assays demonstrated no cytotoxicity for these MS, making them a promising system for LVX pulmonary delivery.",Impact of Effective Detector Pixel and CT Voxel Size on Accurate Estimation of Blood Volume in Opacified Microvasculature.,https://www.ncbi.nlm.nih.gov/pubmed/30528631,Academic radiology,2018 12 11,"The purpose of this study was to determine the impact of effective detector-pixel-size and image voxel size on the accurate estimation of microvessel density (ratio of microvascular lumen volume/tissue volume) in an excised porcine myocardium specimen using microcomputed tomography (CT), and the ability of whole-body energy-integrating-detector (EID) CT and photon-counting-detector (PCD) CT to measure microvessel density in the same ex vivo specimen.",Advances in immunotherapy of type I diabetes.,https://www.ncbi.nlm.nih.gov/pubmed/30528629,Advanced drug delivery reviews,2019 06 10,"Type 1 diabetes mellitus (T1DM) is an autoimmune disease affecting 3 million individuals in the U.S. The pathogenesis of T1DM is driven by immune-mediated destruction of pancreatic β cells, the source of glucose regulator insulin. While T1DM can be successfully managed with insulin replacement therapy, approaches that can modify the underlying immuno-pathology of β cell destruction has been long sought after. Immunotherapy can attenuate T cell responses against β cell antigens. Given the detailed cellular and molecular definitions of T1DM immune responses, rational immunomodulation can be and have been developed in mouse models, and in some instances, tested in humans. The possibility of identifying individuals who are predisposed to T1DM through genotyping lend to the possibility of preventive vaccines. While much has been accomplished in delineating the mechanisms of immunotherapies, some of which are being tested in humans, long-term preservation of β cells and insulin independency has not been achieved. In this regard, the drug delivery field has much to offer in maximizing the benefits of immune modulators by optimizing spatiotemporal presentation of antigens and costimulatory signals.

Cardiac remodeling is initially adaptive; however, if sustained, it ultimately causes adverse clinical outcomes. Cardiomyocyte loss or hypertrophy, inflammation and fibrosis are hallmarks of cardiac remodeling.

It often coincides with myocardial infarction (MI) and heart failure (HF) which are also diseases in older adults. All three conditions share common cardiovascular risk factors. While hypertension and obesity are central risk factors for all three diseases, smoking and diabetes appear to have less impact on AF. To date, age is the single most important risk factor for AF in the general population. Further, epidemiological studies suggest a strong association of AF to MI and HF. The underlying pathophysiological mechanisms are complex and not fully understood. Both MI and HF can trigger development of AF, mainly by promoting structural and electrical atrial remodeling. On the other hand, AF facilitates HF and MI development via multiple mechanisms, resulting in a vicious circle of cardiac impairment and adverse cardiovascular prognosis.

However, the in vitro expansion of chondrocytes under standard culture conditions inevitably leads to the dedifferentiation of chondrocytes and contributes to suboptimal clinical outcomes. To address this challenge, we focused our efforts on developing an improved in vitro expansion protocol, which shortens the expansion time with decreased dedifferentiation. It is known that the tissue microenvironment plays a critical role in regulating the cellular functions of resident cells and provides guidance in tissue-specific regeneration. We hypothesized that chondrocyte extracellular matrix (ECM) mimics a native microenvironment and that it may support chondrocyte expansion in vitro. To test this hypothesis, we prepared decellularized ECMs from allogeneic human articular chondrocytes (HAC) (AC-ECM) and bone marrow stromal cells (BM-ECM) and studied their effects on the in vitro expansion of primary HAC. The differential composition and physical properties of these two ECMs were revealed by mass spectrometry and atomic force microscopy. Compared with standard tissue culture polystyrene (TCP) or BM-ECM, HAC cultured on AC-ECM proliferated faster and maintained the highest ratio of COL2A1/COL1A1. Furthermore, a pellet culture study demonstrated that cells expanded on AC-ECM produced a more cartilage-like ECM than cells expanded on BM-ECM or TCP. This is the first report on modulating chondrocyte expansion and dedifferentiation using cell type-specific ECM and on identifying AC-ECM as a preferred substrate for in vitro expansion of HAC cell-based therapies. STATEMENT OF SIGNIFICANCE: To reduce the dedifferentiation of chondrocytes during in vitro expansion, cell type-specific extracellular matrix (ECM), which mimics a native microenvironment, was prepared from human articular chondrocytes (AC-ECM) or bone marrow stromal cells (BM-ECM). As demonstrated by mass spectrometry and atomic force microscopy, AC-ECM and BM-ECM have differential ECM compositions and physical characteristics. Human articular chondrocytes (HAC) expanded faster and maintained a better chondrocyte phenotype on AC-ECM than on BM-ECM or a standard culture surface. AC-ECM has potential to be developed for expanding HAC for cell-based therapies.",Repurposing suramin for the treatment of breast cancer lung metastasis with glycol chitosan-based nanoparticles.,https://www.ncbi.nlm.nih.gov/pubmed/30528604,Acta biomaterialia,2019 02 06,"Suramin (SM), a drug for African sleeping sickness and river blindness therapy, has been investigated in various clinical trials for cancer therapy. However, SM was eventually withdrawn from the market because of its narrow therapeutic window and the side effects associated with multiple targets. In this work, we developed a simple but effective system based on a nontoxic dose of SM combined with a chemotherapeutic agent for the treatment of metastatic triple-negative breast cancer (TNBC). SM and glycol chitosan (GCS) formed nanogels because of the electrostatic effect, whereas doxorubicin (DOX) was incorporated into the system through the hydrophilic and hydrophobic interactions between DOX and GCS as well as the ionic interactions between DOX and SM to yield GCS-SM/DOX nanoparticles (NPs). GCS-SM/DOX NPs have a size of approximately 186 nm and a spherical morphology. In vitro experiments showed that GCS-SM NPs could effectively inhibit cancer cell migration and invasion, as well as angiogenesis. Furthermore, in a TNBC lung metastasis animal model, GCS-SM/DOX NPs significantly reduced tumor burden and extended the lifespan of animals, while not inducing cardio and renal toxicities associated with the DOX and SM, respectively. As all the components used in this system are biocompatible and easy for large-scale fabrication, the GCS-SM/DOX system is highly translatable for the metastatic breast cancer treatment. STATEMENT OF SIGNIFICANCE: The doxorubicin-loaded glycol chitosan-suramin nanoparticle (GCS-SM/DOX) is novel in the following aspects: SM acts as not only a gelator for the first time in the preparation of the nanoparticle but also an active pharmaceutical agent in the dosage form. GCS-SM/DOX NP significantly reduced tumor burden and extended the lifespan of animals with triple-negative breast cancer lung metastasis. GCS-SM/DOX NPs attenuate cardio and renal toxicities associated with the DOX and SM.

Among these antigens, Rv1983, Rv1986, Rv1987, and Rv1989c have been shown to be immunodominant in infected cattle; however, their diagnostic utility has not been evaluated in humans. In this study, we screened 87 overlapping synthetic peptides encoded by five RD2 proteins for diagnosing tuberculosis epitopes in 50 active tuberculosis (TB) cases, 31 non-tuberculosis patients and 36 healthy individuals. A pool of promising epitopes was then assessed for their diagnostic value in 233 suspected TB patients using a whole blood IFN-γ release assay. Only 10 peptides were recognized by more than 10% of active tuberculosis patients. The IFN-γ release responses to Rv1986-P9, P15, P16, Rv1988-P4, P11, and Rv1987-P11 were significantly higher in the active TB group than in the control groups (p<0.05). The whole blood IFN-γ release assay based on these epitopes yielded a sensitivity of 51% and a specificity of 85% in diagnosing active tuberculosis, and the corresponding results using the T-SPOT.TB assay were 76% and 75%, respectively.

Existing computational methods rely on approximate descriptions of the components of the system or their interactions, and thus are unable to identify residue- or lipid-specific contributions. Our rotational interaction energy profiling method allows rapid evaluation of an electrostatically optimal orientation of a protein for membrane association, as well as the residues or lipid species responsible for its favorability. This enables prediction of which aspects of the protein-membrane interaction to target experimentally, and thus the development of testable hypotheses, as well as providing efficient seeding of molecular dynamics simulations to further characterize the protein-membrane interaction. We illustrate our method on two proteins of the PIP3 cell signaling system, PTEN and PI3Kα.","Structural Basis for CD96 Immune Receptor Recognition of Nectin-like Protein-5, CD155.",https://www.ncbi.nlm.nih.gov/pubmed/30528596,"Structure (London, England : 1993)",2019 02 06,"CD96, DNAM-1, and TIGIT constitute a group of immunoglobulin superfamily receptors that are key regulators of tumor immune surveillance. Within this axis, CD96 recognizes the adhesion molecule nectin-like protein-5 (necl-5), although the molecular basis underpinning this interaction remains unclear. We show that the first immunoglobulin domain (D1) of CD96 is sufficient to mediate a robust interaction with necl-5, but not the DNAM-1 and TIGIT ligand, nectin-2. The crystal structure of CD96-D1 bound to the necl-5 ectodomain revealed that CD96 recognized necl-5 D1 via a conserved ""lock-and-key"" interaction observed across TIGIT:necl complexes. Specific necl-5 recognition was underpinned by a novel structural motif within CD96, namely an ""ancillary key"". Mutational analysis showed that this specific residue was critical for necl-5 binding, while simultaneously providing insights into the unique ligand specificity of CD96.",Structural Characterization of Biomolecules through Atomistic Simulations Guided by DEER Measurements.,https://www.ncbi.nlm.nih.gov/pubmed/30528595,"Structure (London, England : 1993)",2019 02 06,"Double electron-electron resonance (DEER) is a popular technique that exploits attached spin labels to probe the collective dynamics of biomolecules in a native environment. Like most spectroscopic approaches, DEER detects an ensemble of states accounting for biomolecular dynamics as well as the labels' intrinsic flexibility. Hence, the DEER data alone do not provide high-resolution structural information. To disentangle this variability, we introduce a minimally biased simulation method to sample a structural ensemble that reproduces multiple experimental signals within the uncertainty. In contrast to previous approaches, our method targets the raw data themselves, and thereby it brings forth an unbiased molecular interpretation of the experiments. After validation on the T4 lysozyme, we apply this technique to interpret recent DEER experiments on a membrane transporter binding protein (VcSiaP). The results highlight the large-scale conformational movement that occurs upon substrate binding and reveal that the unbound VcSiaP is more open in solution than the X-ray structure."
