Over the last 25 years since the discovery of the first linkage of genetic mutations to FA, its molecular genetic landscape has expanded tremendously as it became apparent that FA is a disease characterized by a defect in a specific DNA repair pathway responsible for the correction of covalent cross-links between the two complementary strands of the DNA double helix. This pathway has become increasingly complex, with the discovery of now over 20 FA-linked genes implicated in interstrand cross-link (ICL) repair. Moreover, gene products known to be involved in double-strand break (DSB) repair, mismatch repair (MMR), and nucleotide excision repair (NER) play roles in the ICL response and repair of associated DNA damage. While ICL repair is predominantly coupled with DNA replication, it also can occur in non-replicating cells. DNA damage accumulation and hematopoietic stem cell failure are thought to contribute to the increased inflammation and oxidative stress prevalent in FA. Adding to its confounding nature, certain FA gene products are also engaged in the response to replication stress, caused endogenously or by agents other than ICL-inducing drugs. In this review, we discuss the mechanistic aspects of the FA pathway and the molecular defects leading to elevated replication stress believed to underlie the cellular phenotypes and clinical features of FA.",Impact of the Gastro-Intestinal Bacterial Microbiome on Helicobacter-Associated Diseases.,https://www.ncbi.nlm.nih.gov/pubmed/30813360,"Healthcare (Basel, Switzerland)",2019 05 03,"Helicobacter pylori is a bacterium that selectively infects the gastric epithelium of half of the world population. The microbiome, community of microorganisms gained major interest over the last years, due to its modification associated to health and disease states. Even if most of these descriptions have focused on chronic disorders, this review describes the impact of the intestinal bacterial microbiome on host response to Helicobacter associated diseases. Microbiome has a direct impact on host cells, major barrier of the gastro-intestinal tract, but also an indirect impact on immune system stimulation, by enhancing or decreasing non-specific or adaptive response. In microbial infections, especially in precancerous lesions induced by Helicobacter pylori infection, these modifications could lead to different outcome. Associated to data focusing on the microbiome, transcriptomic analyses of the eukaryote response would lead to a complete understanding of these complex interactions and will allow to characterize innovative biomarkers and personalized therapies.",Protein-Based Nanostructures for Food Applications.,https://www.ncbi.nlm.nih.gov/pubmed/30813359,"Gels (Basel, Switzerland)",2019 04 30,"Proteins are receiving significant attention for the production of structures for the encapsulation of active compounds, aimed at their use in food products. Proteins are one of the most used biomaterials in the food industry due to their nutritional value, non-toxicity, biodegradability, and ability to create new textures, in particular, their ability to form gel particles that can go from macro- to nanoscale. This review points out the different techniques to obtain protein-based nanostructures and their use to encapsulate and release bioactive compounds, while also presenting some examples of food grade proteins, the mechanism of formation of the nanostructures, and the behavior under different conditions, such as in the gastrointestinal tract.",Evolutionary Implications of the microRNA- and piRNA Complement of Lepidodermella squamata (Gastrotricha).,https://www.ncbi.nlm.nih.gov/pubmed/30813358,Non-coding RNA,2019 04 21,"Gastrotrichs-'hairy bellies'-are microscopic free-living animals inhabiting marine and freshwater habitats. Based on morphological and early molecular analyses, gastrotrichs were placed close to nematodes, but recent phylogenomic analyses have suggested their close relationship to flatworms (Platyhelminthes) within Spiralia. Small non-coding RNA data on e.g., microRNAs (miRNAs) and PIWI-interacting RNAs (piRNA) may help to resolve this long-standing question. MiRNAs are short post-transcriptional gene regulators that together with piRNAs play key roles in development. In a 'multi-omics' approach we here used small-RNA sequencing, available transcriptome and genomic data to unravel the miRNA- and piRNA complements along with the RNAi (RNA interference) protein machinery of Lepidodermella squamata (Gastrotricha, Chaetonotida). We identified 52 miRNA genes representing 35 highly conserved miRNA families specific to Eumetazoa, Bilateria, Protostomia, and Spiralia, respectively, with overall high similarities to platyhelminth miRNA complements. In addition, we found four large piRNA clusters that also resemble flatworm piRNAs but not those earlier described for nematodes. Congruently, transcriptomic annotation revealed that the Lepidodermella protein machinery is highly similar to flatworms, too. Taken together, miRNA, piRNA, and protein data support a close relationship of gastrotrichs and flatworms.",Cardiac Biomarkers in the Emergency Department: The Role of Soluble ST2 (sST2) in Acute Heart Failure and Acute Coronary Syndrome-There is Meat on the Bone.,https://www.ncbi.nlm.nih.gov/pubmed/30813357,Journal of clinical medicine,2019 03 29,"Soluble ST2 (sST2) has recently emerged as a promising biomarker in the field of acute cardiovascular diseases. Several clinical studies have demonstrated a significant link between sST2 values and patients' outcome. Further, it has been found that higher levels of sST2 are associated with an increased risk of adverse left ventricular remodeling. Therefore, sST2 could represent a useful tool that could help the risk stratification and diagnostic and therapeutic work-up of patients admitted to an emergency department. With this review, based on recent literature, we have built sST2-assisted flowcharts applicable to three very common clinical scenarios of the emergency department: Acute heart failure, type 1, and type 2 acute myocardial infarction. In particular, we combined sST2 levels together with clinical and instrumental evaluation in order to offer a practical tool for emergency medicine physicians.",An Improvement in the Identification of the Centres of Checkerboard Targets in Point Clouds Using Terrestrial Laser Scanning.,https://www.ncbi.nlm.nih.gov/pubmed/30813356,"Sensors (Basel, Switzerland)",2019 04 04,"Measurement using terrestrial laser scanning is performed at several stations to measure an entire object. In order to obtain a complete and uniform point cloud, it is necessary to register each and every scan in one local or global coordinate system. One registration method is based on reference points-in this case, checkerboard targets. The aim of this research was to analyse the accuracy of checkerboard target identification and propose an algorithm to improve the accuracy of target centre identification, particularly for low-resolution and low-quality point clouds. The proposed solution is based on the geometric determination of the target centre. This work presents an outline of a new approach, designed by the author, to discuss the influence of the point cloud parameters on the process of checkerboard centre identification and to propose an improvement in target centre identification. The validation of the proposed solutions reveals that the difference between the typical automatic target identification and the proposed method amounts to a maximum of 6 mm for scans of different qualities. The proposed method may serve as an alternative to, or supplement for, checkerboard identification, particularly when the quality of these scans is not sufficient for automatic algorithms.",Taste Receptors: New Players in Sperm Biology.,https://www.ncbi.nlm.nih.gov/pubmed/30813355,International journal of molecular sciences,2019 06 07,"Taste receptors were first described as sensory receptors located on the tongue, where they are expressed in small clusters of specialized epithelial cells. However, more studies were published in recent years pointing to an expression of these proteins not only in the oral cavity but throughout the body and thus to a physiological role beyond the tongue. The recent observation that taste receptors and components of the coupled taste transduction cascade are also expressed during the different phases of spermatogenesis as well as in mature spermatozoa from mouse to humans and the overlap between the ligand spectrum of taste receptors with compounds in the male and female reproductive organs makes it reasonable to assume that sperm ""taste"" these different cues in their natural microenvironments. This assumption is assisted by the recent observations of a reproductive phenotype of different mouse lines carrying a targeted deletion of a taste receptor gene as well as the finding of a significant correlation between human male infertility and some polymorphisms in taste receptors genes. In this review, we depict recent findings on the role of taste receptors in male fertility, especially focusing on their possible involvement in mechanisms underlying spermatogenesis and post testicular sperm maturation. We also highlight the impact of genetic deletions of taste receptors, as well as their polymorphisms on male reproduction.",Emerging Therapies for Acute Myelogenus Leukemia Patients Targeting Apoptosis and Mitochondrial Metabolism.,https://www.ncbi.nlm.nih.gov/pubmed/30813354,Cancers,2019 03 29,"Acute Myelogenous Leukemia (AML) is a malignant disease of the hematopoietic cells, characterized by impaired differentiation and uncontrolled clonal expansion of myeloid progenitors/precursors, resulting in bone marrow failure and impaired normal hematopoiesis. AML comprises a heterogeneous group of malignancies, characterized by a combination of different somatic genetic abnormalities, some of which act as events driving leukemic development. Studies carried out in the last years have shown that AML cells invariably have abnormalities in one or more apoptotic pathways and have identified some components of the apoptotic pathway that can be targeted by specific drugs. Clinical results deriving from studies using B-cell lymphoma 2 (BCL-2) inhibitors in combination with standard AML agents, such as azacytidine, decitabine, low-dose cytarabine, provided promising results and strongly support the use of these agents in the treatment of AML patients, particularly of elderly patients. TNF-related apoptosis-inducing ligand (TRAIL) and its receptors are frequently deregulated in AML patients and their targeting may represent a promising strategy for development of new treatments. Altered mitochondrial metabolism is a common feature of AML cells, as supported through the discovery of mutations in the isocitrate dehydrogenase gene and in mitochondrial electron transport chain and of numerous abnormalities of oxidative metabolism existing in AML subgroups. Overall, these observations strongly support the view that the targeting of mitochondrial apoptotic or metabolic machinery is an appealing new therapeutic perspective in AML.",Big Data-Driven Cellular Information Detection and Coverage Identification.,https://www.ncbi.nlm.nih.gov/pubmed/30813353,"Sensors (Basel, Switzerland)",2019 04 15,"As one of the core data assets of telecom operators, base station almanac (BSA) plays an important role in the operation and maintenance of mobile networks. It is also an important source of data for the location-based service (LBS) providers. However, it is always less timely updated, nor it is accurate enough. Besides, it is not open to third parties. Conventional methods detect only the location of the base station (BS) which cannot satisfy the needs of network optimization and maintenance. Because of these drawbacks, in this paper, a big-data driven method of BSA information detection and cellular coverage identification is proposed. With the help of network-related data crowd sensed from the massive number of smartphone users in the live network, the algorithm can estimate more parameters of BSA with higher accuracy than conventional methods. The coverage capability of each cell was also identified in a granularity of small geographical grids. Computational results validate the proposed algorithm with higher performance and detection ability over the existing ones. The new method can be expected to improve the scope, accuracy, and timeliness of BSA, serving for wireless network optimization and maintenance as well as LBS service.",Phenethyl Isothiocyanate and Cisplatin Co-Encapsulated in a Liposomal Nanoparticle for Treatment of Non-Small Cell Lung Cancer.,https://www.ncbi.nlm.nih.gov/pubmed/30813352,"Molecules (Basel, Switzerland)",2019 06 13,"Lung cancer is the leading cause of cancer-related death in the Unites States, and approximately 85% of all lung cancers are classified as non-small cell lung cancer (NSCLC), which is extremely difficult to treat and its survival rate is low. After decades of clinical trials, the most effective treatments are still those that implement the first-generation platinum anticancer agent cisplatin (CDDP) in combination with other drugs. We previously demonstrated that the naturally-occurring compound phenethyl isothiocyanate (PEITC) can be used to sensitize NSCLC cells to CDDP. Furthermore, co-encapsulation of PEITC and CDDP in liposomes enhances their toxicity toward NSCLC cells. We here optimize liposomal-PEITC-CDDP, demonstrate the release of PEITC and CDDP from the nanoparticle, and show that liposomal-PEITC-CDDP is much more toxic toward both A549 and H596 human NSCLC cell lines than toward WI-38 and BEAS-2B human normal lung cell lines. Thus, we have prepared an efficacious therapy that has significantly higher toxicity toward cancer cell lines than normal cell lines."

A red perovskite LED (PeLED) composite film was fabricated which featured a maximum luminance value of 657 cd/m² at 8 V. We fabricated white PeLEDs by combining hole transporting layer material emission, perovskite⁻polymer composite material PAN:CsPbBr2.5I0.5, and pure inorganic perovskite CsPbBr₃ as a luminescent layer. The maximum luminance of the device was 360 cd/m² at 7 V, and the color coordinate was (0.31, 0.36).

We also analyzed the knowledge, attitude, and practices related to these infections. Methods: A cross-sectional study using the quota-sampling method was conducted in three cities from March 2016 to February 2017. A total of 3320 participants (40.7% men and 59.3% women) were enrolled in the study, of whom, 1124, 1015, and 1181 were from Yinchuan, Urumchi, and Shanghai, respectively. Data on the included subjects were collected using a self-administered questionnaire. Results: We found that 3.2% and 22.6% of all subjects lacked knowledge regarding the identification and prevention of RTIs, respectively. More than 80% of the participants approved of developing RTI surveillance and taking RTI-related courses. While 45.1% of the respondents changed their underwear every 2⁻3 days, 49.0% cleaned their genitals daily, and 34.9% reported taking a bath daily. Among contraceptive users, 47.4% and 29.7% used condoms and IUDs (intrauterine devices), respectively. Overall, 48.2% of the participants had laboratory-confirmed sexually transmitted infections, and 19.7% of the female participants had endogenous infections. After controlling the socio-demographic variables, participants who cleaned their genitals and took a bath less frequently, as well as used condoms or pills had a lower prevalence of sexually transmitted infections, while those who were unwilling to take RTI-related courses and changed their underwear less frequently were more likely to contract sexually transmitted infections. While women who were unwilling to take RTI-related courses had a lower prevalence of endogenous infections, those with more children had a higher prevalence. Conclusion: The status of RTIs among the internal-migrant population of reproductive-age is not optimistic and is related to multiple factors. We believe this study will contribute to improving the knowledge, attitude, and practices related to RTIs.",Interesterified Fats Induce Deleterious Effects on Adipose Tissue and Liver in LDLr-KO Mice.,https://www.ncbi.nlm.nih.gov/pubmed/30813339,Nutrients,2019 05 02,"Interesterified fats are being widely used by the food industry in an attempt to replace trans fatty acids. The effect of interesterified fats containing palmitic or stearic acids on lipid metabolism and inflammatory signaling pathways in adipose and hepatic tissues was evaluated. Male LDLr-KO mice were fed a high-fat diet containing polyunsaturated (PUFA), palmitic (PALM), palmitic interesterified (PALM INTER), stearic (STEAR), or stearic interesterified (STEAR INTER) fats for 16 weeks. The expression of genes and protein levels involved in lipid metabolism and inflammatory processes in liver and white adipose tissue was determined by quantitative RT-PCR and by Western blot, respectively. The infiltration of inflammatory cells in hepatic and adipose tissues was determined by eosin and hematoxylin, while liver collagen content was determined by Sirius Red staining. Both interesterified fats increased liver collagen content and JNK phosphorylation. Additionally, the STEAR INTER group developed nonalcoholic steatohepatitis (NASH) associated with higher neutrophil infiltration. PALM INTER induced adipose tissue expansion and enlargement of adipocytes. Furthermore, PALM INTER triggered increased IKK phosphorylation and TNFα protein content, conditions associated with the upstream activation of the NFkB signaling pathway. STEAR INTER induced NASH, while PALM INTER triggered hepatic fibrosis and adipocyte hypertrophy with inflammatory response in LDLr-KO mice.",Alternative Process Routes to Manufacture Porous Ceramics-Opportunities and Challenges.,https://www.ncbi.nlm.nih.gov/pubmed/30813338,"Materials (Basel, Switzerland)",2019 04 01,"Porous ceramics can be realized by different methods and are used for various applications such as cross-flow membranes or wall-flow filters, porous burners, solar receivers, structural design elements, or catalytic supports. Within this paper, three different alternative process routes are presented, which can be used to manufacture porous ceramic components with different properties or even graded porosity. The first process route is based on additive manufacturing (AM) of macro porous ceramic components. The second route is based on AM of a polymeric template, which is used to realize porous ceramic components via replica technique. The third process route is based on an AM technology, which allows the manufacturing of multimaterial or multiproperty ceramic components, like components with dense and porous volumes in one complex-shaped component.",Long-Term Whole Grain Wheat and Rye Intake Reflected by Adipose Tissue Alkylresorcinols and Breast Cancer: A Case-Cohort Study.,https://www.ncbi.nlm.nih.gov/pubmed/30813337,Nutrients,2019 05 02,"Whole grain rye (WGR) and whole grain wheat (WGW) have been suggested to protect against the development of breast cancer. In this study, we estimated long-term intake of WGR and WGW, using both a food frequency questionnaire (FFQ) and alkylresorcinol concentrations in adipose tissue biopsies, in relation to the risk of developing invasive breast cancer in a case-cohort study (n = 414 in the case group, n = 933 in the subcohort group) on the Danish ""Diet, Cancer and Health"" cohort. The median follow-up time of the subcohort was 5.3 years. Total WGR and WGW intake estimated with FFQ or reflected by total alkylresorcinol concentration in adipose tissue was not significantly associated with risk of breast cancer. However, after adjustment for total WGR and WGW intake, women in the highest quartile of relative WGR intake, reflected by the alkylresorcinol C17:0/C21:0 ratio, had a higher risk of overall breast cancer and estrogen-receptor-positive (ER+) breast cancer than women in the lowest quartile of relative WGR intake, while the risk of estrogen-receptor-negative (ER-) breast cancer incidence was unaffected. Similar results were obtained with the FFQ data. Based on these data, further investigation of the role of specific grain types in reducing or increasing breast cancer risk, and their overall impact on health, is warranted.",A GC-MS Protocol for Separating Endangered and Non-endangered Pterocarpus Wood Species.,https://www.ncbi.nlm.nih.gov/pubmed/30813336,"Molecules (Basel, Switzerland)",2019 06 13,"Pterocarpus santalinus and Pterocarpus tincorius are commonly used traded timber species of the genus Pterocarpus. P. santalinus has been listed in Appendix II of the Convention on International Trade in Endangered Species of Wild Fauna and Flora (CITES). As a non-CITES species, P. tincorius is also indiscriminately labeled as P. santalinus due to the similar macroscopic and microscopic features with P. santalinus. In order to understand the molecular discrimination between these easily confused species, xylarium heartwoods of these two species were extracted by three different kinds of solvents and analyzed using gas chromatography⁻mass spectrometry (GC-MS). Multivariate analyses were also applied for the selection of marker compounds that are distinctive between P. santalinus and P. tincorius. A total of twenty volatile compounds were detected and tentatively identified in three kinds of extracts, and these compounds included alcohols, stilbenoids, esters, aromatic hydrocarbons, ketones, miscellaneous, phenols, and flavonoids. GC-MS analyses also revealed that extraction solvents including ethanol and water (EW), ethyl acetate (EA), and benzene⁻ethanol (BE) gave the best chemotaxonomical discrimination in the chemical components and relative contents of the two Pterocarpus species. After chemometric analyses, EW displayed higher predictive accuracy (100%) than those of EA extract (83.33%) and BE extract (83.33%). Furthermore, spathulenol (17.58 min) and pterostilbene (23.65 min) were elucidated as the critical compounds for the separation of the EW extracts of P. santalinus and P. tinctorius. Thus, a protocol of GC-MS and multivariate analyses was developed to use for successfully distinguishing P. santalinus from P. tinctorius.",Mechanochemically Activated Aluminosilicate Clay Soils and their Application for Defluoridation and Pathogen Removal from Groundwater.,https://www.ncbi.nlm.nih.gov/pubmed/30813335,International journal of environmental research and public health,2019 04 22,"In this study, aluminosilicate rich clay soils were prepared through mechanochemical activation. The chemical and mineralogical properties were investigated using X-Ray Fluorescence (XRF) and X-ray diffraction (XRD). The functional groups, morphology and surface area were evaluated using Fourier Transform Infra-Red (FTIR), Scanning electron microscopy (SEM) and Brunauer-Emmett-Teller (BET) analysis. Batch experiments were used to evaluate its defluoridation efficiency while antibacterial activities were assessed using well diffusion method. Maximum adsorption capacity was found to be 1.87 mg/g with 32% fluoride removal. Fluoride adsorption was found to reduce in the presence of Cl-, PO₄2- and CO₃2- while it increased in the presence of SO₄2- and NO₃-. Adsorption data fitted well to Freundlich isotherms, hence, confirming heterogeneous multilayer adsorption. Kinetic studies revealed that fluoride adsorption fitted well to pseudo-second order model. The sorption of F- onto the clays' surface followed intra-particle diffusion mode. High correlation coefficient indicates that the sorption process was greatly controlled by particle diffusion while it is minimal in pore diffusion model. Antibacterial studies revealed no zone of inhibition for all the activated clays, hence indicating that they are not active against the bacterial strains of Escherichia coli used in this study. The results showed activated clays' potential for defluoridation. Its effectiveness in pathogen removal is limited. Hence further modifications of the clays' surfaces are hereby recommended.",Robust Construction Safety System (RCSS) for Collision Accidents Prevention on Construction Sites.,https://www.ncbi.nlm.nih.gov/pubmed/30813334,"Sensors (Basel, Switzerland)",2019 04 04,"A proximity warning system to detect the presence of a worker/workers and to warn heavy equipment operators is highly needed to prevent collision accidents at construction sites. In this paper, we developed a robust construction safety system (RCSS), which can activate warning devices and automatically halt heavy equipment, simultaneously, to prevent possible collision accidents. The proximity detection of this proposed system mainly relies on ultra-wideband (UWB) sensing technologies, which enable instantaneous and simultaneous alarms on (a) a worker's personal safety (personal protection unit (PPU)) device and (b) hazard area device (zone alert unit (ZAU)). This system also communicates with electronic control sensors (ECSs) installed on the heavy equipment to stop its maneuvering. Moreover, the RCSS has been interfaced with a global positioning system communication unit (GCU) to acquire real-time information of construction site resources and warning events. This enables effective management of construction site resources using an online user interface. The performance and effectiveness of the RCSS have been validated at laboratory scale as well as at real field (construction site and steel factory). Conclusively, the RCSS can significantly enhance construction site safety by pro-actively preventing collision of a worker/workers with heavy equipment.",Advances in Therapeutic Implications of Inorganic Drug Delivery Nano-Platforms for Cancer.,https://www.ncbi.nlm.nih.gov/pubmed/30813333,International journal of molecular sciences,2019 06 07,"Numerous nanoparticles drug delivery systems for therapeutic implications in cancer treatment are in preclinical development as conventional chemotherapy has several drawbacks. A chemotherapeutic approach requires high doses of chemotherapeutic agents with low bioavailability, non-specific targeting, and above all, development of multiple drug resistance. In recent years, inorganic nano-drug delivery platforms (NDDPs; with a metal core) have emerged as potential chemotherapeutic systems in oncology. One of the major goals of developing inorganic NDDPs is to effectively address the targeted anti-cancer drug(s) delivery related problems by carrying the therapeutic agents to desired tumors sites. In this current review, we delve into summarizing the recent developments in targeted release of anti-cancer drugs loaded in inorganic NDDPs such as mesoporous silica nanoparticles, carbon nanotubes, layered double hydroxides, superparamagnetic iron oxide nanoparticles and calcium phosphate nanoparticles together with highlighting their therapeutic performance at tumor sites.",Intelligent Deep Models Based on Scalograms of Electrocardiogram Signals for Biometrics.,https://www.ncbi.nlm.nih.gov/pubmed/30813332,"Sensors (Basel, Switzerland)",2019 04 15,"This paper conducts a comparative analysis of deep models in biometrics using scalogram of electrocardiogram (ECG). A scalogram is the absolute value of the continuous wavelet transform coefficients of a signal. Since biometrics using ECG signals are sensitive to noise, studies have been conducted by transforming signals into a frequency domain that is efficient for analyzing noisy signals. By transforming the signal from the time domain to the frequency domain using the wavelet, the 1-D signal becomes a 2-D matrix, and it could be analyzed at multiresolution. However, this process makes signal analysis morphologically complex. This means that existing simple classifiers could perform poorly. We investigate the possibility of using the scalogram of ECG as input to deep convolutional neural networks of deep learning, which exhibit optimal performance for the classification of morphological imagery. When training data is small or hardware is insufficient for training, transfer learning can be used with pretrained deep models to reduce learning time, and classify it well enough. In this paper, AlexNet, GoogLeNet, and ResNet are considered as deep models of convolutional neural network. The experiments are performed on two databases for performance evaluation. Physikalisch-Technische Bundesanstalt (PTB)-ECG is a well-known database, while Chosun University (CU)-ECG is directly built for this study using the developed ECG sensor. The ResNet was 0.73%-0.27% higher than AlexNet or GoogLeNet on PTB-ECG-and the ResNet was 0.94%-0.12% higher than AlexNet or GoogLeNet on CU-ECG."

Among these trends, it is of great significance to adapt AI technologies into the intelligent agricultural management. In smart agricultural aviation spraying, the droplets' distribution and deposition are important indexes for estimating effectiveness in plant protection process. However, conventional approaches are problematic, they lack adaptivity to environmental changes, and consumes non-reusable test materials. One example is that the machine vision algorithms they employ can't guarantee that the division of adhesive droplets thereby disabling the accurate measurement of critical parameters. To alleviate these problems, we put forward an intelligent visual droplet detection node which can adapt to the environment illumination change. Then, we propose a modified marker controllable watershed segmentation algorithm to segment those adhesive droplets, and calculate their characteristic parameters on the basis of the segmentation results, including number, coverage, coverage density, etc. Finally, we use the intelligent node to detect droplets, and then expound the situation that the droplet region is effectively segmented and marked. The intelligent node has better adaptability and robustness even under the condition of illumination changing. The large-scale distributed detection result indicates that our approach has good consistency with the non-recyclable water-sensitive paper approach. Our approach provides an intelligent and environmental friendly way of tests for spraying techniques, especially for plant protection with Unmanned Aerial Vehicles.",Effects of Pharmacological Thermogenic Adipocyte Activation on Metabolism and Atherosclerotic Plaque Regression.,https://www.ncbi.nlm.nih.gov/pubmed/30813320,Nutrients,2019 05 15,"Thermogenic adipocytes burn nutrients in order to produce heat. Upon activation, brown adipose tissue (BAT) clears vast amounts of lipids and glucose from the circulation and thus substantially lowers plasma lipid levels. As a consequence, BAT activation protects from the development of atherosclerosis. However, it is unclear if pharmacologic activation of BAT can be exploited therapeutically to reduce plaque burden in established atherosclerotic disease. Here we study the impact of thermogenic adipose tissues on plaque regression in a mouse model of atherosclerosis. Thermogenic adipocytes in atherosclerotic low-density lipoprotein (LDL) receptor (LDLR)-deficient mice were pharmacologically activated by dietary CL316,243 (CL) treatment for 4 weeks and the outcomes on metabolically active tissues, plasma lipids and atherosclerosis were analyzed. While the chronic activation of thermogenic adipocytes reduced adiposity, increased browning of white adipose tissue (WAT), altered liver gene expression, and reduced plasma triglyceride levels, atherosclerotic plaque burden remained unchanged. Our findings suggest that despite improving adiposity and plasma triglycerides, pharmacologic activation of thermogenic adipocytes is not able to reverse atherosclerosis in LDLR-deficient mice.",Reverse Engineering Cancer: Inferring Transcriptional Gene Signatures from Copy Number Aberrations with ICAro.,https://www.ncbi.nlm.nih.gov/pubmed/30813319,Cancers,2019 03 29,"The characterization of a gene product function is a process that involves multiple laboratory techniques in order to silence the gene itself and to understand the resulting cellular phenotype via several omics profiling. When it comes to tumor cells, usually the translation process from in vitro characterization results to human validation is a difficult journey. Here, we present a simple algorithm to extract mRNA signatures from cancer datasets, where a particular gene has been deleted at the genomic level, ICAro. The process is implemented as a two-step workflow. The first one employs several filters in order to select the two patient subsets: the inactivated one, where the target gene is deleted, and the control one, where large genomic rearrangements should be absent. The second step performs a signature extraction via a Differential Expression analysis and a complementary Random Forest approach to provide an additional gene ranking in terms of information loss. We benchmarked the system robustness on a panel of genes frequently deleted in cancers, where we validated the downregulation of target genes and found a correlation with signatures extracted with the L1000 tool, outperforming random sampling for two out of six L1000 classes. Furthermore, we present a use case correlation with a published transcriptomic experiment. In conclusion, deciphering the complex interactions of the tumor environment is a challenge that requires the integration of several experimental techniques in order to create reproducible results. We implemented a tool which could be of use when trying to find mRNA signatures related to a gene loss event to better understand its function or for a gene-loss associated biomarker research.",Wound Healing Potential of Spirulina Protein on CCD-986sk Cells.,https://www.ncbi.nlm.nih.gov/pubmed/30813318,Marine drugs,2019 04 01,"Wound healing is a dynamic and complex process. The proliferation and migration of dermal fibroblasts are crucial for wound healing. Recent studies have indicated that the extracts from Spirulina platensis have a positive potential for wound healing. However, its underlying mechanism is not fully understood. Our previous study showed that spirulina crude protein (SPCP) promoted the viability of human dermal fibroblast cell line (CCD-986sk cells). In this study, we further investigated the wound healing effect and corresponding mechanisms of SPCP on CCD-986sk cells. Bromodeoxyuridine (BrdU) assay showed that SPCP promoted the proliferation of CCD-986sk cells. The wound healing assay showed that SPCP promoted the migration of CCD-986sk cells. Furthermore, cell cycle analysis demonstrated that SPCP promoted CCD-986sk cells to enter S and G₂/M phases from G₀/G₁ phase. Western blot results showed that SPCP significantly upregulated the expression of cyclin D1, cyclin E, cyclin-dependent kinase 2 (Cdk2), cyclin-dependent kinase 4 (Cdk4), and cyclin-dependent kinase 6 (Cdk6), as well as inhibited the expression of CDK inhibitors p21 and p27 in CCD-986sk cells. In the meanwhile, SPCP promoted the phosphorylation and activation of phosphoinositide 3-kinase (PI3K) and protein kinase B (Akt). However, the phosphorylation of Akt was significantly blocked by PI3K inhibitor (LY294002), which in turn reduced the SPCP-induced proliferation and migration of CCD-986sk cells. Therefore, the results presenting in this study suggested that SPCP can promote the proliferation and migration of CCD-986sk cells; the PI3K/Akt signaling pathway play a positive and important role in these processes.",Chronic Rhinosinusitis in Cystic Fibrosis: Diagnosis and Medical Management.,https://www.ncbi.nlm.nih.gov/pubmed/30813317,"Medical sciences (Basel, Switzerland)",2019 03 29,"Chronic rhinosinusitis (CRS) is nearly ubiquitous in patients with cystic fibrosis (CF).

In spite of an extremely cold climate in addition to varied topographies, the polar aquatic regions are teeming with microbial life. Even in sub-glacial regions, cellular life has adapted to these extreme environments where perhaps there are traces of early microbes on Earth. As grazing by macrofauna is limited in most of these polar regions, viruses are being recognized for their role as important agents of mortality, thereby influencing the biogeochemical cycling of nutrients that, in turn, impact community dynamics at seasonal and spatial scales. Here, we review the viral diversity in aquatic polar regions that has been discovered in the last decade, most of which has been revealed by advances in genomics-enabled technologies, and we reflect on the vast extent of the still-to-be explored polar microbial diversity and its ""enigmatic virosphere"".",Structural and Dynamical Order of a Disordered Protein: Molecular Insights into Conformational Switching of PAGE4 at the Systems Level.,https://www.ncbi.nlm.nih.gov/pubmed/30813315,Biomolecules,2019 04 10,"Folded proteins show a high degree of structural order and undergo (fairly constrained) collective motions related to their functions. On the other hand, intrinsically disordered proteins (IDPs), while lacking a well-defined three-dimensional structure, do exhibit some structural and dynamical ordering, but are less constrained in their motions than folded proteins. The larger structural plasticity of IDPs emphasizes the importance of entropically driven motions. Many IDPs undergo function-related disorder-to-order transitions driven by their interaction with specific binding partners. As experimental techniques become more sensitive and become better integrated with computational simulations, we are beginning to see how the modest structural ordering and large amplitude collective motions of IDPs endow them with an ability to mediate multiple interactions with different partners in the cell. To illustrate these points, here, we use Prostate-associated gene 4 (PAGE4), an IDP implicated in prostate cancer (PCa) as an example. We first review our previous efforts using molecular dynamics simulations based on atomistic AWSEM to study the conformational dynamics of PAGE4 and how its motions change in its different physiologically relevant phosphorylated forms. Our simulations quantitatively reproduced experimental observations and revealed how structural and dynamical ordering are encoded in the sequence of PAGE4 and can be modulated by different extents of phosphorylation by the kinases HIPK1 and CLK2. This ordering is reflected in changing populations of certain secondary structural elements as well as in the regularity of its collective motions. These ordered features are directly correlated with the functional interactions of WT-PAGE4, HIPK1-PAGE4 and CLK2-PAGE4 with the AP-1 signaling axis. These interactions give rise to repeated transitions between (high HIPK1-PAGE4, low CLK2-PAGE4) and (low HIPK1-PAGE4, high CLK2-PAGE4) cell phenotypes, which possess differing sensitivities to the standard PCa therapies, such as androgen deprivation therapy (ADT). We argue that, although the structural plasticity of an IDP is important in promoting promiscuous interactions, the modulation of the structural ordering is important for sculpting its interactions so as to rewire with agility biomolecular interaction networks with significant functional consequences.",Optimal Shadowing Filter for a Positioning and Tracking Methodology with Limited Information.,https://www.ncbi.nlm.nih.gov/pubmed/30813314,"Sensors (Basel, Switzerland)",2019 04 04,"Positioning and tracking a moving target from limited positional information is a frequently-encountered problem. For given noisy observations of the target's position, one wants to estimate the true trajectory and reconstruct the full phase space including velocity and acceleration. The shadowing filter offers a robust methodology to achieve such an estimation and reconstruction. Here, we highlight and validate important merits of this methodology for real-life applications. In particular, we explore the filter's performance when dealing with correlated or uncorrelated noise, irregular sampling in time and how it can be optimised even when the true dynamics of the system are not known.",ICENET: An Information Centric Protocol for Big Data Wireless Sensor Networks.,https://www.ncbi.nlm.nih.gov/pubmed/30813313,"Sensors (Basel, Switzerland)",2019 04 04,"Wireless Sensors Networks (WSNs) are an essential element of the Internet of Things (IoT), and are the main producers of big data. Collecting a huge amount of data produced by a resource-constrained network is a very difficult task, presenting several challenges. Big data gathering involves not only periodic data sensing, but also the forwarding of queries and commands to the network. Conventional network protocols present unfeasible strategies for large-scale networks and may not be directly applicable to IoT environments. Information-Centric Networking is a revolutionary paradigm that can overcome such big data gathering challenges. In this work, we propose a soft-state information-centric protocol, ICENET (Information Centric protocol for sEnsor NETworks), for big data gathering in large-scale WSNs. ICENET can efficiently propagate user queries in a wireless network by using a soft-state recovery mechanism for lossy links. The scalability of our solution is evaluated in different network scenarios. Results show that the proposed protocol presents approximately 84% less overhead and a higher data delivery rate than the CoAP (Constrained Application Protocol), which is a popular protocol for IoT environments.",Microstructured and Degradable Bacterial Cellulose⁻Gelatin Composite Membranes: Mineralization Aspects and Biomedical Relevance.,https://www.ncbi.nlm.nih.gov/pubmed/30813312,"Nanomaterials (Basel, Switzerland)",2019 03 12,"Bacterial cellulose (BC)⁻gelatin (GEL) membranes were processed by successive periodate oxidation and a freeze-thawing/carbodiimide crosslinking procedure, first facilitating a Schiff-base reaction among respective aldehyde and hydroxyl groups, and later GEL stabilization and microstructuring. The formation of highly microporous structures within the GEL portion, with significant differences between bottom and top, was elucidated, and pores in the 27.6 ± 3 µm⁻108 ± 5 µm range were generated, exceeding the threshold value of ~10 µm sufficient for cell trafficking. During a relatively short (6 h) exhaustion procedure in supersaturated simulated body fluid solution, the membranes accommodated the combination of biologically relevant minerals, i.e., flake-like octacalcium phosphate (OCP) and (amorphous) apatite, onto their surface, forming a membrane with intensive swelling (650⁻1650%) and up to 90% weight loss in a 4-week period. The membranes´ 6-day eluates did not evoke any cytotoxic effects toward human fibroblast, MRC-5 cells. The same type of cells retained their morphology in direct contact with the membrane, attaching to the GEL porous site, while not attaching to the GEL thin-coated BC side, most probably due to combined, ablation effect of dominant β-sheet conformation and carbodiimide crosslinking. Together with arrested proliferation through the BC side, the membranes demonstrated beneficial properties for potential guided tissue regeneration (GTR) applications."

One of the main causes of the failure of an anticancer treatment is the development of drug resistance by cancer cells. Therefore, it is necessary to develop new drugs characterized by better pharmacological and toxicological profiles. Natural compounds can represent an optimal collection of bioactive molecules. Many natural compounds have been proven to possess anticancer effects in different types of tumors, but often the molecular mechanisms associated with their cytotoxicity are not completely understood. The endoplasmic reticulum (ER) is an organelle involved in multiple cellular processes. Alteration of ER homeostasis and its appropriate functioning originates a cascade of signaling events known as ER stress response or unfolded protein response (UPR). The UPR pathways involve three different sensors (protein kinase RNA(PKR)-like ER kinase (PERK), inositol requiring enzyme1α (IRE1) and activating transcription factor 6 (ATF6)) residing on the ER membranes. Although the main purpose of UPR is to restore this organelle's homeostasis, a persistent UPR can trigger cell death pathways such as apoptosis. There is a growing body of evidence showing that ER stress may play a role in the cytotoxicity of many natural compounds. In this review we present an overview of different plant-derived natural compounds, such as curcumin, resveratrol, green tea polyphenols, tocotrienols, and garcinia derivates, that exert their anticancer activity via ER stress modulation in different human cancers.",Magnesium Fluoride Forms Unique Protein Corona for Efficient Delivery of Doxorubicin into Breast Cancer Cells.,https://www.ncbi.nlm.nih.gov/pubmed/30813300,Toxics,2019 04 23,The efficacy of chemotherapy is undermined by adverse side effects and chemoresistance of target tissues.

These parameters were optimized by response surface methodology and triple-TOF-LC-MS-MS was selected as the analytical tool to identify and quantify the individual compounds. The optimum extraction conditions were 50% ethanol, 35 °C and pH 2.5, which resulted in values of 222.6 mg gallic acid equivalents (GAE)/100 g dry matter and 1948.1 µM trolox equivalent (TE)/g of dry matter for total phenolic content (TPC) and trolox equivalent antioxidant capacity (TEAC), respectively. The extraction of phenolic compounds by the conventional solvent method with agitation was influenced by temperature (p = 0.0073), and more strongly, by the content of ethanol in the extraction solution (p = 0.0007) while the pH did not show a great impact (p = 0.7961). On the other hand, the extraction of phenolic acids was affected by temperature (p = 0.0003) and by ethanol amount (p < 0.0001) but not by the pH values (p = 0.53). In addition, the percentage of ethanol influenced notably the extraction of both 4-vinylphenol (p = 0.0002) and the hydroxycinnamic acids (p = 0.0039). Finally, the main individual phenolic extracted with hydroethanolic mixtures was 4-vinylphenol (303.3 μg/kg DW) followed by spinacetin3-O-glucosyl-(1→6)-glucoside (86.2 μg/kg DW) and sinensetin (77.8 μg/kg DW).",Resorcinol Functionalized Gold Nanoparticles for Formaldehyde Colorimetric Detection.,https://www.ncbi.nlm.nih.gov/pubmed/30813298,"Nanomaterials (Basel, Switzerland)",2019 03 12,Gold nanoparticles functionalized with resorcinol moieties have been prepared and used for detecting formaldehyde both in solution and gas phases. The detection mechanism is based on the color change of the probe upon the aggregation of the nanoparticles induced by the polymerization of the resorcinol moieties in the presence of formaldehyde. A limit of detection of 0.5 ppm in solution has been determined. The probe can be deployed for the detection of formaldehyde emissions from composite wood boards.,In Situ Image Acquisition and Measurement of Microdroplets Based on Delay Triggering.,https://www.ncbi.nlm.nih.gov/pubmed/30813297,Micromachines,2019 04 10,"An in situ image acquisition apparatus based on delay triggering for visualizing microdroplets formation is described. The imaging system includes a charge-coupled device camera, a motion control card, a driving circuit, a time delay triggering circuit, and a light source. By adjusting the varying trigger delay time which is synchronized with respect to the signal for jetting, the steady sequential images of the droplet flying in free space can be captured real-time by the system. Several image processing steps are taken to measure the diameters and coordinates of the droplets. Also, the jetting speeds can be calculated according to the delay time interval. For glycerin/water (60:40, mass ratio), under the given conditions of the self-made pneumatically diaphragm-driven drop-on-demand inkjet apparatus, the average of diameter and volume are measured as 266.8 μm and 9944 pL, respectively, and the maximum average velocity of the microdroplets is 0.689 m/s. Finally, the imaging system is applied to measure the volume of 200 microsolder balls generated from the inkjet apparatus. The average diameter is 87.96 μm, and the relative standard deviation is 0.83%. The results show good reproducibility. Unlike previous stroboscopic techniques, the present in situ imaging system which is absence of instantaneous high intensity light employs two control signals to stimulate the microdroplet generator and the charge-coupled device (CCD) camera. Hence, the system can avoid the desynchronization problem of signals which control the strobe light-emitting diode (LED) light source and the camera in previous equipment. This technology is a reliable and cost-effective approach for capturing and measuring microdroplets.",Nondestructive Classification Analysis of Green Coffee Beans by Using Near-Infrared Spectroscopy.,https://www.ncbi.nlm.nih.gov/pubmed/30813296,"Foods (Basel, Switzerland)",2019 03 29,"Near-infrared spectroscopy (NIRS) is a powerful tool for the nondestructive evaluation of organic materials, and it has found widespread use in a variety of industries. In the food industry, it is important to know the district in which a particular food was produced. Therefore, in this study, we focused on determining the production area (five areas and three districts) of green coffee beans using classification analysis and NIRS. Soft independent modeling of class analogy (SIMCA) was applied as the classification method. Samples of green coffee beans produced in seven locations-Cuba, Ethiopia, Indonesia (Bari, Java, and Sumatra), Tanzania, and Yemen-were analyzed. These regions were selected since green coffee beans from these locations are commonly sold in Japan supermarkets. A good classification result was obtained with SIMCA for the seven green bean samples, although some samples were partly classified into several categories. Then, the model distance values of SIMCA were calculated and compared. A few model distance values were ~10; such small values may be the reason for misclassification. However, over a 73% correct classification rate could be achieved for the different kinds of green coffee beans using NIRS.",Casticin-Induced Inhibition of Cell Growth and Survival Are Mediated through the Dual Modulation of Akt/mTOR Signaling Cascade.,https://www.ncbi.nlm.nih.gov/pubmed/30813295,Cancers,2019 03 29,"The Akt/mTOR signaling cascade is a critical pathway involved in various physiological and pathological conditions, including regulation of cell proliferation, survival, invasion, and angiogenesis. In the present study, we investigated the anti-neoplastic effects of casticin (CTC), identified from the plant Vitex rotundifolia L., alone and/or in combination with BEZ-235, a dual Akt/mTOR inhibitor in human tumor cells. We found that CTC exerted a significant dose-dependent cytotoxicity and reduced cell proliferation in a variety of human tumor cells. Also, CTC effectively blocked the phosphorylation levels of Akt (Ser473) and mTOR (Ser2448) proteins as well as induced substantial apoptosis. Additionally treatment with CTC and BEZ-235 in conjunction resulted in a greater apoptotic effect than caused by either agent alone thus implicating the anti-neoplastic effects of this novel combination. Overall, the findings suggest that CTC can interfere with Akt/mTOR signaling cascade involved in tumorigenesis and can be used together with pharmacological agents targeting Akt/mTOR pathway.",Social Interaction Improved by Oxytocin in the Subclass of Autism with Comorbid Intellectual Disabilities.,https://www.ncbi.nlm.nih.gov/pubmed/30813294,"Diseases (Basel, Switzerland)",2019 04 30,"Approximately half of all autism spectrum disorder (ASD) individuals suffer from comorbid intellectual disabilities. Furthermore, the prevalence of epilepsy has been estimated to be 46% of patients with low intelligence quotient. It is important to investigate the therapeutic benefits and adverse effects of any recently developed drugs for this proportion of individuals with the so-called Kanner type of ASD. Therefore, we investigated the therapeutic and/or adverse effects of intranasal oxytocin (OT) administration, especially in adolescents and adults with ASD and comorbid intellectual disability and epilepsy, with regard to core symptoms of social deficits. We have already reported three randomized placebo-controlled trials (RCTs). However, we revisit results in our pilot studies from the view of comorbidity. Most of the intellectually disabled participants were found to be feasible participants of the RCT. We observed significantly more events regarded as reciprocal social interaction in the OT group compared with the placebo group. In the trial, no or little differences in adverse events were found between the OT and placebo arms, as found in some other reports. However, seizures were induced in three participants with medical history of epilepsy during or after OT treatment. In conclusion, we stress that behavioral changes in ASD patients with intellectual disabilities could be recognized not by the conventional measurements of ASD symptoms but by detailed evaluation of social interactions arising in daily-life situations.","Congenital Lactase Deficiency: Mutations, Functional and Biochemical Implications, and Future Perspectives.",https://www.ncbi.nlm.nih.gov/pubmed/30813293,Nutrients,2019 05 02,"Congenital lactase deficiency (CLD) is a severe autosomal recessive genetic disorder that affects the functional capacity of the intestinal protein lactase-phlorizin hydrolase (LPH). This disorder is diagnosed already during the first few days of the newborn's life due to the inability to digest lactose, the main carbohydrate in mammalian milk. The symptoms are similar to those in other carbohydrate malabsorption disorders, such as congenital sucrase-isomaltase deficiency, and include severe osmotic watery diarrhea. CLD is associated with mutations in the translated region of the LPH gene that elicit loss-of-function of LPH. The mutations occur in a homozygote or compound heterozygote pattern of inheritance and comprise missense mutations as well as mutations that lead to complete or partial truncations of crucial domains in LPH, such as those linked to the folding and transport-competence of LPH and to the catalytic domains. Nevertheless, the identification of the mutations in CLD is not paralleled by detailed genotype/protein phenotype analyses that would help unravel potential pathomechanisms underlying this severe disease. Here, we review the current knowledge of CLD mutations and discuss their potential impact on the structural and biosynthetic features of LPH. We also address the question of whether heterozygote carriers can be symptomatic for CLD and whether genetic testing is needed in view of the severity of the disease.","Design, Motivation and Evaluation of a Full-Resolution Optical Tactile Sensor.",https://www.ncbi.nlm.nih.gov/pubmed/30813292,"Sensors (Basel, Switzerland)",2019 04 04,"Human skin is capable of sensing various types of forces with high resolution and accuracy.

By embedding a random pattern within the material, the full resolution of the camera can be exploited. The design and the motivation of the proposed approach are discussed with respect to a simplified elasticity model. An artificial deep neural network is trained on experimental data to perform the tactile sensing task with high accuracy for a specific indenter, and with a spatial resolution and a sensing range comparable to the human fingertip."

Normally, only small amounts of luminal content pass the mucosa, however, if the control is broken it can lead to enhanced passage, which might damage the mucosa, leading to pathological conditions, such as inflammatory bowel disease (IBD). It is well established that genetic, environmental, and immunological factors all contribute in the pathogenesis of IBD, and a disturbed intestinal barrier function has become a hallmark of the disease. Genetical studies support the involvement of intestinal barrier as several susceptibility genes for IBD encode proteins with key functions in gut barrier and homeostasis. IBD patients are associated with loss in bacterial diversity and shifts in the microbiota, with a possible link to local inflammation. Furthermore, alterations of immune cells and several neuro-immune signaling pathways in the lamina propria have been demonstrated. An inappropriate immune activation might lead to mucosal inflammation, with elevated secretion of pro-inflammatory cytokines that can affect the epithelium and promote a leakier barrier. This review will focus on the main cells and molecular mechanisms in IBD and how these can be targeted in order to improve intestinal barrier function and reduce inflammation.",Effects of Eight Weeks of High Intensity Functional Training on Glucose Control and Body Composition among Overweight and Obese Adults.,https://www.ncbi.nlm.nih.gov/pubmed/30813279,"Sports (Basel, Switzerland)",2019 04 01,"High-intensity exercise has been found to positively influence glucose control, however, the effects of high-intensity functional training (HIFT) for overweight and obese sedentary adults without diabetes is unknown. The purpose of this study was to examine changes in body composition and glucose control from eight weeks of aerobic and resistance training (A-RT) compared to HIFT. Session time spent doing daily workouts was recorded for each group. Baseline and posttest measures included height, weight, waist circumference, dual X-ray absorptiometry (body fat percentage, fat mass, lean mass), and fasting blood glucose. Participants completing the intervention (78%, n = 9 per group) were 67% female, age = 26.8 ± 5.5 years, and had body mass index = 30.5 ± 2.9 kg/m². Fasting blood glucose and 2-h oral glucose tolerance tests were used as primary outcome variables. On average, the HIFT group spent significantly less time completing workouts per day and week (ps < 0.001). No significant differences were found for body composition or glucose variables within- or between-groups. Even though our findings did not provide significant differences between groups, future research may utilize the effect sizes from our study to conduct fully-powered trials comparing HIFT with other more traditional training modalities.",A Comparative Study of Fitness Levels among Norwegian Youth in 1988 and 2001.,https://www.ncbi.nlm.nih.gov/pubmed/30813278,"Sports (Basel, Switzerland)",2019 04 01,"We compared the fitness levels of cohorts of 15-year-old youth in 1988 and 2001 to ascertain whether there was a negative trend in fitness. The subjects were 15-year-old boys and girls from the same geographical area, n = 192 in 1988 and n = 191 in 2001. They participated voluntarily and could leave the project whenever they wished. The following variables were used to assess fitness: Maximal oxygen uptake, jump height, shoulder flexibility, and hamstring flexibility. Maximal oxygen uptake was estimated with submaximal ergometer cycling, jump height by the Sargent jump-and-reach test, shoulder flexibility as the distance between thumbs when doing straight-arm backwards circling while holding a broomstick, and hamstring flexibility by an active straight-leg-raise test. Differences between groups and quartiles were analyzed by Gosset's (Student's) t-test, using a significance level of 0.05. The two cohorts did show different levels of physical fitness. The 1988 group was 3.9 cm better on jump height and 4.2 cm better on shoulder flexibility, while the 2001 group had 3.3° better hamstring flexibility. The lowest performing quartile did less well in 2001 on oxygen uptake and jump height. We recommend an increased focus on improving fitness in low-performing adolescents.",Toward Digitalization of Maritime Transport?,https://www.ncbi.nlm.nih.gov/pubmed/30813277,"Sensors (Basel, Switzerland)",2019 04 04,"Although maritime transport is the backbone of world commerce, its digitalization lags significantly behind when we consider some basic facts. This work verifies the state-of-the-art as it currently applies to eight digital domains: Autonomous vehicles and robotics; artificial intelligence; big data; virtual reality, augmented and mixed reality; internet of things; the cloud and edge computing; digital security; and 3D printing and additive engineering. It also provides insight into each of the three sectors into which this industry has been divided: Ship design and shipbuilding; shipping; and ports. The work, based on a systematic literature review, demonstrates that there are domains on which almost no formal study has been done thus far and concludes that there are major areas that require attention in terms of research. It also illustrates the increasing interest on the subject, arising from the necessity of raising the maritime transport industry to the same level of digitalization as other industries.",Investigation of Micromachined Antenna Substrates Operating at 5 GHz for RF Energy Harvesting Applications.,https://www.ncbi.nlm.nih.gov/pubmed/30813276,Micromachines,2019 04 10,"This paper investigates micromachined antenna performance operating at 5 GHz for radio frequency (RF) energy harvesting applications by comparing different substrate materials and fabrication modes. The research aims to discover appropriate antenna designs that can be integrated with the rectifier circuit and fabricated in a CMOS (Complementary Metal-Oxide Semiconductor)-compatible process approach. Therefore, the investigation involves the comparison of three different micromachined antenna substrate materials, including micromachined Si surface, micromachined Si bulk with air gaps, and micromachined glass-surface antenna, as well as conventional RT/Duroid-5880 (Rogers Corp., Chandler, AZ, USA)-based antenna as the reference. The characteristics of the antennas have been analysed using CST-MWS (CST MICROWAVE STUDIO®-High Frequency EM Simulation Tool). The results show that the Si-surface micromachined antenna does not meet the parameter requirement for RF antenna specification. However, by creating an air gap on the Si substrate using a micro-electromechanical system (MEMS) process, the antenna performance could be improved. On the other hand, the glass-based antenna presents a good S11 parameter, wide bandwidth, VSWR (Voltage Standing Wave Ratio) ≤ 2, omnidirectional radiation pattern and acceptable maximum gain of >5 dB. The measurement results on the fabricated glass-based antenna show good agreement with the simulation results. The study on the alternative antenna substrates and structures is especially useful for the development of integrated patch antennas for RF energy harvesting systems.",Comparison of Conventional and Individualized 1-MET Values for Expressing Maximum Aerobic Metabolic Rate and Habitual Activity Related Energy Expenditure.,https://www.ncbi.nlm.nih.gov/pubmed/30813275,Nutrients,2019 05 02,"The maximum aerobic metabolic rate can be expressed in multiple metabolically equivalent tasks (MET), i.e., METmax. The purpose was to quantify the error when the conventional (3.5 mL∙kg-1∙min-1) compared to an individualized 1-MET-value is used for calculating METmax and estimating activity energy expenditure (AEE) in endurance-trained athletes (END) and active healthy controls (CON). The resting metabolic rate (RMR, indirect calorimetry) and aerobic metabolic capacity (spiroergometry) were assessed in 52 END (46% male, 27.9 ± 5.7 years) and 53 CON (45% male, 27.3 ± 4.6 years). METmax was calculated as the ratio of VO₂max over VO₂ during RMR (METmax_ind), and VO₂max over the conventional 1-MET-value (METmax_fix). AEE was estimated by multiplying published MET values with the individual and conventional 1-MET-values. Dependent t-tests were used to compare the different modes for calculating METmax and AEE (α = 0.05). In women and men CON, men END METmax_fix was significantly higher than METmax_ind (p < 0.01), whereas, in women END, no difference was found (p > 0.05). The conventional 1-MET-value significantly underestimated AEE in men and women CON, and men END (p < 0.05), but not in women END (p > 0.05). The conventional 1-MET-value appears inappropriate for determining the aerobic metabolic capacity and AEE in active and endurance-trained persons.","Host Resistance, Genomics and Population Dynamics in a Salmonella Enteritidis and Phage System.",https://www.ncbi.nlm.nih.gov/pubmed/30813274,Viruses,2019 04 02,"Bacteriophages represent an alternative solution to control bacterial infections. When interacting, bacteria and phage can evolve, and this relationship is described as antagonistic coevolution, a pattern that does not fit all models. In this work, the model consisted of a microcosm of Salmonella enterica serovar Enteritidis and φSan23 phage. Samples were taken for 12 days every 48 h. Bacteria and phage samples were collected; and isolated bacteria from each time point were challenged against phages from previous, contemporary, and subsequent time points. The phage plaque tests, with the genomics analyses, showed a mutational asymmetry dynamic in favor of the bacteria instead of antagonistic coevolution. This is important for future phage-therapy applications, so we decided to explore the population dynamics of Salmonella under different conditions: pressure of one phage, a combination of phages, and phages plus an antibiotic. The data from cultures with single and multiple phages, and antibiotics, were used to create a mathematical model exploring population and resistance dynamics of Salmonella under these treatments, suggesting a nonlethal, growth-inhibiting antibiotic may decrease resistance to phage-therapy cocktails. These data provide a deep insight into bacterial dynamics under different conditions and serve as additional criteria to select phages and antibiotics for phage-therapy.",A Spectroscopic Study of Tautomeric Equilibrium of Salicylideneaniline in ZSM-5 Zeolites.,https://www.ncbi.nlm.nih.gov/pubmed/30813273,"Molecules (Basel, Switzerland)",2019 06 13,"Salicylideneaniline (SA) sorbed in cation-exchanged M-ZSM-5 (M = H⁺, Li⁺, Na⁺, K⁺, Rb⁺, Cs⁺ and Zn2+) zeolites was studied by spectroscopic techniques assisted by quantum-chemical calculations. The nature of extra-framework cations present in the zeolite void was found to affect the spectral signature of the sorbed SA molecule that points to the shift of tautomeric equilibrium between the enol and keto forms. Small size cations, such as H⁺ and Li⁺, stabilize a cis-keto SA tautomer along with a enol one in the zeolite structure. The calculations indicate that the sorbed cis-keto tautomer may have the dipole large enough to be considered as a zwitterion. New features appearing in the spectra with the increase of the cation size were attributed to the presence of trans-keto SA tautomer, which up to now has been observed only in time-resolved spectroscopic experiments. A strong interaction of the molecule with cations in Zn-ZSM-5 zeolite results in the chelation of enol SA with the divalent Zn2+ ions. The results of the study suggest that the tautomeric equilibrium of molecules belonging to the Schiff base family can be tuned by the confinement in the nanoporous materials via a choice of topology of zeolite framework and the nature of extra-framework cations.",Chronic Pulmonary Aspergillosis in Patients with Underlying Respiratory Disorders in Cuba-A Pilot Study.,https://www.ncbi.nlm.nih.gov/pubmed/30813272,"Journal of fungi (Basel, Switzerland)",2019 04 18,"Chronic pulmonary aspergillosis (CPA) is a fungal infection with high mortality and morbidity rates. This disease is caused by several Aspergillus species and affects patients with an underlying respiratory condition. This pilot study aims to recognize CPA among patients with different respiratory diseases. Twenty-one out of 47 patients were classified as CPA based on the examination of clinical signs and symptoms, radiological findings, mycological culture of respiratory samples and analysis of Aspergillus IgG antibodies. There was a close association between high levels of Aspergillus IgG antibodies and the presence of cavities. Although Aspergillus flavus was the predominant species among clinical isolates, the number of isolates was small to reach conclusions on the prevalence of this species as main cause of CPA in Cuba. From the eleven evaluable patients for the treatment with itraconazole (Lozartil®), nine improved their health status while two did not show any recovery. This drug is included in the therapy schemes for aspergillosis in Cuba.",Tomato Chlorotic Spot Virus (TCSV) Putatively Incorporated a Genomic Segment of Groundnut Ringspot Virus (GRSV) Upon a Reassortment Event.,https://www.ncbi.nlm.nih.gov/pubmed/30813271,Viruses,2019 04 02,"Tomato chlorotic spot virus (TCSV) and groundnut ringspot virus (GRSV) share several genetic and biological traits. Both of them belong to the genus Tospovirus (family Peribunyaviridae), which is composed by viruses with tripartite RNA genome that infect plants and are transmitted by thrips (order Thysanoptera). Previous studies have suggested several reassortment events between these two viruses, and some speculated that they may share one of their genomic segments. To better understand the intimate evolutionary history of these two viruses, we sequenced the genomes of the first TCSV and GRSV isolates ever reported. Our analyses show that TCSV and GRSV isolates indeed share one of their genomic segments, suggesting that one of those viruses may have emerged upon a reassortment event. Based on a series of phylogenetic and nucleotide diversity analyses, we conclude that the parental genotype of the M segment of TCSV was either eliminated due to a reassortment with GRSV or it still remains to be identified."

Twenty-eight male adolescent volleyball players (15.5 ± 1.1 years (15⁻17 years); 73.2 ± 10.9 kg (55.3⁻100.1 kg) and 184.9 ± 8.4 cm (170⁻209 cm)) participated in this cross-sectional study. Concentric and eccentric peak torque of external and internal rotator muscles were measured, and conventional and functional strength balance ratios were calculated. The dominant limb presented significantly higher values for peak torque than the non-dominant limb of internal rotator muscles at concentric action assessed at 60°/s (48.7 ± 13.7 Nm and 43.9 ± 11.6 Nm, p = 0.01 and d value = 0.37) and at 240°/s (44.7 ± 11.2 Nm and 41.1 ± 11.0 Nm, p = 0.03 and d = 0.32). However, there was no difference in the peak torque of external rotator muscle between limbs for either angular speed. Regarding strength balance ratios, neither conventional (74.8 ± 14.3 for dominant limb and 80.1 ± 14.0 for non-dominant limb, p = 0.06 and d = 0.37) nor functional ratio (1.2 ± 0.4 for dominant limb and 1.3 ± 0.5 for non-dominant limb, p = 0.06 and d = 0.22) presented significant contralateral differences. Despite the short practice time, adolescent male volleyball athletes already have significant contralateral differences for internal rotator muscles and conventional ratio tends to be asymmetrical. Thus, preventive shoulder-strengthening programs, focused on the internal rotator muscles of the non-dominant limb, aiming to correct contralateral deficiency and conventional ratio, may be warranted for this population in the process of biological growth, maturation and development.",FPGA-Based Hybrid-Type Implementation of Quantized Neural Networks for Remote Sensing Applications.,https://www.ncbi.nlm.nih.gov/pubmed/30813259,"Sensors (Basel, Switzerland)",2019 04 04,"Recently, extensive convolutional neural network (CNN)-based methods have been used in remote sensing applications, such as object detection and classification, and have achieved significant improvements in performance. Furthermore, there are a lot of hardware implementation demands for remote sensing real-time processing applications. However, the operation and storage processes in floating-point models hinder the deployment of networks in hardware implements with limited resource and power budgets, such as field-programmable gate arrays (FPGAs) and application-specific integrated circuits (ASICs). To solve this problem, this paper focuses on optimizing the hardware design of CNN with low bit-width integers by quantization. First, a symmetric quantization scheme-based hybrid-type inference method was proposed, which uses the low bit-width integer to replace floating-point precision. Then, a training approach for the quantized network is introduced to reduce accuracy degradation. Finally, a processing engine (PE) with a low bit-width is proposed to optimize the hardware design of FPGA for remote sensing image classification. Besides, a fused-layer PE is also presented for state-of-the-art CNNs equipped with Batch-Normalization and LeakyRelu. The experiments performed on the Moving and Stationary Target Acquisition and Recognition (MSTAR) dataset using a graphics processing unit (GPU) demonstrate that the accuracy of 8-bit quantized model drops by about 1%, which is an acceptable accuracy loss. The accuracy result tested on FPGA is consistent with that of GPU. As for the resource consumptions of FPGA, the Look Up Table (LUT), Flip-flop (FF), Digital Signal Processor (DSP), and Block Random Access Memory (BRAM) are reduced by 46.21%, 43.84%, 45%, and 51%, respectively, compared with that of floating-point implementation.",Genome-Wide Comparative Analyses of Polyadenylation Signals in Eukaryotes Suggest a Possible Origin of the AAUAAA Signal.,https://www.ncbi.nlm.nih.gov/pubmed/30813258,International journal of molecular sciences,2019 06 07,"Pre-mRNA cleavage and polyadenylation is an essential step for almost all mRNA in eukaryotes. The cis-elements around the poly(A) sites, however, are very diverse among different organisms. We characterized the poly(A) signals of seven different species, and compared them with that of four well-studied organisms. We found that ciliates do not show any dominant poly(A) signal; a triplet (UAA) and tetramers (UAAA and GUAA) are dominant in diatoms and red alga, respectively; and green alga Ostreococcus uses UGUAA as its poly(A) signal. Spikemoss and moss use conserved AAUAAA signals that are similar to other land plants. Our analysis suggests that the first two bases (NN in NNUAAA) are likely degenerated whereas UAAA appears to be the core motif. Combined with other published results, it is suggested that the highly conserved poly(A) signal AAUAAA may be derived from UAA with an intermediate, putative UAAA, following a pathway of UAA→UAAA→AAUAAA.",A Sensor System for Detecting and Localizing Partial Discharges in Power Transformers with Improved Immunity to Interferences.,https://www.ncbi.nlm.nih.gov/pubmed/30813257,"Sensors (Basel, Switzerland)",2019 04 04,"The paper reports on the solution, principles, and application results related to a system for diagnosing main transformers in power plants via the radiofrequency method. The subject of the diagnostics is the occurrence of partial discharge activity in transformers. The technical solution of the system is characterized in the introductory section of the article. There then follows a description of the operating principle and the implemented novel advanced methods for signal detection and source localization. The results obtained from practical application of the system within the diagnostics of high-power transformers are presented as well. Because ambient electromagnetic disturbance was recognized as a major issue during the system development, novel detection methods were proposed, implemented, and verified. The principal approach utilizes an external radiofrequency sensor to detect outer impulse disturbance and to eliminate disturbance-triggered acquisitions, and it also ensures direct real-time visualization of the desired impulse signals. The ability of weak signal detection was verified via artificial impulse signal injection into the transformer. The developed detection methods were completed with localization techniques for signal source estimation. The desired impulse signal was detected and localized during full operation of the main transformer, despite the presence of strong electromagnetic interference.",Chemical Characterization and Antiplatelet Potential of Bioactive Extract from Tomato Pomace (Byproduct of Tomato Paste).,https://www.ncbi.nlm.nih.gov/pubmed/30813256,Nutrients,2019 05 02,"We examined the ability of tomato pomace extract (by-product) to affect platelet aggregation in healthy humans (clinical pilot study). In phase 1 the tolerance of participants (n = 15; 5 per dose level) ingesting tomato pomace extract across three dose levels (1, 2.5, and 10 g) was evaluated. Phase 2 was a single-blind, placebo-controlled, parallel design human (male, n = 99; 33 per group) pilot intervention trial investigating the acute and repeated dose effects (5 days) of different doses of tomato pomace extract (1 g, 2.5 g or placebo) on platelet aggregation ex vivo.

In contrast to simplistic spoofing, the induced spoofing captures the victim tracking loops by gradually adjusting it's parameters, e.g., code phase and power. Then the victims smoothly deviates from the correct position or timing. Therefore, it is more difficult to detect the induced spoofing than the simplistic one. In this paper, by utilizing the dynamic nature of such gradual adjustment process, an induced spoofing detection method is proposed based on the S-curve-bias (SCB). Firstly, SCB in the inducing process is theoretically derived. Then, in order to detect the induced spoofing, a detection metric is defined. After that, a series of experiments using the Texas spoofing test battery (TEXBAT) are performed to demonstrate the effectiveness of the proposed algorithm.",Magnesium: A Magic Bullet for Cardiovascular Disease in Chronic Kidney Disease?,https://www.ncbi.nlm.nih.gov/pubmed/30813254,Nutrients,2019 05 02,"Magnesium is essential for many physiological functions in the human body. Its homeostasis involves dietary intake, absorption, uptake and release from bone, swifts between the intra- and extracellular compartment, and renal excretion. Renal excretion is mainly responsible for regulation of magnesium balance. In chronic kidney disease (CKD), for a long time the general policy has been limiting magnesium intake. However, this may not be appropriate for many patients. The reference ranges for magnesium are not necessarily optimal concentrations, and risks for insufficient magnesium intake exist in patients with CKD. In recent years, many observational studies have shown that higher (in the high range of ""normal"" or slightly above) magnesium concentrations are associated with better survival in CKD cohorts. This review gives an overview of epidemiological associations between magnesium and overall and cardiovascular survival in patients with CKD. In addition, potential mechanisms explaining the protective role of magnesium in clinical cardiovascular outcomes are described by reviewing evidence from in vitro studies, animal studies, and human intervention studies with non-clinical endpoints. This includes the role of magnesium in cardiac arrhythmia, heart failure, arterial calcification, and endothelial dysfunction. Possible future implications will be addressed, which will need prospective clinical trials with relevant clinical endpoints before these can be adopted in clinical practice.",Effects of Chemotherapy and Radiotherapy on Spermatogenesis: The Role of Testicular Immunology.,https://www.ncbi.nlm.nih.gov/pubmed/30813253,International journal of molecular sciences,2019 06 07,"Substantial improvements in cancer treatment have resulted in longer survival and increased quality of life in cancer survivors with minimized long-term toxicity.

This surface exhibits remarkable magnetic anisotropy (expressed in term of Barkhausen noise). This paper also shows that Barkhausen noise emission in a hard-milled surface is a function of tool wear and the corresponding microstructure transformations initiated in the tool/machined surface interface. The paper discusses the specific character of Barkhausen noise bursts and the unusually high magnitude of Barkhausen noise pulses, especially at a low degree of tool wear. The main causes can be seen in specific structures and the corresponding domain configurations formed during rapid cooling following surface heating. Domains are not randomly but preferentially oriented in the direction of the cutting speed. Barkhausen noise signals (measured in two perpendicular directions such as cutting speed and feed direction) indicate that the mechanism of Bloch wall motion during cyclic magnetization in hard-milled surfaces differs from surfaces produced by grinding cycles or the raw surface after heat treatment.","The Combined Use of Phenothiazines and Statins Strongly Affects Doxorubicin-Resistance, Apoptosis, and Cox-2 Activity in Colon Cancer Cells.",https://www.ncbi.nlm.nih.gov/pubmed/30813251,International journal of molecular sciences,2019 06 07,"Since none of the multidrug resistance (MDR) modulators tested so far found their way into clinic, a novel approach to overcome the MDR of cancer cells has been proposed. The combined use of two MDR modulators of dissimilar mechanisms of action was suggested to benefit from the synergy between them. The effect of three phenothiazine derivatives that were used as single agents and in combination with simvastatin on cell growth, apoptosis induction, activity, and expression of cyclooxygenase-2 (COX-2) in doxorubicin-resistant colon cancer cells (LoVo/Dx) was investigated. Treatment of LoVo/Dx cells by phenothiazine derivatives combined with simvastatin resulted in an increase of doxorubicin cytotoxicity and its intracellular accumulation as compared to the treatment with phenothiazine derivatives that were used as single agents. Similarly, LoVo/Dx cells treated with two-component mixture of modulators showed the reduced expression of ABCB1 (P-glycoprotein) transporter and COX-2 enzyme, both on mRNA and protein level. Reduced expression of anti-apoptotic Bcl-2 protein and increased expression of pro-apoptotic Bax were also detected. Additionally, COX-2 activity was diminished, and caspase-3 activity was increased to a higher extent by phenothiazine derivative:simvastatin mixtures than by phenothiazine derivatives themselves. Therefore, the introduction of simvastatin strengthened the anti-MDR, anti-inflammatory, and pro-apoptotic properties of phenothiazines in LoVo/Dx cells."

Obesity and the MS are distinguished by an increase in circulating leptin concentrations, in parallel to a drop in the levels of adiponectin. Consequently, the Adpn/Lep ratio has been suggested as a maker of dysfunctional adipose tissue. We aimed to investigate in humans (n = 292) the reliability of the Adpn/Lep ratio as a biomarker of adipose tissue dysfunction. We considered that an Adpn/Lep ratio of ≥1.0 can be considered normal, a ratio of ≥0.5 <1.0 suggests moderate-medium increased risk, and a ratio of <0.5 indicates a severe increase in cardiometabolic risk. Using these cut-offs, 5%, 54% and 48% of the lean, normoglycemic and without-MS subjects, respectively, fall within the group with an Adpn/Lep ratio below 0.5; while 89%, 86% and 90% of the obese, with T2D and with MS patients fall within the same group (p < 0.001). A significant negative correlation (r = -0.21, p = 0.005) between the Adpn/Lep ratio and serum amyloid A (SAA) concentrations, a marker of adipose tissue dysfunction, was found. We concluded that the Adpn/Lep ratio is a good indicator of a dysfunctional adipose tissue that may be a useful estimator of obesity- and MS-associated cardiometabolic risk, allowing the identification of a higher number of subjects at risk.","High-Grade Serous Ovarian Cancer: Basic Sciences, Clinical and Therapeutic Standpoints.",https://www.ncbi.nlm.nih.gov/pubmed/30813239,International journal of molecular sciences,2019 06 07,"Among a litany of malignancies affecting the female reproductive tract, that of the ovary is the most frequently fatal. Moreover, while the steady pace of scientific discovery has fuelled recent ameliorations in the outcomes of many other cancers, the rates of mortality for ovarian cancer have been stagnant since around 1980. Yet despite the grim outlook, progress is being made towards better understanding the fundamental biology of this disease and how its biology in turn influences clinical behaviour. It has long been evident that ovarian cancer is not a unitary disease but rather a multiplicity of distinct malignancies that share a common anatomical site upon presentation. Of these, the high-grade serous subtype predominates in the clinical setting and is responsible for a disproportionate share of the fatalities from all forms of ovarian cancer. This review aims to provide a detailed overview of the clinical-pathological features of ovarian cancer with a particular focus on the high-grade serous subtype. Along with a description of the relevant clinical aspects of this disease, including novel trends in treatment strategies, this text will inform the reader of recent updates to the scientific literature regarding the origin, aetiology and molecular-genetic basis of high-grade serous ovarian cancer (HGSOC).",A Prospective Study Identifying a Change in Energy and Protein Intake of Older Adults during Inpatient Rehabilitation.,https://www.ncbi.nlm.nih.gov/pubmed/30813238,Nutrients,2019 05 02,"Understanding older patients' dietary intake patterns may improve the timing of strategies to address hospital malnutrition. The aims of this study were to explore longitudinally the change in daily energy (kJ/day) and protein (g/day) intake, and associated factors. Data were derived using a 5-point scale to visually estimate plate waste, and known nutrient composition data. Analyses determined the change in intake between admission and day 14, and admission, day 14 and day 28, respectively. Data were available for 39 participants between admission and day 14 (median (interquartile range) age 82 (78⁻87) years; 54% male) and 12 participants between admission, day 14 and day 28 (median (IQR) age 79 (69⁻84) years; 58% male). From admission to day 14 there was a significant increase in the mean (SD) daily intake of energy (6177 (1879) kJ/day vs. 7213 (1903), p < 0.001) and protein (63.7 (23) g/day vs. 76.4 (23.0) g/day, p = 0.003) but no change from admission to day 14 to day 28. There was a significant inverse relationship between amount consumed at admission and change in intake. Variability in elderly patients' intake over time has implications for the timing of nutritional care and data collection in research studies.",Effect of Atmospheric Cold Plasma Treatment on the Adhesion and Tribological Properties of Polyamide 66 and Poly(Tetrafluoroethylene).,https://www.ncbi.nlm.nih.gov/pubmed/30813237,"Materials (Basel, Switzerland)",2019 04 01,"The surfaces of two engineering polymers including polyamide 66 (PA66) and polytetrafluoroethylene (PTFE) were treated by diffuse coplanar surface barrier discharges in atmospheric air. We found that plasma treatment improved the adhesion of PA66 for either polymer/polymer or polymer/steel joints, however, it was selective for the investigated adhesive agents. For PTFE the adhesion was unaltered for plasma treatment regardless the type of used adhesive. Tribological properties were slightly improved for PA66, too. Both the friction coefficient and wear decreased. Significant changes, again, could not be detected for PTFE. The occurred variation in the adhesion and tribology was discussed on the basis of the occurred changes in surface chemistry, wettability and topography of the polymer surface.",Synthetic Chiral Derivatives of Xanthones: Biological Activities and Enantioselectivity Studies.,https://www.ncbi.nlm.nih.gov/pubmed/30813236,"Molecules (Basel, Switzerland)",2019 06 13,"Many naturally occurring xanthones are chiral and present a wide range of biological and pharmacological activities. Some of them have been exhaustively studied and subsequently, obtained by synthesis. In order to obtain libraries of compounds for structure activity relationship (SAR) studies as well as to improve the biological activity, new bioactive analogues and derivatives inspired in natural prototypes were synthetized. Bioactive natural xanthones compromise a large structural multiplicity of compounds, including a diversity of chiral derivatives. Thus, recently an exponential interest in synthetic chiral derivatives of xanthones (CDXs) has been witnessed. The synthetic methodologies can afford structures that otherwise could not be reached within the natural products for biological activity and SAR studies. Another reason that justifies this trend is that both enantiomers can be obtained by using appropriate synthetic pathways, allowing the possibility to perform enantioselectivity studies. In this work, a literature review of synthetic CDXs is presented. The structures, the approaches used for their synthesis and the biological activities are described, emphasizing the enantioselectivity studies.","A Validated HPLC-MS/MS Assay for 14-O-[(4,6-Diaminopyrimidine-2-yl)thioacetyl] Mutilin in Biological Samples and Its Pharmacokinetic, Distribution and Excretion via Urine and Feces in Rats.",https://www.ncbi.nlm.nih.gov/pubmed/30813235,"Molecules (Basel, Switzerland)",2019 06 13,"14-O-[(4,6-Diaminopyrimidine-2-yl)thioacetyl] mutilin (DPTM), a novel pleuromutilin candidate with a substituted pyrimidine moiety, has been confirmed to possess excellent antibacterial activity against Gram-positive bacteria. To illustrate the pharmacokinetic profile after intravenous (i.v.), intramuscular (i.m.) and oral (p.o.) administrations with DPTM, as well as tissue distribution and excretion via urine and feces in vivo, a specific, sensitive and robust HPLC-MS/MS method was first developed to determine DPTM in rat plasma, various tissues, urine and feces. The plasma, tissues, urine and feces samples were treated by protein precipitation with acetonitrile using tiamulin fumarate as an internal standard (IS). This method which was achieved on an HPLC system detector equipped with an ESI interface, was sensitive with 5 ng/mL as the lower limit of detection and exhibited good linearity (R² > 0.9900) in the range of 5⁻4000 ng/mL for plasma, various tissues, urine and feces, as well as intra-day precision, inter-day precision and accuracy. The matrix effects ranged from 94.2 to 109.7% with RSD ≤ 9.4% and the mean extraction recoveries ranged from 95.4 to 109.5% in plasma, tissue homogenates, urine and feces (RSD ≤ 9.9). After i.v., i.m. and p.o. administrations, DPTM was rapidly absorbed and metabolized in rats with the half-life (t1/2) of 1.70⁻1.86, 3.23⁻3.49 and 4.38⁻4.70 for 10, 25 and 75 mg/kg doses, respectively. The tissue distribution showed that DPTM was diffused into all the tested tissues, especially into the intestine and lung.

The dietary flavonol glycoside, hyperoside (quercetin-3-O-galactoside), exerts health benefits by preventing oxidative damage. To further understand its antioxidative defence mechanisms, we systemically investigated the regulation of hyperoside on oxidative damage induced by hydrogen peroxide, carbon tetrachloride, and cadmium in Saccharomyces cerevisiae. Hyperoside significantly increased cell viability, decreased lipid peroxidation, and lowered intracellular reactive oxygen species (ROS) levels in the wild-type strain (WT) and mutants gtt1∆ and gtt2∆. However, the strain with ctt1∆ showed variable cell viability and intracellular ROS-scavenging ability in response to the hyperoside treatment upon the stimulation of H₂O₂ and CCl₄. In addition, hyperoside did not confer viability tolerance or intercellular ROS in CdSO₄-induced stress to strains of sod1∆ and gsh1∆. The results suggest that the antioxidative reactions of hyperoside in S. cerevisiae depend on the intercellular ROS detoxification system.",The Inhibitory Effect of Celangulin V on the ATP Hydrolytic Activity of the Complex of V-ATPase Subunits A and B in the Midgut of Mythimna separata.,https://www.ncbi.nlm.nih.gov/pubmed/30813232,Toxins,2019 04 02,"Celangulin V (CV) is a compound isolated from Celastrus angulatus Max that has a toxic activity against agricultural insect pests. CV can bind to subunits a, H, and B of the vacuolar ATPase (V-ATPase) in the midgut epithelial cells of insects. However, the mechanism of action of CV is still unclear. In this study, the soluble complex of the V-ATPase A subunit mutant TSCA which avoids the feedback inhibition by the hydrolysate ADP and V-ATPase B subunit were obtained and then purified using affinity chromatography. The H⁺K⁺-ATPase activity of the complex and the inhibitory activity of CV on ATP hydrolysis were determined. The results suggest that CV inhibits the ATP hydrolysis, resulting in an insecticidal effect. Additionally, the homology modeling of the AB complex and molecular docking results indicate that CV can competitively bind to the AB complex at the ATP binding site, which inhibits ATP hydrolysis. These findings suggest that the AB subunits complex is one of the potential targets for CV and is important for understanding the mechanism of interaction between CV and V-ATPase.",Integrated Multi-Assay Culture Model for Stem Cell Chondrogenic Differentiation.,https://www.ncbi.nlm.nih.gov/pubmed/30813231,International journal of molecular sciences,2019 06 07,"Recent osteochondral repair strategies highlight the promise of mesenchymal progenitors, an accessible stem cell source with osteogenic and chondrogenic potential, used in conjunction with biomaterials for tissue engineering. For this, regenerative medicine approaches require robust models to ensure selected cell populations can generate the desired cell type in a reproducible and measurable manner. Techniques for in vitro chondrogenic differentiation are well-established but largely qualitative, relying on sample staining and imaging. To facilitate the in vitro screening of pro-chondrogenic treatments, a 3D micropellet culture combined with three quantitative GAG assays has been developed, with a fourth parallel assay measuring sample content to enable normalisation. The effect of transforming growth factor beta (TGF-β) used to validate this culture format produced a measurable increase in proteoglycan production in the parallel assays, in both 2D and 3D culture configurations. When compared to traditional micropellets, the monolayer format appeared less able to detect changes in cell differentiation, however in-well 3D cultures displayed a significant differential response. Effects on collagen 2 expression confirmed these observations. Based on these results, a microplate format was optimised for 3D culture, in a high-throughput in-well configuration. This model showed improved sensitivity and confirmed the 3D micropellet in-well quantitative assays as an effective differentiation format compatible with streamlined, high-throughput chondrogenic screens."

Demographic, diagnostic, surgical, and pathological findings of patients who had undergone radical nephrectomy (RN) due to renal SFT were collected from the database of a single institution and were retrospectively reviewed. Ten patients (6 men and 4 women) were diagnosed with renal SFT in our institution between January 1, 2000 and December 31, 2016. The mean age was 50.9 ± 8.2 years (range, 38-63 years). Of the 10 patients, 6 were asymptomatic, 2 presented with flank pain, 1 presented with abdominal discomfort, and 1 presented with haematuria. Computed tomography scans were obtained for all patients. Open RN was performed on 6 patients, and laparoscopic RN was performed on 4 patients. The mean tumor size was 10.23 ± 4 cm (range, 5.3-19 cm). Pathological diagnosis revealed that the tumors in 8 patients were benign, while those in the other 2 patients were malignant renal SFT. No recurrence occurred during a mean follow-up period of 47.3 ± 21.5 months (range, 16-85 months).

Women without prolapse before hysterectomy may also experience prolapse after hysterectomy. This study aimed to describe a surgical modification of laparoscopic colposuspension with round ligaments after hysterectomy in women without preexisting genital prolapse and to evaluate the initial surgical results in these patients.We reviewed data of 54 patients who underwent laparoscopic hysterectomy with colposuspension with unilateral or bilateral round ligaments after hysterectomy at Chia-Yi Chang Gung Memorial Hospital from July 2012 to March 2015. Vaginal length was measured before and after colposuspension after complete hysterectomy. Preoperative characteristics of the patients, perioperative quality, postoperative outcomes, and vaginal length differences were analyzed.Vaginal length increased by a mean of 2.59 cm after colposuspension. The mean extra-operative time needed for laparoscopic colposuspension was about 10 minutes. No severe complications were reported in our patients, and we did not find any cystocele after completing vaginal cuff suspension to the round ligament.The vaginal apex level was maintained in our modified laparoscopic hysterectomy. Therefore, laparoscopic colposuspension with round ligaments is a promising option as a routine, first-line standard procedure in younger women without genital prolapse to maintain an acceptable vaginal length after laparoscopic hysterectomy."

Targets of abnormal miRNAs, and their regulatory mechanisms were studied. A miRNA array was used to analyze the serum from 3 schizophrenic patients without treatment, 3 clinically cured patients and 3 healthy controls. The findings from the array were confirmed by real-time PCR in a larger cohort, including 59 patients and 60 healthy controls. The candidate miRNAs were analyzed using bioinformatics tools. Their potential targets were studied through in vitro cellular experiments.MiR-320a-3p and miR-320b were found to be down-regulated in patients compared with cured patients and controls in the miRNA array, which was also confirmed by real-time PCR in the larger cohort. Integrin β1 (ITG β1) was found to be one of the targets of miR-320a-3p. An enzyme-linked immune sorbent assay demonstrated that the ITG β1 concentration increased significantly in the patients' serum, and the in vitro study confirmed that miR-320a-3p targeted the 3' UTR of ITG β1 mRNA and reduced its expression.Our results demonstrated that the regulatory effect of miR-320a-3p on its target ITG β1 might play an important role in schizophrenia pathogenesis, which could be a potential pathway for schizophrenia diagnosis and therapy.",Unilateral versus bilateral percutaneous vertebroplasty for osteoporotic vertebral compression fractures in elderly patients: A meta-analysis.,https://www.ncbi.nlm.nih.gov/pubmed/30813133,Medicine,2019 03 29,To contrast the effects and complications in unilateral and bilateral percutaneous vertebroplasty (PVP) for osteoporotic vertebral compression fractures in elderly patients.,Inadvertent epidural anesthesia associated with catheterization following continuous psoas compartment block in a patient with scoliosis: A Case report.,https://www.ncbi.nlm.nih.gov/pubmed/30813132,Medicine,2019 03 29,"Psoas compartment block (PCB) is typically performed using surface anatomical landmarks and neurostimulation for guidance.

A propensity score (PS) was derived using logistic regression to model the probability of elective induction group as a function of potential confounders. Altogether, 284 women with elective induction were matched with 284 women who underwent expectant management to create a PS-matched population. All analysis was performed using SAS software, version 9.4 (SAS Institute Inc., Cary, NC). All P values reported of the significance level was set at <.05.There are no significant differences of delivery mode, neonatal intensive care unit (NICU) admission, and neonatal complication between PS-matched groups. Incidence of antepartum complications showed higher in the elective induction group compared to the spontaneous labor group (P = .04). When comparing each gestational week, incidence of NICU admission at 38 weeks in the elective induction group [10/74 (13.5%)] was significantly higher than in and the spontaneous labor group [2/74 (2.7%)] (P = .04).Elective induction of labor at term is not associated with increased risk of cesarean delivery. However, overall incidence of NICU admission at 38 gestational weeks seems to be increased in elective induction.",Endoscopic versus surgical treatment for pancreatic pseudocysts: Systematic review and meta-analysis.,https://www.ncbi.nlm.nih.gov/pubmed/30813129,Medicine,2019 03 29,This systematic review and meta-analysis aims to compare surgical and endoscopic treatment for pancreatic pseudocyst (PP).,Association between the level of serum soluble ST2 and invasively measured aortic pulse pressure in patients undergoing coronary angiography.,https://www.ncbi.nlm.nih.gov/pubmed/30813128,Medicine,2019 03 29,"Despite the well-documented value of ST2 in heart failure and myocardial infarction, the role of ST2 in vascular biology has not yet been well defined. This study was performed to investigate the association between serum soluble ST2 (sST2) and invasively measured aortic pulse pressure (APP). A total of 167 consecutive patients with suspected coronary artery disease (CAD) (65.1 ± 9.8 years; men, 65.9%) referred for invasive coronary angiography was prospectively enrolled. APP was measured at the ascending aorta with a pig-tail catheter, and arterial blood samples for the measurement of sST2 were collected before coronary angiography. Serum sST2 levels were quantified by radioimmunoassay. Most of the patients (73.9%) had significant CAD (stenosis ≥ 50%) on coronary angiography. Patients with higher APP (≥76 mmHg) showed a significantly higher sST2 level compared to those with lower APP (<76 mmHg) (31.7 ± 13.9 ng/mL vs 26.2 ± 10.2 ng/mL, P < .001). In simple correlation analysis, there was a significant positive correlation between sST2 levels and APP (r = 0.413, P < .001). In multiple linear regression analysis, sST2 had an independent association with APP even after controlling for potential confounders (β = 0.331, P < .001). The serum sST2 level may be independently associated with invasively measured APP in patients undergoing coronary angiography. The result of this study gives insight into the role of sST2 in aortic stiffening, and suggests that the sST2 level may be a useful marker of aortic stiffness."

C, Materials for biological applications",2019 02 28,"Glaucoma is a lifelong disorder that necessitates continuous medical therapy to manage its symptoms and preserve the vision of patients; accordingly, it is highly beneficial to develop a long-acting injectable depot system that can exhibit better drug delivery capability. This study aims to investigate the effect of the amination degree of gelatin on the carbodiimide-mediated grafting of thermo-responsive poly(N-isopropylacrylamide) segments onto biodegradable protein backbone molecules. Moreover, the potential applications of these carrier materials for intracameral pilocarpine administration in glaucomatous subjects will be considered. The gelatins with different amination degrees that are prepared by controlling the feed amount of adipic acid dihydrazide are further used for the synthesis of graft copolymers. The results of chemical characterization and electron microscopy studies showed that both grafting reaction effectiveness and gelling carrier ultrastructure vary in response to biomaterial amination. Compared to unmodified biopolymer thermogel without gel formation, graft copolymers that are composed of aminated gelatin networks showed a more remarkable temperature-triggered pilocarpine capture under physiological conditions. This could create more stable depot-forming carrier systems with improved in vivo pharmacological efficacy. Although the increase in amination degree enhances the biodegradation resistance of graft copolymers for achieving extended drug release profiles and provides significant therapeutic benefits, carriers with excess positive charges may potentiate the cytotoxic actions of oxidative stress signals and may cause damage in cellular barrier integrity. Consequently, unfavorable ocular tissue responses and poor treatment outcomes are observed in glaucomatous rabbits. For the first time, our findings suggest that the amination degree of gelatin performs a crucial function in guiding the development of structure-property-function relationships of biodegradable thermogels as intracameral drug delivery systems.",Molecular engineering of poly(HEMA-co-PEGMA)-based hydrogels: Role of minor AEMA and DMAEMA inclusion.,https://www.ncbi.nlm.nih.gov/pubmed/30813095,"Materials science & engineering.

The method is based on ""off-on"" fluorescence of carbon quantum dots (CQDs) prepared from Prosopis juliflora leaves as a green and low cost source. The synthesis of CQDs was easily performed with a rapid one pot process and the prepared CQDs exhibited a blue luminescence with a 5% quantum yield. The off fluorescent is observed in the presence of different concentrations of mercury (II) that is specifically recovered with the addition of chemet. The gradually recovered fluorescence is due to the high affinity of chelating property of succimer drug towards mercury (II) with a good restoration. Under the optimized condition, two linear calibrations were validated in the range of 5-500 ng mL-1 and 2.5-22.5 ng mL-1 for Hg (II) and chemet, respectively.

C, Materials for biological applications",2019 02 28,"Acute liver failure (ALF) is one of the most devastating fatal conditions which have posed crucial challenges to the clinicians and researchers for identifying permanent cure. Currently liver transplantation has been considered as the only managerial option. However it's wider applicability has been limited owing to non-availability of quality donor organs, cost-intensiveness, surgical hitches, life-long use of immunosuppressive drugs and long-term complications. Since last decades, several liver support systems have been developed for the management of failing liver in acute condition. However, the major limitation has been the lack of natural biological support and long-term survival of the grafts post-transplantation. Repopulation of decellularized xenogeneic organs is one of the emerging technologies for development of humanized neo-organs for demanding regenerative application. However, the earlier reported studies do not fulfil the insistence to provide immunologically tolerable humanized liver grafts for clinical applications. Here we demonstrate an efficient approach to generate transplantable humanized liver grafts which provides long-term support to the failing liver in Acute Liver Failure (ALF) animal models. These bioengineered humanized liver tissue grafts expresses several liver specific transcripts and performed crucial synthetic (albumin production) and detoxification (urea synthesis) functions at comparative level to normal liver. Intraperitoneal transplantation of these humanized liver grafts offered favourable microenvironment to exchange toxic substances across the barrier during ALF condition and provided long-term survival and function of the graft. In summary, the results of present study provide a first proof of concept in pre-clinical ALF animal model for the applicability of these bioengineered humanized livers in the management of failing liver on demand and may be considered as potential bridge to liver transplantation.",Chitosan grafted-poly(ethylene glycol) methacrylate nanoparticles as carrier for controlled release of bevacizumab.,https://www.ncbi.nlm.nih.gov/pubmed/30813091,"Materials science & engineering.

To find out the characteristics of the materials synthesized, X-ray diffraction (XRD), IR spectroscopy and absorption in UV-Vis were used, as well as both scanning (SEM) and transmission (TEM) electron microscopy. The results showed that the samples obtained were of nanometric size (<100 nm), with a predominance of the wurtzite crystal phase of ZnO and little crystallization of the nanobiohybrids. Their antifungal capacity on two pathogenic fungi of coffee, Mycena citricolor (Berk and Curt) and Colletotrichum sp. was also evaluated. Both nanomaterials showed an efficient antifungal capacity, particularly the nanobiohybrids, with ~97% inhibition in growth of M. citricolor, and ~93% for Colletotrichum sp. The microstructural study with high resolution optical (HROM) and ultra-structural microscopy (using TEM) carried out on the fungi treated with the synthesized nanomaterials showed a strong nanofungicidal effect on the vegetative and reproductive structures and fungal cell wall, respectively. The inhibition of the growth of the fungi and micro and ultra-structural affectations were explained considering that the size of the nanomaterials allows them to pass easily through the cell membranes. This indicates that they can be absorbed easily by the fungi tested here, causing cellular dysfunction. Nanofungicide effects are also attributable to the unique properties of nanomaterials, such as the high surface-to-bulk ratio of atoms and their surface physicochemical characteristics that could directly or indirectly produce reactive oxygen species (ROS), which affect the proteins of the cell wall."

The MgZnO NPs were successfully formed at approximately 360 °C and showed an increase in the optical band gap with respect to the increase in the concentration of Mg doping. The X-ray diffraction and scanning electron microscopy analyses of MgZnO NPs confirmed the formation of hexagonal wurtzite structure and rod-like morphology. X-ray photoelectron spectra revealed that the Mg (1s) peaks centered at 1303.35 and 1303.38 eV were ascribed to the presence of Mg2+ replacing Zn2+.

In this work, multi-material β-TCP-Ti6Al4V cellular structures were designed to combine Ti6Al4V mechanical properties and β-Tricalcium Phosphate bioactivity, in order to promote bone ingrowth as the bioactive material is being absorbed and replaced by newly formed bone. In this sense, the produced structures were characterized regarding roughness, wettability, β-TCP quantity and quality inside the structures after fabrication and the pH measured during cell culture (as consequence of β-TCP dissolution) and those aspects were correlated with cellular viability, distribution, morphology and proliferation. These structures displayed a hydrophilic behavior and results showed that the addition of β-TCP to these cellular structures led to an alkalization of the medium, aspect that significantly influences the cellular response. Higher impregnation ratios were found more adequate for lowering the media pH and toxicity, and thus enhance cell adhesion and proliferation.",Thixotropic PVA hydrogel enclosing a hydrophilic PVP core as nucleus pulposus substitute.,https://www.ncbi.nlm.nih.gov/pubmed/30813074,"Materials science & engineering. C, Materials for biological applications",2019 06 13,"A thixotropic polyvinyl alcohol (PVA) hydrogel, containing a hydrophilic poly-vinyl pyrrolidone (PVP) core, was obtained in order to develop a preformed 3D network able to maintain injectability. PVA was mixed with PVP in two different molar ratios (1:1 and 1:3) and chemically cross-linked using trisodium trimetaphosphate (STMP), which is able to react only with PVA component. A combination of Time of Flight- Secondary Ion Mass Spectrometry (ToF-SIMS), elemental analysis and UV spectroscopy permitted to determine both the cross-linking arm length and the crosslinking degree. Hydrogels were characterized in terms of swelling pressurization, rheological and mechanical behaviour. In particular, the viscoelastic behaviour of the hydrogel was analysed in shear and compression stress under dynamic conditions and compared with the performance of healthy human nucleus pulposus. In conclusion, the study demonstrated that the scaffold obtained mixing PVA and PVP in a molar ratio 1:1 can be considered a promising material to be utilised in the replacement of nucleus pulposus.",Anti-tumor potential of astragalus polysaccharides on breast cancer cell line mediated by macrophage activation.,https://www.ncbi.nlm.nih.gov/pubmed/30813073,"Materials science & engineering. C, Materials for biological applications",2019 06 13,"Adverse effects are pressing challenges produced by chemotherapy and radiotherapy for the treatment of breast cancer. Nontoxic herbal medicines are therefore considered as a favorable alternative. Astragalus membranaceus has attracted growing interest in the field of biomedicine thanks to its various biological activities, among which the anticancer activity is considered to be closely associated with its active component-astragalus polysaccharide (APS). Currently, direct anti-tumor activity and the activation of immune response of the host have been widely acknowledged as the mechanism by which APS exerts its anti-cancer activity. In this study, we aimed to investigate whether APS could inhibit the growth of MCF-7 cells and activate macrophages to further kill cancer cells. The results indicated that the obtained APS was a pyran-type polysaccharide, containing 89.75% total carbohydrate and a minor amount of uronic acid (9.3%). Although APS did not significantly inhibit the growth of MCF-7 cells growth, encouragingly, APS-activated RAW264.7 macrophages present anti-cancer activity as evidenced by (a) cell proliferation inhibition (with an inhibitory rate of 41%), (b) G1-phase cell cycle arrest, as well as (c) the regulation of apoptosis-related genes (Bax/Bcl-2, 13.26-fold increase than untreated cells). In addition, APS could upregulate the level of nitric oxide (NO) and tumor necrosis factor-α (TNF-α), which acted as inducers of tumor cell apoptosis. Collectively, our findings suggest that APS can activate macrophages to release NO and TNF-α, which directly blocks cancer cell growth. The anti-breast cancer effect of APS and the in vivo mechanism will be further elucidated with a review to provide a therapeutic strategy for breast cancer.",Tailoring cubic and dodecagonal quasicrystalline mesophases of mesoporous organosilica nanoparticles and core/shell structure.,https://www.ncbi.nlm.nih.gov/pubmed/30813071,"Materials science & engineering. C, Materials for biological applications",2019 06 13,"Herein, the synthesis of mesoporous organosilica nanoparticles with cubic and dodecagonal quasicrystalline mesophases is reported. Mesoporous nanoparticles are synthesized by base-catalyzed hydrolysis and condensation reactions of silane-based monomers in the presence of hexadecyltrimethylammonium bromide (CTAB), which is used as a structure-directing agent to form the mesostructures. Cubic orders in the mesophases are formed using tetraethoxysilane monomers, and the mesophase is tuned to the dodecagonal quasicrystalline order by using binary monomers including tetraethoxysilane and dimethyldiethoxysilane. The size of the quasicrystalline-phase organosilica is tailored by changing the amount of base catalyst used. Additionally, we obtained well-defined core/shell structures with quasicrystalline ordered mesoporous organosilica. Furthermore, we investigate the cytotoxicity of mesoporous organisilica nanoparticles using a CCK-8 assay to demonstrate that our NPs have a potential for the utilization as biomedical applications. These novel findings could guide the formation of mesophase structures with quasicrystalline order in silica-based mesoporous nanoparticles.","Synthesis, structural characterization and electrochemical studies switching of MWCNT/novel tetradentate ligand forming metal complexes on PIGE modified electrode by using SWASV.",https://www.ncbi.nlm.nih.gov/pubmed/30813070,"Materials science & engineering.

The ligand was characterized by UV-Visible spectroscopy, Fourier transform infrared spectroscopy, Raman studies, Nuclear magnetic resonance spectroscopy and scanning electron microscope methods. The ligand was characterized voltammetrically using redox couples Fe(CN)63-/4-, complemented with electrochemical impedance spectroscopy (EIS).

C, Materials for biological applications",2019 06 07,"Since Fe3O4 nanoparticles synthesized by plant extracts possess good bio-compatibility and superparamagnetic properties, the possibility of these could be used as a carrier in drug delivery. In this work, doxorubicin hydrochloride (DOX), an anti-cancer drug, loaded on glutaric anhydride-functionalized magnetic nanoparticles (Fe3O4@SiO2-Glu) was investigated at varying pH values for effective drug delivery. Various factors affecting the adsorption of DOX onto the Fe3O4@SiO2-Glu were examined, where the adsorption efficiency of DOX reached 92% at a concentration of 20 mg/L employing 10 mg of Fe3O4@SiO2-Glu at 303 K in pH 7.4. However, the adsorption efficiency of DOX was decreased to 18% at acidic pH value down to 3.0, implicating that the drug releasing process was controlled by pH. Adsorption kinetics was fitting to pseudo-second-order and the isothermal adsorption conformed to Freundlich isotherm. The morphology and surface composition of the synthesized Fe3O4@SiO2-Glu were characterized by SEM, TEM, and N2 adsorption/desorption isotherms, revealing that the specific surface area being 62.6 m2/g and the size ranging from ~30 to 50 nm. The zeta potential results indicated that Fe3O4@SiO2-Glu were negatively charged in various pH from 3 to 8.5. Characterizations by FTIR and UV-Vis techniques suggested that the DOX was absorbed and it can be delivered by Fe3O4@SiO2-Glu.",Influence of nanoporous titanium niobium alloy surfaces produced via hydrogen peroxide oxidative etching on the osteogenic differentiation of human mesenchymal stromal cells.,https://www.ncbi.nlm.nih.gov/pubmed/30813067,"Materials science & engineering. C, Materials for biological applications",2019 06 13,"Titanium niobium alloys exhibit a lower stiffness compared to Ti6Al4V, the 'gold standard' for load-bearing bone implants. Thus, the critical mismatch in stiffness between the implant and adjacent bone tissue could be addressed with TiNb alloys and thereby reduce stress shielding, which can result in bone resorption and subsequent implant loosening; however, the cellular response on the specific material is crucial for sufficient osseointegration. We therefore hypothesize that the response of human mesenchymal stromal cells (hMSC) and osteoblast-like cells on Ti45Nb surfaces can be improved by a novel nanoporous surface structure. For this purpose, an etching technique using hydrogen peroxide electrolyte solution was applied to Ti45Nb. The treated surfaces were characterized using SEM, LSM, AFM, nanoindentation, and contact angle measurements. Cell culture experiments using hMCS and MG-63 were conducted. The H2O2 treatment resulted in surface nanopores, an increase in surface wettability and a reduction in surface hardness. The proliferation of MG-63 was enhanced on TiNb45 compared to Ti6Al4V. MG-63 focal adhesion complexes were detected on all Ti45Nb surfaces, whereas the nanostructures notably increased the cell area and decreased cell solidity, indicating stimulated cell spreading and pseudopodia formation. Alizarin red stainings indicated that the nanoporous surfaces stimulated the osteogenic differentiation of hMSC. It can be concluded that the proposed surface treatment could potentially help to stimulate the osseointegration behaviour of the advantageous low stiff Ti45Nb alloy.",In situ injectable hyaluronic acid/gelatin hydrogel for hemorrhage control.,https://www.ncbi.nlm.nih.gov/pubmed/30813066,"Materials science & engineering.

It is a highly challenging task to obtain the ideal tissue sealant. Only a few commercially tissue sealants are available to be used for internal tissue or organ hemorrhage control. This study introduced two in situ injectable hydrogels for hemorrhage control: self-crosslinking gelatin (sc-G) hydrogel and hyaluronic acid/gelatin (HA/G) hydrogel. They were prepared on the tissue surface in situ and characterized by rheological analysis, stability, cytotoxicity, and bursting strength test. The hemostatic ability of the hydrogels was evaluated in a liver-bleeding rat model. The sc-G and HA/G hydrogels gelled around 90 s and 50 s, respectively. They were preferable for cell attachment and proliferation. The bursting strengths of both hydrogels exceeded that of fibrin glue. The hemostatic ability of HA/G hydrogel was better than that of sc-G hydrogel, and was same as that of fibrin glue. The HA/G hydrogel could be used as a tissue sealant for hemorrhage control in clinic.",Development of a photon induced drug-delivery implant coating.,https://www.ncbi.nlm.nih.gov/pubmed/30813065,"Materials science & engineering. C, Materials for biological applications",2019 06 13,"A thin surface coating intended for medical devices such as implants where local drug release is enabled using near infrared light (NIR) as an external stimulus has been developed. The delivery system consists of a thin Poly (N-isopropylacrylamide)-co-acrylamide (PNIPAAm-AAm) polymer layer with incorporated gold nanorods (GNRs). The aspect ratio of the GNRs were chosen to absorb NIR light, thus fitting the biological window of low tissue absorption, to locally heat the polymeric layer to initiate a drug release. Hence, controlled drug delivery from a surface within tissue orchestrated from outside the body is achievable. Composition of the PNIPAAm-AAm co-polymer was systematically varied to find a suitable phase transition temperature for in vivo applications. Differential scanning calorimetry (DSC) analysis showed that PNIPAAm-AAm containing 10% acrylamide had an appropriate phase transition temperature of 42 °C. As visualized by scanning electron microscopy (SEM), the surface coating consisted of 200 nm uniform polymer layer. Quartz crystal microbalance with dissipation monitoring (QCM-D) analysis coupled with in situ NIR irradiation demonstrated a dramatic shift in frequency that was attributed to mass being released from the surface upon irradiation. This mass release correlated well with the drug release profile as determined using UV/VIS spectroscopy with phenol as a model drug. In addition, proof-of-concept of the drug-delivery system was demonstrated by releasing the antibiotic vancomycin to eradicate Staphylococcus epidermidis bacteria in culture."

It was determined that the SWCNTs filaments were able to form a layer on the polycarbonate membrane having a number of carbon nanotube arranged in different orientations. A fraction of SWCNT filaments protruded through the holes of polycarbonate membrane and in such way significantly enhanced the adhesion of SWCNT-based layer and provided electrical conductivity across the PcFM. Atomic force microscopy (AFM), scanning electron microscopy (SEM) images and Raman spectroscopy-based evaluation revealed the characteristic morphology features: wide distribution of height profile, separate GO/rGO flakes on the top of PcFM/SWCNT/GO structure and close attachment of rGO flakes on the top of multilayered PcFM/SWCNT/rGO coating.

This study presents the utility of electrospun nanofiber mats containing a natural extract (Gymnema sylvestre) that averts biofilm formation but supports human dermal fibroblasts (hDFs) attachment. The scaffolds exhibited good wettability, enhanced mechanical properties and contact mediated inhibition of Gram-positive and Gram-negative bacteria. MTS viability assay and confocal imaging further confirmed that the natural extract loaded mats remained non-cytotoxic for hDFs.

Local delivery of CsA focused on a specific target organ has been proposed as a possible solution to this problem. In this study, we developed biodegradable sol-gel drug delivery systems, consisting of HA-Ca-Alg hydrogels combining hyaluronic acid calcium complex (HA-Ca) and sodium alginate (Alg-Na) components, for the local sustained delivery of CsA. A HA-Ca complex with very high degree of substitution was prepared by the acid-base reaction of hyaluronic acid and calcium acetate. The gelation was completed within about 2-45 min without external addition of calcium salts such as CaSO4 and CaCl2, indicating the high potential of the present hydrogel systems for drug delivery by injection in vivo. The HA-Ca system was characterized by high-resolution inductively coupled plasma-optical emission spectroscopy, 1H NMR, FT-IR, and thermogravimetric analysis methods. Moreover, the scanning electron microscopy analysis of the HA-Ca-Alg hydrogels showed an irregular porous morphology, with interconnected pores of 50-300 μm width.

For comparison, we also studied the creep deformation of chicken muscle fibers in a temperature range of 20 to 35 °C. The experimental results showed that we could use the standard linear viscoelastic model to describe the creep deformation of the chicken muscle fibers, the non-twisted Nylon 6 wires, and the Nylon 6 artificial muscles. A simple method was developed to calculate the mechanical (elastic) constants and viscous resistance coefficient (viscosity) of the three different materials. The activation energy for the creep deformation of the chicken muscle fibers in the temperature of 20 to 35 °C was 18.79 kJ/mol. For the non-twisted Nylon 6 wires, the activation energy for the creep deformation was generally larger than that of the chicken muscle fibers, and was dependent on the annealing temperature.

To inhibit QS, we fabricated heat-resistant, long-term-stable AHL-lactonase AiiM by electrospinning (ES) aqueous polyvinyl alcohol (PVA) solution containing genetically engineered AiiM with a maltose-binding protein (MBP) tag. MBP-AiiM was immobilized via its inclusion within a dense PVA shell formed during the drying process of ES, followed by cross-linking between hydroxyl groups on PVA. Secondary structure analysis via circular dichroism suggested no conformational change in the MBP-AiiM during ES. Even after pre-heating of MBP-AiiM/PVA fiber mats at 70 °C for 24 h, QS-dependent prodigiosin production in the model pathogen Serratia marcescens AS-1 was effectively inhibited to 0.13% that of the control. Additionally, relative prodigiosin production was reduced to ~20% that of the control after 5-month storage in buffer solution. These results suggest that a shear-thinning process using an entangled PVA aggregate during elongational changes to fibrous domains and a drying process during ES contributes not to enzymatic inactivation caused by conformational changes, but rather to the fabrication of a dense PVA shell around the MBP-AiiM molecules to protect them from disruptors including heating. The developed quorum-quenching enzyme has high potential to inhibit AHL-mediated QS frequently appearing in various Gram-negative bacteria.","Fabrication of alginate-based stimuli-responsive, non-cytotoxic, terpolymric semi-IPN hydrogel as a carrier for controlled release of bovine albumin serum and 5-amino salicylic acid.",https://www.ncbi.nlm.nih.gov/pubmed/30813044,"Materials science & engineering.

To improve mechanical properties, and to modulate surface morphology of Alg, 2-hydroxyethyl acrylate (HEA) was grafted on alginate and then crosslinked using poly(ethylene glycol) diacrylate (PEGDA). The probable structure and compositions of the synthesized semi-IPN terpolymer were identified by FTIR, 1H-HR-MAS NMR, and TGA analyses. Achievement of equilibrium swelling state (ESS) and higher elastic modulus values confirmed terpolymer gel formation in aqueous media. Differences in the ESS of the prepared gel at pH 2.5 and 7.4 signify its stimuli-responsive behaviour. The influence of PEGDA on swelling, mechanical properties, surface morphology, cell viability and proliferation, and BSA and 5-ASA delivery were characterized. SEM images show that higher % PEGDA resulted in smaller sized pores in the gel network. Texture analyses demonstrate that hardness, adhesiveness and chewiness of the gel were enhanced at higher PEGDA concentrations. Increases in PEGDA concentration also induced increases in osteoblastic cell viability and higher rates of cell proliferation compared with gels containing lower concentrations of PEGDA. The release results indicate that the gels containing higher concentrations of PEGDA more sustainably release BSA and 5-ASA at 5 days and 30 h, respectively.

The multifunctional nanoconjugates were characterized and evaluated using extensive in vitro and in vivo techniques. The nanoconjugates demonstrated excellent heating ability on exposure to alternating magnetic field and near-infrared laser irradiation. The acidic microenvironment of lysozome triggered release of LND from SPANs. Owing to leaching of Fe and Pt contents, SPANs demonstrated ability to generate reactive oxygen species (ROS) in U87MG cell line which further enhanced therapeutic effect of SPANs. Significant difference in cell viability suppression was observed in in vitro photothermal, chemo-photothermal and chemo-magnetophotothermal killing of cancer cells using SPANs in U87MG cell lines. Significant difference in heating ability and cell cytotoxicity of SPANs in comparison to alternative magnetic field and NIR irradiation was observed for DUAL-mode exposure of SPANs. The results of cellular internalization study showed efficient internalization of SPANs inside U87MG cells. The in vivo results (both qualitative and quantitative) confirmed enhanced uptake of SPANs in brain after intranasal administration with enhanced nasal and mucus penetration owing to presence of Lf.

C, Materials for biological applications",2019 06 13,"Over the past several years, the biomedical applications of fluorescent organic nanoparticles (FONs) with aggregation-induced emission (AIE) feature have been extensively explored because the AIE-active FONs could effectively overcome the aggregation caused quenching (ACQ) effect of FONs based on conventional organic dyes. The development of novel methods for synthesis of AIE-active FONs plays a centre role for their biomedical applications. In this work, we reported a facile one-step thiol-ene click reaction for fabrication of AIE-active FONs through conjugation of acrylated PEG and AIE-active tetraphenylethylene (TPE) with two ene bonds using pentaerythritol tetra(3-mercaptopropionate) as the linkage. The successful synthesis of TPE containing AIE-active copolymers was evidenced by various characterization techniques. The particle size and fluorescence properties of the resultant TPE-S-PEG copolymers were evaluated by transmission electronic microscopy and fluorescence spectroscopy. Moreover, the cell viability and cell uptake behavior was also examined to evaluate their potential for biological imaging. We demonstrated that the cross-linked TPE-S-PEG show small size, high water dispersibility, low cytotoxicity and strong fluorescence for tracing. All of these advantages endow the TPE-S-PEG FONs great potential for biological imaging applications. Furthermore, this novel click reaction can take place under mild experimental conditions with high efficiency. It could be also further expanded for preparation of multifunctional AIE-active materials due to the universality of the thiol-ene click reaction and good precursor applicapability. Taken together, we have developed a novel and effective thiol-ene click reaction to fabricate the cross-linked AIE-active FONs, which display excellent physicochemical and biological properties and are promising for biomedical applications.","Microstructure evolution, mechanical properties, and enhanced bioactivity of Ti-13Nb-13Zr based calcium pyrophosphate composites for biomedical applications.",https://www.ncbi.nlm.nih.gov/pubmed/30813028,"Materials science & engineering.

The results show that the sintered composites mainly consist of β-Ti, α-Ti, and ceramic interphases (Ti2O, CaTiO3, CaZrO3, CaO, TixPy). With the sintering temperature increasing, α-Ti and ceramic interphases gradually increase, and relative density, elastic modulus, compressive strength and yield strength of the composites also reveal an increasing tendency. However, Ti-13Nb-13Zr-10CPP composite sintered at 1000 °C exhibits high matching elastic modulus (46 GPa) and compressive strength (1617 MPa) due to uniform structure and high density. In addition, in vitro mineralization assays demonstrate the apatite-forming ability of the composite (1000 °C) and its higher surface bioactivity as compared to the Ti-13Nb-13Zr alloy. Furthermore, ROS1728 osteoblast culture evidences that the composite (1000 °C) stimulates cell adhesion and growth due to the pore characteristics and ceramic interphases.

Plants are an attractive source for silver nanoparticles (Ag NPs) synthesis because of their strong reducing potentials by production of a wide range of secondary metabolites. The present study describes the biosynthesis of Ag NPs using plant extract of Ocimum basilicum extract grown under in vitro condition for the first time. The surface Plasmon resonance found at 450 nm confirmed the formation of Ag NPs. FESEM images revealed relatively spherical- shaped of Ag NPs. The biosynthesized Ag NPs were crystalline in nature with mean diameter about 13.82 nm.

C, Materials for biological applications",2019 06 13,"Mimicking the mechanical properties of native tissue is an important requirement for tissue engineering scaffolds. Blood vessels are subject to repetitive dilation and contraction and possess a special nonlinear mechanical property due to their triple-layered structure. Fabrication of vascular grafts consisting of bioresorbable materials with biomimetic mechanical properties is an urgent demand, as well as a critical challenge. Inspired by the configuration and function of collagen and elastin in native blood vessels, a new type of triple-layered vascular graft (TLVG) was developed in this study. The TLVGs were composed of braided silk as the inner layer, polyacrylamide (PAM) hydrogel as the middle layer, and electrospun thermoplastic polyurethane (TPU) as the outer layer. The woven-structured silk fibers were able to mimic the properties of the loosely distributed collagen fibers, while the highly elastic PAM hydrogel and TPU nanofibers mimicked the elasticity of elastin in the blood vessel. With this specially designed microstructure and combination of rigid and elastic materials, the TLVGs successfully mimicked the nonlinear mechanical property of native blood vessels. Moreover, TLVGs possess sufficient suture retention strength for surgical implantation. The introduction of a PAM hydrogel layer effectively solved the leaking issue for conventional porous vascular grafts and greatly enhanced the burst pressure.

The efforts were aimed on the designing bioactive scaffolds improving the viability and metabolic activity of human adipose-derived multipotent stromal cells (hASCs). The in vitro study was designed to determine the optimal nHAp concentration, based on analysis of hASCs morphology, adhesion rate, as well as metabolic and proliferative potential. Initially, the PLLA filled with three different concentrations of the nHAp were tested i.e. 5%, 10% and 15 wt%. The obtained results indicated that the 10 wt% nHAp in the PLLA (10% nHAp/PLLA) matrices improved the adhesion and proliferation of the hASCs, what was in good agreement with the results of tensile properties of the composites. Further, we performed profound studies regarding the cytotoxicity of 10% nHAp/PLLA. The analysis included the evaluation of the biomaterial influence on viability, apoptosis-related markers expression profile and mitochondrial function. The cytocompatibility of 10% nHAp/PLLA scaffolds toward the hASCs was confirmed. The hASCs propagated on 10% nHAp/PLLA were more viable then those propagated on the plain PLLA. The level of pro-apoptotic markers, i.e. caspase-3 and Bax in cultures on 10% nHAp/PLLA was significantly decreased. Obtained results correlated with higher mitochondrial membrane potential of hASCs in those cultures. The obtained composites may improve therapeutic potential of hASCs via directing their adhesion, enhancing proliferation and viability as well as increasing mitochondrial potential, thus may find potential application in tissue engineering.","Fabrication, optimization, and characterization of ultra-small superparamagnetic Fe3O4 and biocompatible Fe3O4@ZnS core/shell magnetic nanoparticles: Ready for biomedicine applications.",https://www.ncbi.nlm.nih.gov/pubmed/30813021,"Materials science & engineering.

The cells viability exposed to the composite extract was higher than control and mineral material of bone (HA), illustrating that cytocompatibility was improved due to the presence of magnesium (Mg) and silicon (Si) elements in the composite structure. The comparative results of alkaline phosphatase (ALP) bioactivity assay showed that the osteogenic proliferation of osteoblast-like G292 cell was increased more by the ceramic composites extract than control. These comparative results demonstrated that nanostructured monticellite-based ceramic composites possessed good in vitro bioactivity, cytocompatibility and osteogenic properties, and may be utilized as the promising bioactive materials for bone tissue regeneration and replacement."

Here, we report the formation mechanism and the dynamic nature of edge states on exfoliated 2D halide perovskite thin crystals. In contrast to other 2D materials, the edge states in 2D perovskites are extrinsic and can be triggered by moisture with a concentration as low as ∼0.5 ppm. High-resolution atomic force microscopy and transmission electron microscopy characterizations reveal the width of the low-energy states is ∼40 nm wide. A temperature-dependent photoluminescence study suggests the edge states are a combination of several lower-energy states. Importantly, we demonstrate that the charge carriers on the dynamically formed edge states are not only long-lived but also highly mobile and can be conducted along the edges effectively with high mobilities of 5.4-7.0 cm2 V-1 s-1. This work provides significant insights on the origin of the edge states in 2D perovskites and provides routes to manipulate their optical and electrical properties through controlling their edges.",[Analysis of health status of occupational contacts of fluoride in a city].,https://www.ncbi.nlm.nih.gov/pubmed/30812091,Zhonghua lao dong wei sheng zhi ye bing za zhi = Zhonghua laodong weisheng zhiyebing zazhi = Chinese journal of industrial hygiene and occupational diseases,2019 05 10,,"[Evaluation on the intervented effects of health promotion at an enterprise in Huairou district, Beijing].",https://www.ncbi.nlm.nih.gov/pubmed/30812090,Zhonghua lao dong wei sheng zhi ye bing za zhi = Zhonghua laodong weisheng zhiyebing zazhi = Chinese journal of industrial hygiene and occupational diseases,2019 05 10,,[Study on the health effects of occupational exposure to lead exceeded].,https://www.ncbi.nlm.nih.gov/pubmed/30812089,Zhonghua lao dong wei sheng zhi ye bing za zhi = Zhonghua laodong weisheng zhiyebing zazhi = Chinese journal of industrial hygiene and occupational diseases,2019 06 13,"Objective: The main purpose of this study was to explore the health effects of occupational exposure to lead exceeded.

Using 3D bioprinting technology, scientists have developed functional prototypes of clinically relevant and mechanically robust bone with a functional bone marrow. Although the field is in its infancy, it has shown immense potential in the field of bone tissue engineering by re-establishing the 3D dynamic micro-environment of the native bone. Inspite of their in vitro success, maintaining the viability and differentiation potential of such cell-laden constructs overtime, and their subsequent preclinical testing in terms of stability, mechanical loading, immune responses, and osseointegrative potential still needs to be explored.

This is regarded as one of the first cyber-physical attacks on electricity infrastructure to have led to a substantial power outage and is illustrative of the increasing vulnerability of Critical National Infrastructure to this type of malicious activity. Few data points, coupled with the rapid emergence of cyber phenomena, has held back the development of resilience analytics of cyber-physical attacks, relative to many other threats. We propose to overcome data limitations by applying stochastic counterfactual risk analysis as part of a new vulnerability assessment framework. The method is developed in the context of the direct and indirect socioeconomic impacts of a Ukrainian-style cyber-physical attack taking place on the electricity distribution network serving London and its surrounding regions. A key finding is that if decision-makers wish to mitigate major population disruptions, then they must invest resources more-or-less equally across all substations, to prevent the scaling of a cyber-physical attack. However, there are some substations associated with higher economic value due to their support of other Critical National Infrastructures assets, which justifies the allocation of additional cyber security investment to reduce the chance of cascading failure. Further cyber-physical vulnerability research must address the tradeoffs inherent in a system made up of multiple institutions with different strategic risk mitigation objectives and metrics of value, such as governments, infrastructure operators, and commercial consumers of infrastructure services."

The subjects (n=1876) were adult Hispanic male MR. Fast-MR (cases; n=938) were finishers in the top 3rd percentile. Slow MR (controls; n=938) were finishers in the lowest 3rd percentile of their respective age. Genomic DNA was purified from a whole blood sample. Polymerase chain reaction was used to amplify a KCNA4 SNP which consists of a C/T (rs1323860) transition. The observed genotype frequencies, in both Cases and Controls, met Hardy-Weinberg equilibrium (X2, P≥0.05). Genotype and allele frequencies were statistically different (P<0.01) between cases and controls. Odds ratio revealed that the C allele was 1.33 times more likely prevalent in the cases than in the controls (95% CI; 1.17, 1.51; P<0.001).

However, direct evidence demonstrating an essential role of sympathetic activation in PM2.5-associated disease progression is lacking. We assess the contribution of α2B-adrenergic receptor (Adra2b) in air pollution-associated hypertension and behavioral changes in this study. Wild-type mice and Adra2b-transgenic mice overexpressing Adra2b in the brain (Adra2bTg) were exposed to concentrated PM2.5 or filtered air for 3 months via a versatile aerosol concentrator exposure system. Mice were fed with a high salt diet (4.0% NaCl) for 1 week at week 11 of exposure to induce blood pressure elevation. Intra-arterial blood pressure was monitored by radio-telemetry and behavior changes were assessed by open field, light-dark, and prepulse inhibition tests. PM2.5 exposure increased Adra2b in the brain of wild-type mice. Adra2b overexpression enhanced the anxiety-like behavior and high salt diet-induced blood pressure elevation in response to air pollution but not filtered air exposure. Adra2b overexpression induced upregulation of inflammatory genes such as TLR2, TLR4, and IL-6 in the brain exposed to PM2.5. In addition, there were increased frequencies of activated effector T cells and increased expression of oxidative stress-related genes, such as SOD1, NQO1, Nrf2, and Gclm in Adra2bTg mice compared with wild-type mice. Our results provide new evidence of distinct behavioral changes consistent with anxiety and blood pressure elevation in response to high salt intake and air pollution exposure, highlighting the importance of centrally expressed Adra2b in the vulnerability to air pollution exposure.","Pain Prevalence, Characteristics, and Impact Among People with Hemophilia: Findings from the First Portuguese Survey and Implications for Pain Management.",https://www.ncbi.nlm.nih.gov/pubmed/30812031,"Pain medicine (Malden, Mass.)",2019 02 27,"Hemophilia is a rare disorder characterized by spontaneous bleeding, with pain being a critical aspect.

Condensed matter : an Institute of Physics journal,2019 04 10,"We have theoretically studied the Goos-Hänchen shift of spin and valley electron in single and double barrier WSe2 tunnelling junctions. For single barrier structure, it has shown that a two-fold degenerate lateral shift induced by the spin-valley locking occurs at Fabry-Perot resonance width. By introducing the ferromagnetic exchange field, one spin and valley dependent lateral shift can be further obtained. Different from single barrier structure, the double barrier structure exhibits two series of Fabry-Perot interferences with lateral shifts exceeding thousands of Fermi wavelengths due to the effect of localized states, and more important, these interferences generated between two potential barriers are even higher than the shift formed inside of two potential barriers. In addition, for a specified Fermi energy, one can modulate the desired spatial separation of spin and valley beam by controlling the incident angle or potential barrier. Our results demonstrate that the proposed WSe2 double barrier structure is a fascinating candidate for designing high-quality spin and valley beam splitter."

However, the toxic Pb is not environmentally friendly and the quantum yield (QY) of blue emitting NCs is relatively low. In addition, the red emitting perovskite containing iodine is not stable under light illumination. In this paper, high QY, blue emitting, non-toxic fluorescent nanomaterial carbon dots and orange-emitting CsPb0.81Mn0.19Cl3 NCs with partial Pb replacement are combined to fabricate white light-emitting diodes (WLEDs). A WLED with color coordinates of (0.337, 0.324) and a correlated color temperature of 4804 K is fabricated. Compared to red emitting perovskite containing iodine, the CsPb0.81Mn0.19Cl3 NCs are stable no matter whether they are stored in the air or exposed under ultraviolet light. Therefore, the as-fabricated WLED shows good color stability against increasing currents and long-term working stability.",The melanocortin pathway and control of appetite-progress and therapeutic implications.,https://www.ncbi.nlm.nih.gov/pubmed/30812013,The Journal of endocrinology,2019 05 07,"The initial discovery that ob/ob mice become obese because of a recessive mutation of the leptin gene has been crucial to discover the melanocortin pathway to control appetite. In the melanocortin pathway, the fed state is signaled by abundance of circulating hormones such as leptin and insulin, which bind to receptors expressed at the surface of pro-opiomelanocortin (POMC) neurons to promote processing of POMC to the mature hormone α-melanocyte-stimulating hormone (α-MSH). The α-MSH released by POMC neurons then signals to decrease energy intake by binding to melanocortin-4 receptor (MC4R) expressed by MC4R neurons to the paraventricular nucleus (PVN). Conversely, in the 'starved state' activity of agouti-related neuropeptide (AgRP) and of neuropeptide Y (NPY)-expressing neurons is increased by decreased levels of circulating leptin and insulin and by the orexigenic hormone ghrelin to promote food intake. This initial understanding of the melanocortin pathway has recently been implemented by the description of the complex neuronal circuit that controls the activity of POMC, AgRP/NPY and MC4R neurons and downstream signaling by these neurons. This review summarizes the progress done on the melanocortin pathway and describes how obesity alters this pathway to disrupt energy homeostasis. We also describe progress on how leptin and insulin receptors signal in POMC neurons, how MC4R signals and how altered expression and traffic of MC4R change the acute signaling and desensitization properties of the receptor. We also describe how the discovery of the melanocortin pathway has led to the use of melanocortin agonists to treat obesity derived from genetic disorders.","Ficus retusa-stabilized gold and silver nanoparticles: Controlled synthesis, spectroscopic characterization, and sensing properties.",https://www.ncbi.nlm.nih.gov/pubmed/30812012,"Spectrochimica acta. Part A, Molecular and biomolecular spectroscopy",2019 03 18,"Ficus retusa was used as reducing and stabilizing agent in the green synthesis of silver and gold nanoparticles with high dispersion stability and controllable size and shape. The controlling of reaction conditions i.e. contact time, extract quantity, metal concentration, and pH value enables the tuning of the particle size and size distribution of the metal nanoparticles. UV-visible spectroscopy was used to follow the spectral profile changes of the surface plasmon resonance of the metal nanoparticles due to different treatments. The surface plasmon resonance varies between 400 and 432 nm and between 522 and 554 nm for silver and gold nanoparticles, respectively, depending on the different reaction parameters. Atomic force and transmission electron microscopy results confirmed the success of preparation of spherical silver (15 nm) and gold (10-25 nm) nanoparticles with narrow size-distribution. Fourier transform infrared spectroscopy suggested the phenolic compounds play the key role in the reduction and stabilizing of metal ions.

To investigate the accumulation and migration of P within soil profiles, a mesocosm experiment was conducted to analyze the content and leaching of soil P, metals, and dissolved organic carbon after different fertilization treatments, including control (no fertilizer, CK), chemical fertilizer (CF), chemical fertilizer combined low (CF + LPM) and high (CF + HPM) rate of manure application. Results showed that a high rate of manure application significantly enhanced the accumulation of total soil P (by ~14%) and P availability (easily-available P, by ~24%; Olsen-P, by ~20%) in topsoil, and also increased the content of easily-available organic P (EA-Po) in both topsoil and subsoil compared to the CK treatment. The migration of dissolved inorganic and organic P (DIP and DOP) in leachate within soil profiles was strengthened by manure application. Moreover, significant positive correlations between P, metals, and dissolved organic carbon (DOC) in leachate indicated that downward co-migration occurred within the soil profiles, and also suggested that excessive manure application can intensify the risk of P loss by increasing the migration of manure-derived DOC. Overall, our findings provide insights into P accumulation and migration within soil profiles after excessive manure application, which is useful for predicting the potential risk of P and metal leaching from paddy soils.",Evaluation of the effects of titanium dioxide and aluminum oxide nanoparticles through tarsal contact exposure in the model insect Oncopeltus fasciatus.,https://www.ncbi.nlm.nih.gov/pubmed/30812009,The Science of the total environment,2019 04 24,"Despite the increasing presence of metal nanoparticles in the biosphere as a consequence of their widespread use, knowledge about the impact of these nanoparticles on fauna, ecosystems and human health is far from completion. This is especially true for terrestrial invertebrates. Insects are environmentally exposed to nanoparticles by several ways, the ectopic contact being one of the most probable. The model insect Oncopeltus fasciatus, has been used in the present work for testing toxicity of nanoparticles present in a surface. Adverse effects of TiO2 nanoparticles and Al2O3 in nanoparticulated or bulk form on mortality, reproductive and embryonic developmental parameters have been analyzed after tarsal contact of adult individuals of O. fasciatus. Effects were monitored in the unexposed filial generation from control and exposed adults. In order to know the effect of the nanoparticles on the insect composition, measurements of protein and lipid content as well as lipid peroxidation were also performed. The results obtained indicate that the ectopic exposure to nanoparticles at 1 mg/cm2 (TiO2) and 0.5 mg/cm2 (Al2O3) did not induce lethal toxicity in O. fasciatus, nor did it modify any of the reproductive parameters. However, NPs-TiO2 and Al2O3 produced an increase in nymphal life span. In the parental generation NPs-TiO2 increased protein content whereas NPs-Al2O3 decreased it. Several effects were detected in the filial generation as consequence of parental exposure. NPs-Al2O3 decreased protein content, NPs-TiO2 decreased lipid content and Al2O3 in bulk form diminished protein content and increased lipid peroxidation. Responses observed in the individuals of the filial generation demonstrate the existence of trans-generational effects of NPs-Al2O3 and NPs-TiO2.",Microbial bioremediation of oil contaminated seawater: A survey of patent deposits and the characterization of the top genera applied.,https://www.ncbi.nlm.nih.gov/pubmed/30812008,The Science of the total environment,2019 04 24,"Petroleum has been the world's major source of energy since the middle of the twentieth century, leading to positive changes but also social, political, and environmental problems worldwide. Oil contamination affects all ecosystems, and the remediation of polluted sites using environmentally friendly strategies is crucial. Here, we report an analysis of the patent documents of potential petroleum bioremediation techniques that use microbes to clean seawater. The patent search was performed using Orbit Intelligence®, SciFinder® and the Derwent World Patents Index®. A group of 500 patent documents were validated according to the search objective and carefully studied. Increases in patent deposits coincide with periods following widely reported oil spills, suggesting a relationship between media disclosure and stimulation of innovation activities. China leads the list of countries with patent applications in bioremediation with 152 deposits, followed by Russia with 133 and the US with 48. These three countries have completely different temporal deposit profiles, influenced by their historical, political, and economic scenarios. A total of 368 patents described degradation of the oil compounds exclusively by bacteria, 24 by fungi and yeasts, 1 by Archaea, 1 using a microalgal strain, and 32 by mixed consortia. The leading microbial genera found in the patents are Pseudomonas (114 patents), Bacillus (75), and Rhodococcus (60). In the top-10 list of microbial strains mostly cited/claimed, no genera are obligate hydrocarbonoclastic bacteria. This fact, together with the broad pattern found in the main International Patent Classification (IPC) codes, suggest that most of the documents are general bioremediation approaches and not focused on oil-polluted seawater. This work highlights the importance of stimulating the development of innovative environmentally friendly strategies focused on the degradation of oil hydrocarbons in marine ecosystems.",Persistent and emerging pollutants assessment on aquaculture oysters (Crassostrea gigas) from NW Portuguese coast (Ria De Aveiro).,https://www.ncbi.nlm.nih.gov/pubmed/30812007,The Science of the total environment,2019 04 24,"The study aim was to determine a range of relevant persistent and emerging pollutants in oysters produced in an aquaculture facility located in an important production area, to assure their safety for human consumption. Pollutants, including 16 PAHs, 3 butyltins (BTs), 29 flame retardants (FRs, including organophosphate and halogenated FRs), 35 pesticides (including 9 pyrethroid insecticides) and 13 personal care products (PCPs, including musks and UV filters), were determined in oysters' tissues collected during one year in four seasonal sampling surveys. The seasonal environmental pollution on the production site was evaluated by water and sediment analysis. Furthermore, oysters' nutritional quality was also assessed and related with the consumption of healthy seafood, showing that oysters are a rich source of protein with low fat content and with a high quality index all year around. Results showed that most analysed pollutants were not detected either in oyster tissues or in environmental matrixes (water and sediments). The few pollutants detected in oyster tissues, including both regulated and non-legislated pollutants, such as a few PAHs (fluorene, phenanthrene, anthracene, fluoranthene, pyrene and indenopyrene), FRs (TPPO, TDCPP, DCP, BDE-47, BDE-209 and Dec 602) and PCPs (galaxolide, galaxolidone, homosalate and octocrylene), were present at low levels (in the ng/g dw range) and did not represent a significant health risk to humans. The observed seasonal variations related to human activities (e.g. tourism in summer) highlights the need for environmental protection and sustainable resource exploration for safe seafood production.","The effects of freeze-thaw process on soil water migration in dam and slope farmland on the Loess Plateau, China.",https://www.ncbi.nlm.nih.gov/pubmed/30812006,The Science of the total environment,2019 04 11,"The seasonal freeze-thaw process affects soil water migration, which influence spring planting, especially in arid and semi-arid regions that cannot be irrigated on the Loess Plateau. This study was conducted to evaluate differences in the freeze-thaw process and water migration between dam farmland (DF) and slope farmland (SF). To accomplish this, two typical agricultural soils (DF and SF), soil water content (SWC) and soil temperature (ST) were monitored at different depths (15, 30, 60 and 90 cm), were investigated under freeze-thaw conditions from November 2015 to April 2016 in the Northwest China. The results showed that different freeze-thaw process between dam farmland (DF) and slope farmland (SF). The DF can keep soil water content resulting from longer frozen period. Thermal transmission between soil and air in SF is greater than that in DF. The SWC values in DF were higher than in SF at each depth layer under similar soil temperature. Migrated and incremental SWC in the DF is greater than that in SF during the freeze-thaw process. The initial SWC is the main impact on freeze-thaw process in this study. This research can provide useful information to guide the water management of seasonally frozen agricultural soil.",Forest edge effects on the mycorrhizal communities of the dual-mycorrhizal tree species Alnus glutinosa (L.) Gaertn.,https://www.ncbi.nlm.nih.gov/pubmed/30812005,The Science of the total environment,2019 04 24,"Forest conversion into agricultural land has resulted in a continuous decline in forest cover and in a reduced size and increased edge-to-core ratio of the remaining fragments. Forest edges are more directly exposed to sunlight, wind and pollutants and the resulting changes in habitat quality might have a large impact on plant and animal communities. Few studies, however, have focused on forest edge effects on mycorrhizal fungus communities. Here, we used high-throughput sequencing to study how communities of arbuscular mycorrhizal (AMF) and ectomycorrhizal fungi (EcMF), present in both the roots of the dual mycorrhizal tree Alnus glutinosa and in the soil, changed with increasing distance from the forest edge within fragmented forests embedded in an intensively managed agricultural matrix. Overall, we found 158 AMF OTUs and 275 EcMF OTUs. Soil moisture content increased with increasing distance from the forest edge, whereas soil nitrate concentration increased with increasing distance in south-facing and decreased in north-facing edges. Distance to the forest edge had a significant effect on EcMF community composition that largely overlapped with the observed changes in soil variables, especially soil moisture content. Apart from this distance effect, there were also clear effects of edge orientation on mycorrhizal diversity and community composition. While AMF OTU richness was higher at south- than at north-facing edges, the opposite pattern was found for EcMF. Community composition of both mycorrhiza types also differed significantly between south- and north-facing edges. We conclude that altered environmental conditions at forest edges cause significant changes in mycorrhizal communities, which could subsequently affect ecosystem functioning.",Adsorption recovery of phosphate from aqueous solution by CaO-biochar composites prepared from eggshell and rice straw.,https://www.ncbi.nlm.nih.gov/pubmed/30812004,The Science of the total environment,2019 04 24,"CaO-biochar composites were prepared by mixed ball milling and pyrolysis of agricultural wastes eggshell and rice straw. The resulting CaO-biochar composites (E-C) showed excellent performance for phosphate adsorption from aqueous solution in a wide range of solution pH (5-11), and a maximum adsorption capacity of 231 mg/g could be obtained by E-C sample that was prepared from the eggshell and rice straw with a mass ratio of 1:1 (E-C 1:1). The adsorption of phosphate onto the E-C samples could be well described by pseudo-second-order (R2 > 0.975) and Langmuir models (R2 > 0.979). Thermodynamic analysis revealed that the adsorption process was spontaneous (ΔG0 < 0) and endothermic (ΔH0 > 0). This work provides a promising method to prepare functionalized biochar adsorbents from agricultural wastes for the recovery of phosphate from aqueous solution, and the phosphate adsorbed CaO-biochar composites can be directly applied as a slow-release fertilizer to farmland soil, which have the functions of improving soil physical structure, increasing soil fertility, and regulating soil pH."

Despite much interest, the genetic basis of these hallmark traits remains poorly understood. Herein, we assembled high-quality genome and transcriptome data from G. mellonella to investigate long-chain hydrocarbon wax metabolism strategies. Specific carboxylesterase and lipase and fatty-acid-metabolism-related enzymes in the G. mellonella genome are transcriptionally regulated during feeding on beeswax. Strikingly, G. mellonella lacking intestinal microbiota successfully decomposes long-chain fatty acids following wax metabolism, although the intestinal microbiome performs a supplementary role in short-chain fatty acid degradation. Notably, final wax derivatives were detected by gas chromatography even in the absence of gut microbiota. Our findings provide insight into wax moth adaptation and may assist in the development of unique wax-degradation strategies with a similar metabolic approach for a plastic molecule polyethylene biodegradation using organisms without intestinal microbiota.",Mammalian Pum1 and Pum2 Control Body Size via Translational Regulation of the Cell Cycle Inhibitor Cdkn1b.,https://www.ncbi.nlm.nih.gov/pubmed/30811992,Cell reports,2019 04 03,"Body and organ size regulation in mammals involves multiple signaling pathways and remains largely enigmatic. Here, we report that Pum1 and Pum2, which encode highly conserved PUF RNA-binding proteins, regulate mouse body and organ size by post-transcriptional repression of the cell cycle inhibitor Cdkn1b. Binding of PUM1 or PUM2 to Pumilio binding elements (PBEs) in the 3' UTR of Cdkn1b inhibits translation, promoting G1-S transition and cell proliferation. Mice with null mutations in Pum1 and Pum2 exhibit gene dosage-dependent reductions in body and organ size, and deficiency for Cdkn1b partially rescues postnatal growth defects in Pum1-/- mice. We propose that coordinated tissue-specific expression of Pum1 and Pum2, which involves auto-regulatory and reciprocal post-transcriptional repression, contributes to the precise regulation of body and organ size. Hence PUM-mediated post-transcriptional control of cell cycle regulators represents an additional layer of control in the genetic regulation of organ and body size.",Positive and Negative Control of Enhancer-Promoter Interactions by Other DNA Loops Generates Specificity and Tunability.,https://www.ncbi.nlm.nih.gov/pubmed/30811991,Cell reports,2019 02 27,"Enhancers are ubiquitous and critical gene-regulatory elements. However, quantitative understanding of the role of DNA looping in the regulation of enhancer action and specificity is limited. We used the Escherichia coli NtrC enhancer-σ54 promoter system as an in vivo model, finding that NtrC activation is highly sensitive to the enhancer-promoter (E-P) distance in the 300-6,000 bp range. DNA loops formed by Lac repressor were able to strongly regulate enhancer action either positively or negatively, recapitulating promoter targeting and insulation. A single LacI loop combining targeting and insulation produced a strong shift in specificity for enhancer choice between two σ54 promoters. A combined kinetic-thermodynamic model was used to quantify the effect of DNA-looping interactions on promoter activity and revealed that sensitivity to E-P distance and to control by other loops is itself dependent on enhancer and promoter parameters that may be subject to regulation.",Signal Integration by Shadow Enhancers and Enhancer Duplications Varies across the Drosophila Embryo.,https://www.ncbi.nlm.nih.gov/pubmed/30811990,Cell reports,2019 02 27,"Transcription of developmental genes is controlled by multiple enhancers. Frequently, more than one enhancer can activate transcription from the same promoter in the same cells. How is regulatory information from multiple enhancers combined to determine the overall expression output? We measure nascent transcription driven by a pair of shadow enhancers, each enhancer of the pair separately, and each duplicated, using live imaging in Drosophila embryos. This set of constructs allows us to quantify the input-output function describing signal integration by two enhancers. We show that signal integration performed by these shadow enhancers and duplications varies across the expression pattern, implying that how their activities are combined depends on the transcriptional regulators bound to the enhancers in different parts of the embryo. Characterizing signal integration by multiple enhancers is a critical step in developing conceptual and computational models of gene expression at the locus level, where multiple enhancers control transcription together.",Myeloid Cells Restrict MCMV and Drive Stress-Induced Extramedullary Hematopoiesis through STAT1.,https://www.ncbi.nlm.nih.gov/pubmed/30811989,Cell reports,2019 04 06,"Cytomegalovirus (CMV) has a high prevalence worldwide, is often fatal for immunocompromised patients, and causes bone marrow suppression. Deficiency of signal transducer and activator of transcription 1 (STAT1) results in severely impaired antiviral immunity. We have used cell-type restricted deletion of Stat1 to determine the importance of myeloid cell activity for the defense against murine CMV (MCMV). We show that myeloid STAT1 limits MCMV burden and infection-associated pathology in the spleen but does not affect ultimate clearance of infection. Unexpectedly, we found an essential role of myeloid STAT1 in the induction of extramedullary hematopoiesis (EMH). The EMH-promoting function of STAT1 was not restricted to MCMV infection but was also observed during CpG oligodeoxynucleotide-induced sterile inflammation. Collectively, we provide genetic evidence that signaling through STAT1 in myeloid cells is required to restrict MCMV at early time points post-infection and to induce compensatory hematopoiesis in the spleen.",The N-Terminal Domain of cGAS Determines Preferential Association with Centromeric DNA and Innate Immune Activation in the Nucleus.,https://www.ncbi.nlm.nih.gov/pubmed/30811988,Cell reports,2019 03 13,"Cytosolic DNA activates cyclic guanosine monophosphate-adenosine monophosphate (cGAMP) synthase (cGAS), an innate immune sensor pivotal in anti-microbial defense, senescence, auto-immunity, and cancer. cGAS is considered to be a sequence-independent DNA sensor with limited access to nuclear DNA because of compartmentalization. However, the nuclear envelope is a dynamic barrier, and cGAS is present in the nucleus. Here, we identify determinants of nuclear cGAS localization and activation. We show that nuclear-localized cGAS synthesizes cGAMP and induces innate immune activation of dendritic cells, although cGAMP levels are 200-fold lower than following transfection with exogenous DNA. Using cGAS ChIP-seq and a GFP-cGAS knockin mouse, we find nuclear cGAS enrichment on centromeric satellite DNA, confirmed by imaging, and to a lesser extent on LINE elements. The non-enzymatic N-terminal domain of cGAS determines nucleo-cytoplasmic localization, enrichment on centromeres, and activation of nuclear-localized cGAS. These results reveal a preferential functional association of nuclear cGAS with centromeres.",Rhythmic Pruning of Perceptual Noise for Object Representation in the Hippocampus and Perirhinal Cortex in Rats.,https://www.ncbi.nlm.nih.gov/pubmed/30811987,Cell reports,2019 02 27,"Neurons in the temporal cortex signal object familiarity by modulating their spiking activity as the object is repeatedly experienced. However, the neural mechanisms underlying this ""repetition effect"" and its functional significance remain unknown. We investigated this process in a goal-directed object recognition task in which rats were required to recognize familiar and novel objects. Single-unit spiking activity and local field potential were recorded from the hippocampus and perirhinal cortex (PER) as rats performed the task. Repetition effects were detected in both the hippocampus and PER. However, phase-locking to the theta rhythm was strengthened with object repetitions in the hippocampus but not in the PER, whereas stronger phase-locking was observed with gamma rhythm in the PER but not in the hippocampus. Our findings suggest that the repetition effect occurs in sync with different rhythmic oscillations across different regions and may underlie neural ""pruning"" of noise that facilitates object recognition.",Communication between the Anterior Cingulate Cortex and Ventral Tegmental Area during a Cost-Benefit Reversal Task.,https://www.ncbi.nlm.nih.gov/pubmed/30811986,Cell reports,2019 02 27,"The anterior cingulate cortex (ACC) is implicated in value-based decision making, anticipation, and adaptation; however, how ACC activity modulates these behaviors is unclear. One possibility is via the ACC's connections with the ventral tegmental area (VTA), a dopaminergic region implicated in motivation and feedback processing. We tested this by monitoring ACC and VTA local field potentials in rats performing a cost-benefit reversal task that elicited both value-based and anticipatory choices. Partial directed coherence analyses revealed that elevated 4-Hz ACC-to-VTA signaling accompanied decisions that appeared to be anticipatory. ACC-to-VTA signaling also occurred post-reversal, consistent with it being involved in the initiation of non-default behavior. An analysis of 4-Hz signals in the other direction (VTA-to-ACC) revealed that it was elevated when the rats committed errors and that this signal was followed by behavioral adaptation. Together, these findings suggest that bidirectional communication between the ACC and VTA supports behavioral flexibility.",An Electrostatic Energy Barrier for SNARE-Dependent Spontaneous and Evoked Synaptic Transmission.,https://www.ncbi.nlm.nih.gov/pubmed/30811985,Cell reports,2019 02 27,"Information transfer across CNS synapses depends on the very low basal vesicle fusion rate and the ability to rapidly upregulate that rate upon Ca2+ influx. We show that local electrostatic repulsion participates in creating an energy barrier, which limits spontaneous synaptic transmission. The barrier amplitude is increased by negative charges and decreased by positive charges on the SNARE-complex surface. Strikingly, the effect of charges on the barrier is additive and this extends to evoked transmission, but with a shallower charge dependence. Action potential-driven synaptic release is equivalent to the abrupt addition of ∼35 positive charges to the fusion machine. Within an electrostatic model for triggering, the Ca2+ sensor synaptotagmin-1 contributes ∼18 charges by binding Ca2+, while also modulating the fusion barrier at rest. Thus, the energy barrier for synaptic vesicle fusion has a large electrostatic component, allowing synaptotagmin-1 to act as an electrostatic switch and modulator to trigger vesicle fusion.",Regenerating Corticospinal Axons Innervate Phenotypically Appropriate Neurons within Neural Stem Cell Grafts.,https://www.ncbi.nlm.nih.gov/pubmed/30811984,Cell reports,2019 05 01,"Neural progenitor cell grafts form new relays across sites of spinal cord injury (SCI). Using a panel of neuronal markers, we demonstrate that spinal neural progenitor grafts to sites of rodent SCI adopt diverse spinal motor and sensory interneuronal fates, representing most neuronal subtypes of the intact spinal cord, and spontaneously segregate into domains of distinct cell clusters. Host corticospinal motor axons regenerating into neural progenitor grafts innervate appropriate pre-motor interneurons, based on trans-synaptic tracing with herpes simplex virus. A human spinal neural progenitor cell graft to a non-human primate also received topographically appropriate corticospinal axon regeneration. Thus, grafted spinal neural progenitor cells give rise to a variety of neuronal progeny that are typical of the normal spinal cord; remarkably, regenerating injured adult corticospinal motor axons spontaneously locate appropriate motor domains in the heterogeneous, developing graft environment, without a need for additional exogenous guidance."

The proposed approach allows for: (1) the selection of key concepts based on graph theory metrics and determining the connections between them; (2) the determination of the criterion of learning based on output concepts and fitting the learning process to the analyzed problem. A simulation analysis was done with the use of synthetic and real-life data. Experiments confirm that the proposed approach improves the learning process compared to the standard approaches.",Neural Correlations Underlying Self-Generated Decision in the Frontal Pole Cortex during a Cued Strategy Task.,https://www.ncbi.nlm.nih.gov/pubmed/30811970,Neuroscience,2019 06 03,"We have previously shown how the Frontal Pole cortex (FPC) neurons play a unique role in both the monitoring and evaluating of self-generated decisions during feedback in a visually cued strategy task. For each trial of this task, a cue instructed one of two strategies: to either stay with the previous goal or shift to the alternative goal. Each cue was followed by a delay period, then each choice was followed by a feedback. FPC neurons show goal-selective activity exclusively during the feedback period. Here, we studied how neural correlation dynamically changes, along with a trial in FPC. We classified the cells as goal-selective and not goal-selective (NS) and analyzed the time-course of the cross-correlations in 76 pairs of neurons from each group. We compared a control epoch with the feedback epoch and we found higher correlations in the latter one between goal-selective neurons than between NS neurons, in which the correlated activity dropped during feedback. This supports the involvement of goal-selective cells in the evaluation of self-generated decisions at the feedback time. We also observed a dynamic change of the correlations in time, indicating that the connections among cell-assemblies were transient, changing between internal states at the feedback time. These results indicate that the changing of the pattern of neural correlations can underlie the flexibility of the prefrontal computations.",Use of microdialysis for the assessment of fluoroquinolone pharmacokinetics in the clinical practice.,https://www.ncbi.nlm.nih.gov/pubmed/30811969,European journal of pharmaceutical sciences : official journal of the European Federation for Pharmaceutical Sciences,2019 03 09,"Antibacterial drugs, including fluoroquinolones, can exert their therapeutic action only with adequate penetration at the infection site. Multiple factors, such as rate of protein binding, drug liposolubility and organ blood-flow all influence ability of antibiotics to penetrate target tissues. Microdialysis is an in vivo sampling technique that has been successfully applied to measure the distribution of fluoroquinolones in the interstitial fluid of different tissues both in animal studies and clinical setting. Tissue concentrations need to be interpreted within the context of the pathogenesis and causative agents implicated in infections. Integration of microdialysis -derived tissue pharmacokinetics with pharmacodynamic data offers crucial information for correlating exposure with antibacterial effect. This review explores these concepts and provides an overview of tissue concentrations of fluoroquinolones derived from microdialysis studies and explores the therapeutic implications of fluoroquinolone distribution at various target tissues.",p16Ink4a deletion in cells of the intervertebral disc affects their matrix homeostasis and senescence associated secretory phenotype without altering onset of senescence.,https://www.ncbi.nlm.nih.gov/pubmed/30811968,Matrix biology : journal of the International Society for Matrix Biology,2019 06 10,"Intervertebral disc degeneration is an important contributor to chronic low back and neck pain. Although many environmental and genetic factors are known to contribute to disc degeneration, age is still the most significant risk factor. Recent studies have shown that senescence may play a role in age-related disc degeneration and matrix catabolism in humans and mouse models. Clearance of p16Ink4a-positive senescent cells reduces the degenerative phenotype in many age-associated diseases. Whether p16Ink4a plays a functional role in intervertebral disc degeneration and senescence is unknown. We first characterized the senescence status of discs in young and old mice. Quantitative histology, gene expression and a novel p16tdTom reporter mice showed an increase in p16Ink4a, p21 and IL-6, with a decrease in Ki67 with aging. Accordingly, we studied the spinal-phenotype of 18-month-old mice with conditional deletion of p16Ink4a in the disc driven by Acan-CreERT2 (cKO). The analyses of discs of cKO and age-matched control mice showed little change in cell morphology and tissue architecture. The cKO mice exhibited changes in functional attributes of aggrecan as well as in collagen composition of the intervertebral disc. While cKO discs exhibited a small decrease in TUNEL positive cells, lineage tracing experiments using ZsGreen reporter indicated that the overall changes in cell fate or numbers were minimal. The cKO mice maintained expression of NP-cell phenotypic markers CA3, Krt19 and GLUT-1. Moreover, in cKO discs, levels of p19Arf and RB were higher without alterations in Ki67, γH2AX, CDK4 and Lipofuscin deposition. Interestingly, the cKO discs showed lower levels of SASP markers, IL-1β, IL-6, MCP1 and TGF-β1. These results show that while, p16Ink4a is dispensable for induction and maintenance of senescence, conditional loss of p16Ink4a reduces apoptosis, limits the SASP phenotype and alters matrix homeostasis of disc cells.","Identification of the B-cell epitopes on N protein of type 2 porcine reproductive and respiratory syndrome virus, using monoclonal antibodies.",https://www.ncbi.nlm.nih.gov/pubmed/30811967,International journal of biological macromolecules,2019 04 17,"Porcine reproductive and respiratory syndrome virus (PRRSV) nucleocapsid protein (N) is the immunodominant region of PRRSV viral proteins. However, B cell epitopes present on N protein have not been well characterized. In this study, The ORF7 gene was amplified by RT-PCR and inserted into the expression vector pET-28a, the constructed pET-28a-N was transformed into Escherichia coli BL21. After expression, purification and identification, the recombined N protein was used as the target to generate monoclonal antibody (mAb). Strains of hybridoma cells secreting anti-N mAbs were obtained by the hybridoma technique. Three of them (named 1G4, 1C6, 3D11) were specifically reacted with PRRSV by IPMA and IFA. To identify the B-cell epitopes within PRRSV N protein, six serial overlapping synthesized peptides (P1-P6) covering the whole region of N were used to define the epitopes recognized by 1G4, 1C6, 3D11. Importantly, after the identification of dot-ELISA and indirect ELISA, we found that 1-15aa was a new epitope which had never been reported before and that it was highly conserved among some HP-PRRSV isolates of type 2 PRRSV.

Nuclear speckles are nuclear subcompartments involved in RNA maturation. Previously, we showed that SPAG16S is essential for spermatogenesis. In the present study, a specific antibody against mouse Elongin B was generated and reacted with a protein with the predicted size of Elongin B in the testis; immunofluorescence staining revealed that the Elongin B was located in the nuclei and residual bodies. In round spermatids, Elongin B was colocalised with splicing factor SC35 (SC35), a marker of nuclear speckles. During the first wave of spermatogenesis, Elongin B transcripts were initially detected at Postnatal Day (PND) 8, and levels were greatly increased afterwards. However, Elongin B protein was only found from PND30, when germ cells progressed through spermiogenesis. Polysomal gradient analysis of Elongin B transcripts isolated from adult mouse testes revealed that most of the Elongin B mRNA was associated with translationally inactive, non-polysomal ribonucleoproteins. An RNA electrophoretic mobility shift assay demonstrated that the 3' untranslated region of the Elongin B transcript was bound by proteins present in testis but not liver extracts. These findings suggest that post-transcriptional regulation of Elongin B occurs in the testis, which is a common phenomenon during male germ cell development. As a major binding partner of SPAG16S, Elongin B may play an important role in spermatogenesis by modulating RNA maturation.","Enzyme-Inhibitor Interactions and a Simple, Rapid Method for Determining Inhibition Modality.",https://www.ncbi.nlm.nih.gov/pubmed/30811960,SLAS discovery : advancing life sciences R & D,2019 05 20,"Contemporary chemical biology and drug discovery are increasingly focused on the discovery of inhibitory molecules that interact with enzyme targets in specific ways, such as allosteric or orthosteric binding. Hence, there is increasing interest in evaluating hit compounds from high-throughput diversity screening to determine their mode of interaction with the target. In this work, the common inhibition modalities are reviewed and clarified. The impact of substrate concentration, relative to substrate KM, for each common inhibition modality is also reviewed. The pattern of changes in IC50 that accompany increasing substrate concentration are shown to be diagnostic of specific inhibition modalities. Thus, replots of IC50 as a function of the ratio [S]/KM are recommended as a simple and rapid means of assessing inhibition modality. Finally, specific recommendations are offered for ideal experimental conditions for the determination of inhibition modality through the use of IC50 replots."

Typically, the amount of dissipation dilution and thus the resonator Q is limited by the high mode curvature region near the clamps. Here we study the effect of clamp geometry on the Q of nanobeams made of high-stress Si3N4. We find that tapering the beam near the clamps, thus locally increasing the stress, leads to an increased Q of MHz-frequency low order modes due to enhanced dissipation dilution. Contrary to recent studies of tethered-membrane resonators, we find that widening the clamps leads to a decreased Q despite increased stress in the beam bulk. The tapered-clamping approach has practical advantages compared to the recently developed ""soft-clamping"" technique, as it enhances the Q of the fundamental mode and can be implemented without increasing the device size.",Controlling the Spatial Distribution of Solubilized Compounds within Copolymer Micelles.,https://www.ncbi.nlm.nih.gov/pubmed/30811942,Langmuir : the ACS journal of surfaces and colloids,2019 04 07,"The solubilization of lyophobic compounds in block copolymer micelles has been extensively investigated but remains only partially understood. There is a need to understand the fundamental parameters that determine the spatial distribution of the solubilized compounds within the micelles. Controlling this feature is a key aspect in the design of drug delivery systems with tailored release properties. Using Scheutjens-Fleer self-consistent field (SF-SCF) computations, we found that solubilization is regulated by a complex interplay between enthalpic and entropic contributions and that the spatial distribution can be controlled by the concentration and solubility of the guest compound in the dispersion medium. Upon solubilization, a characteristic change in size and mass of the micelles is predicted. This can be used as a fingerprint to indirectly assess the spatial distribution. Based on these findings, we developed two experimental protocols to control and assess the spatial distribution of lyophobic compounds within block copolymer micelles.",Shape-Selective Electroless Plating within Expanding Template Pores: Etching-Assisted Deposition of Spiky Nickel Nanotube Networks.,https://www.ncbi.nlm.nih.gov/pubmed/30811941,Langmuir : the ACS journal of surfaces and colloids,2019 03 26,"Nano-objects are favored structures for applications such as catalysis and sensing. Although they already provide a large surface-to-volume ratio, this ratio can be further increased by shape-selective plating of the nanostructure surfaces. This process combines the conformity of autocatalytic deposition with the defined nucleation and growth characteristics of colloidal nanoparticle syntheses. However, many aspects of such reactions are still not fully understood. In this study, we investigate in detail the growth of spiky nickel nanotubes in polycarbonate template membranes. One distinctive feature of our synthesis is the simultaneous growth of nanospikes on both the inside and outside of nanotubes while the tubes are still embedded in the polymer. This is achieved by combining the plating process with locally enhanced in situ etching of the poylmer template, for which we propose a theory. Electron microscopy investigations reveal twinning defects as the driving force for the growth of crystalline nanospikes. Deposit crystallinity is ensured by the reducing agent hydrazine. Iminodiacetic acid is not only used as a complexing agent during synthesis but apparently also acts as a capping agent and limits random nucleation on the spike facets. Finally, we apply our synthesis to templates with interconnected pores to obtain free-standing spiky nickel nanotube networks, demonstrating its ability to homogeneously coat substrates with extended inner surfaces and to operate in nanoscale confinement.",Dynamic Plasticity and Failure of Microscale Glass: Rate-Dependent Ductile-Brittle-Ductile Transition.,https://www.ncbi.nlm.nih.gov/pubmed/30811940,Nano letters,2019 04 15,"Glass has been recently envisioned as a stronger and more robust alternative to silicon in microelectromechanical system applications, including high-frequency resonators and switches. Identifying the dynamic mechanical properties of microscale glass is thus vital for understanding their ability to withstand shocks and vibrations in such demanding applications. However, despite nearly half a century of research, the micromechanical properties of glass and amorphous materials in general are primarily limited to quasi-static strain rates below ∼0.1/s. Here, we report the in situ high-strain-rate experiments of fused silica micropillars inside a scanning electron microscope at strain rates up to 1335/s. A remarkable ductile-brittle-ductile failure mode transition was observed at increasing strain rates from 0.0008 to 1335/s as the deformation flow transitions between homogeneous-serrated-homogeneous regimes. Detailed surface topography investigation of the tested micropillars revealed that at the intermediate strain rate (<∼6/s) serrated flow regime, the load drops are caused by the sequential propagation of individual shear bands. Further, analytical calculations and finite element simulations suggest that the atomistic mechanism responsible for the homogeneous stress-strain curves at very high strain rates (>∼64/s) can be attributed to the simultaneous nucleation of multiple shear bands along with dissipative deformation heating. This unique rate-dependent deformation behavior of the glass micropillars highlights the importance and need of extending such microscale high-strain-rate studies to other amorphous materials such as metallic glasses and amorphous metals and alloys. Such investigations can provide critical insights about the damage tolerance and crashworthiness of these materials for real-life applications.",Synergetic Effect of Ethyl Methyl Carbonate and Trimethyl Phosphate on BF4- Intercalation into a Graphite Electrode.,https://www.ncbi.nlm.nih.gov/pubmed/30811939,Langmuir : the ACS journal of surfaces and colloids,2019 03 19,"LiBF4-ethyl methyl carbonate (EMC)-based solutions have not been successfully employed in dual-ion batteries (DIBs) mainly on account of few solvated BF4- intercalations into graphite positive electrodes.

Based on the data HONO-related species and various parameters measured during the one-month campaign at Wangdu (a rural site in North China plain) in summer 2014, a box model was adopted with input of current literature parametrizations for various HONO sources (nitrogen dioxide heterogeneous conversion, photoenhanced conversion, photolysis of adsorbed nitric acid and particulate nitrate, acid displacement, and soil emission) to reveal the relative importance of each source at the rural site. The simulation results reproduced the observed HONO production rates during noontime in general but with large uncertainty from both the production and destruction terms. NO2 photoenhanced conversion and photolysis of particulate nitrate were found to be the two major mechanisms with large potential of HONO formation but the associated uncertainty may reduce their importance to be nearly negligible. Soil nitrite was found to be an important HONO source during fertilization periods, accounted for (80 ± 6)% of simulation HONO during noontime. For some episodes of the biomass burning, only the NO2 heterogeneous conversion to HONO was promoted significantly. In summary, the study of the HONO budget is still far from closed, which would require a significant effort on both the accurate measurement of HONO and the determination of related kinetic parameters for its production pathways.",High-Efficient Solar Cells Textured by Cu/Ag-Cocatalyzed Chemical Etching on Diamond Wire Sawing Multicrystalline Silicon.,https://www.ncbi.nlm.nih.gov/pubmed/30811936,ACS applied materials & interfaces,2019 03 18,"We reported a novel texture method through one-step Cu/Ag-cocatalyzed chemical etching which can be widely used in the photovoltaic industry because of its simple and low-cost process.

Catalytic oxidation is regarded as one of the most promising strategies for VOC removal from industrial waste streams. This Review systematically documents the progresses and developments made in the understanding and design of heterogeneous catalysts for VOC oxidation over the past two decades. It addresses in detail how catalytic performance is often drastically affected by the pollutant sources and reaction conditions. It also highlights the primary routes for catalyst deactivation and discusses protocols for their subsequent reactivation.

Some of these biologics inhibit HIV-1 entry with relatively modest and varied potency (IC50 = 190 nM to >1 μM). Here, we report that gp41 C-peptide helix-grafted Sac7d (Sac7d-Cpep) potently suppresses HIV-1 entry in a live virus assay (IC50 = 1.9-12.4 nM). Yeast display sequence optimization of solvent exposed helix residues led to new biologics with improved expression in E. coli (a common biosimilar expression host), with no appreciable change in entry inhibition. Evolved proteins inhibit the entry of a clinically relevant mutant of HIV-1 that is gp41 C-peptide sensitive and Enfuvirtide resistant. Fusion proteins designed for serum stability also potently suppress HIV-1 entry.

This is partly a result of the national opioid crisis, and it reflects increasing use of younger donors for pancreas transplant. The 2017 outcome report remains compromised by previous variation in reporting graft failure. Although the OPTN Pancreas Transplantation Committee has approved more precise definitions of pancreas graft failure, implementation of these definitions took place recently, and the data are not reflected in this report.",OPTN/SRTR 2017 Annual Data Report: Liver.,https://www.ncbi.nlm.nih.gov/pubmed/30811890,American journal of transplantation : official journal of the American Society of Transplantation and the American Society of Transplant Surgeons,2019 02 27,"Data on adult liver transplants performed in the US in 2017 are notable for (1) continued growth in numbers of new waitlist registrants (11,514) and of transplants performed (8,082); (2) continued increase in the transplant rate (51.5 per 100 waitlist-years); (3) a precipitous decrease in waitlist registrations and transplants for hepatitis C-related indications; (4) reciprocal increases in waitlist registrants and recipients with alcoholic liver disease and with clinical profiles consistent with non-alcoholic fatty liver disease; and (5) continued improvement in graft survival despite changing recipient characteristics such as older age and higher rates of obesity. Variability in transplant rates remained by candidate race, presence of hepatocellular carcinoma, urgency status (status 1A versus model for end-stage liver disease (MELD) score >35), and geography. More than half of all children listed for liver transplant in 2017 were aged younger than 5 years in 2017, and the highest rate of pretransplant mortality persisted for children aged younger than 1 year. Children underwent transplant at higher acuity than the past, as evidenced by higher MELD/pediatric end-stage liver disease scores and listings at status 1A and 1B. Higher acuity at transplant is likely due to lack of access to suitable donor organs, which has been compensated for by persistent trends toward use of partial or split liver grafts and ABO-incompatible grafts. Despite higher illness severity scores at transplant, pediatric graft and patient survival posttransplant have improved over time."

Unlike other opportunistic infections, no therapies have been shown to prevent BK. The purpose of the current study was to evaluate the safety and efficacy of ciprofloxacin for the prevention of BK viremia in kidney transplant recipients. Two hundred kidney transplant recipients were enrolled in a prospective, randomized, double-blind, placebo-controlled trial comparing a 3-month course of ciprofloxacin (n = 133) vs placebo (n = 67) for the prevention of BK viremia. The primary endpoint of BK viremia at month 6 posttransplant occurred in 25 (18.8%) patients in the ciprofloxacin group and 5 (7.5%) in the placebo group (P = .03). Higher rates of BK viremia (23.3% vs 11.9%; P = .06) and BK nephropathy (5.8% vs 1.5%; P = .26) remained at 12 months in the ciprofloxacin group.

Recently, lncRNA Sox2 overlapping transcript (SOX2-OT) has been identified as an oncogene in various cancers. However, the functional role and the regulatory mechanism of SOX2-OT in LSCC remains unclear. In this study, we found that SOX2-OT expression was increased and negatively correlated with PTEN expression in LSCC tissues. Furthermore, SOX2-OT overexpression promoted LSCC cell proliferation, migration, invasion, and suppressed cell apoptosis in vitro, as well as facilitated the in vivo tumorigenicity. By contrast, SOX2-OT silencing exerted the opposite effect. Mechanically, SOX2-OT interacted with EZH2 and recruited EZH2 to induce H3K27me3 and epigenetically inhibited PTEN expression in LSCC cells. Additionally, EZH2 silencing and PTEN overexpression significantly abrogated the SOX2-OT overexpression-mediated promotion of LSCC cell malignant behavior. Collectively, our findings demonstrate that SOX2-OT inhibits PTEN expression to facilitate LSCC development through EZH2-mediated H3K27me3. © 2019 IUBMB Life, 00(00):1-10, 2019.",Neutrophil-to-lymphocyte ratio in age-related macular degeneration: a systematic review and meta-analysis.,https://www.ncbi.nlm.nih.gov/pubmed/30811869,Acta ophthalmologica,2019 02 27,"Age-related macular degeneration (AMD) is aetiologically linked to immunological ageing and dysfunction. One aspect of this is the altered neutrophil-to-lymphocyte ratio (NLR), which in other domains have been associated with inflammation and angiogenesis, and therefore investigated in patients with AMD in several papers. In this systematic review and meta-analysis, we summarize findings in patients with AMD in relation to NLR, both qualitatively and quantitatively. We searched PubMed/MEDLINE, EMBASE, Web of Science, and the Cochrane Central and identified six studies from where we extracted data on 1178 individuals (777 patients with AMD and 401 healthy controls). Patients with AMD had a higher NLR (weighted mean difference: 0.37, CI 95% 0.08 to 0.66, p = 0.013) when compared to healthy controls. In subgroup analyses, we did not find a significant difference between patients with dry AMD and healthy controls (weighted mean difference: 0.34, CI 95% -0.03 to 0.69, p = 0.068), but did find a strong significant difference between patients with neovascular AMD and healthy controls (weighted mean difference: 0.54, CI 95% 0.23 to 0.86, p = 0.00068).

It is a real-time, label-free and non-invasive optical detection technique that has found wide applications in pharmaceutical industry as well as the biological and medical fields. Combining transmission measurement with optical trapping has emerged as a powerful tool allowing stable sample trapping, while also facilitating transmittance data analysis. In this study, a near-infrared laser beam emitting at a wavelength of 1064 nm was used for both optical trapping and transmission measurement investigation of human immunodeficiency virus 1 (HIV-1) infected and uninfected TZM-bl cells. The measurements of the transmittance intensity of individual cells in solution were carried out using a home built optical trapping system combined with laser transmission setup using a single beam gradient trap. Transmittance spectral intensity patterns revealed significant differences between the HIV-1 infected and uninfected cells. This result suggests that the transmittance data analysis technique used in this study has the potential to differentiate between infected and uninfected TZM-bl cells without the use of labels.

Ideal drug carriers should not only rapidly diffuse across mucus, but also bind the epithelium. Unfortunately, ligand-conjugated particles often exhibit poor penetration across mucus. In this work, we explored a two-step ""pretargeting"" approach through engineering a bispecific antibody that binds both cell-surface ICAM-1 and polyethylene glycol (PEG) on the surface of nanoparticles, thereby effectively decoupling cell targeting from particle design and formulation. When tested in a mucus-coated Caco-2 culture model that mimics the physiological process of mucus clearance, pretargeting increased the amount of PEGylated particles binding to cells by around 2-fold or more compared to either non-targeted or actively targeted PEGylated particles. Pretargeting also markedly enhanced particle retention in mouse intestinal tissues. Our work underscores pretargeting as a promising strategy to improve the delivery of therapeutics to mucosal surfaces."

The ability of these ionic liquids to precipitate dextran 100 kDa, increases with the elongation of ethylene glycol polymer chain. The established ionic liquid-based precipitation system was successfully applied to selectively precipitate polysaccharides from water extracts of three traditional Chinese medicines and the precipitation could be achieved in about 15 min. In addition, the different precipitation responses of acidic, neutral, and basic polysaccharides in the ionic liquid-based precipitation system and theoretical calculations both suggested that the selective precipitation of polysaccharides was probably mediated by interaction between ionic liquids and polysaccharides.

Great efforts have been carried out to improve purification conditions, such as resin characterization and designing alkali/acid stable resins with a longer lifetime. Modification of Protein A ligands and alternative formats such as monoliths membranes and microshperes have been tested to increase the purification performance.

However, the effects of chronic noise over a relatively long time scale of multiple days remain largely unclear. Bats rely mainly on acoustic signals for perception of environmental and social communication. Nearly all previous studies on noise-induced vocal adjustments have focused on echolocation pulse sounds. Relatively little is known regarding the effects of noise on social communication calls. Here, we examined the dynamic changes in the temporal parameters of echolocation and communication vocalizations of Vespertilio sinensis when exposed to traffic noise over multiple days. We found that the bats started to modify their echolocation vocalizations on the fourth day of noise exposure, with an increase of 42-91% in the total number of pulse sequences per day. Under noisy conditions, the number of pulses within a pulse sequence decreased by an average of 17.2%, resulting in a significantly slower number of pulses/sequence (P < 0.001). However, there was little change in the duration of a pulse sequence. These parameters were not significantly adjusted in most communication vocalizations under the noise condition (all P > 0.05), except that the duration decreased and the number of syllables/sequence increased in one type of communicative vocalizations (P < 0.05). This study suggests that bats routinely adjust temporal parameters of echolocation but rarely of communication vocalizations in response to noise condition. This article is protected by copyright.

In the mammalian brains the immunoreactivity of β-dystroglycan subunit delineates the vessels. The present results demonstrate similar patterns in other vertebrates except for anurans and the teleost groups Ostariophysi and Euteleostei. In this study we investigated one or two representative species of main groups of Chondrichthyes, teleost and non-teleost ray-finned fishes, urodeles, anurans, and reptiles. Five mammalian and three bird species were also investigated. Animals were obtained from breeders or fishermen. The presence of β-dystroglycan was investigated immunohistochemically in free-floating sections. Pre-embedding electron microscopical immunohistochemistry on Heterodontus japonicus shark brains demonstrated that in Elasmobranchii β-dystroglycan is also localized in the perivascular glial end-feet despite the different construction of their blood-brain barrier. The results indicated that the cerebrovascular β-dystroglycan immunoreactivity disappeared separately in anurans, and in teleosts, in the latter group before its division to Ostariophysi and Euteleostei. Immunohistochemistry in muscles and Western blots from brain homogenates, however, detected the presence of β-dystroglycan even in anurans and all teleosts. The possible explanation is that in the glial end-feet β-dystroglycan is masked in these animals, or disappeared during adaptation to the freshwater habitat. This article is protected by copyright.

Also, it improved mitochondrial biogenesis by increasing the peroxisome proliferator-activated receptor-gamma-coactivator 1-α level. It successfully restored redox potential as evidenced by marked alleviations of the nitric oxide and peroxynitrite levels, increasing total antioxidant capacity, and activating the superoxide dismutase enzyme.

It is known that METH negatively impacts the prefrontal cortex (PFC) leading to cognitive decline and addiction whereas modafinil enhances cognition and has a low abuse liability. We investigated if modafinil (90 mg/kg) and methamphetmine (METH) (1 mg/kg) may differentially influence the acetylation status of histones 3 and 4 (H3ac and H4ac) at proximal promoters of class I, II, III, and IV HDACs. We found that METH produced broader acetylation effects in comparison with modafinil in the medial PFC. For single dose, METH affected H4ac by increasing its acetylation at class I Hdac1 and class IIb Hdac10, decreasing it at class IIa Hdac4 and Hdac5. Modafinil increased H3ac and decreased H4ac of Hdac7. For mRNA, single-dose METH increased Hdac4 and modafinil increased Hdac7 expression. For repeated treatments (4 d after daily injections over 7 d), we found specific effects only for METH. We found that METH increased H4ac in class IIa Hdac4 and Hdac5 and decreased H3/H4ac at class I Hdac1, Hdac2, and Hdac8. At the mRNA level, repeated METH increased Hdac4 and decreased Hdac2. Class III and IV HDACs were only responsive to repeated treatments, where METH affected the H3/H4ac status of Sirt2, Sirt3, Sirt7, and Hdac11.

The maximum tubule penetration and percentage of penetration values were obtained from the microscopy images and were statistically analyzed with repeated measurements-ANOVA and the Tukey (HSD) test (p < 0.05). The percentages of dentinal tubule penetration of the groups were not statistically different. The maximum tubule penetration of the AH-P was statistically lower than that of the BC-P (p < 0.05). Plasma application had no affect on the percentage of dentinal tubule penetration. Under the conditions of this in vitro Endosequence-BC sealer showed higher maximum tubule penetration values than AH-Plus after NP treatment. Percentage of dentinal tubule penetration values of experimental groups was similar.,Hepatitis E virus in sheep in Italy.,https://www.ncbi.nlm.nih.gov/pubmed/30811818,Transboundary and emerging diseases,2019 05 20,"Hepatitis E virus (HEV) is the leading cause of human enterically transmitted viral hepatitis occurring around the world both as outbreaks and as sporadic cases. The accumulating literature indicates that domestic pigs and wild boars are the main reservoirs of genotype 3 and genotype 4 for human infections in industrialized countries. However, the recent identification of HEV from various animal species poses additional potential concerns for HEV zoonotic infection. In this study, the role of sheep as potential host of hepatitis E virus (HEV) was investigated. By screening 192 sheep from seven farms located in Abruzzo Region (Southern Italy), HEV-specific antibodies were detected in the sera of 41 animals (21.3%) whilst the RNA of HEV, genotype 3, was detected in 20 faecal (10.4%) and three serum samples (1.6%). Upon sequence analyses of a partial ORF2 gene region of eight HEV positive samples, the sheep sequences all grouped together within HEV genotype 3 subtype c, being most closely related to HEV strains identified in goat and wild boar from Abruzzo. This is the first study that demonstrates, serologically and molecularly, the presence of HEV in sheep population in a European country.",Correlation between skeletal muscle fiber type and free amino acid levels in Japanese Black steers.,https://www.ncbi.nlm.nih.gov/pubmed/30811817,Animal science journal = Nihon chikusan Gakkaiho,2019 05 17,"Free amino acids are important components of tastants and flavor precursors in meat. To clarify the correlation between muscle fiber type and free amino acids, we determined the concentrations of various free amino acids and dipeptides in samples of different muscle tissues (n = 21), collected from 26-month-old Japanese Black steers (n = 3) at 2 days postmortem. The proportions of the myosin heavy chain (MyHC), slow (MyHC1) and fast (MyHC2) isoforms were determined by sodium dodecyl sulfate-polyacrylamide gel electrophoresis (SDS-PAGE). The contents of free amino acids and dipeptides were measured by high performance liquid chromatography (HPLC). The MyHC isoform composition varied among the tissue samples. The MyHC1 proportion ranged from 6.9% ± 3.9% to 83.3% ± 16.7%. We confirmed that there was a strong positive correlation between MyHC1 composition and total free amino acid concentrations, including those for two dipeptides. Among the 31 measured free amino acids and dipeptides, 11 showed significant positive correlations and five showed significant negative correlations with MyHC1 composition. These results suggest that a high MyHC1 content induces high free amino acid contents in bovine muscles possibly because of greater oxidative metabolism. This high level of free amino acids could contribute to the intense flavor of meat that is rich in slow-twitch fibers.",Australian dietitians' beliefs and attitudes towards weight loss counselling and health at every size counselling for larger-bodied clients.,https://www.ncbi.nlm.nih.gov/pubmed/30811815,Nutrition & dietetics: the journal of the Dietitians Association of Australia,2019 02 27,"Research suggests that dietitians now employ weight-neutral (WN) approaches (Health at Every Size (HAES), Intuitive Eating and non-diet) as well as more traditional weight-centric (WC) approaches (weight loss counselling) to address adult weight concerns.

Treatment to produce ductal closure was widely practiced until the past decade, despite lack of evidence that it decreases morbidities or mortality. Meta-analyses of trials using nonsteroidal anti-inflammatory drugs have shown effectiveness in accelerating ductal closure, but no reduction in neonatal morbidities, regardless of agent used, indication, timing, gestational age, or route of administration. Surgical ligation closes the ductus but is associated with adverse effects. Recent experience with conservative approaches to treatment suggest improved neonatal outcomes and a high rate of spontaneous ductal closure after discharge. Careful postdischarge follow-up is important, however, because potential adverse effects of long-standing aortopulmonary shunts may be an indication for catheter-based ductal closure.

While the risks associated with surgical PDA ligation are well described, the available evidence base for alternative management strategies during infancy, including percutaneous closure or conservative (nonintervention) management, are not well explored. Among infants, the goals of this review are to: (a) use rigorous systematic review methodology to assess the quality and quantity of published reports on percutaneous closure vs surgical ligation; (b) compare outcomes of percutaneous closure vs conservative management; and (c) based on recommendations from the International PDA symposium, to elucidate needs and opportunities for future research and interdisciplinary collaboration. The available evidence base, as well as on broad consensus reached at the International PDA Symposium, suggests that a contemporary, pragmatic clinical trial comparing PDA treatment strategies is warranted. Additionally, quality assurance safeguards are necessary in the implementation of newer PDA closure devices.

However, when the ductus fails to close after birth, the pressures can cause blood to shunt from the aorta back into the lungs, causing pulmonary edema. This is called a left-to-right shunt. The patent ductus arteriosus (PDA) can also shunt blood from the pulmonary arteries to the aorta, bypassing the lungs and causing oxygen-poor blood to mix with the oxygen-rich blood circulating to the body. This is called a right-to-left shunt. Too much shunting in either direction can cause significant long-term problems for the neonate. These three case studies compare the outcomes of patients with PDAs closed using different treatment techniques.

The interobserver agreement for nuclear grading score was generally moderate (kappa value = 0.452). The best consistency fell on the chromatin features (kappa value = 0.658-1.000). A fair to moderate interobserver agreement was demonstrated in the evaluation of nuclear elongation, nuclear overlapping, membrane irregularities and distribution of papillary thyroid carcinoma (PTC) type nuclear features. A slight agreement was rendered for the evaluation of the nuclear enlargement. Intraobserver agreement was substantial to perfect when comparing results of both scoring systems. However, both scoring systems were not able to reliably separate NIFTP from an encapsulated follicular variant PTC with minimal lymph node metastasis or BRAFV600E mutation.

While the observed phase has been shown to convey unique brain information, the role of spatial source phase in representing the intrinsic activity of the brain is yet not clear. This study explores the spatial source phase for identifying spatial differences between patients with schizophrenia (SZs) and healthy controls (HCs) using complex-valued resting-state fMRI data from 82 individuals. ICA is first applied to preprocess fMRI data, and post-ICA phase de-ambiguity and denoising are then performed. The ability of spatial source phase to characterize spatial differences is examined by the homogeneity of variance test (voxel-wise F-test) with false discovery rate correction. Resampling techniques are performed to ensure that the observations are significant and reliable. We focus on two components of interest widely used in analyzing SZs, including the default mode network (DMN) and auditory cortex. Results show that the spatial source phase exhibits more significant variance changes and higher sensitivity to the spatial differences between SZs and HCs in the anterior areas of DMN and the left auditory cortex, compared to the magnitude of spatial activations. Our findings show that the spatial source phase can potentially serve as a new brain imaging biomarker and provide a novel perspective on differences in SZs compared to HCs, consistent with but extending previous work showing increased variability in patient data.",Highly Purified Human Extracellular Vesicles Produced by Stem Cells Alleviate Aging Cellular Phenotypes of Senescent Human Cells.,https://www.ncbi.nlm.nih.gov/pubmed/30811771,"Stem cells (Dayton, Ohio)",2019 05 30,"Extracellular vesicles (EVs), including exosomes and microvesicles, mediate intercellular communications and exert various biological activities via delivering unique cargos of functional molecules such as RNAs and proteins to recipient cells. Previous studies showed that EVs produced and secreted by human mesenchymal stem cells (MSCs) can substitute intact MSCs for tissue repair and regeneration. In this study, we examined properties and functions of EVs from human induced pluripotent stem cells (iPSCs) that can be cultured infinitely under a chemically defined medium free of any exogenous EVs. We collected and purified EVs secreted by human iPSCs and MSCs. Purified EVs produced by both stem cell types have similar sizes (∼150 nm in diameter), but human iPSCs produced 16-fold more EVs than MSCs. When highly purified iPSC-EVs were applied in culture to senescent MSCs that have elevated reactive oxygen species (ROS), human iPSC-EVs reduced cellular ROS levels and alleviated aging phenotypes of senescent MSCs. Our discovery reveals that EVs from human stem cells can alleviate cellular aging in culture, at least in part by delivering intracellular peroxiredoxin antioxidant enzymes.

Despite the growing number of studies on ANS, there have been no cross-cultural longitudinal studies to estimate both the development of ANS and the cross-cultural differences in ANS growth trajectories. In this study, we aimed to estimate the developmental trajectories of ANS from the beginning of formal education to the end of elementary school in two countries, Russia and Kyrgyzstan, which have similar organization of their educational systems but differences in socioeconomic status (SES) and in the results of large-scale educational assessments. To assess the developmental trajectories of ANS, we used a four-wave longitudinal study with 416 participants from two countries and applied the mixed effect growth approach and the latent class growth approach. Our analysis revealed that the rate of growth in ANS accuracy was higher for the Russian sample than for the Kyrgyz sample and that this difference remained significant even after controlling for fluid intelligence. We identified two latent classes of growth trajectories: the first class had a significant growth in ANS, whereas the second class had no growth. Comparing the distribution of latent classes within the two countries revealed that there was a significantly larger proportion of schoolchildren from the second class in Kyrgyzstan than in Russia.","Effects of three-month streptozotocin-induced diabetes in mice on blood platelet reactivity, COX-1 expression and adhesion potential.",https://www.ncbi.nlm.nih.gov/pubmed/30811756,International journal of experimental pathology,2019 04 23,"Diabetes is associated with an increased risk of cardiovascular disease.

Previously, alterations have been shown in COX-1 and protease activated receptor (PAR)-3 receptor expression in platelets in two animal models of diabetes, there have not been studies which address expression of these proteins in mice with long-term streptozotocin (STZ)-induced diabetes. We have also addressed the effect of diabetes on platelet adhesion under flow conditions. With the use of flow cytometry, we have shown that certain markers of platelet basal activation, such as active form of αIIb β3 and of CD40L were increased in STZ-induced diabetic mice. Platelets from STZ-induced diabetic mice were also more reactive when stimulated with PAR-4 activating peptide as revealed by higher expression of active form of αIIb β3 , membrane-bound on vWillebrand Factor and binding of exogenous fluorescein isothyanate-labelled fibrinogen. Expression of COX-1 and production of thromboxane A2 in platelets of STZ-induced diabetic mice were higher than in control animals. We observed no effect of diabetes on ability of platelets to form stable adhesions with fibrinogen in flow conditions.

The aim of the current study was to identify molecular characteristics of young patients with estrogen receptor (ER)-positive breast cancer by analyzing mutations and copy number variants (CNV), and by applying expression profiling. The whole exome and transcriptome of 47 Korean young breast cancer (KYBR) patients (age <35) were analyzed. Genomic profiles were constructed using mutations, CNV and differential gene expression from sequencing data. Pathway analyses were also performed using gene sets to identify biological processes. Our data were compared with young ER+ breast cancer patients in The Cancer Genome Atlas (TCGA) dataset. TP53, PIK3CA and GATA3 were highly recurrent somatic mutation genes. APOBEC-associated mutation signature was more frequent in KYBR compared with young TCGA patients. Integrative profiling was used to classify our patients into 3 subgroups based on molecular characteristics. Group A showed luminal A-like subtype and IGF1R signal dysregulation. Luminal B patients were classified into groups B and C, which showed chromosomal instability and enrichment for APOBEC3A/B deletions, respectively. Group B was characterized by 11q13 (CCND1) amplification and activation of the ubiquitin-mediated proteolysis pathway. Group C showed 17q12 (ERBB2) amplification and lower ER and progesterone receptor expression. Group C was also distinguished by immune activation and lower epithelial-mesenchyme transition (EMT) degree compared with group B. This study showed that integrative genomic profiling could classify very young patients with breast cancer into molecular subgroups that are potentially linked to different clinical characteristics.",A faster PISTOL for 1 H MR-based quantitative tissue oximetry.,https://www.ncbi.nlm.nih.gov/pubmed/30811753,NMR in biomedicine,2019 06 16,"Quantitative mapping of oxygen tension (pO2 ), noninvasively, could potentially be beneficial in cancer and stroke therapy for monitoring therapy and predicting response to certain therapies. Intracellular pO2 measurements may also prove useful in tracking the health of labeled cells and understanding the dynamics of cell therapy in vivo. Proton Imaging of Siloxanes to map Tissue Oxygenation Levels (PISTOL) is a relatively new oximetry technique that measures the T1 of administered siloxanes such as hexamethyldisiloxane (HMDSO), to map the tissue pO2 at various locations with a temporal resolution of 3.5 minutes. We have now developed a siloxane-selective Look-Locker imaging sequence equipped with an echo planar imaging (EPI) readout to accelerate PISTOL acquisitions. The new tissue oximetry sequence, referred to as PISTOL-LL, enables the mapping of HMDSO T1 , and hence tissue pO2 in under one minute. PISTOL-LL was tested and compared with PISTOL in vitro and in vivo. Both sequences were used to record dynamic changes in pO2 of the rat thigh muscle (healthy Fischer rats, n = 6), and showed similar results (P > 0.05) as the other, with each sequence reporting a significant increase in pO2 (P < 0.05) under hyperoxia compared with steady state normoxia. This study demonstrates the ability of the new sequence in rapidly and accurately mapping the pO2 changes and accelerating quantitative 1 H MR tissue oximetry by approximately 4-fold. The faster PISTOL-LL technique could enable dynamic 1 H oximetry with higher temporal resolution for assesing tissue oxygentation and tracking the health of transplanted cells labeled with siloxane-based probes. With minor modifications, this sequence can be useful for 19 F applications as well."

Females can increase their fitness by mating with males whose genes encode increased survivorship and reproductive output. Alternatively, male investment in enhanced mating success may come at the cost of reduced investment in offspring fitness. Here, we measure male mating success in a mating arena that allows for male-male, male-female and female-female interactions in Drosophila melanogaster. We then use isofemale line population measurements to correlate male mating success with sperm competitive ability, the number of offspring produced and the indirect benefits of the number of offspring produced by daughters and sons. We find that males from populations that gain more copulations do not increase female fitness through increased offspring production, nor do these males fare better in sperm competition. Instead, we find that these populations have a reduced reproductive output of sons, indicating a potential reproductive trade-off between male mating success and offspring quality.","A brief intervention to enhance breast cancer clinicians' communication about sexual health: Feasibility, acceptability, and preliminary outcomes.",https://www.ncbi.nlm.nih.gov/pubmed/30811732,Psycho-oncology,2019 04 04,"Sexual concerns are often unaddressed for breast cancer patients; one reason is inadequate clinician training.

Nanosheet materials such as graphene oxides, metal organic frameworks, and covalent organic frameworks provide unique molecular transport through nanopores and/or nanochannels that exhibit precise and fast transport. However, dimensional instability of nanosheets in harsh environments diminishes the membrane performance and hinders their long-term operation in various applications such as gas separation, water desalination and ion separation. Recent progress in nanosheet membranes has included modification by crosslinking or functionalization that improved the stability of the membranes, their separation functionality, and the scalability of membrane formation while retaining the membranes' excellent molecular transport properties. These improvements have enhanced the potential of nanosheet membranes in practical applications such as separation processes.",Optimal repetition time for free breathing myocardial arterial spin labeling.,https://www.ncbi.nlm.nih.gov/pubmed/30811728,NMR in biomedicine,2019 06 16,"The aim of this study was to improve the scan efficiency of ASL in the myocardium.

However, regulation of sox8 genes in teleosts has rarely been studied, and functional analysis of these genes in teleosts has rarely been performed. Here, two duplicates of sox8 genes were identified in Japanese flounder, Posox8a and Posox8b. The analysis of expression showed that Posox8a and Posox8b were expressed in Sertoli cells of the testis, indicating that they play important roles in development and functional maintenance of the testis. Positive selection and phylogenetic analysis found that both Posox8a and Posox8b underwent the purification selection during evolutionary and that sox8 was most likely to be the ancestor sox8a. These results suggested that both Posox8a and Posox8b had important biological functions after generation from three rounds of whole-genome duplication in Japanese flounder. The functional differentiation of Posox8a and Posox8b was verified using cell transfection and dual-luciferase reporter assays; Posox8a overexpression-promoted 3β-hydroxysteroid dehydrogenase expression and Posox8b overexpression-promoted cytochrome P450 aromatase (cyp19a1; P450arom) expression. Finally, combined with Posox8a and Posox8b expression analysis from 30 to 100 days after hatch, we speculated that Posox8a and Posox8b might participate in the process of sex differentiation and gonadogenesis by regulating sex hormone biosynthesis in the Japanese flounder. Our study is the first to demonstrate the possible mechanism of Posox8a and Posox8b in Japanese flounder sex differentiation and gonadogenesis, laying a solid foundation for functional studies of sox8 genes in teleosts.",[6]-Gingerol enhances the cisplatin sensitivity of gastric cancer cells through inhibition of proliferation and invasion via PI3K/AKT signaling pathway.,https://www.ncbi.nlm.nih.gov/pubmed/30811726,Phytotherapy research : PTR,2019 05 29,"Cisplatin-based chemotherapy is a widely used chemotherapeutic regimen for gastric cancer; however, drug resistance limits its efficacy. [6]-Gingerol has been found to exhibit anticancer effects. Here, we aim to explore the potential of [6]-gingerol in combination with cisplatin as a new regimen for gastric cancer. CCK-8 assay and colony formation assay were used to determine the effect of [6]-gingerol in combination with cisplatin on cell viability of gastric cancer cells. Flow cytometry was performed to assess cell cycle distribution. Wound-healing assay and transwell invasion assay were conducted to examine the migration and invasion abilities. Cell cycle and invasion-related proteins and mRNAs, as well as PI3K/AKT signaling proteins, were assessed by western blotting and quantitative real-time polymerase chain reaction. Combination of [6]-gingerol with cisplatin inhibited cell viability and enhanced cell cycle arrest at G1 phase compared with cisplatin alone. The combination treatment inhibited cell migration and invasion ability and decreased cyclin D1, cyclin A2, matrix metalloproteinase-9, p-PI3K, AKT, and p-AKT protein expressions and increased P21 and P27 mRNA levels. Our study demonstrates that [6]-gingerol enhances the cisplatin sensitivity of gastric cancer cells and that the mechanisms involve G1 phase arrest, migration and invasion suppression via PI3K/AKT signaling pathway."

In this study, we aimed to investigate the possible toxicity of Fe2 O 3 NPs on human cells, including blood lymphocytes. We isolated blood lymphocytes from healthy humans using Ficoll polysaccharide and subsequently by gradient centrifugation. Then, the toxicity parameters, including cell viability, reactive oxygen species (ROS) formation, lipid peroxidation, cellular glutathione (GSH) level, mitochondrial and lysosomal damage, were measured in blood lymphocytes after exposure to Fe 2 O 3 NPs. Our results indicated that Fe 2 O 3 NPs significantly (dependent on concentration) reduced the cell viability, and the IC 50 was determined to be 1 mM. With increasing concentrations, we found that Fe 2 O 3 NPs-induced cell toxicity was associated with a significant increase in intracellular ROS and loss of mitochondrial membrane potential and lysosomal membrane leakiness. Consequently, these NPs at different concentrations affect GSH level and cause oxidative stress in human lymphocytes.","Impact of intended and relative dose intensity of R-CHOP in a large, consecutive cohort of elderly diffuse large B-cell lymphoma patients treated with curative intent: no difference in cumulative incidence of relapse comparing patients by age.",https://www.ncbi.nlm.nih.gov/pubmed/30811713,Journal of internal medicine,2019 05 20,"The increasing incidence of diffuse large B-cell lymphoma (DLBCL) in ageing populations places a significant burden on healthcare systems.

This reaction involves the cleavage of a nitro group to generate an intermediate monoradical, namely, the 8-dehydro-5-iodoquinolinium cation, followed by rearrangement through abstraction of a hydrogen atom from the protonated nitrogen atom by the radical site. Dissociation of the rearranged radical cation through elimination of an iodine atom generates the 5-dehydroquinoline radical cation. The mechanism was probed by studying isomeric biradicals and performing quantum chemical calculations. The 5-dehydroquinoline radical cation showed greater gas-phase reactivity toward dimethyl disulfide, cyclohexane, and allyl iodide than the isomeric 5,8-didehydroquinolinium cation, which is more reactive than the isomeric 5,8-didehydroisoquinolinium cation studied previously. All three isomers have a 1,4-biradical topology. The order of reactivity is rationalized by the vertical electron affinities of the radical sites of these biradicals instead of their widely differing singlet-triplet splittings.",Boosting Water Dissociation Kinetics on Pt-Ni Nanowires by N-Induced Orbital Tuning.,https://www.ncbi.nlm.nih.gov/pubmed/30811711,"Advanced materials (Deerfield Beach, Fla.)",2019 04 18,"Although it is commonly believed that the water-dissociation-related Volmer process is the rate-limiting step for alkaline hydrogen evolution reaction (HER) on Pt-based catalysts, the underlying essence, particularly on the atomic scale, still remains unclear. Herein, it is revealed that the sluggish water-dissociation behavior probably stems from unfavorable orbital orientation and the kinetic issue is successfully resolved via N-induced orbital tuning. Impressively, N modified Pt-Ni nanowires deliver an ultralow overpotential of 13 mV at 10 mA cm-2 , which represents a new benchmark for alkaline HER catalysis. Fine-structural characterization and density functional theory analysis illustrate that the introduced nitrogen can uniquely modulate the electron densities around the Ni sites, and further create empty dz2 orbitals with superior orientation for water adsorption and activation. More importantly, it is demonstrated that N-induced orbital modulation can generally boost the alkaline HER activities of Pt-Co, Pt-Ni, and Pt-Cu, offering a new perspective for the design of HER catalysts and beyond.",Guests Like Gear Levers: Donor Binding to Coordinatively Unsaturated Metal Sites in MIL-101 Controls the Linker's Rotation.,https://www.ncbi.nlm.nih.gov/pubmed/30811710,"Chemistry (Weinheim an der Bergstrasse, Germany)",2019 04 05,"We present investigation of the effect of electron-donor guests on framework mobility in the metal-organic framework (MOF) MIL-101(Cr) monitored by solid state 2 H NMR spectroscopy. In a guest-free material, the mobile phenylene fragments of the terephthalate (TP) linkers populate two fractions with notably different kinetic parameters for torsional motion. Two fractions of rotational motion are indicative of non-equivalence of TP linker binding to the Cr3 O trimer, the primary building unit of the MIL-101 framework. It is established that the interaction of the guest molecules with coordinatively unsaturated metal sites (CUS) of the MOF dramatically decreases torsional barriers for the linker motions, enhancing the rotation rate. This result is opposite to a more conventional slowing down effect on the linker rotation of the guests not selectively interacting with the adsorption sites inside the framework of the MOFs. The effect of coordination on both the torsional barrier and the rotation rate depends notably on the particular guest interacting with the CUS. The found effects of the guest on the rotational motion represent a basis for developing the strategy for ruling and controlling the linker rotation in MOFs with CUS. It is shown that if water occupies CUS, another guest (tert-butanol, cyclohexanone) fails to competitively coordinate to the site.",Moderators and predictors of outcome in metacognitive and cognitive behavioural therapy for co-morbid anxiety disorders.,https://www.ncbi.nlm.nih.gov/pubmed/30811709,Clinical psychology & psychotherapy,2019 03 08,"This study aimed to investigate whether two theoretically derived moderators of treatment, degree of worry and avoidance at pretreatment, moderated anxiety from pretreatment to post-treatment in a randomized controlled trial comparing metacognitive therapy and cognitive behavioural therapy. Personality problems, degree of co-morbidity, and demographic characteristics (work status and education) were also investigated. Seventy-four patients with a primary diagnosis of post-traumatic stress disorder, social phobia, or panic disorder with and without agoraphobia were analysed using multilevel modelling. There were no significant predictors of treatment outcome, indicating that the slope was not dependent on worry, avoidance, personality problems, degree of co-morbidity, and demographic characteristics. Furthermore, no interaction with treatment condition was found. Due to the sample size, the results of the moderator analysis should be interpreted with caution and replicated. Worry, avoidance, personality problems, degree of co-morbidity, and demographic variables did not moderate the effect of metacognitive therapy and cognitive behavioural therapy or predict treatment outcome for co-morbid anxiety disorders.

Furthermore, the mechanism of proton intercalation from the ionic liquid/solid interface to whole film has not yet been revealed. Here, with a model system of inverse spinel NiCo2 O4 , an increase in system temperature during ILG forms a single but effective method to efficiently achieve protonation. Moreover, the ILG induces a novel phase transformation in NiCo2 O4 from ferrimagnetic metallic into antiferromagnetic insulating with protonation at elevated temperatures.

The challenge is the development of materials with ligands enabling coordination of metal atoms in different valence states, and preventing leaching or nanoparticle formation. Graphene functionalized with nitrile groups (cyanographene) is herein employed for the robust coordination of Cu(II) ions, which are partially reduced to Cu(I) due to graphene-induced charge transfer. Inspired by nature's selection of Cu(I) in enzymes for oxygen activation, this 2D mixed-valence SAC performs flawlessly in two O2 -mediated reactions: the oxidative coupling of amines and the oxidation of benzylic CH bonds toward high-value pharmaceutical synthons. High conversions (up to 98%), selectivities (up to 99%), and recyclability are attained with very low metal loadings in the reaction. The synergistic effect of Cu(II) and Cu(I) is the essential part in the reaction mechanism. The developed strategy opens the door to a broad portfolio of other SACs via their coordination to various functional groups of graphene, as demonstrated by successful entrapment of FeIII /FeII single atoms to carboxy-graphene.",The Importance of Detail: How Differences in Ligand Structures Determine Distinct Functional Responses in Integrin αv β3.,https://www.ncbi.nlm.nih.gov/pubmed/30811704,"Chemistry (Weinheim an der Bergstrasse, Germany)",2019 04 26,"Ligand-based control of protein functional motions can provide novel opportunities in the study of fundamental biological mechanisms and in the development of novel therapeutics.

Inhibitors of integrin αv β3 are interesting anticancer agents but their molecular mechanisms are still unclear: Peptides and peptidomimetics characterized by the Arg-Gly-Asp (RGD) or isoAsp-Gly-Arg (isoDGR) binding motifs have shown controversial agonist/antagonist effects. We have investigated the differential mechanisms of integrin activation/deactivation by three distinct ligands (cyclo-RGDf(NMe)V (Cilengitide), cyclo[DKP3-RGD], cyclo[DKP3-isoDGR]; DKP=diketopiperazine) through a comparative analysis of ligand-controlled protein internal dynamics: Although RGD facilitates the onset of dynamic states leading to activation, isoDGR induces a diffuse rigidification of the complex consistent with antagonist activities. Computational predictions have been experimentally probed by showing that the antibody AP5, which is capable of recognizing the active form of integrin, binds specifically to the RGD complexes and not to the isoDGR complex, which supports opposite functional roles of the two motifs targeting the same binding site."

This classification was based on evidence from epidemiological and experimental animal studies. The present chapter will review these epidemiological evidences. The summary risk estimates from 27 epidemiological studies obtained through a meta-analysis showed an increased risk of melanoma: summary relative risk (SRR) = 1.20 [95% confidence interval (CI) 1.08-1.34]. The risk was higher when exposure took place at younger age (SRR = 1.59; 95% CI 1.36-1.85). The risk was independent of skin sensitivity or population and a dose response was evident. A meta-analysis of 12 studies was conducted for non-melanoma skin cancers and showed a significantly increased risk for basal cell carcinoma (SRR = 1.29; 95% CI 1.08-1.53) and for squamous cell carcinoma (SRR = 1.67; 95% CI 1.29-2.17). As for melanoma, the risk for other skin cancers increased for first exposures at young age. Epidemiological studies have gradually strengthened the evidence for a causal relationship between indoor tanning and skin cancer and they fit with prior knowledge on relationship between UV exposure and skin cancer. Additionally, several case-control studies provided consistent evidence of a positive association between use of sunbed and ocular melanoma, also with greater risk for first exposures at younger age. Preventive measures based on information on risk or by requiring parental authorization for young users proved to be inefficient in several studies. The significant impact of strong actions or total ban, such as performed in Iceland, or a total ban of sunbed use, as in Brazil or Australian states, needs to be further assessed.","Who, why, where: an overview of determinants of sunbed use in Europe.",https://www.ncbi.nlm.nih.gov/pubmed/30811690,Journal of the European Academy of Dermatology and Venereology : JEADV,2019 02 27,"Although exposure to indoor tanning has been established as a clear risk factor for skin cancer, sunbeds are still commonly used in Europe. Understanding the determinants of sunbed use in Europe is key to plan educational interventions, behavioural strategies and legislative measures, which should be tailored to subgroups with different risk profiles. Evidences show that the typical sunbed users in Europe are young-adult women, with intermediate skin type, a current employment and a medium/high socio-economic status. Typical users display sun-seeking behaviours and other risky behaviours such as smoking. Indoor tanning seems more common in northern than southern Europe. However, sunbed use remains common in fair-skinned individuals and among adolescents/pre-adolescents. Commonly reported reasons for sunbed use in Europe include aesthetic motives (i.e. looking attractive), the pursue of a prevacation tan, the influence of peers/parents engaging in the same habit, and the treatment of health conditions. The most commonly reported places to get an artificial tan in Europe are tanning studios and beauty salons. However, sunbeds are also available in sport venues, such as swimming pools and gyms, hotels and private houses. All these factors should be taken into account when planning educational, behavioural and legislative interventions to reduce the popularity of artificial tanning in Europe.",Association of sunbed use with skin cancer risk factors in Europe: an investigation within the Euromelanoma skin cancer prevention campaign.,https://www.ncbi.nlm.nih.gov/pubmed/30811689,Journal of the European Academy of Dermatology and Venereology : JEADV,2019 02 27,"Sunbed use has been significantly associated with increased risk of melanoma and non-melanoma skin cancer (NMSC), but its relationship with melanoma's risk factors such as high nevus count, atypical nevi and lentigines is poorly studied.

It offers a once-a-year screening during which participants' data, including sunbed use and phenotype, are collected via questionnaires.",Sunbeds and carcinogenesis: the need for new regulations and restrictions in Europe from the Euromelanoma perspective.,https://www.ncbi.nlm.nih.gov/pubmed/30811688,Journal of the European Academy of Dermatology and Venereology : JEADV,2019 02 27,"Experimental investigations have definitely assessed that ultraviolet A (UVA) as well as ultraviolet B (UVB) radiation induce mutagenic DNA photoproducts and other cell damages with a carcinogenic potential. Artificial tanning increases significantly the lifetime risk for basal cell carcinoma, squamous cell carcinoma and melanoma particularly in subjects with fair skin type, subjects with a history of skin cancer or frequent childhood sunburn or if exposures took place at an age younger than 18 years. In addition, experimental and clinical evidence indicate that UVA exposure promotes skin photoageing. Therefore we are dealing with a recreational activity (for customers) and a profitable business (for the tanning industry) with human costs, i.e. an increase in morbidity and mortality by skin cancer, and health and social costs leading to an increased expenditure by the European national health systems. In a few European countries, legislation has recently prohibited the use of sunbeds for minors, pregnant women, people with skin cancer or a history of skin cancer and individuals who do not tan or who burn easily from sun exposure. However, this legislation seems to be insufficient from a photobiological perspective, and importantly, it is largely disregarded by consumers and tanning industry. Therefore the Euromelanoma group proposes a new, more stringent regulation for the tanning industry and restrictions for customers, particularly for those individuals with constitutional and anamnestic risk factors. Finally, we ask for an enhanced commitment to increase the awareness of the general population on the risk of artificial tanning.",High Postural Sway Is an Independent Risk Factor for Osteoporotic Fractures but Not for Mortality in Elderly Women.,https://www.ncbi.nlm.nih.gov/pubmed/30811685,Journal of bone and mineral research : the official journal of the American Society for Bone and Mineral Research,2019 05 27,"The aim of this prospective cohort study was to investigate the independent effect of postural sway on overall fracture and osteoporotic fracture risk after controlling for other established fracture risk factors. As a secondary outcome, mortality was also investigated. The study sample is a stratified random sample of 1568 women born between 1932 and 1941, residing in Kuopio province, eastern Finland. Fracture data were obtained through study questionnaires and verified through hospital records. Mortality data were verified through the National Registry. Using static posturography, postural sway was recorded for 1568 women at the fifth year of follow-up in 1994 through 1997. Mediolateral (ML), anteroposterior (AP), and total sway parameters were used for analysis. Mean follow-up time for any fractures, osteoporotic fractures, and mortality was 10.6, 11.4, and 17.5 years, respectively. After adjustment, subjects in the highest quartile of ML sway (HR, 2.0; 95% CI, 1.5 to 2.8) and total sway (HR, 1.6; 95% CI, 1.2 to 2.2) had a higher risk for any fracture. Osteoporotic fracture risk was also higher in the fourth quartile of ML sway (HR, 1.9; 95% CI, 1.1 to 3.0) and total sway (HR, 1.7; 95% CI, 1.0 to 2.8). The models were adjusted for fracture risk assessment tool risk factors and leg-extension strength. Further, women having both lowest bone density and highest postural sway were at 4.9 (95% CI, 2.6 to 9.5) times higher risk of overall fracture and 11.8 (95% CI, 2.7 to 51.3) times higher risk for osteoporotic fracture in comparison with subjects having highest bone density and lowest postural sway. The association between postural sway and mortality was not significant after adjustment. In conclusion, high postural sway is an independent risk factor for any fractures as well as for osteoporotic fractures. A combination of low bone density and high postural sway poses even higher fracture risk than either factor alone. Postural sway does not predict mortality independently. © 2019 American Society for Bone and Mineral Research.",The regulation of Neuropilin 1 expression by miR-338-3p promotes non-small cell lung cancer via changes in EGFR signaling.,https://www.ncbi.nlm.nih.gov/pubmed/30811684,Molecular carcinogenesis,2019 05 17,"Neuropilin 1 (NRP1) is a transmembrane glycoprotein that acts as a co-receptor for multiple extracellular ligands and typically performs growth-promoting functions in cancer cells. Accumulating evidence indicates that NRP1 is upregulated, and may be an independent predictor of cancer relapse and poor survival, in many cancer types, including non-small cell lung cancer (NSCLC). Recent evidence suggests that NRP1 affects tumour cell viability via the epidermal growth factor receptor (EGFR) and Erb-B2 receptor tyrosine kinase 2 (ErbB2) signalling pathways in venous endothelial cells and in multiple cancer cells. In the present study, we aimed to evaluate the role of NRP1 in NSCLC tumourigenesis and to explore a new post-transcriptional mechanism of NRP1 regulation via a microRNA that mediates EGFR signalling regulation in lung carcinogenesis. The results showed that miR-338-3p is poorly expressed and NRP1 is overexpressed in NSCLC tissues relative to their levels in adjacent noncancerous tissues. Luciferase reporter assays, quantitative real-time reverse transcription PCR, and Western blot analyses showed that NRP1 is a direct target of miR-338-3p. Overexpression of miR-338-3p in NSCLC cell lines inhibited cell proliferation in vitro and in vivo. Moreover, cell migration and invasion were inhibited by miR-338-3p overexpression. These effects occurred via the EGF signalling pathway. Our data revealed a new post-transcriptional mechanism by which miR-338-3p directly targets NRP1; this mechanism plays a role in enhancing drug sensitivity in EGFR wild-type patients with NSCLC.",Field and Current Control of the Electrical Conductivity of an Artificial 2D Honeycomb Lattice.,https://www.ncbi.nlm.nih.gov/pubmed/30811683,"Advanced materials (Deerfield Beach, Fla.)",2019 04 18,"The conductivity of a neodymium-based artificial honeycomb lattice undergoes dramatic changes upon application of magnetic fields and currents. These changes are attributed to a redistribution of magnetic charges that are formed at the vertices of the honeycomb due to the nonvanishing net flux of magnetization from adjacent magnetic elements. It is suggested that the application of a large magnetic field or a current causes a transition from a disordered state, in which magnetic charges are distributed at random, to an ordered state, in which they are regularly arranged on the sites of two interpenetrating triangular Wigner crystals. The field and current tuning of electrical properties are highly desirable functionalities for spintronics applications.

Transcriptomic and proteomic studies of the endemic Australian speckled sea anemone (Oulactis sp.) yielded homologous peptides to known defensin sequences. We extended these data using existing and custom-built hidden Markov models to extract defensin-like families from the transcriptomes of seven endemic Australian cnidarian species. Newly sequenced transcriptomes include three species of Actiniaria (true sea anemones); the speckled anemone (Oulactis sp.), Oulactis muscosa, Dofleinia cf. armata and a species of Corallimorpharia, Rhodactis sp. We analyzed these novel defensin-like sequences along with published homologues to study the evolution of their physico-chemical properties in vertebrate and invertebrate fauna. The cnidarian trans-defensins form a distinct cluster within the chemical space of the superfamily, with a unique set of motifs and biophysical properties.

In Madagascar, early detection of bubonic plague outbreaks relies on sightings of sick and dead rats. However, people most vulnerable to plague often do not perceive warning signs, and plague symptoms do not always present in rat and human bodies. In August 2015, a plague outbreak killed 10 residents of a rural hamlet in the central highlands. To reconstruct the transmission chain, scientists elicited survivors' memories of dead rats in the vicinity. Not only were these clues imperceptible to most, but residents had also constructed an alternative outbreak narrative based on different evidence. Stark health disparities, a lack of historical memory of the plague, and genetic adaptations of rats and plague bacteria have created a problem of ""semiotic cluelessness"" that complicates outbreak control measures and increases mortality.",Living Waste and the Labor of Toxic Health on American Factory Farms.,https://www.ncbi.nlm.nih.gov/pubmed/30811660,Medical anthropology quarterly,2019 04 08,"In the 1930s, erosion caused storms of dust to hurtle across the American Great Plains and Midwest. While agricultural conservation methods helped remediate this landscape, recent studies suggest the region is contending with a new type of particle cloud: desiccated fecal dust that renders the vitalities of factory farms airborne, potentially exposing those in their surrounds to various forms of illness while spreading antibiotic resistance genes. Thinking alongside these findings, and based on research within corporate hog farms, this article develops an ethnography of excrement by tracing the practices and knowledge of people who live and labor in proximity to late industrial lifeforms, such as confined pigs and resistance genes, and who are tasked with intimately shaping this unruly waste that has the potential to affect broader populations. In so doing, it analyzes the maintenance of American animals' toxic health alongside the politics of labor with complex anthropogenic materials.","Urapidil, but not dihydropyridine calcium channel inhibitors, preserves the hypoxic pulmonary vasoconstriction: an experimental study in pig arteries.",https://www.ncbi.nlm.nih.gov/pubmed/30811659,Fundamental & clinical pharmacology,2019 03 18,"Hypoxic pulmonary vasoconstriction (HPV) is a protective mechanism maintaining blood oxygenation by redirecting blood flow from poorly ventilated to well-ventilated areas in the lung. Such a beneficial effect is blunted by antihypertensive treatment with dihydropyridine calcium channel inhibitors. The aim of the present study was to evaluate the effect of urapidil, an antihypertensive agent acting as an α1 adrenergic antagonist and a partial 5-HT1A agonist, on HPV in porcine proximal and distal pulmonary artery rings, and to characterize underlying mechanisms. Rings from proximal and distal porcine pulmonary artery were suspended in organ chambers and aerated with a 95% O2 + 5% CO2 gas mixture. HPV was induced by changing the gas to a 95% N2 + 5% CO2 mixture following a low level of pre-contraction with U46619. Hypoxia induced a contractile response in both proximal and distal pulmonary artery rings. This effect is observed in the presence of a functional endothelium and is inhibited by a soluble guanylyl cyclase inhibitor (ODQ), a NO scavenger (carboxy-PTIO), and by catalase in proximal pulmonary artery rings. The endothelium-dependent HPV is prevented by nicardipine and clevidipine but remained unaffected by urapidil in both proximal and distal pulmonary artery rings. These findings indicate that urapidil, in contrast to nicardipine and clevidipine, preserves the hypoxia-triggered vasoconstriction in isolated pulmonary arteries. They further indicate the involvement of the NO-guanylyl cyclase pathway and H2 O2 in HPV. Further research is warranted to determine the potential clinical relevance of the preserved hypoxia-induced pulmonary vasoconstriction by urapidil.",Human immunodeficiency virus in cadavers: A review.,https://www.ncbi.nlm.nih.gov/pubmed/30811656,"Clinical anatomy (New York, N.Y.)",2019 04 11,"Millions of people are infected with human immunodeficiency virus (HIV); however, limited research focuses on post-mortem HIV detection. Post-mortem HIV testing is vital because medical records are not always available, and the HIV status can be unknown. The aims of this study were to review the available literature and determine the most efficient HIV test for post-mortem samples, the optimal tissue or bodily fluid to be tested, and the duration that HIV remains reliably detectable. A literature search was conducted using PubMed and Google Scholar. Terms were related to HIV (HIV detection, HIV testing, HIV prevalence) and deceased individuals (post-mortem, cadaver, deceased, organ donor). Inclusion criteria included English studies, or articles with at least an English abstract, while review articles were excluded. From this literature search, 43 studies were applicable. These studies most commonly used enzyme-linked immunosorbent assay and Western blot as screening and confirmation tests, respectively. As for the optimal tissue or bodily fluid, serum remained the golden standard, while testing skin seemed promising. HIV remains detectable in the body up to 58 days after death, although few studies tested samples after 48 h. Knowledge of the HIV status can be beneficial in the case of accidental exposure and can create a range of possible research opportunities on the effects of HIV in different organ systems. This review outlined several gaps in the current literature and future studies should investigate these gaps because this information can be relevant to numerous professions. Clin.

The X-ray irradiation with 1 Gy and 5 Gy was delivered to the whole body of rats. CPT-11 at 30 and 60 mg/kg, respectively, was intravenously infused 24 h after irradiation. CPT-11 was determined by RP-HPLC in plasma. ELISA and PCR were used to analyze the protein and mRNA expression of CES1 and CYP3A1, respectively. Compared with control rats, the X-ray irradiation decreased the AUC of CPT-11 (30 mg/kg) by 15.6% at 1 Gy and 39.0% at 5 Gy and increased the CL by 60.0% at 5 Gy. The X-ray irradiation could also decrease the AUC of CPT-11 (60 mg/kg) and increase the CL. In addition, the protein and mRNA expression of CES1 and CYP3A1 were increased significantly in rats after irradiation. This study found significant changes in the pharmacokinetics of CPT-11 in rats after exposure to X-ray irradiation, and they might be due to significant increases in the expressions of CYP3A1 and CES1.

Reconceptualizing Veterinary Palliative and End-of-life Care.,https://www.ncbi.nlm.nih.gov/pubmed/30811651,Medical anthropology quarterly,2019 04 08,"Palliative care is routinely offered to humans in the United Kingdom, while euthanasia remains illegal. The converse is true for nonhuman animals (henceforth animals). Indeed, euthanasia is widely accepted as the appropriate course of action for ""suffering"" animals, and for those whose behaviors or suspected ill health are thought to pose a threat to others. This article details examples of nonhuman death at a multi-faith ashram whose members vehemently oppose all forms of killing on religious grounds. Through exploring their efforts in palliative care for animals, and their emphasis on natural death as a means of respecting the sanctity of life, the practical, emotional, and theoretical viability of caring for, instead of killing, other animals at the ends of their lives is considered. In the process, normative distinctions between different categories of animals, (including humans), and different approaches to end of life care (palliative care, euthanasia, natural death) are called into question. Indeed, paying mindful attention to the diverse ways in which individual animals are cared for as they die reveals the potential violence inherent in both palliative care leading to natural death, and euthanasia, blurring perceptions of good and bad death in both veterinary and human medicine.",Impact of continuous electronic fetal monitoring on birth outcomes in low-risk pregnancies.,https://www.ncbi.nlm.nih.gov/pubmed/30811649,"Birth (Berkeley, Calif.)",2019 05 18,"Continuous electronic fetal monitoring (CEFM) is a standard of hospital care during the intrapartum period.

Thrombosis and macrophage infiltration are features of crescent formation in human and experimental kidney disease. Protease-activated receptor-2 (PAR-2) is a G-protein coupled receptor that links coagulation and inflammation. This study investigated whether pharmacological inhibition of PAR-2 can suppress glomerular crescent formation in rat nephrotoxic serum nephritis (NTN). Disease was induced in Wistar Kyoto rats by immunisation with sheep IgG followed by administration of sheep nephrotoxic serum. Rats (n = 8/group) received the PAR-2 antagonist (GB88, 10 mg/kg/p.o.), vehicle or no treatment starting 3 days before nephrotoxic serum injection and continuing until day 14. Vehicle and untreated rats developed thrombosis and macrophage infiltration in the glomerular tuft and Bowman's space in conjunction with prominent crescent formation. Activation of JNK signalling and proliferation in parietal epithelial cells was associated with crescent formation. GB88 treatment significantly reduced crescent formation with a substantial reduction in glomerular thrombosis, reduced macrophage infiltration in Bowman's space, and reduced activation of parietal epithelial cells. However, GB88 did not protect against the development of proteinuria, renal function impairment, inflammation or tubular cell damage in the NTN model. In conclusion, PAR-2 plays a specific role in glomerular crescent formation by promoting glomerular thrombosis, macrophage accumulation in Bowman's space and activation of parietal epithelial cells.",Inhibition of the CXCL12/CXCR4 axis prevents periurethral collagen accumulation and lower urinary tract dysfunction in vivo.,https://www.ncbi.nlm.nih.gov/pubmed/30811623,The Prostate,2019 04 17,"Several studies show that prostatic fibrosis is associated with male lower urinary tract dysfunction (LUTD). Development of fibrosis is typically attributed to signaling through the transforming growth factor β (TGF-β) pathway, but our laboratory has demonstrated that in vitro treatment of human prostatic fibroblasts with the C-X-C motif chemokine ligand 12 (CXCL12) chemokine stimulates myofibroblast phenoconversion and that CXCL12 has the capacity to activate profibrotic pathways in these cells in a TGF-β-independent manner. We have previously reported that feeding mice high-fat diet (HFD) results in obesity, type II diabetes, increased prostatic fibrosis, and urinary voiding dysfunction.

The properties of polyelectrolytes are determined not only by their chemical composition but also by their conformational states. However, the conformations of polyelectrolytes in solution are very difficult to characterize. Herein, we propose to use a protein nanopore to investigate the effect of mono- and multivalent counterions on the conformational changes of a simple polyelectrolyte, sodium poly(styrenesulfonic acid) (NaPSS). High concentration of KCl induced a conformational transition of NaPSS from ""swollen random coil"" form in low salt concentration to ""random coil"" form and was evidenced by the changes of the translocation event pattern. Addition of Mg2+ in buffer solution did not cause notable changes of NaPSS translocation events, but Dy3+ and Y3+ were shown to have remarkable effects on the translocation profile of NaPSS. Bridging events caused by Dy3+ or Y3+ between polyelectrolyte chains largely affected current blockage and dwell time of the translocation events. Our results provide experimental evidence for the classical theories of conformational transitions of polyelectrolytes and may find applications in many other polyelectrolyte-related researches.","Clinical and histological evaluation of a single high energy microwave treatment for primary axillary hyperhidrosis in Asians: A prospective, randomized, controlled, split-area comparative trial.",https://www.ncbi.nlm.nih.gov/pubmed/30811620,Lasers in surgery and medicine,2019 02 27,"Microwave treatment is an effective non-invasive treatment option for primary axillary hyperhidrosis (PAH), but the treatment parameters vary and no histopathological studies have been performed to validate clinical outcomes.

The use of long-term catheterization, where the catheter remains in place for a period >28 days remains common, and the care of these patients is often undermined by the acquisition of infections and formation of biofilms on catheter surfaces. Particular problems arise from colonization with urease-producing species such as Proteus mirabilis, which form unusual crystalline biofilms that encrust catheter surfaces and block urine flow. Encrustation and blockage often lead to a range of serious clinical complications and emergency hospital referrals in long-term catheterized patients. Here we review current understanding of bacterial biofilm formation on urethral catheters, with a focus on crystalline biofilm formation by P. mirabilis, as well as approaches that may be used to control biofilm formation on these devices. SIGNIFICANCE AND IMPACT OF THE STUDY: Urinary catheters are the most commonly used medical devices in many healthcare systems, but their use predisposes to infection and provide ideal conditions for bacterial biofilm formation. Patients managed by long-term urethral catheterization are particularly vulnerable to biofilm-related infections, with crystalline biofilm formation by urease producing species frequently leading to catheter blockage and other serious clinical complications. This review considers current knowledge regarding biofilm formation on urethral catheters, and possible strategies for their control.",Periphytic diatom colonization and litter decomposition in an intermittent stream of South India.,https://www.ncbi.nlm.nih.gov/pubmed/30811614,Journal of basic microbiology,2019 05 10,"We examined the dynamic of periphytic diatom colonization and litter decompositional pattern in an intermittent stream of South India. Litter bags containing 5 g of fresh fallen leaves (belongs to five different species of angiosperms) were fixed in the five stream pools and they were collected after 7, 14, 21, and 28 days of incubation. This experiment showed the diversity, richness, and abundance of diatoms developed on leaf litter. In total, 131 µl-1 cells of diatoms under four species in three families were collected from decomposing leaves in benthic area of stream pools. During experiment, 142 µl-1 cells representing 11 taxa in 10 families were observed in litter bags. The colonization of epiphytic diatom was rapid in early stage of litter decomposition. The higher number of colonization made by Asterionella and Stenopterobia found in litter bags of all experimental weeks. These findings suggest that the rapid microbial colonization (ephiphytic algae) was occurred in the early stage of litter decomposition in an intermittent tropical stream and a comprehensive ecological investigation in perennial natural streams in India is needed.",Age-typical changes in neural reward response are moderated by maternal anhedonia.,https://www.ncbi.nlm.nih.gov/pubmed/30811613,Psychophysiology,2019 06 14,"Reward response and mood disorders both increase during adolescence. Here, we investigate whether age and gonadal hormone levels relate to neural response to win and loss feedback in 9- to 14-year-old girls and whether such relations are moderated by maternal anhedonia, a factor linked to psychopathology risk and reward response. Psychiatrically healthy daughters of mothers who did not meet criteria for any current DSM-5 disorder or past anxiety/depression diagnosis (N = 69) completed a monetary fMRI guessing task and provided saliva samples for gonadal hormone assay. Voxelwise regressions revealed unique quadratic effects of age and linear effects of gonadal hormones; neither effect was explained by reported puberty. Striatal/insular responses to win/loss feedback peaked between 12 and 13 years, whereas estradiol predicted greater response to wins versus losses within the medial prefrontal cortex, concurrently. Maternal anhedonia specifically moderated the quadratic effect of age within dorsolateral striatum and insula. Daughters of mothers reporting greater anhedonia showed an earlier peak in striatal/insular response to reward and loss feedback. As such, maternal anhedonia predicted blunted striatal/insular response to feedback only in older daughters. A similar pattern was observed for daughters of mothers with lifetime depression in exploratory analyses. These cross-sectional findings suggest that familial anhedonia may relate to altered trajectories of reward responding during adolescence and that these effects are specific to age.",What makes a difficult patient so difficult?

What makes a patient be perceived as difficult by a therapist in public health services? Results of our analysis of 10 qualitative semistructured interviews of therapists working in public health service in Chile indicated that therapists' perceptions of a ""difficult patient"" depend on variables that go beyond the patient's intrinsic characteristics, including patients' negative attitude toward the therapist and treating team, patients' negative effects on therapists, and a difficult treatment context (e.g., work overload, scarce resources, limited number, and frequency of sessions). We illustrate the interaction of these dimensions and focus on the impact of the treating context on therapists' experience of a ""difficult patient"" through the case of a therapist working with a patient with complex depression in the public health system of Chile."

Currently, combination therapy has become the hallmark of breast cancer treatment due to the high incidence of tumor recurrence and disease progression after monotherapeutic treatments, including surgery, radiotherapy, endocrine therapy, and chemotherapy. Over the past decades, there has been considerable interest in studying the anticancer effect of bioactive phytochemicals from medicinal plants combined with these conventional therapies. The rationale for this type of therapy is to use combinations of drugs that work by different mechanisms, thereby decreasing the likelihood that cancer cells will develop resistance, and also reduce the therapeutic dose and toxicity of single treatments. Three agents have received great attention with regard to their anticancer properties: 1) piperine, a dietary phytochemical isolated from black pepper (Piper nigrum L.) and long pepper (Piper longum L.); 2) sulforaphane, an isothiocyanate mainly derived from cruciferous vegetables; and 3) thymoquinone, the active compound from black seed (Nigella sativa L.). This review focused on the combined effect of these 3 compounds on conventional cancer therapy with the objective of observing enhanced efficacy compared with single treatments. This review also highlights the importance of the nanoformulation of such bioactive phytochemicals that could enhance their bioavailability by providing an efficient targeted delivery system with a reduced systemic dose while resulting in a more efficient dosing at the target site.","Preimplantation genetic testing for aneuploidy (PGT-A): The biology, the technology and the clinical outcomes.",https://www.ncbi.nlm.nih.gov/pubmed/30811595,The Australian & New Zealand journal of obstetrics & gynaecology,2019 04 05,"Preimplantation genetic testing for aneuploidy (PGT-A) seeks to identify preimplantation embryos with a normal chromosome complement (euploid) during in vitro fertilisation (IVF). By sifting out embryos with abnormal chromosome numbers (aneuploid), PGT-A should theoretically improve pregnancy success. However, earlier versions of PGT-A were ineffective, and in some cases, detrimental, due to biopsy-induced trauma and because the technology at the time could analyse only a fraction of all chromosomes. More recently, the emergence of technologies enabling all chromosomes to be analysed and a switch to less traumatic blastocyst-stage biopsy have seen widespread uptake of PGT-A. Assessing the full impact of blastocyst biopsy PGT-A requires consideration of multiple factors, including embryonic mosaicism, sensitivity of the technological platform used, embryo loss during long-term in vitro culture, embryo cryopreservation and inter-clinic variability in expertise. Significantly, there hasnt yet been an appropriately designed randomised controlled trial (RCT) of blastocyst biopsy PGT-A analysed by intention-to-treat that accounts for all these parameters on a per-cycle basis. The three RCTs reporting benefits studied outcomes on a per-embryo transfer basis were small and underpowered and demonstrated benefits for a very select sub-group of good prognosis patients.

In order to prevent couple and parent-child relationship problems, a number of programs have been developed for couples with newborns. The current paper describes a program of research evaluating the American version of couple CARE for parents of newborns. This version of CCP was administered to low-income, unmarried couples with a new baby in an uncontrolled demonstration project (Study 1), compared with a waitlist control condition in a randomized controlled trial (Study 2), and evaluated with low-income parents recruited from urban hospitals in two major metropolitan areas of the United States (Study 3 and Study 4). Despite participant satisfaction with CCP, preventive effects of the program were limited and there was one potential iatrogenic effect. Results were likely impacted by major challenges with recruiting participants and maintaining their engagement in CCP for the duration of the program. We discuss methodological differences between this series of studies and previous trials of prevention programs and make recommendations for improving service delivery to at-risk new parents. These results have implications for public policies that aim to benefit children and families.",The Family Resilience Inventory: A Culturally Grounded Measure of Current and Family-of-Origin Protective Processes in Native American Families.,https://www.ncbi.nlm.nih.gov/pubmed/30811593,Family process,2019 06 10,"The purpose of this article is to introduce the Family Resilience Inventory (FRI) and present findings on initial efforts to validate this measure. The FRI is designed to assess family resilience in one's current family and in one's family of origin, enabling the assessment of family protective factors across these generations. The development of the FRI was the result of many years of ethnographic research with Southeastern Native American tribes; yet, we believe that this scale is applicable to families of various backgrounds. Items for the FRI were derived directly from thematic analysis of qualitative data with 436 participants, resulting in two 20-item scales. Due to missing data, eight cases were removed from the 127 participants across two tribes, resulting in an analytic sample size of 119. Conceptually, the FRI is comprised of two factors or scales measuring distinct dimensions of family resilience (i.e., resilience in one's current family and resilience in one's family of origin). The results of the confirmatory factor analysis supported the hypothesized two-factor structure (X2 (644) = 814.14, p = .03, X2 /df = 1.10, RMSEA = .03, CFI = .97, TLI = .96). Both the subscales and the total FRI scale (α = .92) demonstrated excellent reliability. The results also provided preliminary evidence of convergent and discriminant validity. This measure fills a gap in the absence of community-based, culturally grounded, and empirical measures of family resilience. The examination of family resilience, which may occur across generations, is an exciting new contribution of the FRI.",Analysis of acute myeloid leukemia incidence and geographic distribution in Canada from 1992 to 2010 reveals disease clusters in Sarnia and other industrial US border cities in Ontario.,https://www.ncbi.nlm.nih.gov/pubmed/30811592,Cancer,2019 05 09,"Several risk factors have been implicated in acute myeloid leukemia (AML) leukemogenesis.

Numerical measures of selection, constraints, and evolutionary potential are often too loosely connected to theory to provide operational predictions of the response to selection. In this paper, we study the ability of a set of operational measures of evolvability and constraint to predict short-term selection responses generated by individual-based simulations. We focus on the effects of selective constraints under which the response in one trait is impeded by stabilizing selection on other traits. The conditional evolvability is a measure of evolutionary potential explicitly developed for this situation. We show that the conditional evolvability successfully predicts rates of evolution in an equilibrium situation, and further that these equilibria are reached with characteristic times that are inversely proportional to the fitness load generated by the constraining characters. Overall, we find that evolvabilities and conditional evolvabilities bracket responses to selection, and that they together can be used to quantify evolutionary potential on time scales where the G-matrix remains relatively constant."

However, the investigation of plant allelopathic interactions in rhizosphere is difficult to perform because of its high complexity due to interactions of biotic and abiotic factors. Thus, autonomous, aseptic root cultures of apple (Malus × domestica Borkh.) could facilitate allelopathic studies. We report on the successful genetic transformation of apple cultivars Melrose, Golden Delicious, Čadel and Gloster using Agrobacterium rhizogenes (Riker et al. 1930) Conn 1942 strain 15834 and for the first time the establishment of apple autonomous and permanent in vitro hairy root cultures that could be used as a new tool for apple allelopathic assays. Molecular characterization of transgenic hairy root lines was conducted to elucidate the possible relationship between expression of T-DNA genes and root growth characteristics that include branching. Similar content of phenolic acids (chlorogenic, caffeic, syringic, p-coumaric and ferulic), glycosilated flavonoids (rutin, quercitrin, isoquercitrin, kaempferol-3-glucoside) and flavonoid aglycones (quercetin and naringenin), and dihydrochalcone phloridzin, was detected in untransformed and transgenic apple root tissue by ultra high-performance liquid chromatography with mass spectrometry (UHPLC/(+/-)HESI-MS/MS) analyses, confirming that genetic transformation did not disturb secondary metabolite production in apple. Chlorogenic and caffeic acids and dihydrochalcones phloridzin and phloretin were detected as putative allelochemicals exuded into the growth medium in which transgenic roots were maintained for 4 weeks. Apple hairy root exudates significantly affected shoot and root development and growth of test plant Arabidopsis thaliana (L.) Heynh. seedlings after 5 or 10 days of treatment. Additionally, core cell-cycle genes CDKA1;1, CDKB2;1, CYCA3;1 and CYCB2;4 were down regulated in Arabidopsis shoots suggesting, in part, their role in inhibition of shoot growth.

PD is more prevalent in men than in women, indicating the possible involvement of androgens. Androgens can have either neuroprotective or neurodamaging effects, depending on the presence of OS. Specifically, in an OS environment, androgens via a membrane-associated androgen receptor (mAR) exacerbate OS-induced damage. To investigate the role of androgens on OS signaling and neurodegeneration, the effects of testosterone and androgen receptor activation on the major OS signaling cascades, the reduced form of NAD phosphate (NADPH) oxidase (NOX)1 and NOX2 and the Gαq/inositol trisphosphate receptor (InsP3R), were examined. To create an OS environment, an immortalized neuronal cell line was exposed to H2O2 prior to cell-permeable/cell-impermeable androgens. Different inhibitors were used to examine the role of G proteins, mAR, InsP3R, and NOX1/2 on OS generation and cell viability. Both testosterone and DHT/3-O-carboxymethyloxime (DHT)-BSA increased H2O2-induced OS and cell death, indicating the involvement of an mAR. Furthermore, classical AR antagonists did not block testosterone's negative effects in an OS environment. Because there are no known antagonists specific for mARs, an AR protein degrader, ASC-J9, was used to block mAR action. ASC-J9 blocked testosterone's negative effects. To determine OS-related signaling mediated by mAR, this study examined NOX1, NOX2, Gαq. NOX1, NOX2, and the Gαq complex with mAR. Only NOX inhibition blocked testosterone-induced cell loss and OS. No effects of blocking either Gαq or G protein activation were observed on testosterone's negative effects. These results indicate that androgen-induced OS is via the mAR-NOX complex and not the mAR-Gαq complex.",Is it possible to overcome the 'long arm' of childhood socioeconomic disadvantage through upward socioeconomic mobility?,https://www.ncbi.nlm.nih.gov/pubmed/30811528,"Journal of public health (Oxford, England)",2019 03 29,Socioeconomically disadvantaged children have worse adult health; we test if this 'long arm' of childhood disadvantage can be overcome through upward socioeconomic mobility in adulthood.,N-Acetylcysteine (NAC) for the Prevention of Liver Failure in Heat Injury-Mediated Ischemic Hepatitis.,https://www.ncbi.nlm.nih.gov/pubmed/30811527,Military medicine,2019 02 27,"Exertional Heat Illness with associated ischemic hepatitis (IH) is a common occurrence among military trainees; however, few specific therapies exist if unresponsive to appropriate supportive measures. A 27-year-old basic combat trainee presented with altered mental status, renal insufficiency, rhabdomyolysis, and a core temp of 107.9 °F after collapsing during a run, leading to the diagnosis of heat stroke. While the patient's azotemia and creatinine kinase levels rapidly improved with aggressive intravenous hydration, transaminases continued to increase to nearly 155 times the upper limit of normal. Further laboratory evaluation revealed coagulopathy and thrombocytopenia suggestive of acute liver failure (ALF). On hospital day three, the patient was started on N-acetylcysteine (NAC). Evaluation for infectious and autoimmune etiologies of ALF was unremarkable; thus, the patient's symptomatology was attributed to IH resulting from heat stroke. Liver function normalized on NAC. Heat Injury is common among US Army recruits and results in thousands of hospitalizations in recent years. IH is characterized by diffuse hepatocyte necrosis following an episode of hemodynamic instability, and is an established sequela of Heat Injury. The mortality of IH among critically ill patients has been estimated to be as high as 60%, with those demonstrating coagulopathy especially at risk. NAC is shown to improve the transplant-free survival rate in non-acetaminophen related ALF, consistent with its proposed mechanisms of improving hepatic blood flow and conjugating toxic metabolites. NAC therapy should be considered early in the course of heat injury-mediated IH to reduce reperfusion injury, improving transplant free outcomes."

One of the most fascinating mutualisms is the interaction between hummingbirds and the plants they visit. We conducted an exhaustive search for articles, theses, reports, and personal communications with researchers (unpublished data) documenting hummingbird visits to flowers of nectar-rewarding plants. Based on information gathered from 4532 interactions between 292 hummingbird species and 1287 plant species, we built an interaction network between nine hummingbird clades and 100 plant families used by hummingbirds as nectar resources at a continental scale. We explored the network architecture, including phylogenetic, morphological, biogeographical, and distributional information. As expected, the network between hummingbirds and their nectar plants was heterogeneous and nested, but not modular. When we incorporated ecological and historical information in the network nodes, we found a generalization gradient in hummingbird morphology and interaction patterns. The hummingbird clades that most recently diversified in North America acted as generalist nodes and visited flowers with ornithophilous, intermediate and non-ornithophilous morphologies, connecting a high diversity of plant families. This pattern was favored by intermediate morphologies (bill, wing, and body size) and by the low niche conservatism in these clades compared to the oldest clades that diversified in South America. Our work is the first effort exploring the hummingbird-plant mutualistic network at a continental scale using hummingbird clades and plant families as nodes, offering an alternative approach to exploring the ecological and evolutionary factors that explain plant-animal interactions at a large scale.",Effect of ice slushy ingestion and cold water immersion on thermoregulatory behavior.,https://www.ncbi.nlm.nih.gov/pubmed/30811512,PloS one,2019 03 10,"Two studies were conducted to examine the effects of ice slushy ingestion (ICE) and cold water immersion (CWI) on thermoregulatory and sweat responses during constant (study 1) and self-paced (study 2) exercise. In study 1, 11 men cycled at 40-50% of peak aerobic power for 60 min (33.2 ± 0.3°C, 45.9 ± 0.5% relative humidity, RH). In study 2, 11 men cycled for 60 min at perceived exertion (RPE) equivalent to 15 (33.9 ± 0.2°C and 42.5 ± 3.9%RH). In both studies, each trial was preceded by 30 min of CWI (~22°C), ICE or no cooling (CON). Rectal temperature (Tre), skin temperature (Tsk), thermal sensation, and sweat responses were measured. In study 1, ICE decreased Tre-Tsk gradient versus CON (p = 0.005) during first 5 min of exercise, while CWI increased Tre-Tsk gradient versus CON and ICE for up to 20 min during the exercise (p<0.05). In study 2, thermal sensation was lower in CWI versus CON and ICE for up to 35-40 min during the exercise (p<0.05). ICE reduced thermal sensation versus CON during the first 20 min of exercise (p<0.05). In study 2, CWI improved mean power output (MPO) by ~8 W, compared with CON only (p = 0.024).

In the present study, we quantitatively analyzed KLK4 tumor tissue mRNA expression levels in a homogeneous cohort including 138 patients of advanced high-grade serous ovarian cancer (FIGO stage III/IV). Age as well as ascites fluid volume were found to be significantly associated with KLK4 mRNA expression levels. In univariate Cox regression analysis, the clinical factors residual tumor mass and ascites fluid volume represented univariate predictors for both overall survival (OS) and progression-free survival (PFS). Furthermore, elevated KLK4 mRNA expression levels were significantly linked with reduced OS (p = 0.001), but not with PFS. The results concerning the association of KLK4 mRNA expression with OS were validated in a publicly available Affymetrix-based mRNA data set from The Cancer Genome Atlas (n = 252) applying the Kaplan-Meier Plotter tool (p = 0.047). In multivariable analyses, elevated KLK4 mRNA values turned out as an additional, independent predictive marker for shortened OS (p = 0.006), whereas residual tumor mass, but not ascites fluid volume, remained an independent indicator for both OS and PFS (p < 0.001 and p = 0.002, respectively). The results of the present study, obtained in a well-defined, homogenous cohort of patients afflicted with advanced high-grade serous ovarian cancer, are in line with previous reports describing high KLK4 levels as an unfavorable marker in ovarian cancer patients.",Economic and public health impact of decentralized HIV viral load testing: A modelling study in Kenya.,https://www.ncbi.nlm.nih.gov/pubmed/30811510,PloS one,2019 03 10,"Kenya has the world's 4th largest HIV burden. Various strategies to control the epidemic have been implemented, including the implementation of viral load (VL) testing to monitor HIV patients on ARVs. Like many resource limited settings, Kenya's healthcare system faces serious challenges in effectively providing quality health services to its population. Increased investments to strengthen the country's capacity to diagnose, monitor and treat diseases, particularly HIV and TB, continue to be made but are still inadequate in the face of global health goals like the UNAIDS 90:90:90 which require scaling up of VL tests amid existing constraints. In Kenya, there is an increase in the demand for VL tests amidst these existing constraints. The GeneXpert system is a diagnostic point-of-care technology that can quantify, amongst others, HIV VL. Currently, GeneXpert technology is widely distributed in Kenya for testing of tuberculosis. This study aimed to determine the economic and public health impact of incorporating VL test modules on the existing GeneXpert infrastructure. Markov models were constructed for different populations (non-pregnant adults, pregnant women and children). The scenarios analysed were 100% centralized VL testing compared to 50% GeneXpert plus 50% centralized VL testing, with time horizons of 5 years for the adult and child populations, and 31 months for the pregnant population. Incremental effectiveness was measured in terms of the number of HIV transmissions or opportunistic infections avoided when implementing the GeneXpert scenario compared to a 100% centralized scenario. The model indicated that, for all three populations combined, the GeneXpert scenario resulted in 117 less HIV transmissions and 393 less opportunistic infections. The cost decreased by $21,978,755 for the non-pregnant and pregnant adults and $22,808,533 for non-pregnant adults, pregnant adults and children. The model showed that GeneXpert would cost less and be more effective in terms of total cost per HIV transmission avoided and the total cost per opportunistic infection avoided, except for the pregnant population, when considered separately.",Manual polishing of 3D printed metals produced by laser powder bed fusion reduces biofilm formation.,https://www.ncbi.nlm.nih.gov/pubmed/30811509,PloS one,2019 03 10,"Certain 3D printed metals and surface finishes may be better suited for canine patient specific orthopedic implants on the basis of minimizing potential bacterial biofilm growth. Thirty disks each of titanium alloy, stainless steel, and cobalt chromium alloy were 3D printed via laser powder bed fusion. Fifteen disks of each metal were subsequently polished. After incubation with a robust biofilm-forming methicillin-resistant Staphylococcus pseudintermedius isolate, disks were rinsed and sonicated to collect biofilm bacteria. Serial dilutions were plated on blood agar, and colony forming units were counted log (ln) transformed for analysis of variance. Interference microscopy quantified surface roughness for comparison to biofilm growth. Scanning electron microscopy on both pre- and post-sonicated disks confirmed biofilm presence and subsequent removal, and visualized surface features on cleaned disks. Significantly more bacteria grew on rough versus polished metal preparations (p < 0.0001). Titanium alloy had more bacterial biofilm growth compared to cobalt chromium alloy (p = 0.0001) and stainless steel (p < 0.0001). There were no significant growth differences between cobalt chromium alloy and stainless steel (p = 0.4737). Relationships between biofilm growth and surface roughness varied: positive with the rough preparations and negative with the smooth. Polished preparations had increased variance in surface roughness compared to rough preparations, and within disk variance predominated over between disk variance for all preparations with the exception of rough cobalt chromium alloy and rough stainless steel. Using scanning electron microscopy, bacterial biofilms tended to form in crevices. Overall, manual polishing of 3D printed surfaces significantly reduced biofilm growth, with preparation-specific relationships between surface roughness and biofilm growth. These results suggest that metallic implants produced by laser powder bed fusion should be polished. Further research will elucidate the optimal surface roughness per preparation to reduce potential biofilm formation and implant associated infection.",Prediction of difficult tracheal intubations in thyroid surgery.

Here we directly compare the accuracy of 6 analytical methods, including two fluorescent reporter assays, against the in vitro MGMT activity assay that is considered the gold standard for measuring MGMT DNA repair capacity. We discuss the relative advantages of each method. Our data indicate that two recently developed fluorescence-based assays measure MGMT activity accurately and efficiently, and could provide a functional dimension to clinical efforts to identify patients who are likely to benefit from alkylating chemotherapy.",NDRG1 facilitates the replication and persistence of Kaposi's sarcoma-associated herpesvirus by interacting with the DNA polymerase clamp PCNA.,https://www.ncbi.nlm.nih.gov/pubmed/30811506,PLoS pathogens,2019 06 10,"Kaposi's sarcoma-associated herpesvirus (KSHV) latently infects host cells and establishes lifelong persistence as an extra-chromosomal episome in the nucleus. To persist in proliferating cells, the viral genome typically replicates once per cell cycle and is distributed into daughter cells. This process involves host machinery utilized by KSHV, however the underlying mechanisms are not fully elucidated. In present study, we found that N-Myc downstream regulated gene 1 (NDRG1), a cellular gene known to be non-detectable in primary B cells and endothelial cells which are the major cell types for KSHV infection in vivo, was highly upregulated by KSHV in these cells. We further demonstrated that the high expression of NDRG1 was regulated by latency-associated nuclear antigen (LANA), the major viral latent protein which tethers the viral genome to host chromosome and plays an essential role in viral genome maintenance. Surprisingly, knockdown of NDRG1 in KSHV latently infected cells resulted in a significant decrease of viral genome copy number in these cells. Interestingly, NDRG1 can directly interact with proliferating cell nuclear antigen (PCNA), a cellular protein which functions as a DNA polymerase clamp during DNA replication. Intriguingly, we found that NDRG1 forms a complex with LANA and PCNA and serves as a scaffold protein bridging these two proteins. We further demonstrated that NDRG1 is critical for mediating LANA to recruit PCNA onto terminal repeat (TR) of KSHV genome, and facilitates viral DNA replication and episome persistence. Taken together, our findings suggest that NDRG1 plays an important role in KSHV viral genome replication, and provide new clues for understanding of KSHV persistence.",Evaluation of synthetic reticular hybrid meshes designed for intraperitoneal abdominal wall repair: Preclinical and in vitro behavior.,https://www.ncbi.nlm.nih.gov/pubmed/30811503,PloS one,2019 03 10,"Reticular hybrid meshes represent an alternative material for intraperitoneal repair of abdominal hernias.

This was the first time that an adenovirus had been identified in orange-bellied parrots and is the first report of PsAdv-2 in Australia. To investigate the status of PsAdv-2 in the captive population of orange-bellied parrots, 102 healthy birds from five breeding facilities were examined for the presence of PsAdv-2 DNA in droppings and/or cloacal swabs using a nested polymerase chain reaction assay. Additionally, eight birds released to the wild for the 2016 breeding season were similarly tested when they were recaptured prior to migration to be held in captivity for the winter. PsAdv-2 was identified in all breeding facilities as well as the birds recaptured from the wild. Prevalence of shedding ranged from 29.7 to 76.5%, demonstrating that PsAdv-2 is endemic in the captive population of orange-bellied parrots and that wild parrots may have been exposed to the virus. PsAdv-2 DNA was detected in both cloacal swabs and faeces of the orange-bellied parrots, but testing both samples from the same birds suggested that testing faeces would be more sensitive than cloacal swabs. PsAdv-2 was not found in other psittacine species housed in nearby aviaries at the Adelaide Zoo. The source of the infection in the orange-bellied parrots remains undetermined. In this study, PsAdv-2 prevalence of shedding was higher in adult birds as compared to birds less than one year old. Preliminary data also suggested a correlation between adenovirus shedding prevalence within the breeding collection and chick survival."

HCV triggers NLRP3 inflammasome activation and interleukin-1β (IL-1β) production from hepatic macrophages, or Kupffer cells, to drive the hepatic inflammatory response. Here we examined HCV activation of the NLRP3 inflammasome signaling cascade in primary human monocyte derived macrophages and THP-1 cell models of hepatic macrophages to define the HCV-specific agonist and cellular processes of inflammasome activation. We identified the HCV core protein as a virion-specific factor of inflammasome activation. The core protein was both necessary and sufficient for IL-1β production from macrophages exposed to HCV or soluble core protein alone. NLRP3 inflammasome activation by the HCV core protein required calcium mobilization linked with phospholipase-C activation. Our findings reveal a molecular basis of hepatic inflammasome activation and IL-1β release triggered by HCV core protein.",The efficacy of stress reappraisal interventions on stress responsivity: A meta-analysis and systematic review of existing evidence.,https://www.ncbi.nlm.nih.gov/pubmed/30811484,PloS one,2019 03 10,The beliefs we hold about stress play an important role in coping with stressors.

Mycobacteriophages are grouped in clusters on the basis of the overall nucleotide sequence homology, being further divided in subclusters as more mycobacteriophage genomes are sequenced and annotated. As part of our on-going screening for novel isolates, we herein report the bioinformatics analysis of CRB2, a mycobacteriophage belonging into the Siphoviridae family that propagates at 30°C. CRB2 has a 72,217 bp genome with a 69.78% GC content that belongs to Cluster B; nucleotide comparison with other B cluster members positions CRB2 as the sole member of a new subcluster, B9, being mycobacteriophage Saguaro (belonging into subcluster B7) its closest relative. Sequencing and annotation of 14 mycobacteriophages isolated by our group has yielded six cluster A members, a singleton, four of the five members of subcluster B6, one of the three reported members of subcluster G4, and CRB2 which defines subcluster B9. Considering the massive mycobacteriophage search performed in USA and the relatively rarity of our phages, we propose that factors other than size of the sampling determine the variability of mycobacteriophage distribution, and thus a world-wide concerted mining would most likely bring extremely rare and yet undiscovered mycobacteriophages.",Antiretroviral adherence and virologic suppression in partnered and unpartnered HIV-positive individuals in southern Brazil.,https://www.ncbi.nlm.nih.gov/pubmed/30811480,PloS one,2019 03 10,"An undetectable serum HIV-1 load is key to effectiveness of antiretroviral (ARV) therapy, which depends on adherence to treatment.

Role of SOCS1 and SOCS3.,https://www.ncbi.nlm.nih.gov/pubmed/30811476,PloS one,2019 03 10,"Glioblastoma multiforme (GBM) is a poor prognosis type of tumour due to its resistance to chemo and radiotherapy. SOCS1 and SOCS3 have been associated with tumour progression and response to treatments in different kinds of cancers, including GBM. In this study, cell lines of IDH-wildtype GBM from primary cultures were obtained, and the role of SOCS1 and SOCS3 in the radiotherapy response was analysed. Fifty-two brain aspirates from GBM patients were processed, and six new cell lines of IDH-wildtype GBM were established. These new cell lines were characterized according to the WHO classification of CNS tumours. SOCS1 and SOCS3 expression levels were determined, at mRNA level by Q-PCR, at protein level by immunocytochemistry, and Western blot analysis. The results showed that SOCS1 and SOCS3 are overexpressed in GBM, as compared to a non-tumoral brain RNA pool. SOCS1 and SOCS3 expression were reduced by siRNA, and it was found that SOCS3 inhibition increases radioresistance in GBM cell lines, suggesting a key role of SOCS3 in radioresistant acquisition. In addition, radioresistant clonal populations obtained by selective pressure on these cell cultures also showed a significant decrease in SOCS3 expression, while SOCS1 remained unchanged. Furthermore, the induction of SOCS3 expression, under a heterologous promoter, in a radiotherapy resistant GBM cell line increased its radiosensitivity, supporting an important implication of SOCS3 in radiotherapy resistance acquisition. Finally, the treatment with TSA in the most radioresistant established cell line produced an increase in the effect of radiotherapy, that correlated with an increase in the expression of SOCS3. These effects of TSA disappeared if the increase in the expression of SOCS3 prevented with an siRNA against SOCS3. Thus, SOCS3 signal transduction pathway (JAK/STAT) could be useful to unmask new putative targets to improve radiotherapy response in GBM.",The value of the neutrophil-lymphocyte count ratio in the diagnosis of sepsis in patients admitted to the Intensive Care Unit: A retrospective cohort study.,https://www.ncbi.nlm.nih.gov/pubmed/30811475,PloS one,2019 03 10,Early diagnosis and treatment has proven to be of utmost importance in the outcome of sepsis patients.

We investigated the immunomodulatory activities of lenvatinib in the tumor microenvironment and its mechanisms of enhanced antitumor activity when combined with a programmed cell death-1 (PD-1) blockade. Antitumor activity was examined in immunodeficient and immunocompetent mouse tumor models. Single-cell analysis, flow cytometric analysis, and immunohistochemistry were used to analyze immune cell populations and their activation. Gene co-expression network analysis and pathway analysis using RNA sequencing data were used to identify lenvatinib-driven combined activity with anti-PD-1 antibody (anti-PD-1). Lenvatinib showed potent antitumor activity in the immunocompetent tumor microenvironment compared with the immunodeficient tumor microenvironment. Antitumor activity of lenvatinib plus anti-PD-1 was greater than that of either single treatment. Flow cytometric analysis revealed that lenvatinib reduced tumor-associated macrophages (TAMs) and increased the percentage of activated CD8+ T cells secreting interferon (IFN)-γ+ and granzyme B (GzmB). Combination treatment further increased the percentage of T cells, especially CD8+ T cells, among CD45+ cells and increased IFN-γ+ and GzmB+ CD8+ T cells. Transcriptome analyses of tumors resected from treated mice showed that genes specifically regulated by the combination were significantly enriched for type-I IFN signaling. Pretreatment with lenvatinib followed by anti-PD-1 treatment induced significant antitumor activity compared with anti-PD-1 treatment alone. Our findings show that lenvatinib modulates cancer immunity in the tumor microenvironment by reducing TAMs and, when combined with PD-1 blockade, shows enhanced antitumor activity via the IFN signaling pathway. These findings provide a scientific rationale for combination therapy of lenvatinib with PD-1 blockade to improve cancer immunotherapy.",Investigation of adrenal and thyroid gland dysfunction in dogs with ultrasonographic diagnosis of gallbladder mucocele formation.,https://www.ncbi.nlm.nih.gov/pubmed/30811473,PloS one,2019 03 10,"Gallbladder mucocele formation is an emerging disease in dogs characterized by increased secretion of condensed granules of gel-forming mucin by the gallbladder epithelium and formation of an abnormally thick mucus that can culminate in obstruction of the bile duct or rupture of the gallbladder. The disease is associated with a high morbidity and mortality and its pathogenesis is unknown. Affected dogs have a significantly increased likelihood of concurrent diagnosis of hyperadrenocorticism, hypothyroidism, and hyperlipidemia. Whether these endocrinopathies represent coincidental primary disease processes that exacerbate gallbladder mucocele formation in predisposed dogs or reflect a concurrent disruption of endocrine and lipid metabolism is unclear. In this study, we investigated a hypothesis that dogs with gallbladder mucocele formation would have a high prevalence of occult and atypical abnormalities in adrenal cortical and thyroid gland function that would suggest the presence of endocrine disruption and provide deeper insight into disease pathogenesis. We performed a case-control study of dogs with and without ultrasonographic diagnosis of gallbladder mucocele formation and profiled adrenal cortical function using a quantitative mass spectrometry-based assay of serum adrenal-origin steroids before and after administration of synthetic cosyntropin. We simultaneously profiled serum thyroid hormone concentrations and evaluated iodine sufficiency by measurement of urine iodine:creatinine ratios (UICR). The studies were complemented by histological examination of archival thyroid tissue and measurements of thyroid gland organic iodine from dogs with gallbladder mucocele formation and control dogs. Dogs with gallbladder mucocele formation demonstrated an exaggerated cortisol response to adrenal stimulation with cosyntropin. A prevalence of 10% of dogs with gallbladder mucocele formation met laboratory-based criteria for suspect or definitive diagnosis of hyperadrenocorticism. A significantly greater number of dogs with gallbladder mucocele formation had basal serum dehydroepiandrosterone (DHEAS) increases compared to control dogs. A high percentage of dogs with gallbladder mucocele formation (26%) met laboratory-based criteria for diagnosis of hypothyroidism, but lacked detection of anti-thyroglobulin antibodies. Dogs with gallbladder mucocele formation had significantly higher UICRs than control dogs. Examination of thyroid tissue from an unrelated group of dogs with gallbladder mucocele formation did not demonstrate histological evidence of thyroiditis or significant differences in content of organic iodine. These findings suggest that dogs with gallbladder mucocele formation have a greater capacity for cortisol synthesis and pinpoint DHEAS elevations as a potential clue to the underlying pathogenesis of the disease. A high prevalence of thyroid dysfunction with absent evidence for autoimmune thyroiditis suggest a disrupted thyroid hormone metabolism in dogs with gallbladder mucocele formation although an influence of non-thyroidal illness cannot be excluded. High UICR in dogs with gallbladder mucocele formation is of undetermined significance, but of interest for further study."

Relative frequencies of 304 moral terms, organized into six validated sets corresponding to general morality and the five moral domains proposed by moral foundations theory, were charted for the years 1900 to 2007. Each moral language set displayed unique, often nonlinear historical trajectories. Words conveying general morality (e.g., good, bad, moral, evil), and those representing Purity-based morality, implicating sanctity and contagion, declined steeply in frequency from 1900 to around 1980, when they rebounded sharply. Ingroup-based morality, emphasizing group loyalty, rose steadily over the 20th century. Harm-based morality, focused on suffering and care, rose sharply after 1980. Authority-based morality, which emphasizes respect for hierarchy and tradition, rose to a peak around the social convulsions of the late 1960s. There were no consistent tendencies for moral language to become more individualist or less grounded in concern for social order and cohesion. These differing time series suggest that the changing moral landscape of the 20th century can be divided into five distinct periods and illuminate the re-moralization and moral polarization of the last three decades.",Clinical education alone is sufficient to increase resistance training exercise prescription.,https://www.ncbi.nlm.nih.gov/pubmed/30811460,PloS one,2019 03 10,"A large body of evidence demonstrates that resistance training has been ineffective for improving walking outcomes in adults with neurological conditions. However, evidence suggests that previous studies have not aligned resistance exercise prescription to muscle function when walking. The main aim of this study was to determine whether a training seminar for clinicians could improve knowledge of gait and align resistance exercise prescription to the biomechanics of gait and muscle function for walking. A training seminar was conducted at 12 rehabilitation facilities with 178 clinicians. Current practice, knowledge and barriers to exercise were assessed by observation and questionnaire prior to and immediately after the seminar, and at three-month follow-up. Additionally, post-seminar support and mentoring was randomly provided to half of the rehabilitation facilities using a cluster randomised controlled trial (RCT) design. The seminar led to significant improvements in clinician knowledge of the biomechanics of gait and resistance training, the amount of ballistic (t = -2.38; p = .04) and conventional (t = -2.30; p = .04) resistance training being prescribed. However, ongoing post-seminar support and mentoring was not associated with any additional benefits F(1, 9) = .05, p = .83, partial eta squared = .01. Further, improved exercise prescription occurred in the absence of any change to perceived barriers. The training seminar led to significant improvements in the time spent in ballistic and conventional resistance training. There was no further benefit obtained from the additional post-seminar support. The seminar led to improved knowledge and significantly greater time spent prescribing task-specific resistance exercises.","Benthic community succession on artificial and natural coral reefs in the northern Gulf of Aqaba, Red Sea.",https://www.ncbi.nlm.nih.gov/pubmed/30811459,PloS one,2019 03 10,"Evaluating the efficacy of artificial structures in enhancing or sustaining biodiversity on tropical coral reefs is key to assessing their role in reef conservation or management. Here, we compare spatial and temporal patterns of colonization and succession of the benthic assemblage on settlement collectors (ceramic tiles) in a 13-mo mensurative experiment on a suspended artificial reef, a seafloor artificial reef, and two nearby natural reefs at Eilat, Gulf of Aqaba. We also conducted a concurrent 7-mo manipulative experiment on the suspended reef and one of the natural reefs, and monitored fish feeding behaviour on experimental collectors, to examine effects of large mobile consumers on these patterns. In both experiments, taxonomic composition as percent planar cover for the whole community or biomass for the invertebrate component differed between collector topsides, dominated by a filamentous algal matrix, and shaded undersides with a profuse assemblage of suspension- or filter-feeding invertebrates. In the mensurative experiment, we found differences in final community and invertebrate composition between sites, which clustered according to reef type (artificial vs. natural) for collector undersides. Invertebrate biomass was greater at both artificial reefs than at one (undersides) or both (topsides) natural reefs. In the manipulative experiment, we found similar differences in composition between sites/reef types as well as between treatments (exclusion vs. control), and the invertebrate biomass was greater on the artificial reef. Invertebrate biomass was greater in the exclusion treatment than the control on collector undersides, suggesting mobile consumers can affect community composition and abundance. Predominant fish species observed interacting with collectors differed between artificial and natural reefs, likely contributing to differences in patterns of colonization and succession between sites and reef types. Our findings suggest artificial reefs have the potential to enhance cover and biomass of certain reef-associated assemblages, particularly those occupying sheltered microhabitats.",Gonadotropin regulation of ankyrin-repeat and SOCS-box protein 9 (ASB9) in ovarian follicles and identification of binding partners.,https://www.ncbi.nlm.nih.gov/pubmed/30811458,PloS one,2019 03 10,"Ankyrin-repeat and SOCS-box protein 9 (ASB9) is a member of the large SOCS-box containing proteins family and acts as the specific substrate recognition component of E3 ubiquitin ligases in the process of ubiquitination and proteasomal degradation. We previously identified ASB9 as a differentially expressed gene in granulosa cells (GC) of bovine ovulatory follicles. This study aimed to further investigate ASB9 mRNA and protein regulation, identify binding partners in GC of bovine ovulatory follicles, and study its function. GC were obtained from small follicles (SF: 2-4 mm), dominant follicles at day 5 of the estrous cycle (DF), and ovulatory follicles, 24 hours following hCG injection (OF). Analyses by RT-PCR showed a 104-fold greater expression of ASB9 in GC of OF than in DF. Steady-state levels of ASB9 in follicular walls (granulosa and theca cells) analyzed at 0, 6, 12, 18 and 24 hours after hCG injection showed a significant induction of ASB9 expression at 12 and 18 hours, reaching a maximum induction of 10.2-fold at 24 hours post-hCG as compared to 0 hour. These results were confirmed in western blot analysis showing strongest ASB9 protein amounts in OF. Yeast two-hybrid screening of OF-cDNAs library resulted in the identification of 10 potential ASB9 binding partners in GC but no interaction was found between ASB9 and creatine kinase B (CKB) in these GC. Functional studies using CRISPR-Cas9 approach revealed that ASB9 inhibition led to increased GC proliferation and modulation of target genes expression. Overall, these results support a physiologically relevant role of ASB9 in the ovulatory follicle by targeting specific proteins likely for degradation, contributing to reduced GC proliferation, and could be involved in the final GC differentiation into luteal cells.",Stereotypes about surgeon warmth and competence: The role of surgeon gender.,https://www.ncbi.nlm.nih.gov/pubmed/30811457,PloS one,2019 03 10,"Past research indicates that patient perceptions of surgeon warmth and competence influence treatment expectancies and satisfaction with treatment outcomes. Stereotypes have a powerful impact on impression formation. The present research explores stereotypes about surgeon warmth and competence and investigates the extent to which surgeon gender influences perceptions of female and male surgeons. A between-subjects experiment was conducted online using crowdsourcing technology to derive a representative sample from the general population. Four hundred and fifteen participants were randomly assigned to evaluate the warmth and competence of males, females, surgeons, male surgeons, or female surgeons, using validated measures. Planned contrasts revealed that as a group, surgeons received higher warmth and competence ratings than non-surgeons (p = .007). Consistent with gender stereotypes, female surgeons received higher warmth ratings (p < .001) and lower competence ratings (p = .001) than male surgeons. The stereotype of surgeons held by the general public is that they are high in warmth and competence relative to other occupational groups. Surgeon gender appears to influence general beliefs about the warmth and competence of female and male surgeons.",Affective responses to uncertain real-world outcomes: Sentiment change on Twitter.,https://www.ncbi.nlm.nih.gov/pubmed/30811456,PloS one,2019 03 10,"We use data from Twitter.com to study the interplay between affect and expectations about uncertain outcomes. In two studies, we obtained tweets about candidates in the 2014 US Senate elections and tweets about National Football League (NFL) teams in the 2014/2015 NFL season. We chose these events because a) their outcomes are highly uncertain and b) they attract a lot of attention and feature heavily in the communication on social media. We also obtained a priori expectations for the events from political forecasting and sport betting websites. Using this quasi-experimental design, we found that unexpected events are associated with more intense affect than expected events. Moreover, the effect of expectations is larger for outcomes that fall below expectations than outcomes that exceed expectations. Our results are consistent with fundamental principles in psychological science, such as reference-dependence in experienced affect.

Main questions include: Is the education distribution among women becoming more dispersed as their average attainment surpasses that of men? Is education variability among women higher than that of men? Does the reduction-and eventual reversal-of the gender gap in education go hand-in-hand with less educational variability overall? To answer these questions we first show how overall education variability can be decomposed into four clearly interpretable components (variability among women and men, educational advantage favoring women and favoring men). We subsequently document how these components have evolved over time in the world and its regions from 1950 to 2010 (with projections until 2040). Our findings suggest that (i) with education expansion, education variability tends to follow an inverted U-shape trajectory. (ii) The composition of education variability has been shifting dramatically over time; in particular (iii) variability among men was usually higher than variability among women until the turn of the millennium, from then onwards their educational attainment distributions have the same degree of dispersion. And (iv) while in the 1950s the educational advantage of men was by far the main contributor to education variability, nowadays the educational advantage of women has become the most important source of variability in high- and middle-income countries.","Prevalence and distribution of Human Papillomavirus (HPV) genotypes among HIV infected women in Lomé, Togo.",https://www.ncbi.nlm.nih.gov/pubmed/30811454,PloS one,2019 03 10,This study showed the diversity of circulating HPV genotypes in Togo.

Under dynamic task allocation, we hypothesized that providing volunteers with an ""I don't know"" option would contribute to enhancing data quality, by introducing further, useful information about the level of agreement among volunteers. We investigated the influence of an ""I don't know"" option on the data quality in a citizen science project that entailed classifying the image of a highly polluted canal into ""threat"" or ""no threat"" to the environment. Our results show that an ""I don't know"" option can enhance accuracy, compared to the case without the option; such an improvement mostly affects the true negative rather than the true positive rate.

Protocols published in scientific journals were searched using the MEDLINE and Embase databases; the query terms ""Systematic review"" [Title] AND ""protocol"" [Title] were searched from February 2011 to December 2017. Protocols registered at PROSPERO during the same period were obtained by web scraping all non-Cochrane records with a Python script. After excluding protocols that had a fulfillment or duplication rate of less than 90%, they were classified as published ""only in PROSPERO"", ""only in journals"", or in ""journals and PROSPERO"". Results of data and metadata extraction using text mining processes were curated by two reviewers. These Datasets and R scripts are freely available to facilitate reproducibility. We obtained 20,814 protocols of non-Cochrane SRs. While ""unique protocols"" by reviewers' institutions from 60 countries were the most frequent, a median of 6 (2-150) institutions from 130 different countries were involved in the preparation of ""collaborative protocols"". The highest Ranked countries involved in overall protocol production were the UK, the U.S., Australia, Brazil, China, Canada, the Netherlands, Germany, and Italy. Most protocols were registered only in PROSPERO. However, the number of protocols published in scientific journals (924) or in both PROSPERO and journals (807) has increased over the last three years. Syst Rev and BMJ Open published more than half of the total protocols. While the more productive countries were involved in ""unique"" and ""collaborative protocols"", less productive countries only participated in ""collaborative protocols"" that were mainly published in PROSPERO. Our results suggest that, although most countries were involved in solitary production of protocols for non-Cochrane SRs during the study period, it would be useful to develop new strategies to promote international collaborations, especially with less productive countries."

Deferasirox, licensed by the US Food and Drug Administration in 2005 based upon the results of randomized controlled trials, is now first-line therapy worldwide. In contrast, early investigator-initiated trials of deferiprone were prematurely terminated after investigators raised safety concerns.

The virus, endemic to parts of Asia and Africa, has recently undergone an emergence in other parts of the world where it was previously not found including Indian Ocean Islands, Europe, the Western Pacific and the Americas. There is no vaccine against chikungunya virus, which means that prevention and mitigation rely on personal protective measures and community level interventions including vector control.",Evaporation of droplet in mid-air: Pure and binary droplets in single-axis acoustic levitator.,https://www.ncbi.nlm.nih.gov/pubmed/30811437,PloS one,2019 03 10,"Acoustic levitation method (ALM) is a container-less processing method with applications in various fields, including material processing, biology, and analytical chemistry. Because it is a container-less processing technique, ALM could prevent nucleation and contamination of materials being processed via contact with a container wall. It is well-known that evaporation of a sample is an important process in container-less processing of materials; however, the mechanism of evaporation in multicomponent droplets in a single acoustic levitator is still unclear. Thus, we evaluate and understand the evaporation of an acoustically levitated multicomponent droplet and manipulate the evaporation process of the sample in this study. Specifically, we investigate the evaporation process of pure and multicomponent droplets using container-less processing experimentally. The evaporation processes and temporal evolution of the surface temperature of a multicomponent droplet were evaluated using a high-speed camera and radiation thermometer, respectively. We used water, ethanol, methanol, hexane, acetone, pentane, and binary solutions (solution of 25 wt%, 50 wt%, and 75 wt% ethanol, methanol, and acetone, respectively) as test samples to study the effect of saturated vapor pressure on evaporation. Ethanol, methanol, and acetone droplets evaporate in two different stages. It was observed that the water vapor in the air condensed during the evaporation process of these water-soluble droplets; hence, our experimental data did not agree with the theoretical prediction in accordance with the d2 law. Nevertheless, the evaporation behavior in the first stage of evaporation was consistent with the theoretical prediction. Furthermore, for binary droplets, as the concentration of the resultant solution increased owing to evaporation, the transition time from the first to the second stage of evaporation also increased. Based on these observations, estimation equations for binary droplets were developed to ensure that the experimental and theoretical values were in good agreement.","Emotional response in schizophrenia to the ""36 questions that lead to love"": Predicted and experienced emotions regarding a live social interaction.",https://www.ncbi.nlm.nih.gov/pubmed/30811436,PloS one,2019 03 10,"Evidence suggests that individuals with schizophrenia (SZ) report anticipatory pleasure deficits compared to controls and that these deficits are linked to decreased motivation to engage socially. However, these deficits have been identified via self-report measures of hypothetical pleasant stimuli, leaving it unclear whether they exist in reference to actual social situations. To address this issue, we created a live social interaction that minimized the reliance of higher-order cognitive processes. SZ and control participants were told that they would be playing an ""enjoyable sharing game"" with another study participant (who was actually a confederate) that involved asking and answering questions (36 interpersonal closeness generation questions; Aron et al., 1997). Participants then reported their current mood and the emotions they anticipated experiencing during the pleasant social interaction. Immediately following the interaction, they reported their experienced emotions. We found that the SZ group anticipated more negative emotion (d = 1.0), but were less accurate in forecasting negative emotion (d = .81), than controls, and these effects were large. There were small, non-significant group differences in anticipation, experience, and accuracy in forecasting of positive emotion (all ds < .29). Also, social anhedonia was positively correlated with anticipated negative affect and negatively associated with experienced positive emotion. At the same time, controls reported finding the interaction to be a more positive emotional experience overall, d = 0.75. This is the first study to show that ""anticipatory pleasure deficits"" in SZ might actually be heightened anticipated negative emotion and that inaccurate forecasting could be linked to decreased social motivation.",Multispectral imaging and unmanned aerial systems for cotton plant phenotyping.,https://www.ncbi.nlm.nih.gov/pubmed/30811435,PloS one,2019 03 10,"This paper demonstrates the application of aerial multispectral images in cotton plant phenotyping. Four phenotypic traits (plant height, canopy cover, vegetation index, and flower) were measured from multispectral images captured by a multispectral camera on an unmanned aerial system. Data were collected on eight different days from two fields. Ortho-mosaic and digital elevation models (DEM) were constructed from the raw images using the structure from motion (SfM) algorithm. A data processing pipeline was developed to calculate plant height using the ortho-mosaic and DEM. Six ground calibration targets (GCTs) were used to correct the error of the calculated plant height caused by the georeferencing error of the DEM. Plant heights were measured manually to validate the heights predicted from the imaging method. The error in estimation of the maximum height of each plot ranged from -40.4 to 13.5 cm among six datasets, all of which showed strong linear relationships with the manual measurement (R2 > 0.89). Plot canopy was separated from the soil based on the DEM and normalized differential vegetation index (NDVI). Canopy cover and mean canopy NDVI were calculated to show canopy growth over time and the correlation between the two indices was investigated. The spectral responses of the ground, leaves, cotton flower, and ground shade were analyzed and detection of cotton flowers was satisfactory using a support vector machine (SVM). This study demonstrated the potential of using aerial multispectral images for high throughput phenotyping of important cotton phenotypic traits in the field.",Detection of circulating tumor cells in drainage venous blood from colorectal cancer patients using a new filtration and cytology-based automated platform.,https://www.ncbi.nlm.nih.gov/pubmed/30811434,PloS one,2019 03 10,"Numerous technologies exist to detect circulating tumor cells (CTCs), although reports on cytological detection of CTCs remain limited. We recently developed a cytology-based CTC detection device using glass slides and light microscopy. In this study, we automated this previously manual device to improve its efficiency and cost effectiveness for clinical applications. We conducted a pilot study using this device to compare CTCs in peripheral blood (PB) and draining venous blood (DVB) from patients with colorectal cancer (CRC). The cytology-based automated CTC detection platform consisted of a disposable filtration device with a three-dimensional (3D) metal filter and multichannel automated CTC enrichment device. This platform allowed rapid and gentle filtration of CTCs and their efficient transfer from the filter to glass slides for subsequent Papanicolaou (Pap) and immunocytochemical (ICC) staining. Cytological diagnosis of CTCs was performed by observing permanent glass slide specimens by light microscopy. The current pilot clinical study enrolled CRC patients (n = 26) with stage I-IV tumors, who underwent surgery. PB was collected before surgery, and DVB was obtained from the mesenteric vein immediately after resection. Based on the CTC morphology obtained from PB and DVB samples, we proposed the following cytological criteria for the diagnosis of CTCs: pan-cytokeratin-positive, atypical cells with malignant morphological features identified by Pap staining. The numbers of CTCs defined by these criteria were significantly higher in DVB than PB from CRC patients (p<0.01), and the number of CTCs in DVB was increased significantly with stage progression (p<0.05). These results suggest that DVB may be another potential source of CTCs other than PB for liquid biopsies including downstream analysis. This automated cytology-based CTC detection device therefore provides a unique and powerful tool to investigate the significance of CTCs in CRC patients in a clinical setting.",Differential trafficking of albumin and IgG facilitated by the neonatal Fc receptor in podocytes in vitro and in vivo.,https://www.ncbi.nlm.nih.gov/pubmed/30811433,PloS one,2019 06 10,"Proteinuria is strongly associated with kidney disease progression but the mechanisms underlying podocyte handling of serum proteins such as albumin and IgG remain to be elucidated. We have previously shown that albumin and IgG are transcytosed by podocytes in vitro. In other epithelial cells, the neonatal Fc receptor (FcRn) is required to salvage albumin and IgG from the degradative pathway thereby allowing these proteins to be transcytosed or recycled. Here we directly examine the role of FcRn in albumin and IgG trafficking in podocytes by studying handling of these proteins in FcRn knockout (KO) podocytes in vitro and in a podocyte-specific FcRn knockout mice in vivo. In vitro, we find that knockout of FcRn leads to IgG accumulation in podocytes but does not alter albumin trafficking. Similarly, in vivo, podocyte-specific knockout of FcRn does not result in albumin accumulation in podocytes in vivo as measured by mean albumin fluorescence intensity whereas these mice demonstrate significant intraglomerular accumulation of IgG over time. In addition we find that podocyte-specific FcRn KO mice demonstrate mesangial expansion as they age and activation of mesangial cells as demonstrated by increased expression of α-smooth muscle actin. Taken together, these results suggest that trafficking pathways for albumin and IgG differ in podocytes and that sustained disruption of trafficking of plasma proteins alters glomerular structure.",Assessment of the load-velocity profile in the free-weight prone bench pull exercise through different velocity variables and regression models.,https://www.ncbi.nlm.nih.gov/pubmed/30811432,PloS one,2019 03 10,"This aims of this study were (I) to determine the velocity variable and regression model which best fit the load-velocity relationship during the free-weight prone bench pull exercise, (II) to compare the reliability of the velocity attained at each percentage of the one-repetition maximum (1RM) between different velocity variables and regression models, and (III) to compare the within- and between-subject variability of the velocity attained at each %1RM. Eighteen men (14 rowers and four weightlifters) performed an incremental test during the free-weight prone bench pull exercise in two different sessions. General and individual load-velocity relationships were modelled through three velocity variables (mean velocity [MV], mean propulsive velocity [MPV] and peak velocity [PV]) and two regression models (linear and second-order polynomial). The main findings revealed that (I) the general (Pearson's correlation coefficient [r] range = 0.964-0.973) and individual (median r = 0.986 for MV, 0.989 for MPV, and 0.984 for PV) load-velocity relationships were highly linear, (II) the reliability of the velocity attained at each %1RM did not meaningfully differ between the velocity variables (coefficient of variation [CV] range = 2.55-7.61% for MV, 2.84-7.72% for MPV and 3.50-6.03% for PV) neither between the regression models (CV range = 2.55-7.72% and 2.73-5.25% for the linear and polynomial regressions, respectively), and (III) the within-subject variability of the velocity attained at each %1RM was lower than the between-subject variability for the light-moderate loads. No meaningful differences between the within- and between-subject CVs were observed for the MV of the 1RM trial (6.02% vs. 6.60%; CVratio = 1.10), while the within-subject CV was lower for PV (6.36% vs. 7.56%; CVratio = 1.19). These results suggest that the individual load-MV relationship should be determined with a linear regression model to obtain the most accurate prescription of the relative load during the free-weight prone bench pull exercise.",Is infant neural sensitivity to vocal emotion associated with mother-infant relational experience?,https://www.ncbi.nlm.nih.gov/pubmed/30811431,PloS one,2019 03 10,"An early understanding of others' vocal emotions provides infants with a distinct advantage for eliciting appropriate care from caregivers and for navigating their social world. Consistent with this notion, an emerging literature suggests that a temporal cortical response to the prosody of emotional speech is observable in the first year of life. Furthermore, neural specialisation to vocal emotion in infancy may vary according to early experience. Neural sensitivity to emotional non-speech vocalisations was investigated in 29 six-month-old infants using near-infrared spectroscopy (fNIRS). Both angry and happy vocalisations evoked increased activation in the temporal cortices (relative to neutral and angry vocalisations respectively), and the strength of the angry minus neutral effect was positively associated with the degree of directiveness in the mothers' play interactions with their infant. This first fNIRS study of infant vocal emotion processing implicates bilateral temporal mechanisms similar to those found in adults and suggests that infants who experience more directive caregiving or social play may more strongly or preferentially process vocal anger by six months of age.",Use of plumage and gular pouch color to evaluate condition of oil spill rehabilitated California brown pelicans (Pelecanus occidentalis californicus) post-release.,https://www.ncbi.nlm.nih.gov/pubmed/30811430,PloS one,2019 03 10,"Sublethal effects of oil spills may dampen seabird rehabilitation success due to lingering negative impacts of contamination and stress on reproduction and long-term survival. These effects can be difficult to measure while birds are in care as well as once birds are released. Expression of sexually selected traits that are sensitive to condition can provide information on physiological status of birds. We evaluated plumage molt and gular pouch skin color of California brown pelicans (Pelecanus occidentalis californicus) following oil contamination and rehabilitation to test for differences between previously oiled and rehabilitated (post-spill) and presumably uncontaminated pelicans. Post-spill pelicans released with either color leg bands alone, or bands plus harness-mounted satellite GPS tags, were relocated and visually assessed in the field at non-breeding communal roosts and compared to surrounding unmarked pelicans in the general population. Non-oiled pelicans bearing GPS tags were also included in the study. Post-spill pelicans lagged the general population in molt of ornamental yellow crown feathers but hind neck transition into white plumage was not significantly different. Both post-spill and non-oiled pelicans wearing GPS tags had lower gular redness scores than the unmarked, non-oiled population. Pre-breeding gular pouch redness of post-spill pelicans was more strongly influenced by wearing of a GPS tag than a history of oil contamination and rehabilitation. Gular pouch redness of post-spill pelicans in the first 18 months after release was positively correlated with long term survivorship. If gular pouch color is a condition-dependent sexual signal and overall health influences plumage molt progression, our results indicate that many post-spill pelicans marked with bands alone were in relatively good condition going into the next breeding season, but those released with electronic tags experienced additional stress due to wearing the equipment, introducing a confounding variable to the post-release study."

There is interest in discovering a pharmacologic exercise mimetic that could imbue wellness and alleviate disease burden. However, the molecular physiology by which exercise signals the transcriptional response is highly complex, making it challenging to identify a single target for pharmacological mimicry. The current studies evaluated the transcriptome responses in skeletal muscle, heart, liver, and white and brown adipose to novel small molecule activators of AMPK (pan-activators for all AMPK isoforms) compared to that of exercise. A striking level of congruence between exercise and pharmacological AMPK activation was observed across the induced transcriptome of these five tissues. However, differences in acute metabolic response between exercise and pharmacologic AMPK activation were observed, notably for acute glycogen balances and related to the energy expenditure induced by exercise but not pharmacologic AMPK activation. Nevertheless, intervention with repeated daily administration of short-acting activation of AMPK was found to mitigate hyperglycemia and hyperinsulinemia in four rodent models of metabolic disease and without the cardiac glycogen accretion noted with sustained pharmacologic AMPK activation. These findings affirm that activation of AMPK is a key node governing exercise mediated transcription and is an attractive target as an exercise mimetic.","The aetiology, prevalence and morbidity of outbreaks of photosensitisation in livestock: A review.",https://www.ncbi.nlm.nih.gov/pubmed/30811417,PloS one,2019 03 10,"Photosensitisation is a clinical condition occurring in both humans and animals that causes significant injury to affected individuals.

As wheat is of paramount importance as a staple crop in the human diet, there is a growing need to study its abiotic stress adaptation through the performance of key breeding traits. New and complementary approaches, such as genome-wide association studies (GWAS) and genomic selection (GS), are used for the dissection of different agronomic traits. The present study focused on the dissection of agronomic and quality traits of interest (initial agronomic score, yield, gluten index, sedimentation index, specific weight, whole grain protein and yellow colour) assessed in a panel of 179 durum wheat lines (Triticum durum Desf.), grown under rainfed conditions in different Mediterranean environments in Southern Spain (Andalusia). The findings show a total of 37 marker-trait associations (MTAs) which affect phenotype expression for three quality traits (specific weight, gluten and sedimentation indexes). MTAs could be mapped on the A and B durum wheat subgenomes (on chromosomes 1A, 1B, 2A, 2B and 3A) through the recently available bread wheat reference assembly (IWGSC RefSeqv1). Two of the MTAs found for quality traits (gluten index and SDS) corresponded to the known Glu-B1 and Glu-A1 loci, for which candidate genes corresponding to high molecular weight glutenin subunits could be located. The GS prediction ability values obtained from the breeding materials analyzed showed promising results for traits as grain protein content, sedimentation and gluten indexes, which can be used in plant breeding programs.",Applicability of personal laser scanning in forestry inventory.,https://www.ncbi.nlm.nih.gov/pubmed/30811414,PloS one,2019 03 10,"Light Detection and Ranging (LiDAR) technology has been widely used in forestry surveys in the form of airborne laser scanning (ALS), terrestrial laser scanning (TLS), and mobile laser scanning (MLS). The acquisition of important basic tree parameters (e.g., diameter at breast height and tree position) in forest inventory did not solve the problem of low measurement efficiency or weak GNSS signal under the canopy. A personal laser scanning (PLS) device combined with SLAM technology provides an effective solution for forest inventory under complex conditions with its light weight and flexible mobility. This study proposes a new method for calculating the volume of a cylinder using point cloud data obtained by a PLS device by fitting to a polygonal cylinder to calculate the diameter of the trunk. The point cloud data of tree trunks of different thickness were modeled using different fitting methods. The rate of correct tree trunk detection was 93.3% and the total deviation of the estimations of tree diameter at breast height (DBH) was -1.26 cm. The root mean square errors (RMSEs) of the estimations of the extracted DBH and the tree position were 1.58 cm and 26 cm, respectively. The survey efficiency of the personal laser scanning (PLS) device was 30m2/min for each investigator, compared with 0.91m2/min for the field survey. The test demonstrated that the PLS device combined with the SLAM algorithm provides an efficient and convenient solution for forest inventory.","Length of stay following cesarean sections: A population based study in the Friuli Venezia Giulia region (North-Eastern Italy), 2005-2015.",https://www.ncbi.nlm.nih.gov/pubmed/30811413,PloS one,2019 03 10,"Births by cesarean section (CS) usually require longer recovery time, and as a result women remain hospitalized longer following CS than vaginal delivery (VD).

However, since such systems either do not leave tangible remains in the archaeological record, and/or are hard to date, we know little about their development and use. Clam gardens, traditional mariculture features located within the intertidal zone along the Northwest Coast of North America, are composed of a rock wall positioned at the low tide mark and a flattened terrace on the landward side of the wall. Because these features are largely composed of rock and sediment, and have complex formation histories, they can be difficult to age. On northern Quadra Island, British Columbia, we identify three variations in clam garden form, constructed in different geomorphological settings, each of which require different sampling approaches to obtain ages on construction and ongoing use. To age the clam gardens, we consider radiocarbon dating of invertebrates that inhabit beach deposits (both pre- and post-garden construction), and the relationship of the gardens and clam samples to the local sea level history and taphonomic processes. Within our study area, we find clam gardens have been in use for 3500 years, likely corresponding to other social and ecological changes of the time. These data allow us to formulate guidelines on samples most suitable to constrain the age of initial and on-going wall construction and use of clam gardens, which can be extrapolated to dating other ancient mariculture features in other regions. Such dating programs are the foundation for understanding the long-term development of traditional marine management practices and how they are situated in broader social-ecological systems.",Most UK scientists who publish extremely highly-cited papers do not secure funding from major public and charity funders: A descriptive analysis.,https://www.ncbi.nlm.nih.gov/pubmed/30811411,PloS one,2019 03 10,"The UK is one of the largest funders of health research in the world, but little is known about how health funding is spent. Our study explores whether major UK public and charitable health research funders support the research of UK-based scientists producing the most highly-cited research. To address this question, we searched for UK-based authors of peer-reviewed papers that were published between January 2006 and February 2018 and received over 1000 citations in Scopus. We explored whether these authors have held a grant from the National Institute for Health Research (NIHR), the Medical Research Council (MRC) and the Wellcome Trust and compared the results with UK-based researchers who serve currently on the boards of these bodies. From the 1,370 papers relevant to medical, biomedical, life and health sciences with more than 1000 citations in the period examined, we identified 223 individuals from a UK institution at the time of publication who were either first/last or single authors. Of those, 164 are still in UK academic institutions, while 59 are not currently in UK academia (have left the country, are retired, or work in other sectors). Of the 164 individuals, only 59 (36%; 95% CI: 29-43%) currently hold an active grant from one of the three funders. Only 79 (48%; 95% CI: 41-56%) have held an active grant from any of the three funders between 2006-2017. Conversely, 457 of the 664 board members of MRC, Wellcome Trust, and NIHR (69%; 95% CI: 65-72%) have held an active grant in the same period by any of these funders. Only 7 out of 655 board members (1.1%) were first, last or single authors of an extremely highly-cited paper. There are many reasons why the majority of the most influential UK authors do not hold a grant from the country's major public and charitable funding bodies. Nevertheless, the results are worrisome and subscribe to similar patterns shown in the US.

Typical subalpine meadows occur widely on the east of the Loess Plateau, China; here, we selected nine mountains belonging to four mountain systems from north to south on the east of the plateau. We analyzed five latitudinal and longitudinal gradients together with six elevational gradients to study the spatial distribution patterns of species diversity (including α, β, and γ diversity) and biomass plus with their relationships at various scales. Results showed that (1) for diversity, α-Diversity manifested unimodal variation patterns in horizontal spaces, peaking at high latitude and low longitude. However, α-diversity was not sensitive to elevation in vertical spaces and tended to decrease with increasing elevation. With increased latitude, longitude, and elevation, β-Diversity diminished; meanwhile, the rate of species turnover decreased and the similarity of community composition enlarged. γ-Diversity demonstrated quadratic function changes that were initially incremental and then decreased with increasing longitude, elevation, and latitude from 37.5° to 40°. In general, β-diversity had positive correlation with γ-diversity and negative correlation with α-diversity, which conformed to the function of β = γ/α. (2) For biomass, changes of aboveground biomass (AB) were more obvious along latitudinal gradients, whereas variations of belowground biomass (BB) had smaller differences along longitudinal and latitudinal gradients. More biomass was allocated to BB toward the north and east, whereas root-to-shoot ratio (R/S) was more evident at greater latitude than greater longitude. With increased elevation, more biomass was also allocated to BB, and the relationship of biomass to elevation was closer in AB. In short, the relation of biomass allocation tended to belowground plant parts with different geographical scales. (3) Species diversity had the strongest positive influence on AB. The Patrick and Shannon indices had correlations of power functions with AB and R/S, respectively, indicating that an allometric model could be used to model relationships between species diversity and biomass. In conclusion, the unique geomorphological structures with a series of basins between mountain systems on the east of the Loess Plateau, meant that subalpine meadows were mostly distributed along latitudinal directions, so the spatial distribution of species diversity and biomass was more evident along latitudinal gradients, and thus the response of aboveground biomass was more sensitive to variations of spatial gradients and species diversity."

Despite the widespread perceptions of shark attacks, trends in human water activities and shark populations are both dynamic, resulting in variable rates of shark attacks over space and time. Understanding variable trends in shark attacks may contribute to a better understanding of risk, and a more tempered response in the wake of an attack. We found that global shark attack rates are low, yet variable across global regions and over decades. Countries with low populations were found to have the highest rates of attack, while countries with high populations (U.S.A., Australia, South Africa) tended to have overall low attack rates, but also much more interannual variability. From the 1960s to the present, those countries with the highest populations also tended to be the places where attack rates have increased. Ultimately, shark attack risk is also driven by local conditions (e.g., time of day, species present); however, a global scale understanding of attack rates helps place risk into perspective and may contribute to a more scientifically-grounded discussion of sharks, and their management and conservation.",Perceived HIV-protective benefits of male circumcision: Risk compensatory behaviour among women in Malawi.,https://www.ncbi.nlm.nih.gov/pubmed/30811397,PloS one,2019 03 10,"Male circumcision (MC) reduces men's risk of contracting HIV by approximately 60% and has the potential to significantly alter HIV epidemics. However, MC does not significantly reduce the risk of HIV transmission to women from a circumcised man. In Malawi, several researchers has examined the acceptability, accessibility and sexual behaviour change after circumcision in men but behaviour change in women following their partner's circumcision remains uncertain. In order to fully realise the protective benefits of MC against HIV, factors related to risky sexual behaviour is imperative as some studies have shown potentials of increased risky behaviour in men following voluntary medical male circumcision (VMMC). This study aimed to explore the perceptions and opinions of female school teachers and health workers on HIV-protective benefits of MC and its impact on risk compensatory behaviour among women in Malawi.",Development and validation of influenza forecasting for 64 temperate and tropical countries.,https://www.ncbi.nlm.nih.gov/pubmed/30811396,PLoS computational biology,2019 04 02,"Accurate forecasts of influenza incidence can be used to inform medical and public health decision-making and response efforts. However, forecasting systems are uncommon in most countries, with a few notable exceptions. Here we use publicly available data from the World Health Organization to generate retrospective forecasts of influenza peak timing and peak intensity for 64 countries, including 18 tropical and subtropical countries. We find that accurate and well-calibrated forecasts can be generated for countries in temperate regions, with peak timing and intensity accuracy exceeding 50% at four and two weeks prior to the predicted epidemic peak, respectively. Forecasts are significantly less accurate in the tropics and subtropics for both peak timing and intensity. This work indicates that, in temperate regions around the world, forecasts can be generated with sufficient lead time to prepare for upcoming outbreak peak incidence.",Objective measurement of tummy time in infants (0-6 months): A validation study.,https://www.ncbi.nlm.nih.gov/pubmed/30811395,PloS one,2019 03 10,"The 2017 Australian and Canadian 24-hour movement guidelines recommend infants receive 30 minutes of tummy time daily. Currently, there are no validated objective measurement tools or devices to assess tummy time. The purpose of this study was to: 1) test the practicality of using devices on infants as an objective measure of tummy time, and 2) test the accuracy of developed algorithms and cut-points for predicting prone posture. Thirty-two healthy infants aged 4 to 25 weeks completed a protocol of 12 positions. Infants were placed in each position for 3 minutes while wearing a MonBaby (chest), GENEActiv (right hip) and two ActiGraphs (right hip and ankle). Direct observation was the criterion measure. The accuracy of the algorithms or cut-points to predict prone on floor, non-prone and prone supported positions were analyzed. Parents also completed a practicality questionnaire. Algorithms and cut-points to classify posture using devices from MonBaby, GENEActiv and ActiGraph (hip and ankle) were 79%, 95%, 90% and 88% accurate at defining tummy time and 100%, 98%, 100% and 96% accurate at defining non-prone positions, respectively. GENEActiv had the smallest mean difference and limits of agreement (-8.4s, limits of agreement [LoA]: -78.2 to 61.3s) for the prone on floor positions and ActiGraph Hip had the smallest mean difference and LoA for the non-prone positions (-0.2s, LoA: -1.2 to 0.9s). The majority of parents agreed all devices were practical and feasible to use with MonBaby being the preferred device. The evaluated algorithms and cut-points for GENEActiv and ActiGraph (hip) are of acceptable accuracy to objectively measure tummy time (time spent prone on floor). Accurate measurement of infant positioning practices will be important in the observation of 24-hour movement guidelines in the early years.",The importance of extracellular vesicle purification for downstream analysis: A comparison of differential centrifugation and size exclusion chromatography for helminth pathogens.,https://www.ncbi.nlm.nih.gov/pubmed/30811394,PLoS neglected tropical diseases,2019 04 02,"Robust protocols for the isolation of extracellular vesicles (EVs) from the rest of their excretory-secretory products are necessary for downstream studies and application development. The most widely used purification method of EVs for helminth pathogens is currently differential centrifugation (DC). In contrast, size exclusion chromatography (SEC) has been included in the purification pipeline for EVs from other pathogens, highlighting there is not an agreed research community 'gold standard' for EV isolation. In this case study, Fasciola hepatica from natural populations were cultured in order to collect EVs from culture media and evaluate a SEC or DC approach to pathogen helminth EV purification.",Maximum entropy and population heterogeneity in continuous cell cultures.,https://www.ncbi.nlm.nih.gov/pubmed/30811392,PLoS computational biology,2019 04 02,"Continuous cultures of mammalian cells are complex systems displaying hallmark phenomena of nonlinear dynamics, such as multi-stability, hysteresis, as well as sharp transitions between different metabolic states. In this context mathematical models may suggest control strategies to steer the system towards desired states. Although even clonal populations are known to exhibit cell-to-cell variability, most of the currently studied models assume that the population is homogeneous. To overcome this limitation, we use the maximum entropy principle to model the phenotypic distribution of cells in a chemostat as a function of the dilution rate. We consider the coupling between cell metabolism and extracellular variables describing the state of the bioreactor and take into account the impact of toxic byproduct accumulation on cell viability. We present a formal solution for the stationary state of the chemostat and show how to apply it in two examples. First, a simplified model of cell metabolism where the exact solution is tractable, and then a genome-scale metabolic network of the Chinese hamster ovary (CHO) cell line. Along the way we discuss several consequences of heterogeneity, such as: qualitative changes in the dynamical landscape of the system, increasing concentrations of byproducts that vanish in the homogeneous case, and larger population sizes.",Anti-leishmanial activity of Brevinin 2R and its Lauric acid conjugate type against L. major: In vitro mechanism of actions and in vivo treatment potentials.,https://www.ncbi.nlm.nih.gov/pubmed/30811391,PLoS neglected tropical diseases,2019 04 02,"Leishmaniasis, as a major health problem in tropical and sub-tropical areas in the world, needs novel, safe, nontoxic and plausible therapeutic solutions for its control. As a part of innate immune system, natural antimicrobial peptides have a potential to be used as new generation of antibiotics especially after persistent resistance of conventional antimicrobial agents. Brevinin 2R, a member of Defensin families of host defense peptides, showed promising effects against bacterial and fungal infections as well as cancerous cell lines. In the current research, the anti-leishmanial effect of Brevinin 2R and its lauric acid conjugate was investigated against Leishmania major (L. major) parasite. The data revealed that, conjugation of fatty acid to Brevinin 2R, strengthen its effect on L. major promastigotes as well as toxicity and hemolytic effect. These peptides showed anitleishmanial activity through cell membrane disruption and changes in the electrical and mitochondrial membrane potential. No signs of apoptosis induction or caspase activation were detected. Despite its hemolytic and cytotoxic effect in in vitro conditions, lauric acid- Brevinin 2R (L- Brevinin 2R) did not show site specific adverse reactions in animal model.

Although scientific workflow systems can powerfully organize and execute large-scale data-analysis processes, creating and maintaining such workflows usually comes with nontrivial learning curves and engineering overhead, making them cumbersome to use for everyday data exploration and prototyping. To bridge the gap between interactive analysis and workflow systems, we developed Script of Scripts (SoS), an interactive data-analysis platform and workflow system with a strong emphasis on readability, practicality, and reproducibility in daily computational research. For exploratory analysis, SoS has a multilanguage scripting format that centralizes otherwise-scattered scripts and creates dynamic reports for publication and sharing. As a workflow engine, SoS provides an intuitive syntax for creating workflows in process-oriented, outcome-oriented, and mixed styles, as well as a unified interface for executing and managing tasks on a variety of computing platforms with automatic synchronization of files among isolated file systems. As illustrated herein by real-world examples, SoS is both an interactive analysis tool and pipeline platform suitable for different stages of method development and data-analysis projects. In particular, SoS can be easily adopted in existing data analysis routines to substantially improve organization, readability, and cross-platform computation management of research projects.","Ebola virus disease-related stigma among survivors declined in Liberia over an 18-month, post-outbreak period: An observational cohort study.",https://www.ncbi.nlm.nih.gov/pubmed/30811388,PLoS neglected tropical diseases,2019 04 02,"While qualitative assessments of Ebola virus disease (EVD)-related stigma have been undertaken among survivors and the general public, quantitative tools and assessment targeting survivors have been lacking."

However, there is a relative paucity of research comparing these methods directly to one another. In this study, we compare various approaches to estimating a causal effect in a longitudinal treatment setting using both simulated data and data measured from a human immunodeficiency virus cohort. Six distinct estimators are considered: (i) an iterated conditional expectation representation, (ii) an inverse propensity weighted method, (iii) an augmented inverse propensity weighted method, (iv) a double robust iterated conditional expectation estimator, (v) a modified version of the double robust iterated conditional expectation estimator, and (vi) a targeted minimum loss-based estimator. The details of each estimator and its implementation are presented along with nuisance parameter estimation details, which include potentially pooling the observed data across all subjects regardless of treatment history and using data adaptive machine learning algorithms. Simulations are constructed over six time points, with each time point steadily increasing in positivity violations. Estimation is carried out for both the simulations and applied example using each of the six estimators under both stratified and pooled approaches of nuisance parameter estimation. Simulation results show that double robust estimators remained without meaningful bias as long as at least one of the two nuisance parameters were estimated with a correctly specified model. Under full misspecification, the bias of the double robust estimators remained better than that of the inverse propensity estimator under misspecification, but worse than the iterated conditional expectation estimator. Weighted estimators tended to show better performance than the covariate estimators. As positivity violations increased, the mean squared error and bias of all estimators considered became worse, with covariate-based double robust estimators especially susceptible. Applied analyses showed similar estimates at most time points, with the important exception of the inverse propensity estimator which deviated markedly as positivity violations increased. Given its efficiency, ability to respect the parameter space, and observed performance, we recommend the pooled and weighted targeted minimum loss-based estimator.",When Humans Met Superbugs: Strategies to Tackle Bacterial Resistances to Antibiotics.,https://www.ncbi.nlm.nih.gov/pubmed/30811343,Biomolecular concepts,2019 06 05,"Bacterial resistance to antibiotics poses enormous health and economic burdens to our society, and it is of the essence to explore old and new ways to deal with these problems.

Finally, we discuss integrated approaches that consider bacterial populations and their niches, as well as the role of global regulators that activate and/or repress the expression of multiple genes in fluctuating environments and, therefore, enable resistant bacteria to colonize new niches.

Adult,2019 03 01,"Memory difficulties are consistently reported in Major Depressive Disorder (MDD). Nonetheless, it has not been thoroughly investigated as to whether these deficits persist during remission from MDD. A group of 32 healthy young adults with no history of a mood disorder (Mage = 20.8, SD = 2.1) and 62 remitted depressed young adults (Mage = 21.1, SD = 1.9) completed a neuropsychological battery. The test battery included two measures of nonverbal memory, two measures of verbal memory, and a measure of performance validity. The testing session was repeated three to six weeks later to determine performance stability. No differences were found between healthy controls and remitted depressed patients in either memory domain (all ps > .05) and improvement in performance was exhibited over time for both groups (p = 0.004). Potential practice effects are examined. We found a stronger performance for women than men (p = 0.003), particularly for the Semantic List Learning Task (SLLT) (p = .047). Verbal and nonverbal memory and effort may not be impacted in those who are in a remitted state of MDD, early in the course of the illness. Women demonstrated auditory memory superiority over men, similar to prior research.",Complementary spatial and timing control in rhythmic arm movements.,https://www.ncbi.nlm.nih.gov/pubmed/30811263,Journal of neurophysiology,2019 04 16,"Volitional rhythmic motor behaviors such as limb cycling and locomotion exhibit spatial and timing regularity. Such rhythmic movements are executed in the presence of exogenous visual and nonvisual cues, and previous studies have shown the pivotal role that vision plays in guiding spatial and temporal regulation. However, the influence of nonvisual information conveyed through auditory or touch sensory pathways, and its effect on control, remains poorly understood. To characterize the function of nonvisual feedback in rhythmic arm control, we designed a paddle juggling task in which volunteers bounced a ball off a rigid elastic surface to a target height in virtual reality by moving a physical handle with the right hand. Feedback was delivered at two key phases of movement: visual feedback at ball peaks only and simultaneous audio and haptic feedback at ball-paddle collisions. In contrast to previous work, we limited visual feedback to the minimum required for jugglers to assess spatial accuracy, and we independently perturbed the spatial dimensions and the timing of feedback. By separately perturbing this information, we evoked dissociable effects on spatial accuracy and timing, confirming that juggling, and potentially other rhythmic tasks, involves two complementary processes with distinct dynamics: spatial error correction and feedback timing synchronization. Moreover, we show evidence that audio and haptic feedback provide sufficient information for the brain to control the timing synchronization process by acting as a metronome-like cue that triggers hand movement. NEW & NOTEWORTHY Vision contains rich information for control of rhythmic arm movements; less is known, however, about the role of nonvisual feedback (touch and sound). Using a virtual ball bouncing task allowing independent real-time manipulation of spatial location and timing of cues, we show their dissociable roles in regulating motor behavior. We confirm that visual feedback is used to correct spatial error and provide new evidence that nonvisual event cues act to reset the timing of arm movements.",Pregnancy Screening and Contraceptive Counseling in Young Women with Hodgkin Lymphoma: A Single Center Retrospective Review.,https://www.ncbi.nlm.nih.gov/pubmed/30811262,Journal of adolescent and young adult oncology,2019 06 07,"
Purpose:
 Chemotherapeutic agents used to treat Hodgkin lymphoma are teratogenic. Pregnancy screening before the start of chemotherapy is supported by clinical guidelines. There are limited data on pregnancy screening before the start of Hodgkin therapy but previous studies suggest that it is not consistently completed. The objective of this study is to evaluate the completion of pregnancy screening before the start of chemotherapy in females with Hodgkin lymphoma. 
Methods:
 A retrospective chart review was performed for all female patients, regardless of age, with newly diagnosed Hodgkin lymphoma from 2000 to 2015 at the Hospital for Sick Children. Demographic, disease, and treatment data were captured. Outcome data included completion of pregnancy testing within 2 weeks before the start of therapy and documentation of contraceptive counseling. 
Results:
 One hundred twenty-two female patients with Hodgkin lymphoma between the ages of 5 and 17 years were identified. Sixty patients (49%) had β-human chorionic gonadotropin (β-HCG) testing done before the start of therapy. Testing modalities included serum and urine qualitative and serum quantitative β-HCG tests. Older age (p < 0.01), documentation of menstrual status (p = 0.02), and diagnosis between 2008 and 2015 (p < 0.01) were associated with higher incidence of screening, although enrollment on a therapeutic trial was not (p = 0.37). Contraceptive counseling was documented for 19 patients (16%), and 11 patients (9%) were prescribed contraceptive medications. 
Conclusion:
 Prechemotherapy pregnancy screening was completed on less than half of females with Hodgkin lymphoma. The adoption of strategies to improve the consistency of pregnancy screening is required.",Lymphatic endothelial cell calcium pulses are sensitive to spatial gradients in wall shear stress.,https://www.ncbi.nlm.nih.gov/pubmed/30811261,Molecular biology of the cell,2019 05 15,"Cytosolic calcium (Ca2+) is a ubiquitous second messenger that influences numerous aspects of cellular function. In many cell types, cytosolic Ca2+ concentrations are characterized by periodic pulses, whose dynamics can influence downstream signal transduction. Here, we examine the general question of how cells use Ca2+ pulses to encode input stimuli in the context of the response of lymphatic endothelial cells (LECs) to fluid flow. Previous work shows that fluid flow regulates Ca2+ dynamics in LECs and that Ca2+-dependent signaling plays a key role in regulating lymphatic valve formation during embryonic development. However, how fluid flow might influence the Ca2+ pulse dynamics of individual LECs has remained, to our knowledge, little explored. We used live-cell imaging to characterize Ca2+ pulse dynamics in LECs exposed to fluid flow in an in vitro flow device that generates spatial gradients in wall shear stress (WSS), such as are found at sites of valve formation. We found that the frequency of Ca2+ pulses was sensitive to the magnitude of WSS, while the duration of individual Ca2+ pulses increased in the presence of spatial gradients in WSS. These observations provide an example of how cells can separately modulate Ca2+ pulse frequency and duration to encode distinct forms of information, a phenomenon that could extend to other cell types.",Vestibular modulation of muscle sympathetic nerve activity assessed over a 100-fold frequency range of sinusoidal galvanic vestibular stimulation.,https://www.ncbi.nlm.nih.gov/pubmed/30811260,Journal of neurophysiology,2019 04 23,"We have previously shown that sinusoidal galvanic vestibular stimulation (sGVS), delivered at 0.2-2.0 Hz, evokes a partial entrainment of muscle sympathetic nerve activity (MSNA). Moreover, at lower frequencies of stimulation (0.08-0.18 Hz) sGVS produces two peaks of modulation: one (primary) peak associated with the positive peak of the sinusoidal stimulus and a smaller (secondary) peak associated with the trough. Here we assessed whether sGVS delivered at 0.05 Hz causes a more marked modulation of MSNA than at higher frequencies and tested the hypothesis that the primary and secondary peaks are of identical amplitude because of the longer cycle length. MSNA was recorded via tungsten microelectrodes inserted into the left peroneal nerve in 11 seated subjects. Bipolar binaural sGVS (±2 mA, 100 cycles) was applied to the mastoid processes at 0.05, 0.5, and 5.0 Hz (500 cycles). Cross-correlation analysis revealed two bursts of modulation of MSNA for each cycle at 0.05 and 0.5 Hz but only one at 5 Hz. There was a significant inverse linear relationship between vestibular modulation (primary peak) and frequency (P < 0.0001), with the amplitudes of the peaks being highest at 0.05 Hz. Moreover, the secondary peak at this frequency was not significantly different from the primary peak. These results indicate that vestibular modulation of MSNA operates over a large range of frequencies but is greater at lower frequencies of sGVS. We conclude that the vestibular apparatus, through its influence on muscle sympathetic outflow, preferentially contributes to the control of blood pressure at low frequencies. NEW & NOTEWORTHY Vestibulosympathetic reflexes have been documented in experimental animals and humans. Here we show that sinusoidal galvanic vestibular stimulation, a means of selectively exciting vestibular afferents in humans, induces greater modulation of muscle sympathetic nerve activity when delivered at a very low frequency (0.05 Hz) than at 0.5 or 5.0 Hz.",Neural signatures of reward and sensory error feedback processing in motor learning.,https://www.ncbi.nlm.nih.gov/pubmed/30811259,Journal of neurophysiology,2019 05 01,"At least two distinct processes have been identified by which motor commands are adapted according to movement-related feedback: reward-based learning and sensory error-based learning. In sensory error-based learning, mappings between sensory targets and motor commands are recalibrated according to sensory error feedback. In reward-based learning, motor commands are associated with subjective value, such that successful actions are reinforced. We designed two tasks to isolate reward- and sensory error-based motor adaptation, and we used electroencephalography in humans to identify and dissociate the neural correlates of reward and sensory error feedback processing. We designed a visuomotor rotation task to isolate sensory error-based learning that was induced by altered visual feedback of hand position. In a reward learning task, we isolated reward-based learning induced by binary reward feedback that was decoupled from the visual target. A fronto-central event-related potential called the feedback-related negativity (FRN) was elicited specifically by binary reward feedback but not sensory error feedback. A more posterior component called the P300 was evoked by feedback in both tasks. In the visuomotor rotation task, P300 amplitude was increased by sensory error induced by perturbed visual feedback and was correlated with learning rate. In the reward learning task, P300 amplitude was increased by reward relative to nonreward and by surprise regardless of feedback valence. We propose that during motor adaptation the FRN specifically reflects a reward-based learning signal whereas the P300 reflects feedback processing that is related to adaptation more generally. NEW & NOTEWORTHY We studied the event-related potentials evoked by feedback stimuli during motor adaptation tasks that isolate reward- and sensory error-based learning mechanisms. We found that the feedback-related negativity was specifically elicited by binary reward feedback, whereas the P300 was observed in both tasks. These results reveal neural processes associated with different learning mechanisms and elucidate which classes of errors, from a computational standpoint, elicit the feedback-related negativity and P300.",Uncertainty in contextual and kinematic cues jointly modulates motor resonance in primary motor cortex.,https://www.ncbi.nlm.nih.gov/pubmed/30811258,Journal of neurophysiology,2019 04 11,"Contextual information accompanying others' actions modulates ""motor resonance"", i.e., neural activity within motor areas that is elicited by movement observation. One possibility is that we weigh and combine such information in a Bayesian manner according to their relative uncertainty. Therefore, contextual information becomes particularly useful when others' actions are difficult to discriminate. It is unclear, however, whether this uncertainty modulates the neural activity in primary motor cortex (M1) during movement observation. Here, we applied single-pulse transcranial magnetic stimulation (TMS) while subjects watched different grasping actions. We operationalized motor resonance as grip-specific modulation of corticomotor excitability measured in the index (FDI) versus the little finger abductor (ADM). We experimentally modulated either the availability of kinematic information ( experiment 1) or the reliability of contextual cues ( experiment 2). Our results indicate that even in the absence of movement kinematics, reliable contextual information is enough to trigger significant muscle-specific corticomotor excitability changes in M1, which are strongest when both kinematics and contextual information are available. These findings suggest that bottom-up mechanisms that activate motor representations as a function of the observed kinematics and top-down mechanisms that activate motor representations associated with arbitrary cues converge in M1. NEW & NOTEWORTHY Our study reveals new neurophysiological insights in support of the Bayesian account of action observation by showing that ""motor resonance"", i.e., neural activity evoked by observing others' actions, incorporates the uncertainty related to both contextual (prior beliefs) and kinematic (sensory evidence) cues. Notably, we show that muscle-specific modulation of M1 is strongest when context and movement kinematics are available, and it can be elicited even in the absence of movement kinematics.",Quantification of vibrissal mechanical properties across the rat mystacial pad.,https://www.ncbi.nlm.nih.gov/pubmed/30811257,Journal of neurophysiology,2019 05 16,"Recent work has quantified the geometric parameters of individual rat vibrissae (whiskers) and developed equations that describe how these parameters vary as a function of row and column position across the array. This characterization included a detailed quantification of whisker base diameter and arc length as well as the geometry of the whisker medulla. The present study now uses these equations for whisker geometry to quantify several properties of the whisker that govern its mechanical behavior. We first show that the average density of a whisker is lower in its proximal region than in its distal region. This density variation appears to be largely attributable to the presence of the whisker cuticle rather than the medulla. The density variation has very little effect on the center of mass of the whisker. We next show that the presence of the medulla decreases the deflection of the whisker under its own weight and also decreases its mass moment of inertia while sacrificing <1% stiffness at the whisker base compared with a solid whisker. Finally, we quantify two dimensionless parameters across the array. First, the deflection-to-length ratio decreases from caudal to rostral: caudal whiskers are longer but deflect more under their own weight. Second, the nondimensionalized radius of gyration is approximately constant across the array, which may simplify control of whisking by the intrinsic muscles. We anticipate that future work will exploit the mechanical properties computed in the present study to improve simulations of the mechanosensory signals associated with vibrissotactile exploratory behavior. NEW & NOTEWORTHY The mechanical signals transmitted by a whisker depend critically on its geometry. We used measurements of whisker geometry and mass to quantify the center of mass, mass moment of inertia, radius of gyration, and deflection under gravity of the whisker. We describe how variations in these quantities across the array could enhance sensing behaviors while reducing energy costs and simplifying whisking control. Most importantly, we provide derivations for these quantities for use in future simulation work.",Diabetes Mellitus-Associated Uveitis: Clinical Features in a Chilean Series.,https://www.ncbi.nlm.nih.gov/pubmed/30811256,Ocular immunology and inflammation,2019 02 27,To describe clinical features of patients with diabetes mellitus-associated uveitis (DMAU).

The outbreak affected two respiratory wards and the initial outbreak lasted 9 months, with the first patient (index case) being identified in April 2015 and the final, tenth case, in September 2015. The outbreak was declared closed in January 2016, but a further two cases were identified in July and August 2016. Of the 12 identified patients, eight were colonised with the bacterium and four were infected. The four infections were of the respiratory tract with MDR-Ab, of identical variable number tandem repeat, isolated from sputum in all cases. All 12 patients were decolonised and this continued throughout the outbreak. Some negative rescreening results were achieved. At the time of the outbreak, decolonisation using octenidine had not been reported in any guidelines. The sensitivity of MDR-Ab to octenidine was microbiologically tested and antibacterial action of octenidine against this organism was demonstrated.

Several studies have reported disturbed centrally controlled rhythms, but little is known on shift workers' peripheral clocks. Here, we assessed central clock markers, urinary 6-sulfatoxymelatonin and salivary cortisol, and clock gene expression in 2 peripheral clocks, oral mucosa cells and peripheral blood mononuclear cells (PBMCs), in 11 police officers. Before working 7 consecutive nights, officers' centrally controlled rhythms were aligned to a day-oriented schedule. These rhythms were partially realigned to the shifted schedule and dampened after a week working nights. For peripheral clocks at baseline, Period (PER)1-3 and nuclear receptor subfamily 1, group D, member 1 (REV-ERBα) in oral mucosa cells had a significant mRNA peak in the afternoon, whereas in PBMCs, higher PER1-3 expression was observed at 10:00 compared with 19:30. After a week working nights, PER1-3 and REV-ERBα expression in oral mucosa cells lost rhythmicity, and in PBMCs, the morning/evening difference observed at baseline was lost.

B,2019 03 21,"Structural characterization of amyloid (A)β peptides implicated in Alzheimer's disease is a challenging problem due to their intrinsically disordered nature and their high propensity for aggregation. Only limited information is currently available from experiments on conformational properties and aggregation pathways of the peptides in cellular environments. In silico modeling complements experimental information, providing atomistic insight into structure and dynamics of different Aβ species. All-atom explicit solvent molecular dynamics (MD) simulations with a properly selected force field can deliver reliable structural and dynamic information. In the case of intrinsically disordered Aβ peptides, enhanced sampling simulations beyond the nanosecond time scale are required to obtain statistically meaningful results even for simple solvent conditions. To overcome the challenges of conformational sampling in crowded cellular environments, alternative approaches have to be used, including postprocessing of MD data. In this study, we employ the statistical-mechanical, three-dimensional reference interaction site model with the Kovalenko-Hirata closure integral equation molecular theory of solvation to describe solvent composition effects on the conformational equilibrium in a structural ensemble of the Aβ42 (covering residues 1-42) monomer based on a statistical reweighting technique. The methodology enables a computationally efficient prediction on how different factors in the cellular environment, such as solvent composition, nonpolar solvation, and macromolecular crowding, affect the structural properties of the monomer. Similarities have been identified between changes in the structural ensemble caused by nonpolar solvation and crowded environments modeled by ionic solution with large negative ions. In particular, both solvent conditions reduce the random coil content and enhance the helical structure content of the monomer. In contrast to the previous studies, which reported increased α-helical content of peptides in crowded environments, this work attributes these structural features to the difference in solvent exposure of hydrophilic residues of the monomer for different secondary structure elements, rather than to (entropic) excluded volume effects.",Interaction of Anionic Bulk Nanobubbles with Cationic Liposomes: Evidence for Reentrant Condensation.,https://www.ncbi.nlm.nih.gov/pubmed/30811209,Langmuir : the ACS journal of surfaces and colloids,2019 03 29,"We investigated the interaction of bulk nanobubbles with cationic liposomes composed of 1,2-dioleoyl- sn-glycero-3-ethylphosphocholine and anionic liposomes assembled from 1-palmitoyl-2-oleoyl- sn-glycero-3-phospho-(1'- rac-glycerol).

Here, we use two-dimensional electronic spectroscopy to resonantly probe the interplay between near-band-edge transitions during the buildup of optical gain in CsPbBr3 NCs. We find compelling evidence to conclude that optical gain in CsPbBr3 NCs is generated through stimulated emission from strongly interacting biexcitons. The threshold is largely determined by the competition between stimulated emission from biexcitons and excited-state absorption from single exciton to biexciton states. The findings in this work may guide future explorations of NC materials with low-threshold optical gain.",Oral Delivery of Puerarin Nanocrystals To Improve Brain Accumulation and Anti-Parkinsonian Efficacy.,https://www.ncbi.nlm.nih.gov/pubmed/30811206,Molecular pharmaceutics,2019 04 01,"Puerarin (PU) has emerged as a promising herb-derived anti-Parkinsonism compound. However, the undesirable water solubility as well as the unwanted bioavailability of PU limit its application. Therefore, this study aimed to develop and characterize PU nanocrystals (PU-NCs) with enhanced oral bioavailability and improved brain accumulation for the treatment of Parkinson's disease (PD). The fabricated PU-NCs were approximately spherical, with a mean size of 83.05 ± 1.96 nm, a PDI of 0.047 ± 0.009, a drug loading of 72.7%, and a rapid dissolution rate in vitro. Molecular dynamics simulation of PU and Pluronic F68 demonstrated the interaction energy and binding energy of -88.1 kJ/mol and -40.201 ± 0.685 kJ/mol, respectively, indicating a spontaneous binding with van der Waals interactions. In addition, the cellular uptake and permeability of PU-NCs were significantly enhanced as compared to PU alone ( p < 0.01). Moreover, PU-NCs exerted a significant neuroprotective effect against the cellular damage induced by the 1-methyl-4-phenylpyridinium ion (MPP+). Besides, PU-NCs demonstrated no obvious toxic effects on zebrafish, as evidenced by the unaltered morphology, hatching, survival rate, body length, and heart rate. Fluorescence resonance energy transfer (FRET) imaging revealed that intact nanocrystals were found in the intestine and brain of adult zebrafish gavaged with DiO/DiI/PU-NCs. Increased values of Cmax and AUC0- t were observed in the plasma of rats following oral administration of PU-NCs compared to PU suspension. Likewise, brain accumulation of PU-NCs was higher than that of PU suspension. Furthermore, PU-NCs attenuated dopamine depletion, ameliorated 1-methyl-4-phenyl-1,2,3,6-tetrahydropyridine (MPTP)-induced behavioral deficits, and enhanced the levels of dopamine and its metabolites. Taken altogether, this study provides evidence that PU-NCs could be exploited as a potential oral delivery system to treat PD, by improving the poor bioavailability of PU and enhancing their delivery into the brain.",Microstructure Formation for Improved Dissolution Performance of Lopinavir Amorphous Solid Dispersions.,https://www.ncbi.nlm.nih.gov/pubmed/30811205,Molecular pharmaceutics,2019 04 01,"Amorphous solid dispersions (ASDs), where the drug is dispersed in a polymer, have become increasingly prevalent as a formulation strategy for the oral delivery of poorly soluble drugs due to their potential for substantial solubility enhancement. However, ASDs are susceptible to amorphous-amorphous phase separation, which may promote crystallization and/or alter the release performance. Nevertheless, the mechanisms by which phase separation and subtle microstructural changes affect ASD release remain poorly understood. Therefore, understanding the microstructure of ASDs and the subsequent implication for ASD performance are critical to design an optimally performing formulation. In this study, comprehensive investigations of microstructure evolution in lopinavir ASDs, prepared using a solvent-based process, were undertaken. Atomic force microscopy (AFM)-based nanoscale thermal analysis (nanoTA) enabled characterization of local composition at the submicron scale. The formation of heterogeneous domains was found to improve the in vitro release of lopinavir from lopinavir-hydroxypropylmethylcellulose (HPMC) ASDs for drug loadings above 33% w/w. The composition and amount of each phase formed, as well as the size and location of drug-rich phases, were found to be critical factors contributing to the altered release kinetics observed. This study highlights the complexity and importance of ASD microstructure and should contribute to a broader understanding of ASD release mechanisms.",Assessing the Binding Performance of Amyloid-Carbon Membranes toward Heavy Metal Ions.,https://www.ncbi.nlm.nih.gov/pubmed/30811203,Langmuir : the ACS journal of surfaces and colloids,2019 03 19,"Amyloid-carbon hybrid membranes have exceptional performance in removing heavy metal ions from water because of the presence of multiple binding sites on the amyloid fibrils, but the binding process is still not fully understood. To understand the mechanisms of amyloid-metal ion binding, we perform adsorption isotherms on a model system given by β-lactoglobulin amyloid fibrils and four representative heavy metal ions: chromium (Cr), nickel (Ni), silver (Ag), and platinum (Pt). Furthermore, to get a comprehensive thermodynamic picture of the binding process between amino acid residues and heavy metals, we here use isothermal titration calorimetry on native β-lactoglobulin monomers and amyloid fibrils exposed to the two model metal ions, that is, silver and chromium. A conclusive thermodynamic insight on the binding process emerges by direct measurements of enthalpy and entropy changes, association binding constant, and average number of binding sites of the protein monomer and amyloid fibril. As a result of the strong amyloid binding affinity between amino acids and metal ions, when the protein is converted into amyloid fibrils and assembled into membranes, the resulting amyloid-activated carbon hybrids remove all the tested heavy metals with efficiencies beyond 99%. Importantly, the efficiency remains stable during several consecutive cycles, demonstrating a high adsorption capacity and a long lifetime and reusability of the membranes. The recovery of adsorbed precious metal ions converted into elemental metals is shown to be a general feature of these membranes, with platinum and silver successfully recovered from saturated hybrid membranes by a simple thermal reduction. The separation performance, evaluated on real electroplating industrial wastewater containing chromium and nickel, is found to exceed 99% at a permeability as high as 2.92 × 10-16 m2, that is, at least 4 orders of magnitude higher than typical nanofiltration membranes, conclusively validating the technology under stringent real conditions.",Magic Numbers for the Photoelectron Anisotropy in Li-Doped Dimethyl Ether Clusters.,https://www.ncbi.nlm.nih.gov/pubmed/30811202,The journal of physical chemistry. A,2019 04 03,"Photoelectron velocity map imaging of Li(CH3OCH3) n clusters (1 ≤ n ≤ 175) is used to search for magic numbers related to the photoelectron anisotropy. Comparison with density functional calculations reveals magic numbers at n = 4, 5, and 6, resulting from the symmetric charge distribution with high s-character of the highest occupied molecular orbital. Since each of these three cluster sizes correspond to the completion of a first coordination shell, they can be considered as ""isomeric motifs of the first coordination shell"". Differences in the photoelectron anisotropy, the vertical ionization energies and the enthalpies of vaporization between Li(CH3OCH3) n and Na(CH3OCH3) n can be rationalized in terms of differences in their solvation shells, atomic ionization energies, polarizabilities, metal-oxygen bonds, ligand-ligand interactions and by cooperative effects."

The methodology requires minimal preparation of wine samples: the addition of internal standards and 6 g/L sulfur dioxide, and filtration prior to quantitation by liquid chromatography-triple quadrupole-mass spectrometery. Overall, the limit of detection, limit of quantification, accuracy (recovery, 97-114%), and precision (repeatability and reproducibility, RSD ≤ 10%) were satisfactory to enable routine measurement of the 12 aldehyde compounds in wine. The methodology was applied to 20 commercial white and red wines from various varieties and vintages. A general trend of higher concentrations of the aldehyde compounds in white wines compared to red wines was observed.",Automated Multiscale Approach To Predict Self-Diffusion from a Potential Energy Field.,https://www.ncbi.nlm.nih.gov/pubmed/30811190,Journal of chemical theory and computation,2019 04 16,"For large-scale screening studies there is a need to estimate the diffusion of gas molecules in nanoporous materials more efficiently than (brute force) molecular dynamics. In particular for systems with low diffusion coefficients molecular dynamics can be prohibitively expensive. An alternative is to compute the hopping rates between adsorption sites using transition state theory. For large-scale screening this requires the automatic detection of the transition states between the adsorption sites along the different diffusion paths. Here an algorithm is presented that analyzes energy grids for the moving particles. It detects the energies at which diffusion paths are formed, together with their directions. This allows for easy identification of nondiffusive systems. For diffusive systems, it partitions the grid coordinates assigned to energy basins and transitions states, permitting a transition state theory based analysis of the diffusion. We test our method on CH4 diffusion in zeolites, using a standard kinetic Monte Carlo simulation based on the output of our grid analysis. We find that it is accurate, fast, and rigorous without limitations to the geometries of the diffusion tunnels or transition states.",Discovery of Hydroxylase Activity for PqqB Provides a Missing Link in the Pyrroloquinoline Quinone Biosynthetic Pathway.,https://www.ncbi.nlm.nih.gov/pubmed/30811189,Journal of the American Chemical Society,2019 03 13,"Understanding the biosynthesis of cofactors is fundamental to the life sciences, yet to date a few important pathways remain unresolved. One example is the redox cofactor pyrroloquinoline quinone (PQQ), which is critical for C1 metabolism in many microorganisms, a disproportionate number of which are opportunistic human pathogens. While the initial and final steps of PQQ biosynthesis, involving PqqD/E and PqqC, have been elucidated, the precise nature and order of the remaining transformations in the pathway are unknown. Here we show evidence that the remaining essential biosynthetic enzyme PqqB is an iron-dependent hydroxylase catalyzing oxygen-insertion reactions that are proposed to produce the quinone moiety of the mature PQQ cofactor. The demonstrated reactions of PqqB are unprecedented within the metallo β-lactamase protein family and expand the catalytic repertoire of nonheme iron hydroxylases. These new findings also generate a nearly complete description of the PQQ biosynthetic pathway.",Functionalized Cyclophellitols Are Selective Glucocerebrosidase Inhibitors and Induce a Bona Fide Neuropathic Gaucher Model in Zebrafish.,https://www.ncbi.nlm.nih.gov/pubmed/30811188,Journal of the American Chemical Society,2019 03 29,"Gaucher disease is caused by inherited deficiency in glucocerebrosidase (GBA, a retaining β-glucosidase), and deficiency in GBA constitutes the largest known genetic risk factor for Parkinson's disease. In the past, animal models of Gaucher disease have been generated by treatment with the mechanism-based GBA inhibitors, conduritol B epoxide (CBE), and cyclophellitol. Both compounds, however, also target other retaining glycosidases, rendering generation and interpretation of such chemical knockout models complicated. Here we demonstrate that cyclophellitol derivatives carrying a bulky hydrophobic substituent at C8 are potent and selective GBA inhibitors and that an unambiguous Gaucher animal model can be readily generated by treatment of zebrafish with these.",Compressing the Four-Index Two-Electron Repulsion Integral Matrix using the Resolution-of-the-Identity Approximation Combined with the Rank Factorization Approximation.,https://www.ncbi.nlm.nih.gov/pubmed/30811187,Journal of chemical theory and computation,2019 04 10,"The four-index two-electron repulsion integral (4-2ERI) matrix is compressed using the resolution-of-the-identity (RI) approximation combined with the rank factorization approximation (RFA). The 4-2ERI is first approximated by the RI product. Then, the singular value decomposition (SVD) approximation is used to eliminate low-weighted singular vectors. The SVD RI approximation maintains the canonical form of the RI approximation and introduces a tunable compression factor. The characteristics of the SVD RI approximation along with the stochastic RI and natural auxiliary function approximation were numerically examined by applying these methods to the closed-shell second-order Møller-Plesset perturbation theory (MP2). The results show that, while the SVD RI approximation yields large errors for absolute properties (e.g., the correlation energy), it provides accurate relative properties (potential energy surface, binding energy) of the applied ab initio method (e.g., RHF, MP2).",Targeting Antioxidants to Interfaces: Control of the Oxidative Stability of Lipid-Based Emulsions.,https://www.ncbi.nlm.nih.gov/pubmed/30811186,Journal of agricultural and food chemistry,2019 04 03,"The oxidation of lipid-based emulsions and nanoemulsions strongly affects their overall quality and safety. Moreover, introduction of oxidatively unstable emulsions into biological systems either as an energy source in parenteral nutrition or as delivery systems of bioactives may promote oxidation ""in situ"" leading to the overproduction of reactive oxygen species, initiating new harmful oxidative reactions and increasing the oxidative damage. Addition of antioxidants, AOs, may help to prevent the oxidative degradation of unsaturated lipids. Nevertheless, prediction of the optimal antioxidant or set of antioxidants and their efficiency is still far from being completely understood because the site of reaction is often uncertain and because the effective concentrations of reactants in the different regions of the emulsion have been frequently overlooked. Furthermore, the absence of quantitative relationships between the hydrophobicity of the antioxidants and their partitioning among the oil, water, and interfacial regions hampers their optimal use. Here we investigated the effects of gallic acid and some of its alkyl derivatives on the oxidative stability of soybean oil-in-water emulsions and determined their effective concentrations in the different regions of the emulsion (aqueous, oil, and interface). The results provide physical evidence for the crucial role played by the interfacial region in the reaction between antioxidants and lipid radicals: a direct relationship between interfacial concentrations and the oxidative stability could be established. The results indicate that AOs accumulate in the interfacial region, where the effective concentration is 20-180 times higher than the stoichiometric concentrations. Control of the hydrophobicity of the AOs and of the surfactant concentration allows control of interfacial concentrations: the lower the concentration of surfactant employed, the higher the effective interfacial concentration.",Chemical Lipophilization of Bovine α-Lactalbumin with Saturated Fatty Acyl Residues: Effect on Structure and Functional Properties.,https://www.ncbi.nlm.nih.gov/pubmed/30811185,Journal of agricultural and food chemistry,2019 04 03,"Bovine α-lactalbumin (α-LA) was chemically modified by the covalent attachment of fatty acid residues of different length (lauroyl, palmitoyl, and stearoyl) to modify its functional and antioxidant properties. Structural changes, functional properties, and antioxidant capacity in the pH interval between 3 and 10 were analyzed. Surface properties were improved. The esterification increased the hydrophobic interactions leading to a reduction in the solubility dependent on the incorporation ratio of the fatty acid residues. Improvement in emulsifying, foaming, and antioxidant properties were observed when the length of the fatty acid chains was short and mostly at a basic pH. With these results in mind, experiments could be conducted for the technological applications of these derivatives in the food, pharmaceutical, and cosmetic industries.","Polarizable Transferable Anisotropic United-Atom Force Field Based on the Mie Potential for Phase Equilibria: Ethers, n-Alkanes, and Nitrogen.",https://www.ncbi.nlm.nih.gov/pubmed/30811184,Journal of chemical theory and computation,2019 04 10,"This study proposes a Polarizable Transferable Anisotropic Mie (P-TAMie) force field for ethers and mixtures of ethers with n-alkanes and nitrogen. In our approach, polarizability is accounted for using a charge-on-spring model (also referred to as the Drude model or core-shell model) placed on every united-atom site. Parameters for polarizabilities are obtained from ab initio calculations, without the need to introduce empirical scaling factors. The van der Waals parameters and static partial charges are optimized to minimize deviations to experimental vapor pressure and coexisting liquid density data. Vapor-liquid phase equilibria are calculated using Monte Carlo simulations in the grand canonical ensemble, using a MC scheme with multiparticle moves. Correlation results for pure substances and predictions of mixture behavior obtained from the proposed polarizable force field (P-TAMie) are in good agreement with experimental data. We compare the polarizable force field with an analogous nonpolarizable force field, namely, the Transferable Anisotropic Mie (TAMie) force field, where both force fields share the same intramolecular force field and were parametrized using the same objective function. The comparison should thus single out the role of polarizability in predicting phase equilibria. The comparison of P-TAMie with the nonpolarizable TAMie force field, however, shows very similar results of both models. This study does not include water and aqueous mixtures or other pronounced polar substances.","Peniphenone and Penilactone Formation in Penicillium crustosum via 1,4-Michael Additions of ortho-Quinone Methide from Hydroxyclavatol to γ-Butyrolactones from Crustosic Acid.",https://www.ncbi.nlm.nih.gov/pubmed/30811183,Journal of the American Chemical Society,2019 03 13,"Penilactones A and B consist of a γ-butyrolactone and two clavatol moieties. We identified two separate gene clusters for the biosynthesis of these key building blocks in Penicillium crustosum. Gene deletion, feeding experiments, and biochemical investigations proved that a nonreducing PKS ClaF is responsible for the formation of clavatol and the PKS-NRPS hybrid TraA is involved in the formation of crustosic acid, which undergoes decarboxylation and isomerization to the predominant terrestric acid. Both acids are proposed to be converted to γ-butyrolactones with involvement of a cytochrome P450 ClaJ. Oxidation of clavatol to hydroxyclavatol by a nonheme FeII/2-oxoglutarate-dependent oxygenase ClaD and its spontaneous dehydration to an ortho-quinone methide initiate the two nonenzymatic 1,4-Michael addition steps. Spontaneous addition of the methide to the γ-butyrolactones led to peniphenone D and penilactone D, which undergo again stereospecific attacking by methide to give penilactones A/B.",Comparison of Toxicity-Weighted Disinfection Byproduct Concentrations in Potable Reuse Waters and Conventional Drinking Waters as a New Approach to Assessing the Quality of Advanced Treatment Train Waters.,https://www.ncbi.nlm.nih.gov/pubmed/30811182,Environmental science & technology,2019 04 02,"Advanced treatment trains based on oxidation, biofiltration, and/or granular activated carbon (Ox/BAF/GAC) are an attractive alternative to those based on microfiltration, reverse osmosis, and advanced oxidation (MF/RO/AOP) for the potable reuse of municipal wastewater effluents, but their effluent quality is difficult to validate with respect to chemical contaminants. This study evaluated the sum of the concentrations of 46 disinfection byproducts (DBPs) after treatment by chlorine or chloramines weighted by metrics of toxic potency in 10 full- or pilot-scale reuse trains to estimate the DBP-associated toxicity of their effluents. These total toxicity-weighted DBP concentrations were compared to those measured in their local, conventional drinking waters as a benchmark for water quality receiving regulatory and widespread public acceptance. The results indicated that while the DBP-associated quality of MF/RO/AOP-based reuse waters can readily exceed that of drinking waters, that of Ox/BAF/GAC-based reuse waters can approach or exceed that of drinking waters, particularly when they are chloraminated. Unregulated, halogenated DBPs were the dominant contributors to the estimated DBP-associated toxicity. While RO/AOP treatment preferentially reduced the concentrations of the more toxic brominated DBP species, BAC and GAC treatment favored brominated DBP species by removing DOC but not bromide. Comparing the total toxicity-weighted DBP concentration between reuse and drinking waters provides drinking water as a rational benchmark for water quality comparison, explicitly recognizes that contaminants occur as mixtures, provides utilities flexibility in selecting the most efficient treatment trains to reduce estimated toxicity, and can be expanded to encompass new contaminants as toxic potency data become available."

Hepatitis B vaccination is recommended for medically stable infants weighing 2,000 g or more within 24 hours of birth, unvaccinated infants and children, and unvaccinated adults requesting protection from hepatitis B or who are at increased risk of infection. Acute hepatitis B is defined as the discrete onset of symptoms, the presence of jaundice or elevated serum alanine transaminase levels, and test results showing hepatitis B surface antigen and hepatitis B core antigen. There is no evidence that antiviral treatment is effective for acute hepatitis B. Chronic hepatitis B is defined as the persistence of hepatitis B surface antigen for more than six months. Individuals with chronic hepatitis B are at risk of hepatocellular carcinoma and cirrhosis, but morbidity and mortality are reduced with adequate treatment. Determining the stage of liver disease (e.g., evidence of inflammation, fibrosis) is important to guide therapeutic decisions and the need for surveillance for hepatocellular carcinoma. Treatment should be individualized based on clinical and laboratory characteristics and the risks of developing cirrhosis and hepatocellular carcinoma. Immunologic cure, defined as the loss of hepatitis B surface antigen with sustained HBV DNA suppression, is attainable with current drug therapies that suppress HBV DNA replication and improve liver inflammation and fibrosis.

These disorders are characterized by disordered motility and visceral hypersensitivity that are often worsened by psychological distress. An organized approach to the evaluation of symptoms fosters trusting therapeutic relationships. Patients can be reliably diagnosed without exhaustive testing and can be classified as having gastric bloating, small bowel bloating, bloating with constipation, or belching disorders. Functional dyspepsia, irritable bowel syndrome, and chronic idiopathic constipation are the most common causes of these disorders. For presumed functional dyspepsia, noninvasive testing for Helicobacter pylori and eradication of confirmed infection (i.e., test and treat) are more cost-effective than endoscopy. Patients with symptoms of irritable bowel syndrome should be tested for celiac disease. Patients with chronic constipation should have a rectal examination to evaluate for dyssynergic defecation. Empiric therapy is a reasonable initial approach to functional gastrointestinal disorders, including acid suppression with proton pump inhibitors for functional dyspepsia, antispasmodics for irritable bowel syndrome, and osmotic laxatives and increased fiber for chronic idiopathic constipation.

Cetirizine was initiated at 10 mg daily and increased to 40 mg daily over four weeks, with resultant marked improvement of the patient’s burning sensation. A punch biopsy revealed a perivascular infiltrate of eosinophils. This patient’s symptomatic improvement with cetirizine, which has antagonizing properties against eosinophils, highlights the potential role of eosinophils in the pathogenesis of vesiculobullous Darier disease. We suggest that major basic protein secreted by eosinophils may propagate blister formation in vesiculobullous Darier disease by disrupting desmosomes.

To date, no reports of hydroxychloroquine-induced pustular DRESS syndrome have been associated with Epstein-Barr virus (EBV) reactivation nor imitated other cutaneous adverse drug reactions as in our patient.

Observation: A 56-year-old female presented with a diffuse cutaneous eruption involving the face, trunk, extremities, and palms approximately two weeks after the initiation of hydroxychloroquine therapy for a suspected Sjögren's-like process with inflammatory cervical lymphadenopathy. Skin examination demonstrated diffuse erythematous and edematous papules and pustules on her dorsal and volar hands and fingers, arms, legs, chest, abdomen, back, scalp, and face. In many areas, lesions coalesced into plaques with overlying pustules, scale, and crust. Additional notable exam findings included centralized facial edema, edema of the hands, and cervical lymphadenopathy. Laboratory workup revealed leukocytosis, peripheral eosinophilia, elevated transaminases, and a negative autoimmune workup; however, serology demonstrated EBV reactivation. Histologic assessment displayed a spongiotic dermatitis with eosinophils, superficial perivascular dermatitis, as well as corneal, subcorneal, and intraepidermal neutrophilic microabscesses, mimicking acute generalized exanthematous pustulosis or pustular psoriasis, even though clinical evaluation suggested DRESS syndrome.

Conclusion: To our knowledge, this is the first reported case of hydroxychloroquine-induced pustular DRESS syndrome in the context of EBV reactivation. Given hydroxychloroquine’s immunomodulatory function and association with other cutaneous manifestations, our patient represents a significant diagnostic challenge. Therefore, this case highlights the importance of knowledge regarding overlapping features, histologically and clinically, among acute generalized exanthematous pustulosis, pustular psoriasis, and DRESS syndrome.

While the pathogenesis of AGA is still debated, the consensus is that AGA is an androgen-dependent hair disorder with strong genetic links, and that the testosterone metabolite, dihydrotestosterone (DHT), plays a causal role in its development. DHT binds to the androgen receptor (AR) in scalp dermal papilla cells (DPC) to induce AR-mediated transcription of genes that contribute to AGA in genetically predisposed individuals.

Several studies have established that clascoterone is a potent antiandrogen that is well tolerated and has selective topical activity. The study described herein elucidates a potential mechanism of clascoterone in AGA. Clascoterone was found to inhibit AR-regulated transcription in a reporter cell line with similar efficacy to the 5α-reductase inhibitor, finasteride. More importantly, when compared with another direct AR antagonist, enzalutamide, clascoterone was significantly better at inhibiting IL-6 synthesis from DHT-stimulated primary cultures of human scalp DPC. Therefore, clascoterone may be an excellent candidate to be the first topical antiandrogen for treating AGA.

Study Design: In this open-label, single-arm study, pediatric patients (aged 6 to <17 years) with distal subungual onychomycosis affecting ≥20% of the target great toenail applied tavaborole once daily to all affected toenails (2 drops/great toenail, 1 drop/other toenail) for 48 weeks. In addition, a maximal-use subgroup (aged 12 to <17 years) applied tavaborole to all 10 toenails and ≤2 mm of surrounding skin for the first 28 days.

Results: Treatment-emergent adverse events (TEAEs) were reported by 55.6% of patients; the most frequently reported (≥5% of patients) were nasopharyngitis, contusion, sinusitis, and vomiting. Most TEAEs and local treatment reactions (LTRs) were mild or moderate and considered unrelated to treatment. There was 1 serious AE (severe appendicitis, considered unrelated to treatment) and there were no deaths, discontinuations because of AEs, or dose adjustments because of AEs. The most frequently reported LTRs were erythema and scaling. The incidence of LTRs diminished over time. Tavaborole was absorbed systemically, and plasma concentrations were measurable. The PK parameters determined in this study under maximal-use conditions indicate that steady state was achieved within the study period. For efficacy, 8.5% of patients achieved complete cure (clear nail and negative mycology [negative fungal culture and negative potassium hydroxide wet mount]) at week 52, and 14.9% achieved complete/almost complete cure at week 52 (clear or almost clear nail [≤5% dystrophic or discolored distal toenail plate] and negative mycology).

Conclusion: Tavaborole was well tolerated in this pediatric population, and safety, PK, and efficacy profiles were comparable with those in adults.

Representatives of this group of compounds can be detected in such classes of plants as gymnosperms, angiosperms, bryophytes and pteridophyte. The main food sources are the fruits of grapes, blueberries, blueberries, peanuts, cocoa. The history of their detection is associated with the discovery of the protective functions of plants in response to the action of external stimuli. Further study revealed pronounced antioxidant properties. The mechanism of development of many diseases is associated with the processes of oxidation of free radicals, which can be interrupted by the effect of antioxidants. Possible mechanisms of antioxidant action of stilbenoids and their effect on diseases caused by excessive amounts of free radicals have been studied. Stilbenoids increase the tone and stability of the body to stress factors of the environment, improve the adaptive capacity of the nervous and immune systems, show antitumor, cardio-protective and lipid-lowering activities, inhibit lipid peroxidation. In this regard specialized products, food supplements and drugs containing stilbenoids have been developed. However, representatives of this group of compounds have low consumer properties, are sensitive to environmental factors and have low solubility and absorption. Therefore, solutions of these problems are important when developing new foods and drugs. Nowadays, auxiliary substances (solubilizers) are used, as well as such technological methods as microencapsulation, coacervation, polymerization, and others that can cope with problems of instability, poor solubility, low bioavailability, and unsatisfactory consumer qualities, which improve the effect of stilbenoids on the organism.",[Carbohydrate-related nutritional and genetic risks of obesity for indigenous northerners].,https://www.ncbi.nlm.nih.gov/pubmed/30811129,Voprosy pitaniia,2019 02 27,"By the end of the 2010-s the prevalence of obesity among the indigenous people of the North approached to the all-Russia one and the speed of the spread of other metabolic disorders exceeded the average all-country levels. Aim of this review is to analyze data on the increase in consumption and variety of sugars coupled with a genetic specificity of regulation of saccharidase activity and their possible impact on the matters. Results. It have been shown that the traditional protein-lipid-based northern type diet has substantially changed and now contains a high proportion of carbohydrates. The carbohydrate per capita consumption among the indigenous people of the North has reached the all-Russia average level (40 kg per year) which exceeds the European average of 36.2 kg per year. The variety of food disaccharides has also considerably increased. The daily consumption of sucrose, at the beginning of the 20th century it was the only sugar contained in the store-bought foods, increased from 30 g in the 1930s to 63-65 g in the 1990s. In addition, the proportion of sucrose dropped to 60-70 per cent, while the contribution of other disaccharides (lactose, trehalose) reached 30-40 per cent. Daily starch consumption has also increased and got close to the national average (males 228.5 g, females 157.5 g per day). Such a diet in itself increases the risk of metabolic disorders and obesity. The high prevalence of the genotypes that determine reduced levels or inability to produce sucrase-isomaltase, lactase, trehalase, salivary and pancreatic amylases among northerners becomes a negative cofactor. The evolutionary driven and embodied in genotype reduced ability of the indigenous Arctic people to digest complex carbohydrates is in a conflict with the growing consumption of sugars and starchy foods in modern conditions. The northern people have a high proportion of carriers of the AG deletion in SI gene (3.5-14.3% against 0.05-0.2% among Europeans) which determines malabsorption of sucrose. The CC/LCT genotype (96.6% in northerners, 36-49% in Russians) presumes lactose intolerance and is associated with the risk of childhood obesity. The occurrence of A allele in the rs2276064 locus of TREH gene (trehalose intolerance; 31.3-58.9% in northerners, 1.9% in Europeans) increases the probability of the onset of type 2 diabetes mellitus. According to preliminary estimates, 28-52% of the northerners completely lost AMY gene that precludes or drastically reduces the ability to digest starch. A reduction in the number of copies of AMY gene (the average number of copies AMY2A - 4, in, in northerners it is 1.0-1.4) is associated with overweight and obesity. Conclusion. The analysis shows that, in the case of the modern indigenous northerners, nutritional and genetic risks of metabolic disorders accumulate.",[Good practice in the general practitioner's clinical laboratory].,https://www.ncbi.nlm.nih.gov/pubmed/30811122,Revue medicale suisse,2019 03 23,"The possibility of doing biological tests directly on the premises of a general practice is a Swiss particularity.

Due to the healing effects of mesenchymal stromal cells (MSCs) and supporting capability of fibrin scaffold (FS), we evaluated the efficacy of a stem-cell therapy for EAL by engrafting adult and autologous MSCs (AAMSCs) in FS and investigated the potential mechanism. Twenty-one rabbits were assigned to AAMSC/FS group (n = 12) and control group (n = 9). After harvested, AAMSCs were identified and then labeled with lenti.GFP. To construct EAL model, a polyethylene tube was indwelled through the anastomosis for 1 week. A total of 2 × 106 AAMSCs in 0.2 ml FS were engrafted onto the EAL for the AAMSC/FS group, whereas FS was injected for control. Magnetic Resonance Imaging (MRI) examination was performed after 5 weeks. Esophageal tissues were harvested for macroscopic, histological analyses, Western blot, and immunohistochemistry at 8 weeks. The animal model of EAL was established successfully. MRI scanning revealed a decreased inflammation reaction in AAMSC/FS group. Accordingly, AAMSC/FS group presented a higher closure rate (83.3% vs. 11.1%, p = .02) and lower infection rate (33.3% vs. 88.9%, p = .02). Histological analyses showed the autografted MSCs resided in the injection site. Furthermore, milder inflammation responses and less collagen deposition were observed in AAMSC/FS group. Western blot and immunohistochemistry studies suggested that the therapeutic effect might be related to the secretions of IL-10 and MMP-9. Engrafting AAMSCs in FS could be a promising therapeutic strategy for the treatment of EAL by suppressing inflammation response and alleviating fibrosis progression.

Participants were classified to have high BP if they had pre-hypertension or hypertension. Interviews were done using the WHO STEPS instrument. Using data from both countries (n = 1596), the overall prevalence of high BP was 40% (95% CI: 37-42). The prevalence of pre-hypertension was 29% (95% CI: 26-31) and that of hypertension was 11% (95% CI: 10-13). High BP was independently associated with obesity (aOR = 6.7, 95% CI: 2.2-20.0), male sex (aOR = 3.2, 95% CI: 2.4-4.4), and among males aged above 20 years (aOR = 5.5, 95% CI: 2.9-10.5).

As many countries are moving towards decriminalization, it is crucial to determine whether and how cannabis use affects human brain and behavior. The role of the cerebellum in cognition, emotion, learning, and addiction is increasingly recognized. Because of its high density in CB1 receptors, it is expected to be highly affected by cannabis use. The aim of this systematic review is to investigate how cannabis use affects cerebellar structure and function, as well as cerebellar-dependent behavioral tasks. Three databases were searched for peer-reviewed literature published until March 2018. We included studies that focused on cannabis effects on cerebellar structure, function, or cerebellar-dependent behavioral tasks. A total of 348 unique records were screened, and 40 studies were included in the qualitative synthesis. The most consistent findings include (1) increases in cerebellar gray matter volume after chronic cannabis use, (2) alteration of cerebellar resting state activity after acute or chronic use, and (3) deficits in memory, decision making, and associative learning. Age of onset and higher exposure to cannabis use were frequently associated with increased cannabis-induced alterations. Chronic cannabis use is associated with alterations in cerebellar structure and function, as well as with deficits in behavioral paradigms that involve the cerebellum (eg, eyeblink conditioning, memory, and decision making). Future studies should consider tobacco as confounding factor and use standardized methods for assessing cannabis use. Paradigms exploring the functional activity of the cerebellum may prove useful as monitoring tools of cannabis-induced impairment.",Towards multiscale modeling of the CD8+ T cell response to viral infections.,https://www.ncbi.nlm.nih.gov/pubmed/30811096,Wiley interdisciplinary reviews. Systems biology and medicine,2019 06 13,"The CD8+ T cell response is critical to the control of viral infections. Yet, defining the CD8+ T cell response to viral infections quantitatively has been a challenge. Following antigen recognition, which triggers an intracellular signaling cascade, CD8+ T cells can differentiate into effector cells, which proliferate rapidly and destroy infected cells. When the infection is cleared, they leave behind memory cells for quick recall following a second challenge. If the infection persists, the cells may become exhausted, retaining minimal control of the infection while preventing severe immunopathology. These activation, proliferation and differentiation processes as well as the mounting of the effector response are intrinsically multiscale and collective phenomena. Remarkable experimental advances in the recent years, especially at the single cell level, have enabled a quantitative characterization of several underlying processes. Simultaneously, sophisticated mathematical models have begun to be constructed that describe these multiscale phenomena, bringing us closer to a comprehensive description of the CD8+ T cell response to viral infections. Here, we review the advances made and summarize the challenges and opportunities ahead.

Such reduction is more common in spontaneous, casual, conversational speech, but it occurs in connected speech in formal settings, and rarely even in careful word-list reading. Such speech poses challenges for phonetic transcription, since it contains many sounds that do not seem to be any particular sound of the language and that are difficult to classify into categories. I argue this is because reduction operates largely outside the phonological system of the language. Reduced speech also poses questions about how listeners recognize the many possible forms of words, since speech seems to be made up entirely of variability.

The early discovery of FASD is crucial for mother and infant follow-ups. In this study, we investigated in pregnant women the association between urine ethylglucuronide (EtG-a biomarker of alcohol drinking) and indicators of the physical characteristics of FASD by prenatal ultrasound in the second trimester of gestation. We also correlated these data with the AUDIT-C, T-ACE/TACER-3, TWEAK, and food habit diary, screening questionnaires used to disclose alcohol drinking during pregnancy. Forty-four pregnant women were randomly enrolled and examined for ultrasound investigation during the second trimester of gestation. Urine samples were provided by pregnant women immediately after the routine interviews. EtG determinations were performed with a cutoff established at 100 ng/mL, a value indicating occasional alcohol drinking. Fifteen of the enrolled pregnant women overcame the EtG cutoff (34.09%). Analysis of variance (ANOVA) revealed that the fetuses of the positive EtG pregnant women had significantly longer interorbital distance and also significantly increased frontothalamic distance (P's < 0.02). Quite interestingly, no direct correlation was found between EtG data and both food diary and AUDIT-C. However, a significant correlation was observed between urinary EtG and T-ACE (r = 0.375; P = 0.012) and between urinary EtG and TWEAK (r = 0.512; P < 0.001) and a concordance with all questionnaire for EtG values higher than 500 ng/mL.

Delayed treatment of this condition causes the loss of skin function and integrity that could lead to the development of chronic wounds or even death. This study was aimed to develop a rapid wound treatment modality using ovine tendon collagen type I (OTC-I) bio-scaffold with or without noncultured skin cells. Genipin (GNP) and carbodiimide (EDC) were used to cross-link OTC-I scaffold to improve the mechanical strength of the bio-scaffold. The physicochemical, biomechanical, biodegradation, biocompatibility, and immunogenicity properties of OTC-I scaffolds were investigated. The efficacy of this treatment approach was evaluated in an in vivo skin wound model. The results demonstrated that GNP cross-linked OTC-I scaffold (OTC-I_GNP) had better physicochemical and mechanical properties compared with EDC cross-linked OTC-I scaffold (OTC-I_EDC) and noncross-link OTC-I scaffold (OTC-I_NC). OTC-I_GNP and OTC-I_NC demonstrated no toxic effect on cells as it promoted higher cell attachment and proliferation of both primary human epidermal keratinocytes and human dermal fibroblasts compared with OTC-I_EDC. Both OTC-I_GNP and OTC-I_NC exhibited spontaneous formation of bilayer structure in vitro. Immunogenic evaluation of OTC-I scaffolds, in vitro and in vivo, revealed no sign of immune response. Finally, implantation of OTC-I_NC and OTC-I_GNP scaffolds with noncultured skin cells demonstrated enhanced healing with superior skin maturity and microstructure features, resembling native skin in contrast to other treatment (without noncultured skin cells) and control group. The findings of this study, therefore, suggested that both OTC-I scaffolds with noncultured skin cells could be promising for the rapid treatment of full-thickness skin wound."

We compiled an inventory of invertebrate biodiversity along an elevation gradient on the temperate forested island of Hauturu, New Zealand, by DNA barcoding of specimens obtained from leaf litter samples and pitfall traps. We compared the barcodes and biodiversity estimates from this data set with those from a parallel DNA metabarcoding analysis of soil from the same locations, and with pre-existing sequences in reference databases, before exploring the use of combined data sets as a basis for estimating total invertebrate biodiversity. We obtained 1,282 28S and 1,610 COI barcodes from a total of 1,947 invertebrate specimens, which were clustered into 247 (28S) and 366 (COI) OTUs, of which ≤ 10% were represented in GenBank. Coleoptera were most abundant (730 sequenced specimens), followed by Hymenoptera, Diptera, Lepidoptera, and Amphipoda. The most abundant OTU from both the 28S (153 sequences) and COI (140 sequences) data sets was an undescribed beetle from the family Salpingidae. Based on the occurrences of COI OTUs along the elevation gradient, we estimated there are ~1,000 arthropod species (excluding mites) on Hauturu, including 770 insects, of which 344 are beetles. A DNA metabarcoding analysis of soil DNA from the same sites resulted in the identification of similar numbers of OTUs in most invertebrate groups compared with the DNA barcoding, but less than 10% of the DNA barcoding COI OTUs were also detected by the metabarcoding analysis of soil DNA. A mark-recapture analysis based on the overlap between these data sets estimated the presence of approximately 6,800 arthropod species (excluding mites) on the island, including ~3,900 insects. Estimates of New Zealand-wide biodiversity for selected arthropod groups based on matching of the COI DNA barcodes with pre-existing reference sequences suggested over 13,200 insect species are present, including 4,000 Coleoptera, 2,200 Diptera, and 2,700 Hymenoptera species, and 1,000 arachnid species (excluding mites). These results confirm that metabarcoding analyses of soil DNA tends to recover different components of terrestrial invertebrate biodiversity compared to traditional invertebrate sampling, but the combined methods provide a novel basis for estimating invertebrate biodiversity.",Comparative limb bone scaling in turtles: Phylogenetic transitions with changes in functional demands?,https://www.ncbi.nlm.nih.gov/pubmed/30811074,Journal of morphology,2019 03 08,"Several terrestrial vertebrate clades include lineages that have evolved nearly exclusive use of aquatic habitats. In many cases, such transitions are associated with the evolution of flattened limbs that are used to swim via dorsoventral flapping. Such changes in shape may have been facilitated by changes in limb bone loading in novel aquatic environments. Studies on limb bone loading in turtles found that torsion is high relative to bending loads on land, but reduced compared to bending during aquatic rowing. Release from torsion among rowers could have facilitated the evolution of hydrodynamically advantageous flattened limbs among aquatic species. Because rowing is regarded as an intermediate locomotor stage between walking and flapping, rowing species might show limb bone flattening intermediate between the tubular shapes of walkers and the flattened shapes of flappers. We collected measurements of humeri and femora from specimens representing four functionally divergent turtle clades: sea turtles (marine flappers), softshells (specialized freshwater rowers), emydids (generalist semiaquatic rowers), and tortoises (terrestrial walkers). Patterns of limb bone scaling with size were compared across lineages using phylogenetic comparative methods. Although rowing taxa did not show the intermediate scaling patterns we predicted, our data provide other functional insights. For example, flattening of sea turtle humeri was associated with positive allometry (relative to body mass) for the limb bone diameter perpendicular to the flexion-extension plane of the elbow. Moreover, softshell limb bones exhibit positive allometry of femoral diameters relative to body mass, potentially helping them maintain their typical benthic position in water by providing additional weight to compensate for shell reduction. Tortoise limb bones showed positive allometry of diameters, as well as long humeri, relative to body mass, potentially reflecting specializations for resisting loads associated with digging. Overall, scaling patterns of many turtle lineages appear to correlate with distinctive behaviors or locomotor habits.",How bearded capuchin monkeys (Sapajus libidinosus) prepare to use a stone to crack nuts.,https://www.ncbi.nlm.nih.gov/pubmed/30811071,American journal of primatology,2019 03 18,"Bearded capuchin monkeys crack nuts with naturally varying stone hammers, suggesting they may tune their grips and muscular forces to each stone.

We examined the behavior of (a) four monkeys (all proficient at cracking nuts) with two larger (1 kg) and two smaller (0.5 kg) stones, (b) 12 monkeys with one 1 kg stone, and (c) one monkey during its first 100 strikes with an initially unfamiliar 1 kg stone.

We infer that the first discrete action (Spin) aided the monkey in determining where to grip the stone, the second (Flip) allowed it to position the stone on the anvil ergonomically before lifting it, and the third (Preparatory Lift) readied the monkey for the strenuous lifting action. The monkey that provided 100 strikes with one initially unfamiliar stone performed fewer Spins in later strikes but performed Flip and Preparatory Lift at consistent rates. The monkeys gripped the stone with both hands along the sides to lift it, but usually moved one or both hands to the top of the stone at the zenith of the lift for the downward strike. The findings highlight two new aspects of the capuchins' nut-cracking: (a) Anticipatory actions with the stone before striking, especially when the stone is larger or unfamiliar, and when initiating striking and (b) shifting grips on the stone during a strike. We invite researchers to investigate if other taxa use anticipatory actions and shift their grips during percussive activity.",Case of coincident severe acne and psoriasis in AIDS patient successfully treated with antiretroviral therapy.,https://www.ncbi.nlm.nih.gov/pubmed/30811070,The Journal of dermatology,2019 04 26,"Cutaneous disorders remain a major problem in HIV-infected patients, even under antiretroviral therapy (ART). Patients at any stage of HIV/AIDS may suffer from skin lesions. Acnes and psoriasis are both common chronic and inflammatory skin diseases, and the treatment becomes more challenging and complex when combined with HIV infection. Whether the incidence and severity of acne and psoriasis are related to HIV infection is still controversial. Here, we report a rare case of an AIDS patient who developed severe acne along with psoriasis. The patient had initially received multiple systemic and topical antipsoriatic and anti-acne treatments which failed. Ultimately, he achieved dramatic clinical improvement after initiation of ART for main treatment. An 8-year follow up demonstrated that the patient has been free of symptoms of both psoriasis and acne till now.",Thiadiazolo-Azaacenes.,https://www.ncbi.nlm.nih.gov/pubmed/30811069,"Chemistry (Weinheim an der Bergstrasse, Germany)",2019 04 26,"This work reports the synthesis and characterization of bis- and tetrakis(thiadiazolo)-appended di- and tetraazaacenes, displaying up to seven catenated benzene/pyrazine rings.

Among the social drivers of natal emigration, the conspecific attraction, aggressive eviction, and reduced social integration hypotheses predict that sexually mature individuals who receive more aggressive behavior and are engaged in less affiliative interactions are more likely to disperse. Few reports have explored these proximate factors affecting emigration in cooperatively breeding species, particularly of Neotropical primates. In this study, we investigated the dispersal patterns and tested the social drivers of natal emigration in the golden lion tamarin (Leontopithecus rosalia) - an endangered species inhabiting Atlantic rainforests fragments in Brazil. We used behavioral and demographic data collected during 7 years from 68 groups of tamarins inhabiting 20 forest fragments. Our analyses from the 160 dispersing individuals showed that dispersal success is higher for males and for those engaged in parallel dispersal, but that males and females use different strategies to enhance their dispersal success, males immigrate into established groups while females form new groups. We did not find high levels of agonistic behavior among group members before natal emigration. Instead we found that conspecific attraction drives natal emigration in both sexes, while additionally the low level of affiliative interactions within the natal group triggers male emigration. We discuss natal emigration in the broader perspective of the cooperative breeding system and the implications of these findings for the conservation of the species.","Training in cardiac surgery using human cadavers: Effectiveness of ""Silent Teachers"".",https://www.ncbi.nlm.nih.gov/pubmed/30811067,Journal of cardiac surgery,2019 04 04,"Surgical skills acquisition in cardiac surgery requires consistent and hard practice.

Due to the crucial importance of this signaling pathway, dysregulation of the MAPK signaling cascades is involved in the pathogenesis of various human cancer types. Oxidative stress and DNA damage are two important factors which in common lead to carcinogenesis through dysregulation of this signaling pathway. Reactive oxygen species (ROS) are a common subproduct of oxidative energy metabolism and are considered to be a significant physiological modulator of several intracellular signaling pathways including the MAPK pathway. Studies demonstrated that the MAP kinases extracellular signal-regulated kinase (ERK) 1/2 and p38 were activated in response to oxidative stress. In addition, DNA damage is a partly common circumstance in cell life and may result in mutation, cancer, and even cell death. Recently, accumulating evidence illustrated that the MEK/ERK pathway is associated with the suitable performance of cellular DNA damage response (DDR), the main pathway of tumor suppression. During DDR, the MEK/ERK pathway is regularly activated, which contributes to the appropriate activation of DDR checkpoints to inhibit cell division. Therefore, the aim of this review is to comprehensively discuss the critical function of MAPK signaling in oxidative stress, DNA damage, and cancer progression.",Effects of AURKA-mediated degradation of SOD2 on mitochondrial dysfunction and cartilage homeostasis in osteoarthritis.,https://www.ncbi.nlm.nih.gov/pubmed/30811038,Journal of cellular physiology,2019 03 04,"This study aimed to investigate the mechanism of the ubiquitinase Aurora kinase A (AURKA) in the occurrence of osteoarthritis (OA) by mediating mitochondrial stress. Bioinformatic predictions revealed 2247 differentially expressed genes (DEGs) in the normal and OA tissues. According to the UbiNet database, 39 DEGs that code for ubiquitination enzymes was screened. AURKA was highly expressed in OA tissues and cells. AURKA interference inhibited the elevation of matrix metalloproteinase-13 (MMP-13). (MMP13), sex determining region Y-box 9 (Sox9), and a disintegrin and metalloproteinase with thrombospondin motifs-5 (ADAMTS5) expression and the reduction of collagen type IIα (Col2a1) and Aggrecan expression in interleukin-1 β (IL-1β) induced chondrocytes. The animal experiments proved that depleting AURKA could repress the occurrence of OA. Superoxide dismutase 2 (SOD2) was determined to be AURKA ubiquitination substrate via AURKA expression and bioinformatic prediction experiments. SOD2 expression was lower in OA tissues, but higher in normal joint tissues. AURKA interference activates SOD2. Meanwhile, the IP results confirmed that AURKA could bind to SOD2 and degrade it through K48 ubiquitination. Modification and overexpression of AURKA reduce SOD2 levels. AURKA interference can reverse the reactive oxygen species elevation caused by SOD2 overexpression or lysine-48 (K48) mutation, respectively, leading to mitochondrial dysfunction. Furthermore, AURKA silencing suppressed the occurrence of OA induced by mitochondrial activation. These findings suggest that ubiquitination of AURKA lowers SOD2 expression and affects mitochondrial dysfunction to repress the occurrence of OA. The results of the current study reveal that AURKA ubiquitination influences mitochondrial dysfunction and suppresses the occurrence of OA via degradation of SOD2. These data reveal novel potential targets for OA treatment.",Autophagy-related genes in rainbow trout Oncorhynchus mykiss (Walbaum) gill epithelial cells and their role in nutrient restriction.,https://www.ncbi.nlm.nih.gov/pubmed/30811037,Journal of fish diseases,2019 05 02,"Autophagy is primarily an adaptive response to provide nutrients and energy following exposure to stress and starvation but can also regulate muscle mass and impact infectious disease susceptibility. Expression of 10 autophagy-related (Atg) genes in rainbow trout was monitored throughout the autophagosome formation cycle. The Atg gene sequences of rainbow trout were compared to other species to identify highly conserved regions and to generate primers. Phylogeny trees created with rainbow trout and 14 other species demonstrate that rainbow trout Atg gene sequences have greatest similarity to Atlantic salmon and other fish species. RTgill-W1 cells were subjected to nutrient restriction and compared to cells in normal nutrient conditions using quantitative reverse transcriptase polymerase chain reaction to assess changes in Atg gene expression. Nutrient restriction had a direct impact on Atg gene expression, with atg4, atg9, atg12, lc3, gabarap and becn1 undergoing the greatest differential expression (p < 0.05), most dramatically on Day 3. This was corroborated by Western blot detection of LC3, which also showed a peak of autophagy activity at Day 3 post-nutrient restriction. Atg gene expression revealed autophagy flux in RTgill-W1, as well as, those genes that were most significantly altered by nutrient restriction.",Expression of trophic factors receptors during reinnervation after recurrent laryngeal nerve injury.,https://www.ncbi.nlm.nih.gov/pubmed/30811036,The Laryngoscope,2019 02 27,"An injury of the recurrent laryngeal nerve (RLN) triggers axonal regeneration but results in a poor functional recovery.

The former measures how many items can be stored in working memory when carrying out episodes of concurrent processing. The latter complements this by determining the duration of processing episodes that can be tolerated while successfully storing a fixed number of items. We investigated the generality of previous evidence that working memory period varies with the distribution of longer and shorter processing episodes within a trial, and that notwithstanding such differences, a global measure of period is a reliable predictor of children's educational attainment. We describe data from 184 children, between 7 and 11 years of age, who completed variants of an operation period task with different distributions of processing episodes together with measures of scholastic attainment. Individual differences in period scores were consistent over two test sessions, and were predictive of reading and number skills. We replicated previous effects of the order of longer and shorter processing episodes, but found that they did not generalize fully to other manipulations of order. The results point to the contribution of subtle within-trial sequence configurations for working memory. We make the case for a broader view of what constrains working memory than exists in current models."

An in situ photoirradiation solid-state NMR apparatus has been developed for the irradiation of samples with extremely high efficiency to enable observation of photointermediates which are stationary trapped states. Such observation enables elucidation of the photoreaction processes of photoreceptor membrane proteins. Therefore, in situ photoirradiation is particularly useful study the photocycle of retinal-binding proteins such as sensory rhodopsin I (SRI) and sensory rhodopsin II (SRII) because functional photointermediates have relatively longer half-lives than other photointermediates. As a result, several photointermediates have been trapped as stationary state and their detailed structures and photoreaction cycles have been revealed using photoirradiation solid-state NMR spectroscopy at low temperature. Photoreaction intermediates of bacteriorhodopsin, which functions to provide light-driven proton pump activity, were difficult to trap because the half-lives of the photointermediates were shorter than those of sensory rhodopsin. Therefore, these photointermediates are trapped in a freeze-trapped state at a very low temperature and the NMR signals were observed using a combination of photoirradiation and dynamic nuclear polarization (DNP) experiments.","""Well Now we Have Entered University and So On, but"".

To investigate this question, we present an empirical study on the microgenetic processes unfolding when students discuss their experiences with peers. We develop Josephs and Valsiner's (Social Psychology Quarterly, 61,(1), 68-82, 1998) concepts of circumvention strategies and autodialogue. The study covers 2 focus-group discussions among 2nd semester psychology students aged 20-25, attending the same psychology course at a Danish university. The students were presented with a dilemmatic situation, that they are required make sense of, based on minimal information, by integrating it in their own representations, expectations and life experiences. Our analysis suggests that the students' investment of meaning in themselves and others often occurred through autodialogical negotiation. In such negotiations, circumvention strategies offer the students a solution, enabling them not to get stuck in a dilemma between two oppositional ways of relating to a certain issue, or offers them a new and less upsetting perspective. These findings suggest that reaching a conclusion about themselves and their experience is not just a clear-cut process of making a statement, but a dynamic and complex process in which multiple perspectives and meanings are in play."

Global distribution and ample host range have contributed to the genetic diversity of the etiological agent, Plasmodium. Phylogeographical analyses demonstrated that Plasmodium falciparum and Plasmodium vivax follow an Out of Africa (OOA) expansion, having a higher genetic diversity in African populations and a low genetic diversity in South American populations. Modeling the evolutionary rate of conserved genes for both P. falciparum and P. vivax determined the approximate arrival of human malaria in South America. Bayesian computational methods suggest that P. falciparum originated in Africa and arrived in South America through multiple independent introductions by the transatlantic African slave trade; however, in South America, P. vivax could have been introduced through an alternate migratory route. Alignments of P. vivax mitogenomes have revealed low genetic variation between the South American and Southeast Asian populations suggesting introduction through either pre-Columbian human migration or post-colonization events. To confirm the findings of these phylogeographical analyses, molecular methods were used to diagnose malaria infection in archeological remains of pre-Columbian ethnic groups. Immunohistochemistry tests were used and identified P. vivax but not P. falciparum in histologically prepared tissues from pre-Columbian Peruvian mummies, whereas shotgun metagenomics sequencing of DNA isolated from pre-Columbian Caribbean coprolites revealed Plasmodium-homologous reads; current evidence suggests that only P. vivax might have been present in pre-Columbian South America.",Probiotic mixture of Lactobacillus helveticus R0052 and Bifidobacterium longum R0175 attenuates hippocampal apoptosis induced by lipopolysaccharide in rats.,https://www.ncbi.nlm.nih.gov/pubmed/30810993,International microbiology : the official journal of the Spanish Society for Microbiology,2019 02 27,"In recent years, the beneficial impact of targeted gut microbiota manipulation in various neurological disorders has become more evident. Therefore, probiotics have been considered as a promising approach to modulate brain gene expression and neuronal pathways even in some neurodegenerative diseases. The purpose of this study was to determine the effect of probiotic biotherapy with combination of Lactobacillus helveticus R0052 and Bifidobacterium longum R0175 on the expression levels of proteins critical to neuronal apoptosis in hippocampus of lipopolysaccharide (LPS)-exposed rats. Four groups of animals (Control, LPS, Probiotic + LPS, and Probiotic) were treated with maltodextrin (placebo) or probiotic (109 CFU/ml/rat) for 2 weeks by gavage. On the 15th day, a single intraperitoneal dose of saline or LPS (1 mg/kg) was injected and 4 h later, protein assessment was performed by western blotting in hippocampal tissues. LPS significantly increased the Bax, Bax/Bcl-2 ratio, and cleaved caspase-3 expression along with decreased the Bcl-2 and procaspase-3 protein levels. However, probiotic pretreatment (L. helveticus R0052 + B. longum R0175) significantly downregulated the Bax and Bax/Bcl-2 ratio accompanied with upregulated Bcl-2 expression. Prophylactic treatment with these bacteria also attenuated LPS-induced caspase-3 activation by remarkably increasing the expression of procaspase-3 while reducing the level of cleaved caspase-3 in target tissues. Our data indicate that probiotic formulation (L. helveticus R0052 + B. longum R0175) alleviated hippocampal apoptosis induced by LPS in rats via the gut-brain axis and suggest that this probiotic could play a beneficial role in some neurodegenerative conditions.",Wheat storage proteins: changes on the glutenins after wheat infection with different isolates of Fusarium graminearum.,https://www.ncbi.nlm.nih.gov/pubmed/30810992,International microbiology : the official journal of the Spanish Society for Microbiology,2019 05 17,"Wheat gluten proteins are decisive for the industrial properties of flour, so alterations resulting from grain infection with Fusarium graminearum produce changes in the glutenin content that affect the baking properties. This work analyzes the high-molecular-weight glutenin changes from wheat flour with different degrees of F. graminearum infection at field, since these proteins are determinant for the quality properties of flour. Wheat cultivars-on field trials-infected with F. graminearum isolates of diverse aggressiveness showed severity values between 9.1 and 42.58% and thousand kernel weight values between 28.12 and 32.33 g. Negative correlations between severity and protein content and positive correlations between yield and protein content were observed, employing reversed-phase high-performance liquid chromatography and polyacrylamide gel electrophoresis. Furthermore, the protein signal changes were in agreement for both methodological approaches. Also, the degree of disease observed and the protein changes on infected wheat cultivars varied in relation with the aggressiveness of the isolate responsible for the infection. The principal component analysis showed a close arrangement among protein values obtained by HPLC. For each cultivar, two principal components were obtained, which explained 80.85%, 88.48%, and 93.33% of the total variance (cultivars Sy200, AGP Fast, and Klein Tigre respectively). To our knowledge, the approaches employed for the analysis of protein changes according to the degree of disease, as well as the thorough statistical analysis, are novel for the study of Fusarium Head Blight.",Effect of potential probiotic Leuconostoc mesenteroides FB111 in prevention of cholesterol absorption by modulating NPC1L1/PPARα/SREBP-2 pathways in epithelial Caco-2 cells.,https://www.ncbi.nlm.nih.gov/pubmed/30810991,International microbiology : the official journal of the Spanish Society for Microbiology,2019 05 17,"Mustard kimchi consumption reduces cholesterol levels in rats. To identify lactic acid bacteria (LAB) in kimchi which exert this effect, 20 LAB isolates were evaluated for cholesterol reduction in an in vitro screen. The FB111 strain showed the highest cholesterol-lowering activity and was identified as Leuconostoc mesenteroides. This strain was characterized as a potential probiotic through sequential analyses for resistance to gastrointestinal digestion and bile salts, and adhesion to Caco-2 cells. The Caco-2 cells treated with L. mesenteroides FB111 (6-8 log CFU/mL) showed toxicological effect. The reduction of cholesterol uptake in these cells was inhibited by 48.6% compared to the control and significantly higher than that of the Lactobacillus rhamnosus GG (LGG) strain-treated group after 2-h incubation. The levels of NPC1L1, ABCG5, ABCG8, SREBP-1, SREBP-2, and PPARα gene expression were determined by reverse transcription-quantitative polymerase chain reaction analysis. The L. mesenteroides FB111 and LGG inhibited the mRNA expression of NPC1L1 (P < 0.05), whereas the expression of PPARα was increased. Moreover, the FB111 strain also inhibited the expression of SREBP-2 mRNA. Overall, we found that L. mesenteroides FB111 has efficient cholesterol-lowering effects and might be useful as a probiotic in the food industry.",Improved ethanol productivity and ethanol tolerance through genome shuffling of Saccharomyces cerevisiae and Pichia stipitis.,https://www.ncbi.nlm.nih.gov/pubmed/30810988,International microbiology : the official journal of the Spanish Society for Microbiology,2019 05 17,"Genome shuffling by recursive protoplast fusion between Saccharomyces cerevisiae and Pichia stipitis also known as Scheffersomyces stipitis resulted in a promising yeast hybrid strain with superior qualities than those of the parental strains in enhancing biofuel production. Our study focused on the substrate utilization, ethanol fermentation, and ethanol tolerance of the hybrids and the parental strains. The parental strain S. cerevisiae is limited to utilize only hexose sugars, and this leads to decrease in the ethanol yield when they are subjected to ethanol production from lignocellulosic biomass which is rich in pentose sugars. To overcome this limitation, we constructed a hybrid yeast strain through genome shuffling which can assimilate all the sugars present in the fermentation medium. After two rounds of recursive protoplast fusion, there was a higher increase in substrate utilization by hybrid SP2-18 compared to parental strain S. cerevisiae. SP2-18 was able to consume 34% of xylose sugar present in the fermentation medium, whereas S. cerevisiae was not able to utilize xylose. Further, the hybrid strain SP2-18 was able to reach an ethanol productivity of 1.03 g L-1 h-1, ethanol yield 0.447 g/g, and ethanol concentration 74.65 g L-1 which was relatively higher than that of the parental strain S. cerevisiae. Furthermore, the hybrid SP2-18 was found to be stable in the production of ethanol. The random amplified polymorphic DNA profile of the yeast hybrid SP2-18 shows the polymorphism between the parental strains indicating the migration of specific sugar metabolizing genes from P. stipitis, while the maximum similarity was with the parent S. cerevisiae.",Modulation of laccase transcriptome during biodegradation of naphthalene by white rot fungus Pleurotus ostreatus.,https://www.ncbi.nlm.nih.gov/pubmed/30810987,International microbiology : the official journal of the Spanish Society for Microbiology,2019 05 17,"Biodegradation of polycyclic aromatic hydrocarbons (PAHs) using Pleurotus ostreatus was investigated in the current study along with the expression levels of laccase genes involved in biodegradation under variable conditions. Biodegradation of PAHs (naphthalene, anthracene, and 1,10-phenanthroline) was detected spectrophotometrically. Recorded data revealed that biodegradation of the tested PAHs was time dependent. Elevated level of naphthalene biodegradation (86.47%) was observed compared to anthracene (27.87%) and 1,10-phenanthroline (24.51%) within 3 days post incubation. Naphthalene was completely degraded within 5 days. Further incubation enhanced the biodegradation of both anthracene and 1,10-phenanthroline until reaches 93.69% and 92.00% biodegradation of the initial concentration within an incubation period of 11 and 14 days, respectively. Naphthalene was selected as a PAH model. HPLC and thin layer chromatography of naphthalene biodegradation products at time intervals proposed that naphthalene was first degraded to α- and β-naphthol which was further metabolized to salicylic and benzoic acid. The metabolic pathway of naphthalene degradation by this fungus was elucidated based on the detected metabolites. The expression profile of six laccase isomers was evaluated using real-time PCR. The transcriptome of the fungal laccase isomers recorded higher levels of transcription under optimized fermentation conditions especially in presence of both naphthalene and Tween 80. The accumulation of such useful metabolites from the biodegradation of PAH pollutants recommended white rot fungus as a potential candidate for production of platform chemicals from PAH wastes.",Role of the antioxidant defense system during the production of lignocellulolytic enzymes by fungi.,https://www.ncbi.nlm.nih.gov/pubmed/30810986,International microbiology : the official journal of the Spanish Society for Microbiology,2019 05 17,"Fungi are used for the production of several compounds and the efficiency of biotechnological processes is directly related to the metabolic activity of these microorganisms. The reactions catalyzed by lignocellulolytic enzymes are oxidative and generate reactive oxygen species (ROS). Excess of ROS can cause serious damages to cells, including cell death. Thus, the objective of this work was to evaluate the lignocellulolytic enzymes produced by Pleurotus sajor-caju CCB020, Phanerochaete chrysosporium ATCC 28326, Trichoderma reesei RUT-C30, and Aspergillus niger IZ-9 grown in sugarcane bagasse and two yeast extract (YE) concentrations and characterize the antioxidant defense system of fungal cells by the activities of superoxide dismutase (SOD) and catalase (CAT). Pleurotus sajor-caju exhibited the highest activities of laccase and peroxidase in sugarcane bagasse with 2.6 g of YE and an increased activity of manganese peroxidase in sugarcane bagasse with 1.3 g of YE was observed. However, P. chrysosporium showed the highest activities of exoglucanase and endoglucanase in sugarcane bagasse with 1.3 g of YE. Lipid peroxidation and variations in SOD and CAT activities were observed during the production of lignocellulolytic enzymes and depending on the YE concentrations. The antioxidant defense system was induced in response to the oxidative stress caused by imbalances between the production and the detoxification of ROS.",Strategical isolation of efficient chicken feather-degrading bacterial strains from tea plantation soil sample.,https://www.ncbi.nlm.nih.gov/pubmed/30810985,International microbiology : the official journal of the Spanish Society for Microbiology,2019 05 17,"Chicken feather waste is generally insufficiently utilized despite its high content of protein, constituting an environmental issue. Biodegradation of the waste with enabling microbes provides an advantageous option among the available solutions. In this study, an efficient whole feather-degrading strain was strategically isolated from a soil sample taken from a local tea plantation that has little or nothing to do with feathers. The strain was identified as Bacillus thuringiensis (designated as FDB-10) according to the cloned complete 16S rRNA sequence. The FDB-10 could efficiently degrade briefly heat-treated whole feather (102 °C, 5 min; up to 90% of a maximum concentration of 30 g/L) in a salt medium supplemented with 0.1 g/L yeast extract within 24 h (37 °C, 150 rpm). Addition of carbon sources (glycerol, glucose, starch, Tween 20, Tween 80, 1.25 g/L as glycerol) to the fermentation medium could improve the degradation. However, significant inhibition could be observed when the added carbon source reached the amount usually adopted in the investigation of carbon source preference (1%). Nitrogen source (NH4Cl, (NH4)2SO4, peptone) adversely influenced the performance of the strain. When the molar concentrations of NH4+ were equal for the two salt, the inhibitory effect on degradation of whole feathers was similar. Entirely different from other reported feather-degrading strains showing a preference to melanin-free feather substrates, the strain isolated in this study could degrade melanin-containing feather equally efficiently, and higher protease activity could be detected in the digest mix. As a plus, the strain could degrade feathers in rice wash produced in daily cooking, indicating its potential use in the simultaneous treatment of rice cooker wastewater produced by a rice processing plant. All these results imply that the FDB-10 is a strain with great potential in the biodegradation of feather waste.",Effect of the taxonomic group of fungi and type of substrate on the antioxidant activity of a solid-state fermentation system.,https://www.ncbi.nlm.nih.gov/pubmed/30810984,International microbiology : the official journal of the Spanish Society for Microbiology,2019 05 17,"The enzymatic and non-enzymatic antioxidant activities of a solid-state fermentation system (SSFS) employing six basidiomycete and four ascomycete fungi on orange peel have been evaluated. Class comparisons revealed highly significant effect of fungal group on the antioxidant activity. Peroxidase activity appeared only in the basidiomycete fungi (particularly Pleurotus columbinus, Ganoderma resinaceum, and Pleurotus floridanus) whereas catalase activity appeared in the two fungal groups in favor of the ascomycetes (particularly Paecilomyces variotii and Aspergillus fumigatus). Maximal peroxidase and minimal catalase activities were found at moderate phenolic content, with extreme phenolic levels leading to low peroxidase activity but high catalase activity. Production of the non-enzymatic antioxidants (phenolics, flavonoids, reducing power, and DPPH scavenging) was in favor of the ascomycetes, which showed great native ability to synthesize flavonoids and also to release flavonoids from orange peel. The basidiomycete fungi, which have limited native ability to produce phenolics, had high ability to consume orange peel phenolics. By contrast, the ascomycete fungi exhibited great native ability for production of phenolics and low ability to consume exogenous phenolics."

A Thylakoid Membrane model (T-M model), in which special emphasis has been placed on ferredoxin-NADP+-oxidoreductase (FNR) activation and energy-dependent qE quenching, was applied for quantifying the kinetics of FI and ΔA810. Pea leaves were kept in darkness for 15 min and then the FI and ΔA810 signals were measured upon actinic illumination, applied either directly or after a 10-s light pulse coupled with a subsequent 10-s dark interval. On the time scale from 40 µs to 30 s, the parallel T-M model fittings to both FI and ΔA810 signals were obtained. The parameters of FNR activation and the buildup of qE quenching were found to differ for dark-adapted and preilluminated leaves. At the onset of actinic light, photosystem II (PSII) acceptors were oxidized (neutral) after dark adaptation, while the redox states with closed and/or semiquinone QA(-)QB(-) forms were supposedly generated after preillumination, and did not relax within the 10 s dark interval. In qE simulations, a pH-dependent Hill relationship was used. The rate constant of heat losses in PSII antenna kD(t) was found to increase from the basic value kDconst, at the onset of illumination, to its maximal level kDvar due to lumenal acidification. In dark-adapted leaves, a low value of kDconst of ∼ 2 × 106 s-1 was found. Simulations on the microsecond to 30 s time scale revealed that the slow P-S-M-T phases of the fluorescence induction were sensitive to light-induced FNR activation and high-energy qE quenching. Thus, the corresponding time-dependent rate constants kD(t) and kFNR(t) change substantially upon the release of electron transport on the acceptor side of PSI and during the NPQ development. The transitions between the cyclic and linear electron transport modes have also been quantified in this paper.",Heterotopic Ossification in Hip Arthroscopy: an Updated Review.,https://www.ncbi.nlm.nih.gov/pubmed/30810970,Current reviews in musculoskeletal medicine,2019 06 16,Heterotopic ossification (HO) in hip arthroscopy is a common post-operative complication.

Religious directions, belief salience, spiritual activities and practices are significant assets for dealing with difficult situations and odds of life. Death anxiety can increase the vulnerability of development of any psychological illness. Therefore, it is vital to study whether religiosity can serve as a buffering agent to death anxiety. The objective of our study was to examine the relationship between religiosity and death anxiety among Muslim dars attendees. We also aimed to investigate the gender-based differences in religiosity and death anxiety among Muslim dars attendees. A purposive sample of 200 adults (male n = 100 and female n = 100) with the age range of 20-60 years participated in the present study. The sample was collected from informal religious gatherings (dars) from Islamabad and Rawalpindi. The information was gathered through self-reporting questionnaires, death anxiety scale and index of religiosity. The questionnaires were in Urdu (native language) for ease and convenience of the respondents. Variable correlation analysis and t test was applied statistically through SPSS 21 version. The findings of the study indicate that there is a significant negative relationship between religiosity and death anxiety. Results also revealed that there is insignificant difference in religiosity between male and female Muslim adults. Results also specified that the level of death anxiety is higher in female than in male Muslim adults. Religiosity has a significant inverse relationship with death anxiety, and this can be helpful in reducing the anxiety-related features. Being a trans-diagnostic construct, measures can be taken to control death anxiety in order to enhance the mental well-being of masses. The present research also puts forward that the development of religious beliefs and interventions can help people to better adjust in life.",Tattoo Removal as a Resettlement Service to Reduce Incarceration Among Mexican Migrants.,https://www.ncbi.nlm.nih.gov/pubmed/30810968,Journal of immigrant and minority health,2019 03 12,"In Mexico, tattooed migrants face discrimination and are at high-risk of incarceration, thus, we assessed whether receiving laser tattoo removal affected the likelihood of incarceration. In 2015-2016, 89 adults ages ≥ 18 years with visible tattoos were recruited at a free-clinic to receive laser tattoo removal or assigned to the wait-list; all completed baseline and 6-month questionnaires.

The cell line is adapted to standard cell culture and can be transplanted into syngeneic FVB/N mice. The line maintains a stable phenotype over multiple in vitro passages and rounds of in vivo transplantation. NDLUCD tumors in FVB/N mice exhibit high expression of ErbB2 and ErbB3 and signaling molecules downstream of ErbB2. The syngeneic transplant tumors elicit an immune reaction in the adjacent stroma, detected and characterized using histology, immunophenotyping, and gene expression. NDLUCD cells also express PD-L1 in vivo and in vitro, and in vivo transplants are reactive to anti-immune checkpoint therapy with responses conducive to immunotherapy studies. This new NDLUCD cell line model is a practical alternative to the more commonly used 4T1 cells, and our previously described FVB/N-Tg(MMTV-PyVT)634Mul derived Met-1fvb2 and FVB/NTg(MMTV-PyVTY315F/Y322F) derived DB-7fvb2 cell lines.

In this study, we investigated the composition of the mycorrhizal fungal community in seven terrestrial orchid species inhabiting Song Mountain, Beijing, China, using Illumina MiSeq high-throughput sequencing. The mycorrhizal communities in the seven orchids were mainly composed of members of the Ceratobasidiaceae, Sebacinales, and Tulasnellaceae, while a number of ectomycorrhizal fungi belonging to the Russulaceae, Tricholomataceae, Thelephoraceae, and Cortinariaceae were occasionally observed. However, the dominant fungal associates and mycorrhizal community differed significantly among the orchid species as well as subhabitats. These findings confirm the previous observation that sympatric orchid species show different preferences for mycorrhizal fungi, which may drive niche partitioning and contribute to their cooccurrence.",FAR gene enables the brown planthopper to walk and jump on water in paddy field.,https://www.ncbi.nlm.nih.gov/pubmed/30810963,Science China. Life sciences,2019 02 27,"Many insects can live on water and survive being caught in the rain. Current research has shown that insect cuticular hydrocarbons (CHC) confer desiccation resistance to maintain water balance. In this study, we identified a fatty acyl-CoA reductase gene (NlFAR) of the rice brown planthopper, Nilaparvata lugens that is essential for the production of CHCs, and found that NlFAR is essential for N. lugens to walk and jump on water when moving from one rice plant to another in paddy fields. NlFAR was mainly expressed in the integument at the beginning of each molt. Cuticular surface analysis by scanning electron microscopy and characterization of CHC extracts indicated that N. lugens with knockdown of NlFAR using RNA inference (RNAi) had a neater epicuticle layer and a significant decrease in CHC contents. Knockdown of NlFAR did not influence the desiccation resistance of N. lugens, but the dsNlFAR-treated insects were easily adhered and moistened by water droplets or their own secreted honeydew and unable to walk or jump on water. These results suggested that NlFAR is a crucial enzyme for CHC biosynthesis and cuticle waterproofing, but not for water retention of N. lugens, which may provide a potential strategy for pest management.",Plant Morphogenesis 123: a renaissance in modern botany?,https://www.ncbi.nlm.nih.gov/pubmed/30810962,Science China. Life sciences,2019 04 17,"Plants are a group of multicellular organisms crucial for the biosphere on the Earth. In the 17th century, the founding fathers of modern botany viewed the bud as the basic unit undergoing the plant life cycle. However, for many understandable reasons, the dominant conceptual framework evolved away from the ""bud-centered"" viewpoint to a ""plant-centered"" viewpoint that treated the whole plant, consisting of numerous buds, as a unit and considered the entire plant to be the functional equivalent of an animal individual. While this ""plant-centered"" viewpoint is convenient and great progress has been made using this conceptual framework, some fundamental problems remain logically unsolvable. Previously, I have proposed a new conceptual framework for interpretation of plant morphogenesis, called Plant Morphogenesis 123, which revives a ""bud-centered"" viewpoint. The perspective of Plant Morphogenesis 123 allows us to address new questions regarding to the mechanisms of plant morphogenesis that are important, and technically accessible, but previously neglected under the ""plant-centered"" conceptual framework. In addition to describing these questions, I address a more fundamental question for further discussion: why do people study plants?"

These mini signal transporters elicit acute and chronic effects on recipient cells. Studies regarding exosomes and their relationship to disease, as well as healthy functions, are eliciting extraordinary excitement as data pours in from groups around the world. Reporting of exosome biogenesis, selective loading of cargo, directed release, and resulting changes in adjacent and distal cells are providing information that is changing the way we view cancer progression and treatment. As a result, the properties of exosomes are being exploited for diagnostic, prognostic, and therapeutic applications. First, by referring to the signaling molecules carried by exosomes, they are being tested as indicators of the presence of transformed cells in early stages of cancer. Secondly, the cargo of exosomes secreted from tumors have been linked to prognostic factors and metastatic properties. Thirdly, exosome-based therapies are being developed which utilize the inherent properties of these mini-transporters to affect and interfere with cancer. Exosome creation, loading, and release plays an important role in cancer formation, progression and organotropic metastasis. The developed and developing therapies should be considered with understanding of their advantages and pitfalls, as well as the various roles exosomes play in normal and pathogenic processes.

Challenging the extant historiography that appraises psychoanalysis as a victim of neoliberalism and psychopharmacology, this paper examines how and why Freudian practitioners beat their own retreat from the specter of desegregation.",Serum miR-30c-5p is a potential biomarker for multiple system atrophy.,https://www.ncbi.nlm.nih.gov/pubmed/30810945,Molecular biology reports,2019 04 11,"Multiple system atrophy (MSA) is a neurodegenerative disease that belongs to the α synucleinopathies. Clinically, there is an overlap between MSA and Parkinson's disease (PD), especially at the early disease stage. However, these two pathologies differ in terms of disease progression. Currently, no biomarker exists to differentiate MSA from PD. MicroRNAs are non-coding RNAs implicated in gene expression regulation. MiRNAs modulate cellular activity and they control a range of physiological and pathological functions. miRNAs are found in biofluids, such as blood, serum, plasma, saliva, and cerebrospinal fluid. Many groups, including ours, found that circulating miRNAs are differently expressed in blood, plasma, serum and cerebrospinal fluid of PD and MSA patients. In the present study, our primary aim was to determine if serum mir-30-5p and mir-148b-5p can be used as biomarkers for early diagnosis of PD and/or MSA. Our secondary goal was to determine if serum levels of those miRNAs can be correlated with the patients' clinical profile. Using quantitative PCR (qPCR), we evaluated expression levels of miR-30c-5p and miR148b-5p in serum samples from PD (n = 56), MSA (n = 49), and healthy control (n = 50) subjects. We have found that miR-30c-5p is significantly upregulated in MSA if compared with PD and healthy control subjects. Moreover, serum miR-30c-5p levels correlate with disease duration in both MSA and PD. No significant difference was found in miR-148b-5p among MSA, PD and healthy control subjects. Our results suggest a possible role of serum miR-30-5p as a biomarker for diagnosis and progression of MSA.",Effects of Intravenous Landiolol on Heart Rate and Outcomes in Patients with Atrial Tachyarrhythmias and Acute Decompensated Heart Failure: A Single-Center Experience.,https://www.ncbi.nlm.nih.gov/pubmed/30810944,Drugs - real world outcomes,2019 04 07,"Atrial tachyarrhythmias (ATAs) lead to clinical deterioration and worsening heart failure (HF) in patients with acute decompensated HF (ADHF).

First, functional characterization of isolated strains such as antagonistic property, auto-aggregation, antibiotic susceptibility, and extracellular enzyme production was performed. The isolated Lactobacillus plantarum KCC-41 strain was able to inhibit pathogenic fungal spore formation. It showed susceptibility to common commercial antibiotics drugs. The selected LAB strain was then subjected to microencapsulation with alginate biopolymer. Its ability to survive in in vitro simulated gastro-intestinal fluid was evaluated. It was also used in the fermentation of cabbage kimchi samples. The encapsulated KCC-41 strain could effectively lead to kimchi fermentation in terms of reducing its pH and dominating bacterial count. It also significantly increased organic acid production than non-encapsulated LAB (KCC-41) for cabbage kimchi samples.","Re-purposing is needed for beneficial bugs, not for the drugs.",https://www.ncbi.nlm.nih.gov/pubmed/30810942,International microbiology : the official journal of the Spanish Society for Microbiology,2019 05 13,"Between 150 and 200 species of plants, insects, birds or mammals go extinct every day. We do not have any idea what the global extinction rate for microorganisms is. What is clear is that we have already lost a maximum number of the microbes that used to live in and on our skins. Many of our microbial partners are facing extinction as we apply selection pressures that are unprecedented in our long-standing relationships. Recent estimates are that we have lost at least one third of the diversity of our skin microbiome. Every day, most of us bath or shower in water that contains chlorine or fluorine; these additives do a great job of killing pathogenic microbes, but they are probably not helping our skin microbiome. Most of the people apply cosmetic products every day, as these products contain preservatives that prevent microbial growth on the shelf. These same chemicals may well kill microbes on the skin. The daily use of high-pH soaps probably will not help microbial life that is adapted to living on the skin's natural pH of 5. The rise in the rate of C-section births from around 5% in 1970 to more than 30% today is likely to be a contributing factor. Vaginal microbes seed our skins at birth and C-sections disrupt this process. The overuse of broad-spectrum antibiotics has contributed to the loss of our microbial partners in all body sites and the skin is no exception. It is now clear that skin is an ecosystem that is dependent on commensal microbes for optimal health. In general, a diverse ecosystem is a healthy ecosystem that is robust in the face of change. Low-diversity ecosystems are more fragile and susceptible to dysbiosis. Eczema and acne rates have increased rapidly over the last 50 years. These diseases are almost unknown in hunter-gatherer communities. Now, we face two exciting challenges: finding out which species matter and how to get them back.",An Insight into the Constitutive Proteome Throughout Leishmania donovani Promastigote Growth and Differentiation.,https://www.ncbi.nlm.nih.gov/pubmed/30810941,International microbiology : the official journal of the Spanish Society for Microbiology,2019 05 13,"Anthroponotic visceral leishmaniasis is a life-threatening disease caused by Leishmania donovani (Kinetoplastida: Trypanosomatidae) in East Africa and the Indian subcontinent. Unlike promastigote growth and differentiation in the sand fly gut or in axenic culture, L. donovani promastigote-into-amastigote development has been studied by high-throughput gene expression profiling. In this study, we have identified abundant constitutive proteins in axenically cultured promastigotes by two-dimension electrophoresis and matrix-assisted laser desorption-ionization tandem time-of-flight (MALDI-TOF/TOF) mass spectrometry. Most proteins involved in the trypanothione-based redox antioxidant system are expressed constitutively throughout axenic L. donovani promastigote growth and differentiation (tryparedoxin, trypanothione peroxidase, generic peroxidoxin, iron-superoxide dismutase, and elongation factor 1β).

While motility and biofilm formation were determined by phenotypic assays, the presence of TFP was determined by PCR assay and antibiotic susceptibility by disk diffusion. The results showed a high ability to form biofilm (97.4%), multidrug resistance (44.7%), and the presence of a high number of motile isolates. We also found an association between strong biofilm production and multidrug resistance. Furthermore, TFP group III was associated with strong biofilm production. In contrast, the isolates with TFP group II and those without any TFP were associated with non-strong biofilm production. Regarding motility, TFP group II was associated with higher percentages of swarming, swimming, and twitching, while TFP group I showed lower percentages of swarming and twitching, and TFP group III showed lower levels of swarming and swimming. In conclusion, these findings highlight the differences in P. aeruginosa phenotypes related to the presence of specific TFP groups and their potential implications in clinical settings."

In Thermus thermophilus, nitrate and nitrite transport processes are carried out by major facilitator superfamily (MFS) transporters. The sequence of the nar operon of nitrate-only respiring strains of T. thermophilus includes two tandemly organized MFS transporter genes (narK and narT) of the NarK1 and NarK2 families. Both can function as nitrate/nitrite antiporters, but NarK has been proposed as more specific for nitrate whereas NarT more specific for nitrite. In some nitrate- and nitrite-respiring strains of the same species, a single MFS transporter (NarO) belonging to a different MFS subfamily appears. To analyze the role of this single MFS in the same genetic context, we transferred the two types of nar operon to the aerobic strain HB27, and further included in both of them the ability to respire nitrite. The new denitrifying strains HB27dn, with two MFS, and HB27dp, with a single one, were used to isolate mutants devoid of transporters. Through in trans complementation experiments, we demonstrate that the NarO single MFS works efficiently in the transport of both nitrate and nitrite.","Isolation and Characterization of Novel Lignolytic, Cellulolytic, and Hemicellulolytic Bacteria from Wood-Feeding Termite Cryptotermes brevis.",https://www.ncbi.nlm.nih.gov/pubmed/30810928,International microbiology : the official journal of the Spanish Society for Microbiology,2019 05 13,"In a natural ecosystem, various organisms digest and hydrolyze lignocellulose biomass efficiently. Termites are one of them. They digest lignocellulose biomass with the help of symbiotic microorganisms in their gut. Therefore, termites gut may harbor potential sources of microorganisms capable to degrade lignocellulose biomass. In this study, termite gut microbiomes of Cryptotermes brevis species were isolated and identified for their capability to degrade lignin and polysaccharides. Alkali lignin, carboxymethylcellulose, and xylan were used as the only carbon sources in the medium to isolate lignin-, cellulose-, and hemicellulose-degrading bacteria. By this method, two bacteria strains, Bacillus sp. BMP01 and Ochrobactrum oryzae BMP03 strain were isolated and identified. Bacillus sp. BMP01 strain has capabilities to hydrolyze carboxymethylcellulose and xylan to glucose and xylose, respectively. This strain showed high xylanase activity (about 0.21 U/ml) and carboxymethyl cellulase activity (about 0.25 U/ml). The ability to hydrolyze both carboxymethylcellulose and xylan makes it superior to other known cellulolytic bacteria. Ochrobactrum oryzae BMP03 strain showed laccase activity, which indicates its ability to depolymerize lignin. Lignocellulose-degrading bacteria play a vital role in the biological conversion of lignocellulose biomass to biofuel. Overall, this study shows that termite's gut microbiomes are potential sources of lignocellulose-degrading bacteria that can be cultured and used in the biological conversion of lignocellulose biomass to biofuel.",Floating novel object recognition in adult zebrafish: a pilot study.,https://www.ncbi.nlm.nih.gov/pubmed/30810927,Cognitive processing,2019 06 02,The novel object recognition (NOR) tasks can be used to quantify memory function in zebrafish similarly to rodents. The development of zebrafish learning and memory tests provides a means for testing the effects of pharmacological manipulations of memory. Several authors reported on the successful application of different objects in NOR tests placed either at the bottom of test tanks or submerged into the tank water of zebrafish. This pilot study was designed to test the suitability of floating objects in NOR tests using adult zebrafish. Floating objects such as crumpled aluminum balls and pink plastic hollow pearls were found to be suitable for NOR tests when small groups of zebrafish are used as experimental animals. Adult zebrafish of both sexes were capable of distinguishing between the different colors and surface consistencies of certain floating objects. A significantly higher number of mouth-object contacts were recorded when either floating aluminum balls or floating plastic pearls were used as novel object during NOR tests.,Assessing the Extended In-Use Stability of the Infliximab Biosimilar PF-06438179/GP1111 Following Preparation for Intravenous Infusion.,https://www.ncbi.nlm.nih.gov/pubmed/30810925,Drugs in R&D,2019 06 01,PF-06438179/GP1111 (PF-SZ-IFX) is an infliximab biosimilar.

Growth of the culture in artificial seawater with galactose and monosodium glutamate, pH at 7.2-7.5, and temperature at 35 ± 0.5 °C exhibits pigment production with the yield of 0.700-0.800 g/L. The characterization studies revealed that the pigment is orange reddish pink in color, soluble in water, insoluble in both polar and non-polar organic solvents, and decolorized when exposed to H2O2, KMnO4, and K2Cr2O7. UV-visible spectrum exhibits maximum absorption peak at 330 nm and mild shoulders at 400 and 500 nm. The pigment displayed both antioxidant and reducing power properties when exposed with ABTS and ferricyanide, respectively. The sun protection factor of the pigment was determined as 9.9. The cytocompatibility of the obtained pigment studied using HaCaT cells revealed that the cells are viable up to 500 μM. Experiments on UVB protection of the pigment using HaCat cells demonstrated the appreciable protective effect by reducing the ROS generation upon UVB exposure. In conclusion, the pigment obtained from the marine imperfect fungus showed structural similarity with DHICA which is confirmed by LC-MS. The presence of metal ions in the growth medium mediates the reaction to proceed towards DHICA formation. The SPF analysis, antioxidant property, and the UVB protection studies authenticate the potential use of pigment for skin care.",Burkholderia xenovorans LB400 possesses a functional polyhydroxyalkanoate anabolic pathway encoded by the pha genes and synthesizes poly(3-hydroxybutyrate) under nitrogen-limiting conditions.,https://www.ncbi.nlm.nih.gov/pubmed/30810921,International microbiology : the official journal of the Spanish Society for Microbiology,2019 05 13,"Polyhydroxyalkanoates (PHAs) are biodegradable bioplastics that are synthesized by diverse bacteria. In this study, the synthesis of PHAs by the model aromatic-degrading strain Burkholderia xenovorans LB400 was analyzed. Twelve pha genes including three copies of phaC and five copies of the phasin-coding phaP genes are distributed among the three LB400 replicons. The phaC1ABR gene cluster that encodes the enzymes of the PHA anabolic pathway is located at chromosome 1 of strain LB400. During the growth of strain LB400 on glucose under nitrogen limitation, the expression of the phaC1, phaA, phaP1, phaR, and phaZ genes was induced. Under nitrogen limitation, PHA accumulation in LB400 cells was observed by fluorescence microscopy after Nile Red staining. GC-MS analyses revealed that the PHA accumulated under nitrogen limitation was poly(3-hydroxybutyrate) (PHB). LB400 cells grown on glucose as the sole carbon source under nitrogen limitation accumulated 40 ± 0.96% PHB of the cell dry weight, whereas no PHA was observed in cells grown in control medium. The functionality of the phaC1 gene from strain LB400 was further studied using heterologous expression in a Pseudomonas putida KT40C1ZC2 mutant strain derived from P. putida KT2440 that is unable to synthesize PHAs. Interestingly, KT40C1ZC2[pVNC1] cells that express the phaC1 gene from strain LB400 were able to synthesize PHB (33.5% dry weight). This study indicates that B. xenovorans LB400 possesses a functional PHA synthetic pathway that is encoded by the pha genes and is capable of synthesizing PHB.",Incidence of metallo-beta-lactamase-producing Klebsiella pneumoniae isolates from hospital setting in Pakistan.,https://www.ncbi.nlm.nih.gov/pubmed/30810920,International microbiology : the official journal of the Spanish Society for Microbiology,2019 05 13,"The aim of this study was monitoring and surveillance in different wards of the PIMS hospital, Islamabad, to understand emerging challenges of antibiotic resistance in particular association with most virulent serotypes of Klebsiella pneumoniae. The study was conducted during March 2015 to September 2015. The study showed that rate of isolation of K. pneumoniae was 37% (103 positives out of a total of 277 clinical samples) and 7.7% (8) were phenotypically and genotypically confirmed to be metallo-β-lactamase resistant (carbapenem resistant) and all of them were multidrug resistant (MDR). These carbapenem-resistant isolates were isolated from blood, endotracheal tubes, and pus. Molecular screening for the presence of integrons indicated that distribution of class I integrons (87.5% of carbapenem-resistant K. pneumoniae isolates) was higher than class II integrons (1.25%) among given isolates. The study indicated that exposure of metallo-beta-lactamase-producing strains through hospitalizations increases the chances of spread of MDR pathogens. There is an urgent need for effective surveillance and monitoring strategies to control the spread of extremely resistant K. pneumoniae implicated in nosocomial infections leading to the increased health burden and enforcement of policy guideline on appropriate antibiotics usage.",The sequences of MinE responsible for its subcellular localization analyzed by competitive binding method in Escherichia coli.,https://www.ncbi.nlm.nih.gov/pubmed/30810919,International microbiology : the official journal of the Spanish Society for Microbiology,2019 05 13,"The subcellular localization of a protein is important for its proper function. Escherichia coli MinE is a small protein with clear subcellular localization, which provides a good model to study protein localization mechanism. In the present study, a series of recombinant minEs truncated in one end or in the middle regions, fused with egfp, was constructed, and these recombinant proteins could compete to function with the chromosomal MinE. Our results showed that the sequences related to the subcellular localization of MinE span several functional domains, demonstrating that MinE positioning in cells depends on multiple factors. The eGFP fusions with some truncated MinE from N-terminal resulted in different cell phenotypes and localization features, implying that these fusions can interfere chromosomal MinE's function, similar to MinE36-88 phenotype in the previous report. The amino acid in the region (32-48) is sensitive to change MinE conformation and influence its dimerization. Some truncated protein structure could be unstable. Thus, the MinE localization is prerequisite for its proper anti-MinCD function and some new features of MinE were demonstrated. This approach can be extended for subcellular localization research for other essential proteins.",Isolation of toxic metal-tolerant bacteria from soil and examination of their bioaugmentation potentiality by pot studies in cadmium- and lead-contaminated soil.,https://www.ncbi.nlm.nih.gov/pubmed/30810918,International microbiology : the official journal of the Spanish Society for Microbiology,2019 05 13,"Heavy metals, also regarded as toxic metals, are the important environmental pollutants that affect all forms of life. Accumulation of toxic metals in plants results in various biochemical, physiological and structural disturbances, leading to inhibited growth and sometimes plant death. Toxic metal contamination disturbs the soil ecology as well as the agricultural productivity. Several indigenous microbes can withstand the effect of toxic metal and play a vital role in the revival of tarnished soil. In the present study, soil samples were collected from contaminated crop field of Cachar district of Assam, India. Segregation, enumeration and identification of bacteria from soil samples were performed. Among all the tested isolates, very few were able to withstand a high concentration of Cd and Pb in nutrient agar plates. Toxic metal-tolerant bacteria were identified as Pseudomonas aeruginosa and Bacillus cereus. The isolates having a higher tolerance for Cd and Pb were taken into consideration for pot studies. P. aeruginosa strain SN4 and strain SN5 showed significant results at Cd- and Pb-contaminated soil, evidenced by the healthy growth of Oryza sativa seedlings. However, B. cereus strain SN6 showed high tolerance towards Cd and Pb, but pot experimental studies showed adverse effects on seedling germination and shoot growth of O. sativa. P. aeruginosa strains were significantly able to reduce the negative impact of Cd and Pb in the soil, thus finding an alternative in removal, recovery and remediation of toxic metal-contaminated crop field."

We identify a gene coding for an ubiquitin ligase, ZNRF3, whose overexpression alone can predict the WNT subgroup for 100% in the Pfister dataset. For the SHH subgroup, we identify a gene for a regulatory subunit of the protein phosphatase 2A (PP2A), PPP2R2C, as the major predictor among the E3 ligases genes. The ubiquitin and ubiquitin-like conjugation database (UUCD) lists PPP2R2C as coding for a Cullin Ring ubiquitin ligase adaptor. For group 3 MBs, the best ubiquitin ligase predictor was PPP2R2B, a gene which codes for another regulatory subunit of the PP2A holoenzyme. For group 4, the best E3 gene predictors were MID2, ZBTB18, and PPP2R2A, which codes for a third PP2A regulatory subunit. Heatmap analysis of the E3 gene data shows that expression of ten genes for ubiquitin ligases can be used to classify MBs into the four major consensus subgroups. This was illustrated by analysis of gene expression of ubiquitin ligases of the Pfister dataset and confirmed in the dataset of Cavalli. We conclude that genes for ubiquitin ligases can be used as genetic markers for MB subtypes and that the proteins coded for by these genes should be investigated as subtype specific therapeutic targets for MB.",Participants' Lived Experience with the Illness Management and Recovery (IMR) Program in Relation to their Recovery-Process.,https://www.ncbi.nlm.nih.gov/pubmed/30810903,Community mental health journal,2019 02 27,"The Illness Management and Recovery program (IMR) is developed to support people with severe mental illnesses in their recovery-process.

The tremendous biocatalytic potential of industrial enzymes provides an upper edge over chemical technologies in terms of safety, reusability, and better process control. Tannase is one such enzyme loaded with huge potential for bioconversion of hydrolysable tannins to gallic acid. Tannins invariably occur in pteridophytes, gymnosperms, and angiosperms and predominately cumulate in plant parts like fruits, bark, roots, and leaves. Furthermore, toxic tannery effluents from various tanneries are loaded with significant levels of tannins in the form of tannic acid. Tannase can be principally employed for debasing the tannins that predominately occur in the toxic tannery effluents thus providing a relatively much cheaper measure for their biodegradation. Over the years, microbial tannase-catalyzed tannin degradation has gained momentum. The plentious availability of tannin-containing agro- and industrial waste paves a way for efficient utilization of microbial tannase for tannin degradation eventually resulting into gallic acid production. Gallic acid has received a great deal of attention as a molecule of enormous therapeutic and indusrial potential. The current worldwide demand of gallic acid is 8000 t per annum. As a matter of fact, bioconversion of tannins into gallic acid through fermentation has not been exploited completely. This necessitates further studies for development of more efficient, economical, productive processes and improved strains for gallic acid production so as to meet its current demand.",Porcine and bovine Clostridium difficile ribotype 078 isolates demonstrate similar growth and toxigenic properties.,https://www.ncbi.nlm.nih.gov/pubmed/30810901,International microbiology : the official journal of the Spanish Society for Microbiology,2019 05 13,"Clostridioides (C.) difficile are found in cows, pigs and poultry suggesting that this pathogen is present and more importantly animals could act as a reservoir, via food or environment, of human C. difficile infection.

C. difficile isolates were assessed for the growth behaviour (turbidimetry), metabolic potential (Biolog AN) and toxin production (ELISA method) in vitro. The concentration of released either toxin A (TcdA) or toxin B (TcdB) varied greatly between the isolates tested; however, it did not differ between the porcine and bovine ribotypes. Also, the TcdA/TcdB ratio of the isolates did not show a difference either. The most common metabolised substrates were pyruvic acid followed by α-ketobutyric acid. The results show that both porcine and bovine C. difficile RT 078 share similar phenotypical characteristics including growth and production of toxins. The findings may help understand the virulence of C. difficile RT 078 in porcine and bovine species.",Co-expression of protease and pectinase in Bacillus subtilis using the herbal saponin extract as substrate.,https://www.ncbi.nlm.nih.gov/pubmed/30810900,International microbiology : the official journal of the Spanish Society for Microbiology,2019 05 13,"This study armed to determine the expression of protease and pectinase in Bacillus subtilis using the herbal saponin extract as the fermentation substrates and then characterize the fermentation broths. The saponin concentration in the crude extract from four herbs reached to 25% under the extraction conditions of 60 °C, with a pH 9 for 3 h at a solid-liquid ratio of 1:18. In direct fermentation of Bacillus subtilis in the saponin extract, the maximum activities of protease and pectinase in the cell supernatant reached 3984 and 227 U/ml, respectively. Correspondingly, when 5% glucose was added to this extract for the fermentation, the two maximum activities were up to 2451 and 1390 U/ml, respectively. When characterization of the two abovementioned fermentation broths was carried out, it was observed that the luminousness values were increased to 26.9 and 39.2% from 9.7% of the initial value after 32 h of fermentation, respectively, and there was no significant change in the saponin concentration during the fermentation processes. The evaluation values of washing performance were remarkably improved by 8.2 and 21.7%, respectively.",Microbial production and industrial applications of keratinases: an overview.,https://www.ncbi.nlm.nih.gov/pubmed/30810899,International microbiology : the official journal of the Spanish Society for Microbiology,2019 05 13,"Massive production of keratinaceous byproducts in the form of agricultural and industrial wastes throughout the world necessitates its justified utilization. Chemical treatment of keratin waste is proclaimed as an eco-destructive approach by various researchers since it generates secondary pollutants. Microbial degradation of keratin waste is an emerging and eco-friendly approach and offers dual benefits, i.e., treatment of recalcitrant pollutant (keratin) and procurement of a commercially important enzyme (keratinase). This review summarizes the potential utility of some bacterial and fungal species for the production of keratinase using a variety of keratinaceous wastes as growth substrates. The application of microbial keratinases in waste management; animal feed, detergent, and fertilizer manufacturing; and leather, cosmetic, and pharmaceutical industries is also abridged in this review.",Bio-adsorption and Bio-transformation of Arsenic by Acidithiobacillus ferrooxidans BY3.,https://www.ncbi.nlm.nih.gov/pubmed/30810898,International microbiology : the official journal of the Spanish Society for Microbiology,2019 05 13,"Arsenic, a toxic element in the environment, has seriously threatened the health of hundreds of millions of people in the world. Meanwhile, microorganisms play an important role in the adsorption and bio-transformation of arsenic. Here, we compared the biological characteristics of Acidithiobacillus ferrooxidans BY3 in different media systems, such as arsenic bio-adsorption and bio-transformation capacities. We show that arsenic stress significantly affected the pH and Eh of the culture systems, as well as the oxidation rates of Fe2+ and bacteria numbers. Furthermore, arsenic influenced bacterial structure and composition of the cell membrane, caused volume decreased and changed the vibration conditions of characteristic peaks of surface groups (-CH2, -NH, and -OH) on cell membranes. In addition, At.f-BY3 shows high bio-adsorption abilities and certain bio-transformation abilities for iAsIII. Bio-adsorption and conversion efficiency was also shown to be significantly affected by Fe2+ concentrations in the reaction systems. Statistic analysis revealed 10.07-fold increase of the transformation ability of iAsIII into iAsV in the 9 K growth media containing 1600 mg/L NaAsO2 compared with that in the 1 K growth media. Our findings contribute to understand the applications and microbiological mechanisms of Acidithiobacillus ferrooxidans in arsenic pollution. Graphical Abstract Bio-adsorption and bio-transformation are used as a biological method of heavy metals pollution, such as Cu2+, Ni2+, Pb2+, Cr2+, Zn2+, Cd2+, As3+ and As5+ in acid mine water. The aim of this investigation was to assess the performance of arsenite (iAsIII) to adsorption and transformation by Acidithiobacillus ferrooxidans BY3, and application of Acidithiobacillus ferrooxidans BY3 on the aspect of arsenic pollution has great potential of exploration.","Use of specific PCR primers for the study of sulfate-reducing bacteria diversity in microbial mats of Ebro Delta, Spain.",https://www.ncbi.nlm.nih.gov/pubmed/30810897,International microbiology : the official journal of the Spanish Society for Microbiology,2019 05 13,"Microbial mats are prokaryotic communities that provide model systems to analyze microbial diversity and ecophysiological interactions. Sulfate-reducing bacteria (SRB) play a key role in sulfur and nutrient recycling in these ecosystems. In this work, specific primers for 16S rRNA encoding gene, previously described, were used to study the diversity of SRB in microbial mats of the Ebro Delta. We confirm that this method is reliable to identify the diversity of SRB in these ecosystems. However, some mismatches in obtained sequences had been observed in our system and must be taken under consideration. Various genera of SRB in Ebro Delta microbial mats were identified, such as Desulfonema, Desulfatitalea, Desulfosalsimonas, Desulfoccocus, and Desulfovibrio. The diversity observed in our samples is very similar to previously reported in other microbial mats communities.","Extracellular lipase from Pseudomonas aeruginosa JCM5962(T): Isolation, identification, and characterization.",https://www.ncbi.nlm.nih.gov/pubmed/30810896,International microbiology : the official journal of the Spanish Society for Microbiology,2019 05 13,"The study was done to isolate, identify, and characterize a good lipolytic strain from soil. Lipolytic strain isolation was done using tributyrin agar medium. The biochemical testing and 16S rRNA gene sequencing analysis was done for identification. The enzyme was purified using ammonium sulfate precipitation and column chromatography. Results have shown a novel high lipolytic strain of P. aeruginosa JCM5962(T), isolated from soil of sugarcane field. The 16S rRNA sequence analysis confirmed the strain as P. aeruginosa JCM5962(T); further, the sequence was submitted to Genbank (KX946966.1). The isolate produced an extracellular lipase which was purified as single band of 31 kDa. Maximum lipase activity was observed at 50 °C and pH 8.0. Activity was enhanced in the presence of cobalt and benzene solvent, whereas mercury, sodium dodecyl sulfate, and chloroform inhibited it. The enzyme's marked stability and activity at high temperature, alkaline pH and organic solvents suggest that this can be effectively used in a variety of applications in industries and as biotechnological tools."
