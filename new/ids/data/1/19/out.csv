Intracellular control is exerted to produce energy or maintain intracellular protein quality controls. Autophagy plays an important role in embryogenesis, implantation, and maintenance of pregnancy. This role includes supporting extravillous trophoblasts (EVTs) that invade the decidua (endometrium) until the first third of uterine myometrium and migrate along the lumina of spiral arterioles under hypoxic and low-nutrient conditions in early pregnancy. In addition, autophagy inhibition has been linked to poor placentation-a feature of preeclamptic placentas-in a placenta-specific autophagy knockout mouse model. Studies of autophagy in human placentas have revealed controversial results, especially with regard to preeclampsia and gestational diabetes mellitus (GDM). Without precise estimation of autophagy flux, wrong interpretation would lead to fixed tissues. This paper presents a review of the role of autophagy in pregnancy and elaborates on the interpretation of autophagy in human placental tissues.",Primary Drivers of Willingness to Continue to Participate in Community-Based Health Screening for Chronic Diseases.,https://www.ncbi.nlm.nih.gov/pubmed/31083535,International journal of environmental research and public health,2019 06 10,"As the average age of the population continues to rise in the 21st century, chronic illnesses have become the most prominent threats to human health. Research has shown that early screenings for chronic diseases are an effective way of lowering incidence and mortality rates. However, low participation rates for health screening is one of the main challenges for preventive medicine. The objective of this study was to determine the primary drivers which: (1) first motivate people to participate in community-based health screening for chronic diseases; and (2) increase their willingness to continue to participate.",CoQ10 and Aging.,https://www.ncbi.nlm.nih.gov/pubmed/31083534,Biology,2019 05 14,"The aging process includes impairment in mitochondrial function, a reduction in anti-oxidant activity, and an increase in oxidative stress, marked by an increase in reactive oxygen species (ROS) production. Oxidative damage to macromolecules including DNA and electron transport proteins likely increases ROS production resulting in further damage. This oxidative theory of cell aging is supported by the fact that diseases associated with the aging process are marked by increased oxidative stress. Coenzyme Q10 (CoQ10) levels fall with aging in the human but this is not seen in all species or all tissues. It is unknown whether lower CoQ10 levels have a part to play in aging and disease or whether it is an inconsequential cellular response to aging. Despite the current lay public interest in supplementing with CoQ10, there is currently not enough evidence to recommend CoQ10 supplementation as an anti-aging anti-oxidant therapy.",Inhibitory Effects of Green Tea Polyphenols on Microbial Metabolism of Aromatic Amino Acids in Humans Revealed by Metabolomic Analysis.,https://www.ncbi.nlm.nih.gov/pubmed/31083533,Metabolites,2019 05 14,"The bioactivities and potential health benefits of green tea polyphenols (GTP) have been extensively investigated, but the metabolic impact of chronic GTP intake on humans is not well defined. In this study, fecal and urine samples from postmenopausal female subjects taking a GTP supplement or placebo for 12 months were compared by liquid chromatography-mass spectrometry-based metabolomic analysis. The GTP-derived and GTP-responsive metabolites were identified and characterized by structural elucidation and quantitative analysis of the metabolites contributing to the separation of control and treatment samples in the multivariate models. Major GTP and their direct sulfate and glucuronide metabolites were absent in feces and urine. In contrast, GTP-derived phenyl-Î³-valerlactone and phenylvaleric acid metabolites were identified as the most abundant GTP-derived metabolites in feces and urine, suggesting extensive microbial biotransformation of GTP in humans. Interestingly, GTP decreased the levels of microbial metabolites of aromatic amino acids (AAA), including indoxyl sulfate, phenylacetylglutamine, and hippuric acid, in urine. However, it did not affect the levels of AAA, as well as other microbial metabolites, including short-chain fatty acids and secondary bile acids, in feces. 16S rRNA gene sequencing indicated that the fecal microbiome was not significantly affected by chronic consumption of GTP. Overall, microbial metabolism is responsible for the formation of GTP metabolites while GTP metabolism may inhibit the formation of AAA metabolites from microbial metabolism. Because these GTP-derived and GTP-responsive metabolites have diverse bioactivities, microbial metabolism of GTP and AAA may play important roles in the beneficial health effects of green tea consumption in humans.",Experimental Verification of Isotropic and Anisotropic Anhysteretic Magnetization Models.,https://www.ncbi.nlm.nih.gov/pubmed/31083532,"Materials (Basel, Switzerland)",2019 06 10,"The anhysteretic magnetization curve is the key element of modeling magnetic hysteresis loops. Despite the fact that it is intensively exploited, known models of anhysteretic curve have not been verified experimentally. This paper presents the validation of four anhysteretic curve models considering four different materials, including isotropic, such as Mn-Zn soft ferrite, as well as anisotropic amorphous and nanocrystalline alloys. The presented results indicate that only the model that considers anisotropic energy is valid for a wide set of modern magnetic materials. The most suitable of the verified models is the anisotropic extension function-based model, which considers uniaxial anisotropy.",Estimated Burden of Serious Fungal Infections in Ghana.,https://www.ncbi.nlm.nih.gov/pubmed/31083531,"Journal of fungi (Basel, Switzerland)",2019 05 14,"Fungal infections are increasingly becoming common and yet often neglected in developing countries. Information on the burden of these infections is important for improved patient outcomes. The burden of serious fungal infections in Ghana is unknown. We aimed to estimate this burden. Using local, regional, or global data and estimates of population and at-risk groups, deterministic modelling was employed to estimate national incidence or prevalence. Our study revealed that about 4% of Ghanaians suffer from serious fungal infections yearly, with over 35,000 affected by life-threatening invasive fungal infections. Incidence of cryptococcal meningitis, Pneumocystis jirovecii pneumonia, and disseminated histoplasmosis cases in AIDS was estimated at 6275, 12,610 and 724, respectively. Oral and esophageal candidiasis collectively affect 27,100 Ghanaians and 42,653 adult asthmatics are estimated to have fungal asthma. We estimate a prevalence of 12,620 cases of chronic pulmonary aspergillosis (CPA and an incidence of 1254 cases of invasive aspergillosis (IA). Estimated cases of candidemia and candida peritonitis cases were 1446 and 217, respectively. The estimated prevalence of recurrent vulvovaginal candidiasis (RVVC) and tinea capitis was 442,621 and 598,840, respectively. Mucormycosis and fungal keratitis each may affect 58 and 810 Ghanaians. These data highlight the urgent need for intensified awareness to improve diagnosis and management.",Incomplete Healing as a Cause of Aging: The Role of Mitochondria and the Cell Danger Response.,https://www.ncbi.nlm.nih.gov/pubmed/31083530,Biology,2019 05 14,"The rate of biological aging varies cyclically and episodically in response to changing environmental conditions and the developmentally-controlled biological systems that sense and respond to those changes. Mitochondria and metabolism are fundamental regulators, and the cell is the fundamental unit of aging. However, aging occurs at all anatomical levels. At levels above the cell, aging in different tissues is qualitatively, quantitatively, and chronologically distinct. For example, the heart can age faster and differently than the kidney and vice versa. Two multicellular features of aging that are universal are: (1) a decrease in physiologic reserve capacity, and (2) a decline in the functional communication between cells and organ systems, leading to death. Decreases in reserve capacity and communication impose kinetic limits on the rate of healing after new injuries, resulting in dyssynchronous and incomplete healing. Exercise mitigates against these losses, but recovery times continue to increase with age. Reinjury before complete healing results in the stacking of incomplete cycles of healing. Developmentally delayed and arrested cells accumulate in the three stages of the cell danger response (CDR1, 2, and 3) that make up the healing cycle. Cells stuck in the CDR create physical and metabolic separation-buffer zones of reduced communication-between previously adjoining, synergistic, and metabolically interdependent cells. Mis-repairs and senescent cells accumulate, and repeated iterations of incomplete cycles of healing lead to progressively dysfunctional cellular mosaics in aging tissues. Metabolic cross-talk between mitochondria and the nucleus, and between neighboring and distant cells via signaling molecules called metabokines regulates the completeness of healing. Purinergic signaling and sphingolipids play key roles in this process. When viewed against the backdrop of the molecular features of the healing cycle, the incomplete healing model provides a new framework for understanding the hallmarks of aging and generates a number of testable hypotheses for new treatments.",Mitochondrial Dysfunction and the Aging Immune System.,https://www.ncbi.nlm.nih.gov/pubmed/31083529,Biology,2019 05 14,"Mitochondria are ancient organelles that have co-evolved with their cellular hosts, developing a mutually beneficial arrangement. In addition to making energy, mitochondria are multifaceted, being involved in heat production, calcium storage, apoptosis, cell signaling, biosynthesis, and aging. Many of these mitochondrial functions decline with age, and are the basis for many diseases of aging. Despite the vast amount of research dedicated to this subject, the relationship between aging mitochondria and immune function is largely absent from the literature. In this review, three main issues facing the aging immune system are discussed: (1) inflamm-aging; (2) susceptibility to infection and (3) declining T-cell function. These issues are re-evaluated using the lens of mitochondrial dysfunction with aging. With the recent expansion of numerous profiling technologies, there has been a resurgence of interest in the role of metabolism in immunity, with mitochondria taking center stage. Building upon this recent accumulation of knowledge in immunometabolism, this review will advance the hypothesis that the decline in immunity and associated pathologies are partially related to the natural progression of mitochondrial dysfunction with aging.",Electrical Stimulation of the Mesencephalic Locomotor Region Attenuates Neuronal Loss and Cytokine Expression in the Perifocal Region of Photothrombotic Stroke in Rats.,https://www.ncbi.nlm.nih.gov/pubmed/31083528,International journal of molecular sciences,2019 06 10,"Deep brain stimulation of the mesencephalic locomotor region (MLR) improves the motor symptoms in Parkinson's disease and experimental stroke by intervening in the motor cerebral network. Whether high-frequency stimulation (HFS) of the MLR is involved in non-motor processes, such as neuroprotection and inflammation in the area surrounding the photothrombotic lesion, has not been elucidated. This study evaluates whether MLR-HFS exerts an anti-apoptotic and anti-inflammatory effect on the border zone of cerebral photothrombotic stroke. Rats underwent photothrombotic stroke of the right sensorimotor cortex and the implantation of a microelectrode into the ipsilesional MLR. After intervention, either HFS or sham stimulation of the MLR was applied for 24 h. The infarct volumes were calculated from consecutive brain sections. Neuronal apoptosis was analyzed by TUNEL staining. Flow cytometry and immunohistochemistry determined the perilesional inflammatory response. Neuronal apoptosis was significantly reduced in the ischemic penumbra after MLR-HFS, whereas the infarct volumes did not differ between the groups. MLR-HFS significantly reduced the release of cytokines and chemokines within the ischemic penumbra. MLR-HFS is neuroprotective and it reduces pro-inflammatory mediators in the area that surrounds the photothrombotic stroke without changing the number of immune cells, which indicates that MLR-HFS enables the function of inflammatory cells to be altered on a molecular level.",Effects of Different TiO2 Particle Sizes on the Microstructure and Optical Limiting Properties of TiO2/Reduced Graphene Oxide Nanocomposites.,https://www.ncbi.nlm.nih.gov/pubmed/31083527,"Nanomaterials (Basel, Switzerland)",2019 05 14,"TiO2/reduced graphene oxide (rGO) nanocomposites with two different TiO2 particle sizes were synthesized by a facile hydrothermal method using two different source materials of Ti: tetrabutyl titanate (TBT) and commercial TiO2 powder (P25). For respective series with the same source materials, we investigated additions that optimized the nonlinear optical properties (NLO) and optical limiting (OL) performances, and we explored the relationships between structural diversity and performance. Several characterization techniques, including X-ray powder diffraction (XRD), X-ray photoelectron spectroscopy (XPS), transmission electron microscopy (TEM), Fourier-transform infrared spectroscopy (FTIR), Raman spectroscopy, and diffuse reflectance ultraviolet-visible spectroscopy (UV-Vis) were conducted to confirm the microstructures and chemical states of as-prepared materials. This indicated the existence of the Ti-O-C bond between rGO sheets and TiO2 particles and the reduction from precursor graphene oxide (GO) to rGO. The results of UV-Vis spectra revealed that the TiO2/rGO nanocomposites showed smaller band gaps than bare TiO2. A nanosecond open-aperture Z-scan technique at 1064 nm was applied to investigate NLO and OL properties. TiO2/rGO nanocomposites exhibited enhanced NLO and OL performances, arising from synergistic effects, compared to individual components. The TBT series samples performed better than the P25 series, presumably relevant to dimensional effects."

Unreliable measurements can lead to many disadvantages and even wrong decision-making. It is especially important for mature reservoirs as the gas volume fraction and water cut is increasing during the lifetime of a well. Hence, it is essential to accurately monitor the multi-phase flow of oil, water and gas inside the transportation pipelines. The objective of this review paper is to present the current trends and technologies within multi-phase flow measurements and to introduce the most promising methods based on parameters such as accuracy, footprint, safety, maintenance and calibration. Typical meters, such as tomography, gamma densitometry and virtual flow meters are described and compared based on their performance with respect to multi-phase flow measurements. Both experimental prototypes and commercial solutions are presented and evaluated. For a non-intrusive, non-invasive and inexpensive meter solution, this review paper predicts a progress for virtual flow meters in the near future. The application of multi-phase flows meters are expected to further expand in the future as fields are maturing, thus, efficient utilization of existing fields are in focus, to decide if a field is still financially profitable.",Interleukin-17F Has Anti-Tumor Effects in Oral Tongue Cancer.,https://www.ncbi.nlm.nih.gov/pubmed/31083515,Cancers,2019 05 14,"We recently showed that extracellular interleukin-17F (IL-17F) correlates with better disease-specific survival in oral tongue squamous cell carcinoma (OTSCC) patients. However, the underlying mechanisms of such effect remain obscure. Here, we used qRT-PCR to assess the expression of IL-17F and its receptors (IL-17RA and IL-17RC) in two OTSCC cell lines (HSC-3 and SCC-25) and in normal human oral keratinocytes (HOKs). IL-17F effects on cancer cell proliferation, migration, and invasion were studied using a live-imaging IncuCyte system, and a Caspase-3/7 reagent was used for testing apoptosis. 3D tumor spheroids were utilized to assess the impact of IL-17F on invasion with or without cancer-associated fibroblasts (CAFs). Tube-formation assays were used to examine the effects of IL-17F on angiogenesis using human umbilical vein endothelial cells (HUVEC). OTSCC cells express low levels of IL-17F, IL-17RA, and IL-17RC mRNA compared with HOKs. IL-17F inhibited cell proliferation and random migration of highly invasive HSC-3 cells. CAFs promoted OTSCC invasion in tumor spheroids, whereas IL-17F eliminated such effect. IL-17F suppressed HUVEC tube formation in a dose-dependent manner. Collectively, we suggest that IL-17F counteracts the pro-tumorigenic activity in OTSCC. Due to its downregulation in tumor cells and inhibitory activity in in vitro cancer models, targeting IL-17F or its regulatory pathways could lead to promising immunotherapeutic strategies against OTSCC.",The Validity of a Mixed Reality-Based Automated Functional Mobility Assessment.,https://www.ncbi.nlm.nih.gov/pubmed/31083514,"Sensors (Basel, Switzerland)",2019 06 10,"Functional mobility assessments (i.e., Timed Up and Go) are commonly used clinical tools for mobility and fall risk screening in older adults. In this work, we proposed a new Mixed Reality (MR)-based assessment that utilized a Microsoft HoloLensTM headset to automatically lead and track the performance of functional mobility tests, and subsequently evaluated its validity in comparison with reference inertial sensors. Twenty-two healthy adults (10 older and 12 young adults) participated in this study. An automated functional mobility assessment app was developed, based on the HoloLens platform. The mobility performance was recorded with the headset built-in sensor and reference inertial sensor (Opal, APDM) taped on the headset and lower back. The results indicate that the vertical kinematic measurements by HoloLens were in good agreement with the reference sensor (Normalized RMSE ~ 10%, except for cases where the inertial sensor drift correction was not viable). Additionally, the HoloLens-based test completion time was in perfect agreement with the clinical standard stopwatch measure. Overall, our preliminary investigation indicates that it is possible to use an MR headset to automatically guide users (without severe mobility deficit) to complete common mobility tests, and this approach has the potential to provide an objective and efficient sensor-based mobility assessment that does not require any direct research/clinical oversight.",Effects of Subcutaneous Ochratoxin-A Exposure on Immune System of Broiler Chicks.,https://www.ncbi.nlm.nih.gov/pubmed/31083513,Toxins,2019 05 14,"Ochratoxin A (OTA), an immunosuppressive mycotoxin, can increase the risk of many infectious diseases and contribute to economic losses to the poultry industry. The immunosuppressive effect has mainly been investigated through oral exposure; however, birds may also be contaminated through skin absorption. The present study investigated the influence of OTA exposure on the defense system of broiler chicks through the subcutaneous route and including low doses. Groups of broiler chicks (Cobb), 05 days old, were exposed to subcutaneous inoculation of OTA at concentrations of 0.1; 0.5; 0.9; 1.3; and 1.7 mg OTA/kg body weight. The size of the lymphoid organs, circulating immune cells, and total IgY and IgA levels were evaluated 21 days post inoculation. Subcutaneous OTA exposure decreased the weight of the thymus, spleen, and bursa of Fabricius, and leukocytopenia (p < 0.05) was detected in chicks of the OTA treated groups. In a dose-dependent way, decreased levels of circulating lymphocytes and heterophils (p < 0.05), and increased levels of monocytes (p < 0.05) were detected. Decreased IgY and IgA serum concentrations were noted in the OTA treated groups (p < 0.05). In conclusion, subcutaneous OTA exposure induces immunosuppression even at low levels.",Metabolomics Studies to Assess Biological Functions of Vitamin E Nicotinate.,https://www.ncbi.nlm.nih.gov/pubmed/31083512,"Antioxidants (Basel, Switzerland)",2019 05 14,"Vitamin E nicotinate (tocopherol nicotinate, tocopheryl nicotinate; TN) is an ester of two vitamins, tocopherol (vitamin E) and niacin (vitamin B3), in which niacin is linked to the hydroxyl group of active vitamin E. This vitamin E ester can be chemically synthesized and is used for supplementation. However, whether TN is formed in the biological system was unclear. Our laboratory previously detected TN in rat heart tissues, and its level was 30-fold lower in a failing heart (Wang et al., PLoS ONE2017, 12, e0176887). The rat diet used in these experiments contained vitamin E acetate (tocopherol acetate; TA) and niacin separately, but not in the form of TN. Since only TN, but not other forms of vitamin E, was decreased in heart failure, the TN structure may elicit biologic functions independent of serving as a source of active vitamin E antioxidant. To test this hypothesis, the present study performed metabolomics to compare effects of TN on cultured cells to those of TA plus niacin added separately (TA + N). Human vascular smooth muscle cells were treated with TN or with TA + N (100 Î¼M) for 10 min. Metabolite profiles showed that TN and TA + N influenced the cells differentially. TN effectively upregulated various primary fatty acid amides including arachidonoylethanoamine (anandamide/virodhamine) and palmitamide. TN also activated mitogen-activated protein kinases. These results suggest a new biological function of TN to elicit cell signaling.","Fungal Exocellular (1-6)-Î²-d-glucan: Carboxymethylation, Characterization, and Antioxidant Activity.",https://www.ncbi.nlm.nih.gov/pubmed/31083511,International journal of molecular sciences,2019 06 10,"Exocellular (1â6)-Î²-d-glucan (lasiodiplodan) produced by the fungus Lasiodiplodia theobromae MMPI was derivatized by carboxymethylation using different concentrations of a derivatizing agent. Lasiodiplodan was derivatized by carboxymethylation in an attempt to increase its solubility and enhance its biological activities. Carboxymethylglucans with degrees of substitution (DS) of 0.32, 0.47, 0.51, 0.58, and 0.68 were produced and characterized. FTIR analysis showed a band of strong intensity at 1600 cm-1 and an absorption band at 1421 cm-1, resulting from asymmetric and symmetrical stretching vibrations, respectively, of the carboxymethyl group COO- in the carboxymethylated samples. Thermal analysis showed that native lasiodiplodan (LN) and carboxymethylated derivatives (LC) exhibited thermal stability up to 200-210 Â°C. X-ray diffractometry demonstrated that both native and carboxymethylated lasiodiplodan presented predominantly an amorphous nature. Scanning electron microscopy revealed that carboxymethylation promoted morphological changes in the biopolymer and increased porosity, and alveolar structures were observed along the surface. The introduction of carboxymethyl groups in the macromolecule promoted increased solubility and potentiated the hydroxyl radical-scavenging activity, suggesting a correlation between degree of substitution and antioxidant activity.",Ethylene Glycol Dicyclopentenyl (Meth)Acrylate Homo and Block Copolymers via Nitroxide Mediated Polymerization.,https://www.ncbi.nlm.nih.gov/pubmed/31083510,"Materials (Basel, Switzerland)",2019 06 10,"Nitroxide-mediated polymerization (NMP), (homo and block copolymerization with styrene (S) and butyl methacrylate/S) of ethylene glycol dicyclopentenyl ether (meth)acrylates (EGDEA and EGDEMA) was studied using BlocBuilder alkoxyamines. EGDEA homopolymerization was not well-controlled, independent of temperature (90-120 Â°C), or additional free nitroxide (0-10 mol%) used. Number average molecular weights (Mn) achieved for poly(EGDEA) were 4.0-9.5 kg mol-1 and were accompanied by high dispersity (Ã = Mw/Mn = 1.62-2.09). Re-initiation and chain extension of the poly(EGDEA) chains with styrene (S) indicated some block copolymer formation, but a high fraction of chains were terminated irreversibly. EGDEA-stat-S statistical copolymerizations with a low mol fraction S in initial feed, fS,0 = 0.05, were slightly better controlled compared to poly(EGDEA) homopolymerizations (Ã was reduced to 1.44 compared to 1.62 at similar conditions). EGDEMA, in contrast, was successfully polymerized using a small fraction of S (fS,0 ~ 10 mol%) to high conversion (72%) to form well-defined EGDEMA-rich random copolymer (molar composition = FEGDEMA = 0.87) of Mn = 14.3 kg mol-1 and Ã = 1.38. EGDEMA-rich compositions were also polymerized with the unimolecular succinimidyl ester form of BlocBuilder initiator, NHS-BlocBuilder with similar results, although Ãs were higher ~1.6. Chain extensions resulted in monomodal shifts to higher molecular weights, indicating good chain end fidelity.","Hepatitis B Virus Molecular Epidemiology, Host-Virus Interaction, Coinfection, and Laboratory Diagnosis in the MENA Region: An Update.",https://www.ncbi.nlm.nih.gov/pubmed/31083509,"Pathogens (Basel, Switzerland)",2019 05 14,"Hepatitis B virus (HBV) is an enveloped partial double-stranded DNA virus that can cause acute and chronic hepatitis. According to the World Health Organization (WHO) and the Centers for Disease Control and Prevention (CDC), 257 million people are living with HBV. Moreover, 20,900 acute hepatitis B cases were reported in 2016. Hepatitis B is highly prevalent in the African, Western Pacific, Eastern Mediterranean, South-East Asia, and European regions, respectively. Due to the high mutational rate of HBV and lack of reverse transcriptase proofreading activity, ten different genotypes with different geographical distributions have been identified. HBV pathogenesis and severity of infection depend on several host and viral factors, particularly, the genetic variability of both the host and virus. Although HBV infection is a global health concern, there is a lack of adequate studies and reports in the Middle East and North Africa (MENA) region. Here, we provide a review on HBV epidemiology, pathogenesis, host-pathogen interactions, coinfection with selected viruses, and laboratory diagnosis, focusing on studies conducted in the MENA region to determine the current situation of the HBV infection and outline the future study areas.","Impact of Supplementary Amino Acids, Micronutrients, and Overall Diet on Glutathione Homeostasis.",https://www.ncbi.nlm.nih.gov/pubmed/31083508,Nutrients,2019 05 14,"Glutathione (GSH) is a critical endogenous antioxidant found in all eukaryotic cells. Higher GSH concentrations protect against cellular damage, tissue degeneration, and disease progression in various models, so there is considerable interest in developing interventions that augment GSH biosynthesis. Oral GSH supplementation is not the most efficient option due to the enzymatic degradation of ingested GSH within the intestine by Î³-glutamyltransferase, but supplementation of its component amino acids-cysteine, glycine, and glutamate-enhances tissue GSH synthesis. Furthermore, supplementation with some non-precursor amino acids and micronutrients appears to influence the redox status of GSH and related antioxidants, such as vitamins C and E, lowering systemic oxidative stress and slowing the rate of tissue deterioration. In this review, the effects of oral supplementation of amino acids and micronutrients on GSH metabolism are evaluated. And since specific dietary patterns and diets are being prescribed as first-line therapeutics for conditions such as hypertension and diabetes, the impact of overall diets on GSH homeostasis is also assessed.",Flavivirus Replication Organelle Biogenesis in the Endoplasmic Reticulum: Comparison with Other Single-Stranded Positive-Sense RNA Viruses.,https://www.ncbi.nlm.nih.gov/pubmed/31083507,International journal of molecular sciences,2019 06 10,"Some single-stranded positive-sense RNA [ssRNA(+)] viruses, including Flavivirus, generate specific organelle-like structures in the host endoplasmic reticulum (ER). These structures are called virus replication organelles and consist of two distinct subdomains, the vesicle packets (VPs) and the convoluted membranes (CMs). The VPs are clusters of small vesicle compartments and are considered to be the site of viral genome replication. The CMs are electron-dense amorphous structures observed in proximity to the VPs, but the exact roles of CMs are mostly unknown. Several recent studies have revealed that flaviviruses recruit several host factors that are usually used for the biogenesis of other conventional organelles and usurp their function to generate virus replication organelles. In the current review, we summarize recent studies focusing on the role of host factors in the formation of virus replication organelles and discuss how these intricate membrane structures are organized."

During development of a combination vaccine based on NoV virus-like particles (VLP) and RV VP6 produced in baculovirus expression system in insect cells, a dual role of VP6 as a vaccine antigen and an adjuvant for NoV-specific immune responses was discovered. Here the VP6 adjuvant effect on bivalent GI.4 and GII.4-2006a NoV VLPs produced in Nicotiana benthamiana was investigated. BALB/c mice were immunized intradermally with suboptimal (0.3 Âµg) dose of each NoV VLP alone or combined with 10 Âµg of VP6, or equal doses of NoV VLPs and VP6 (1 Âµg/antigen). NoV-specific serum IgG antibodies and their blocking activity were analyzed using vaccine-homologous and heterologous NoV VLPs. Immunization with 0.3 Âµg NoV VLPs alone was insufficient to induce NoV-specific immune responses, but with co-administration of 10 Âµg of VP6, antibodies against vaccine-derived and heterologous NoV genotypes were generated. Furthermore, corresponding adjuvant effect of VP6 was observed with 1 Âµg dose. Efficient uptake and presentation of VP6 by dendritic cells was demonstrated in vitro. These results show that adjuvant effect of VP6 on bivalent NoV VLP vaccine is independent of the cell source used for vaccine production.","Molecular Phylogenetic Relationships, Trichothecene Chemotype Diversity and Aggressiveness of Strains in a Global Collection of Fusarium graminearum Species.",https://www.ncbi.nlm.nih.gov/pubmed/31083494,Toxins,2019 05 14,"Fusarium head blight (FHB), caused principally by the species belonging to the Fusarium graminearum species complex (FGSC), is an important disease in wheat, barley, and other small grain crops worldwide. Grain infected with species in the FGSC may be contaminated with trichothecene mycotoxins such as deoxynivalenol (DON) and nivalenol (NIV). In this study, we characterized the phylogenetic relationships, chemotype diversity, phenotypic characters, and aggressiveness of 150 strains in FGSC collected from eight different countries. Phylogenetic analysis based on portions of translation elongation factor 1-Î± (EF-1Î±) gene from 150 strains revealed six species in the FGSC, F. graminearum s.s, F. asiaticum, F. meridionale, F. cortaderiae, F. boothii, and F. austroamericanum. In this collection, 50% of the strains were 15-acetyldeoxynivalenol (15-ADON), 35% were 3-acetyldeoxynivalenol (3-ADON) and 15% were NIV. Evaluation of strains on moderately resistant (MR) wheat cultivar Carberry indicated that there is no significant difference among the species for FHB disease severity (DS), fusarium damaged kernel percentage (FDK%) and DON production. However, significant differences were observed among the chemotypes. Results showed significantly higher FHB DS, FDK%, DON production, growth rates, and macroconidia production for the 3-ADON strains than the 15-ADON and NIV strains. In addition, significant differences for FHB response variables were observed among the strains from different countries. Our results demonstrate that type and amount of trichothecene produced by a strain play a key role in determining the level of aggressiveness of that particular strain, regardless of the species.",Hypersonic Aerodynamic Force Balance Using Micromachined All-Fiber Fabryâ»PÃ©rot Interferometric Strain Gauges.,https://www.ncbi.nlm.nih.gov/pubmed/31083493,Micromachines,2019 05 14,"This paper presents high-sensitivity, micromachined all-fiber Fabry-PÃ©rot interferometric (FFPI) strain gauges and their integration in a force balance for hypersonic aerodynamic measurements. The FFPI strain gauge has a short Fabry-PÃ©rot cavity fabricated using an excimer laser etching process, and the deformation of the cavity is detected by a white-light optical phase demodulator. A three-component force balance, using the proposed FFPI gauges as sensing elements, was fabricated, calibrated, and experimentally evaluated. To reduce thermal output of the balance, a simple and effective self-temperature compensation solution, without external temperature sensors, is proposed and examined through both oven heating and wind tunnel runs. As a result of this approach, researchers are able to use the balance continuously throughout a wide range of temperatures. During preliminary testing in a hypersonic wind tunnel with a free stream Mach number of 12, the measurement accuracies of the balance were clearly improved after applying the temperature self-compensation.",Isolation and Characterization of Two New Metabolites from the Sponge-Derived Fungus Aspergillus sp.

LS34, using two different media including solid rice medium and potato dextrose broth (PDB) resulted in the isolation and identification of two new compounds, named asperspin A (1) and asperther A (2) along with seven known compounds 3-9. Compounds 1-5 were detected in fungal extracts from rice medium, while compounds 6-9 were isolated from PDB medium. Their structures were unambiguously characterized by HRESIMS and NMR spectroscopic data. The growth inhibitory activity of these compounds against four pathogenic bacteria (Vibrio parahaemolyticus, Vibrio harveyi, Escherichia coli, and Staphylococcus aureus) were evaluated. All the compounds were also tested for their cytotoxicity against seven cancer cell lines, including CCRF-CEM, K562, BGC823, AGS, HCT-116, MDA-MB-453, and COR-L23. Among them, compound 9 showed strong activity against CCRF-CEM and K562 cells with IC50 values of 1.22 Â± 0.05 ÂµM and 10.58 Â± 0.19 ÂµM, respectively.

A large gap exists in disseminating patient-centered research results to older adult patient end-users. We sought to examine the experiences of patient/community partners in disseminating PCOR results and characterize lessons learned that may facilitate future researcher-patient/community dissemination partnerships. Methods: Patient/community partners who participated in geriatrics-focused PCORI-funded research and were active in disseminating results, as part of their planned activities, were recruited for one-to-one qualitative interviews. Constant comparative and thematic analysis were used to identify and describe common themes that emerged in a survey of open-ended questions. Results: Ten individuals (four community partners, six patients) aged 55-87 years were interviewed. Analysis revealed that for successful dissemination, subjects felt it was vital to reach out to people affected by the results, leverage personal stories, and tap into pre-developed programming. Patient/Community partners identified potential audiences through word-of-mouth, community requests, and mapping a list of audiences-targeting those directly affected as well as those who worked with the audience (e.g., not specifically medical). Patient/community partners recommended that researchers engage patient/community partners for suggestions on audiences, show empathy, include diverse populations, and maintain a community-focus. One community partner stated, ""Why wouldn't we help disseminate results? It's a no-brainer. We know people!"" Conclusion: Patient/community partners provide effective ways to communicate results, new audiences to reach, improved communication with different audiences, and improved credibility of the findings. The lessons learned have implications for assisting future research-patient/community partnerships in the dissemination of their patient-centered research.",Strategies to Interfere with Tumor Metabolism through the Interplay of Innate and Adaptive Immunity.,https://www.ncbi.nlm.nih.gov/pubmed/31083487,Cells,2019 05 14,"The inflammatory tumor microenvironment is an important regulator of carcinogenesis. Tumor-infiltrating immune cells promote each step of tumor development, exerting crucial functions from initiation, early neovascularization, to metastasis. During tumor outgrowth, tumor-associated immune cells, including myeloid cells and lymphocytes, acquire a tumor-supportive, anti-inflammatory phenotype due to their interaction with tumor cells. Microenvironmental cues such as inflammation and hypoxia are mainly responsible for creating a tumor-supportive niche. Moreover, it is becoming apparent that the availability of iron within the tumor not only affects tumor growth and survival, but also the polarization of infiltrating immune cells. The interaction of tumor cells and infiltrating immune cells is multifaceted and complex, finally leading to different activation phenotypes of infiltrating immune cells regarding their functional heterogeneity and plasticity. In recent years, it was discovered that these phenotypes are mainly implicated in defining tumor outcome. Here, we discuss the role of the metabolic activation of both tumor cells and infiltrating immune cells in order to adapt their metabolism during tumor growth. Additionally, we address the role of iron availability and the hypoxic conditioning of the tumor with regard to tumor growth and we describe the relevance of therapeutic strategies to target such metabolic characteristics.","Outcome Definition Influences the Relationship Between Genetic Polymorphisms of ERCC1, ERCC2, SLC22A2 and Cisplatin Nephrotoxicity in Adult Testicular Cancer Patients.",https://www.ncbi.nlm.nih.gov/pubmed/31083486,Genes,2019 05 14,"Although previous research identified candidate genetic polymorphisms associated with cisplatin nephrotoxicity, varying outcome definitions potentially contributed to the variability in the effect size and direction of this relationship. We selected genetic variants that have been significantly associated with cisplatin-induced nephrotoxicity in more than one published study (SLC22A2 rs316019; ERCC1 rs11615 and rs3212986; ERCC2 rs1799793 and rs13181) and performed a replication analysis to confirm associations between these genetic polymorphisms and cisplatin nephrotoxicity using various outcome definitions. We included 282 germ cell testicular cancer patients treated with cisplatin from 2009-2014, aged >17 years recruited by the Canadian Pharmacogenomics Network for Drug Safety. Nephrotoxicity was defined using four grading tools: (1) Common Terminology Criteria for Adverse Events (CTCAE) v4.03 for acute kidney injury (AKI) or CTCAE-AKI; (2) adjusted cisplatin-induced AKI; (3) elevation of serum creatinine; and (4) reduction in the estimated glomerular filtration rate (eGFR). Significant associations were only found when using the CTCAE v4.03 definition: genotype CA of the ERCC1 rs3212986 was associated with decreased risk of cisplatin nephrotoxicity (ORadj = 0.24; 95% CI:0.08-0.70; p= 0.009) compared to genotype CC. In contrast, addition of allele A at SLC22A2 rs316019 was associated with increased risk (ORadj = 4.41; 95% CI:1.96-9.88; p < 0.001) while genotype AC was associated with a higher risk of cisplatin nephrotoxicity (ORadj = 5.06; 95% CI:1.69-15.16; p= 0.004) compared to genotype CC. Our study showed that different case definitions led to variability in the genetic risk ascertainment of cisplatin nephrotoxicity. Therefore, consensus on a set of clinically relevant outcome definitions that all such studies should follow is needed.",Prediction of Chronic Atrophic Gastritis and Gastric Neoplasms by Serum Pepsinogen Assay: A Systematic Review and Meta-Analysis of Diagnostic Test Accuracy.,https://www.ncbi.nlm.nih.gov/pubmed/31083485,Journal of clinical medicine,2019 05 14,"Serum pepsinogen assay (sPGA), which reveals serum pepsinogen (PG) I concentration and the PG I/PG II ratio, is a non-invasive test for predicting chronic atrophic gastritis (CAG) and gastric neoplasms. Although various cut-off values have been suggested, PG I â¤70 ng/mL and a PG I/PG II ratio of â¤3 have been proposed. However, previous meta-analyses reported insufficient systematic reviews and only pooled outcomes, which cannot determine the diagnostic validity of sPGA with a cut-off value of PG I â¤70 ng/mL and/or PG I/PG II ratio â¤3. We searched the core databases (MEDLINE, Cochrane Library, and Embase) from their inception to April 2018. Fourteen and 43 studies were identified and analyzed for the diagnostic performance in CAG and gastric neoplasms, respectively. Values for sensitivity, specificity, diagnostic odds ratio, and area under the curve with a cut-off value of PG I â¤70 ng/mL and PG I/PG II ratio â¤3 to diagnose CAG were 0.59, 0.89, 12, and 0.81, respectively and for diagnosis of gastric cancer (GC) these values were 0.59, 0.73, 4, and 0.7, respectively. Methodological quality and ethnicity of enrolled studies were found to be the reason for the heterogeneity in CAG diagnosis. Considering the high specificity, non-invasiveness, and easily interpretable characteristics, sPGA has potential for screening of CAG or GC.",Raspberry as a Source for the Development of Drosophila suzukii Attractants: Laboratory and Commercial Polytunnel Trials.,https://www.ncbi.nlm.nih.gov/pubmed/31083484,Insects,2019 05 14,"Several commercial products and home-made attractants have been developed for monitoring and mass-trapping of the spotted wing drosophila, Drosophila suzukii. Growers in Mexico have adopted an attractant based on a fermenting mixture of raspberry pulp and sucrose, with anecdotally promising results. We compared the capture rates of traps baited with raspberry pulp + sucrose with captures from a range of alternative attractants. Raspberry pulp alone or with sucrose was more attractive than apple cider vinegar (ACV) or SuzukiiTrap and similar to baker's yeast + sucrose in laboratory cage studies. Synthetic raspberry aroma (0.1-10% concentration), in water or mixed with ACV, did not improve capture rates in the laboratory. Traps baited with raspberry + sucrose or ACV had similar captures of D. suzukii in raspberry or blackberry polytunnels in MichoacÃ¡n, Mexico. Raspberry + sucrose baited traps captured significantly higher numbers of other drosophilid species, leading to higher total numbers of captured flies (all species), which may explain why Mexican growers favor the raspberry-based attractant. The commercial products SuzukiiTrap and Z-Kinol had lower captures than ACV in polytunnels, although SuzukiiTrap had the highest selectivity in captures of D. suzukii (81% of flies captured). A two-component trap (2C trap) baited with ACV + ethanol as the drowning solution and raspberry pulp + sucrose or baker's yeast + sucrose in a ventilated tube device was markedly more effective than the trap currently used by growers. We conclude that raspberry pulp + sucrose is as effective for the attraction of D. suzukii as ACV under commercial polytunnel conditions. The 2C trap performed better than the transparent cup trap currently used by berry producers in Mexico."

Al-Cu composite powders were fabricated through a ball milling process, and the effect of the Cu content was investigated. Composite materials composed of Al-20Cu, Al-50Cu, and Al-80Cu (vol.%) were sintered by a spark plasma sintering process, which was carried out at 520 Â°C and 50 MPa for 5 min. The phase analysis of the composite materials by X-ray diffraction (XRD) and energy-dispersive spectroscopy (EDS) indicated that intermetallic compounds (IC) such as CuAl2 and Cu9Al4 were formed through reactions between Cu and Al during the spark plasma sintering process. The mechanical properties of the composites were analysed using a Vickers hardness tester. The Al-50Cu composite had a hardness of approximately 151 HV, which is higher than that of the other composites. The thermal conductivity of the composite materials was measured by laser flash analysis, and the highest value was obtained for the Al-80Cu composite material. This suggests that the Cu content affects physical properties of the Al-Cu composite material as well as the amount of intermetallic compounds formed in the composite material.",Beneficial Effect of Exercise on Cognitive Function during Peripheral Arterial Disease: Potential Involvement of Myokines and Microglial Anti-Inflammatory Phenotype Enhancement.,https://www.ncbi.nlm.nih.gov/pubmed/31083472,Journal of clinical medicine,2019 05 14,"Peripheral arterial disease (PAD), leading to intermittent claudication, critical ischemia with rest pain, and/or tissue damage, is a public health issue associated with significant morbidity and mortality. Little is known about the link between PAD, cognitive function, and whether exercise might reduce cognitive dysfunction in PAD patients, as previously observed concerning both quality of life and prognosis. This review highlights the fact that patients suffering from PAD often demonstrate cognitive dysfunction characterized by reduced performance in nonverbal reasoning, reduced verbal ï¬uency, and decreased information processing speed and a greater risk for progression toward dementia. Further, the data presented support that physical exercise, likely through myokine secretion and microglial anti-inflammatory phenotype enhancement, might participate in the cognition protection in common clinical settings.",Study on the Emulsifying Properties of Pomegranate Peel Pectin from Different Cultivation Areas.,https://www.ncbi.nlm.nih.gov/pubmed/31083471,"Molecules (Basel, Switzerland)",2019 06 10,"Pomegranate peel pectin is an important acidic anionic plant polysaccharide which can be used as a natural emulsifier. In order to study its emulsifying properties, this paper systematically analyses pomegranate peel pectin samples from Chinese Xinjiang, Sichuan and Yunnan provinces, through rheometer, interfacial rheometer, Zetasizer Nano-ZS and mastersizer. It is shown that pomegranate peel pectin can effectively reduce the oil-water interfacial tension, reaching an emulsion droplet size of only 0.507 Î¼m, 0.669 Î¼m and 0.569 Î¼m, respectively, while the pectin concentration is 1.5% and the oil phase (MCT) is 10%. It has also shown that the extreme conditions of pH and ion strength can not significantly change its emulsion stability. However, freeze-thaw cycles can cause the pomegranate peel pectin emulsion to become less stable. Furthermore, the effects of decolourization, protein removal and dialysis on the emulsifying properties of pomegranate peel pectin are investigated using mastersizer rheometer and interfacial rheometer. It is found that the protein and pigment in pomegranate peel pectin have little effect on its emulsifying properties, while the results from dialyzed pectin show that the small molecule substances can reduce the emulsion particle size and increase the emulsion stability. The research outcomes of this study provide technical support for the further application of pomegranate peel pectin in the food industry.",An Inverse Approach of Damage Identification Using Lamb Wave Tomography.,https://www.ncbi.nlm.nih.gov/pubmed/31083470,"Sensors (Basel, Switzerland)",2019 06 10,"A pulse laser combined LWT technique with a two-stage reconstruction algorithm was proposed to realize rapid damage location, or even the evaluation of damage size for plate-like structures. Since the amplitude of Lamb waves in propagation is highly sensitive to damage, including inside damage, the change of the attenuation coefficient of Lamb waves in the inspection region was used as a damage index to reconstruct damage images. In stage one, the rough area of the damage was identified by a comparison of the amplitude of the testing signal data and reference data (undamaged state). In stage two, the damage image was reconstructed using an inverse approach based on the least-square method. In order to verify the effectiveness of the proposed rapid approach, experiments on an aluminum plate with a non-penetrating notch and a carbon fiber-reinforced plastic laminated plate with internal delamination induced by a low-velocity impact were carried out. The results show that the notch can be detected with accurate location, and the delamination image can be reconstructed successfully.","High-Performance Work System, Work Well-Being, and Employee Creativity: Cross-Level Moderating Role of Transformational Leadership.",https://www.ncbi.nlm.nih.gov/pubmed/31083469,International journal of environmental research and public health,2019 06 10,"Under the new normal, the economic development mode and growth momentum of China has brought about fundamental changes, which means that the development of enterprises has gradually shifted from being factor-and investment-driven to being innovation-and talent-driven. As the foundation of corporate innovation, employee creativity plays an important role in this process. In the field of strategic human resource management, high-performance work system is the embodiment of its core competence. Although some research has begun to try to explore the impact of high-performance work system on employee creativity, the underlying mechanism and the boundary condition is not yet fully understood. According to the Job demands-resources (JD-R) model, this study theorized and examined whether and when high-performance work system stimulate employee creativity. Using a sample of large and medium-sized enterprises in China, we collected data, which are time-lagged and multilevel, from 266 employees in 61 departments. Results of the hierarchical linear model found that (1) High-performance work system is positively related to employee creativity; (2) High-performance work system positively affects employee work well-being; (3) Work well-being positively affects employee creativity; (4) Employee work well-being partially mediates the relationship between high-performance work system and creativity; (5) Transformational leadership, which represents an important contextual variable in the workplace, moderates the relationship between work well-being and employee creativity; (6) Moreover, we have also revealed that transformational leadership can moderate the indirect effect of high-performance work system on employee creativity. We discussed the theoretical and practical implications of these findings.",Reliability-Based Low Fatigue Life Analysis of Turbine Blisk with Generalized Regression Extreme Neural Network Method.,https://www.ncbi.nlm.nih.gov/pubmed/31083468,"Materials (Basel, Switzerland)",2019 06 10,"Turbine blisk low cycle fatigue (LCF) is affected by various factors such as heat load, structural load, operation parameters and material parameters; it seriously influences the reliability and performance of the blisk and aeroengine. To study the influence of thermal-structural coupling on the reliability of blisk LCF life, the generalized regression extreme neural network (GRENN) method was proposed by integrating the basic thoughts of generalized regression neural network (GRNN) and the extreme response surface method (ERSM). The mathematical model of the developed GRENN method was first established in respect of the LCF life model and the ERSM model. The method and procedure for reliability and sensitivity analysis based on the GRENN model were discussed. Next, the reliability and sensitivity analyses of blisk LCF life were performed utilizing the GRENN method under a thermal-structural interaction by regarding the randomness of gas temperature, rotation speed, material parameters, LCF performance parameters and the minimum fatigue life point of the objective of study. The analytical results reveal that the reliability degree was 0.99848 and the fatigue life is 9419 cycles for blisk LCF life when the allowable value is 6000 cycles so that the blisk has some life margin relative to 4500 cycles in the deterministic analysis. In comparison with ERSM, the computing time and precision of the proposed GRENN under 10,000 simulations is 1.311 s and 99.95%. This is improved by 15.18% in computational efficiency and 1.39% in accuracy, respectively. Moreover, high efficiency and high precision of the developed GRENN become more obvious with the increasing number of simulations. In light of the sensitivity analysis, the fatigue ductility index and temperature are the key factors of determining blisk LCF life because their effect probabilities reach 41% and 26%, respectively. Material density, rotor speed, the fatigue ductility coefficient, the fatigue strength coefficient and the fatigue ductility index are also significant parameters for LCF life. Poisson's ratio and elastic modulus of materials have little effect. The efforts of this paper validate the feasibility and validity of GRENN in the reliability analysis of blisk LCF life and give the influence degrees of various random parameters on blisk LCF life, which are promising to provide useful insights for the probabilistic optimization of turbine blisk LCF life.",Biocidal Effectiveness of Selected Disinfectants Solutions Based on Water and Ozonated Water against Listeria monocytogenes Strains.,https://www.ncbi.nlm.nih.gov/pubmed/31083467,Microorganisms,2019 05 14,"The aim of this study was to compare the biocidal effectiveness of disinfectants solutions prepared with ozonated and non-ozonated water against Listeria monocytogenes. Six L. monocytogenes strains were the research material (four isolates from food: meat (LMO-M), dairy products (LMO-N), vegetables (LMO-W), and fish (LMO-R); one clinical strain (LMO-K) and reference strain ATCC 19111). The evaluation of the biocidal effectiveness of disinfectant solutions (QAC-quaternary ammonium compounds; OA-oxidizing agents; ChC-chlorine compounds; IC-iodine compounds; NANO-nanoparticles) was carried out, marking the MBC values. Based on the obtained results, the effectiveness coefficient (A) were calculated. The smaller the A value, the greater the efficiency of disinfection solutions prepared on the basis of ozonated versus non-ozonated water. Ozonated water showed biocidal efficacy against L. monocytogenes. Among tested disinfectentants, independent on type of water used for preparation, the most effective against L. monocytogenes were: QAC 1 (benzyl-C12-18-alkydimethyl ammonium chlorides) (1.00 Ã 10-5-1.00 Ã 10-4 g/mL) in quaternary ammonium compounds, OA 3 (peracetic acid, hydrogen peroxide, bis (sulphate) bis (peroxymonosulfate)) (3.08 Ã 10-4 -3.70 Ã 10-3 g/mL) in oxidizing agents, ChC 1 (chlorine dioxide) (5.00 Ã 10-8 -7.00 Ã 10-7 g/mL) in chlorine compounds, IC 1 (iodine) (1.05-2.15 g/mL) in iodine compounds, and NANO 1 (nanocopper) (1.08 Ã 10-4 - 1.47 Ã 10-4 g/mL) in nanoparticles. The values of the activity coefficient for QAC ranged from 0.10 to 0.40, for OA-0.15-0.84, for ChC-0.25-0.83, for IC-0.45-0.60, and for NANO-0.70-0.84. The preparation of disinfectants solution on the basis of ozonated water, improved the microbicidal efficiency of the tested disinfectant, especially the quaternary ammonium compounds. An innovative element of our work is the use of ozonated water for the preparation of working solutions of the disinfection agents. Use ozonated water can help to reduce the use of disinfectant concentrations and limit the increasing of microbial resistance to disinfectants. This paper provides many new information to optimize hygiene plans in food processing plants and limit the spread of microorganisms such as L. monocytogenes.",Physiological Adaptation to Simultaneous Chronic Exposure to High-Fat Diet and Dichlorodipheniletylhene (DDE) in Wistar Rat Testis.,https://www.ncbi.nlm.nih.gov/pubmed/31083466,Cells,2019 05 14,"Environmental chemicals can be introduced by consuming contaminated foods. The environmental chemical dichlorodiphenyldichloroethylene (DDE), a persistent metabolite of dichlorodiphenyltrichloroethane (DDT), can affect spermatogenesis. Our study aims to evaluate, by using spectrophotometric analyses, western blot, and immunohistochemistry, the adaptive responses in testis of adult rats treated with a non-toxic dose of DDE, alone or in association with a high-fat diet (HFD). Four experimental groups were performed: N (normal diet); D (HFD); D + DDE (HFD + DDE); N + DDE (normal diet + DDE). D group showed a reduction in antioxidant capacity, and increases in lipid peroxidation, apoptosis, and proliferation associated with morphological impairment. A reduction in androgen receptor (AR) and serum testosterone levels were also found. DDE-treated groups exhibited higher lipid peroxidation levels compared to N and D, associated with pronounced defect in antioxidant capacity, apoptosis, cellular proliferation, as well as with tissue damage. Moreover, decreases in AR and serum testosterone levels were found in DDE-treated groups vs. N and D. In conclusion, HFD and DDE produced cellular stress leading to antioxidant impairment, apoptosis, and decreases in AR and serum testosterone levels associated with tissue damage. Cellular proliferation could be used as an adaptation to counterbalance the occurred damage, maintaining a pool of tubules that follow physiological maturation.",Effect of AuPd Bimetal Sensitization on Gas Sensing Performance of Nanocrystalline SnO2 Obtained by Single Step Flame Spray Pyrolysis.,https://www.ncbi.nlm.nih.gov/pubmed/31083465,"Nanomaterials (Basel, Switzerland)",2019 05 14,"Improvement of sensitivity, lower detection limits, stability and reproducibility of semiconductor metal oxide gas sensor characteristics are required for their application in the fields of ecological monitoring, industrial safety, public security, express medical diagnostics, etc. Facile and scalable single step flame spray pyrolysis (FSP) synthesis of bimetal AuPd sensitized nanocrystalline SnO2 is reported. The materials chemical composition, structure and morphology has been studied by XRD, XPS, HAADFSTEM, BET, ICP-MS techniques. Thermo-programmed reduction with hydrogen (TPR-H2) has been used for materials chemical reactivity characterization. Superior gas sensor response of bimetallic modified SnO2 towards wide concentration range of reducing (CO, CH4, C3H8, H2S, NH3) and oxidizing (NO2) gases compared to pure and monometallic modified SnO2 is reported for dry and humid gas detection conditions. The combination of facilitated oxygen molecule spillover on gold particles and electronic effect of Fermi level control by reoxidizing Pd-PdO clusters on SnO2 surface is proposed to give rise to the observed enhanced gas sensor performance.",A Missense Variant in SCN8A in Alpine Dachsbracke Dogs Affected by Spinocerebellar Ataxia.,https://www.ncbi.nlm.nih.gov/pubmed/31083464,Genes,2019 05 14,"Spinocerebellar ataxias is an umbrella term for clinically- and neuropathologically-heterogeneous early-onset hereditary neurodegenerative diseases affecting several dog breeds. The purpose of this study is to identify the causative genetic variant associated with ataxia, tremor, and loss of balance in Alpine Dachsbracke dogs. We investigated two related litters in which four cases were reported. Neuropathology of two dogs revealed spongy degeneration associated with axonal degeneration. Combined genetic linkage and autozygosity analyses in four cases and eight related controls showed one critical disease-associated interval on chromosomes 27. Private whole-genome sequence variants of one ataxia case against 600 unrelated controls revealed one protein-changing variant within the critical interval in the SCN8A gene (c.4898G>T; p.Gly1633Val). Perfect segregation with the phenotype was confirmed by genotyping >200 Alpine Dachsbracke dogs. SCN8A encodes a voltage-gated sodium channel and the missense variant was predicted deleterious by three different in silico prediction tools. Pathogenic variants in SCN8A were previously reported in humans with ataxia, pancerebellar atrophy, and cognitive disability. Furthermore, cerebellar ataxia syndrome in the 'jolting' mutant mice is caused by a missense variant in Scn8a. Therefore, we considered the SCN8A:c.4898G>T variant to be the most likely cause for recessively inherited spinocerebellar ataxia in Alpine Dachsbracke dogs."

In this work, we have examined the influence of pharmaceutical excipients on drug bioavailability in males and females. Using a rat model, we report that a portfolio of polyoxyethylated solubilising excipients (polyethylene glycol 2000, Cremophor RH 40, Poloxamer 188 and Tween 80) increase ranitidine bioavailability in males but not in females. The in vivo sex and excipient effects were reflected in vitro in intestinal permeability experiments using an Ussing chamber system. The mechanism of such an effect on drug bioavailability is suggested to be due to the interaction between the excipients and the efflux membrane transporter P-glycoprotein (P-gp), whose expression in terms of gene and protein levels were inhibited by the solubilising agents in male but not in female rats. In contrast, the non-polyoxyethylated excipient, Span 20, significantly increased ranitidine bioavailability in both males and females in a non-sex-dependent manner. These findings have significant implications for the use of polyoxyethylated solubilising excipients in drug formulation in light of their sex-specific modulation on the bioavailability of drugs that are P-gp substrates. As such, pharmaceutical research is required to retract from a 'one size fits all' approach and to, instead, evaluate the potential impact of the interplay between excipients and sex on drug effect to ensure effective pharmacotherapy.",Members of the Lactobacillus Genus Complex (LGC) as Opportunistic Pathogens: A Review.,https://www.ncbi.nlm.nih.gov/pubmed/31083452,Microorganisms,2019 05 14,"Microorganisms belonging to the Lactobacillus genus complex (LGC) are naturally associated or deliberately added to fermented food products and are widely used as probiotic food supplements. Moreover, these bacteria normally colonize the mouth, gastrointestinal (GI) tract, and female genitourinary tract of humans. They exert multiple beneficial effects and are regarded as safe microorganisms. However, infections caused by lactobacilli, mainly endocarditis, bacteremia, and pleuropneumonia, occasionally occur. The relevance of Lactobacillus spp. and other members of the LGC as opportunistic pathogens in humans and related risk factors and predisposing conditions are illustrated in this review article with more emphasis on the species L. rhamnosus that has been more often involved in infection cases. The methods used to identify this species in clinical samples, to distinguish strains and to evaluate traits that can be associated to pathogenicity, as well as future perspectives for improving the identification of potentially pathogenic strains, are outlined.","Hepatobiliary Events in Migraine Therapy with Herbs-The Case of Petadolex, A Petasites Hybridus Extract.",https://www.ncbi.nlm.nih.gov/pubmed/31083451,Journal of clinical medicine,2019 05 14,"PetadolexÂ®, a defined butterbur extract has clinically proven efficacy against migraine attacks. However, spontaneous reports indicate cases of herbal induced liver injury (HILI). While most HILI patients presented mild serum biochemistry changes (<3 ULN, dose range 50 to 225 mg/day; treatment duration 4-730 days) nine developed severe HILI (average time-to-onset 103 days, ALT-range 3-153; AST 2-104-fold ULN). HILI cases resolved after medication withdrawal though two patients required liver transplantation. Liver biopsies revealed an inconsistent injury pattern, i.e. necrosis, macrovesicular steatosis, inflammation, cholestasis, and bile duct proliferation. Causality assessment rated 3 cases likely, 13 possible, 8 unlikely and 24 as unclassifiable/unclassified. Note, 22 patients reported hepatotoxic co-medications especially during periods of pain. A no-observable-adverse-effect-level at 15-fold of the maximal clinical dose (3 mg/kg/day MCD) was established for rats. At >45 and 90-fold MCD bile duct hyperplasia was observed but could not be confirmed in an explorative minipig study at 218-fold MCD. Human hepatocyte studies at 49-fold Cmax serum petasins (=active ingredient) and therapeutic Ibuprofen, Paracetamol and Naratriptan concentrations evidenced liver transaminase and CYP-monooxygenase changes. Collectively, PetadolexÂ® HILI cases are rare, idiosyncratic and frequently confounded by co-medications. A physician-supervised self-medication plan with herbs and pain relief medication is needed to minimize risk for HILI.","Effects of Different Types of Water and Nitrogen Fertilizer Management on Greenhouse Gas Emissions, Yield, and Water Consumption of Paddy Fields in Cold Region of China.",https://www.ncbi.nlm.nih.gov/pubmed/31083450,International journal of environmental research and public health,2019 06 10,"Water management and nitrogen (N) fertilizers are the two main driving factors of greenhouse gas emissions. In this paper, two irrigation modes, controlled irrigation (CI) and flood irrigation (FI), and four nitrogen fertilizer levels (N0: 0, N1:,85, N2:,110, and N3:,135 kgÂ·hm-2) were set to study the effect of different irrigation modes and N fertilizer amount on greenhouse-gas emissions of paddy fields in cold region by using the static chamber-gas chromatograph method; yield and water consumption were also analyzed. The results showed that, compared with FI, CI significantly reduced CH4 emissions by 19.42~46.94%, but increased N2O emissions by 5.66~11.85%. Under the two irrigation modes, N fertilizers could significantly increase N2O emissions, but the CH4 emissions of each N treatment showed few differences. Compared with FI, appropriate N application under CI could significantly increase grain number per spike, seed-setting rate, and 1000-grain weight, thus increasing yield. Under the two irrigation modes, water consumption increased with the increase of N application rate, and the total water consumption of CI was significantly lower than that of FI. The global warming potential (GWP) of CI was significantly smaller than that of FI. The trend of GWP in each treatment was similar to that of CH4. Through comprehensive comparison and analysis of water productivity (WP), gas emission intensity (GHGI), and the yield of each treatment, we found that CI+N2 treatment had the highest WP (2.05 kgÂ·m-3) and lowest GHGI (0.37 kg CO2-eqÂ·kg-1), while maintaining high yield (10224.4 kgÂ·hm-2). The results of this study provide an important basis for guiding high yield, water-savings, and emission reduction of paddy fields in cold regions.",GCâ»MS-Based Nontargeted and Targeted Metabolic Profiling Identifies Changes in the Lentinula edodes Mycelial Metabolome under High-Temperature Stress.,https://www.ncbi.nlm.nih.gov/pubmed/31083449,International journal of molecular sciences,2019 06 10,"To clarify the physiological mechanism of the Lentinula edodes (L. edodes) response to high-temperature stress, two strains of L. edodes with different tolerances were tested at different durations of high temperature, and the results showed that there were significant changes in their phenotypes and physiology. To further explore the response mechanism, we established a targeted GC-MS-based metabolomics workflow comprising a standardized experimental setup for growth, treatment and sampling of L. edodes mycelia, and subsequent GC-MS analysis followed by data processing and evaluation of quality control (QC) measures using tailored statistical and bioinformatic tools. This study identified changes in the L. edodes mycelial metabolome following different time treatments at high temperature based on nontargeted metabolites with GC-MS and further adopted targeted metabolomics to verify the results of the analysis. After multiple statistical analyses were carried out using SIMCA software, 74 and 108 differential metabolites were obtained, respectively. Kyoto Encyclopedia of Genes and Genomes (KEGG) analysis showed that the metabolic pathways with significant changes included those related to the following: amino acid metabolism, the glycolysis pathway, the tricarboxylic acid (TCA) cycle, and sugar metabolism. Most amino acids and carbohydrates enriched in these metabolic pathways were upregulated in strain 18, downregulated in strain 18N44, or the synthesis in strain 18 was higher than that in strain 18N44. This result was consistent with the physiological phenotypic characteristics of the two strains under high-temperature stress and revealed the reason why strain 18N44 was more heat-sensitive. At the same time, under high temperature, the decrease of intermediate products in glycolysis and the TCA cycle resulted in carbon starvation and insufficient energy metabolism, thus inhibiting the growth of L. edodes. In addition, the results also showed that the metabolites produced by different L. edodes strains under high-temperature stress were basically the same. However, different strains had species specificity, so the changes in the content of metabolites involved in the response to high-temperature stress were different. This provides a theoretical basis for further understanding the mechanism of the L. edodes response to high temperature and can be used to establish an evaluation system of high-temperature-resistant strains and lay the foundation for molecular breeding of new L. edodes strains resistant to high temperature.",Smart Fault-Detection Machine for Ball-Bearing System with Chaotic Mapping Strategy.,https://www.ncbi.nlm.nih.gov/pubmed/31083448,"Sensors (Basel, Switzerland)",2019 06 10,"In this paper, a set of smart fault-detection approach with chaotic mapping strategy is developed for an industrial ball-bearing system. There are four main statuses in this ball-bearing system: normal, inner race fault, outer race fault, and ball fault. However, it is hard to simply classify each of them through their vibration signals in time-series. By developing a nonlinear error dynamic system as well as a chaotic mapping strategy, the signals in the time series can be converted into the chaotic domain, which are revealed in 3D phase portraits. Further, through collocation of clustering methods, such as Euclidean distance (ED) and the kernel method of K-means (KM), the proposed 3D phase portraits of each different state can be efficiently identified through checking the autonomously adjusted ranges of feature values. The experiment results show that the proposed smart detection approach is effective and feasible, and the accuracy of detection in the testing stage is close to 100%.",Identifying Barriers to Reducing Portion Size: A Qualitative Focus Group Study of British Men and Women.,https://www.ncbi.nlm.nih.gov/pubmed/31083447,Nutrients,2019 05 14,"Reducing portion size might reduce meal satisfaction, which could minimize adherence to portion size interventions. The present study sought to identify the perceived barriers for consumers to eat smaller portions. A secondary aim explored the relative contribution of enjoyment of taste and post-meal fullness as determinants of meal satisfaction. Focus groups (N = 42) evaluated consumers' feelings toward a small reduction in portion size. Thematic analysis of written free association tasks and open-ended group discussions revealed that most participants expected to feel hungry and unsatisfied, which motivated them to consume something else. However, others expected to feel comfortable, healthy, and virtuous. The acceptability of the reduced portion was also determined by meal characteristics (e.g., time and setting) and individual characteristics (e.g., predicted energy requirements). Compared to post-meal fullness, enjoyment of taste was perceived to be the more important determinant of meal satisfaction. In conclusion, interventions should present portion reduction as a marginal modification with little physiological consequence to energy reserves, while emphasizing the positive feelings (e.g., comfort, satisfaction, and self-worth) experienced after consuming a smaller portion. Additionally, focusing on taste enjoyment (rather than fullness) might be a useful strategy to maintain meal satisfaction despite a reduction in meal size.",Oceans as a Source of Immunotherapy.,https://www.ncbi.nlm.nih.gov/pubmed/31083446,Marine drugs,2019 05 14,"Marine flora is taxonomically diverse, biologically active, and chemically unique.

Immunomodulators have been shown to have significant therapeutic effects on immune-mediated diseases, but the search for safe and effective immunotherapies for other diseases such as sinusitis, atopic dermatitis, rheumatoid arthritis, asthma and allergies is ongoing. This review focuses on the marine-originated bioactive molecules with immunomodulatory potential, with a particular focus on the molecular mechanisms of specific agents with respect to their targets.

However, it requires four to eight electrodes, and it takes a few minutes to accurately obtain the measurement results. In this study, we propose a faster and more accurate method that utilizes a small dry electrode-based wearable device, which predicts whole-body impedance using only upper-body impedance values. Such a small electrode-based device typically needs a long measurement time due to increased parasitic resistance, and its accuracy varies by measurement posture. To minimize these variations, we designed a sensing system that only utilizes contact with the wrist and index fingers. The measurement time was also reduced to five seconds by an effective parameter calibration network. Finally, we implemented a deep neural network-based algorithm to predict the PBF value by the measurement of the upper-body impedance and lower-body anthropometric data as auxiliary input features. The experiments were performed with 163 amateur athletes who exercised regularly. The performance of the proposed system was compared with those of two commercial systems that were designed to measure body composition using either a whole-body or upper-body impedance value. The results showed that the correlation coefficient ( r 2 ) value was improved by about 9%, and the standard error of estimate (SEE) was reduced by 28%.","Simultaneous Determination and Pharmacokinetic Characterization of Glycyrrhizin, Isoliquiritigenin, Liquiritigenin, and Liquiritin in Rat Plasma Following Oral Administration of Glycyrrhizae Radix Extract.",https://www.ncbi.nlm.nih.gov/pubmed/31083444,"Molecules (Basel, Switzerland)",2019 06 10,"Glycyrrhizae Radix is widely used as herbal medicine and is effective against inflammation, various cancers, and digestive disorders.

Retention times for glycyrrhizin, isoliquiritigenin, liquiritigenin, and liquiritin were 7.8 min, 4.1 min, 3.1 min, and 2.0 min, respectively, suggesting that the four analytes were well separated without any interfering peaks around the peak elution time. The lower limit of quantitation was 2 ng/mL for glycyrrhizin and 0.2 ng/mL for isoliquiritigenin, liquiritigenin, and liquiritin; the inter- and intra-day accuracy, precision, and stability were less than 15%. Plasma concentrations of glycyrrhizin, isoliquiritigenin, liquiritigenin, and liquiritin were quantified for 24 h after a single oral administration of 1 g/kg GRE to four rats. Among the four components, plasma concentration of glycyrrhizin was the highest and exhibited a long half-life (23.1 Â± 15.5 h). Interestingly, plasma concentrations of isoliquiritigenin and liquiritigenin were restored to the initial concentration at 4-10 h after the GRE administration, as evidenced by liquiritin biotransformation into isoliquiritigenin and liquiritigenin, catalyzed by fecal lysate and gut wall enzymes. In conclusion, our analytical method developed for detecting glycyrrhizin, isoliquiritigenin, liquiritigenin, and liquiritin could be successfully applied to investigate their pharmacokinetic properties in rats and would be useful for conducting further studies on the efficacy, toxicity, and biopharmaceutics of GREs and their marker components."

Traditionally, dissolution is used to predict ASD performance. Here, a high-throughput approach is described that simultaneously screens drug dissolution and permeation employing a two-compartment 96-well plate. Freeze-drying from hydro-alcoholic solutions was used to prepare amorphous formulations. The screening approach was tested on amorphous and crystalline tadalafil formulations with and without SoluplusÂ®. The workflow consisted of: 1) dispersion of the formulations; 2) incubation within the two-compartment plate, where a dialysis membrane separated donor (dispersed formulation) and acceptor; 3) sampling (donor and acceptor), where donor samples were centrifuged to remove non-dissolved material; and 4) quantification by UHPLC-UV. To identify optimal screening conditions, the following parameters were varied: dispersion medium (buffer / biomimetic media), acceptor medium (buffer / surfactant solutions), and incubation time (1, 3, and 6 h). Surfactants (acceptor) increased tadalafil permeation. Biomimetic medium (donor) enhanced dissolution, but not permeation, except for freeze-dried tadalafil, for which the permeated amount increased. The predictiveness was evaluated by comparing dissolution-/permeation-results with in vivo bioavailability. In general, both dissolution and permeation reflected bioavailability, whereof the latter was a better predictor. High-throughput dissolution/permeation is regarded promising for formulation screening.",Polymorphism in Toll-Like Receptors and Helicobacter Pylori Motility in Autoimmune Atrophic Gastritis and Gastric Cancer.,https://www.ncbi.nlm.nih.gov/pubmed/31083432,Cancers,2019 05 14,"Autoimmune atrophic gastritis (AAG) is associated with an increased risk of certain types of gastric cancer (GC). Helicobacter pylori (H. pylori) infection may have a role in the induction and/or maintenance of AAG and GC. Toll-like receptors (TLR) are essential for H. pylori recognition and subsequent innate and adaptive immunity responses. This study therefore aimed to characterize TLR polymorphisms, and features of bacterial flagellin A in samples from patients with AAG (n = 67), GC (n = 114) and healthy donors (HD; n = 97). TLR5 rs5744174 C/C genotype was associated with GC, lower IgG anti H. pylori response and a higher H. pylori flagellin A abundance and motility. In a subset of patients with AAG, H. pylori strains showed a reduction of the flagellin A abundance and a moderate motility compared with strains from GC patients, a prerequisite for active colonization of the deeper layers of the mucosa, host immune response and inflammation. TLR9 rs5743836 T allele showed an association with serum gastrin G17. In conclusion, our study suggests that alterations of flaA protein, moderate motility in H. pylori and two polymorphisms in TLR5 and TLR9 may favor the onset of AAG and GC, at least in a subset of patients. These findings corroborate the function of pathogen-host cell interactions and responses, likely influencing the pathogenetic process.",Taiwanese Consumers' Willingness to Pay for Broiler Welfare Improvement.,https://www.ncbi.nlm.nih.gov/pubmed/31083431,Animals : an open access journal from MDPI,2019 05 14,"In this study, we explored the willingness to pay (WTP) for broilers raised under the high welfare system. The interval data model and the ordered probit model were used to investigate the factors that affect consumers' WTP for broiler meat produced by farm animal welfare (FAW), practice. Our results from both methods suggest that socioeconomic characteristics such as education level, income level, gender, and age significantly affect consumers' WTP. The food safety concerns of consumers and perceived consumer effectiveness also influence consumers' WTP. Using the interval data method, we computed the mean and median of the estimated WTP from our survey sample. The mean was 46.7745 New Taiwanese dollar per kilogram.

Clinical signs observed were consistent with equine influenza (EI) infection. The index cases were horses recently imported from New Zealand. Rapid control measures, including temporary cancellation of racing, were implemented to minimize the impact of the outbreak. By November, the disease outbreak was resolved, and movement restrictions were lifted. The aim of this study was to confirm the clinical diagnosis and characterize the causal virus. A pan-reactive influenza type A real-time RT-PCR was used for confirmatory diagnosis. Antigenic characterization by haemagglutinin inhibition using a panel of specific ferret antisera indicated that the causal virus belonged to clade 1 of the H3N8 Florida sub-lineage. The genetic characterization was achieved by the whole genome sequencing of positive nasal swabs from clinically affected animals. Pylogenetic analysis of the haemagglutinin (HA) and neuraminidase (NA) genes demonstrated â¥99% homology with several EI strains that had recently circulated in the USA and Japan.

Your Brain Says Yes Even Though Your Mouth Says No.,https://www.ncbi.nlm.nih.gov/pubmed/31083429,Brain sciences,2019 05 14,"In the present study, using both implicit and explicit measures, we addressed the issue of whether strongly developed relationships towards brands could be modified through the use of evaluative conditioning. Using an online survey, individual participant brand lists were created, and formed the basis of this experiment. Participants were then exposed to conditioning during a longitudinal study. Throughout the experiment, a combination of explicit and implicit measures was used to assess changes in attitude. Specifically, participants were asked to rate the brand names on a Likert-type scale. Simultaneously, changes in the brains electrical activity in response to the brands were recorded via electroencephalography (EEG). Upon completion of this task, participants underwent two Implicit Association Tests (IAT; one for liked brands and one for disliked brands). There were two main findings of this study. Firstly, no significant changes in attitude were observed via the use of explicit measures, and those that were found relating to the IAT were regarded as questionable. Secondly, EEG presented consistent results which showed that conditioning elicited changes in cortical activity towards both liked and disliked brands, which suggest it may be a useful tool in measuring the impact of evaluative conditioning that is not reflected in verbal responses.",A Porous Carbon with Excellent Gas Storage Properties from Waste Polystyrene.,https://www.ncbi.nlm.nih.gov/pubmed/31083428,"Nanomaterials (Basel, Switzerland)",2019 05 14,"In this paper, we describe the synthesis and gas adsorption properties of a porous carbonaceous material, obtained from commercial expanded polystyrene. The first step consists of the Friedel-Craft reaction of the dissolved polystyrene chains with a bridging agent to form a highly-crosslinked polymer, with permanent porosity of 0.7 cm 3 /g; then, this polymer is treated with potassium hydroxide at a high temperature to produce a carbon material with a porous volume larger than 1.4 cm 3 / g and a distribution of ultramicro-, micro-, and mesopores. After characterization of the porous carbon and determination of the bulk density, the methane uptake was measured using a volumetric apparatus to pressures up to 30 bar. The equilibrium adsorption isotherm obtained is among the highest ever reported for this kind of material. The interest of this product lies both in its excellent performance and in the virtually costless starting material.",An Opinion Paper on Aerogels for Biomedical and Environmental Applications.,https://www.ncbi.nlm.nih.gov/pubmed/31083427,"Molecules (Basel, Switzerland)",2019 06 10,"Aerogels are a special class of nanostructured materials with very high porosity and tunable physicochemical properties. Although a few types of aerogels have already reached the market in construction materials, textiles and aerospace engineering, the full potential of aerogels is still to be assessed for other technology sectors. Based on current efforts to address the material supply chain by a circular economy approach and longevity as well as quality of life with biotechnological methods, environmental and life science applications are two emerging market opportunities where the use of aerogels needs to be further explored and evaluated in a multidisciplinary approach. In this opinion paper, the relevance of the topic is put into context and the corresponding current research efforts on aerogel technology are outlined. Furthermore, key challenges to be solved in order to create materials by design, reproducible process technology and society-centered solutions specifically for the two abovementioned technology sectors are analyzed. Overall, advances in aerogel technology can yield innovative and integrated solutions for environmental and life sciences which in turn can help improve both the welfare of population and to move towards cleaner and smarter supply chain solutions.",A Facile Approach to Solid-State White Emissive Carbon Dots and Their Application in UV-Excitable and Single-Component-Based White LEDs.,https://www.ncbi.nlm.nih.gov/pubmed/31083426,"Nanomaterials (Basel, Switzerland)",2019 05 14,"Large-scale applications of conventional rare-earth phosphors in white light-emitting diodes (W-LEDs) are restricted by the non-renewable raw material sources and high energy consumption during the production process. Recently, carbon dots (CDs) have been proposed as promising alternatives to rare-earth phosphors and present bright prospects in white lighting. However, the use of CDs in W-LEDs still has two major obstacles, i.e., solid-state quenching and lack of single-component white emissive products. In this work, a facile, rapid, and scalable method for the preparation of solid-state white emissive CDs (W-CDs) is reported via microwave-irradiation heating of L-aspartic acid (AA) in the presence of ammonia. The W-CDs exhibit blue photoluminescence (PL) in dilute aqueous dispersion and their emission spectra gradually broaden (emerging new emissions at orange-yellow regions) with concentration increases. Interestingly, the W-CDs powder displays a very broad PL spectrum covering nearly the whole visible-light region under ultraviolet (UV) excitation, which is responsible for the observed white emission. Further studies revealed that the self-quenching-resistance feature of the W-CDs is probably due to a covering of polymer-like structures on their surface, thus avoiding the close contact of nanoparticles with each other. PL emission of the W-CDs is reasonably ascribed to a cross-linked enhanced effect (CEE) of the sub-fluorophores contained in the material (e.g., -NH2 and C=O). Finally, applications of the W-CDs in fabricating single-component-based W-LEDs using commercially available UV chips were attempted and shown to exhibit satisfactory performances including high white light-emitting purity, high color rendering index (CRI), and tunable correlated color temperature (CCT), thus rendering great promise for W-CDs in the field of white lighting.",Nonlinear Behavior of Electrostatically Actuated Microbeams with Coupled Longitudinalâ»Transversal Vibration.,https://www.ncbi.nlm.nih.gov/pubmed/31083425,Micromachines,2019 05 14,"Microelectromechanical switch has become an essential component in a wide variety of applications, ranging from biomechanics and aerospace engineering to consumer electronics. Electrostatically actuated microbeams and microplates are chief parts of many MEMS instruments. In this study, the nonlinear characteristics of coupled longitudinal-transversal vibration are analyzed, while an electrostatically actuated microbeam is designed considering that the frequency ratio is two to one between the first longitudinal vibration and transversal vibration. The nonlinear governing equations are truncated into a set of coupled ordinary differential equations by the Galerkin method. Then the equations are solved using the multiple-scales method and the nonlinear dynamics of the internal resonance is investigated. The influence of bias voltage, longitudinal excitation and frequency detuning parameters are mainly analyzed. Results show that using the pseudo-arclength continuation method, the nonlinear amplitude-response curves can be plotted continuously. The saturation and jump phenomena are greatly affected by the bias voltage and the detuning frequency. Beyond the critical excitation amplitude, the response energy will transfer from the longitudinal motion to the transversal motion, even the excitation is employed on the longitudinal direction. The large-amplitude jump of the low-order vibration mode can be used to detect the variation of the conditions or parameters, which shows great potential in improving precision of MEMS switches.",Vitamin D and Anti-MÃ¼llerian Hormone Levels in Infertility Treatment: The Change-Point Problem.,https://www.ncbi.nlm.nih.gov/pubmed/31083424,Nutrients,2019 05 14,"Anti-MÃ¼llerian hormone (AMH) is considered to be one of the most significant indicators of women's fertility.

This study investigated the hepatoprotective effects in high-fat diet (HFD)-induced non-alcoholic fatty liver disease-like C57BL/6J mice. The mice were randomly divided into four groups (n = 10/group): the normal diet group, the HFD group, the arazyme group (HFD with 0.025% arazyme), and the milk thistle (MT) group (HFD with 0.1% MT). Dietary supplementation of arazyme for 13 weeks significantly lowered plasma triglyceride (TG) and non-esterified fatty acid levels. Suppression of HFD-induced hepatic steatosis in the arazyme group was caused by the reduced hepatic TG and total cholesterol (TC) contents. Arazyme supplementation decreased hepatic lipogenesis-related gene expression, sterol regulatory element-binding transcription protein 1 (Srebf1), fatty acid synthase (Fas), acetyl-CoA carboxylase 1 (Acc1), stearoyl-CoA desaturase-1 (Scd1), Scd2, glycerol-3-phosphate acyltransferase (Gpam), diacylglycerol O-acyltransferase 1 (Dgat1), and Dgat2. Arazyme directly reduced palmitic acid (PA)-induced TG accumulation in HepG2 cells. Arazyme suppressed macrophage infiltration and tumor necrosis factor Î± (Tnfa), interleukin-1Î² (Il1b), and chemokine-ligand-2 (Ccl2) expression in the liver, and inhibited secretion of TNFÎ± and expression of inflammatory mediators, Tnfa, Il1b, Ccl2, Ccl3, Ccl4, and Ccl5, in PA-induced RAW264.7 cells.

However, sustainable apple production is threatened by powdery mildew (PM) disease, which is caused by the obligate biotrophic fungus Podosphaera leucotricha. To gain insight into the molecular basis of the PM infection and disease progression, RNA-based transcriptional profiling (RNA-seq) was used to identify differentially expressed genes (DEGs) in apples following inoculation with P. leucotricha. Four RNA-seq libraries were constructed comprising a total of 214 Gb of high-quality sequence. 1177 DEGs (661 upregulated and 629 downregulated) have been identified according to the criteria of a ratio of infection/control fold change > 2, and a false discovery rate (FDR) < 0.001. The majority of DEGs (815) were detected 12 h after inoculation, suggesting that this is an important time point in the response of the PM infection. Gene annotation analysis revealed that DEGs were predominately associated with biological processes, phenylpropanoid biosynthesis, hormone signal transduction and plant-pathogen interactions. Genes activated by infection corresponded to transcription factors (e.g., AP2/ERF, MYB, WRKY and NAC) and synthesis of defense-related metabolites, including pathogenesis-related genes, glucosidase and dehydrin. Overall, the information obtained in this study enriches the resources available for research into the molecular-genetic mechanisms of the apple/powdery mildew interactions, and provides a theoretical basis for the development of new apple varieties with resistance to PM.",Improved Algal Toxicity Test System for Robust Omics-Driven Mode-of-Action Discovery in Chlamydomonas reinhardtii.,https://www.ncbi.nlm.nih.gov/pubmed/31083411,Metabolites,2019 05 14,"Algae are key components of aquatic food chains. Consequently, they are internationally recognised test species for the environmental safety assessment of chemicals. However, existing algal toxicity test guidelines are not yet optimized to discover molecular modes of action, which require highly-replicated and carefully controlled experiments. Here, we set out to develop a robust, miniaturised and scalable Chlamydomonas reinhardtii toxicity testing approach tailored to meet these demands. We primarily investigated the benefits of synchronised cultures for molecular studies, and of exposure designs that restrict chemical volatilisation yet yield sufficient algal biomass for omics analyses. Flow cytometry and direct-infusion mass spectrometry metabolomics revealed significant and time-resolved changes in sample composition of synchronised cultures. Synchronised cultures in sealed glass vials achieved adequate growth rates at previously unachievably-high inoculation cell densities, with minimal pH drift and negligible chemical loss over 24-h exposures. Algal exposures to a volatile test compound (chlorobenzene) yielded relatively high reproducibility of metabolic phenotypes over experimental repeats. This experimental test system extends existing toxicity testing formats to allow highly-replicated, omics-driven, mode-of-action discovery.",Influence of Oxidation Level of Graphene Oxide on the Mechanical Performance and Photo-Oxidation Resistance of a Polyamide 6.,https://www.ncbi.nlm.nih.gov/pubmed/31083410,Polymers,2019 05 14,"The aim of this work is to study the relationship between the chemical-physical properties of graphene oxide (GO) and the performance of a polyamide 6 (PA6) in terms of mechanical reinforcement and resistance to UV-exposure. For this purpose, two samples of GO possessing different oxidation degrees were added (0.75 wt.%) to PA6 by way of a two-step technique and the materials achieved were carefully analysed from a morphological, chemical-physical, mechanical point of view. Photo-oxidation tests were carried out to assess the performance of this class of nanohybrids after 240 h of UV-exposure. The results reveal that both nanocomposites exhibit enhanced mechanical performance and durability of PA6. However, the most oxidized GO led to a higher increase of mechanical properties and a stronger resistance to UV-exposure. All the analyses confirm that both GO samples are well dispersed and covalently attached to PA6. However, the higher the oxidation level of GO the stronger and the more extended the chemical interphase of the nanocomposite. As regards photochemical stability, both GO samples display UV-shielding capacity but the most oxidized GO also shows radical scavenging activity by virtue of its nanocavities and defects, imparted by prolonged oxidation, which endows PA6 with an outstanding durability even after 240 h of UV-exposure.",Patient Derived Chicken Egg Tumor Model (PDcE Model): Current Status and Critical Issues.,https://www.ncbi.nlm.nih.gov/pubmed/31083409,Cells,2019 05 14,"Chorioallantoic membrane assay (CAM assay) using fertilized chicken eggs has been used for the study of tumor formation, angiogenesis and metastasis. Recently, there is growing realization that this system provides a valuable assay for a patient-derived tumor model. Several reports establish that tumor samples from cancer patients can be used to reproduce tumor in the chicken egg. High transplantation efficiency has been achieved. In this review, we discuss examples of transplanting patient tumors. We then discuss critical issues that need to be addressed to pursue this line of experiments. The patient-derived chicken egg model (PDcE model) has an advantage over other models in its rapid tumor formation. This raises the possibility that the PDcE model is valuable for identifying optimum drug for each individual patient.",Parameter Study of Superabsorbent Polymers (SAPs) for Use in Durable Concrete Structures.,https://www.ncbi.nlm.nih.gov/pubmed/31083408,"Materials (Basel, Switzerland)",2019 06 10,"Superabsorbent polymers (SAPs) can be added to a concrete mixture to provide internal curing and reduce the risk for early-age shrinkage cracking. Hence, they can help to increase the overall durability of concrete structures. The type, swelling characteristics, kinetics of water release, amount and particle size of the SAPs will dictate their effectiveness for this purpose. In this paper, SAPs with different cross-linking degrees, particle sizes and amount of solubles are investigated. By varying these parameters, insight can be gained on the influence of each of these parameters on SAP properties such as the swelling capacity. In a next step, the SAPs can be implemented in mortar to assess their influence on mortar properties like workability, compressive strength or hydration kinetics. Based on these results, the 'ideal' SAP with tunable properties for a specific concrete application can be selected. For this purpose, an anionic SAP was synthesized with varying amounts of cross-linker and ground to particle sizes with d50 varying between 10 and 100 Âµm. The swelling capacity in demineralised water of 40 Âµm SAP particles increased with a decreasing degree of cross-linker from 66 g/g SAP with 1 mol% cross-linker to 270 g/g SAP in case of 0.15 mol% cross-linker, and was about three to four times larger than the swelling capacity in the prepared cement filtrate. The SAPs were tested for their effect on mortar workability, cement hydration kinetics and mechanical properties of the hardened mortar. With proper compensation for the absorbed water by the SAPs, the mortar workability was not negatively affected and the reduction in flow over the first two hours remained limited. The SAPs with the lowest swelling capacity, resulting in the smallest total amount of macro pores formed, showed the smallest negative effect on mortar compressive strength (a reduction of 23% compared to the reference after 28 days for an addition of 0.5 m% SAP) and a negligible effect on cement hydration. The difference in strength with the reference decreased as a function of mortar age. When using SAPs with particle sizes in the range of 10-100 Âµm, no significant differences between the studied particle sizes were found concerning the mortar properties. With the ease of upscaling in mind, the need to purify the SAPs and to remove the non-cross-linked soluble fraction was further investigated. It was shown that the solubles had no effect on the mortar properties, except for increasing the setting time with almost 100%.",Antioxidant Activity and Toxicity of Fullerenols via Bioluminescence Signaling: Role of Oxygen Substituents.,https://www.ncbi.nlm.nih.gov/pubmed/31083407,International journal of molecular sciences,2019 06 10,"Fullerenols are nanosized water-soluble polyhydroxylated derivatives of fullerenes, a specific allotropic form of carbon, bioactive compounds, and perspective basis for drug development. Our paper analyzes the antioxidant activity and toxicity of a series of fullerenols with different number of oxygen substituents. Two groups of fullerenols were under investigation: (1) C60Oy(OH)x, C60,70Oy(OH)x, where x + y = 24-28 and (2) C60,70Oy(OH)x, Fe0,5C60Oy(OH)x, Gd@C82Oy(OH)x, where x + y = 40-42. Bioluminescent cellular and enzymatic assays (luminous marine bacteria and their enzymatic reactions, respectively) were applied to monitor toxicity in the model fullerenol solutions and bioluminescence was applied as a signaling physiological parameter. The inhibiting concentrations of the fullerenols were determined, revealing the fullerenols' toxic effects. Antioxidant fullerenol' ability was studied in solutions of model oxidizer, 1,4-benzoquinone, and detoxification coefficients of general and oxidative types (DGT and DOxT) were calculated. All fullerenols produced toxic effect at high concentrations (>0.01 g L-1), while their antioxidant activity was demonstrated at low and ultralow concentrations (<0.001 g L-1). Quantitative toxic and antioxidant characteristics of the fullerenols (effective concentrations, concentration ranges, DGT, and DOxT) were found to depend on the number of oxygen substituents. Lower toxicity and higher antioxidant activity were determined in solutions of fullerenols with fewer oxygen substituents (x + y = 24-28). The differences in fullerenol properties were attributed to their catalytic activity due to reversible electron acceptance, radical trapping, and balance of reactive oxygen species in aqueous solutions. The results provide pharmaceutical sciences with a basis for selection of carbon nanoparticles with appropriate toxic and antioxidant characteristics. Based on the results, we recommend, to reduce the toxicity of prospective endohedral gadolinium-fullerenol preparations Gd@C82Oy(OH)x, decreasing the number of oxygen groups to x + y = 24-28. The potential of bioluminescence methods to compare toxic and antioxidant characteristics of carbon nanostructures were demonstrated.",The Role of AMP-Activated Protein Kinase as a Potential Target of Treatment of Hepatocellular Carcinoma.,https://www.ncbi.nlm.nih.gov/pubmed/31083406,Cancers,2019 05 14,"Background: Hepatocellular carcinoma (HCC) is the fifth most frequent cancer worldwide with a very high recurrence rate and very dismal prognosis. Diagnosis and treatment in HCC remain difficult, and the identification of new therapeutic targets is necessary for a better outcome of HCC treatment. AMP-Activated Protein Kinase (AMPK) is an essential intracellular energy sensor that plays multiple roles in cellular physiology and the pathological development of chronic diseases. Recent studies have highlighted the important regulation of AMPK in HCC. This review aims to comprehensively and critically summarize the role of AMPK in HCC. Methods: Original studies were retrieved from NCBI database with keywords including AMPK and HCC, which were analyzed with extensive reading. Results: Dysregulation of the kinase activity and expression of AMPK was observed in HCC, which was correlated with survival of the patients. Loss of AMPK in HCC cells may proceed cell cycle progression, proliferation, survival, migration, and invasion through different oncogenic molecules and pathways.

MicroRNAs (miRNAs) are endogenous regulatory molecules that play essential roles in plant growth, development, and the response to environmental stresses. Cold is one of the key environmental factors affecting the yield and quality of A. membranaceus, and miRNAs may mediate the gene regulation network under cold stress in A. membranaceus. To identify miRNAs and reveal their functions in cold stress response in A. membranaceus, small RNA sequencing was conducted followed by bioinformatics analysis, and quantitative real time PCR (qRT-PCR) analysis was performed to profile the expression of miRNAs under cold stress. A total of 168 conserved miRNAs belonging to 34 families and 14 putative non-conserved miRNAs were identified. Many miRNA targets were predicted and these targets were involved in diversified regulatory and metabolic pathways. By using qRT-PCR, 27 miRNAs were found to be responsive to cold stress, including 4 cold stress-induced and 17 cold-repressed conserved miRNAs, and 6 cold-induced non-conserved miRNAs. These cold-responsive miRNAs probably mediate the response to cold stress by regulating development, hormone signaling, defense, redox homeostasis, and secondary metabolism in A. membranaceus.

Meanwhile, the carbon dioxide adsorption analysis confirmed that the maximum equilibrium adsorption amount of carbon dioxide on synthesized zeolite 4A is 59.3820 mL/g, which is higher than the 55.4303 mL/g of the commercial zeolite 4A.",Epidemiology of Cow's Milk Allergy.,https://www.ncbi.nlm.nih.gov/pubmed/31083388,Nutrients,2019 05 14,"Immunoglobulin E (IgE)-mediated cow's milk allergy (CMA) is one of the most common food allergies in infants and young children. CMA can result in anaphylactic reactions, and has long term implications on growth and nutrition. There are several studies in diverse populations assessing the epidemiology of CMA. However, assessment is complicated by the presence of other immune-mediated reactions to cow's milk. These include non-IgE and mixed (IgE and non-IgE) reactions and common non-immune mediated reactions, such as lactose intolerance. Estimates of prevalence and population-level patterns are further complicated by the natural history of CMA (given its relatively high rate of resolution) and variation in phenotype (with a large proportion of patients able to tolerate baked cow's milk). Prevalence, natural history, demographic patterns, and long-term outcomes of CMA have been explored in several disparate populations over the past 30 to 40 years, with differences seen based on the method of outcome assessment, study population, time period, and geographic region. The primary aim of this review is to describe the epidemiology of CMA. The review also briefly discusses topics related to prevalence studies and specific implications of CMA, including severity, natural course, nutritional impact, and risk factors.",Effects of Cu-Coated SiC Content on Microstructure and Properties of Laser Cladding SiCp/Alâ»Si Composite Coatings.,https://www.ncbi.nlm.nih.gov/pubmed/31083387,"Materials (Basel, Switzerland)",2019 06 10,"SiC particles (SiCp)-reinforced Al-Si matrix composite coatings were synthesized on 4032 aluminum alloy by laser cladding using powder mixtures of Al-20 wt.% Si alloy and electroless copper-plated SiC particles (SiCp-Cu). The effects of SiCp-Cu content on microstructure, phase composition, and microhardness of the SiCp/Al-Si laser cladding layer (LCL) were investigated systematically. The results showed that the microstructure of SiCp-Cu/Al-Si LCL was mainly composed of undissolved SiCp, lump-like primary Si, lump-like Al2Cu, plate-like Al4SiC4, and Al-Si-Cu ternary eutectic. In addition, the eutectic microstructure became finer with the increasing of SiCp-Cu content. The average microhardness of the LCL increased with the increasing of SiCp-Cu content. When SiCp-Cu content was 50 wt.%, the average microhardness of the LCL reached 508 HV0.05, which was about 3.5 times larger than that of the substrate. The LCL reinforced with a SiCp-Cu content of 30 wt.% exhibits the best wear resistance.",RNA-seq Transcriptome Analysis in Ovarian Tissue of Pelibuey Breed to Explore the Regulation of Prolificacy.,https://www.ncbi.nlm.nih.gov/pubmed/31083386,Genes,2019 05 14,"The Pelibuey sheep (Ovis aries) is an indigenous breed distributed in the tropical regions of Mexico. The prolificacy of this sheep is on average from 1 to 1.5 lambs, being an important breeding characteristic that owners seek to increase with the purpose of economic improvements. New-generation RNA sequencing technology has been used to identify the genes that are expressed in the ovarian tissue of sheep that have two or more lambs per parturition, as well as to elucidate the metabolic pathways that are affected by the expression of these genes, with the purpose of better understanding the prolificacy in the sheep. In the present study, the transcriptional expression of multiparous and uniparous sheep was compared using RNA sequencing. Multiparous (M group) and uniparous (U group) sheep that had a genealogical record for three generations (M, n = 5 and U, n = 5) were selected. RNA was extracted from ovarian tissue and subsequently used to prepare the libraries that were sequenced using the Illumina NextSeq500 platform. A total of 31,575 genes were detected from the transcriptomic analysis of which 4908 were significantly expressed (p-value â¤ 0.001) in the ovary of sheep. Subsequently, a second filter was carried out to evaluate the false discovery rate (FDR) and select those genes with p-values â¤ 0.05 and values of expression â¥ 1 (log2), obtaining 354 differential expressed genes (DEG): 120 genes up-regulated and 234 genes down-regulated in the group M with respect to the group U. Through Gene Ontology (GO) and metabolic analysis, we obtained information on the function of differentially expressed genes, and its importance in the reproduction of multiparous sheep. This result suggest that genes identified in the present study participate in the development of the final stages of follicles.",Parametric Analysis on the Circular CFST Column and RBS Steel Beam Joints.,https://www.ncbi.nlm.nih.gov/pubmed/31083385,"Materials (Basel, Switzerland)",2019 06 10,"This research analyzes the results of parametric studies of concrete-filled steel tubular (CFST) columns to the reduced beam section (RBS) beam joint with through diaphragm, using ANSYS.

To guarantee fast and reliable action of a 400 V DC SSCB with SiC MOSFET, circuit design and prototype development were carried out. Taking 400V DC microgrid as research background, firstly, the topology of DC SSCB with SiC MOSFET was introduced. Then, the drive circuit of SiC MOSFET, fault detection circuit, energy absorption circuit, and snubber circuit of the SSCB were designed and analyzed. Lastly, a prototype of the DC SSCB with SiC MOSFET was developed, tested, and compared with the SSCB with Silicon (Si) insulated gate bipolar transistor (IGBT). Experimental results show that the designed circuits of SSCB with SiC MOSFET are valid. Also, the developed miniature DC SSCB with the SiC MOSFET exhibits faster reaction to the fault and can reduce short circuit time and fault current in contrast with the SSCB with Si IGBT.

Women of childbearing age are indicated by World Health Organization as the primary target group, but maintaining iron balance is particularly challenging for adolescents. The aim of the presented study was to analyze heme and non-heme iron intake and dietary sources in adolescent menstruating females in a national Polish sample. The study was conducted in a representative sample of adolescents (aged 15-20) who were recruited from all regions of Poland based on secondary school sampling (random quota sampling), with 1385 female adolescents being included in the sample. The iron intake was assessed using the previously validated IRONIC-FFQ (IRON Intake Calculation-Food Frequency Questionnaire). The intakes of iron, heme iron, non-heme iron, and iron from food product groups were assessed and compared with those of male adolescents (n = 1025) who were recruited from the same schools, as well as between sub-groups stratified by age, body mass index, anemia history, following vegetarian diet, applying iron supplementation and school type. Compared with male individuals, females were characterized by a lower intake of all forms of iron. It was stated that non-heme iron intake was highest in younger ones, overweight ones, vegetarian ones, and comprehensive school students. Female adolescents with anemia history were characterized by similar iron intake as others.

The performance of the developed nanocomposite coatings was investigated in corrosive environments to evaluate their anti-corrosion properties. The SEM/TEM, TGA, and FTIR analysis confirm the loading of the DOC into the TNTs. The UV-Vis spectroscopic analysis confirms the self-release of the inhibitor (DOC) in response to the pH change. The electrochemical impedance spectroscopic (EIS) analysis indicates that the synthesized nanocomposite coatings demonstrate superior anticorrosion properties at pH 2 as compared to pH 5. The improved anticorrosion properties of nanocomposite coatings at pH 2 can be attributed to the more effective release of the DOC from the nanocontainers. The superior performance makes polymeric nanocomposite coatings suitable for many industrial applications.",Combined Longitudinal Effect of Physical Activity and Screen Time on Food and Beverage Consumption in European Preschool Children: The ToyBox-Study.,https://www.ncbi.nlm.nih.gov/pubmed/31083368,Nutrients,2019 05 14,"Lifestyle behavioral habits such as excess screen time (ST), a lack of physical activity (PA), and high energy-dense food consumption are associated with an increased risk of children being overweight or obese. This study aimed to (1) track longitudinal adherence to PA and ST recommendations at baseline (T0) and follow-up (T1) and (2) assess the association between changes in adherence to PA and ST recommendations and food and beverage consumption at follow-up. The present study included 2321 preschool children (3.5 to 6) participating in the multicenter ToyBox-study. A lineal mixed effects model was used to examine the association between different types of food and beverages and their relationship with changes in adherence to PA and ST recommendations. Approximately half of the children (50.4%) did not meet the PA and ST recommendations at both baseline and follow-up. However, only 0.6% of the sample met both PA and ST recommendations. Preschool children who met both recommendations consumed fewer fizzy drinks, juices, sweets, desserts, and salty snacks and consumed more water, fruits and vegetables, and dairy products than did those not meeting both recommendations. In conclusion, the proportion of European preschool children adhering to both PA and ST recommendations was very low and was associated with a low consumption of energy-dense foods.",Preparation and Composition Optimization of PEO:MC Polymer Blend Films to Enhance Electrical Conductivity.,https://www.ncbi.nlm.nih.gov/pubmed/31083367,Polymers,2019 05 14,"The polymer blend technique was used to improve amorphous phases of a semicrystalline polymer.

X-ray diffraction (XRD), Polarized optical microscope (POM), Fourier transform infrared (FTIR) and electrical impedance spectroscopy (EIS) were used to characterize the prepared blend films. The XRD and POM studies indicated that all polymer blend films are semicrystalline in nature, and the lowest degree of crystallinity was obtained for PEO:MC polymer blend film with a weight ratio of 60:40. The FTIR spectroscopy was used to identify the chemical structure of samples and examine the interactions between chains of the two polymers. The interaction between PEO and MC is evidenced from the shift of infrared absorption bands. The DC conductivity of the films at different temperatures revealed that the highest conductivity 6.55 Ã 10-9 S/cm at ambient temperature was achieved for the blend sample with the lowest degree of crystallinity and reach to 26.67 Ã 10-6 S/cm at 373 K.

The behavior of planktonic Pseudomonas aeruginosa exposed to a cationic polymer was characterized for changes in growth behavior and aggregation behavior, and linked to resulting P. aeruginosa biofilm formation, biomass, viability, and metabolic activity. The incubation of P. aeruginosa planktonic bacteria with a cationic polymer resulted in the aggregation of planktonic bacteria, and a reduction in biofilm development. We propose that cationic polymers may sequester planktonic bacteria away from surfaces, thereby preventing their attachment and suppressing biofilm formation.",Evolutionary Divergence of Duplicated Hsf Genes in Populus.,https://www.ncbi.nlm.nih.gov/pubmed/31083365,Cells,2019 05 14,"Heat shock transcription factors (Hsfs), which function as the activator of heat shock proteins (Hsps), play multiple roles in response to environmental stress and the development of plants. The Hsf family had experienced gene expansion via whole-genome duplication from a single cell algae to higher plants. However, how the Hsf gene family went through evolutionary divergence after genome duplication is unknown. As a model wood species, Populus trichocarpa is widely distributed in North America with various ecological and climatic environments. In this study, we used P. trichocarpa as materials and identified the expression divergence of the PtHsf gene family in developmental processes, such as dormant bud formation and opening, catkins development, and in response to environments. Through the co-expression network, we further discovered the divergent co-expressed genes that related to the functional divergence of PtHsfs. Then, we studied the alternative splicing events, single nucleotide polymorphism distribution and tertiary structures of members of the PtHsf gene family. In addition to expression divergence, we uncovered the evolutionary divergence in the protein level which may be important to new function formations and for survival in changing environments. This study comprehensively analyzed the evolutionary divergence of a member of the PtHsf gene family after genome duplication, paving the way for further gene function analysis and genetic engineering.",Thermotropic Liquid-Crystalline and Light-Emitting Properties of Poly(pyridinium) Salts Containing Various Diamine Connectors and Hydrophilic Macrocounterions.,https://www.ncbi.nlm.nih.gov/pubmed/31083364,Polymers,2019 05 14,"A set of poly(pyridinium) salts containing various diamine moieties, as molecular connectors, and poly(ethyleneglycol)-4-nonylphenyl-3-sulfopropyl ether, thereafter referred to as ""Macroion"", as the hydrophilic counterion, were prepared by metathesis reaction from the respective precursory tosylated poly(pyridinium)s in methanol. The structure of these ionic polymers was established by spectroscopy and chromatography techniques. The shape-persistent ionic poly(pyridinium) materials, inserting rigid or semi-rigid diamine spacers, display thermotropic liquid-crystalline properties from room-temperature up to their isotropization (in the temperature range around 160-200 Â°C). The nature of the LC phases is lamellar in both cases as identified by the combination of various complementary experimental techniques including DSC, POM and variable-temperature SAXS. The other polymers, inserting bulky or flexible spacers, only form room temperature viscous liquids. These new macromolecular systems can then be referred to as polymeric ionic liquid crystals (PILCs) and or polymeric ionic liquids (PILs). All the ionic polymers show excellent thermal stability, in the 260-330 Â°C temperature range as determined by TGA measurements, and a good solubility in common organic solvents as well as in water. Their optical properties were characterized in both solution and solid states by UV-Vis and photoluminescent spectroscopies. They emit blue or green light in both the states and exhibit a positive solvatochromic effect.","Physiological and Behavioural Responses of Cattle to High and Low Space, Feed and Water Allowances During Long Distance Transport in the South of Chile.",https://www.ncbi.nlm.nih.gov/pubmed/31083363,Animals : an open access journal from MDPI,2019 05 14,"Long distance transport of livestock from Patagonia to central Chile involves both road and sea transport and has a potential impact on the welfare of animals. Fifty Bos taurus cattle of approximate age six months were exposed to a journey of four days, with both the sea and road components undertaken in a truck (roll-off roll-on system) with two pens of different dimensions. Thirty-two and eighteen cattle were randomly allocated to two treatment groups: Low and High welfare standards, which were provided 0.66 m2/head and 0.86 m2/head, respectively, and a fixed amount of feed and water daily to each pen, 1.25 kg hay/head and 3.1 L water/head in the Low welfare treatment and 2.22 kg/head and 5.6 L/head in the High welfare treatment, respectively. Low welfare animals had increased plasma total protein and albumin, which is suggested to be due to limited water availability, and also haptoglobin, suggesting inflammatory responses. Cattle in the High welfare treatment spent more time eating and ruminating than those in the Low space allowance, but they had increased cortisol at the end of the journey, perhaps reflecting increased fighting with more space. Cattle welfare in both treatments was adversely affected by the limited feed and water supplies, with increased beta-hydroxybutyrate at the end of the voyage; total protein was increased in just the low welfare standard group where low space allowance and less food and water was provided. Creatine phosphokinase also increased after the journey, compared with before, indicating bruising. Limiting feed and water availability to cattle in the low welfare treatment resulted in physiological evidence of undernutrition and low hydration status, but it also reduced the stress response, probably because there was less fighting."

The present review addresses diet-linked etiologies of hemochromatosis and their pathogenesis in the network of genes and nutrients. Although the mechanistic association to diet-linked etiologies can be complicated, the stress sentinels are pivotally involved in the pathological processes of secondary hemochromatosis in response to iron excess and other external stresses. Moreover, the mutations in these sentineling pathway-linked genes increase susceptibility to secondary hemochromatosis. Thus, the crosstalk between nutrients and genes would verify the complex procedures in the clinical outcomes of secondary hemochromatosis and chronic complications, such as malignancy.

Consequently, the proper quality control methods for these Chinese medical preparations have been great challenges to the traditional Chinese medicine modernization and internationalization. What components should be chosen for quality control is a big challenge in the development of traditional Chinese medicine. A new concept of ""Quality Marker"" was proposed by Liu et al. to solve this problem and established a new research paradigm for traditional Chinese medicine quality study. Several strategies were proposed by the researchers in traditional Chinese medicine, here, we used Shengmai injection as an example to discuss a strategy for selecting ""Quality Markers"" of Chinese medical preparation by the components transfer process analysis in the Shengmai injection manufacturing process. Firstly, a total of 87 compounds were identified or partially characterized in shengmai injection. Secondly, referenced to the quality control method in China pharmacopeia and considered the biomarkers in the original medicines and representative components in the manufacturing process, four ginsenosides in Panax ginseng (Hongshen), two compounds in Schisandra chinensis (Wuweizi), and a sugar from Ophiopogon japonicas (Maidong) were quantified. As a result, these seven representative compounds exhibited an acceptable transitivity throughout the Shengmai injection manufacturing process. Finally, combined with the active ingredients, components transfer process analysis, and comprehensive evaluation by ""Spider-web"" analysis, six compounds were selected as the quality markers for the quality control of Shengmai injection. Through this strategy of optimization for quality markers of Shengmai injection, we found that these six compounds could represent the main bioactive substances and be easily detected in the whole process of production. Furthermore, the quality control method was developed for quality assessment and control of these six quality markers in the Shengmai injection. The total content range of the selected quality markers in the 10 batches of the Shengmai injection is 13.844-22.557 mg/mL.",Single-Cell RNA-Sequencing Identifies Activation of TP53 and STAT1 Pathways in Human T Lymphocyte Subpopulations in Response to Ex Vivo Radiation Exposure.,https://www.ncbi.nlm.nih.gov/pubmed/31083348,International journal of molecular sciences,2019 06 10,"Detrimental health consequences from exposure to space radiation are a major concern for long-duration human exploration missions to the Moon or Mars. Cellular responses to radiation are expected to be heterogeneous for space radiation exposure, where only high-energy protons and other particles traverse a fraction of the cells. Therefore, assessing DNA damage and DNA damage response in individual cells is crucial in understanding the mechanisms by which cells respond to different particle types and energies in space. In this project, we identified a cell-specific signature for radiation response by using single-cell transcriptomics of human lymphocyte subpopulations. We investigated gene expression in individual human T lymphocytes 3 h after ex vivo exposure to 2-Gy gamma rays while using the single-cell sequencing technique (10X Genomics). In the process, RNA was isolated from ~700 irradiated and ~700 non-irradiated control cells, and then sequenced with ~50 k reads/cell. RNA in each of the cells was distinctively barcoded prior to extraction to allow for quantification for individual cells. Principal component and clustering analysis of the unique molecular identifier (UMI) counts classified the cells into three groups or sub-types, which correspond to CD4+, naÃ¯ve, and CD8+/NK cells. Gene expression changes after radiation exposure were evaluated using negative binomial regression. On average, BBC3, PCNA, and other TP53 related genes that are known to respond to radiation in human T cells showed increased activation. While most of the TP53 responsive genes were upregulated in all groups of cells, the expressions of IRF1, STAT1, and BATF were only upregulated in the CD4+ and naÃ¯ve groups, but were unchanged in the CD8+/NK group, which suggests that the interferon-gamma pathway does not respond to radiation in CD8+/NK cells. Thus, single-cell RNA sequencing technique was useful for simultaneously identifying the expression of a set of genes in individual cells and T lymphocyte subpopulation after gamma radiation exposure. The degree of dependence of UMI counts between pairs of upregulated genes was also evaluated to construct a similarity matrix for cluster analysis. The cluster analysis identified a group of TP53-responsive genes and a group of genes that are involved in the interferon gamma pathway, which demonstrate the potential of this method for identifying previously unknown groups of genes with similar expression patterns.",Comparative Analysis of Fluorinated Anions for Polypyrrole Linear Actuator Electrolytes.,https://www.ncbi.nlm.nih.gov/pubmed/31083347,Polymers,2019 05 14,"Either as salts or room temperature ionic liquids, fluorinated anion-based electrolytes have been a common choice for ionic electroactive polymer actuators, both linear and bending.

The actuation direction, the characteristics-performance relations influence the behavior of the actuators. Isotonic Electro-chemo-mechanical deformation (ECMD) measurements were performed to study the response of the PPy/DBS samples. The highest strain for pristine PPy/DBS linear actuators was found in range of 21% for LiTFSI, while TBAPF6 had the least cation involvement, suggesting the potential for application in durable and controllable actuators.

When the ratio was < 1.0, the inhaled dose was higher than ratio > 1.0 (21.8 Â± 3.8% vs. 9.0 Â± 3.7%, p < 0.001), and the inhaled dose was similar between quiet and distressed breathing (22.3 Â± 5.0% vs. 21.3 Â± 2.7%, p = 0.379). During trans-nasal aerosol delivery, GF:IF primarily affected the inhaled dose. Compared to the ratio above 1.0, the ratio below 1.0 produced a higher and more-consistent inhaled dose.",Understanding the Properties of Starch in Potatoes (Solanum tuberosum var. Agria) after Being Treated with Pulsed Electric Field Processing.,https://www.ncbi.nlm.nih.gov/pubmed/31083345,"Foods (Basel, Switzerland)",2019 05 14,"The purpose of this study was to investigate the properties of starch in potatoes (Solanum tuberosum cv. Agria) after being treated with pulsed electric fields (PEF). Potatoes were treated at 50 and 150 kJ/kg specific energies with various electric field strengths of 0, 0.5, 0.7, 0.9 and 1.1 kV/cm. Distilled water was used as the processing medium. Starches were isolated from potato tissue and from the PEF processing medium. To assess the starch properties, various methods were used, i.e., the birefringence capability using a polarised light microscopy, gelatinisation behaviour using hot-stage light microscopy and differential scanning calorimetry (DSC), thermal stability using thermogravimetry (TGA), enzyme susceptibility towards Î±-amylase and the extent of starch hydrolysis under in vitro simulated human digestion conditions. The findings showed that PEF did not change the properties of starch inside the potatoes, but it narrowed the temperature range of gelatinisation and reduced the digestibility of starch collected in the processing medium. Therefore, this study confirms that, when used as a processing aid for potato, PEF does not result in detrimental effects on the properties of potato starch.",Development and Evaluation of a Novel HNB Based Isothermal Amplification Assay for Fast Detection of Pyrimethamine Resistance (S108N) in Plasmodium falciparum.,https://www.ncbi.nlm.nih.gov/pubmed/31083343,International journal of environmental research and public health,2019 06 10,"Sulphadoxine and pyrimethamine (SP) have been used as long-acting partner antimalarial drugs in artemisinin combination therapy (ACT) for falciparum malaria. The emergence and increasing spread of SP resistance in malaria-endemic areas have become a challenge for the control of malaria. Therefore, regular monitoring of the mutation status of partner drugs is important for the better management of drug policy. There are limitations with traditional molecular methods and there is an urgent need for an easy method for diagnosis of drug resistance. In this study we have introduced and developed a novel single nucleotide polymorphism loop-mediated isothermal amplification (SNP-LAMP) approach based on a hydroxynaphthol blue (HNB) indicator for the easier and quicker detection of pyrimethamine resistance in Plasmodium falciparum malaria. To implement this novel approach, many sets of LAMP primers were designed and tested. Finally, one set of forward inner primer M1 (FIPM1) of LAMP primer was selected that specifically distinguishes pyrimethamine-resistant P. falciparum malaria. The LAMP reactions were optimized at 60-66 Â°C for 45 min. High sensitivity (7 parasites/ÂµL) was observed with 10-4 fold dilutions (<2 ng DNA) of genomic DNA. Moreover, this approach has the potential to be applied even in laboratories unfamiliar with PCR or other molecular methods, and in future, this can be helpful for the better management of anti-malarial policy.",The Role of Mast Cells in Stroke.,https://www.ncbi.nlm.nih.gov/pubmed/31083342,Cells,2019 05 14,"Mast cells (MCs) are densely granulated perivascular resident cells of hematopoietic origin. Through the release of preformed mediators stored in their granules and newly synthesized molecules, they are able to initiate, modulate, and prolong the immune response upon activation. Their presence in the central nervous system (CNS) has been documented for more than a century. Over the years, MCs have been associated with various neuroinflammatory conditions of CNS, including stroke. They can exacerbate CNS damage in models of ischemic and hemorrhagic stroke by amplifying the inflammatory responses and promoting brain-blood barrier disruption, brain edema, extravasation, and hemorrhage. Here, we review the role of these peculiar cells in the pathophysiology of stroke, in both immature and adult brain. Further, we discuss the role of MCs as potential targets for the treatment of stroke and the compounds potentially active as MCs modulators.",Preparation of Thermoplastic Polyurethane (TPU) Perforated Membrane via CO2 Foaming and Its Particle Separation Performance.,https://www.ncbi.nlm.nih.gov/pubmed/31083341,Polymers,2019 05 14,"The way in which a perforated structure is formed has attracted much interest in the porous membrane research community. This novel structure gives materials an excellent antifouling property as well as a low operating pressure and other benefits. Unfortunately, the current membrane fabrication methods usually involve multi-step processes and the use of organic solvents or additives. Our study is the first to offer a way to prepare perforated membrane by using a physical foaming technique with CO2 as the blowing agent. We selected thermoplastic polyurethane (TPU) as the base material because it is a biocompatible elastomer with excellent tensility, high abrasion resistance, and good elastic resilience. Various processing parameters, which included the saturation pressure, the foaming temperature, and the membrane thickness, were applied to adjust the TPU membrane's perforated morphology. We proposed a possible formation mechanism of the perforated membrane. The as-prepared TPU membrane had good mechanical properties with a tensile strength of about 5 MPa and an elongation at break above 100%. Such mechanical properties make this novel membrane usable as a self-standing filter device. In addition, its straight-through channel structure can separate particles and meet different separation requirements.",Design and Performance Test of Transformer Winding Optical Fibre Composite Wire Based on Raman Scattering.,https://www.ncbi.nlm.nih.gov/pubmed/31083340,"Sensors (Basel, Switzerland)",2019 06 10,"Winding overheating is a common fault in a transformer. To detect the temperature, the most widely used method is a point-type measurement, but traditional measurement methods cannot obtain the whole temperature distribution in a transformer. Taking this into consideration, a new method with which to measure the temperature of transformer windings was proposed. Based on Raman scattering, a new fibre-optic composite winding model was developed. The feasibility of the model was verified by electrical as well as temperature, field simulation and power frequency resistance testing. To assess the practicality and accuracy of the new model, a distributed optical fibre temperature measurement platform was built, and a series of experiments were designed. According to the data collected, the temperature measurement error based on the method could be limited to 1 Â°C while the positioning accuracy error was within 1 m, which meant that the new approach can satisfy the requirements of transformer winding temperature measurement and locate hot spots in the winding."

One such model is the graded autocatalysis replication domain (GARD) formalism embodied in a lipid world scenario, which offers rigorous computer simulation based on defined chemical kinetics equations. GARD suggests that the first pre-RNA life-like entities could have been homeostatically-growing assemblies of amphiphiles, undergoing compositional replication and mutations, as well as rudimentary selection and evolution. Recent progress in molecular dynamics has provided an experimental tool to study complex biological phenomena such as protein folding, ligand-receptor interactions, and micellar formation, growth, and fission. The detailed molecular definition of GARD and its inter-molecular catalytic interactions make it highly compatible with molecular dynamics analyses. We present a roadmap for simulating GARD's kinetic and thermodynamic behavior using various molecular dynamics methodologies. We review different approaches for testing the validity of the GARD model by following micellar accretion and fission events and examining compositional changes over time. Near-future computational advances could provide empirical delineation for further system complexification, from simple compositional non-covalent assemblies towards more life-like protocellular entities with covalent chemistry that underlies metabolism and genetic encoding.",Neutrophil Immunomodulatory Activity of Natural Organosulfur Compounds.,https://www.ncbi.nlm.nih.gov/pubmed/31083328,"Molecules (Basel, Switzerland)",2019 06 10,"Organosulfur compounds are bioactive components of garlic essential oil (EO), mustard oil, Ferula EOs, asafoetida, and other plant and food extracts. Traditionally, garlic (Allium sativum) is used to boost the immune system; however, the mechanisms involved in the putative immunomodulatory effects of garlic are unknown. We investigated the effects of garlic EO and 22 organosulfur compounds on human neutrophil responses. Garlic EO, allyl propyl disulfide, dipropyl disulfide, diallyl disulfide, and allyl isothiocyanate (AITC) directly activated Ca2+ flux in neutrophils, with the most potent being AITC. Although 1,3-dithiane did not activate neutrophil Ca2+ flux, this minor constituent of garlic EO stimulated neutrophil reactive oxygen species (ROS) production. In contrast, a close analog (1,4-dithiane) was unable to activate neutrophil ROS production. Although 1,3-dithiane-1-oxide also stimulated neutrophil ROS production, only traces of this oxidation product were generated after a 5 h treatment of HL60 cells with 1,3-dithiane. Evaluation of several phosphatidylinositol-3 kinase (PI3K) inhibitors with different subtype specificities (A-66, TGX 221, AS605240, and PI 3065) showed that the PI3K p110Î´ inhibitor PI 3065 was the most potent inhibitor of 1,3-dithiane-induced neutrophil ROS production. Furthermore, 1,3-dithiane enhanced the phosphorylation of extracellular signal-regulated kinase 1/2 (ERK1/2), glycogen synthase kinase 3 Î±/Î² (GSK-3Î±/Î²), and cAMP response element binding (CREB) protein in differentiated neutrophil-like HL60 cells. Density functional theory (DFT) calculations confirmed the reactivity of 1,3-dithiane vs. 1,4-dithiane, based on the frontier molecular orbital analysis. Our results demonstrate that certain organosulfur compounds can activate neutrophil functional activity and may serve as biological response modifiers by augmenting phagocyte functions.",Natural Compounds for Alzheimer's Disease Therapy: A Systematic Review of Preclinical and Clinical Studies.,https://www.ncbi.nlm.nih.gov/pubmed/31083327,International journal of molecular sciences,2019 06 10,"Alzheimer's Disease (AD) is a neurodegenerative disorder related with the increase of age and it is the main cause of dementia in the world. AD affects cognitive functions, such as memory, with an intensity that leads to several functional losses. The continuous increase of AD incidence demands for an urgent development of effective therapeutic strategies. Despite the extensive research on this disease, only a few drugs able to delay the progression of the disease are currently available. In the last years, several compounds with pharmacological activities isolated from plants, animals and microorganisms, revealed to have beneficial effects for the treatment of AD, targeting different pathological mechanisms. Thus, a wide range of natural compounds may play a relevant role in the prevention of AD and have proven to be efficient in different preclinical and clinical studies. This work aims to review the natural compounds that until this date were described as having significant benefits for this neurological disease, focusing on studies that present clinical trials.",Conditions Leading to Elevated PM2.5 at Near-Road Monitoring Sites: Case Studies in Denver and Indianapolis.,https://www.ncbi.nlm.nih.gov/pubmed/31083326,International journal of environmental research and public health,2019 06 10,"We examined two near-road monitoring sites where the daily PM2.5 readings were among the highest of any near-road monitoring location in the U.S. during 2014-2016: Denver, Colorado, in February 2014 and Indianapolis, Indiana, in November 2016. At the Denver site, which had the highest measured U.S. near-road 24-hr PM2.5 concentrations in 2014, concentrations exceeded the daily National Ambient Air Quality Standards (NAAQS) on three days during one week in 2014; the Indianapolis site had the second-highest number of daily exceedances of any near-road site in 2016 and the highest 3-year average PM2.5 of any near-road site during 2014-2016. Both sites had hourly pollutant, meteorological, and traffic data available, making them ideal for case studies. For both locations, we compared air pollution observations at the near-road site to observations at other sites in the urban area to calculate the near-road PM2.5 ""increment"" and evaluated the effects of changes in meteorology and traffic. The Denver near-road site consistently had the highest PM2.5 values in the Denver area, and was typically highest when winds were near-downwind, rather than directly downwind, to the freeway. Complex Denver site conditions (near-road buildings and roadway alignment) likely contributed to higher PM2.5 concentrations. The increment at Indianapolis was also highest under near-downwind, rather than directly downwind, conditions. At both sites, while the near-road site often had higher PM2.5 concentrations than nearby sites, there was no clear correlation between traffic conditions (vehicle speed, fleet mix) and the high PM2.5 concentrations.","Grb7, a Critical Mediator of EGFR/ErbB Signaling, in Cancer Development and as a Potential Therapeutic Target.",https://www.ncbi.nlm.nih.gov/pubmed/31083325,Cells,2019 05 14,"The partner of activated epidermal growth factor receptor (EGFR), growth factor receptor bound protein-7 (Grb7), a functionally multidomain adaptor protein, has been demonstrated to be a pivotal regulator for varied physiological and pathological processes by interacting with phospho-tyrosine-related signaling molecules to affect the transmission through a number of signaling pathways. In particular, critical roles of Grb7 in erythroblastic leukemia viral oncogene homolog (ERBB) family-mediated cancer development and malignancy have been intensively evaluated. The overexpression of Grb7 or the coamplification/cooverexpression of Grb7 and members of the ERBB family play essential roles in advanced human cancers and are associated with decreased survival and recurrence of cancers, emphasizing Grb7's value as a prognostic marker and a therapeutic target. Peptide inhibitors of Grb7 are being tested in preclinical trials for their possible therapeutic effects.

Thyroid H2O2 is generated by a member of the family of NADPH oxidase enzymes (NOX-es), termed dual oxidase 2 (DUOX2). NOX/DUOX enzymes produce reactive oxygen species (ROS) as their unique enzymatic activity in a timely and spatially regulated manner and therefore, are important regulators of diverse physiological processes. By contrast, dysfunctional NOX/DUOX-derived ROS production is associated with pathological conditions. Inappropriate DUOX2-generated H2O2 production results in thyroid hypofunction in rodent models. Recent studies also indicate that ROS improperly released by NOX4, another member of the NOX family, are involved in thyroid carcinogenesis. This review focuses on the current knowledge concerning the redox regulation of thyroid hormonogenesis and cancer development with a specific emphasis on the NOX and DUOX enzymes in these processes.","Mitochondrial Function, Mobility and Lifespan Are Improved in Drosophila melanogaster by Extracts of 9-cis-Î²-Carotene from Dunaliella salina.",https://www.ncbi.nlm.nih.gov/pubmed/31083322,Marine drugs,2019 05 14,"Carotenoids are implicated in alleviating ageing and age-related diseases in humans.

It also resulted in improved mobility. These data provide a potential biological rational for the beneficial effects of dietary supplementation with 9-cis-Î²-carotene. These effects may be based on the maintenance of a sound mitochondrial function.",Intestinal Inflammation in Children with Cystic Fibrosis Is Associated with Crohn's-Like Microbiota Disturbances.,https://www.ncbi.nlm.nih.gov/pubmed/31083321,Journal of clinical medicine,2019 05 14,"Cystic fibrosis (CF) is a systemic genetic disease that leads to pulmonary and digestive disorders. In the majority of CF patients, the intestine is the site of chronic inflammation and microbiota disturbances. The link between gut inflammation and microbiota dysbiosis is still poorly understood. The main objective of this study was to assess gut microbiota composition in CF children depending on their intestinal inflammation. We collected fecal samples from 20 children with CF. Fecal calprotectin levels were measured and fecal microbiota was analyzed by 16S rRNA sequencing. We observed intestinal inflammation was associated with microbiota disturbances characterized mainly by increased abundances of Staphylococcus, Streptococcus, and Veillonella dispar, along with decreased abundances of Bacteroides, Bifidobacteriumadolescentis, and Faecalibacterium prausnitzii. Those changes exhibited similarities with that of Crohn's disease (CD), as evidenced by the elevated CD Microbial-Dysbiosis index that we applied for the first time in CF. Furthermore, the significant over-representation of Streptococcus in children with intestinal inflammation appears to be specific to CF and raises the issue of gut-lung axis involvement. Taken together, our results provide new arguments to link gut microbiota and intestinal inflammation in CF and suggest the key role of the gut-lung axis in the CF evolution.",A Power Supply Technology for a Low-Power Online Monitoring Sensor Based on Electric Field Induction.,https://www.ncbi.nlm.nih.gov/pubmed/31083320,"Sensors (Basel, Switzerland)",2019 06 10,"In order to provide a safe and stable power supply for low-power online monitoring sensors of transmission lines, a method of harvesting space electric field energy by using the impedance conversion characteristics of the transformer and the reactive compensation characteristics of the capacitor is proposed.

In this paper, the principle of power supply technology based on electric field induction is described in detail, and the influencing factors such as the wire erection mode, polar plate installation position, and capacitance compensation characteristics are simulated and tested. The test results show that when the power supply voltage is 50 kV, the stray capacitance is 14 pF, the compensation capacitance is 0.86 nF, and the load resistance is 1 kÎ©, the energy-harvesting power is 340 mW.

In the present study, mature Streptococcus mutans biofilms were treated with chitosan dispersion (CD) or chitosan microparticles (CM). (2) Methods: CD at 0.25% and 1% were characterized by texture analysis, while CD at 2% was spray-dried to form CM, which were characterized with respect to particle size distribution, zeta potential, and morphology. After determining the minimum inhibitory and bactericidal concentrations, S. mutans biofilms were grown on glass slides exposed 8Ã/day to 10% sucrose and 2Ã/day to CD or CM at 0.25% and 1%. Biofilm viability and acidogenicity were determined, using appropriate control groups for each experiment. (3) Results: CD had high viscosity and CM were spherical, with narrow size distribution and positive zeta potential. CM affected bacterial viability and acidogenicity in mature S. mutans biofilms more strongly than CD, especially at 1%. (4) Conclusions: Both chitosan forms exerted antimicrobial effect against mature S. mutans biofilms. CM at 1% can reduce bacterial viability and acidogenicity more effectively than CD at 1%, and thereby be more effective to control the growth of mature biofilms in vitro.",Development of Diallylimidazolium Methoxyacetate/DMSO (DMF/DMA) Solvents for Improving Cellulose Dissolution and Fabricating Porous Material.,https://www.ncbi.nlm.nih.gov/pubmed/31083305,Polymers,2019 05 14,"Cellulose is the most abundant natural biopolymer, with unique properties such as biodegradability, biocompability, nontoxicity, and so on. However, its extensive application has actually been hindered, because of its insolubility in water and most solvents. Herein, highly efficient cellulose solvents were developed by coupling diallylimidazolium methoxyacetate ([A2im][CH3OCH2COO]) with polar aprotic solvents dimethyl sulfoxide (DMSO), N,N-dimethylformamide (DMF), and N,N-dimethylacetamide (DMA). Attractively, these solvents showed extraordinarily powerful dissolution performance for cellulose (e.g., 26.1 gÂ·100g-1) in [A2im][CH3OCH2COO]/DMSO(RDMSO = 1.01 solvent even at 25 Â°C), which is much more advantageous over previously reported solvents. To our knowledge, such powerful cellulose solvents have not been reported before. The cellulose dissolution mechanism is proposed to be of three combined factors: (1) The hydrogen bond interactions of the H2, H4 and H6 in [A2im]+ and the carboxyl O atom in [CH3OCH2COO]-, along with the hydroxyl H atom and O atom in cellulose, are main driving force for cellulose dissolution; (2) the dissociation of [A2im][CH3OCH2COO] by DMF increases the anion and cation concentrations and thus promotes cellulose dissolution; (3) at the same time, DMF also stabilizes the dissolved cellulose chains. Meanwhile, the porous cellulose material with a varying morphologic structure could be facially fabricated by modulating the cellulose solution concentration. Additionally, the dissolution of cellulose in the solvents is only a physical process, and the regenerated cellulose from the solvents retains sufficient thermostability and a chemical structure similar to the original cellulose. Thus, this work will provide great possibility for developing cellulose-based products at ambient temperatures or under no extra heating/freezing conditions.",Efficient Hydrophobic Modification of Old Newspaper and Its Application in Paper Fiber Reinforced Composites.,https://www.ncbi.nlm.nih.gov/pubmed/31083304,Polymers,2019 05 14,"Paper fibers have gained broad attention in natural fiber reinforced composites in recent years. The specific problem in preparing paper fiber reinforced composites is that paper fibers easily become flocculent after pulverization, which increases difficulties during melt-compounding with polymer matrix and results in non-uniform dispersion of paper fibers in the matrix. In this study, old newspaper (ONP) was treated with a low dosage of gaseous methyltrichlorosilane (MTCS) to solve the flocculation. The modified ONP fibers were characterized by Scanning Electron Microscope (SEM), Fourier Transform Infrared Spectroscopy (FTIR), and Thermogravimetric Analysis (TG). Then the modified ONP fibers and high-density polyethylene (HDPE) were extruded and pelletized to prepare ONP/HDPE composites via injection molding. Maleic anhydride-grafted polyethylene (MAPE) was added to enhance the interfacial bonding performance with the ultimate purpose of improving the mechanical strength of the composites. The mechanical properties such as tensile, flexural, and impact strength and the water absorption properties of the composite were tested. The results showed that the formation of hydrogen bonding between ONP fibers was effectively prevented after MTCS treatment due to the reduction of exposed -OH groups at the fiber surface. Excessive dosage of MTCS led to severe fiber degradation and dramatically reduced the aspect ratio of ONP fibers. Composites prepared with ONP fibers modified with 4% (v/w) MTCS showed the best mechanical properties due to reduced polarity between the fibers and the matrix, and the relatively long aspect ratio of treated ONP fibers. The composite with or without MAPE showed satisfactory water resistance properties. MTCS was proven to be a cheap and efficient way to pretreat old newspaper for preparing paper fiber reinforced composites.",Parvovirus B19 Uncoating Occurs in the Cytoplasm without Capsid Disassembly and It Is Facilitated by Depletion of Capsid-Associated Divalent Cations.,https://www.ncbi.nlm.nih.gov/pubmed/31083301,Viruses,2019 05 14,"Human parvovirus B19 (B19V) traffics to the cell nucleus where it delivers the genome for replication. The intracellular compartment where uncoating takes place, the required capsid structural rearrangements and the cellular factors involved remain unknown. We explored conditions that trigger uncoating in vitro and found that prolonged exposure of capsids to chelating agents or to buffers with chelating properties induced a structural rearrangement at 4 Â°C resulting in capsids with lower density. These lighter particles remained intact but were unstable and short exposure to 37 Â°C or to a freeze-thaw cycle was sufficient to trigger DNA externalization without capsid disassembly. The rearrangement was not observed in the absence of chelating activity or in the presence of MgCl2 or CaCl2, suggesting that depletion of capsid-associated divalent cations facilitates uncoating. The presence of assembled capsids with externalized DNA was also detected during B19V entry in UT7/Epo cells. Following endosomal escape and prior to nuclear entry, a significant proportion of the incoming capsids rearranged and externalized the viral genome without capsid disassembly. The incoming capsids with accessible genomes accumulated in the nuclear fraction, a process that was prevented when endosomal escape or dynein function was disrupted. In their uncoated conformation, capsids immunoprecipitated from cytoplasmic or from nuclear fractions supported in vitro complementary-strand synthesis at 37 Â°C. This study reveals an uncoating strategy of B19V based on a limited capsid rearrangement prior to nuclear entry, a process that can be mimicked in vitro by depletion of divalent cations.",3-Methylcholanthrene Induces Chylous Ascites in TCDD-Inducible Poly-ADP-Ribose Polymerase (Tiparp) Knockout Mice.,https://www.ncbi.nlm.nih.gov/pubmed/31083300,International journal of molecular sciences,2019 06 10,"TCDD-inducible poly-ADP-ribose polymerase (TIPARP) is an aryl hydrocarbon receptor (AHR) target gene that functions as part of a negative feedback loop to repress AHR activity. Tiparp-/- mice exhibit increased sensitivity to the toxicological effects of 2,3,7,8-tetrachlorodibenzo-p-dioxin (TCDD), including lethal wasting syndrome. However, it is not known whether Tiparp-/- mice also exhibit increased sensitivity to other AHR ligands. In this study, we treated male Tiparp-/- or wild type (WT) mice with a single injection of 100 mg/kg 3-methylcholanthrene (3MC). Consistent with TIPARP's role as a repressor of AHR signaling, 3MC-treated Tiparp-/- mice exhibited increased hepatic Cyp1a1 and Cyp1b1 levels compared with WT mice. No 3MC-treated Tiparp-/- mice survived beyond day 16 and the mice exhibited chylous ascites characterized by an accumulation of fluid in the peritoneal cavity. All WT mice survived the 30-day treatment and showed no signs of fluid accumulation. Treated Tiparp-/- mice also exhibited a transient and mild hepatotoxicity with inflammation. 3MC-treated WT, but not Tiparp-/- mice, developed mild hepatic steatosis. Lipid deposits accumulated on the surface of the liver and other abdominal organs in the 3MC-Tiparp-/- mice. Our study reveals that Tiparp-/- mice have increased sensitivity to 3MC-induced liver toxicity, but unlike with TCDD, lethality is due to chylous ascites rather than wasting syndrome.",Quantifying Urban Spatial Variations of Anthropogenic VOC Concentrations and Source Contributions with a Mobile Sampling Platform.,https://www.ncbi.nlm.nih.gov/pubmed/31083299,International journal of environmental research and public health,2019 06 10,"Volatile organic compounds (VOCs) are important atmospheric constituents because they contribute to formation of ozone and secondary aerosols, and because some VOCs are toxic air pollutants. We measured concentrations of a suite of anthropogenic VOCs during summer and winter at 70 locations representing different microenvironments around Pittsburgh, PA. The sampling sites were classified both by land use (e.g., high versus low traffic) and grouped based on geographic similarity and proximity. There was roughly a factor of two variation in both total VOC and single-ring aromatic VOC concentrations across the site groups. Concentrations were roughly 25% higher in winter than summer. Source apportionment with positive matrix factorization reveals that the major VOC sources are gasoline vehicles, solvent evaporation, diesel vehicles, and two factors attributed to industrial emissions. While we expected to observe significant spatial variability in the source impacts across the sampling domain, we instead found that source impacts were relatively homogeneous.",The Association of Black Cardiologists (ABC) Cardiovascular Implementation Study (CVIS): A Research Registry Integrating Social Determinants to Support Care for Underserved Patients.,https://www.ncbi.nlm.nih.gov/pubmed/31083298,International journal of environmental research and public health,2019 06 10,"African Americans, other minorities and underserved populations are consistently under- represented in clinical trials. Such underrepresentation results in a gap in the evidence base, and health disparities. The ABC Cardiovascular Implementation Study (CVIS) is a comprehensive prospective cohort registry that integrates social determinants of health. ABC CVIS uses real world clinical practice data to address critical gaps in care by facilitating robust participation of African Americans and other minorities in clinical trials. ABC CVIS will include diverse patients from collaborating ABC member private practices, as well as patients from academic health centers and Federally Qualified Health Centers (FQHCs). This paper describes the rationale and design of the ABC CVIS Registry. The registry will: (1) prospectively collect socio-demographic, clinical and biospecimen data from enrolled adults, adolescents and children with prioritized cardiovascular diseases; (2) Evaluate the safety and clinical outcomes of new therapeutic agents, including post marketing surveillance and pharmacovigilance; (3) Support National Institutes of Health (NIH) and industry sponsored research; (4) Support Quality Measures standards from the Center for Medicare and Medicaid Services (CMS) and Commercial Health Plans. The registry will utilize novel data and technology tools to facilitate mobile health technology application programming interface (API) to health system or practice electronic health records (EHR). Long term, CVIS will become the most comprehensive patient registry for underserved diverse patients with cardiovascular disease (CVD) and co morbid conditions, providing real world data to address health disparities. At least 10,000 patients will be enrolled from 50 sites across the United States.",Flying Small Target Detection for Anti-UAV Based on a Gaussian Mixture Model in a Compressive Sensing Domain.,https://www.ncbi.nlm.nih.gov/pubmed/31083296,"Sensors (Basel, Switzerland)",2019 06 10,"Addressing the problems of visual surveillance for anti-UAV, a new flying small target detection method is proposed based on Gaussian mixture background modeling in a compressive sensing domain and low-rank and sparse matrix decomposition of local image. First of all, images captured by stationary visual sensors are broken into patches and the candidate patches which perhaps contain targets are identified by using a Gaussian mixture background model in a compressive sensing domain. Subsequently, the candidate patches within a finite time period are separated into background images and target images by low-rank and sparse matrix decomposition. Finally, flying small target detection is achieved over separated target images by threshold segmentation. The experiment results using visible and infrared image sequences of flying UAV demonstrate that the proposed methods have effective detection performance and outperform the baseline methods in precision and recall evaluation.",Structure-Based Approach for the Prediction of Mu-opioid Binding Affinity of Unclassified Designer Fentanyl-Like Molecules.,https://www.ncbi.nlm.nih.gov/pubmed/31083294,International journal of molecular sciences,2019 06 10,"Three quantitative structure-activity relationship (QSAR) models for predicting the affinity of mu-opioid receptor (OR) ligands have been developed. The resulted models, exploiting the accessibility of the QSAR modeling, generate a useful tool for the investigation and identification of unclassified fentanyl-like structures. The models have been built using a set of 115 molecules using Forge as a software, and the quality was confirmed by statistical analysis, resulting in being effective for their predictive and descriptive capabilities. The three different approaches were then combined to produce a consensus model and were exploited to explore the chemical landscape of 3000 fentanyl-like structures, generated by a theoretical scaffold-hopping approach. The findings of this study should facilitate the identification and classification of new OR ligands with fentanyl-like structures.",A Monte Carlo Emissivity Model for Wind-Roughened Sea Surface.,https://www.ncbi.nlm.nih.gov/pubmed/31083293,"Sensors (Basel, Switzerland)",2019 06 10,"Sea surface emissivity (SSE) is a key variable in the estimation of sea surface temperature and the sea surface radiation budget. A physical base SSE model with adequate accuracy and acceptable computational efficiency is highly desired. This paper develops a Monte Carlo ray-tracing model to compute the SSE of a wind-roughened sea surface. The adoption of a two-dimensional continuous surface model and averaging the two polarization components in advance before ray-tracing gives the model acceptable computational efficiency. The developed model can output the contributions of direct emission and the reflected component to the effective emissivity. The contribution of the reflected component to the effective emissivity reaches 0.035 at an 80Â° emission angle for a wind speed larger than 10 m/s. The emissivity spectra and channel emissivities collected from two field campaigns and one set of outdoor measurements are used to validate the developed model. Statistical results indicate that the absolute value of bias or difference is less than 0.5% when the view angle is less than 65Â°, which means the retrieval accuracy of sea surface temperature (SST) is guaranteed from the view of SSE. When the view angle increases, the accuracy of the developed model degraded, especially at the view angle of 85Â°. Without considering this view angle, the absolute value of bias or difference is less than 0.016, and the root mean square difference (RMSD) is less than 0.018."

Complex mechanisms controlling this delicate balance in immune cells and consequent restriction of HSV-1 infection in these cells have not been completely elucidated. We have recently demonstrated that the transcription factor nuclear factor kappa B (NF-ÎºB) can act as a main permissiveness regulator of HSV-1 infection in monocytic cells, however, mediators involved in this regulation have not been identified. To better define mechanisms involved in this phenomenon and, particularly, the possible involvement of ROS, wild type U937 cells or U937 cells stably transfected with a dominant-negative (DN) IÎºB-mutant and selenium-containing compounds, as anti-oxidants, were utilized. The main results can be summarized as follows. HSV-1 infection induces an immediate ROS production in U937 monocytic cells that can efficiently activate NF-ÎºB but not in DN-IÎºB-mutant cells. Treatment with selenium-containing antioxidants efficiently inhibited HSV-1-induced ROS generation while producing increased levels of HSV-1 replication and a reduction of HSV-1-induced NF-ÎºB activation in U937 monocytic cells. Our results suggest a scenario in which an efficient NF-ÎºB-dependent ROS production in response to infection could contribute in limiting HSV-1 replication in monocytes/macrophages, thus avoiding possible irreparable damage to the innate immune system of the host during HSV-1 infection.",Oncogenic Effect of the Novel Fusion Gene VAPA-Rab31 in Lung Adenocarcinoma.,https://www.ncbi.nlm.nih.gov/pubmed/31083279,International journal of molecular sciences,2019 06 10,"Fusion genes have been identified as oncogenes in several solid tumors including lung, colorectal, and stomach cancers. Here, we characterized the fusion gene, VAPA-Rab31, discovered from RNA-sequencing data of a patient with lung adenocarcinoma who did not harbor activating mutations in EGFR, KRAS and ALK. This fusion gene encodes a protein comprising the N-terminal region of vesicle-associated membrane protein (VAMP)-associated protein A (VAPA) fused to the C-terminal region of Ras-related protein 31 (Rab31). Exogenous expression of VAPA-Rab31 in immortalized normal bronchial epithelial cells demonstrated the potential transforming effects of this fusion gene, including increased colony formation and cell proliferation in vitro. Also, enhanced tumorigenicity upon VAPA-Rab31 was confirmed in vivo using a mouse xenograft model. Metastatic tumors were also detected in the liver and lungs of xenografted mice. Overexpression of VAPA-Rab31 upregulated anti-apoptotic protein Bcl-2 and phosphorylated CREB both in cells and xenograft tumors. Reduced apoptosis and increased phosphorylation of CREB and Erk were observed in VAPA-Rab31-overexpressing cells after bortezomib treatment. Elevated Bcl-2 level via activated CREB contributed to the resistance to the bortezomib-induced apoptosis. Our data suggest the oncogenic function of the novel fusion gene VAPA-Rab31 via upregulated Bcl-2 and activated CREB in lung cancer.",Enhancing Chlorobenzene Biodegradation by Delftia tsuruhatensis Using a Water-Silicone Oil Biphasic System.,https://www.ncbi.nlm.nih.gov/pubmed/31083278,International journal of environmental research and public health,2019 06 10,"In this study, a water-silicone oil biphasic system was developed to enhance the biodegradation of monochlorobenzene (CB) by Delftia tsuruhatensis LW26. Compared to the single phase, the biphasic system with a suitable silicone oil fraction (v/v) of 20% allowed a 2.5-fold increase in the maximum tolerated CB concentration. The CB inhibition on D. tsuruhatensis LW26 was reduced in the presence of silicone oil, and the electron transport system activity was maintained at high levels even under high CB stress. Adhesion of cells to the water-oil interface at the water side was observed using confocal laser scanning microscopy. Nearly 75% of cells accumulated on the interface, implying that another interfacial substrate uptake pathway prevailed besides that initiated by cells in the aqueous phase. The 8-fold increase in cell surface hydrophobicity upon the addition of 20% (v/v) silicone oil showed that silicone oil modified the surface characteristics of D. tsuruhatensis LW26. The protein/polysaccharide ratio of extracellular polymeric substances (EPS) from D. tsuruhatensis LW26 presented a 3-fold enhancement. These results suggested that silicone oil induced the increase in the protein content of EPS and rendered cells hydrophobic. The resulting hydrophobic cells could adhere on the water-oil interface, improving the mass transfer by direct CB uptake from silicone oil.",Consistent Differences in Field Leaf Water-Use Efficiency among Soybean Cultivars.,https://www.ncbi.nlm.nih.gov/pubmed/31083277,"Plants (Basel, Switzerland)",2019 05 14,"High intrinsic water-use efficiency (WUEi), the ratio of leaf photosynthesis to stomatal conductance, may be a useful trait in adapting crops to water-limited environments. In soybean, cultivar differences in stomatal response to vapor pressure deficit have not consistently translated into differences in WUEi in the field. In this study, six cultivars of soybeans previously shown to differ in WUEi in indoor experiments were grown in the field in Beltsville, Maryland, and tested for mid-day WUEi on nine clear days during the mid-seasons of two years. Measurement dates were chosen for diverse temperatures, and air temperatures ranged from 21 to 34 Â°C on the different dates. Air saturation deficits for water vapor ranged from 0.9 to 2.2 kPa. Corrected carbon isotope delta values for 13C (CID) were determined on mature, upper canopy leaves harvested during early pod filling each year. WUEi differed among cultivars in both years and the differences were consistent across measurement dates. Correlations between mean WUEi and CID were not significant in either year. It is concluded that consistent cultivar differences in WUEi exist in these soybean cultivars under field conditions, but that carbon isotope ratios may not be useful in identifying them because of cultivar differences in mesophyll conductance.",ATP binding cassette subfamily B member 9 (ABCB9) is a prognostic indicator of overall survival in ovarian cancer.,https://www.ncbi.nlm.nih.gov/pubmed/31083274,Medicine,2019 05 30,"Ovarian cancer (OC) is one of the most common gynecological malignancies and owns the highest mortality rate among all gynecological malignant tumors.

However, the potential role of ABCB9 in OC has never been reported.In this study, ABCB9 expression was evaluated in normal ovarian tissues and ovarian cancer tissues using The Cancer Genome Atlas (TCGA) database. And the associations between ABCB9 expression and clinical parameters of patients of OC were evaluated by Chi-square tests. Kaplan-Meier analysis and Cox regression analysis were performed to evaluate the prognostic significance of ABCB9. GSEA was performed to explore related signaling pathway.ABCB9 expression levels were significantly decreased in OC compared with normal ovarian tissues (Pâ<â.001). Low ABCB9 expression was associated with survival status (Pâ=â.0148) in OC. Kaplan-Meier analysis showed that low ABCB9 expression was associated with poor overall survival in OC (Pâ=â.0032). Multivariable Cox regression analysis indicated that low ABCB9 expression was an independent prognostic factor (HR 0.64; Pâ=â.01) in OC patients. Besides, epithelial mesenchymal transition, UV response, and TGF-Î² signaling were enriched in low ABCB9 expression phenotype, respectively, examined by gene set enrichment analysis.These results suggest that ABCB9 is an independent prognostic indicator in OC with certain clinical significance.",Anesthetic management for a patient with bronchobiliary fistula after pancreaticoduodenectomy: A case report.,https://www.ncbi.nlm.nih.gov/pubmed/31083273,Medicine,2019 05 30,"Perioperative management of patients with bronchobiliary fistula (BBF) is an anesthetic challenge because they typically exhibit poor lung function preoperatively, require meticulous lung isolation intraoperatively and need postoperative respiratory support.",Chemotherapy-induced posterior reversible encephalopathy syndrome: Three case reports.,https://www.ncbi.nlm.nih.gov/pubmed/31083272,Medicine,2019 05 30,"Posterior reversible encephalopathy syndrome (PRES) has been associated with the use of several medications, including chemotherapeutic agents.",Obesity and metabolic syndrome in children in Brazil: The challenge of lifestyle change.,https://www.ncbi.nlm.nih.gov/pubmed/31083270,Medicine,2019 05 30,"The purpose of this observational study was to examine the prevalence of obesity in children of 6 to 8 years of age from primary public schools over a period of 6 years and the associated environmental and metabolic health risk factors.This was a cohort observational study to investigate the prevalence of obesity in children from 14 state primary schools in Vinhedo, Sao Paulo state. Environmental and metabolic health risk factors for obesity were investigated in a cross-sectional survey.This present study revealed 74.0% of children with obesity consumed fried foods and sweets at school, and 84.0% consumed snacks and soft drinks at home. This cohort reported to have engaged in physical activity for less than 3âhours per week at school (93.0%) and at home (85.0%). There was a high prevalence of increased waist circumference and insulin resistance among children with obesity (84.9% and 84.5%, respectively). The body mass index had a significant Spearman correlation with waist circumference, insulin resistance, and triglycerides.Childhood obesity was associated with a high prevalence of both environmental and metabolic risk factors. Also, the authors conclude that the lack of parents' awareness of childhood obesity and its risk factors represents a substantial barrier to lifestyle counseling.","Low serum bilirubin, albumin, and uric acid levels in patients with Crohn's disease.",https://www.ncbi.nlm.nih.gov/pubmed/31083269,Medicine,2019 05 30,"Serum concentrations of bilirubin, albumin, and uric acid (UA) play important roles in controlling oxidative stress.

The aim of this study was to assess the occurrence of and predictive factors for the multifocality and bilaterality of PTMCs.We performed a retrospective review of 4716 consecutive patients with thyroid tumors. Of these patients, 434 (9.2%) had thyroid malignancies. All patients underwent thyroidectomies with central and/or lateral lymph node dissection between January 2008 and December 2017. PTMC was identified in 177 (3.75%) individuals.Solitary PTMC was observed in 114 (64.4%) patients, multifocal PTMC was seen in 48 (27.1%) patients, and bilateral PTMC was detected in 15 (8.5%) patients. The occurrence of solitary PTMC increased from 11.1% in 2008 to 61.9% in 2017.

The following IVCM parameters were recorded: the MG acinar density (MAD), MG acinar longest diameter (MALD), MG acinar shortest diameter (MASD), MG orifice area (MOA), severity of MG fibrosis (MF), MG acinar irregularity (MAI), meibum secretion reflectivity (MSR), inhomogeneous appearance of walls of acinar units (AWI) and periglandular interstices of acinar units (API), and the number of Demodex.The positive rate of Demodex infestation in MGDs was 89.32%, and statistically higher than control group (controls; Pâ<â.001). All parameters showed statistically significant differences between MGDs and controls (Pâ<â.001), and Demodex-negative group and Demodex-positive group (Pâ<â.05) in both MGDs and controls, except MAD (Pâ=â.826) in controls. The number of Demodex was positively correlated with MALD, MASD, MF, MAI, MSR, AWI, and API in MGDs and controls (Pâ<â.05), and negatively correlated with MAD and MOA in MGDs (Pâ<â.05). MOA showed a strong significant correlation with the number of Demodex in controls (Pâ<â.001), whereas there was no significant difference between the number of Demodex and the MAD in controls (Pâ=â.448).Demodex can cause microstructural changes of MGs, which can cause or aggravate MGD, and the more the number of Demodex infestation, the more serious the structural damage.",Biliary atresia combined with progressive familial intrahepatic cholestasis type 3: A case report and review of the literature.,https://www.ncbi.nlm.nih.gov/pubmed/31083246,Medicine,2019 06 03,Neonatal cholestasis is one of the most serious diseases in infancy.

Herein, we describe an unusual case of an avian influenza A (H7N9) infection with several severe mixed bacterial infections and systemic super-infection with Cryptococcus neoformans presenting as ventilator-associated pneumonia (VAP) and bloodstream infection in a previously immunocompetent man during hospitalization.A 58-year-old man was admitted to our hospital complaining of hyperpyrexia, dyspnoea, cough, and phlegm with blood. A chest computed tomography scan revealed multiple ground-glass opacities and consolidation in both lungs with right pleural effusion. An initial sputum test was positive for influenza A (H7N9) virus. After antiviral treatment and other supportive measures, the patient's condition improved. However, the patient's condition deteriorated again approximately 2 weeks after admission, and bronchoalveolar lavage fluid (BALF) and blood cultures were positive for C. neoformans. Therapy with intravenous liposomal amphotericin B and fluconazole was started. After a 2-week antifungal treatment, BALF and blood cultures were negative for C. neoformans. However, the patient had persistent lung infiltrates with severe pulmonary fibrosis with a prolonged course of disease. On hospital day 40, BALF and blood cultures were both positive for multidrug-resistant Stenotrophomonas maltophilia.

The LA classification of each patient was determined by endoscopy. HRM was performed by the intraluminal water infusion method. HRM and 24-hour esophageal pH monitoring parameters of the patients were studied and statistically compared.On HRM examination, GERD symptoms were found to be associated with worsened distal contractile integral (DCI), ineffective esophageal motility (IEM), peristalsis break (PB), lower esophageal sphincter (LES) pressure, and the 4-second integrated relaxation pressure (IRP4s) of LES pressure along with the grade of LA classification, especially in patients having grade C and D GERD who had transverse mucosal breaks. The 24-hour pH monitoring study revealed that patients classified as having grade C or D GERD had an esophageal pH < 4.0 for a longer time than those with grade O, A, or B GERD. Similar results were found regarding the duration of the longest reflux event, the number of reflux episodes longer than 5âminutes, and the number of reflux episodes. Patients with higher grade esophagitis had higher De Meester scores, which suggested greater esophageal acid exposure. Hiatal hernia (HH) was more closely related to LES pressure, IRP4s, and acid exposure, whereas DCI, IEM, and PB were not statistically different between patients with GERD with and without HH.Patients with severe esophagitis may have motor dysfunction not only in the LES but also in the esophageal body, with resulting increased esophageal acid exposure, which causes esophagitis. Low LES pressure might be the main reason that patients with HH develop esophagitis. GERD without HH may be due to a variety of motor dysfunctions.",Gradual replacement of all previously circulating respiratory syncytial virus A strain with the novel ON1 genotype in Lanzhou from 2010 to 2017.,https://www.ncbi.nlm.nih.gov/pubmed/31083208,Medicine,2019 05 20,"ON1 is a novel genotype of human respiratory syncytial virus (HRSV) subtype A, in children with acute respiratory tract infections (ARTIs).

ON1 is characterized by a 72-nt duplication in the C-terminal region of the highly variable attachment glycoprotein (G), predicted to lengthen the polypeptide with 24 amino acids, including a 23-aa duplication, which likely changes antigenicity. New N-glycosylation sites occurred within the 23-aa duplication and 24-aa insertion of the ON1 viruses in our study. Notably, RSV infections occurred later, but peaked sooner from the 2014/2015 to 2016/2017 epidemic seasons, compared with the previous 4 seasons.Our study concluded that genotype ON1 has caused larger outbreaks and became the predominate genotype for HRSV subgroup A in Lanzhou from 2013 to 2017, and became the sole genotype of RSV-A in 2015/2016 and 2016/2017. Our data indicate that northwest of China and the world will eventually be dominated by the ON1 RSV-A genotype, including the possibility for vaccine development.

Their isolated peripheral blood mononuclear cells were mitogen-activated and stained with fluorochrome-conjugated anti-CD4, anti-CD8, anti-interleukin (IL)-2, and anti-interferon (IFN)-Î³ antibodies for flow cytometry, and the plasma levels of cytokines, including IL-6, IFN-Î±2, IL-10, IL-8, GM-CSF, and monocyte chemoattractant protein (MCP)-1, were measured through enzyme-linked immunosorbent assay.The results demonstrated that regardless of the administration route, morphine delivery slightly reduced IL-2 expression in CD4 cells after activation, and the same effect was not noted for CD8 cells. Intravenous or epidural morphine tended to reduce IFN-Î³ expression in CD8 cells. Spinal and IV morphine substantially increased IL-6 production, whereas epidural morphine hindered IL-10 and GM-CSF production. IV morphine injection reduced MCP-1 production in plasma. Compared with spinal morphine, IV or epidural morphine may more effectively inhibit the expression of various cytokines and thus affect immune response.All 3 routes of morphine injection tended to decrease IL-2 production by CD4 cells, whereas IV or epidural morphine injection showed lower IFN-Î³ production by CD8 cells.

We aimed to define the ""safe zone"" on the quadrilateral surface to facilitate safe plate-screw placement.Twenty cadaveric hemipelves were sectioned and assembled to define the projection of the acetabular boundary on the quadrilateral surface. Three lines (X, Y, and Z) were drawn tangent to the projection, with X parallel to the iliopectineal line, Y perpendicular to the iliopectineal line, and Z parallel to the posterior border of the ischial body. Then, the distances between X and the iliopectineal line (D1), Y and the sacroiliac joint (D2), and Z and the posterior border of the ischium (D3) could be used to determine a ""safe zone"" on the quadrilateral surface for screw insertion. We included 15 patients whose conditions satisfied the definition of a comminuted quadrilateral plate fracture and applied two-ended buttress plates for treatment in accordance with this ""safe zone.""The average D1 was 50.0âmm, the average D2 was 30.6âmm, and the average D3 was 12.4âmm.

Progress has been made in all areas including regenerating bone, cartilage, soft tissue, and making up for bone defects with scaffolds. Bone regeneration and managing bone defects with scaffolds continue to be successful in the basic science realm with promising results, but currently, these successes are mostly limited to small animal models. Cartilage defects have more clinically available treatment options, but the benefits of ""off-the-shelf"" allograft options, and scaffolds, have little clinical evidence in the acute fracture setting. Most of the true chondrocyte replacement therapies such as matrix-induced autologous chondrocyte implantation and osteochondral allografts require delayed treatment while cell growth or graft matching occurs. Soft-tissue defects can be managed with tissue engineering for the skin with success, but muscle and nerve defects are still limited to the basic science arena. Although significant gains have been made in all areas for tissue engineering in basic science, and is very promising, this success currently comes with limited translation into clinical availability for the orthopaedic trauma patient.",Understanding Articular Cartilage Injury and Potential Treatments.,https://www.ncbi.nlm.nih.gov/pubmed/31083142,Journal of orthopaedic trauma,2019 05 14,"The goals of all orthopaedic surgeons treating articular cartilage injuries have been anatomic reduction and stable fixation of the articular cartilage surface with restoration of limb alignment and/or reestablishment of the joint stability, all while minimizing the risk of surgical complications. Recent developments in the study of articular cartilage injury have shown that there is a robust cellular response to joint injury. This response has been shown to involve the synoviocytes, chondrocytes, and osteocytes in and around the injured joint and if these responses are left unchecked, they can lead to the development of posttraumatic osteoarthritis (PTOA). Therefore, to predictably and successfully treat articular cartilage injuries, it is not sufficient to just restore articular congruity, limb alignment, and joint stability, but we must also recognize and attempt to mitigate this associated cellular response. Understanding not only the mechanical aspects of these joint injuries but also the biological aspects is paramount to giving our patients the best opportunity to heal their injuries, recover full function, and avoid the potential devastating development of PTOA. Gone is the simplistic view that if one can achieve articular congruity after intraarticular fracture, as well as joint stability after ligamentous injury, that our patients will do just fine. This review sheds new light on the molecular response to cartilage injury, how residual joint incongruity and instability affect the joint's ability to recover from injury, and how chondrocyte apoptosis in response to injury can influence joint. This article then briefly reviews how cellular and growth factors may be beneficial to the treatment of articular cartilage injury and how ultimately cartilage regeneration may be used in the future to salvage the joints ravaged by PTOA in response to injury.",Prevention of the Infected Fracture: Evidence-Based Strategies for Success!,https://www.ncbi.nlm.nih.gov/pubmed/31083141,Journal of orthopaedic trauma,2019 05 14,"There is a significant burden of disease associated with infected fractures, and their management is challenging.

Chronic kidney disease significantly increases the risk of adverse maternal and perinatal outcomes, and these risks increase with the severity of the underlying renal dysfunction, degree of proteinuria, as well as the frequent coexistence of hypertension. Further, renal anatomic changes result in dilatation of the collecting system, and physiologic adaptations include alterations in the balance of vasodilatory and vasoconstrictive hormones, resulting in decreased systemic and renal vascular resistance, increased glomerular filtration rate, and modifications in tubular function. These alterations have important clinical implications and can make the diagnosis of renal compromise challenging. The effect of pregnancy on kidney disease may manifest as a loss of renal function, particularly in the context of concomitant hypertension and proteinuria, and chronic kidney disease, even when mild, contributes to the high risk of adverse pregnancy outcomes, including increased risks of preeclampsia, preterm delivery, and small-for-gestational age neonates. Strategies for optimization of pregnancy outcomes include meticulous management of hypertension and proteinuria where possible and the initiation of preeclampsia prevention strategies, including aspirin. Avoidance of nephrotoxic and teratogenic medications is necessary, and renal dosing of commonly used medications must also be considered. Mode of delivery in women with chronic kidney disease should be based on usual obstetric indications, although more frequent prenatal assessments by an expert multidisciplinary team are desirable for the care of this particularly vulnerable patient population.

Traditionally, attention has been given to performance outcomes with less focus on the underlying mechanism(s). Putative physiological roles in human skeletal muscle include acting as an intracellular pH buffer, modulating energy metabolism, regulating Ca handling and myofilament sensitivity, and scavenging of reactive species. Emerging evidence shows that carnosine could also act as a cytoplasmic Ca-H exchanger and form stable conjugates with exercise-induced reactive aldehydes. The enigmatic nature of carnosine means there is still much to learn regarding its actions and applications in exercise, health and disease.

Despite cases of ORS reported throughout the world over the last century, our knowledge and understanding of ORS remain relatively poor because of the limited literature-mostly case studies and series, but no clinical trials. ORS continues to pose significant diagnostic challenges within our current frameworks of categorizing mental disorders, including the Diagnostic and Statistical Manual of Mental Disorders and International Classification of Diseases. We review the ORS literature and discuss diagnostic parallels and challenges of placing ORS within specific categories. We also review the current research on the neurocircuitry of olfaction and of disorders with potential clinical relevance to patients presenting with ORS. While no primary neuroscientific research has specifically investigated ORS, an overlapping circuitry has been implicated in the neurobiology of obsessive-compulsive, trauma and stressor, and psychotic spectrum disorders, suggesting that the phenomenology of ORS can best be understood through a dimensional, rather than categorical, approach.","The Amygdala in Schizophrenia and Bipolar Disorder: A Synthesis of Structural MRI, Diffusion Tensor Imaging, and Resting-State Functional Connectivity Findings.",https://www.ncbi.nlm.nih.gov/pubmed/31082993,Harvard review of psychiatry,2019 05 14,"Frequently implicated in psychotic spectrum disorders, the amygdala serves as an important hub for elucidating the convergent and divergent neural substrates in schizophrenia and bipolar disorder, the two most studied groups of psychotic spectrum conditions. A systematic search of electronic databases through December 2017 was conducted to identify neuroimaging studies of the amygdala in schizophrenia and bipolar disorder, focusing on structural MRI, diffusion tensor imaging (DTI), and resting-state functional connectivity studies, with an emphasis on cross-diagnostic studies. Ninety-four independent studies were selected for the present review (49 structural MRI, 27 DTI, and 18 resting-state functional MRI studies). Also selected, and analyzed in a separate meta-analysis, were 33 volumetric studies with the amygdala as the region-of-interest. Reduced left, right, and total amygdala volumes were found in schizophrenia, relative to both healthy controls and bipolar subjects, even when restricted to cohorts in the early stages of illness. No volume abnormalities were observed in bipolar subjects relative to healthy controls. Shape morphometry studies showed either amygdala deformity or no differences in schizophrenia, and no abnormalities in bipolar disorder. In contrast to the volumetric findings, DTI studies of the uncinate fasciculus tract (connecting the amygdala with the medial- and orbitofrontal cortices) largely showed reduced fractional anisotropy (a marker of white matter microstructure abnormality) in both schizophrenia and bipolar patients, with no cross-diagnostic differences. While decreased amygdalar-orbitofrontal functional connectivity was generally observed in schizophrenia, varying patterns of amygdalar-orbitofrontal connectivity in bipolar disorder were found. Future studies can consider adopting longitudinal approaches with multimodal imaging and more extensive clinical subtyping to probe amygdalar subregional changes and their relationship to the sequelae of psychotic disorders.","Encountering Patient Suicide During Psychiatric Training: An Integrative, Systematic Review.",https://www.ncbi.nlm.nih.gov/pubmed/31082992,Harvard review of psychiatry,2019 05 14,"Patient suicide is an adversity that can be considered an ""occupational hazard.""

Its incidence can range between 5 and 35% among all cases of MI. It is caused by disorders that result in supply-demand mismatch, which leads to myocardial ischemia and necrosis. Therefore, unsurprisingly, it is frequently diagnosed in critically ill patients and those with severe coronary artery disease (CAD) and multiple comorbidities. Though it can occur in the absence of CAD, the presence of coronary blood flow-limiting stenoses can allow even minor insults to disturb the already fine supply-demand balance. Generally, type 2 MI may be associated with higher mortality; however, some data suggest it may have different severities, and outcome is better in patients with type 2 MI of milder severity. Nonetheless, regardless of the causes (ischemic or nonischemic), troponin elevation is associated with worse outcome. Differentiating type 2 MI from other causes of myocardial necrosis, mainly type 1 MI and myocardial injury, remains a clinical challenge. Different diagnostic tools can be utilized to aid in reaching an accurate diagnosis. These can include contrast echocardiography, computed tomography, MRI, radionuclide imaging, coronary angiography, and intracoronary imaging. However, each comes with its own limitations and results should be interpreted with caution and in clinical context. Management of type 2 MI is uncertain because of paucity of data. Evidence-based therapies of type 1 MI are frequently used, though this may be harmful sometimes. Therefore, clinical judgment should be used, and management and therapies should be tailored to each individual case.",Carbohydrate Availability as a Regulator of Energy Balance with Exercise.,https://www.ncbi.nlm.nih.gov/pubmed/31082986,Exercise and sport sciences reviews,2019 05 14,"We explore the novel hypothesis that carbohydrate availability is involved in the regulation of energy balance with exercise, via hormonal and neural signals.

With one of the central principles being the application of multimodal pain interventions to reduce the reliance on opioid-based medications, enhanced recovery pathways provide a framework that decreases perioperative opioid use. The fourth Perioperative Quality Initiative brought together a group of international experts representing anesthesiology, surgery, and nursing with the objective of providing consensus recommendations on this important topic. Fourth Perioperative Quality Initiative was a consensus-building conference designed around a modified Delphi process in which the group alternately convened for plenary discussion sessions in between small group discussions. The process included several iterative steps including a literature review of the topics, building consensus around the important questions related to the topic, and sequential steps of content building and refinement until agreement was achieved and a consensus document was produced. During the fourth Perioperative Quality Initiative conference and thereafter as a writing group, reference applicability to the topic was discussed in any area where there was disagreement. For this manuscript, the questions answered included (1) What are the potential strategies for preventing persistent postoperative opioid use? (2) Is opioid-free anesthesia and analgesia feasible and appropriate for routine operations? and (3) Is opioid-free (intraoperative) anesthesia associated with equivalent or superior outcomes compared to an opioid minimization in the perioperative period?

A positive drug test, suboptimal health, or adverse event can ruin a career in either setting. These populations need to be certain in advance that a product is of high quality and free from performance-enhancing drugs and other banned substances. However, no regulatory authority conducts or mandates a quality review before dietary supplements are sold. Under the Food Drug and Cosmetic Act, the Food and Drug Administration does not have a role in the premarket safety review of dietary supplements. Due to the increasing demand for high-quality, properly labeled dietary supplements, multiple companies have stepped into this void by offering testing and quality review programs for dietary supplements. Each of these third-party programs has its own quality assurance program with varying testing components. It is difficult for consumers in the sport and military settings to assess whether a particular certification program reduces the risks enough so that they can use a product with confidence. This article puts forward the consensus of the authors on current best practices for third-party certification programs for dietary supplements consumed by athletes and military service members.

The current study tested a method to track and quantify the interrun, intrarun, and intersite variability of IHC staining intensity. Our hypothesis was that staining precision between laboratory sites, staining runs, and individual slides may be verified quantitatively, efficiently and effectively utilizing algorithm-based, automated image analysis. To investigate this premise, we tested the consistency of IHC staining in 40 routinely processed (formalin-fixed, paraffin-embedded) human tissues using 10 common antibiomarker antibodies on 2 Dako Omnis instruments at 2 locations (Carpinteria, CA: 30âm above sea level and Longmont, CO: 1500âm above sea level) programmed with identical, default settings and sample pretreatments. Digital images of IHC-labeled sections produced by a whole slide scanner were analyzed by a simple commercially available algorithm and compared with a board-certified veterinary pathologist's semiquantitative scoring of staining intensity. The image analysis output correlated well with pathology scores but had increased sensitivity for discriminating subtle variations and providing reproducible digital quantification across sites as well as within and among staining runs at the same site. Taken together, our data indicate that digital image analysis offers an objective and quantifiable means of verifying IHC staining parameters as a part of laboratory quality assurance systems.This is an open access article distributed under the Creative Commons Attribution License 4.0 (CCBY), which permits unrestricted use, distribution, and reproduction in any medium, provided the original work is properly cited. http://creativecommons.org/licenses/by/4.0/.",Anesthesia and airway management for gastrointestinal endoscopic procedures outside the operating room.,https://www.ncbi.nlm.nih.gov/pubmed/31082826,Current opinion in anaesthesiology,2019 05 14,To review the anesthestic and airway management for gastrointestinal procedures outside of the operating room.,The future of cell-free DNA testing to guide therapeutic decisions in B-cell lymphomas.,https://www.ncbi.nlm.nih.gov/pubmed/31082825,Current opinion in hematology,2019 06 06,"Tissue biopsy is the current gold standard technique for diagnosis and molecular profiling of lymphomas, but it carries several disadvantages in terms of procedural risks (infectious and haemorrhagic complications, anaesthesiologic risks) and analytic aspects (heterogeneity of tumors, low representation of tumor cells in the tissue).

To improve the optical absorption, many perfect absorbers based on the periodic metallic nanostructures have been designed and fabricated through low-throughput, costly and time-consuming lithographic processes, which seriously limit the future potential applications of plasmonic hot-electron optoelectronics devices. Here, a large-scale, broadband absorber consisting of ITO film, ZnO layer, Au film and Al nanospike arrays substrate was designed and fabricated for hot electrons based photodetection. The new designed absorber's absorptivity can beup to 70% in the broad wavelength range from 400 nm to 800 nm(even up to 90% in the wavelength range from 400-550nm) and most of the absorption comes from the Au film, which is effective for the generation of hot electrons. The enhanced broadband absorption is ascribed to the SPPs mode and LSPR mode supported by the nanospike arrays. The influence of geometry and material parameters on the optical absorption properties is also specifically investigated through numerical simulation. The efficient and broadband absorption of nanospikes device resulting in much larger photocurrent compared with that of planar reference device.

Recently machine learning techniques have been proposed for IMRT dose prediction based on patient's contour information from planning CT. In these existing prediction models geometric/anatomic features were learned for building the dose prediction models and few features that characterize the dosimetric properties of the patients were utilized. In this study we propose a method to incorporate the dosimetric features in the construction of a more reliable dose prediction model based on the deep convolutional neural network (CNN). In addition to the contour information, the dose distribution from a PTV-only plan (i.e., the plan with the best PTV coverage by sacrificing the OARs sparing) is also employed as the model input to build a deep learning based dose prediction model. A database of 60 volumetric modulated arc therapy (VMAT) plans for the prostate cancer patients was used for training. The trained prediction model was then tested on a cohort of 10 cases. Dose difference maps, DVHs, dosimetric endpoints and statistical analysis of the sum of absolute residuals (SARs) were used to evaluate the proposed method. Our results showed that the mean SARs for the PTV, bladder and rectum using our method were 0.007Â±0.003, 0.035Â±0.032 and 0.067Â±0.037 respectively, lower than the SARs obtained with the contours-based method, indicating the potential of the proposed approach in accurately predicting dose distribution.",Cross-plane heat conduction in III-V semiconductor superlattices.,https://www.ncbi.nlm.nih.gov/pubmed/31082804,Journal of physics.

FZD5 is a receptor for Wnt5A, and its complex with Wnt5A contributes to activating inflammation and tissue modification. Nasal polyps and eosinophil/non-eosinophil counts are reported to be directly correlated. This study investigated the expression and distribution of FZD5, and the role of eosinophil infiltration and FZD5 in eosinophilic CRSwNP pathogenesis. The prognostic role of eosinophil levels was evaluated in seven patients with CRSwNP. Fifteen patients with CRS were classified based on the percentage of eosinophils in nasal polyp tissue. Methylated genes were detected using methyl-CpG-binding domain sequencing, and qRT-PCR and immunohistochemistry were used to detect FZD5 expression in nasal polyp tissue samples. The results showed that mRNA expression of FZD5 was upregulated in nasal polyps. FZD5 expression was significantly higher in nasal polyp samples from patients with eosinophilic CRSwNP than in those from patients with non-eosinophilic CRSwNP, as indicated by immunohistochemistry. Furthermore, inflammatory cytokine levels were higher in eosinophilic CRSwNP-derived epithelial cells than in normal tissues. In conclusion, FZD5 expression in nasal mucosal epithelial cells is correlated with inflammatory cells and might play a role in the pathogenesis of eosinophilic CRSwNP.",EDUCATIONAL SERIES ON THE SPECIALIST VALVE CLINIC: What is a valve clinic?,https://www.ncbi.nlm.nih.gov/pubmed/31082801,Echo research and practice,2019 05 15,"The prevalence of heart valve disease is increasing as the population ages.

As mitochondrial dysfunction and lipotoxicity are central features of nonalcoholic steatohepatitis (NASH), we tested whether Exe improved mitochondrial function in this setting. We studied C57BL/6J mice fed for 24 weeks either a control- or high-fructose, high-trans-fat (TFD)-diet (i.e., a NASH model previously validated by our laboratory). For the final 8 weeks, mice were treated with Exe (30 Âµg/kg/day) or vehicle. Mitochondrial metabolism was assessed by infusion of [13C3]propionate, [3,4-13C2]glucose and NMR-based 13C-isotopomer analysis. Exenatide significantly decreased fasting plasma glucose, free fatty acids and triglycerides, as well as adipose tissue insulin resistance. Moreover, Exe reduced 23% hepatic glucose production, 15% tri-carboxylic acid (TCA) cycle flux, 20% anaplerosis and 17% pyruvate cycling resulting in a significant 31% decrease in intrahepatic triglyceride content (P = 0.02). Exenatide improved the lipidomic profile and decreased hepatic lipid byproducts associated with insulin resistance and lipotoxicity, such as diacylglycerols (TFD: 111 Â± 13 vs Exe: 64 Â± 13 Âµmol/g protein, P = 0.03) and ceramides (TFD: 1.6 Â± 0.1 vs Exe: 1.3 Â± 0.1 Âµmol/g protein, P = 0.03). Exenatide lowered expression of hepatic lipogenic genes (Srebp1C, Cd36) and genes involved in inflammation and fibrosis (Tnfa, Timp1). In conclusion, in a diet-induced mouse model of NASH, Exe ameliorates mitochondrial TCA cycle flux and significantly decreases insulin resistance, steatosis and hepatocyte lipotoxicity. This may have significant clinical implications to the potential mechanism of action of GLP-1 receptor agonists in patients with NASH. Future studies should elucidate the relative contribution of direct vs indirect mechanisms at play.",EPO-R+ myelodysplastic cells with ring sideroblasts produce high erythroferrone levels to reduce hepcidin expression in hepatic cells.,https://www.ncbi.nlm.nih.gov/pubmed/31082798,"Blood cells, molecules & diseases",2019 05 21,"Recently, a new erythroid regulator, erythroferrone (ERFE), which downregulates hepatic hepcidin production, has been identified.

ERFE mRNA was increased during normal erythroid differentiation. An analysis of GSE58831 indicated that ERFE expression in bone marrow (BM) MDS cells was higher than that in healthy volunteer (HV)-derived BM cells.

However, iP4 treatment causes early functional and structural regression of the corpus luteum (CL) in a proportion of iP4-treated animals, resulting in pregnancy loss. The hypothesis evaluated was that iP4 accelerates downregulation of sex-steroid receptors (PGR, ESR1, ESR2) during early to mid-diestrus and the upregulation of genes controlling PGF2Î± secretion (OXTR, PTGS2, AKR1B1) during late diestrus in the endometrium. Ovulations of cyclic, multiparous Nelore (Bos indicus) cows were synchronized, and cows were divided to receive placebo or 300Â mg iP4 3Â d postovulation (D3). Growth and vascularization of luteal tissue were evaluated by ultrasonography. Blood samples were collected from 3Â d postovulation to 3Â d after luteolysis, and P4 plasma concentrations were measured by radioimmunoassay. On days 3, 5, 7, 9, 11, 13, and 16 luminal endometrial samples were taken using a cytologic brush. Transcript abundance was measured by qPCR. Structural luteolysis occurred 3Â d earlier in cows receiving iP4 compared to the control group. Analyzing only cows that received iP4, those that presented early luteolysis (ie, â¤ D16) showed a decrease in CL area and P4 concentration after D5, compared to the control group. Cows that presented early luteolysis showed a reduced abundance of transcripts on D5 for the ESR2 gene and a greater abundance of transcripts for OXTR and ESR1 on D16, compared to cows that did not present early luteolysis. The iP4-induced early luteolysis can be explained by two nonexclusive possibilities: the activation of uterine mechanisms that trigger early secretion of endometrial PGF pulses and the formation of a subfunctional CL that is prone to early regression.",Melatonin-improved buffalo semen quality during nonbreeding season under tropical condition.,https://www.ncbi.nlm.nih.gov/pubmed/31082783,Domestic animal endocrinology,2019 05 16,"The role of melatonin in protecting spermatozoa from different kinds of injury has been widely reported.

Furthermore, melatonin implantation increased (P < 0.05) seminal plasma concentrations of total protein, albumin, and cholesterol and decreased (P < 0.05) seminal plasma aspartate aminotransferase activity. In addition, melatonin-implanted bulls exhibited an increase (P < 0.05) in red blood cells superoxide dismutase activity compared to untreated bulls.

However, the two main areas that determine this performance metric are the membrane electrode assembly (MEA) and the bipolar plates. The MEA provides the platform for the electrochemical reaction to occur and the bipolar plate serves as a medium between the reactants (hydrogen and air) and the catalyst layer. The bipolar plate is the first point of contact for the reactants inside the fuel cell, so a badly designed item with a high pressure drop will have a negative impact on fuel cell performance. Numerical modelling and simulation tools like ANSYS have a huge impact on engineering industry as they help designs to be validated and analysed before any physical construction. This investigation considers five suitable flow plate designs for PEM fuel cell, each completely different from the readily available, traditional serpentine designs on the market. The work explored the possibility of replacing these flow channels with an aluminium cellular foam with different inlet and outlet orientations. The designs were further optimised and modelled in ANSYS. The results obtained were compared with other designs in the literature. Compared to the serpentine flow design, the open pore cellular foam material showed a very small pressure drop in the range of 30-40â¯Pa.

B, Biointerfaces",2019 05 22,"Candida albicans is responsible for the majority of nosocomial infections affecting immunocompromised patients. Systemic antifungals may promote microbial resistance, which has led to the search for alternative treatments, such as photothermal therapy (PTT). PTT assumes that the interaction of electromagnetic radiation with a photothermal agent generates heat that can lead to the destruction of tumor cells and the death of microorganisms. Carbon nanotubes (CNTs) have the potential for applications in biomedical systems, including acting as controlled deliverers of drugs, biosensors and scaffolds for tissue engineering and regenerative medicine. Furthermore, the absorption of radiation by CNTs in the infrared region induces an increase in temperature, which makes CNTs candidates for photothermal agents. In this work, the photothermal inactivation of C. albicans was evaluated by multiple wall CNTs associated with laser radiation in the near-infrared region. The mechanisms that are involved in inactivation were evaluated through cell susceptibility studies and an analysis of microscopic images that are associated with mathematical models and fractal concepts. The results indicate that direct contact between the cells and CNTs without irradiation does not lead to cell death, whereas the laser-mediated process is effective in inactivation. The application of the laws of scale and fractal concepts indicate that in the control groups, there are two distinct regimes that are delimited by the mean diameter of the microorganisms, as described by the Eden model and by the quasi-Euclidean surface. For the irradiated groups, the surfaces present only one regime described by Kardar-Parisi-Zhang, KPZ.

B, Biointerfaces",2019 05 22,"Precise detection of undifferentiated human pluripotent stem cells (hPSCs) and their entire subsequent elimination are incredibly important in preventing teratoma formations after transplantation. Recently, electrochemical sensing platforms have demonstrated immense potential as a new tool to detect remaining hPSCs in label-free and non-destructive manner. Nevertheless, one of the critical huddles of this electrochemical sensing approach is its low sensitivity since even low concentrations of remaining hPSCs were reported to form teratoma once transplanted. To address this issue, in this study, we report an engineering-based approach to improve the sensitivity of electrochemical sensing platform for hPSC detection. By optimizing the density of gold nanostructure and the matrigel concentration to improve both electro-catalytic property and biocompatibility, the sensitivity of the developed platform toward hESCs detection could reach 12,500 cells/chip, which is close to the known critical concentration of hPSCs (Ë10,000 cells) that induce teratoma formation in vivo. Remarkably, the electrochemical signals were not detectable from other types of stem cell-derived endothelial cells (CB-EPCs) even at high concentrations of CB-EPCs (40,000 cells/chip), proving the high selectivity of the developed platform toward hPSC detection. Hence, the developed platform could be highly useful to solve the safety issues that are related with clinical application of hPSC-derived cells.",Glucose-responsive complex micelles for self-regulated delivery of insulin with effective protection of insulin and enhanced hypoglycemic activity in vivo.,https://www.ncbi.nlm.nih.gov/pubmed/31082775,"Colloids and surfaces. B, Biointerfaces",2019 05 22,"Large amounts of insulin-loaded glucose-responsive micelles based on poly(amino acid)s have been developed for diabetes treatment over last decades, but most of them could not effectively protect insulin from enzymatic degradation in vivo because the micellar core was biodegradable and lacked protective structure for insulin, which would lower the efficacy of insulin to a large extent. In this study, we fabricated a new type of insulin-loaded glucose-responsive complex micelles (CMs), which were self-assembled by a phenylboronic acid (PBA)-modified block copolymer PEG-b-P(Asp-co-AspPBA) and a glucosamine (GA)/nitrilotriacetic acid (NTA)-functionalized block copolymer PNIPAM-b-P(Asp-co-AspGA-co-AspNTA), for self-regulated delivery of insulin with effective protection of insulin and enhanced hypoglycemic activity in vivo. The CMs possessed mixed shell of PEG/PNIPAM and cross-linked core of PBA/GA complex, which could be disintegrated under the condition of high glucose concentration (5âg/L) while maintaining stable at low glucose concentration (1âg/L). The NTA groups of CMs greatly improved the loading content of insulin by specifically bind insulin via the chelated zinc ions. More importantly, PNIPAM chains in the mixed shell would collapse under 37âÂ°C and form hydrophobic domains around the micellar core, which could significantly protect the micellar core as well as the encapsulated insulin from attacking by external proteases. In a murine model of type 1 diabetes, the CMs with insulin chelated by NTA showed a long hypoglycemic effect, which is superior to insulin-loaded simple micelles without PNIPAM and insulin in PBS buffer (pH 7.4). Therefore, this kind of CMs could be a potential candidate for insulin delivery in diabetes therapy."

Torin2 is a second-generation ATP competitive mTOR kinase inhibitor (IC50â¯=â¯0.25â¯nM). Our research team tested the anti-EV71 activity of Torin2 inÂ vitro for the first time. The result showed that Torin2 had significant anti-EV71 activity (IC50â¯=â¯0.01â¯Î¼M). In this study, thirty novel Torin2 derivatives were synthesized and evaluated for anti-EV71 activity. Among them, 11a, 11b, 11d, 11e and 11m displayed similar activity to Torin2. 11e displayed the most potent activity, with an IC50 value of 0.027â¯Î¼M, which was closest to Torin2, and displayed potent mTOR kinase inhibitory activity. A molecular modeling study showed that 11e interacted with Val2240 and Lys2187 via hydrogen bonds and had a good match with the receptor. Additionally, a mechanism study showed that most of the compounds had significant inhibition for the mTOR pathway substrates p70S6K and Akt. The water solubility test of compounds with potent activity revealed that 11a and 11m were improved by approximately 5-15-fold compared to Torin2. These data suggest that 11a and 11m may be potential candidates for anti-EV71 treatment.","Discovery of tropinone-thiazole derivatives as potent caspase 3/7 activators, and noncompetitive tyrosinase inhibitors with high antiproliferative activity: Rational design, one-pot tricomponent synthesis, and lipophilicity determination.",https://www.ncbi.nlm.nih.gov/pubmed/31082763,European journal of medicinal chemistry,2019 05 27,"We have designed novel tropinone-thiazole derivatives that showed high antiproliferative activity against a variety of cancer cell lines via caspase 3/7 activation mechanism.

Once termed 'prophylactic mastectomy', risk reducing mastectomy (RRM) was considered two decades ago not only extreme, but in some quarters almost unethical. RRM is now commonly undertaken in specialist breast units for women at high individual breast cancer risk, by virtue of an inherited breast cancer related gene mutation or from calculated high statistical risk from family history data, and the efficacy of RRM in reducing subsequent incident diagnoses of breast cancer has been published from a number of centres. RRM is offered routinely in conjunction with total breast reconstruction, using the whole range of reconstructive surgical techniques. The public announcement by the actor Angelina Jolie in 2013 that she had inherited and harboured a BRCA1 gene mutation, and was undergoing RRM and breast reconstruction to lower her intrinsic breast cancer risk, had a significant effect on public attitudes and perception. Whilst there are other means of lowering breast cancer risk by means of selective oestrogen receptor modulators, such as tamoxifen and raloxifene, their lowering effect on risk of breast cancer remains substantially less than that afforded by surgical removal of 'at risk' breast tissue. The progressive development and increasing sophistication of techniques of breast reconstructive surgery has paralleled the trend for more RRM surgery, and the substantial majority of women who opt for RRM choose immediate breast reconstruction.",Statin therapy among chronic kidney disease patients presenting with acute coronary syndrome.,https://www.ncbi.nlm.nih.gov/pubmed/31082760,Atherosclerosis,2019 06 10,"The beneficial effect of statin therapy has been well established for both primary and secondary prevention of cardiovascular disease.

The results showed that the synthetic vanadium complexes demonstrated moderate to good antiproliferative activities against the four cancer cell lines including MGC803, EC109, MCF7 and HepG2, respectively. Of note was that most of the complexes showed preferential growth inhibitory activity to some degree toward gastric cancer line MGC803. Among them, complex 19 exhibited the most and broad-spectrum proliferative inhibition against the tested cell lines. In addition, mechanism studies illustrated that complex 19 could prevent the colony formation, migration and EMT process, as well as induce apoptosis of MGC803â¯cells. Furthermore, Western blot experiments revealed that the expression of apoptosis-related proteins changed, including up-regulation of Bax, PARP and caspase-3/9, as well as down-regulation of Bcl-2.","Safety attributes in primary care: understanding the needs of patients, health professionals, and managers.",https://www.ncbi.nlm.nih.gov/pubmed/31082758,Public health,2019 06 11,"The aims of this study were (1) to identify attributes for patient safety at a primary healthcare level and (2) to analyze conceptions of patients, professionals, and managers about how these attributes are being addressed.","Did school characteristics affect the uptake of meningococcal quadrivalent vaccine in Greater Manchester, United Kingdom?",https://www.ncbi.nlm.nih.gov/pubmed/31082757,Public health,2019 06 11,The objective of this study was to assess if school characteristics were associated with the uptake of the meningococcal ACWY (MenACWY) vaccine in Greater Manchester in 2017/18.,Inferred valuation versus conventional contingent valuation: A salinity intrusion case study.,https://www.ncbi.nlm.nih.gov/pubmed/31082756,Journal of environmental management,2019 05 26,"People's willingness-to-pay values may be inflated by a variety of influences (e.g. hypothetical bias), which means that stated preference validity tests remain relevant. Recently developed inferred valuation approaches may serve to identify and/or reduce inflated stated preference values. However, economic applications of inferred valuation approaches are relatively limited in the literature, and the evidence remains mixed. This paper examines farmers' willingness-to-pay for salinity intrusion mitigation programs in the Mekong River Delta of Vietnam using both conventional contingent and inferred valuation approaches. Inferred valuation estimates were as much as 31 per cent lower than conventional estimates of willingness-to-pay, and averaged about 24 per cent lower across the groups. We discuss these findings, and the role that commitment costs and provision point mechanism payment vehicles may play. Public policy implications for any future salinity intrusion mitigation program are also outlined.",Bringing forecasting into the future: Using Google to predict visitation in U.S. national parks.,https://www.ncbi.nlm.nih.gov/pubmed/31082755,Journal of environmental management,2019 05 26,"In recent years, visitation to U.S. National Parks has been increasing, with the majority of this increase occurring in a subset of parks. As a result, managers in these parks must respond quickly to increasing visitor-related challenges. Improved visitation forecasting would allow managers to more proactively plan for such increases. In this study, we leverage internet search data that is freely available through Google Trends to create a forecasting model. We compare this Google Trends model to a traditional autoregressive forecasting model. Overall, our Google Trends model accurately predicted 97% of the total visitation variation to all parks one year in advance from 2013 to 2017 and outperformed the autoregressive model by all metrics. While our Google Trends model performs better overall, this was not the case for each park unit individually; the accuracy of this model varied significantly from park to park. We hypothesized that park attributes related to trip planning would correlate with the accuracy of our Google Trends model, but none of the variables tested produced overly compelling results. Future research can continue exploring the utility of Google Trends to forecast visitor use in protected areas, or use methods demonstrated in this paper to explore alternative data sources to improve visitation forecasting in U.S. National Parks."

We performed a systematic review to evaluate the incidence of emergent cesarean delivery performed for non-reassuring fetal heart rate patterns during non-obstetric surgery. Electronic databases were searched from their inception until October 2018 without limit for language. We included studies evaluating at least five cases of intraoperative fetal heart rate monitoring -either with ultrasound or cardiotocography- during non-obstetric surgery in pregnant women at â¥22 weeks of gestation. The primary outcome was the incidence of intraoperative cesarean delivery performed for non-reassuring fetal heart rate monitoring. Non-reassuring fetal heart rate monitoring was defined by attendant personnel, meeting NICHD criteria for category II or III patterns. Data extracted regarded type of study, demographic characteristics, maternal and perinatal outcomes. Statistical analysis was performed for continuous outcomes by calculating mean and standard deviations for appropriate variables. Of 120 studies identified, 4 with 41 cases of intraoperative monitoring met criteria for inclusion and were analyzed. Most (66%) surgeries were indicated for neurological or abdominal maternal issues and were performed under general anesthesia (88%) at a mean gestational age of 28 weeks. Minimal or absent fetal heart variability was noted in most cases and a 10-25 beats per minutes decrease in fetal heart rate baseline was observed in cases with general anesthesia. No intraoperative cesarean deliveries were needed. The incidence of non-reassuring fetal heart rate monitoring was 4.9% (2/41) and were limited to fetal tachycardia during maternal fever. Two (4.9%) cases of non-reassuring fetal heart rate monitoring were noted within the immediate 48âh after surgery, necessitating cesarean delivery. A single case of intrauterine fetal demise occurred four days postoperatively in a woman who had neurosurgery and remained comatose. In conclusion, limited data exist regarding the clinical application of fetal heart rate monitoring at viable gestational ages during non-obstetric surgical procedures.

We show that Sox2 is strongly expressed in mouse postmitotic thalamic projection neurons. Cre-mediated deletion of Sox2 in these neurons causes reduction of the dLGN, abnormal distribution of retino-thalamic and thalamo-cortical projections, and secondary defects in cortical patterning. Reduced expression, in mutants, of Sox2 target genes encoding ephrin-A5 and the serotonin transport molecules SERT and vMAT2 (important for establishment of thalamic connectivity) likely provides a molecular contribution to these defects.

Expression and alternative splicing analysis of RNA sequencing data from interfollicular epidermis and outer root sheath indicate that EGFR controls genes involved in epidermal differentiation and also in centrosome function, DNA damage, cell cycle, and apoptosis. Genetic experiments employing p53 deletion in EGFR-deficient epidermis reveal that EGFR signaling exhibits p53-dependent functions in proliferative epidermal compartments, as well as p53-independent functions in differentiated hair shaft keratinocytes. Loss of EGFR leads to absence of LEF1 protein specifically in the innermost epithelial hair layers, resulting in disorganization of medulla cells. Thus, our results uncover important spatial and temporal features of cell-autonomous EGFR functions in the epidermis."

High mobility group box 1 protein (HMGB1) is a member of the damage-associated molecular pattern (DAMP) family and has been verified as an IBD-associated inflammatory cytokine that mediates the TLR4-NF-ÎºB pathway. However, no exact mechanism has been illustrated among melatonin, disrupted circadian rhythm and inflammatory bowel disease, as well as regarding the effect of melatonin on HMGB1. In the present study, we aimed to explore the role of relationship with HMGB1. CRD aggravated DSS-induced colitis by worsening colonic inflammation and tissue injury, as well as by enhancing HMGB1 translocation, which could be reversed by ethyl pyruvate, an HMGB1 antagonist. Moreover, melatonin treatment attenuated these disorders and the shuttling of HMGB1 in the intestinal epithelial cells (IECs), the effect of which could be partly reversed by the melatonin antagonist luzindole. The protective role of melatonin may be tightly related to the translocation of HMGB1 in IECs.

Short-chain chlorinated paraffins (SCCPs) were recently classified as persistent organic pollutants (POPs), while medium-chain chlorinated paraffins (MCCPs) are still unregulated. Foodstuff is a major pathway for the human CP intake, and the regular diet has been analyzed in several studies recently. However, dietary supplements (DS) had not been analyzed on CPs. Our goal was to investigate the occurrence of CPs in DS and to evaluate the possible threat for the consumers. DS (nâ¯=â¯25) made from plant or fish oils were selected on the German market with main emphasis on vitamin E products. The lipid components were removed by sulphuric acid treatment and silica gel column chromatography. CP quantification was performed via gas chromatography coupled to electron capture negative ion mass spectrometry. Six vitamin E preparations containing palm oil showed alarmingly high CP concentrations of >35â¯Î¼g/g fat. Six other DS contained much lower CP amounts (<4â¯Î¼g/g fat). If consumed as recommended, the mean daily intake of CPs (5.5â¯Î¼g SCCPsâ¯+â¯38â¯Î¼g MCCPs) via palm oil based DS surpassed that of the regular diet by a factor of 4 for SCCPs and 13 for MCCPs, exceeding the PCB intake via food by up to two orders of magnitude. Samples reached up to 26% of the TDI of MCCPs for an average European adult. Consequently, the P95 intake of those samples would amount to ~43â¯mg CPs per year. The CP contamination probably originated from raw material, as CPs were also found in palm oils and vitamin E concentrates made from palm oil. Our findings suggest that DS can contain high amounts of contaminants that compromise the purpose of the product and should be considered for regular CP monitoring.","Pollution characteristics, sources, and health risk assessment of human exposure to Cu, Zn, Cd and Pb pollution in urban street dust across China between 2009 and 2018.",https://www.ncbi.nlm.nih.gov/pubmed/31082721,Environment international,2019 05 19,"Since heavy metal pollution is widespread in street dust in China, the effects of heavy metals in street dust on human health cannot be ignored. However, studies estimating heavy metal pollution in street dust nationwide are limited. In this study, the concentrations of Cu, Zn, Cd and Pb in street dust at 3877sites throughout China were obtained from the published scientific literature. Based on these data, the contamination levels, spatial distributions, sources and potential health risks of heavy metals in street dust were comprehensively estimated. The results revealed that Cu, Zn, Cd and Pb levels are generally higher in the southeast provinces than in northwest China. In addition, traffic emissions and industrial activities are determined to be the two main sources of heavy metal pollution in street dust. The health risk assessment indicated that ingestion is the most important pathway of exposure to metal pollution in street dust for both children and adults, followed by dermal contact and inhalation. The spatial distribution of health risks suggested that the health risks are more serious in southeast China than in northwest China. The noncarcinogenic risks posed by Pb are relatively higher than those posed by the other three metals for both children and adults. Meanwhile, none of the hazard index (HI) values exceeded the safe level (1.0), with the exception of Pb in Daye city for children (HIâ¯=â¯1.074). The HI values for children were higher than those for adults.

Herein we prepared organo-clay composites (OCCs) by mixing bentonite-enriched clay (BEC) with nonionic surfactants (Brij 30 and Igepal CO-890) and determined if these modifications would enable chickens to detoxify aflatoxin B1 (AFB1). For the first time, in situ three-dimensional (3-D) microstructures of modified BEC was characterized in suspension using transmission X-ray microscopy. Although X-ray diffraction patterns indicated the expansion in the spacing between planes of atoms (basal spacing) of surfactant-modified BEC, 3-D images indicated shrinkage in its microscale porous framework with increasing surfactant additions from 1 to 30âwt%. Such declining trends in porous dimensions caused by the dehydration in interlayer galleries of clays positively correlated with sorption amounts of AFB1 on OCCs. After chickens had consumed amended feeds for 11 weeks, AFB1 concentrations in liver, kidney, and plasma were significantly lower than in the control treatment. Thus, we suggest using BEC with 1âwt% surfactant addition, an amendment to chicken feeds, to detoxify AFB1. Modifying BEC with nonionic surfactants show the promise in mitigating AFB1 accumulation in chickens, which should improve food safety and reduce environmental contamination.","A systemic study of enantioselectivity of isocarbophos in rice cultivation: Enantioselective bioactivity, toxicity, and environmental fate.",https://www.ncbi.nlm.nih.gov/pubmed/31082719,Journal of hazardous materials,2019 06 08,"The enantioselective bioactivity and acute toxicity to target and non-target model species, and environmental fate of isocarbophos (ICP) in rice cultivation were investigated systematically. Bioactivity and toxicity of S-(+)-ICP was significantly greater than R-(-)-ICP, and the difference was 2.9-101 times. Based on the toxic unit analysis, the toxic interaction of ICP enantiomers for target pests was synergistic effect, while for non-target fish was concentration addition or antagonistic effect. Rac-ICP displayed equivalent bioactivity to S-(+)-ICP under the equal dosage, but the toxicity of rac-ICP to the tested fishes reduced at least 2 times. Rac-ICP is more suitable than optically pure S-(+)-ICP for rice cultivation based on the toxicity and bioactivity results. In environmental behavior experiments, the main metabolite of ICP, isocarbophos oxon (ICPO) was detected in rice plants, water, rice and rice hull samples. S-(+)-ICP and S-(+)-ICPO were more persistent than the R-form in these matrices. The comprehensive data of ICP enantiomers in rice cultivation will improve environmental and ecological risk assessment, and using racemate may be more safe and reasonable in rice cultivation system.",Stability kinetics of fusidic acid: Development and validation of stability indicating analytical method by employing Analytical Quality by Design approach in medicinal product(s).,https://www.ncbi.nlm.nih.gov/pubmed/31082718,"Journal of chromatography. B, Analytical technologies in the biomedical and life sciences",2019 06 13,"A simple, rapid, accurate, reproducible and sensitive reverse phase HPLC method for the estimation of fusidic acid (FA) by means of Analytical Quality by Design (AQbD) was the aim of the present study. Initially, the vital pre-requisites for AQbD like analytical method target profile and critical analytical attributes (CAAs) like theoretical plates, tailing factor and percent assay were defined. An octadecyl silyl silica C18 column with a packing size of 5â¯Î¼m was employed and the detection was performed at 235â¯nm using UV-detector. The separation was performed with isocratic elution employing mixture of methanol: acetonitrile (5: 95, v/v) and an aqueous phase with pH of 2.8 containing 0.1% orthophosphoric acid in the ratio of 60: 40 (v/v). Ishikawa fish-bone diagram provided the basis of the variation in CAAs with various inputs. Taguchi Design was selected as the initial screening design to select critical method parameters (CMPs) affecting method development and Central Composite Design (CCD) was further applied for systematic optimization of chromatographic method by evaluating CAAs. Crucial parameters viz. limit of detection, limit of quantification, specificity, linearity and sensitivity were employed to validate the method in accordance with the ICH guidelines. Stress degradation studies were performed and the developed method was able to successfully differentiate the degraded products from the parent drug, that too in a topical gel. In conclusion, the findings of the present study validated the utility of AQbD in the systematic design of a liquid chromatographic method with fine sensitivity for FA estimation in medicinal products.",Genome-wide Analysis of the MADS-Box Gene Family in Watermelon.,https://www.ncbi.nlm.nih.gov/pubmed/31082717,Computational biology and chemistry,2019 06 13,"MADS-box genes comprise a family of transcription factors that function in the growth and development of plants. To obtain insights into their evolution in watermelon (Citrullus lanatus), we carried out a genome-wide analysis and identified 39 MADS-box genes. These genes were classified into MIKCc (25), MIKC*(3), MÎ± (5), MÎ² (3), and MÎ³ (3) clades according to their phylogenetic relationship with Arabidopsis thaliana and Cucumis sativus; moreover, these 25 genes in the MIKC clade could be classified into 13 subfamilies, and the Flowering Locus C (FLC) subfamily is absent in watermelon. Analysis of the conserved gene motifs showed similar motifs among clades. Continuing chromosomal localizations analysis indicated that MADS-box genes were distributed across 11 chromosomes in watermelon, and these genes were conditioned to be differentially expressed during plant growth and development. This research provides information that will aid further investigations into the evolution of the MADS-box gene family in plants.",The gut microbiome and pharmacology: a prescription for therapeutic targeting of the gut-brain axis.,https://www.ncbi.nlm.nih.gov/pubmed/31082716,Current opinion in pharmacology,2019 06 11,"New frontiers for host-microbe interactions continue to emerge as our knowledge of the adult gut microbiome in health and disease is continually supplemented and improved. Alterations in the gut microbiota composition in irritable bowel syndrome (IBS) are now linked to symptom severity while population-based evidence linking gut microbiome signatures to depression is an important new landmark. The effects of drugs on gut microbiome composition are also becoming clearer. Meanwhile, preclinical studies have delineated the influence of the gut microbiome at a structural and activity level in distinct brain regions. Bacterial metabolites, such as tryptamine, can activate specific receptors to impact gastrointestinal motility.

The dentin was restored using a resin-modified glass-ionomer (RMGIC) or a composite resin (RC). One hemiface of the sample was protected, and the other was subdivided according to the applied dentifrice (nâ¯=â¯10): without fluoride (SF), sodium fluoride (NaF) and stannous fluoride (SnF). The specimens were submitted to erosive/abrasive cycles, the varnish was removed, and the Martens hardness (HMV) and elastic modulus (Eit) were evaluated. The data were analyzed by repeated two-way ANOVA measurements and Tukey tests (alphaâ¯=â¯0.05). When analyzing the HMV on the test side, there was no influence of the dentifrices in the dentin; however, the orders of NaFâ¯<â¯SnF = SF in RC and SnFâ¯>â¯NaF = SF in RMGIC were observed. Comparing the treated surfaces, there were no differences in the dentin, and only the SF since CR presented an HMV superior to that of RMGIC. Comparing control and test sides, both dentins obtained a decreased HMV after the erosive/abrasive challenge; for the restorative materials, superior values were found only for SnF in the RMGIC. The Eit values were influenced more by the dentifrices on the test side for the dentin adjacent to the RMGIC, with the lowest values shown for the SF, and for both materials, the highest values were shown for the SnF group. No differences were found when comparing each dentin treated with the same dentifrice; however, the RMGIC presented a superior Eit than the CR when brushed with both dentifrices with a fluoride. Comparing the control and test sides, the same results were obtained for the HMV. The dentifrices showed little influence on the dentin substrate, whereas the dentifrice with SnF enhanced the mechanical properties of the restorative materials, which was more evident in the RMGIC.","Influence of protease inhibitors on the degradation of sound, sclerotic and caries-affected demineralized dentin.",https://www.ncbi.nlm.nih.gov/pubmed/31082714,Journal of the mechanical behavior of biomedical materials,2019 06 11,"The aim of this study was to evaluate influence of protease inhibitors on degradation of sound, sclerotic and caries-affected dentin.

Seven days post-administration, eight fish of each experimental group were sampled, and the remaining animals were challenged with a hyperosmotic stress by being transferred from seawater (36âppt) to high salinity water (55âppt) and being sampled 3 days post-transfer. Aroclor 1254 affected gene expression of avt, together with Avt concentrations in pituitary and plasma, inhibiting the stimulation observed in vasotocinergic system after hyperosmotic challenge. This was noted by the accumulation of Avt at hypophyseal level as well as by its undetectable values in plasma. Hyperosmotic transfer significantly changed branchial avtrv1a, avtrv2, atp1a and cftr mRNA expression levels in control fish, while in Aroclor 1254-treated fish they remained mostly unchanged. This desensitization also occurred for avtrs in hypothalamus, caudal kidney and liver. In addition, an enhancement in plasma cortisol concentration, together with the orchestration of several players of the Hypothalamic-Pituitary-Interrenal axis (crh, crhbp, trh, star), was also observed mostly at the highest dose used (50âÎ¼gâg-1 body mass), affecting plasma and hepatic metabolites. Our results demonstrated that Aroclor 1254 compromises the hypoosmoregulatory function of vasotocinergic system in S. aurata, also inducing a concomitant stress response. In summary, this study demonstrates that Aroclor 1254 can be considered an important endocrine disruptor in relation with the correct arrangement of vasotocinergic, metabolic and stress pathways after their stimulation by transfer to hyperosmotic environments.",The dynamic changes of arsenic bioaccumulation and antioxidant responses in the marine medaka Oryzias melastigma during chronic exposure.,https://www.ncbi.nlm.nih.gov/pubmed/31082702,"Aquatic toxicology (Amsterdam, Netherlands)",2019 06 09,"Arsenic (As) is a highly toxic metalloid to aquatic organisms, but the effects of low-dose chronic inorganic As exposure on marine fish are still unclear. A 28-day study was conducted on chronic exposure of 100âÎ¼g/L inorganic As [As(III) and As(V)] in the marine medaka Oryzias melastigma to quantify the effects of chronic inorganic As exposure on its bioaccumulation, biotransformation, oxidative stress, and antioxidant enzymes response. During the exposure period, chronic inorganic As exposure had no significant effect on the total As bioaccumulation except at 7 d for As(V) treatment. Based on the toxicokinetic data, the low As bioaccumulation was caused by low dissolved uptake (ku), internal transfer (k12, k21) and high efflux (ke1). The organic As were the predominated species (77â-â80%) and remained constant, while the inorganic As increased 35% (from 0.26âÎ¼g/g to 0.35âÎ¼g/g) during the initial 4-d exposure and then recovered. The increased inorganic As could be covered by the high contribution of organic As especially arsenobetaine (AsB) to the total As accumulation. Coincidently, the malondialdehyde (MDA) levels followed similar trends as the inorganic As concentrations, indicating that inorganic As bioaccumulation induced oxidative stress at the initial stage. Both the contents of the nonenzymatic antioxidant (glutathione, GSH) and the activities of the enzymatic antioxidants (superoxide dismutase (SOD), catalase (CAT), peroxidase (POD) and glutathione-S-transferase (GST)) increased initially and then decreased as the inorganic As concentrations, thus lowering the hydrogen peroxide (H2O2) levels and displaying a typical antioxidant defense mechanism. In summary, this study elucidated that although the marine medaka had a limited ability to accumulate waterborne As, the increase in the inorganic As at the early stage of exposure still caused toxic effects, which could be ignored by constant total As concentrations. Therefore, the toxicity of As could be underestimated if only the total As instead of the inorganic As is monitored in marine fish.",Post-search IOR: Searching for inhibition of return after search.,https://www.ncbi.nlm.nih.gov/pubmed/31082701,Acta psychologica,2019 06 15,"Previous research has indicated that Inhibition of return (IOR) supports visual search by discouraging the re-inspection of recently inspected items during search. However, it is not clear whether IOR persists after a search is completed or whether this depends on the presence of a further search in the same display. To investigate this issue, we had participants search consecutively twice in the same display (Experiment 1). Immediately after the end of the first search and after the end of the second search we probed an item which had been recently inspected or not in the previous search. The results showed that IOR as measured by the saccadic latency to the probed items was absent after the end of each of the two successive searches. In Experiment 2, we measured both saccadic latencies and manual responses in a single-search paradigm. We found that IOR during and after the search was present for saccadic responses but absent for manual responses. This suggests that IOR during and after a visual search depends on the modality of the response and the number of required searches.",Sitagliptin's effects on bone tissue and osseointegration in diabetic rats.,https://www.ncbi.nlm.nih.gov/pubmed/31082700,Archives of oral biology,2019 05 27,"To investigate the effects of sitagliptin, a dipeptidyl peptidase 4 inhibitor used to treat type II diabetes, on bone tissue and on implant osseointegration in diabetic rats.",Leukocyte- and platelet-rich fibrin as graft material improves microRNA-21 expression and decreases oxidative stress in the calvarial defects of diabetic rabbits.,https://www.ncbi.nlm.nih.gov/pubmed/31082699,Archives of oral biology,2019 05 27,"Leukocyte- and platelet-rich fibrin (L-PRF) represents a natural, low-cost product which may promote tissue healing by mechanisms not fully elucidated.

The switches are usually associated with conserved structural motifs on transmembrane helices (TMs), and they are accompanied by adjacent residues which provide the signal to the central residue in the toggle switch. In case of locks being the molecular switches, they are breaking (permanently or temporarily) upon agonist binding. Cascade action of switches is correlated with influx of water molecules to form a pathway linking both sides of the receptor. The switches remove the hydrophobic barriers and facilitate water movement while water molecules help to rearrange the hydrogen bond network inside the receptor.",Long-term efficacy of anti-PD1 therapy in Hodgkin lymphoma with and without allogenic stem cell transplantation.,https://www.ncbi.nlm.nih.gov/pubmed/31082693,"European journal of cancer (Oxford, England : 1990)",2019 05 29,Long-term efficacy of anti-PD1 therapy and the need for a consolidation with allogenic haematopoietic stem cell transplantation (allo-HSCT) remain unclear in patients with relapsed/refractory (R/R) Hodgkin lymphoma (HL).

Immunoreactivity for dentin sialoprotein, a marker of mature odontoblasts, was strongly detected under the original dentin. No Î²-galactosidase staining was observed in the control group. Thus, we demonstrated that BM-MSCs survived for 2â¯weeks after implantation and colonized within the site of potential cytodifferentiation. Our findings indicated that BM-MSCs could differentiate into cells involved in mineralized tissue formation in the functionally relevant region.",Half a century of Krypton-85 activity concentration measured in air over Central Europe: Trends and relevance for dating young groundwater.,https://www.ncbi.nlm.nih.gov/pubmed/31082675,Journal of environmental radioactivity,2019 05 31,"For almost half a century weekly samples for the measurement of krypton-85 (85Kr) activity concentrations in surface air have been collected by the Bundesamt fÃ¼r Strahlenschutz (BfS), Germany. Sampling started at Freiburg (230m asl) in 1973, Mt Schauinsland (1205m asl) in 1976 and Mt Jungfraujoch in Switzerland (3454 asl) in 1990. Distinct maxima in the time series of atmospheric 85Kr activity concentration are caused by emissions from nuclear reprocessing plants in Europe, mainly the La Hague, France, and Sellafield, UK, reprocessing plants. Between 1970 and 1990 peak activity concentrations measured in winter along the Rhine Rift in Freiburg are often higher than at Mt Schauinsland, due to emissions from the operating pilot reprocessing plant in Karlsruhe - approximately 130â¯km to the north - and large-scale inversions that inhibit exchange of air masses within the Rhine Rift with those at higher altitudes. From the early 1990s onwards, after the shut-down of the pilot plant, differences between Freiburg and Schauinsland are much smaller. Activity concentrations measured at Jungfraujoch are generally lower and close to baseline levels, due to its location in the free troposphere. Weekly baseline and average 85Kr activity concentration in the atmosphere in Central Europe were modelled from almost 12,000 individual measurements at 11 stations. The baseline and average have continuously increased, interrupted by a relatively stable period between 2009 and the end of 2014 with a baseline activity concentration of about 1.39 Bq/m3. Depending on the geographical location and hydrological conditions, the modelled baseline or average 85Kr activity concentration time series can be used as input functions for the dating of young groundwater.",Anthropogenic 236U and Pu at remote sites of the South Pacific.,https://www.ncbi.nlm.nih.gov/pubmed/31082674,Journal of environmental radioactivity,2019 05 31,"Anthropogenic radionuclides, like 236U and 239,240Pu, are present in the environment as a result of global fallout from nuclear weapons tests conducted in the 1950s and 1960s and can potentially be used as tracers in soil erosion and sediment movement studies. Here, we report data on 236U and 239,240Pu in soil samples from the Motueka Valley (New Zealand) and for the first time from two remote islands Rarotonga and Atiu (Cook Islands) in the South Pacific. 236U and 239,240Pu were measured using Accelerator Mass Spectrometry (AMS) at the Australian National University. The 236U and 239Pu isotope concentrations versus soil depth and the 240Pu/239Pu and 236U/239Pu isotope ratios are discussed for each site.

Due to the low organic strength and low carbon/nitrogen ratio of the CEPS effluent, COD and NH4+-N were effectively removed by the MBBRs but not by the SBR. Of the two MBBRs, MBBR2 filled with LEVAPOR biocarrier cubes performed even better than MBBR1 filled with K3 polystyrene biocarriers. The continuous decline of the sludge concentration in the SBR and the high and stable biomass content in MBBR2 contributed to their performances. High-throughput sequencing analysis showed that the reactors had selective effects on the bacterial community structure. Principal coordinate analysis indicated the different dynamic successions in the three reactors. Network analysis showed different community composition and diversity that were highly suggestive of different bacterial interactions among the three bioreactors.",Hyperglycaemia is an under-appreciated but modifiable risk factor in managing people with type 1 diabetes and fragility fractures.,https://www.ncbi.nlm.nih.gov/pubmed/31082672,"Foot (Edinburgh, Scotland)",2019 06 04,"There are two major musculoskeletal effects of Type 1 diabetes mellitus (T1DM) - fragility fractures and impaired fracture union.

This study aims to evaluate the effects of wearing an Ankle Stabilizing Orthosis (ASO) ankle brace unilaterally on the dominant side on bilateral ankle joint kinetics and kinematics and peroneus longus EMG activity. Since a significant proportion of ankle injuries in basketball occur during rebounding, data was collected during a simulated rebounding task. Rebounding is defined as the act of retrieving a missed shot attempt. Subjects oftentimes jump vertically to acquire the basketball as it rebounds from the backboard or rim. Sixteen subjects participated in the study (11 males, 5 females; mean ageâ=â26.94 years, SDâ=â5.32; mean height 1.72âm, SDâ=â0.08; mean weight 73.95âkg, SDâ=â13.68). Participants completed the rebounding task in braced (ASO) and unbraced (UB) conditions. Ankle and foot inversion angles, ankle inversion moments and peroneus longus EMG activity were recorded and analysed to determine the effects of wearing an ankle brace unilaterally. In the dominant limb, when compared to UB, ASO reduced ankle and foot inversion, and increased ankle inversion moments. No significant differences were observed in peroneus longus EMG activity. In the non-dominant limb, no significant differences were observed for any of the parameters. These results suggest that wearing an ASO ankle brace on the dominant ankle reduces maximum ankle and foot inversion angles without posing an increased risk to the unbraced leg. However, the increased ankle inversion moments in the braced ankle suggest that there are adjustments regarding force distribution, perhaps due to the restricted range of motion."

In the brain, the Î±3 isoform of Na+, K+-ATPase is vital for neuronal function. The enzyme and its regulators, endogenous cardiac steroids (ECS), were implicated in neuropsychiatric disorders. GABAergic neurotransmission was also studied extensively in diseases such as schizophrenia and bipolar disorder (BD). Post mortem brain samples from subjects with depression, schizophrenia or BD and non-psychiatric controls were provided by the Stanley Medical Research Institute. ECS levels were determined by ELISA. Expression levels of the three Na+, K+-ATPase-Î± isoforms, Î±1, Î±2 and Î±3, were determined by Western blot analysis. The Î±3 levels in GABAergic neurons in different regions of the brain were quantified by fluorescence immunohistochemistry. The results show that Na+, K+ -ATPase Î±3 isoform levels were lower in GABAergic neurons in the frontal cortex in BD and schizophrenia as compared with the controls (nâ¯=â¯15 subjects per group). A study on a 'mini-cohort' (nâ¯=â¯3 subjects per group) showed that the Î±3 isoform levels were also lower in GABAergic neurons in the hippocampus, but not amygdala, of bipolar and schizophrenic subjects. In the temporal cortex, higher Na+, K+ -ATPase Î±3 protein levels were found in the three psychiatric groups. No significant differences in ECS levels were found in this brain area. This is the first report on the distribution of Î±3 in specific neurons in the human brain in association with mental illness. These results strengthen the hypothesis for the involvement of Na+, K+ -ATPase in neuropsychiatric diseases.",Maternal deprivation increases microglial activation and neuroinflammatory markers in the prefrontal cortex and hippocampus of infant rats.,https://www.ncbi.nlm.nih.gov/pubmed/31082652,Journal of psychiatric research,2019 06 09,"A relationship between neuroinflammation and the development of psychiatric disorder have been revealed by many studies in the past decade. Although studies have shown that stressors can induce long-term changes that may be related to behavioral responses, these alterations have been poorly studied soon after a stressor, such as maternal deprivation (MD). Thus, this study was designed to investigate the acute effect of experimental induction of MD on inflammatory and microglial activation markers in the brain of infant rats. Early MD was induced from postnatal day (PND) 1-10. On PND 10 the prefrontal cortex (PFC) and hippocampus from MD and control groups were removed to investigate microglial activation and neuroinflammatory markers. In the PFC the expressions of cluster of differentiation molecule 11B (CD11B), toll-like receptor (TLR)-2, and TLR-4 were increased in rats subjected to MD. The arginase expression was elevated in the PFC and hippocampus of maternally deprived rats. The cytokines interleukin-5 (IL-5), -6, -7, -10, tumor necrosis factor (TNF-Î±), and interferon gamma (INF-Î³) were increased in the PFC of MD rats group. In the PFC the macrophage inflammatory proteins (MIP)-1Î± levels were reduced in MD rats group. In the hippocampus only the levels of TNF-Î± and INF-Î³ were elevated in infant rats subjected to MD. In conclusion, our results support the hypothesis that neuroinflammation and microglial activation, mainly in the PFC, could be involved with changes in the brain resident cells following MD, and these alterations could be associated to the development of psychiatric conditions late in life.","Depression- and anxiogenic-like behaviors induced by lipopolysaccharide in mice are reversed by a selenium-containing indolyl compound: Behavioral, neurochemical and computational insights involving the serotonergic system.",https://www.ncbi.nlm.nih.gov/pubmed/31082651,Journal of psychiatric research,2019 06 09,"Major depression and anxiety are highly incapacitating psychiatric disorders often present simultaneously, and the causal relationship between these disorders and inflammation are under extensive investigation. The treatment for this comorbidity still relies on drugs acting on the serotonergic neurotransmission, but the modulation of immune-inflammatory pathways has attained an increasing interest in the drug discovery. We have previously demonstrated that the selenoorganic compound 3-[(4-chlorophenyl)selanyl]-1-methyl-1H-indole (CMI) possess antioxidant, anti-inflammatory, antinociceptive and antidepressant-like effect in mice. Considering these pharmacological properties and the structural similarities between tryptophan, serotonin and CMI, the aim of the present study was to investigate whether CMI ameliorates depression- and anxiogenic-like behavior induced by lipopolysaccharide (LPS) in Swiss male mice by modulating the serotonergic system and reducing neuroinflammation. The administration of CMI (1â¯mg/kg, i.g) reversed the behavioral deficits induced by LPS (0.83â¯mg/kg, i.p) in the tail suspension test, splash test and elevated plus maze. The pre-treatment of mice with WAY100635 (5-HT1A receptor antagonist), ketanserin (5-HT2A/2C receptor antagonist) and ondansetron (5-HT3 receptor antagonist) prevented the antidepressant- and anxiolytic-like effect elicited by CMI treatment after the LPS challenge. The administration of CMI also counteracted the increased expression of pro-inflammatory cytokines and indoleamine 2,3-dioxygenase (IDO) in the prefrontal cortex and hippocampus of mice challenged with LPS. Additionally, a molecular docking analysis showed that CMI binds to the active site of the serotonin transporter and IDO. These findings suggest that CMI reversed behavioral and biochemical alterations in the depression-anxiety comorbidity induced by LPS, possibly by modulation of neuroinflammatory mediators and the serotonergic system.","Development of coordination polyureas derived from amine terminated polyurea and metal ions having 'd5', 'd7', 'd8' and 'd10' orbitals: From synthesis to applications.",https://www.ncbi.nlm.nih.gov/pubmed/31082650,"Spectrochimica acta.

In accordance with the previous studies in humans, we propose that FMÎ¸ activity indexes the control needed to maintain the meditation state; whereas alpha activity is related to the preparation needed to achieve the meditative state. Without enough mental preparation, one often struggles with and has difficulty achieving a meditative state. Animal work provides further evidence supporting the hypothesis that mindfulness meditation induces white matter changes through increasing FMÎ¸ activity.

Based on the metal concentrations measured in oyster Crassostrea hongkongensis, we documented a change in dominance of metal contamination from Cd, Cr, Cu, Ni and Zn to Ag, Cd, Cu and Zn. In general, metal concentrations were higher in upstream stations and displayed a clear up-downstream gradient. Compared to the historical values, we noted the reductions in Cd, Cr and Ni concentrations, and the changing inputs due to evolving industrial activities were responsible for shaping the metal contamination profile in the PRE region. Along with metal concentrations, a suite of biomarkers was analyzed. Among the metals measured in the oyster tissues, Ag, Cd, Cu, Ni and Zn showed the strongest associations with pro-oxidant and oxidative stress responses (superoxide dismutase, lipid peroxidation and lysosomal membrane destabilization) and detoxification responses (glutathione and metallothionein), suggesting that the present metal contamination still exerts significant amount of stress in biota in the PRE. Metal contamination in estuaries in China is still severe compared to other countries, therefore continuous efforts should be taken to monitor the changing metal profiles with necessary control and remediation measures.",Evaluation of tetracycline phytotoxicity by seed germination stage and radicle elongation stage tests: A comparison of two typical methods for analysis.,https://www.ncbi.nlm.nih.gov/pubmed/31082610,"Environmental pollution (Barking, Essex : 1987)",2019 05 28,"Biological tests with plant seeds have been adopted in many studies to investigate the phytotoxicity of pollutants to facilitate the control of risks and remain to be optimized. In this work, the experiment with a small sample size (Experiment 1) and the experiment with a large one (Experiment 2) were designed to study the effect of tetracycline (TC) on Chinese cabbage (Brassica rapa L.) at seed germination and radicle elongation stages. At the former stage, germination number data were obtained to analyze the germination energy (GE) and to judge the probability of the number of germinated seeds (Pn) by the binomial distribution model in Experiment 1. While germination time-to-number data were obtained to analyze the mean time to germination (MGT), the estimate of mean time to germination (EMGT) by survival analysis method, the time to germination for 50% of total seeds (T50) and the germination rate (GR) besides GE in Experiment 2. At the latter stage, the data of radicle length (RL) were obtained in all the experiments and the influence from the former stage on this stage was excluded in Experiment 2 but not in Experiment 1. Results showed that TC had universal adverse effects on the latter stage but not on the former stage in the experiments. Considering the availability of germination data for statistical analysis and the robustness of RL data, the methods adopted in Experiment 2 were more feasible than those in Experiment 1. In addition, Chinese cabbage seeds with medium size have the character of rapid germination compared with the commonly used crop species and can be used to shorten the experimental cycle to study the responses of seeds to pollutants to evaluate the phytotoxicity. We introduced survival analysis method to analyze the germination time-to-number data obtained in seed germination test to evaluate the phytotoxicity of tetracycline.","Long-term effects of an early-life exposure of fathead minnows to sediments containing bitumen. Part I: Survival, deformities, and growth.",https://www.ncbi.nlm.nih.gov/pubmed/31082609,"Environmental pollution (Barking, Essex : 1987)",2019 05 28,"The aim of this study was to investigate the long-term effects of a short exposure to natural sediments within the Athabasca oil sand formation to critical stages of embryo-larval development in fathead minnows (Pimephales promelas). Three different sediments were used: Ref sediment from the upper Steepbank River tested at 3â¯g/L (containing 12.2â¯ng/g âPAHs), and two bitumen-rich sediments tested at 1 and 3â¯g/L; one from the Ells River (Ells downstream, 6480â¯ng/g âPAHs) and one from the Steepbank River (Stp downstream, 4660â¯ng/g âPAHs). Eggs and larvae were exposed to sediments for 21 days, then transferred to clean water for a 5-month grow-out and recovery period. Larval fish had significantly decreased survival after exposure to 3â¯g/L sediment from Stp downstream, and decreased growth (length and weight at 16 days post hatch) in Ells and Stp downstream sediments at both 1 and 3â¯g/L. Decreased tail length was a sensitive endpoint in larval fish exposed to Ells and Stp downstream sediments for 21 days compared to Ref sediment. After the grow-out in clean water, all growth effects from the bitumen-containing sediments recovered, but adult fish from Stp downstream 3â¯g/L sediment had significant increases in jaw deformities. The study shows the potential for fish to recover from the decreased growth effects caused by sediments containing oil sands-related compounds, but that some effects of the early-life sediment exposure occur later on in adult fish.",Nanobody-based fluorescence resonance energy transfer immunoassay for noncompetitive and simultaneous detection of ochratoxin a and ochratoxin B.,https://www.ncbi.nlm.nih.gov/pubmed/31082608,"Environmental pollution (Barking, Essex : 1987)",2019 05 28,"A noncompetitive and homogeneous fluorescence resonance energy transfer (FRET) immunoassay was developed using a nanobody (Nb) for highly sensitive and simultaneous detection of ochratoxin A (OTA) and ochratoxin B (OTB). The promoted intrinsic fluorescence (Î»ex: 280â¯nm) of tryptophan residues (donor) in Nb can excite the fluorescence of OTA and OTB (acceptor) for detection (Î»em: 430â¯nm). Using optimal conditions, the limits of detection of the Nb-based FRET immunoassay were 0.06 and 0.12â¯ng/mL for OTA and OTB, respectively. Minimal cross reactivity was detected for several analogues of OTA and OTB as well as nonspecific proteins and antibodies. Acceptable accuracy and precision were obtained in the spike and recovery study, and the results correlated well with those by HPLC. These results demonstrated that the developed method could be a useful tool for noncompetitive, homogeneous, and simultaneous detection of OTA and OTB as well as other environmental analytes with similar fluorescence properties.",Toxicokinetic-toxicodynamic modeling of cadmium and lead toxicity to larvae and adult zebrafish.,https://www.ncbi.nlm.nih.gov/pubmed/31082606,"Environmental pollution (Barking, Essex : 1987)",2019 05 28,"Toxicity of hazard materials to organism is different between larvae and adult zebrafish. However, this different effect was seldom considered in toxicological modeling. Here, we measured Cd and Pb toxicity for larvae and adult zebrafish (Danio rerio) and assessed whether metal toxicity can be better simulated by the one-compartment or two-compartment toxicokinetic (TK) and toxicodynamic (TD) models with assumption of stochastic death (SD) and individual tolerance (IT), respectively. Results showed that, for larvae, the one-compartment model generally ï¬tted the observed accumulation and survival better than two-compartment model. In contrast, for adult, the two-compartment model simulation satisfied the observed accumulation and survival better than one-compartment model. In addition, both the SD and the IT models generally described the Cd or Pb toxicity well, although the IT model predictions were slightly better than the SD model in adult fish, the opposite phenomenon was observed in larvae. Our results suggested that variations in both TK and TD parameters might be needed to quantify the toxicity sensitivity in larvae and adult zebrafish, and accounting these variations in mechanistic toxicological effect models (e.g. TK-TD) will allow more accurate predictions of hazard materials effects to organisms.",Sources and burial fluxes of sedimentary organic carbon in the northern Bering Sea and the northern Chukchi Sea in response to global warming.,https://www.ncbi.nlm.nih.gov/pubmed/31082605,The Science of the total environment,2019 05 28,"The Arctic and subarctic seas are the major CO2 sink areas on earth. In this study, the vertical variation characteristics of organic carbon, total nitrogen and their ratio (Corg/Nt), stable isotopes Î´13C and Î´15N, and BIT (branched and isoprenoid tetraether) index of GDGTs (glycerol dialkyl glycerol tetraethers) in combination with 210Pb-dating were used to analyze the changes in the marine and terrestrial sources of organic carbon in the northern Bering Sea (site 1), western Beaufort Sea slope (site 2) and northern Chukchi Sea (site 3). Organic carbon burial fluxes (OCBF) in the context of global warming were also explored at sites 1 and 3. The results showed that organic matter in these sediments were a mixed input of marine and terrestrial sources, and the BIT index and Î´13C of site 2 suggested that the terrestrial soil organic matter was dominant. Based on a combination of 210Pb dating and Corg, the sedimentary OCBF at site 1 was 2.29-3.65â¯mgâ¯cm-2â¯y-1, and at site 3 was 0.00-0.41â¯mgâ¯cm-2â¯y-1. The temperature anomalies and sea ice changes in the Arctic in the past 100â¯years were compared with the burial fluxes of the terrestrial organic carbon. At site 1, the results indicated that fast melting of seasonal sea ice led to earlier arrival of ice algae bloom, enhanced zooplankton feeding and reduced carbon burial from 1947 to 2010, and the sudden increase in carbon burial after 2010 was attributed to an increase in primary productivity and terrestrial organic matter input due to an accelerated melting of sea ice. There was a smaller change in marine organic carbon content in site 3, but OCBF increased after a pre-1965 decrease, mainly controlled by terrestrial organic matter input associated with temperature rising and sea ice melting during recent decades.",Using a systemic approach to address the requirement for Integrated Water Resource Management within the Water Framework Directive.,https://www.ncbi.nlm.nih.gov/pubmed/31082604,The Science of the total environment,2019 05 28,"Sustainable management of water resources calls for integration of ideas and approaches and revolves around assessment of causal-effect relationships as tools towards defining informed mitigation options and planning. The current paper presents a new holistic approach developed within the Globaqua Coordination Project that combines indicator-based well-established and tested concepts towards developing informed Programmes of Measures and River basin management plans: a. The DPSIR framework that has been engaged as central instrument to address the Water Framework Directive requirements and the concepts embedded in the Integrated Water Resource Management; b. The Ecosystem Services Approach emphasizing on the links between ecosystem services, changes in ecosystems and human well-being, c. Scenario assessment for valuation of future conditions to ensure the sustainability in the use of water resources. The implementation of the new combined framework in two river basins, Ebro in Spain and Evrotas in Greece, stressed the need for revised options targeting elimination of water pollution, measures to ensure water supply that covers the demand even under conditions of climate change and increased water stress and the need for improved valuation of environmental and resource use costs.","Spatial distribution of parabens, triclocarban, triclosan, bisphenols, and tetrabromobisphenol A and its alternatives in municipal sewage sludges in China.",https://www.ncbi.nlm.nih.gov/pubmed/31082603,The Science of the total environment,2019 05 26,"Parabens, triclocarban (TCC), triclosan (TCS), bisphenols (BPs), and tetrabromobisphenol A and its alternatives (TBBPAs) are used in a broad range of daily consumer products and industrial productions. Concerns have been raised over exposure of humans to these chemicals, because of their adverse health effects. However, information on the spatial distribution of parabens, TCC, TCS, BPs and TBBPAs in sludge from waste water treatment plants (WWTPs) in China is still limited. In this study, 19 endocrine disrupting chemicals, including six parabens, two antimicrobials (TCC and TCS), eight BPs and three TBBPAs, were determined in sludges from 46 WWTPs across China. Concentrations of target chemicals were found in a decreased order as: â(TCC+TCS) (mean: 3930, range: 1340-11,100ng/g dw)>â8BPs (201, 23.1-1240ng/g dw)>â6parabens (67.9, 10.4-272ng/g dw)>â3TBBPAs (18.4, 1.36-195ng/g dw). Methyl paraben (MeP), TCC, bisphenol A (BPA) and tetrabromobisphenol A (TBBPA) were the major compounds found in sludge, accounting for 89.0%, 57.7%, 85.8% and 93.3% of â6parabens, â(TCC+TCS), â8BPs and â3TBBPAs, respectively. Elevated concentrations of BPs and TBBPAs were found in sludges from the Northeast China and Central South China (p<0.05), respectively, whereas there were no significant spatial difference in concentrations of parabens or antimicrobials among different geographical regions (p>0.05). Calculation of mass loading showed that sludge from East China (1340kg/yr) and South Central China (1060kg/yr) released relatively more such chemicals. This nationwide study provided baseline concentrations of these chemicals in sludges and estimated their environmental release through sludge in China.",Biodegradation of mixed polycyclic aromatic hydrocarbons by pure and mixed cultures of biosurfactant producing thermophilic and thermo-tolerant bacteria.,https://www.ncbi.nlm.nih.gov/pubmed/31082602,The Science of the total environment,2019 05 26,"Applicability of thermophilic and thermo-tolerant microorganisms for biodegradation of polycyclic aromatic hydrocarbons (PAHs) with low water solubility is an interesting strategy for improving the biodegradation efficiency. In this study, we evaluated utility of thermophilic and thermo-tolerant bacteria isolated from Unkeshwar hot spring (India) for biodegradation of four different PAHs. Water samples were enriched in mineral salt medium (MSM) containing a mixture of four PAHs compounds (anthracene: ANT, fluorene: FLU, phenanthrene: PHE and pyrene: PYR) at 37â¯Â°C and 50â¯Â°C. After growth based screening, four potent strains obtained which were identified as Aeribacillus pallidus (UCPS2), Bacillus axarquiensis (UCPD1), Bacillus siamensis (GHP76) and Bacillus subtilis subsp. inaquosorum (U277) based on the 16S rRNA gene sequence analysis. Degradation of mixed PAH compounds was evaluated by pure as well as mixed cultures under shake flask conditions using MSM supplemented with 200â¯mg/L concentration of PAHs (50â¯mg/L of each compound) for 15â¯days at 37â¯Â°C and 50â¯Â°C. A relatively higher degradation of ANT (92%- 96%), FLU (83% - 86%), PHE (16% - 54%) and PYR (51% - 71%) was achieved at 50â¯Â°C by Aeribacillus sp. (UCPS2) and mixed culture. Furthermore, crude oil was used as a substrate to study the degradation of same PAHs using these organisms which also revealed with similar results with the higher degradation at 50â¯Â°C. Interestingly, PAH-degrading strains were also positive for biosurfactant production. Biosurfactants were identified as the variants of surfactins (lipopeptide biosurfactants) based on analytical tools and phylogenetic analysis of the surfactin genes. Overall, this study has shown that hot spring microbes may have a potential for PAHs degradation and also biosurfactant production at a higher temperature, which could provide a novel perspective for removal of PAHs residues from oil contaminated sites."

A Monte Carlo approach was used for the sensitivity analysis of the AI models and input parameters. For the construction and validation of the models, 189 soft clayey soil samples were analyzed. In the models study, 13 input parameters: depth of sample, bulk density, plasticity index, moisture content, clay content, specific gravity, void ratio, liquid limit, dry density, porosity, plastic limit, degree of saturation, and liquidity index were used to obtain one output parameter ""Cc"". Validation of the models was done using statistical methods such as Mean Absolute Error (MAE), Root Mean Square Error (RMSE), and Coefficient of determination (R2). Results of the model validation indicate that though performance of all the three models is good but SVM model is the best in the prediction of Cc. The Monte Carlo method based sensitivity analysis results show that out of the 13 input parameters considered for the models study, four parameters namely clay, degree of saturation, specific gravity and depth of sample are the most relevant in the prediction of Cc, and other parameters (bulk density, dry density, void ratio and porosity) are the most insignificant parameters for the prediction of Cc. Removal of these insignificant parameters helped to reduce the dimension of the input space and also model running time, and improved significantly the performance of the AI models. The results of this study might help in selecting the suitable AI models and input parameters for better and quick prediction of the Cc of soil.",Modelling geochemical and kinetic processes involved in lead (Pb) remobilization during resuspension events of contaminated sediments.,https://www.ncbi.nlm.nih.gov/pubmed/31082590,The Science of the total environment,2019 05 28,"The objective of this paper is to present a model simulating and predicting the exchange kinetics of lead (Pb) between contaminated sediments and water during resuspension events potentially occurring in reservoirs. We developed an innovative model that combines thermodynamic speciation of particulate surfaces (oxides and Particulate Organic Carbon (POC)), thermodynamic Pb speciation in water, and kinetic modelling of exchanges between free Pb and particulate sites (i.e., dissolution of a carbonate carrier phase, adsorption/coprecipitation and desorption/dissolution to/from oxides, and adsorption and desorption/degradation to/from particulate organic particles). We used results from laboratory resuspension experiments performed on sediments from three contaminated dam reservoirs to calibrate a new chemical speciation model. Uptake and release processes to/from sediments were found to be controlled by at least two successive reactions that are associated with two particulate pools (here oxides and POC). Kinetic adsorption and desorption rates were calibrated for seven experimental conditions. Variability in kinetic rates allowed evaluation of the effect of the solid-to-liquid ratio and sediment origin on exchange kinetics at the water-particle interface. The kinetic release of dissolved Pb by desorption or dissolution from the oxides was reproduced almost identically between the experiments, regardless of the solid-to-liquid ratio or sediment origin. Long-term readsorption on POC sites is more variable, even if ranges of variation in the adsorption and desorption kinetic rates related to POC remain limited, considering that tested sediments vary significantly. CAPSULE: A kinetic model simulating the dynamics of lead (Pb) during sediment resuspension was developed and calibrated to laboratory experiments performed on three contaminated sediments.",Biodegradation of oil-based plastics in the environment: Existing knowledge and needs of research and innovation.,https://www.ncbi.nlm.nih.gov/pubmed/31082589,The Science of the total environment,2019 05 26,"The production of synthetic oil-based plastics has led to the accumulation of huge amounts of the plastic waste in the environment, especially in the marine system, very often the final sink for many types of conventional wasted plastics. In particular, (micro)plastics account for the majority of litter items in the marine environment and a high percentage of such litter is originating from land sources. Attempts to mitigate the harmful effects of conventional plastics such as the development of novel management strategies together with the gradual substitution of them with biodegradable (bio)plastics are representing future solutions. However, high amounts of conventional plastics have been accumulating in the environment since several years. Although many studies reported on their potential biodegradation by microbes in and from terrestrial environments, very little is known about the biodegradability of these plastics in freshwater systems and only recently more reports on their biodegradation by marine microorganisms/in marine environment were made available. In this review, we first provide a summary of the approaches applied for monitoring and assessing conventional plastics biodegradation under defined conditions. Then, we reviewed historical and recent findings related to biodegradation of four major plastics produced in European Union (EU), i.e. Polyethylene, Polyvinyl Chloride, Polypropylene and Polystyrene, in terrestrial and aquatic environments and by pure and mixed microbial cultures obtained from them.",Linking heterotrophic bacterioplankton community composition to the optical dynamics of dissolved organic matter in a large eutrophic Chinese lake.,https://www.ncbi.nlm.nih.gov/pubmed/31082588,The Science of the total environment,2019 05 26,"Elucidation of the linkages between the bacterial community composition and chromophoric dissolved organic matter (CDOM) in lake ecosystems is critical for the understanding of the inland water carbon cycling. Despite substantial research into the relationship between the bacteria community and the bulk DOM pool, knowledge of the specific relationship between the optical dynamics of DOM and the bacterioplankton community in lake ecosystems is still poor. We investigated the linkages between the optical dynamics of DOM and bacteria composition in shallow eutrophic Lake Taihu, China. Redundancy Analysis (RDA) indicated that besides water temperature and phytoplankton biomass, also CDOM was an important factor determining the composition of the bacterial community. Generalized Additive Models (GAM) showed that terrestrial humic-like C1 and tyrosine-like C4 were the key factors explaining the abundance of the main bacterial clades. C1 was closely correlated with Verrucomicrobia, Actinobacteria, Alphaproteobacteria, Betaproteobacteria and Planctomycetes, and C4 was closely related to the latter two and to Bacteroidetes. At family level, the dominant families - Pelagibacteraceae (Alphaproteobacteria) and Gemmataceae (Planctomycetes) - were related to both allochthonous and autochthonous CDOM fluorophores but responded differently to the various CDOM components. Tryptophan-like C2 was significantly and positively correlated with Gemmataceae and Ellin6075 (Acidobacteria). Additionally, we found that the biomasses of Cyanophyta, terrestrial humic-like C1, tryptophan-like C4 and C5 were significantly related to the richness of heterotrophic bacterioplankton. Our results provide new insight into the relationship between bacteria and DOM optical dynamics although the mechanisms leading to these relationships need further experimental investigations.",Valuation of ecosystem services using choice experiment with preference heterogeneity: A benefit transfer analysis across inland river basin.,https://www.ncbi.nlm.nih.gov/pubmed/31082587,The Science of the total environment,2019 05 28,"River ecosystem services offer a variety of benefits to the inhabitants of inland areas. For the valuation of environmental goods and services in the context of attaining a better environmental status across Heihe River basin (HRB), Northwest of China by 2020, a survey was conducted employing choice experiment approach across the entire river basin. The selected ecological attributes were defined in combination with ecological improvements in the three sub-basins namely upper, middle and lower sub-basins. For estimating spatial preference heterogeneity, the benefits for the inhabitants were estimated by conditional logit and mixed logit models. Results indicated that the willingness to pay (WTP) estimates for river water quality, farmland irrigation, sandstorm days, lake area, biodiversity, landscape and leisure & entertainment were significantly different across sub-basins. The WTP for water quality in upper basin was RMB 126.6 per year, while in middle and lower sub-basin was RMB 97.1 and 66.4 per year respectively. The estimates of mixed logit model indicated the reduced transfer errors with the insertion of taste heterogeneity. However, transferring benefits from middle sub-basin to upper sub-basin the estimated transfer errors were 27.3%, from lower to middle the transfer errors were 23.4% and from upper to lower the transfer errors were 14.1%. Our obtained results recommend the transferability of non-market benefits among sub-basins.",Modelling urban cyclists' exposure to black carbon particles using high spatiotemporal data: A statistical approach.,https://www.ncbi.nlm.nih.gov/pubmed/31082586,The Science of the total environment,2019 05 26,"This is a pioneering work in South America to model the exposure of cyclists to black carbon (BC) while riding in an urban area with high spatiotemporal variability of BC concentrations. We report on mobile BC concentrations sampled on 10 biking sessions in the city of Curitiba (Brazil), during rush hours of weekdays, covering four routes and totaling 178â¯km. Moreover, simultaneous BC measurements were conducted within a street canyon (street and rooftop levels) and at a site located 13â¯km from the city center. We used two statistical approaches to model the BC concentrations: multiple linear regression (MLR) and a machine-learning technique called random forests (RF). A pool of 25 candidate variables was created, including pollution measurements, traffic characteristics, street geometry and meteorology. The aggregated mean BC concentration within 30-m buffers along the four routes was 7.09â¯Î¼gâ¯m-3, with large spatial variability (5th and 95th percentiles of 1.75 and 16.83â¯Î¼gâ¯m-3, respectively). On average, the concentrations at the street canyon faÃ§ade (5â¯m height) were lower than the mobile data but higher than the urban background levels. The MLR model explained a low percentage of variance (24%), but was within the values found in the literature for on-road BC mobile data. RF explained a larger variance (54%) with the additional advantage of having lower requirements for the target and predictor variables. The most impactful predictor for both models was the traffic rate of heavy-duty vehicles. Thus, to reduce the BC exposure of cyclists and residents living close to busy streets, we emphasize the importance of renewing and/or retrofitting the diesel-powered fleet, particularly public buses with old vehicle technologies. Urban planners could also use this valuable information to project bicycle lanes with greater separation from the circulation of heavy-duty diesel vehicles.","Kinetic and mechanistic insight into the OH-initiated atmospheric oxidation of 2,3,7,8-tetrachlorodibenzo-p-dioxin via OH-addition and hydrogen abstraction pathways: A theoretical investigation.",https://www.ncbi.nlm.nih.gov/pubmed/31082585,The Science of the total environment,2019 05 28,"The 2,3,7,8-tetrachlorodibenzo-p-dioxin (TCDD) is the most toxic polychlorinated dibenzo-p-dioxin.

The kinetic data were corrected for quantum tunneling by the Wigner and Eckart models. All OH addition and hydrogen atom abstraction channels were thermodynamically exergonic. The kinetic and thermodynamic data analysis at the reliable level MPWB1K/MG3S//M06-2X/MG3S indicate that the addition of OH to the carbon atom adjacent to the oxygen atom in dioxin ring leads to the formation of predominant adduct. The calculated bimolecular rate constant for the formation of predominant adduct was ~5.97-6.75â¯Ãâ¯10-13â¯cm3â¯molecule-1â¯s-1, its branching ratio was ~0.955, and the overall rate constant for the OH-initiated oxidation of TCDD was ~6.25-7.08â¯Ãâ¯10-13â¯cm3â¯molecule-1â¯s-1.

CCOC is inherently chemotherapy resistance, but the exact mechanism of this resistance has yet to be established. Prosurvival signaling, such as through the MAPK cascade, is one way in which cancer cells can evade chemotherapy. We have determined that CCOC exhibits baseline elevated levels of MAPK activity, which increase further upon cisplatin exposure. We have developed a novel MEK inhibitor, URML-3881, to test the effect of MAPK inhibition in CCOC. URML-3881 was found to reduce in vitro CCOC viability through apoptosis and proliferation inhibition, yet it failed to induce in vivo tumor regression. Similarly, cisplatin alone had minimal impact on tumor growth, but remarkably, the combination of MEK inhibition and cisplatin led to a significant and prolonged tumor regression. These studies confirm that the combination of MEK inhibition with URML-3881 and cisplatin is superior to either agent alone in CCOC. Our data support the design of future preclinical and clinical studies into the combination of MEK inhibition and platinum-based chemotherapy as a treatment strategy for CCOC.","Contamination and spatial distribution of parabens, their metabolites and antimicrobials in sediment from Korean coastal waters.",https://www.ncbi.nlm.nih.gov/pubmed/31082583,Ecotoxicology and environmental safety,2019 06 16,"Synthetic antimicrobials known as parabens, triclosan (TCS), and triclocarban (TCC) are emerging environmental contaminants. Limited studies on these contaminants have been conducted in coastal environments. In our study, parabens, their metabolites, TCS, and TCC were measured in sediment collected along the Korean coast, to investigate contamination status, spatial distribution, and potential health risks to coastal environments. Methyl paraben and 4-hydroxybenzoic acid were detected in all sediment samples, suggesting widespread contamination. Total concentrations of parent parabens, their metabolites, TCS, and TCC ranged from 0.19 to 11.2 (mean: 2.40) ng/g dry weight, 9.65 to 480 (mean: 120) ng/g dry weight, and < limit of quantification (LOQ)-6.10 (mean: 0.41) ng/g dry weight, and from < LOQ-41.0 (mean: 2.78) ng/g dry weight, respectively. The overall contamination of parabens and antimicrobials in sediment was different from that reported for persistent organic pollutants due to different contamination sources among chemical groups. Significant correlation was found among target contaminants in sediment, suggesting the existence of a common source. Total organic carbon (TOC) was significantly correlated with the concentrations of target contaminants, implying a major factor for coastal distribution of parabens and antimicrobials. The concentrations of parabens and TCS measured in sediment did not exceed a hazard quotient (HQ), implying low potential health risks associated with exposure to these contaminants. This is the first study to report the nationwide distribution of parabens, their metabolites, and antimicrobials in the coastal environments of Korea.",Selenium spiked in soil promoted zinc accumulation of Chinese cabbage and improved its antioxidant system and lipid peroxidation.,https://www.ncbi.nlm.nih.gov/pubmed/31082582,Ecotoxicology and environmental safety,2019 06 16,"Selenium (Se) and zinc (Zn) are necessary mineral nutrients for human body but millions of people have an inadequate intake of them, and eat food enriched with Se and Zn may minimize these problems.

When 0.5â¯mgâ¯kg-1 Se +30Â mgÂ kg-1 Zn and 1.0â¯mgâ¯kg-1 Se +30Â mgÂ kg-1 Zn were spiked in soils, Zn concentrations in roots and leaves of Chinese cabbage were significantly increased (pâ¯<â¯0.05) by 20.2%, 37.8% and 17.9%, 34.1% respectively compared to the treatment of 30â¯mgâ¯kg-1 Zn added, and the latter was significantly higher (pâ¯<â¯0.05) than that of former, indicating Se significantly promoted Zn accumulation. Almost all physiological indexes including POD, SOD, CAT, APX, GR, Chlorophyll a, Chlorophyll b, Carotenoids, MDA and Free proline in the treatments of Se or Zn spiked were significantly improved (pâ¯<â¯0.05) or basically unaffected compared to the control without Se or Zn added.

In recent years, these unique properties have attracted much attention in the biomedical field to enable real-time tissue imaging (bioimaging), diagnostics, single molecule probes, and drug delivery, among many other areas. The optical properties of quantum dots can be tuned by size and composition, and their high brightness, resistance to photobleaching, multiplexing capacity, and high surface-to-volume ratio make them excellent candidates for intracellular tracking, diagnostics, in vivo imaging, and therapeutic delivery. We discuss recent advances and challenges in the molecular design of quantum dots are discussed, along with applications of quantum dots as drug delivery vehicles, theranostic agents, single molecule probes, and real-time in vivo deep tissue imaging agents.

Low back pain has been linked to degeneration of the disc but reparative treatments are not currently available. Characterising the disc's 3D microstructure and its response in a physiologically relevant loading environment is required to improve understanding of degeneration and to develop new reparative treatments. In this study, techniques for imaging the native IVD, measuring internal deformation and mapping volumetric strain were applied to an in situ compressed ex vivo rat lumbar spine segment. Synchrotron X-ray micro-tomography (synchrotron CT) was used to resolve IVD structures at microscale resolution. These image data enabled 3D quantification of collagen bundle orientation and measurement of local displacement in the annulus fibrosus between sequential scans using digital volume correlation (DVC). The volumetric strain mapped from synchrotron CT provided a detailed insight into the micromechanics of native IVD tissue. The DVC findings showed that there was no slipping at lamella boundaries, and local strain patterns were of a similar distribution to the previously reported elastic network with some heterogeneous areas and maximum strain direction aligned with bundle orientation, suggesting bundle stretching and sliding. This method has the potential to bridge the gap between measures of macro-mechanical properties and the local 3D micro-mechanical environment experienced by cells. This is the first evaluation of strain at the micro scale level in the intact IVD and provides a quantitative framework for future IVD degeneration mechanics studies and testing of tissue engineered IVD replacements. STATEMENT OF SIGNIFICANCE: Synchrotron in-line phase contrast X-ray tomography provided the first visualisation of native intact intervertebral disc microstructural deformation in 3D. For two annulus fibrosus volumes of interest, collagen bundle orientation was quantified and local displacement mapped as strain. Direct evidence of microstructural influence on strain patterns could be seen such as no slipping at lamellae boundaries and maximum strain direction aligned with collagen bundle orientation. Although disc elastic structures were not directly observed, the strain patterns had a similar distribution to the previously reported elastic network. This study presents technical advances and is a basis for future X-ray microscopy, structural quantification and digital volume correlation strain analysis of soft tissue.","Mechanical and biological properties of ZnO, SiO2, and Ag2O doped plasma sprayed hydroxyapatite coating for orthopaedic and dental applications.",https://www.ncbi.nlm.nih.gov/pubmed/31082568,Acta biomaterialia,2019 06 14,"In this study, we explored a ternary dopant system utilizing 0.25â¯wt% ZnO to induce osteogenesis, 0.5â¯wt% SiO2 to induce angiogenesis, and 2.0â¯wt% Ag2O to provide secondary infection control within a plasma assisted hydroxyapatite coating for orthopaedic or dental applications. The objective of this study was to understand the effects of ZnO, SiO2, and Ag2O dopants on the mechanical and biological properties of hydroxyapatite (HA) coatings on titanium (Ti). Coatings were deposited using a 30â¯kW plasma spray system equipped with a supersonic nozzle to produce above standard coating bond strengths of 24â¯Â±â¯2â¯MPa on Ti6Al4V and 22â¯Â±â¯1â¯MPa on commercially pure Ti substrates. Antibacterial properties were revealed in vitro against E. coli and S. aureus. The ternary dopant system was implanted in 18 male Sprague-Dawley rats with timepoints of 5 and 10â¯weeks. By week 5, ZnSiAg-HA produced 32% bone mineralization of 68% total bone formation compared to only 11% bone mineralization of 55% total bone formation in the undoped coating. This system can be employed for replacement surgeries and revision surgeries to reduce healing time and enhance osseointegration. STATEMENT OF SIGNIFICANCE: Total hip replacements increased 124% from 2000 to 2010 with an ever-increasing rate due to the rise in average life span and an escalation in surgeries for young patients. Replacement surgeries come with the risk of rejection, poor integration, and infection. This study incorporates biologically relevant metallic oxides of ZnO, SiO2, and Ag2O within a hydroxyapatite coating on titanium deposited using a radio frequency induction plasma spray. A ternary dopant system has not been explored in the current literature and little is known about these particular dopants in vivo. This proposed system can be employed for replacement surgeries to lower healing time and enhance osseointegration between implant and host tissue.","Toxic lifespan of the synthetic opioid U-47,700 in Finland verified by re-analysis of UPLC-TOF-MS data.",https://www.ncbi.nlm.nih.gov/pubmed/31082566,Forensic science international,2019 06 03,"U-47,700 is a synthetic opioid that emerged on the novel psychoactive substance market a few years ago. After incorporating the substance into the urine UPLC-TOF-MS screening used in post-mortem toxicology, the drug was detected in 10 autopsy cases within routine case work. In all cases, the cause of death was accidental poisoning by U-47,700 alone or in combination with other psychoactive substances. The concentration of U-47,700 in the blood samples ranged between 0.15-2.0âmg/L with a median of 0.30âmg/L. In one of the cases with a U-47,700 concentration of 0.27âmg/L, no other psychoactive substances were detected. The stored TOF-MS analytical data from the year preceding the incorporation of U-47,700 into the screening was reprocessed in order to search for more positive cases. The data-independent acquisition of the original screening allowed for retrospective re-analysis of the full-scan data without additional experiments on the actual sample. The retrospective data-analysis revealed two additional cases positive for U-47,700. The first mention of U-47,700 on a Finnish internet discussion forum was in March 2015. After having been detected in several death cases, the drug was put under national control in November 2016 and the last fatality occurred in 2017. The toxic lifespan of U-47,700 thus lasted for approximately 2 years in Finland. Forensic and clinical laboratories need to rapidly adjust their screening procedures in order to adapt to the continuously expanding field of novel psychoactive substances.

The traditional interlaminar approach carries the risk of subsequent instability due to osseous destruction by reaching the hidden zone and exposing the nerve root. In the 1990s first reports were published on the open microsurgical ""translaminar approach"" (TLA) for the resection of migrated LDH with the intension to minimize osseous destruction. However, the open technique still had the disadvantage of soft tissue and muscle dissection. Endoscopic tubular procedures were developed to reduce the approach related muscle trauma. Endoscopic tubular surgery combines bimanual microsurgical technique with continuous endoscopic visualization of the surgical field. The HD-endoscopic visualization allows for excellent illumination, identification of tissue and anatomical structures. The rate of clinical success for the treatment of migrated LDH via endoscopic TLA has been reported to be up to 95%. However, the endoscopic TLA has not been analyzed extensively and reports with a detailed description are rare. The purpose of the present video is to demonstrate the endoscopic tubular TLA and resection of a migrated LDH. This is the case of a 62 year old male patient with right sided leg pain and a quadtriceps paresis due to LDH which migrated behind the L3 vertebral body. Special focus was pointed out on planning of the skin incision and the trajectory towards the disc herniation. Furthermore, the dissection and extraction of large disc herniation is explained in detail."

Amphiphilic calixarene can be obtained by modulation with both hydrophilic group and hydrophobic alkyl chain. Compared with conventional surfactant, amphiphilic calixarene has much lower critical micelle concentration and is much easier to self-assemble into different morphological aggregates. Calixarene-basedsupra-amphiphile can be designed via noncovalent bonds due to the capability of calixarene to recognize surfactant; the binding of a surfactant with calixarene can decrease the critical micelle concentration of surfactant by several times. The calixarene-surfactant complex can self-aggregate to form spherical micelles, vesicles, and spherical nanoparticles, and the aggregation behavior can be controlled by the structures and the molar ratio of surfactant to calixarene and environmental factors. Calixarene-based amphiphile and supra-amphiphile show low cytotoxicity. They can load drugs and assemble into nanocapsules with drugs. The structure of the calixarene-drug complex can respond to external stimuli, rendering the sustained release of the drug and suggesting its potential application as a drug delivery system. Recently, calixarene has also been found to selectively bind proteins, suggesting its prospect in disease diagnosis and intervention treatment in clinics. This review elaborates on the research progress in the self-assembly behaviors of calixarene-based amphiphile and supra-amphiphile and the applications of the calixarenes in drug delivery and protein recognition.

Meanwhile, ND particles possess unique spherical shape containing diamond-like structure at the core with graphitic carbon outer shell which intuitively contains many oxygen-containing functional groups at the outer surface. Such superior properties and unique structural morphology of NDs are essentially attractive to develop polymer composites with multifunctional properties. However, despite a long history from the discovery of NDs, which is dated back to the1960s, this nanoparticle has been less explored in the field of polymer (nano)composites compared with other carbon nanomaterials, e.g. carbon nanotube (CNT) and graphene. However, open literature indicates that research works in the field of polymer/ND (PND) composites have gained great momentum in the past half a decade. The present article provides a comprehensive review on recent achievements in ND based polymer composites. This review covers a very broad aspect from the synthesis, purification and functionalization of NDs to dispersion, preparation and fabrication of polymer/ND (PND) composites with a look in their recent applications for both structural and functional basis.

Thirteen novel subtypes of T. gallinae using FeHyd gene as the subtyping locus are described. Although the phylogenetic topologies derived from each single marker are complementary, they are not entirely congruent. This may reflect the complex genetic histories of the isolates analysed which appear to contain two major lineages and several that are hybrid. This new analysis consolidates much of the phylogenetic signal generated from the ITS ribotype and provides additional resolution for discrimination of T. gallinae strains. The single copy FeHyd gene provides higher resolution genotyping than ITS ribotype alone.

Glutamate binding to AMPA receptors (AMPARs) causes most AMPARs to rapidly and completely desensitize, and their desensitization kinetics influence synaptic timing. Thus, factors that alter AMPAR desensitization influence synaptic transmission. Synaptically released zinc is such a factor. Zinc is a neuromodulator with effects on amino acid receptors and synaptic transmission in many brain regions, including the olfactory bulb (OB). We have previously shown in the OB that zinc potentiates AMPAR-mediated currents at low concentrations (30â¯Î¼M, 100â¯Î¼M) and inhibits them at a higher concentration (1â¯mM). It has been hypothesized that zinc potentiates AMPARs by decreasing receptor desensitization. Here, we used cyclothiazide (CTZ), a drug that blocks AMPAR desensitization, to determine whether zinc-mediated potentiation and/or inhibition of AMPA-evoked currents reflect(s) changes in AMPAR desensitization. Zinc largely had biphasic concentration-dependent effects at OB AMPARs. CTZ completely blocked potentiation by zinc but had no significant effect on inhibition. There was a significant negative correlation between the degree of potentiation of AMPAR-mediated currents by 100â¯Î¼M zinc and a quantitative measure of the degree of AMPAR desensitization (the steady-state to peak [S:P] ratio of AMPA-evoked currents), but no correlation between the degree of current inhibition by 1â¯mM zinc and the S:P ratio. Together, these findings suggest that low zinc concentrations potentiate rat OB AMPARs by decreasing receptor desensitization, but that the inhibitory effects of higher zinc concentrations are mediated by a separate mechanism.",Auditory verbal hallucination and the auditory network: From molecules to connectivity.,https://www.ncbi.nlm.nih.gov/pubmed/31082536,Neuroscience,2019 06 10,"Auditory verbal hallucinations (AVHs) frequently occur across multiple psychiatric diseases especially in schizophrenia (SCZ) patients. Functional imaging studies have revealed the hyperactivity of the auditory cortex and disrupted auditory-verbal network activity underlying AVH etiology. This review will firstly summarize major findings from both human AVH patients and animal models, with focuses on the auditory cortex and associated cortical/sub-cortical areas. Besides mesoscale connectivity or activity data, structure and functions at synaptic level will be discussed, in conjunction with molecular mechanisms. We have summarized major findings for the pathogenesis of AVH in SCZ patients, with focuses in the auditory cortex and prefrontal cortex (PFC). Those discoveries provide explanations for AVH from different perspectives including inter-regional connectivity, local activity in specific areas, structure and functions of synapse, and potentially molecular targets. Due to the uniqueness of AVH in humans, full replica using animals seems impossible. However, we can still extract useful information from animal SCZ models based on the disruption of auditory pathway during AVH episodes. Therefore, we will further interpolate the synaptic structures and molecular targets, whose dysregulation in SCZ models may be highly related with AVH episodes. As the last part, implications for future development of treatment strategies will be discussed.",Actions of Neuropeptide Y on Synaptic Transmission in the Lateral Habenula.,https://www.ncbi.nlm.nih.gov/pubmed/31082535,Neuroscience,2019 06 10,"Neuropeptide Y is a peptide neuromodulator with protective roles including anxiolytic and antidepressant-like effects in animal models of depression and post-traumatic stress disorder. The lateral habenula (LHb) is a brain region that encodes aversive information and is closely related with mood disorders. Although LHb neurons express NPY receptors, the physiological roles of NPY in this region remain uninvestigated. In this study, we examined the actions of NPY on synaptic transmission in the LHb using whole cell patch clamp recording. We observed that NPY inhibited excitatory neurotransmission in a subset of LHb neurons whereas potentiating in a small population of neurons. Inhibitory transmission remained unchanged by NPY application in a subset of neurons but was reduced in the majority of LHb neurons recorded. The overall outcome of NPY application was a decrease in the spontaneous firing rate of the LHb, leading to hypoactivation of the LHb. Our observations indicate that although NPY has divergent effects on excitatory and inhibitory transmission, NPY receptor activation decreases LHb activity, suggesting that the LHb may partly mediate the protective roles of NPY in the central nervous system."

In the present study, by using Q-TOF/MS-based lipidomics approach, we investigated the comprehensive lipidome profiling of brain from the rats orally administrated with alcohol daily, continuously for one year. Through systematically analysis of all lipids in prefrontal cortex (PFC) and striatum region, we found that long-term alcohol exposure profoundly modified brain lipidome profiling. Notably, three kinds of lipid classes, glycerophospholipid (GP), glycerolipid (GL) and fatty acyls (FA), were significantly increased in these two brain regions. Interestingly, most of the modified lipids were involved in synthetic pathways of endoplasmic reticulum (ER), which may result in ER stress-related metabolic disruption. Moreover, alcohol-modified lipid species displayed long length of carbon chain with high degree of unsaturation. Taken together, our results firstly present that chronic alcohol exposure markedly modifies brain lipidomic profiling, which may activate ER stress and eventually result in neurotoxicity. These findings provide a new insight into the mechanism of alcohol-related brain damage.","Assessment of the carcinogenic effect of 2,3,7,8-tetrachlorodibenzo-p-dioxin using mouse embryonic stem cells to form teratoma in vivo.",https://www.ncbi.nlm.nih.gov/pubmed/31082521,Toxicology letters,2019 06 09,"As the most toxic dioxin, 2,3,7,8-tetrachlorodibenzo-p-dioxin (TCDD) has gained lots of concerns, due to its diverse deleterious effects. However, the knowledge on carcinogenic risk of TCDD during early stage of development remains scarce. The in vivo teratoma formation model based on the transplantation of embryonic stem cells (ESCs) in immunodeficient mice is appealing for studying pluripotency and tumorigenicity in developmental biology, and also shows promise in environmental toxicology, especially in carcinogenesis researches. In this study, the malignant transformation of mouse embryonic stem cells (mESCs) pretreated with TCDD was investigated during their in vivo differentiation using teratoma formation model. Based on characterization of the pluripotency and differentiation capabilities of mESCs, evil changes in teratomas derived from TCDD-exposed mESCs were systematically studied. The results showed that TCDD significantly up-regulated CYP1A1 transcriptional levels in mESCs, elevated the incidence of malignant change in mESC-derived teratomas, and caused indefinite proliferation capabilities in sequential cultures of tumor tissues. The findings suggested that TCDD could exert carcinogenic effect on mESCs during their differentiation into teratoma in vivo, and more attention should be paid to the adverse health effects of this chemical during gestation or early developmental period.",Rac1 GTPase is a critical factor in phagocytosis in the large yellow croaker Larimichthys crocea by interacting with tropomyosin.,https://www.ncbi.nlm.nih.gov/pubmed/31082520,Fish & shellfish immunology,2019 05 31,"The Rho family GTPase Rac1 acts as a molecular switch for signal transduction to regulate various cellular functions. Here, a Rac1 homolog (LcRac1) was identified in large yellow croaker (Larimichthys crocea), one of the most economically important marine fishes. The LcRac1 protein was expressed in Escherichia coli and purified. Subsequently the specific antibody was raised using the purified fusion protein (GST-LcRac1). LcRac1 was ubiquitously expressed in all 12 tissues we examined, with the highest expression in heart and blood and the weakest expression in head-kidney and spleen. Moreover, time course analysis revealed that LcRac1 expression was obviously up-regulated in liver, spleen and head-kidney after immunization with Poly I:C, LPS and Vibrio parahemolyticus. On the other hand, on the basis of protein interaction, it was found that the LcRac1 interacted with Tropomyosin, a crucial protein in the process of phagocytosis. Furthermore, RNAi assays indicated that the phagocytic percentage and phagocytic index were significantly decreased when the LcRac1 gene was silenced by sequence-specific siRNA. Fluorescence microscopy assays revealed FITC-labeled V. parahemolyticus were remarkably decreased after LcRac1 was silenced by sequence-specific siRNA at 24â¯h. These findings implicate the vital role of LcRac1 in innate immunity in the large yellow croaker.",Grouper DDX41 exerts antiviral activity against fish iridovirus and nodavirus infection.,https://www.ncbi.nlm.nih.gov/pubmed/31082519,Fish & shellfish immunology,2019 05 31,"DEAD (Asp-Glu-Ala-Asp)-box polypeptide 41 (DDX41) is a member of the DEXDc family of helicases, that has recently been identified to be a crucial intracellular DNA sensor that triggers multiple signaling molecules to activate the type I interferon response. However, the precise function of DDX41 in fish during a viral infection remains unknown. In the present study, the DDX41 homolog from orange spotted grouper, Epinephelus coioides (EcDDX41), was cloned and its potential role in the immune response to a fish viral infection were investigated. EcDDX41 encodes a putative protein of 614â¯amino acid residues that contained two conserved domains: 1) DEADc domain; and 2) HELICc domain. The sequence analysis indicated that EcDDX41 shared 99%, 94%, and 86% identity with Asian seabass (Lates calcarifer), zebrafish (Danio rerio), and humans (Homo sapiens), respectively. EcDDX41 mRNA was present in all of the detected tissues, with the highest level of expression in the gills. The level of EcDDX41 expression was up-regulated following infection with Singapore grouper iridovirus (SGIV) or red-spotted grouper nervous necrosis virus (RGNNV) in grouper spleen (GS) cell cultures, suggesting that EcDDX41 may be involved in fish virus infection. Furthermore, EcDDX41 overexpression in GS cells significantly inhibited SGIV and RGNNV replication. EcDDX41 overexpression significantly increased the expression of antiviral and inflammatory cytokine genes, including interferon regulatory factor genes (e.g., IRF1, IRF2, IRF3, and IRF7), interferon induced genes (e.g., ISG15, ISG56, IFP35, Viperin, and MXI), and pro-inflammatory cytokine genes (e.g., TNFÎ±, IL-1Î², and IL-8). Moreover, EcDDX41 positively regulated the mitochondrial antiviral-signaling protein (MAVS) and TANK-binding kinase 1 (TBK1)-induced interferon immune response, but did mediate IRF3 activation (MITA) to evoke an interferon immune response in unstimulated cells. Together, our results provide novel insight into the role of fish DDX41 in the antiviral innate immune response.",Enhanced bath immersion vaccination through microbubble treatment in the cyprinid loach.,https://www.ncbi.nlm.nih.gov/pubmed/31082518,Fish & shellfish immunology,2019 05 31,"Immunization by bath immersion is likely the simplest method of fish vaccination. Although the route of immunogenicity has not been fully identified, immersion vaccination is clearly a useful labor-saving technique. In this study, microbubble (MB) treatment was assessed for its ability to improve the efficacy of bath immersion vaccination in the cyprinid loach. MBs are commonly defined as minute particles of gas with a diameter of less than 100â¯Î¼m, which generated free radicals. Here, the efficacy of MB treatment for vaccination enhancement in the cyprinid loach was assessed in direct challenge experiments using the virulent Aeromonas hydrophila JUNAH strain; assessments comprised agglutination titer assay and non-specific parameter analysis. Agglutination titers were high in loaches that were immunized via injection with inactivated cells (FKC group); however, non-specific immune activation parameters (e.g., lysozyme, superoxide dismutase, and phagocytic activity) were more increased in loaches that were immunized via bath immersion with MB treatment. Moreover, MB-treated loaches showed comparable survival rates, relative to loaches immunized via injection with formalin inactivated cells. Thus, higher levels of non-specific immune parameters suggest increased efficacy of this vaccine approach. Improving the effectiveness of bath immersion vaccine will increase its affordability and ease of application in aquaculture.",The PFOS disturbed immunomodulatory functions via nuclear Factor-ÎºB signaling in liver of zebrafish (Danio rerio).,https://www.ncbi.nlm.nih.gov/pubmed/31082517,Fish & shellfish immunology,2019 05 31,"Excessive perfluorooctane sulfonate (PFOS) in natural water ecosystem has the potential to detrimentally affect immune system, but little is known of such effects or underlying mechanisms in fish. In the present study, we evaluated the effects of PFOS on growth performance, organizational microstructure, activities of immune-related enzymes and expressions of immune-related genes in male zebrafish (Danio rerio) exposed to different concentrations of 0, 0.02, 0.04 and 0.08â¯mg/L of PFOS for 7, 14, and 21 days or cotreatment with PFOS and PDTC to investigate the effects of PFOS on immune system and the potential toxic mechanisms caused by PFOS. The results indicated that PFOS accumulated in livers after exposure, and remarkably elevations were found in three exposure groups compared with the control group at three stages. The growth of the adult zebrafish in the experiments was significantly inhibited, the microstructures of liver were serious damaged. The ROS levels were remarkably increased. The activities of ACP, AKP, and lysozyme were obviously decreased, while the activities of MPO and NF-ÎºB were significantly increased. The expressions of immune-related mRNA were significantly affected. After co-treatment with PFOS and PDTC, the growth inhibition, the morphological damage, the ROS induction, and the expressions of immune-related mRNA were reversed. Taken together, the results indicated that PFOS can significantly inhibit the growth, disturb the immune system by changing the normal structure of liver, the activities of immune-related enzymes, and a series of gene transcriptions involved in immune regulation in liver of male zebrafish. PFOS-induced pro-inflammatory effect of hepatocytes was observed, and the involvement of NF-ÎºB signaling pathway was participated in its action mechanism. These findings provide further evidence that PFOS interferes with the immune regulation of liver of male zebrafish under in vivo conditions.",Valuable method for production of oral vaccine by using alginate and chitosan against Lactococcus garvieae/Streptococcus iniae in rainbow trout (Oncorhynchus mykiss).,https://www.ncbi.nlm.nih.gov/pubmed/31082516,Fish & shellfish immunology,2019 05 28,"The effectiveness of ionotropic gelation method (by combining alginate and chitosan) vaccine against Lactococcus garvieae and Streptococcus iniae was examined in rainbow trout. Fish were separated into four groups and fed the distinctive examined feeds. Our groups were included: A) fish immunized by chitosan-alginate coated vaccine, B) fish immunized by non-coated vaccine, C) fish feed by chitosan-alginate coated pellets without vaccine and D) fish feed by basic diet (non-coated and without vaccine). In groups A and B, the vaccination was carried out for 14 days. Fish of group C, like groups A and B were fed 14 days with pellets covered with chitosan-alginate without vaccine and a short time later they were fed with control diet. On day 0, 20, 40 and 60 of the trial, serum samples were extracted. Fish were challenged with L. garvieae and S. iniae after 60 days of research. Innate immunity components containing complement activity, total protein and IgM appeared no significant changes nearly in all groups during the 60 days that the examination finished. Although, bactericidal activity and lysozyme activity demonstrated a significant increase on days 20, 40 and 60 in group A compared to control groups (C and D) (Pâ¯<â¯0.05) and similar results about the blood respiratory burst activity just on days 20 and 40 were obtained. Also, the relative expression of IL-6 of group A, was significantly higher compared to all of other groups (B, C and D) on days 20 and 60 of experiment (Pâ¯<â¯0.05). The same results were obtained about the relative expression of IgM. The serum ELISA antibody titer against L. garvieae, increased significantly on days 20 and 40 of experiment in fish immunized by chitosan-alginate coated vaccine (Group A) compared to control groups (C and D)(Pâ¯<â¯0.05) while the result of ELISA test against S. iniae was significantly higher on days 40 and 60 of experiment in group A compared to groups B, C and D (Pâ¯<â¯0.05). After challenge with these two live bacteria (S. iniae and L. garvieae), a survival rates of 76.67â¯Â±â¯5.77% (challenged with S. iniae) and 66.67â¯Â±â¯5.77% (challenged with L. garvieae) were seen in group immunized with chitosan-alginate coated vaccine (Group A), which were higher than survival rates gotten in other trial groups (Pâ¯<â¯0.05). The consequences of the present experiment show that the oral vaccination of rainbow trout with improved chitosan-alginate (via ionotropic procedure) (group A) properly secures this important fish against Lactococcus garvieae and Streptococcus iniae.",The demise of preimplantation genetic testing for aneuploidy (PGT-A) in Hungary and its effect on patient care.,https://www.ncbi.nlm.nih.gov/pubmed/31082515,European journal of medical genetics,2019 05 17,"Preimplantation genetic testing for aneuploidy (PGT-A) is a suitable technique to identify euploid embryos, which have the highest potential to implant, thus increase the chance of a healthy live birth. The main indications of PGT-A are advanced maternal age, repeated implantation failure, repeated miscarriages and severe male infertility. Several studies have already proven that testing embryos for genetic abnormalities in the above cases results in higher implantation rate and reduced number of pregnancy loss. In spite of these - due to a legislative change in Hungary in 2015 - PGT-A was reclassified as an experimental procedure and its use became banned throughout the country. For this reason, after 4 years of successful practice, Hungarian patients were not able to participate in IVF procedure combined with PGT-A anymore. In this retrospective analysis, efficacy of PGT-A-based embryo selection was evaluated and was compared to the conventional morphology-based selection (MBS) in patients with advanced maternal age, between 2013 and 2017â¯at our private fertility clinic. PGT-A was performed with array comparative genomic hybridization. We found that implantation rate was significantly higher (43.62% vs. 27.88%; pâ¯=â¯0.0208) and miscarriage rate was significantly lower (17.07% vs. 37.93%; pâ¯=â¯0.0492) in the PGT-A group compared to the MBS group from 2013 to 2015. These outcomes were achieved with a significantly lower number of transferred embryos in the PGT-A group (1.25 vs. 1.58; pâ¯=â¯0.0003). In 2016-2017, the number of transferred embryos were significantly reduced in the MBS group as well (1.14 vs. 1.58; pâ¯<â¯0.0001). However, outcomes of the IVF treatments did not change significantly compared to the previous two years (2013-2015). Our results imply that PGT-A-based embryo selection is more efficient than morphology-based selection in patients with advanced maternal age. Therefore, prohibition of the use of PGT-A had significant consequences on the efficiency and safety of IVF treatment in the country.",New Retroperitoneal Transvaginal Natural Orifice Transluminal Endoscopic Surgery Approach to Sentinel Node for Endometrial Cancer: A Demonstration Video.,https://www.ncbi.nlm.nih.gov/pubmed/31082514,Journal of minimally invasive gynecology,2019 06 11,To assess whether sentinel node resection for endometrial cancer is feasible via retroperitoneal transvaginal natural orifice transluminal endoscopic surgery (vNOTES) and gives better exposure than transperitoneal vNOTES.

In this study, we have accomplished the molecular cloning, bioinformatic analysis and preliminary function study of C. semilaevis GATA5. The full-length cDNA nucleotide sequence is 1955â¯bp, with a coding sequence of 1167â¯bp, which encodes a polypeptide of 388 amino acids. Homology, phylogenetic, gene structure and synteny analysis showed that C. semilaevis GATA5 was highly conserved among vertebrates. Tissue distribution pattern exhibited that C. semilaevis GATA5 was significantly expressed in heart, intestine, liver, kidney and gonad, with a sexual dimorphic feature observed in testis and ovary. Embryonic development expression profiles showed that C. semilaevis GATA5 transcripts increased at the blastula stage, and peaked at the heat-beating period. Strong signals were detected at spermatids of male testis and stage III oocytes of female ovary by ISH. The expression of C. semilaevis GATA5 was regulated by 17Î±-MT and E2 after hormone stimulation to the ovary. Together, all the results pointed out that GATA5 might play a vital role during gonadal maturation and the reproductive cycle of C. semilaevis.

Transcriptomic data analysis has shown pathways and immune system responses associated with SLE. Eight up-regulated genes (SOCE, MMP9, CXCL8, JUN, IL1B, NFKBIA, TNF and FOS) have been examined with four interactions among different pathways. These genes are associated with SNPs which have been identified through two datasets from SLE genome-wide association studies (GWAS). In this investigation, the GWAS results were integrated with pathway analysis of transcriptomes and several genes were detected with known SLE-related variations (TYK2, C5, SH2B, IRF5, IL2RA, STAT4, FCGR2A, IL7R, LYN, HLA-DRB and TNFAIP3). Pathway-based analysis on the Wikipathway Human Collection allowed the identification of prioritized variants in the relevant pathways, such as thymic stromal lymphopoietin (TSLP) signaling pathway linked to LYN, IL7R, STAT4 and rs7574865. Analysis of existing transcriptomes and GWAS data identified eight up-regulated candidate genes with more than four relationships among the different pathways associated with SNPs to pinpoint the relevant loci linked to SLE. The results of this investigation have expanded the number of candidate genes related to SLE and have highlighted possible pathways and GWAS-based methods for gene detection. Identification of the fundamental genes would assist in revealing the mechanisms responsible for SLE.","Characterization of long living yeast deletion mutants that lack mitochondrial metabolism genes DSS1, PPA2 and AFG3.",https://www.ncbi.nlm.nih.gov/pubmed/31082499,Gene,2019 05 28,"Molecular mechanisms of aging and longevity are still mostly unknown. Mitochondria play central roles in cellular metabolism and aging. In this study, we identified three deletion mutants of mitochondrial metabolism genes (ppa2â, dss1â, and afg3â) that live longer than wild-type cells. These long-lived cells harbored significantly decreased amount of mitochondrial DNA (mtDNA) and reactive oxygen species (ROS). Compared to the serpentine nature of wild-type mitochondria, a different dynamics and distribution pattern of mitochondria were observed in the mutants. Both young and old long-lived cells produced relatively low but adequate levels of ATP for cellular activities. The status of the retrograde signaling was checked by expression of CIT2 gene and found activated in long-lived mutants. The mutant cells were also profiled for their gene expression patterns, and genes that were differentially regulated were determined. All long-lived cells comprised similar pleiotropic phenotype regarding mitochondrial dynamics and functions. Thus, this study suggests that DSS1, PPA2, and AFG3 genes modulate the lifespan by altering the mitochondrial morphology and functions.",Older age at initiation of antiretroviral therapy predicts low bone mineral density in children with perinatally-infected HIV in Zimbabwe.,https://www.ncbi.nlm.nih.gov/pubmed/31082498,Bone,2019 06 01,Perinatally-acquired HIV infection commonly causes stunting in children; how this affects bone and muscle development is unclear.

Various tasks have been developed to assess effort-based choice in rats, and experimenters have found largely similar results across tasks and brain regions. In this review, we focus primarily on the convergence of different effort-based choice tasks where quality or quantity of reward are manipulated. In the former, the rat is typically presented with the option to work for a preferred reward or select a less preferred, but freely-available reward. In such paradigms, the rewards are of different identities but are confirmed to differ qualitatively in value by a food preference task when both are freely-available. In the latter task type, rats are required to select between higher magnitude versus lower magnitudes of the same reward, but each with a similar effort requirement. We discuss the strengths/limitations of these paradigms, and describe brain regions that have been probed that result in converging or equivocal findings.

Results showed that flies injected with the bacterium Serratia marcescens decreased their macronutrient intake and shifted their diet choice to carbohydrate-biased diet compared to naÃ¯ve individuals. Interestingly, flies injected with either PBS (i.e., sham-infected) or heat-killed bacteria also reduced food intake and modulated diet choice but only for a day after injection. When infected flies were restricted to the diet they selected (i.e., PC 1:8), they survived better the infection than those restricted to a protein-biased diet (i.e., PC 1:5). In addition, we did not observe any growth of pathogen load in infected flies fed PC 1:8 for the first 3 days post-infection. Finally, a decrease in lipid body reserves was found in flies injected with live bacteria and, interestingly, this loss of body lipid also occurred in flies injected with heat-killed bacteria, but in a diet-dependent manner. Our results indicated that B. tryoni flies modulated their macronutrient intake and decreased the negative effects of the infection on their survival (""nutritional self-medication"") the first days following the infection.","Ononin, sec-O-Î²-d-glucosylhamaudol and astragaloside I: antiviral lead compounds identified via high throughput screening and biological validation from traditional Chinese medicine Zhongjing formulary.",https://www.ncbi.nlm.nih.gov/pubmed/31082475,Pharmacological research,2019 06 06,"Traditional medicine (TM) is a valuable source for drug discovery. The knowledge in healing traditions has led to the success of some of the best-known drugs. However, the concept of ancient medical knowledge, such as herbal remedies and their therapeutic experience is rarely used in the current methodologies for developing therapeutics from TM. As a result, the screening procedure of TM compounds remains tough and labor-intensive. This study aimed to develop a new strategy that is capable of efficiently identifying antiviral leads from complex traditional Chinese medicine (TCM) by integrating knowledge from ancient healing practices with luciferase-based high-throughput screening (HTS). 'Shanghan Zabing Lun', an ancient TCM treatise which contains over 200 formulae was selected for knowledge mining based on its antiviral activity. Thirty formulae were rationally selected and utilized for the preparation of a 1306-fraction herbal formulae extract library by standardized chromatographic fractionation. The antiviral activity of the library was screened on a HEK293T cell model carrying a luciferase-driven interferon stimulated response element (ISRE). Hit compounds were further identified using liquid chromatography mass spectrometry analysis, and the mechanism of action of which were preliminarily explored through western blotting and immunofluorescence. A total of 18 fractions and 3 compounds were found activating ISRE. The three compounds, namely ononin, sec-O-Î²-d-glucosylhamaudol and astragaloside I could activate p65 phosphorylation and nuclear translocation. By doing so, a new strategy termed Knowledge-Based High Throughput Screening (KB-HTS) has been established, which provides an alternative approach to unearth antiviral lead compounds from TM.

We evaluated 137 patients transplanted in 25 pediatric EBMT centers. Median age at transplant was 11.04 years (range, 5 to 18); 89 patients were boys and 48 girls. Eighty-nine patients were prepubertal at transplant and 48 postpubertal. One hundred eighteen children received Bu and 19 Treo.

However, the ill-posed nature of termination criteria in many tractography algorithms can cause streamlines apparently being associated with zero, one, or more than two grey matter (GM) nodes; streamlines that terminate in white matter or cerebrospinal fluid may even end up being assigned to nodes if the definitions of these nodes are not strictly constrained to genuine GM areas, resulting in a misleading connectome in non-trivial ways. Based on both in-house MRI data and state-of-the-art data provided by the Human Connectome Project, this study investigates the actual influence of streamline-to-node assignment methods, and their interactions with fibre-tracking terminations and brain parcellations, on the construction of pairwise regional connectivity and subsequent connectomic measures. Our results show that the frequency of generating successful pairwise connectivity is heavily affected by the convoluted interactions between the applied strategies for connectome construction, and that minor changes in the mechanism can cause significant variations in the within- and between-module connectivity strengths as well as in the commonly-used graph theory metrics. Our data suggest that these fundamental processes should not be overlooked in structural connectomics research, and that improved data quality is not in itself sufficient to solve the underlying problems associated with assigning streamlines to brain nodes. We demonstrate that the application of advanced fibre-tracking techniques that are designed to correct for inaccuracies of track terminations with respect to anatomical information at the fibre-tracking stage is advantageous to the subsequent connectome construction process, in which pairs of parcellation nodes can be more robustly identified from streamline terminations via a suitable assignment mechanism.",RIP3 participates in early brain injury after experimental subarachnoid hemorrhage in rats by inducing necroptosis.,https://www.ncbi.nlm.nih.gov/pubmed/31082470,Neurobiology of disease,2019 06 15,"Necroptosis is a regulated form of necrosis that is mediated by a variety of proteins including tumor necrosis factor-Î± (TNF-Î±) and receptor-interacting proteins (RIPs). TNF-Î±, a critical inflammatory molecule, is one of the initiating signals in the necroptosis pathway, and RIP3 acts as a switch that commits the cell to necroptosis. Subarachnoid hemorrhage (SAH) is a common type of hemorrhagic stroke with high mortality and disability rates. RIP3 has been studied in many central nervous system (CNS) diseases, but its role in SAH has not been investigated in depth. Here, we used an autologous-blood injection model to study the role of RIP3 in brain injury induced by SAH in rats. Several indexes such as brain edema, loss of blood-brain barrier (BBB) integrity, and behavioral tests of neurological function were used to evaluate brain damage in SAH-injured rats. We found that the expression of RIP3 was increased in the rat brain after SAH, reaching the highest point 24â¯h post-injury. We also showed that genetic or pharmacological inhibition of RIP3 or TNF-Î± reduced the brain damage induced by SAH, whereas overexpression of RIP3 aggravated brain injury and neurological damage. Additionally, we verified the presence of RIP3-mediated necroptosis in an in vitro SAH model of primary cultured neurons treated with conditioned medium from primary microglia activated by oxygen hemoglobin (OxyHb). Collectively, our findings indicated that RIP3 contributed to brain damage after SAH by inducing necroptosis.",Molecular and cellular bases of diabetes: Focus on type 2 diabetes mouse model-TallyHo.,https://www.ncbi.nlm.nih.gov/pubmed/31082469,Biochimica et biophysica acta. Molecular basis of disease,2019 05 20,"Diabetes is a chronic lifestyle disorder that affects millions of people worldwide. Diabetes is a condition where the body does not produce sufficient insulin or does not use it efficiently. Insulin resistance in diabetes or obesity causes the pancreatic Î²-cells to increase the insulin output. Diabetes occurs in multiple forms, including type 1, type 2, type 3 and gestational. Type 2 diabetes accounts for â¼90-95% of total affected population and is associated with both impaired insulin production by the Î²-cells of the pancreas and impaired insulin release in response to high blood glucose levels. Diabetes is tightly linked with genetic mutations and genetic and lifestyle activities, including diet and exercise. Recent epidemiological studies established a close link between the diabetes and progression to Alzheimer's disease. This article summarizes various molecular mechanisms involved in the developments of diabetes, including biochemical characteristics, genetic and molecular links with Alzheimer's disease, Î²-cell function, and factors associated with diabetes. This will help us in the development of novel therapeutic strategies targeting AD in future.",Diversity of Î²-cyclodextrin-based nanosponges for transformation of actives.,https://www.ncbi.nlm.nih.gov/pubmed/31082468,International journal of pharmaceutics,2019 06 02,"Î²-Cyclodextrin-based nanosponges (Î²-CDNSs) play an important role in new arrays of agriculture, floriculture, cosmetics, medicine, high molecular weight proteins, novel flame retardants, gas carriers and water filters. In recent years, the field of advance nanostructured systems witnesses a rapid development due to miniaturization, dose-reduction, sustained and controlled release of actives and long-term stability of material. Î²-CDNSs are colloidal and cross-linked nanocarrier comprising of solid mesh-like structure with nano-cavities for encapsulation of complex lipophilic and hydrophilic chemical substances. The release of enthalpy-rich water molecules from the polymeric structures accounts for high complexation efficiency with different molecular substrates. This review primarily focuses on the important characteristics of Î²-CDNS, methods of preparation, release kinetics of chemical entity, potential applications and commercial products. The advantages of Î²-CDNS involve sustained and controlled release of entrapped molecules with high efficiency and excellent stability. Thus, nanosponges are effective carrier for the delivery of actives and developed as a commercial drug delivery system in pharmaceutical industries after certified clinical studies. In the near future, Î²-CDNS-based product will capture the market due to its diverse applications in anti-cancer, antiviral, antiplatelet, antihypertensive therapy, etc.",Effects of hydroxychloroquine on the human placenta-Findings from in vitro experimental data and a systematic review.,https://www.ncbi.nlm.nih.gov/pubmed/31082466,"Reproductive toxicology (Elmsford, N.Y.)",2019 06 16,"Hydroxychloroquine (HCQ), a toll like receptor (TLR) 7 and 9 antagonist, is used during pregnancy for inflammatory conditions with limited understanding of its placental toxicology. We hypothesized that HCQ does not have toxic effects on the placenta and can modulate cytokine release in response to TLR7/9 activation. A systematic review was conducted and no studies of HCQ on multicellular human placental tissue were identified. Accordingly, placental villous explants were cultured for 7 days with HCQ +/- TLR7/9 agonists. HCQ did not affect cell turnover, nutrient transport or cytokine release but increased IL-10 (anti-inflammatory) secretion and promoted syncytiotrophoblast regeneration. Cytokine release stimulated by TLR7/9 agonists was unaffected by HCQ. In conclusion, HCQ did not adversely affect placental tissue and may have a protective anti-inflammatory function. Further research is needed to determine the mechanisms of HCQ actions on human placenta and whether they could be utilized to improve pregnancy outcomes."

It has been shown that hypothermia has neuroprotective effects on cerebral ischemia, but whether it is effective for cerebral ischemia in diabetic patients remains unknown. The aim of this study was to investigate whether hypothermia can alleviate cerebral ischemic injury in diabetic rats and the regulation of autophagy and pyroptosis of the treatment. We introduced permanent middle cerebral artery occlusion (pMCAO) in a model of type 2 diabetic rats prepared by high-fat diet combined with intraperitoneal injection of STZ in vivo and mimicked cerebral ischemia with diabetes by employing high glucose stimulation and oxygen-glucose deprivation/reoxygenation (OGD/R) in vitro. Moreover, 3-methyladenine and bafilomycin A1 were used to evaluate the association between autophagy and pyroptosis in vitro. Our results showed that diabetes aggravated neurological deficits, increased the volume of cerebral infarction and brain edema as well as the blood brain barrier permeability after cerebral ischemia, which were alleviated by mild hypothermia. Compared with the pMCAO model in non-diabetic rats and OGD/R model without high glucose stimulation in vitro, the expression of P62, NOD-like receptor protein 3 (NLRP3), cleaved caspase-1 and Gasdermin-N increased and the ratio of microtubule-associated protein 1 light chain 3B (LC3B) â¡/â  decreased in the pMCAO model in diabetic rats and OGD/R model with high glucose stimulation, which could be reversed by mild hypothermia. In conclusion, mild hypothermia alleviated diabetes aggravated cerebral ischemic injury via activating autophagy and inhibiting pyroptosis.",Pathogenicity of a GI-22 genotype infectious bronchitis virus isolated in China and protection against it afforded by GI-19 vaccine.,https://www.ncbi.nlm.nih.gov/pubmed/31082454,Virus research,2019 05 24,"Avian infectious bronchitis (IB) is a globally circulating bird disease caused by infectious bronchitis virus (IBV). In China, the most prevalent IBV genotype is GI-19/QX-like because the protective efficiency of the classical IBV vaccine is low, and new GI-19 vaccines are under development. In 2018, a GI-22 genotype strain CK/CH/LGD/2018 (abbreviated 'LGD') was isolated in northern China, which caused 10%-30% morality in H120-vaccinated chickens. A phylogenetic analysis showed that this new isolate displays novel features compared with other earlier-isolated reference strains. To monitor the epidemic trend of IBV in China, the pathogenicity of LGD was first evaluated in 1-day-old specific-pathogen-free chickens. LGD induced classical IBV damage in the trachea and kidney, whereas it also infected and damaged the bursa of Fabricius, an important immune organ of chickens. The efficacy of our earlier-developed GI-19 vaccine, strain SZ200, against LGD was also evaluated in this study. The GI-19 genotype vaccine provided sufficient protection against the new GI-22 genotype strain, and may be a promising candidate vaccine with which to control both wild GI-19 and GI-22 strains in the future.",Targeting mitochondria to protect axons in progressive MS.,https://www.ncbi.nlm.nih.gov/pubmed/31082453,Neuroscience letters,2019 06 09,"Inflammatory demyelinating processes target the neuron, particularly axons and synapses, in multiple sclerosis (MS). There is a gathering body of evidence indicating molecular changes which converge on mitochondria within neurons in progressive forms of MS. The most reproducible changes are the increase in mitochondrial content within demyelinated axons and mitochondrial respiratory chain complex deficiency in neurons, which compromises the capacity to generate ATP. The resulting lack of ATP and the likely energy failure state and its coupling with an increase in demand for energy by the demyelinated axon, are particularly relevant to the long tracts such as corticospinal tracts with long projection axons. Recent work in our laboratory and that of our collaborators indicate the limited reflection of the mitochondrial changes within neurons in the experimental disease models. Enhancing the energy producing capacity of neurons to meet the increased energy demand of demyelinated axons is likely to be a novel neuroprotective strategy in progressive MS.",Multiple tracking and machine learning reveal dopamine modulation for area-restricted foraging behaviors via velocity change in Caenorhabditis elegans.,https://www.ncbi.nlm.nih.gov/pubmed/31082452,Neuroscience letters,2019 06 15,"Food exploration is an essential survival behavior in organisms. To find food efficiently, many organisms use a foraging strategy called area-restricted search (ARS) wherein individuals first turn more frequently, restricting their search to one area, then turn less frequently, moving along a straight path to widen the search area. Previous research suggests that the nematode Caenorhabditis elegans shows ARS behavior by changing turn frequency, and that dopamine is a crucial determinant. However, the effects of dopamine on multiple behavioral parameters have remained unknown. Here, we evaluated turn (pirouette) frequency, moving velocity, and specific area occupancy (cell occupancy) over time by using a multiple-worms tracking system. In the control (mock) experiments, all parameters changed over time, but no changes were observed in experiments with dopamine pre-exposed and dopamine-deficient animals. In inverse reinforcement learning analysis, the value function for specific velocity was found to modulate over time in mock animals only. These results demonstrate that dopamine regulates ARS via changes not only to pirouette frequency change but also to velocity.","DNAJC13 p.Asn855Ser, implicated in familial parkinsonism, alters membrane dynamics of sorting nexin 1.",https://www.ncbi.nlm.nih.gov/pubmed/31082451,Neuroscience letters,2019 06 15,"DNAJC13 (RME-8) is a core co-chaperone that facilitates membrane recycling and cargo sorting of endocytosed proteins. DNAJ/Hsp40 (heat shock protein 40) proteins are highly conserved throughout evolution and mediate the folding of nascent proteins, and the unfolding, refolding or degradation of misfolded proteins while assisting in associated-membrane translocation. DNAJC13 is one of five DNAJ 'C' class chaperone variants implicated in monogenic parkinsonism. Here we examine the effect of the DNAJC13 disease-linked mutation (p.Asn855Ser) on its interacting partners, focusing on sorting nexin 1 (SNX1) membrane dynamics in primary cortical neurons derived from a novel Dnajc13 p.Asn855Ser knock-in (DKI) mouse model. Dnajc13 p.Asn855Ser mutant and wild type protein expression were equivalent in mature heterozygous cultures (DIV21). While SNX1-positive puncta density, area, and WASH-retromer assembly were comparable between cultures derived from DKI and wild type littermates, the formation of SNX1-enriched tubules in DKI neuronal cultures was significantly increased. Thus, Dnajc13 p.Asn855Ser disrupts SNX1 membrane-tubulation and trafficking, analogous to results from RME-8 depletion studies. The data suggest the mutation confers a dominant-negative gain-of-function in RME-8.

Little is known, however, about the psychological processes that translate features of such environments into socioeconomic differences in eating behaviour. One important feature of unhealthy food environments is the prevalence of oversized portions of unhealthy food. The present study tested whether individuals with lower socioeconomic status intend to consume more from large portions than those with higher socioeconomic status, and examined the psychological processes underlying this effect. A large-scale online experiment was conducted in which participants (Nâ¯=â¯511) indicated how much they would eat from small and large portions of healthy and unhealthy snacks. The mediating effects of trait impulsivity and perceptions of how much was considered appropriate to eat were also assessed. Participants with lower socioeconomic status intended to eat more from the large portions than from the small portions of the unhealthy snacks, which would equate to a potential 15-22% increase in energy intake. These effects were partially mediated by trait impulsivity and perceptions of how much is appropriate to eat. These findings point to a significant health burden of low socioeconomic status: when exposed to unhealthy food environments, specific psychological processes might increase the amount of unhealthy food those with lower socioeconomic intend to consume. This study critically informs the emerging understanding of the psychology of socioeconomic status and eating behaviour.",Routine HbA1c among hematology and oncology inpatients: Diabetes-status and hospital-outcomes.,https://www.ncbi.nlm.nih.gov/pubmed/31082446,Diabetes research and clinical practice,2019 06 16,Using routine HbA1c measurement to determine the prevalence of diabetes mellitus (known and previously unrecognized) and their hospital outcomes among hematology and oncology inpatients.

The importance of the research in this field was recognized by the general public after the Nobel Prize for Physiology or Medicine was awarded in 2016 to Yoshinori Ohsumi for discoveries of the mechanisms of autophagy using yeast as a model organism. One of the seminal findings of Ohsumi was on the role ubiquitin-like proteins (UBLs)-Atg5, Atg12, and Atg8-play in the formation of the double-membrane vesicle autophagosome, which is the functional unit of autophagy. Subsequent work by several groups demonstrated that, like the founding member of the UBL family ubiquitin, these small but versatile protein and lipid modifiers interact with a plethora of proteins, which either directly regulate autophagosome formation, for example, components of the Atg1/ULK1 complex, or are involved in cargo recognition, for example, Atg19 and p62/SQSTM1. By tethering the cargo to the UBLs present on the forming autophagosome, the latter proteins were proposed to effectively act as selective autophagy receptors. The discovery of the selective autophagy receptors brought a breakthrough in the autophagy field, supplying the mechanistic underpinning for the formation of an autophagosome selectively around the cytosolic cargo, that is, a protein aggregate, a mitochondrion, or a cytosolic bacterium. In this historical overview, I highlight key steps that the research into selective autophagy has been taking over the past 20â¯years. I comment on their significance and discuss current challenges in developing more detailed knowledge of the mechanisms of selective autophagy.

Thrombus formation impedes blood flow to brain and heart and is a principle cause of life-threatening diseases such as stroke and myocardial infarction. Aspirin has been widely used for the treatment and prevention of various cardiovascular diseases, but is unable to target a thrombus and scavenge a high level of H2O2. In this study, we report thrombus targeting aspirin polyconjugate particles (T-APP) as a near infrared imaging agent and on-demand therapeutic agent for thrombotic vascular diseases. T-APP were formulated from H2O2-activatable aspirin polyconjugate, fibrin-specific peptides and fluorescent IR780. In mouse models of tail bleeding and arterial thrombosis, T-APP targeted the thrombosed vessels rapidly with excellent specificity. T-APP also exerted highly strong antithrombotic activity in the thrombosed vessel by suppressing anti-inflammatory cytokines and inhibiting platelet activation. Based on the unique features such as specific thrombus targeting, H2O2 scavenging, and on-demand therapeutic actions, the rationally engineered T-APP have important ramifications on imaging and on-demand therapy of thrombotic disorders.",Cell-penetrating mechanism of intracellular targeting albumin: Contribution of macropinocytosis induction and endosomal escape.,https://www.ncbi.nlm.nih.gov/pubmed/31082432,Journal of controlled release : official journal of the Controlled Release Society,2019 06 15,"We recently developed a cell-penetrating drug carrier composed of albumin (HSA) combined with palmitoyl-cyclic-(D-Arg)12. While it is possible that the palmitoyl-cyclic-(D-Arg)12/HSA enters the cell mainly via macropinocytosis, the mechanism responsible for the induction of macropinocytosis and endosomal escape remain unknown. We report herein that palmitoyl-cyclic-(D-Arg)12/HSA might interact with heparan sulfate proteoglycan and the chemokine receptor CXCR4 followed by multiple activations of the PKC/PI3K/JNK/mTOR signaling pathways to induce macropinocytosis. This result was further confirmed by a co-treatment with 70â¯kDa dextran, a macropinocytosis marker. Using liposomes that mimic endosomes, the leakage of 5,6-carboxyfluorescein from liposome was observed in the presence of palmitoyl-cyclic-(D-Arg)12/HSA only in the case of the anionic late endosome-like liposomes but not the neutral early endosome-like liposomes. Heparin largely inhibited this leakage, suggesting the importance of electrostatic interactions between palmitoyl-cyclic-(D-Arg)12/HSA and the late-endosomal membrane. Immunofluorescence staining and Western blotting data indicated that the intact HSA could be transferred from endosomes to the cytosol. These collective data suggest that the palmitoyl-cyclic-(D-Arg)12/HSA is internalized via macropinocytosis and intact HSA is released from the late endosomes to the cytoplasm before the endosomes fuse with lysosomes. Palmitoyl-cyclic-(D-Arg)12/HSA not only functions as an intracellular drug delivery carrier but also as an inducer of macropinocytosis.",Non-receptor tyrosine kinase signaling in autoimmunity and therapeutic implications.,https://www.ncbi.nlm.nih.gov/pubmed/31082431,Pharmacology & therapeutics,2019 05 26,"Autoimmune diseases are characterized by impaired immune tolerance towards self-antigens, leading to enhanced immunity to self by dysfunctional B cells and/or T cells. The activation of these cells is controlled by non-receptor tyrosine kinases (NRTKs), which are critical mediators of antigen receptor and cytokine receptor signaling pathways. NRTKs transduce, amplify and sustain activating signals that contribute to autoimmunity, and are counter-regulated by protein tyrosine phosphatases (PTPs). The function of and interaction between NRTKs and PTPs during the development of autoimmunity could be key points of therapeutic interference against autoimmune diseases. In this review, we summarize the current state of knowledge of the functions of NRTKs and PTPs involved in B cell receptor (BCR), T cell receptor (TCR), and cytokine receptor signaling pathways that contribute to autoimmunity, and discuss their targeting for therapeutic approaches against autoimmune diseases.",Toxicology and human health risk assessment of polyethoxylated tallow amine surfactant used in glyphosate formulations.,https://www.ncbi.nlm.nih.gov/pubmed/31082430,Regulatory toxicology and pharmacology : RTP,2019 05 14,"RoundupÂ® branded herbicides contain glyphosate, a surfactant system and water. One of the surfactants used is polyethoxylated tallow amine (POE-T). A toxicology dataset has been developed to derive the most representative points of departure for human health risk assessments. Concentrated POE-T was very irritating to skin, corrosive to eyes, and sensitizing to skin. The irritation and sensitization potential of POE-T diminishes significantly upon dilution with water. Repeated dosing of rats with POE-T produced gastrointestinal effects but no systemic effect on organ systems. POE-T was not genotoxic and had no effect on embryo-fetal development or reproduction. The occupational risk assessment of POE- T for the agricultural use of glyphosate products has demonstrated that margins of exposure (MOEs) are 2517 and 100,000 for maximum and geometric mean dermal exposures, respectively. In the food risk assessment for relevant agricultural uses, the range of MOEs for consumption of foods from plant and animal origin were 330 to 2909. MOEs â¥100 are generally considered to be of no toxicological concern.

As families of small and long evolutionarily conserved ncRNAs, lncRNAs activate and repress genes via a variety of mechanisms at both transcriptional and translational levels, while miRNAs regulate protein-coding gene expression mainly through mRNA degradation or silencing, These ncRNAs have been proved to be involved in multiple biological functions, such as proliferation, differentiation, migration, angiogenesis and apoptosis. Today, while majority of studies have focused on defining the regulatory functions of lncRNAs and miRNAs, limited information have now available for the mutual regulations of lncRNAs, miRNAs and mRNA. Thus, the underlying molecular mechanisms, in particularly the interactions among lncRNAs, miRNAs and mRNA in development, growth, metastasis and therapeutic potential of cancer still remain obscure. Colorectal cancer (CRC) is known as the third most common and fourth leading cancer death worldwide. Increasing evidence showed the close correlations among aberrant expressions of lncRNAs, miRNAs and the occurrence, development of CRC. This review summarize the potential links among these RNAs in following three areas: 1, The biogenesis and roles of miRNAs in CRC; 2, The biogenesis and functions of lncRNAs in CRC; 3, The interactions among lncRNAs, miRNAs and mRNA in tumorigensis, growth, progression, EMT formation, chemoradiotherapy resistance, and therapeutic potential in CRC. We believe that identifying diverging lncRNAs, miRNAs and relevant genes, their interactions and complex molecular regulatory networks will provide important clues for understanding the mechanism and developing novel diagnostic and therapeutic strategies for CRC. Further efforts are warranted to bring the promise of regulating their activities into clinical utilities.","Long non-coding RNA H19, a negative regulator of microRNA-148b-3p, participates in hypoxia stress in human hepatic sinusoidal endothelial cells via NOX4 and eNOS/NO signaling.",https://www.ncbi.nlm.nih.gov/pubmed/31082428,Biochimie,2019 05 14,"This study aimed at the participation of lncRNA H19, endothelial NADPH oxidases (NOX4) and miR-148b-3p in hypoxia stress in human hepatic sinusoidal endothelial cells (HHSEC), and clarifying the relationship among them. The expression of lnc H19, NOX4 and miR-148b-3p in cirrhotic patients and hypoxic HHSEC were measured by RT-PCR. The nitric oxide and hydrogen peroxide content in HHSEC were determined using ultraviolet chromatometry. The protein levels of NOX4, endothelial NOS (eNOS) and phosphorylated eNOS (p-eNOS) were measured via western blotting. The interaction between NOX4 promoter and lnc H19/miR-148b-3p was measured by dual-luciferase reporter gene detection system. The present results indicated that the expressions of NOX4 mRNA and lnc H19 were increased but miR-148b-3p was decreased in both cirrhotic patients and hypoxic HHSEC. Further, hypoxia induced the up-regulation of hydrogen peroxide and the down-regulation of eNOS/NO signaling in HHSEC. And these symptoms were ameliorated by lnc H19 shRNA and miR-148b-3p mimics. But the beneficial effects of lnc H19 shRNA and miR-148b-3p mimics were further abolished by miR-148b-3p inhibitor and NOX4 over-expression, respectively. In addition, NOX4 was a direct, negatively regulated target of miR-148b-3p, and miR-148b-3p was negatively regulated by lnc H19. Collectively, lnc H19 is a negatively regulator of microRNA-148b-3p, and participate in hypoxia stress in HHSEC via positively regulating NOX4 and negatively regulating eNOS/NO signaling.",Gadolinium-based contrast agents: Stimulators of myeloid-induced renal fibrosis and major metabolic disruptors.,https://www.ncbi.nlm.nih.gov/pubmed/31082427,Toxicology and applied pharmacology,2019 06 10,"Evidence for gadolinium-based contrast agent- (GBCA-) induced disease continues to mount. Risk factors for gadolinium-induced systemic fibrosis are entirely unexplored. Obesity-related renal injury is characterized by activation of glomerular mesangial cells and podocyte damage with alteration of lipid metabolism/lipid accumulation in both cell types resulting in matrix accumulation and eventual progression to glomerulosclerosis. We examined the consequences of GBCA treatment in the kidneys from mice with normal kidney function and the potential interplay between obesity and gadolinium exposure. We found that administration of GBCA (4â¯weeks) causes significant renal fibrosis and podocyte injury that are associated with metabolic disorders as evidenced by dyslipidemia. Metabolomic analysis demonstrated that renal lipid metabolism and metabolic markers of collagen turnover are significantly altered by gadolinium. GBCA stimulates myeloid-derived fibrocytes to the kidney. Obesity was induced by feeding a group of mice a high fat diet (HFD) for 22â¯weeks. Groups were sub-randomized to GBCA treatment versus none for 4â¯weeks before sacrifice. HFD-induced fibrosis and podocyte injury were worsened by GBCA. Similarly, HFD-mediated hyperlipidemia and lipid metabolites were exacerbated by gadolinium. This is the first evidence that GBCA causes significant metabolic disorders and kidney injury in mice without renal insufficiency and that the injurious actions of GBCA are amplified by obesity. The understanding of the functional interplay between gadolinium and obesity will allow the development of therapeutic interventions or the establishment of effective preventive measures to reduce gadolinium- and obesity-mediated renal pathologies.",Profiling of differentially expressed genes in cadmium-induced prostate carcinogenesis.,https://www.ncbi.nlm.nih.gov/pubmed/31082426,Toxicology and applied pharmacology,2019 06 10,"The aim of the present study was to investigate the genetic signatures of cadmium-transformed prostate epithelial (CTPE) cells and to identify the potential molecular signaling involved in their malignant transformation. The dataset contained normal prostate epithelial (RWPE-1) and CTPE cells. To further examine the biological functions of the identified differentially expressed genes (DEGs), Gene Ontology (GO), Kyoto Encyclopedia of Genes and Genomes (KEGG), and Reactome pathway enrichment analyses were performed. In total, 2357 DEGs were identified, including 1083 upregulated genes and 1274 downregulated genes. GO, KEGG, and Reactome pathway enrichment analyses indicated that upregulated genes were significantly enriched in ECM-receptor, focal adhesion, TGFÎ² signaling, and syndecan interactions, while downregulated genes were mainly involved in cell cycle regulation, arachidonic acid metabolism, oxidative phosphorylation, and folate biosynthesis (pâ¯<â¯.05). The top upregulated (SATB1 (pâ¯<â¯.0001), EYA2 (pâ¯<â¯.0001) and KPNA7 (pâ¯<â¯.0027)) and downregulated (PITX2 (pâ¯<â¯.0007), PDLIM4 (pâ¯<â¯.0020) and FABP5 (pâ¯<â¯.0007)) genes were further validated via qRT-PCR analysis. In conclusion, the present study profiled DEGs in RWPE-1 and CTPE cells and identified gene pathways that may be associated with malignant transformation and tumor progression.","Biosynthesis of Î²-d-glucanâgold nanoparticles, cytotoxicity and oxidative stress in mouse splenocytes.",https://www.ncbi.nlm.nih.gov/pubmed/31082425,International journal of biological macromolecules,2019 06 15,"This study reports biosynthesis of gold-nanoparticles (AuNPs) by using Î²-d-glucans isolated from the yeast Yarrowia lypolitica D1. Î²-d-glucans serve as reducing and stabilizing mediators that induce the formation of AuNPs on the outer surface of the own Î²-d-glucan. The systems were physicochemically characterized by ultraviolet visible (UV-Vis) spectroscopy, high-resolution transmission electron microscopy (HR-TEM), scanning electron microscope (SEM), energy-dispersive X-ray spectroscopy (EDS), and dynamic light scattering (DLS) analyses. The results revealed the generation of AuNPs with quasi-spherical shape or large one dimension (1D) gold-nanostructures (AuNSs) depending on the HAuCl4 concentration. A cytotoxic study was assessed in mouse splenocytes. Contrary to that expected, important cytotoxicity was found in all Î²-d-gluc+AuNPs systems by an oxidative stress increase. This study discusses the cytotoxic mechanism, suggesting that the resulting Î²-d-gluc+AuNPs systems may not be candidates for the formulation of immunostimulants or nanocarriers for biomedical applications."

This fact lowers the interests for such substrates. To enhance LCB-degradation, cattle rumen fluid, a highly active microbial resource accruing in the growing meat industry, might be used as a potential source for bioaugmentation. This study compares 0%, 20% and 40% rumen liquid in a batch anaerobic digestion approach. Moreover, it determines the biogas- and methane-potentials as well as degradation-speeds of corn straw, co-digested with cattle manure. It inspects microbial communities via marker-gene sequencing, qPCR and RNA-DGGE and draws attention on possible beneficial effects of rumen addition on the biogas-producing community. Bioaugmentation with 20% and 40% v/v rumen liquid accelerated methane yields by 5 and 6 days, respectively (i.e. reaching 90% of total methane production). It also enhanced LCB- as well as (hemi)cellulose- and volatile fatty acid degradation. These results are supported by increased abundances of bacteria, methanogens and anaerobic fungi in treatments with rumen liquid amendment, and point towards the persistence of specific rumen-borne microorganisms especially during the first phase of the experiment. The results suggest that rumen liquid addition is a promising strategy for enhanced and accelerated exploitation of LCB for biomethanisation.","Steroidal thiazolidinone derivatives: Design, synthesis and their molecular interaction with human serum albumin.",https://www.ncbi.nlm.nih.gov/pubmed/31082411,Steroids,2019 05 28,"A series of steroidal thiazolidinone derivatives have been synthesized through one-pot multicomponent reaction involving steroidal ketone, thiosemicarbazide/methyl-thiosemicarbazide and DMAD in presence of AlCl3 as a Lewis acid catalyst. Among all the synthesized steroidal thiazolidinone derivatives, compound 7-9 (ST 7-9) were investigated for their in vitro molecular interaction with human serum albumin. Intrinsic fluorescence spectroscopy, constant wavelength synchronous fluorescence spectroscopy, circular dichroism and UV-visible absorption techniques have been exploited to characterize the binding phenomena in phosphate buffer solution at pH 7.4. The experimental results indicated that ST 7-9 bind to HSA and the intrinsic fluorescence of HSA was quenched through static quenching mechanism. The binding parameters were calculated and the binding constants obtained were 1.44â¯Ãâ¯105â¯M-1 for ST 7, 0.84â¯Ãâ¯105â¯M-1 for ST 8 and 1.06â¯Ãâ¯105â¯M-1 for ST 9. Circular dichroism analysis confirms that the presence of ST 7-9, altered the secondary structure of HSA due to partial unfolding of the polypeptide chain. Furthermore, hemolytic activity assay demonstrated that the synthesized steroidal thiazolidinone derivatives have good compatibility towards human red blood cells. Finally, molecular docking studies revealed that the steroidal thiazolidinones can bind in the hydrophobic cavity of HSA, by hydrophobic and hydrogen bonding interaction. These results provided valuable information about the binding mechanism of ST 7-9 with HSA and play a pivotal role in the development of steroidal heterocycle inspired compounds.",Exenatide alleviates mitochondrial dysfunction and cognitive impairment in the 5ÃFAD mouse model of Alzheimer's disease.,https://www.ncbi.nlm.nih.gov/pubmed/31082410,Behavioural brain research,2019 06 09,"The role of mitochondrial dysfunction has been well-documented in Alzheimer's disease (AD). Glucagon-like peptide 1 (GLP-1) receptor agonists are being utilized as neuroprotectants in the treatment of various neurological disorders, including AD. We conducted this study to explore the effects of exenatide (a GLP-1 receptor agonist) on Î²-amyloid plaque (AÎ²)-induced cognitive impairment and mitochondrial dysfunction in 5xFAD transgenic mice. Spatial memory test showed that exenatide administration (100 Î¼g/kg twice per day) prevented cognitive decline after 16 weeks of treatment. AÎ²1-42 deposition and synapse damage in the hippocampus was signiï¬cantly alleviated. Furthermore, exenatide treatment can improve mitochondrial morphology, relieve oxidative damage, correct mitochondrial energy crisis, and normalize mitochondrial dynamics. These ï¬ndings suggest that exenatide, which has already been applied in clinical medicine, may be a promising agent for AD therapy via mitochondrial protection.",Differential activity pattern of c-Fos in the nucleus accumbens between adult and aged rats during flavor recognition memory.,https://www.ncbi.nlm.nih.gov/pubmed/31082409,Behavioural brain research,2019 06 10,"Previous studies have addressed the role of the nucleus accumbens core (NAcbC) and shell (NAcbSh) in taste aversion learning and in the processing of taste palatability which is affected by aging. However, little is known about its implication in safe taste memory and the aging impact. To explore the role of the NAcb in flavor neophobia and its attenuation during aging, we applied c-Fos immunohistochemistry as an index of neural activity of the NAcbC and NAcbSh. Twenty one adult (5-month-old) and 24 aged (24-month-old) male Wistar rats were exposed to a 3% cider vinegar solution for 1, 2 or 6 consecutive days (nâ=â7 adult and nâ=â8 aged rats per group). Aged rats exhibited slower attenuation of flavor neophobia than adult rats. Adult rats showed increased NAcbSh c-Fos activity on day 2 compared to days 1 and 6, while this increase was delayed to day 6 in aged rats. There were no differences in the number of NAcbC c-Fos positive cells. This suggests that changes in the activity of neural circuits of palatability processing during normal aging could contribute to the slower attenuation of flavor neophobia in aged rats.",A novel Tungsten-based fiducial marker for multi-modal brain imaging.,https://www.ncbi.nlm.nih.gov/pubmed/31082408,Journal of neuroscience methods,2019 06 08,"Multi-modal brain image registration is a prerequisite for accurate mapping of brain structure and function in neuroscience.

To address this question, we conducted a meta-analysis of brain regions associated with basic symbolic number processing, arithmetic, and mental rotation. We used Activation Likelihood Estimation (ALE) to construct quantitative meta-analytic maps synthesizing results from 83 neuroimaging papers (24-31 studies/cognitive process). All three cognitive processes were found to activate bilateral parietal regions in and around the intraparietal sulcus (IPS); a finding consistent with shared processing accounts. Numerical and arithmetic processing were associated with overlap in the left IPS, whereas mental rotation and arithmetic both showed activity in the middle frontal gyri. These patterns suggest regions of cortex potentially more specialized for symbolic number representation and domain-general mental manipulation, respectively. Additionally, arithmetic was associated with unique activity throughout the fronto-parietal network and mental rotation was associated with unique activity in the right superior parietal lobe. Overall, these results provide new insights into the intersection of numerical and spatial thought in the human brain.",The processing of compound radial frequency patterns.,https://www.ncbi.nlm.nih.gov/pubmed/31082405,Vision research,2019 05 14,"Radial frequency (RF) patterns can be combined to construct complex shapes. Previous studies have suggested that such complex shapes may be encoded by multiple, narrowly-tuned RF shape channels. To test this hypothesis, thresholds were measured for detection and discrimination of various combinations of two RF components. Results show evidence of summation: sensitivity for the compounds was better than that for the components, with little effect of the components' relative phase. If both RF components are processed separately at the point of detection, they would combine by probability summation (PS), resulting in only a small increase in sensitivity for the compound compared to the components. Summation exceeding the prediction of PS suggests a form of additive summation (AS) by a common mechanism. Data were compared to predictions of winner-take-all, where only the strongest component contributes to detection, a single channel AS model, and multi-channel PS and AS models. The multi-channel PS and AS models were modelled under both Fixed and Matched Attention Window scenarios, the former assuming a single internal noise source for both components and compounds, the latter different internal noise sources for components and compounds. We were able to reject the winner-take-all and single channel models. The best performing model was an AS model with a Fixed Attention Window, consistent with detection being mediated by channels that are efficiently combined and limited by a single source of noise for both components and compounds.",Inter-individual variability and consistency of saccade adaptation in oblique saccades: Amplitude increase and decrease in the horizontal or vertical saccade component.,https://www.ncbi.nlm.nih.gov/pubmed/31082404,Vision research,2019 06 07,"Despite changes in the physical structures controlling the eyes, saccades, the rapid eye movements used to explore the visual environment, remain accurate throughout the lifetime. The process underlying this sensorimotor adaptation is studied using a double step paradigm: an intra-saccadic target displacement introduces a systematic position error which triggers changes in saccadic amplitude or direction across trials. Numerous researches on this saccade adaptation have been conducted, but the level of inter-individual variability and consistency in saccade gain change and how it relates to increase- or decrease-amplitude paradigms is not fully described. We conducted experiments in four groups of 25 participants with 800 trials per participant, including 200 baseline trials and 200 recovery trials. We used four distinct double-step paradigms that differed by the intra-saccadic target-step leading to either a horizontal (Backward or Forward) or vertical (Upward or Downward) gain modulation. Across experiments 95% of the participants exhibited adaptation, revealing the consistency of this phenomenon. We observed strong inter-individual differences, both in the extent and rate of adaptation, which were not correlated with the individual baseline saccades characteristics. As previously reported, the rates of adaptation were higher for gain decrease than for gain increase experiments but the final extent of adaptation were similar. Our results also support the view that adaptation of oblique saccades occurs where the saccade command is represented as a vector. Finally, at the individual level, we did not observe systematic changes in the saccade metrics in relation to adaptation.",Higher-Order Structure Characterization of Pharmaceutical Proteins by 2D Nuclear Magnetic Resonance Methyl Fingerprinting.,https://www.ncbi.nlm.nih.gov/pubmed/31082403,Journal of pharmaceutical sciences,2019 06 10,"A key challenge in the analytical assessment of therapeutic proteins is the comprehensive characterization of their higher-order structure (HOS). To directly assess HOS, a new type of assay is warranted. The most sensitive and detailed method for characterizing HOS is unquestionably nuclear magnetic resonance (NMR) spectroscopy. NMR spectroscopy provides direct information about the HOS at an atomic level, and with modern NMR spectrometers and improved pulse sequences, this has become feasible even on unlabeled proteins. Hence, NMR spectroscopy could be a very powerful tool for control of HOS following, for example, process changes resulting in structural changes, oxidation, degradation, or chemical modifications. We present a method for characterizing the HOS of therapeutic proteins by monitoring their methyl groups using 2D H, C-correlated NMR. We use a statistical model that compares the NMR spectrum of a given sample to a reference and results in one output value describing how similar the HOS of the samples are. This makes the overall result easy to interpret even for non-NMR experts. We show that the method is applicable to proteins of varying size and complexity (here up to â¼30 kDa) and that it is sufficiently sensitive for the detection of small changes in both primary and HOS.",Development of Octreotide-Loaded Chitosan and Heparin Nanoparticles: Evaluation of Surface Modification Effect on Physicochemical Properties and Macrophage Uptake.,https://www.ncbi.nlm.nih.gov/pubmed/31082402,Journal of pharmaceutical sciences,2019 06 08,"Octreotide (OCT) is a therapeutic peptide which is administered for the treatment of acromegaly.

The OCT-loaded NPs and PEG-NPs were prepared by ionic complexion of chitosan (Cs) with either heparin (Hp) or PEGylated heparin (PEG-Hp). The chemical structure of PEG-Hp was confirmed by IR and proton nuclear magnetic resonance. Morphological analyses by scanning electron microscopy showed that NPs and PEG-NPs have a uniform shape. Dynamic laser scattering measurements indicated that hydrodynamic diameter of NPs and PEG-NPs were 222.5 Â± 10.0 nm and 334.9 Â± 6.7 nm, respectively. NPs and PEG-NPs had a positive zeta potential of about 32.5 Â± 1.1 mv and 20.6 Â± 2.4 mv, respectively. Entrapment efficiency was 61.4 Â± 1.0% and 55.7 Â± 2.4% for NPs and PEG-NPs, respectively. Compared with the NPs, the PEG-NPs exhibited a slower release profile. Subsequently, fluorescein isothiocyanate-labeled chitosanCs was synthesized and used to evaluate the stealth characteristic of PEG-NPs.

However, the role of mitochondria in stabilizing motor nerve terminals at neuromuscular junction (NMJ) remains unclear. We previously demonstrated that mice lacking the antioxidant enzyme, superoxide dismutase-1 (Sod1-/-), develop progressive NMJ denervation. This was rescued by expression of SOD1 exclusively in the mitochondrial intermembrane space (MitoSOD1/Sod1-/-), suggesting that oxidative stress within mitochondria drives denervation in these animals. However, we also observed reduced mitochondrial density in Sod1-/- motor axons in vitro. To investigate the relationship between mitochondrial density and NMJ innervation in vivo, we crossed Sod1-/- mice with the fluorescent reporter strains Thy1-YFP and Thy1-mitoCFP. We identified an age-dependent loss of mitochondria at motor nerve terminals in Sod1-/- mice, that closely correlated with NMJ denervation, and was rescued by MitoSOD1 expression. To test whether augmenting mitochondrial transport rescues Sod1-/- axons, we generated transgenic mice overexpressing the mitochondrial cargo adaptor, Miro1. This led to a partial rescue of mitochondrial density at motor nerve terminals by 12â¯months of age, but was insufficient to prevent denervation. These findings suggest that loss of mitochondria in the distal motor axon may contribute to denervation in Sod1-/- mice, perhaps via loss of key mitochondrial functions such as calcium buffering and/or energy production.",Hypoactivity of the lateral habenula contributes to negative symptoms and cognitive dysfunction of schizophrenia in rats.,https://www.ncbi.nlm.nih.gov/pubmed/31082390,Experimental neurology,2019 06 15,"Dopaminergic (DAergic) hypofunction in the medial prefrontal cortex (mPFC) has been implicated in the negative and cognitive symptoms of schizophrenia and is regulated by serotonergic (5-HTergic) neurons in the dorsal raphe nucleus (DRN). The lateral habenula (LHb) is a key element in controlling DRN 5-HT neurons. We investigated how the LHb impacts the activity of mPFC neurons and whether it mediates the involvement of DRN on development of symptoms in a pharmacological animal model of schizophrenia. We used immunohisochemistry to assess cytochrome-c oxidase (COX) activity of the LHb in MK-801 model rats and extracellular firing recording to compare firing rates in LHb neurons of acute MK-801-treated rats. The sucrose preference, social interaction, and radial arm maze tests were used to access schizophrenia-like behavior in rats with electrolytically lesioned LHb. Finally, we examined levels of the dopamine D1 receptor (D1R) and tyrosine hydroxylase (TH) in the mPFC, and tryptophan hydroxylase 2 (TPH2) in the DRN of rats with LHb lesions to determine the possible mechanism underlying the schizophrenia-like behavior associated with lesioned LHb. We found that COX levels and LHb neuron firing rates decreased significantly in MK-801-treated animals. The LHb lesions induced negative and cognitive, but not positive symptoms of schizophrenia. The D1R and TH levels decreased in the mPFC while TPH2 expression elevated in the DRN and mPFC of LHb-lesioned rats. These results suggest that LHb hypoactivity may contribute to the negative and cognitive symptoms of schizophrenia by downregulating D1R expression in the mPFC, which might be mediated by DRN 5-HT neurons.",Time to reconsider extended erythropoietin treatment for infantile traumatic brain injury?,https://www.ncbi.nlm.nih.gov/pubmed/31082389,Experimental neurology,2019 06 15,"Pediatric traumatic brain injury (TBI) remains a leading cause of childhood morbidity and mortality worldwide. Most efforts to reduce the chronic impact of pediatric TBI involve prevention and minimization of secondary injury. Currently, no treatments are used in routine clinical care during the acute and subacute phases to actively repair injury to the developing brain. The endogenous pluripotent cytokine erythropoietin (EPO) holds promise as an emerging neuroreparative agent in perinatal brain injury (PBI). EPO signaling in the central nervous system (CNS) is essential for multiple stages of neurodevelopment, including the genesis, survival and differentiation of multiple lineages of neural cells. Postnatally, EPO signaling decreases markedly as the CNS matures. Importantly, high-dose, extended EPO regimens have shown efficacy in preclinical controlled cortical impact (CCI) models of infant TBI at two different, early ages by independent research groups. Specifically, extended high-dose EPO treatment after infantile CCI prevents long-term cognitive deficits in adult rats. Because of the striking differences in the molecular and cellular responses to both injury and recovery in the developing and mature CNS, and the excellent safety profile of EPO in infants and children, extended courses of EPO are currently in Phase III trials for neonates with PBI. Extended, high-dose EPO may also warrant testing for infants and young children with TBI.",Sequential treatment failures in response to BRAF/MEK and immune checkpoint inhibitors mediated by MAP2K2 and B2M mutations in melanoma.,https://www.ncbi.nlm.nih.gov/pubmed/31082388,Experimental and molecular pathology,2019 05 14,"Although the treatment of metastatic melanoma has been significantly improved by both anti-BRAF/MEK and checkpoint immunotherapies, resistance to these treatment modalities remains a substantial clinical problem.

ILC2-mediated production of type 2 cytokines initiates and amplifies airway inflammation via activation of eosinophils, B cells, mast cells, macrophages, fibroblasts, and epithelial cells in these diseases. ILC2s require at least three major signals to fully activate and robustly produce type 2 cytokines. IL-1 family cytokines (IL-1Î², IL-18, IL-33), IL-25, and TNF superfamilies (TNF, TL1A, GITR-L, RANK-L) activate the NF-ÎºB and AP-1 pathways that initiate production of IL-5 and IL-13. Lipid mediators (LTC4, LTD4, PGD2) and neuropeptide NMU promote production of IL-4 through the NFAT pathway. IL-2 and IL-7 family cytokines (IL-2, IL-7, IL-9, TSLP) activate the STAT5 pathway that induces survival of ILC2s and enhances cytokine production. The activation of STAT5 is necessary to potently induce cytokine- and lipid mediator-mediated production of type 2 cytokines. Inhibitory pathways for ILC2s have also become clearer. Type I and II interferons and IL-27 inhibit ILC2 functions through the activation of STAT1. Suppression mediated via Î²2-adrenergic receptor agonists, PGE2, and PGI2 occurs through cAMP and PKA. Glucocorticoid, testosterone, IL-10, and TGF-Î² are also able to inhibit ILC2-mediated production of type 2 cytokines.

Additionally, toxicity parameters were evaluated at sublethal doses in terms of the influence of the extract on the fertility and fecundity of snails, as well as morphological alterations and quantification of their immunological cells. A test with Artemia salina was also carried out, in order to verify the environmental toxicity of the compound. The ether extract of R. aspera, in which divaricatic acid was identified as the major compound, demonstrated molluscicidal activity at low concentrations against both embryos (LC90 of 22.78, 24.23, 16.63 and 16.03âÎ¼gâmL-1 for the gastrula, blastula, trochophore and veliger, respectively) and against adult snails (LC90 of 8.66âÎ¼gâmL-1), after 24âh of exposure. At the sublethal doses, it was possible to observe a decrease in fertility and quantitative and morphological changes in the defense cells of the exposed snails. In addition, the extract of R. aspera showed a cercaricidal effect on S. mansoni from the concentration of 5.0âÎ¼gâmL-1, while showing low toxicity to Artemia salina. The ether extract of R. aspera demonstrated effective molluscicidal activity on embryos and adult snails of the species B. glabrata, cercariae of S. mansoni, and presenting low toxicity on Artemia salina. In this way, it could be considered a promising compound in the development of future molluscicidal and cercaricidal agents, thus helping to combat schistosomiasis..",Ectoparasites of endemic and domestic animals in southwest Madagascar.,https://www.ncbi.nlm.nih.gov/pubmed/31082365,Acta tropica,2019 06 15,"Human encroachment of natural habitats bears the threat of disease transmission between native and introduced species that had not come into contact before, thus promoting the spread of new diseases in both directions. This is a matter of concern especially in areas where human-wildlife contact has not been intense in the recent past. In southwest Madagascar, we collected ectoparasites from various mammalian hosts and chicken, and examined their host preferences and their prevalence in relation to season and habitat degradation. Field-work took place in the northern portion of Tsimanampetsotsa National Park and the adjacent coastal strip (littoral) in the dry and in the rainy season of 2016/2017. Endemic mammals were trapped with live traps placed in habitats of different degrees of degradation: 1) relatively pristine forest, 2) degraded forest, 3) cultivated and shrub land. Rats and mice were also trapped in 4) villages. We identified 17 species of ectoparasites (296 individuals of ticks [5 species], 535 lice [7 spp.], 389 fleas [4 spp.] and 13 mites [1 sp.]) collected from 15 host species. There was no indication for seasonal or habitat effects on parasite infection. A large portion of the parasites was host-specific. Some ectoparasite species were shared either by several endemic or by several introduced species, but apart from the introduced flea species Echidnophaga gallinacea (collected from six different hosts including the endemic carnivore Galidictis grandidieri) no other ectoparasite species was shared between endemic and introduced host species.",The efficacy of an alternative mebendazole formulation in mice infected with Echinococcus multilocularis.,https://www.ncbi.nlm.nih.gov/pubmed/31082364,Acta tropica,2019 06 15,"This study was conducted to investigate the efficacy of a new formulation of MBZ oily suspension (MBZ-OS) in experimentally Echinococcus multilocularis-infected mice. MBZ-OS was prepared and administered to mice infected with E. multilocularis at 12.5 and 25âmg/kg for 14 consecutive days. Then, the cysts were collected, weighed and histologically examined. The results showed that the reduction rate of cyst weight induced by MBZ-OS at two doses was 95.23% and 92.67%, which was significantly higher than that of MBZ-1% tragacanth (positive control) at corresponding concentrations (87.41% and 69.47%), indicating that the treatment of alveolar echinococcosis at lower doses could be achieved by the use of MBZ-OS. This finding shows that MBZ-OS is also a promising formulation for alveolar echinococcosis as well as cystic echinococcosis and deserves to be investigated in clinical applications against echinococcosis.",The role of complement membrane attack complex in dry and wet AMD - From hypothesis to clinical trials.,https://www.ncbi.nlm.nih.gov/pubmed/31082363,Experimental eye research,2019 06 14,"Data from human dry and wet age-related macular degeneration (AMD) eyes support the hypothesis that constant 'tickover' of the alternative complement pathway results in chronic deposition of the complement membrane attack complex (MAC) on the choriocapillaris and the retinal pigment epithelium (RPE). Sub-lytic levels of MAC lead to cell signaling associated with tissue remodeling and the production of cytokines and inflammatory molecules. Lytic levels of MAC lead to cell death. CD59 is a naturally occurring inhibitor of the assembly of MAC. CD59 may thus be therapeutically efficacious against the pathophysiology of dry and wet AMD. The first gene therapy clinical trial for geographic atrophy - the advanced form of dry AMD has recently completed recruitment. This trial is studying the safety and tolerability of expressing CD59 from an adeno-associated virus (AAV) vector injected once into the vitreous. A second clinical trial assessing the efficacy of CD59 in wet AMD patients is also under way. Herein, the evidence for the role of MAC in the pathophysiology of dry as well as wet AMD and the scientific rationale underlying the use of AAV- delivered CD59 for the treatment of dry and wet AMD is discussed.",Systematic review and meta-analysis of catheter ablation of ventricular tachycardia in ischemic heart disease.,https://www.ncbi.nlm.nih.gov/pubmed/31082362,Heart rhythm,2019 05 14,Patients with ischemic heart disease (IHD) are at risk for ventricular tachycardia (VT).

They are not usually found free in human circulation. Alteration in fatty acids metabolism is linked to diseases such as diabetes, preeclampsia, heart disease, and some infectious diseases. Increased levels of non-esterified fatty acids (NEFA) may cause cell dysfunction and lipotoxicity. Since physiologically fatty acids are transported bound to albumin, we propose here a simple and cheap test that consists of albumin isoelectric focusing determination to measure the potential systemic NEFA cytotoxicity. For validation of this method, albumin isoelectric focusing in 51 serum samples from 40 critically ill patients and 11 controls was compared with NEFA/albumin ratios measured by HPLC. We called this approach an albumin saturation test. This test may indicate to physicians the potential NEFA lipotoxicity guiding them throughout better patient management. The albumin saturation test can point out serum albumin-NEFA saturation through a cheap assay that could be performed by any care facility.",Preliminary results of debranch-first technique in Frozen Elephant Trunk procedures.,https://www.ncbi.nlm.nih.gov/pubmed/31082360,The Annals of thoracic surgery,2019 05 14,To evaluate the outcomes of Frozen Elephant Trunk (FET) procedures performed with a customized graft which allows debranch-first technique with continuous antegrade cerebral perfusion and early distal aortic and myocardial reperfusion.,Association of Overnight Extubation with Outcomes after Cardiac Surgery in the Intensive Care Unit.,https://www.ncbi.nlm.nih.gov/pubmed/31082359,The Annals of thoracic surgery,2019 06 10,The frequency and safety of overnight extubation (OE) following cardiac surgery across intensive care units (ICUs) is unknown.,A Simple Extra-Corporeal Knot tying technique in Minimal Access Surgery.,https://www.ncbi.nlm.nih.gov/pubmed/31082358,The Annals of thoracic surgery,2019 05 14,"Extra-corporeal knot tying is one of the challenges in minimally invasive surgery. The current aids are often associated with mechanical failures and application difficulties, a long learning curve, fraying of sutures, user errors and increased cost and reduced haptic feedback. We describe a technique which is very conventional and uses a PTFE pledget to lower the knot. Also in this technique there is no contact between the suture and the instrument at any point therefore fraying and tearing of sutures is not an issue. The technique is simple, inexpensive and has an extremely short learning curve. One of the major challenges in minimally access surgery is extra-corporeal knot tying. A wide variety of techniques have been described and a number of instruments have been devised for tying and pushing the knots down. However, there is no universal acceptance of any particular technique.We describe an extra-corporeal knot tying technique which does not require any special instruments, has an extremely short learning curve, does not cause fraying of sutures and owing to its simplicity has the potential for universal acceptance.",Long-term outcomes with mechanical versus biological aortic valve prosthesis in patients >70 years.,https://www.ncbi.nlm.nih.gov/pubmed/31082357,The Annals of thoracic surgery,2019 05 14,Biological prostheses are preferred for surgical aortic valve replacement (SAVR) in patients aged >70 years in clinical practice.

Methods: Patients with NAFLD were selected from the Physical examination center and the Department of Traditional and Western Medical Hepatology of Third Hospital of Hebei Medical University. A combination of ultrasound and liver elastography was used to screen NAFLD patients and healthy persons. General clinical characteristics, peripheral blood cell count and liver biochemical test results were collected synchronously, plasma samples were retained, and plasma HO-1 level was detected by enzyme-linked immunosorbent assay. SPSS21.0 statistical software was used for statistical analysis, multivariate logistic regression analyses was used to analyse the independent risk factors affecting the incidence and progression of NAFLD. The diagnostic efficacy of indicators related to development of NAFLD was assessed by the receiver operating characteristic curve(ROC). Results: A total of 328 patients with NAFLD and 113 healthy controls were included. According to the liver biochemical results, the NAFLD group was divided into 148 patients with normal liver enzymes and 180 patients with abnormal liver enzymes. The level of HO-1 in the three groups was 9.09 Â± 2.19, 14.38 Â± 2.63, 17.00 Â± 3.30 ng/ml, and was increased respectively of healthy controls, patients with normal liver enzymes and patients with abnormal liver enzymes. Analyzing plasma HO-1 levels of components associated with metabolic disorders suggests that components without metabolic syndrome(9.83 Â± 3.21) < components with 1 metabolic syndrome(13.59 Â± 3.72) < components with 2 or more metabolic syndrome(16.09 Â± 3.41), P < 0.001. The results of HO-1 level stratification analysis showed that WBC, ALT, AST, GGT, TG increased as HO-1 level increased, and the pairwise difference was statistically significant (P < 0.001). The WBC count of NAFLD is significantly higher than healthy group(6.79 Â± 1.62 vs 5.68 Â± 1.36, P < 0.001). The univariate and multivariate regression analyses of all the subjects showed that HO-1, TG and BMI were prognostic factors for the occurrence of NAFLD and HO-1, TC, GLU were prognostic factors for the progression of NAFLD, P < 0.05. The ROC analysis showed that HO-1 was reliable markers for predicting the occurrence and progression of NALFD, the sensitivity and specificity were respectively 85.10%, 92.90% and 38.33%, 95.27%. Conclusion: Plasma HO-1 can predict the occurrence and progression of NAFLD and is expected to be a novel molecular diagnostic marker for NAFLD and NASH.",[Relationship of TLR2 and TLR4 expressions on the surface of peripheral blood mononuclear cells to small intestinal bacteria overgrowth in patients with hepatocellular carcinoma].,https://www.ncbi.nlm.nih.gov/pubmed/31082340,Zhonghua gan zang bing za zhi = Zhonghua ganzangbing zazhi = Chinese journal of hepatology,2019 06 04,"Objective: To investigate TLR2 and TLR4 expressional situation on the surface of peripheral blood mononuclear cells (PBMC) in patients with hepatocellular carcinoma (HCC) and their relationship with small intestinal bacterial overgrowth (SIBO). Methods: Flow cytometry was used to detect TLR2 and TLR4 expressional situation on the surface of PBMC in 78 cases with HCC, 56 cases with cirrhosis and 33 healthy controls. Furthermore, lactose hydrogen breath test (LHBT) was used to detect small intestinal bacterial overgrowth. Results: Of the 78 cases with HCC, 56 cases (71.8%) were SIBO-positive, 23 cases (41.1%) were SIBO- positive in 56 cases with cirrhosis, and 1 (3.0%) was SIBO-positive in 33 healthy controls. The incidence of SIBO in HCC patients was higher than cirrhosis patients (Ï(2) = 12.72, P < 0.05) and healthy controls (Ï(2) = 41.18, P < 0.05). The expression levels of TLR2 and TLR4 in HCC patients (100.55 Â± 24.22, 42.76 Â± 15.96) were significantly higher than cirrhosis (67.42 Â± 18.36, 24.38 Â± 8.68)and healthy control group (33.06 Â± 11.72, 12.52 Â± 4.46) (P < 0.05).

Methods: Three siRNA target spots were designed and synthesized according to the CIT gene sequence. SK-Hep-1 HCC cells were transfected by liposome transfection. The knockdown efficiency of the target CIT gene was detected by real-time PCR and Western blot. Expressional change of CIT in SK-Hep-1 cells after 48 hours of siRNA interference were observed by immunohistochemistry and confocal microscopy. The proliferation of SK-Hep-1 cells after 48 hours of siRNA interference was detected by EdU cell proliferation assay. A t-test was used to compare the mean of two samples, and one-way ANOVA was used to compare the mean of multiple samples. Results: Western blot results showed that the three interference sequences were targeted at different target spots. The expression level of CIT protein in KD-1,-2, and-3 groups were decreased (P < 0.01) than control, while the protein expression level of KD1 group was the lowest. Real-time PCR results showed that compared with the control group, the expression level of CIT mRNA in KD-1, -2, and -3 groups decreased (P < 0.01), while that in KD1 group was the lowest. Laser confocal microscopy also confirmed that the morphological expression of CIT attenuated significantly after transfection with siRNA. The results of EdU proliferation assay showed that siRNA transfected with CIT significantly attenuated the proliferation of SK-Hep-1 hepatoma cells (P < 0.05). Conclusion: The successful construction and screening of siRNA fragments can effectively inhibit the expression and proliferation of CIT gene in hepatoma SK-Hep-1.",[Clinical significance of ascitic interleukin-7 expression levels in cirrhotic patients complicated with spontaneous bacterial peritonitis].,https://www.ncbi.nlm.nih.gov/pubmed/31082338,Zhonghua gan zang bing za zhi = Zhonghua ganzangbing zazhi = Chinese journal of hepatology,2019 06 04,"Objective: To observe ascitic interleukin-7 expression level in cirrhotic patients complicated with spontaneous bacterial peritonitis, and to detect the effect of recombinant human IL-7 on CD4(+) and CD8(+)T lymphocyte function. Methods: A total of 84 patients with liver cirrhosis who were hospitalized from August 2017 to April 2018 were selected. Among them, 51 cases were complicated with cirrhosis and untainted ascites, and 33 cases were cirrhosis complicated with spontaneous bacterial peritonitis. Peripheral blood and ascites were collected routinely. The levels of IL-7 in peripheral blood and ascites were measured by enzyme-linked immunosorbent assay. CD4(+)T cells and CD8(+)T cells were purified from ascites, and were stimulated with recombinant IL-7. Cellular proliferation, key transcription factors for mRNA, and cytokines production by CD4(+)T cells in response to IL-7 stimulation was measured. mRNA expression corresponding to perforin, granzyme B, and granulysin as well as cytokines production by CD8(+)T cells was also measured in response to IL-7 stimulation. Cytolytic and non-cytolytic activity of CD8(+)T cells in response to IL-7 stimulation was also investigated in both direct and indirect contact co-culture system. Measurement data of the normal distribution were compared between the two groups by Student's t-test and the data before and after stimulation were compared by paired t-test. Measurements that did not conform to normal distribution were compared between the two groups using Mann-Whitney U test, and data before and after stimulation were compared using Wilcoxon paired test. Results: There was no significant statistical difference in serum IL-7 levels between the two groups [(5 001 Â± 1 458) pg/ml vs. (4 768 Â± 1 128) pg/ml, P = 0.41].

Recombinant IL-7 stimulation promoted the proliferation of CD4(+) and CD8(+)T cells from ascites in patients with liver cirrhosis complicated by SBP. T-bet mRNA relative expression and IFN-Î³ secretion in CD4(+)T cells was also elevated in response to IL-7 stimulation in vitro. Moreover, IL-7 stimulation also increased the mRNA expressions of perforin, granzyme B, and granulysin as well as productions of IFN-Î³ and TNF-Î± by CD8(+)T cells. Recombinant IL-7 stimulation elevated cytolytic and non-cytolytic activity of CD8(+)T cells from ascites in patients with liver cirrohosis complicated by SBP, which manifested as increased target cell death and IFN-Î³ production in both direct and indirect contact co-culture system.

Methods: Thirty-six male Wistar rats were randomly assigned into control, model and treatment groups. Rats in the model and treatment groups were injected intraperitoneally with 40% CCl(4) (2 ml/kg), and the control group were given isotonic saline twice a week for six weeks. Meanwhile, the treatment group were gavaged with ALHXW solution daily (concentration 0.15 g/ml, 9.9 ml/kg) for 6 weeks, while the control and model groups were given isotonic saline once a day for 6 weeks. Serum levels of alanine aminotransferase (ALT) and aspartate aminotransferase (AST) were measured at the end of third and sixth week. At the end of six weeks, liver tissues were harvested for histopathological evaluation and the detection of mRNA and protein expression levels of MMP-2/13 and TIMP-1/2. According to different data, LSD method, parametric (one-way ANOVA) and non-parametric tests (Kruskal-Wallis H-test and Mann-Whitney U test) were used for statistical analysis. Results: Compared with the model group, ALHXW markedly alleviated liver injury in the treatment group, and thereby improved the general state of rats, liver and spleen morphological characteristics, and ALT and AST levels. Histopathological examination demonstrated that the extent of liver fibrosis was improved (2.75 Â± 0.75 vs. 3.55 Â± 0.69, P = 0.015) in the treatment group as compared with the model group. The mRNA and protein expression levels of MMP-13 in the treatment group were significantly higher than that of the model group (mRNA: 10.50 Â± 7.64 vs. 4.40 Â± 2.97, P = 0.029.

Conclusion: ALHXW exerts anti-liver fibrosis effects mainly by improving liver function, inhibiting the activation of hepatic stellate cells, enhancing the expression of MMP-13, and inhibiting the expression of MMP-2 and TIMP-1/2.","[Clinical study on liver function, virology, serological changes and the safety of drug withdrawal in pregnant women who are chronic HBV carriers during pregnancy and postpartum].",https://www.ncbi.nlm.nih.gov/pubmed/31082336,Zhonghua gan zang bing za zhi = Zhonghua ganzangbing zazhi = Chinese journal of hepatology,2019 06 04,"Objective: To observe the changes of liver function, virology and serology and the safety of drug withdrawal in pregnant women who are chronic hepatitis B virus (HBV) carriers. Methods: A prospective clinical cohort was established to enroll pregnant women who are chronic HBV carriers and they were divided into the nucleoside/nucleotide analogs (NAs) intervention group and the non-NAs intervention group according to patients' wishes. Liver function, HBV DNA and HBV serological markers were detected at gestation, postpartum 6 weeks, 12 weeks, 24 weeks, 36 weeks and 48 weeks. Results: 351 patients were enrolled, 320 in the NAs intervention group and 31 in the non-NAs intervention group. The proportion of postpartum hepatitis flares in both groups was higher than that in pregnancy (39.4% vs 12.5%, P < 0.001; 38.7% vs 3.2%, P = 0.001). Six weeks postpartum was the peak period of hepatitis flares, and 96.0% (121/126) of the hepatitis flares occurred within 24 weeks postpartum. At 6 weeks postpartum, there were 6 cases of alanine aminotransferase (ALT) â¥ 10 times upper limit of normal (ULN) in the NAs intervention group. The rate of the hepatitis flare after drug withdrawal was 16.7% (34/203). Conclusion: Regardless of the presence or absence of NAs intervention, pregnant women who are chronic HBV carriers have a certain proportion of hepatitis flares during pregnancy and postpartum, and the hepatitis flare even have a tendency to be severe. Therefore, drug withdrawal after delivery is not always safe, which requires close observation and classification. At 6 weeks postpartum, the incidence of hepatitis flares was high, and those who meet the treatment indications can get better therapeutic effects if given appropriate treatment. The vast majority (96%) of postpartum hepatitis flares occur within 24 weeks, so it is recommended to follow up to at least 24 weeks postpartum after discontinuation.",[Model for end-stage liver disease combined with arterial blood lactate to assess the prognosis of hepatitis B virus-associated acute-on-chronic liver failure: a retrospective analysis of 97 cases].,https://www.ncbi.nlm.nih.gov/pubmed/31082335,Zhonghua gan zang bing za zhi = Zhonghua ganzangbing zazhi = Chinese journal of hepatology,2019 06 04,"Objective: To explore the prognostic value of model for end-stage liver disease (MELD) combined with arterial blood lactate (Lac) in admitted patients with hepatitis B virus-associated acute- on-chronic liver failure (HBV-ACLF). Methods: Clinical data of 97 cases with hepatitis B virus-associated acute- on-chronic liver failure (HBV-ACLF) admitted to the First Affiliated Hospital of Suzhou University between March 2016 and March 2018 was retrospectively analyzed. Age, gender, complications, MELD score, lactic acid (Lac), total bilirubin (TBil), creatinine (Cr), serum albumin (Alb), high-sensitivity C-reactive protein (CRP), white blood cell count (WBC), platelet count (PLT), hematocrit (Hct), quantification of HBV DNA and HBsAg, and organ support treatment (artificial liver support system, renal replacement therapy and mechanical ventilation ) were documented after admission. The primary endpoint of treatment was death due to ineffective medical treatment during hospitalization, abandonment of medical treatment due to deterioration of the health condition, and switch to liver transplantation for patients with poor medical treatment. The risk factors for primary endpoint of treatment were analyzed by binary logistic regression. Hosmer-Lemeshow test was used to evaluate the goodness of fit for the scoring system, and the ROC to predict the prognosis of MELD-Lac. Results: Ninety-seven cases with HBV-ACLF were included, 56 cases had good prognosis, and 41 cases had bad prognosis (including two cases with poor medical treatment and liver transplantation). The overall improvement rate was 57.7%. MELD score and Lac value in treated group was significantly lower than non-treated group. Bivariable and multivariable logistic regression analysis showed that the MELD score [odds ratio (OR = 1.806)], and Lac score [odds ratio (OR = 1.820)] was the risk factor for hospitalization and mortality in patients with liver failure (P < 0.05). The area under the ROC curve (AUC) and the 95% confidence interval (95% CI) of prognostic patients with MELD-Lac were significantly better than Lac and MELD scores [0.923 (0.84 to 1.00) vs. 0.804 (0.067 to 0.942) and 0.864 (0.75). 0.977)], P < 0.05.

Multivariate logistic regression analysis was used to analyze the relative risk of genetic polymorphism and HBV-ACLF as well as the relationship between IL-6 SNPs with the occurrence and prognosis of HBV-ACLF. Results: Four hundred patients were included in the study, with 122 (30.5%) in the HBV-ACLF and 278 (69.5%) in the non-ACLF group. There were significant differences in total bilirubin, albumin, and white blood cell count, percentage of neutrophils, platelet count, alanine aminotransferase, aspartate aminotransferase, prothrombin time and international standardized ratio, creatinine and the model for end-stage liver disease score between the two groups (P < 0.001). The genotype of IL-6 genes (rs1800795, rs1800797, rs2069827, and rs2069830) of all subjects showed no mutation or the mutation rate under 1%. There was no significant difference in the genotype of IL-6 (rs1524107, rs2069837, rs2069840 and rs2069845) between the two groups (P > 0.05). Multivariate logistic regression analysis showed that the SNPs in the above four loci of IL-6 gene was not associated with HBV-ACLF risk, nor had significant correlation with the 3-months prognosis. Conclusion: The SNP genotyping of eight loci in IL-6 gene (rs1524107, rs1800795, rs1800797, rs2069827, rs2069830, rs2069837, rs2069840 and rs2069845) is unrelated to the occurrence and short-term prognosis of HBV-ACLF.",[Study of endoplasmic reticulum stress role in hepatic failure induced by severe hepatitis B].,https://www.ncbi.nlm.nih.gov/pubmed/31082333,Zhonghua gan zang bing za zhi = Zhonghua ganzangbing zazhi = Chinese journal of hepatology,2019 06 04,"Objective: To investigate the endoplasmic reticulum stress (ERS) role in the course of liver failure induced by severe hepatitis B virus (HBV) infection and its related mechanism. Methods: Liver tissue samples and clinical data [chronic hepatitis B patients (12 cases, chronic hepatitis B group), hepatic failure induced by severe hepatitis B virus (12 cases, severe hepatitis B virus liver failure group), and normal subjects (8 cases, control group)] were collected from the Beijing You'an Hospital affiliated to Capital Medical University between 2009 to 2011. Statistical analysis was performed on the clinical indicators of each group. The structure of endoplasmic reticulum in liver tissue was observed by transmission electron microscopy. Western blot and qRT-PCR were used to detect the expression of endoplasmic reticulum stress and apoptosis-related factors, including glucose-regulated protein (Grp), and C/EBP homologous protein (CHOP). Frozen sections of liver tissues were prepared for immunofluorescence test. All data were expressed as mean Â± standard deviation. LSD-t test was used to compare the results between groups. A p value < 0.05 was considered as statistically significant. Results: Transmission electron microscopy showed that the morphological structure of the endoplasmic reticulum was damaged in both groups (chronic hepatitis B and liver failure induced by severe hepatitis B virus), and liver failure induced by severe hepatitis B virus group was more critical. Western blot and qRT-PCR showed that Grp78, Grp94 and Caspase-4 were highly expressed in normal group and chronic hepatitis B group, and the relative protein expressions were 1.20 Â± 0.13 and 0.78 Â± 0.11, 0.90 Â± 0.06 and 0.11 Â± 0.01, 0.15 Â± 0.02 and 0.22 Â± 0.04, respectively. The expression of protein was weakened in liver failure induced by severe hepatitis B virus group (relative protein expression was 0.01 Â± 0, 0.01 Â± 0, and 0.11 Â± 0.02, respectively).There was a statistically significant difference between the two groups (P < 0.05). The expression of CHOP was consistent with the results of immunofluorescence, and increased with the stressing of injury. Conclusion: During the course of severe hepatitis B infection, dysregulated endoplasmic reticulum stress activated mild stress in chronic hepatitis B group, while severe stress in hepatic failure induced by severe hepatitis B virus group. Therefore, endoplasmic reticulum stress plays an important and complex role in the pathogenesis of hepatic failure induced by severe hepatitis B virus.",[Advances in liver immunology in 2018].,https://www.ncbi.nlm.nih.gov/pubmed/31082332,Zhonghua gan zang bing za zhi = Zhonghua ganzangbing zazhi = Chinese journal of hepatology,2019 06 04,"The mechanism of innate and adaptive immune responses to chronic infections with hepatotropic viruses (HBV, HCV) was studied in 2018.

In two consecutive years of field trials, wheat bran (20.2 Mg ha-1), molasses (10.1 Mg ha-1), and wheat bran (20.2 Mg ha-1) plus molasses (10.1 Mg ha-1) were assessed as ASD carbon sources and compared with nonamended controls. Data were collected from plants grown in the field and from plants grown in field-treated soils in growth chamber-based post-ASD bioassays. Anaerobic conditions developed in ASD-treated soils in both trial years, as indicated by polyvinyl chloride pipes painted with an iron oxide paint. Soil pH did not decrease during ASD at the Huron County site of the mustard greens clubroot trials in either trial year but soil pH decreased significantly during ASD in Stark County soils treated with ASD with either wheat bran or wheat bran plus molasses compared with control soils in both trial years. Impacts of ASD on plant biomass were inconsistent in direct field measurements; however, significantly higher biomasses were observed in lettuce and mustard greens grown in bioassay soils collected from plots treated with ASD with wheat bran-based amendments compared with plants grown in soils from control plots. Based on direct field measurements and bioassays, the use of ASD with any carbon source led to significant reductions in root-knot nematode galling on lettuce compared with controls. Reductions in clubroot severity in mustard greens following ASD were less consistent; however, significant reductions in clubroot severity were observed in the field in one trial year and in both years of bioassays. The results of these studies indicate that ASD is a promising tool for managing soilborne diseases in muck soil vegetable production systems.",Biological and Molecular Properties of Wild potato mosaic virus Isolates from Pepino (Solanum muricatum).,https://www.ncbi.nlm.nih.gov/pubmed/31082318,Plant disease,2019 05 14,"In 1976, a virus with flexuous, filamentous virions typical of the family Potyviridae was isolated from symptomatic pepino (Solanum muricatum) plants growing in two valleys in Peru's coastal desert region. In 2014, a virus with similar-shaped virions was isolated from asymptomatic fruit obtained from pepino plants growing in six coastal valleys and a valley in Peru's Andean highlands. Both were identified subsequently as Wild potato mosaic virus (WPMV) by serology or high-throughput sequencing (HTS). The symptoms caused by two old and seven new isolates from pepino were examined in indicator plants. Infected solanaceous hosts varied considerably in their sensitivities to infection and individual isolates varied greatly in virulence. All seven new isolates caused quick death of infected Nicotiana benthamiana plants and more than half of them killed infected plants of Physalis floridana and S. chancayense. These three species were the most sensitive to infection. The most virulent isolate was found to be BA because it killed five of eight solanaceous host species whereas CA was the least severe because it only killed N. benthamiana. Using HTS, complete genomic sequences of six isolates were obtained, with one isolate (FE) showing evidence of recombination. The distances between individual WPMV isolates in phylogenetic trees and the geographical distances between their collection sites were found to be unrelated. The individual WPMV isolates displayed nucleotide sequence identities of 80.9-99.8%, whereas the most closely related virus, Potato virus V (PVV), was around 75% identical to WPMV. WPMV, PVV, and Peru tomato virus formed clusters of similar phylogenetic diversity, and were found to be distinct but related viruses within the overall Potato virus Y lineage. WPMV infection seems widespread and of likely economic significance to pepino producers in Peru's coastal valleys. Because it constitutes the fifth virus found infecting pepino and this crop is entirely vegetatively propagated, development of healthy pepino stock programs is advocated.",Relationship Between Resting Heart Rate Variability and Intermittent Endurance Performance in Novice Soccer Players.,https://www.ncbi.nlm.nih.gov/pubmed/31082316,Research quarterly for exercise and sport,2019 05 14,This study examined the relationships between the Yo-Yo Intermittent Recovery Test level 1 (Yo-Yo IR1) and resting heart rate variability (HRV) and submaximal 5'-5' test derived measures in novice male soccer players.,A Model of Queer STEM Identity in the Workplace.,https://www.ncbi.nlm.nih.gov/pubmed/31082315,Journal of homosexuality,2019 05 14,"Science, technology, engineering, and mathematics (STEM) fields are often stereotyped as spaces in which personal identity is subsumed in the pursuit of a single-minded focus on objective scientific truths, and correspondingly rigid expectations of gender and sexuality are widespread.

Through our analysis, we identified three distinct but related processes of Defining a queer gender and/or sexual identity, Forming an identity as a STEM professional, and Navigating identities at work. We found that heteronormative assumptions frequently silence conversations about gender and sexuality in STEM workplaces and result in complicated negotiations of self for queer professionals. This analysis of the personal accounts of queer students, faculty, and staff in STEM reveals unique processes of identity negotiation and elucidates how different social positioning creates challenges and opportunities for inclusivity.",Advances in science and applications of air pollution monitoring: A case study on oil sands monitoring targeting ecosystem protection.,https://www.ncbi.nlm.nih.gov/pubmed/31082314,Journal of the Air & Waste Management Association (1995),2019 05 24,"The potential environmental impact of air pollutants emitted from the oil sands industry in Alberta, Canada, has received considerable attention. The mining and processing of bitumen to produce synthetic crude oil, and the waste products associated with this activity, lead to significant emissions of gaseous and particle air pollutants. Deposition of pollutants occurs locally (i.e., near the sources) and also potentially at distances downwind, depending upon each pollutant's chemical and physical properties and meteorological conditions. The Joint Oil Sands Monitoring Program (JOSM) was initiated in 2012 by the Government of Canada and the Province of Alberta to enhance or improve monitoring of pollutants and their potential impacts. In support of JOSM, Environment and Climate Change Canada (ECCC) undertook a significant research effort via three components: the Air, Water, and Wildlife components, which were implemented to better estimate baseline conditions related to levels of pollutants in the air and water, amounts of deposition, and exposures experienced by the biota. The criteria air contaminants (e.g., nitrogen oxides [NOx], sulfur dioxide [SO2], volatile organic compounds [VOCs], particulate matter with an aerodynamic diameter <2.5 Î¼m [PM2.5]) and their secondary atmospheric products were of interest, as well as toxic compounds, particularly polycyclic aromatic compounds (PACs), trace metals, and mercury (Hg). This critical review discusses the challenges of assessing ecosystem impacts and summarizes the major results of these efforts through approximately 2018. Focus is on the emissions to the air and the findings from the Air Component of the ECCC research and linkages to observations of contaminant levels in the surface waters in the region, in aquatic species, as well as in terrestrial and avian species. The existing evidence of impact on these species is briefly discussed, as is the potential for some of them to serve as sentinel species for the ongoing monitoring needed to better understand potential effects, their potential causes, and to detect future changes. Quantification of the atmospheric emissions of multiple pollutants needs to be improved, as does an understanding of the processes influencing fugitive emissions and local and regional deposition patterns. The influence of multiple stressors on biota exposure and response, from natural bitumen and forest fires to climate change, complicates the current ability to attribute effects to air emissions from the industry. However, there is growing evidence of the impact of current levels of PACs on some species, pointing to the need to improve the ability to predict PAC exposures and the key emission source involved. Although this critical review attempts to integrate some of the findings across the components, in terms of ECCC activities, increased coordination or integration of air, water, and wildlife research would enhance deeper scientific understanding. Improved understanding is needed in order to guide the development of long-term monitoring strategies that could most efficiently inform a future adaptive management approach to oil sands environmental monitoring and prevention of impacts. Implications: Quantification of atmospheric emissions for multiple pollutants needs to be improved, and reporting mechanisms and standards could be adapted to facilitate such improvements, including periodic validation, particularly where uncertainties are the largest. Understanding of baseline conditions in the air, water and biota has improved significantly; ongoing enhanced monitoring, building on this progress, will help improve ecosystem protection measures in the oil sands region. Sentinel species have been identified that could be used to identify and characterize potential impacts of wildlife exposure, both locally and regionally. Polycyclic aromatic compounds are identified as having an impact on aquatic and terrestrial wildlife at current concentration levels although the significance of these impacts and attribution to emissions from oil sands development requires further assessment. Given the improvement in high resolution air quality prediction models, these should be a valuable tool to future environmental assessments and cumulative environment impact assessments.",Accuracy of Impedance Cardiography for Hemodynamic Assessment During Rest and Exercise in Wheelchair Rugby Players.,https://www.ncbi.nlm.nih.gov/pubmed/31082312,Research quarterly for exercise and sport,2019 05 14,The aim of the study was to analyze the accuracy of impedance cardiography (ICG) for hemodynamic assessment in wheelchair rugby players during rest and exercise.,A Brief Introduction to Methods for Describing Body Temperature in Endotherms.,https://www.ncbi.nlm.nih.gov/pubmed/31082311,Physiological and biochemical zoology : PBZ,2019 05 14,"Researchers commonly measure body, orifice, or skin temperature (collectively referred to as body temperature [Tb] herein) of endothermic animals in biomedical, physiological, evolutionary, and ecological studies. However, comparing Tb among species or placing a single study in context is challenging because there is no single, standard method to describe and synthesize Tb data of endotherms. A variety of metrics are available, and each has strengths and weaknesses appropriate for answering different types of questions. Importantly, choosing the wrong metric to address the question posed can lead to misinterpretations and misleading presentation of Tb data. Here I review standard metrics used to describe central tendencies and variation in Tb of endothermic species, focusing on important strengths and weaknesses and suggested questions to be addressed using each metric. One of the most common mistakes in analyzing Tb data is mismatching the analytical metric and the question being asked, so, ultimately, individual researchers need to determine which is most appropriate for addressing their question based on the implications of using each metric.",The Impact of Defective Viruses on Infection and Immunity.,https://www.ncbi.nlm.nih.gov/pubmed/31082310,Annual review of virology,2019 06 12,"Defective viral genomes (DVGs) are generated during viral replication and are unable to carry out a full replication cycle unless coinfected with a full-length virus. DVGs are produced by many RNA viruses, and their presence correlates with alterations in infection outcomes. Historically, DVGs were studied for their ability to interfere with standard virus replication as well as for their association with viral persistence. More recently, a critical role for DVGs in inducing the innate immune response during infection was appreciated. Here we review the role of DVGs of RNA viruses in shaping outcomes of experimental as well as natural infections and explore the mechanisms by which DVGs impact infection outcome.

We examined whether: (1) individuals with SAD differed from healthy controls (HCs) in sleep quality, (2) baseline sleep quality moderated the effects of treatment (Cognitive-behavioral group therapy [CBGT] vs. mindfulness-based stress reduction [MBSR] vs. waitlist [WL]) on social anxiety, (3) sleep quality changed over treatment, and (4) changes in sleep quality predicted anxiety 12-months post-treatment. Design: Participants were 108 adults with SAD from a randomized controlled trial of CBGT vs. MBSR vs. WL and 38 HCs. Methods: SAD and sleep quality were assessed pre-treatment and post-treatment; SAD was assessed again 12-months post-treatment. Results: Participants with SAD reported poorer sleep quality than HCs. The effect of treatment condition on post-treatment social anxiety did not differ as a function of baseline sleep quality. Sleep quality improved in MBSR, significantly more than WL, but not CBGT. Sleep quality change from pre- to post-treatment in CBGT or MBSR did not predict later social anxiety. Conclusions: MBSR, and not CBGT, improved sleep quality among participants. Other results were inconsistent with prior research; possible explanations, limitations, and implications for future research are discussed.

This results in faster clinical decision making and new, more efficient models of care, with clinical, process and economic benefits potentially accruing to all stakeholders. Recognised barriers to the adoption of new technology such as POCT include poor understanding of current practice and thus the unmet need, the challenges of process change, and reluctance to disinvest in redundant resources resulting from improved pathway efficiency. Major contributors to this problem include a background of funding, organisation and management of healthcare that fails to recognise the complexity of a multiple stakeholder health economy seeking to become more outcomes-based and value driven. We examine the concept of a structured value proposition as a generic tool to achieve better adoption of POCT using as an example, the evidence that is available for the rapid measurement of glycated haemoglobin (HbA1c) in the management of diabetes. We highlight the key components of the value proposition, identifying the impact of the test result on all stakeholders and the metrics which are required to define current practice (e.g. a laboratory-based HbA1c testing service), in order to develop the business case and the implementation plan required to demonstrate effective adoption of a POCT-based service.

Furthermore, tRNAs are highly structured and posttranscriptionally modified. Together, these unique features have impeded the adoption of modern genomics and transcriptomics technologies for tRNA studies. Nevertheless, it has become apparent from human neurogenetic research that many tRNA biogenesis proteins cause brain abnormalities and other neurological disorders when mutated. The cerebral cortex, cerebellum, and peripheral nervous system show defects, impairment, and degeneration upon tRNA misregulation, suggesting that they are particularly sensitive to changes in tRNA expression or function.

One important reason for this is that the outcome of a mutation can depend on the genetic context in which it occurs. This dependency is known as epistasis. In recent years, there has been a concerted effort to quantify the extent of pairwise and higher-order genetic interactions between mutations through deep mutagenesis of proteins and RNAs. This research has revealed two major components of epistasis: nonspecific genetic interactions caused by nonlinearities in genotype-to-phenotype maps, and specific interactions between particular mutations. Here, we provide an overview of our current understanding of the mechanisms causing epistasis at the molecular level, the consequences of genetic interactions for evolution and genetic prediction, and the applications of epistasis for understanding biology and determining macromolecular structures.

In this work, we examined if low concentrations of essential elements (Co, Mn, Zn, and Fe) modified the response of a freshwater green alga ( Chlamydomonas reinhardtii) to copper. To do so, we followed cell growth over 72 h in exposure media where the essential element concentrations were manipulated. Among these elements, iron proved to have a strong impact on the cells' response to copper. The free Cu2+ concentrations required to inhibit cellular growth by 50% (EC50) over 72 h decreased from 2 nM in regular Fe medium (10-17.6 M Fe3+) to 4 pM in low iron medium (10-19.0 M Fe3+); a 500-fold increase in toxicity. Moreover, at low Cu2+ concentrations (10-13.0 to 10-10.5 M), Cu uptake increased under low iron conditions but remain relatively stable under regular iron conditions. These results show clearly that iron plays a protective role against copper uptake and toxicity to C. reinhardtii. In freshwaters, iron is always abundant but the expected free iron concentrations in surface waters can vary between 10-14.0 to 10-20.0 M, depending on pH (e.g., when pH increases from 6 to 8). We conclude that copper toxicity in natural waters can be modulated by iron and that, in some conditions, the Biotic Ligand Model may need to be further developed to account for the influence of iron.",Direct Evidence for Charge Compensation-Induced Large Magnetoresistance in Thin WTe2.,https://www.ncbi.nlm.nih.gov/pubmed/31082263,Nano letters,2019 06 16,"Since the discovery of extremely large nonsaturating magnetoresistance (MR) in WTe2, much effort has been devoted to understanding the underlying mechanism, which is still under debate. Here, we explicitly identify the dominant physical origin of the large nonsaturating MR through in situ tuning of the magneto-transport properties in thin WTe2 film. With an electrostatic doping approach, we observed a nonmonotonic gate dependence of the MR. The MR reaches a maximum (10600%) in thin WTe2 film at certain gate voltage where electron and hole concentrations are balanced, indicating that the charge compensation is the dominant mechanism of the observed large MR. Besides, we show that the temperature-dependent magnetoresistance exhibits similar tendency with the carrier mobility when the charge compensation is retained, revealing that distinct scattering mechanisms may be at play for the temperature dependence of magneto-transport properties. Our work would be helpful for understanding mechanism of the large MR in other nonmagnetic materials and offers an avenue for achieving large MR in the nonmagnetic materials with electron-hole pockets.",Anomalous Quantum Metal in a 2D Crystalline Superconductor with Electronic Phase Nonuniformity.,https://www.ncbi.nlm.nih.gov/pubmed/31082262,Nano letters,2019 06 16,"The details of the superconducting to quantum metal transition (SQMT) at T = 0 are an open problem that invokes great interest in the nature of this exotic and unexpected ground state (Ephron et al., 1996; Mason and Kapitulnik, 1999; Chervenak and Valles, 2000). However, the SQMT was not yet investigated in a crystalline 2D superconductor with coexisting and fluctuating quantum orders. Here, we report the observation of a SQMT in 2D ion-gel-gated 1T-TiSe2 (Li et al., 2016) driven by a magnetic field. A field-induced crossover between Bose quantum metal and vortex quantum creeping with an increasing field is observed. We discuss the interplay between superconducting and CDW fluctuations (discommensurations) and their relation to the anomalous quantum metal (AQM) phase. From our findings, gate-tunable 1T-TiSe2 emerges as a privileged platform to scrutinize, in a controlled way, the details of the SQMT, the role of coexisting fluctuating orders and, ultimately, to obtain a deeper understanding of the fate of superconductivity in strictly two-dimensional crystals near zero temperature.",Toward a Better Understanding of the Nature-Inspired Aquaporin Biomimetic Membrane.,https://www.ncbi.nlm.nih.gov/pubmed/31082261,Langmuir : the ACS journal of surfaces and colloids,2019 06 10,"The biomimetic membrane technology may unlock unprecedented membrane separation capabilities to solve the increasing need for clean water. Despite the efforts in exploring numerous membrane preparation methods, the membrane performance achieved to date is still far from the theoretical predictions. To overcome this bottleneck, a deeper understanding of the role of the channels or vesicles immobilized on the membrane would be required. In this work, we seek to quantify the amount of vesicles immobilized per unit area of membrane and correlate it with the membrane performance. The results show that, although the vesicles successfully immobilized onto the membrane increase with an increasing vesicle concentration, less than 4% of the vesicles loaded onto the membrane successfully remains on the membrane after interfacial polymerization. Furthermore, an increase in the amount of vesicles remaining on the membrane may not always result in improvement in membrane performance. To the best of our knowledge, this is the first time that a study has been performed to determine an accurate relationship between the vesicles immobilized and the biomimetic membrane performance.",All-Dry Transfer of Graphene Film by van der Waals Interactions.,https://www.ncbi.nlm.nih.gov/pubmed/31082260,Nano letters,2019 06 16,"We report a method that uses van der Waals interactions to transfer continuous, high-quality graphene films from Ge(110) to a different substrate held by hexagonal boron nitride carriers in a clean, dry environment. The transferred films are uniform and continuous with low defect density and few charge puddles. The transfer is effective because of the weak interfacial adhesion energy between graphene and Ge. Based on the minimum strain energy required for the isolation of film, the upper limit of the interfacial adhesion energy is estimated to be 23 meV per carbon atom, which makes graphene/Ge(110) the first as-grown graphene film that has a substrate adhesion energy lower than that of typical van der Waals interactions between layered materials. Our results suggest that graphene on Ge can serve as an ideal material platform to be integrated with other material systems by a clean assembly process.",Preferential Binding of Cytochrome c to Anionic Ligand-Coated Gold Nanoparticles: A Complementary Computational and Experimental Approach.,https://www.ncbi.nlm.nih.gov/pubmed/31082259,ACS nano,2019 06 11,"Membrane-bound proteins can play a role in the binding of anionic gold nanoparticles (AuNPs) to model bilayers; however, the mechanism for this binding remains unresolved. In this work, we determine the relative orientation of the peripheral membrane protein cytochrome c in binding to a mercaptopropionic acid-functionalized AuNP (MPA-AuNP). As this is nonrigid binding, traditional methods involving crystallographic or rigid molecular docking techniques are ineffective at resolving the question. Instead, we have implemented a computational assay technique using a cross-correlation of a small ensemble of 200 ns long molecular dynamics trajectories to identify a preferred nonrigid binding orientation or pose of cytochrome c on MPA-AuNPs. We have also employed a mass spectrometry-based footprinting method that enables the characterization of the stable protein corona that forms at long time-scales in solution but remains in a dynamic state. Through the combination of these computational and experimental primary results, we have established a consensus result establishing the identity of the exposed regions of cytochrome c in proximity to MPA-AuNPs and its complementary pose(s) with amino-acid specificity. Moreover, the tandem use of the two methods can be applied broadly to determine the accessibility of membrane-binding sites for peripheral membrane proteins upon adsorption to AuNPs or to determine the exposed amino-acid residues of the hard corona that drive the acquisition of dynamic soft coronas. We anticipate that the combined use of simulation and experimental methods to characterize biomolecule-nanoparticle interactions, as demonstrated here, will become increasingly necessary as the complexity of such target systems grows.",Ab Initio Flexible Force Field for Metal-Organic Frameworks Using Dummy Model Coordination Bonds.,https://www.ncbi.nlm.nih.gov/pubmed/31082258,Journal of chemical theory and computation,2019 06 13,"We present force fields developed from periodic density functional theory (DFT) calculations that can be used in classical molecular simulations to model M-MOF-74 (M = Co, Fe, Mg, Mn, Ni, Zn) and its extended linker analogs. Our force fields are based on cationic dummy models (CDMs). These dummy models simplify the methodology required to tune the parameters and improve the accuracy of the force fields. We used our force fields to compare mechanical properties across the M-MOF-74 series and determine that increasing the size of the linker decreases the framework rigidity. In addition, we applied our force fields to an extended linker analog of Mg-MOF-74 and characterized the free energy of a previously reported deformation pattern in which the one-dimensional hexagonal channels of the framework become irregular. The free energy profiles confirm that the deformation is adsorbate induced and impossible to access solely by a pressure stimulus. On the basis of our results, we conclude that the force fields presented here and others that may be developed using our methodology are transferable across metal-organic framework series that share a metal center topology. Finally, we believe that these force fields have the potential to be adapted for the study of complex problems in MOF chemistry, including defects and crystal growth, that have thus far been beyond the scope of classical molecular simulations.",Charge-Transfer-Induced Photoluminescence Properties of WSe2 Monolayer-Bilayer Homojunction.,https://www.ncbi.nlm.nih.gov/pubmed/31082257,ACS applied materials & interfaces,2019 06 13,"The charge-transfer process in transition-metal dichalcogenides (TMDCs) lateral homojunction affects the electron-hole recombination process of in optoelectronic devices. However, the optical properties of the homojunction reflecting the charge-transfer process has not been observed and studied. In this work, we investigated the charge-transfer-induced emission properties based on monolayer (1L)-bilayer (2L) WSe2 lateral homojunction with dozens of nanometer monolayer region. On the one hand, the photoluminescence (PL) emission of bilayer WSe2 from the homojunction area blue shifts â¼23 and â¼31 meV for direct and indirect bandgap emission, respectively, compared with the bare WSe2 bilayer region. The blue shift of the emission spectrum in the bilayer WSe2 is ascribed to the decrease in binding energy induced by charge transfer from monolayer to bilayer. On the other hand, the energy shift shows a tendency to increase as the temperature decreases. The energy blue shift is â¼57 meV for direct bandgap emission at 80 K, which is larger than that (â¼23 meV) at room temperature. The larger-energy blue shift at low temperature is derived from the larger driving force under larger band offset. Our observations of the unique optical properties induced by efficient charge transfer are very helpful for exploring novel TMDC-based optoelectronic devices.",Controlling Rotation of Two-Dimensional Material Flakes.,https://www.ncbi.nlm.nih.gov/pubmed/31082256,ACS nano,2019 06 11,"Interlayer rotational alignment in van der Waals (vdW) structures of two-dimensional (2D) materials couples strongly to electronic properties and, therefore, has significant technological implications. Nevertheless, controlling the rotation of an arbitrary 2D material flake remains a challenge in the development of rotation-tunable electronics, for the emerging field of twistronics. In this article, we reveal a general moirÃ©-driven mechanism that governs the interlayer rotation. Controlling the moirÃ© can therefore hold promise for controlling the interlayer rotation. We further demonstrate mismatch strain engineering as a useful tool to design the interlayer rotation via changing the energy landscape of moirÃ© within a finite-sized region. The robustness and programmable nature of our approach arise from moirÃ© symmetry, energetics, and mechanics. Our approach provides another possibility to the on-demand design of rotation-tunable electronics.",2D in Seconds: Coupling of Chip-HPLC with Ion Mobility Spectrometry.,https://www.ncbi.nlm.nih.gov/pubmed/31082255,Analytical chemistry,2019 06 11,"The online hyphenation of chip-based high-performance liquid chromatography (chip-HPLC) with ion mobility spectrometry (IMS) via fully integrated electrospray emitters is introduced.

Proof-of-concept studies with the newly developed analytical setup revealed the suitability of IMS as a promising and powerful detection concept for chip-based separation techniques. Comparison of IMS with fluorescence detection and electrospray ionization-mass spectrometry (ESI-MS) allowed a more detailed characterization of the IMS as a new detection method for chip-HPLC. Moreover, the analysis of a mixture consisting of three isobaric antidepressants demonstrated the performance of chip-HPLC/IMS as a miniaturized two-dimensional separation technique."

Despite the myriad of available material selections and device architectures, it is still fundamentally challenging to develop eco-friendly fiber-shaped aqueous rechargeable batteries (FARBs) on a single-fiber architecture with high energy density and long-term stability. Here, we demonstrate flexible and high-voltage coaxial-fiber aqueous rechargeable zinc-ion batteries (CARZIBs). By utilizing a novel spherical zinc hexacyanoferrate with prominent electrochemical performance as cathode material, the assembled CARZIB offers a large capacity of 100.2 mAh cm-3 and a high energy density of 195.39 mWh cm-3, outperforming the state-of-the-art FARBs. Moreover, the resulting CARZIB delivers outstanding flexibility with the capacity retention of 93.2% after bending 3000 times. Last, high operating voltage and output current are achieved by the serial and parallel connection of CARZIBs woven into the flexible textile to power high-energy-consuming devices.

Solid maps of band gap energies achievable with quantum dots, nanowires, and nanoplatelets concerning sizes, shapes, and halide compositions are presented, which should be informative to experimentalists for band gap designs. The pathway to suppress band gap instability that appeared in mixed halide perovskites is proposed, revealing that the red shift induced by halide phase separation can be hugely diminished by reducing sizes and adopting halides of lower electronegativity.

The potential for clinical translation for APC analogs will strongly depend on their pharmacokinetic (PK) profiles. The aim of this work was to understand how the chemical structures of various APC analogs impact binding and PK. To achieve this aim, we performed in silico docking analysis, in vitro and in vivo partitioning experiments, and in vivo PK studies. Our results have identified 7 potential high-affinity binding sites of these compounds on human serum albumin (HSA) and suggest that the size of the functional group directly influences the albumin binding, partitioning, and PK. Namely, the bulkier the functional groups, the weaker the agent binds to albumin, the more the agent partitions onto lipoproteins, and the less time the agent spends in circulation. The results of these experiments provide novel molecular insights into the binding, partitioning, and PK of this class of compounds and similar molecules, as well as suggests pharmacological strategies to alter their PK profiles. Our methodology may provide a way to design better drugs by better characterizing PK profile for lead compound optimization.","Porous Organic Polymer-Derived Nanopalladium Catalysts for Chemoselective Synthesis of Antitumor Benzofuro[2,3- b]pyrazine from 2-Bromophenol and Isonitriles.",https://www.ncbi.nlm.nih.gov/pubmed/31082239,Organic letters,2019 06 11,"An efficient strategy for the synthesis of benzofuro[2,3- b]pyrazines was developed.

Solvent orientational correlation functions and a time-dependent analysis of the solvation structure confirm that the initial, fast observed red shift can be traced back to the destruction-formation of hydrogen bond networks in the first-neighbor shell, whereas the subsequent shift, evident in the [20-500] ps range and accompanied by a large broadening of the signal, is connected to a collective reorientation of the second and farther solvation shells, which significantly changes the electrostatic embedding felt by the excited solute.",Sterical Recognition at Helix-Helix Interface of Leu-Aib-Based Polypeptides with and without a GxxxG-Motif.,https://www.ncbi.nlm.nih.gov/pubmed/31082236,Langmuir : the ACS journal of surfaces and colloids,2019 06 10,"An amphiphilic polypeptide, poly(sarcosine)- b-(l-Leu-Aib)8 (SL16), was reported to self-assemble into vesicles.

In addition to the well understood mechanism through which hydroxyl radical (Â·OH) produced by nitrate and nitrite photolysis oxidizes contaminants, absorption of light also results in the formation of reactive nitrogen species that transform organic contaminants. To assess the importance of this process on the fate of trace organic contaminants, radical quenchers and transformation product analysis were used to discriminate among potential reaction pathways. For sulfamethoxazole, an antibiotic that is frequently detected in municipal wastewater effluent, nitrate and nitrite-sensitized photolysis pathways resulted in production of transformation products that were not detected during direct photolysis or reaction with Â·OH. The reactivity of sulfamethoxazole with the reactive species produced when nitrite absorbed sunlight was affected by the presence of hydroxyl radical scavengers, indicating the likely involvement of nitrogen dioxide, which forms when nitrite reacts with hydroxyl radical. Reactive nitrogen species also reacted with emtricitabine, propranolol, and other trace organic contaminants commonly detected in wastewater effluent, indicating the potential importance of this process to the fate of other trace organic contaminants. A kinetic model indicated that reactive nitrogen species could be important to the phototransformation of trace organic contaminants when relatively high concentrations of nitrite are present (e.g., in surface waters receiving reverse osmosis concentrate from potable water reuse projects or in agricultural runoff).",Multiplexed Charge Detection Mass Spectrometry for High-Throughput Single Ion Analysis of Large Molecules.,https://www.ncbi.nlm.nih.gov/pubmed/31082222,Analytical chemistry,2019 06 10,"Applications of charge detection mass spectrometry (CDMS) for measuring the masses of large molecules, macromolecular complexes, and synthetic polymers that are too large or heterogeneous for conventional mass spectrometry measurements are made possible by weighing individual ions in order to avoid interferences between ions. Here, a new multiplexing method that makes it possible to measure the masses of many ions simultaneously in CDMS is demonstrated. Ions with a broad range of kinetic energies are trapped. The energy of each ion is obtained from the ratio of the intensity of the fundamental to the second harmonic frequencies of the periodic trapping motion making it possible to measure both the m/ z and charge of each ion. Because ions with the exact same m/ z but with different energies appear at different frequencies, the probability of ion-ion interference is significantly reduced. We show that the measured mass of a protein complex consisting of 16 protomers, RuBisCO (517 kDa), is not affected by the number of trapped ions with up to 21 ions trapped simultaneously in these experiments. Ion-ion interactions do not affect the ion trapping lifetime up to 1 s, and there is no influence of the number of ions on the measured charge-state distribution of bovine serum albumin (66.5 kDa), indicating that ion-ion interactions do not adversely affect any of these measurements. Over an order of magnitude gain in measurement speed over single ion analysis is demonstrated, and significant additional gains are expected with this multi-ion measurement method.",Assembling Bi2MoO6/Ru/g-C3N4 for Highly Effective Oxygen Generation from Water Splitting under Visible-Light Irradiation.,https://www.ncbi.nlm.nih.gov/pubmed/31082221,Inorganic chemistry,2019 06 03,"Water oxidation is a kinetically challenging reaction for photocatalytic overall water splitting. Producing one molecule of O2 will consume four electrons, so it is an extremely difficult obstacle for researchers. Here, a Bi2MoO6/Ru/g-C3N4 composite was obtained by a gentle hydrothermal method, which could oxidize water into O2 highly efficiently. The optimal O2 production reached 328.34 Î¼molÂ·g-1Â·h-1 under visible light irradiation. Moreover, the catalyst presented excellent stability, as shown by a still sustentative 91.4% photocatalytic activity and invariant textural structure after seven recycling tests. The ternary material had the smallest resistance, which indicated that it has a good photoelectron conductive tunnel, and a rapid transfer route is proposed through Bi2MoO6 â Ru â g-C3N4 â NaIO3 (electron acceptor). The massive holes (h+) with high oxidative potential are surely enriched due to the quick electron migration, being fit for a large promotion of the multiple-electron water oxidative proceedings. Therefore, the metallic Ru provided a powerful bridge for efficient transfer of the interface electrons which could be beneficial to spatial separation of photoexcited carriers without the loss of the high redox capacity. Finally, it is proposed that the Ru-assisted electron transport and constituent synergy in Bi2MoO6/Ru/g-C3N4 composite play crucial roles to its enhanced light utilization, efficient photoelectric conversion property, and high-producing oxygen capability.",Parallel Post-Translational Modification Scanning Enhancing Hydrogen-Deuterium Exchange-Mass Spectrometry Coverage of Key Structural Regions.,https://www.ncbi.nlm.nih.gov/pubmed/31082219,Analytical chemistry,2019 06 10,"Hydrogen-deuterium exchange-mass spectrometry (HDXMS) is a powerful technology to characterize conformations and conformational dynamics of proteins and protein complexes. HDXMS has been widely used in the field of therapeutics for the development of protein drugs. Although sufficient sequence coverage is critical to the success of HDXMS, it is sometimes difficult to achieve. In this study, we developed a HDXMS data analysis strategy that includes parallel post-translational modification (PTM) scanning in HDXMS analysis. Using a membrane-delimited G protein-coupled receptor (vasopressin type 2 receptor; V2R) and a cytosolic protein (Na+/H+ exchanger regulatory factor-1; NHERF1) as examples, we demonstrate that this strategy substantially improves protein sequence coverage, especially in key structural regions likely including PTMs themselves that play important roles in protein conformational dynamics and function.",Graphene Oxide Carburization Enhanced Ionization Efficiency for TIMS Isotope Ratio Analysis of Uranium at Trace Level.,https://www.ncbi.nlm.nih.gov/pubmed/31082218,Analytical chemistry,2019 06 10,"Isotope analysis of trace uranium is important in nuclear safeguards and nuclear forensics, which requires the analytical methodologies with high sensitivity, accuracy, and precision. As one of the most powerful techniques in isotopic measurement, thermal ionization mass spectrometry (TIMS) usually suffers from its relatively low sensitivity in ultratrace measurements. To overcome this limitation, we have developed a new filament carburization technique for TIMS, with graphene oxide (GO) as the ionization enhancer. A high and steady ionization efficiency of â¼0.2% for uranium was achieved in single-filament mode, which was 10Ã the classical double-filament method. With total evaporation (TE) measurements, this method was validated with certified reference materials (CRMs) at the picogram level, and the relative uncertainties for n(235U)/ n(238U) were as low as the â¼1% level. The enhancement mechanism of GO's promoting effect on uranium ionization was attributed to the uniform microstructure facilitating energy transfer and formation of carbides. This approach provides an alternative simple and rapid method for trace uranium isotope analysis with high sensitivity and excellent repeatability. Filament carburization and uranium loading could be accomplished within 10 min. This technique has great advantage in analysis of trace uranium isotope ratios and can be applied in the researches of environmental analysis and nuclear forensics.",Polyphosphate Chain Length Determination in the Range of Two to Several Hundred P-Subunits with a New Enzyme Assay and 31P NMR.,https://www.ncbi.nlm.nih.gov/pubmed/31082217,Analytical chemistry,2019 06 11,"Currently, 31P NMR is the only analytical method that quantitatively determines the average chain length of long inorganic polyphosphate (>80 P-subunits). In this study, an enzyme assay is presented that determines the average chain length of polyphosphate in the range of two to several hundred P-subunits. In the enzyme assay, the average polyP chain length is calculated by dividing the total polyphosphate concentration by the concentration of the polyphosphate chains. The total polyphosphate is determined by enzymatic polyphosphate hydrolysis with Saccharomyces cerevisiae exopolyphosphatase 1 and S. cerevisiae inorganic pyrophosphatase 1, followed by colorimetric orthophosphate detection. Because the exopolyphosphatase leaves one pyrophosphate per polyphosphate chain, the polyphosphate chain concentration is assayed by coupling the enzymes exopolyphosphatase (polyP into pyrophosphate), ATP sulfurylase (pyrophosphate into ATP), hexokinase (ATP into glucose 6-phosphate), and glucose 6-phosphate dehydrogenase (glucose 6-phosphate into NADPH), followed by fluorometric NADPH detection. The ability of 31P NMR and the enzyme assay to size polyP was demonstrated with polyP lengths in the range from 2 to ca. 280 P-subunits (no polyP with a longer chain length was available). The small deviation between methods (-4 Â± 4%) indicated that the new enzyme assay performed accurately. The limitations of 31P NMR (i.e., low throughput, high sample concentration, expensive instrument) are overcome by the enzyme assay that is presented here, which allows for high sample throughput and requires only a commonly available plate reader and micromole per liter concentrations of polyphosphate.",Affibody-Indocyanine Green Based Contrast Agent for Photoacoustic and Fluorescence Molecular Imaging of B7-H3 Expression in Breast Cancer.,https://www.ncbi.nlm.nih.gov/pubmed/31082216,Bioconjugate chemistry,2019 06 11,"Spectroscopic photoacoustic (sPA) molecular imaging has high potential for identification of exogenous contrast agents targeted to specific markers. Antibody-dye conjugates have recently been used extensively for preclinical sPA and other optical imaging modalities for highly specific molecular imaging of breast cancer. However, antibody-based agents suffer from long circulation times that limit image specificity. Here, the efficacy of a small protein scaffold, the affibody (ABY), conjugated to indocyanine green (ICG), a near-infrared fluorescence dye, as a targeted molecular imaging probe is demonstrated. In particular, B7-H3 (CD276), a cellular receptor expressed in breast cancer, was imaged via sPA and fluorescence molecular imaging to differentiate invasive tumors from normal glands in mice. Administration of ICG conjugated to an ABY specific to B7-H3 (ABYB7-H3-ICG) showed significantly higher signal in mammary tumors compared to normal glands of mice. ABYB7-H3-ICG is a compelling scaffold for molecular sPA imaging for breast cancer detection.",Can Density Functional Theory Be Trusted for High-Order Electric Properties? The Case of Hydrogen-Bonded Complexes.,https://www.ncbi.nlm.nih.gov/pubmed/31082215,Journal of chemical theory and computation,2019 06 13,"This work reports on an extensive assessment of the performance of a wide palette of density functional approximations in predicting the (high-order) electric properties of hydrogen-bonded complexes. To this end, we compute the electronic and vibrational contributions to the electric polarizability and the first and second hyperpolarizabilities, using the CCSD(T)/aug-cc-pVTZ level of theory as reference. For all the studied properties, the average absolute errors below 20% can only be obtained using the CAM-B3LYP functional, while LC-BLYP and MN15 are shown to be only slightly less accurate (average absolute errors not exceeding 30%). Among Minnesota density functionals, i.e., M06, M06-2X, and MN15, we only recommend the latter one, which quite accurately predicts the electronic and vibrational (hyper)polarizabilities. We also analyze the optimal tuning of the range-separation parameter Î¼ for the LC-BLYP functional, finding that this approach does not bring any systematic improvement in the predictions of electronic and vibrational (hyper)polarizabilities and the accuracy of computed properties is largely system-dependent. Finally, we report huge errors in predicting the vibrational second hyperpolarizability by ÏB97X, M06, and M06-2X functionals. Based on the explicit evaluation of anharmonic terms contributing to the second hyperpolarizability, this failure is traced down to a poor determination of third- and fourth-order energy derivatives with respect to normal modes. These results reveal serious flaws of some density functional approximations and suggest caution in selecting the appropriate functional to calculate not only electronic and vibrational (hyper)polarizabilities but also other molecular properties that contain vibrational anharmonic contributions.",Density Functionals from the Multiple-Radii Approach: Analysis and Recovery of the Kinetic Correlation Energy.,https://www.ncbi.nlm.nih.gov/pubmed/31082214,Journal of chemical theory and computation,2019 06 13,"Inspired by the exact form of the strongly interacting limit of density functional theory, Vuckovic and Gori-Giorgi have recently proposed [ J.

To facilitate the construction of improved approximations based on the MRF functional, in the present work we use reverse engineering strategies to reveal the forms of the MRF functional which reproduce the exact xc functional for small atoms. Using the adiabatic connection representation of the xc functional, we also develop an interpolation form which uses xc energy densities from the physical, weakly and strongly interacting regimes as input ingredients. We discuss how this interpolation form can be used for recovering the presently missing kinetic component of the correlation energy in the MRF framework and we asses its accuracy using highly accurate ingredients for small atoms. Applying the same interpolation form to LiH along the dissociation curve, we highlight its advantages over previous adiabatic connection-based models for the treatment of strong correlation."

However, its controllable preparation has not been implemented yet, which hinders exploring its potential applications. In this work, we introduce nonlayered Î³-Ga2S3 into the 2D materials family, which was successfully synthesized via the space-confined chemical vapor deposition method. Its intriguing defective structure are revealed by high-resolution transmission electron microscopy and temperature-dependent cathodoluminescence spectra, which endow the Î³-Ga2S3-based device with a broad photoresponse from the ultraviolet to near-infrared region and excellent photoelectric conversion capability.

A series of sequential treatments involving acetone, KOH, and H3PO4 are used to extract a protein-free hollow microcapsule. This study focuses on two critical aspects of lycopodium spores: the fate of native proteins and the wettability of the spores after a chemical treatment. Protein-free spores are desired to prevent an allergic reaction, whereas the wettability is critical for the formulation development. Although the chemically treated lycopodium spores are generally regarded as protein free, the studies that have reported this have not gone into significant depths to understand the nature of residual nitrogen observed even in spores thought to be protein free. Wettability of spores has not received any significant attention. Accordingly, in this study, we performed a comprehensive analysis of natural spores and spores after each chemical treatment step. We show that natural lycopodium spores are hydrophobic and contain low-molecular-weight proteins (â¼10 kD). Acetone treatment partially solubilizes unsaturated phospholipids from the spores. Nevertheless, the acetone-treated spores retain native proteins and are still hydrophobic. KOH treatment, however, removes a significant amount of proteins and partially hydrolyzes esters to carboxylic acid salts and results in a hydrophilic spore with a good wettability. Finally, we show that the H3PO4 treatment removes residual proteins, hydrolyzes remaining esters to carboxylic acids, and dissolves carbohydrates. H3PO4 treatment temperature controls carbohydrate dissolution, which in turn affects the hydroxyl functional groups and hydrophilicity (wettability) of the treated spores. Spores treated at 60 Â°C as opposed to 160 Â°C are amphiphilic in nature due to the abundance of hydroxyl functional groups on the surface. In conclusion, this study confirms the removal of native proteins from treated spores and sheds light on the chemical changes that the spores undergo after chemical treatment and correlates these changes to their wettability.",Confinement Assembly of ABC Triblock Terpolymers for the High-Yield Synthesis of Janus Nanorings.,https://www.ncbi.nlm.nih.gov/pubmed/31082201,ACS nano,2019 06 11,"Block copolymers are versatile building blocks for the self-assembly of functional nanostructures in bulk and solution. While spheres, cylinders, and bilayer sheets are thermodynamically preferred shapes and frequently observed, ring-shaped nanoparticles are more challenging to realize due to energetic penalties that originate from their anisotropic curvature. Today, a handful of concepts exist that produce core-shell nanorings, while more complex ( e. g., patchy) nanorings are currently out of reach and have only been predicted theoretically. Here, we demonstrate that confinement assembly of properly designed ABC triblock terpolymers is a general route to synthesize Janus nanorings in high purity. The triblock terpolymer self-assembles in the spherical confinement of nanoemulsion droplets into prolate ellipsoidal microparticles with an axially stacked lamellar-ring ( lr)-morphology. We clarified and visualized this complex, yet well-ordered, morphology with transmission electron tomography. Blocks A and C formed stacks of lamellae with the B microdomain sandwiched in-between as nanorings. Cross-linking of the B-rings allowed disassembly of the microparticles into Janus nanorings carrying two strictly separated polymer brushes of A and C on the top and bottom. Decreasing the B volume leads to Janus spheres and rods, while an increase of B results in perforated and filled Janus disks. The confinement assembly of ABC triblock terpolymers is a general process that can be extended to other block chemistries and will allow to synthesize a large variety of complex micro- and nanoparticles that inspire studies in self-assembly, interfacial stabilization, colloidal packing, and nanomedicine.",Excitation Wavelength-Dependent Dual-Mode Luminescence Emission for Dynamic Multicolor Anticounterfeiting.,https://www.ncbi.nlm.nih.gov/pubmed/31082200,ACS applied materials & interfaces,2019 05 29,"Luminescent materials have become prevalent in data communication and information security because of their special optical characteristics. Conventional luminescent materials generally exhibit unicolor emission and fixed excitation mode, resulting in decreased efficiency of anticounterfeiting applications. The development of an iridescent chameleon-like material that can change its emission color under different stimulations is a significant challenge. Here, we propose that Pb2+, Mn2+, and lanthanide cations (such as Y3+, Tb3+, Yb3+) co-doped in Na2CaGe2O6 particles can be an effective tool for designing dual-mode anticounterfeiting materials based on their tunable fluorescence/persistent luminescence transformation and excitation wavelength-dependent emission. Ultimately, a proof-of-concept anticounterfeiting fabric is obtained by using the as-prepared phosphors and exhibits a dynamic multiple color response. This work exploits the possibility of developing a new class of multimode anticounterfeit materials, which would be almost impossible to mimic or counterfeit, providing a very high level of security.",Biocompatible Nanoclusters with High Heating Efficiency for Systemically Delivered Magnetic Hyperthermia.,https://www.ncbi.nlm.nih.gov/pubmed/31082199,ACS nano,2019 06 11,"Despite its promising therapeutic potential, nanoparticle-mediated magnetic hyperthermia is currently limited to the treatment of localized and relatively accessible cancer tumors because the required therapeutic temperatures above 40 Â°C can only be achieved by direct intratumoral injection of conventional iron oxide nanoparticles. To realize the true potential of magnetic hyperthermia for cancer treatment, there is an unmet need for nanoparticles with high heating capacity that can efficiently accumulate at tumor sites following systemic administration and generate desirable intratumoral temperatures upon exposure to an alternating magnetic field (AMF). Although there have been many attempts to develop the desired nanoparticles, reported animal studies reveal the challenges associated with reaching therapeutically relevant intratumoral temperatures following systemic administration at clinically relevant doses. Therefore, we developed efficient magnetic nanoclusters with enhanced heating efficiency for systemically delivered magnetic hyperthermia that are composed of cobalt- and manganese-doped, hexagon-shaped iron oxide nanoparticles (CoMn-IONP) encapsulated in biocompatible PEG-PCL (poly(ethylene glycol)- b-poly(Îµ-caprolactone))-based nanocarriers. Animal studies validated that the developed nanoclusters are nontoxic, efficiently accumulate in ovarian cancer tumors following a single intravenous injection, and elevate intratumoral temperature up to 44 Â°C upon exposure to safe and tolerable AMF. Moreover, the obtained results confirmed the efficiency of the nanoclusters to generate the required intratumoral temperature after repeated injections and demonstrated that nanocluster-mediated magnetic hyperthermia significantly inhibits cancer growth. In summary, this nanoplatform is a milestone in the development of systemically delivered magnetic hyperthermia for the treatment of cancer tumors that are difficult to access for intratumoral injection.",Oxidative Dehydrogenation of Ethylbenzene into Styrene by Fe-Graphitic Catalysts.,https://www.ncbi.nlm.nih.gov/pubmed/31082198,ACS nano,2019 05 29,"Carbon-based catalysts have attracted much attention for the dehydrogenation (DH) of organic molecules, due to their rich active sites, high conversion efficiency, and selectivity. However, because of their poor stability at high operation temperature and relatively high cost, their practical applications have been limited. Here, we report a simple ball-milling-induced mechanochemical reaction which can introduce iron (Fe) and different functional groups (mostly stable aromatic CâO after heat-treatment) along the edges of graphitic nanoplatelets. The resulting Fe-graphitic nanoplatelets (Fe-XGnPs, X = H, C, N, or V) provide active sites for the oxidative dehydrogenation (ODH) of ethylbenzene into styrene.

Herein, we report the synthesis of a low-cost and catalytically active immobilized single molecular molybdenum disulfide on carbonized polyacrylonitrile (MoS2-cPAN) electrocatalyst. From the extended X-ray absorption fine structure spectra analysis, we found that the as-prepared material has no metal-metal scattering and it resembles MoS2 with a molecular state. Meanwhile, the size of the molecular MoS2 has been estimated to be about 1.31 nm by high-angle annular dark-field scanning transmission electron microscopy. A low coordination number and maximum utilization of the single molecular MoS2 surface enable MoS2-cPAN to demonstrate electrochemical performance significantly better than that of bulk MoS2 by two orders of exchange current density ( jo) and turnover frequency to the hydrogen evolution.",Engineering of Supramolecular Î²-Sheet and Nontoxic Amyloid Fibrils from Synthetic Oligopeptides Containing Î³-Aminobutyric Acid as the N-Terminal Residue.,https://www.ncbi.nlm.nih.gov/pubmed/31082196,ACS chemical neuroscience,2019 06 10,"Here we demonstrate that three synthetic tripeptides containing conformationally flexible Î³-aminobutyric acid (Î³-Abu) as the N-terminal residue form supramolecular Î²-sheet and nanofibrillar aggregates upon self-association in aqueous medium. Congo red and thioflavin T binding study establish that these nanofibrillar aggregates are amyloidogenic in nature. The MTT cell survival assay suggests that these amyloid-like nanofibrillar aggregates are nontoxic toward cultured Neuro 2A cells. Interestingly, none of these tripeptides bear sequence identity with any amyloid forming proteins or peptides; however upon self-association, they form supramolecular Î²-sheet and amyloid-like nanofibrils those are nontoxic in nature. The results highlight the self-assembling nature of the conformationally flexible peptides in aqueous environment and support the hypothesis that amyloid formation is the intrinsic property of the polypeptide chain. Also the cytotoxicity is not predictive from amyloid fibril formation alone. Such nontoxic amyloid fibrils can be exploited in future to design functional biomaterials for various biomedical applications.",Nanostructured High-Performance Thin-Film Transistors and Phototransistors Fabricated by a High-Yield and Versatile Near-Field Nanolithography Strategy.,https://www.ncbi.nlm.nih.gov/pubmed/31082195,ACS nano,2019 06 11,"Thin-film transistors (TFTs) and field-effect transistors (FETs) are basic units to build functional electronic circuits and investigate transport physics. In conventional TFTs or FETs, performance in terms of current level, on-off ratio, and the sensitivity of detection is limited by homogeneous semiconducting layers. In this paper, we develop TFTs with submicron heterostructures by using a strategy based on near-field photolithography. We use an array of total-reflective polydimethylsiloxane pyramids or trenches as a soft photomask in photolithography to induce multiple reflections and diffractions to focus the light. The textured feature enables the generation of gaps, dots, and grids at the nanoscale, with dimensions as small as sub-100 nm on substrates at the centimeter scale. We demonstrated the very high performance oxide TFTs on the nanoscale and periodic degenerately doped heterojunctions, and they yielded a nearly 20-fold increase in transconductance and apparent device mobility. The on-off ratio was higher than 109, with notably enhanced output current and clear scaling effect with channel length. We also built nanostructured wide-gap/narrow-gap heterojunctions to balance the high on-off ratio and sensitive photoresponse in a unidirectional phototransistor. This study shows the viability of programming a variety of nanoscale submicron patterns or interfaces in TFTs and FETs to significantly enlarge the scope of research on multifunctional TFTs and FETs.",Lotus- and Mussel-Inspired PDA-PET/PTFE Janus Membrane: Toward Integrated Separation of Light and Heavy Oils from Water.,https://www.ncbi.nlm.nih.gov/pubmed/31082194,ACS applied materials & interfaces,2019 06 13,"Current special wetting materials designed for use with oily wastewater are usually classified as either the oil-removing type or the water-removing type, which are unifunctional and limited by the oil density. Inspired by the integrated Janus system of the lotus leaf as well as the mussel-like mollusks adhered to the lotus, we fabricated a Janus polydopamine (PDA)-polyethylene terephthalate/polytetrafluoroethylene (PET/PTFE) membrane by simple immersion and tape-peeling. This membrane shows a lotuslike Janus wettability, self-cleaning effect, and floating property. Furthermore, the Janus membrane can separate light oil (Ïoil < Ïwater)/water mixtures with the superhydrophilic side facing upward, while heavy oil (Ïoil > Ïwater)/water mixtures are separated with the hydrophobic side facing upward. The separation efficiency is outstanding even after 10 repeats (>99.10%). By aid of drainage of acetone, the separation process has avoided the use of external pressure. Moreover, integrated separations of oil-in-water and water-in-oil emulsions were achieved with high efficiency. This simply prepared PDA-PET/PTFE Janus membrane has realized an integrated separation system, overcoming the monotony of traditional special wettability separation membrane and extending the bionics field into oily wastewater treatment."

Part A,2019 05 30,"Treatment of postsurgical infections, associated with orthopedic surgeries, has been a major concern for orthopedics. Several strategies including systematic and local administration of antibiotics have been proposed to this regard. The present work focused on fabricating alginate (Alg) modified brushite (Bru) cements, which could address osteogeneration and local antibiotic demands. To find the proper method of drug incorporation, Gentamicin sulfate (Gen) was loaded into the samples in the form of solution or powder. Several characterization tests including compression test, morphology, cytotoxicity, and cell adhesion assays were carried out to determine the proper concentration of Alg as a modifier of the Bru cement. The results indicated that addition of 1 wt% Alg led to superior mechanical and biological properties of the cement. Moreover, Alg addition changed the morphology of the cement from plate and needle-like structures to petal-like structure. Fourier transform infrared spectroscopy results confirmed the successful loading of Gen on the cements, specifically when Gen solution was used, and X-Ray Diffractometer result indicated that Gen caused a decrease in crystalline size. Furthermore, thermal analysis revealed that Gen-loaded sample had more stable structure as the transformation temperature slightly shifted to a higher one. The stability study confirmed the chemical stability and adequate mechanical performance of the cements within 1âmonth of soaking time. Finally, the addition of Alg has a positive impact on the release behavior at low concentration of Gen solution so that 20% decrease within 2 weeks of release experiment was remarkably detected.",Combination of vascularization and cilia formation for three-dimensional airway tissue engineering.,https://www.ncbi.nlm.nih.gov/pubmed/31081993,Journal of biomedical materials research.

Currently, there is no adequate solution for patients requiring the resection of more than half of the length of their trachea. In this study, the best conditions for combination of three different cell types from the respiratory airway system were investigated to develop a functional ciliated and pre-vascularized mucosal substitute in vitro. Primary human fibroblasts were combined with respiratory epithelial cells and endothelial cells. As scaffolds, fibrin gel and agarose-type I collagen blends were used and cultured with different medium compositions to optimize both vascularization and differentiation of the respiratory epithelium. A mixture of endothelial growth medium and epithelial differentiation medium was shown to optimize both vascularization and epithelial growth and differentiation. After 28âdays of co-culture, significantly increased formation of capillary-like structures was observed in fibrin gels with more than three times higher structure volumes compared to agarose-collagen gels. After 35âdays, epithelial differentiation into a pseudostratified epithelium with typical marker expression was improved on fibrin gels. While cilia formation was shown on both scaffolds, a higher number of ciliated cells and longer cilia were observed on fibrin gels. The data elucidate the important interplay of co-culture parameters and their impact on vascularization as well as epithelium development and provide a basis for development of functional three-dimensional airway constructs.","Speech difficulties and patient health communication mediating effects on worry and health-related quality of life in children, adolescents, and young adults with Neurofibromatosis Type 1.",https://www.ncbi.nlm.nih.gov/pubmed/31081992,American journal of medical genetics.

The Speech, Communication, Worry, Pain, Skin Itch Bother, and Skin Sensations Scales from the Pediatric Quality of Life Inventory (PedsQL) NF1 Module and the PedsQL 4.0 Generic Core Scales were completed in a multi-site national study by 305 patients ages 5-25âyears. A serial multiple mediator model analysis was conducted to test the hypothesized sequential mediating effects of speech difficulties, health communication, and worry as intervening variables in the association between NF1 symptoms and HRQOL. Symptoms predictive effects on total generic HRQOL were serially mediated by speech difficulties, patient health communication, and worry. In predictive analytics models utilizing hierarchical multiple regression analyses with age and gender demographic covariates, the pain, skin itch bother, and skin sensations multiple mediator models accounted for 61%, 59%, and 56% of the variance in generic HRQOL (pâ<â.001), reflecting large effect sizes. Speech difficulties, patient health communication, and disease-specific worry explain in part the mechanism of symptoms predictive effects on total generic HRQOL in pediatric patients with NF1.

The different types of skin cancer are named according to their source of tumor cells. Currently, there are three main types of skin cancer. They are squamous cell carcinoma, basal cell carcinoma, and melanoma. Their epidemiological characteristics, clinical classifications, and treatment methods are somewhat different. The epigenetic modifications are also different in these three types of skin cancer. Epigenetics is the change in gene expression and function and the generation of a heritable phenotype without changing the DNA sequence. The phenomenon of epigenetics involves a variety of processes, including the methylation of DNA and RNA, histone modifications, RNAi, and chromatin remodeling. Researchers have found that DNA, RNA, histone, and chromatin level modifications cause heritable changes in gene expression patterns. This review will introduce the role of epigenetics in skin cancer from the three following angles: DNA methylation, histone modifications, and RNA methylation.","New 4,5-seco-20(10â5)-abeo-Abietane Diterpenoids with Anti-Inflammatory Activity from Isodon lophanthoides var. graciliflorus (Benth.)

The flavin cofactor is surrounded by several aromatic acid residues that can act as direct and indirect electron donors to photoexcited flavin. Yet, the identity of the photochemical product states is not well established. We present a detailed full spectral reinvestigation of this issue using femtosecond fluorescence and absorption spectroscopy. Based on a recent characterization of the unstable tyrosine cation radical TyrOHâ¢+, we now propose that the primary photoproduct involves this species, which was previously not considered. Formation of this product is followed by competing charge recombination and radical pair stabilization reactions that involve proton transfer and radical transfer to tryptophan. A minimal kinetic model is proposed, including a fraction of TyrOHâ¢+ that is stabilized up to the tens of picoseconds timescale, suggesting a potential role of this species as intermediate in biochemical electron transfer reactions.",Water: How does it influence the CaCO3 formation?,https://www.ncbi.nlm.nih.gov/pubmed/31081984,Angewandte Chemie (International ed. in English),2019 05 13,"Nature produces biomineral-based materials with a fascinating set of properties using only a limited number of elements. This set of properties is obtained by closely controlling the structure and local composition of the biominerals. We are far from obtaining the same degree of control over the properties of synthetic biomineral-based composites. A contributing reason for this inferior control is our incomplete understanding of the influence of the synthesis conditions and additives on the structure and composition of the forming biominerals. In this review, we provide an overview over the current understanding of the influence of synthesis conditions and additives during different formation stages of CaCO3, one of the most abundant biominerals. We relate this influence to the structure, composition, and properties of resulting CaCO3 crystals and summarize currently known means to tune these parameters. Throughout the review, we put special emphasis on the role of water in mediating the formation of CaCO3 and thereby influencing its structure and properties, an often overlooked aspect that is of high relevance."

Lidocaine, an aminamide-type anesthetic, shows potential anticancer and chemosensitization effects in recent years. Herein, we tested the possible chemosensitization activity of lidocaine on the cytotoxicity of 5-Fu in choriocarcinoma cells. Viabilities and apoptosis of choriocarcinoma JEG-3 and JAR cells after lidocaine and/or 5-Fu treatment were detected using Cell Counting Kit-8 assay, annexin V-FITC/PI (fluorescein isothiocyanate/propidium iodide) staining and Western blot analysis, respectively. Quantitative reverse transcription polymerase chain reaction was done to measure breast cancer resistance protein (ABCG2) messenger RNA level. Western blot analysis was carried out to detect ABCG2, P-glycoprotein (P-gp), MRP1, and MRP2 protein levels. pEX-ABCG2 was transfected to elevate ABCG2 level. Then, the influence of ABCG2 on lidocaineâ+â5-Fu-caused cell viability loss, apoptosis, and inactivation of PI3K/AKT pathway were analyzed. We found that lidocaine in low concentration had no significant cytotoxicity to JEG-3 and JAR cells, but stimulated cell apoptosis in high concentration. Moreover, lidocaine potentiated the cytotoxicity of 5-Fu to JEG-3 and JAR cells through decreasing viability and increasing apoptosis. Lidocaine treatment reduced the ABCG2, P-gp, MRP1, and MRP2 protein levels in cells. Overexpression of ABCG2 reversed the synergistic effects of lidocaineâ+â5-Fu on JEG-3 and JAR cell viability and apoptosis, as well as PI3K/AKT pathway.

A comparison of results across the two studies revealed more similarities than differences. However, a few notable differences emerged from responses to qualitative questions, namely a heightened sense of appreciation for and resonance with the focus on core emotion in EFT and less frequent reports of difficulty learning and adapting to the model among Spanish-speaking therapists. These differences were consistent with common cultural values and forms of expression in Latin America and Spain.

We collected RNA sequencing (RNA-seq) data of human CLL, ALL samples, and normal peripheral blood CD19+ B cells as well as thymus samples, and analyzed similarities and differences between their transcriptomes using Cuffdiff2, DESeq, and edgeR. Compared with the RNA-seq data of normal peripheral blood CD19+ B cells and thymus samples, there were a large number of DEGs in ALL and CLL. DEGs in ALL and CLL not only have their distinguished features but also have a similar pattern. To figure out the common DEGs between CLL and ALL, we further identified 26 overlapped genes between CLL and ALL, among which 10 genes showed similar expression variation profiles whereas 16 genes showed opposite variation. The expression levels of 10 genes (SCML4, TNF-Î±, CD1C, FGFR1, MYO7B, DUSP1, PAP1GAP, MAN1C1, SLFN5, and CD8A) among the 26 genes were further confirmed by experiments, which was consistent with the results obtained by analyzing the RNA-seq data.

Nevertheless, its functional role during myocardial ischemia/reperfusion (I/R) is not entirely understood. Ischemic preconditioning (IPC) remarkably improved postischemic functional recovery followed by reduced lactate dehydrogenase (LDH) release with simultaneous upregulation of UCP2 in perfused myocardium. We then investigated the role of UCP2 in IPC-afforded cardioprotective effects on myocardial I/R injury with adenovirus-mediated in vivo UCP2 overexpression (AdUCP2) and knockdown (AdshUCP2). IPC-induced protective effects were mimicked by UCP2 overexpression, while which were abolished with silencing UCP2. Mechanistically, UCP2 overexpression significantly reinforced I/R-induced mitochondrial autophagy (mitophagy), as measured by biochemical hallmarks of mitochondrial autophagy. Moreover, primary cardiomyocytes infected with AdUCP2 increased simulated ischemia/reperfusion (sI/R)-induced mitophagy and therefore reversed impaired mitochondrial function. Finally, suppression of mitophagy with mdivi-1 in cultured cardiomyocytes abolished UCP2-afforded protective effect on sI/R-induced mitochondrial dysfunction and cell death. Our data identify a critical role for UCP2 against myocardial I/R injury through preventing the mitochondrial dysfunction through reinforcing mitophagy. Our findings reveal novel mechanisms of UCP2 in the cardioprotective effects during myocardial I/R.",Synthesis and antiageing properties of antioxidant pseudopeptides designed based on the bioisostere principle.,https://www.ncbi.nlm.nih.gov/pubmed/31081964,Archiv der Pharmazie,2019 05 29,"Nineteen antioxidant pseudopeptides were designed and synthesized.

The existence of nonnatural amino acids in L1-12 increased its stability. Pretreatment with L1-12 dose-dependently extended the lifespan of Caenorhabditis elegans. L1-12 improved resistance against UVB irradiation, oxidative stress induced by paraquat, and thermal shock. It decreased the reactive oxygen species level and upregulated the superoxide dismutase activity inside C. elegans. This pseudopeptide sensitively enhanced the expressions of the Cat-1 and Nhr-8 genes to reduce oxidative damage, leading to an extension of the lifespan. All the evidence support that L1-12 may probably be a potential antiageing agent.",Tid1-S attenuates LPS-induced cardiac hypertrophy and apoptosis through ER-a mediated modulation of p-PI3K/p-Akt signaling cascade.,https://www.ncbi.nlm.nih.gov/pubmed/31081962,Journal of cellular biochemistry,2019 05 13,"Myocardial dysfunction is clinically relevant? repercussion that follows sepsis.

In the current research endeavor, we have elucidated the role of Tid1-S on LPS-induced cardiac hypertrophy and apoptosis. Interestingly, we found that overexpression of Tid1-S suppressed TLR-4, NFATc3, and BNP protein expression which eventually led to inhibition of LPS-induced cardiac hypertrophy. Moreover, Tid1-S overexpression attenuated cellular apoptosis and activated survival proteins p-PI3K and pser473 Akt. Besides this, Tid1-S overexpression enhanced ER-a protein expression. Collectively, our data suggest that Tid1-S plausibly enhance ER-a protein and further activate p-PI3K and p ser473 Akt survival protein expression; which thereby led to attenuation of LPS-induced apoptosis in cardiomyoblast cells.

However, there have been few studies of AP-2 in insects. Here, we isolated an AP-2 gene from Apis cerana cerana (A. cerana cerana) and explored the function of this gene, named AccAP2m. The obtained amino acid sequence of AccAP2m is highly conserved across species and contains conserved features of the AP-2 family. Quantitative real-time PCR analysis showed that AccAP2m mRNA levels were high in newly emerged workers, and the expression levels were higher in muscle than in other tissues. The expression of AccAP2m was altered in response to various environmental stress factors. Moreover, overexpression of recombinant AccAP2m protein enhanced the resistance of the bacteria to HgCl2 , CdCl2 , and cumyl hydroperoxide. In addition, after knockdown of AccAP2m in A. cerana cerana by RNA interference (RNAi), the transcription of some antioxidant genes was downregulated, and the activities of some antioxidant enzymes decreased. Taken together, these results indicate that AccAP2m may play an indispensable role in response to oxidative stresses.",Obstetric and perinatal outcome of the women with repeated implantation failures or recurrent pregnancy losses who received pre- and post- conception tacrolimus treatment.,https://www.ncbi.nlm.nih.gov/pubmed/31081959,"American journal of reproductive immunology (New York, N.Y. : 1989)",2019 05 13,"Previously, we reported the clinical efficacy of tacrolimus in women with repeated implantation failures (RIF) of immune etiologies.

The species-insurance hypothesis predicts that asynchronous dynamics among species should reduce variability when biomass is aggregated either from local species populations to local multispecies communities, or from metapopulations to metacommunities. Similarly, the spatial-insurance hypothesis predicts that asynchronous spatial dynamics among either local populations or local communities should stabilize metapopulation biomass and metacommunity biomass, respectively. In combination, both species and spatial insurance reduce variation in metacommunity biomass over time, yet these insurances are rarely considered together in natural systems. We partitioned the extent that species insurance and spatial insurance reduced the annual variation in macroalgal biomass in a southern California kelp forest. We quantified variability and synchrony at two levels of organization (population and community) and two spatial scales (local plots and region) and quantified the strength of species and spatial insurance by comparing observed variability and synchrony in aggregate biomass to null models of independent species or spatial dynamics based on cyclic-shift permutation. Spatial insurance was weak, presumably because large-scale oceanographic processes in the study region led to high spatial synchrony at both population- and community-level biomass. Species insurance was stronger due to asynchronous dynamics among the metapopulations of a few common species. In particular, a regional decline in the dominant understory kelp species Pterygophora californica was compensated for by the rise of three subdominant species. These compensatory dynamics were associated with positive values of the Pacific Decadal Oscillation, indicating that differential species tolerances to warmer temperature and nutrient-poor conditions may underlie species insurance in this system. Our results illustrate how species insurance can stabilize aggregate community properties in natural ecosystems where environmental conditions vary over broad spatial scales.",The long noncoding RNA TP73-AS1 promotes tumorigenicity of medulloblastoma cells.,https://www.ncbi.nlm.nih.gov/pubmed/31081944,International journal of cancer,2019 06 12,"Medulloblastoma is the most common malignant brain cancer in children. Since previous studies have mainly focused on alterations in the coding genome, our understanding of the contribution of long noncoding RNAs (lncRNAs) to medulloblastoma biology is just emerging. Using patient-derived data, we show that the promoter of lncRNA TP73-AS1 is hypomethylated and that the transcript is highly expressed in the SHH subgroup. Furthermore, high expression of TP73-AS1 is correlated with poor outcome in patients with TP53 wild-type SHH tumors. Silencing TP73-AS1 in medulloblastoma tumor cells induced apoptosis, while proliferation and migration were inhibited in culture. In vivo, silencing TP73-AS1 in medulloblastoma tumor cells resulted in reduced tumor growth, reduced proliferation of tumor cells, increased apoptosis and led to prolonged survival of tumor-bearing mice. Together, our study suggests that the lncRNA TP73-AS1 is a prognostic marker and therapeutic target in medulloblastoma tumors and serves as a proof of concept that lncRNAs are important factors in the disease.",In limbo: A systematic review of psychological responses and coping among people with a missing loved one.,https://www.ncbi.nlm.nih.gov/pubmed/31081943,Journal of clinical psychology,2019 05 13,This review explored psychological responses and coping among loved ones left behind when a person is missing.,Survival in low-grade and high-grade sinonasal adenocarcinoma: A national cancer database analysis.,https://www.ncbi.nlm.nih.gov/pubmed/31081940,The Laryngoscope,2019 05 13,"The purpose of this study was to investigate survival differences between low-grade and high-grade sinonasal adenocarcinoma (SNAC) by examining demographics, tumor characteristics, and treatment modalities.",MicroRNA-466a-3p attenuates allergic nasal inflammation in mice by targeting GATA3.,https://www.ncbi.nlm.nih.gov/pubmed/31081939,Clinical and experimental immunology,2019 05 13,"Allergic rhinitis is thought to be an allergic disease associated with IgE-mediated immune response, characterized by increased Th2 cytokine production, elevated eosinophil levels in the nasal mucosa and induced nasal secretions.

Notably, GATA3 was identified as one of its target genes through miRNA target prediction web tools. The expression levels of miR-466a-3p were altered by mimics and lentivirus both in vivo and in vitro, as similar to those of GATA3. Furthermore, the symptoms and histology of allergic rhinitis as well as the levels of serum IgE and IL-4 were examined in different groups of mice. Interestingly, the results for lentiviral miR-466a-3p-treated allergic rhinitis mice were relatively similar to normal mice, compared to allergic rhinitis mice without treatment. Besides, miR-466a-3p negatively regulated GATA3 expression in allergic rhinitis mice, indicating the participant of Th2-cell responses in allergic rhinitis.

During severe inflammation, PCT derives from almost all cell types, including monocytes and parenchymal tissues, making it a good predictive and diagnostic marker of an inflammatory state with rapidly increased serum levels in inflammation or sepsis. In normal pregnancy, PCT is basally expressed at very low level by decidual cells, even if decidual macrophages, which in normal pregnancy are skewed to M2 macrophages, are resistant to lipopolysaccharide (LPS)-induced production of PCT. As PCT increase is associated with an inflammatory state, several research groups investigated whether PCT can be considered a marker of pre-eclampsia, a pregnancy disease characterized by systemic inflammation. The first aim of this review is to summarize what is already known about the tissues synthesizing PCT, about the stimuli that cause the increase of circulating PCT levels and how PCT acts as a proinflammatory stimulus by itself. Secondly, we will describe the role of this prohormone in normal pregnancy and in pregnancies complicated by pre-eclampsia, highlighting the involvement of the decidual macrophages and the proinflammatory cytokine tumor necrosis factor-Î± in the modulation of PCT expression in the decidual microenvironment.",Breast cancer risk in BRCA1/2 mutation carriers and noncarriers under prospective intensified surveillance.,https://www.ncbi.nlm.nih.gov/pubmed/31081934,International journal of cancer,2019 05 22,"Comparably little is known about breast cancer (BC) risks in women from families tested negative for BRCA1/2 mutations despite an indicative family history, as opposed to BRCA1/2 mutation carriers.

The study was conducted between January 1, 2005, and September 30, 2017, at 12 university centers of the German Consortium for Hereditary Breast and Ovarian Cancer. Two cohorts were prospectively followed up for incident FBC (n = 4,380; 16,398 person-years [PY], median baseline age: 39âyears) and CBC (n = 2,993; 10,090 PY, median baseline age: 42âyears).

Different functions have been attributed to these crystals, some of which are very speculative, until now. Calcium regulation and homeostasis seems to be the most widespread function of CaOx crystals. Being rich in calcium, these crystals constitute a reserve of calcium for plants. However, despite being bioavailable, this reserve is functional in just a few situations due to the low mobility of calcium for phloem translocation. Therefore, CaOx crystals as a calcium reserve is a paradox because in most cases the reserve cannot be used. However, in most plants, these crystals occur in organs or tissues that will be discarded, which allows the elimination of excess calcium. This suggests that CaOx crystals have a functional role in excess calcium excretion. There is some evidence that, for calcium, this excretory function is relevant for plants since they lack an excretory system dedicated to discarding solid wastes, such as calcium salts."

Physicians experience various incentives and deterrents to teaching medical students while providing patient care. Self-determination theory (SDT) posits people act in response to internal and external motivations and suggests autonomy, competence, and relatedness are basic psychological needs for well-being and integrity. The applicability of SDT to explain why physicians become or remain a preceptor is uncertain.

Flies were collected in traps baited with chicken liver and placed in the field at eight locations for four consecutive days each fortnight for 14 mo. The seasonal distribution of each species compared well to published seasonal distributions of these blow flies elsewhere in South Africa, with evidence of year-to-year variation within seasons that might be explained by weather. This information is important for determining when and where certain species are likely to occur and will be of use in forensic investigations and myiasis management plans.",Transfer of primary care patients receiving chronic care: the next step in the continuum of care.,https://www.ncbi.nlm.nih.gov/pubmed/31081907,International health,2019 05 13,"The burden of chronic conditions is increasing rapidly in low- and middle-income countries. Chronic conditions require long-term and continuous care, including for patients transferring between facilities. Patient transfer is particularly important in the context of health service decentralization, which has led to increasing numbers of primary care facilities at which patients can access care, and high levels of migration, which suggest that patients might require care at multiple facilities. This article provides a critical review of existing evidence regarding transfer of stable patients receiving primary care for chronic conditions. Patient transfer has received limited consideration in people living with HIV, with growing concern that patients who transfer are at risk of poor outcomes; this appears similar for people with TB, although studies are few. There are minimal data on transfer of patients with non-communicable diseases, including diabetes. Patient transfer for chronic conditions has thus received surprisingly little attention from researchers; considering the potential risks, more research is urgently required regarding reasons for and outcomes of transfers, transfer processes and interventions to optimize transfers, for different chronic conditions. Ultimately, it is the responsibility of health systems to facilitate successful transfers, and this issue requires increased attention from researchers and policy-makers.","Geographical Variations in Life Histories of House Flies, Musca domestica (Diptera: Muscidae), in Punjab, Pakistan.",https://www.ncbi.nlm.nih.gov/pubmed/31081906,Journal of medical entomology,2019 05 13,"Musca domestica Linnaeus is an important public health pest with the ability to adapt to diverse climates. Assessment of variations in biology and life-history traits of insects along geographical gradients is important for a successful management plan in different regions. We investigated life-history traits and life table parameters of M. domestica from six different geographical regions of Punjab, Pakistan: Rahim Yar Khan (RYK), Bahawalpur (BWP), Multan (MTN), Lahore (LHR), Gujrat (GJT), and Murree (MRE). Overall, M. domestica from localities of lower latitude and elevations with higher mean temperatures completed their development faster than those from localities of higher latitude and elevations with lower mean temperatures. The immature developmental time was the longest for the MRE population that was collected from higher latitude and elevation with cooler climate, whereas the shortest for the RYK population from lower latitude with warmer climate. Pupal weights were heavier for the RYK, BWP, and MTN populations, all were from the lowest latitude and elevations with warmer climate, compared with rest of the field populations. Similarly, rate of adult eclosion, fecundity, egg hatching, longevity, and life table parameters such as intrinsic rate of population increase, mean relative growth rate, net reproductive rate, and biotic potential were significantly higher for the RYK, BWP, and MTN populations compared with the GJT, LHR, and MRE populations of M. domestica.

PTH is metabolized into PTH fragments which are measured to a different extent by PTH assays of different generations. This is due to differences in fragments recognized and lack of assay standardization. PTH is measured in the workup of several conditions and clinical guidelines provide recommendations concerning these measurements. This review provides an overview of the impact of differences between PTH assays, when applying distinct clinical guidelines for primary and secondary hyperparathyroidism and perioperative use of PTH measurements. Guidelines deal with PTH measurement in different ways, recommending either trend monitoring, the use of a fold-increase of the upper reference limit, or state an absolute PTH cut-off value. For classic primary hyperparathyroidism (PHPT) the type of PTH assay used will not affect diagnosis or management as the precise concentration of PTH is less relevant. In chronic kidney disease (CKD), the guideline recommends treatment of secondary hyperparathyroidism (SHPT) above a 2-9-fold PTH increase, which will result in different clinical decisions, dependent on the assay used. For patients after bariatric surgery guidelines state absolute cut-off values for PTH, however, the impact of different generation assays is unknown as direct comparison of PTH assays has never been performed. During parathyroid surgery, PTH measurements with a third generation assay reflect treatment success more rapidly compared to second generation assays. Increased awareness among clinicians regarding the complexity of PTH measurements is warranted, as it potentially affects clinical decisions.",Dynamics of Insecticide Resistance in Different Geographical Populations of Chilo suppressalis (Lepidoptera: Crambidae) in China 2016-2018.,https://www.ncbi.nlm.nih.gov/pubmed/31081902,Journal of economic entomology,2019 05 13,"In this study, the sensitivity of 20 field populations of Chilo suppressalis (Walker) from five provinces in China to seven insecticides was evaluated during 2016-2018. The results indicated that 20 field populations of C. suppressalis had evolved moderate to high levels of resistance to triazophos (RR 64.5-461.3) and chlorpyrifos (RR 10.1-125.0). Furthermore, C. suppressalis exhibited low to moderate levels of resistance to abamectin (RR 6.5-76.5) and decreased susceptibility to cyantraniliprole (RR 1.0-34.0). The population collected from Nanchang in Jiangxi Province (JXNC) showed high resistance to chlorantraniliprole (RR 148.3-294.3), and other geographical populations remained susceptible to moderate levels of resistance (RR 1.0-37.5). In contrast, C. suppressalis remained susceptible to low levels of resistance to spinetoram (RR 1.0-6.7) and spinosad (RR 1.0-4.6). Significant correlations were found between the Log LC50 values of chlorantraniliprole and cyantraniliprole, chlorpyrifos and triazophos, as well as cyantraniliprole and chlorpyrifos and triazophos. Similarly, significant correlations were found among abamectin, chlorpyrifos, and triazophos. In addition, a significant correlation was also observed between the activity of the detoxification enzymes and the log LC50 values of chlorantraniliprole, cyantraniliprole, abamectin, chlorpyrifos, and triazophos. The findings provide an important reference for implementing effective resistance management strategies and the development of new insecticides in insect pest control."

In agroecosystems, this complexity is often human-induced as pest individuals can be exposed to many xenobiotics simultaneously. Predicting the effects of multiple stressors can be problematic, as two or more stressors can have interactive effects. Our objective was to investigate whether indirect glyphosate-based herbicide (GBH) exposure of the host plant has interactive effects in combination with an insecticide (azinphos-methyl) on an invasive pest Colorado potato beetle (Leptinotarsa decemlineata Say). We tested the effects of GBH and insecticide on the survival, insecticide target genes expression (acetylcholinesterase genes) and oxidative status biomarkers (glutathione S-transferase [GST], glucose-6-phosphate dehydrogenase [G6PDH], glutathione reductase homolog [GR], glutathione peroxidase homolog [GPx], total glutathione [totGSH], glutathione reduced-oxidized [GSH: GSSG], catalase [CAT], superoxide dismutase [SOD], lipid hydroperoxides). We found that exposure to indirect GBH has no single or interactive effects in combination with the insecticide on larval survival. However, prior exposure to GBH inhibits Ldace1 gene expression by 0.55-fold, which is the target site for the organophosphate and carbamate insecticides. This difference disappears when individuals are exposed to both GBH and insecticide, suggesting an antagonistic effect. On the other hand, oxidative status biomarker scores (PCAs of GPx, GR, and CAT) were decreased when exposed to both stressors, indicating a synergistic effect. Overall, we found that indirect GBH exposure can have both antagonistic and synergistic effects in combination with an insecticide, which should be considered when aiming for an ecologically relevant risk assessment of multiple human-induced stressors.",The association between self-reported and performance-based physical function with activities of daily living disability in the Canadian Longitudinal Study on Aging.,https://www.ncbi.nlm.nih.gov/pubmed/31081885,"The journals of gerontology.

Up to 50% of patients with type 1 and 2 DM and suboptimal glycemic control have delayed gastric emptying (GE), which can be documented with scintigraphy, 13 C-breath tests, or a wireless motility capsule; the remainder have normal or rapid GE. Many patients with delayed GE are asymptomatic; others have dyspepsia (i.e., mild-moderate indigestion, with or without a mild delay in GE) or gastroparesis, which is a syndrome characterized by moderate-severe upper gastrointestinal symptoms and delayed GE that suggest, but are not accompanied by, gastric outlet obstruction. Gastroparesis can markedly impair quality of life and up to 50% of patients have significant anxiety and/or depression. Often the distinction between dyspepsia and gastroparesis is based on clinical judgement rather than established criteria. Hyperglycemia, autonomic neuropathy, and enteric neuromuscular inflammation and injury are implicated in the pathogenesis of delayed GE. Vice versa, there are limited data to suggest that delayed GE may affect glycemic control. The management of diabetic gastroparesis is guided by the severity of symptoms, the magnitude of delayed GE, and the nutritional status. Initial options include dietary modifications, supplemental oral nutrition, and antiemetic and prokinetic medications. Patients with more severe symptoms may require a venting gastrostomy or jejunostomy and/or gastric electrical stimulation. Promising newer therapeutic approaches include ghrelin receptor agonists and selective 5-hydroxytryptamine receptor agonists.",Derivation and External Validation of a Scoring System for Predicting Fracture Risk After Ischemic Stroke in a Canadian Cohort.,https://www.ncbi.nlm.nih.gov/pubmed/31081876,JAMA neurology,2019 06 10,"The risk for low-trauma fracture is increased by more than 30% after ischemic stroke, but existing fracture risk scores do not account for history of stroke as a high-risk condition.",Same-Day vs Different-Day Elective Upper and Lower Endoscopic Procedures by Setting.,https://www.ncbi.nlm.nih.gov/pubmed/31081872,JAMA internal medicine,2019 06 10,"Performing elective upper and lower endoscopic procedures on the same day is a patient-centered and less costly approach than a 2-stage approach performed on different days, when clinically appropriate.

The differential diagnosis of these opacities is diverse and concerns frequently occurring disorders but also rare ones. Due to the diversity of diagnoses, the clinical interpretation of a soft tissue opacity is often difficult. A distinction is made among heterotopic calcifications, heterotopic ossifications, and foreign bodies. Heterotopic calcifications are subdivided into 3 groups, i.e. dystrophic, idiopathic and metastatic calcifications. In this article, stress is placed on the radiographic and clinical characteristics of heterotopic ossifications and foreign bodies, and how they can be recognised on a panoramic radiograph.

Synaptic multiplicity is plastic and changes throughout development and in different physiological conditions, being an important determinant for the efficacy of synaptic transmission. Here, we outline experiments for estimating the degree of multiplicity of synapses terminating onto a given postsynaptic neuron using whole-cell patch clamp electrophysiology in acute brain slices. Specifically, voltage-clamp recording is used to compare the difference between the amplitude of spontaneous excitatory postsynaptic currents (sEPSCs) and miniature excitatory postsynaptic currents (mEPSCs). The theory behind this method is that afferent inputs that exhibit multiplicity will show large, action potential-dependent sEPSCs due to the synchronous release that occurs at each synaptic contact. In contrast, action potential-independent release (which is asynchronous) will generate smaller amplitude mEPSCs. This article outlines a set of experiments and analyses to characterize the existence of synaptic multiplicity and discusses the requirements and limitations of the technique. This technique can be applied to investigate how different behavioral, pharmacological or environmental interventions in vivo affect the organization of synaptic contacts in different brain areas.",Culturing and Measuring Fetal and Newborn Murine Long Bones.,https://www.ncbi.nlm.nih.gov/pubmed/31081827,Journal of visualized experiments : JoVE,2019 05 13,"Long bones are complex and dynamic structures, which arise from endochondral ossification via a cartilage intermediate. The limited access to healthy human bones makes particularly valuable the use of mammalian models, such as mouse and rat, to look into different aspects of bone growth and homeostasis.

Here, we present a detailed protocol for ex vivo murine bone culture, which allows the study of bone and cartilage in a tightly controlled manner while recapitulating most of the in vivo process. The method described allows the culture of a range of bones, including tibia, femur, and metatarsal bones, but we have focused mainly on tibial culture here.

Although the average rate of translational error in model systems is estimated to be 1/10,000 per codon, the actual error rates vary widely, depending on the species, environment, and codons being studied. We have previously shown that mycobacteria use a two-step pathway for the generation of aminoacylated glutamine and asparagine tRNAs and that this is specifically associated with relatively high error rates due to the modulation of mistranslation rates by an essential component of the pathway, the amidotransferase GatCAB. We modified a previously employed Renilla-Firefly dual-luciferase system that had been used to measure mistranslation rates in Escherichia coli for use in mycobacteria to measure specific mistranslation rates of glutamate at glutamine codons and aspartate for asparagine codons. Although this reporter system was suitable for the accurate estimation of specific error rates, lack of sensitivity and requirements for excessive manipulation steps made it unsuitable for high-throughput applications. Therefore, we developed a second gain-of-function reporter system, using Nluc luciferase and green fluorescent protein (GFP), which is more amenable to medium/high-throughput settings. We used this system to identify kasugamycin as a small molecule that can decrease mycobacterial mistranslation. Although the reporters that we describe here have been used to measure specific types of mycobacterial mistranslation, they may be modified to measure other types of mistranslation in a number of model systems.",Real-time In Vitro Monitoring of Odorant Receptor Activation by an Odorant in the Vapor Phase.,https://www.ncbi.nlm.nih.gov/pubmed/31081824,Journal of visualized experiments : JoVE,2019 05 13,"Olfactory perception begins with the interaction of odorants with odorant receptors (OR) expressed by olfactory sensory neurons (OSN). Odor recognition follows a combinatorial coding scheme, where one OR can be activated by a set of odorants and one odorant can activate a combination of ORs. Through such combinatorial coding, organisms can detect and discriminate between a myriad of volatile odor molecules. Thus, an odor at a given concentration can be described by an activation pattern of ORs, which is specific to each odor. In that sense, cracking the mechanisms that the brain uses to perceive odor requires the understanding odorant-OR interactions. This is why the olfaction community is committed to ""de-orphanize""Â these receptors. Conventional in vitro systems used to identify odorant-OR interactions have utilized incubating cell media with odorant, which is distinct from the natural detection of odors via vapor odorants dissolution into nasal mucosa before interacting with ORs. Here, we describe a new method that allows for real-time monitoring of OR activation via vapor-phase odorants. Our method relies on measuring cAMP release by luminescence using the Glosensor assay. It bridges current gaps between in vivo and in vitro approaches and provides a basis for a biomimetic volatile chemical sensor.",Modified Heterotopic Hindlimb Osteomyocutaneous Flap Model in the Rat for Translational Vascularized Composite Allotransplantation Research.,https://www.ncbi.nlm.nih.gov/pubmed/31081823,Journal of visualized experiments : JoVE,2019 05 13,"Vascularized composite allotransplantation (VCA) is a relatively new field in the reconstructive surgery. Clinical achievements in human VCA include hand and face transplants and, more recently, abdominal wall, uterus, and urogenital transplants. Functional outcomes have exceeded initial expectations, and most recipients enjoy an improved quality of life. However, as clinical experience accumulates, chronic rejection and complications from the immunosuppression must be addressed. In many cases where grafts have failed, the causative pathology has been ischemic vasculopathy. The biological mechanisms of the acute and chronic rejection associated with VCA, especially ischemic vasculopathy, are important areas of research. However, due to the very small number of VCA patients, the evaluation of proposed mechanisms is better addressed in an experimental model. Multiple groups have used animal models to address some of the relevant unsolved questions in VCA rejection and vasculopathy. Several model designs involving a variety of species are described in the literature. Here we present a reproducible model of VCA heterotopic hindlimb osteomyocutaneous flap in the rat that can be utilized for translational VCA research. This model allows for the serial evaluation of the graft, including biopsies and different imaging modalities, while maintaining a low level of morbidity."
